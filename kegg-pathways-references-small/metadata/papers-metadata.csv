10037752,The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Mnn10p/Bed1p is a subunit of a Golgi mannosyltransferase complex.,10.1074/jbc.274.10.6579,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae many of the N-linked glycans on cell wall and periplasmic proteins are modified by the addition of mannan, a large mannose-containing polysaccharide. Mannan comprises a backbone of approximately 50 alpha-1,6-linked mannoses to which are attached many branches consisting of alpha-1,2-linked and alpha-1,3-linked mannoses. The initiation and subsequent elongation of the mannan backbone is performed by two complexes of proteins in the cis Golgi. In this study we show that the product of the MNN10/BED1 gene is a component of one of these complexes, that which elongates the backbone. Analysis of interactions between the proteins in this complex shows that Mnn10p, and four previously characterized proteins (Anp1p, Mnn9p, Mnn11p, and Hoc1p) are indeed all components of the same large structure. Deletion of either Mnn10p, or its homologue Mnn11p, results in defects in mannan synthesis in vivo, and analysis of the enzymatic activity of the complexes isolated from mutant strains suggests that Mnn10p and Mnn11p are responsible for the majority of the alpha-1, 6-polymerizing activity of the complex."
10092508,Cloning and expression of a novel lysophospholipase which structurally resembles lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase.,10.1006/bbrc.1999.0411,"Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is the key enzyme in the esterification of plasma cholesterol and in the reverse cholesterol transport on high-density lipoprotein (HDL). We have found a novel LCAT-related gene among differentially expressed cDNA fragments between two types of foam cells derived from THP-1 cells, which are different in cholesterol efflux ability, using a subtractive PCR technique. The deduced 412-amino-acid sequence has 49% amino acid sequence similarity with human LCAT. In contrast to the liver-specific expression of LCAT, mRNA expression of the gene was observed mainly in peripheral tissues including kidney, placenta, pancreas, testis, spleen, heart, and skeletal muscle. The protein exists in human plasma and is probably associated with HDL. Moreover, we discovered that the recombinant protein hydrolyzed lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), a proatherogenic lipid, to glycerophosphorylcholine and a free fatty acid. We have therefore named this novel enzyme LCAT-like lysophospholipase (LLPL), through which a new catabolic pathway for lysoPC on lipoproteins could be elucidated."
10198776,Regulation of bile acid biosynthesis.,10.1016/s0889-8553(05)70041-8,This article provides a review of the pathways through which cholesterol is degraded to bile acids. Regulation of key enzymes in the bile acid biosynthestic pathways is discussed. The important role of these pathways in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis and the possible therapeutic implications for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia are emphasized.
10207017,"Molecular cloning and functional expression of two members of mouse NeuAcalpha2,3Galbeta1,3GalNAc GalNAcalpha2,6-sialyltransferase family, ST6GalNAc III and IV.",10.1074/jbc.274.17.11958,"Two cDNA clones encoding NeuAcalpha2,3Galbeta1,3GalNAc GalNAcalpha2, 6-sialyltransferase have been isolated from mouse brain cDNA libraries. One of the cDNA clones is a homologue of previously reported rat ST6GalNAc III according to the amino acid sequence identity (94.4%) and the substrate specificity of the expressed recombinant enzyme, while the other cDNA clone includes an open reading frame coding for 302 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence is not identical to those of other cloned mouse sialyltransferases, although it shows the highest sequence similarity with mouse ST6GalNAc III (43.0%). The expressed soluble recombinant enzyme exhibited activity toward NeuAcalpha2, 3Galbeta1, 3GalNAc, fetuin, and GM1b, while no significant activity was detected toward Galbeta1,3GalNAc or asialofetuin, or the other glycoprotein substrates tested. The sialidase sensitivity of the 14C-sialylated residue of fetuin, which was sialylated by this enzyme with CMP-[14C]NeuAc, was the same as that of ST6GalNAc III. These results indicate that the expressed enzyme is a new type of GalNAcalpha2,6-sialyltransferase, which requires sialic acid residues linked to Galbeta1,3GalNAc residues for its activity; therefore, we designated it mouse ST6GalNAc IV. Although the substrate specificity of this enzyme is similar to that of ST6GalNAc III, ST6GalNAc IV prefers O-glycans to glycolipids. Glycolipids, however, are better substrates for ST6GalNAc III."
10217426,Native acridone synthases I and II from Ruta graveolens L. form homodimers.,10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00355-5,"Acridone synthase II cDNA was cloned from irradiated cell suspension cultures of Ruta graveolens L. and expressed in Escherichia coli. The translated polypeptide of Mr 42,681 revealed a high degree of similarity to heterologous chalcone and stilbene synthases (70-75%), and the sequence was 94% identical to that of acridone synthase I cloned previously from elicited Ruta cells. Highly active recombinant acridone synthases I and II were purified to apparent homogeneity by a four-step purification protocol, and the affinities to N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA were determined. The molecular mass of acridone synthase II was estimated from size exclusion chromatography on a Fractogel EMD BioSEC (S) column at about 45 kDa, as compared to a mass of 44 +/- 3 kDa found for the acridone synthase I on Superdex 75. Nevertheless, the sedimentation analysis by ultracentrifugation revealed molecular masses of 81 +/- 4 kDa for both acridone synthases. It is proposed, therefore, that the acridone synthases of Ruta graveolens are typical homodimeric plant polyketide synthases."
10224006,Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL14 contains a novel degradation pathway for limonene.,10.1128/AEM.65.5.2092-2102.1999,"Strain DCL14, which is able to grow on limonene as a sole source of carbon and energy, was isolated from a freshwater sediment sample. This organism was identified as a strain of Rhodococcus erythropolis by chemotaxonomic and genetic studies. R. erythropolis DCL14 also assimilated the terpenes limonene-1,2-epoxide, limonene-1,2-diol, carveol, carvone, and (-)-menthol, while perillyl alcohol was not utilized as a carbon and energy source. Induction tests with cells grown on limonene revealed that the oxygen consumption rates with limonene-1,2-epoxide, limonene-1,2-diol, 1-hydroxy-2-oxolimonene, and carveol were high. Limonene-induced cells of R. erythropolis DCL14 contained the following four novel enzymatic activities involved in the limonene degradation pathway of this microorganism: a flavin adenine dinucleotide- and NADH-dependent limonene 1, 2-monooxygenase activity, a cofactor-independent limonene-1, 2-epoxide hydrolase activity, a dichlorophenolindophenol-dependent limonene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase activity, and an NADPH-dependent 1-hydroxy-2-oxolimonene 1,2-monooxygenase activity. Product accumulation studies showed that (1S,2S,4R)-limonene-1,2-diol, (1S, 4R)-1-hydroxy-2-oxolimonene, and (3R)-3-isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanoate were intermediates in the (4R)-limonene degradation pathway. The opposite enantiomers [(1R,2R,4S)-limonene-1,2-diol, (1R, 4S)-1-hydroxy-2-oxolimonene, and (3S)-3-isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanoate] were found in the (4S)-limonene degradation pathway, while accumulation of (1R,2S,4S)-limonene-1,2-diol from (4S)-limonene was also observed. These results show that R. erythropolis DCL14 metabolizes both enantiomers of limonene via a novel degradation pathway that starts with epoxidation at the 1,2 double bond forming limonene-1,2-epoxide. This epoxide is subsequently converted to limonene-1,2-diol, 1-hydroxy-2-oxolimonene, and 7-hydroxy-4-isopropenyl-7-methyl-2-oxo-oxepanone. This lactone spontaneously rearranges to form 3-isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanoate. In the presence of coenzyme A and ATP this acid is converted further, and this finding, together with the high levels of isocitrate lyase activity in extracts of limonene-grown cells, suggests that further degradation takes place via the beta-oxidation pathway."
10225425,Vitamin B6 biosynthesis: formation of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate from 4-(phosphohydroxy)-L-threonine and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate by PdxA and PdxJ protein.,10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00393-2,"In Escherichia coli the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is synthesised de novo by a pathway that is thought to involve the condensation of 4-(phosphohydroxy)-L-threonine and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose, catalysed by the enzymes PdxA and PdxJ, to form either pyridoxine (vitamin B6) or pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP). Here we show that incubation of PdxJ with PdxA, 4-(phosphohydroxy)-L-threonine, NAD and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate, but not 1-deoxy-D-xylulose, results in the formation of PNP. The PNP formed was characterised by (i) cochromatography with an authentic standard, (ii) conversion to pyridoxine by alkaline phosphatase treatment, and (iii) UV and fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, when [2-(14)C]1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate was used as a substrate, the radioactivity was incorporated into PNP. These results clarify the previously unknown role of PdxJ in the de novo PLP biosynthetic pathway. The sugar used as substrate by PdxJ is 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate rather than the previously assumed 1-deoxy-D-xylulose. The first vitamin B6 vitamer synthesised is PNP, and not pyridoxine."
10318803,"The tumor suppressor EXT-like gene EXTL2 encodes an alpha1, 4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase that transfers N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine to the common glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region. The key enzyme for the chain initiation of heparan sulfate.",10.1074/jbc.274.20.13933,"We previously demonstrated a unique alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that transferred N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the tetrasaccharide-serine, GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Xylbeta1-O-Ser (GlcA represents glucuronic acid), derived from the common glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region, through an alpha1,4-linkage. In this study, we purified the enzyme from the serum-free culture medium of a human sarcoma cell line. Peptide sequence analysis of the purified enzyme revealed 100% identity to the multiple exostoses-like gene EXTL2/EXTR2, a member of the hereditary multiple exostoses (EXT) gene family of tumor suppressors. The expression of a soluble recombinant form of the protein produced an active enzyme, which transferred alpha-GalNAc from UDP-[3H]GalNAc to various acceptor substrates including GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Xylbeta1-O-Ser. Interestingly, the enzyme also catalyzed the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc to GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-O-naphthalenemethanol, which was the acceptor substrate for the previously described GlcNAc transferase I involved in the biosynthetic initiation of heparan sulfate. The GlcNAc transferase reaction product was sensitive to the action of heparitinase I, establishing the identity of the enzyme to be alpha1, 4-GlcNAc transferase. These results altogether indicate that EXTL2/EXTR2 encodes the alpha1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase that transfers GalNAc/GlcNAc to the tetrasaccharide representing the common glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region and that is most likely the critical enzyme that determines and initiates the heparin/heparan sulfate synthesis, separating it from the chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate synthesis."
10347028,"Monooxygenase-mediated 1,2-dichloroethane degradation by Pseudomonas sp. strain DCA1.",10.1128/AEM.65.6.2466-2470.1999,"A bacterial strain, designated Pseudomonas sp. strain DCA1, was isolated from a 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA)-degrading biofilm. Strain DCA1 utilizes DCA as the sole carbon and energy source and does not require additional organic nutrients, such as vitamins, for optimal growth. The affinity of strain DCA1 for DCA is very high, with a Km value below the detection limit of 0.5 microM. Instead of a hydrolytic dehalogenation, as in other DCA utilizers, the first step in DCA degradation in strain DCA1 is an oxidation reaction. Oxygen and NAD(P)H are required for this initial step. Propene was converted to 1,2-epoxypropane by DCA-grown cells and competitively inhibited DCA degradation. We concluded that a monooxygenase is responsible for the first step in DCA degradation in strain DCA1. Oxidation of DCA probably results in the formation of the unstable intermediate 1,2-dichloroethanol, which spontaneously releases chloride, yielding chloroacetaldehyde. The DCA degradation pathway in strain DCA1 proceeds from chloroacetaldehyde via chloroacetic acid and presumably glycolic acid, which is similar to degradation routes observed in other DCA-utilizing bacteria."
10350056,The acceptor substrate specificity of human beta4-galactosyltransferase V indicates its potential function in O-glycosylation.,10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00462-7,"In order to assess the function of the different human UDP-Gal:GlcNAc beta4-galactosyltransferases, the cDNAs of two of them, beta4-GalT I and beta4-GalT V, were expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The soluble recombinant enzymes produced were purified from the medium and used to determine their in vitro substrate specificities. The specific activity of the recombinant beta4-GalT V was more than 15 times lower than that of beta4-GalT I, using GlcNAc beta-S-pNP as an acceptor. Whereas beta4-GalT I efficiently acts on all substrates having a terminal beta-linked GlcNAc, beta4-GalT V appeared to be far more restricted in acceptor usage. Beta4-GalT V acts with high preference on acceptors that contain the GlcNAc beta1-->6GalNAc structural element, as found in O-linked core 2-, 4- and 6-based glycans, but not on substrates related to V-linked or blood group I-active oligosaccharides. These results suggest that beta4-GalT V may function in the synthesis of lacNAc units on O-linked chains, particularly in tissues which do not express beta4-GalT I, such as brain."
10364407,A gene encoding the cytokinin enzyme zeatin O-xylosyltransferase of Phaseolus vulgaris.,10.1104/pp.120.2.553,"Zeatin is the most active and ubiquitous form of the naturally occurring cytokinins. Glycosyl conjugates of zeatin are found in many plant tissues and are considered important for storage and protection against degradative enzymes. Two enzymes catalyzing the formation of O-glycosyl derivatives of zeatin have been characterized, O-glucosyltransferase and O-xylosyltransferase, occurring in seeds of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), respectively. Recently, the ZOG1 gene (zeatin O-glucosyltansferase) was isolated from P. lunatis (). Based on the ZOG1 sequence, the ZOX1 gene (zeatin O-xylosyltransferase) was cloned from P. vulgaris. ZOX1 contains an open reading frame of 1362 bp that codes for a 454-amino acid peptide of 51 kD. The recombinant protein has properties identical to the native enzyme: it catalyzes O-xylosylzeatin formation with UDP-Xyl as a glycosyl donor but does not recognize UDP-Glucose as a substrate. The ZOX1 and ZOG1 genes exhibit 93% identity at the nucleotide level and 90% similarity at the amino acid level. Neither gene contains introns. These zeatin-specific genes and their promoters will be useful for studies of the regulation of active versus storage forms of cytokinins. Comparison of sequences encoding similar enzymes with distinct substrate specificity may lead to identification of epitopes specific to cytokinin and glycosyl donor molecules."
10366774,Metabolism and selected functions of sphingolipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1016/s1388-1981(99)00068-2,"Our knowledge of sphingolipid metabolism and function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is growing rapidly. Here we discuss the current status of sphingolipid metabolism including recent evidence suggesting that exogenous sphingoid long-chain bases must first be phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated before incorporation into ceramide. Phenotypes of strains defective in sphingolipid metabolism are discussed because they provide hints about the undiscovered functions of sphingolipids and are one of the major reasons for studying this model eukaryote. The long-chain base phosphates, dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate and phytosphingosine-1-phosphate, have been hypothesized to play roles in heat stress resistance, perhaps acting as signaling molecules. We evaluate the data supporting this hypothesis and suggest future experiments needed to verify it. Finally, we discuss recent clues that may help to reveal how sphingolipid synthesis and total cellular sphingolipid content are regulated."
10394365,The crystal structure of the human hepatitis B virus capsid.,10.1016/s1097-2765(01)80009-5,"Hepatitis B is a small enveloped DNA virus that poses a major hazard to human health. The crystal structure of the T = 4 capsid has been solved at 3.3 A resolution, revealing a largely helical protein fold that is unusual for icosahedral viruses. The monomer fold is stabilized by a hydrophobic core that is highly conserved among human viral variants. Association of two amphipathic alpha-helical hairpins results in formation of a dimer with a four-helix bundle as the major central feature. The capsid is assembled from dimers via interactions involving a highly conserved region near the C terminus of the truncated protein used for crystallization. The major immunodominant region lies at the tips of the alpha-helical hairpins that form spikes on the capsid surface."
10473374,Role of Ngamma-acetyldiaminobutyrate as an enzyme stabilizer and an intermediate in the biosynthesis of hydroxyectoine.,10.1128/AEM.65.9.3774-3779.1999,"Strain CHR63 is a salt-sensitive mutant of the moderately halophilic wild-type strain Halomonas elongata DSM 3043 that is affected in the ectoine synthase gene (ectC). This strain accumulates large amounts of Ngamma-acetyldiaminobutyrate (NADA), the precursor of ectoine (D. Cánovas, C. Vargas, F. Iglesias-Guerra, L. N. Csonka, D. Rhodes, A. Ventosa, and J. J. Nieto, J. Biol. Chem. 272:25794-25801, 1997). Hydroxyectoine, ectoine, and glucosylglycerate were also identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as cytoplasmic organic solutes in this mutant. Accumulation of NADA, hydroxyectoine, and ectoine was osmoregulated, whereas the levels of glucosylglycerate decreased at higher salinities. The effect of the growth stage on the accumulation of solutes was also investigated. NADA was purified from strain CHR63 and was shown to protect the thermolabile enzyme rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase against thermal inactivation. The stabilizing effect of NADA was greater than the stabilizing effect of ectoine or potassium diaminobutyrate. A (1)H NMR analysis of the solutes accumulated by the wild-type strain and mutants CHR62 (ectA::Tn1732) and CHR63 (ectC::Tn1732) indicated that H. elongata can synthesize hydroxyectoine by two different pathways-directly from ectoine or via an alternative pathway that converts NADA into hydroxyectoine without the involvement of ectoine."
10476960,Structure of a bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit at 5.5 A resolution.,10.1038/23631,"The 30S ribosomal subunit binds messenger RNA and the anticodon stem-loop of transfer RNA during protein synthesis. A crystallographic analysis of the structure of the subunit from the bacterium Thermus thermophilus is presented. At a resolution of 5.5 A, the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA is visible, as are the alpha-helices of the ribosomal proteins, enabling double-helical regions of RNA to be identified throughout the subunit, all seven of the small-subunit proteins of known crystal structure to be positioned in the electron density map, and the fold of the entire central domain of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA to be determined."
10476961,Placement of protein and RNA structures into a 5 A-resolution map of the 50S ribosomal subunit.,10.1038/23641,"We have calculated at 5.0 A resolution an electron-density map of the large 50S ribosomal subunit from the bacterium Haloarcula marismortui by using phases derived from four heavy-atom derivatives, intercrystal density averaging and density-modification procedures. More than 300 base pairs of A-form RNA duplex have been fitted into this map, as have regions of non-A-form duplex, single-stranded segments and tetraloops. The long rods of RNA crisscrossing the subunit arise from the stacking of short, separate double helices, not all of which are A-form, and in many places proteins crosslink two or more of these rods. The polypeptide exit channel was marked by tungsten cluster compounds bound in one heavy-atom-derivatized crystal. We have determined the structure of the translation-factor-binding centre by fitting the crystal structures of the ribosomal proteins L6, L11 and L14, the sarcin-ricin loop RNA, and the RNA sequence that binds L11 into the electron density. We can position either elongation factor G or elongation factor Tu complexed with an aminoacylated transfer RNA and GTP onto the factor-binding centre in a manner that is consistent with results from biochemical and electron microscopy studies."
10497122,X-ray crystal structures of 70S ribosome functional complexes.,10.1126/science.285.5436.2095,"Structures of 70S ribosome complexes containing messenger RNA and transfer RNA (tRNA), or tRNA analogs, have been solved by x-ray crystallography at up to 7.8 angstrom resolution. Many details of the interactions between tRNA and the ribosome, and of the packing arrangements of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) helices in and between the ribosomal subunits, can be seen. Numerous contacts are made between the 30S subunit and the P-tRNA anticodon stem-loop; in contrast, the anticodon region of A-tRNA is much more exposed. A complex network of molecular interactions suggestive of a functional relay is centered around the long penultimate stem of 16S rRNA at the subunit interface, including interactions involving the ""switch"" helix and decoding site of 16S rRNA, and RNA bridges from the 50S subunit."
10499798,Crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNA polymerase at 3.3 A resolution.,10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81515-9,"The X-ray crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNA polymerase reveals a ""crab claw""-shaped molecule with a 27 A wide internal channel. Located on the back wall of the channel is a Mg2+ ion required for catalytic activity, which is chelated by an absolutely conserved motif from all bacterial and eukaryotic cellular RNA polymerases. The structure places key functional sites, defined by mutational and cross-linking analysis, on the inner walls of the channel in close proximity to the active center Mg2+. Further out from the catalytic center, structural features are found that may be involved in maintaining the melted transcription bubble, clamping onto the RNA product and/or DNA template to assure processivity, and delivering nucleotide substrates to the active center."
10517845,Ascorbate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis cell suspension culture.,10.1104/pp.121.2.535,"The biosynthesis of L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) in an Arabidopsis (L.) Heynh. cell suspension culture was studied by quantifying the effects of incubation with a range of potential biosynthetic precursors, analogs, and inhibitors on the intracellular levels of reduced and oxidized forms of L-AA. Our results support the recently published biosynthetic pathway of L-AA from L-galactose (G.L. Wheeler, M.A. Jones, N. Smirnoff [1998] Nature 393: 365-369), but suggest that Arabidopsis cell suspension culture simultaneously contains two other routes leading to L-AA. The possible physiological significance of these alternate routes is discussed."
10520990,A novel role for 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate in herpes simplex virus 1 entry.,10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80058-6,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) binds to cells through interactions of viral glycoproteins gB and gC with heparan sulfate chains on cell surface proteoglycans. This binding is not sufficient for viral entry, which requires fusion between the viral envelope and cell membrane. Here, we show that heparan sulfate modified by a subset of the multiple D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase isoforms provides sites for the binding of a third viral glycoprotein, gD, and for initiation of HSV-1 entry. We conclude that susceptibility of cells to HSV-1 entry depends on (1) presence of heparan sulfate chains to which virus can bind and (2) 3-O-sulfation of specific glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate to generate gD-binding sites or the expression of other previously identified gD-binding receptors."
10537203,Genetic organization and characteristics of the 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid degradation pathway of Comamonas testosteroni TA441.,10.1099/00221287-145-10-2813,"Comamonas testosteroni TA441 degrades 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate (3HPP) via the meta pathway. A gene cluster required for degradation of 3HPP was cloned from strain TA441 and sequenced. The genes encoding six catabolic enzymes, a flavin-type hydroxylase (mhpA), extradiol dioxygenase (mhpB), 2-keto-4-pentenoate hydratase (mhpD), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (mhpF), 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase (mhpE) and the meta cleavage compound hydrolase (mhpC), were found in this cluster, encoded in this order. mhpD and mhpF were separated by two genes, orf4 and orf5, which were not necessary for growth on 3HPP. The gene mhpR, encoding a putative transcriptional activator of the IcIR family, was located adjacent to mhpA in the opposite orientation. Disruption of the mhpB or mhpR genes affected growth on 3HPP or trans-3-hydroxycinnamate. The mhpB and mhpC gene products showed high specificity for 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) and the meta cleavage compound produced from DHPP, respectively."
10542045,"Phosphatidic acid, a key intermediate in lipid metabolism.",10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00822.x,"Phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) is a key intermediate in glycerolipid biosynthesis. Two different pathways are known for de novo formation of this compound, namely (a) the Gro3P (glycerol 3-phosphate) pathway, and (b) the GrnP (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) pathway. Whereas the former route of PtdOH synthesis is present in bacteria and all types of eukaryotes, the GrnP pathway is restricted to yeast and mammalian cells. In this review article, we describe the enzymes catalyzing de novo formation of PtdOH, their properties and their occurrence in different cell types and organelles. Much attention has recently been paid to the subcellular localization of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of PtdOH. In all eukaryotic cells, microsomes (ER) harbour the complete set of enzymes catalyzing these pathways and are thus the usual organelle for PtdOH formation. In contrast, the contribution of mitochondria to PtdOH synthesis is restricted to certain enzymes and depends on the cell type. In addition, chloroplasts of plants, lipid particles of the yeast, and peroxisomes of mammalian cells are significantly involved in PtdOH biosynthesis. Redundant systems of acyltransferases, the interplay of organelles, regulation of the pathway on the compartmental level, and finally the contribution of alternative pathways (phosphorylation of diacylglycerol and cleavage of phospholipids by phospholipases) to PtdOH biosynthesis appear to be required for the balanced formation of this important lipid intermediate. Dysfunction of enzymes involved in PtdOH synthesis can result in severe defects of various cellular processes. In this context, the possible physiological role(s) of PtdOH and its related metabolites, lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, will be discussed."
10553913,A triple beta-spiral in the adenovirus fibre shaft reveals a new structural motif for a fibrous protein.,10.1038/44880,"Human adenoviruses are responsible for respiratory, gastroenteric and ocular infections and can serve as gene therapy vectors. They form icosahedral particles with 240 copies of the trimeric hexon protein arranged on the planes and a penton complex at each of the twelve vertices. The penton consists of a pentameric base, implicated in virus internalization, and a protruding trimeric fibre, responsible for receptor attachment. The fibres are homo-trimeric proteins containing an amino-terminal penton base attachment domain, a long, thin central shaft and a carboxy-terminal cell attachment or head domain. The shaft domain contains a repeating sequence motif with an invariant glycine or proline and a conserved pattern of hydrophobic residues. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.4 A resolution of a recombinant protein containing the four distal repeats of the adenovirus type 2 fibre shaft plus the receptor-binding head domain. The structure reveals a novel triple beta-spiral fibrous fold for the shaft. Implications for folding of fibrous proteins (misfolding of shaft peptides leads to amyloid-like fibrils) and for the design of a new class of artificial, silk-like fibrous materials are discussed."
10567367,"Purification, cloning, and heterologous expression of a catalytically efficient flavonol 3-O-galactosyltransferase expressed in the male gametophyte of Petunia hybrida.",10.1074/jbc.274.48.34011,"Flavonols are plant-specific molecules that are required for pollen germination in maize and petunia. They exist in planta as both the aglycone and glycosyl conjugates. We identified a flavonol 3-O-galactosyltransferase (F3GalTase) that is expressed exclusively in the male gametophyte and controls the formation of a pollen-specific class of glycosylated flavonols. Thus an essential step to understanding flavonol-induced germination is the characterization of F3GalTase. Amino acid sequences of three peptide fragments of F3GalTase purified from petunia pollen were used to isolate a full-length cDNA clone. RNA gel blot analysis and enzyme assays confirmed that F3GalTase expression is restricted to pollen. Heterologous expression of the F3GalTase cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded active recombinant enzyme (rF3GalTase) which had the identical substrate specificity as the native enzyme. Unlike the relatively nonspecific substrate usage of flavonoid glycosyltransferases from sporophytic tissues, F3GalTase uses only UDP-galactose and flavonols to catalyze the formation of flavonol 3-O-galactosides. Kinetic analysis showed that the k(cat)/K(m) values of rF3GalTase, using kaempferol and quercetin as substrates, approaches that of a catalytically perfect enzyme. rF3GalTase catalyzes the reverse reaction, generation of flavonols from UDP and flavonol 3-O-galactosides, almost as efficiently as the forward reaction. The biochemical characteristics of F3GalTase are discussed in the context of a role in flavonol-induced pollen germination."
10572115,"Bacillus subtilis yckG and yckF encode two key enzymes of the ribulose monophosphate pathway used by methylotrophs, and yckH is required for their expression.",10.1128/JB.181.23.7154-7160.1999,"The ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway is one of the metabolic pathways for the synthesis of compounds containing carbon-carbon bonds from one-carbon units and is found in many methane- and methanol-utilizing bacteria, which are known as methylotrophs. The characteristic enzymes of this pathway are 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (PHI), neither of which was thought to exist outside methylotrophs. However, the presumed yckG gene product (YckG) of Bacillus subtilis shows a primary structure similar to that of methylotroph HPS (F. Kunst et al., Nature 390:249-256, 1997). We have also investigated the sequence similarity between the yckF gene product (YckF) and methylotroph PHI (Y. Sakai, R. Mitsui, Y. Katayama, H. Yanase, and N. Kato, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 176:125-130, 1999) and found that the yckG and yckF genes of B. subtilis express enzymatic activities of HPS and PHI, respectively. Both of these activities were concomitantly induced in B. subtilis by formaldehyde, with induction showing dependence on the yckH gene, but were not induced by methanol, formate, or methylamine. Disruption of either gene caused moderate sensitivity to formaldehyde, suggesting that these enzymes may act as a detoxification system for formaldehyde in B. subtilis. In conclusion, we found an active yckG (for HPS)-yckF (for PHI) gene structure (now named hxlA-hxlB) in a nonmethylotroph, B. subtilis, which inherently preserves the RuMP pathway."
10580130,Pathways of O-glycan biosynthesis in cancer cells.,10.1016/s0304-4165(99)00170-1,"Glycoproteins with O-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains of complex structures and functions are found in secretions and on the cell surfaces of cancer cells. The structures of O-glycans are often unusual or abnormal in cancer, and greatly contribute to the phenotype and biology of cancer cells. Some of the mechanisms of changes in O-glycosylation pathways have been determined in cancer model systems. However, O-glycan biosynthesis is a complex process that is still poorly understood. The glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases that synthesize O-glycans appear to exist as families of related enzymes of which individual members are expressed in a tissue- and growth-specific fashion. Studies of their regulation in cancer may reveal the connection between cancerous transformation and glycosylation which may help to understand and control the abnormal biology of tumor cells. Cancer diagnosis may be based on the appearance of certain glycosylated epitopes, and therapeutic avenues have been designed to attack cancer cells via their glycans."
10581243,"NF-kappaB activation by a signaling complex containing TRAF2, TANK and TBK1, a novel IKK-related kinase.",10.1093/emboj/18.23.6694,"The activation of NF-kappaB by receptors in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor families requires the TRAF family of adaptor proteins. Receptor oligomerization causes the recruitment of TRAFs to the receptor complex, followed by the activation of a kinase cascade that results in the phosphorylation of IkappaB. TANK is a TRAF-binding protein that can inhibit the binding of TRAFs to receptor tails and can also inhibit NF-kappaB activation by these receptors. However, TANK also displays the ability to stimulate TRAF-mediated NF-kappaB activation. In this report, we investigate the mechanism of the stimulatory activity of TANK. We find that TANK interacts with TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1), a novel IKK-related kinase that can activate NF-kappaB in a kinase-dependent manner. TBK1, TANK and TRAF2 can form a ternary complex, and complex formation appears to be required for TBK1 activity. Kinase-inactive TBK1 inhibits TANK-mediated NF-kappaB activation but does not block the activation mediated by TNF-alpha, IL-1 or CD40. The TBK1-TANK-TRAF2 signaling complex functions upstream of NIK and the IKK complex and represents an alternative to the receptor signaling complex for TRAF-mediated activation of NF-kappaB."
10586892,Signalling through the high-affinity IgE receptor Fc epsilonRI.,10.1038/35037021,"The Fc epsilonRI complex forms a high-affinity cell-surface receptor for the Fc region of antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) molecules. Fc epsilonRI is multimeric and is a member of a family of related antigen/Fc receptors which have conserved structural features and similar roles in initiating intracellular signalling cascades. In humans, Fc epsilonRI controls the activation of mast cells and basophils, and participates in IgE-mediated antigen presentation. Multivalent antigens bind and crosslink IgE molecules held at the cell surface by Fc epsilonRI. Receptor aggregation induces multiple signalling pathways that control diverse effector responses. These include the secretion of allergic mediators and induction of cytokine gene transcription, resulting in secretion of molecules such as interleukin-4, interleukin-6, tumour-necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Fc epsilonRI is therefore central to the induction and maintenance of an allergic response and may confer physiological protection in parasitic infections."
10589735,The oxygenase component of the 2-aminobenzenesulfonate dioxygenase system from Alcaligenes sp. strain O-1.,10.1099/00221287-145-11-3255,"Growth of Alcaligenes sp. strain O-1 with 2-aminobenzenesulfonate (ABS; orthanilate) as sole source of carbon and energy requires expression of the soluble, multicomponent 2-aminobenzenesulfonate 2,3-dioxygenase system (deaminating) (ABSDOS) which is plasmid-encoded. ABSDOS was separated by anion-exchange chromatography to yield a flavin-dependent reductase component and an iron-dependent oxygenase component. The oxygenase component was purified to about 98% homogeneity and an alpha2beta2 subunit structure was deduced from the molecular masses of 134,45 and 16 kDa for the native complex, and the alpha and beta subunits, respectively. Analysis of the amount of acid labile sulfur and total iron, and the UV spectrum of the purified oxygenase component indicated one [2Fe-2S] Rieske centre per alpha subunit. The inhibition of activity by the iron-specific chelator o-phenanthroline indicated the presence of an additional iron-binding site. Recovery of active protein required strictly anoxic conditions during all purification steps. The FAD-containing reductase could not be purified. ABSDOS oxygenated nine sulfonated compounds; no oxygen uptake was detected with carboxylated aromatic compounds or with aliphatic sulfonated compounds. Km values of 29, 18 and 108 microM and Vmax values of 140, 110 and 72 pkat for ABS, benzenesulfonate and 4-toluenesulfonate, respectively, were observed. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the alpha- and beta-subunits of the oxygenase component allowed PCR primers to be deduced and the DNA sequence of the alpha-subunit was thereafter determined. Both redox centres were detected in the deduced amino acid sequence. Sequence data and biochemical properties of the enzyme system indicate a novel member of the class IB ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases."
10601204,Genetic analysis of a chromosomal region containing genes required for assimilation of allantoin nitrogen and linked glyoxylate metabolism in Escherichia coli.,10.1128/JB.181.24.7479-7484.1999,"Growth experiments with Escherichia coli have shown that this organism is able to use allantoin as a sole nitrogen source but not as a sole carbon source. Nitrogen assimilation from this compound was possible only under anaerobic conditions, in which all the enzyme activities involved in allantoin metabolism were detected. Of the nine genes encoding proteins required for allantoin degradation, only the one encoding glyoxylate carboligase (gcl), the first enzyme of the pathway leading to glycerate, had been identified and mapped at centisome 12 on the chromosome map. Phenotypic complementation of mutations in the other two genes of the glycerate pathway, encoding tartronic semialdehyde reductase (glxR) and glycerate kinase (glxK), allowed us to clone and map them closely linked to gcl. Complete sequencing of a 15.8-kb fragment encompassing these genes defined a regulon with 12 open reading frames (ORFs). Due to the high similarity of the products of two of these ORFs with yeast allantoinase and yeast allantoate amidohydrolase, a systematic analysis of the gene cluster was undertaken to identify genes involved in allantoin utilization. A BLASTP search predicted four of the genes that we sequenced to encode allantoinase (allB), allantoate amidohydrolase (allC), ureidoglycolate hydrolase (allA), and ureidoglycolate dehydrogenase (allD). The products of these genes were overexpressed and shown to have the predicted corresponding enzyme activities. Transcriptional fusions to lacZ permitted the identification of three functional promoters corresponding to three transcriptional units for the structural genes and another promoter for the regulatory gene allR. Deletion of this regulatory gene led to constitutive expression of the regulon, indicating a negatively acting function."
10625426,3D map of the plant photosystem II supercomplex obtained by cryoelectron microscopy and single particle analysis.,10.1038/71242,"Here we describe the first 3D structure of the photosystem II (PSII) supercomplex of higher plants, constructed by single particle analysis of images obtained by cryoelectron microscopy. This large multisubunit membrane protein complex functions to absorb light energy and catalyze the oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. The resolution of the 3D structure is 24 A and emphasizes the dimeric nature of the supercomplex. The extrinsic proteins of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) are readily observed as a tetrameric cluster bound to the lumenal surface. By considering higher resolution data, obtained from electron crystallography, it has been possible to relate the binding sites of the OEC proteins with the underlying intrinsic membrane subunits of the photochemical reaction center core. The model suggests that the 33 kDa OEC protein is located towards the CP47/D2 side of the reaction center but is also positioned over the C-terminal helices of the D1 protein including its CD lumenal loop. In contrast, the model predicts that the 23/17 kDa OEC proteins are positioned at the N-terminus of the D1 protein incorporating the AB lumenal loop of this protein and two other unidentified transmembrane helices. Overall the 3D model represents a significant step forward in revealing the structure of the photosynthetic OEC whose activity is required to sustain the aerobic atmosphere on our planet."
10627048,Functional analysis of genes responsible for the synthesis of the B-band O antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O6 lipopolysaccharide.,10.1099/00221287-145-12-3505,"This study reports the organization of the wbp gene cluster and characterization of a number of genes that are essential for B-band O antigen biosynthesis in the clinically prevalent Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06. Twelve genes were identified that share homology with other LPS and polysaccharide biosynthetic genes. This cluster contains homologues of wzx (encoding the O antigen flippase/translocase) and wzz (which modulates O antigen chain length distribution) genes, typical of a wzy-dependent pathway. However, a complete wzy gene (encoding the O-polymerase) was not found within the cluster. Four biosynthetic genes, wbpO, wbpP, wbpV and wbpM, and four putative glycosyltransferase genes, wbpR, wbpT, wbpU and wbpL, were identified in the cluster. To characterize their roles in LPS biosynthesis, null mutants of wbpO, wbpP, wbpV, wbpL and wbpM were generated using a gene-replacement strategy. Mutations in each of these genes caused deficiency in B-band synthesis. The wbpL mutant was deficient in both A-band and B-band LPS. WbpL(O6) is a bi-functional enzyme which could initiate B-band synthesis through the addition of QuiNAc to undecaprenol phosphate, and A-band synthesis by transferring either a GalNAc or a GlcNAc residue. Another approach used to assign function to the wbp(O6) genes was by complementation analysis. Two genes from Salmonella typhi, wcdA and wcdB, responsible for the synthesis of a homopolymer of GalNAcA called Vi antigen were used in complementation experiments to verify the functions of wbpO and wbpP. wcdA and wcdB restored B-band synthesis in wbpO and wbpP mutants respectively, implying that wbpO and wbpP are involved in UDP-GalNAcA synthesis. Although wbpV has homology to wbpK of the serotype O5 B-band LPS synthesis cluster, complementation analysis using the respective null mutants showed that the genes are not interchangeable. A knockout mutation of wbpN (located downstream of wbpM) did not abrogate LPS synthesis in either 05 or 06; therefore, it has been renamed orf48.5. These results establish the organization of genes involved in P. aeruginosa B-band O antigen synthesis and provide the evidence to assign functions to a number of LPS biosynthetic genes."
10629170,Anaerobic toluene catabolism of Thauera aromatica: the bbs operon codes for enzymes of beta oxidation of the intermediate benzylsuccinate.,10.1128/JB.182.2.272-277.2000,"The pathway of anaerobic toluene oxidation to benzoyl coenzyme A (benzoyl-CoA) consists of an initial reaction catalyzed by benzylsuccinate synthase, a glycyl radical enzyme adding the methyl group of toluene to the double bond of a fumarate cosubstrate, and a subsequent beta-oxidation pathway of benzylsuccinate. Benzylsuccinate synthase has been studied in some detail, whereas the enzymes participating in beta oxidation of benzylsuccinate are unknown. We have investigated these enzymes by analyzing substrate-induced proteins in toluene-grown cells. Toluene-induced proteins were identified and N-terminally sequenced. Nine of these proteins are encoded by an 8.5-kb operon consisting of bbs (beta-oxidation of benzylsuccinate) genes whose products are apparently involved in the beta-oxidation pathway of benzylsuccinate. Two of the genes, bbsE and bbsF, code for the subunits of a succinyl-CoA:benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase whose activity was previously detected in toluene-grown Thauera aromatica. The bbsG gene codes for a specific benzylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase, as confirmed by overexpression of the gene in Escherichia coli and detection of enzyme activity. The further enzymes of the pathway are probably encoded by bbsH (enoyl-CoA hydratase), bbsCD (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and bbsB (3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase). The operon contains two additional genes, bbsA and bbsI, for which no obvious function could be derived. The bbs operon is expressed only in toluene-grown cells and is regulated at the transcriptional level. Promoter mapping revealed a transcription start site upstream of the bbsA gene. This represents the first known promoter site in Thauera spp."

Cloning, functional expression in Pichia pastoris, and substrate specificity of the isolated recombinant enzymes.",10.1074/jbc.275.3.1966,"The first committed steps in the biosynthesis of the two cyanogenic glucosides linamarin and lotaustralin in cassava are the conversion of L-valine and L-isoleucine, respectively, to the corresponding oximes. Two full-length cDNA clones that encode cytochromes P-450 catalyzing these reactions have been isolated. The two cassava cytochromes P-450 are 85% identical, share 54% sequence identity to CYP79A1 from sorghum, and have been assigned CYP79D1 and CYP79D2. Functional expression has been achieved using the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris. The amount of CYP79D1 isolated from 1 liter of P. pastoris culture exceeds the amounts that putatively could be isolated from 22,000 grown-up cassava plants. Each cytochrome P-450 metabolizes L-valine as well as L-isoleucine consistent with the co-occurrence of linamarin and lotaustralin in cassava. CYP79D1 was isolated from P. pastoris. Reconstitution in lipid micelles showed that CYP79D1 has a higher k(c) value with L-valine as substrate than with L-isoleucine, which is consistent with linamarin being the major cyanogenic glucoside in cassava. Both CYP79D1 and CYP79D2 are present in the genome of cassava cultivar MCol22 in agreement with cassava being allotetraploid. CYP79D1 and CYP79D2 are actively transcribed, and production of acyanogenic cassava plants would therefore require down-regulation of both genes."
10652340,Purification and characterization of a neutral ceramidase from mouse liver. A single protein catalyzes the reversible reaction in which ceramide is both hydrolyzed and synthesized.,10.1074/jbc.275.5.3462,"We report here a novel ceramidase that was purified more than 150, 000-fold from the membrane fraction of mouse liver. The enzyme was a monomeric polypeptide having a molecular mass of 94 kDa and was highly glycosylated with N-glycans. The amino acid sequence of a fragment obtained from the purified enzyme was homologous to those deduced from the genes encoding an alkaline ceramidase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a hypotheical protein of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. However, no significant sequence similarities were found in other known functional proteins including acid ceramidases of humans and mice. The enzyme hydrolyzed various N-acylsphingosines but not galactosylceramide, sulfatide, GM1a, or sphingomyelin. The enzyme exhibited the highest activity around pH 7.5 and was thus identified as a type of neutral ceramidase. The apparent K(m) and V(max) values for C12-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1, 3-diazole-ceramide and C16-(14)C-ceramide were 22.3 microM and 29.1 micromol/min/mg and 72.4 microM and 3.6 micromol/min/mg, respectively. This study also clearly demonstrated that the purified 94-kDa ceramidase catalyzed the condensation of fatty acid to sphingosine to generate ceramide, but did not catalyze acyl-CoA-dependent acyl-transfer reaction."
10652548,Postsynaptic protein phosphorylation and LTP.,10.1016/s0166-2236(99)01490-3,"Prolonged changes in synaptic strength, such as those that occur in LTP and LTD, are thought to contribute to learning and memory processes. These complex phenomena occur in diverse brain structures and use multiple, temporally staged and spatially resolved mechanisms, such as changes in neurotransmitter release, modulation of transmitter receptors, alterations in synaptic structure, and regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the combined activation of SRC family tyrosine kinases, protein kinase A, protein kinase C and, in particular, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II results in phosphorylation of glutamate-receptor-gated ion channels and the enhancement of subsequent postsynaptic current. Crosstalk between these complex biochemical pathways can account for most characteristics of early-phase LTP in this region."

The reaction required NADPH and molecular oxygen, and was blocked by carbon monoxide as well as by several other cytochrome P450 inhibitors, indicating that the reaction was mediated by cytochrome P450. Of the substrates examined, only specificity for loganin was demonstrated. A possible reaction mechanism is described."

Interaction between these receptors and ligands on the particle results in signal transduction events that lead to actin polymerisation and phagosome formation. The phagosome then undergoes a maturation process whereby it transforms into a phagolysosome. Phagosome maturation depends on interactions (fusion events) with early and late endosomes as well as with lysosomes. The fusion processes are regulated by small GTP-binding proteins and other proteins that are also involved in fusion processes in the endocytic pathway. Although most phagocytosed microorganisms are killed in the lysosome, some pathogens have developed survival strategies and are able to live in the harsh conditions in the phagolysosome or interfere with the maturation process and thereby evade destruction by acid hydrolases."

Here, consistent with the idea that cytoplasmic proteins found in shockates have an affinity for membranes, a small fraction of each was found in membrane preparations. Two procedures demonstrated that the enzymes were enriched in a minor membrane fraction of buoyant density intermediate between that of cytoplasmic and outer membranes, providing indirect support for the notion that these proteins have a role in enterobactin excretion as well as synthesis."
10707049,Activation of MAPK cascades by G-protein-coupled receptors: the case of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor.,10.1016/s1043-2760(99)00232-5,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large group of integral membrane receptors that transmit signals from a diverse array of external stimuli, including neurotransmitters, hormones, phospholipids, photons, odorants and taste ligands. In response to ligand binding, the GPCRs initiate diverse downstream signaling pathways through four groups of G proteins and other interacting proteins. Key components in GPCR-induced intracellular signaling are four groups of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades: extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38MAPK and big MAPK (BMK). The hallmark of MAPK signaling is the stimulation-dependent nuclear translocation of the involved kinases, which regulate gene expression and the cytoplasmic acute response to mitogenic, stress-related, apoptotic and survival stimuli. A special type of GPCR is the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor, which uses primarily the Gq protein for its downstream signaling. GnRH activates all four MAPK cascades by a PKC-dependent mechanism. Common signaling molecules, including the tyrosine kinase c-SRC and the small GTPases CDC42, RAC and RAS, are implicated in various aspects of the GnRH-MAPK pathways. Thus, the activation of MAPK cascades by GnRH opens a new vista in the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding gonadotropins. However, additional studies on cell lines and whole animals are required to understand GnRH signaling in the context of other hormones during the reproductive cycle of mouse and human."

The isolated cDNA clone designated pVTR1 predicted a type II membrane protein with 19 amino acids of cytoplasmic domain, 26 amino acids of transmembrane region, and a catalytic domain with 308 amino acids. Introduction of the cDNA clone into L cells resulted in the neosynthesis of Gb3/CD77, and the extracts of the transfectant cells showed alpha1, 4-galactosyltransferase activity only on lactosylceramide and galactosylceramide. In Northern blotting, a 2.3-kilobase mRNA was strongly expressed in heart, kidney, spleen, and placenta and weakly in colon, small intestine, and brain. Transfection of the cDNA into L cells resulted in the constitution of sensitivity to the apoptosis with Shiga-like toxins (verotoxins). Since Gb3/CD77 synthase initiates the synthesis of globo series glycolipids, the isolation of this cDNA will make possible further investigations into the function of its important series of glycolipids."
10751659,Neurotransmitters and gap junctions in developing neural circuits.,10.1016/s0165-0173(99)00069-7,"A growing body of evidence suggests that highly correlated, spontaneous neural activity plays an important role in shaping connections in the developing nervous system prior to the maturation of sensory afferents. In this article we discuss the mechanisms involved in the generation and the regulation of spontaneous activity patterns in the developing retina and the developing neocortex. Spontaneous activity in the developing retina propagates across the ganglion cell layer as waves of action potentials and drives rhythmic increases in intracellular calcium in retinal neurons. Retinal waves are mediated by a combination of chemical synaptic transmission and gap junctions, and the circuitry responsible for generating retinal waves changes with age and between species. In the developing cortex, spontaneous calcium elevations propagate across clusters of cortical neurons called domains. Cortical domains are generated by a regenerative mechanism involving second messenger diffusion through gap junctions and subsequent calcium release from internal stores. The neocortical gap junction system is regulated by glutamate-triggered second messenger systems as well as neuromodulatory transmitters, suggesting extensive interactions between synaptic transmission and information flow through gap junctions. The interaction between gap junctions and chemical synaptic transmission observed in these developing networks represent a powerful mechanism by which activity across large groups of neurons can be correlated."

10784442,Architecture of RNA polymerase II and implications for the transcription mechanism.,10.1126/science.288.5466.640,"A backbone model of a 10-subunit yeast RNA polymerase II has been derived from x-ray diffraction data extending to 3 angstroms resolution. All 10 subunits exhibit a high degree of identity with the corresponding human proteins, and 9 of the 10 subunits are conserved among the three eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II, and III. Notable features of the model include a pair of jaws, formed by subunits Rpb1, Rpb5, and Rpb9, that appear to grip DNA downstream of the active center. A clamp on the DNA nearer the active center, formed by Rpb1, Rpb2, and Rpb6, may be locked in the closed position by RNA, accounting for the great stability of transcribing complexes. A pore in the protein complex beneath the active center may allow entry of substrates for polymerization and exit of the transcript during proofreading and passage through pause sites in the DNA."
10811648,Molecular characterization of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine:3'-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4'-O-methyltransferase involved in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis in Coptis japonica.,10.1074/jbc.M002439200,"S-adenosyl-L-methionine:3'-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4'-O-methyltransferase (4'-OMT) catalyzes the conversion of 3'-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine to reticuline, an important intermediate in synthesizing isoquinoline alkaloids. In an earlier step in the biosynthetic pathway to reticuline, another O-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase (6-OMT), catalyzes methylation of the 6-hydroxyl group of norcoclaurine. We isolated two kinds of cDNA clones that correspond to the internal amino acid sequences of a 6-OMT/4'-OMT preparation from cultured Coptis japonica cells. Heterologously expressed proteins had 6-OMT or 4'-OMT activities, indicative that each cDNA encodes a different enzyme. 4'-OMT was purified using recombinant protein, and its enzymological properties were characterized. It had enzymological characteristics similar to those of 6-OMT; the active enzyme was the dimer of the subunit, no divalent cations were required for activity, and there was inhibition by Fe(2+), Cu(2+), Co(2+), Zn(2+), or Ni(2+), but none by the SH reagent. 4'-OMT clearly had different substrate specificity. It methylated (R,S)-6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline, as well as (R, S)-laudanosoline and (R,S)-norlaudanosoline. Laudanosoline, an N-methylated substrate, was a much better substrate for 4'-OMT than norlaudanosoline. 6-OMT methylated norlaudanosoline and laudanosoline equally. Further characterization of the substrate saturation and product inhibition kinetics indicated that 4'-OMT follows an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, whereas 6-OMT follows a Ping-Pong Bi Bi mechanism. The molecular evolution of these two related O-methyltransferases is discussed."

The distribution of each of these genes amongst the 20 P. aeruginosa international antigenic typing system (IATS) serogroups was analyzed by Southern blot. As shown previously, wbpM was present in all 20 serogroups. The remaining O11 O antigen genes, with the exception of wzy, were present in the serogroup O17 strain IATSO17, despite the structural unrelatedness of the O11 and O17 O antigens. Sequencing revealed the presence of a cryptic serogroup O11 locus in the IATSO17 interrupted by two copies of a 1.1-kb insertion element. Introduction of plasmid pLPS2, containing the complete O11 O antigen locus from strain PA103, into IATSO17 resulted in production of both the O11 and O17 O antigens. The results of insertional inactivation of wbpM in IATSO17 are discussed."

(Dihydro)carveol-grown cells of R. erythropolis DCL14 contained the following enzymic activities involved in the carveol and dihydrocarveol degradation pathways of this micro-organism: (dihydro)carveol dehydrogenase (both NAD+- and dichlorophenolindophenol-dependent activities), an unknown cofactor-dependent carvone reductase, (iso-)dihydrocarvone isomerase activity, NADPH-dependent dihydrocarvone monooxygenase (Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase), epsilon-lactone hydrolase and an NAD+-dependent 6-hydroxy-3-isopropenylheptanoate dehydrogenase. Product accumulation studies identified (4R)-carvone, (1R,4R)-dihydrocarvone, (4R,7R)-4-isopropenyl-7-methyl-2-oxo-oxepanone, (3R)-6-hydroxy-3-isopropenylheptanoate, (3R)-3-isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanoate, (3S,6R)-6-isopropenyl-3-methyl-2-oxooxepanone and (5R)-6-hydroxy-5-isopropenyl-2-methylhexanoate as intermediates in the (4R)-carveol degradation pathway. The opposite stereoisomers of these compounds were identified in the (4S)-carveol degradation pathway. With dihydrocarveol, the same intermediates are involved except that carvone was absent. These results show that R. erythropolis DCL14 metabolizes all four diastereomers of carveol via oxidation to carvone, which is subsequently stereospecifically reduced to (1R)-(iso-) dihydrocarvone. At this point also dihydrocarveol enters the pathway, and this compound is directly oxidized to (iso-)dihydrocarvone. Cell extracts contained both (1R)-(iso-)dihydrocarvone 1,2-monooxygenase and (1S)-(iso)-dihydrocarvone 2,3-monooxygenase activity, resulting in a branch point of the degradation pathway; (1R)-(iso-)dihydrocarvone was converted to 4-isopropenyl-7-methyl-2-oxo-oxepanone, while (1S)-(iso)-dihydrocarvone, which in vivo is isomerized to (1R)-(iso-)dihydrocarvone, was converted to 6-isopropenyl-3-methyl-2-oxo-oxepanone. 4-Isopropenyl-7-methyl-2-oxooxepanone is hydrolysed to 6-hydroxy-3-isopropenylheptanoate, which is subsequently oxidized to 3-isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanoate, thereby linking the (dihydro)carveol degradation pathways to the limonene degradation pathway of this micro-organism. 6-Isopropenyl-3-methyl-2-oxo-oxepanone is, in vitro, hydrolysed to 6-hydroxy-5-isopropenyl-2-methylhexanoate, which is thought to be a dead-end metabolite."
10837462,"The beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase beta 3GalT-V is a stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3) synthase.",10.1074/jbc.C000263200,"We have previously reported the molecular cloning of beta1, 3-galactosyltransferase-V (beta3GalT-V), which catalyzes the transfer of Gal to GlcNAc-based acceptors with a preference for the core3 O-linked glycan GlcNAc(beta1,3)GalNAc structure. Further characterization indicated that the recombinant beta3GalT-V enzyme expressed in Sf9 insect cells also utilized the glycolipid Lc3Cer as an efficient acceptor. Surprisingly, we also found that beta3GalT-V catalyzes the transfer of Gal to the terminal GalNAc unit of the globoside Gb4, thereby synthesizing the glycolipid Gb5, also known as the stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3). The SSEA-3 synthase activity of beta3GalT-V was confirmed in vivo by stable expression of the human beta3GalT-V gene in F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells, as detected with the monoclonal antibody MC-631 by flow cytometry analysis and immunostaining of extracted glycolipids. The biological relation between SSEA-3 formation and beta3GalT-V was further documented by showing that F9 cells treated with the differentiation-inducing agent retinoic acid induced the expression of both the SSEA-3 epitope and the endogenous mouse beta3GalT-V gene. This study represents the first example of a glycosyltransferase, which utilizes two kinds of sugar acceptor substrates without requiring any additional modifier molecule."

This complex is evolutionarily related to the Mediator complex from yeast and, on the basis of its structural and functional characteristics, promises to be a key target of diverse regulatory circuits."
10854427,"Expression cloning of a new member of the ABO blood group glycosyltransferases, iGb3 synthase, that directs the synthesis of isoglobo-glycosphingolipids.",10.1074/jbc.M002629200,"The large array of different glycolipids described in mammalian tissues is a reflection, in part, of diverse glycosyltransferase expression. Herein, we describe the cloning of a UDP-galactose: beta-d-galactosyl-1,4-glucosylceramide alpha-1, 3-galactosyltransferase (iGb(3) synthase) from a rat placental cDNA expression library. iGb(3) synthase acts on lactosylceramide, LacCer (Galbeta1,4Glcbeta1Cer) to form iGb(3) (Galalpha1,3Galbeta1, 4Glcbeta1Cer) initiating the synthesis of the isoglobo-series of glycosphingolipids. The isolated cDNA encoded a predicted protein of 339 amino acids, which shows extensive homology (40-50% identity) to members of the ABO gene family that includes: murine alpha1, 3-galactosyltransferase, Forssman (Gb(5)) synthase, and the ABO glycosyltransferases. In contrast to the murine alpha1, 3-galactosyltransferase, iGb(3) synthase preferentially modifies glycolipids over glycoprotein substrates. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed a widespread tissue distribution of iGb(3) synthase RNA expression, with high levels observed in spleen, thymus, and skeletal muscle. As an indirect consequence of the expression cloning strategy used, we have been able to identify several potential glycolipid biosynthetic pathways where iGb(3) functions, including the globo- and isoglobo-series of glycolipids."
10854428,"Cloning of Gb3 synthase, the key enzyme in globo-series glycosphingolipid synthesis, predicts a family of alpha 1, 4-glycosyltransferases conserved in plants, insects, and mammals.",10.1074/jbc.M002630200,"We have cloned Gb(3) synthase, the key alpha1, 4-galactosyltransferase in globo-series glycosphingolipid (GSL) synthesis, via a phenotypic screen, which previously yielded iGb(3) synthase, the alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase required in isoglobo-series GSL (Keusch, J. J., Manzella, S. M., Nyame, K. A., Cummings, R. D., and Baenziger, J. U. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 33). Both transferases act on lactosylceramide, Galbeta1,4Glcbeta1Cer (LacCer), to produce Gb(3) (Galalpha1,4LacCer) or iGb(3) (Galalpha1, 3LacCer), respectively. GalNAc can be added sequentially to either Gb(3) or iGb(3) yielding globoside and Forssman from Gb(3), and isogloboside and isoForssman from iGb(3). Gb(3) synthase is not homologous to iGb(3) synthase but shows 43% identity to a human alpha1,4GlcNAc transferase that transfers a UDP-sugar in an alpha1, 4-linkage to a beta-linked Gal found in mucin. Extensive homology (35% identity) is also present between Gb(3) synthase and genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana, supporting conserved expression of an alpha1,4-glycosyltransferase, possibly Gb(3) synthase, throughout evolution. The isolated Gb(3) synthase cDNA encodes a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase of 360 amino acids. The highest tissue expression of Gb(3) synthase RNA is found in the kidney, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, and brain. Gb(3) glycolipid, also called P(k) antigen or CD77, is a known receptor for verotoxins. CHO cells that do not express Gb(3) and are resistant to verotoxin become susceptible to the toxin following transfection with Gb(3) synthase cDNA."
10873290,Synaptic modulation of neuronal coupling.,10.1006/cbir.1998.0386,"Electrotonic coupling among neurons in the vertebrate, and more specifically the mammalian, brain has now been demonstrated to exist in all major brain subdivisions and in the spinal cord. For many of these brain areas, recent studies have investigated the possibilities of modulation of that coupling by synaptically released transmitters and/or neuromodulators. Reviewed here is the evidence for coupling, the synaptically related factors that play roles in up- or downregulation of this type of intercellular interaction and, to the extent that they have been investigated, the intracellular mechanisms operative in changing the extent of coupled networks in the brain. The functional significance of coupling and its modulation is discussed for some of these areas."
10890912,Crystal structure of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic core and C-terminal domains: a model for viral DNA binding.,10.1073/pnas.150220297,"Insolubility of full-length HIV-1 integrase (IN) limited previous structure analyses to individual domains. By introducing five point mutations, we engineered a more soluble IN that allowed us to generate multidomain HIV-1 IN crystals. The first multidomain HIV-1 IN structure is reported. It incorporates the catalytic core and C-terminal domains (residues 52-288). The structure resolved to 2.8 A is a Y-shaped dimer. Within the dimer, the catalytic core domains form the only dimer interface, and the C-terminal domains are located 55 A apart. A 26-aa alpha-helix, alpha6, links the C-terminal domain to the catalytic core. A kink in one of the two alpha6 helices occurs near a known proteolytic site, suggesting that it may act as a flexible elbow to reorient the domains during the integration process. Two proteins that bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner are structurally homologous to the HIV-1 IN C-terminal domain, suggesting a similar protein-DNA interaction in which the IN C-terminal domain may serve to bind, bend, and orient viral DNA during integration. A strip of positively charged amino acids contributed by both monomers emerges from each active site of the dimer, suggesting a minimally dimeric platform for binding each viral DNA end. The crystal structure of the isolated catalytic core domain (residues 52-210), independently determined at 1.6-A resolution, is identical to the core domain within the two-domain 52-288 structure."
10908295,"CYP2C40, a unique arachidonic acid 16-hydroxylase, is the major CYP2C in murine intestinal tract.",10.1124/mol.58.2.279,"We recently identified five different murine CYP2C cDNAs from a murine cDNA library. When expressed in a bacterial cDNA expression system, all five recombinant proteins metabolized arachidonic acid but produced distinctly different profiles. In addition, some CYP2C mRNAs were found in extrahepatic tissues, as well as in liver. Immunoblots with an antibody raised against recombinant CYP2C38, which recognizes all five murine CYP2Cs, demonstrated that among extrahepatic tissues, colon and cecum contained the highest amount of CYP2Cs. The highest concentration of CYP2Cs occurred in cecum and colon (cecum >/= proximal colon >> distal colon), with lower levels in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that CYP2Cs were localized principally in epithelial cells and autonomic ganglia in gut and colon. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed mRNA using murine CYP2C-specific primers followed by cloning and sequencing identified CYP2C40 as the major CYP2C isoform expressed in murine intestinal tract. Recombinant CYP2C40 metabolized arachidonic acid in a regio- and stereospecific manner to 16(R)-HETE (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) as the major product. To our knowledge, CYP2C40 is the first enzyme known to produce primarily 16-HETE. We conclude that CYP2C40 is one of the major cytochrome P450 proteins in the mouse intestinal tract. In the light of vasoactive and anti-neutrophilic effects of 16-HETE, we hypothesize that CYP2C40 may play an important role in endogenous biological functions in intestine."
10913097,Role of the yiaR and yiaS genes of Escherichia coli in metabolism of endogenously formed L-xylulose.,10.1128/JB.182.16.4625-4627.2000,"Genes yiaP and yiaR of the yiaKLMNOPQRS cluster of Escherichia coli are required for the metabolism of the endogenously formed L-xylulose, whereas yiaS is required for this metabolism only in araD mutants. Like AraD, YiaS was shown to have L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase activity. Similarity of YiaR to several 3-epimerases suggested that this protein could catalyze the conversion of L-xylulose-5-phosphate into L-ribulose-5-phosphate, thus completing the pathway between L-xylulose and the general metabolism."
10937989,The complete atomic structure of the large ribosomal subunit at 2.4 A resolution.,10.1126/science.289.5481.905,"The large ribosomal subunit catalyzes peptide bond formation and binds initiation, termination, and elongation factors. We have determined the crystal structure of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui at 2.4 angstrom resolution, and it includes 2833 of the subunit's 3045 nucleotides and 27 of its 31 proteins. The domains of its RNAs all have irregular shapes and fit together in the ribosome like the pieces of a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle to form a large, monolithic structure. Proteins are abundant everywhere on its surface except in the active site where peptide bond formation occurs and where it contacts the small subunit. Most of the proteins stabilize the structure by interacting with several RNA domains, often using idiosyncratically folded extensions that reach into the subunit's interior."
10937990,The structural basis of ribosome activity in peptide bond synthesis.,10.1126/science.289.5481.920,"Using the atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and its complexes with two substrate analogs, we establish that the ribosome is a ribozyme and address the catalytic properties of its all-RNA active site. Both substrate analogs are contacted exclusively by conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) residues from domain V of 23S rRNA; there are no protein side-chain atoms closer than about 18 angstroms to the peptide bond being synthesized. The mechanism of peptide bond synthesis appears to resemble the reverse of the acylation step in serine proteases, with the base of A2486 (A2451 in Escherichia coli) playing the same general base role as histidine-57 in chymotrypsin. The unusual pK(a) (where K(a) is the acid dissociation constant) required for A2486 to perform this function may derive in part from its hydrogen bonding to G2482 (G2447 in E. coli), which also interacts with a buried phosphate that could stabilize unusual tautomers of these two bases. The polypeptide exit tunnel is largely formed by RNA but has significant contributions from proteins L4, L22, and L39e, and its exit is encircled by proteins L19, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e."
10938271,Phosphatidylserine synthase-1 and -2 are localized to mitochondria-associated membranes.,10.1074/jbc.M002865200,"We report the subcellular localization of enzymes involved in phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in mammalian cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that phosphatidylserine synthase-1 (PSS1) is highly enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) and is largely excluded from the bulk of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Taking advantage of the substrate specificity of PSS1, we showed that (i) MAM contain choline exchange activity, whereas this activity is very low in the bulk of the ER, (ii) serine exchange activity is inhibited by choline to a much greater extent in MAM than in ER, and (iii) MAM use phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as substrates for phosphatidylserine biosynthesis, whereas the ER utilizes only phosphatidylethanolamine. According to immunoblotting of proteins from both CHO-K1 cells and murine liver, PSS1 is localized to MAM, and in hepatoma cells stably expressing PSS1 this protein is highly enriched in MAM. Since the ER contains serine and ethanolamine exchange activities, we had predicted that PSS2 would account for the serine exchange activity in the ER. Unexpectedly, using immunoblotting experiments, we found that (i) PSS2 of CHO-K1 cells is present only in MAM and (ii) PSS2 is restricted to MAM of McArdle cells expressing recombinant PSS2. These data leave open the question of which enzyme imparts PSS activity to the ER and suggest that a third isoform of PSS might be located in the ER."
10978320,"The splicing factor, Prp40, binds the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.",10.1074/jbc.M004118200,"We showed previously that the WW domain of the prolyl isomerase, Ess1, can bind the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain (phospho-CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II. Analysis of phospho-CTD binding by four other WW domain-containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins indicates the splicing factor, Prp40, and the RNA polymerase II ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, can also bind the phospho-CTD. The identification of Prp40 as a phospho-CTD binding protein represents the first demonstration of direct interaction between a documented splicing factor and the phospho-CTD. Domain dissection studies reveal that phospho-CTD binding occurs at multiple locations in Prp40, including sites in both the WW and FF domain regions. Because the conserved repeats of the CTD make it an ideal ligand for multi-site binding events, the implications of multi-site binding are discussed. Our data suggest a mechanism by which the phospho-CTD of elongating RNA polymerase II facilitates commitment complex formation by juxtaposing the 5' and 3' splice sites."
10978349,Novel beta -hydroxyacid dehydrogenases in Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae.,10.1074/jbc.M007432200,"Our laboratory has previously reported a structurally and mechanistically related family of beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases with significant homology to beta-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase. A large number of the members of this family are hypothetical proteins of bacterial origin with unknown identity in terms of their substrate specificities and metabolic roles. The Escherichia coli beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologue corresponding to the locus was cloned and expressed with a 6-histidine tag for specific purification. The purified recombinant protein very specifically catalyzed the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of d-glycerate and the NADH-dependent reduction of tartronate semialdehyde, identifying this protein as a tartronate semialdehyde reductase. Further evidence for identification as tartronate semialdehyde reductase is the observation that the coding region for this protein is directly preceded by genes coding for hydroxypyruvate isomerase and glyoxylate carboligase, two enzymes that synthesize tartronate semialdehyde, producing an operon clearly designed for d-glycerate biosynthesis from tartronate semialdehyde. The single beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologue from Haemophilus influenzae was also cloned, expressed, and purified with a 6-histidine tag. This protein also catalyzed the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of d-glycerate but was significantly more efficient in the oxidation of four-carbon beta-hydroxyacids like d-hydroxybutyrate and d-threonine. This enzyme differs from all the presently known beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases which are well established members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily."
10986234,Purine catabolism in Escherichia coli and function of xanthine dehydrogenase in purine salvage.,10.1128/JB.182.19.5332-5341.2000,"Escherichia coli is not known to utilize purines, other than adenine and adenosine, as nitrogen sources. We reinvestigated purine catabolism because a computer analysis suggested several potential sigma(54)-dependent promoters within a 23-gene cluster whose products have homology to purine catabolic enzymes. Our results did not provide conclusive evidence that the sigma(54)-dependent promoters are active. Nonetheless, our results suggest that some of the genes are metabolically significant. We found that even though several purines did not support growth as the sole nitrogen source, they did stimulate growth with aspartate as the nitrogen source. Cells produced (14)CO(2) from minimal medium containing [(14)C]adenine, which implies allantoin production. However, neither ammonia nor carbamoyl phosphate was produced, which implies that purine catabolism is incomplete and does not provide nitrogen during nitrogen-limited growth. We constructed strains with deletions of two genes whose products might catalyze the first reaction of purine catabolism. Deletion of one eliminated (14)CO(2) production from [(14)C]adenine, which implies that its product is necessary for xanthine dehydrogenase activity. We changed the name of this gene to xdhA. The xdhA mutant grew faster with aspartate as a nitrogen source. The mutant also exhibited sensitivity to adenine, which guanosine partially reversed. Adenine sensitivity has been previously associated with defective purine salvage resulting from impaired synthesis of guanine nucleotides from adenine. We propose that xanthine dehydrogenase contributes to this purine interconversion."
10998348,Human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoforms (AKR1C1-AKR1C4) of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily: functional plasticity and tissue distribution reveals roles in the inactivation and formation of male and female sex hormones.,10.1042/0264-6021:3510067,"The kinetic parameters, steroid substrate specificity and identities of reaction products were determined for four homogeneous recombinant human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD) isoforms of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. The enzymes correspond to type 1 3alpha-HSD (AKR1C4), type 2 3alpha(17beta)-HSD (AKR1C3), type 3 3alpha-HSD (AKR1C2) and 20alpha(3alpha)-HSD (AKR1C1), and share at least 84% amino acid sequence identity. All enzymes acted as NAD(P)(H)-dependent 3-, 17- and 20-ketosteroid reductases and as 3alpha-, 17beta- and 20alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidases. The functional plasticity of these isoforms highlights their ability to modulate the levels of active androgens, oestrogens and progestins. Salient features were that AKR1C4 was the most catalytically efficient, with k(cat)/K(m) values for substrates that exceeded those obtained with other isoforms by 10-30-fold. In the reduction direction, all isoforms inactivated 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-3-one; 5alpha-DHT) to yield 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-androstanediol). However, only AKR1C3 reduced Delta(4)-androstene-3,17-dione to produce significant amounts of testosterone. All isoforms reduced oestrone to 17beta-oestradiol, and progesterone to 20alpha-hydroxy-pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (20alpha-hydroxyprogesterone). In the oxidation direction, only AKR1C2 converted 3alpha-androstanediol to the active hormone 5alpha-DHT. AKR1C3 and AKR1C4 oxidized testosterone to Delta(4)-androstene-3,17-dione. All isoforms oxidized 17beta-oestradiol to oestrone, and 20alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to progesterone. Discrete tissue distribution of these AKR1C enzymes was observed using isoform-specific reverse transcriptase-PCR. AKR1C4 was virtually liver-specific and its high k(cat)/K(m) allows this enzyme to form 5alpha/5beta-tetrahydrosteroids robustly. AKR1C3 was most prominent in the prostate and mammary glands. The ability of AKR1C3 to interconvert testosterone with Delta(4)-androstene-3,17-dione, but to inactivate 5alpha-DHT, is consistent with this enzyme eliminating active androgens from the prostate. In the mammary gland, AKR1C3 will convert Delta(4)-androstene-3,17-dione to testosterone (a substrate aromatizable to 17beta-oestradiol), oestrone to 17beta-oestradiol, and progesterone to 20alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and this concerted reductive activity may yield a pro-oesterogenic state. AKR1C3 is also the dominant form in the uterus and is responsible for the synthesis of 3alpha-androstanediol which has been implicated as a parturition hormone. The major isoforms in the brain, capable of synthesizing anxiolytic steroids, are AKR1C1 and AKR1C2. These studies are in stark contrast with those in rat where only a single AKR with positional- and stereo-specificity for 3alpha-hydroxysteroids exists."
11001063,Peptide cyclization catalysed by the thioesterase domain of tyrocidine synthetase.,10.1038/35025116,"In the biosynthesis of many macrocyclic natural products by multidomain megasynthases, a carboxy-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain is involved in cyclization and product release; however, it has not been determined whether TE domains can catalyse macrocyclization (and elongation in the case of symmetric cyclic peptides) independently of upstream domains. The inability to decouple the TE cyclization step from earlier chain assembly steps has precluded determination of TE substrate specificity, which is important for the engineered biosynthesis of new compounds. Here we report that the excised TE domain from tyrocidine synthetase efficiently catalyses cyclization of a decapeptide-thioester to form the antibiotic tyrocidine A, and can catalyse pentapeptide-thioester dimerization followed by cyclization to form the antibiotic gramicidin S. By systematically varying the decapeptide-thioester substrate and comparing cyclization rates, we also show that only two residues (one near each end of the decapeptide) are critical for cyclization. This specificity profile indicates that the tyrocidine synthetase TE, and by analogy many other TE domains, will be able to cyclize and release a broad range of new substrates and products produced by engineered enzymatic assembly lines."
11004450,Electron transfer during the oxidation of ammonia by the chemolithotrophic bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea.,10.1016/s0005-2728(00)00171-7,"The combined action of ammonia monooxygenase, AMO, (NH(3)+2e(-)+O(2)-->NH(2)OH) and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, HAO, (NH(2)OH+H(2)O-->HNO(2)+4e(-)+4H(+)) accounts for ammonia oxidation in Nitrosomonas europaea. Pathways for electrons from HAO to O(2), nitrite, NO, H(2)O(2) or AMO are reviewed and some recent advances described. The membrane cytochrome c(M)552 is proposed to participate in the path between HAO and ubiquinone. A bc(1) complex is shown to mediate between ubiquinol and the terminal oxidase and is shown to be downstream of HAO. A novel, red, low-potential, periplasmic copper protein, nitrosocyanin, is introduced. Possible mechanisms for the inhibition of ammonia oxidation in cells by protonophores are summarized. Genes for nitrite- and NO-reductase but not N(2)O or nitrate reductase are present in the genome of Nitrosomonas. Nitrite reductase is not repressed by growth on O(2); the flux of nitrite reduction is controlled at the substrate level."
11014182,Structure of the 30S ribosomal subunit.,10.1038/35030006,"Genetic information encoded in messenger RNA is translated into protein by the ribosome, which is a large nucleoprotein complex comprising two subunits, denoted 30S and 50S in bacteria. Here we report the crystal structure of the 30S subunit from Thermus thermophilus, refined to 3 A resolution. The final atomic model rationalizes over four decades of biochemical data on the ribosome, and provides a wealth of information about RNA and protein structure, protein-RNA interactions and ribosome assembly. It is also a structural basis for analysis of the functions of the 30S subunit, such as decoding, and for understanding the action of antibiotics. The structure will facilitate the interpretation in molecular terms of lower resolution structural data on several functional states of the ribosome from electron microscopy and crystallography."
11014183,Functional insights from the structure of the 30S ribosomal subunit and its interactions with antibiotics.,10.1038/35030019,"The 30S ribosomal subunit has two primary functions in protein synthesis. It discriminates against aminoacyl transfer RNAs that do not match the codon of messenger RNA, thereby ensuring accuracy in translation of the genetic message in a process called decoding. Also, it works with the 50S subunit to move the tRNAs and associated mRNA by precisely one codon, in a process called translocation. Here we describe the functional implications of the high-resolution 30S crystal structure presented in the accompanying paper, and infer details of the interactions between the 30S subunit and its tRNA and mRNA ligands. We also describe the crystal structure of the 30S subunit complexed with the antibiotics paromomycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin, which interfere with decoding and translocation. This work reveals the structural basis for the action of these antibiotics, and leads to a model for the role of the universally conserved 16S RNA residues A1492 and A1493 in the decoding process."
11015622,Role of platelet-activating factor in cardiovascular pathophysiology.,10.1152/physrev.2000.80.4.1669,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid mediator that belongs to a family of biologically active, structurally related alkyl phosphoglycerides. PAF acts via a specific receptor that is coupled with a G protein, which activates a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. In this review we focus on the aspects that are more relevant for the cell biology of the cardiovascular system. The in vitro studies provided evidence for a role of PAF both as intercellular and intracellular messenger involved in cell-to-cell communication. In the cardiovascular system, PAF may have a role in embryogenesis because it stimulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis and may affect cardiac function because it exhibits mechanical and electrophysiological actions on cardiomyocytes. Moreover, PAF may contribute to modulation of blood pressure mainly by affecting the renal vascular circulation. In pathological conditions, PAF has been involved in the hypotension and cardiac dysfunctions occurring in various cardiovascular stress situations such as cardiac anaphylaxis and hemorrhagic, traumatic, and septic shock syndromes. In addition, experimental studies indicate that PAF has a critical role in the development of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Indeed, PAF cooperates in the recruitment of leukocytes in inflamed tissue by promoting adhesion to the endothelium and extravascular transmigration of leukocytes. The finding that human heart can produce PAF, expresses PAF receptor, and is sensitive to the negative inotropic action of PAF suggests that this mediator may have a role also in human cardiovascular pathophysiology."

This catecholate siderophore was only known from two other myxobacteria. The biosynthetic genes of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid are located in the cluster (mxcC-mxcF). Two molecules of 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid are activated and condensed with lysine in a unique way by a protein homologous to nonribosomal peptide synthetases (MxcG). Inactivation of mxcG, which encodes an adenylation domain for lysine, results in a myxochelin negative mutant unable to grow under iron-limiting conditions. Growth could be restored by adding Fe3+, myxochelin A or B to the medium. Inactivation of mxcD leads to the same phenotype. A new type of reductive release from nonribosomal peptide synthetases of the 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid bis-amide of lysine from MxcG, catalyzed by a protein domain with homology to NAD(P) binding sites, is discussed. The product of a gene, encoding a protein similar to glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutases (mxcL), is assumed to transaminate the aldehyde that is proposed as an intermediate. Further genes encoding proteins homologous to typical iron utilization and iron uptake polypeptides are reported."
11030741,"Keratan sulfate: structure, biosynthesis, and function.",10.1093/glycob/10.10.951,"The last 5 years have seen a marked increase in research on keratan sulfate (KS) and a concomitant increase in our understanding of the range of molecules that carry this adaptable polysaccharide. More than 15 KS-linked proteins have been identified and many of the genes encoding these have been cloned. KS-containing molecules have been identified in numerous epithelial and neural tissues in which KS expression responds to embryonic development, physiological variations, and to wound healing. A corneal cell culture system has been developed in which long-term KS biosynthesis is maintained. Progress has been made toward identification of the glycosyl- and sulfotransferases responsible for KS biosynthesis. A mouse knockout of a corneal KS-proteoglycan has provided the first experimental support for the role of KS in corneal transparency. Evidence has also been presented supporting functional roles of KS in cellular recognition of protein ligands, axonal guidance, cell motility, and in embryo implantation. These findings have served to expand the concept of what keratan sulfate is and the potential roles it may play in the cellular biology of diverse tissues."
11035791,Deoxysugars in glycopeptide antibiotics: enzymatic synthesis of TDP-L-epivancosamine in chloroeremomycin biosynthesis.,10.1073/pnas.210395097,"The 2,3,6-trideoxysugar l-epivancosamine is the terminal sugar added to the aglycone scaffold in chloroeremomycin, a member of the vancomycin family of glycopeptide antibiotics. Five proteins from the chloroeremomycin biosynthetic cluster, ORF14 and ORF23 to ORF26, have been expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity, and each has been characterized for an enzymatic activity. These five enzymes reconstitute the complete biosynthesis of TDP-l-epivancosamine from TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose. This process involves C-2 deoxygenation, C-3 amination and methylation, C-5 epimerization, and C-4 ketoreduction. Intermediates and the final product of this pathway have been identified by mass spectrometry and NMR. The pathway established here represents the complete in vitro reconstitution of an unusual sugar for an important class of antibiotics and sets the groundwork for future combinatorial biosynthesis for new bioactive compounds."
11045400,New insights into the pathogenesis of renal tubular acidosis--from functional to molecular studies.,10.1007/s004670000407,"The diagnosis and classification of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) have traditionally been made on the basis of functional studies. On these grounds, RTA has been separated into three main categories: (1) proximal RTA, or type 2; (2) distal RTA, or type 1; and (3) hyperkalemic RTA, or type 4. In recent years significant advances have been made in our understanding of the subcellular mechanisms involved in renal bicarbonate (HCO3-) and H+ transport. Application of molecular biology techniques has also opened a completely new perspective to the understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited cases of RTA. Mutations in the gene SLC4A4, encoding Na+-HCO3- cotransporter (NBC-1), have been found in proximal RTA with ocular abnormalities; in the gene SLC4A1, encoding Cl(-)-HCO3- exchanger (AE1), in autosomal dominant distal RTA; in the gene ATP6B1, encoding B1 subunit of H+-ATPase, in autosomal recessive distal RTA with sensorineural deafness; and in the gene CA2, encoding carbonic anhydrase II, in autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. Syndromes of aldosterone resistance have been also characterized molecularly and mutations in the gene MLR, encoding mineralocorticoid receptor, and in the genes SNCC1A, SNCC1B, and SCNN1G, encoding subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel, have been found in dominant and recessive forms of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, respectively. It can be concluded that, although functional studies are still necessary, a new molecular era in the understanding of disorders of renal acidification has arrived."

The antitumor drug bleomycin (BLM) is a natural hybrid peptide-polyketide metabolite, the biosynthesis of which provides an excellent opportunity to investigate intermodular communication between NRPS and PKS modules. Here, we report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the BLM biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003."

11067870,The bile acid synthetic gene 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase is mutated in progressive intrahepatic cholestasis.,10.1172/JCI10902,"We used expression cloning to isolate cDNAs encoding a microsomal 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase (C(27) 3beta-HSD) that is expressed predominantly in the liver. The predicted product shares 34% sequence identity with the C(19) and C(21) 3beta-HSD enzymes, which participate in steroid hormone metabolism. When transfected into cultured cells, the cloned C(27) 3beta-HSD cDNA encodes an enzyme that is active against four 7alpha-hydroxylated sterols, indicating that a single C(27) 3beta-HSD enzyme can participate in all known pathways of bile acid synthesis. The expressed enzyme did not metabolize several different C(19/21) steroids as substrates. The levels of hepatic C(27) 3beta-HSD mRNA in the mouse are not sexually dimorphic and do not change in response to dietary cholesterol or to changes in bile acid pool size. The corresponding human gene on chromosome 16p11.2-12 contains six exons and spans 3 kb of DNA, and we identified a 2-bp deletion in the C27 3beta-HSD gene of a patient with neonatal progressive intrahepatic cholestasis. This mutation eliminates the activity of the enzyme in transfected cells. These findings establish the central role of C(27) 3beta-HSD in the biosynthesis of bile acids and provide molecular tools for the diagnosis of a third type of neonatal progressive intrahepatic cholestasis associated with impaired bile acid synthesis."
11073455,Aureusidin synthase: a polyphenol oxidase homolog responsible for flower coloration.,10.1126/science.290.5494.1163,"Aurones are plant flavonoids that provide yellow color to the flowers of some popular ornamental plants, such as snapdragon and cosmos. In this study, we have identified an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of aurone from chalcones in the yellow snapdragon flower. The enzyme (aureusidin synthase) is a 39-kilodalton, copper-containing glycoprotein catalyzing the hydroxylation and/or oxidative cyclization of the precursor chalcones, 2',4',6',4-tetrahydroxychalcone and 2',4',6',3,4-pentahydroxychalcone. The complementary DNA encoding aureusidin synthase is expressed in the petals of aurone-containing varieties. DNA sequence analysis revealed that aureusidin synthase belongs to the plant polyphenol oxidase family, providing an unequivocal example of the function of the polyphenol oxidase homolog in plants, i.e., flower coloration."

Taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase (Tpa) catalyses the initial metabolic reaction yielding alanine and sulfoacetaldehyde. We purified Tpa 72-fold to apparent homogeneity with an overall yield of 89%. The purified enzyme did not require addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, but highly active enzyme was only obtained by addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to all buffers during purification. SDS/PAGE revealed a single protein band with a molecular mass of 51 kDa. The apparent molecular mass of the native enzyme was 197 kDa as determined by gel filtration, which indicates a homotetrameric structure. The kinetic constants for taurine were: Km = 7.1 mM, Vmax = 1.20 nmol.s-1, and for pyruvate: Km = 0.82 mM, Vmax = 0.17 nmol.s-1. The purified enzyme was able to transaminate hypotaurine (2-aminosulfinate), taurine, beta-alanine and with low activity cysteine and 3-aminopropanesulfonate. In addition to pyruvate, 2-ketobutyrate and oxaloacetate were utilized as amino group acceptors. We have sequenced the encoding gene (tpa). It encoded a 50-kDa peptide, which revealed 33% identity to diaminopelargonate aminotransferase from Bacillus subtilis."
11097910,Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene by a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture.,10.1128/AEM.66.12.5329-5333.2000,"Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene was investigated with a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture. Metabolite analyses revealed two groups of degradation products. The first group comprised two succinic acid adducts which were identified as naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid and naphthyl-2-methylene-succinic acid by comparison with chemically synthesized reference compounds. Naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid accumulated to 0.5 microM in culture supernatants. Production of naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid was analyzed in enzyme assays with dense cell suspensions. The conversion of 2-methylnaphthalene to naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid was detected at a specific activity of 0.020 +/- 0.003 nmol min(-1) mg of protein(-1) only in the presence of cells and fumarate. We conclude that under anaerobic conditions 2-methylnaphthalene is activated by fumarate addition to the methyl group, as is the case in anaerobic toluene degradation. The second group of metabolites comprised 2-naphthoic acid and reduced 2-naphthoic acid derivatives, including 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, octahydro-2-naphthoic acid, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid. These compounds were also identified in an earlier study as products of anaerobic naphthalene degradation with the same enrichment culture. A pathway for anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene analogous to that for anaerobic toluene degradation is proposed."
11106389,An herbivore elicitor activates the gene for indole emission in maize.,10.1073/pnas.260499897,"Maize and a variety of other plant species release volatile compounds in response to herbivore attack that serve as chemical cues to signal natural enemies of the feeding herbivore. N-(17-hydroxylinolenoyl)-l-glutamine is an elicitor component that has been isolated and chemically characterized from the regurgitant of the herbivore-pest beet armyworm. This fatty acid derivative, referred to as volicitin, triggers the synthesis and release of volatile components, including terpenoids and indole in maize. Here we report on a previously unidentified enzyme, indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase (IGL), that catalyzes the formation of free indole and is selectively activated by volicitin. IGL's enzymatic properties are similar to BX1, a maize enzyme that serves as the entry point to the secondary defense metabolites DIBOA and DIMBOA. Gene-sequence analysis indicates that Igl and Bx1 are evolutionarily related to the tryptophan synthase alpha subunit."
11112537,Vibriobactin biosynthesis in Vibrio cholerae: VibH is an amide synthase homologous to nonribosomal peptide synthetase condensation domains.,10.1021/bi001651a,"The Vibrio cholerae siderophore vibriobactin is biosynthesized from three molecules of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB), two molecules of L-threonine, and one of norspermidine. Of the four genes positively implicated in vibriobactin biosynthesis, we have here expressed, purified, and assayed the products of three: vibE, vibB, and vibH. All three are homologous to nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains: VibE is a 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate-adenosyl monophosphate ligase, VibB is a bifunctional isochorismate lyase-aryl carrier protein (ArCP), and VibH is a novel amide synthase that represents a free-standing condensation (C) domain. VibE and VibB are homologous to EntE and EntB from Escherichia coli enterobactin synthetase; VibE activates DHB as the acyl adenylate and then transfers it to the free thiol of the phosphopantetheine arm of VibB's ArCP domain. VibH then condenses this DHB thioester (the donor) with the small molecule norspermidine (the acceptor), forming N(1)-(2, 3-dihydroxybenzoyl)norspermidine (DHB-NSPD) with a k(cat) of 600 min(-1) and a K(m) for acyl-VibB of 0.88 microM and for norspermidine of 1.5 mM. Exclusive monoacylation of a primary amine of norspermidine was observed. VibH also tolerates DHB-acylated EntB and 1,7-diaminoheptane, octylamine, and hexylamine as substrates, albeit at lowered catalytic efficiencies. DHB-NSPD possesses one of three acylations required for mature vibriobactin, and its formation confirms VibH's role in vibriobactin biosynthesis. VibH is a unique NRPS condensation domain that acts upon an upstream carrier-protein-bound donor and a downstream amine, turning over a soluble amide product, in contrast to an archetypal NRPS-embedded C domain that condenses two carrier protein thioesters."
11158445,"Mutational analysis of genes involved in pilus structure, motility and transformation competency in the unicellular motile cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.",10.1093/pcp/pce007,"The relevance of pilus-related genes to motility, pilus structure on the cell surface and competency of natural transformation was studied by gene disruption analysis in the unicellular motile cyanobacterium Synechocystis: sp. PCC 6803. The genes disrupted in this study were chosen as related to the pil genes for biogenesis of the type IV pili in a Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was found that motility of Synechocystis cells was lost in the mutants of slr0063, slr1274, slr1275, slr1276, slr1277 and sll1694 together with a simultaneous loss of the thick pili on the cell surface. Competency of the natural transformation was lost in the mutants listed above and slr0197-disruptant. The gene slr0197 was previously predicted as a competence gene by a search with sequence-independent DNA-binding structure [Yura et al. (1999) DNA Res. 6: 75]. It was suggested that both DNA uptake for natural transformation and motility are mediated by a specific type IV-like pilus structure, while a putative DNA-binding protein encoded by slr0197 is additionally required for the DNA uptake. Based on the homology with the pil genes in P: aeruginosa, slr0063, slr1274, slr1275, slr1276, slr1277 and sll1694 were designated pilB1, pilM, pilN, pilO, pilQ and pilA1, respectively. The gene slr0197 was designated comA."
11162800,Combined results from solution studies on intact influenza virus M1 protein and from a new crystal form of its N-terminal domain show that M1 is an elongated monomer.,10.1006/viro.2000.0727,"The amino-terminal domain of influenza A virus matrix protein (residues 1-164) was crystallized at pH 7 into a new crystal form in space group P1. This packing of the protein implies that M1(1-164) was monomeric in solution when it crystallized. Otherwise, the structure of the M1 fragment in the pH 7 crystals was the same as the monomers in crystals formed at pH 4 where crystal packing resulted in dimer formation [B. Sha and M. Luo, 1997, Nature Struct. Biol. 4, 239-244]. Analysis of intact M1 protein, the N-terminal domain, and the remaining C-terminal fragment (residues 165-252) in solution also showed that the N-terminal domain was monomeric with the same dimensions as determined from the crystal structure. Intact M1 protein was also monomeric but with an elongated shape due to the presence of the C-terminal part. Circular dichroism showed that the C-terminal part of M1 contained helical structure. A model for soluble M1 is presented, based on the assumption that the C-terminal domain is spherical, in which the N- and C-terminal domains are connected by a linker sequence which is available for proteolytic attack."
11165748,Thyroid cancer.,10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00697-2,"Four types of thyroid cancer comprise more than 98% of all thyroid malignancies. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may have a very benign course while undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) belongs to the most aggressive human malignancies. A variety of genes have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. Somatic Ras mutations seem to be an early event and are frequently found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. Germline RET missense mutations lead to hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast, the significance of somatic RET mutations in sporadic MTC is unknown. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma. The precise role of PTEN remains to be elucidated. The only clearly identified exogenous factor that may lead to thyroid carcinoma (mainly PTC) is radiation. Of interest, radiation is capable to induce RET rearrangements. In general, early diagnosis is mandatory to enable the chance of cure. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the tumour type, surgery in combination with either radioiodine, external radiation or chemotherapy often enables the control of local tumour burden. In MTC and UTC, once thyroid cancer is spread to distant organs, efficacious therapeutic agents are almost non-existing. However, our growing knowledge of genes involved in thyroidal oncogenesis may contribute to the development of more effective treatment modalities. Some preliminary data on gene therapy are quite promising."
11171088,"The 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) oxidase activity of human tyrosinase.",10.1042/0264-6021:3540131,"Melanin synthesis in mammals is catalysed by at least three enzymic proteins, tyrosinase (monophenol dihydroxyphenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.18.1) and tyrosinase-related proteins (tyrps) 1 and 2, whose genes map to the albino, brown and slaty loci in mice, respectively. Tyrosinase catalyses the rate-limiting generation of L-dopaquinone from L-tyrosine and is also able to oxidize L-dopa to L-dopaquinone. Conversely, mouse tyrp1, but not tyrosinase, catalyses the oxidation of the indolic intermediate 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) into the corresponding 5,6-indolequinone-2-carboxylic acid, thus promoting the incorporation of DHICA units into eumelanin. The catalytic activities of the human melanogenic enzymes are still debated. TYRP1 has been reported to lack DHICA oxidase activity, whereas tyrosinase appears to accelerate DHICA consumption, thus raising the question of DHICA metabolism in human melanocytes. Here we have used two different approaches, comparison of the catalytic activities of human melanocytic cell lines expressing the full set of melanogenic enzymes or deficient in TYRP1, and transient expression of TYR and tyr genes in COS7 cells, to demonstrate that human tyrosinase actually functions as a DHICA oxidase, as opposed to the mouse enzyme. Therefore, human tyrosinase displays a broader substrate specificity than its mouse counterpart, and might be at least partially responsible for the incorporation of DHICA units into human eumelanins."
11217865,Crystal structure of photosystem II from Synechococcus elongatus at 3.8 A resolution.,10.1038/35055589,"Oxygenic photosynthesis is the principal energy converter on earth. It is driven by photosystems I and II, two large protein-cofactor complexes located in the thylakoid membrane and acting in series. In photosystem II, water is oxidized; this event provides the overall process with the necessary electrons and protons, and the atmosphere with oxygen. To date, structural information on the architecture of the complex has been provided by electron microscopy of intact, active photosystem II at 15-30 A resolution, and by electron crystallography on two-dimensional crystals of D1-D2-CP47 photosystem II fragments without water oxidizing activity at 8 A resolution. Here we describe the X-ray structure of photosystem II on the basis of crystals fully active in water oxidation. The structure shows how protein subunits and cofactors are spatially organized. The larger subunits are assigned and the locations and orientations of the cofactors are defined. We also provide new information on the position, size and shape of the manganese cluster, which catalyzes water oxidation."
11250910,Crystal structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in complex with a polypurine tract RNA:DNA.,10.1093/emboj/20.6.1449,"We have determined the 3.0 A resolution structure of wild-type HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in complex with an RNA:DNA oligonucleotide whose sequence includes a purine-rich segment from the HIV-1 genome called the polypurine tract (PPT). The PPT is resistant to ribonuclease H (RNase H) cleavage and is used as a primer for second DNA strand synthesis. The 'RNase H primer grip', consisting of amino acids that interact with the DNA primer strand, may contribute to RNase H catalysis and cleavage specificity. Cleavage specificity is also controlled by the width of the minor groove and the trajectory of the RNA:DNA, both of which are sequence dependent. An unusual 'unzipping' of 7 bp occurs in the adenine stretch of the PPT: an unpaired base on the template strand takes the base pairing out of register and then, following two offset base pairs, an unpaired base on the primer strand re-establishes the normal register. The structural aberration extends to the RNase H active site and may play a role in the resistance of PPT to RNase H cleavage."

Recent modelling experiments in mice are helping to delineate the molecular aetiology of this disease and are providing systems to identify and test novel and rational therapeutic strategies."
11274177,Characterization of the D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase involved in the biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate.,10.1074/jbc.M011783200,"The murine gene for the glucuronyl C5-epimerase involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis was cloned, using a previously isolated bovine lung cDNA fragment (Li, J.-P., Hagner-McWhirter, A., Kjellén, L., Palgi, J., Jalkanen, M., and Lindahl, U. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28158-28163) as probe. The approximately 11-kilobase pair mouse gene contains 3 exons from the first ATG to stop codon and is localized to chromosome 9. Southern analysis of the genomic DNA and chromosome mapping suggested the occurrence of a single epimerase gene. Based on the genomic sequence, a mouse liver cDNA was isolated that encodes a 618-amino acid residue protein, thus extending by 174 N-terminal residues the sequence deduced from the (incomplete) bovine cDNA. Comparison of murine, bovine, and human epimerase cDNA structures indicated 96-99% identity at the amino acid level. A cDNA identical to the mouse liver species was demonstrated in mouse mast cells committed to heparin biosynthesis. These findings suggest that the iduronic acid residues in heparin and heparan sulfate, despite different structural contexts, are generated by the same C5-epimerase enzyme. The catalytic activity of the recombinant full-length mouse liver epimerase, expressed in insect cells, was found to be >2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the previously cloned, smaller bovine recombinant protein. The approximately 52-kDa, similarly highly active, enzyme originally purified from bovine liver (Campbell, P., Hannesson, H. H., Sandbäck, D., Rodén, L., Lindahl, U., and Li, J.-P. (1994) J. Biol.

Here, we describe alg11, a new yeast glycosylation mutant that is defective in the last step of the synthesis of the Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol core oligosaccharide on the cytosolic face of the ER. A deletion of the ALG11 gene leads to poor growth and temperature-sensitive lethality. In an alg11 lesion, both Man(3)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol and Man(4)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol are translocated into the ER lumen as substrates for the Man-P-dolichol-dependent sugar transferases in this compartment. This leads to a unique family of oligosaccharide structures lacking one or both of the lower arm alpha1,2-linked Man residues. The former are elongated to mannan, whereas the latter are poor substrates for outerchain initiation by Ochlp (Nakayama, K.-I., Nakanishi-Shindo, Y., Tanaka, A., Haga-Toda, Y., and Jigami, Y. (1997) FEBS Lett. 412, 547-550) and accumulate largely as truncated biosynthetic end products. The ALG11 gene is predicted to encode a 63.1-kDa membrane protein that by indirect immunofluorescence resides in the ER. The Alg11 protein is highly conserved, with homologs in fission yeast, worms, flies, and plants. In addition to these Alg11-related proteins, Alg11p is also similar to Alg2p, a protein that regulates the addition of the third mannose to the core oligosaccharide. All of these Alg11-related proteins share a 23-amino acid sequence that is found in over 60 proteins from bacteria to man whose function is in sugar metabolism, implicating this sequence as a potential sugar nucleotide binding motif."

The gene for the responsible, membrane-bound glucosyltransferase (alMGS) (EC ) was sequenced and functionally cloned in Escherichia coli, yielding MGlcDAG in the recombinants. Similar amino acid sequences were encoded in the genomes of several Gram-positive bacteria (especially pathogens), thermophiles, archaea, and a few eukaryotes. All of these contained the typical EX(7)E catalytic motif of the CAZy family 4 of alpha-glycosyltransferases. The synthesis of MGlcDAG by a close sequence analog from Streptococcus pneumoniae (spMGS) was verified by polymerase chain reaction cloning, corroborating a connection between sequence and functional similarity for these proteins. However, alMGS and spMGS varied in dependence on anionic phospholipid activators phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, suggesting certain regulatory differences. Fold predictions strongly indicated a similarity for alMGS (and spMGS) with the two-domain structure of the E. coli MurG cell envelope glycosyltransferase and several amphipathic membrane-binding segments in various proteins. On the basis of this structure, the alMGS sequence charge distribution, and anionic phospholipid dependence, a model for the bilayer surface binding and activity is proposed for this regulatory enzyme."
11305904,Enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism: from modular to integrative signaling.,10.1021/bi002836k,"Many enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism are regulated in response to extra- and intracellular stimuli and in turn serve as regulators of levels of bioactive lipids (such as sphingosine, ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and diacylglycerol), and as such, they serve a prototypical modular function in cell regulation. However, lipid metabolism is also closely interconnected in that a product of one enzyme serves as a substrate for another. Moreover, many cell stimuli regulate more than one of these enzymes, thus adding to the complexity of regulation of lipid metabolism. In this paper, we review the status of enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism in cell regulation and propose a role for these enzymes in integration of cell responses, a role that builds on the modular organization while also taking advantage of the complexity and interconnectedness of lipid metabolism, thus providing for a combinatorial mechanism of generating diversity in cell responses. This may be a general prototype for the involvement of metabolic pathways in cell regulation."

Although cytokinin is an essential hormone for growth and development, the nature of the enzyme for its biosynthesis in higher plants has not been identified. Herein, we describe the molecular cloning and biochemical identification of IPTs from Arabidopsis thaliana. Eight cDNAs encoding putative IPT, designated as AtIPT1 to AtIPT8, were picked up from A. thaliana. The Escherichia coli transformants expressing the recombinant proteins excreted cytokinin species into the culture medium except for that expressing AtIPT2 that is a putative tRNA IPT. A purified recombinant AtIPT1 catalyzed the formation of iPMP from DMAPP and AMP. These results indicate that the small multigene family contains both types of isopentenyltransferase, which could synthesize cytokinin and mature tRNA."
11320055,Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan.,10.1093/glycob/11.3.25r,"The main structural features of bacterial peptidoglycan are linear glycan chains interlinked by short peptides. The glycan chains are composed of alternating units of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), all linkages between sugars being beta,1-->4. On the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, two types of activities are involved in the polymerization of the peptidoglycan monomer unit: glycosyltransferases that catalyze the formation of the linear glycan chains and transpeptidases that catalyze the formation of the peptide cross-bridges. Contrary to the transpeptidation step, for which there is an abundant literature that has been regularly reviewed, the transglycosylation step has been studied to a far lesser extent. The aim of the present review is to summarize and evaluate the molecular and cellullar data concerning the formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. Early work concerned the use of various in vivo and in vitro systems for the study of the polymerization steps, the attachment of newly made material to preexisting peptidoglycan, and the mechanism of action of antibiotics. The synthesis of the glycan chains is catalyzed by the N-terminal glycosyltransferase module of class A high-molecular-mass penicillin-binding proteins and by nonpenicillin-binding monofunctional glycosyltransferases. The multiplicity of these activities in a given organism presumably reflects a variety of in vivo functions. The topological localization of the incorporation of nascent peptidoglycan into the cell wall has revealed that bacteria have at least two peptidoglycan-synthesizing systems: one for septation, the other one for elongation or cell wall thickening. Owing to its location on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane and its specificity, the transglycosylation step is an interesting target for antibacterials. Glycopeptides and moenomycins are the best studied antibiotics known to interfere with this step. Their mode of action and structure-activity relationships have been extensively studied. Attempts to synthesize other specific transglycosylation inhibitors have recently been made."
11322788,Isolation and characterization of the genes encoding a novel oxygenase component of angular dioxygenase from the gram-positive dibenzofuran-degrader Terrabacter sp. strain DBF63.,10.1006/bbrc.2001.4763,"A gram-positive bacterium Terrabacter sp. strain DBF63 is able to degrade dibenzofuran (DF) via initial dioxygenation by a novel angular dioxygenase. The dbfA1 and dbfA2 genes, which encode the large and small subunits of the dibenzofuran 4,4a-dioxygenase (DFDO), respectively, were isolated by a polymerase chain reaction-based method. DbfA1 and DbfA2 showed moderate homology to the large and small subunits of other ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (less than 40%), respectively, and some motifs such as the Fe(II) binding site and the [2Fe-2S] cluster ligands were conserved in DbfA1. DFDO activity was confirmed in Escherichia coli cells containing the cloned dbfA1 and dbfA2 genes with the complementation of nonspecific ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase component of E. coli. Under this condition, these cells exhibited angular dioxygenation of DF and dibenzo-p-dioxin, and monooxygenation of fluorene, but not angular dioxygenation of carbazole, xanthene, and phenoxathiin. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that DbfA1 formed a branch with recently reported large subunits of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dioxygenase from gram-positive bacteria but did not cluster with that of other angular dioxygenases, i.e., DxnA1 from Sphingomonas sp. strain RW1 [Armengaud, J., Happe, B., and Timmis, K. N. J. Bacteriol. 180, 3954-3966, 1998] and CarAa from Pseudomonas sp. strain CA10 [Sato, S., Nam, J.-W., Kasuga, K., Nojiri, H., Yamane, H., and Omori, T. J. Bacteriol. 179, 4850-4858, 1997]."

These antibiotics have been isolated from various Streptomyces species and all possess a 3-amino-4-hydroxy-coumarin moiety as their structural core. Prior labeling experiments on novobiocin established that the coumarin moiety was derived from L-tyrosine, probably via a beta-hydroxy-tyrosine (beta-OH-Tyr) intermediate. Recently the novobiocin gene cluster from Streptomyces spheroides was cloned and sequenced and allows analysis of the biosynthesis of the coumarin at the biochemical level using overexpressed and purified proteins."
11328810,"Cytochrome P450 CYP2J9, a new mouse arachidonic acid omega-1 hydroxylase predominantly expressed in brain.",10.1074/jbc.M100545200,"A cDNA encoding a new cytochrome P450 was isolated from a mouse brain library. Sequence analysis reveals that this 1,958-base pair cDNA encodes a 57-58-kDa 502-amino acid polypeptide that is 70-91% identical to CYP2J subfamily P450s and is designated CYP2J9. Recombinant CYP2J9 was co-expressed with NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR) in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus system. Microsomes of CYP2J9/CYPOR-transfected cells metabolize arachidonic acid to 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) thus CYP2J9 is enzymologically distinct from other P450s. Northern analysis reveals that CYP2J9 transcripts are present at high levels in mouse brain. Mouse brain microsomes biosynthesize 19-HETE. RNA polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrates that CYP2J9 mRNAs are widely distributed in brain and most abundant in the cerebellum. Immunoblotting using an antibody raised against human CYP2J2 that cross-reacts with CYP2J9 detects a 56-kDa protein band that is expressed in cerebellum and other brain segments and is regulated during postnatal development. In situ hybridization of mouse brain sections with a CYP2J9-specific riboprobe and immunohistochemical staining with the anti-human CYP2J2 IgG reveals abundant CYP2J9 mRNA and protein in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Importantly, 19-HETE inhibits the activity of recombinant P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels that are known to be expressed preferentially in cerebellar Purkinje cells and are involved in triggering neurotransmitter release. Based on these data, we conclude that CYP2J9 is a developmentally regulated P450 that is abundant in brain, localized to cerebellar Purkinje cells, and active in the biosynthesis of 19-HETE, an eicosanoid that inhibits activity of P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels. We postulate that CYP2J9 arachidonic acid products play important functional roles in the brain."
11337402,VARIATIONS IN THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF SEED-STORAGE LIPIDS.,10.1146/annurev.arplant.52.1.335,"In many plants lipids represent up to 80% of dry weight of storage tissues. In seeds, lipids accumulate as triacylglycerols (TAGs), which are formed by an extension of the membrane-lipid biosynthetic pathway common to all plant tissues. In contrast to the conserved fatty acid (FA) composition of membrane lipids, the observed divergence in seed oil acyl chains among different species is very high. The acyl groups of seed TAGs can vary in their chain length (from 8 to 24) as well as in their degree of unsaturation. In addition to methylene-interrupted double bonds, many seeds contain TAGs that have unusual functional groups in their FAs, such as hydroxyl, oxirane, or acetylene groups. All of the major steps in the biosynthetic pathway to TAG are now known and sequence information for genes encoding most of the enzymes involved is available. Here we present the current knowledge of the metabolic mechanisms involved in the divergence from the membrane-lipid biosynthetic pathway during storage lipid formation."

HSD from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was overproduced in Escherichia coli and 25 mg of soluble dimeric enzyme was purified per liter of cell culture in two steps. HSD efficiently reduces aspartate semialdehyde to homoserine (Hse) using either NADH or NADPH with kcat/Km in the order of 10(6-7) M(-1) x s(-1) at pH 7.5. The rate constant of the reverse direction (Hse oxidation) was also significant at pH 9.0 (kcat/Km approximately 10(4-5) M(-1) x s(-1)) but was minimal at pH 7.5. Chemical modification of HSD with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) resulted in a loss of activity that could be obviated by the presence of substrates. UV difference spectra revealed an increase in absorbance at 240 nm for DEPC-modified HSD consistent with the modification of two histidines (His) per subunit. Amino acid sequence alignment of HSD illustrated the conservation of two His residues among HSDs. These residues, His79 and His309, were substituted to alanine (Ala) using site directed mutagenesis. HSD H79A had similar steady state kinetics to wild type, while kcat/Km for HSD H309A decreased by almost two orders of magnitude. The recent determination of the X-ray structure of HSD revealed that His309 is located at the dimer interface [B. DeLaBarre, P.R. Thompson, G.D. Wright, A.M. Berghuis, Nat. Struct. Biol. 7 (2000) 238-244]. The His309Ala mutant enzyme was found in very high molecular weight complexes rather than the expected dimer by analytical gel filtration chromatography analysis. Thus the invariant His309 plays a structural rather than catalytic role in these enzymes."

11375157,Cloning and expression of the benzoate dioxygenase genes from Rhodococcus sp. strain 19070.,10.1128/AEM.67.6.2507-2514.2001,"The bopXYZ genes from the gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus sp. strain 19070 encode a broad-substrate-specific benzoate dioxygenase. Expression of the BopXY terminal oxygenase enabled Escherichia coli to convert benzoate or anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) to a nonaromatic cis-diol or catechol, respectively. This expression system also rapidly transformed m-toluate (3-methylbenzoate) to an unidentified product. In contrast, 2-chlorobenzoate was not a good substrate. The BopXYZ dioxygenase was homologous to the chromosomally encoded benzoate dioxygenase (BenABC) and the plasmid-encoded toluate dioxygenase (XylXYZ) of gram-negative acinetobacters and pseudomonads. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis failed to identify any plasmid in Rhodococcus sp. strain 19070. Catechol 1,2- and 2,3-dioxygenase activity indicated that strain 19070 possesses both meta- and ortho-cleavage degradative pathways, which are associated in pseudomonads with the xyl and ben genes, respectively. Open reading frames downstream of bopXYZ, designated bopL and bopK, resembled genes encoding cis-diol dehydrogenases and benzoate transporters, respectively. The bop genes were in the same order as the chromosomal ben genes of P. putida PRS2000. The deduced sequences of BopXY were 50 to 60% identical to the corresponding proteins of benzoate and toluate dioxygenases. The reductase components of these latter dioxygenases, BenC and XylZ, are 201 residues shorter than the deduced BopZ sequence. As predicted from the sequence, expression of BopZ in E. coli yielded an approximately 60-kDa protein whose presence corresponded to increased cytochrome c reductase activity. While the N-terminal region of BopZ was approximately 50% identical in sequence to the entire BenC or XylZ reductases, the C terminus was unlike other known protein sequences."
11375201,Biotransformation of D-limonene to (+) trans-carveol by toluene-grown Rhodococcus opacus PWD4 cells.,10.1128/AEM.67.6.2829-2832.2001,"The toluene-degrading strain Rhodococcus opacus PWD4 was found to hydroxylate D-limonene exclusively in the 6-position, yielding enantiomerically pure (+) trans-carveol and traces of (+) carvone. This biotransformation was studied using cells cultivated in chemostat culture with toluene as a carbon and energy source. The maximal specific activity of (+) trans-carveol formation was 14.7 U (g of cells [dry weight])(-1), and the final yield was 94 to 97%. Toluene was found to be a strong competitive inhibitor of the D-limonene conversion. Glucose-grown cells did not form any trans-carveol from D-limonene. These results suggest that one of the enzymes involved in toluene degradation is responsible for this allylic monohydroxylation. Another toluene degrader (Rhodococcus globerulus PWD8) had a lower specific activity but was found to oxidize most of the formed trans-carveol to (+) carvone, allowing for the biocatalytic production of this flavor compound."
11378299,Role of Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclases in LTP and memory formation.,10.1016/s0736-5748(00)00094-0,"Studies with invertebrates and vertebrates have strongly implicated the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway in long-term memory (LTM) and transcriptionally-dependent L-LTP. It is hypothesized that LTM and L-LTP are both dependent upon a Ca2+ signal generated through activation of NMDA receptors. This review discusses evidence that Ca2+ signals generated through activation of NMDA receptors coactivate the Erk/MAP kinase and cAMP signal transduction pathways. It is hypothesized that activation of these two regulatory pathways increases the transcription of a family of genes through the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway. Gene disruption studies have shown that Ca2+ activated adenylyl cyclases play a critical role in generating the cAMP signal required for LTM and L-LTP. Although cAMP may be required for several events in this complex signal transduction cascade, one of the major roles of cAMP may be to support nuclear translocation of Erk/MAP kinase in hippocampal neurons."

11390981,"Human tumor suppressor EXT gene family members EXTL1 and EXTL3 encode alpha 1,4- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases that likely are involved in heparan sulfate/ heparin biosynthesis.",10.1073/pnas.131188498,"The tumor suppressors EXT1 and EXT2 are associated with hereditary multiple exostoses and encode bifunctional glycosyltransferases essential for chain polymerization of heparan sulfate (HS) and its analog, heparin (Hep). Three highly homologous EXT-like genes, EXTL1-EXTL3, have been cloned, and EXTL2 is an alpha1,4-GlcNAc transferase I, the key enzyme that initiates the HS/Hep synthesis. In the present study, truncated forms of EXTL1 and EXTL3, lacking the putative NH2-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and found to harbor alpha-GlcNAc transferase activity. EXTL3 used not only N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides that represent growing HS chains but also GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-O-C2H4NH-benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), a synthetic substrate for alpha-GlcNAc transferase I that determines and initiates HS/Hep synthesis. In contrast, EXTL1 used only the former acceptor. Neither EXTL1 nor EXTL3 showed any glucuronyltransferase activity as examined with N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides. Heparitinase I digestion of each transferase-reaction product showed that GlcNAc had been transferred exclusively through an alpha1,4-configuration. Hence, EXTL3 most likely is involved in both chain initiation and elongation, whereas EXTL1 possibly is involved only in the chain elongation of HS and, maybe, Hep as well. Thus, their acceptor specificities of the five family members are overlapping but distinct from each other, except for EXT1 and EXT2 with the same specificity. It now has been clarified that all of the five cloned human EXT gene family proteins harbor glycosyltransferase activities, which probably contribute to the synthesis of HS and Hep."
11393735,"Extractionless method for the simultaneous high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of urinary caffeine metabolites for N-acetyltransferase 2, cytochrome P450 1A2 and xanthine oxidase activity assessment.",10.1016/s0378-4347(00)00616-2,"Urinary metabolic ratios of caffeine are used in humans to assess the enzymatic activities of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2), xanthine oxidase (XO) and for phenotyping individuals for the bimodal N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), all of them involved in the activation or detoxification of various xenobiotic compounds. Most reported analytical procedures for the measurement of the urinary metabolites of caffeine include a liquid-liquid extraction of urine samples prior to their analysis by reversed-phase HPLC. At neutral to basic pH however, 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU), a metabolite of caffeine, spontaneously decomposes to 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (AAMU). Since AAMU is not extracted in most organic solvents, the extent of AFMU decomposition cannot be precisely assessed. Although the decomposition reaction can be minimized by immediate acidification of the urine, accurate results can only be obtained when both AAMU and AFMU are monitored, or alternatively, if AAMU is measured after complete transformation of AFMU into AAMU in basic conditions. We report a liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of the five urinary metabolites of caffeine used for the CYP1A2, XO and NAT2 phenotyping studies: AAMU, AFMU, 1-methylxanthine, 1-methyluric acid and 1,7-dimethyluric acid. These metabolites are satisfactory separated from all other known caffeine metabolites as well as endogenous urinary constituents. Sample treatment does not require any liquid-liquid extraction procedure. Urine samples are diluted and centrifuged before being injected (10 microl) onto a YMC-Pack Polyamine II (250x4.6 mm) column. A step-wise gradient elution program is applied using acetonitrile-0.75% (v/v) formic acid: (91:9) at 0 min-->(75:25) at 25 min-->(65:35) at 35 min-->(65:35) at 45 min, followed by a re-equilibration step to the initial solvent composition. The flow-rate is 1.0 ml/min and the separations are monitored by UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. The procedure described here represents a substantial improvement over previous methods: a single analysis and a minimal urine sample treatment enables the simultaneous quantitation of five caffeine metabolites, notably AFMU and AAMU, used for the determination of CYP450 1A2, XO and NAT2 enzyme activity. Importantly enough, phenotyping individuals for the bimodal NAT2 is made possible without the uncertainty associated with the deformylation of AFMU, which is likely to happen at all steps prior to the analysis, during sample storage and even in the bladder of the subjects."
11396701,Iodine and thyroid autoimmune disease in animal models.,10.1089/105072501300176381,"Thyroid autoimmune diseases are complex, polygenic afflictions the penetrance of which is heavily dependent on various environmental influences. In their pathogenesis, an afferent stage (enhanced autoantigen presentation), a central stage (excessive expansion and maturation of autoreactive T and B cells), and an efferent stage (effects of autoreactive T cells and B cells on their targets) can be discerned. At each stage, a plethora of inborn, endogenous or exogenous factors is able to elicit the abnormalities characteristic of that stage, thus opening the gateway to thyroid autoimmunity. Iodine is an important exogenous modulating factor of the process. In general, iodine deficiency attenuates, while iodine excess accelerates autoimmune thyroiditis in autoimmune prone individuals. In nonautoimmune prone individuals, the effects of iodine are different. Here iodine deficiency precipitates a mild (physiological) form of thyroid autoimmune reactivity. Iodine excess stimulates thymus development. Iodine probably exerts these effects via interference in the various stages of the autoimmune process. In the afferent and efferent stage, iodine-induced alterations in thyrocyte metabolism and even necrosis most likely play a role. By contrast, in the central phase, iodine has direct effects on thymus development, the development and function of various immune cells (T cells, B cells macrophages and dendritic cells) and the antigenicity of thyroglobulin."

A universal N-glycan core is attached to proteins during synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, and then diversity is generated as the proteins pass through the Golgi apparatus.

A specific succinyl-CoA:(R)-benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase activating (R)-benzylsuccinate to the CoA-thioester was purified and characterized from Thauera aromatica. The enzyme is fully reversible and forms exclusively the 2-(R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA isomer. Only some close chemical analogs of the substrates are accepted by the enzyme: succinate was partially replaced by maleate or methylsuccinate, and (R)-benzylsuccinate was replaced by methylsuccinate, benzylmalonate, or phenylsuccinate. In contrast to all other known CoA-transferases, the enzyme consists of two subunits of similar amino acid sequences and similar sizes (44 and 45 kDa) in an alpha(2)beta(2) conformation. Identity of the subunits with the products of the previously identified toluene-induced bbsEF genes was confirmed by determination of the exact masses via electrospray-mass spectrometry. The deduced amino acid sequences resemble those of only two other characterized CoA-transferases, oxalyl-CoA:formate CoA-transferase and (E)-cinnamoyl-CoA:(R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase, which represent a new family of CoA-transferases. As suggested by kinetic analysis, the reaction mechanism of enzymes of this family apparently involves formation of a ternary complex between the enzyme and the two substrates."

When two inputs to a Purkinje cell, one from a climbing fiber and the other from a set of granule cell axons, are repeatedly associated, the input efficacy of the granule cell axons in exciting the Purkinje cell is persistently depressed. Section I of this review briefly describes the history of research around LTD, and section II specifies physiological characteristics of LTD. Sections III and IV then review the massive data accumulated during the past two decades, which have revealed complex networks of signal transduction underlying LTD. Section III deals with a variety of first messengers, receptors, ion channels, transporters, G proteins, and phospholipases. Section IV covers second messengers, protein kinases, phosphatases and other elements, eventually leading to inactivation of DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolone-propionate-selective glutamate receptors that mediate granule cell-to-Purkinje cell transmission. Section V defines roles of LTD in the light of the microcomplex concept of the cerebellum as functionally eliminating those synaptic connections associated with errors during repeated exercises, while preserving other connections leading to the successful execution of movements. Section VI examines the validity of this microcomplex concept based on the data collected from recent numerous studies of various forms of motor learning in ocular reflexes, eye-blink conditioning, posture, locomotion, and hand/arm movements. Section VII emphasizes the importance of integrating studies on LTD and learning and raises future possibilities of extending cerebellar research to reveal memory mechanisms of implicit learning in general."

Peripheral node addressin recognized by the MECA-79 antibody is apparently part of the L-selectin ligand, but its chemical nature has been undefined. We now identify a sulfated extended core1 mucin-type O-glycan, Gal beta 1-->4(sulfo-->6)GlcNAc beta 1-->3Gal beta 1-->3GalNAc, as the MECA-79 epitope. Molecular cloning of a HEV-expressed core1-beta 1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core1-beta 3GlcNAcT) enabled the construction of the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x on extended core1 O-glycans, recapitulating the potent L-selectin-mediated, shear-dependent adhesion observed with novel L-selectin ligands derived from core2 beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I null mice.

11449275,Essential role for Gab2 in the allergic response.,10.1038/35084076,"Dos/Gab family scaffolding adapters (Dos, Gab1, Gab2) bind several signal relay molecules, including the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K); they are also implicated in growth factor, cytokine and antigen receptor signal transduction. Mice lacking Gab1 die during embryogenesis and show defective responses to several stimuli. Here we report that Gab2-/- mice are viable and generally healthy; however, the response (for example, degranulation and cytokine gene expression) of Gab2-/- mast cells to stimulation of the high affinity immunoglobulin-epsilon (IgE) receptor Fc(epsilon)RI is defective. Accordingly, allergic reactions such as passive cutaneous and systemic anaphylaxis are markedly impaired in Gab2-/- mice. Biochemical analyses reveal that signalling pathways dependent on PI(3)K, a critical component of Fc(epsilon)RI signalling, are defective in Gab2-/- mast cells. Our data identify Gab2 as the principal activator of PI(3)K in response to Fc(epsilon)RI activation, thereby providing genetic evidence that Dos/Gab family scaffolds regulate the PI(3)K pathway in vivo. Gab2 and/or its associated signalling molecules may be new targets for developing drugs to treat allergy."
11469811,Cortisol metabolism and the role of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.,10.1053/beem.2000.0119,"Two isoforms of the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) interconvert the active glucocorticoid, cortisol, and inactive cortisone. 11beta-HSD1 is believed to act in vivo predominantly as an oxo-reductase using NADP(H) as a cofactor to generate cortisol. In contrast, 11beta-HSD2 acts exclusively as an NAD-dependent dehydrogenase inactivating cortisol to cortisone, thereby protecting the mineralocorticoid receptor from occupation by cortisol. In peripheral tissues, both enzymes serve to control the availability of cortisol to bind to the corticosteroid receptors. Defective expression of 11beta-HSD2 is implicated in patients with hypertension and intra-uterine growth retardation, while 11beta-HSD1 appears to be intricately involved in the conditions of apparent cortisone reductase deficiency, insulin resistance and visceral obesity. The ability of peripheral tissues to regulate corticosteroid concentrations through 11beta-HSD isozymes is established as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of diverse human diseases. Modulation of enzyme activity may offer a novel therapeutic approach to treating human disease while circumventing the consequences of systemic glucocorticoid excess or deficiency."
11479373,Identification of plant cytokinin biosynthetic enzymes as dimethylallyl diphosphate:ATP/ADP isopentenyltransferases.,10.1093/pcp/pce112,"It has been believed that the key step in cytokinin biosynthesis is the addition of a 5-carbon chain to the N(6) of AMP. To identify cytokinin biosynthesis enzymes that catalyze the formation of the isopentenyl side chain of cytokinins, the Arabidopsis genomic sequence was searched for genes that could code for isopentenyltransferases. This resulted in the identification of nine putative genes for isopentenyltransferases. One of these, AtIPT4, was subjected to detailed analysis. Overexpression of AtIPT4 caused cytokinin-independent shoot formation on calli. As shoot formation on calli normally occurs only when cytokinins are applied, it suggested that this gene product catalyzed cytokinin biosynthesis in plants. Recombinant AtIPT4 catalyzed the transfer of an isopentenyl group from dimethylallyl diphosphate to the N(6) of ATP and ADP, but not to that of AMP. AtIPT4 did not exhibit the DMAPP:tRNA isopentenyltransferase activity. These results indicate that cytokinins are, at least in part, synthesized from ATP and ADP in plants."
11507694,Seven regions of the genome show evidence of linkage to type 1 diabetes in a consensus analysis of 767 multiplex families.,10.1086/323501,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a genetically complex disorder of glucose homeostasis that results from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. Two previous whole-genome scans for linkage to T1D in 187 and 356 families containing affected sib pairs (ASPs) yielded apparently conflicting results, despite partial overlap in the families analyzed. However, each of these studies individually lacked power to detect loci with locus-specific disease prevalence/sib-risk ratios (lambda(s)) <1.4. In the present study, a third genome scan was performed using a new collection of 225 multiplex families with T1D, and the data from all three of these genome scans were merged and analyzed jointly. The combined sample of 831 ASPs, all with both parents genotyped, provided 90% power to detect linkage for loci with lambda(s) = 1.3 at P=7.4x10(-4). Three chromosome regions were identified that showed significant evidence of linkage (P<2.2x10(-5); LOD scores >4), 6p21 (IDDM1), 11p15 (IDDM2), 16q22-q24, and four more that showed suggestive evidence (P<7.4x10(-4), LOD scores > or =2.2), 10p11 (IDDM10), 2q31 (IDDM7, IDDM12, and IDDM13), 6q21 (IDDM15), and 1q42. Exploratory analyses, taking into account the presence of specific high-risk HLA genotypes or affected sibs' ages at disease onset, provided evidence of linkage at several additional sites, including the putative IDDM8 locus on chromosome 6q27. Our results indicate that much of the difficulty in mapping T1D susceptibility genes results from inadequate sample sizes, and the results point to the value of future international collaborations to assemble and analyze much larger data sets for linkage in complex diseases."
11513957,"Sequencing, phylogenetic and transcriptional analysis of the glyoxylate bypass operon (ace) in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii.",10.1016/s0167-4781(01)00263-9,"The glyoxylate cycle occurs in the three domains of living organisms: Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea. We have isolated and sequenced the ace (acetate assimilation) gene operon, comprising the glyoxylate cycle key enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase genes (icl or aceA and ms or aceB), from the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. This is the first time that these genes are sequenced in an organism from the domain Archaea. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequenced genes revealed that isocitrate lyase shows a significant identity with isocitrate lyases from Eukarya and Bacteria, but it is not more closely related to eukaryal or bacterial enzymes, and that malate synthase from H. volcanii has very little identity with any other known protein. This enzyme forms a new class of malate synthases. Transcriptional analysis indicated that both genes are cotranscribed in a single 2.7 kb mRNA molecule. The genes were transcribed only when acetate was the carbon source, indicating transcriptional regulation. Two sets of palindromic sequences were found in the promoter region, possibly involved in binding of transcriptional regulators (repressors and/or activators)."

The genes of the heterotrimeric, molybdopterin cofactor (MoCo)-, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-, and [Fe-S] cluster-dependent 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine (ketone) dehydrogenase (KDH) were identified within this cluster. The gene of the large MoCo subunit of KDH was located 4,266 bp from the FAD and [Fe-S] cluster subunit genes. Deduced functions of proteins encoded by open reading frames (ORFs) of the cluster were correlated to individual steps in nicotine degradation. The gene for 2,6-dihydroxypyridine 3-hydroxylase was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified homodimeric enzyme of 90 kDa contained 2 mol of tightly bound FAD per mol of dimer. Enzyme activity was strictly NADH-dependent and specific for 2,6-dihydroxypyridine. 2,3-Dihydroxypyridine and 2,6-dimethoxypyridine acted as irreversible inhibitors. Additional ORFs were shown to encode hypothetical proteins presumably required for holoenzyme assembly, interaction with the cell membrane, and transcriptional regulation, including a MobA homologue predicted to be specific for the synthesis of the molybdopterin cytidine dinucleotide cofactor."

The main body of the export apparatus specific for virulence proteins is identified as a needle complex, which has a similar structural organization to flagella. The two structures share several proteins with highly homologous amino acid sequences. Even where the sequence identity is low among flagellar proteins from various species, the physico-chemical properties of each protein remain homologous. Therefore, by comparing the physico-chemical properties of unidentified proteins, it is possible to find homologs among type III secretion systems."

It was dependent on NADPH and molecular oxygen. The enzymatic reaction was inhibited by carbon monoxide as well as by several cytochrome P450 inhibitors, especially ketoconazole, indicating that the reaction was mediated by cytochrome P450. The enzyme showed substrate specificity for 7-deoxyloganin. The K(m) values for 7-deoxyloganin and NADPH were estimated as 170 and 18 microM, respectively, from Lineweaver-Burk plots."

A gene from tea leaves encoding caffeine synthase, an N-methyltransferase that catalyses the last two steps of caffeine biosynthesis, has been cloned and the recombinant enzyme produced in E. coli. Similar genes have been isolated from coffee leaves but the recombinant protein has a different substrate specificity to the tea enzyme. The cloning of caffeine biosynthesis genes opens up the possibility of using genetic engineering to produce naturally decaffeinated tea and coffee."
11544206,Reduced function of a phenylacetate-oxidizing cytochrome p450 caused strong genetic improvement in early phylogeny of penicillin-producing strains.,10.1128/JB.183.19.5465-5471.2001,"The single-copy pahA gene from Penicillium chrysogenum encodes a phenylacetate 2-hydroxylase that catalyzes the first step of phenylacetate catabolism, an oxidative route that decreases the precursor availability for penicillin G biosynthesis. PahA protein is homologous to cytochrome P450 monooxygenases involved in the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds, with 84% identity to the Aspergillus nidulans homologue PhacA. Expression level of pahA displays an inverse correlation with the penicillin productivity of the strain and is subject to induction by phenylacetic acid. Gene expression studies have revealed a reduced oxidative activity of the protein encoded by pahA genes from penicillin-overproducing strains of P. chrysogenum compared to the activity conferred by phacA of A. nidulans. Sequencing and expression of wild-type pahA from P. chrysogenum NRRL 1951 revealed that an L181F mutation was responsible for the reduced function in present industrial strains. The mutation has been tracked down to Wisconsin 49-133, a mutant obtained at the Department of Botany of the University of Wisconsin in 1949, at the beginning of the development of the Wisconsin family of strains."
11556781,Evolution of benzoxazinone biosynthesis and indole production in maize.,10.1007/s004250100594,"The synthesis of a diverse spectrum of secondary metabolites has allowed plants to develop sophisticated chemical defense mechanisms. Maize (Zea mays L.), for example, releases a cocktail of volatile compounds when attacked by a caterpillar. These compounds attract a parasitic wasp, which deposits its eggs in the larvae, thereby controlling the population size of the herbivore. Indole, which is part of the cocktail, is produced by an enzyme recruited from primary metabolism. Indole can either function as a volatile signal or be converted by specific cytochrome P450 enzymes into benzoxazinoids, which function as important defense chemicals."
11571189,Cloning and genetic characterization of dca genes required for beta-oxidation of straight-chain dicarboxylic acids in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.,10.1128/AEM.67.10.4817-4827.2001,"A previous study of deletions in the protocatechuate (pca) region of the Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 chromosome revealed that genes required for utilization of the six-carbon dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, are linked to the pca structural genes. To investigate the genes involved in adipate catabolism, a 33.8-kb SacI fragment, which corrects a deletion spanning this region, was cloned. In addition to containing known pca, qui, and pob genes (for protocatechuate, quinate, and 4-hydroxybenzoate dissimilation), clone pZR8000 contained 10 kb of DNA which was the subject of this investigation. A mutant strain of Escherichia coli DH5alpha, strain EDP1, was isolated that was able to utilize protocatechuate and 4-hydroxybenzoate as growth substrates when EDP1 cells contained pZR8000. Sequence analysis of the new region of DNA on pZR8000 revealed open reading frames predicted to be involved in beta-oxidation. Knockouts of three genes implicated in beta-oxidation steps were introduced into the chromosome of Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. Each of the mutants was unable to grow with adipate. Because the mutants were affected in their ability to utilize additional saturated, straight-chain dicarboxylic acids, the newly discovered 10 kb of DNA was termed the dca (dicarboxylic acid) region. Mutant strains included one with a deletion in dcaA (encoding an acyl coenzyme A [acyl-CoA] dehydrogenase homolog), one with a deletion in dcaE (encoding an enoyl-CoA hydratase homolog), and one with a deletion in dcaH (encoding a hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase homolog). Data on the dca region should help us probe the functional significance and interrelationships of clustered genetic elements in this section of the Acinetobacter chromosome."

In addition to CAS, cysteine synthase (CS, EC 4.2.99.8) possesses CAS activity. To explore the physiological significance of cyanide metabolism, we isolated the cDNA clones corresponding to purified CAS (designated PCAS-1 and PCAS-2) and CS (designated PCS-1 and PCS-2) from potato using the information of these amino acid sequences. The recombinant proteins of PCS-1, PCS-2 and PCAS-1 catalyzed both CAS and CS reactions, although the ratios between CAS and CS activity were remarkably different. PCAS-1 preferred the substrates for the CAS reaction to the substrates for the CS reaction. From the kinetic characters and homology of amino acid sequences with known CS-like proteins, PCS-1, PCS-2 and PCAS-1 were identified as cytosolic CS, plastidic CS and mitochondrial CAS, respectively. The highest level of CAS activity, CAS protein and its mRNA were detected in potato buds. Stimulation of CAS activity and protein accumulation by ethylene without the concomitant increase of its mRNA suggested that ethylene induces CAS protein accumulation at the post-transcriptional level."
11577986,The TSH receptor and its role in thyroid disease.,10.1007/pl00000941,"The thyrotropin (TSH) receptor plays a preeminent role in thyroid physiology and disease. TSH, acting through the TSH receptor, is the major stimulator of thyroid cell growth, differentiation and function. In Graves' disease, the TSH receptor is the target of stimulating antibodies that cause hyperthyroidism. Although still a topic of debate, the TSH receptor has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the endocrine ophthalmopathy associated with Graves' disease. Blocking antibodies against the TSH receptor are involved in the development of hypothyroidism in a subset of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Transplacental passage of stimulating or blocking TSH receptor antibodies from a mother with autoimmune thyroid disease may result in transient hyper- or hypothyroidism in early infancy. During pregnancy, the placental hormone human choriogonadotropin (hCG) can cause gestational hyperthyroidism through cross-reaction with the TSH receptor. Gestational hyperthyroidism may also be involved in the pathogenesis of hyperemesis gravidarum. Trophoblast tumors secreting hCG are a rare cause of hyperthyroidism. Somatic activating mutations of the TSH receptor have been identified as a molecular cause of toxic adenomas, whereas activating mutations in the germline give rise to nonautoimmune familial hyperthyroidism or sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism. These gain-of-function mutations are dominant, and one mutated allele is sufficient to result in disease. Inactivating germline mutations of both TSH receptor alleles lead to variable degrees of resistance to TSH, encompassing a spectrum ranging from euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia to overt hypothyroidism with thyroid hypoplasia."
11591691,Functional analysis of genes for biosynthesis of pyocyanin and phenazine-1-carboxamide from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.,10.1128/JB.183.21.6454-6465.2001,"Two seven-gene phenazine biosynthetic loci were cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The operons, designated phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1 and phzA2B2C2D2E2F2G2, are homologous to previously studied phenazine biosynthetic operons from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aureofaciens. Functional studies of phenazine-nonproducing strains of fluorescent pseudomonads indicated that each of the biosynthetic operons from P. aeruginosa is sufficient for production of a single compound, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). Subsequent conversion of PCA to pyocyanin is mediated in P. aeruginosa by two novel phenazine-modifying genes, phzM and phzS, which encode putative phenazine-specific methyltransferase and flavin-containing monooxygenase, respectively. Expression of phzS alone in Escherichia coli or in enzymes, pyocyanin-nonproducing P. fluorescens resulted in conversion of PCA to 1-hydroxyphenazine. P. aeruginosa with insertionally inactivated phzM or phzS developed pyocyanin-deficient phenotypes. A third phenazine-modifying gene, phzH, which has a homologue in Pseudomonas chlororaphis, also was identified and was shown to control synthesis of phenazine-1-carboxamide from PCA in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Our results suggest that there is a complex pyocyanin biosynthetic pathway in P. aeruginosa consisting of two core loci responsible for synthesis of PCA and three additional genes encoding unique enzymes involved in the conversion of PCA to pyocyanin, 1-hydroxyphenazine, and phenazine-1-carboxamide."
11679404,Cytochrome p450 and vascular homeostasis.,10.1161/hh2101.099268,"Since the initial reports that renal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes can metabolize arachidonic acid to substances which affect arterial tone, it has become increasingly clear that CYP enzymes expressed within the cardiovascular system play a crucial role in the modulation of vascular homeostasis. There is strong evidence suggesting that the activation of a CYP epoxygenase in endothelial cells is an essential step in nitric oxide and prostacyclin-independent vasodilatation of several vascular beds, particularly in the heart and kidney. A smooth muscle CYP omega-hydroxylase, on the other hand, generates a vasoconstrictor eicosanoid that is central to the myogenic response. Moreover, CYP epoxygenase and omega-hydroxylase products, as well as CYP-derived reactive oxygen species, are intracellular signal transduction molecules involved in several signaling cascades affecting numerous cellular processes, including vascular cell proliferation and angiogenesis. This review summarizes the vascular effects of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, both of which are CYP-derived metabolites of arachidonic acid, endogenously generated within endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Although the link between CYP expression/activity and cardiovascular disease is currently tentative, the evidence being accumulated to suggest that CYP pathways are altered in animal models of hypertension and atherosclerosis can no longer be ignored. The development of selective pharmacological tools is, however, a prerequisite for the analysis of the involvement of specific CYP isoforms in the regulation of vascular homeostasis in human subjects."
11687489,Molecular bases of circadian rhythms.,10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215,"Circadian rhythms are found in most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. The mechanism by which organisms maintain these roughly 24-h rhythms in the absence of environmental stimuli has long been a mystery and has recently been the subject of intense research. In the past few years, we have seen explosive progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of circadian rhythms in model systems ranging from cyanobacteria to mammals. This review attempts to outline these primarily genetic and biochemical findings and encompasses work done in cyanobacteria, Neurospora, higher plants, Drosophila, and rodents. Although actual clock components do not seem to be conserved between kingdoms, central clock mechanisms are conserved. Somewhat paradoxically, clock components that are conserved between species can be used in diverse ways. The different uses of common components may reflect the important role that the circadian clock plays in adaptation of species to particular environmental niches."

11716909,Cardiomyopathies: from genetics to the prospect of treatment.,10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06657-0,"Cardiomyopathies are defined as diseases of the myocardium associated with cardiac dysfunction ranging from lifelong symptomless forms to major health problems such as progressive heart failure, arrhythmia, thromboembolism, and sudden cardiac death. They are classified by morphological characteristics as hypertrophic (HCM), dilated (DCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular (ARVC), and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). A familial cause has been shown in 50% of patients with HCM, 35% with DCM, and 30% with ARVC. In HCM, nine genetic loci and more than 130 mutations in ten different sarcomeric genes and in the gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) have been identified, suggesting impaired force production associated with inefficient use of ATP as the crucial disease mechanism. In DCM, 16 chromosomal loci with defects of several proteins also involved in the development of skeletal myopathies have been detected. These mutated cytoskeletal and nuclear transporter proteins may alter force transmission or disrupt nuclear function, resulting in cell death. Further DCM mutations have also been identified in sarcomeric genes, which indicates that different defects of the same protein can result in either HCM or DCM. In ARVC, six genetic loci and mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor, which controls electromechanical coupling, and in plakoglobin and desmoglobin (molecules involved in desmosomal cell-junction integrity), have been identified. Yet, no genetic linkage has been shown in RCM. Apart from disease-causing mutations, other factors, such as environment, genetic background, and the recently identified modifier genes of the renin-angiotensin, adrenergic, and endothelin systems are likely to result in the wide variety of RCM clinical presentations. Treatment options are symptomatic and are mainly focused on treatment of heart failure and prevention of thromboembolism and sudden death. Identification of patients with high risk for major arrhythmic events is important because implantable cardioverter defibrillators can prevent sudden death. Clinical and genetic risk stratification may lead to prospective trials of primary implantation of cardioverter defibrillators in people with hereditary cardiomyopathy."
11722727,CheC is related to the family of flagellar switch proteins and acts independently from CheD to control chemotaxis in Bacillus subtilis.,10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02581.x,"Chemotaxis by Bacillus subtilis requires the inter-acting chemotaxis proteins CheC and CheD. In this study, we show that CheD is absolutely required for a behavioural response to proline mediated by McpC but is not required for the response to asparagine mediated by McpB. We also show that CheC is not required for the excitation response to asparagine stimulation but is required for adaptation while asparagine remains complexed with the McpB chemoreceptor. CheC displayed an interaction with the histidine kinase CheA as well as with McpB in the yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting that the mechanism by which CheC affects adaptation may result from an interaction with the receptor-CheA complex. Furthermore, CheC was found to be related to the family of flagellar switch proteins comprising FliM and FliY but is not present in many proteobacterial genomes in which CheD homologues exist. The distinct physiological roles for CheC and CheD during B. subtilis chemotaxis and the observation that CheD is present in bacterial genomes that lack CheC indicate that these proteins can function independently and may define unique pathways during chemotactic signal transduction. We speculate that CheC interacts with flagellar switch components and dissociates upon CheY-P binding and subsequently interacts with the receptor complex to facilitate adaptation."
11741095,VEGF receptor signal transduction.,10.1126/stke.2001.112.re21,"The family of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) currently includes VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and placenta growth factor (PlGF). Several of these factors, notably VEGF-A, exist as different isoforms, which appear to have unique biological functions. The VEGF family proteins bind in a distinct pattern to three structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases, denoted VEGF receptor-1, -2, and -3. Neuropilins, heparan-sulfated proteoglycans, cadherins, and integrin alphavbeta3 serve as coreceptors for certain but not all VEGF proteins. Moreover, the angiogenic response to VEGF varies between different organs and is dependent on the genetic background of the animal. Inactivation of the genes for VEGF-A and VEGF receptor-2 leads to embryonal death due to the lack of endothelial cells. Inactivation of the gene encoding VEGF receptor-1 leads to an increased number of endothelial cells, which obstruct the vessel lumen. Inactivation of VEGF receptor-3 leads to abnormally organized vessels and cardiac failure. Although VEGF receptor-3 normally is expressed only on lymphatic endothelial cells, it is up-regulated on vascular as well as nonvascular tumors and appears to be involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. A large body of data, such as those on gene inactivation, indicate that VEGF receptor-1 exerts a negative regulatory effect on VEGF receptor-2, at least during embryogenesis. Recent data imply a positive regulatory role for VEGF receptor-1 in pathological angiogenesis. The VEGF proteins are in general poor mitogens, but binding of VEGF-A to VEGF receptor-2 leads to survival, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells and mediation of vascular permeability. This review outlines the current knowledge about the signal transduction properties of VEGF receptors, with focus on VEGF receptor-2."

The operon encoding catabolic enzymes in the utilization of L-ascorbate (ula) has been identified; this operon of previously unknown function had been designated the yif-sga operon. Three enzymes in the pathway that produce D-xylulose 5-phosphate have been functionally characterized: 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase (UlaD), L-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase (UlaE), and L-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase (UlaF). Several products of the yia-sgb operon were also functionally characterized, although the substrate and physiological function of the operon remain unknown: 2,3-diketo-L-gulonate reductase (YiaK), 3-keto-L-gulonate kinase (LyxK), 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase (SgbH), and L-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase (SgbE)."

In this work, we have purified the enzymes involved in catalyzing the intermediate steps leading to the synthesis of ADP-D-beta-D-heptose and have biochemically characterized the reaction products by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. We have also constructed a deletion in a novel gene, gmhB (formerly yaeD), which results in the formation of an altered LPS core. This mutation confirms that the GmhB protein is required for the formation of ADP-D-beta-D-heptose. Our results demonstrate that the synthesis of ADP-D-beta-D-heptose in Escherichia coli requires three proteins, GmhA (sedoheptulose 7-phosphate isomerase), HldE (bifunctional D-beta-D-heptose 7-phosphate kinase/D-beta-D-heptose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase), and GmhB (D,D-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase), as well as ATP and the ketose phosphate precursor sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.

Spore extracts of P. digitatum convert geraniol and nerol NAD+-dependently into citral. Spore extract also converts citral NAD+-dependently into geranic acid. Furthermore, a novel enzymatic activity, citral lyase, which cofactor-independently converts citral into methylheptenone and acetaldehyde, was detected. These result show that spores of P. digitatum convert geraniol via a novel biotransformation pathway. This is the first time a biotransformation pathway in fungal spores has been substantiated by biochemical studies. Geraniol and nerol are converted into citral by citrol dehydrogenase activity. The citral formed is subsequently deacetylated by citral lyase activity, forming methylheptenone. Moreover, citral is converted reversibly into geranic acid by citral dehydrogenase activity."
11782468,Methylseleninate is a substrate rather than an inhibitor of mammalian thioredoxin reductase. Implications for the antitumor effects of selenium.,10.1074/jbc.M109234200,"Biochemical and clinical evidence indicates that monomethylated selenium compounds are crucial for the tumor preventive effects of the trace element selenium and that methylselenol (CH(3)SeH) is a key metabolite. As suggested by Ganther (Ganther, H. E. (1999) Carcinogenesis 20, 1657-1666), methylselenol and its precursor methylseleninate might exert their effects by inhibition of the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase via the irreversible formation of a diselenide bridge. Here we report that methylseleninate does not act as an inhibitor of mammalian thioredoxin reductase but is in fact an excellent substrate (K(m) of 18 microm, k(cat) of 23 s(-1)), which is reduced by the enzyme according to the equation 2 NADPH + 2 H(+) + CH(3)SeO(2)H --> 2 NADP(+) + 2 H(2)O + CH(3)SeH. The selenium-containing product of this reaction was identified by mass spectrometry. Nascent methylselenol was found to efficiently reduce both H(2)O(2) and glutathione disulfide. The implications of these findings for the antitumor activity of selenium are discussed. Methylseleninate was a poor substrate not only for human glutathione reductase but also for the non-selenium thioredoxin reductases enzymes from Drosophila melanogaster and Plasmodium falciparum. This suggests that the catalytic selenocysteine residue of mammalian thioredoxin reductase is essential for methylseleninate reduction."

The core 3 structure is restricted in its occurrence to mucins from specific tissues such as the stomach, small intestine, and colon. A partial sequence encoding a novel member of the human beta3Gn-T family was found in one of the data bases. We cloned a complementary DNA of this gene and named it beta3Gn-T6. The putative amino acid sequence of beta3Gn-T6 retains the beta3Gn-T motifs and is predicted to comprise a typical type II membrane protein. The soluble form of beta3Gn-T6 expressed in insect cells showed beta3Gn-T activity toward GalNAcalpha-p-nitrophenyl and GalNAcalpha1-serine/threonine. The beta1,3-linkage between GlcNAc and GalNAc of the enzyme reaction product was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography and NMR analyses. beta3Gn-T6 effectively transferred a GlcNAc to the GalNAc residue on MUC1 mucin, resulting in the synthesis of a core 3 structure. Real time PCR analysis revealed that the beta3Gn-T6 transcript was restricted in its distribution, mainly to the stomach, colon, and small intestine. We concluded that beta3Gn-T6 is the most logical candidate for the core 3 synthase, which plays an important role in the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans in digestive organs."
11823218,Osmotically regulated synthesis of the compatible solute ectoine in Bacillus pasteurii and related Bacillus spp.,10.1128/AEM.68.2.772-783.2002,"By using natural-abundance (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis we have investigated the types of compatible solutes that are synthesized de novo in a variety of Bacillus species under high-osmolality growth conditions. Five different patterns of compatible solute production were found among the 13 Bacillus species we studied. Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, and B. megaterium produced proline; B. cereus, B. circulans, B. thuringiensis, Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus synthesized glutamate; B. alcalophilus, B. psychrophilus, and B. pasteurii synthesized ectoine; and Salibacillus (formerly Bacillus) salexigens produced both ectoine and hydroxyectoine, whereas Virgibacillus (formerly Bacillus) pantothenticus synthesized both ectoine and proline. Hence, the ability to produce the tetrahydropyrimidine ectoine under hyperosmotic growth conditions is widespread within the genus Bacillus and closely related taxa. To study ectoine biosynthesis within the group of Bacillus species in greater detail, we focused on B. pasteurii. We cloned and sequenced its ectoine biosynthetic genes (ectABC). The ectABC genes encode the diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase (EctA), the diaminobutyric acid aminotransferase (EctB), and the ectoine synthase (EctC). Together these proteins constitute the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, and their heterologous expression in B. subtilis led to the production of ectoine. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the ectABC genes are genetically organized as an operon whose expression is strongly enhanced when the osmolality of the growth medium is raised. Primer extension analysis allowed us to pinpoint the osmoregulated promoter of the B. pasteurii ectABC gene cluster. HPLC analysis of osmotically challenged B. pasteurii cells revealed that ectoine production within this bacterium is finely tuned and closely correlated with the osmolality of the growth medium. These observations together with the osmotic control of ectABC transcription suggest that the de novo synthesis of ectoine is an important facet in the cellular adaptation of B. pasteurii to high-osmolarity surroundings."
11823228,"Identical ring cleavage products during anaerobic degradation of naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, and tetralin indicate a new metabolic pathway.",10.1128/AEM.68.2.852-858.2002,"Anaerobic degradation of naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, and tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) was investigated with a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture obtained from a contaminated aquifer. Degradation studies with tetralin revealed 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid as a major metabolite indicating activation by addition of a C(1) unit to tetralin, comparable to the formation of 2-naphthoic acid in anaerobic naphthalene degradation. The activation reaction was specific for the aromatic ring of tetralin; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid was not detected. The reduced 2-naphthoic acid derivatives tetrahydro-, octahydro-, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid were identified consistently in supernatants of cultures grown with either naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, or tetralin. In addition, two common ring cleavage products were identified. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-resolution GC-MS analyses revealed a compound with a cyclohexane ring and two carboxylic acid side chains as one of the first ring cleavage products. The elemental composition was C(11)H(16)O(4) (C(11)H(16)O(4)-diacid), indicating that all carbon atoms of the precursor 2-naphthoic acid structure were preserved in this ring cleavage product. According to the mass spectrum, the side chains could be either an acetic acid and a propenic acid, or a carboxy group and a butenic acid side chain. A further ring cleavage product was identified as 2-carboxycyclohexylacetic acid and was assumed to be formed by beta-oxidation of one of the side chains of the C(11)H(16)O(4)-diacid. Stable isotope-labeling growth experiments with either (13)C-labeled naphthalene, per-deuterated naphthalene-d(8), or a (13)C-bicarbonate-buffered medium showed that the ring cleavage products derived from the introduced carbon source naphthalene. The series of identified metabolites suggests that anaerobic degradation of naphthalenes proceeds via reduction of the aromatic ring system of 2-naphthoic acid to initiate ring cleavage in analogy to the benzoyl-coenzyme A pathway for monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Our findings provide strong indications that further degradation goes through saturated compounds with a cyclohexane ring structure and not through monoaromatic compounds. A metabolic pathway for anaerobic degradation of bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with 2-naphthoic acid as the central intermediate is proposed."
11826292,Genetic diseases of acid-base transporters.,10.1146/annurev.physiol.64.092801.141759,"Genetic disorders of acid-base transporters involve plasmalemmal and organellar transporters of H(+), HCO3(-), and Cl(-). Autosomal-dominant and -recessive forms of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) are caused by mutations in ion transporters of the acid-secreting Type A intercalated cell of the renal collecting duct. These include the AE1 Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger of the basolateral membrane and at least two subunits of the apical membrane vacuolar (v)H(+)-ATPase, the V1 subunit B1 (associated with deafness) and the V0 subunit a4. Recessive proximal RTA with ocular disease arises from mutations in the electrogenic Na(+)-bicarbonate cotransporter NBC1 of the proximal tubular cell basolateral membrane. Recessive mixed proximal-distal RTA accompanied by osteopetrosis and mental retardation is associated with mutations in cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase II. The metabolic alkalosis of congenital chloride-losing diarrhea is caused by mutations in the DRA Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger of the ileocolonic apical membrane. Recessive osteopetrosis is caused by deficient osteoclast acid secretion across the ruffled border lacunar membrane, the result of mutations in the vH(+)-ATPase V0 subunit or in the CLC-7 Cl(-) channel. X-linked nephrolithiasis and engineered deficiencies in some other CLC Cl(-) channels are thought to represent defects of organellar acidification. Study of acid-base transport disease-associated mutations should enhance our understanding of protein structure-function relationships and their impact on the physiology of cell, tissue, and organism."
11827525,Rapid kinetic studies of acetyl-CoA synthesis: evidence supporting the catalytic intermediacy of a paramagnetic NiFeC species in the autotrophic Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.,10.1021/bi011687i,"CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS), a key enzyme in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of anaerobic CO(2) fixation, is a bifunctional enzyme containing CODH, which catalyzes the reversible two-electron oxidation of CO to CO(2), and ACS, which catalyzes acetyl-CoA synthesis from CoA, CO, and a methylated corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CFeSP). ACS contains an active site nickel iron-sulfur cluster that forms a paramagnetic adduct with CO, called the nickel iron carbon (NiFeC) species, which we have hypothesized to be a key intermediate in acetyl-CoA synthesis. This hypothesis has been controversial. Here we report the results of steady-state kinetic experiments; stopped-flow and rapid freeze-quench transient kinetic studies; and kinetic simulations that directly test this hypothesis. Our results show that formation of the NiFeC intermediate occurs at approximately the same rate as, and its decay occurs 6-fold faster than, the rate of acetyl-CoA synthesis. Kinetic simulations of the steady-state and transient kinetic results accommodate the NiFeC species in the mechanism and define the rate constants for the elementary steps in acetyl-CoA synthesis. The combined results strongly support the kinetic competence of the NiFeC species in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The results also imply that the methylation of ACS occurs by attack of the Ni(1+) site in the NiFeC intermediate on the methyl group of the methylated CFeSP. Our results indicate that CO inhibits acetyl-CoA synthesis by inhibiting this methyl transfer reaction. Under noninhibitory CO concentrations (below 100 microM), formation of the NiFeC species is rate-limiting, while at higher inhibitory CO concentrations, methyl transfer to ACS becomes rate-limiting."
11830598,Identification of coenzyme M biosynthetic phosphosulfolactate synthase: a new family of sulfonate-biosynthesizing enzymes.,10.1074/jbc.M201011200,"The hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Methanococcus jannaschii uses coenzyme M (2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid) as the terminal methyl carrier in methanogenesis. We describe an enzyme from that organism, (2R)-phospho-3-sulfolactate synthase (ComA), that catalyzes the first step in coenzyme M biosynthesis. ComA catalyzed the stereospecific Michael addition of sulfite to phosphoenolpyruvate over a broad range of temperature and pH conditions. Substrate and product analogs moderately inhibited activity. This enzyme has no significant sequence similarity to previously characterized enzymes; however, its Mg(2+)-dependent enzyme reaction mechanism may be analogous to one proposed for enolase. A diverse group of microbes and plants have homologs of ComA that could have been recruited for sulfolactate or sulfolipid biosyntheses."
11851909,Two glucosyltransferases are involved in detoxification of benzoxazinoids in maize.,10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01161.x,"Benzoxazinoids are major compounds involved in chemical defence in grasses. These toxins are stored in the vacuole as glucosides. Two glucosyltransferases, BX8 and BX9, that catalyse this last step of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis have been isolated via functional cloning. No close relative of these maize genes was found among the known glucosyltransferases. The enzymes display a very high degree of substrate specificity. DIMBOA, the major benzoxazinoid in young maize, is the preferred substrate. Both genes are highly expressed in young maize seedlings, the developmental stage with the highest activity of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis. Bx8 is included in the cluster of DIMBOA biosynthesis genes located on the short arm of chromosome 4. Hence, the gene cluster comprises three different enzymatic functions and a complete set of genes for the biosynthesis of DIBOA glucoside. Bx9 mapped to chromosome 1. Expression of Bx8 and Bx9 in Arabidopsis corroborated the potency of the enzymes in detoxification of their substrates. This capacity might have implications for allelopathic interactions."
11855654,Substrate specificity and sequence analysis define a polyphyletic origin of betanidin 5- and 6-O-glucosyltransferase from Dorotheanthus bellidiformis.,10.1007/s00425-001-0685-1,"Betanidin 6-O-glucosyltransferase (6-GT) is involved in the glycosylation of betacyanins, which replace the chromogenic anthocyanins as flower colorants in the Caryophyllales. The 6-GT cDNA was cloned from a cDNA library of Dorotheanthus bellidiformis (Burm. f.) N.E. Br., and the amino acid and nucleotide sequences were shown to be distinctly different from the corresponding betanidin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT) from the same plant species. Although both enzymes share very similar substrates, the proteins show only 19% amino acid sequence identity. In contrast, the protein sequence of the 6-GT showed significant identity to GTs from other species and may identify a new cluster of putative anthocyanidin GTs. Therefore, 6-GT and 5-GT apparently have evolved independently from ancestral glucosyltransferases involved in flavonoid biosynthesis."
11856310,"Biosynthesis of riboflavin: 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.",10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02674.x,"A cDNA sequence from Schizosaccharomyces pombe with similarity to 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase was expressed in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant protein is a homopentamer of 17-kDa subunits with an apparent molecular mass of 87 kDa as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation (it sediments at an apparent velocity of 5.0 S at 20 degrees C). The protein has been crystallized in space group C2221. The crystals diffract to a resolution of 2.4 A. The enzyme catalyses the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine from 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and 3,4-dihydroxy- 2-butanone 4-phosphate. Steady-state kinetic analysis afforded a vmax value of 13 000 nmol.mg-1.h-1 and Km values of 5 and 67 microm for 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate, respectively. The enzyme binds riboflavin with a Kd of 1.2 microm. The fluorescence quantum yield of enzyme-bound riboflavin is < 2% as compared with that of free riboflavin. The protein/riboflavin complex displays an optical transition centered around 530 nm as shown by absorbance and CD spectrometry which may indicate a charge transfer complex. Replacement of tryptophan 27 by tyrosine or phenylalanine had only minor effects on the kinetic properties, but complexes of the mutant proteins did not show the anomalous long wavelength absorbance of the wild-type protein. The replacement of tryptophan 27 by aliphatic amino acids substantially reduced the affinity of the enzyme for riboflavin and for the substrate, 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione."
11875555,MAP kinase signalling cascade in Arabidopsis innate immunity.,10.1038/415977a,"There is remarkable conservation in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by innate immune responses of plants, insects and mammals. We developed an Arabidopsis thaliana leaf cell system based on the induction of early-defence gene transcription by flagellin, a highly conserved component of bacterial flagella that functions as a PAMP in plants and mammals. Here we identify a complete plant MAP kinase cascade (MEKK1, MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6) and WRKY22/WRKY29 transcription factors that function downstream of the flagellin receptor FLS2, a leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor kinase. Activation of this MAPK cascade confers resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, suggesting that signalling events initiated by diverse pathogens converge into a conserved MAPK cascade."
11897488,TNF receptor subtype signalling: differences and cellular consequences.,10.1016/s0898-6568(01)00262-5,"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) is a multifunctional cytokine belonging to a family of ligands with an associated family of receptor proteins. The pleiotropic actions of TNF range from proliferative responses such as cell growth and differentiation, to inflammatory effects and the mediation of immune responses, to destructive cellular outcomes such as apoptotic and necrotic cell death mechanisms. Activated TNF receptors mediate the association of distinct adaptor proteins that regulate a variety of signalling processes including kinase or phosphatase activation, lipase stimulation, and protease induction. Moreover, the cytokine regulates the activities of transcription factors, heterotrimeric or monomeric G-proteins and calcium ion homeostasis in order to orchestrate its cellular functions. This review addresses the structural basis of TNF signalling, the pathways employed with their cellular consequences, and focuses on the specific role played by each of the two TNF receptor isotypes, TNFR1 and TNFR2."

In particular, new perspectives on T-cell development, co-stimulation and activation have emerged from the study of single and multiple gene-knockout animals, as well as from conditional knockout and 'knock-in' mutants. Analysis of these animals has clarified important intracellular signalling pathways and has shed light on the regulatory mechanisms that govern normal immune responses and autoimmunity."

The high frequency of these diseases and easy accessibility of the thyroid gland has allowed the identification of key pathogenic mechanisms in organ-specific autoimmune diseases.

Later, studies on apoptosis have provided new insights into autoimmune target destruction, indicating the involvement of death receptors and cytokine-regulated apoptotic pathways in the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmunity."
11914373,Assembly of photosystem I. I. Inactivation of the rubA gene encoding a membrane-associated rubredoxin in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 causes a loss of photosystem I activity.,10.1074/jbc.M201103200,"A 4.4-kb HindIII fragment, encoding an unusual rubredoxin (denoted RubA), a homolog of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 gene slr2034 and Arabidopsis thaliana HCF136, and the psbEFLJ operon, was cloned from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Inactivation of the slr2034 homolog produced a mutant with no detectable phenotype and wild-type photosystem (PS) II levels. Inactivation of the rubA gene of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 produced a mutant unable to grow photoautotrophically. RubA and PS I electron transport activity were completely absent in the mutant, although PS II activity was approximately 80% of the wild-type level. RubA contains a domain of approximately 50 amino acids with very high similarity to the rubredoxins of anaerobic bacteria and archaea, but it also contains a region of about 50 amino acids that is predicted to form a flexible hinge and a transmembrane alpha-helix at its C terminus. Overproduction of the water-soluble rubredoxin domain in Escherichia coli led to a product with the absorption and EPR spectra of typical rubredoxins. RubA was present in thylakoid but not plasma membranes of cyanobacteria and in chloroplast thylakoids isolated from spinach and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Fractionation studies suggest that RubA might transiently associate with PS I monomers, but no evidence for an association with PS I trimers or PS II was observed. PS I levels were significantly lower than in the wild type ( approximately 40%), but trimeric PS I complexes could be isolated from the rubA mutant. These PS I complexes completely lacked the stromal subunits PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE but contained all membrane-intrinsic subunits. The three missing proteins could be detected immunologically in whole cells, but their levels were greatly reduced, and degradation products were also detected. Our results indicate that RubA plays a specific role in the biogenesis of PS I."
11921398,Evolution of nitrate reductase: molecular and structural variations on a common function.,10.1002/1439-7633(20020301)3:2/3<198::AID-CBIC198>3.0.CO;2-C,"The biological transformation of nitrogen oxyanions is widespread in nature and gives rise to a robust biogeochemical cycle. The first step in nitrate reduction is carried out by the enzyme nitrate reductase (NR). Although NR always catalyzes the same chemical reaction (conversion of nitrate into nitrite), its location in the cell, structure, and function are organism-dependent. We use protein sequence data to determine phylogenetic relationships and to examine similarities in structure and function. Three distinct clades of NR are apparent: the eukaryotic assimilatory NR (Euk-NR) clade, the membrane-associated prokaryotic NR (Nar) clade, and a clade that includes both the periplasmic NR (Nap) and prokaryotic assimilatory NR (Nas). The high degree of sequence similarity and a phylogenetic distribution that follows taxonomic classification suggest a monophyletic origin for the Euk-NR early on in the evolution of eukaryotic cells. In contrast, sequence conservation, phylogenetic analysis, and physiology suggest that both Nar and Nap were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Nap and Nas share a lesser degree of similarity, with Nap a subclade of Nas. Nap from strict anaerobic bacteria such as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans is ancestral to facultative species and may provide an evolutionary link between Nap and Nas. We observed conserved binding sites for molybdenum and pterin cofactors in all four proteins. In pathways involving Euk-NR, Nas, and Nar, for which ammonia is the end product, nitrite is reduced to ammonia by a siroheme nitrite reductase. Nap, however, is coupled to a pentaheme nitrite reductase. In denitrification, whether Nar or Nap is involved, nitrite is reduced to nitric oxide by either a cytochrome cd1 or a copper-containing nitrite reductase. This complexity underscores the importance of nitrate reduction as a key biological process."
11934612,Regulation of flagellar assembly.,10.1016/s1369-5274(02)00302-8,"Research on the molecular mechanism of bacterial flagellar assembly has been an ongoing study that spans three decades. Early work showed that regulation of flagellar gene transcription was coupled to the assembly process. Recent advances in the understanding of the regulation of flagellar assembly have shown that translational and post-translational regulation also plays a significant role in flagellar assembly. In both Salmonella and Caulobacter crescentus, translational regulation influences the secretion of the anti-sigma(28) factor FlgM and the flagellin fljK, respectively. Post-translational regulatory mechanisms also control the length of the hook and the ability of the type III secretion system to discriminate between middle and late secretion substrates. The flagellum provides a model system for understanding how gene regulation functions to ensure the efficient assembly of a complex structure and fundamental mechanisms common to all type III secretion systems."
11941303,Primary immunodeficiency disorders: antibody deficiency.,10.1067/mai.2002.122466,"As a group, antibody deficiencies represent the most common types of primary immune deficiencies in human subjects. Often symptoms do not appear until the latter part of the first year of life, as passively acquired IgG from the mother decreases to below protective levels. As with the T-cell immune deficiencies, the spectrum of antibody deficiencies is broad, ranging from the most severe type of antibody deficiency with totally absent B cells and serum Igs to patients who have a selective antibody deficiency with normal serum Ig. In addition to the increased susceptibility to infections, a number of other disease processes (eg, autoimmunity and malignancies) can be involved in the clinical presentation. Fortunately, the availability of intravenous immune serum globulin has made the management of these patients more complete. Recently, molecular immunology has led to identification of the gene or genes involved in many of these antibody deficiencies. As discussed in this review, this has led to a better elucidation of the B-cell development and differentiation pathways and a more complete understanding of the pathogenesis of many of these antibody deficiencies."

These enzymes were effectively absent from cell extracts of the organism grown with 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and this substrate was metabolized by the catabolic enzymes of the homogentisate pathway. Two separate ring-fission dioxygenases for 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (gallic acid) were present in cell extracts of Pseudomonas putida when grown with syringic acid, and gallate was degraded by reactions associated with meta fission. One of the two gallate dioxygenases also attacked 3-O-methylgallic acid; the other, which did not, was induced when cells were exposed to gallate. This organism possessed ortho fission enzymes, including protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) and cis,cis-carboxymuconate-lactonizing enzyme (EC 5.5.1.2), after induction with 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (protocatechuic acid). Gallate was a substrate for protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, with a Vmax about 3% of that of protocatechuate and with an apparent Km slightly lower. Gallate was a powerful competitive inhibitor of protocatechuate oxidation."

The apparent Vmax and Km of 1,1,1-trichloroethane were 0.11 nmol min(-1) mg of cells(-1) and 3.1 microM, respectively. 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, chloral, and dichloroacetic acid were detected as metabolites of trichloroethylene. 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, and dichloroacetic acid were also detected as metabolites of 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The amounts of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, chloral, and dichloroacetic acid derived from the degradation of 3.60 micromol trichloroethylene were 0.16 micromol (4.4%), 0.11 micromol (3.1%), 0.02 micromol (0.6%), and 0.02 micromol (0.6%), respectively. The amounts of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid derived from the degradation of 1.73 micromol 1,1,1-trichloroethane were 1.48 micromol (85.5%), 0.22 micromol (12.7%), and 0.02 micromol (1.2%), respectively. More than 90% of theoretical total chloride was released in trichloroethylene degradation. Chloral and 2,2,2-trichloroethanol were transformed into each other, and were finally converted to trichloroacetic acid, and dichloroacetic acid.

12011078,Bacillus subtilis CheD is a chemoreceptor modification enzyme required for chemotaxis.,10.1074/jbc.M201334200,"The chemotaxis machinery of Bacillus subtilis is similar to that of the well characterized system of Escherichia coli. However, B. subtilis contains several chemotaxis genes not found in the E. coli genome, such as cheC and cheD, indicating that the B. subtilis chemotactic system is more complex. In B. subtilis, CheD is required for chemotaxis; the cheD mutant displays a tumbly phenotype, has abnormally methylated chemoreceptors, and responds poorly to most chemical stimuli. Homologs of B. subtilis CheD have been found in chemotaxis-like operons of a large number of bacteria and archaea, suggesting that CheD plays an important role in chemotactic sensory transduction for many organisms. However, the molecular function of CheD has remained unknown. In this study, we show that CheD catalyzes amide hydrolysis of specific glutaminyl side chains of the B. subtilis chemoreceptor McpA. In addition, we present evidence that CheD deamidates other B. subtilis chemoreceptors including McpB and McpC. Previously, deamidation of B. subtilis receptors was thought to be catalyzed by the CheB methylesterase, as is the case for E. coli receptors. Because cheD mutant cells do not respond to most chemoattractants, we conclude that deamidation by CheD is required for B. subtilis chemoreceptors to effectively transduce signals to the CheA kinase."

Demonstration of cytochrome p450-catalyzed formation of the lactone ring present in sesquiterpene lactones of chicory.",10.1104/pp.010957,"Chicory (Cichorium intybus) is known to contain guaianolides, eudesmanolides, and germacranolides. These sesquiterpene lactones are postulated to originate from a common germacranolide, namely (+)-costunolide. Whereas a pathway for the formation of germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid from farnesyl diphosphate had previously been established, we now report the isolation of an enzyme activity from chicory roots that converts the germacrene acid into (+)-costunolide. This (+)-costunolide synthase catalyzes the last step in the formation of the lactone ring present in sesquiterpene lactones and is dependent on NADPH and molecular oxygen. Incubation of the germacrene acid in the presence of 18O2 resulted in the incorporation of one atom of 18O into (+)-costunolide. The label was situated at the ring oxygen atom. Hence, formation of the lactone ring most likely occurs via C6-hydroxylation of the germacrene acid and subsequent attack of this hydroxyl group at the C12-atom of the carboxyl group. Blue light-reversible CO inhibition and experiments with cytochrome P450 inhibitors demonstrated that the (+)-costunolide synthase is a cytochrome P450 enzyme. In addition, enzymatic conversion of (+)-costunolide into 11(S),13-dihydrocostunolide and leucodin, a guaianolide, was detected. The first-mentioned reaction involves an enoate reductase, whereas the formation of leucodin from (+)-costunolide probably involves more than one enzyme, including a cytochrome P450 enzyme."

12040125,Genetics and assembly line enzymology of siderophore biosynthesis in bacteria.,10.1128/MMBR.66.2.223-249.2002,"The regulatory logic of siderophore biosynthetic genes in bacteria involves the universal repressor Fur, which acts together with iron as a negative regulator. However in other bacteria, in addition to the Fur-mediated mechanism of regulation, there is a concurrent positive regulation of iron transport and siderophore biosynthetic genes that occurs under conditions of iron deprivation. Despite these regulatory differences the mechanisms of siderophore biosynthesis follow the same fundamental enzymatic logic, which involves a series of elongating acyl-S-enzyme intermediates on multimodular protein assembly lines: nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). A substantial variety of siderophore structures are produced from similar NRPS assembly lines, and variation can come in the choice of the phenolic acid selected as the N-cap, the tailoring of amino acid residues during chain elongation, the mode of chain termination, and the nature of the capturing nucleophile of the siderophore acyl chain being released. Of course the specific parts that get assembled in a given bacterium may reflect a combination of the inventory of biosynthetic and tailoring gene clusters available. This modular assembly logic can account for all known siderophores. The ability to mix and match domains within modules and to swap modules themselves is likely to be an ongoing process in combinatorial biosynthesis. NRPS evolution will try out new combinations of chain initiation, elongation and tailoring, and termination steps, possibly by genetic exchange with other microorganisms and/or within the same bacterium, to create new variants of iron-chelating siderophores that can fit a particular niche for the producer bacterium."
12045108,Lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.,10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.110601.135414,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typically consist of a hydrophobic domain known as lipid A (or endotoxin), a nonrepeating ""core"" oligosaccharide, and a distal polysaccharide (or O-antigen). Recent genomic data have facilitated study of LPS assembly in diverse Gram-negative bacteria, many of which are human or plant pathogens, and have established the importance of lateral gene transfer in generating structural diversity of O-antigens. Many enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis like LpxC have been validated as targets for development of new antibiotics. Key genes for lipid A biosynthesis have unexpectedly also been found in higher plants, indicating that eukaryotic lipid A-like molecules may exist. Most significant has been the identification of the plasma membrane protein TLR4 as the lipid A signaling receptor of animal cells. TLR4 belongs to a family of innate immunity receptors that possess a large extracellular domain of leucine-rich repeats, a single trans-membrane segment, and a smaller cytoplasmic signaling region that engages the adaptor protein MyD88. The expanding knowledge of TLR4 specificity and its downstream signaling pathways should provide new opportunities for blocking inflammation associated with infection."

On the one hand, the degradation products of glucosinolates play an important role in the defence of plants against herbivores. On the other hand, these compounds have toxic (e.g. goitrogenic) as well as protective (e.g. cancer-preventing) effects in higher animals and humans. There is a strong interest in the ability to regulate and optimize the levels of individual glucosinolates tissue-specifically to improve the nutritional value and pest resistance of crops. Recent advances in our understanding of glucosinolate biosynthesis have brought us closer to this goal."
12061798,Characterization of substrate specificity of plant FatA and FatB acyl-ACP thioesterases.,10.1016/S0003-9861(02)00017-6,"The specificity of plant acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases is the major determinant of the chain length and level of saturated fatty acids found in most plant tissues. Although these enzymes have been previously characterized from a number of sources, information on kinetic parameters for a wide range of substrates with cloned enzymes is lacking. In the present study the substrate specificity of recombinant FatA thioesterase isoforms from Arabidopsis (AtFatA) and coriander (CsFatA) and FatB from Arabidopsis (AtFatB) have been re-examined with a comprehensive range of substrates including 14:1-ACP and 16:1-ACP. AtFatA displayed the highest catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) towards oleoyl-ACP with activities at least 20-fold lower for all other tested substrates and 75-fold lower with palmitoyl-ACP. Both chain length and double bond presence strongly influenced kcat of FatA with minor influence on Km. Arabidopsis FatB substrate specificity was found to differ from previous reports and this difference could be attributed to the influence of ACP structure. FatB activity with palmitoyl-ACP was 2.5-fold higher and the ratio of 16:0-ACP/14:0-ACP hydrolysis was 6.4-fold higher with spinach ACP compared to E. coli ACP. Additionally, the influence of amino acid domains from both AtFatA and AtFatB on their substrate specificity was studied by utilizing a domain-swapping approach. The characterization of the resulting chimeric enzymes pointed to the N-terminus as a determinant of the substrate specificity for both FatA and FatB acyl-ACP thioesterases."
12084351,Pten signaling in gliomas.,,"In 1997, the PTEN gene (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene on the long arm of chromosome 10. Since then, important progress has been made with respect to the understanding of the role of the Pten protein in the normal development of the brain as well as in the molecular pathogenesis of human gliomas. This review summarizes the current state of the art concerning the involvement of aberrant Pten function in the development of different biologic features of malignant gliomas, such as loss of cell-cycle control and uncontrolled cell proliferation, escape from apoptosis, brain invasion, and aberrant neoangiogenesis. Most of the tumor-suppressive properties of Pten are dependent on its lipid phosphatase activity, which inhibits the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway through dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate. The additional function of Pten as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase may also play a role in glioma pathogenesis. Besides the wealth of data elucidating the functional roles of Pten, recent studies suggest a diagnostic significance of PTEN gene alterations as a molecular marker for poor prognosis in anaplastic astrocytomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Furthermore, the possibility of selective targeting of PTEN mutant tumor cells by specific pharmacologic inhibitors of members of the Pten/PI3K/Akt pathway opens up new perspectives for a targeted molecular therapy of malignant gliomas."
12089320,The final acylation step in taxol biosynthesis: cloning of the taxoid C13-side-chain N-benzoyltransferase from Taxus.,10.1073/pnas.082115799,"The formation of several acyl groups and an amide group of Taxol is catalyzed by regioselective CoA thioester-dependent acyltransferases. Several full-length acyltransferase sequences, obtained from a cDNA library constructed from mRNA isolated from Taxus cuspidata cells induced for Taxol production with methyl jasmonate, were individually expressed in Escherichia coli, from which a cDNA clone encoding a 3'-N-debenzoyl- 2'-deoxytaxol N-benzoyltransferase was identified. This recombinant enzyme catalyzes the stereoselective coupling of the surrogate substrate N-debenzoyl-(3'RS)-2'-deoxytaxol with benzoyl-CoA to form predominantly one 3'-epimer of 2'-deoxytaxol. The product 2'-deoxytaxol was confirmed by radio-HPLC,(1)H-NMR, and chemical ionization-MS. This enzymatic reaction constitutes the final acylation in the Taxol biosynthetic pathway. The full-length cDNA coding for the N-benzoyltransferase has an ORF of 1,323 nucleotides and encodes a 441-residue protein with a calculated molecular weight of 49,040. The recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli has a pH optimum at 8.0, a k(cat) approximately 1.5 +/- 0.3 s(-1) and K(m) values of 0.42 mM and 0.40 mM for the N-deacylated taxoid and benzoyl-CoA, respectively. In addition to improving the production yields of Taxol in genetically engineered host systems, this enzyme provides a means of attaching modified aroyl groups to taxoid precursors for the purpose of improving drug efficacy."

These protein phosphorylation cascades link extracellular stimuli to a wide range of cellular responses. In plants, MAPK cascades are involved in responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses, hormones, cell division and developmental processes. Completion of the Arabidopsis genome-sequencing project has revealed the existence of 20 MAPKs, 10 MAPK kinases and 60 MAPK kinase kinases. Here, we propose a simplified nomenclature for Arabidopsis MAPKs and MAPK kinases that might also serve as a basis for standard annotation of these gene families in all plants."
12136096,Regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis and transport genes in bacteria by transcriptional and translational attenuation.,10.1093/nar/gkf433,"The riboflavin biosynthesis in bacteria was analyzed using comparative analysis of genes, operons and regulatory elements. A model for regulation based on formation of alternative RNA structures involving the RFN elements is suggested. In Gram-positive bacteria including actinomycetes, Thermotoga, Thermus and Deinococcus, the riboflavin metabolism and transport genes are predicted to be regulated by transcriptional attenuation, whereas in most Gram-negative bacteria, the riboflavin biosynthesis genes seem to be regulated on the level of translation initiation. Several new candidate riboflavin transporters were identified (impX in Desulfitobacterium halfniense and Fusobacterium nucleatum; pnuX in several actinomycetes, including some Corynebacterium species and Strepto myces coelicolor; rfnT in Rhizobiaceae). Traces of a number of likely horizontal transfer events were found: the complete riboflavin operon with the upstream regulatory element was transferred to Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae from some Gram-positive bacterium; non-regulated riboflavin operon in Pyrococcus furiousus was likely transferred from Thermotoga; and the RFN element was inserted into the riboflavin operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from some other Pseudomonas species, where it had regulated the ribH2 gene."

This is, in part, a consequence of their location within relatively inaccessible tissues. It is also likely, however, that the unique characteristics of the cells that give rise to these tumours create a set of conditions that facilitate tumour development. Here, we consider recent advances in molecular genetics, the development of mouse models and developmental neurobiology as they relate to tumours of neuroectodermal origin. It is likely that these advances will provide insight into underlying mechanisms and provide a rational framework for the development of effective interventions."
12192541,Autoimmunity in thyroid disease.,10.1007/s00259-002-0848-8,"The autoimmune thyroid diseases, Graves' disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism, represent the two ends of a disease spectrum where an immune response is directed against the thyroid gland. In Graves' disease, antibodies directed against the thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) lead to the development of glandular overactivity, while in autoimmune hypothyroidism, cell-mediated and humoral thyroid injury leads to destruction of thyroid tissue and thyroid hormone deficiency. The mechanisms by which these diseases develop are unknown, although it is likely that both diseases occur in genetically susceptible individuals exposed to a permissive environment. A number of environmental factors have been postulated to be involved in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease. There is, however, no direct evidence to support clear causality. Susceptibility loci within immune response genes have been identified although a significant component of the genetic predisposition to disease remains unknown. This review will focus on some of the studies designed to identify genes that confer susceptibility to the autoimmune disease process within the thyroid gland."

This is particularly noticeable for VacA and CagA, for both of which detailed understanding of the interaction with host signalling pathways has accumulated over the last year. The role of H. pylori Lewis antigens for clinical outcome was further substantiated. Various strategies of H. pylori to fool or evade the human immune system are described, which all lead to the dysfunction of specific compartments of the host cellular immune system. Finally, a number of animal models indicate that inflammation is a key factor for gastric carcinogenesis, which is finally supported by a large prospective study identifying corpus atrophy and intestinal metaplasia as precancerous conditions."
12200473,Common origin and evolution of glycosyltransferases using Dol-P-monosaccharides as donor substrate.,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004208,"On the basis of the analysis of 64 glycosyltransferases from 14 species we propose that several successive duplications of a common ancestral gene, followed by divergent evolution, have generated the mannosyltransferases and the glucosyltransferases involved in asparagine-linked glycosylation (ALG) and phosphatidyl-inositol glycan anchor (PIG or GPI), which use lipid-related donor and acceptor substrates. Long and short conserved peptide motifs were found in all enzymes. Conserved and identical amino acid positions were found for the alpha 2/6- and the alpha 3/4-mannosyltransferases and for the alpha 2/3-glucosyltransferases, suggesting unique ancestors for these three superfamilies. The three members of the alpha 2-mannosyltransferase family (ALG9, PIG-B, and SMP3) and the two members of the alpha 3-glucosyltransferase family (ALG6 and ALG8) shared 11 and 30 identical amino acid positions, respectively, suggesting that these enzymes have also originated by duplication and divergent evolution. This model predicts a common genetic origin for ALG and PIG enzymes using dolichyl-phospho-monosaccharide (Dol-P-monosaccharide) donors, which might be related to similar spatial orientation of the hydroxyl acceptors. On the basis of the multiple sequence analysis and the prediction of transmembrane topology we propose that the endoplasmic reticulum glycosyltransferases using Dol-P-monosaccharides as donor substrate have a multispan transmembrane topology with a first large luminal conserved loop containing the long motif and a small cytosolic conserved loop containing the short motif, different from the classical type II glycosyltransferases, which are anchored in the Golgi by a single transmembrane domain."
12215643,Identification of a DNA nonhomologous end-joining complex in bacteria.,10.1126/science.1074584,"In eukaryotic cells, double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are generally repaired by the pathway of homologous recombination or by DNA nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Both pathways have been highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution, but no equivalent NHEJ system has been identified in prokaryotes. The NHEJ pathway requires a DNA end-binding component called Ku. We have identified bacterial Ku homologs and show that these proteins retain the biochemical characteristics of the eukaryotic Ku heterodimer. Furthermore, we show that bacterial Ku specifically recruits DNA ligase to DNA ends and stimulates DNA ligation. Loss of these proteins leads to hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation in Bacillus subtilis. These data provide evidence that many bacteria possess a DNA DSB repair apparatus that shares many features with the NHEJ system of eukarya and suggest that this DNA repair pathway arose before the prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages diverged."
12269807,Multistate binding in pyridoxine 5'-phosphate synthase: 1.96 A crystal structure in complex with 1-deoxy-D-xylulose phosphate.,10.1021/bi026292t,"We report the 1.96 A crystal structure of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate synthase (PdxJ) in complex with 1-deoxy-D-xylulose phosphate (dXP). The octameric enzyme possesses eight distinct binding sites, and three different binding states are observed. The observation of these three states supports a mechanism in which precise conformational changes of a peptide loop and groups of active site residues modulate binding and specificity. The differences in protein conformation when one or two substrates are bound can be correlated with a condensation mechanism that leads productively to the formation of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP). ""Snapshots"" of the progression from the apo form to a singly occupied ""transitional binding"" state and, subsequently, to a fully occupied, reactive state are revealed and indicate how the enzyme structure can be related to a plausible catalytic mechanism and, moreover, to favorable energetics of reaction."
12270949,Molecular mechanisms of inherited cardiomyopathies.,10.1152/physrev.00012.2002,"Cardiomyopathies are diseases of heart muscle that may result from a diverse array of conditions that damage the heart and other organs and impair myocardial function, including infection, ischemia, and toxins. However, they may also occur as primary diseases restricted to striated muscle. Over the past decade, the importance of inherited gene defects in the pathogenesis of primary cardiomyopathies has been recognized, with mutations in some 18 genes having been identified as causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and/or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Defining the role of these genes in cardiac function and the mechanisms by which mutations in these genes lead to hypertrophy, dilation, and contractile failure are major goals of ongoing research. Pathophysiological mechanisms that have been implicated in HCM and DCM include the following: defective force generation, due to mutations in sarcomeric protein genes; defective force transmission, due to mutations in cytoskeletal protein genes; myocardial energy deficits, due to mutations in ATP regulatory protein genes; and abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis, due to altered availability of Ca2+ and altered myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity. Improved understanding that will result from these studies should ultimately lead to new approaches for the diagnosis, prognostic stratification, and treatment of patients with heart failure."
12358600,Sulphoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase yields acetyl phosphate: purification from Alcaligenes defragrans and gene clusters in taurine degradation.,10.1042/BJ20021455,"The facultatively anaerobic bacterium Alcaligenes defragrans NKNTAU was found to oxidize taurine (2-aminoethanesulphonate) with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Taurine was transaminated to 2-sulphoacetaldehyde. This was not converted into sulphite and acetate by a ""sulphoacetaldehyde sulpho-lyase"" (EC 4.4.1.12), but into sulphite and acetyl phosphate, which was identified by three methods. The enzyme, which required the addition of phosphate, thiamin diphosphate and Mg(2+) ions for activity, was renamed sulphoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase (Xsc; EC 2.3.1.-). Inducible Xsc was expressed at high levels, and a three-step 11-fold purification yielded an essentially homogeneous soluble protein, which was a homotetramer in its native form; the molecular mass of the subunit was found to be between about 63 kDa (SDS/PAGE) and 65.3 kDa (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS). The N-terminal and two internal amino acid sequences were determined, and PCR primers were generated. The xsc gene was amplified and sequenced; the derived molecular mass of the processed protein was 65.0 kDa. The downstream gene presumably encoded the inducible phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta) found in crude extracts. The desulphonative enzymes (""EC 4.4.1.12"") from Achromobacter xylosoxidans NCIMB 10751 and Desulfonispora thiosulfatigenes GKNTAU were shown to be Xscs. We detected at least three subclasses of xsc in Proteobacteria and in Gram-positive bacteria, and they comprised a distinct group within the acetohydroxyacid synthase supergene family. Genome sequencing data revealed xsc genes in Burkholderia fungorum (80% sequence identity) and Sinorhizobium meliloti (61%) with closely linked pta genes. Different patterns of regulation for the transport and dissimilation of taurine were hypothesized for S. meliloti and B. fungorum."

The intrathymic developmental pathway of human alphabeta T cells has now been delineated. The production of new T cells by the thymus decreases with age, and the thymus was thought to be redundant in adults once the peripheral T-cell pool has been formed early in life. However, recent work has shown that the thymus can function even at an advanced age. Research into the production of T cells in clinical settings that are associated with loss of T cells in the periphery has sparked renewed interest in the function of the human thymus."
12360215,Regulation of mast-cell and basophil function and survival by IgE.,10.1038/nri914,"Mast cells and basophils are important effector cells in T helper 2 (T(H)2)-cell-dependent, immunoglobulin-E-associated allergic disorders and immune responses to parasites. The crosslinking of IgE that is bound to the high-affinity receptor Fc epsilon RI with multivalent antigen results in the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI and the secretion of products that can have effector, immunoregulatory or autocrine effects. This response can be enhanced markedly in cells that have been exposed to high levels of IgE, which results in the increased surface expression of Fc epsilon RI. Moreover, recent work indicates that monomeric IgE (in the absence of crosslinking) can render mast cells resistant to apoptosis induced by growth-factor deprivation in vitro and, under certain circumstances, can induce the release of cytokines. So, the binding of IgE to Fc epsilon RI might influence mast-cell and basophil survival directly or indirectly, and can also regulate cellular function."
12368465,Methyltransferase genes in Streptomyces rishiriensis: new coumermycin derivatives from gene-inactivation experiments.,10.1099/00221287-148-10-3317,"The coumarin antibiotic coumermycin A(1) contains at least eight methyl groups, presumably derived from S-adenosylmethionine. Two putative methyltransferase genes, couO and couP, of the coumermycin A(1) biosynthetic gene cluster were inactivated by in-frame deletion. In the resulting mutants, coumermycin A(1) production was abolished. New coumermycin derivatives were accumulated instead, and were identified by HPLC-MS using selected reaction monitoring via electrospray ionization. couO mutants accumulated a coumermycin derivative lacking the methyl groups at C-8 of the characteristic aminocoumarin rings, whereas in the couP mutant a coumermycin derivative lacking the methyl groups at the 4-hydroxyl groups of the two deoxysugar moieties was identified. These results provided evidence that couO encodes a C-methyltransferase responsible for the transfer of a methyl group to C-8 of the aminocoumarin ring, and couP an O-methyltransferase for methylation of 4-OH of the sugar in the biosynthesis of coumermycin A(1), respectively. C-methylation of the aminocoumarin ring is considered as an early step of coumermycin biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the intermediates with the non-methylated aminocoumarin ring were accepted by the enzymes catalysing the subsequent steps of the pathway. The new, demethylated secondary metabolites were produced in an amount at least as high as that of coumermycin A(1) in the wild-type."
12391145,Sphingosine kinase mediates vascular endothelial growth factor-induced activation of ras and mitogen-activated protein kinases.,10.1128/MCB.22.22.7758-7768.2002,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is critical to the processes of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Here, evidence is presented for VEGF stimulation of sphingosine kinase (SPK) that affects not only endothelial cell signaling but also tumor cells expressing VEGF receptors. VEGF or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of the T24 bladder tumor cell line resulted in a time- and dose-dependent stimulation of SPK activity. In T24 cells, VEGF treatment reduced cellular sphingosine levels while raising that of sphingosine-1-phosphate. VEGF stimulation of T24 cells caused a slow and sustained accumulation of Ras-GTP and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (phospho-ERK) compared with that after EGF treatment. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets SPK1, but not SPK2, blocks VEGF-induced accumulation of Ras-GTP and phospho-ERK in T24 cells. In contrast to EGF stimulation, VEGF stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was unaffected by dominant-negative Ras-N17. Raf kinase inhibition blocked both VEGF- and EGF-stimulated accumulation of phospho-ERK1/2. Inhibition of SPK by pharmacological inhibitors, a dominant-negative SPK mutant, or siRNA that targets SPK blocked VEGF, but not EGF, induction of phospho-ERK1/2. We conclude that VEGF induces DNA synthesis in a pathway which sequentially involves protein kinase C (PKC), SPK, Ras, Raf, and ERK1/2. These data highlight a novel mechanism by which SPK mediates signaling from PKC to Ras in a manner independent of Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factor."
12397359,Dec1 and Dec2 are regulators of the mammalian molecular clock.,10.1038/nature01123,"The circadian rhythms in mammals are regulated by a pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Four clock-gene families have been found to be involved in a transcription-translation feedback loop that generates the circadian rhythm at the intracellular level. The proteins Clock and Bmal1 form a heterodimer which activates the transcription of the Per gene from the E-box elements in its promoter region. Protein products of Per act together with Cry proteins to inhibit Per transcription, thus closing the autoregulatory feedback loop. We found that Dec1 and Dec2, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, repressed Clock/Bmal1-induced transactivation of the mouse Per1 promoter through direct protein-protein interactions with Bmal1 and/or competition for E-box elements. Dec1 and Dec2 are expressed in the suprachiasmic nucleus in a circadian fashion, with a peak in the subjective day. A brief light pulse induced Dec1 but not Dec2 expression in the suprachiasmic nucleus in a phase-dependent manner. Dec1 and Dec2 are regulators of the mammalian molecular clock, and form a fifth clock-gene family."

Strain TCA1 required H2 as an electron donor and TCA as an electron acceptor for growth, indicating that dechlorination is a respiratory process.

12420173,"Genes involved in the anaerobic degradation of ethylbenzene in a denitrifying bacterium, strain EbN1.",10.1007/s00203-002-0487-2,"Genes involved in anaerobic degradation of the petroleum hydrocarbon ethylbenzene in the denitrifying Azoarcus-like strain EbN1 were identified on a 56-kb DNA contig obtained from shotgun sequencing. Ethylbenzene is first oxidized via ethylbenzene dehydrogenase to (S)-1-phenylethanol; this is converted by (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase to acetophenone. Further degradation probably involves acetophenone carboxylase forming benzoylacetate, a ligase forming benzoylacetyl-CoA, and a thiolase forming acetyl-CoA and benzoyl-CoA. Genes of this pathway were identified via N-terminal sequences of proteins isolated from strain EbN1 and by sequence similarities to proteins from other bacteria. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is encoded by three genes (ebdABC), in accordance with the heterotrimeric enzyme structure. Binding domains for a molybdenum cofactor (in subunit EbdA) and iron/sulfur-clusters (in subunits EbdA and EbdB) were identified. The previously observed periplasmic location of the enzyme was corroborated by the presence of a twin-arginine leader peptide characteristic of the Tat system for protein export. A fourth gene (ebdD) was identified, the product of which may act as an enzyme-specific chaperone in the maturation of the molybdenum-containing subunit. A distinct gene (ped) coding for (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase apparently forms an operon with the ebdABCD genes. The ped gene product with its characteristic NAD(P)-binding motif in the N-terminal domain belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. A further operon apparently contains five genes (apc1-5) suggested to code for subunits of acetophenone carboxylase. Four of the five gene products are similar to subunits of acetone carboxylase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus. Upstream of the apc genes, a single gene (bal) was identified which possibly codes for a benzoylacetate CoA-ligase and which is co-transcribed with the apc genes. In addition, an apparent operon containing almost all genes required for beta-oxidation of fatty acids was detected; one of the gene products may be involved in thiolytic cleavage of benzoylacetyl-CoA. The DNA fragment also included genes for regulatory systems; these were two sets of two-component systems, two LysR homologs, and a TetR homolog. Some of these proteins may be involved in ethylbenzene-dependent gene expression."
12423366,Molecular cloning of columbamine O-methyltransferase from cultured Coptis japonica cells.,10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03275.x,"To identify all of the O-methyltransferase genes involved in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis in Coptis japonica cells, we sequenced 1014 cDNA clones isolated from high-alkaloid-producing cultured cells of C. japonica. Among them, we found all three reported O-methyltransferases and an O-methyltransferase-like cDNA clone (CJEST64). This cDNA was quite similar to S-adenosyl-l-methionine:coclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl-l-methionine:isoflavone 7-O-methyltransferase. As S-adenosyl-l-methionine:columbamine O-methyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of columbamine to palmatine, is one of the remaining unelucidated components in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis in C. japonica, we heterologously expressed the protein in Escherichia coli and examined the activity of columbamine O-methyltransferase. The recombinant protein clearly showed O-methylation activity using columbamine, as well as (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine, (S)-, (R,S)-scoulerine and (R,S)-2,3,9,10-tetrahydroxyprotoberberine as substrates. This result clearly indicated that EST analysis was useful for isolating the candidate gene in a relatively well-characterized biosynthetic pathway. The relationship between the structure and substrate recognition of the O-methyltransferases involved in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, and a reconsideration of the biosynthetic pathway to palmatine are discussed."
12431977,Membrane topography of human phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase.,10.1074/jbc.M210904200,"In liver, phosphatidylethanolamine is converted to phosphatidylcholine through a series of three sequential methylation reactions. Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes each transmethylation reaction, and S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl group donor. Biochemical analysis of human liver revealed that the methyltransferase activity is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes. Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence suggested that the enzyme adopts a polytopic conformation in those membranes. To elucidate the precise membrane topography of PEMT and thereby provide the basis for in-depth functional characterization of the enzyme, we performed endoproteinase-protection analysis of epitope-tagged, recombinant protein. Our data suggest a topographical model of PEMT in which four transmembrane regions span the membrane such that both the N and C termini of the enzyme are localized external to the ER. Two hydrophilic connecting loops protrude into the luminal space of the microsomes whereas a corresponding loop on the cytosolic side remains proximate to the membrane. Further support for this model was obtained following endoproteinase-protection analysis of mutant recombinant PEMT derivatives in which specific protease cleavage sites had been genetically engineered or ablated."
12436260,Genetic analysis of the biosynthesis of the pyrrole and carbamoyl moieties of coumermycin A1 and novobiocin.,10.1007/s00438-002-0759-1,"The aminocoumarin antibiotic coumermycin A(1) contains a central and two terminal pyrrole moieties. The coumermycin gene cluster in Streptomyces rishiriensis contains three genes (couN3, couN4 and couN5) that show sequence similarity to genes involved in the biosynthesis of the pyrrole moieties of pyoluteorin in Pseudomonas fluorescens and of undecylprodiginine in S. coelicolor. The gene couN3, which codes for a putative L-prolyl-S-PCP dehydrogenase, and the gene couN4, which encodes a putative L-prolyl-AMP ligase, were disrupted using in-frame deletion and insertional inactivation, respectively. HPLC analysis of culture extracts showed that formation of the two terminal pyrrole moieties was abolished in the couN3 (-) und couN4 (-) mutants. The mutants accumulated coumermycin D, which contains only the central pyrrole moiety. This result not only confirmed the involvement of couN3 and couN4 in the biosynthesis of the terminal pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moieties of coumermycin A(1), but also indicated, for the first time, that the central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid unit of the coumermycins is formed by a biosynthetic pathway that differs from that used to assemble the terminal pyrrole moieties. novN, a putative carbamoyl transferase gene from the gene cluster for novobiocin biosynthesis in S. spheroides was expressed in the couN3 (-) mutant. This led to the formation of bis-carbamoylated coumermycin D, a novel compound of the coumermycin series."
12450109,Molecular bases of aerobic bacterial degradation of dioxins: involvement of angular dioxygenation.,10.1271/bbb.66.2001,"In the last decade, extensive investigation has been done on the bacterial degradation of dioxins and its related compounds, because this class of chemicals is highly toxic and has been widely distributed in the environment. These studies have revealed the primary importance of a novel dioxygenation reaction, called angular dioxygenation, in the aerobic bacterial degradation pathway of dioxin. Accompanied by the electron transport proteins, Rieske nonheme iron oxygenase catalyzes the incorporation of oxygen atoms to the ether bond-carrying carbon (the angular position) and an adjacent carbon, resulting in the irreversible cleavage of the recalcitrant aryl ether bond. The 2,2',3-trihydroxybiphenyl or 2,2',3-trihydroxydiphenyl ether derivatives formed are degraded through meta cleavage. In addition to the degradation system of dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin (the nonchlorinated model compounds of dioxin), those of fluorene and carbazole were shown to function in dioxin degradation. Some dioxin degradation pathways have been studied biochemically and genetically. In addition, feasibility studies have shown that some dioxin-degrading strains can function in actual dioxin-contaminated soil. These studies provide useful information for the establishment of a bioremediation method for dioxin contamination. This review summarizes recent progress on molecular and biochemical bases of the bacterial aerobic degradation of dioxin and related compounds."
12471498,Dissimilation of the C2 sulfonates.,10.1007/s00203-002-0497-0,"Organosulfonates are widespread in the environment, both as natural products and as xenobiotics; and they generally share the property of chemical stability. A wide range of phenomena has evolved in microorganisms able to utilize the sulfur or the carbon moiety of these compounds; and recent work has centered on bacteria. This Mini-Review centers on bacterial catabolism of the carbon moiety in the C2-sulfonates and the fate of the sulfonate group. Five of the six compounds examined are subject to catabolism, but information on the molecular nature of transport and regulation is based solely on sequencing data. Two mechanisms of desulfonation have been established. First, there is the specific monooxygenation of ethanesulfonate or ethane-1,2-disulfonate. Second, the oxidative, reductive and fermentative modes of catabolism tend to yield the intermediate sulfoacetaldehyde, which is now known to be desulfonated to acetyl phosphate by a thiamin-diphosphate-dependent acetyltransferase. This enzyme is widespread and at least three subgroups can be recognized, some of them in genomic sequencing projects. These data emphasize the importance of acetyl phosphate in bacterial metabolism. A third mechanism of desulfonation is suggested: the hydrolysis of sulfoacetate."
12480894,Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster: new insights into the biosynthesis of aminocoumarin antibiotics.,10.1099/00221287-148-12-3901,"The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin was cloned by screening of a cosmid library of Streptomyces roseochromogenes DS 12.976 with two heterologous probes from the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis revealed 27 ORFs with striking similarity to the biosynthetic gene clusters of novobiocin and coumermycin A(1). Inactivation of a putative aldolase gene, cloR, by in-frame deletion led to the abolishment of the production of clorobiocin. Feeding of the mutant with 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (Ring A of clorobiocin) restored clorobiocin production. Here, it is suggested that the formation of Ring A of clorobiocin may proceed via a retro-aldol reaction catalysed by CloR, i.e. by a mechanism different from the previously elucidated benzoic acid biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces maritimus. A comparison of the gene clusters for clorobiocin, novobiocin and coumermycin A(1) showed that the structural differences between the three antibiotics were reflected remarkably well by differences in the organization of their respective biosynthetic gene clusters."
12482447,A flavonol O-methyltransferase from Catharanthus roseus performing two sequential methylations.,10.1016/s0031-9422(02)00483-1,"Protein extracts from dark-grown cell suspension cultures of Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) contained several O-methyltransferase (OMT) activities, including the 16-hydroxytabersonine O-methyltransferase (16HT-OMT) in indole alkaloid biosynthesis. This enzyme was enriched through several purification steps, including affinity chromatography on adenosine agarose. SDS-PAGE of the purified protein preparation revealed a protein band at the size expected for plant OMTs (38-43 kDa). Mass spectrometry indicated two dominant protein species of similar mass in this band, and sequences of tryptic peptides showed similarities to known OMTs. Homology-based RT-PCR identified cDNAs for four new OMTs. Two of these cDNAs (CrOMT2 and CrOMT4) encoded the proteins dominant in the preparation enriched for 16HT-OMT. The proteins were closely related (73% identity), but both shared only 48-53% identity with the closest relatives found in the public databases. The enzyme functions were investigated with purified recombinant proteins after cDNA expression in Escherichia coli. Unexpectedly, both proteins had no detectable 16HT-OMT activity, and CrOMT4 was inactive with all substrates investigated. CrOMT2 was identified as a flavonoid OMT that was expressed in dark-grown cell cultures and copurified with 16HT-OMT. It represented a new type of OMT that performs two sequential methylations at the 3'- and 5'-positions of the B-ring in myricetin (flavonol) and dihydromyricetin (dihydroflavonol). The resulting methylation pattern is characteristic for C. roseus flavonol glycosides and anthocyanins, and it is proposed that CrOMT2 is involved in their biosynthesis."
12483604,Bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds via angular dioxygenation.,10.2323/jgam.47.279,"Dioxygenation is one of the important initial reactions of the bacterial degradation of various aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds, such as biphenyl, toluene, and naphthalene, are dioxygenated at lateral positions of the aromatic ring resulting in the formation of cis-dihydrodiol. This ""normal"" type of dioxygenation is termed lateral dioxygenation. On the other hand, the analysis of the bacterial degradation of fluorene (FN) analogues, such as 9-fluorenone, dibenzofuran (DF), carbazole (CAR), and dibenzothiophene (DBT)-sulfone, and DF-related diaryl ether compounds, dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD) and diphenyl ether (DE), revealed the presence of the novel mode of dioxygenation reaction for aromatic nucleus, generally termed angular dioxygenation. In this atypical dioxygenation, the carbon bonded to the carbonyl group in 9-fluorenone or to heteroatoms in the other compounds, and the adjacent carbon in the aromatic ring are both oxidized. Angular dioxygenation of DF, CAR, DBT-sulfone, DD, and DE produces the chemically unstable hemiacetal-like intermediates, which are spontaneously converted to 2,2',3-trihydroxybiphenyl, 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol, 2',3'-dihydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate, 2,2',3-trihydroxydiphenyl ether, and phenol and catechol, respectively. Thus, angular dioxygenation for these compounds results in the cleavage of the three-ring structure or DE structure. The angular dioxygenation product of 9-fluorenone, 1-hydro-1,1a-dihydroxy-9-fluorenone is a chemically stable cis-diol, and is enzymatically transformed to 2'-carboxy-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. 2'-Substituted 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyls formed by angular dioxygenation of FN analogues are degraded to monocyclic aromatic compounds by meta cleavage and hydrolysis. Thus, after the novel angular dioxygenation, subsequent degradation pathways are homologous to the corresponding part of that of biphenyl. Compared to the bacterial strains capable of catalyzing lateral dioxygenation, few bacteria having angular dioxygenase have been reported. Only a few degradation pathways, CAR-degradation pathway of Pseudomonas resinovorans strain CA10, DF/DD-degradation pathway of Sphingomonas wittichii strain RW1, DF/DD/FN-degradation pathway of Terrabacter sp. strain DBF63, and carboxylated DE-degradation pathway of P. pseudoalcaligenes strain POB310, have been investigated at the gene level. As a result of the phylogenetic analysis and the comparison of substrate specificity of angular dioxygenase, it is suggested that this atypical mode of dioxygenation is one of the oxygenation reactions originating from the relaxed substrate specificity of the Rieske nonheme iron oxygenase superfamily. Genetic characterization of the degradation pathways of these compounds suggests the possibility that the respective genetic elements constituting the entire catabolic pathway have been recruited from various other bacteria and/or other genetic loci, and that these pathways have not evolutionary matured."
12486701,Genetic analysis of the circadian system in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals.,10.1002/neu.10164,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been a grateful object for circadian rhythm researchers over several decades. Behavioral, genetic, and molecular studies helped to reveal the genetic bases of circadian time keeping and rhythmic behaviors. Contrary, mammalian rhythm research until recently was mainly restricted to descriptive and physiologic approaches. As in many other areas of research, the surprising similarity of basic biologic principles between the little fly and our own species, boosted the progress of unraveling the genetic foundation of mammalian clock mechanisms. Once more, not only the basic mechanisms, but also the molecules involved in establishing our circadian system are taken or adapted from the fly. This review will try to give a comparative overview about the two systems, highlighting similarities as well as specifics of both insect and murine clocks."
12501294,"Cloning and nucleotide sequence of carbazole catabolic genes from Pseudomonas stutzeri strain OM1, isolated from activated sludge.",10.2323/jgam.44.57,"A new carbazole (CAR)-degrading bacterium, called strain OM1, was isolated from activated sludge obtained from sewage disposal plants in Fukuoka Prefecture, and it was identified as Pseudomonas stutzeri. Anthranilic acid (AN), 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol and its meta-cleavage product, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2'-aminophenyl)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid, were identified as metabolic intermediates of CAR in the ethyl acetate extract of the culture broth. Therefore, the CAR catabolic pathway to AN in strain OM1 was indicated to be identical to those found in the Pseudomonas sp. strains CA06 and CA10. The strain OM1 degraded catechol (CAT) via a meta-cleavage pathway in contrast to strains CA06 and CA10, which transform catechol into cis, cis-munonic acid. Clones containing a 6.9-kb EcoRI fragment and a 3-kb PstI-SphI fragment were isolated from colonies, forming a clear zone of CAR and a yellow ring-cleavage product from CAT, respectively. Recombinant E. coli carrying the 6.9-kb fragment degraded CAR in the L-broth and produced AN. Cell-free extract from the clone carrying a 3-kb PstI-SphI fragment had high meta-ring-cleavage dioxygenase activity for CAT. The nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined. The 6.9-kb fragment showed a very high degree of homology with the CAR catabolic genes of strain CA10. The amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the 3-kb fragment were found to exhibit significant homology with the genes for the CAT-catabolic enzymes of TOL plasmid pWW0, plasmid NAH7, and plasmid pVI150."

12511560,"Beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta 4GalT)-IV is specific for GlcNAc 6-O-sulfate. Beta 4GalT-IV acts on keratan sulfate-related glycans and a precursor glycan of 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X.",10.1074/jbc.M211480200,"The Galbeta1-->4(SO(3)(-)-->6)GlcNAc moiety is present in various N-linked and O-linked glycans including keratan sulfate and 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X, an L-selectin ligand. We previously found beta1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT) activity in human colonic mucosa, which prefers GlcNAc 6-O-sulfate (6SGN) as an acceptor to non-substituted GlcNAc (Seko, A., Hara-Kuge, S., Nagata, K., Yonezawa, S., and Yamashita, K. (1998) FEBS Lett. 440, 307-310). To identify the gene for this enzyme, we purified the enzyme from porcine colonic mucosa. The purified enzyme had the characteristic requirement of basic lipids for catalytic activity. Analysis of the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme revealed that the purified beta4GalT has a similar sequence to human beta4GalT-IV. To confirm this result, we prepared cDNA for each of the seven beta4GalTs cloned to date and examined substrate specificities using the membrane fractions derived from beta4GalT-transfected COS-7 cells. When using several N-linked and O-linked glycans with or without 6SGN residues as acceptor substrates, only beta4GalT-IV efficiently recognized 6SGN, keratan sulfate-related oligosaccharides, and Galbeta1-->3(SO(3)(-)-->6GlcNAcbeta1-->6) GalNAcalpha1-O-pNP, a precursor for 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X. These results suggested that beta4GalT-IV is a 6SGN-specific beta4GalT and may be involved in the biosynthesis of various glycoproteins carrying a 6-O-sulfated N-acetyllactosamine moiety."

In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the sites, mechanisms and functions of intestinal IgA synthesis in mice. On the basis of these recent findings, we propose an updated model for the induction and regulation of IgA responses in the gut. In addition, we discuss new insights into the role of IgA in the maintenance of gut homeostasis and into the reciprocal interactions between gut B cells and the bacterial flora."
12516863,Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription.,10.1023/a:1021258713850,"Specific transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II at eukaryotic protein-coding genes involves the cooperative assembly at the core promoter of more than 40 distinct proteins--with a total mass of over 2 MDa--including RNA polymerase II itself and general/basal transcription initiation factors, to form a stable pre-initiation complex (PIC). In vivo, PIC assembly is a major point of regulation by sequence-specific transcription regulators (activators and repressors) and is hindered by the packaging of promoter DNA into nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures. Genetic and biochemical studies have recently identified a variety of transcription cofactors/co-regulators (coactivators and corepressors) that interact with sequence-specific regulators and/or various components of the general/basal transcription machinery and are essential for regulated transcription. An emerging view from these studies is that regulators must target two types of transcription cofactors: chromatin-modifying/remodeling cofactors and general cofactors that associate with and/or influence the activities of components of the general/basal transcription machinery. The recent biochemical identification and characterization of many different chromatin-modifying and general transcription cofactors has revealed their often complex multi-subunit nature and a previously unsuspected level of structural and functional redundancy. Another emerging theme is the multi-functional nature of chromatin-modifying cofactor complexes that appear to couple gene-specific transcription to other cellular processes."
12518017,The application of computational methods to explore the diversity and structure of bacterial fatty acid synthase.,10.1194/jlr.r200016-jlr200,"Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a central element in the bacterial, type II dissociated fatty acid synthase (FAS II) system. ACP delivers the fatty acyl intermediates to a variety of enzymes with different biochemical functions and 3-dimensional (3-D) structures. Computational techniques have proved invaluable in guiding the experimental designs that have uncovered the recognition helix on ACP and the common features on its target enzymes responsible for specific protein*protein interactions. Escherichia coli has been the model organism for the study of FAS II, but the availability of complete genomic sequences of a growing number of bacteria coupled with computational bioinformatics has led to new discoveries on the mechanisms that regulate E. coli FAS II and allowed the differences between the E. coli paradigm and major groups of pathogens to be identified and experimentally addressed. Computational methods facilitated the discovery of the E. coli fatty acid synthesis transcriptional regulator, FabR, and led to the identification of novel bacterial FAS II proteins in Gram-positive pathogens, including enoyl-ACP reductases (FabK and FabL) and trans-2-cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase FabM. As more genomic sequences and 3-D coordinates are added to the databases, the power and resolution of the computational approaches will increase to offer deeper insight into the structure, diversity and function of lipid metabolic pathways."
12518057,Crystal structure of oxygen-evolving photosystem II from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus at 3.7-A resolution.,10.1073/pnas.0135651100,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a multisubunit membrane protein complex performing light-induced electron transfer and water-splitting reactions, leading to the formation of molecular oxygen. The first crystal structure of PSII from a thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus was reported recently [Zouni, A., Witt, H. T., Kern, J., Fromme, P., Krauss, N., Saenger, W. & Orth, P. (2001) Nature 409, 739-743)] at 3.8-A resolution. To analyze the PSII structure in more detail, we have obtained the crystal structure of PSII from another thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, at 3.7-A resolution. The present structure was built on the basis of the sequences of PSII large subunits D1, D2, CP47, and CP43; extrinsic 33- and 12-kDa proteins and cytochrome c550; and several low molecular mass subunits, among which the structure of the 12-kDa protein was not reported previously. This yielded much information concerning the molecular interactions within this large protein complex. We also show the arrangement of chlorophylls and cofactors, including two beta-carotenes recently identified in a region close to the reaction center, which provided important clues to the secondary electron transfer pathways around the reaction center. Furthermore, possible ligands for the Mn-cluster were determined. In particular, the C terminus of D1 polypeptide was shown to be connected to the Mn cluster directly. The structural information obtained here provides important insights into the mechanism of PSII reactions."
12529536,Organ-specific expression of brassinosteroid-biosynthetic genes and distribution of endogenous brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis.,10.1104/pp.013029,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroidal plant hormones that are essential for growth and development. There is only limited information on where BRs are synthesized and used. We studied the organ specificity of BR biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, using two different approaches: We analyzed the expression of BR-related genes using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and analyzed endogenous BRs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Before starting this study, we cloned the second BR-6-oxidase (BR6ox2) gene from Arabidopsis and found that the encoded enzyme has the same substrate specificity as the enzyme encoded by the previously isolated 6-oxidase gene (BR6ox1) of Arabidopsis. Endogenous BRs and the expression of BR-related genes were detected in all organs tested. The highest level of endogenous BRs and the highest expression of the BR6ox1, BR6ox2, and DWF4 genes were observed in apical shoots, which contain actively developing tissues. These genes are important in BR biosynthesis because they encode the rate-limiting or farthest downstream enzyme in the BR biosynthesis pathway. The second highest level of endogenous BRs and expression of BR6ox1 and DWF4 were observed in siliques, which contains actively developing embryos and seeds. These findings indicate that BRs are synthesized in all organs tested, but are most actively synthesized in young, actively developing organs. In contrast, synthesis was limited in mature organs. Our observations are consistent with the idea that BRs function as the growth-promoting hormone in plants."
12535077,A new Escherichia coli metabolic competency: growth on fatty acids by a novel anaerobic beta-oxidation pathway.,10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03341.x,"Escherichia coli uses fatty acids as a sole carbon and energy source during aerobic growth by means of the enzymes encoded by the fad regulon. We report that this bacterium can also grow on fatty acids under anaerobic conditions provided that a terminal respiratory electron acceptor such as nitrate is available. This anaerobic utilization pathway is distinct from the well-studied aerobic pathway in that (i). it proceeds normally in mutant strains lacking various enzymes of the aerobic pathway; (ii). it functions with fatty acids (octanoate and decanoate) that cannot be used by wild-type E. coli strains under aerobic conditions; and (iii). super-repressor mutants of the fadR regulatory locus that block aerobic growth on fatty acids fail to block the anaerobic pathway. We have identified homologues of the FadA, FadB and FadD proteins required for aerobic fatty acid utilization called YfcY, YfcX and YdiD, respectively, which are involved in anaerobic growth on fatty acids. A strong FadR binding site was detected upstream of the yfcY gene consistent with microarray analyses, indicating that yfcYX expression is negatively regulated by FadR under aerobic growth conditions. In contrast, transcriptional regulation of ydiD appears to be independent of FadR, and anaerobic growth on fatty acids is not under FadR control. These three genes are conserved in the available genome sequences of pathogenic E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella strains."
12543708,"The enzymes, regulation, and genetics of bile acid synthesis.",10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161712,"The synthesis and excretion of bile acids comprise the major pathway of cholesterol catabolism in mammals. Synthesis provides a direct means of converting cholesterol, which is both hydrophobic and insoluble, into a water-soluble and readily excreted molecule, the bile acid. The biosynthetic steps that accomplish this transformation also confer detergent properties to the bile acid, which are exploited by the body to facilitate the secretion of cholesterol from the liver. This role in the elimination of cholesterol is counterbalanced by the ability of bile acids to solubilize dietary cholesterol and essential nutrients and to promote their delivery to the liver. The synthesis of a full complement of bile acids requires 17 enzymes. The expression of selected enzymes in the pathway is tightly regulated by nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors, which ensure a constant supply of bile acids in an ever changing metabolic environment. Inherited mutations that impair bile acid synthesis cause a spectrum of human disease; this ranges from liver failure in early childhood to progressive neuropathy in adults."
12566218,"Connexins, gap junctional intercellular communication and kinases.",10.1016/s0248-4900(02)00014-x,"A number of kinases and signal transduction pathways are known to affect gap junctional intercellular communication and/or phosphorylation of connexins. Most of the information is available for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the tyrosine kinase Src. Much less is known for protein kinase G, Ca(2+)-calmodulin dependent protein kinase, and casein kinase. However, the present lack of knowledge is not necessarily synonymous with lack of importance in the regulation of intercellular communication and phosphorylation of connexins. Kinases and the phosphorylation of connexins may be involved in the regulation of gap junctional intercellular communication at all levels ranging from the expression of connexin genes to the degradation of the gap junction channels. The exact role of the phosphorylation depends both on the kinase and the connexin involved, as well as the cellular context."
12571226,Mechanistic and mutational studies of Escherichia coli molybdopterin synthase clarify the final step of molybdopterin biosynthesis.,10.1074/jbc.M300453200,"Biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor, a chelate of molybdenum or tungsten with a novel pterin, occurs in virtually all organisms including humans. In the cofactor, the metal is complexed to the unique cis-dithiolene moiety located on the pyran ring of molybdopterin. Escherichia coli molybdopterin synthase, the protein responsible for adding the dithiolene to a desulfo precursor termed precursor Z, is a dimer of dimers containing the MoaD and MoaE proteins. The sulfur used for dithiolene formation is carried in the form of a thiocarboxylate at the MoaD C terminus. Using an intein expression system for preparation of thiocarboxylated MoaD, the mechanism of the molybdopterin synthase reaction was examined. A stoichiometry of 2 molecules of thiocarboxylated MoaD per conversion of a single precursor Z molecule to molybdopterin was observed. Examination of several synthase variants bearing mutations in the MoaE subunit identified Lys-119 as a residue essential for activity and Arg-39 and Lys-126 as other residues critical for the reaction. An intermediate of the synthase reaction was identified and characterized. This intermediate remains tightly associated with the protein and is the predominant product formed by synthase containing the K126A variant of MoaE. Mass spectral data obtained from protein-bound intermediate are consistent with a monosulfurated structure that contains a terminal phosphate group similar to that present in molybdopterin."
12581523,"vrille, Pdp1, and dClock form a second feedback loop in the Drosophila circadian clock.",10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00074-6,"The Drosophila circadian clock consists of two interlocked transcriptional feedback loops. In one loop, dCLOCK/CYCLE activates period expression, and PERIOD protein then inhibits dCLOCK/CYCLE activity. dClock is also rhythmically transcribed, but its regulators are unknown. vrille (vri) and Par Domain Protein 1 (Pdp1) encode related transcription factors whose expression is directly activated by dCLOCK/CYCLE. We show here that VRI and PDP1 proteins feed back and directly regulate dClock expression. Repression of dClock by VRI is separated from activation by PDP1 since VRI levels peak 3-6 hours before PDP1. Rhythmic vri transcription is required for molecular rhythms, and here we show that the clock stops in a Pdp1 null mutant, identifying Pdp1 as an essential clock gene. Thus, VRI and PDP1, together with dClock itself, comprise a second feedback loop in the Drosophila clock that gives rhythmic expression of dClock, and probably of other genes, to generate accurate circadian rhythms."
12586901,Metabolic engineering of valine- and isoleucine-derived glucosinolates in Arabidopsis expressing CYP79D2 from Cassava.,10.1104/pp.013425,"Glucosinolates are amino acid-derived natural products that, upon hydrolysis, typically release isothiocyanates with a wide range of biological activities. Glucosinolates play a role in plant defense as attractants and deterrents against herbivores and pathogens. A key step in glucosinolate biosynthesis is the conversion of amino acids to the corresponding aldoximes, which is catalyzed by cytochromes P450 belonging to the CYP79 family. Expression of CYP79D2 from cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.) in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of valine (Val)- and isoleucine-derived glucosinolates not normally found in this ecotype. The transgenic lines showed no morphological phenotype, and the level of endogenous glucosinolates was not affected. The novel glucosinolates were shown to constitute up to 35% of the total glucosinolate content in mature rosette leaves and up to 48% in old leaves. Furthermore, at increased concentrations of these glucosinolates, the proportion of Val-derived glucosinolates decreased. As the isothiocyanates produced from the Val- and isoleucine-derived glucosinolates are volatile, metabolically engineered plants producing these glucosinolates have acquired novel properties with great potential for improvement of resistance to herbivorous insects and for biofumigation."

Comparison of kinetic constants for the neuroactive steroids and their precursors among four human 3(20)alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (AKR1C1-AKR1C4) suggests that AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 are involved in the catabolism and synthesis, respectively, of the neuroactive steroids in the human brain. In our efforts to identify agents that would specifically inhibit the two enzymes, benzbromarone and 3',3"",5',5""-tetrabromophenolphthalein were found to be relatively selective and potent inhibitors of AKR1C1. Kinetic analyses in the oxidoreduction catalyzed by AKR1C1 in the presence of the inhibitors suggest that the inhibitors bind to the enzyme-NADP(H) complex (K(i)=0.7 nM) in the ordered bi-bi pathway, including an isomerization step. The inhibitors effectively also decreased the reduction of 3alpha,5alpha-THP to its 20alpha-hydroxy metabolite in HepG2 cells treated with ethacrynic acid."

The gene cluster consists of 14 ORFs and the amino acid sequence homology search revealed that it contains three genes, staO, staD, and staP, coding for the enzymes involved in the indolocarbazole aglycone biosynthesis, two genes, staG and staN, for the bond formation between the aglycone and deoxysugar, eight genes, staA, staB, staE, staJ, staI, staK, staMA, and staMB, for the deoxysugar biosynthesis and one gene, staR is a transcriptional regulator. Heterologous gene expression of a 38-kb fragment containing a complete set of the biosynthetic genes for staurosporine cloned into pTOYAMAcos confirmed its role in staurosporine biosynthesis. Moreover, the distribution of the gene for chromopyrrolic acid synthase, the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of indolocarbazole aglycone, in actinomycetes was investigated, and rebD homologs were shown to exist only in the strains producing indolocarbazole antibiotics."
12618544,"CloQ, a prenyltransferase involved in clorobiocin biosynthesis.",10.1073/pnas.0337708100,"Ring A (3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid) is a structural moiety of the aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin and clorobiocin. In the present study, the prenyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of this moiety was identified from the clorobiocin producer (Streptomyces roseochromogenes), overexpressed, and purified. It is a soluble, monomeric 35-kDa protein, encoded by the structural gene cloQ. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate and dimethylallyl diphosphate were identified as the substrates of this enzyme, with K(m) values determined as 25 and 35 microM, respectively. A gene inactivation experiment confirmed that cloQ is essential for ring A biosynthesis. Database searches did not reveal any similarity of CloQ to known prenyltransferases, and the enzyme did not contain the typical prenyl diphosphate binding site (N/D)DXXD. In contrast to most of the known prenyltransferases, the enzymatic activity was not dependent on the presence of magnesium, and in contrast to the membrane-bound polyprenyltransferases involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis, CloQ did not accept 4-hydroxybenzoic acid as substrate. CloQ and the similar NovQ from the novobiocin producer seem to belong to a new class of prenyltransferases."
12619684,Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of rebeccamycin from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243.,10.1271/bbb.67.127,"The biosynthetic gene cluster for rebeccamycin, an indolocarbazole antibiotic, from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243 has 11 ORFs. To clarify their functions, mutants with rebG, rebD, rebC, rebP, rebM, rebR, rebH, rebT, or orfD2 disrupted were constructed, and the gene products were examined. rebP disruptants produced 11,11'-dichlorochromopyrrolic acid, found to be a biosynthetic intermediate by a bioconversion experiment. Other genes encoded N-glycosyltransferase (rebG), monooxygenase (rebC), methyltransferase (rebM), a transcriptional activator (rebR), and halogenase (rebH). rebT disruptants produced rebeccamycin as much as the wild strain, so rebT was probably not involved in rebeccamycin production. Biosynthetic genes of staurosporine, an another indolocarbazole antibiotic, were cloned from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274. staO, staD, and staP were similar to rebO, rebD, and rebP, respectively, all of which are responsible for indolocarbazole biosynthesis, But a rebC homolog, encoding a putative enzyme oxidizing the C-7 site of pyrrole rings, was not found in the staurosporine biosynthetic gene cluster. These results suggest that indolocarbazole is constructed by oxidative decarboxylation of chromopyrrolic acid (11,11'-dichlorochromopyrrolic acid in rebeccamycin) generated from two molecules of tryptophan by coupling and that the oxidation state at the C-7 position depends on the additional enzyme(s) encoded by the biosynthetic genes."
12620337,Recent advances in betalain research.,10.1016/s0031-9422(02)00564-2,"Betalains replace the anthocyanins in flowers and fruits of plants of most families of the Caryophyllales. Unexpectedly, they were also found in some higher fungi. Whereas the anthocyanin-analogous functions of betalains in flower and fruit colouration are obvious, their role in fungi remains obscure. The nature of newly identified betalains as well as final structure elucidation of earlier putatively described compounds published within the last decade is compiled in this report. Recent advances in research on betalain biosynthesis is also covered, including description of some 'early' reactions, i.e. betalain-specific dopa formation in plants and fungi and extradiolic dopa cleavage in fungi. Work on betalain-specific glucosyltransferases (GTs) has given new insights into the evolution of secondary plant enzymes. It is proposed that these GTs are phylogenetically related to flavonoid GTs. It was found that the decisive steps in betalain biosynthesis, i.e. condensation of the betalain chromophore betalamic acid with cyclo-dopa and amino acids or amines in the respective aldimine formation of the red-violet betacyanins and the yellow betaxanthins, are most likely to be non-enzymatic. Betalains have attracted workers in applied fields because of their use for food colouring and their antioxidant and radical scavenging properties for protection against certain oxidative stress-related disorders."

While many steps of DIMBOA biosynthesis have been elucidated, the mechanism of the introduction of OCH(3)-group at the C-7 position was unknown. Inhibitor experiments in Triticum aestivum and Zea mays suggest that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase catalyses the hydroxylation reaction at C-7. Cloning and reverse genetics analysis have identified the Bx6 gene that encodes this enzyme. Bx6 is located in the Bx-gene cluster of maize."

The purified enzyme catalyzed the conversion of the polylactosamine acceptor GlcNAcbeta1-3'LacNAc into GlcNAcbeta1-3'(GlcNAcbeta1-6') LacNAc (dIGnT activity), but it could not transfer GlcNAc to LacNAcbeta1-3'LacNAc (cIGnT activity). This enzyme could also convert mucin core 1 and core 3 analogs, Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-O-paranitrophenyl (pNP) and GlcNAcbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-O-pNP, into Galbeta1-3(GlcNAcbeta1-6) GalNAcalpha1-O-pNP (C2GnT activity) and GlcNAcbeta1-3(GlcNAcbeta1-6)GalNAcalpha1-O-pNP (C4GnT activity), respectively. Based on the partial amino acid sequences of the purified protein, the cDNA encoding this enzyme was cloned. The COS-1 cells transiently transfected with this cDNA had high dI/C2/C4GnT activities in a ratio of 0.34:1.00:0.90, compared with non- or mock-transfected cells. The primary structure shows a significant homology with human and viral mucin-type core 2 beta1-6GnTs (C2GnT-Ms), indicating that this enzyme is the rat ortholog of human and viral C2GnT-Ms. This is the first identification and purification of this enzyme as a major carrier of dIGnT activity in the small intestine. This rat ortholog should mostly be responsible for making distal I-branch structures on poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences in this tissue, as well as making mucin core 2 and core 4 structures, given that it also has high C2/C4GnT activities."
12628346,At the acidic edge: emerging functions for lysosomal membrane proteins.,10.1016/s0962-8924(03)00005-9,"It has recently become clear that lysosomes have more complex functions than simply being the end-point on a degradative pathway. Similarly, it is now emerging that there are interesting functions for the limiting membranes around these organelles and their associated proteins. Although it has been known for several decades that the lysosomal membrane contains several highly N-glycosylated proteins, including the lysosome-associated membrane proteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 and lysosomal integral membrane protein-2/lysosomal membrane glycoprotein-85 (LIMP-2/LGP85), specific functions of these proteins have only recently begun to be recognized. Although the normal functions of LAMP-1 can be substituted by the structurally related LAMP-2, LAMP-2 itself has more specific tasks. Knockout of LAMP-2 in mice has revealed roles for LAMP-2 in lysosomal enzyme targeting, autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. LAMP-2 deficiency in humans leads to Danon disease, a fatal cardiomyopathy and myopathy. Furthermore, there is evidence that LAMP-2 functions in chaperone-mediated autophagy. LIMP-2/LGP85 also seems to have specific functions in maintaining endosomal transport and lysosomal biogenesis. The pivotal function of lysosomal membrane proteins is also highlighted by the recent identification of disease-causing mutations in cystine and sialic acid transporter proteins, leading to nephropathic cystinosis and Salla disease."
12644495,The ascorbate transporter of Escherichia coli.,10.1128/JB.185.7.2243-2250.2003,"The sgaTBA genes of Escherichia coli encode a putative 12-transmembrane alpha-helical segment (12 TMS) transporter, an enzyme IIB-like protein and an enzyme IIA-like protein of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), respectively. We show that all three proteins as well as the energy-coupling PTS proteins, enzyme I and HPr, are required for the anaerobic utilization and uptake of L-ascorbate in vivo and its phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation in vitro. The transporter exhibits an apparent K(m) for L-ascorbate of 9 micro M and is highly specific. The sgaTBA genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by the yjfQ gene product, as well as by Crp and Fnr. The yjfR gene product is essential for L-ascorbate utilization and probably encodes a cytoplasmic L-ascorbate 6-phosphate lactonase. We conclude that SgaT represents a novel prototypical enzyme IIC that functions with SgaA and SgaB to allow phosphoryl transfer from HPr(his-P) to L-ascorbate via the phosphoryl transfer pathway: [pathway: see text]."
12644647,A cluster of genes encodes the two types of chalcone isomerase involved in the biosynthesis of general flavonoids and legume-specific 5-deoxy(iso)flavonoids in Lotus japonicus.,10.1104/pp.004820,"Leguminous plants produce 5-deoxyflavonoids and 5-deoxyisoflavonoids that play essential roles in legume-microbe interactions. Together with chalcone polyketide reductase and cytochrome P450 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase, the chalcone isomerase (CHI) of leguminous plants is fundamental in the construction of these ecophysiologically active flavonoids. Although CHIs of nonleguminous plants isomerize only 6'-hydroxychalcone to 5-hydroxyflavanone (CHIs with this function are referred to as type I), leguminous CHIs convert both 6'-deoxychalcone and 6'-hydroxychalcone to 5-deoxyflavanone and 5-hydroxyflavanone, respectively (referred to as type II). In this study, we isolated multiple CHI cDNAs (cCHI1-cCHI3) from a model legume, Lotus japonicus. In contrast to previous observations, the amino acid sequence of CHI2 was highly homologous to nonleguminous CHIs, whereas CHI1 and CHI3 were the conventional leguminous type. Furthermore, genome sequence analysis revealed that four CHI genes (CHI1-3 and a putative gene, CHI4) form a tandem cluster within 15 kb. Biochemical analysis with recombinant CHIs expressed in Escherichia coli confirmed that CHI1 and CHI3 are type II CHIs and that CHI2 is a type I CHI. The occurrence of both types of CHIs is probably common in leguminous plants, and it was suggested that type II CHIs evolved from an ancestral CHI by gene duplication and began to produce 5-deoxy(iso)flavonoids along with the establishment of the Fabaceae."
12644686,"O-glucosylation of cis-zeatin in maize. Characterization of genes, enzymes, and endogenous cytokinins.",10.1104/pp.017210,"trans-Zeatin is a major and ubiquitous cytokinin in higher plants. cis-Zeatin has traditionally been viewed as an adjunct with low activity and rare occurrence. Recent reports of cis-zeatin and its derivatives as the predominant cytokinin components in some plant tissues may call for a different perspective on cis-isomers. The existence of a maize (Zea mays) gene (cisZOG1) encoding an O-glucosyltransferase specific to cis-zeatin (R.C. Martin, M.C. Mok, J.E. Habben, D.W.S. Mok [2001] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98: 5922-5926) lends further support to this view. Results described here include the isolation of a second maize cisZOG gene, differential expression of cisZOG1 and cisZOG2, and identification of substantial amounts of cis-isomers in maize tissues. The open reading frame of cisZOG2 has 98.3% identity to cisZOG1 at the nucleotide level and 97.8% at the amino acid level. The upstream regions contain common and unique segments. The recombinant enzymes have similar properties, K(m) values of 46 and 96 microM, respectively, for cis-zeatin and a pH optimum of 7.5. Other cytokinins, including N(6)-(delta(2)-isopentenyl)adenine, trans-zeatin, benzyladenine, kinetin, and thidiazuron inhibited the reaction. Expression of cisZOG1 was high in maize roots and kernels, whereas cisZOG2 expression was high in roots but low in kernels. cis-Zeatin, cis-zeatin riboside, and their O-glucosides were detected in all maize tissues, with immature kernels containing very high levels of the O-glucoside of cis-zeatin riboside. The results are a clear indication that O-glucosylation of cis-zeatin is a natural metabolic process in maize. Whether cis-zeatin serves as a precursor to the active trans-isomer or has any other unique function remains to be demonstrated."
12670968,Identification and characterization of a mandelamide hydrolase and an NAD(P)+-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633.,10.1128/JB.185.8.2451-2456.2003,"The enzymes of the mandelate metabolic pathway permit Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633 to utilize either or both enantiomers of mandelate as the sole carbon source. The genes encoding the mandelate pathway were found to lie on a single 10.5-kb restriction fragment. Part of that fragment was shown to contain the genes coding for mandelate racemase, mandelate dehydrogenase, and benzoylformate decarboxylase arranged in an operon. Here we report the sequencing of the remainder of the restriction fragment, which revealed three further open reading frames, denoted mdlX, mdlY, and mdlD. All were transcribed in the opposite direction from the genes of the mdlABC operon. Sequence alignments suggested that the open reading frames encoded a regulatory protein (mdlX), a member of the amidase signature family (mdlY), and an NAD(P)(+)-dependent dehydrogenase (mdlD). The mdlY and mdlD genes were isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified gene products were characterized as a mandelamide hydrolase and an NAD(P)(+)-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively."
12684507,A new type of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG-Ii) provides new insights into the early steps of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis.,10.1074/jbc.M302850200,"Deficiency of GDP-Man:Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol mannosyltransferase (hALG2), is the cause of a new type of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) designated CDG-Ii. The patient presented normal at birth but developed in the 1st year of life a multisystemic disorder with mental retardation, seizures, coloboma of the iris, hypomyelination, hepatomegaly, and coagulation abnormalities. An accumulation of Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol was observed in skin fibroblasts of the patient. Incubation of patient fibroblast extracts with Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and GDP-mannose revealed a severely reduced activity of the mannosyltransferase elongating Man1GlcNAc2-PP dolichol. Because the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant alg2-1 was known to accumulate the same shortened dolichol-linked oligosaccharides as the patient, the yeast ALG2 sequence was used to identify the human ortholog. Genetic analysis revealed that the patient was heterozygous for a single nucleotide deletion and a single nucleotide substitution in the human ortholog of yeast ALG2. Expression of wild type but not of mutant hALG2 cDNA restored the mannosyltransferase activity and the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides both in patient fibroblasts and in the alg2-1 yeast cells. hALG2 was shown to act as an alpha1,3-mannosyltransferase. The resulting Manalpha1,3-ManGlcNAc2-PP dolichol is further elongated by a yet unknown alpha1,6-mannosyltransferase."
12700258,"Escherichia coli phnN, encoding ribose 1,5-bisphosphokinase activity (phosphoribosyl diphosphate forming): dual role in phosphonate degradation and NAD biosynthesis pathways.",10.1128/JB.185.9.2793-2801.2003,"An enzymatic pathway for synthesis of 5-phospho-D-ribosyl alpha-1-diphosphate (PRPP) without the participation of PRPP synthase was analyzed in Escherichia coli. This pathway was revealed by selection for suppression of the NAD requirement of strains with a deletion of the prs gene, the gene encoding PRPP synthase (B. Hove-Jensen, J. Bacteriol. 178:714-722, 1996). The new pathway requires three enzymes: phosphopentomutase, ribose 1-phosphokinase, and ribose 1,5-bisphosphokinase. The latter activity is encoded by phnN; the product of this gene is required for phosphonate degradation, but its enzymatic activity has not been determined previously. The reaction sequence is ribose 5-phosphate --> ribose 1-phosphate --> ribose 1,5-bisphosphate --> PRPP. Alternatively, the synthesis of ribose 1-phosphate in the first step, catalyzed by phosphopentomutase, can proceed via phosphorolysis of a nucleoside, as follows: guanosine + P(i) --> guanine + ribose 1-phosphate. The ribose 1,5-bisphosphokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of ribose 1,5-bisphosphate is a novel reaction and represents the first assignment of a specific chemical reaction to a polypeptide required for cleavage of a carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond by a C-P lyase. The phnN gene was manipulated in vitro to encode a variant of ribose 1,5-bisphosphokinase with a tail consisting of six histidine residues at the carboxy-terminal end. PhnN was purified almost to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme accepted ATP but not GTP as a phosphoryl donor, and it used ribose 1,5-bisphosphate but not ribose, ribose 1-phosphate, or ribose 5-phosphate as a phosphoryl acceptor. The identity of the reaction product as PRPP was confirmed by coupling the ribose 1,5-bisphosphokinase activity to the activity of xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase in the presence of xanthine, which resulted in the formation of 5'-XMP, and by cochromatography of the reaction product with authentic PRPP."
12716912,"Human alpha2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal II) is a stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 synthase.",10.1074/jbc.M213223200,"Monosialosyl globopentaosylceramide (MSGb5), originally described as stage-specific embryonic antigen-4, is expressed in testicular germ cell tumors and in aggressive cases of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Clarification of the molecular mechanisms regulating synthesis of MSGb5 is very important to understand testicular carcinogenesis and the malignant progression of human RCC. For this purpose, we have investigated alpha2,3-sialyltransferase involved in the synthesis of MSGb5. We used the method of expression cloning combined with polymerase chain reaction targeted to sialylmotif to isolate a cDNA clone from RCC cell line ACHN library. The cloned cDNA was found to be identical to the previously cloned ST3Gal II in sequence. A soluble recombinant form of the protein in COS-1 cells showed an enzyme activity of alpha2,3-sialyltransferase toward globopentaosylceramide (Gb5) in addition to asialo-GM1 and GM1a. Transient transfection of COS-7 and ACHN cells with this cDNA induced an increase of MSGb5, whereas stable transfection of antisense ST3Gal II cDNA suppressed expression of MSGb5 in ACHN cells. The ST3Gal II mRNA level was increased in 7 of 8 RCC cell lines and in all six RCC tissues surgically obtained, although it was not necessarily consistent with the MSGb5 level in RCC cell lines. This study indicates that ST3Gal II is a MSGb5 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-4) synthase and that its increased expression level is closely related to renal carcinogenesis."
12724733,The circadian clock: pacemaker and tumour suppressor.,10.1038/nrc1072,"The circadian rhythms are daily oscillations in various biological processes that are regulated by an endogenous clock. Disruption of these rhythms has been associated with cancer in humans. One of the cellular processes that is regulated by circadian rhythm is cell proliferation, which often shows asynchrony between normal and malignant tissues. This asynchrony highlights the importance of the circadian clock in tumour suppression in vivo and is one of the theoretical foundations for cancer chronotherapy. Investigation of the mechanisms by which the circadian clock controls cell proliferation and other cellular functions might lead to new therapeutic targets."
12752668,Granzyme B: a natural born killer.,10.1034/j.1600-065x.2003.00044.x,"A main pathway used by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells to eliminate pathogenic cells is via exocytosis of granule components in the direction of the target cell, delivering a lethal hit of cytolytic molecules. Amongst these, granzyme B and perforin have been shown to induce CTL-mediated target cell DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. Once released from the CTL, granzyme B binds its receptor, the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor, and is endocytosed but remains arrested in endocytic vesicles until released by perforin. Once in the cytosol, granzyme B targets caspase-3 directly or indirectly through the mitochondria, initiating the caspase cascade to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. Caspase activity is required for apoptosis to occur; however, in the absence of caspase activity, granzyme B can still initiate mitochondrial events via the cleavage of Bid. Recent work shows that granzyme B-mediated release of apoptotic factors from the mitochondria is essential for the full activation of caspase-3. Thus, granzyme B acts at multiple points to initiate the death of the offending cell. Studies of the granzyme B death receptor and internal signaling pathways may lead to critical advances in cell transplantation and cancer therapy."

Gliomas can be classified into several groups according to histological features. A number of genetic alterations have been identified in human gliomas; these generally affect either signal transduction pathways activated by receptor tyrosine kinases or cell cycle growth arrest pathways. These observed genetic alterations are now being used to complement histopathological diagnosis. The aim of the present review is to give a broad overview of the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling machinery involved in gliomagenesis, with an emphasis on the cooperative interaction between receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and the cell cycle-regulatory machinery. Understanding molecular features of primary glial tumors will eventually allow for target-selective intervention in distinct glioma subsets and a more rational approach to adjuvant therapies for these refractory diseases."

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genes coding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of isoprenoid-derived compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana. By combining homology and sequence motif searches with knowledge regarding the phylogenetic distribution of pathways of isoprenoid metabolism across species, candidate genes for these pathways in A. thaliana were obtained. A detailed analysis of the vicinity of chromosome loci for genes of isoprenoid metabolism in A. thaliana provided evidence for the clustering of genes involved in common pathways. Multiple sequence alignments were used to estimate the number of genes in gene families and sequence relationship trees were utilized to classify their individual members. The integration of all these datasets allows the generation of a knowledge-based metabolic map of isoprenoid metabolic pathways in A. thaliana and provides a substantial improvement of the currently available gene annotation."

The biosynthesis of this moiety has now been identified by biochemical and molecular biological studies. CloQ from the clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces roseochromogenes DS 12976 has recently been identified as a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate-3-dimethylallyltransferase. In the present study, the enzyme CloR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and identified as a bifunctional non-heme iron oxygenase, which converts 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (3DMA-4HPP) via 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxymandelic acid (3DMA-4HMA) to 3DMA-4HB by two consecutive oxidative decarboxylation steps. In 18O2 labeling experiments we showed that two oxygen atoms are incorporated into the intermediate 3DMA-4HMA in the first reaction step, but only one further oxygen is incorporated into the final product 3DMA-4HB during the second reaction step. CloR does not show sequence similarity to known oxygenases. It apparently presents a novel member of the diverse family of the non-heme iron (II) and alpha-ketoacid-dependent oxygenases, with 3DMA-4HPP functioning both as an alpha-keto acid and as a hydroxylation substrate. The reaction catalyzed by CloR represents a new pathway for the formation of benzoic acids in nature."
12777485,The THI5 gene family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: distribution of homologues among the hemiascomycetes and functional redundancy in the aerobic biosynthesis of thiamin from pyridoxine.,10.1099/mic.0.26194-0,"The THI5 gene family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae comprises four highly conserved members named THI5 (YFL058w), THI11 (YJR156c), THI12 (YNL332w) and THI13 (YDL244w). Each gene copy is located within the subtelomeric region of a different chromosome and all are homologues of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe nmt1 gene which is thought to function in the biosynthesis of hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP), a precursor of vitamin B(1), thiamin. A comprehensive phylogenetic study has shown that the existence of THI5 as a gene family is exclusive to those yeasts of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto subgroup. To determine the function and redundancy of each of the S. cerevisiae homologues, all combinations of the single, double, triple and quadruple deletion mutants were constructed using a PCR-mediated gene-disruption strategy. Phenotypic analyses of these mutant strains have shown the four genes to be functionally redundant in terms of HMP formation for thiamin biosynthesis; each promotes synthesis of HMP from the pyridoxine (vitamin B(6)) biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, growth studies with the quadruple mutant strain support a previous proposal of an alternative HMP biosynthetic pathway that operates in yeast under anaerobic growth conditions. Comparative analysis of mRNA levels has revealed subtle differences in the regulation of the four genes, suggesting that they respond differently to nutrient limitation."
12796471,Normal incidence of diabetes in NOD mice tolerant to glutamic acid decarboxylase.,10.1084/jem.20030215,Experiments in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice that lacked expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in beta cells have suggested that GAD represents an autoantigen essential for initiating and maintaining the diabetogenic immune response. Several attempts of inducing GAD-specific recessive tolerance to support this hypothesis have failed. Here we report on successful tolerance induction by expressing a modified form of GAD under control of the invariant chain promoter resulting in efficient epitope display. In spite of specific tolerance insulitis and diabetes occurred with normal kinetics indicating that GAD is not an essential autoantigen in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

12832414,Structure/function relationships responsible for coenzyme specificity and the isomerase activity of human type 1 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase.,10.1074/jbc.M304752200,"Human type 1 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3 beta-HSD/isomerase) catalyzes the two sequential enzyme reactions on a single protein that converts dehydroepiandrosterone or pregnenolone to androstenedione or progesterone, respectively, in placenta, mammary gland, breast tumors, prostate, prostate tumors, and other peripheral tissues. Our earlier studies show that the two enzyme reactions are linked by the coenzyme product, NADH, of the 3 beta-HSD activity. NADH activates the isomerase activity by inducing a time-dependent conformational change in the enzyme protein. The current study tested the hypothesis that the 3 beta-HSD and isomerase activities shared a common coenzyme domain, and it characterized key amino acids that participated in coenzyme binding and the isomerase reaction. Homology modeling with UDP-galactose-4-epimerase predicts that Asp36 is responsible for the NAD(H) specificity of human 3 beta-HSD/isomerase and identifies the Rossmann-fold coenzyme domain at the amino terminus. The D36A/K37R mutant in the potential coenzyme domain and the D241N, D257L, D258L, and D265N mutants in the potential isomerase domain (previously identified by affinity labeling) were created, expressed, and purified. The D36A/K37R mutant shifts the cofactor preference of both 3 beta-HSD and isomerase from NAD(H) to NADP(H), which shows that the two activities utilize a common coenzyme domain. The D257L and D258L mutations eliminate isomerase activity, whereas the D241N and D265N mutants have nearly full isomerase activity. Kinetic analyses and pH dependence studies showed that either Asp257 or Asp258 plays a catalytic role in the isomerization reaction. These observations further characterize the structure/function relationships of human 3 beta-HSD/isomerase and bring us closer to the goal of selectively inhibiting the type 1 enzyme in placenta (to control the timing of labor) or in hormone-sensitive breast tumors (to slow their growth)."
12867427,Temperature-dependent presteady state kinetics of lumazine synthase from the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Aquifex aeolicus.,10.1074/jbc.M303090200,"6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (lumazine synthase) catalyzes the condensation of 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. Presteady state kinetic experiments using the enzyme from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus were monitored by multiwavelength photometry. An early optical transient absorbing around 330 nm is interpreted as a Schiff base intermediate obtained by reaction of the position 5 amino group of the heterocyclic substrate with the carbonyl group of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. A second transient with an absorption maximum at 445 nm represents an intermediate resulting from the elimination of orthophosphate from the Schiff base. The rate-determining step is the subsequent formation of the 7-exomethylene type anion of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. The rate constants for the three partial reactions identified by the stopped flow experiments show linear Arrhenius relations in the temperature range of 15-70 degrees C."
12893295,Tetrahydrobiopterin is synthesized from 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin by the human aldo-keto reductase AKR1 family members.,10.1016/s0003-9861(03)00295-9,"Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) is a cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthase. The biosynthesis includes two reduction steps catalyzed by sepiapterin reductase. An intermediate, 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PPH(4)) is reduced to 1(')-oxo-2(')-hydroxypropyl-tetrahydropterin (1(')-OXPH(4)) or 1(')-hydroxy-2(')-oxopropyl-tetrahydropterin (2(')-OXPH(4)), which is further converted to BH(4). However, patients with sepiapterin reductase deficiency show normal urinary excretion of pterins without hyperphenylalaninemia, suggesting that other enzymes catalyze the two reduction steps. In this study, the reductase activities for the tetrahydropterin intermediates were examined using several human recombinant enzymes belonging to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. In the reduction of PPH(4) by AKR family enzymes, 2(')-OXPH(4) was formed by 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, whereas 1(')-OXPH(4) was produced by aldose reductase, aldehyde reductase, and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and both 1(')-OXPH(4) and 2(')-OXPH(4) were detected as the major and minor products by 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (types 1 and 3). The activities of aldose reductase and 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (106 and 35 nmol/mg/min, respectively) were higher than those of the other enzymes (0.2-4.0 nmol/mg/min). Among the SDR family enzymes, monomeric carbonyl reductase exhibited low 1(')-OXPH(4)-forming activity of 5.0 nmol/mg/min, but L-xylulose reductase and peroxisomal tetrameric carbonyl reductase did not form any reduced product from PPH(4). Aldose reductase reduced 2(')-OXPH(4) to BH(4), but the other enzymes were inactive towards both 2(')-OXPH(4) and 1(')-OXPH(4). These results indicate that the tetrahydropterin intermediates are natural substrates of the human AKR family enzymes and suggest a novel alternative pathway from PPH(4) to BH(4), in which 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 and aldose reductase work in concert."
12904558,"CloN2, a novel acyltransferase involved in the attachment of the pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety to the deoxysugar of clorobiocin.",10.1099/mic.0.26314-0,"The aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin contains a 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid unit, attached via an ester bond to the 3-OH group of the deoxysugar moiety. To investigate candidate genes responsible for the formation of this ester bond, a gene inactivation experiment was carried out in the clorobiocin producer Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS 12.976. An in-frame deletion was created in the coding sequence of the gene cloN2. The production of secondary metabolites in the wild-type and in the cloN2 mutant was analysed. The wild-type showed clorobiocin as the main product, whereas the cloN2 mutant accumulated a new aminocoumarin derivative, novclobiocin 104, lacking the pyrrole moiety at the 3-OH of the deoxysugar. In addition, free pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid accumulated in the culture extract of the cloN2 mutant. The structures of the metabolites were confirmed by NMR and LC-MS analysis. Clorobiocin production was successfully restored in the cloN2 mutant by introducing a replicative plasmid containing the cloN2 sequence. These results prove an involvement of cloN2 in the formation of the ester bond between the pyrrole moiety and the deoxysugar in clorobiocin biosynthesis. Furthermore, they indicate that the C-methylation at position 5 of the pyrrole moiety occurs after the attachment of pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid unit to the deoxysugar moiety."
12915557,Variability at human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C protease cleavage sites: an indication of viral fitness?,10.1128/jvi.77.17.9422-9430.2003,"Naturally occurring polymorphisms in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C would be expected to lead to adaptive (compensatory) changes in protease cleavage sites. To test this hypothesis, we examined the prevalences and patterns of cleavage site polymorphisms in the Gag, Gag-Pol, and Nef cleavage sites of C compared to those in non-C subtypes. Codon-based maximum-likelihood methods were used to assess the natural selection and evolutionary history of individual cleavage sites. Seven cleavage sites (p17/p24, p24/p2, NC/p1, NC/TFP, PR/RT, RT/p66, and p66/IN) were well conserved over time and in all HIV-1 subtypes. One site (p1/p6(gag)) exhibited moderate variation, and four sites (p2/NC, TFP/p6(pol), p6(pol)/PR, and Nef) were highly variable, both within and between subtypes. Three of the variable sites are known to be major determinants of polyprotein processing and virion production. P2/NC controls the rate and order of cleavage, p6(gag) is an important phosphoprotein required for virion release, and TFP/p6(pol), a novel cleavage site in the transframe domain, influences the specificity of Gag-Pol processing and the activation of protease. Overall, 58.3% of the 12 HIV-1 cleavage sites were significantly more diverse in C than in B viruses. When analyzed as a single concatenated fragment of 360 bp, 96.0% of group M cleavage site sequences fell into subtype-specific phylogenetic clusters, suggesting that they coevolved with the virus. Natural variation at C cleavage sites may play an important role, not only in regulation of the viral cycle but also in disease progression and response to therapy."
12920116,"Bacillus subtilis hydrolyzes CheY-P at the location of its action, the flagellar switch.",10.1074/jbc.M306180200,"In this report we show that in Bacillus subtilis the flagellar switch, which controls direction of flagellar rotation based on levels of the chemotaxis primary response regulator, CheY-P, also causes hydrolysis of CheY-P to form CheY and Pi. This task is performed in Escherichia coli by CheZ, which interestingly enough is primarily located at the receptors, not at the switch. In particular we have identified the phosphatase as FliY, which resembles E. coli switch protein FliN only in its C-terminal part, while an additional N-terminal domain is homologous to another switch protein FliM and to CheC, a protein found in the archaea and many bacteria but not in E. coli. Previous E. coli studies have localized the CheY-P binding site of the switch to FliM residues 6-15. These residues are almost identical to the residues 6-15 in both B. subtilis FliM and FliY. We were able to show that both of these proteins are capable of binding CheY-P in vitro. Deletion of this binding region in B. subtilis mutant fliM caused the same phenotype as a cheY mutant (clockwise flagellar rotation), whereas deletion of it in fliY caused the opposite. We showed that FliY increases the rate of CheY-P hydrolysis in vitro. Consequently, we imagine that the duration of enhanced CheY-P levels caused by activation of the CheA kinase upon attractant binding to receptors, is brief due both to adaptational processes and to phosphatase activity of FliY."
12943720,"Activation and nuclear translocation of PKCdelta, Pyk2 and ERK1/2 by gonadotropin releasing hormone in HEK293 cells.",10.1016/s0960-0760(03)00226-7,"The mechanism of agonist-induced activation of Pyk2 and its relationship with ERK1/2 phosphorylation was analyzed in HEK293 cells stably expressing the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor. GnRH stimulation caused rapid and sustained phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Pyk2 that was accompanied by their nuclear translocation. Pyk2 was also localized on cell membranes and at focal adhesions. Dominant negative Pyk2 (PKM) had no effect on GnRH-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-fos expression. These actions of GnRH on ERK1/2 and Pyk2 were mimicked by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and were abolished by its inhibition. GnRH caused translocation of PKCalpha and delta, but not of epsilon, iota and lambda, to the cell membrane, as well as phosphorylation of Raf at Ser338, a major site in the activation of MEK/ERK1/2. Stimulation of HEK293 cells by EGF caused marked ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was attenuated by the selective EGFR receptor (EGF-R) kinase inhibitor, AG1478. However, GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation was independent of EGF-R activation. These results indicate that activation of PKC is responsible for GnRH-induced phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and Pyk2, and that Pyk2 activation does not contribute to GnRH signaling. Moreover, GnRH-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and expression of c-fos in HEK293 cells is independent of Src and EGF-R transactivation, and is mediated through the PKC/Raf/MEK cascade."
12944466,"The human I-mfa domain-containing protein, HIC, interacts with cyclin T1 and modulates P-TEFb-dependent transcription.",10.1128/MCB.23.18.6373-6384.2003,"Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) hyperphosphorylates the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, permitting productive transcriptional elongation. The cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb engages cellular transcription factors as well as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivator Tat. To identify potential P-TEFb regulators, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen with cyclin T1 as bait. Among the proteins isolated was the human I-mfa domain-containing protein (HIC). HIC has been reported to modulate expression from both cellular and viral promoters via its C-terminal cysteine-rich domain, which is similar to the inhibitor of MyoD family a (I-mfa) protein. We show that HIC binds cyclin T1 in yeast and mammalian cells and that it interacts with intact P-TEFb in mammalian cell extracts. The interaction involves the I-mfa domain of HIC and the regulatory histidine-rich region of cyclin T1. HIC also binds Tat via its I-mfa domain, although the sequence requirements are different. HIC colocalizes with cyclin T1 in nuclear speckle regions and with Tat in the nucleolus. Expression of the HIC cDNA modulates Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in a cell type-specific fashion. It is mildly inhibitory in CEM cells but stimulates gene expression in HeLa, COS, and NIH 3T3 cells. The isolated I-mfa domain acts as a dominant negative inhibitor. Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by HIC in NIH 3T3 cells occurs at the RNA level and is mediated by direct interactions with P-TEFb."
12957954,Conversion of 2-fluoromuconate to cis-dienelactone by purified enzymes of Rhodococcus opacus 1cp.,10.1128/AEM.69.9.5636-5642.2003,"The present study describes the (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the conversion of 3-halocatechols to lactones by purified chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase (ClcA2), chloromuconate cycloisomerase (ClcB2), and chloromuconolactone dehalogenase (ClcF) from Rhodococcus opacus 1cp grown on 2-chlorophenol. The 3-halocatechol substrates were produced from the corresponding 2-halophenols by either phenol hydroxylase from Trichosporon cutaneum or 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-mono-oxygenase from Pseudomonas azelaica. Several fluoromuconates resulting from intradiol ring cleavage by ClcA2 were identified. ClcB2 converted 2-fluoromuconate to 5-fluoromuconolactone and 2-chloro-4-fluoromuconate to 2-chloro-4-fluoromuconolactone. Especially the cycloisomerization of 2-fluoromuconate is a new observation. ClcF catalyzed the dehalogenation of 5-fluoromuconolactone to cis-dienelactone. The ClcB2 and ClcF-mediated reactions are in line with the recent finding of a second cluster of chlorocatechol catabolic genes in R. opacus 1cp which provides a new route for the microbial dehalogenation of 3-chlorocatechol."
12963732,Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 mediate epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone.,10.1074/jbc.M304377200,"Rapid engagement of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade via the Gq/11-coupled GnRH receptor (GnRHR) is mediated by transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we show that the cross-talk between GnRHR and EGFR in gonadotropic cells is accomplished via gelatinases A and B (matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9), identifying gelatinases as the first distinct members of the MMP family mediating EGFR transactivation by G protein-coupled receptors. Using a specific MMP2 and MMP9 inhibitor, Ro28-2653, GnRH-dependent EGFR transactivation was abrogated. Proving the specificity of the effect, transient transfection of alphaT3-1 cells with ribozymes directed against MMP2 or MMP9 specifically blocked EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in response to GnRH stimulation. GnRH challenge of alphaT3-1 cells furthered the release of active MMP2 and MMP9 and increased their gelatinolytic activities within 5 min. Rapid release of activated MMP2 or MMP9 was inhibited by ribozyme-targeted down-regulation of MT1-MMP or MMP2, respectively. We found that GnRH-induced Src, Ras, and ERK activation were also gelatinase-dependent. Thus, gelatinase-induced EGFR transactivation was required to engage the extracellular-signal regulated kinase cascade. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK by GnRH was unaffected by EGFR or gelatinase inhibition that, however, suppressed GnRH induction of c-Jun and c-Fos. Our findings suggest a novel role for gelatinases in the endocrine regulation of pituitary gonadotropes."

There is now a consensus that the VEGFs are crucial for vascular development and neovascularization in physiological and pathological processes in both embryo and adult. This has facilitated a rapid transition to their use in clinical applications, for example, administration of VEGF ligands to enhance vascularization of ischaemic tissues and, conversely, inhibitors of VEGF-receptor function in anti-angiogenic therapy. More recent data indicate essential roles for the VEGFs in haematopoietic cell function and in lymphangiogenesis."
1368150,Microbial metabolism of monoterpenes--recent developments.,10.1007/BF00058829,"Monoterpenes are important renewable resources for the perfume and flavour industry but the pathways and enzymology of their degradation by microorganisms are not well documented. Until recently the acyclic monoterpene alcohols, (+)-camphor and the isomers of limonene were the only compounds for which significant sections of catabolic pathways and associated enzymology had been reported. In this paper recent developments in our understanding of the enzymology of ring cleavage by microorganisms capable of growth with 1,8-cineole and alpha-pinene are described. 1,8-Cineole has the carbocyclic skeleton of a monocyclic monoterpene with the added complication of an internal ether linkage. Ring hydroxylation strategy and biological Baeyer-Villiger oxygenation lead to an efficient method for cleaving the ether linkage. alpha-Pinene is an unsaturated bicyclic monoterpene hydrocarbon. At least two catabolic pathways exist. Information concerning one of them, in which alpha-pinene may be initially converted into limonene, is rudimentary. The other involves attack at the double bond resulting in formation of alpha-pinene epoxide. Ring cleavage is then catalysed by a novel lyase that requires no additional components and breaks both carbocyclic rings in a concerted manner."

Both str clusters showed considerable divergence in macro and micro structure. Genes putatively involved in pathways leading to the (dihydro-)streptose and N-methyl-L-glucosamine moieties of Sm were identified. Additional regulatory elements, such as gene strS and conserved TTA codons in the N-terminal sections of reading frames, are reported. Evidences for the involvement of physiological state, signal transduction, and activators in the control of Sm production are presented."
1393837,Mechanism and regulation of synthesis of aerobactin in Escherichia coli K12 (pColV-K30).,10.1139/m92-119,"The aerobactin operon of the virulence plasmid pColV-K30 of Escherichia coli K12 consists of four genes for biosynthesis and one for transport of the siderophore. Regulation by iron occurs at the transcriptional level and is mediated by a ferrous iron binding protein designated Fur (ferric uptake regulation). The metallated Fur repressor binds at a palindromic dyad, the ""iron box"" operator, situated in the vicinity of the RNA polymerase attachment site of the promoter. Evidence suggests that the ferrous iron enters the C-terminal domain of Fur to cause a conformational change in the N-terminal part of the protein. This results in greatly enhanced affinity of the repressor for the operator."

When intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 carrying DNA fragments encoding the first three enzymes of the pathway were incubated with naphthalene, they formed products of the dioxygenase-catalyzed ring cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. These products were separated by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and were identified by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) and trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate (tHBPA). HCCA was detected as the first reaction product in these incubation mixtures by its characteristic UV spectrum, which slowly changed to a spectrum indicative of an equilibrium mixture of HCCA and tHBPA. Isomerization of either purified product occurred slowly and spontaneously to give an equilibrium mixture of essentially the same composition. tHBPA is also formed from HCCA by the action of an isomerase enzyme encoded by plasmid NAH7. The gene encoding this enzyme, nahD, was cloned on a 1.95-kb KpnI-BglII fragment. Extracts of Escherichia coli JM109 carrying this fragment catalyzed the rapid equilibration of HCCA and tHBPA. Metabolism of tHBPA to salicylaldehyde by hydration and aldol cleavage is catalyzed by a single enzyme encoded by a 1-kb MluI-StuI restriction fragment. A mechanism for the hydratase-aldolase-catalyzed reaction is proposed. The salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, nahF, was cloned on a 2.75-kb BamHI fragment which also carries the naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene, nahB. On the basis of the identification of the enzymes encoded by various clones, the gene order for the nah operon was shown to be p, A, B, F, C, E, D."
14506308,Plasma membrane channels formed by connexins: their regulation and functions.,10.1152/physrev.00007.2003,"Members of the connexin gene family are integral membrane proteins that form hexamers called connexons. Most cells express two or more connexins. Open connexons found at the nonjunctional plasma membrane connect the cell interior with the extracellular milieu. They have been implicated in physiological functions including paracrine intercellular signaling and in induction of cell death under pathological conditions. Gap junction channels are formed by docking of two connexons and are found at cell-cell appositions. Gap junction channels are responsible for direct intercellular transfer of ions and small molecules including propagation of inositol trisphosphate-dependent calcium waves. They are involved in coordinating the electrical and metabolic responses of heterogeneous cells. New approaches have expanded our knowledge of channel structure and connexin biochemistry (e.g., protein trafficking/assembly, phosphorylation, and interactions with other connexins or other proteins). The physiological role of gap junctions in several tissues has been elucidated by the discovery of mutant connexins associated with genetic diseases and by the generation of mice with targeted ablation of specific connexin genes. The observed phenotypes range from specific tissue dysfunction to embryonic lethality."
14509570,Protein kinase C: its role in activity-dependent Purkinje cell dendritic development and plasticity.,10.1080/14734220310016150,"The cerebellum is a central organ in the control of motor learning and performance. In this respect, the cellular plasticity model systems of multiple climbing fiber elimination and long-term depression have been intensively studied. The signalling pathways involved in these plastic changes are now well understood on a molecular level and protein kinase C (PKC) activity appears to be crucially involved in both processes. Furthermore, as shown in recent studies, Purkinje cell dendritic development also critically depends on the activity of PKC. Thereby, the Ca(2+)-dependent PKC subtypes, activated by synaptic inputs through metabotropic glutamate receptors, trigger functional changes as well as long-term anatomical maturation of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree during cerebellar development at different time levels. This review summarizes these findings and forwards the hypothesis of a link between the functional mechanisms underlying LTD and the differentiation of Purkinje cell dendrites."
14522973,Activation of the fatty acid alpha-dioxygenase pathway during bacterial infection of tobacco leaves. Formation of oxylipins protecting against cell death.,10.1074/jbc.M310514200,"A pathogen-induced oxygenase showing homology to prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases-1 and -2 was recently characterized by in vitro experiments as a fatty acid alpha-dioxygenase catalyzing formation of unstable 2(R)-hydroperoxy fatty acids. To study the activity of this enzyme under in vivo conditions and to elucidate the fate of enzymatically produced 2-hydroperoxides, leaves of tobacco were analyzed for the presence of alpha-dioxygenase-generated compounds as well as for lipoxygenase (LOX) products and free fatty acids. Low basal levels of 2-hydroxylinolenic acid (0.4 nmol/g leaves fresh weight) and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (0.1 nmol/g) could be demonstrated. These levels increased strongly upon infection with the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae (548 and 47 nmol/g, respectively). Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing alpha-dioxygenase were developed, and incompatible infection of such plants led to a dramatic elevation of 2-hydroxylinolenic acid (1778 nmol/g) and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (86 nmol/g), whereas the levels of LOX products were strongly decreased. Further analysis of oxylipins in infected leaves revealed the presence of a number of 2-hydroxy fatty acids differing with respect to chain length and degree of unsaturation as well as two new doubly oxygenated oxylipins identified as 2(R),9(S)-dihydroxy-10(E),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid and 2(R),9(S)-dihydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. alpha-Dioxygenase-generated 2-hydroxylinolenic acid, and to a lesser extent lipoxygenase-generated 9-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid, exerted a tissue-protective effect in bacterially infected tobacco leaves."
14532286,A role for tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 and receptor-interacting protein in programmed necrosis and antiviral responses.,10.1074/jbc.M305633200,"Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily are potent regulators of apoptosis, a process that is important for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests that TNFR-1 and Fas and TRAIL receptors can also trigger an alternative form of cell death that is morphologically distinct from apoptosis. Because distinct molecular components including the serine/threonine protein kinase receptor-interacting protein (RIP) are required, we have referred to this alternative form of cell death as ""programmed necrosis."" We show that TNFR-2 signaling can potentiate programmed necrosis via TNFR-1. When cells were pre-stimulated through TNFR-2 prior to subsequent activation of TNFR-1, enhanced cell death and recruitment of RIP to the TNFR-1 complex were observed. However, TNF-induced programmed necrosis was normally inhibited by caspase-8 cleavage of RIP. To ascertain the physiological significance of RIP and programmed necrosis, we infected Jurkat cells with vaccinia virus (VV) and found that VV-infected cells underwent programmed necrosis in response to TNF, but deficiency of RIP rescued the infected cells from TNF-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, TNFR-2-/- mice exhibited reduced inflammation in the liver and defective viral clearance during VV infection. Interestingly, death effector domain-containing proteins such as MC159, E8, K13, and cellular FLIP, but not the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-xL, p35, and XIAP, potently suppressed programmed necrosis. Thus, TNF-induced programmed necrosis is facilitated by TNFR-2 signaling and caspase inhibition and may play a role in controlling viral infection."
14555694,Cytokinin-deficient transgenic Arabidopsis plants show multiple developmental alterations indicating opposite functions of cytokinins in the regulation of shoot and root meristem activity.,10.1105/tpc.014928,"Cytokinins are hormones that regulate cell division and development. As a result of a lack of specific mutants and biochemical tools, it has not been possible to study the consequences of cytokinin deficiency. Cytokinin-deficient plants are expected to yield information about processes in which cytokinins are limiting and that, therefore, they might regulate. We have engineered transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress individually six different members of the cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (AtCKX) gene family and have undertaken a detailed phenotypic analysis. Transgenic plants had increased cytokinin breakdown (30 to 45% of wild-type cytokinin content) and reduced expression of the cytokinin reporter gene ARR5:GUS (beta-glucuronidase). Cytokinin deficiency resulted in diminished activity of the vegetative and floral shoot apical meristems and leaf primordia, indicating an absolute requirement for the hormone. By contrast, cytokinins are negative regulators of root growth and lateral root formation. We show that the increased growth of the primary root is linked to an enhanced meristematic cell number, suggesting that cytokinins control the exit of cells from the root meristem. Different AtCKX-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins were localized to the vacuoles or the endoplasmic reticulum and possibly to the extracellular space, indicating that subcellular compartmentation plays an important role in cytokinin biology. Analyses of promoter:GUS fusion genes showed differential expression of AtCKX genes during plant development, the activity being confined predominantly to zones of active growth. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that cytokinins have central, but opposite, regulatory functions in root and shoot meristems and indicate that a fine-tuned control of catabolism plays an important role in ensuring the proper regulation of cytokinin functions."
14556773,Immunobiology of acute graft-versus-host disease.,10.1016/s0268-960x(03)00009-2,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been the primary limitation to the wider application of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The immunobiology of acute GVHD is complex and can be conceptualized to be a three-step process. In step 1, the conditioning regimen (irradiation and/or chemotherapy) leads to the damage and activation of host tissues and induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1. As a consequence expression of MHC antigens and adhesion molecules is increased, thus enhancing the recognition of host alloantigens by donor T cells. Donor T-cell activation in step 2 is characterized by donor T-cell interaction with host APCs and subsequent proliferation, differentiation, and secretion of cytokines. Cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-gamma enhance T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cell responses, and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. These inflammatory cytokines in turn stimulate production of inflammatory chemokines, thus recruiting effector cells into target organs. In step 3, effector functions of mononuclear phagocytes are triggered via a secondary signal provided by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that leaks through the intestinal mucosa damaged during step 1. This mechanism may result in the amplification of local tissue injury and further promotion of an inflammatory response, which, together with the CTL and NK components, leads to target tissue destruction in the transplant host."
14567704,Biosynthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamin pyrophosphate (vitamin B1).,10.1021/bi034902z,"While most of the proteins required for the biosynthesis of thiamin pyrophosphate have been known for more than a decade, the reconstitution of this biosynthesis in a defined biochemical system has been difficult due to the novelty of the chemistry involved. Here we demonstrate the first successful enzymatic synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamin from glycine, cysteine, and deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate using overexpressed Bacillus subtilis ThiF, ThiS, ThiO, ThiG, and a NifS-like protein. This has facilitated the identification of the biochemical function of each of the proteins involved: ThiF catalyzes the adenylation of ThiS; NifS catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from cysteine to the acyl adenylate of ThiS; ThiO catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to the corresponding imine; and ThiG catalyzes the formation of the thiazole phosphate ring. The complex oxidative cyclization reaction involved in the biosynthesis of the thiamin thiazole has been greatly simplified by replacing ThiF, ThiS, ThiO, and NifS with defined biosynthetic intermediates in a reaction where ThiG is the only required enzyme."
14596811,Structure of the GnRH receptor-stimulated signaling network: insights from genomics.,10.1016/s0091-3022(03)00027-x,"The GnRH receptor influences gene expression in the gonadotrope through activating signaling cascades that modulate transcription factor expression and activity. A longstanding question in neuroendocrinology is how instructions received at the membrane in the form of the pattern of receptor stimulation are processed into specific biosynthetic changes at each gonadotropin promoter. Signal transduction from the membrane to preformed transcription factors relies on recognition of altered conformations. Signal transduction through the layers of the gene network also requires the biosynthesis of new transcription factors. The signal processing of this system depends on its molecular connectivity map and its feedback and feed-forward loops. Review of signal transduction, gene control, and genomic studies provide evidence of key loops that cross between cellular and nuclear compartments. Genomic studies suggest that the signal transduction and gene network form a continuum. We propose that information transfer in the gonadotrope depends on robust signaling modules that serve to integrate events at different time scales across cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments."

14615594,"A rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, ebisu dwarf (d2), is caused by a loss of function of a new member of cytochrome P450.",10.1105/tpc.014712,"We characterized a rice dwarf mutant, ebisu dwarf (d2). It showed the pleiotropic abnormal phenotype similar to that of the rice brassinosteroid (BR)-insensitive mutant, d61. The dwarf phenotype of d2 was rescued by exogenous brassinolide treatment. The accumulation profile of BR intermediates in the d2 mutants confirmed that these plants are deficient in late BR biosynthesis. We cloned the D2 gene by map-based cloning. The D2 gene encoded a novel cytochrome P450 classified in CYP90D that is highly similar to the reported BR synthesis enzymes. Introduction of the wild D2 gene into d2-1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants. In feeding experiments, 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone, 3-dehydroteasterone, and brassinolide effectively caused the lamina joints of the d2 plants to bend, whereas more upstream compounds did not cause bending. Based on these results, we conclude that D2/CYP90D2 catalyzes the steps from 6-deoxoteasterone to 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone and from teasterone to 3-dehydroteasterone in the late BR biosynthesis pathway."
14617043,A comprehensive guide to antibody and T-cell responses in type 1 diabetes.,10.1034/j.1399-0039.2003.00152.x,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets are selectively eliminated. T cells specific for beta-cell antigens are the mediators of this precise cellular destruction. However, antibodies to beta-cell proteins are also generated and may be used for predicting disease in at-risk populations. Over the past two decades, numerous beta-cell proteins and lipids have been implicated as autoantigens in patients or in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-studied animal model of T1D. Here, we present a review of these antigens, accompanied by their T-cell epitopes, where known, and a discussion of our current understanding of why particular self-proteins become disease-inciting antigens. Although two dozen beta-cell antigens have been identified to date, few of these have been confirmed to be recognized by pathogenic T cells early in the disease process. Further identification and characterization of initiating beta-cell antigens targeted by pathogenic T cells should be a priority for future studies."
14622269,An unusual amide synthetase (CouL) from the coumermycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489.,10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03830.x,"The aminocoumarin antibiotic coumermycin A1 produced by Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 contains two amide bonds. The biosynthetic gene cluster of coumermycin contains a putative amide synthetase gene, couL, encoding a protein of 529 amino acids. CouL was overexpressed as hexahistidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography, resulting in a nearly homogenous protein. CouL catalysed the formation of both amide bonds of coumermycin A1, i.e. between the central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and two aminocoumarin moieties. Gel exclusion chromatography showed that the enzyme is active as a monomer. The activity was strictly dependent on the presence of ATP and Mn2+ or Mg2+. The apparent Km values were determined as 26 micro m for the 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and 44 micro m for the aminocoumarin moiety, respectively. Several analogues of the pyrrole dicarboxylic acid were accepted as substrates. In contrast, pyridine carboxylic acids were not accepted. 3-Dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, the acyl component in novobiocin biosynthesis, was well accepted, despite its structural difference from the genuine acyl substrate of CouL."
14622984,Rabbit aorta converts 15-HPETE to trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids: potential role of cytochrome P450.,10.1016/j.abb.2003.09.026,"Previous work showed that rabbit aorta metabolizes arachidonic acid via 15-lipoxygenase to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), which undergoes an enzymatic rearrangement to 11-hydroxy-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11-H-14,15-EETA) and 15-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (15-H-11,12-EETA). Hydrolysis of the epoxy group results in the formation of 11,14,15- and 11,12,15-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (THETAs). Endothelial cells have several heme-containing enzymes including cytochromes P450 (CYP), nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and prostacyclin (PGI(2)) synthase that catalyze the rearrangement of 15-HPETE to HEETAs. Incubation of arachidonic acid and 15-lipoxygenase, or 15-HPETE with rabbit aortic microsomes or rat liver microsomes, a rich source of CYP, resulted in the formation of a product that comigrated with THETAs and HEETAs on HPLC. Immunoblot analysis showed the presence of CYP2C8 and CYP2J2 in aortic tissue and when CYP2J2 or CYP2C8 was incubated with arachidonic acid and 15-lipoxygenase, the major products were 11,12,15- and 11,14,15-THETAs. Incubation of purified hematin, CYP2C11, eNOS or PGI(2) synthase enzymes with arachidonic acid and 15-lipoxygenase produced a different pattern of metabolites from rabbit aortic microsomes. Clotrimazole, a non-specific CYP inhibitor, and ebastine and terfenadone, specific CYP2J2 inhibitors, blocked the ability of aortic microsomes to produce THETAs while specific inhibitors of PGI(2) synthase, eNOS or CYP2C8/2C9 had no effect on THETA production. We suggest that a CYP, possibly CYP2J2, may function as the hydroperoxide isomerase converting 15-HPETE to HEETAs in rabbit vascular tissue. Further hydrolysis of the epoxy group of the HEETAs results in the formation of 11,12,15- and 11,14,15-THETAs. The HEETAs and THETAs are both vasodilators and may function as important regulators of vascular tone."
14623876,"Crystal structure and mechanistic implications of N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine synthase, the first enzyme in the clavulanic acid biosynthesis pathway.",10.1074/jbc.M310803200,"The initial step in the biosynthesis of the clinically important beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid involves condensation of two primary metabolites, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and L-arginine, to give N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine, a beta-amino acid. This unusual N-C bond forming reaction is catalyzed by the thiamin diphosphate (ThP2)-dependent enzyme N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine synthase. Here we report the crystal structure of N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine synthase, complexed with ThP2 and Mg2+, to 2.35-A resolution. The structure was solved in two space groups, P2(1)2(1)2(1) and P2(1)2(1)2. In both, the enzyme is observed in a tetrameric form, composed of a dimer of two more tightly associated dimers, consistent with both mass spectrometric and gel filtration chromatography studies. Both ThP2 and Mg2+ cofactors are present at the active site, with ThP2 in a ""V"" conformation as in related enzymes. A sulfate anion is observed in the active site of the enzyme in a location proposed as a binding site for the phosphate group of the d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate substrate. The mechanistic implications of the active site arrangement are discussed, including the potential role of the aminopyrimidine ring of the ThP2. The structure will form a basis for future mechanistic and structural studies, as well as engineering aimed at production of alternative beta-amino acids."
14626496,Role of cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolites in liver physiology and pathophysiology.,10.1016/s1098-8823(03)00077-7,"Arachidonic acid (AA) can undergo monooxygenation or epoxidation by enzymes in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family in the brain, kidney, lung, vasculature, and the liver. CYP-AA metabolites, 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and diHETEs have different biological properties based on sites of production and can be stored in tissue lipids and released in response to hormonal stimuli. 20-HETE is a vasoconstrictor, causing blockade of Ca(++)-activated K(+) (KCa) channels. Inhibition of the formation of nitric oxide (NO) by 20-HETE mediates most of the cGMP-independent component of the vasodilator response to NO. 20-HETE elicits a potent dilator response in human and rabbit pulmonary vascular and bronchiole rings that is dependent on an intact endothelium and COX. 20-HETE is also a vascular oxygen sensor, inhibits Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity, is an endogenous inhibitor of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-)cotransporter, mediates the mitogenic actions of vasoactive agents and growth factors in many tissues and plays a significant role in angiogenesis. EETs, produced by the vascular endothelium, are potent dilators. EETs hyperpolarize VSM cells by activating KCa channels. Several investigators have proposed that one or more EETs may serve as endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF). EETs constrict human and rabbit bronchioles, are potent mediators of insulin and glucagon release in isolated rat pancreatic islets, and have anti-inflammatory activity. Compared with other organs, the liver has the highest total CYP content and contains the highest levels of individual CYP enzymes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. In humans, 50-75% of CYP-dependent AA metabolites formed by liver microsomes are omega/omega-OH-AA, mainly w-OH-AA, i.e. 20HETE, and 13-28% are EETs. Very little information is available on the role of 19- and 20-HETE and EETs in liver function. EETs are involved in vasopressin-induced glycogenolysis, probably via the activation of phosphorylase. In the portal vein, inhibition of EETs exerts profound effects on a variety of K-channel activities in smooth muscles of this vessel. 20-HETE is a weak, COX-dependent, vasoconstrictor of the portal circulation. EETs, particularly 11,12-EET, cause vasoconstriction of the porto-sinusoidal circulation. Increased synthesis of EETs in portal vessels and/or sinusoids or increased levels in blood from the meseneric circulation may participate in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension of cirrhosis. CYP-dependent AA metabolites are involved in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension, not only by increasing resistance in the porto-sinusoidal circulation, but also by increasing portal inflow through mesenteric vasodilatation. In patients with cirrhosis, urinary 20-HETE is several-fold higher than PGs and TxB2, whereas in normal subjects, 20-HETE and PGs are excreted at similar rates. Thus, 20-HETE is probably produced in increased amounts in the preglomerular microcirculation accounting for the functional decrease of flow and increase in sodium reabsorption. In conclusion, CYP-AA metabolites represent a group of compounds that participate in the regulation of liver metabolic activity and hemodynamics. They appear to be deeply involved in abnormalities related to liver diseases, particularly cirrhosis, and play a key role in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension and renal failure."

14636671,Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs): metabolism and biochemical function.,10.1016/s0163-7827(03)00049-3,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are synthesized from arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases, function primarily as autocrine and paracrine effectors in the cardiovascular system and kidney. They modulate ion transport and gene expression, producing vasorelaxation as well as anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effects. EETs are incorporated into the sn-2 position of phospholipids and are rapidly mobilized when a cell is treated with a Ca(2+) ionophore, suggesting that they may play a role in phospholipid-mediated signal transduction processes. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) converts EETs to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), and inhibition of sEH is a potential approach for enhancing the biological activity of EETs. EETs also undergo chain-elongation and beta-oxidation, and the accumulation of partial beta-oxidation products increases when sEH is inhibited. Some functional effects of EETs occur through activation of either the guanine nucleotide binding protein Galphas or the Src signal transduction pathways, suggesting that EETs act by binding to membrane receptors. However, other evidence indicates that the modulation of gene expression occurs through an intracellular action of EETs. Because of the diversity of biochemical and functional responses produced by EETs, it is doubtful that a single mechanism or signal transduction pathway can account for all of their actions."
14641020,VEGF signalling: integration and multi-tasking in endothelial cell biology.,10.1042/bst0311171,"The central role of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor A) in angiogenesis is dependent upon its ability to co-ordinately regulate multiple endothelial functions. The multifunctionality of VEGF at the cellular level results from its ability to initiate a diverse, complex and integrated network of signalling pathways via its major receptor, kinase-insert-domain-containing receptor (KDR). Activation of phospholipase C-gamma, protein kinase C, Ca(2+), ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase), Akt, Src, focal adhesion kinase and calcineurin pathways has been implicated in mediating multiple VEGF functions, including survival, proliferation, migration, vascular permeability, tubulogenesis, NO and prostanoid synthesis, and gene expression. NO and prostanoids in turn play paracrine and autocrine roles in linking post-receptor signalling to biological functions. Integration between biologically important signalling cascades occurs at several points. Akt and ERK, for example, are key junction points linking together signal transduction involved in survival and NO generation, and proliferation and prostanoid biosynthesis. Together, the multiplicity, functional versatility and integration of VEGF signalling provide a useful framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the endothelial biological response to this key factor."

We have identified a novel cytochrome P450, CYP2U1, which may play an important role in modulating the arachidonic acid signaling pathway. Northern blot and real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that CYP2U1 transcripts were most abundant in the thymus and the brain (cerebellum), indicating a specific physiological role for CYP2U1 in these tissues. Recombinant human CYP2U1 protein, expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, was found to metabolize arachidonic acid exclusively to two region-specific products as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These metabolites were identified as 19- and 20-hydroxy-modified arachidonic acids by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. In addition to omega/omega-1 hydroxylation of arachidonic acid, CYP2U1 protein also catalyzed the hydroxylation of structurally related long chain fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) but not fatty acids such as lauric acid or linoleic acid. This is the first report of the cloning and functional expression of a new human member of P450 family 2, CYP2U1, which metabolizes long chain fatty acids. Based on the ability of CYP2U1 to generate bioactive eicosanoid derivatives, we postulate that CYP2U1 plays an important physiological role in fatty acid signaling processes in both cerebellum and thymus."
14663079,Pathways for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in bacteria.,10.1099/mic.0.26522-0,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in eukaryotes with important structural and signalling functions. Although many prokaryotes lack PC, it can be found in significant amounts in membranes of rather diverse bacteria. Two pathways for PC biosynthesis are known in bacteria, the methylation pathway and the phosphatidylcholine synthase (PCS) pathway. In the methylation pathway, phosphatidylethanolamine is methylated three times to yield PC, in reactions catalysed by one or several phospholipid N-methyltransferases (PMTs). In the PCS pathway, choline is condensed directly with CDP-diacylglyceride to form PC in a reaction catalysed by PCS. Using cell-free extracts, it was demonstrated that Sinorhizobium meliloti, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Mesorhizobium loti and Legionella pneumophila have both PMT and PCS activities. In addition, Rhodobacter sphaeroides has PMT activity and Brucella melitensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Borrelia burgdorferi have PCS activities. Genes from M. loti and L. pneumophila encoding a Pmt or a Pcs activity and the genes from P. aeruginosa and Borrelia burgdorferi responsible for Pcs activity have been identified. Based on these functional assignments and on genomic data, one might predict that if bacteria contain PC as a membrane lipid, they usually possess both bacterial pathways for PC biosynthesis. However, important pathogens such as Brucella melitensis, P. aeruginosa and Borrelia burgdorferi seem to be exceptional as they possess only the PCS pathway for PC formation."

The conversion of sunlight into chemical energy is driven by two multisubunit membrane protein complexes named photosystem I and II. We determined the crystal structure of the complete photosystem I (PSI) from a higher plant (Pisum sativum var. alaska) to 4.4 A resolution. Its intricate structure shows 12 core subunits, 4 different light-harvesting membrane proteins (LHCI) assembled in a half-moon shape on one side of the core, 45 transmembrane helices, 167 chlorophylls, 3 Fe-S clusters and 2 phylloquinones. About 20 chlorophylls are positioned in strategic locations in the cleft between LHCI and the core. This structure provides a framework for exploration not only of energy and electron transfer but also of the evolutionary forces that shaped the photosynthetic apparatus of terrestrial plants after the divergence of chloroplasts from marine cyanobacteria one billion years ago."

Understanding the specific regulation of the Notch pathway in different contexts and its interaction with other signaling pathways remains an important challenge to comprehend the full spectrum of Notch effects. In this review, we critically assess recent findings regarding the function of Notch in the hematolymphoid system."

It is a repeat unit polysaccharide and consists of a number of repeats of an oligosaccharide, the O-unit, which generally has between two and six sugar residues. O-Antigens are extremely variable, the variation lying in the nature, order and linkage of the different sugars within the polysaccharide. The genes involved in O-antigen biosynthesis are generally found on the chromosome as an O-antigen gene cluster, and the structural variation of O-antigens is mirrored by genetic variation seen in these clusters. The genes within the cluster fall into three major groups. The first group is involved in nucleotide sugar biosynthesis. These genes are often found together in the cluster and have a high level of identity. The genes coding for a significant number of nucleotide sugar biosynthesis pathways have been identified and these pathways seem to be conserved in different O-antigen clusters and across a wide range of species. The second group, the glycosyl transferases, is involved in sugar transfer. They are often dispersed throughout the cluster and have low levels of similarity. The third group is the O-antigen processing genes. This review is a summary of the current knowledge on these three groups of genes that comprise the O-antigen gene clusters, focusing on the most extensively studied E. coli and S. enterica gene clusters."

This enzyme activity has not yet been detected in plants. A proteomic analysis of P. somniferum latex identified a gel spot that contained a protein(s) whose partial amino acid sequences were homologous to those of plant O-methyltransferases. cDNA was amplified from P. somniferum RNA by reverse transcription PCR using primers based on these internal amino acid sequences. Recombinant protein was then expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells in a baculovirus expression vector. Steady-state kinetic measurements with one heterologously expressed enzyme and mass spectrometric analysis of the enzymatic products suggested that this unusual enzyme is capable of carrying through sequential O-methylations on the isoquinoline and on the benzyl moiety of several substrates. The tetrahydrobenzylisoquinolines (R)-reticuline (4.2 sec(-1) mm(-1)), (S)-reticuline (4.5 sec(-1) mm(-1)), (R)-protosinomenine (1.7 sec(-1) mm(-1)), and (R,S)-isoorientaline (1.4 sec(-1) mm(-1)) as well as guaiacol (5.9 sec(-1) mm(-1)) and isovanillic acid (1.2 sec(-1) mm(-1)) are O-methylated by the enzyme with the ratio kcat/K m shown in parentheses.

H. pylori induces gastric inflammation, and the diseases that can follow such infection include chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers and, more rarely, gastric cancer. The reasons why a minority of patients with H. pylori develops gastric cancer could be related to differences in host susceptibility, environmental factors and the genetic diversity of the organism. This review examines the features of H. pylori-induced epithelial cell signalling in gastric diseases. Clinical studies and animal models, and also evidence for H. pylori strain-related differences in gastric epithelial cell proliferation in vivo are discussed. In addition, the mechanisms by which H. pylori triggers hyperproliferative processes and takes direct command of epithelial cell signalling, including activation of tyrosine kinase receptors, cell-cell interactions and cell motility are reviewed."

Of these, two independent fixB mutants carried missense substitutions in the product electron-transferring flavoprotein N (ETFN) alpha-subunit. Both thermolabile missense variants Y238H and D229G mapped to the ETFNalpha interdomain linker. Unlinked thermostable suppressors of these two fixB missense mutants were identified and mapped to the lpdA gene, encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LpDH), immediately distal to the pdhABC genes, which collectively encode the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. These two suppressor alleles encoded LpDH NAD-binding domain missense mutants G187S and E210G. Crude cell extracts of these fixB lpdA double mutants showed 60-70% of the wild-type PDH activity; neither fixB lpdA double mutant strain exhibited any growth phenotype at the restrictive or the permissive temperature. The genetic interaction between two combinations of lpdA and fixB missense alleles implies a physical interaction of their respective products, LpDH and ETFN. Presumably, this interaction electrochemically couples LpDH as the electron donor to ETFN as the electron acceptor, allowing PDH complex activity (pyruvate oxidation) to drive soluble electron transport via ETFN to N2, which acts as the terminal electron acceptor. If so, then, the A. caulinodans PDH complex activity sustains N2 fixation both as the driving force for oxidative phosphorylation and as the metabolic electron donor."

Moreover, we found that among the other five beta3Gn-Ts and i antigen-producing beta3Gn-T (iGn-T), beta3Gn-T2 and iGn-T act well on L2L2, although these specific activities were lower than those for a tetraantennary N-glycan. These results indicate that beta3Gn-T7 is the one that most efficiently elongates L2L2 and may be involved in the biosynthesis of keratan sulfate."
14711645,Novel pathway for utilization of cyclopropanecarboxylate by Rhodococcus rhodochrous.,10.1128/AEM.70.1.224-228.2004,"A new strain isolated from soil utilizes cyclopropanecarboxylate as the sole source of carbon and energy and was identified as Rhodococcus rhodochrous (H.

A novel pathway for the utilization of cyclopropanecarboxylate, a highly strained compound, by this bacterium was investigated. Cyclopropanecarboxylate-dependent reduction of NAD(+) in cell extracts of cyclopropanecarboxylate-grown cells was observed. When intermediates accumulated in vitro in the absence of NAD(+) were trapped as hydroxamic acids by reaction with hydroxylamine, cyclopropanecarboxohydroxamic acid and 3-hydroxybutyrohydroxamic acid were formed. Cyclopropanecarboxyl-coenzyme A (CoA), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and crotonyl-CoA were oxidized with NAD(+) in cell extracts, whereas methacrylyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA were not. When both CoA and ATP were added, organic acids corresponding to the former three CoA thioesters were also oxidized in vitro by NAD(+), while methacrylate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and 2-hydroxybutyrate were not. Therefore, it was concluded that cyclopropanecarboxylate undergoes oxidative degradation through cyclopropanecarboxyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The enzymes catalyzing formation and ring opening of cyclopropanecarboxyl-CoA were shown to be inducible, while other enzymes involved in the degradation were constitutive."
14715912,Long-term potentiation and memory.,10.1152/physrev.00014.2003,"One of the most significant challenges in neuroscience is to identify the cellular and molecular processes that underlie learning and memory formation. The past decade has seen remarkable progress in understanding changes that accompany certain forms of acquisition and recall, particularly those forms which require activation of afferent pathways in the hippocampus. This progress can be attributed to a number of factors including well-characterized animal models, well-defined probes for analysis of cell signaling events and changes in gene transcription, and technology which has allowed gene knockout and overexpression in cells and animals. Of the several animal models used in identifying the changes which accompany plasticity in synaptic connections, long-term potentiation (LTP) has received most attention, and although it is not yet clear whether the changes that underlie maintenance of LTP also underlie memory consolidation, significant advances have been made in understanding cell signaling events that contribute to this form of synaptic plasticity. In this review, emphasis is focused on analysis of changes that occur after learning, especially spatial learning, and LTP and the value of assessing these changes in parallel is discussed. The effect of different stressors on spatial learning/memory and LTP is emphasized, and the review concludes with a brief analysis of the contribution of studies, in which transgenic animals were used, to the literature on memory/learning and LTP."
14724572,Phosphorylation of tyrosine 1214 on VEGFR2 is required for VEGF-induced activation of Cdc42 upstream of SAPK2/p38.,10.1038/sj.onc.1207034,"Activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) by VEGF leads to the activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)2/p38 and then to actin polymerization and reorganization into stress fibers in endothelial cells. In turn, this triggers endothelial cell migration. Yet, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that couple VEGFR2 to SAPK2/p38. Here, we found that VEGF increased by twofold the activity of the small GTPase Cdc42 and that the expression of two different constitutively active forms of Cdc42 (Cdc42 V12 and Cdc42 L61) led to a marked increase in the formation of stress fibers that was sensitive to SAPK2/p38 inhibition by SB203580. Moreover, the expression of a dominant-negative form of Cdc42 (Cdc42 N17) inhibited the activation of SAPK2/p38 and of its direct target MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2. These results indicate that Cdc42 is upstream of SAPK2/p38 in response to the activation of VEGFR2 by VEGF. In contrast, we found that neither RhoA nor Rac was involved in the SAPK2/p38-mediated actin reorganization induced by VEGF. Using a site-specific mutant of the major autophosphorylation site Y1214 on VEGFR2, we found that the mutant Y1214F inhibited the activation of both Cdc42 and SAPK2/p38 in response to VEGF. We conclude that phosphorylation of Y1214 on VEGFR2 is required to trigger the sequential activation of Cdc42 and SAPK2/p38 and to drive the SAPK2/p38-mediated actin remodeling in stress fibers in endothelial cells exposed to VEGF."
14726522,Distinct isoprenoid origins of cis- and trans-zeatin biosyntheses in Arabidopsis.,10.1074/jbc.M314195200,"Plants produce the common isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) through the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol. To assess which pathways contribute DMAPP for cytokinin biosynthesis, metabolites from each isoprenoid pathway were selectively labeled with (13)C in Arabidopsis seedlings. Efficient (13)C labeling was achieved by blocking the endogenous pathway genetically or chemically during the feed of a (13)C labeled precursor specific to the MEP or MVA pathways. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the prenyl group of trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyladenine is mainly produced through the MEP pathway. In comparison, a large fraction of the prenyl group of cis-zeatin (cZ) derivatives was provided by the MVA pathway. When expressed as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis cells, four adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferases (AtIPT1, AtIPT3, AtIPT5, and AtIPT8) were found in plastids, in agreement with the idea that the MEP pathway primarily provides DMAPP to tZ and isopentenyladenine. On the other hand, AtIPT2, a tRNA isopentenyltransferase, was detected in the cytosol. Because the prenylated adenine moiety of tRNA is usually of the cZ type, the formation of cZ in Arabidopsis seedlings might involve the transfer of DMAPP from the MVA pathway to tRNA. Distinct origins of large proportions of DMAPP for tZ and cZ biosynthesis suggest that plants are able to separately modulate the level of these cytokinin species."
14735553,Pathophysiology of acute graft-versus-host disease.,10.1002/hon.716,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been the primary limitation to the wider application of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The pathophysiology of acute GVHD is complex and can be conceptualized to be a three-step process based on murine studies. In step 1, the conditioning regimen leads to the damage and activation of host tissues and induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. As a consequence, the expression of MHC antigens and adhesion molecules is increased enhancing the recognition of host alloantigens by donor T cells. Donor T-cell activation in step 2 is characterized by donor T cell interaction with host APCs and subsequent proliferation, differentiation and secretion of cytokines. Cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-gamma enhance T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cell responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. These inflammatory cytokines in turn stimulate production of inflammatory chemokines, thus recruiting effector cells into target organs. In step 3, effector functions of mononuclear phagocytes are triggered via a secondary signal provided by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that leaks through the intestinal mucosa damaged during step 1. This mechanism may result in the amplification of local tissue injury and further promotion of an inflammatory response, which, together with the CTL and NK components, leads to target tissue destruction in the transplant host. The following review discusses the three-step process of the pathophysiology of experimental acute GVHD."

Heynh. are biosynthesized from methionine involving a three-step chain-elongation cycle. Each passage through the cycle results in the net addition of a single methylene group, with up to six cycles of elongation occurring in A. thaliana. The first reaction of the cycle is catalyzed by a methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAMS), which condenses a omega-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acid with acetyl-CoA. Here we have demonstrated that MAM1, one of two similar genes in the A. thaliana ecotype Columbia, encodes a MAMS catalyzing the condensing reactions of the first two elongation cycles but not those of further cycles. The Columbia ecotype is dominated by compounds that have undergone only two elongation cycles. The A. thaliana MAM1 protein exhibits basic sequence similarity to other previously described enzymes catalyzing the condensation of 2-oxo acids and acetyl-CoA, such as isopropylmalate synthase (EC 2.3.3.13), an enzyme of leucine biosynthesis, and homocitrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.14). It also shares similar properties with them, including the catalytic requirements for a divalent metal ion and an adenine nucleotide. However, the MAM1 protein does not show activity with the substrates of any of these other enzymes, and was chromatographically separable from isopropylmalate synthase in extracts of A. thaliana. Thus, MAM1 is exclusively an enzyme of secondary metabolism, distinct from primary metabolic enzymes catalyzing similar reactions."
14749334,Bacillus subtilis CheC and FliY are members of a novel class of CheY-P-hydrolyzing proteins in the chemotactic signal transduction cascade.,10.1074/jbc.M311497200,"Rapid restoration of prestimulus levels of the chemotactic response regulator, CheY-P, is important for preparing bacteria and archaea to respond sensitively to new stimuli. In an extension of previous work (Szurmant, H., Bunn, M. W., Cannistraro, V. J., and Ordal, G. W. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 48611-48616), we describe a new family of CheY-P phosphatases, the CYX family, that is widespread among the bacteria and archaea. These proteins provide another pathway, in addition to the ones involving CheZ of the gamma- and beta-proteobacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli) or the alternative CheY that serves as a ""phosphate sink"" among the alpha-proteobacteria (e.g. Sinorhizobium meliloti), for dephosphorylating CheY-P. In particular, we identify CheC, known previously to be involved in adaptation to stimuli in Bacillus subtilis, as a CheY-P phosphatase. Using an in vitro assay used previously to demonstrate that the switch protein FliY is a CheY-P phosphatase, we have shown that increasing amounts of CheC accelerate the hydrolysis of CheY-P. In vivo, a double mutant lacking cheC and the region of fliY that encodes the CheY-P binding domain is almost completely smooth swimming, implying that these cells contain very high levels of CheY-P. CheC appears to be primarily involved in restoring normal CheY-P levels following the addition of attractant, whereas FliY seems to act on CheY-P constitutively. The activity of CheC is relatively low compared to that of FliY, but we have shown that the chemotaxis protein CheD enhances the activity of CheC 5-fold. We suggest a model for how FliY, CheC, and CheD work together to regulate CheY-P levels in the bacterium."
14764885,Architecture of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving center.,10.1126/science.1093087,"Photosynthesis uses light energy to drive the oxidation of water at an oxygen-evolving catalytic site within photosystem II (PSII). We report the structure of PSII of the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus at 3.5 angstrom resolution. We have assigned most of the amino acid residues of this 650-kilodalton dimeric multisubunit complex and refined the structure to reveal its molecular architecture. Consequently, we are able to describe details of the binding sites for cofactors and propose a structure of the oxygen-evolving center (OEC). The data strongly suggest that the OEC contains a cubane-like Mn3CaO4 cluster linked to a fourth Mn by a mono-micro-oxo bridge. The details of the surrounding coordination sphere of the metal cluster and the implications for a possible oxygen-evolving mechanism are discussed."
14764886,The structure and receptor binding properties of the 1918 influenza hemagglutinin.,10.1126/science.1093155,"The 1918 influenza pandemic resulted in about 20 million deaths. This enormous impact, coupled with renewed interest in emerging infections, makes characterization of the virus involved a priority. Receptor binding, the initial event in virus infection, is a major determinant of virus transmissibility that, for influenza viruses, is mediated by the hemagglutinin (HA) membrane glycoprotein. We have determined the crystal structures of the HA from the 1918 virus and two closely related HAs in complex with receptor analogs. They explain how the 1918 HA, while retaining receptor binding site amino acids characteristic of an avian precursor HA, is able to bind human receptors and how, as a consequence, the virus was able to spread in the human population."
14766543,Genes coding for hepatotoxic heptapeptides (microcystins) in the cyanobacterium Anabaena strain 90.,10.1128/AEM.70.2.686-692.2004,"The cluster of microcystin synthetase genes from Anabaena strain 90 was sequenced and characterized. The total size of the region is 55.4 kb, and the genes are organized in three putative operons. The first operon (mcyA-mcyB-mcyC) is transcribed in the opposite direction from the second operon (mcyG-mcyD-mcyJ-mcyE-mcyF-mcyI) and the third operon (mcyH). The genes mcyA, mcyB, and mcyC encode nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), while mcyD codes for a polyketide synthase (PKS), and mcyG and mcyE are mixed NRPS-PKS genes. The genes mcyJ, mcyF, and mcyI are similar to genes coding for a methyltransferase, an aspartate racemase, and a D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, respectively. The region in the first module of mcyB coding for the adenylation domain was found to be 96% identical with the corresponding part of mcyC, suggesting a recent duplication of this fragment and a replacement in mcyB. In Anabaena strain 90, the order of the domains encoded by the genes in the two sets (from mcyG to mcyI and from mcyA to mcyC) is colinear with the hypothetical order of the enzymatic reactions for microcystin biosynthesis. The order of the microcystin synthetase genes in Anabaena strain 90 differs from the arrangement found in two other cyanobacterial species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii. The average sequence match between the microcystin synthetase genes of Anabaena strain 90 and the corresponding genes of the other species is 74%. The identity of the individual proteins varies from 67 to 81%. The genes of microcystin biosynthesis from three major producers of this toxin are now known. This makes it possible to design probes and primers to identify the toxin producers in the environment."

14977550,Catabolism of caffeine in plants and microorganisms.,10.2741/1339,"Caffeine has been found in tissues of several plants. Because of its stimulating effect on the central nervous system, a great number of reports have been published on its content in beverages and foodstuffs. However, a much more restricted number of reports have dealt specifically with caffeine metabolism in plants. This review presents, in chronological manner, the contribution of these reports to the vast knowledge accumulated on caffeine catabolism in plants and microorganisms over the last 40 years. In plants, the accumulated data indicate the operation of a main catabolic pathway: caffeine --> theophylline --> 3-methylxantine --> xanthine --> uric acid --> allantoin --> allantoic acid --> glyoxylic acid + urea --> NH3 + CO2. Some studies have shown that, depending on the plant species, other minor routes may operate with the formation of theobromine and 7-methylxantine, which are salvaged for caffeine formation since they also appear in the biosynthetic pathway. A specific group of coffee known as liberio-excelsioides has the ability to convert caffeine to the corresponding methyluric acid, which is methylated to other uric acid derivatives. In bacteria caffeine is either degraded to theobromine or paraxanthine. Both dimethylxanthines are demethylated to 7-methylxantine which in turn is demethylated to xanthine and then enters the catabolic pathway of purines. In bacteria, theobromine, paraxanthine and 7-methylxantine may also be oxidized to their corresponding methyluric acids."

Mammals have four Notch receptors that bind five different ligands. The function of Notch signaling during lymphopoiesis and T cell neoplasia, based on gain-of-function and conditional loss-of-function approaches for the Notch1 receptor, indicates Notch1 is essential in T cell lineage commitment. Recent studies have addressed the involvement of other Notch receptors and ligands as well as their downstream targets, demonstrating additional functions of Notch signaling in embryonic hematopoiesis, intrathymic T cell development, B cell development and peripheral T cell function."
14993306,"The fifth gene of the iol operon of Bacillus subtilis, iolE, encodes 2-keto-myo-inositol dehydratase.",10.1099/mic.0.26768-0,"The myo-inositol catabolism pathway of Bacillus subtilis has not been fully characterized but was proposed to involve step-wise multiple reactions that finally yielded acetyl-CoA and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. It is known that the iolABCDEFGHIJ operon is responsible for the catabolism of inositol. IolG catalyses the first step of myo-inositol catabolism, the dehydrogenation of myo-inositol, producing 2-keto-myo-inositol (inosose). The second step was thought to be the dehydration of inosose. Genetic and biochemical analyses of the iol genes led to the identification of iolE, encoding the enzyme for the second step of inositol catabolism, inosose dehydratase. The reaction product of inosose dehydratase was identified as D-2,3-diketo-4-deoxy-epi-inositol."
14996803,Regulation of expression of the divergent ulaG and ulaABCDEF operons involved in LaAscorbate dissimilation in Escherichia coli.,10.1128/JB.186.6.1720-1728.2004,"The ula regulon, responsible for the utilization of L-ascorbate in Escherichia coli, is formed by two divergently transcribed operons, ulaG and ulaABCDEF. The regulon is negatively regulated by a repressor of the DeoR family which is encoded by the constitutive gene ulaR located downstream of ulaG. Full repression of the ula regulon requires simultaneous interaction of the repressor with both divergent promoters and seems to be dependent on repressor-mediated DNA loop formation, which is helped by the action of integration host factor. Two operator sites have been identified in each promoter. Lack of either of the two sets of operators partially relieved the repression of the other operon; thus, each promoter is dependent on the UlaR operator sites of the other promoter to enhance repression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified UlaR protein and promoter deletion analyses revealed a conserved sequence, present in each of the four operators, acting as a UlaR binding site. Glucose represses the ula regulon via at least two mechanisms, one dependent on cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and the other (possibly inducer exclusion) independent of it. Glucose effects mediated by other global regulators cannot be ruled out with the present information. Changes in cAMP-CRP levels affected only the expression of the ulaABCDEF operon."

Cloning of bergaptol O-methyltransferase.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.03995.x,"Plants belonging to the Apiaceae or Rutaceae accumulate methoxylated psoralens, such as bergapten or xanthotoxin, as the final products of their furanocoumarin biosynthesis, and the rate of accumulation depends on environmental and other cues. Distinct O-methyltransferase activities had been reported to methylate bergaptol to bergapten and xanthotoxol to xanthotoxin, from induced cell cultures of Ruta graveolens, Petroselinum crispum and Ammi majus. Bergaptol 5-O-methyltransferase (BMT) cDNA was cloned from dark-grown Ammi majus L. cells treated with a crude fungal elicitor. The translated polypeptide of 38.7 kDa, composed of 354 amino acids, revealed considerable sequence similarity to heterologous caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferases (COMTs). For homologous comparison, COMT was cloned from A. majus plants and shown to share 64% identity and about 79% similarity with the BMT sequence at the polypeptide level. Functional expression of both enzymes in Escherichia coli revealed that the BMT activity in the bacterial extracts was labile and rapidly lost on purification, whereas the COMT activity remained stable. Furthermore, the recombinant AmBMT, which was most active in potassium phosphate buffer of pH 8 at 42 degrees C, showed narrow substrate specificity for bergaptol (Km SAM 6.5 micro m; Km Bergaptol 2.8 micro m) when assayed with a variety of substrates, including xanthotoxol, while the AmCOMT accepted 5-hydroxyferulic acid, esculetin and other substrates. Dark-grown A. majus cells expressed significant BMT activity which nevertheless increased sevenfold within 8 h upon the addition of elicitor and reached a transient maximum at 8-11 h, whereas the COMT activity was rather low and did not respond to the elicitation. Complementary Northern blotting revealed that the BMT transcript abundance increased to a maximum at 7 h, while only a weak constitutive signal was observed for the COMT transcript. The AmBMT sequence thus represents a novel database accession specific for the biosynthesis of psoralens."

Sterigmatocystin is a penultimate precursor of aflatoxins and also a toxic and carcinogenic substance produced by many species, including Aspergillus nidulans. Recently, the majority of the enzyme reactions involved in aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin biosynthesis have been clarified, and the genes encoding the enzymes have been isolated. Most of the genes constitute a large gene cluster in the fungal genome, and their expression is mostly regulated by a product of the regulatory gene aflR. This review will summarize the enzymatic steps and the genes in aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin biosynthesis."
15026169,Halloween genes encode P450 enzymes that mediate steroid hormone biosynthesis in Drosophila melanogaster.,10.1016/j.mce.2003.11.003,"Mutation of members of the Halloween gene family results in embryonic lethality. We have shown that two of these genes code for enzymes responsible for specific steps in the synthesis of ecdysone, a polyhydroxylated sterol that is the precursor of the major molting hormone of all arthropods, 20-hydroxyecdysone. These two mitochondrial P450 enzymes, coded for by disembodied (dib) (CYP302A1) and shadow (sad) (CYP315A1), are the C22 and C2 hydroxylases, respectively, as shown by transfection of the gene into S2 cells and subsequent biochemical analysis. These are the last two enzymes in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. A third enzyme, necessary for the critical conversion of ecdysone to 20-hydroxyecdysone, the 20-monooxygenase, is encoded by shade (shd) (CYP314A1). All three enzymes are mitochondrial although shade has motifs suggesting both mitochondrial and microsomal locations. By tagging these enzymes, their subcellular location has been confirmed by confocal microscopy. Shade is present in several tissues as expected while disembodied and shadow are restricted to the ring gland. The paradigm used should allow us to define the enzymes mediating the entire ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway."
15028942,PDX-1 and the pancreas.,10.1097/00006676-200403000-00001,"Many transcription factors are critical for ensuring proper embryonic development of the endocrine pancreas and normal islet function. The transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) is uniformly expressed in early pancreatic buds of embryos as well as the beta and delta cells of the islets of Langerhans. PDX-1 has also been found in dispersed endocrine cells of the duodenum in adults and plays a key role in pancreas formation. It has been reported that null mutation of PDX-1 in mice results in a failure of the pancreatic bud to expand; thus, the mice die 2-3 days after birth from hyperglycemia and dehydration. Heterozygous PDX-1 mice developed a pancreas but were diabetic. It has been shown that PDX-1 is required for maintaining the pancreatic islet functions by activating gene transcriptions including insulin, somatostatin (SST), islet amyloid polypeptide, glucose transporter type 2, and glucokinase. PDX-1 serves a dual role in pancreatic development. It initially contributes to pancreatic formation during embryogenesis and subsequently regulates the pancreatic islet cell physiology in mature islet cells. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of pancreas formation, especially the function of PDX-1, may contribute to the enhanced treatment and prevention of debilitating diseases such as diabetes, insulinomas, and pancreatic carcinomas."

15033578,Gap junction channel gating.,10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.01.008,"Over the last two decades, the view of gap junction (GJ) channel gating has changed from one with GJs having a single transjunctional voltage-sensitive (V(j)-sensitive) gating mechanism to one with each hemichannel of a formed GJ channel, as well as unapposed hemichannels, containing two, molecularly distinct gating mechanisms. These mechanisms are termed fast gating and slow or 'loop' gating. It appears that the fast gating mechanism is solely sensitive to V(j) and induces fast gating transitions between the open state and a particular substate, termed the residual conductance state. The slow gating mechanism is also sensitive to V(j), but there is evidence that this gate may mediate gating by transmembrane voltage (V(m)), intracellular Ca(2+) and pH, chemical uncouplers and GJ channel opening during de novo channel formation. A distinguishing feature of the slow gate is that the gating transitions appear to be slow, consisting of a series of transient substates en route to opening and closing. Published reports suggest that both sensorial and gating elements of the fast gating mechanism are formed by transmembrane and cytoplamic components of connexins among which the N terminus is most essential and which determines gating polarity. We propose that the gating element of the slow gating mechanism is located closer to the central region of the channel pore and serves as a 'common' gate linked to several sensing elements that are responsive to different factors and located in different regions of the channel."
15033579,"Chemical gating of gap junction channels; roles of calcium, pH and calmodulin.",10.1016/j.bbamem.2003.10.020,"Both Ca(2+) and H(+) play a role in chemical gating of gap junction channels, but, with the possible exception of Cx46 hemichannels, neither of them is likely to induce gating by a direct interaction with connexins. Some evidence suggests that low pH(i) affects gating via an increase in [Ca(2+)](i); in turn, Ca(2+) is likely to induce gating by activation of CaM, which may act directly as a gating particle. The effective concentrations of both Ca(2+) and H(+) vary depending on cell type, type of connexin expressed and procedure employed to increase their cytosolic concentrations; however, pH(i) as high as 7.2 and [Ca(2+)](i) as low as 150 nM or lower have been reported to be effective in some cells. Some data suggest that Ca(2+) and H(+) affect gating by acting synergistically, but other data do not support synergism. Chemical gating follows the activation of a slow gate distinct from the fast V(j)-sensitive gate, and there is evidence that the chemical/slow gate is V(j)-sensitive. At the single channel level, the chemical/slow gate closes the channels slowly and completely, whereas the fast V(j) gate closes the channels rapidly and incompletely. At least three molecular models of channel gating have been proposed, but all of them are mostly based on circumstantial evidence."
15033580,Regulation of gap junctions by tyrosine protein kinases.,10.1016/j.bbamem.2003.10.018,"Most of the gap junction proteins are regulated in part by post-translational phosphorylation. Phosphorylation has been shown to be important in gap junction assembly and turnover, and for channel function in the resting state. Connexin phosphorylation may be altered by the activation of intracellular signaling pathways in response to growth factors, tumor promoters, activated oncogenes, hormones and inflammatory mediators. In some instances altered phosphorylation has been associated with changes in connexin function and in other cases appears to be associated with changes in the levels of the connexin protein and/or mRNA. This review focuses on the role of tyrosine protein kinases in the regulation of gap junctions. The literature is most extensive for connexin43 and those studies are reviewed here. A great deal has been learned in recent years about how connexin43 is regulated by tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways. These pathways are often complex and to some extent are cell type- and stimulus-dependent. Although considerable progress has been made in unraveling the cellular pathways that regulate connexin function, significant challenges remain to be addressed in identifying additional phosphorylation sites and determining the stoichiometries of the phosphorylation events that regulate connexin function and it's interaction with other cellular proteins."

Remarkably, mRNA acquires a complex of proteins at each exon-exon junction during pre-mRNA splicing that influences the subsequent steps of mRNA translation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Complex-loaded mRNA is thought to undergo a pioneer round of translation when still bound by cap-binding proteins CBP80 and CBP20 and poly(A)-binding protein 2. The acquisition and loss of mRNA-associated proteins accompanies the transition from the pioneer round to subsequent rounds of translation, and from translational competence to substrate for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay."

The genome of the alpha-proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 was interpreted to contain a nine-gene cluster encoding the inducible dissimilation of taurine, and this deduced pathway included a regulator, a tripartite ATP-independent transporter, taurine dehydrogenase (TDH; presumably TauXY) as well as Xsc (subgroup 3), a hypothetical protein and phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta). A similar cluster was found in P. denitrificans NKNIS, in contrast to an analogous cluster encoding an ATP-binding cassette transporter in Paracoccus pantotrophus. Inducible TDH, Xsc and Pta were found in extracts of taurine-grown cells of strain NKNIS. TDH oxidized taurine to sulfoacetaldehyde and ammonium ion with cytochrome c as electron acceptor. Whereas Xsc and Pta were soluble enzymes, TDH was located in the particulate fraction, where inducible proteins with the expected masses of TauXY (14 and 50 kDa, respectively) were detected by SDS-PAGE. Xsc and Pta were separated by anion-exchange chromatography. Xsc was effectively pure; the molecular mass of the subunit (64 kDa) and the N-terminal amino acid sequence confirmed the identification of the xsc gene. Inducible isethionate dehydrogenase (IDH), Xsc and Pta were assayed in extracts of isethionate-grown cells of strain NKNIS. IDH was located in the particulate fraction, oxidized isethionate to sulfoacetaldehyde with cytochrome c as electron acceptor and correlated with the expression of a 62 kDa protein. Strain NKNIS excreted sulfite and sulfate during growth with a sulfonate and no sulfite dehydrogenase was detected. There is considerable biochemical, genetic and regulatory complexity in the degradation of these simple molecules."
15080147,Matrix metalloproteinases in reproductive endocrinology.,10.1016/j.tem.2004.01.004,"One of the most common mechanisms for transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is through the release of local EGF-like ligands from transmembrane precursors by the proteolytic action of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These enzymes are crucial factors in the normal physiology of the reproductive system and also participate in neuroendocrine regulation through mediation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) action. Recent studies by Roelle et al. showed that GnRH-induced activation of the EGF-R and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in pituitary gonadotrophs occurs through ectodomain shedding of heparin binding-EGF (HB-EGF) by MMP2 and MMP9, indicating a crucial role for MMPs in GnRH signalling."
15094344,Gap junctions and connexin-interacting proteins.,10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.009,"Gap junctions form channels between adjacent cells. The core proteins of these channels are the connexins. Regulation of gap junction communication (GJC) can be modulated by connexin-associating proteins, such as regulatory protein phosphatases and protein kinases, of which c-Src is the best-studied. Structural proteins, notably zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and microtubules, have been found recently at gap junctions. Along with the expansion of the list of connexin-associating proteins, reports have appeared that suggest that connexins might have additional roles in addition to their channel function, such as transcriptional and cytoskeletal regulation. Here, gap junction interacting proteins are reviewed and their function is addressed. The striking similarity of proteins present at the cytoplasmic face of tight junctions, adherens junctions and gap junctions and their possible role in gene transcription and cytoskeletal anchorage is highlighted."
15109718,Molecular characterization and analysis of the operon encoding the antifungal lipopeptide bacillomycin D.,10.1016/j.femsle.2004.03.011,"Bacillus subtilis AU195 produces bacillomycin D, a cyclic lipopeptide that is an inhibitor of the aflatoxin producing fungus Aspergillus flavus. Sequence analysis of the bacillomycin D operon revealed four ORFs with the structural organization of the peptide synthetases. Disruption of ORF 2, which links the amino acid moiety to the b-amino fatty acid, resulted in the loss of antifungal activity. By comparing the sequence of bacillomycin D, iturin A and mycosubtilin operons, our results showed that intergenic module replacement have occurred between B. subtilis lipopeptide synthetases including the iturin family and the plipastatin and fengycin family."
15120992,Ribosome biogenesis: of knobs and RNA processing.,10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.03.016,"The synthesis of ribosomes in eukaryotes involves processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) and sequential assembly of a large number of ribosomal proteins on the rRNAs. Although we have gained tremendous insights into the processing of pre-rRNA intermediates in the last three decades, little was known about the dynamic nature of ribosome biogenesis. Only recently the development of efficient affinity-purification procedures and mass-spectrometry techniques has allowed the isolation of large pre-ribosomal complexes, which led to the identification of several ribosome assembly intermediates and a large number of novel ribosome assembly factors. In this mini-review, we summarize some of the discoveries that have been made in the field of ribosome biogenesis in the past 30 years and highlight some key aspects about what remains to be learned."
1512203,The acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate pathway enzymes for glycerolipid biosynthesis are present in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1128/jb.174.17.5702-5710.1992,"The presence of the acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (acyl DHAP) pathway in yeasts was investigated by examining three key enzyme activities of this pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the total membrane fraction of S. cerevisiae, we confirmed the presence of both DHAP acyltransferase (DHAPAT; Km = 1.27 mM; Vmax = 5.9 nmol/min/mg of protein) and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT; Km = 0.28 mM; Vmax = 12.6 nmol/min/mg of protein). The properties of these two acyltransferases are similar with respect to thermal stability and optimum temperature of activity but differ with respect to pH optimum (6.5 for GPAT and 7.4 for DHAPAT) and sensitivity toward the sulfhydryl blocking agent N-ethylmaleimide. Total membrane fraction of S. cerevisiae also exhibited acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase (EC 1.1.1.101) activity, which has not been reported previously. The reductase has a Vmax of 3.8 nmol/min/mg of protein for the reduction of hexadecyl DHAP (Km = 15 microM) by NADPH (Km = 20 microM). Both acyl DHAP and alkyl DHAP acted as substrates. NADPH was the specific cofactor. Divalent cations and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the enzymatic reaction. Reductase activity in the total membrane fraction from aerobically grown yeast cells was twice that from anaerobically grown cells. Similarly, DHAPAT and GPAT activities were also greater in aerobically grown yeast cells. The presence of these enzymes, together with the absence of both ether glycerolipids and the ether lipid-synthesizing enzyme (alkyl DHAP synthase) in S. cerevisiae, indicates that non-ether glycerolipids are synthesized in this organism via the acyl DHAP pathway."
15127183,Degradation of o-xylene and m-xylene by a novel sulfate-reducer belonging to the genus Desulfotomaculum.,10.1007/s00203-004-0672-6,"A strictly anaerobic bacterium, strain OX39, was isolated with o-xylene as organic substrate and sulfate as electron acceptor from an aquifer at a former gasworks plant contaminated with aromatic hydrocarbons. Apart from o-xylene, strain OX39 grew on m-xylene and toluene and all three substrates were oxidized completely to CO(2). Induction experiments indicated that o-xylene, m-xylene, and toluene degradation were initiated by different specific enzymes. Methylbenzylsuccinate was identified in supernatants of cultures grown on o-xylene and m-xylene, and benzylsuccinate was detected in supernatants of toluene-grown cells, thus indicating that degradation was initiated in all three cases by fumarate addition to the methyl group. Strain OX39 was sensitive towards sulfide and depended on Fe(II) in the medium as a scavenger of the produced sulfide. Analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene revealed that strain OX39 affiliates with the gram-positive endospore-forming sulfate reducers of the genus Desulfotomaculum and is the first hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacterium in this genus."
15132715,The environment and autoimmune thyroid diseases.,10.1530/eje.0.1500605,"Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and it has been calculated that 80% of the susceptibility to develop Graves' disease is attributable to genes. The concordance rate for AITD among monozygotic twins is, however, well below 1 and environmental factors thus must play an important role. We have attempted to carry out a comprehensive review of all the environmental and hormonal risk factors thought to bring about AITD in genetically predisposed individuals. Low birth weight, iodine excess and deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking, radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders. The use of certain drugs (lithium, interferon-alpha, Campath-1H) also increases the risk of the development of autoimmunity against the thyroid gland. Further research is warranted into the importance of fetal microchimerism and of viral infections capable of mounting an endogenous interferon-alpha response."
15141068,Gene-specific involvement of beta-oxidation in wound-activated responses in Arabidopsis.,10.1104/pp.104.039925,"The coordinated induced expression of beta-oxidation genes is essential to provide the energy supply for germination and postgerminative development. However, very little is known about other functions of beta-oxidation in nonreserve organs. We have identified a gene-specific pattern of induced beta-oxidation gene expression in wounded leaves of Arabidopsis. Mechanical damage triggered the local and systemic induction of only ACX1 among acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (ACX) genes, and KAT2/PED1 among 3-ketoacyl-coenzyme A thiolase (KAT) genes in Arabidopsis. In turn, wounding induced KAT5/PKT2 only systemically. Although most of the beta-oxidation genes were activated by wound-related factors such as dehydration and abscisic acid, jasmonic acid (JA) induced only ACX1 and KAT5. Reduced expression of ACX1 or KAT2 genes, in transgenic plants expressing their corresponding mRNAs in antisense orientation, correlated with defective wound-activated synthesis of JA and with reduced expression of JA-responsive genes. Induced expression of JA-responsive genes by exogenous application of JA was unaffected in those transgenic plants, suggesting that ACX1 and KAT2 play a major role in driving wound-activated responses by participating in the biosynthesis of JA in wounded Arabidopsis plants."
15148404,A gene cluster for secondary metabolism in oat: implications for the evolution of metabolic diversity in plants.,10.1073/pnas.0401301101,"The evolution of the ability to synthesize specialized metabolites is likely to have been key for survival and diversification of different plant species. Oats (Avena spp.) produce antimicrobial triterpenoids (avenacins) that protect against disease. The oat beta-amyrin synthase gene AsbAS1, which encodes the first committed enzyme in the avenacin biosynthetic pathway, is clearly distinct from other plant beta-amyrin synthases. Here we show that AsbAS1 has arisen by duplication and divergence of a cycloartenol synthase-like gene, and that its properties have been refined since the divergence of oats and wheat. Strikingly, we have also found that AsbAS1 is clustered with other genes required for distinct steps in avenacin biosynthesis in a region of the genome that is not conserved in other cereals. Because the components of this gene cluster are required for at least four clearly distinct enzymatic processes (2,3-oxidosqualene cyclization, beta-amyrin oxidation, glycosylation, and acylation), it is unlikely that the cluster has arisen as a consequence of duplication of a common ancestor. Although clusters of paralogous genes are common in plants (e.g., gene clusters for rRNA and specific disease resistance), reports of clusters of genes that do not share sequence relatedness and whose products contribute to a single selectable function are rare [Gierl, A. & Frey, M. (2001) Planta 213, 493-498]. Taken together, our evidence has important implications for the generation of metabolic diversity in plants."
15156179,Core-binding factors in hematopoiesis and immune function.,10.1038/sj.onc.1207763,"Core binding factors are heterodimeric transcription factors containing a DNA binding Runx1, Runx2, or Runx3 subunit, along with a non DNA binding CBF beta subunit. All four subunits are required at one or more stages of hematopoiesis. This review describes the role of Runx1 and CBF beta in the initiation of hematopoiesis in the embryo, and in the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells. We also discuss the later stages of hematopoiesis for which members of the core binding factor family are required, as well as the recently described roles for these proteins in autoimmunity."
15168610,The membrane-bound electron transport system of Methanosarcina species.,10.1023/b:jobb.0000019598.64642.97,"Members of the genus Methanosarcina are strictly anaerobic archaea that derive their metabolic energy from the conversion of a restricted number of substrates to methane. H2 + CO2 are converted to CH4 via the CO2-reducing pathway, while methanol and methylamines are metabolized by the methylotrophic pathway. Two novel electron transport systems are involved in the process of methanogenesis. Both systems are able to use a heterodisulfide as electron acceptor and either H2 or F420H2 as electron acceptors and generate a proton-motive force by redox potential-driven H(+)-translocation. The H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase is composed of an F420-nonreducing hydrogenase and the heterodisulfide reductase. The latter protein is also part of the F420H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase system. The second component of this system is referred to as F420H2 dehydrogenase. The archaeal protein is a homologue of complex I of the respiratory chain from bacteria and mitochondria. This review focuses on the biochemical and genetic characteristics of the three energy-transducing enzymes and on the mechanisms of ion translocation."
15184119,"Protein engineering of toluene-o-xylene monooxygenase from Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1 for synthesizing 4-methylresorcinol, methylhydroquinone, and pyrogallol.",10.1128/AEM.70.6.3253-3262.2004,"Toluene-o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) from Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1 oxidizes toluene to 3- and 4-methylcatechol and oxidizes benzene to form phenol; in this study ToMO was found to also form catechol and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene (1,2,3-THB) from phenol. To synthesize novel dihydroxy and trihydroxy derivatives of benzene and toluene, DNA shuffling of the alpha-hydroxylase fragment of ToMO (TouA) and saturation mutagenesis of the TouA active site residues I100, Q141, T201, and F205 were used to generate random mutants. The mutants were initially identified by screening with a rapid agar plate assay and then were examined further by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. Several regiospecific mutants with high rates of activity were identified; for example, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan)ToMO expressing the F205G TouA saturation mutagenesis variant formed 4-methylresorcinol (0.78 nmol/min/mg of protein), 3-methylcatechol (0.25 nmol/min/mg of protein), and methylhydroquinone (0.088 nmol/min/mg of protein) from o-cresol, whereas wild-type ToMO formed only 3-methylcatechol (1.1 nmol/min/mg of protein). From o-cresol, the I100Q saturation mutagenesis mutant and the M180T/E284G DNA shuffling mutant formed methylhydroquinone (0.50 and 0.19 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively) and 3-methylcatechol (0.49 and 1.5 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively). The F205G mutant formed catechol (0.52 nmol/min/mg of protein), resorcinol (0.090 nmol/min/mg of protein), and hydroquinone (0.070 nmol/min/mg of protein) from phenol, whereas wild-type ToMO formed only catechol (1.5 nmol/min/mg of protein). Both the I100Q mutant and the M180T/E284G mutant formed hydroquinone (1.2 and 0.040 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively) and catechol (0.28 and 2.0 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively) from phenol. Dihydroxybenzenes were further oxidized to trihydroxybenzenes with different regiospecificities; for example, the I100Q mutant formed 1,2,4-THB from catechol, whereas wild-type ToMO formed 1,2,3-THB (pyrogallol). Regiospecific oxidation of the natural substrate toluene was also checked; for example, the I100Q mutant formed 22% o-cresol, 44% m-cresol, and 34% p-cresol, whereas wild-type ToMO formed 32% o-cresol, 21% m-cresol, and 47% p-cresol."
15184572,Rhodococcus opacus expresses the xsc gene to utilize taurine as a carbon source or as a nitrogen source but not as a sulfur source.,10.1099/mic.0.27077-0,"The Gram-positive bacteria Rhodococcus opacus ISO-5 and Rhodococcus sp. RHA1 utilized taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate) as the sole source of carbon or of nitrogen or of sulfur for growth. Different gene clusters and enzymes were active under these different metabolic situations. Under carbon- or nitrogen-limited conditions three enzymes were induced, though to different levels: taurine-pyruvate aminotransferase (Tpa), alanine dehydrogenase (Ald) and sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase (Xsc). The specific activities of these enzymes in R. opacus ISO-5 were sufficient to explain the growth rates under the different conditions. These three enzymes were purified and characterized, and the nature of each reaction was confirmed. Analyses of the genome of Rhodococcus sp. RHA1 revealed a gene cluster, tauR-ald-tpa, putatively encoding regulation and oxidation of taurine, located 20 kbp from the xsc gene and separate from two candidate phosphotransacetylase (pta) genes, as well as many candidate ABC transporters (tauBC). PCR primers allowed the amplification and sequencing of the tauR-ald-tpa gene cluster and the xsc gene in R. opacus ISO-5. The N-terminal sequences of the three tested proteins matched the derived amino acid sequences of the corresponding genes. The sequences of the four genes found in each Rhodococcus strain shared high degrees of identity (>95 % identical positions). RT-PCR studies proved transcription of the xsc gene when taurine was the source of carbon or of nitrogen. Under sulfur-limited conditions no xsc mRNA was generated and no Xsc was detected. Taurine dioxygenase (TauD), the enzyme catalysing the anticipated desulfonative reaction when taurine sulfur is assimilated, was presumed to be present because oxygen-dependent taurine disappearance was demonstrated with taurine-grown cells only. A putative tauD gene (with three other candidates) was detected in strain ISO-5. Regulation of the different forms of metabolism of taurine remains to be elucidated."
15187186,Diversity in chemotaxis mechanisms among the bacteria and archaea.,10.1128/MMBR.68.2.301-319.2004,"The study of chemotaxis describes the cellular processes that control the movement of organisms toward favorable environments. In bacteria and archaea, motility is controlled by a two-component system involving a histidine kinase that senses the environment and a response regulator, a very common type of signal transduction in prokaryotes. Most insights into the processes involved have come from studies of Escherichia coli over the last three decades. However, in the last 10 years, with the sequencing of many prokaryotic genomes, it has become clear that E. coli represents a streamlined example of bacterial chemotaxis. While general features of excitation remain conserved among bacteria and archaea, specific features, such as adaptational processes and hydrolysis of the intracellular signal CheY-P, are quite diverse. The Bacillus subtilis chemotaxis system is considerably more complex and appears to be similar to the one that existed when the bacteria and archaea separated during evolution, so that understanding this mechanism should provide insight into the variety of mechanisms used today by the broad sweep of chemotactic bacteria and archaea. However, processes even beyond those used in E. coli and B. subtilis have been discovered in other organisms. This review emphasizes those used by B. subtilis and these other organisms but also gives an account of the mechanism in E. coli."
15205388,The effect of isoniazid on CYP2E1- and CYP4A-mediated hydroxylation of arachidonic acid in the rat liver and kidney.,10.1124/dmd.32.7.727,"Cytochrome P450 (P450) bioactivation of arachidonic acid to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) has been reported to be isoform- and tissue-specific. To determine whether altered P450 expression affects the production of these metabolites, the formation of HETEs after isoniazid-mediated CYP2E1 induction was evaluated in the rat liver and kidney. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received isoniazid (200 mg/kg) or saline intraperitoneally once daily for 5 days. Chlorzoxazone, lauric acid, and arachidonic acid hydroxylation was measured in liver and kidney microsomes with and without preincubation with the specific CYP2E1 inhibitor, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (DCE). P450 isoform content and tissue HETE metabolite concentrations were also determined. Isoniazid increased CYP2E1 protein, and the 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone formation rate was increased by 2.7 +/- 0.3- and 2.2 +/- 0.5-fold in liver and kidney, respectively. Formation of 19-HETE and 11-hydroxylauric acid was induced 2.3 +/- 0.6-fold and 2.2 +/- 0.4-fold in the liver, respectively, with no difference in the kidney. All of the induced activities were attenuated by DCE. An unanticipated decrease in liver CYP4A expression and in vitro 20-HETE formation rate was observed after isoniazid administration. Isoniazid decreased liver and kidney 20-HETE content to 34 +/- 10% and 15.6 +/- 5.3% of control, respectively, without significantly altering tissue 19-HETE concentration. Based on these findings, we conclude that under induced conditions, CYP2E1 is a primary enzyme involved in liver, but not kidney, formation of 19-HETE. In addition, formation of both CYP4A and 20-HETE is reduced in the liver by isoniazid. It was also demonstrated that tissue concentrations parallel in vitro inhibited formation rates for 20-HETE, but not the induced 19-HETE formation in the liver."
15231405,Xanthohumol and related prenylflavonoids from hops and beer: to your good health!,10.1016/j.phytochem.2004.04.025,"Xanthohumol (3'-[3,3-dimethyl allyl]-2',4',4-trihydroxy-6'-methoxychalcone) is the principal prenylated flavonoid of the female inflorescences of the hop plant ('hops'), an ingredient of beer. Human exposure to xanthohumol and related prenylflavonoids, such as 8-prenylnaringenin and isoxanthohumol, is primarily through beer consumption. Xanthohumol has been characterized a 'broad-spectrum' cancer chemopreventive agent in in vitro studies, while 8-prenylnaringenin enjoys fame as the most potent phytoestrogen known to date. These biological activities suggest that prenylflavonoids from hops have potential for application in cancer prevention programs and in prevention or treatment of (post-)menopausal 'hot flashes' and osteoporosis. Xanthohumol and 8-prenylnaringenin are metabolized into many flavonoid derivatives with modified 3,3-dimethyl allyl (prenyl) moieties. Xanthohumol is formed in lupulin glands by a specialized branch of flavonoid biosynthesis that involves prenylation and O-methylation of the polyketide intermediate chalconaringenin. Although a lupulin gland-specific chalcone synthase is known, the aromatic prenyltransferase and O-methyltransferase participating in xanthohumol have not been identified. The prenylflavonoid pathway is a possible target for breeding or biotechnological modification of hops with the aim of increasing xanthohumol levels for beer brewing and 8-prenylnaringenin levels for pharmaceutical production."
15261671,Cargo recognition during clathrin-mediated endocytosis: a team effort.,10.1016/j.ceb.2004.06.001,Transmembrane proteins destined to endosomes are selectively accumulated in clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane and rapidly internalized in clathrin-coated vesicles. The recognition of specific sequence motifs in transmembrane cargo by coated-pit proteins confers specificity on the endocytic process. Interaction of membrane cargo with the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-2 is the major mechanism of cargo sorting into coated pits in mammalian cells. Recent studies have revealed a variety of alternative mechanisms of cargo recruitment involving additional adaptor proteins. These alternative mechanisms appear to be particularly important during clathrin-mediated endocytosis of signaling receptors.
15280363,Arabidopsis CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 encode cytokinin hydroxylases that catalyze the biosynthesis of trans-Zeatin.,10.1074/jbc.M406337200,"Cytokinins (CKs), a group of phytohormones, are adenine derivatives that carry either an isoprene-derived or an aromatic side chain at the N(6) terminus. trans-Zeatin (tZ), an isoprenoid CK, is assumed to play a central physiological role because of its general occurrence and high activity in bioassays. Although hydroxylation of isopentenyladenine-type CKs is a key step of tZ biosynthesis, the catalyzing enzyme has not been characterized yet. Here we demonstrate that CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) that catalyze the biosynthesis of tZ. We identified the genes from Arabidopsis using an adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (AtIPT4)/P450 co-expression system in yeast. Co-expression of AtIPT4 and CYP735A enabled yeast to excrete tZ and the nucleosides to the culture medium. In vitro, both CYP735As preferentially utilized isopentenyladenine nucleotides rather than the nucleoside and free base forms and produced tZ nucleotides but not the cis-isomer. The expression of CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 was differentially regulated in terms of organ specificity and response to CK. Root-specific induction of CYP735A2 expression by CK suggests that the trans-hydroxylation is involved in the regulation of CK metabolism and signaling in roots."
15292141,Isoleucine biosynthesis in Leptospira interrogans serotype lai strain 56601 proceeds via a threonine-independent pathway.,10.1128/JB.186.16.5400-5409.2004,"Three leuA-like protein-coding sequences were identified in Leptospira interrogans. One of these, the cimA gene, was shown to encode citramalate synthase (EC 4.1.3.-). The other two encoded alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (EC 4.1.3.12). Expressed in Escherichia coli, the citramalate synthase was purified and characterized. Although its activity was relatively low, it was strictly specific for pyruvate as the keto acid substrate. Unlike the citramalate synthase of the thermophile Methanococcus jannaschii, the L. interrogans enzyme is temperature sensitive but exhibits a much lower K(m) (0.04 mM) for pyruvate. The reaction product was characterized as (R)-citramalate, and the proposed beta-methyl-d-malate pathway was further confirmed by demonstrating that citraconate was the substrate for the following reaction. This alternative pathway for isoleucine biosynthesis from pyruvate was analyzed both in vitro by assays of leptospiral isopropylmalate isomerase (EC 4.2.1.33) and beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.85) in E. coli extracts bearing the corresponding clones and in vivo by complementation of E. coli ilvA, leuC/D, and leuB mutants. Thus, the existence of a leucine-like pathway for isoleucine biosynthesis in L. interrogans under physiological conditions was unequivocally proven. Significant variations in either the enzymatic activities or mRNA levels of the cimA and leuA genes were detected in L. interrogans grown on minimal medium supplemented with different levels of the corresponding amino acids or in cells grown on serum-containing rich medium. The similarity of this metabolic pathway in leptospires and archaea is consistent with the evolutionarily primitive status of the eubacterial spirochetes."
15292194,Crystal structure of arachidonic acid bound to a mutant of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 that forms predominantly 11-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid.,10.1074/jbc.M403013200,"Kinetic studies and analysis of the products formed by native and mutant forms of ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 (oPGHS-1) have suggested that arachidonic acid (AA) can exist in the cyclooxygenase active site of the enzyme in three different, catalytically competent conformations that lead to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), 11R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE), and 15R,S-HPETE, respectively. We have identified an oPGHS-1 mutant (V349A/W387F) that forms predominantly 11R-HPETE. Thus, the preferred catalytically competent arrangement of AA in the cyclooxygenase site of this double mutant must be one that leads to 11-HPETE. The crystal structure of Co3+-protoporphyrin IX V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 in a complex with AA was determined to 3.1 A. Significant differences are observed in the positions of atoms C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-10, C-11, and C-12 of bound AA between native and V349A/W387F oPGHS-1; in comparison, the positions of the side chains of cyclooxygenase active site residues are unchanged. The structure of the double mutant presented here provides structural insight as to how Val349 and Trp387 help position C-9 and C-11 of AA so that the incipient 11-peroxyl radical intermediate is able to add to C-9 to form the 9,11 endoperoxide group of PGG2. In the V349A/W387F oPGHS-1.AA complex the locations of C-9 and C-11 of AA with respect to one another make it difficult to form the endoperoxide group from the 11-hydroperoxyl radical. Therefore, the reaction apparently aborts yielding 11R-HPETE instead of PGG2. In addition, the observed differences in the positions of carbon atoms of AA bound to this mutant provides indirect support for the concept that the conformer of AA shown previously to be bound within the cyclooxygenase active site of native oPGHS-1 is the one that leads to PGG2."
15294827,Molecular identification of the catabolic vinyl chloride reductase from Dehalococcoides sp. strain VS and its environmental distribution.,10.1128/AEM.70.8.4880-4888.2004,"Reductive dehalogenation of vinyl chloride (VC) to ethene is the key step in complete anaerobic degradation of chlorinated ethenes. VC-reductive dehalogenase was partially purified from a highly enriched culture of the VC-respiring Dehalococcoides sp. strain VS. The enzyme reduced VC and all dichloroethene (DCE) isomers, but not tetrachloroethene (PCE) or trichloroethene (TCE), at high rates. By using reversed genetics, the corresponding gene (vcrA) was isolated and characterized. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence, VC reductase is a novel member of the family of corrinoid/iron-sulfur cluster containing reductive dehalogenases. The vcrA gene was found to be cotranscribed with vcrB, encoding a small hydrophobic protein presumably acting as membrane anchor for VC reductase, and vcrC, encoding a protein with similarity to transcriptional regulators of the NosR/NirI family. The vcrAB genes were subsequently found to be present and expressed in other cultures containing VC-respiring Dehalococcoides organisms and could be detected in water samples from a field site contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. Therefore, the vcrA gene identified here may be a useful molecular target for evaluating, predicting, and monitoring in situ reductive VC dehalogenation."
15298336,Transcriptional networks controlling pancreatic development and beta cell function.,10.1007/s00125-004-1368-9,"Transcription factors provide the genetic instructions that drive pancreatic development and enable mature beta cells to function properly. To understand fully how this is accomplished, it is necessary to unravel the regulatory networks formed by transcription factors acting on their genomic targets. This article discusses recent advances in our understanding of how transcriptional networks control early pancreas organogenesis, embryonic endocrine cell formation and the differentiated function of adult beta cells. We discuss how mutations in several transcription factor genes involved in such networks cause Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Finally, we propose that pancreatic gene programs might be manipulated to generate beta cells or to enhance the function of existing beta cells, thereby providing a possible treatment of different forms of diabetes."
15299125,"Characterization of a root-specific Arabidopsis terpene synthase responsible for the formation of the volatile monoterpene 1,8-cineole.",10.1104/pp.104.044388,"Arabidopsis is emerging as a model system to study the biochemistry, biological functions, and evolution of plant terpene secondary metabolism. It was previously shown that the Arabidopsis genome contains over 30 genes potentially encoding terpene synthases (TPSs). Here we report the characterization of a monoterpene synthase encoded by two identical, closely linked genes, At3g25820 and At3g25830. Transcripts of these genes were detected almost exclusively in roots. An At3g25820/At3g25830 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein thus produced was shown to catalyze the formation of 10 volatile monoterpenes from geranyl diphosphate, with 1,8-cineole predominating. This protein was therefore designated AtTPS-Cin. The purified recombinant AtTPS-Cin displayed similar biochemical properties to other known monoterpene synthases, except for a relatively low K(m) value for geranyl diphosphate of 0.2 microm. At3g25820/At3g25830 promoter activity, measured with a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, was primarily found in the epidermis, cortex, and stele of mature primary and lateral roots, but not in the root meristem or the elongation zone. Although the products of AtTPS-Cin were not detected by direct extraction of plant tissue, the recent report of 1,8-cineole as an Arabidopsis root volatile (Steeghs M, Bais HP, de Gouw J, Goldan P, Kuster W, Northway M, Fall R, Vivanco JM [2004] Plant Physiol 135: 47-58) suggests that the enzyme products may be released into the rhizosphere rather than accumulated. Among Arabidopsis TPSs, AtTPS-Cin is most similar to the TPS encoded by At3g25810, a closely linked gene previously shown to be exclusively expressed in flowers. At3g25810 TPS catalyzes the formation of a set of monoterpenes that is very similar to those produced by AtTPS-Cin, but its major products are myrcene and (E)-beta-ocimene, and it does not form 1,8-cineole. These data demonstrate that divergence of organ expression pattern and product specificity are ongoing processes within the Arabidopsis TPS family."
15304505,Structural analysis of the sulfotransferase (3-o-sulfotransferase isoform 3) involved in the biosynthesis of an entry receptor for herpes simplex virus 1.,10.1074/jbc.M405013200,"Heparan sulfate (HS) plays essential roles in assisting herpes simplex virus infection and other biological processes. The biosynthesis of HS includes numerous specialized sulfotransferases that generate a variety of sulfated saccharide sequences, conferring the selectivity of biological functions of HS. We report a structural study of human HS 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform 3 (3-OST-3), a key sulfotransferase that transfers a sulfuryl group to a specific glucosamine in HS generating an entry receptor for herpes simplex virus 1. We have obtained the crystal structure of 3-OST-3 at 1.95 A in a ternary complex with 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate and a tetrasaccharide substrate. Mutational analyses were also performed on the residues involved in the binding of the substrate. Residues Gln255 and Lys368 are essential for the sulfotransferase activity and lie within hydrogen bonding distances to the carboxyl and sulfo groups of the uronic acid unit. These residues participate in the substrate recognition of 3-OST-3. This structure provides atomic level evidence for delineating the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism for 3-OST-3."
15314242,An aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that specifically activates pyrrolysine.,10.1073/pnas.0405362101,"Pyrrolysine, the 22nd cotranslationally inserted amino acid, was found in the Methanosarcina barkeri monomethylamine methyltransferase protein in a position that is encoded by an in-frame UAG stop codon in the mRNA. M. barkeri encodes a special amber suppressor tRNA (tRNA(Pyl)) that presumably recognizes this UAG codon. It was reported that Lys-tRNA(Pyl) can be formed by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-like M. barkeri protein PylS [Srinivasan, G., James, C. M. & Krzycki, J. A. (2002) Science 296, 1459-1462], whereas a later article showed that Lys-tRNA(Pyl) is synthesized by the combined action of LysRS1 and LysRS2, the two different M. barkeri lysyl-tRNA synthetases. Pyrrolysyl-tRNA(Pyl) formation was presumed to result from subsequent modification of lysine attached to tRNA(Pyl). To investigate whether pyrrolysine can be directly attached to tRNA(Pyl) we chemically synthesized pyrrolysine. We show that PylS is a specialized aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for charging pyrrolysine to tRNA(Pyl); lysine and tRNA(Lys) are not substrates of the enzyme. In view of the properties of PylS we propose to name this enzyme pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase. In contrast, the LysRS1:LysRS2 complex does not recognize pyrrolysine and charges tRNA(Pyl) with lysine. These in vitro data suggest that Methanosarcina cells have two pathways for acylating the suppressor tRNA(Pyl). This would ensure efficient translation of the in-frame UAG codon in case of pyrrolysine deficiency and safeguard the biosynthesis of the proteins whose genes contain this special codon."
15318166,Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli activates the RhoA signaling pathway via the stimulation of GEF-H1.,10.1038/sj.emboj.7600359,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli delivers a subset of effectors into host cells via a type III secretion system, and this step is required for the progression of disease. Here, we show that the type III effectors, EspG and its homolog Orf3, trigger actin stress fiber formation and the destruction of the microtubule networks beneath adherent bacteria. Both effectors were shown to possess the ability to interact with tubulins, and to stimulate microtubule destabilization in vitro. A recent study showed that microtubule-bound GEF-H1, a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, was converted to its active form by microtubule destabilization, and this sequence of events resulted in RhoA stimulation. Indeed, EspG- and Orf3-induced stress fiber formation was inhibited by the expression of dominant-negative forms of GEF-H1 and RhoA, but not of Rac1 and Cdc42, and by treatment with a ROCK inhibitor. These results indicate that the impact of EspG/Orf3 on microtubule networks triggers the activation of the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway via GEF-H1 activity. This report reveals for the first time that a pathogen can exploit the host factor GEF-H1."
15338053,Angiogenesis and signal transduction in endothelial cells.,10.1007/s00018-004-4070-7,"Endothelial cells receive multiple information from their environment that eventually leads them to progress along all the stages of the process of formation of new vessels. Angiogenic signals promote endothelial cell proliferation, increased resistance to apoptosis, changes in proteolytic balance, cytoskeletal reorganization, migration and, finally, differentiation and formation of a new vascular lumen. We aim to review herein the main signaling cascades that become activated in angiogenic endothelial cells as well as the opportunities of modulating angiogenesis through pharmacological interference with these signaling mechanisms. We will deal mainly with the mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway, which is very important in the transduction of proliferation signals; the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling system, particularly essential for the survival of the angiogenic endothelium; the small GTPases involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and migration; and the kinases associated to focal adhesions which contribute to integrate the pathways from the two main sources of angiogenic signals, i.e. growth factors and the extracellular matrix."
15340795,Sulfoacetate generated by Rhodopseudomonas palustris from taurine.,10.1007/s00203-004-0678-0,"Genes thought to encode (a) the regulator of taurine catabolism under carbon-limiting or nitrogen-limiting conditions and (b) taurine dehydrogenase were found in the genome of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The organism utilized taurine quantitatively as a sole source of nitrogen (but not of carbon) for aerobic and photoheterotrophic growth. No sulfate was released, and the C-sulfonate bond was recovered stoichiometrically as sulfoacetate, which was identified by mass spectrometry. An inducible sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase was detected. R. palustris thus contains a pathway to generate a natural product that was previously believed to be formed solely from sulfoquinovose."
15342621,N-glucosylation of cytokinins by glycosyltransferases of Arabidopsis thaliana.,10.1074/jbc.M409569200,"Cytokinins are plant hormones that can be glucosylated to form O-glucosides and N-glucosides. The glycoconjugates are inactive and are thought to play a role in homeostasis of the hormones. Although O-glucosyltransferases have been identified that recognize cytokinins, the enzymes involved in N-glucosylation have not been identified even though the process has been recognized for many years. This study utilizes a screening strategy in which 105 recombinant glycosyltransferases (UGTs) of Arabidopsis have been analyzed for catalytic activity toward the classical cytokinins: trans-zeatin, dihydrozeatin, N(6)-benzyladenine, N(6)-isopentenyladenine, and kinetin. Five UGTs were identified in the screen. UGT76C1 and UGT76C2 recognized all cytokinins and glucosylated the hormones at the N(7) and N(9) positions. UGT85A1, UGT73C5, and UGT73C1 recognized trans-zeatin and dihydrozeatin, which have an available hydroxyl group for glucosylation and formed the O-glucosides. The biochemical characteristics of the N-glucosyltransferases were analyzed, and highly effective inhibitors of their activities were identified. Constitutive overexpression of UGT76C1 in transgenic Arabidopsis confirmed that the recombinant enzyme functioned in vivo to glucosylate cytokinin applied to the plant. The role of the N-glucosyltransferases in cytokinin metabolism is discussed."
15346763,Nucleotide sequence of a portion of the camphor-degrading gene cluster from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784.,10.1080/10425170310001656765,"Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 is a camphor-degrading Gram-positive organism originally isolated from activated sewage sludge. A 5.4kbp portion of a proposed camphor degradation gene cluster from this organism was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. Four open reading frames (ORFs) were identified encoding proteins possibly involved in camphor metabolism; sequence alignment of the translation products suggested that the ORFs encode for a ferredoxin reductase, acyl-CoA ligase, epimerase and an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The last three activities are thought to be involved in the poorly understood late stage of camphor degradation. Our findings are entirely consistent with the proposed formation of a branched 9-carbon acid intermediate (3,4,4-trimethyl-5-oxo-trans-2-hexenoic acid) which has been isolated from the fermentation broth of camphor-grown cells."
15350605,Genomics view of gonadotrope signaling circuits.,10.1016/j.tem.2004.07.008,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) binds to the pituitary GnRH receptor to activate signal transduction cascades that ultimately modulate gonadotropin biosynthesis. Comprehensive studies of the GnRH-activated gene program in the LbetaT2 gonadotrope cell line have greatly increased our knowledge of the number of early and intermediate gene transcripts that are modulated by GnRH. Among the classes of gene induced are several whose protein products provide feedback to various levels of signaling pathways, suggesting that gene induction forms an integral component of signal transduction and contributes to longer-timescale feedback and feedforward loops. High-throughput quantitative genomic studies, mathematical modeling and biochemical studies are beginning to delineate the organization and function of the signal-decoding and logic circuit modules of the gonadotrope's signal transduction network."
15350618,Phantom encodes the 25-hydroxylase of Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori: a P450 enzyme critical in ecdysone biosynthesis.,10.1016/j.ibmb.2004.06.009,"We have reported recently the identification and characterization of the last three mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) controlling the biosynthesis of 20-hydroxyecdysone, the molting hormone of insects. These are encoded by the following genes: disembodied (dib, Cyp302a1, the 22-hydroxylase); shadow (sad, Cyp315a1, the 2-hydroxylase); and shade (shd, Cyp314a1, the 20-hydroxylase). Employing similar gene identification and transfection techniques and subsequent biochemical analysis of the expressed enzymatic activity, we report the identity of the Drosophila gene phantom (phm), located at 17D1 of the X chromosome, as encoding the microsomal 25-hydroxylase (Cyp306a1). Similar analysis following differential display-based gene identification has also resulted in the characterization of the corresponding 25-hydroxylase gene in Bombyx mori. Confirmation of 2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone (3beta,5beta-ketodiol) conversion to 2,22-dideoxyecdysone (3beta,5beta-ketotriol) mediated by either Phm enzyme employed LC, MS and definitive NMR analysis. In situ developmental gene analysis, in addition to northern, western and RT-PCR techniques during Drosophila embryonic, larval and adult development, are consistent with this identification. That is, strong expression of phm is restricted to the prothoracic gland cells of the Drosophila larval ring gland, where it undergoes dramatic changes in expression, and in the adult ovary, but also in the embryonic epidermis. During the last larval-larval transition in Bombyx, a similar expression pattern in the prothoracic gland is observed, but as in Drosophila, slight expression is also present in other tissues, suggesting a possible additional role for the phantom enzyme."
15353801,Reverse methanogenesis: testing the hypothesis with environmental genomics.,10.1126/science.1100025,"Microbial methane consumption in anoxic sediments significantly impacts the global environment by reducing the flux of greenhouse gases from ocean to atmosphere. Despite its significance, the biological mechanisms controlling anaerobic methane oxidation are not well characterized. One current model suggests that relatives of methane-producing Archaea developed the capacity to reverse methanogenesis and thereby to consume methane to produce cellular carbon and energy. We report here a test of the ""reverse-methanogenesis"" hypothesis by genomic analyses of methane-oxidizing Archaea from deep-sea sediments. Our results show that nearly all genes typically associated with methane production are present in one specific group of archaeal methanotrophs. These genome-based observations support previous hypotheses and provide an informed foundation for metabolic modeling of anaerobic methane oxidation."
15355237,The mevalonate pathway and the synthesis of juvenile hormone in insects.,10.1146/annurev.ento.50.071803.130356,"The mevalonate pathway in insects has two important peculiarities, the absence of the sterol branch and the synthesis of juvenile hormone (JH), that may have influenced the mechanisms of regulation. The data available on these mechanisms indicate that cholesterol does not play a regulatory role and that JH modulates transcript levels of a number of genes of the mevalonate pathway or can influence the translatability and/or stability of the transcripts themselves. These data suggest that the mevalonate pathway in insects can best be interpreted in terms of coordinated regulation, in which regulators act in parallel to a number of enzymes, as occurs in the cholesterol-driven pathway in vertebrates."
15358770,Desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyze the final step in the biosynthesis of the glucosinolate core structure.,10.1074/jbc.M407681200,"The phytotoxin coronatine is a structural analog of octadecanoid signaling molecules, which are well known mediators of plant defense reactions. To isolate novel coronatine-regulated genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, differential mRNA display was performed. Transcript levels of CORI-7 (coronatine induced-7) were rapidly and transiently increased in coronatine-treated plants, and the corresponding cDNA was found to encode the sulfotransferase AtST5a. Likewise, upon wounding, an immediate and transient increase in AtST5a mRNA levels could be observed in both locally wounded and unwounded (systemic) leaves. Furthermore, application of octadecanoids and ethylene as compounds involved in plant wound defense reactions resulted in AtST5a gene activation, whereas pathogen defense-related signals (yeast elicitor and salicylic acid) were inactive. AtST5a and its close homologs AtST5b and AtST5c were purified as His6-tagged proteins from Escherichia coli. The three enzymes were shown to catalyze the final step in the biosynthesis of the glucosinolate (GS) core structure, the sulfation of desulfoglucosinolates (dsGSs). They accept a broad range of dsGSs as substrates. However, in a competitive situation, AtST5a clearly prefers tryptophan- and phenylalanine-derived dsGSs, whereas long chain dsGSs derived from methionine are the preferred substrates of AtST5b and AtST5c. Treatment of Arabidopsis plants with low concentrations of coronatine resulted in an increase in the amounts of specific GSs, primarily glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin. Hence, it is suggested that AtST5a is the sulfotransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of tryptophan-derived GSs in vivo."
15372028,Anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation in deep subsurface oil reservoirs.,10.1038/nature02922,"Biodegradation of crude oil in subsurface petroleum reservoirs is an important alteration process with major economic consequences. Aerobic degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons at the surface is well documented and it has long been thought that the flow of oxygen- and nutrient-bearing meteoric waters into reservoirs was necessary for in-reservoir petroleum biodegradation. The occurrence of biodegraded oils in reservoirs where aerobic conditions are unlikely, together with the identification of several anaerobic microorganisms in oil fields and the discovery of anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation mechanisms, suggests that anaerobic degradation processes could also be responsible. The extent of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation processes in the world's deep petroleum reservoirs, however, remains strongly contested. Moreover, no organism has yet been isolated that has been shown to degrade hydrocarbons under the conditions found in deep petroleum reservoirs. Here we report the isolation of metabolites indicative of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation from a large fraction of 77 degraded oil samples from both marine and lacustrine sources from around the world, including the volumetrically important Canadian tar sands. Our results therefore suggest that anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation is a common process in biodegraded subsurface oil reservoirs."
15372473,"Acute graft-versus-host disease: pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management.",10.1002/cncr.20613,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has evolved as a central treatment modality in the management of different hematologic malignancies. Despite adequate posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation setting, even in patients who receive human leukemic antigen (HLA) identical sibling grafts. Up to 30% of the recipients of stem cells or bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical related donors and most patients who receive cells from other sources (matched-unrelated, non-HLA-identical siblings, cord blood) will develop > Grade 2 acute GVHD despite immunosuppressive prophylaxis. Thus, GVHD continues to be a major limitation to successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this review, the authors summarize the most current knowledge on the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of this potentially life-threatening transplantation complication."
15466199,Role of the human ST6GalNAc-I and ST6GalNAc-II in the synthesis of the cancer-associated sialyl-Tn antigen.,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1921,"The Sialyl-Tn antigen (Neu5Acalpha2-6GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) is highly expressed in several human carcinomas and is associated with carcinoma aggressiveness and poor prognosis. We characterized two human sialyltransferases, CMP-Neu5Ac:GalNAc-R alpha2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6GalNAc)-I and ST6GalNAc-II, that are candidate enzymes for Sialyl-Tn synthases. We expressed soluble recombinant hST6GalNAc-I and hST6GalNAc-II and characterized the substrate specificity of both enzymes toward a panel of glycopeptides, glycoproteins, and other synthetic glycoconjugates. The recombinant ST6GalNAc-I and ST6GalNAc-II showed similar substrate specificity toward glycoproteins and GalNAcalpha-O-Ser/Thr glycopeptides, such as glycopeptides derived from the MUC2 mucin and the HIVgp120. We also observed that the amino acid sequence of the acceptor glycopeptide contributes to the in vitro substrate specificity of both enzymes. We additionally established a gastric cell line, MKN45, stably transfected with the full length of either ST6GalNAc-I or ST6GalNAc-II and evaluated the carbohydrate antigens expression profile induced by each enzyme. MKN45 transfected with ST6GalNAc-I showed high expression of Sialyl-Tn, whereas MKN45 transfected with ST6GalNAc-II showed the biosynthesis of the Sialyl-6T structure [Galbeta1-3 (Neu5Acalpha2-6)GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr]. In conclusion, although both enzymes show similar in vitro activities when Tn antigen alone is available, whenever both Tn and T antigens are present, ST6GalNAc-I acts preferentially on Tn antigen, whereas the ST6GalNAc-II acts preferentially on T antigen. Our results show that ST6GalNAc-I is the major Sialyl-Tn synthase and strongly support the hypothesis that the expression of the Sialyl-Tn antigen in cancer cells is due to ST6GalNAc-I activity."
15470257,FKBP12 controls aspartate pathway flux in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to prevent toxic intermediate accumulation.,10.1128/EC.3.5.1287-1296.2004,"FKBP12 is a conserved member of the prolyl-isomerase enzyme family and serves as the intracellular receptor for FK506 that mediates immunosuppression in mammals and antimicrobial actions in fungi. To investigate the cellular functions of FKBP12 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we employed a high-throughput assay to identify mutations that are synthetically lethal with a mutation in the FPR1 gene, which encodes FKBP12. This screen identified a mutation in the HOM6 gene, which encodes homoserine dehydrogenase, the enzyme catalyzing the last step in conversion of aspartic acid into homoserine, the common precursor in threonine and methionine synthesis. Lethality of fpr1 hom6 double mutants was suppressed by null mutations in HOM3 or HOM2, encoding aspartokinase and aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, supporting the hypothesis that fpr1 hom6 double mutants are inviable because of toxic accumulation of aspartate beta-semialdehyde, the substrate of homoserine dehydrogenase. Our findings also indicate that mutation or inhibition of FKBP12 dysregulates the homoserine synthetic pathway by perturbing aspartokinase feedback inhibition by threonine. Because this pathway is conserved in fungi but not in mammals, our findings suggest a facile route to synergistic antifungal drug development via concomitant inhibition of FKBP12 and Hom6."
15500985,Enzymatic reactions in anaerobic 2-methylnaphthalene degradation by the sulphate-reducing enrichment culture N 47.,10.1016/j.femsle.2004.09.014,"The upper pathway of anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene was studied with a sulphate-reducing enrichment culture, which is able to grow with naphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene as sole carbon source and electron donor. Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene is initiated by an addition of fumarate to the methyl-group producing the first intermediate, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate. In a subsequent beta-oxidation of the original methyl atom, the central metabolite 2-naphthoic acid is generated. In the following pathway, the aromatic ring system is reduced, cleaved, and finally oxidised to CO(2). Here, we present two new enzymatic reactions of the 2-methylnaphthalene degradation pathway that were measured in crude cell extracts. All metabolites were identified with HPLC by co-elution with synthesised reference substances. The first enzyme, succinyl-CoA:naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate CoA-transferase, catalyses the activation of naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid to the corresponding CoA ester. The average specific activity of this enzyme was 19.6 nmol x min(-1) x mg of protein(-1). The CoA-transfer was not inhibited by sodium borohydride and only partially by hydroxylamine, indicating that this enzyme belongs to the family III of CoA-transferases like the corresponding enzyme in the anaerobic toluene degradation pathway. The product of this CoA-transfer reaction, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinyl-CoA is then oxidised in a reaction to naphthyl-2-methylene-succinyl-CoA by the enzyme naphthyl-2-methyl-succinyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The specific activity of this enzyme was 0.115 nmol x min(-1) x mg of protein(-1). The enzymatic activity could only be detected using phenazine methosulphate as electron acceptor. No activity was observed with natural electron acceptors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or flavin adenine dinucleotide. The two novel reactions presented here demonstrate that the original methyl-group of 2-methylnaphthalene is oxidised to the carboxyl group of 2-naphthoic acid in the upper part of the anaerobic degradation pathway."
15502343,Structure of the phenazine biosynthesis enzyme PhzG.,10.1107/S0907444904022474,"PhzG is a flavin-dependent oxidase that is believed to play a role in phenazine antibiotic synthesis in various bacteria, including Pseudomonas. Phenazines are chorismic acid derivatives that provide the producing organisms, including the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa, with a competitive growth advantage. Here, the crystal structures of PhzG from both P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens solved in an unliganded state at 1.9 and 1.8 A resolution, respectively, are described. Although the specific reaction in phenazine biosynthesis catalyzed by PhzG is unknown, the structural data indicates that PhzG is closely related to pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase, the Escherichia coli pdxH gene product, which catalyzes the final step in pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) biosynthesis. A previous proposal suggested that the physiological substrate of PhzG to be 2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (DHHA), a phenazine precursor produced by the sequential actions of the PhzE and PhzD enzymes on chorismate, and that two DHHA molecules dimerized in another enzyme-catalyzed reaction to yield phenazine-1-carboxylate. However, it was not possible to demonstrate any in vitro activity upon incubation of PhzG and DHHA. Interestingly, analysis of the in vitro activities of PhzG in combination with PhzF suggests that PhzF acts on DHHA and that PhzG then reacts with a non-aromatic tricyclic phenazine precusor to catalyze an oxidation/aromatization reaction that yields phenazine-1-carboxylate. It is proposed that phzG arose by duplication of pdxH and that the subtle differences seen between the structures of PhzG and PdxH correlate with the loss of the ability of PhzG to catalyze PLP formation. Sequence alignments and superimpositions of the active sites of PhzG and PdxH reveal that the residues that form a positively charged pocket around the phosphate of PLP in the PdxH-PLP complex are not conserved in PhzG, consistent with the inability of phosphorylated compounds to serve as substrates for PhzG."
15519698,Nuclear export of RNA.,10.1016/j.biolcel.2004.04.014,"A defining feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of a nuclear envelope separating transcription and DNA replication in the nucleus from the site of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression relies in part on the controlled exchange of molecules between these two compartments. Factors implicated in transcription regulation and DNA replication have to be imported into the nucleus, whereas RNAs produced in the nucleus have to be exported, either to fulfill their function in protein synthesis or to mature into functional particles. This review summarizes studies performed over the last 15 years that led to the identification of cellular factors mediating nuclear export of the different classes of RNAs, including tRNAs, UsnRNAs, micro-RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and mRNAs. We also discuss recent evidence indicating that the nuclear transport step is intimately linked to RNA synthesis, processing and mRNP assembly, thus ensuring that only properly matured ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes reach the cytoplasm."
15520012,Production of the neuromodulator H2S by cystathionine beta-synthase via the condensation of cysteine and homocysteine.,10.1074/jbc.C400481200,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been observed in relatively high concentrations in the mammalian brain and has been shown to act as a neuromodulator. However, there is confusion in the literature regarding the actual source of H2S production. Reactions catalyzed by the cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme (CBS) are one possible source for the production of H2S. Here we show that the CBS enzyme can efficiently produce H2S via a beta-replacement reaction in which cysteine is condensed with homocysteine to form cystathionine and H2S. The production of H2S by this reaction is at least 50 times more efficient than that produced by hydrolysis of cysteine alone via beta-elimination. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the Km and Kcat for cysteine is 3-fold higher and 2-fold lower, respectively, than that for serine. Consistent with these data, in vitro reconstitution studies show that at physiologically relevant concentrations of serine, homocysteine, and cysteine, about 5% of the cystathionine formed is from cysteine. We also show that AdoMet stimulates this H2S producing reaction but that there is no evidence for stimulation by calcium and calmodulin as reported previously. In summary, these results confirm the ability of CBS to produce H2S, but show in contrast to prior reports that the major mechanism is via beta-replacement and not cysteine hydrolysis. In addition, these studies provide a biochemical explanation for the previously inexplicable homocysteine-lowering effects of N-acetylcysteine treatments in humans."
15522832,Contribution of different pathways to the supply of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine to mitochondrial membranes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1016/j.bbalip.2004.09.007,"In the yeast, three biosynthetic pathways lead to the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn): (i) decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) in mitochondria; (ii) decarboxylation of PtdSer by Psd2p in a Golgi/vacuolar compartment; and (iii) the CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) branch of the Kennedy pathway. The major phospholipid of the yeast, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), is formed either by methylation of PtdEtn or via the CDP-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway. To study the contribution of these pathways to the supply of PtdEtn and PtdCho to mitochondrial membranes, labeling experiments in vivo with [(3)H]serine and [(14)C]ethanolamine, or with [(3)H]serine and [(14)C]choline, respectively, and subsequent cell fractionation were performed with psd1Delta and psd2Delta mutants. As shown by comparison of the labeling patterns of the different strains, the major source of cellular and mitochondrial PtdEtn is Psd1p. PtdEtn formed by Psd2p or the CDP-Etn pathway, however, can be imported into mitochondria, although with moderate efficiency. In contrast to mitochondria, microsomal PtdEtn is mainly derived from the CDP-Etn pathway. PtdEtn formed by Psd2p is the preferred substrate for PtdCho synthesis. PtdCho derived from the different pathways appears to be supplied to subcellular membranes from a single PtdCho pool. Thus, the different pathways of PtdEtn biosynthesis play different roles in the assembly of PtdEtn into cellular membranes."
15528644,Nitrate reduction and the nitrogen cycle in archaea.,10.1099/mic.0.27303-0,"The nitrogen cycle (N-cycle) in the biosphere, mainly driven by prokaryotes, involves different reductive or oxidative reactions used either for assimilatory purposes or in respiratory processes for energy conservation. As the N-cycle has important agricultural and environmental implications, bacterial nitrogen metabolism has become a major research topic in recent years. Archaea are able to perform different reductive pathways of the N-cycle, including both assimilatory processes, such as nitrate assimilation and N(2) fixation, and dissimilatory reactions, such as nitrate respiration and denitrification. However, nitrogen metabolism is much less known in archaea than in bacteria. The availability of the complete genome sequences of several members of the eury- and crenarchaeota has enabled new approaches to the understanding of archaeal physiology and biochemistry, including metabolic reactions involving nitrogen compounds. Comparative studies reveal that significant differences exist in the structure and regulation of some enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism in archaea, giving rise to important conclusions and new perspectives regarding the evolution, function and physiological relevance of the different N-cycle processes. This review discusses the advances that have been made in understanding nitrate reduction and other aspects of the inorganic nitrogen metabolism in archaea."
15528645,"The Serratia gene cluster encoding biosynthesis of the red antibiotic, prodigiosin, shows species- and strain-dependent genome context variation.",10.1099/mic.0.27222-0,"The prodigiosin biosynthesis gene cluster (pig cluster) from two strains of Serratia (S. marcescens ATCC 274 and Serratia sp. ATCC 39006) has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in heterologous hosts. Sequence analysis of the respective pig clusters revealed 14 ORFs in S. marcescens ATCC 274 and 15 ORFs in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006. In each Serratia species, predicted gene products showed similarity to polyketide synthases (PKSs), non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) and the Red proteins of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Comparisons between the two Serratia pig clusters and the red cluster from Str. coelicolor A3(2) revealed some important differences. A modified scheme for the biosynthesis of prodigiosin, based on the pathway recently suggested for the synthesis of undecylprodigiosin, is proposed. The distribution of the pig cluster within several Serratia sp. isolates is demonstrated and the presence of cryptic clusters in some strains shown. The pig cluster of Serratia marcescens ATCC 274 is flanked by cueR and copA homologues and this configuration is demonstrated in several S. marcescens strains, whilst these genes are contiguous in strains lacking the pig cluster."
15551059,"The genome sequence of an anaerobic aromatic-degrading denitrifying bacterium, strain EbN1.",10.1007/s00203-004-0742-9,"Recent research on microbial degradation of aromatic and other refractory compounds in anoxic waters and soils has revealed that nitrate-reducing bacteria belonging to the Betaproteobacteria contribute substantially to this process. Here we present the first complete genome of a metabolically versatile representative, strain EbN1, which metabolizes various aromatic compounds, including hydrocarbons. A circular chromosome (4.3 Mb) and two plasmids (0.21 and 0.22 Mb) encode 4603 predicted proteins. Ten anaerobic and four aerobic aromatic degradation pathways were recognized, with the encoding genes mostly forming clusters. The presence of paralogous gene clusters (e.g., for anaerobic phenylacetate oxidation), high sequence similarities to orthologs from other strains (e.g., for anaerobic phenol metabolism) and frequent mobile genetic elements (e.g., more than 200 genes for transposases) suggest high genome plasticity and extensive lateral gene transfer during metabolic evolution of strain EbN1. Metabolic versatility is also reflected by the presence of multiple respiratory complexes. A large number of regulators, including more than 30 two-component and several FNR-type regulators, indicate a finely tuned regulatory network able to respond to the fluctuating availability of organic substrates and electron acceptors in the environment. The absence of genes required for nitrogen fixation and specific interaction with plants separates strain EbN1 ecophysiologically from the closely related nitrogen-fixing plant symbionts of the Azoarcus cluster.

However, recent reports describe alternative pathways, revealing a more complex picture of L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis than had been expected. GDP-L-gulose and myo-inositol are proposed as new intermediates in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis, indicating that part of the animal pathway might also be operating in plants. Enzymatic studies on the GDP-mannose- 3',5'-epimerase and L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase suggest that they are important regulatory steps for L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis."

The bioactive compound PT has bactericidal, fungicidal, and herbicidal properties and possesses a C-P-C bond, which is very rare in natural compounds. Previously uncharacterized flanking and middle regions of the PTT biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü494 were isolated and sequenced. The boundaries of the gene cluster were identified by gene inactivation studies. Sequence analysis and homology searches led to the completion of the gene cluster, which consists of 24 genes. Four of these were identified as undescribed genes coding for proteins that are probably involved in uncharacterized early steps of antibiotic biosynthesis or in providing precursors of PTT biosynthesis (phosphoenolpyruvate, acetyl-coenzyme A, or L-alanine). The involvement of the genes orfM and trs and of the regulatory gene prpA in PTT biosynthesis was analyzed by gene inactivation and overexpression, respectively. Insight into the regulation of PTT was gained by determining the transcriptional start sites of the pmi and prpA genes. A previously undescribed regulatory gene involved in morphological differentiation in streptomycetes was identified outside of the left boundary of the PTT biosynthetic gene cluster."

Seven genes, the functions of whose products were not known, are involved in this novel pathway. Five of them encode enzymes that catabolize putrescine; one encodes a putrescine importer, and the other encodes a transcriptional regulator. This novel pathway involves six sequential steps as follows: 1) import of putrescine; 2) ATP-dependent gamma-glutamylation of putrescine; 3) oxidization of gamma-glutamylputrescine; 4) dehydrogenation of gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyraldehyde; 5) hydrolysis of the gamma-glutamyl linkage of gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate; and 6) transamination of gamma-aminobutyrate to form the final product of this pathway, succinate semialdehyde, which is the precursor of succinate."

A rich variety of pro- and antiangiogenic molecules have already been discovered. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an interesting inducer of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, because it is a highly specific mitogen for endothelial cells. Signal transduction involves binding to tyrosine kinase receptors and results in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and new vessel formation. In this article, the role of VEGF in physiological and pathological processes is reviewed. We also discuss how modulation of VEGF expression creates new therapeutic possibilities and describe recent developments in this field."
15604203,Minireview: transcriptional regulation in pancreatic development.,10.1210/en.2004-1576,"Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the sequential activation of signal transduction pathways and the expression of transcription factors during pancreas development. Much of this understanding has been obtained by analyses of the phenotypes of mice in which the expression of key genes has been disrupted (knockout mice). Knockout of the genes for Pdx1, Hlxb9, Isl1, or Hex results in an arrest of pancreas development at a very early stage (embryonic d 8-9). Disruption of genes encoding components of the Notch signaling pathway, e.g. Hes1 or neurogenin-3, abrogates development of the endocrine pancreas (islets of Langerhans). Disruption of transcription factor genes expressed more downstream in the developmental cascade (Beta2/NeuroD, Pax4, NKx2.2, and Nkx6.1) curtails the formation of insulin-producing beta-cells. An understanding of the importance of transcription factor genes during pancreas development has provided insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes, in which the mass of insulin-producing beta-cells is reduced."
15613448,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and its receptor in normal and malignant cells.,10.1677/erc.1.00777,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the hypothalamic factor that mediates reproductive competence. Intermittent GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus acts upon its receptor in the anterior pituitary to regulate the production and release of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. LH and FSH then stimulate sex steroid hormone synthesis and gametogenesis in the gonads to ensure reproductive competence. The pituitary requires pulsatile stimulation by GnRH to synthesize and release the gonadotropins LH and FSH. Clinically, native GnRH is used in a pump delivery system to create an episodic delivery pattern to restore hormonal defects in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Agonists of GnRH are delivered in a continuous mode to turn off reproductive function by inhibiting gonadotropin production, thus lowering sex steroid production, resulting in medical castration. They have been used in endocrine disorders such as precocious puberty, endometriosis and leiomyomata, but are also studied extensively in hormone-dependent malignancies. The detection of GnRH and its receptor in other tissues, including the breast, ovary, endometrium, placenta and prostate suggested that GnRH agonists and antagonists may also have direct actions at peripheral targets. This paper reviews the current data concerning differential control of GnRH and GnRH receptor expression and signaling in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and extrapituitary tissues. Using these data as a backdrop, we then review the literature about the action of GnRH in cancer cells, the utility of GnRH analogs in various malignancies and then update the research in novel therapies targeted to the GnRH receptor in cancer cells to promote anti-proliferative effects and control of tumor burden."
15614489,Biosynthesis of hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1007/s00294-004-0557-x,"Two redundant genes, THI20 and THI21, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode a 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine monophosphate (HMP-P) kinase required for thiamin biosynthesis. Using functional complementation analysis with an Escherichia coli mutant strain and a defined biochemical system containing partially purified proteins for the reconstitution of thiamin monophosphate synthesis, we demonstrate that both Thi20p and Thi21p proteins also have HMP kinase activity. Although each isoform independently can synthesize HMP pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) from HMP, there is a marked difference in efficiency between the two proteins. The thi20 deletion strain grows at the same rate as the parental strain in minimal medium without thiamin, but its ability to synthesize HMP-PP from HMP is significantly decreased. We discuss the possibility that HMP is not involved in the pathway of de novo thiamin synthesis in S. cerevisiae."

Eight positives were identified, one of which was able to confer PTT biosynthetic capability upon Streptomyces lividans after integration of the fosmid into the chromosome of this heterologous host. Sequence analysis of the 40,241-bp fosmid insert revealed 29 complete open reading frames (ORFs). Deletion analysis demonstrated that a minimum set of 24 ORFs were required for PTT production in the heterologous host. Sequence analysis revealed that most of these PTT genes have been previously identified in either S. viridochromogenes or S. hygroscopicus (or both), although only 11 out of 24 of these ORFs have experimentally defined functions. Three previously unknown genes within the cluster were identified and are likely to have roles in the stepwise production of phosphonoformate from phosphonoacetaldehyde. This is the first report detailing the entire PTT gene cluster from any producing streptomycete."

Strategies to enhance immune function could improve the outcome for a considerable number of patients. Although myeloid growth factors have found widespread use in clinical medicine, a 'lymphoid growth factor' has not yet been established in clinical use. Several recent studies have proposed two candidate immunostimulatory cytokines: interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15. In this Review, we discuss recent findings regarding the effects of IL-7 and IL-15 on lymphopoiesis and their potential use for the treatment of immunodeficiency."
15629723,The structure of the human adenovirus 2 penton.,10.1016/j.molcel.2004.11.041,"The adenovirus penton, a noncovalent complex of the pentameric penton base and trimeric fiber proteins, comprises the vertices of the adenovirus capsid and contains all necessary components for viral attachment and internalization. The 3.3 A resolution crystal structure of human adenovirus 2 (hAd2) penton base shows that the monomer has a basal jellyroll domain and a distal irregular domain formed by two long insertions, a similar topology to the adenovirus hexon. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, required for interactions with cellular integrins, occurs on a flexible surface loop. The complex of penton base with bound N-terminal fiber peptide, determined at 3.5 A resolution, shows that the universal fiber motif FNPVYPY binds at the interface of adjacent penton base monomers and results in a localized structural rearrangement in the insertion domain of the penton base. These results give insight into the structure and assembly of the adenovirus capsid and will be of use for gene-therapy applications."

In this study, we present the structure of the E. coli O145 O antigen and the sequence of its gene cluster. The O145 antigen has repeat units containing three monosaccharide residues: 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose (GlcNAc), 2-acetamidoylamino-2,6-dideoxy-L-galactose, and N-acetylneuraminic acid. It is very closely related to Salmonella enterica serovar Touera and S. enterica subsp. arizonae O21 antigen. The E. coli O145 gene cluster is located between the JUMPStart sequence and the gnd gene and consists of 15 open reading frames. Putative genes for the synthesis of the O-antigen constituents, for sugar transferase, and for O-antigen processing were annotated based on sequence similarities and the presence of conserved regions. The putative genes located in the E. coli O145 O-antigen gene cluster accounted for all functions expected for synthesis of the structure. An E. coli O145 serogroup-specific PCR assay based on the genes wzx and wzy was also developed by screening E. coli and Shigella isolates of different serotypes."

Frequent repeated blood sampling can limit the kinds of studies conducted on this rhythm, particularly in small laboratory rodents that have limited blood volumes and are easily stressed by handling. We developed an extraction and assay protocol to measure fecal corticosterone metabolites in repeated samples collected from undisturbed male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats. This fecal measure provides a non-invasive method to assess changes in corticosterone within a single animal over time, with sufficient temporal acuity to quantify several characteristics of the circadian rhythm: e.g. the nadir, acrophase, and asymmetry (saw-tooth) of the rhythm. Males excreted more immunoreactive fecal corticoids than did females. Across the estrous cycle, females produced more fecal corticoids on proestrus (the day of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge) than during estrus or metestrus. These results establish a baseline from which to study environmental, psychological, and physiological disturbances of the circadian corticosterone rhythm within individual rats."
15652868,Postsynaptic signaling networks: cellular cogwheels underlying long-term plasticity.,10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.02.031,"Learning depends on positive or negative changes in synaptic transmission that are synapse-specific and sustained. Synaptic signals can be directly measured and respond to certain kinds of stimulation by becoming persistently enhanced (long-term potentiation, LTP) or decreased (long-term depression, LTD). Studying LTP and LTD opens a window on to the molecular mechanisms of memory. Although changes in both pre- and postsynaptic strength have been implicated in LTP and LTD, most attention has been focused on changes in postsynaptic glutamate receptor density. This is controlled by intracellular Ca(2+) ions via a network of signaling molecules. Changes in postsynaptic Ca(2+) concentration depend on the coincidence of appropriate synaptic signals, as is found in learning situations. The long-term persistence of LTP and LTD requires gene transcription and translation. It is posited that local translation at the synapse, in a self-sustaining manner, mediates the persistence of long-term changes despite constant turnover of the synaptic components."
15658985,Proposed involvement of a soluble methane monooxygenase homologue in the cyclohexane-dependent growth of a new Brachymonas species.,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2004.00681.x,"High-throughput mRNA differential display (DD) was used to identify genes induced by cyclohexane in Brachymonas petroleovorans CHX, a recently isolated beta-proteobacterium that grows on cyclohexane. Two metabolic gene clusters were identified multiple times in independent reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) in the course of this DD experiment. These clusters encode genes believed to be required for cyclohexane metabolism. One gene cluster (8 kb) encodes the subunits of a multicomponent hydroxylase related to the soluble butane of Pseudomonas butanovora and methane monooxygenases (sMMO) of methanotrophs. We propose that this butane monooxygenase homologue carries out the oxidation of cyclohexane into cyclohexanol during growth. A second gene cluster (11 kb) contains almost all the genes required for the oxidation of cyclohexanol to adipic acid. Real-time PCR experiments confirmed that genes from both clusters are induced by cyclohexane. The role of the Baeyer-Villiger cyclohexanone monooxygenase of the second cluster was confirmed by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli."
15661024,Severe combined immunodeficiency. A model disease for molecular immunology and therapy.,10.1111/j.0105-2896.2005.00223.x,"Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs) consist of genetically determined arrest of T-cell differentiation. Ten different molecular defects have now been identified, which all lead to early death in the absence of therapy. Transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) can restore T-cell development, thus saving the lives of SCID patients. In this review, the different characteristics of HSCT are discussed along with the available data regarding the long-term outcome. Transient thymopoiesis caused by an exhaustion of donor progenitor cells and possibly a progressive loss of thymus function can lead to a progressive decline in T-cell functions. The preliminary results of gene therapy show the correction of two SCID conditions. Based on the assumption that long-lasting pluripotent progenitor cells are transduced, these data suggest that gene therapy could overcome the long-term recurrence of the T-cell immunodeficiency. SCID is thus a disease model for experimental therapy in the hematopoietic system."
15670154,Hidden stereospecificity in the biosynthesis of divinyl ether fatty acids.,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2004.04510.x,"Incubations of [8(R)-2H]9(S)-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid, [14(R)-2H]13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid and [14(S)-2H]13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid were performed with preparations of plant tissues containing divinyl ether synthases. In agreement with previous studies, generation of colneleic acid from the 8(R)-deuterated 9(S)-hydroperoxide was accompanied by loss of most of the deuterium label (retention, 8%), however, the opposite result (98% retention) was observed in the generation of 8(Z)-colneleic acid from the same hydroperoxide. Formation of etheroleic acid and 11(Z)-etheroleic acid from the 14(R)-deuterated 13(S)-hydroperoxide was accompanied by loss of most of the deuterium (retention, 7-8%), and, as expected, biosynthesis of these divinyl ethers from the corresponding 14(S)-deuterated hydroperoxide was accompanied by retention of deuterium (retention, 94-98%). Biosynthesis of omega5(Z)-etheroleic acid from the 14(R)- and 14(S)-deuterated 13(S)-hydroperoxides showed the opposite results, i.e. 98% retention and 4% retention, respectively. The experiments demonstrated that biosynthesis of divinyl ether fatty acids from linoleic acid 9- and 13-hydroperoxides takes place by a mechanism that involves stereospecific abstraction of one of the two hydrogen atoms alpha to the hydroperoxide carbon. Furthermore, a consistent relationship between the absolute configuration of the hydrogen atom eliminated (R or S) and the configuration of the introduced vinyl ether double bond (E or Z) emerged from these results. Thus, irrespective of which hydroperoxide regioisomer served as the substrate, divinyl ether synthases abstracting the pro-R hydrogen generated divinyl ethers having an E vinyl ether double bond, whereas enzymes abstracting the pro-S hydrogen produced divinyl ethers having a Z vinyl ether double bond."
15687214,"Substrate-dependent regulation of anaerobic degradation pathways for toluene and ethylbenzene in a denitrifying bacterium, strain EbN1.",10.1128/JB.187.4.1493-1503.2005,"Anaerobic biodegradation of toluene and ethylbenzene is of environmental concern and biochemical interest due to toxicity and novel reactions, respectively. The denitrifying strain EbN1 is unique in anaerobically degrading both alkylbenzenes via different pathways which converge at benzoyl coenzyme A. The organization of genes involved in both pathways was only recently determined for strain EbN1. In the present study, global expression analysis (DNA microarray and proteomics) indicated involvement of several thus-far-unknown proteins in the degradation of both alkylbenzenes. For example, orf68 and orf57, framing the ebd operon, are implicated in ethylbenzene degradation, and the ebA1932 and ebA1936 genes, located 7.2 kb upstream of the bbs operon, are implicated in toluene degradation. In addition, expression studies were now possible on the level of the complete pathways. Growth experiments demonstrated that degradative capacities for toluene and ethylbenzene could be simultaneously induced, regardless of the substrate used for adaptation. Regulation was studied at the RNA (real-time reverse transcription-PCR and DNA microarray) and protein (two-dimensional-difference gel electrophoresis) level by using cells adapted to anaerobic growth with benzoate, toluene, ethylbenzene, or a mixture of toluene and ethylbenzene. Expression of the two toluene-related operons (bss and bbs) was specifically induced in toluene-adapted cells. In contrast, genes involved in anaerobic ethylbenzene degradation were induced in ethylbenzene- and toluene-adapted cells, suggesting that toluene may act as a gratuitous inducer. In agreement with the predicted sequential regulation of the ethylbenzene pathway, Ebd proteins (encoding subunits of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase) were formed in ethylbenzene- but not in acetophenone-adapted cells, while Apc proteins (subunits of predicted acetophenone carboxylase) were formed under both conditions."

The gastric bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori uses a set of secreted and translocated proteins--including outer membrane adhesins, secreted extracellular enzymes and translocated effector proteins--to adapt to its extraordinary habitat, the gastric mucosa. Two major virulence factors of H. pylori are the vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and the cag type-IV secretion system and its translocated effector protein, cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA). VacA targets not only epithelial cells, but also cells of the immune system and induces immunosuppression. CagA has been shown to interact with a growing set of eucaryotic signaling molecules in phosphorylation-dependent and -independent ways."

S., Babbitt, P. C., Gerlt, J. A., and Rayment, I. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 3861-3869], a group of homologous enzymes that share the (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel fold. KGPDC catalyzes a Mg(2+)-dependent decarboxylation reaction in the catabolic pathway of l-ascorbate utilization by Escherichia coli K-12 [Yew, W. S., and Gerlt, J. A. (2002) J.Bacteriol. 184, 302-306]; HPS catalyzes a Mg(2+)-dependent aldol condensation between formaldehyde and d-ribulose 5-phosphate in formaldehyde-fixing methylotrophic bacteria [Kato, N., Ohashi, H., Hori, T., Tani, Y., and Ogata, K. (1977) Agric. Biol. Chem. 41, 1133-1140]. Our previous studies of the KGPDC from E. coli established the occurrence of a stabilized cis-enediolate intermediate [Yew, W. S., Wise, E., Rayment, I., and Gerlt, J. A. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 6427-6437; Wise, E., Yew, W. S., Gerlt, J. A., and Rayment, I. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 6438-6446]. Although the mechanism of the HPS-catalyzed reaction has not yet been investigated, it also is expected to involve a Mg(2+)-stabilized cis-enediolate intermediate. We now have discovered that the KGPDC from E. coli and the HPS from Methylomonas aminofaciens are both naturally promiscuous for the reaction catalyzed by the homologue. On the basis of the alignment of the sequences of orthologous KGPDC's and HPS's, four conserved active site residues in the KGPDC from E. coli were mutated to those conserved in HPS's (E112D/R139V/T169A/R192A): the value of the k(cat) for the promiscuous HPS activity was increased as much as 170-fold (for the E112D/R139V/T169A/R192A mutant), and the value of k(cat)/K(m) was increased as much as 260-fold (for the E112D/R139V/T169A mutant); in both cases, the values of the kinetic constants for the natural KGPDC activity were decreased. Together with the structures of mutants reported in the accompanying manuscript [Wise, E. L., Yew, W. S., Akana, J., Gerlt, J. A., and Rayment, I., accompanying manuscript], these studies illustrate that large changes in catalytic efficiency can be accomplished with only modest changes in active site structure. Thus, the (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel fold shared by members of the OMPDC suprafamily appears well-suited for the evolution of new functions."
15699328,Cryo-electron tomography of vaccinia virus.,10.1073/pnas.0409825102,"The combination of cryo-microscopy and electron tomographic reconstruction has allowed us to determine the structure of one of the more complex viruses, intracellular mature vaccinia virus, at a resolution of 4-6 nm. The tomographic reconstruction allows us to dissect the different structural components of the viral particle, avoiding projection artifacts derived from previous microscopic observations. A surface-rendering representation revealed brick-shaped viral particles with slightly rounded edges and dimensions of approximately 360 x 270 x 250 nm. The outer layer was consistent with a lipid membrane (5-6 nm thick), below which usually two lateral bodies were found, built up by a heterogeneous material without apparent ordering or repetitive features. The internal core presented an inner cavity with electron dense coils of presumptive DNA-protein complexes, together with areas of very low density. The core was surrounded by two layers comprising an overall thickness of approximately 18-19 nm; the inner layer was consistent with a lipid membrane. The outer layer was discontinuous, formed by a periodic palisade built by the side interaction of T-shaped protein spikes that were anchored in the lower membrane and were arranged into small hexagonal crystallites. It was possible to detect a few pore-like structures that communicated the inner side of the core with the region outside the layer built by the T-shaped spike palisade."
15705958,"A novel cytochrome P450 is implicated in brassinosteroid biosynthesis via the characterization of a rice dwarf mutant, dwarf11, with reduced seed length.",10.1105/tpc.104.024950,"We have characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf11 (d11), that bears seeds of reduced length. To understand the mechanism by which seed length is regulated, the D11 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning method. The gene was found to encode a novel cytochrome P450 (CYP724B1), which showed homology to enzymes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. The dwarf phenotype of d11 mutants was restored by the application of the brassinolide (BL). Compared with wild-type plants, the aberrant D11 mRNA accumulated at higher levels in d11 mutants and was dramatically reduced by treatment with BL, implying that the gene is feedback-regulated by BL. Precise determination of the defective step(s) in BR synthesis in d11 mutants proved intractable because of tissue specificity and the complex control of BR accumulation in plants. However, 6-deoxotyphasterol (6-DeoxoTY) and typhasterol (TY), but not any upstream intermediates before these compounds, effectively restored BR response in d11 mutants in a lamina joint bending assay. Multiple lines of evidence together suggest that the D11/CYP724B1 gene plays a role in BR synthesis and may be involved in the supply of 6-DeoxoTY and TY in the BR biosynthesis network in rice."
15710611,"The last reaction producing brassinolide is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450s, CYP85A3 in tomato and CYP85A2 in Arabidopsis.",10.1074/jbc.M414592200,"Brassinosteroids are steroidal hormones essential for the growth and development of plants. Brassinolide, the most biologically active brassinosteroid, has a seven-membered lactone ring that is formed by a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of its immediate precursor castasterone. Despite its potential key role in controlling plant development, brassinolide synthase has not been identified. Previous work has shown that the formation of castasterone from 6-deoxocastasterone is catalyzed by members of the CYP85A family of cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases. A null mutation in the tomato Dwarf (CYP85A1) gene, extreme dwarf (d(x)), causes severe dwarfism due to brassinosteroid deficiency, but the d(x) mutant still produces fruits. Here, we show that d(x) fruits contain brassinolide at a higher level than wild-type fruits and that a new CYP85A gene, CYP85A3, is preferentially expressed in tomato fruits. Tomato CYP85A3 catalyzed the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to produce brassinolide from castasterone in yeast, in addition to the conversion of 6-deoxocastasterone to castasterone. We also show that Arabidopsis CYP85A2, which was initially characterized as castasterone synthase, also has brassinolide synthase activity. Exogenous application of castasterone and brassinolide to the Arabidopsis cyp85a1/cyp85a2 double mutant suggests that castasterone can function as an active brassinosteroid but that its conversion into brassinolide is necessary for normal vegetative development in Arabidopsis. We postulate that castasterone is the major active brassinosteroid during vegetative growth in tomato, whereas brassinolide may play an organ-specific role in fruit development in this species."
15728344,"Monoterpene metabolism. Cloning, expression, and characterization of menthone reductases from peppermint.",10.1104/pp.104.053306,"(-)-Menthone is the predominant monoterpene produced in the essential oil of maturing peppermint (Mentha x piperita) leaves during the filling of epidermal oil glands. This early biosynthetic process is followed by a second, later oil maturation program (approximately coincident with flower initiation) in which the C3-carbonyl of menthone is reduced to yield (-)-(3R)-menthol and (+)-(3S)-neomenthol by two distinct NADPH-dependent ketoreductases. An activity-based in situ screen, by expression in Escherichia coli of 23 putative redox enzymes from an immature peppermint oil gland expressed sequence tag library, was used to isolate a cDNA encoding the latter menthone:(+)-(3S)-neomenthol reductase. Reverse transcription-PCR amplification and RACE were used to acquire the former menthone:(-)-(3R)-menthol reductase directly from mRNA isolated from the oil gland secretory cells of mature leaves. The deduced amino acid sequences of these two reductases share 73% identity, provide no apparent subcellular targeting information, and predict inclusion in the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family of enzymes. The menthone:(+)-(3S)-neomenthol reductase cDNA encodes a 35,722-D protein, and the recombinant enzyme yields 94% (+)-(3S)-neomenthol and 6% (-)-(3R)-menthol from (-)-menthone as substrate, and 86% (+)-(3S)-isomenthol and 14% (+)-(3R)-neoisomenthol from (+)-isomenthone as substrate, has a pH optimum of 9.3, and K(m) values of 674 mum, > 1 mm, and 10 mum for menthone, isomenthone, and NADPH, respectively, with a k(cat) of 0.06 s(-1). The recombinant menthone:(-)-(3R)-menthol reductase has a deduced size of 34,070 D and converts (-)-menthone to 95% (-)-(3R)-menthol and 5% (+)-(3S)-neomenthol, and (+)-isomenthone to 87% (+)-(3R)-neoisomenthol and 13% (+)-(3S)-isomenthol, displays optimum activity at neutral pH, and has K(m) values of 3.0 mum, 41 mum, and 0.12 mum for menthone, isomenthone, and NADPH, respectively, with a k(cat) of 0.6 s(-1). The respective activities of these menthone reductases account for all of the menthol isomers found in the essential oil of peppermint. Biotechnological exploitation of these genes could lead to improved production yields of (-)-menthol, the principal and characteristic flavor component of peppermint."

This review describes the modes of action of the major T-lineage-defining transcription factors and the signal pathways that activate them during intrathymic differentiation from pluripotent precursors. Roles of Notch and its effector RBPSuh (CSL), GATA-3, E2A/HEB and Id proteins, c-Myb, TCF-1, and members of the Runx, Ets, and Ikaros families are critical. Less known transcription factors that are newly recognized as being required for T cell development at particular checkpoints are also described. The transcriptional regulation of T cell development is contrasted with that of B cell development, in terms of their different degrees of overlap with the stem-cell program and the different roles of key transcription factors in gene regulatory networks leading to lineage commitment."
15788404,Biochemical and molecular characterization of a novel choline-specific glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase belonging to the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family.,10.1074/jbc.M413438200,"Nucleotide pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases (NPPs) are ubiquitous membrane-associated or secreted ectoenzymes that release nucleoside 5'-monophosphate from a variety of nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives. The mammalian NPP family comprises seven members, but only three of these (NPP1-3) have been studied in some detail. Previously we showed that lysophospholipase D, which hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to produce lysophosphatidic acid, is identical to NPP2. More recently an uncharacterized novel NPP member (NPP7) was shown to have alkaline sphingomyelinase activity. These findings raised the possibility that other members of the NPP family act on phospholipids. Here we show that the sixth member of the NPP family, NPP6, is a choline-specific glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase. The sequence of NPP6 encodes a transmembrane protein containing an NPP domain with significant homology to NPP4, NPP5, and NPP7/alkaline sphingomyelinase. When expressed in HeLa cells, NPP6 was detected in both the cells and the cell culture medium as judged by Western blotting and by enzymatic activity. Recombinant NPP6 efficiently hydrolyzed the classical substrate for phospholipase C, p-nitrophenyl phosphorylcholine, but not the classical nucleotide phosphodiesterase substrate, p-nitrophenyl thymidine 5'-monophosphate. In addition, NPP6 hydrolyzed LPC to form monoacylglycerol and phosphorylcholine but not lysophosphatidic acid, showing it has a lysophospholipase C activity. NPP6 showed a preference for LPC with short (12:0 and 14:0) or polyunsaturated (18:2 and 20:4) fatty acids. It also hydrolyzed glycerophosphorylcholine and sphingosylphosphorylcholine efficiently. In mice, NPP6 mRNA was predominantly detected in kidney with a lesser expression in brain and heart, and in human it was detected in kidney and brain. The present results suggest that NPP6 has a specific role through the hydrolysis of polyunsaturated LPC, glycerophosphorylcholine, or sphingosylphosphorylcholine in these organs."
15803158,The role of calmodulin as a signal integrator for synaptic plasticity.,10.1038/nrn1647,"Excitatory synapses in the brain show several forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are initiated by increases in intracellular Ca(2+) that are generated through NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors or voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels. LTP depends on the coordinated regulation of an ensemble of enzymes, including Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, adenylyl cyclase 1 and 8, and calcineurin, all of which are stimulated by calmodulin, a Ca(2+)-binding protein. In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that calmodulin is a central integrator of synaptic plasticity and that its unique regulatory properties allow the integration of several forms of signal transduction that are required for LTP and LTD."
15805475,Betaxanthins as substrates for tyrosinase. An approach to the role of tyrosinase in the biosynthetic pathway of betalains.,10.1104/pp.104.057992,"Tyrosinase or polyphenol oxidase (EC 1.14.18.1) is the key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis and in the enzymatic browning of fruits and vegetables. The role of tyrosinase in the secondary metabolism of plants still remains unclear, but its implication in betalain biosynthesis has been proposed. Betalains are an important class of water-soluble pigments, characteristic of plants belonging to the order Caryophyllales. In this article, the betaxanthins, tyrosine-betaxanthin (portulacaxanthin II) and dopaxanthin, are reported to be physiological substrates for tyrosinase. The direct activity of tyrosinase on selected betaxanthins is characterized in depth, and conversion of tyrosine-betaxanthin to dopaxanthin and its further oxidation to a series of compounds are described. Identity of the reaction products was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Masses determined for the reaction products were the same in all cases, 389 m/z ([M + H]+) and equal to that determined for betanidin. Data indicate that dopaxanthin-quinone is obtained and evolves to more stable species by intramolecular cyclization. Kinetic parameters for tyrosinase acting on dopaxanthin were evaluated, showing a high affinity for this substrate (K(m) = 84.3 microM). The biosynthetic scheme of betalains is reviewed and a branch is proposed based on the description of physiological substrates for tyrosinase. Lampranthus productus, Glottiphylum oligocarpum, and Glottiphylum pigmaeum are described as sources of stereopure (2S/S)-dopaxanthin."

Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the metabolome and transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana over-expressing the PAP1 gene encoding an MYB transcription factor, for the identification of novel gene functions involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. For metabolome analysis, we performed flavonoid-targeted analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and non-targeted analysis by Fourier-transform ion-cyclotron mass spectrometry with an ultrahigh-resolution capacity. This combined analysis revealed the specific accumulation of cyanidin and quercetin derivatives, and identified eight novel anthocyanins from an array of putative 1800 metabolites in PAP1 over-expressing plants. The transcriptome analysis of 22,810 genes on a DNA microarray revealed the induction of 38 genes by ectopic PAP1 over-expression. In addition to well-known genes involved in anthocyanin production, several genes with unidentified functions or annotated with putative functions, encoding putative glycosyltransferase, acyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase, sugar transporters and transcription factors, were induced by PAP1. Two putative glycosyltransferase genes (At5g17050 and At4g14090) induced by PAP1 expression were confirmed to encode flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase and anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase, respectively, from the enzymatic activity of their recombinant proteins in vitro and results of the analysis of anthocyanins in the respective T-DNA-inserted mutants. The functional genomics approach through the integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics presented here provides an innovative means of identifying novel gene functions involved in plant metabolism."
15838028,Evidence for autotrophic CO2 fixation via the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle by members of the epsilon subdivision of proteobacteria.,10.1128/JB.187.9.3020-3027.2005,"Based on 16S rRNA gene surveys, bacteria of the epsilon subdivision of proteobacteria have been identified to be important members of microbial communities in a variety of environments, and quite a few have been demonstrated to grow autotrophically. However, no information exists on what pathway of autotrophic carbon fixation these bacteria might use. In this study, Thiomicrospira denitrificans and Candidatus Arcobacter sulfidicus, two chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers of the epsilon subdivision of proteobacteria, were examined for activities of the key enzymes of the known autotrophic CO(2) fixation pathways. Both organisms contained activities of the key enzymes of the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP citrate lyase, 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Furthermore, no activities of key enzymes of other CO(2) fixation pathways, such as the Calvin cycle, the reductive acetyl coenzyme A pathway, and the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, could be detected. In addition to the key enzymes, the activities of the other enzymes involved in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle could be measured. Sections of the genes encoding the alpha- and beta-subunits of ATP citrate lyase could be amplified from both organisms. These findings represent the first direct evidence for the operation of the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle for autotrophic CO(2) fixation in epsilon-proteobacteria. Since epsilon-proteobacteria closely related to these two organisms are important in many habitats, such as hydrothermal vents, oxic-sulfidic interfaces, or oilfields, these results suggest that autotrophic CO(2) fixation via the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle might be more important than previously considered."

15857686,Postsynaptic IP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ release modulates synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons.,10.1016/j.molbrainres.2004.12.018,"Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms are important in regulating synaptic transmission. The results herein indicate that whole-cell perfusion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) agonists greatly enhanced excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes in postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 neurons. IP(3)R agonist-mediated increases in synaptic transmission changed during development and paralleled age-dependent increases in hippocampal type-1 IP(3)Rs. IP(3)R agonist-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes were inhibited by postsynaptic perfusion of inhibitors of Ca(2+)/calmodulin, PKC and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Postsynaptic perfusion of inhibitors of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) Ca(2+)-ATPases, which deplete intracellular Ca(2+) stores, also enhanced EPSC amplitudes. Postsynaptic perfusion of the IP(3)R agonist adenophostin (AdA) during subthreshold stimulation appeared to convert silent to active synapses; synaptic transmission at these active synapses was completely blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Postsynaptic IP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) release also produced a significant increase in spontaneous EPSC frequency. These results indicate that Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores play a key role in regulating the function of postsynaptic AMPARs."
15865156,Biodegradation of monochloroacetic acid used as a sole carbon and energy source by Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 strain in batch and continuous culture.,10.1007/s10532-004-3614-8,"Batch and continuous mode degradation of monochloroacetic acid used as a sole carbon and energy source in the concentration range of 0.9-48.4 mM by pure culture of Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 was investigated. The substrate was completely degraded in each flask in batch system. Partial substrate inhibition occurred at the concentrations exceeding 25.4 mM. Temporary accumulation of glycolic acid in the medium indicated that dehalogenation was undergoing faster than further utilization of glycolate. Three different carbon substrates were used for inoculum preparation--1,2-dichloroethane, tri-sodium citrate and a nutrient broth. The fastest growth on monochloroacetate occurred for 1,2-dichloroethane-grown inoculum. The assays of haloacid dehalogenase in crude extract indicated that the bacteria grown on 1,2-dichloroethane possessed higher level of the enzyme. The response of the GJ10 culture towards spikes of 20 mM monochloroacetate was tested in 2.5-1 continuously stirred tank fermentor. The substrate was readily utilized within 7-8 h. Continuous degradation of monochloroacetate in the fermentor was demonstrated for monochloroacetate concentration of 20 mM and dilution rate 0.016 h(-1). Quantitative agreement between the amount of monochloroacetate introduced and chloride released was found. The results demonstrated that the strain X. autotrophicus GJ10 might be suitable for biodegradation of monochloroacetate contaminated media."

During growth, a compound is excreted, which has now been identified as isethionate (2-hydroxyethanesulfonate). An ion-chromatographic separation of isethionate was developed to quantify the putative isethionate, whose identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted, laser-desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Strain TauN1 utilised taurine (and excreted isethionate) concomitantly with growth. Cell-free extracts contained inducible taurine transaminase, which yielded sulfoacetaldehyde. A soluble, NADP-dependent isethionate dehydrogenase converted sulfoacetaldehyde to isethionate. The enzyme was partially purified and it apparently belonged to the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases."
15889095,Prime role for an insulin epitope in the development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice.,10.1038/nature03523,"A fundamental question about the pathogenesis of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes is whether there are primary autoantigens. For type 1 diabetes it is clear that multiple islet molecules are the target of autoimmunity in man and animal models. It is not clear whether any of the target molecules are essential for the destruction of islet beta cells. Here we show that the proinsulin/insulin molecules have a sequence that is a primary target of the autoimmunity that causes diabetes of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. We created insulin 1 and insulin 2 gene knockouts combined with a mutated proinsulin transgene (in which residue 16 on the B chain was changed to alanine) in NOD mice. This mutation abrogated the T-cell stimulation of a series of the major insulin autoreactive NOD T-cell clones. Female mice with only the altered insulin did not develop insulin autoantibodies, insulitis or autoimmune diabetes, in contrast with mice containing at least one copy of the native insulin gene. We suggest that proinsulin is a primary autoantigen of the NOD mouse, and speculate that organ-restricted autoimmune disorders with marked major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of disease are likely to have specific primary autoantigens."
15889096,Expanded T cells from pancreatic lymph nodes of type 1 diabetic subjects recognize an insulin epitope.,10.1038/nature03625,"In autoimmune type 1 diabetes, pathogenic T lymphocytes are associated with the specific destruction of insulin-producing beta-islet cells. Identification of the autoantigens involved in triggering this process is a central question. Here we examined T cells from pancreatic draining lymph nodes, the site of islet-cell-specific self-antigen presentation. We cloned single T cells in a non-biased manner from pancreatic draining lymph nodes of subjects with type 1 diabetes and from non-diabetic controls. A high degree of T-cell clonal expansion was observed in pancreatic lymph nodes from long-term diabetic patients but not from control subjects. The oligoclonally expanded T cells from diabetic subjects with DR4, a susceptibility allele for type 1 diabetes, recognized the insulin A 1-15 epitope restricted by DR4. These results identify insulin-reactive, clonally expanded T cells from the site of autoinflammatory drainage in long-term type 1 diabetics, indicating that insulin may indeed be the target antigen causing autoimmune diabetes."
15894272,Phagocytosis: elegant complexity.,10.1016/j.immuni.2005.05.002,"Phagocytosis requires receptor-mediated recognition of particles, usually in the guise of infectious agents and apoptotic cells. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes to generate phagolysosomes, which play a key role in enzymatic digestion of the internalized contents into component parts. Recent findings indicate that a simple paradigm of a single cognate receptor interaction that guides the phagosome to phagolysosome formation belies the complexity of combinatorial receptor recognition and diversity of phagosome function. In fact, phagosomes are comprised of hundreds of proteins that play a key role in deciphering the contents of the phagosome and in defining host response. In this review we discuss how the challenge of recognizing diverse molecular patterns is met by combinatorial interactions between phagocytic receptors. Furthermore, these combinations are dynamic and both sculpt the balance between a proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory response and direct phagosome diversity. We also indicate an important role for genetically tractable model organisms in defining key components of this evolutionarily conserved process."

However, a fundamental difference between these organisms is that most yeast genes lack introns whereas the converse is true in higher organisms. Recent studies of the TREX complex, which functions in mRNA export, unexpectedly revealed that this complex is recruited by the transcription machinery in yeast whereas the TREX complex appears to be recruited by the splicing machinery in mammals. Studies during the past year also revealed a possible conserved role for SR protein dephosphorylation in regulating the interaction between SR proteins and the mRNA export receptor TAP (Mex67 in yeast). There is also an interesting possibility that an SR protein-TREX complex interaction is a conserved part of the mRNA export machinery."
15901685,The archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii possesses a bifunctional enzyme for formaldehyde fixation via the ribulose monophosphate pathway.,10.1128/JB.187.11.3636-3642.2005,"Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3, a hyperthermophilic and anaerobic archaeon, was found to have an open reading frame (PH1938) whose deduced amino acid sequence of the N-terminal and C-terminal halves showed significant similarity to two key enzymes of the ribulose monophosphate pathway for formaldehyde fixation in methylotrophic bacteria, 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (PHI), respectively. The organism constitutively produced the encoded protein and exhibited activity of the sequential HPS- and PHI-mediated reactions in a particulate fraction. The full-length gene encoding the hybrid enzyme, the sequence corresponding to the HPS region, and the sequence corresponding to the PHI region were expressed in Escherichia coli and were found to produce active enzymes, rHps-Phi, rHps, or rPhi, respectively. Purified rHps-Phi and rHps were found to be active at the growth temperatures of the parent strain, but purified rPhi exhibited significant susceptibility to heat, suggesting that thermostability of the PHI moiety of the bifunctional enzyme (rHps-Phi) resulted from fusion with HPS. The bifunctional enzyme catalyzed the sequential reaction much more efficiently than a mixture of rHps and rPhi. These and other biochemical characterizations of the PH1938 gene product suggest that the ribulose monophosphate pathway plays a significant role in the archaeon under extreme environmental conditions."
15913672,Geographic and evolutionary diversification of glucosinolates among near relatives of Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae).,10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.04.016,"Glucosinolates are biologically active secondary metabolites that display both intra- and interspecific variation in the order Brassicales. Glucosinolate profiles have not been interpreted within a phylogenic framework and little is known regarding the processes that influence the evolution of glucosinolate diversity at a macroevolutionary scale. We have analyzed leaf glucosinolate profiles from members of the Brassicaceae that have diverged from Arabidopsis thaliana within the last 15 million years and interpreted our findings relative to the phylogeny of this group. We identified several interspecific polymorphisms in glucosinolate composition. A majority of these polymorphisms are lineage-specific secondary losses of glucosinolate characters, but a gain-of-character polymorphism was also detected. The genetic basis of most observed polymorphisms appears to be regulatory. In the case of A. lyrata, geographic distribution is also shown to contribute to glucosinolate metabolic diversity. Further, we observed evidence of gene-flow between sympatric species, parallel evolution, and the existence of genetic constraints on the evolution of glucosinolates within the Brassicaceae."
15932995,Aspergillus parasiticus cyclase catalyzes two dehydration steps in aflatoxin biosynthesis.,10.1128/AEM.71.6.2999-3006.2005,"In the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway, 5'-oxoaverantin (OAVN) cyclase, the cytosolic enzyme, catalyzes the reaction from OAVN to (2'S,5'S)-averufin (AVR) (E. Sakuno, K. Yabe, and H. Nakajima, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 69:6418-6426, 2003). Interestingly, the N-terminal 25-amino-acid sequence of OAVN cyclase completely matched an internal sequence of the versiconal (VHOH) cyclase that was deduced from its gene (vbs). The purified OAVN cyclase also catalyzed the reaction from VHOH to versicolorin B (VB). In a competition experiment using the cytosol fraction of Aspergillus parasiticus, a high concentration of VHOH inhibited the enzyme reaction from OAVN to AVR, and instead VB was newly formed. The recombinant Vbs protein, which was expressed in Pichia pastoris, showed OAVN cyclase activity, as well as VHOH cyclase activity. A mutant of A. parasiticus SYS-4 (= NRRL 2999) with vbs deleted accumulated large amounts of OAVN, 5'-hydroxyaverantin, averantin, AVR, and averufanin in the mycelium. These results indicated that the cyclase encoded by the vbs gene is also involved in the reaction from OAVN to AVR in aflatoxin biosynthesis. Small amounts of VHOH, VB, and aflatoxins also accumulated in the same mutant, and this accumulation may have been due to an unknown enzyme(s) not involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis. This is the first report of one enzyme catalyzing two different reactions in a pathway of secondary metabolism."
15944456,Cell wall integrity signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1128/MMBR.69.2.262-291.2005,"The yeast cell wall is a highly dynamic structure that is responsible for protecting the cell from rapid changes in external osmotic potential. The wall is also critical for cell expansion during growth and morphogenesis. This review discusses recent advances in understanding the various signal transduction pathways that allow cells to monitor the state of the cell wall and respond to environmental challenges to this structure. The cell wall integrity signaling pathway controlled by the small G-protein Rho1 is principally responsible for orchestrating changes to the cell wall periodically through the cell cycle and in response to various forms of cell wall stress. This signaling pathway acts through direct control of wall biosynthetic enzymes, transcriptional regulation of cell wall-related genes, and polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, additional signaling pathways interface both with the cell wall integrity signaling pathway and with the actin cytoskeleton to coordinate polarized secretion with cell wall expansion. These include Ca(2+) signaling, phosphatidylinositide signaling at the plasma membrane, sphingoid base signaling through the Pkh1 and -2 protein kinases, Tor kinase signaling, and pathways controlled by the Rho3, Rho4, and Cdc42 G-proteins."
15955302,Connexin phosphorylation as a regulatory event linked to gap junction internalization and degradation.,10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.09.009,"Gap junction proteins, connexins, are dynamic polytopic membrane proteins that exhibit unprecedented short half-lives of only a few hours. Consequently, it is well accepted that in addition to channel gating, gap junctional intercellular communication is regulated by connexin biosynthesis, transport and assembly as well as the formation and removal of gap junctions from the cell surface. At least nine members of the 20-member connexin family are known to be phosphorylated en route or during their assembly into gap junctions. For some connexins, notably Cx43, evidence exists that phosphorylation may trigger its internalization and degradation. In recent years it has become apparent that the mechanisms underlying the regulation of connexin turnover are quite complex with the identification of many connexin binding molecules, a multiplicity of protein kinases that phosphorylate connexins and the involvement of both lysosomal and proteasomal pathways in degrading connexins. This paper will review the evidence that connexin phosphorylation regulates, stimulates or triggers gap junction disassembly, internalization and degradation."
15955818,Structure of plant photosystem I revealed by theoretical modeling.,10.1074/jbc.M500937200,"Photosystem (PS) I is a large membrane protein complex vital for oxygenic photosynthesis, one of the most important biological processes on the planet. We present an ""atomic"" model of higher plant PSI, based on theoretical modeling using the recent 4.4 angstroms x-ray crystal structure of PSI from pea. Because of the lack of information on the amino acid side chains in the x-ray structural model and the high cofactor content in this system, novel modeling techniques were developed. Our model reveals some important structural features of plant PSI that were not visible in the crystal structure, and our model sheds light on the evolutionary relationship between plant and cyanobacterial PSI."
15971106,A marvel of mucosal T cells and secretory antibodies for the creation of first lines of defense.,10.1007/s00018-005-5035-1,"The mucosal immune system acts as a first line of defense against bacterial and viral infections while also playing a crucial role in the establishment and maintenance of mucosal homeostasis between the host and the outside environment. In addition to epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages), B and T lymphocytes form a dynamic mucosal network for the induction and regulation of secretory IgA (S-IgA) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. This review seeks to shed light on the pathways of induction and regulation of these responses and to elucidate the role they simultaneously play in fending off pathogen invasion and maintaining mucosal homeostasis."
15982836,The pituitary effects of GnRH.,10.1016/j.anireprosci.2005.05.010,"Advances in our understanding of the complexity of GnRH actions at the pituitary and the various mechanisms involved in mediating differential LH and FSH biosynthesis and secretion at the gonadotrope, are continually emerging. In this review, we summarise recent studies pertaining to GnRH and GnRH receptor phylogeny, the divergent signalling and trafficking pathways initiated and utilised by GnRH and its receptor, and the pathways that mediate gonadotropin secretion from the gonadotrope."
15987739,Role of the endocytic machinery in the sorting of lysosome-associated membrane proteins.,10.1091/mbc.e05-03-0213,"The limiting membrane of the lysosome contains a group of transmembrane glycoproteins named lysosome-associated membrane proteins (Lamps). These proteins are targeted to lysosomes by virtue of tyrosine-based sorting signals in their cytosolic tails. Four adaptor protein (AP) complexes, AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4, interact with such signals and are therefore candidates for mediating sorting of the Lamps to lysosomes. However, the role of these complexes and of the coat protein, clathrin, in sorting of the Lamps in vivo has either not been addressed or remains controversial. We have used RNA interference to show that AP-2 and clathrin-and to a lesser extent the other AP complexes-are required for efficient delivery of the Lamps to lysosomes. Because AP-2 is exclusively associated with plasma membrane clathrin coats, our observations imply that a significant population of Lamps traffic via the plasma membrane en route to lysosomes."
15987956,ALG9 mannosyltransferase is involved in two different steps of lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis.,10.1093/glycob/cwj002,"N-linked protein glycosylation follows a conserved pathway in eukaryotic cells. The assembly of the lipid-linked core oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, the substrate for the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), is catalyzed by different glycosyltransferases located at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The substrate specificity of the different glycosyltransferase guarantees the ordered assembly of the branched oligosaccharide and ensures that only completely assembled oligosaccharide is transferred to protein. The glycosyltransferases involved in this pathway are highly specific, catalyzing the addition of one single hexose unit to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO). Here, we show that the dolichylphosphomannose-dependent ALG9 mannosyltransferase is the exception from this rule and is required for the addition of two different alpha-1,2-linked mannose residues to the LLO. This report completes the list of lumen-oriented glycosyltransferases required for the assembly of the LLO."
15994896,Comparison of the light-harvesting networks of plant and cyanobacterial photosystem I.,10.1529/biophysj.105.066464,"With the availability of structural models for photosystem I (PSI) in cyanobacteria and plants it is possible to compare the excitation transfer networks in this ubiquitous photosystem from two domains of life separated by over one billion years of divergent evolution, thus providing an insight into the physical constraints that shape the networks' evolution. Structure-based modeling methods are used to examine the excitation transfer kinetics of the plant PSI-LHCI supercomplex. For this purpose an effective Hamiltonian is constructed that combines an existing cyanobacterial model for structurally conserved chlorophylls with spectral information for chlorophylls in the Lhca subunits. The plant PSI excitation migration network thus characterized is compared to its cyanobacterial counterpart investigated earlier. In agreement with observations, an average excitation transfer lifetime of approximately 49 ps is computed for the plant PSI-LHCI supercomplex with a corresponding quantum yield of 95%. The sensitivity of the results to chlorophyll site energy assignments is discussed. Lhca subunits are efficiently coupled to the PSI core via gap chlorophylls. In contrast to the chlorophylls in the vicinity of the reaction center, previously shown to optimize the quantum yield of the excitation transfer process, the orientational ordering of peripheral chlorophylls does not show such optimality. The finding suggests that after close packing of chlorophylls was achieved, constraints other than efficiency of the overall excitation transfer process precluded further evolution of pigment ordering."
16000717,Utilization of geraniol is dependent on molybdenum in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: evidence for different metabolic routes for oxidation of geraniol and citronellol.,10.1099/mic.0.27957-0,"Mini-Tn5-induced mutants with defects in utilization of linear terpenes such as citronellol, geraniol, citronellate and/or geranylate were isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One mutant was unable to utilize geraniol but showed wild-type growth with the three other acyclic terpenes tested. The Tn5 insertion site of the mutant was determined by DNA sequencing. Comparison with the P. aeruginosa genome sequence revealed that PA3028, an ORF with high similarity on the amino acid level to molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A2 (encoded by moeA2), was the target of mini-Tn5 in the mutant. Disruption of moeA2 in P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type by insertion mutagenesis resulted in the same geraniol-minus phenotype. The ability to utilize geraniol was restored to the mutant by conjugative transfer of PCR-cloned wild-type moeA2 on a broad-host-range plasmid. Growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on geraniol and geranial, but not on citronellol, citronellate or geranylate, was inhibited by the presence of 10 mM tungstate, a molybdenum-specific inhibitor. Inhibition by tungstate was prevented by addition of molybdate. The results indicate that at least one step in the oxidation of geraniol to geranic acid (geranial oxidation) is a molybdenum-dependent reaction in P. aeruginosa and is different from the molybdenum-independent oxidation of citronellol to citronellate."
16024727,"Loss of the mtr operon in Methanosarcina blocks growth on methanol, but not methanogenesis, and reveals an unknown methanogenic pathway.",10.1073/pnas.0502623102,"In the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri Fusaro, the N5-methyl-tetrahydrosarcinapterin (CH3-H4SPT):coenzyme M (CoM) methyltransferase, encoded by the mtr operon, catalyzes the energy-conserving (sodium-pumping) methyl transfer from CH3-H4SPT to CoM during growth on H2/CO2 or acetate. However, in the disproportionation of C-1 compounds, such as methanol, to methane and carbon dioxide, it catalyzes the reverse, endergonic transfer from methyl-CoM to H4SPT, which is driven by sodium uptake. It has been proposed that a bypass for this energy-consuming reaction may occur via a direct methyl transfer from methanol to H4SPT. To test this, an mtr deletion mutant was constructed and characterized in M. barkeri Fusaro. The mutant is unable to grow on methanol, acetate or H2/CO2, but can grow on methanol with H2/CO2 and, surprisingly, methanol with acetate. 13C labeling experiments show that growth on acetate with methanol involves a previously unknown methanogenic pathway, in which oxidation of acetate to a mixture of CO2 and formic acid is coupled to methanol reduction. Interestingly, although the mutant is unable to grow on methanol alone, it remains capable of producing methane from this substrate. Thus, the proposed Mtr bypass does exist, but is unable to support growth of the organism."
16042598,Structures and reaction mechanisms of riboflavin synthases of eubacterial and archaeal origin.,10.1042/BST0330780,"The biosynthesis of one riboflavin molecule requires one molecule of GTP and two molecules of ribulose 5-phosphate as substrates. GTP is hydrolytically opened, converted into 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione by a sequence of deamination, side chain reduction and dephosphorylation. Condensation with 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate obtained from ribulose 5-phosphate leads to 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. The dismutation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine catalysed by riboflavin synthase produces riboflavin and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione. A pentacyclic adduct of two 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazines has been identified earlier as a catalytically competent reaction intermediate of the Escherichia coli enzyme. Acid quenching of reaction mixtures of riboflavin synthase of Methanococcus jannaschii, devoid of similarity to riboflavin synthases of eubacteria and eukaryotes, afforded a compound whose optical absorption and NMR spectra resemble that of the pentacyclic E. coli riboflavin synthase intermediate, whereas the CD spectra of the two compounds have similar envelopes but opposite signs. Each of the compounds could serve as a catalytically competent intermediate for the enzyme by which it was produced, but not vice versa. All available data indicate that the respective pentacyclic intermediates of the M. jannaschii and E. coli enzymes are diastereomers. Whereas the riboflavin synthase of M. jannaschii is devoid of similarity with those of eubacteria and eukaryotes, it has significant sequence similarity with 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthases catalysing the penultimate step of riboflavin biosynthesis. 6,7-Dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase and the archaeal riboflavin synthase appear to have diverged early in the evolution of Archaea from a common ancestor."
16061950,A phylogenetic survey of biliary lipids in vertebrates.,10.1194/jlr.M500178-JLR200,"Biliary lipids (bile salts, phospholipids, cholesterol, plant sterols) were determined in 89 vertebrate species (cartilaginous and bony fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals), and individual phospholipid classes were measured in 35 species. All samples contained conjugated bile salts (C(27) bile alcohol sulfates and/or N-acyl amidates of C(27) and/or C(24) bile acids). Phospholipids were generally absent in the bile of cartilaginous fish and reptiles and were present in low amounts relative to bile salts in bony fish and most birds. In mammals, the phospholipid-bile salt ratio varied widely. The bile from species with low biliary phospholipid-bile salt ratios often contained a high proportion of sphingomyelin, confirmed by HPLC-MS. In species with a high phospholipid-bile salt ratio, the predominant biliary phospholipid was phosphatidylcholine (PC). The phospholipid-bile salt ratio correlated weakly with the calculated weighted hydrophobic index value. Cholesterol was present in the bile of virtually all species, with plant sterols uniformly being present in only trace amounts. The cholesterol-bile salt ratio tended to be higher in mammals than in non-mammals, but bile of all species was unsaturated. Thus, most nonmammalian vertebrates have relatively low levels of biliary phospholipid and cholesterol, suggesting that cholesterol is eliminated predominantly as bile salts. Mammals have a higher phospholipid and cholesterol to bile salt ratio, with the dominant phospholipid being PC."
16085834,"Allophanate hydrolase, not urease, functions in bacterial cyanuric acid metabolism.",10.1128/AEM.71.8.4437-4445.2005,"Growth substrates containing an s-triazine ring are typically metabolized by bacteria to liberate 3 mol of ammonia via the intermediate cyanuric acid. Over a 25-year period, a number of original research papers and reviews have stated that cyanuric acid is metabolized in two steps to the 2-nitrogen intermediate urea. In the present study, allophanate, not urea, was shown to be the 2-nitrogen intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism in all the bacteria examined. Six different experimental results supported this conclusion: (i) synthetic allophanate was shown to readily decarboxylate to form urea under acidic extraction and chromatography conditions used in previous studies; (ii) alkaline extraction methods were used to stabilize and detect allophanate in bacteria actively metabolizing cyanuric acid; (iii) the kinetic course of allophanate formation and disappearance was consistent with its being an intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism, and no urea was observed in those experiments; (iv) protein extracts from cells grown on cyanuric acid contained allophanate hydrolase activity; (v) genes encoding the enzymes AtzE and AtzF, which produce and hydrolyze allophanate, respectively, were found in several cyanuric acid-metabolizing bacteria; and (vi) TrzF, an AtzF homolog found in Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and shown to have allophanate hydrolase activity. In addition, we have observed that there are a large number of genes homologous to atzF and trzF distributed in phylogenetically distinct bacteria. In total, the data indicate that s-triazine metabolism in a broad class of bacteria proceeds through allophanate via allophanate hydrolase, rather than through urea using urease."
16095998,Molecular mechanisms in gliomagenesis.,10.1016/S0065-230X(05)94001-3,"Glioma, and in particular high-grade astrocytoma termed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common primary tumor of the brain. Primarily because of its diffuse nature, there is no effective treatment for GBM, and relatively little is known about the processes by which it develops. Therefore, in order to design novel therapies and treatments for GBM, research has recently intensified to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to GBM formation. Modeling of astrocytomas by genetic manipulation of mice suggests that deregulation of the pathways that control gliogenesis during normal brain development, such as the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into astrocytes, might contribute to GBM formation. These pathways include growth factor-induced signal transduction routes and processes that control cell cycle progression, such as the p16-CDK4-RB and the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathways. The expression of several of the components of these signaling cascades has been found altered in GBM, and recent data indicate that combinations of mutations in these pathways may contribute to GBM formation, although the exact mechanisms are still to be uncovered. Use of novel techniques including large-scale genomics and proteomics in combination with relevant mouse models will most likely provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma formation and will hopefully lead to development of treatment modalities for GBM."
16098971,Excitation energy trapping in photosystem I complexes depleted in Lhca1 and Lhca4.,10.1016/j.febslet.2005.06.091,"We report a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy characterization of photosystem I (PSI) particles prepared from Arabidopsis lines with knock-out mutations against the peripheral antenna proteins of Lhca1 or Lhca4. The first mutant retains Lhca2 and Lhca3 while the second retains one other light-harvesting protein of photosystem I (Lhca) protein, probably Lhca5. The results indicate that Lhca2/3 and Lhca1/4 each provides about equally effective energy transfer routes to the PSI core complex, and that Lhca5 provides a less effective energy transfer route. We suggest that the specific location of each Lhca protein within the PSI-LHCI supercomplex is more important than the presence of so-called red chlorophylls in the Lhca proteins."
16099108,Characterization of the structure of antithrombin-binding heparan sulfate generated by heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 5.,10.1016/j.bbagen.2005.06.012,"The 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine is a key modification step during the biosynthesis of anticoagulant heparan sulfate (HS). Both heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase -1 (3-OST-1) and 3-O-sulfotransferase-5 (3-OST-5) transfer sulfate to the 3-OH group of glucosamine to generate antithrombin-binding heparan sulfate (HS(act)). Here, we reported the isolation and characterization of the antithrombin-binding HS oligosaccharides generated by 3-OST-5 (3-OST-5 oligo(act)). (3)H-labeled HS of Chinese hamster ovary cells was exhaustively modified by 3-OST-1 to remove the 3-OST-1 modification sites followed by antithrombin-affinity fractionation. The non-antithrombin-binding fraction of 3-OST-1 pretreated HS was further modified by 3-OST-5 to generate additional antithrombin-binding HS, which was designated as 3-OST-5 HS(act). Structural analysis of 3-OST-5 HS(act) revealed that the antithrombin-binding site of 3-OST-5 HS(act) is located within a domain clustered with N-sulfated glucosamine units. We also isolated 3-OST-5 antithrombin-binding oligosaccharides (3-OST-5 oligo(act)) from high pH nitrous acid degraded 3-OST-5 HS(act). A disaccharide analysis revealed that 3-OST-5 oligo(act) were composed of multiple 3-O-sulfated glucosamine units. Our results provide additional insights on the relationship between the anticoagulant activity and structure of HS."
16101641,Genetics of right ventricular cardiomyopathy.,10.1111/j.1540-8167.2005.40842.x,"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. However, variants of ARVC that preferentially affect the left ventricle are increasingly recognized. ARVC is distinguished from dilated cardiomyopathy by a propensity toward ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in the absence of significant ventricular dysfunction. In the majority of families, ARVC shows autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Recessive forms are also described, often in association with cutaneous disorders. Causative mutations have so far been identified in plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and plakophilin, all of which encode key components of the desmosome. Desmosomes are protein complexes that anchor intermediate filaments to the cytoplasmic membrane in adjoining cells, thereby forming a three-dimensional scaffolding that provides tissues with mechanical strength. Unraveling of the genetic etiology of ARVC has elicited a new model for pathogenesis. Impaired functioning of cell adhesion junctions during exposure to shear stress may lead to myocyte detachment and death, accompanied by inflammation and fibrofatty repair. At least three mechanisms contribute to the arrhythmic substrate: bouts of myocarditis, fibrous and adipose infiltrates that facilitate macroreentry, and gap junction remodeling secondary to altered mechanical coupling. The latter may underlie arrhythmogenicity in early disease. Although ARVC can be considered a disease of the desmosome, a variety of other genetic defects give rise to phenocopies, which may ultimately enhance our understanding of the broad phenotypic spectrum."
1610174,"Biodegradation of the herbicide bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) by purified pentachlorophenol hydroxylase and whole cells of Flavobacterium sp. strain ATCC 39723 is accompanied by cyanogenesis.",10.1128/aem.58.2.502-506.1992,"A pentachlorophenol (PCP)-degrading Flavobacterium sp. (strain ATCC 39723) degraded bromoxynil with the production of bromide and cyanide. No aromatic intermediates were detected in the spent culture fluid. The cyanide produced upon bromoxynil metabolism was inhibitory to the Flavobacterium sp. Whole cells degraded PCP more rapidly than they did bromoxynil. Bromoxynil metabolism and PCP metabolism were coinduced, either substrate serving as the inducer. Purified PCP hydroxylase degraded bromoxynil with stoichiometric accumulation of cyanide and without bromide production. A product accumulated which was more hydrophilic than bromoxynil upon high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis and which, when analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, had a mass spectrum consistent with that expected for dibromohydroquinone. PCP hydroxylase consumed NADPH, oxygen, and bromoxynil in a 2:1:1 molar ratio, producing 1 mol of cyanide per mol of bromoxynil degraded. We propose a pathway by which bromoxynil is metabolized by the same enzymes which degrade PCP. The initial step in the pathway is the conversion of bromoxynil to 2,6-dibromohydroquinone by PCP hydroxylase. In addition to its utility for decontaminating PCP-polluted sites, the Flavobacterium sp. may be useful for decontaminating bromoxynil spills. This is the first report of cyanide production accompanying the metabolism of a benzonitrile derivative."
16104843,The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor system and its role under physiological and pathological conditions.,10.1042/CS20040370,"The VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family and its receptors are essential regulators of angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Currently, the VEGF family consists of VEGF-A, PlGF (placenta growth factor), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E and snake venom VEGF. VEGF-A has at least nine subtypes due to the alternative splicing of a single gene. Although the VEGF165 isoform plays a central role in vascular development, recent studies have demonstrated that each VEGF isoform plays distinct roles in vascular patterning and arterial development. VEGF-A binds to and activates two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR (VEGF receptor)-1 and VEGFR-2. VEGFR-2 mediates most of the endothelial growth and survival signals, but VEGFR-1-mediated signalling plays important roles in pathological conditions such as cancer, ischaemia and inflammation. In solid tumours, VEGF-A and its receptor are involved in carcinogenesis, invasion and distant metastasis as well as tumour angiogenesis. VEGF-A also has a neuroprotective effect on hypoxic motor neurons, and is a modifier of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Recent progress in the molecular and biological understanding of the VEGF/VEGFR system provides us with novel and promising therapeutic strategies and target proteins for overcoming a variety of diseases."
16116284,Identification and functional analyses of two cDNAs that encode fatty acid 9-/13-hydroperoxide lyase (CYP74C) in rice.,10.1271/bbb.69.1545,"Fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), a member of cytochrome P450 (CYP74), produces aldehydes and oxo-acids involved in plant defensive reactions. In monocots, HPL that cleaves 13-hydroperoxides of fatty acids has been reported, but HPL that cleaves 9-hydroperoxides is still unknown. To find this type of HPL, in silico screening of candidate cDNA clones and subsequent functional analyses of recombinant proteins were performed. We found that AK105964 and AK107161 (Genbank accession numbers), cDNAs previously annotated as allene oxide synthase (AOS) in rice, are distinctively grouped from AOS and 13-HPL. Recombinant proteins of these cDNAs produced in Escherichia. coli cleaved both 9- and 13-hydroperoxide of linoleic and linolenic into aldehydes, while having only a trace level of AOS activity and no divinyl ether synthase activity. Hence we designated AK105964 and AK107161 OsHPL1 and OsHPL2 respectively. They are the first CYP74C family cDNAs to be found in monocots."
16124859,The genetic basis for cardiac remodeling.,10.1146/annurev.genom.6.080604.162132,"Cardiomyopathies are primary disorders of cardiac muscle associated with abnormalities of cardiac wall thickness, chamber size, contraction, relaxation, conduction, and rhythm. They are a major cause of morbidity and mortality at all ages and, like acquired forms of cardiovascular disease, often result in heart failure. Over the past two decades, molecular genetic studies of humans and analyses of model organisms have made remarkable progress in defining the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can result from mutations in 11 genes that encode sarcomere proteins, and dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by mutations at 25 chromosome loci where genes encoding contractile, cytoskeletal, and calcium regulatory proteins have been identified. Causes of cardiomyopathies associated with clinically important cardiac arrhythmias have also been discovered: Mutations in cardiac metabolic genes cause hypertrophy in association with ventricular pre-excitation and mutations causing arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia were recently discovered in protein constituents of desmosomes. This considerable genetic heterogeneity suggests that there are multiple pathways that lead to changes in heart structure and function. Defects in myocyte force generation, force transmission, and calcium homeostasis have emerged as particularly critical signals driving these pathologies. Delineation of the cell and molecular events triggered by cardiomyopathy gene mutations provide new fundamental knowledge about myocyte biology and organ physiology that accounts for cardiac remodeling and defines mechanistic pathways that lead to heart failure."
16137660,Preliminary assessment of the C13-side chain 2'-hydroxylase involved in taxol biosynthesis.,10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.119,"The biosynthesis of the anticancer drug Taxol in yew (Taxus) species is thought to involve the preliminary formation of the advanced taxane diterpenoid intermediate baccatin III upon which the functionally important N-benzoyl phenylisoserinoyl side chain is subsequently assembled at the C13-O-position. In vivo feeding studies with Taxus tissues and characterization of the two transferases responsible for C13-side chain construction have suggested a sequential process in which an aminomutase converts alpha-phenylalanine to beta-phenylalanine which is then activated to the corresponding CoA ester and transferred to baccatin III to yield beta-phenylalanoyl baccatin III (i.e., N-debenzoyl-2'-deoxytaxol) that undergoes subsequent 2'-hydroxylation and N-benzoylation to afford Taxol. However, because the side chain transferase can utilize both beta-phenylalanoyl CoA and phenylisoserinoyl CoA in the C13-O-esterification of baccatin III, ambiguity remained as to whether the 2'-hydroxylation step occurs before or after transfer of the amino phenylpropanoyl moiety. Using cell-free enzyme systems from Taxus suspension cells, no evidence was found for the direct hydroxylation of beta-phenylalanine to phenylisoserine; however, microsomal preparations from this tissue appeared capable of the cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation of beta-phenylalanoyl baccatin III to phenylisoserinoyl baccatin III (i.e., N-debenzoyltaxol) as the penultimate step in the formation of Taxol and related N-substituted taxoids. These preliminary results, which are consistent with the proposed side chain assembly process, have clarified an important step of Taxol biosynthesis and set the foundation for cloning the responsible cytochrome P450 hydroxylase gene."
16147539,Bone marrow transplantation and approaches to avoid graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).,10.1098/rstb.2005.1701,"Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers promise for the treatment of haematological and immune disorders, solid tumours, and as a tolerance inducing regimen for organ transplantation. Allogeneic HSCTs engraftment requires immunosuppression and the anti-tumour effects are dependent upon the immune effector cells that are contained within or generated from the donor graft. However, significant toxicities currently limit its efficacy. These problems include: (i) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in which donor T cells attack the recipient resulting in multi-organ attack and morbidity, (ii) a profound period of immune deficiency following HSCT, and (iii) donor graft rejection. Currently available methods to prevent or treat GVHD with systemic immunosuppression can lead to impaired immune recovery, increased opportunistic infections, and higher relapse rates. This review will provide an overview of GVHD pathophysiology and discuss the roles of various cells, pathways, and factors in the GVHD generation process and in the preservation of graft-versus-tumour effects. Variables that need to be taken into consideration in attempting to extrapolate preclinical results to the clinical paradigm will be highlighted."
16157873,Vitamin B6 biosynthesis in higher plants.,10.1073/pnas.0506228102,"Vitamin B6 is an essential metabolite in all organisms. It can act as a coenzyme for numerous metabolic enzymes and has recently been shown to be a potent antioxidant. Plants and microorganisms have a de novo biosynthetic pathway for vitamin B6, but animals must obtain it from dietary sources. In Escherichia coli, it is known that the vitamin is derived from deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (an intermediate in the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis) and 4-phosphohydroxy-l-threonine. It has been assumed that vitamin B6 is synthesized in the same way in plants, but this hypothesis has never been experimentally proven. Here, we show that, in plants, synthesis of the vitamin takes an entirely different route, which does not involve deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate but instead utilizes intermediates from the pentose phosphate pathway, i.e., ribose 5-phosphate or ribulose 5-phosphate, and from glycolysis, i.e., dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The revelation is based on the recent discovery that, in bacteria and fungi, a novel pathway is in place that involves two genes (PDX1 and PDX2), neither of which is homologous to any of those involved in the previously doctrined E. coli pathway. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana has two functional homologs of PDX1 and a single homolog of PDX2. Furthermore, and contrary to what was inferred previously, we show that the pathway appears to be cytosolic and is not localized to the plastid. Last, we report that the single PDX2 homolog is essential for plant viability."
16181324,"Interferon-gamma, the functional plasticity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and MHC class I antigen processing.",10.1111/j.0105-2896.2005.00308.x,"The proteasome system is a central component of a cascade of proteolytic processing steps required to generate antigenic peptides presented at the cell surface to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The nascent protein pool or DRiPs (defective ribosomal products) appear to represent an important source for MHC class I epitopes. Owing to the destructive activities of aminopeptidases in the cytosol, at most 1% of the peptides generated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system seems to be made available to the immune system. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) helps to override these limitations by the formation of immunoproteasomes, the activator complex PA28, and the induction of several aminopeptidases. Both immunoproteasomes and PA28 use cleavage sites already used by constitutive proteasomes but with altered and in some cases dramatically enhanced frequency. Therefore, two proteolytic cascades appear to have evolved to provide MHC class I epitopes. The 'constitutive proteolytic cascade' is designed to efficiently degrade proteins to single amino acid residues, allowing only a small percentage of peptides to be presented at the cell surface. In contrast, the IFN-gamma-controlled proteolytic cascade generates larger amounts of appropriate antigenic peptides, assuring more peptides to overcome the proteolytic restrictions of the constitutive system, thereby enhancing MHC class I antigen presentation."

A particular emphasis is put on the meaning of PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements, RAS and BRAF mutations, and deletions and mutations of mitochondrial genes and of nuclear genes encoding for mitochondrial enzymes, for thyroid tumorigenesis."
16203612,"Viral entry, lipid rafts and caveosomes.",10.1080/07853890510011976,"Lipid rafts and caveolae are detergent-insoluble plasma membrane microdomains, involved in cellular endocytic processes and signalling. Several viruses, including a human pathogen, echovirus 1, and an extensively studied simian virus 40 utilize these domains for internalization into the host cells. Interaction of viruses with receptors on the cell surface triggers specific conformational changes of the virus particle and can give rise to signalling events, which determine the mechanisms of virus entry. After internalization via cell surface lipid rafts or caveolae, virus-containing vesicles can fuse with caveosomes, pre-existing cytoplasmic organelles, or dock on other intracellular organelles. These pathways may deliver viruses further to different cellular destinations, where the viral replication cycle then takes place. The information concerning the viral entry processes is important for understanding the details of the infections, for finding new targets for antiviral therapy and for elucidating the cellular internalization pathways in general."

Deregulation of NTRK1 activity is associated with several human disorders. Loss of function mutations causes the genetic disease congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). Constitutive activation of NTRK1 has been detected in several tumor types. An autocrine loop involving NTRK1 and NGF is associated with tumor progression in prostate carcinoma and in breast cancer. A novel alternative splicing variant with constitutive oncogenic potential has been recently described in neuroblastoma. Somatic rearrangements of NTRK1, producing chimeric oncogenes with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, have been detected in a consistent fraction of papillary thyroid tumors. The topic of this review is a detailed analysis of the thyroid TRK oncogenes. The modalities of their activation, their mechanism of action, the contribution of activating sequences, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their generation will be discussed."

16260753,Three genomes differentially contribute to the biosynthesis of benzoxazinones in hexaploid wheat.,10.1073/pnas.0505156102,"Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) accumulates benzoxazinones (Bxs) as defensive compounds. Previously, we found that five Bx biosynthetic genes, TaBx1-TaBx5, are located on each of the three genomes (A, B, and D) of hexaploid wheat. In this study, we isolated three homoeologous cDNAs of each TaBx gene to estimate the contribution of individual homoeologous TaBx genes to the biosynthesis of Bxs in hexaploid wheat. We analyzed their transcript levels by homoeolog- or genome-specific quantitative RT-PCR and the catalytic properties of their translation products by kinetic analyses using recombinant TaBX enzymes. The three homoeologs were transcribed differentially, and the ratio of the individual homoeologous transcripts to total homoeologous transcripts also varied with the tissue, i.e., shoots or roots, as well as with the developmental stage. Moreover, the translation products of the three homoeologs had different catalytic properties. Some TaBx homoeologs were efficiently transcribed, but the translation products showed only weak enzymatic activities, which inferred their weak contribution to Bx biosynthesis. Considering the transcript levels and the catalytic properties collectively, we concluded that the homoeologs on the B genome generally contributed the most to the Bx biosynthesis in hexaploid wheat, especially in shoots. In tetraploid wheat and the three diploid progenitors of hexaploid wheat, the respective transcript levels of the TaBx homoeologs were similar in ratio to those observed in hexaploid wheat. This result indicates that the genomic bias in the transcription of the TaBx genes in hexaploid wheat originated in the diploid progenitors and has been retained through the polyploidization."

Increasing understanding of these molecular defects has considerably influenced both basic and translational research, and this has extended to many branches of medicine. Recent advances in both diagnosis and therapeutic modalities have allowed these defects to be identified earlier and to be more precisely defined, and they have also resulted in more promising long-term outcomes. The prospect of gene therapy continues to be included in the armamentarium of treatment considerations, because these conditions could be among the first to benefit from gene-therapy trials in humans."
16262699,Characterization of solanesyl and decaprenyl diphosphate synthases in mice and humans.,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04956.x,"The isoprenoid chain of ubiquinone (Q) is determined by trans-polyprenyl diphosphate synthase in micro-organisms and presumably in mammals. Because mice and humans produce Q9 and Q10, they are expected to possess solanesyl and decaprenyl diphosphate synthases as the determining enzyme for a type of ubiquinone. Here we show that murine and human solanesyl and decaprenyl diphosphate synthases are heterotetramers composed of newly characterized hDPS1 (mSPS1) and hDLP1 (mDLP1), which have been identified as orthologs of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dps1 and Dlp1, respectively. Whereas hDPS1 or mSPS1 can complement the S. pombe dps1 disruptant, neither hDLP1 nor mDLP1 could complement the S. pombe dLp1 disruptant. Thus, only hDPS1 and mSPS1 are functional orthologs of SpDps1. Escherichia coli was engineered to express murine and human SpDps1 and/or SpDlp1 homologs and their ubiquinone types were determined. Whereas transformants expressing a single component produced only Q8 of E. coli origin, double transformants expressing mSPS1 and mDLP1 or hDPS1 and hDLP1 produced Q9 or Q10, respectively, and an in vitro activity of solanesyl or decaprenyl diphosphate synthase was verified. The complex size of the human and murine long-chain trans-prenyl diphosphate synthases, as estimated by gel-filtration chromatography, indicates that they consist of heterotetramers. Expression in E. coli of heterologous combinations, namely, mSPS1 and hDLP1 or hDPS1 and mDLP1, generated both Q9 and Q10, indicating both components are involved in determining the ubiquinone side chain. Thus, we identified the components of the enzymes that determine the side chain of ubiquinone in mammals and they resembles the S. pombe, but not plant or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, type of enzyme."
16262799,CsrA and three redundant small RNAs regulate quorum sensing in Vibrio cholerae.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04902.x,"Bacteria communicate using a process called quorum sensing which involves production, secretion and detection of signalling molecules called autoinducers. Quorum sensing allows populations of bacteria to simultaneously regulate gene expression in response to changes in cell density. The human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, uses a quorum-sensing circuit composed of parallel systems that transduce information through four redundant regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) called quorum regulatory RNAs (Qrr) to control the expression of numerous genes, most notably those required for virulence. We show that the VarS/VarA two-component sensory system comprises an additional regulatory input controlling quorum-sensing-dependent gene expression in V. cholerae. VarS/VarA controls transcription of three previously unidentified small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) that are similar to the sRNAs CsrB and CsrC of Escherichia coli. The three V. cholerae sRNAs, which we name CsrB, CsrC and CsrD, act redundantly to control the activity of the global regulatory protein, CsrA. The VarS/VarA-CsrA/BCD system converges with the V. cholerae quorum-sensing systems to regulate the expression of the Qrr sRNAs, and thus, the entire quorum-sensing regulon."

The catabolic pathway of citronellol (Atu, acyclic terpene utilization) enters that of leucine/isovalerate (Liu, leucine and isovalerate utilization) at the level of methylcrotonyl-CoA. Key enzymes of the combined pathways are geranyl-CoA carboxylase (GCase) and methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCase). In this study, isovalerate-grown cells specifically expressed MCase (apparent molecular mass of the biotin-containing subunit, 74 kDa) only, and the GCase biotin-containing subunit (71 kDa) was not detected. Citronellol- or citronellate-grown cells produced both carboxylases. Biotin-dependent proteins were purified from crude extracts by avidin-affinity chromatography, and assigned to the corresponding coding genes by trypsin fingerprint analysis. The two subunits of MCase corresponded to liuB/liuD (PA2014/PA2012) of the P. aeruginosa genome database, and atuC/atuF (PA2888/PA2891) encoded GCase subunits. This finding is contrary to that reported by others. The identified genes are part of two separate gene clusters [liuRABCDE (PA2011-PA2016) and atuABCDEFGH (PA2886-PA2893)] that are thought to encode most of the genes of the Atu and Liu pathways."
16278835,"Assimilation, dissimilation, and detoxification of formaldehyde, a central metabolic intermediate of methylotrophic metabolism.",10.1002/tcr.20056,"Methanol is a valuable raw material used in the manufacture of useful chemicals as well as a potential source of energy to replace coal and petroleum. Biotechnological interest in the microbial utilization of methanol has increased because it is an ideal carbon source and can be produced from renewable biomass. Formaldehyde, a cytotoxic compound, is a central metabolic intermediate in methanol metabolism. Therefore, microorganisms utilizing methanol have adopted several metabolic strategies to cope with the toxicity of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is initially detoxified through trapping by some cofactors, such as glutathione, mycothiol, tetrahydrofolate, and tetrahydromethanopterin, before being oxidized to CO2. Alternatively, free formaldehyde can be trapped by sugar phosphates as the first reaction in the C1 assimilation pathways: the xylulose monophosphate pathway for yeasts and the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway for bacteria. In yeasts, although formaldehyde generation and consumption takes place in the peroxisome, the cytosolic formaldehyde oxidation pathway also plays a role in formaldehyde detoxification as well as energy formation. The key enzymes of the RuMP pathway are found in a variety of microorganisms including bacteria and archaea. Regulation of the genes encoding these enzymes and their catalytic mechanisms depend on the physiological traits of these organisms during evolution."
16299351,Bile salt biotransformations by human intestinal bacteria.,10.1194/jlr.R500013-JLR200,"Secondary bile acids, produced solely by intestinal bacteria, can accumulate to high levels in the enterohepatic circulation of some individuals and may contribute to the pathogenesis of colon cancer, gallstones, and other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Bile salt hydrolysis and hydroxy group dehydrogenation reactions are carried out by a broad spectrum of intestinal anaerobic bacteria, whereas bile acid 7-dehydroxylation appears restricted to a limited number of intestinal anaerobes representing a small fraction of the total colonic flora. Microbial enzymes modifying bile salts differ between species with respect to pH optima, enzyme kinetics, substrate specificity, cellular location, and possibly physiological function. Crystallization, site-directed mutagenesis, and comparisons of protein secondary structure have provided insight into the mechanisms of several bile acid-biotransforming enzymatic reactions. Molecular cloning of genes encoding bile salt-modifying enzymes has facilitated the understanding of the genetic organization of these pathways and is a means of developing probes for the detection of bile salt-modifying bacteria. The potential exists for altering the bile acid pool by targeting key enzymes in the 7alpha/beta-dehydroxylation pathway through the development of pharmaceuticals or sequestering bile acids biologically in probiotic bacteria, which may result in their effective removal from the host after excretion."
16314458,Biochemical analysis of the EJC reveals two new factors and a stable tetrameric protein core.,10.1261/rna.2155905,"The multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited on mRNAs upstream of exon-exon junctions as a consequence of pre-mRNA splicing. In mammalian cells, this complex serves as a key modulator of spliced mRNA metabolism. To date, neither the complete composition nor the exact assembly pathway of the EJC has been entirely elucidated. Using in vitro splicing and a two-step chromatography procedure, we have purified the EJC and analyzed its components by mass spectrometry. In addition to finding most of the known EJC factors, we identified two novel EJC components, Acinus and SAP18. Heterokaryon analysis revealed that SAP18 is a shuttling protein whereas Acinus is restricted to the nucleus. In MS2 tethering assays Acinus stimulated gene expression at the RNA level, while MLN51, another EJC factor, stimulated mRNA translational efficiency. Using tandem affinity purification (TAP) of proteins overexpressed in HeLa cells, we demonstrated that Acinus binds directly to another EJC component, RNPS1, while stable association of SAP18 to form the trimeric apoptosis and splicing associated protein (ASAP) complex requires both Acinus and RNPS1. Using the same methodology, we further identified what appears to be the minimal stable EJC core, a heterotetrameric complex consisting of eIF4AIII, Magoh, Y14, and MLN51."

16333668,Substrate specificity of N-methyltransferase involved in purine alkaloids synthesis is dependent upon one amino acid residue of the enzyme.,10.1007/s00438-005-0070-z,"Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine) are the major purine alkaloids in plants. To investigate the diversity of N-methyltransferases involved in purine alkaloid biosynthesis, we isolated the genes homologous for caffeine synthase from theobromine-accumulating plants. The predicted amino acid sequences of N-methyltransferases in theobromine-accumulating species in Camellia were more than 80% identical to caffeine synthase in C. sinensis. However, there was a little homology among the N-methyltransferases between Camellia and Theobroma. The recombinant enzymes derived from theobromine-accumulating plants had only 3-N-methyltransferase activity. The accumulation of purine alkaloids was, therefore, dependent on the substrate specificity of N-methyltransferase determined by one amino acid residue in the central part of the protein."

It is an unusually large multi-subunit protein complex, consisting of a central catalytic machine (called the 20S proteasome or CP/core particle) and two terminal regulatory subcomplexes, termed PA700 or RP/regulatory particle, that are attached to both ends of the central portion in opposite orientations to form an enzymatically active proteasome. To date, proteolysis driven by the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been shown to be involved in a diverse array of biologically important processes, such as the cell cycle, immune response, signaling cascades, and developmental programs; and the field continues to expand rapidly. Whereas the proteasome complex has been highly conserved during evolution because of its fundamental roles in cells, it has also acquired considerable diversity in multicellular organisms, particularly in mammals, such as immunoproteasomes, PA28, S5b, and various alternative splicing forms of S5a (Rpm 10). However, the details of the ultimate pathophysiological roles of mammalian proteasomes have remained elusive. This article focuses on methods for assay and purification of 26S proteasomes from mammalian cells and tissues."

B13 readily cometabolized monofluorobenzoates. A catabolic pathway for the isomeric fluorobenzoates is proposed on the basis of key metabolites isolated. Only 4-fluorobenzoate was utilized and totally degraded after a short period of adaptation. The isoenzymes for total degradation of chlorocatechols, being found during growth with 3-chlorobenzoate or 4-chlorophenol, were not induced in the presence of fluorobenzoates. Correspondingly, only the ordinary enzymes of the benzoate pathway were detected in 4-fluorobenzoate-grown cells. Ring cleavage of 3-fluorocatechol was recognized as a critical step in 3-fluorobenzoate degradation. 2-Fluoro-cis,cis-muconic acid was identified as a dead-end metabolite from 2- and 3-fluorobenzoate catabolism. During 2-fluorobenzoate cometabolism, fluoride is eliminated by the initial dioxygenation."

The importance of renal acid-base transport has been highlighted by mutations identified in several proteins involved in this task in patients with inborn forms of renal tubular acidosis. The underlying mechanisms of disease have been further studied in genetically altered mouse models and cell culture. An interesting field of research has focused on the question how changes in metabolism or acid-base homeostasis are sensed and result in altered excretion of acid or bases by the kidney. Several hormonal pathways including aldosterone and endothelin were implicated, a novel subfamily of proton-sensing receptors has been identified, and signaling molecules described that are activated by changes in pH."
16367960,Localization of a flavonoid biosynthetic polyphenol oxidase in vacuoles.,10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02625.x,"Aureusidin synthase, a polyphenol oxidase (PPO), specifically catalyzes the oxidative formation of aurones from chalcones, which are plant flavonoids, and is responsible for the yellow coloration of snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) flowers. All known PPOs have been found to be localized in plastids, whereas flavonoid biosynthesis is thought to take place in the cytoplasm [or on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)]. However, the primary structural characteristics of aureusidin synthase and some of its molecular properties argue against localization of the enzyme in plastids and the cytoplasm. In this study, the subcellular localization of the enzyme in petal cells of the yellow snapdragon was investigated. Sucrose-density gradient and differential centrifugation analyses suggested that the enzyme (the 39-kDa mature form) is not located in plastids or on the ER. Transient assays using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera fused with the putative propeptide of the PPO precursor suggested that the enzyme was localized within the vacuole lumen. We also found that the necessary information for vacuolar targeting of the PPO was encoded within the 53-residue N-terminal sequence (NTPP), but not in the C-terminal sequence of the precursor. NTPP-mediated ER-to-Golgi trafficking to vacuoles was confirmed by means of the co-expression of an NTPP-GFP chimera with a dominant negative mutant of the Arabidopsis GTPase Sar1 or with a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-fused Golgi marker (an H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase of Arabidopsis). We identified a sequence-specific vacuolar sorting determinant in the NTPP of the precursor. We have demonstrated the biosynthesis of a flavonoid skeleton in vacuoles. The findings of this metabolic compartmentation may provide a strategy for overcoming the biochemical instability of the precursor chalcones in the cytoplasm, thus leading to the efficient accumulation of aurones in the flower."
16385054,The genome sequence of Methanosphaera stadtmanae reveals why this human intestinal archaeon is restricted to methanol and H2 for methane formation and ATP synthesis.,10.1128/JB.188.2.642-658.2006,"Methanosphaera stadtmanae has the most restricted energy metabolism of all methanogenic archaea. This human intestinal inhabitant can generate methane only by reduction of methanol with H2 and is dependent on acetate as a carbon source. We report here the genome sequence of M. stadtmanae, which was found to be composed of 1,767,403 bp with an average G+C content of 28% and to harbor only 1,534 protein-encoding sequences (CDS). The genome lacks 37 CDS present in the genomes of all other methanogens. Among these are the CDS for synthesis of molybdopterin and for synthesis of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase complex, which explains why M. stadtmanae cannot reduce CO2 to methane or oxidize methanol to CO2 and why this archaeon is dependent on acetate for biosynthesis of cell components. Four sets of mtaABC genes coding for methanol:coenzyme M methyltransferases were found in the genome of M. stadtmanae. These genes exhibit homology to mta genes previously identified in Methanosarcina species. The M. stadtmanae genome also contains at least 323 CDS not present in the genomes of all other archaea. Seventy-three of these CDS exhibit high levels of homology to CDS in genomes of bacteria and eukaryotes. These 73 CDS include 12 CDS which are unusually long (>2,400 bp) with conspicuous repetitive sequence elements, 13 CDS which exhibit sequence similarity on the protein level to CDS encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cell surface antigens in bacteria, and 5 CDS which exhibit sequence similarity to the subunits of bacterial type I and III restriction-modification systems."
16401064,Light harvesting in photosystem I supercomplexes.,10.1021/bi051932o,"In photosynthetic membranes of cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants, photosystem I (PSI) mediates light-driven transmembrane electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochrome c6 to the ferredoxin-NADP complex. The oxidoreductase function of PSI is sensitized by a reversible photooxidation of primary electron donor P700, which launches a multistep electron transfer via a series of redox cofactors of the reaction center (RC). The excitation energy for the functioning of the primary electron donor in the RC is delivered via the chlorophyll core antenna in the complex with peripheral light-harvesting antennas. Supermolecular complexes of the PSI acquire remarkably different structural forms of the peripheral light-harvesting antenna complexes, including distinct pigment types and organizational principles. The PSI core antenna, being the main functional unit of the supercomplexes, provides an increased functional connectivity in the chlorophyll antenna network due to dense pigment packing resulting in a fast spread of the excitation among the neighbors. Functional connectivity within the network as well as the spectral overlap of antenna pigments allows equilibration of the excitation energy in the depth of the whole membrane within picoseconds and loss-free delivery of the excitation to primary donor P700 within 20-40 ps. Low-light-adapted cyanobacteria under iron-deficiency conditions extend this capacity via assembly of efficiently energy coupled rings of CP43-like complexes around the PSI trimers. In green algae and higher plants, less efficient energy coupling in the eukaryotic PSI-LHCI supercomplexes is probably a result of the structural adaptation of the Chl a/b binding LHCI peripheral antenna that not only extends the absorption cross section of the PSI core but participates in regulation of excitation flows between the two photosystems as well as in photoprotection."
16404574,"Genetic and biochemical evidence for involvement of HOTHEAD in the biosynthesis of long-chain alpha-,omega-dicarboxylic fatty acids and formation of extracellular matrix.",10.1007/s00425-005-0215-7,"In plants, extracellular matrix polymers built from polysaccharides and cuticular lipids have structural and protective functions. The cuticle is found to be ten times thinner in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh than in many other plants, and there is evidence that it is unusual in having a high content of alpha-,omega-dicarboxylic fatty acids (FAs) in its polyesters. We designated the new organ fusion mutant hth-12 after it appeared to be allelic to adhesion of calyx edges (ace) and hothead (hth), upon molecular cloning of the gene by transposon tagging. This mutant is deficient in its ability to oxidize long-chain omega-hydroxy FAs to omega-oxo FAs, which results in leaf polyesters in decreased alpha-,omega-dicarboxylic FAs and increased omega-hydroxy FAs. These chemical phenotypes lead to disorder of the cuticle membrane structure in hth-12. ACE/HTH is a single-domain protein showing sequence similarity to long-chain FA omega-alcohol dehydrogenases from Candida species, and we hypothesize that it may catalyze the next step after cytochrome P450 FA omega-hydroxylases in the omega-oxidation pathway. We show that ACE/HTH is specifically expressed in epidermal cells. It appears very likely therefore that the changes in the amount of alpha-,omega-dicarboxylic FAs in hth-12 reflect the different composition of cuticular polyesters. The ACE/HTH gene is also expressed in root epidermal cells which do not form a polyester membrane on the exterior surface, thereby making it possible that the end products of the pathway, alpha-,omega-dicarboxylic FAs, are generally required for the cross-linking that ensures the integrity of the outer epidermal cell wall."

A key feature of pathogenic S. aureus is the expression of an array of extracellular matrix-binding proteins. In particular, the fibronectin-binding proteins FnBP-A and FnBP-B afford the pathogen the ability to connect to cellular integrins and to trigger internalization into host cells. Recent work has highlighted the role of host cell invasion in the pathogenesis of S. aureus, the structure-function relationship of FnBPs, and the host factors required to allow bacterial uptake. Understanding the invasive capacity of S. aureus should open up new avenues to control this microorganism in diverse disease settings."
16407450,Glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase pathway and glutamate dehydrogenase play distinct roles in the sink-source nitrogen cycle in tobacco.,10.1104/pp.105.071910,"Glutamate (Glu) metabolism and amino acid translocation were investigated in the young and old leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi) using [15N]ammonium and [2-15N]Glu tracers. Regardless of leaf age, [15N]ammonium assimilation occurred via glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.1.1.3) and Glu synthase (ferredoxin [Fd]-GOGAT; EC 1.4.7.1; NADH-GOGAT; EC 1.4.1.14), both in the light and darkness, and it did not depend on Glu dehydrogenase (GDH; EC 1.4.1.2). The [15N]ammonium and ammonium accumulation patterns support the role of GDH in the deamination of [2-15N]Glu to provide 2-oxoglutarate and [15N]ammonium. In the dark, excess [15N]ammonium was incorporated into asparagine that served as an additional detoxification molecule. The constant Glu levels in the phloem sap suggested that Glu was continuously synthesized and supplied into the phloem regardless of leaf age. Further study using transgenic tobacco lines, harboring the promoter of the GLU1 gene (encoding Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana] Fd-GOGAT) fused to a GUS reporter gene, revealed that the expression of Fd-GOGAT remained higher in young leaves compared to old leaves, and higher in the veins compared to the mesophyll. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy localized the Fd-GOGAT protein to the phloem companion cells-sieve element complex in the leaf veins. The results are consistent with a role of Fd-GOGAT in supplying Glu for the synthesis and transport of amino acids. Taken together, the data provide evidence that the GS-GOGAT pathway and GDH play distinct roles in the source-sink nitrogen cycle of tobacco leaves."

GVHD can be considered an exaggerated, undesirable manifestation of a normal inflammatory mechanism, in which donor lymphocytes encounter foreign antigens in a milieu that fosters inflammation. Recent advances in the study of cytokine networks, chemokine gradients, and the direct mediators of cellular cytotoxicity have led to improved understanding of this complex syndrome. The pathophysiology of acute GVHD can be considered as a three-step process in which the innate and adaptive immune systems interact: (1) tissue damage to the recipient by the radiation/chemotherapy pretransplant conditioning regimen; (2) donor T-cell activation and clonal expansion; and (3) cellular and inflammatory factors. Here we review the immunologic interactions that cause clinical GVHD and discuss the risk factors and prophylactic strategies for acute GVHD according to this model."
16413106,The role of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases in the brain.,10.1016/j.mce.2005.12.002,"Glucocorticoids have a plethora of effects within the body to maintain homeostasis. In the brain they modify learning, memory and fear behaviours as well as regulating their own secretion by a negative feedback action. 11Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11beta-HSDs) are glucocorticoid metabolising enzymes that modify actions of glucocorticoids in a tissue specific manner. 11Beta-HSD1 regenerates active glucocorticoids from their inactive 11-keto derivatives, hence boosting tissue levels of corticosterone and cortisol. Removal of this enzyme (11beta-HSD1-/- mice) results in apparent lower intra-hippocampal corticosterone levels and reduces glucocorticoid-associated cognitive decline during ageing. This low corticosterone tissue environment is maintained even though there is a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and elevated basal and stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels. Conversely, the major central effects of 11beta-HSD2 are seen in development, as expression of 11beta-HSD2 is high in fetal and certain parts of the neonate brain, but is confined to a few discrete regions of the adult brain. 11Beta-HSD2 acts as a dehydrogenase, inactivating corticosterone or cortisol through conversion to 11-dehydrocorticosterone and cortisone. Loss of 11beta-HSD2 from the fetus and fetally derived tissues results in altered development of the cerebellum in the neonatal period and a life-long phenotype of anxiety, consistent with early life glucocorticoid programming."

16428816,The physiological role of the ribulose monophosphate pathway in bacteria and archaea.,10.1271/bbb.70.10,"3-Hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (PHI) are the key enzymes of the ribulose monophosphate pathway. This pathway, which was originally found in methylotrophic bacteria, is now recognized as a widespread prokaryotic pathway involved in formaldehyde fixation and detoxification. Recent progress, involving biochemical and genetic approaches in elucidating the physiological functions of HPS and PHI in methylotrophic as well as non-methylotrophic bacteria are described in this review. HPS and PHI orthologs are also found in a variety of archaeal strains. Some archaeal HPS orthologs are fused with other genes to form single ORF (e.g., the hps-phi gene of Pyrococcus spp. and the faeB-hpsB gene of Methanosarcina spp). These fused gene products exhibit functions corresponding to the individual enzyme activities, and are more efficient than equivalent systems made up of discrete enzymes. Recently, a novel metabolic function for HPS and PHI has been proposed in which these enzymes catalyze the reverse reaction for the biosynthesis of pentose phosphate in some archaeal strains. Thus the enzyme system plays a different role in bacteria and archaea by catalyzing the forward and reverse reactions respectively."

Analysis of the 2,909,809-bp genome will facilitate our molecular and biochemical understanding of the unusual metabolic repertoire of this bacterium, including its ability to couple denitrification to sulfur-compound oxidation, to catalyze anaerobic, nitrate-dependent oxidation of Fe(II) and U(IV), and to oxidize mineral electron donors. Notable genomic features include (i) genes encoding c-type cytochromes totaling 1 to 2 percent of the genome, which is a proportion greater than for almost all bacterial and archaeal species sequenced to date, (ii) genes encoding two [NiFe]hydrogenases, which is particularly significant because no information on hydrogenases has previously been reported for T. denitrificans and hydrogen oxidation appears to be critical for anaerobic U(IV) oxidation by this species, (iii) a diverse complement of more than 50 genes associated with sulfur-compound oxidation (including sox genes, dsr genes, and genes associated with the AMP-dependent oxidation of sulfite to sulfate), some of which occur in multiple (up to eight) copies, (iv) a relatively large number of genes associated with inorganic ion transport and heavy metal resistance, and (v) a paucity of genes encoding organic-compound transporters, commensurate with obligate chemolithoautotrophy. Ultimately, the genome sequence of T. denitrificans will enable elucidation of the mechanisms of aerobic and anaerobic sulfur-compound oxidation by beta-proteobacteria and will help reveal the molecular basis of this organism's role in major biogeochemical cycles (i.e., those involving sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon) and groundwater restoration."

GADH was purified to homogeneity. The 115-kDa homodimeric protein catalyzed the oxidation of glyceraldehyde with NADP+ at highest catalytic efficiency. NAD+ was not used. By MALDI-TOF analysis, open reading frame (ORF) Pto0332 was identified in the genome of P. torridus as the encoding gene, designated gadh, and the recombinant GADH was characterized. In Thermoplasma acidophilum ORF Ta0809 represents a gadh homolog with highest sequence identity; the gene was expressed and the recombinant protein was characterized as functional GADH with properties very similar to the P. torridus enzyme. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis define both GADHs as members of novel enzyme family within the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily."
16461648,Molecular cloning and expression of genes encoding a novel dioxygenase involved in low- and high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation in Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1.,10.1128/AEM.72.2.1045-1054.2006,"Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 is able to metabolize a wide range of low- and high-molecular-weight (HMW) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A 20-kDa protein was upregulated in PAH-metabolizing M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 cells compared to control cultures. The differentially expressed protein was identified as a beta subunit of the terminal dioxygenase using mass spectrometry. PCR with degenerate primers designed based on de novo sequenced peptides and a series of plaque hybridizations were done to screen the M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 genomic library. The genes, designated nidA3B3, encoding the alpha and beta subunits of terminal dioxygenase, were subsequently cloned and sequenced. The deduced enzyme revealed close similarities to the corresponding PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases from Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus spp. but had the highest similarity, 61.9%, to the alpha subunit from Nocardioides sp. strain KP7. The alpha subunit also showed 52% sequence homology with the previously reported NidA from M. vanbaalenii PYR-1. The genes nidA3B3 were subcloned into the expression vector pET-17b, and the enzyme activity in Escherichia coli cells was reconstituted through coexpression with the ferredoxin (PhdC) and ferredoxin reductase (PhdD) genes of the phenanthrene dioxygenase from Nocardioides sp. strain KP7. The recombinant PAH dioxygenase appeared to favor the HMW PAH substrates fluoranthene, pyrene, and phenanthrene. Several other PAHs, including naphthalene, anthracene, and benz[a]anthracene, were also converted to their corresponding cis-dihydrodiols. The recombinant E. coli, however, did not show any dioxygenation activity for phthalate and biphenyl. The upregulation of nidA3B3 in M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 induced by PAHs was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis."
16469879,Structure of the hydrophilic domain of respiratory complex I from Thermus thermophilus.,10.1126/science.1123809,"Respiratory complex I plays a central role in cellular energy production in bacteria and mitochondria. Its dysfunction is implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in aging. The crystal structure of the hydrophilic domain (peripheral arm) of complex I from Thermus thermophilus has been solved at 3.3 angstrom resolution. This subcomplex consists of eight subunits and contains all the redox centers of the enzyme, including nine iron-sulfur clusters. The primary electron acceptor, flavin-mononucleotide, is within electron transfer distance of cluster N3, leading to the main redox pathway, and of the distal cluster N1a, a possible antioxidant. The structure reveals new aspects of the mechanism and evolution of the enzyme. The terminal cluster N2 is coordinated, uniquely, by two consecutive cysteines. The novel subunit Nqo15 has a similar fold to the mitochondrial iron chaperone frataxin, and it may be involved in iron-sulfur cluster regeneration in the complex."
16470226,Integrated signalling pathways for mast-cell activation.,10.1038/nri1782,"Mast-cell activation mediated by the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) is considered to be a key event in the allergic inflammatory response. However, in a physiological setting, other receptors, such as KIT, might also markedly influence the release of mediators by mast cells. Recent studies have provided evidence that FcepsilonRI-dependent degranulation is regulated by two complementary signalling pathways, one of which activates phospholipase Cgamma and the other of which activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, using specific transmembrane and cytosolic adaptor molecules. In this Review, we discuss the evidence for these interacting pathways and describe how the capacity of KIT, and other receptors, to influence FcepsilonRI-dependent mast-cell-mediator release might be a function of the relative abilities of these receptors to activate these alternative pathways."
16494875,"Four gene products are required for the fungal synthesis of the indole-diterpene, paspaline.",10.1016/j.febslet.2006.02.008,"Paspaline belongs to a large, structurally and functionally diverse group of indole-diterpenes synthesized by filamentous fungi. However, the identity of the gene products required for the biosynthesis of paspaline, a key intermediate for the synthesis of paxilline and other indole-diterpenes, is not known. Transfer of constructs containing different pax gene combinations into a paxilline negative deletion derivative of Penicillium paxilli demonstrated that just four proteins, PaxG, a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, PaxM, a FAD-dependent monooxygenase, PaxB, a putative membrane protein, and PaxC, a prenyl transferase, are required for the biosynthesis of paspaline."
1649829,Isolation and characterization of Escherichia coli K-12 mutants lacking both 2-acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine acyltransferase and acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase activity.,,"2-Acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (2-acyl-GPE) acyltransferase and acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) synthetase are thought to be dual catalytic activities of a single inner membrane enzyme. A filter disc replica print method for the detection of acyl-ACP synthetase activity by colony fluorography was used to screen a mutagenized population of cells for acyl-ACP synthetase mutants (aas). All aas mutants lacked both acyl-ACP synthetase and 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase activities in vitro. There was no detectable acyl-CoA-independent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into phosphatidylethanolamine or the major outer membrane lipoprotein in aas mutants. Exogenous lysophospholipid uptake and acylation was also lacking in aas mutants. Lipoprotein acylation by phospholipids synthesized by the de novo biosynthetic pathway was not affected in aas mutants showing that this gene product was not directly involved in lipoprotein biogenesis. The aas mutants had an altered membrane phospholipid composition and accumulated both 2-acyl-GPE and acylphosphatidylglycerol. Acylphosphatidylglycerol accumulation was due to the transacylase activity of lysophospholipase L2 (the pldB gene product) since aas pldB double mutants accumulated 2-acyl-GPE, but not acylphosphatidylglycerol. The aas allele was mapped to 61 min of the Escherichia coli chromosome, and the deduced gene order in this region was thyA-aas-lysA. The biochemical, physiological, and genetic analyses of aas mutants support the conclusion that 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase and acyl-ACP synthetase are two activities of the same protein and confirm that this enzyme system participates in membrane phospholipid turnover and governs the acyl-CoA independent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids and lysophospholipids into the membrane."
16499623,Gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate hydrolase in the putrescine utilization pathway of Escherichia coli K-12.,10.1111/j.1574-6968.2006.00137.x,"gamma-Glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate hydrolase (PuuD) was purified and the properties of the enzyme were characterized. The active center of PuuD was identified as Cys-114 by site-directed mutagenesis. The expression of PuuD was induced by putrescine and O2 (substrates of the Puu pathway), while the addition of succinate or NH4Cl (products of the Puu pathway) to the medium reduced the expression of PuuD. The findings that the puuD-deficient strain accumulated gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate (gamma-Glu-GABA) and could not grow on putrescine as a sole nitrogen source indicate that PuuD is physiologically important as a gamma-Glu-GABA hydrolase."
16531502,Cytochrome P450 CYP710A encodes the sterol C-22 desaturase in Arabidopsis and tomato.,10.1105/tpc.105.036012,"Delta22-unsaturated sterols, containing a double bond at the C-22 position in the side chain, occur specifically in fungi and plants. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of cytochrome P450s belonging to the CYP710A family as the plant C-22 desaturase. Recombinant proteins of CYP710A1 and CYP710A2 from Arabidopsis thaliana and CYP710A11 from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) were expressed using a baculovirus/insect system. The Arabidopsis CYP710A1 and tomato CYP710A11 proteins exhibited C-22 desaturase activity with beta-sitosterol to produce stigmasterol (CYP710A1, K(m) = 1.0 microM and kinetic constant [k(cat)] = 0.53 min(-1); CYP710A11, K(m) = 3.7 microM and k(cat) = 10 min(-1)). In Arabidopsis transgenic lines with CYP710A1 and CYP710A11 overexpression, stigmasterol levels increased by 6- to 32-fold. Arabidopsis CYP710A2 was able to produce brassicasterol and stigmasterol from 24-epi-campesterol and beta-sitosterol, respectively. Sterol profiling analyses for CYP710A2 overexpression and a T-DNA insertion event into CYP710A2 clearly demonstrated in planta that CYP710A2 was responsible for both brassicasterol and stigmasterol production. Semiquantitative PCR analyses and promoter:beta-glucuronidase transgenic approaches indicated strict tissue/organ-specific regulation for each CYP710A gene, implicating differential tissue distributions of the Delta(22)-unsaturated sterols in Arabidopsis. Our results support the possibility that the CYP710 family may encode P450s of sterol C-22 desaturases in different organisms."
1654502,"Genetics of streptomycin production in Streptomyces griseus: nucleotide sequence of five genes, strFGHIK, including a phosphatase gene.",10.1007/BF00260640,"The cluster of streptomycin (SM) production genes in Streptomyces griseus was further analysed by determining the nucleotide sequence of genes strFGHIK. The products of the strF and/or strG genes may be involved in the formation of N-methyl-L-glucosamine, and that of the strH gene in the first glycosylation step condensing streptidine-6-phosphate and dihydrostreptose. The putative StrI protein showed strong similarity to the amino-terminal NAD(P)-binding sites of many dehydrogenases, especially of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases. The product of the strK gene strongly resembles the alkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli. It was shown that S. griseus excretes an enzyme that specifically cleaves both SM-6-phosphate and--more slowly--SM-3''-phosphate ate during the production phase for SM. The identity of this enzyme with the StrK protein was demonstrated by expression of the strK gene in Streptomyces lividans 66. Further evidence for an involvement of these genes in SM biosynthesis came from the fact that genes homologous to them were found in the equivalent gene cluster of the hydroxy-SM producer Streptomyces glaucescens; these, however, were in part differently organized. The ca. 5 kb DNA segment downstream of strI in S. griseus which contains the strK gene was found to be located in inverse orientation between the homologues of the aphD and strR genes in S. glaucescens."
16547389,Multiplicity of mammalian reductases for xenobiotic carbonyl compounds.,10.2133/dmpk.21.1,"A variety of carbonyl compounds are present in foods, environmental pollutants, and drugs. These xenobiotic carbonyl compounds are metabolized into the corresponding alcohols by many mammalian NAD(P)H-dependent reductases, which belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) and aldo-keto reductase superfamilies. Recent genomic analysis, cDNA isolation and characterization of the recombinant enzymes suggested that, in humans, the six members of each of the two superfamilies, i.e., total of 12 enzymes, are involved in the reductive metabolism of xenobiotic carbonyl compounds. They comprise three types of carbonyl reductase, dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR family) member 4, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, L-xylulose reductase, two types of aflatoxin B1 aldehyde reductase, 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and three types of 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Accumulating data on the human enzymes provide new insights into their roles in cellular and molecular reactions including xenobiotic metabolism. On the other hand, mice and rats lack the gene for a protein corresponding to human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3, but instead possess additional five or six genes encoding proteins that are structurally related to human hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Characterization of the additional enzymes suggested their involvement in species-specific biological events and species differences in the metabolism of xenobiotic carbonyl compounds."

16564093,Fatty acid elongases in mammals: their regulation and roles in metabolism.,10.1016/j.plipres.2006.01.004,"A significant amount of the fatty acids synthesized by the cytosolic enzyme complex fatty acid synthase (FAS) or taken up by the diet are further elongated into very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in a four-step reaction cycle by membrane-bound enzymes predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Members of the Elovl (elongation-of-very-long-chain-fatty acids) gene family encode for enzymes (elongases), which are believed to perform the first, regulatory, step (condensation) in the elongation cycle in mammals. The family of enzymes consists of at least six members in mouse and human, believed to carry out substrate-specific elongation with fatty acids of different lengths and degrees of unsaturation. The ability to synthesize VLCFA is a ubiquitous system found in different organs and cell types. However, VLCFAs seldom occur unesterified. Instead, they are joined either by an ester or amide linkage to a broad variety of different lipid species. VLCFA are most commonly found as building blocks in sphingolipids, although they are also important constituents of glycerophospholipids, triacylglycerols, sterol- and wax-esters. To generalize, the fatty acid elongases can be divided into two major groups: (a) enzymes which are suggested to be involved in the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFA (ELOVL1, 3 and 6) and (b) enzymes which are elongases of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (ELOVL2, 4 and 5). All the elongases exhibit specific spatial and temporal expression. In this review, we will present and discuss the regulation of the mammalian fatty acid elongases and their potential role in lipid metabolism. We will consider both the biochemical functions of the proteins, as well as their role in a more physiological context."

To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway and to isolate and characterize genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids including artemisinin in A. annua, glandular trichomes were used as an enriched source for biochemical and molecular biological studies. The sequencing of 900 randomly selected clones from a glandular trichome plasmid cDNA library revealed the presence of many ESTs involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis such as enzymes from the methylerythritol phosphate pathway and the mevalonate pathway, amorpha-4,11-diene synthase and other sesquiterpene synthases, monoterpene synthases and two cDNAs showing high similarity to germacrene A synthases. Full-length sequencing of the latter two ESTs resulted in a 1686-bp ORF encoding a protein of 562 aa. Upon expression in Escherichia coli, the recombinant protein was inactive with geranyl diphosphate, but catalyzed the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to germacrene A. These results demonstrate the potential of the use of A. annua glandular trichomes as a starting material for studying isoprenoid biosynthesis in this plant species."

The subcomplex is stable in sodium dodecyl sulfate up to 80 degrees C. Of nine iron-sulfur clusters, four to five (one or two binuclear and three tetranuclear) could be detected by EPR in the NADH-reduced enzyme. The preparation consists of eight different polypeptides. Seven of them have been positively identified by peptide mass mapping and N-terminal sequencing as known hydrophilic subunits of T. thermophilus complex I. The eighth polypeptide copurified with the subcomplex at all stages, is strongly associated with the other subunits, and is present in crystals of the subcomplex, used for X-ray data collection. Therefore, it has been identified as a novel complex I subunit and named Nqo15. It is encoded in a locus separate from the nqo operon, containing the 14 other known complex I genes. ORFs encoding Nqo15 homologues are present in the genomes of the closest relatives of T. thermophilus. Our data show that, contrary to previous assumptions, bacterial complex I can contain proteins in addition to a ""core"" complement of 14 subunits."
16595667,"Arabidopsis thaliana VTC4 encodes L-galactose-1-P phosphatase, a plant ascorbic acid biosynthetic enzyme.",10.1074/jbc.M601409200,"In plants, a proposed ascorbate (vitamin C) biosynthesis pathway occurs via GDP-D-mannose (GDP-D-Man), GDP-L-galactose (GDP-L-Gal), and L-galactose. However, the steps involved in the synthesis of L-Gal from GDP-L-Gal in planta are not fully characterized. Here we present evidence for an in vivo role for L-Gal-1-P phosphatase in plant ascorbate biosynthesis. We have characterized a low ascorbate mutant (vtc4-1) of Arabidopsis thaliana, which exhibits decreased ascorbate biosynthesis. Genetic mapping and sequencing of the VTC4 locus identified a mutation (P92L) in a gene with predicted L-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity (At3g02870). Pro-92 is within a beta-bulge that is conserved in related myo-inositol monophosphatases. The mutation is predicted to disrupt the positioning of catalytic amino acid residues within the active site. Accordingly, L-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity in vtc4-1 was approximately 50% of wild-type plants. In addition, vtc4-1 plants incorporate significantly more radiolabel from [2-(3)H]Man into L-galactosyl residues suggesting that the mutation increases the availability of GDP-L-Gal for polysaccharide synthesis. Finally, a homozygous T-DNA insertion line, which lacks a functional At3g02870 gene product, is also ascorbate-deficient (50% of wild type) and deficient in L-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity. Genetic complementation tests revealed that the insertion mutant and VTC4-1 are alleles of the same genetic locus. The significantly lower ascorbate and perturbed L-Gal metabolism in vtc4-1 and the T-DNA insertion mutant indicate that L-Gal-1-P phosphatase plays a role in plant ascorbate biosynthesis. The presence of ascorbate in the T-DNA insertion mutant suggests there is a bypass to this enzyme or that other pathways also contribute to ascorbate biosynthesis."
16595677,Identification of a novel arabinofuranosyltransferase (AftA) involved in cell wall arabinan biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,10.1074/jbc.M600045200,"The cell wall mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex is essential in mycobacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and is the target of several anti-tubercular drugs. For instance, ethambutol targets arabinogalactan biosynthesis through inhibition of the arabinofuranosyltransferases Mt-EmbA and Mt-EmbB. Following a detailed bioinformatics analysis of genes surrounding the conserved emb locus, we present the identification and characterization of a novel arabinofuranosyltransferase AftA (Rv3792). The enzyme catalyzes the addition of the first key arabinofuranosyl residue from the sugar donor beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryldecaprenol to the galactan domain of the cell wall, thus ""priming"" the galactan for further elaboration by the arabinofuranosyltransferases. Because aftA is an essential gene in M. tuberculosis, we deleted its orthologue in Corynebacterium glutamicum to produce a slow growing but viable mutant. Analysis of its cell wall revealed the complete absence of arabinose resulting in a truncated cell wall structure possessing only a galactan core with a concomitant loss of cell wall-bound mycolates. Complementation of the mutant was fully restored to the wild type phenotype by Cg-aftA. In addition, by developing an in vitro assay using recombinant Escherichia coli expressing Mt-aftA and use of cell wall galactan as an acceptor, we demonstrated the transfer of arabinose from beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryldecaprenol to galactan, and unlike the Mt-Emb proteins, Mt-AftA was not inhibited by ethambutol. This newly discovered glycosyltransferase represents an attractive drug target for further exploitation by chemotherapeutic intervention."
16597948,Purification and characterization of TrzF: biuret hydrolysis by allophanate hydrolase supports growth.,10.1128/AEM.72.4.2491-2495.2006,"TrzF, the allophanate hydrolase from Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned, overexpressed in the presence of a chaperone protein, and purified to homogeneity. Native TrzF had a subunit molecular weight of 65,401 and a subunit stoichiometry of alpha(2) and did not contain significant levels of metals. TrzF showed time-dependent inhibition by phenyl phosphorodiamidate and is a member of the amidase signature protein family. TrzF was highly active in the hydrolysis of allophanate but was not active with urea, despite having been previously considered a urea amidolyase. TrzF showed lower activity with malonamate, malonamide, and biuret. The allophanate hydrolase from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, AtzF, was also shown to hydrolyze biuret slowly. Since biuret and allophanate are consecutive metabolites in cyanuric acid metabolism, the low level of biuret hydrolase activity can have physiological significance. A recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing atzD, encoding cyanuric acid hydrolase that produces biuret, and atzF grew slowly on cyanuric acid as a source of nitrogen. The amount of growth produced was consistent with the liberation of 3 mol of ammonia from cyanuric acid. In vitro, TrzF was shown to hydrolyze biuret to liberate 3 mol of ammonia. The biuret hydrolyzing activity of TrzF might also be physiologically relevant in native strains. E. cloacae strain 99 grows on cyanuric acid with a significant accumulation of biuret."

The M-LPH gene is composed of four exons, extends over 14kb on chromosome 16p13.1, and is expressed as two alternatively spliced variants comprising four and three exons, respectively, which include open-reading frames encoding two distinct isoforms composed of 196 (M-LPH1) and 147 (M-LPH2) amino acids, respectively. These two variants were expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, however only M-LPH1 was detected at the protein level. Dual-color confocal analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with a green fluorescent protein-tagged M-LPH1 demonstrated that M-LPH1 is localized in peroxisomes. In order to elucidate the function of M-LPH1, we examined the mRNA levels of several enzymes involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species in COS-7 cells and found that transfection with M-LPH1 down-regulates expression of the plasma glutathione peroxidase and catalase genes. These results show the existence of the human homolog of M-LP and its participation in reactive oxygen species metabolism."
16632608,Binding of 5'-GTP to the C-terminal FeS cluster of the radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme MoaA provides insights into its mechanism.,10.1073/pnas.0510711103,"The first step in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, the conversion of 5'-GTP to precursor Z, an oxygen-sensitive tetrahydropyranopterin is catalyzed by the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme MoaA and the accessory protein MoaC. This reaction involves the radical-initiated intramolecular rearrangement of the guanine C8 atom. MoaA harbors an N-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is involved in the reductive cleavage of SAM and generates a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical (5'-dA*), and a C-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster presumably involved in substrate binding and/or activation. Biochemical studies identified residues involved in 5'-GTP binding and the determinants of nucleotide specificity. The crystal structure of MoaA in complex with 5'-GTP confirms the biochemical data and provides valuable insights into the subsequent radical reaction. MoaA binds 5'-GTP with high affinity and interacts through its C-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster with the guanine N1 and N2 atoms, in a yet uncharacterized binding mode. The tightly anchored triphosphate moiety prevents the escape of radical intermediates. This structure also visualizes the L-Met and 5'-dA cleavage products of SAM. Rotation of the 5'-dA ribose and/or conformational changes of the guanosine are proposed to bring the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical into close proximity of either the ribose C2' and C3' or the guanine C8 carbon atoms leading to hydrogen abstraction."
16666853,Hydroxamic Acid glucosyltransferases from maize seedlings.,10.1104/pp.90.3.1071,"Hydroxamic acids occur in several forms in maize (Zea mays L.) with 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) being the predominant form and others including 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIBOA) being found at lower concentrations. Two enzymes capable of glucosylating hydroxamic acids were identified in maize protein extracts and partially purified and characterized. The total enzyme activity per seedling increased during the first 4 days of germination and was concurrent with the accumulation of DIMBOA. Purification of the enzymes by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Sephadex G-200 and Q-Sepharose gel chromatography resulted in a 13-fold increase in specific activity. The enzymes are initially separated into two peaks (peak 1 and peak 2) of activity by Q-Sepharose gel chromatography. The peak 1 glucosyltransferase had 3.6% of the DIMBOA glucosylating activity when DIBOA was used as substrate, whereas this percentage increased to 57% for the peak 2 enzyme. The enzyme in peak 2 has a K(m) of 174 micromolar for DIMBOA and a K(m) of 638 micromolar for DIBOA; the enzyme in peak 1 has a K(m) of 217 micromolar for DIMBOA and its activity on DIBOA was too low to determine a K(m). The identification of two glucosyltransferases capable of glucosylating hydroxamic acids in vitro serves as an initial step in the characterization of the enzymes involved in production of hydroxamic acids in maize."

We detected chalcone-synthase and UDP-glucose:flavanone-7-O-glucosyl-transferase activities in cell-free extracts of Citrus. The glucosylated flavanone was further rhamnosylated when exogenous UDP-glucose and NADPH were added to the extract. Chalcone-synthase activity was detected in cell-free extracts derived from young leaves and fruits. Young fruits (2 millimeter diameter) had the highest chalcone synthase activity. UDP-glucose:flavanone-7-O-glucosyl-transferase activity was measured in cell-free extracts derived from young leaves and fruits of Citrus mitis and Citrus maxima. The highest UDP-glucose:flavanone-7-O-glucosyl-transferase activity was found in young C. maxima leaves. These data indicate that Citrus contains a flavonoid pathway similar to that studied in other species."
16700615,Molecular biology of human gliomas.,10.1177/153303460600500302,"Human gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system neoplasm, and they are a complex, heterogeneous, and difficult disease to treat. In the past two decades, advances in molecular biology have revolutionized our understanding of the mechanism by which these neoplasms are initiated and progress. While surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have roles to play in the treatment of patients with gliomas; these therapies are self-limited because of the intrinsic resistance of glioma cells to therapy, and the diffusely infiltrating nature of the lesions. It is now known that malignant gliomas arise from a number of well-characterized genetic alterations and activations of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. These genetic alterations disrupt critical cell cycle, growth factor activation, apoptotic, cell motility, and invasion pathways that lead to phenotypic changes and neoplastic transformation. Research in each of these fields has uncovered potential therapeutic targets that look promising for disease control. Gliomas can now be modeled with fidelity and reproducibility using several transgenic and knockout strategies. Transgenic mouse models are facilitating the testing of various therapeutic strategies in vivo. Finally, the recognition of the putative brain tumor stem cell, the tumor initiating cell in brain cancer, provides an enticing target through which we could eliminate the source of the brain tumor with increased efficacy and less toxicity to normal tissues. In this review, we provide an up-to-date discussion of the many of key technologies and tools that are being used in molecular biology to advance our understanding of the biological behavior of human malignant gliomas."
16707670,"The ectD gene, which is involved in the synthesis of the compatible solute hydroxyectoine, is essential for thermoprotection of the halophilic bacterium Chromohalobacter salexigens.",10.1128/JB.00136-06,"The halophilic bacterium Chromohalobacter salexigens synthesizes and accumulates compatible solutes in response to salt and temperature stress. (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of cells grown in minimal medium at the limiting temperature of 45 degrees C revealed the presence of hydroxyectoine, ectoine, glutamate, trehalose (not present in cells grown at 37 degrees C), and the ectoine precursor, Ngamma-acetyldiaminobutyric acid. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that the levels of ectoine and hydroxyectoine were maximal during the stationary phase of growth. Accumulation of hydroxyectoine was up-regulated by salinity and temperature, whereas accumulation of ectoine was up-regulated by salinity and down-regulated by temperature. The ectD gene, which is involved in the conversion of ectoine to hydroxyectoine, was isolated as part of a DNA region that also contains a gene whose product belongs to the AraC-XylS family of transcriptional activators. Orthologs of ectD were found within the sequenced genomes of members of the proteobacteria, firmicutes, and actinobacteria, and their products were grouped into the ectoine hydroxylase subfamily, which was shown to belong to the superfamily of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases. Analysis of the ectoine and hydroxyectoine contents of an ectABC ectD mutant strain fed with 1 mM ectoine or hydroxyectoine demonstrated that ectD is required for the main ectoine hydroxylase activity in C. salexigens. Although in minimal medium at 37 degrees C the wild-type strain grew with 0.5 to 3.0 M NaCl, with optimal growth at 1.5 M NaCl, at 45 degrees C it could not cope with the lowest (0.75 M NaCl) or the highest (3.0 M NaCl) salinity, and it grew optimally at 2.5 M NaCl. The ectD mutation caused a growth defect at 45 degrees C in minimal medium with 1.5 to 2.5 M NaCl, but it did not affect growth at 37 degrees C at any salinity tested. With 2.5 M NaCl, the ectD mutant synthesized 38% (at 37 degrees C) and 15% (at 45 degrees C) of the hydroxyectoine produced by the wild-type strain. All of these data reveal that hydroxyectoine synthesis mediated by the ectD gene is thermoregulated and essential for thermoprotection of C. salexigens."

16723977,Early nonsense: mRNA decay solves a translational problem.,10.1038/nrm1942,"Gene expression is highly accurate and rarely generates defective proteins. Several mechanisms ensure this fidelity, including specialized surveillance pathways that rid the cell of mRNAs that are incompletely processed or that lack complete open reading frames. One such mechanism, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, is triggered when ribosomes encounter a premature translation-termination--or nonsense--codon. New evidence indicates that the specialized factors that are recruited for this process not only promote rapid mRNA degradation, but are also required to resolve a poorly dissociable termination complex."
16740475,A hedgehog-induced BTB protein modulates hedgehog signaling by degrading Ci/Gli transcription factor.,10.1016/j.devcel.2006.05.004,"The Ci/Gli family of transcription factors mediates Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in many key developmental processes. Here we identify a Hh-induced MATH and BTB domain containing protein (HIB) as a negative regulator of the Hh pathway. Overexpressing HIB down regulates Ci and blocks Hh signaling, whereas inactivating HIB results in Ci accumulation and enhanced pathway activity. HIB binds the N- and C-terminal regions of Ci, both of which mediate Ci degradation. HIB forms a complex with Cul3, a scaffold for modular ubiquitin ligases, and promotes Ci ubiquitination and degradation through Cul3. Furthermore, HIB-mediated Ci degradation is stimulated by Hh and inhibited by Suppressor of Fused (Sufu). The mammalian homolog of HIB, SPOP, can functionally substitute for HIB, and Gli proteins are degraded by HIB/SPOP in Drosophila. We provide evidence that HIB prevents aberrant Hh signaling posterior to the morphogenic furrow, which is essential for normal eye development."

Mining of the Arabidopsis genome sequence database revealed 20 genes with homology to seed-specific FAE1 KCS. Eight of the 20 putative KCSs were cloned, expressed in yeast, and isolated as (His)6 fusion proteins. Five of the eight (At1g71160, At1g19440, At1g07720, At5g04530, and At4g34250) had little or no activity with C16 to C20 substrates while three demonstrated activity with C16, C18, and C20 saturated acyl-CoA substrates. At1g01120 KCS (KCS1) and At2g26640 KCS had broad substrate specificities when assayed with saturated and mono-unsaturated C16 to C24 acyl-CoAs while At4g34510 KCS was specific for saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates."
16766188,The RNA degradosome: life in the fast lane of adaptive molecular evolution.,10.1016/j.tibs.2006.05.005,"In Escherichia coli, the multi-enzyme RNA degradosome contributes to the global, posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. The degradosome components are recognized through natively unstructured ""microdomains"" comprising as few as 15-40 amino acids. Consequently, the degradosome might experience a comparatively smaller number of evolutionary constraints, because there is little requirement to maintain a folded state for the interaction sites. New regulatory properties of the degradosome could arise with relative rapidity, because partners that modify its function could be recruited by quickly evolving microdomains. The unusual combination of the centrality of RNA degradation in gene expression and the generality of natively unstructured microdomains in recognition can fortuitously confer a capacity for efficacious adaptive change to degradosome-like assemblies in eubacteria."
16774647,Genetical metabolomics of flavonoid biosynthesis in Populus: a case study.,10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02786.x,"Genetical metabolomics [metabolite profiling combined with quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis] has been proposed as a new tool to identify loci that control metabolite abundances. This concept was evaluated in a case study with the model tree Populus. Using HPLC, the peak abundances were analyzed of 15 closely related flavonoids present in apical tissues of two full-sib poplar families, Populus deltoides cv. S9-2 x P. nigra cv. Ghoy and P. deltoides cv. S9-2 x P. trichocarpa cv. V24, and correlation and QTL analysis were used to detect flux control points in flavonoid biosynthesis. Four robust metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL), associated with rate-limiting steps in flavonoid biosynthesis, were mapped. Each mQTL was involved in the flux control to one or two flavonoids. Based on the identities of the affected metabolites and the flavonoid pathway structure, a tentative function was assigned to three of these mQTL, and the corresponding candidate genes were mapped. The data indicate that the combination of metabolite profiling with QTL analysis is a valuable tool to identify control points in a complex metabolic pathway of closely related compounds."

This strain grows aerobically on DF as the sole source of carbon and energy; it has a doubling time of 12 hours at 30 degrees C; and it almost completely degraded 100 mg/L(-1) DF in 5 days, producing 2,2',3-trihydroxybiphenyl, salicylic acid, gentisic acid, and other metabolites. The dbdA (DF dioxygenase) gene cluster in the strain is almost identical to that on a large plasmid in Terrabacter sp. YK3. Unlike Janibacter sp. strain YY-1, XJ-1 accumulates gentisic acid rather than catechol as a final product of DF degradation."

Altering the interactions between transport receptors and their cargo has been shown to be a major regulatory mechanism to control traffic through NPCs. New evidence now suggests that NPC proteins play active roles in translocation, and that transport is also controlled by dynamic changes in NPC composition and architecture. This view of ever-changing NPCs necessitates the re-evaluation of current models of nuclear transport and how this process is regulated."
16788179,The ribulose monophosphate pathway substitutes for the missing pentose phosphate pathway in the archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis.,10.1128/JB.00492-06,"The ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, involving 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (PHI), is now recognized as a widespread prokaryotic pathway for formaldehyde fixation and detoxification. Interestingly, HPS and PHI homologs are also found in a variety of archaeal strains, and recent biochemical and genome analyses have raised the possibility that the reverse reaction of formaldehyde fixation, i.e., ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) synthesis from fructose 6-phosphate, may function in the biosynthesis of Ru5P in some archaeal strains whose pentose phosphate pathways are imperfect. In this study, we have taken a genetic approach to address this possibility by using the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1. This strain possesses a single open reading frame (TK0475) encoding an HPS- and PHI-fused protein. The recombinant HPS-PHI-fused enzyme exhibited the expected HPS and PHI activities in both directions (formaldehyde fixing and Ru5P synthesizing). The TK0475 deletion mutant Delta hps-phi-7A did not exhibit any growth in minimal medium, while growth of the mutant strain could be recovered by the addition of nucleosides to the medium. This auxotrophic phenotype together with the catalytic properties of the HPS-PHI-fused enzyme reveal that HPS and PHI are essential for the biosynthesis of Ru5P, the precursor of nucleotides, showing that the RuMP pathway is the only relevant pathway for Ru5P biosynthesis substituting for the classical pentose phosphate pathway missing in this archaeon."
16820476,Identification of genes and proteins necessary for catabolism of acyclic terpenes and leucine/isovalerate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,10.1128/AEM.00853-06,"Geranyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-carboxylase (GCase; AtuC/AtuF) and methylcrotonyl-CoA-carboxylase (MCase; LiuB/LiuD) are characteristic enzymes of the catabolic pathway of acyclic terpenes (citronellol and geraniol) and of saturated methyl-branched compounds, such as leucine or isovalerate, respectively. Proteins encoded by two gene clusters (atuABCDEFGH and liuRABCDE) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 were essential for acyclic terpene utilization (Atu) and for leucine and isovalerate utilization (Liu), respectively, as revealed by phenotype analysis of 10 insertion mutants, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, determination of GCase and MCase activities, and Western blot analysis of wild-type and mutant strains. Analysis of the genome sequences of other pseudomonads (P. putida KT2440 and P. fluorescens Pf-5) revealed candidate genes for Liu proteins for both species and candidate genes for Atu proteins in P. fluorescens. This result concurred with the finding that P. fluorescens, but not P. putida, could grow on acyclic terpenes (citronellol and citronellate), while both species were able to utilize leucine and isovalerate. A regulatory gene, atuR, was identified upstream of atuABCDEFGH and negatively regulated expression of the atu gene cluster."
16823481,Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: moving toward mechanism.,10.1172/JCI29174,"Mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been identified as the major cause of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVC), in which the right ventricle is ""replaced"" by fibrofatty tissue, resulting in lethal arrhythmias. In this issue of the JCI, Garcia-Gras et al. demonstrate that cardiac-specific loss of the desmosomal protein desmoplakin is sufficient to cause nuclear translocation of plakoglobin, upregulation of adipogenic genes in vitro, and a shift from a cardiomyocyte to an adipocyte cell fate in vivo (see the related article beginning on page 2012). This evidence for potential Wnt/beta-catenin signaling defects sets the scene for a comprehensive exploration of the contributions of this pathway to the pathophysiology of ARVC, not only through perturbation of cardiac patterning and development, but also through effects on myocardial differentiation and physiology."
16832053,Yellow flowers generated by expression of the aurone biosynthetic pathway.,10.1073/pnas.0604246103,"Flower color is most often conferred by colored flavonoid pigments. Aurone flavonoids confer a bright yellow color on flowers such as snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) and dahlia (Dahlia variabilis). A. majus aureusidin synthase (AmAS1) was identified as the key enzyme that catalyzes aurone biosynthesis from chalcones, but transgenic flowers overexpressing AmAS1 gene failed to produce aurones. Here, we report that chalcone 4'-O-glucosyltransferase (4'CGT) is essential for aurone biosynthesis and yellow coloration in vivo. Coexpression of the Am4'CGT and AmAS1 genes was sufficient for the accumulation of aureusidin 6-O-glucoside in transgenic flowers (Torenia hybrida). Furthermore, their coexpression combined with down-regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in yellow flowers. An Am4'CGT-GFP chimeric protein localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the AmAS1(N1-60)-RFP chimeric protein was localized to the vacuole. We therefore conclude that chalcones are 4'-O-glucosylated in the cytoplasm, their 4'-O-glucosides transported to the vacuole, and therein enzymatically converted to aurone 6-O-glucosides. This metabolic pathway is unique among the known examples of flavonoid, including anthocyanin biosynthesis because, for all other compounds, the carbon backbone is completed before transport to the vacuole. Our findings herein not only demonstrate the biochemical basis of aurone biosynthesis but also open the way to engineering yellow flowers for major ornamental species lacking this color variant."
16858867,The general transcription machinery and general cofactors.,10.1080/10409230600648736,"In eukaryotes, the core promoter serves as a platform for the assembly of transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) that includes TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase II (pol II), which function collectively to specify the transcription start site. PIC formation usually begins with TFIID binding to the TATA box, initiator, and/or downstream promoter element (DPE) found in most core promoters, followed by the entry of other general transcription factors (GTFs) and pol II through either a sequential assembly or a preassembled pol II holoenzyme pathway. Formation of this promoter-bound complex is sufficient for a basal level of transcription. However, for activator-dependent (or regulated) transcription, general cofactors are often required to transmit regulatory signals between gene-specific activators and the general transcription machinery. Three classes of general cofactors, including TBP-associated factors (TAFs), Mediator, and upstream stimulatory activity (USA)-derived positive cofactors (PC1/PARP-1, PC2, PC3/DNA topoisomerase I, and PC4) and negative cofactor 1 (NC1/HMGB1), normally function independently or in combination to fine-tune the promoter activity in a gene-specific or cell-type-specific manner. In addition, other cofactors, such as TAF1, BTAF1, and negative cofactor 2 (NC2), can also modulate TBP or TFIID binding to the core promoter. In general, these cofactors are capable of repressing basal transcription when activators are absent and stimulating transcription in the presence of activators. Here we review the roles of these cofactors and GTFs, as well as TBP-related factors (TRFs), TAF-containing complexes (TFTC, SAGA, SLIK/SALSA, STAGA, and PRC1) and TAF variants, in pol II-mediated transcription, with emphasis on the events occurring after the chromatin has been remodeled but prior to the formation of the first phosphodiester bond."

The most notorious member of the poxvirus family is variola, the causative agent of smallpox. The laboratory prototype virus used for the study of poxviruses is vaccinia, the virus that was used as a live, naturally attenuated vaccine for the eradication of smallpox. Both the morphogenesis and structure of poxvirus virions are unique among viruses. Poxvirus virions apparently lack any of the symmetry features common to other viruses such as helical or icosahedral capsids or nucleocapsids. Instead poxvirus virions appear as ""brick shaped"" or ""ovoid"" membrane-bound particles with a complex internal structure featuring a walled, biconcave core flanked by ""lateral bodies."" The virion assembly pathway involves a remarkable fabrication of membrane-containing crescents and immature virions, which evolve into mature virions in a process that is unparalleled in virology. As a result of significant advances in poxvirus genetics and molecular biology during the past 15 years, we can now positively identify over 70 specific gene products contained in poxvirus virions, and we can describe the effects of mutations in over 50 specific genes on poxvirus assembly. This review summarizes these advances and attempts to assemble them into a comprehensible and thoughtful picture of poxvirus structure and assembly."
16878994,In vitro evidence for the dual function of Alg2 and Alg11: essential mannosyltransferases in N-linked glycoprotein biosynthesis.,10.1021/bi060878o,"The biosynthesis of asparagine-linked glycoproteins utilizes a dolichylpyrophosphate-linked glycosyl donor (Dol-PP-GlcNAc(2)Man(9)Glc(3)), which is assembled by the series of membrane-bound glycosyltransferases that comprise the dolichol pathway. This biosynthetic pathway is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. While complementary genetic and bioinformatic approaches have enabled identification of most of the dolichol pathway enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the roles of two of the mannosyltransferases in the pathway, Alg2 and Alg11, have remained ambiguous because these enzymes appear to catalyze only two of the remaining four unannotated transformations. To address this issue, a biochemical approach was taken using recombinant Alg2 and Alg11 from S. cerevisiae and defined dolichylpyrophosphate-linked substrates. A cell-membrane fraction isolated from Escherichia coli overexpressing thioredoxin-tagged Alg2 was used to demonstrate that this enzyme actually carries out an alpha1,3-mannosylation, followed by an alpha1,6-mannosylation, to form the first branched pentasaccharide intermediate of the pathway. Then, using thioredoxin-tagged Alg2 for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of the dolichylpyrophosphate pentasaccharide, it was thus possible to define the biochemical function of Alg11, which is to catalyze the next two sequential alpha1,2-mannosylations. The elucidation of the dual function of each of these enzymes thus completes the identification of the entire ensemble of glycosyltransferases that comprise the dolichol pathway."
16890967,Biosynthesis of curcuminoids and gingerols in turmeric (Curcuma longa) and ginger (Zingiber officinale): identification of curcuminoid synthase and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thioesterases.,10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.028,"Members of the Zingiberaceae such as turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) and ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) accumulate at high levels in their rhizomes important pharmacologically active metabolites that appear to be derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. In ginger, these compounds are the gingerols; in turmeric these are the curcuminoids. Despite their importance, little is known about the biosynthesis of these compounds. This investigation describes the identification of enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of these bioactive natural products. Assays for enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway identified the corresponding enzyme activities in protein crude extracts from leaf, shoot and rhizome tissues from ginger and turmeric. These enzymes included phenylalanine ammonia lyase, polyketide synthases, p-coumaroyl shikimate transferase, p-coumaroyl quinate transferase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase, and caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, which were evaluated because of their potential roles in controlling production of certain classes of gingerols and curcuminoids. All crude extracts possessed activity for all of these enzymes, with the exception of polyketide synthases. The results of polyketide synthase assays showed detectable curcuminoid synthase activity in the extracts from turmeric with the highest activity found in extracts from leaves. However, no gingerol synthase activity could be identified. This result was explained by the identification of thioesterase activities that cleaved phenylpropanoid pathway CoA esters, and which were found to be present at high levels in all tissues, especially in ginger tissues. These activities may shunt phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates away from the production of curcuminoids and gingerols, thereby potentially playing a regulatory role in the biosynthesis of these compounds."
16894175,Molecular and functional analysis of nicotinate catabolism in Eubacterium barkeri.,10.1073/pnas.0601635103,"The anaerobic soil bacterium Eubacterium barkeri catabolizes nicotinate to pyruvate and propionate via a unique fermentation. A full molecular characterization of nicotinate fermentation in this organism was accomplished by the following results: (i) A 23.2-kb DNA segment with a gene cluster encoding all nine enzymes was cloned and sequenced, (ii) two chiral intermediates were discovered, and (iii) three enzymes were found, completing the hitherto unknown part of the pathway. Nicotinate dehydrogenase, a (nonselenocysteine) selenium-containing four-subunit enzyme, is encoded by ndhF (FAD subunit), ndhS (2 x [2Fe-2S] subunit), and by the ndhL/ndhM genes. In contrast to all enzymes of the xanthine dehydrogenase family, the latter two encode a two-subunit molybdopterin protein. The 6-hydroxynicotinate reductase, catalyzing reduction of 6-hydroxynicotinate to 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinate, was purified and shown to contain a covalently bound flavin cofactor, one [2Fe-2S](2+/1+) and two [4Fe-4S](2+/1+) clusters. Enamidase, a bifunctional Fe-Zn enzyme belonging to the amidohydrolase family, mediates hydrolysis of 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinate to ammonia and (S)-2-formylglutarate. NADH-dependent reduction of the latter to (S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)glutarate is catalyzed by a member of the 3-hydroxyisobutyrate/phosphogluconate dehydrogenase family. A [4Fe-4S]-containing serine dehydratase-like enzyme is predicted to form 2-methyleneglutarate. After the action of the coenzyme B(12)-dependent 2-methyleneglutarate mutase and 3-methylitaconate isomerase, an aconitase and isocitrate lyase family pair of enzymes, (2R,3S)-dimethylmalate dehydratase and lyase, completes the pathway. Genes corresponding to the first three enzymes of the E. barkeri nicotinate catabolism were identified in nine Proteobacteria."
16895466,DNA double-strand break repair: all's well that ends well.,10.1146/annurev.genet.40.110405.090451,"Breaks in both DNA strands are a particularly dangerous threat to genome stability. At a DNA double-strand break (DSB), potentially lost sequence information cannot be recovered from the same DNA molecule. However, simple repair by joining two broken ends, though inherently error prone, is preferable to leaving ends broken and capable of causing genome rearrangements. To avoid DSB-induced genetic disinformation and disruption of vital processes, such as replication and transcription, cells possess robust mechanisms to repair DSBs. Because all breaks are not created equal, the particular repair mechanism used depends largely on what is possible and needed based on the structure of the broken DNA. We argue that although categorizing different DSB repair mechanisms along pathways and subpathways can be conceptually useful, in cells flexible and reversible interactions among DSB repair factors form a web from which a nonpredetermined path to repair for any number of different DNA breaks will emerge."
16919475,Proteasomes and their associated ATPases: a destructive combination.,10.1016/j.jsb.2006.04.012,"Protein degradation by 20S proteasomes in vivo requires ATP hydrolysis by associated hexameric AAA ATPase complexes such as PAN in archaea and the homologous ATPases in the eukaryotic 26S proteasome. This review discusses recent insights into their multistep mechanisms and the roles of ATP. We have focused on the PAN complex, which offers many advantages for mechanistic and structural studies over the more complex 26S proteasome. By single-particle EM, PAN resembles a ""top-hat"" capping the ends of the 20S proteasome and resembles densities in the base of the 19S regulatory complex. The binding of ATP promotes formation of the PAN-20S complex, which induces opening of a gate for substrate entry into the 20S. PAN's C-termini, containing a conserved motif, docks into pockets in the 20S's alpha ring and causes gate opening. Surprisingly, once substrates are unfolded, their translocation into the 20S requires ATP-binding but not hydrolysis and can occur by facilitated diffusion through the ATPase in its ATP-bound form. ATP therefore serves multiple functions in proteolysis and the only step that absolutely requires ATP hydrolysis is the unfolding of globular proteins. The 26S proteasome appears to function by similar mechanisms."
16939780,Cell and molecular biology of the exosome: how to make or break an RNA.,10.1016/S0074-7696(06)51005-8,"The identification and characterization of the exosome complex has shown that the exosome is a complex of 3' --> 5' exoribonucleases that plays a key role in the processing and degradation of a wide variety of RNA substrates. Advances in the understanding of exosome function have led to the identification of numerous cofactors that are required for a selective recruitment of the exosome to substrate RNAs, for their structural alterations to facilitate degradation, and to aid in their complete degradation/processing. Structural data obtained by two-hybrid interaction analyses and X-ray crystallography show that the core of the exosome adopts a doughnut-like structure and demonstrates that probably not all exosome subunits are active exoribonucleases. Despite all data obtained on the structure and function of the exosome during the last decade, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. What is the molecular mechanism by which cofactors select and target substrate RNAs to the exosome and modulate its function for correct processing or degradation? How can the exosome discriminate between processing or degradation of a specific substrate RNA? What is the precise structure of exosome subunits and how do they contribute to its function? Here we discuss studies that provide some insight to these questions and speculate on the mechanisms that control the exosome."
16945088,Genome-wide analysis of the structural genes regulating defense phenylpropanoid metabolism in Populus.,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01798.x,"Salicin-based phenolic glycosides, hydroxycinnamate derivatives and flavonoid-derived condensed tannins comprise up to one-third of Populus leaf dry mass. Genes regulating the abundance and chemical diversity of these substances have not been comprehensively analysed in tree species exhibiting this metabolically demanding level of phenolic metabolism. Here, shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway genes thought to give rise to these phenolic products were annotated from the Populus genome, their expression assessed by semiquantitative or quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and metabolic evidence for function presented. Unlike Arabidopsis, Populus leaves accumulate an array of hydroxycinnamoyl-quinate esters, which is consistent with broadened function of the expanded hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA transferase gene family. Greater flavonoid pathway diversity is also represented, and flavonoid gene families are larger. Consistent with expanded pathway function, most of these genes were upregulated during wound-stimulated condensed tannin synthesis in leaves. The suite of Populus genes regulating phenylpropanoid product accumulation should have important application in managing phenolic carbon pools in relation to climate change and global carbon cycling."

Of all thyroid cancers, 15-20% are follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), making this the second most common thyroid malignancy (after papillary carcinoma). A proportion of FTC has been found to be associated with a chromosomal translocation, t (2, 3)(q13;p25), which fuses the thyroid-specific transcription factor paired box-8 with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma nuclear receptor, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor. This fusion event causes expression of a paired box-8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma fusion protein (PPFP). PPFP is detected in approximately 30% of FTC. In this report we review data on the role of PPFP in FTC, its mechanism of oncogenesis, and PPFP targeting as a strategy in thyroid cancer treatment."
16957242,Reductive dehalogenase gene expression as a biomarker for physiological activity of Dehalococcoides spp.,10.1128/AEM.01070-06,"This study characterizes the transcriptional expression of the reductive dehalogenase (RDase)-encoding tceA and vcrA genes and evaluates their applicability as potential biological markers of Dehalococcoides activity. When Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195 was provided with trichloroethene (TCE) as the electron acceptor, the expression of the tceA gene increased by 90-fold relative to that in cells starved of chlorinated ethenes, demonstrating that tceA gene expression is indicative of the active physiological state of this strain. In a Dehalococcoides-containing enrichment culture that contains both the tceA and vcrA genes, the tceA gene was up-regulated in response to TCE and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) exposure, while the vcrA gene was up-regulated in response to TCE, cDCE, and vinyl chloride (VC). When chlorinated ethenes were depleted, the RDase-encoding gene transcripts decayed exponentially, with a half-life between 4.8 and 6.1 h, until they reached a stable background level after 2 days. We found that while gene expression correlated generally to the presence of chlorinated ethenes, there was no apparent direct relationship between RDase-encoding transcript numbers and respective rates of TCE, cDCE, and VC dechlorination activities. However, elevated tceA and vcrA expression did correlate with chlorinated-ethene reduction beyond cDCE, suggesting that elevated RDase-encoding transcript numbers could serve as a biomarker for the physiological ability of Dehalococcoides spp. to dechlorinate beyond cDCE."

But how are the many RNA substrates of the exosome degraded in a processive, yet controlled manner? Recent functional and structural progress shows that the exosome is a macromolecular cage, where the nuclease active sites are situated in a central processing chamber. A narrow entry pore controls access to the active sites in the processing chamber and prevents uncontrolled RNA decay. The emerging mechanism of exosome function suggests a strikingly parallel architectural concept to protein degradation by proteasomes."
16971555,Primary immunodeficiency syndromes associated with defective DNA double-strand break repair.,10.1093/bmb/ldl006,"Damaging DNA double-strand breaks (DNA-DSBs) following ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, potentially lead to cell death or carcinogenesis. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the main repair pathway employed by vertebrate cells to repair such damage. Many repair pathway proteins have been identified. The creation of many diverse lymphocyte receptors to identify potential pathogens has evolved by breaking and randomly re-sorting the gene segments coding for antigen receptors. Subsequent DNA-DSB repair utilizes the NHEJ proteins. Individuals with defective repair pathways are increasingly recognized with radiosensitivity and immunodeficiency. Patients with defects in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated, nibrin, MRE11, Rad50, Artemis, DNA ligase IV and Cernunnos-XRCC4-like factor have been identified. Most exhibit immunodeficiency, with a spectrum of presentation and overlap between conditions. Conventional treatment with immunoglobulin replacement or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be effective. A greater understanding of the molecular defect will enable better, tailored therapies to improve survival."
16980423,Degradation of fluorobenzene by Rhizobiales strain F11 via ortho cleavage of 4-fluorocatechol and catechol.,10.1128/AEM.01162-06,"The aerobic metabolism of fluorobenzene by Rhizobiales sp. strain F11 was investigated. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that 4-fluorocatechol and catechol were formed as intermediates during fluorobenzene degradation by cell suspensions. Both these compounds, unlike 3-fluorocatechol, supported growth and oxygen uptake. Cells grown on fluorobenzene contained enzymes for the ortho pathway but not for meta ring cleavage of catechols. The results suggest that fluorobenzene is predominantly degraded via 4-fluorocatechol with subsequent ortho cleavage and also partially via catechol."
1698764,Possible evolutionary relationships between streptomycin and bluensomycin biosynthetic pathways: detection of novel inositol kinase and O-carbamoyltransferase activities.,10.1128/jb.172.10.5844-5851.1990,"Bluensomycin (glebomycin) is an aminocyclitol antibiotic that differs structurally from dihydrostreptomycin in having bluensidine (1D-1-O-carbamoyl-3-guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol) rather than streptidine (1,3-diguanidino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol) as its aminocyclitol moiety. Extracts of the bluensomycin producer Streptomyces hygroscopicus form glebosus ATCC 14607 (S. glebosus) were found to have aminodeoxy-scyllo-inositol kinase activity but to lack 1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol kinase activity, showing for the first time that these two reactions in streptomycin producers must be catalyzed by different enzymes. S. glebosus extracts therefore possess the same five enzymes required for synthesis of guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol from myo-inositol that are found in streptomycin producers but lack the next three of the four enzymes found in streptomycin producers that are required to synthesize the second guanidino group of streptidine-P. In place of a second guanidino group, S. glebosus extracts were found to catalyze a Mg2(+)-dependent carbamoylation of guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol to form bluensidine, followed by a phosphorylation to form bluensidine-P. The novel carbamoyl-P:guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol O-carbamoyltransferase and ATP:bluensidine phosphotransferase activities were not detected in streptomycin producers or in S. glebosus during its early rapid growth phase. Free bluensidine appears to be a normal intermediate in bluensomycin biosynthesis, in contrast to the case of streptomycin biosynthesis; in the latter, although exogenous streptidine can enter the pathway via streptidine-P, free streptidine is not an intermediate in the endogenous biosynthetic pathway. Comparison of the streptomycin and bluensomycin biosynthetic pathways provides a unique opportunity to evaluate those proposed mechanisms for the evolutionary acquisition of new biosynthetic capabilities that involve gene duplication and subsequent mutational changes in one member of the pair. In this model, there are at least five pairs of enzymes catalyzing analogous reactions that can be analyzed for homology at both the protein and DNA levels, including two putative pairs of inositol kinases detected in this study."
17003031,Novel benzene ring biosynthesis from C(3) and C(4) primary metabolites by two enzymes.,10.1074/jbc.M608103200,"The shikimate pathway, including seven enzymatic steps for production of chorismate via shikimate from phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, is common in various organisms for the biosynthesis of not only aromatic amino acids but also most biogenic benzene derivatives. 3-Amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) is a benzene derivative serving as a precursor for several secondary metabolites produced by Streptomyces, including grixazone produced by Streptomyces griseus. Our study on the biosynthesis pathway of grixazone led to identification of the biosynthesis pathway of 3,4-AHBA from two primary metabolites. Two genes, griI and griH, within the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster were found to be responsible for the biosynthesis of 3,4-AHBA; the two genes conferred the in vivo production of 3,4-AHBA even on Escherichia coli. In vitro analysis showed that GriI catalyzed aldol condensation between two primary metabolites, l-aspartate-4-semialdehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, to form a 7-carbon product, 2-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-6-one-heptanoic acid-7-phosphate, which was subsequently converted to 3,4-AHBA by GriH. The latter reaction required Mn(2+) ion but not any cofactors involved in reduction or oxidation. This pathway is independent of the shikimate pathway, representing a novel, simple enzyme system responsible for the synthesis of a benzene ring from the C(3) and C(4) primary metabolites."

The peroxisomal disorders identified to date are usually classified in two groups including: (1) the disorders of peroxisome biogenesis, and (2) the single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies. This review is focused on the second group of disorders, which currently includes ten different diseases in which the mutant gene affects a protein involved in one of the following peroxisomal functions: (1) ether phospholipid (plasmalogen) biosynthesis; (2) fatty acid beta-oxidation; (3) peroxisomal alpha-oxidation; (4) glyoxylate detoxification, and (5) H2O2 metabolism."
17055079,Peroxisome biogenesis disorders.,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.09.010,"Defects in PEX genes impair peroxisome assembly and multiple metabolic pathways confined to this organelle, thus providing the biochemical and molecular bases of the peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD). PBD are divided into two types--Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS) and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP). Biochemical studies performed in blood and urine are used to screen for the PBD. DNA testing is possible for all of the disorders, but is more challenging for the ZSS since 12 PEX genes are known to be associated with this spectrum of PBD. In contrast, PBD-RCDP is associated with defects in the PEX7 gene alone. Studies of the cellular and molecular defects in PBD patients have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of each PEX gene in peroxisome assembly."
17062755,Roles of Arabidopsis ATP/ADP isopentenyltransferases and tRNA isopentenyltransferases in cytokinin biosynthesis.,10.1073/pnas.0603522103,"Cytokinins, which are central regulators of cell division and differentiation in plants, are adenine derivatives carrying an isopentenyl side chain that may be hydroxylated. Plants have two classes of isopentenyltransferases (IPTs) acting on the adenine moiety: ATP/ADP isopentenyltransferases (in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtIPT1, 3, 4-8) and tRNA IPTs (in Arabidopsis, AtIPT2 and 9). ATP/ADP IPTs are likely to be responsible for the bulk of cytokinin synthesis, whereas it is thought that cis-zeatin (cZ)-type cytokinins are produced possibly by degradation of cis-hydroxy isopentenyl tRNAs, which are formed by tRNA IPTs. However, these routes are largely hypothetical because of lack of in vivo evidence, because the critical experiment necessary to verify these routes, namely the production and analysis of mutants lacking AtIPTs, has not yet been described. We isolated null mutants for all members of the ATP/ADP IPT and tRNA IPT gene families in Arabidopsis. Notably, our work demonstrates that the atipt1 3 5 7 quadruple mutant possesses severely decreased levels of isopentenyladenine and trans-zeatin (tZ), and their corresponding ribosides, ribotides, and glucosides, and is retarded in its growth. In contrast, these mutants possessed increased levels of cZ-type cytokinins. The atipt2 9 double mutant, on the other hand, lacked isopentenyl- and cis-hydroxy isopentenyl-tRNA, and cZ-type cytokinins. These results indicate that whereas ATP/ADP IPTs are responsible for the bulk of isopentenyladenine- and tZ-type cytokinin synthesis, tRNA IPTs are required for cZ-type cytokinin production. This work clarifies the long-standing questions of the biosynthetic routes for isopentenyladenine-, tZ-, and cZ-type cytokinin production."

17102630,Regulation of Hh/Gli signaling by dual ubiquitin pathways.,10.4161/cc.5.21.3406,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway governs cell growth and patterning in animal development. Malfunction of several pathway components, including the key transcriptional effector Ci/Gli proteins, leads to a variety of human disorders including several malignancies. Ci/Gli activity is controlled by multi-layered regulatory mechanisms, the most prominent of which is the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. In the absence of Hh, Ci/Gli is proteolytically processed into a truncated form that functions as a transcriptional repressor of the Hh pathway. Ci processing is mediated by an SCF (Skip1/Cul1/F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase in which the F-box protein Slimb/beta-TRCP bridges Ci to the ubiquitin ligase. Recent studies in Drosophila and mammalian cultured cells have demonstrated that sequential phosphorylation of Ci/Gli by PKA, GSK3, and CKI creates multiple docking sites that can recruit SCF(Slimb/beta-TRCP), which then promotes Ci/Gli ubiquitination followed by proteasome-mediated processing. Recently, an E3 ubiquitin ligase consisting of the BTB (Broad Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric a Brac) protein HIB (Hh induced MATH and BTB protein) and Cullin 3 (Cul3) has been identified that acts in a negative feedback loop to fine-tune Hh signaling responses by degrading full length Ci. In eye imaginal discs where Hh signals coordinate cell proliferation and differentiation, HIB is highly expressed in the differentiating cells to prevent aberrant Hh signaling activity and ensure normal eye development. Tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of HIB and its homologs in vertebrates may provide a conserved mechanism for ensuring precision in spatial and temporal control of Hh signaling."

The enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways for the production of two of these molecules, prodigiosin and undecylprodigiosin, are now known. However, the biochemistry of some of the reactions is still poorly understood. The physiology and regulation of prodiginine production in Serratia and Streptomyces are now well understood, although the biological role of these pigments in the producer organisms remains unclear. However, research into the biology of pigment production will stimulate interest in the bioengineering of strains to synthesize useful prodiginine derivatives."

17138693,C-23 hydroxylation by Arabidopsis CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 reveals a novel shortcut in brassinosteroid biosynthesis.,10.1105/tpc.106.045443,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are biosynthesized from campesterol via several cytochrome P450 (P450)-catalyzed oxidative reactions. We report the functional characterization of two BR-biosynthetic P450s from Arabidopsis thaliana: CYP90C1/ROTUNDIFOLIA3 and CYP90D1. The cyp90c1 cyp90d1 double mutant exhibits the characteristic BR-deficient dwarf phenotype, although the individual mutants do not display this phenotype. These data suggest redundant roles for these P450s. In vitro biochemical assays using insect cell-expressed proteins revealed that both CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of various 22-hydroxylated BRs with markedly different catalytic efficiencies. Both enzymes preferentially convert 3-epi-6-deoxocathasterone, (22S,24R)-22-hydroxy-5alpha-ergostan-3-one, and (22S,24R)-22-hydroxyergost-4-en-3-one to 23-hydroxylated products, whereas they are less active on 6-deoxocathasterone. Likewise, cyp90c1 cyp90d1 plants were deficient in 23-hydroxylated BRs, and in feeding experiments using exogenously supplied intermediates, only 23-hydroxylated BRs rescued the growth deficiency of the cyp90c1 cyp90d1 mutant. Thus, CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 are redundant BR C-23 hydroxylases. Moreover, their preferential substrates are present in the endogenous Arabidopsis BR pool. Based on these results, we propose C-23 hydroxylation shortcuts that bypass campestanol, 6-deoxocathasterone, and 6-deoxoteasterone and lead directly from (22S,24R)-22-hydroxy-5alpha-ergostan-3-one and 3-epi-6-deoxocathasterone to 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone and 6-deoxotyphasterol."
17142386,Family shuffling of soil DNA to change the regiospecificity of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 biphenyl dioxygenase.,10.1128/JB.01267-06,"Previous work has shown that the C-terminal portion of BphA, especially two amino acid segments designated region III and region IV, influence the regiospecificity of the biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO) toward 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl (2,2'-CB). In this work, we evolved BPDO by shuffling bphA genes amplified from polychlorinated biphenyl-contaminated soil DNA. Sets of approximately 1-kb DNA fragments were amplified with degenerate primers designed to amplify the C-terminal portion of bphA. These fragments were shuffled, and the resulting library was used to replace the corresponding fragment of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 bphA. Variants were screened for their ability to oxygenate 2,2'-CB onto carbons 5 and 6, which are positions that LB400 BPDO is unable to attack. Variants S100, S149, and S151 were obtained and exhibited this feature. Variant S100 BPDO produced exclusively cis-5,6-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl from 2,2'-CB. Moreover, unlike LB400 BPDO, S100 BphA catalyzed the oxygenation of 2,2',3,3'-tetrachlorobiphenyl onto carbons 5 and 6 exclusively and it was unable to oxygenate 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl. Based on oxygen consumption measurements, variant S100 oxygenated 2,2'-CB at a rate of 16 +/- 1 nmol min(-1) per nmol enzyme, which was similar to the value observed for LB400 BPDO. cis-5,6-Dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl was further oxidized by 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dehydrogenase (BphB) and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (BphC). Variant S100 was, in addition, able to oxygenate benzene, toluene, and ethyl benzene. Sequence analysis identified amino acid residues M237 S238 and S283 outside regions III and IV that influence the activity toward doubly ortho-substituted chlorobiphenyls."

17172287,Functional diversification of acyl-coenzyme A oxidases in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and action.,10.1104/pp.106.092916,"The biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) in plant peroxisomes requires the action of acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (ACX). Among the five expressed members (ACX1-5) of the ACX gene family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), only ACX1 is known to serve a role in JA production. Here, we used transgenic promoter-reporter lines to show that ACX1 is highly expressed in mature and germinating pollen, stem epidermal cells, and other tissues in which jasmonate-signaled processes occur. Wound-induced JA accumulation was reduced in a mutant that is defective in ACX1 and was abolished in a mutant that is impaired in both ACX1 and its closely related paralog, ACX5. The severe JA deficiency in acx1/5 double mutants was accompanied by decreased resistance to the leaf-eating insect Trichoplusia ni. The double mutant also showed reduced pollen viability and fecundity. Treatment of acx1/5 plants with JA restored both protection against T. ni larvae and normal seed set. Unexpectedly, acx1/5 plants accumulated JA in response to infection by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola. In contrast to mutants that are impaired in jasmonate perception or early steps of the JA biosynthetic pathway, acx1/5 plants maintained resistance to A. brassicicola infection. These results indicate that ACX1/5-mediated JA synthesis is essential for resistance to chewing insects and male reproductive function and further suggest that other ACX isozymes contribute to JA production in response to A. brassicicola challenge. Thus, different types of biotic stress may induce JA synthesis via distinct enzymatic routes."
17181781,The small nucleoid protein Fis is involved in Vibrio cholerae quorum sensing.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05545.x,"Quorum sensing is a process of cell-cell communication that bacteria use to relay information to one another about the cell density and species composition of the bacterial community. Quorum sensing involves the production, secretion and population-wide detection of small signalling molecules called autoinducers. This process allows bacteria to synchronize group behaviours and act as multicellular units. The human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, uses quorum sensing to co-ordinate such complex behaviours as pathogenicity and biofilm formation. The quorum-sensing circuit of V. cholerae consists of two autoinducer/sensor systems, CAI-1/CqsS and AI-2/LuxPQ, and the VarS/A-CsrA/BCD growth-phase regulatory system. Genetic analysis suggests that an additional regulatory arm involved in quorum sensing exists in V. cholerae. All of these systems channel information into the histidine phosphotransfer protein, LuxU, and/or the response regulator, LuxO. LuxO, when phosphorylated, activates the expression of four genes encoding the Qrr (quorum regulatory RNAs) small RNAs (sRNAs). The Qrr sRNAs destabilize the hapR transcript encoding the master regulator of quorum sensing, HapR. Here we identify the nucleoid protein Fis as playing a major role in the V. cholerae quorum-sensing circuit. Fis fulfils the predictions required to be the putative additional component that inputs information into the cascade: its expression is regulated in a growth phase-dependent manner; it requires LuxO but acts independently of LuxU, and it regulates all four qrr genes and, in turn, HapR by directly binding to the qrr gene promoters and modulating their expression."
17182536,Roundtrip ticket for secretory IgA: role in mucosal homeostasis?,10.4049/jimmunol.178.1.27,"An important activity of mucosal surfaces is the production of Ab referred to as secretory IgA (SIgA). SIgA serves as the first line of defense against microorganisms through a mechanism called immune exclusion. In addition, SIgA adheres selectively to M cells in intestinal Peyer's patches, thus mediating the transepithelial transport of the Ab molecule from the intestinal lumen to underlying gut-associated organized lymphoid tissue. In Peyer's patches, SIgA binds and is internalized by dendritic cells in the subepithelial dome region. When used as carrier for Ags in oral immunization, SIgA induces mucosal and systemic responses associated with production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and limits activation of dendritic cells. In terms of humoral immunity at mucosal surfaces, SIgA appears thus to combine properties of a neutralizing agent (immune exclusion) and of a mucosal immunopotentiator inducing effector immune responses in a noninflammatory context favorable to preserve local homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract."
17183357,P bodies: at the crossroads of post-transcriptional pathways.,10.1038/nrm2080,"Post-transcriptional processes have a central role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Although it has been known for a long time that these processes are functionally linked, often by the use of common protein factors, it has only recently become apparent that many of these processes are also physically connected. Indeed, proteins that are involved in mRNA degradation, translational repression, mRNA surveillance and RNA-mediated gene silencing, together with their mRNA targets, colocalize within discrete cytoplasmic domains known as P bodies. The available evidence indicates that P bodies are sites where mRNAs that are not being translated accumulate, the information carried by associated proteins and regulatory RNAs is integrated, and their fate - either translation, silencing or decay - is decided."

Using cDNA subtraction techniques, we isolated a gene, denoted phacB, which is strongly induced by PhAc (and its hydroxyderivatives) and encodes a new cytochrome P450 (CYP450). A disrupted phacB strain (delta phacB) does not grow on 3-hydroxy-, 4-hydroxy-, or 3,4-dihydroxy-PhAc. High-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrum analyses of in vitro reactions using microsomes from wild-type and several A. nidulans mutant strains confirmed that the phacB-encoded CYP450 catalyzes 3-hydroxyphenylacetate and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate 6-hydroxylations to generate 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate and 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylacetate, respectively. Both of these compounds are used as substrates by homogentisate dioxygenase. This cytochrome P450 protein also uses PhAc as a substrate to generate 2-OH-PhAc with a very low efficiency. The phacB gene is the first member of a new CYP450 subfamily (CYP504B)."
17192582,The role of stress in the clinical expression of thyroid autoimmunity.,10.1196/annals.1366.015,"During stress, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathoadrenal system leads to increased secretion of glucocorticoids and catecholamines, respectively, in order to maintain homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests that stress hormones, acting on antigen-presenting immune cells, may influence the differentiation of bipotential T helper (Th) cells away from Th1 and toward a Th2 phenotype. This results in suppression of cellular immunity and potentiation of humoral immunity. Thyroid autoimmunity is clinically expressed as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and its variants (sporadic or postpartum thyroiditis) or as Grave's disease (GD). The different phenotypic expression of thyroid autoimmunity is largely dependent on the balance of Th1 versus Th2 immune response. A predominantly Th1-mediated immune activity may promote apoptotic pathways on thyroid follicular cells leading to thyroid cell destruction and HT. Conversely, predominance of Th2-mediated immune response may induce antigen-specific B lymphocytes to produce anti-TSH receptor (TSHr) antibodies causing GD. The weight of evidence from epidemiological and case-control studies supports an association between stress and GD. On the other hand, there is little information available on the effect of stress on HT, but there is evidence for an increase in postpartum thyroiditis, following the cellular immune suppressive effect of pregnancy. Whether stress has a causative effect on GD remains elusive. Circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that stress may influence the clinical expression of thyroid autoimmunity in susceptible individuals favoring the development of GD by shifting the Th1-Th2 balance away for Th1 and toward Th2. Conversely, recovery from stress or the immune suppressive effect of pregnancy may induce a Th2 to Th1 ""return shift"" leading to autoimmune (sporadic) or postpartum thyroiditis, respectively."
17215350,Arabidopsis systemic immunity uses conserved defense signaling pathways and is mediated by jasmonates.,10.1073/pnas.0605423104,"In the absence of adaptive immunity displayed by animals, plants respond locally to biotic challenge via inducible basal defense networks activated through recognition and response to conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In addition, immunity can be induced in tissues remote from infection sites by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), initiated after gene-for-gene recognition between plant resistance proteins and microbial effectors. The nature of the mobile signal and remotely activated networks responsible for establishing SAR remain unclear. Salicylic acid (SA) participates in the local and systemic response, but SAR does not require long-distance translocation of SA. Here, we show that, despite the absence of pathogen-associated molecular pattern contact, systemically responding leaves rapidly activate a SAR transcriptional signature with strong similarity to local basal defense. We present several lines of evidence that suggest jasmonates are central to systemic defense, possibly acting as the initiating signal for classic SAR. Jasmonic acid (JA), but not SA, rapidly accumulates in phloem exudates of leaves challenged with an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae. In systemically responding leaves, transcripts associated with jasmonate biosynthesis are up-regulated within 4 h, and JA increases transiently. SAR can be mimicked by foliar JA application and is abrogated in mutants impaired in jasmonate synthesis or response. We conclude that jasmonate signaling appears to mediate long-distance information transmission. Moreover, the systemic transcriptional response shares extraordinary overlap with local herbivory and wounding responses, indicating that jasmonates may be pivotal to an evolutionarily conserved signaling network that decodes multiple abiotic and biotic stress signals."
17222174,"Vitamin C. Biosynthesis, recycling and degradation in mammals.",10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05607.x,"Vitamin C, a reducing agent and antioxidant, is a cofactor in reactions catalyzed by Cu(+)-dependent monooxygenases and Fe(2+)-dependent dioxygenases. It is synthesized, in vertebrates having this capacity, from d-glucuronate. The latter is formed through direct hydrolysis of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronate by enzyme(s) bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, sharing many properties with, and most likely identical to, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Non-glucuronidable xenobiotics (aminopyrine, metyrapone, chloretone and others) stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of UDP-glucuronate, accounting for their effect to increase vitamin C formation in vivo. Glucuronate is converted to l-gulonate by aldehyde reductase, an enzyme of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. l-Gulonate is converted to l-gulonolactone by a lactonase identified as SMP30 or regucalcin, whose absence in mice leads to vitamin C deficiency. The last step in the pathway of vitamin C synthesis is the oxidation of l-gulonolactone to l-ascorbic acid by l-gulonolactone oxidase, an enzyme associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and deficient in man, guinea pig and other species due to mutations in its gene. Another fate of glucuronate is its conversion to d-xylulose in a five-step pathway, the pentose pathway, involving identified oxidoreductases and an unknown decarboxylase. Semidehydroascorbate, a major oxidation product of vitamin C, is reconverted to ascorbate in the cytosol by cytochrome b(5) reductase and thioredoxin reductase in reactions involving NADH and NADPH, respectively. Transmembrane electron transfer systems using ascorbate or NADH as electron donors serve to reduce semidehydroascorbate present in neuroendocrine secretory vesicles and in the extracellular medium. Dehydroascorbate, the fully oxidized form of vitamin C, is reduced spontaneously by glutathione, as well as enzymatically in reactions using glutathione or NADPH. The degradation of vitamin C in mammals is initiated by the hydrolysis of dehydroascorbate to 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate, which is spontaneously degraded to oxalate, CO(2) and l-erythrulose. This is at variance with bacteria such as Escherichia coli, which have enzymatic degradation pathways for ascorbate and probably also dehydroascorbate."
17226502,On the botanical distribution of chiral forms of gossypol.,10.1055/s-2006-961512,"Plants belonging to Malvaceae (about 90 species belonging to 33 genera) were analysed for the presence of gossypol by reversed-phase HPLC using absorbance detection at 365 nm, and the chirality and optical purity of gossypol were determined whenever the analysis was positive. Only plants belonging to the cotton tribe (Gossypieae) contained gossypol (detection limit better than 0.001%). In particular, no gossypol could be detected in ABELMOSCHUS ESCULENTUS (ocra), HIBISCUS TILIACEUS, H. SABDARIFFA, and HEREA BRASI-LIENSIS, earlier claimed to contain this compound. Gossypol-containing plants usually produced dextrorotatory gossypol of varying optical purity; an enantiomeric excess of (-)-gossypol was detected in only one plant, GOSSYPIUTN BARBADENSE."
17245426,LAMP proteins are required for fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes.,10.1038/sj.emboj.7601511,"Lysosome-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) are delivered to phagosomes during the maturation process. We used cells from LAMP-deficient mice to analyze the role of these proteins in phagosome maturation. Macrophages from LAMP-1- or LAMP-2-deficient mice displayed normal fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes. Because ablation of both the lamp-1 and lamp-2 genes yields an embryonic-lethal phenotype, we were unable to study macrophages from double knockouts. Instead, we reconstituted phagocytosis in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by transfection of FcgammaIIA receptors. Phagosomes formed by FcgammaIIA-transfected MEFs obtained from LAMP-1- or LAMP-2- deficient mice acquired lysosomal markers. Remarkably, although FcgammaIIA-transfected MEFs from double-deficient mice ingested particles normally, phagosomal maturation was arrested. LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 double-deficient phagosomes acquired Rab5 and accumulated phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, but failed to recruit Rab7 and did not fuse with lysosomes. We attribute the deficiency to impaired organellar motility along microtubules. Time-lapse cinematography revealed that late endosomes/lysosomes as well as phagosomes lacking LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 had reduced ability to move toward the microtubule-organizing center, likely precluding their interaction with each other."

Heynh. that accumulated less anthocyanin in the plant tissues, but had seeds with a brown color similar to the wild-type. These mutants were allelic with the anthocyaninless1 (anl1) mutant that has been mapped at 15.0 cM of chromosome 5. We performed fine mapping of the anl1 locus and determined that ANL1 is located between the nga106 marker and a marker corresponding to the MKP11 clone. About 70 genes are located between these two markers, including three UDP-glucose:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase-like genes and a glutathione transferase gene (TT19). A mutant of one of the glucosyltransferase genes (At5g17050) was unable to complement the anl1 phenotype, showing that the ANL1 gene encodes UDP-glucose:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase. ANL1 was expressed in all tissues examined, including rosette leaves, stems, flower buds and roots. ANL1 was not regulated by TTG1."
17298394,Paxillin phosphorylation: bifurcation point downstream of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in streptococcal invasion.,10.1111/j.1462-5822.2007.00889.x,"Efficient group A streptococcus (GAS) invasion of mammalian cells requires fibronectin (Fn) binding proteins, such as M1 and PrtF1/SfbI, that bridge bacteria to integrins and activate cellular signalling for ingestion. Previous studies of GAS invasion, mediated by both proteins, suggest a common signalling pathway. However, distinct cellular morphological changes at the port of bacterial entry suggest that different signals are also induced. Here we report that paxillin is phosphorylated in response to Fn-bound GAS that express either M1 or PrtF1/SfbI protein, but is not phosphorylated in response to a mutant deficient in both proteins. Inhibition of paxillin phosphorylation by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, or by expression of a dominant negative form of paxillin significantly reduced invasion by M1+ but did not affect ingestion of PrtF1/SfbI+ strains. In contrast, another tyrosine inhibitor, genistein, did not significantly prevent paxillin phosphorylation and had no effect on ingestion of the M1+ strain, but reduced PrtF1/SfbI-mediated entry. This suggests that paxillin phosphorylation is induced by both proteins but only required for M1-mediated invasion. A bifurcation point, downstream of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, likely accounts for the distinct morphological changes. Furthermore, ILK activity is indispensable for M1-induced paxillin recruitment and phosphorylation."
17323080,Cuticular wax biosynthesis in petunia petals: cloning and characterization of an alcohol-acyltransferase that synthesizes wax-esters.,10.1007/s00425-007-0489-z,"The surface of plants is covered by cuticular wax, which contains a mixture of very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) derivatives. This wax surface provides a hydrophobic barrier which reduces non-stomatal water loss. One component of the cuticular wax is the alkyl esters, which typically contain a VLCFA esterified to an alcohol of a similar length. As part of an EST project, we recently identified an acyltransferase with 19% sequence identity (amino acid) to a bacterial 'bifunctional' wax-ester synthase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT). Northern analysis revealed that this petunia homologue was expressed predominantly within the petals. The cDNA encoding the WS/DGAT homologue was introduced into a yeast strain deficient in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The expressed protein failed to restore triacylglycerol biosynthesis, indicating that it lacked DGAT activity. However, isoamyl esters of fatty acids were detected, which suggested that the petunia cDNA encoded a wax-synthase. Waxes were extracted from petunia petals and leaves. The petal wax extract was rich in VLCFA esters of methyl, isoamyl, and short-to-medium straight chain alcohols (C4-C12). These low molecular weight wax-esters were not present in leaf wax. In-vitro enzymes assays were performed using the heterologously expressed protein and 14C-labelled substrates. The expressed protein was membrane bound, and displayed a preference for medium chain alcohols and saturated very long-chain acyl-CoAs. In fact, the activity would be sufficient to produce most of the low molecular wax-esters present in petals, with methyl-esters being the exception. This work is the first characterization of a eukaryotic protein from the WS/DGAT family."
17346171,Enzymes in the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids.,10.2174/156652407780059168,"This article aims to give an overview on the characterization, properties and regulation of enzymes, particularly the cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes, in the formation of bile acids from cholesterol. Bile acids are biologically active molecules that promote absorption of dietary lipids in the intestine and stimulate biliary excretion of cholesterol. Bile acids and oxysterols, formed from cholesterol, act as ligands to nuclear receptors regulating the expression of important genes in cholesterol homeostasis. Thus, the bioactivation of cholesterol into bile acids is crucial for regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. The primary human bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are formed from cholesterol via several pathways involving many different enzymes. Many of these enzymes are cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, introducing a hydroxyl group in the molecule. The ""classic"" pathway of bile acid formation starts with a 7alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol by CYP7A1 in the liver. The ""acidic"" pathway starts with a hepatic or extrahepatic 27-hydroxylation by CYP27A1. There also exist some quantitatively minor pathways which may be of importance under certain conditions. Formation of cholic acid requires insertion of a 12alpha-hydroxyl group performed by CYP8B1. Oxysterols are precursors to bile acids, participate in cholesterol transport and are known to affect the expression of several genes in cholesterol homeostasis. Enzymes with capacity to form and metabolize oxysterols are present in liver and extrahepatic tissues. The enzymes, nuclear receptors and transcription factors involved in bile acid biosynthesis are potential pharmaceutical targets for the development of new drugs to control hypercholesterolemia and to prevent atherosclerosis and other diseases related to disturbed cholesterol homeostasis. The review will also discuss some inborn errors of bile acid biosynthesis and the recently acquired knowledge on the genetic defects underlying these diseases."

17428785,Defining paxilline biosynthesis in Penicillium paxilli: functional characterization of two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases.,10.1074/jbc.M701626200,"Indole diterpenes are a large, structurally and functionally diverse group of secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi. Biosynthetic schemes have been proposed for these metabolites but until recently none of the proposed steps had been validated by biochemical or genetic studies. Using Penicillium paxilli as a model experimental system to study indole diterpene biosynthesis we previously showed by deletion analysis that a cluster of seven genes is required for paxilline biosynthesis. Two of these pax genes, paxP and paxQ (encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases), are required in the later steps in this pathway. Here, we describe the function of paxP and paxQ gene products by feeding proposed paxilline intermediates to strains lacking the pax cluster but containing ectopically integrated copies of paxP or paxQ. Transformants containing paxP converted paspaline into 13-desoxypaxilline as the major product and beta-PC-M6 as the minor product. beta-PC-M6, but not alpha-PC-M6, was also a substrate for PaxP and was converted to 13-desoxypaxilline. paxQ-containing transformants converted 13-desoxypaxilline into paxilline. These results confirm that paspaline, beta-PC-M6, and 13-desoxypaxilline are paxilline intermediates and that paspaline and beta-PC-M6 are substrates for PaxP, and 13-desoxypaxilline is a substrate for PaxQ. PaxP and PaxQ also utilized beta-paxitriol and alpha-PC-M6 as substrates converting them to paxilline and alpha-paxitriol, respectively. These findings have allowed us to delineate clearly the biosynthetic pathway for paxilline for the first time."
17447862,The RNA degradosome of Escherichia coli: an mRNA-degrading machine assembled on RNase E.,10.1146/annurev.micro.61.080706.093440,"The RNA degradosome of Escherichia coli is a multiprotein complex involved in the degradation of mRNA. The principal components are RNase E, PNPase, RhlB, and enolase. RNase E is a large multidomain protein with an N-terminal catalytic region and a C-terminal noncatalytic region that is mostly natively unstructured protein. The noncatalytic region contains sites for binding RNA and for protein-protein interactions with other components of the RNA degradosome. Several recent studies suggest that there are alternative forms of the RNA degradosome depending on growth conditions or other factors. These alternative forms appear to modulate RNase E activity in the degradation of mRNA. RNA degradosome-like complexes appear to be conserved throughout the Proteobacteria, but there is a surprising variability in composition that might contribute to the adaptation of these bacteria to the enormously wide variety of niches in which they live."

The beta- and gamma-lyase activities toward selenomethionine (SeMet) and Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys), respectively, were compared under exactly identical conditions by incubating 77Se-SeMet and 76Se-MeSeCys simultaneously in a liver supernatant, and then estimated by the decreases in the labeled starting selenoamino acids (MeSeCys and SeMet), and also by the increases in the labeled enzyme products (methylselenol and selenide) after oxidation to methylseleninic acid (MSA(IV)) and selenite, respectively, by HPLC-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Only 76Se-MeSeCys was decreased and only 76Se-selenite was produced, suggesting that conversion of MeSeCys to methylselenol by beta-lyase followed by that of methylselenol to selenide by demethylase actively occurred in the liver supernatant. The demethylase activity was characterized by incubating 77Se-methylselenol produced in situ from 77Se-MSA(IV) and glutathione in a partially purified enzyme preparation. It was found that demethylation takes place directly through an attack by a hydroxide anion on the methyl group of methylselenol producing selenide and methanol, selenide being detected on HPLC-ICP-MS after oxidation to selenite, and methanol on GC-MS. It was concluded that beta- but not gamma-lyase activity could be detected in a liver supernatant, and that the resulting methylselenol product is demethylated through hydrolysis, with methanol and selenide being produced (MeSeCys-->CH3SeH-->HSeH + CH3OH)."
17459698,Endogenous inhibitors (GALFs) of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoforms 1 and 2: derivatives of adrenally produced corticosterone and cortisol.,10.1016/j.jsbmb.2007.03.020,"Two isoforms of 11beta-HSD exist; 11beta-HSD1 is bi-directional (the reductase usually being predominant) and 11beta-HSD2 functions as a dehydrogenase, conferring kidney mineralocorticoid specificity. We have previously described endogenous substances in human urine, ""glycyrrhetinic acid-like factors (GALFs)"", which like licorice, inhibit the bi-directional 11beta-HSD1 enzyme as well as the dehydrogenase reaction of 11beta-HSD2. Many of the more potent GALFs are derived from two major families of adrenal steroids, corticosterone and cortisol. For example, 3alpha5alpha-tetrahydro-corticosterone, its derivative, 3alpha5alpha-tetrahydro-11beta-hydroxy-progesterone (produced by 21-deoxygenation of corticosterone in intestinal flora); 3alpha5alpha-tetrahydro-11beta-hydroxy-testosterone (produced by side chain cleavage of cortisol); are potent inhibitors of 11beta-HSD1 and 11beta-HSD2-dehydrogenase, with IC50's in range 0.26-3.0 microM, whereas their 11-keto-3alpha5alpha-tetrahydro-derivatives inhibit 11beta-HSD1 reductase, with IC50's in range 0.7-0.8 microM (their 3alpha5beta-derivatives being completely inactive). Inhibitors of 11beta-HSD2 increase local cortisol levels, permitting it to act as a mineralocorticoid in kidney. Inhibitors of 11beta-HSD1 dehydrogenase/11beta-HSD1 reductase serve to adjust the set point of local deactivation/reactivation of cortisol in vascular and other glucocorticoid target tissues, including adipose, vascular, adrenal tissue, and the eye. These adrenally derived 11-oxygenated C21- and C19 -steroidal substances may serve as 11beta-HSD1- or 11beta-HSD2-GALFs. We conclude that adrenally derived products are likely regulators of local cortisol bioactivity in humans."

In characterizing recombinant VTC2 from A. thaliana as a specific GDP-L-galactose/GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase, we conclude that enzymes catalyzing each of the ten steps of the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway from glucose to ascorbate have been identified. Finally, we identify VTC2 homologs in plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, suggesting that a similar reaction is used widely in nature."

In this study, we characterized a rat aldo-keto reductase (AKR1C17), whose functions are unknown. The recombinant AKR1C17 efficiently oxidized 3alpha-hydroxysteroids and bile acids using NAD(+) as the preferred coenzyme at an optimal pH of 7.4-9.5, and was inhibited by ketamine and organic anions. The mRNA for AKR1C17 was detected specifically in rat kidney, where the enzyme was more highly expressed as a cytosolic protein than NADP(H)-dependent 3alpha-HSD (AKR1C9). Thus, AKR1C17 represents a novel NAD(+)-dependent type of cytosolic 3alpha-HSD with unique inhibitor sensitivity and tissue distribution. In addition, the replacement of Gln270 and Glu276 of AKR1C17 with the corresponding residues of NADP(H)-dependent 3alpha-HSD resulted in a switch in favor of NADP(+) specificity, suggesting their key roles in coenzyme specificity."

A functionally homologous repair apparatus, composed of Ku and a multifunctional DNA ligase (LigD), has recently been identified in many prokaryotes. Eukaryotic organisms employ a large number of factors to repair breaks by NHEJ. In contrast, the bacterial NHEJ complex is a two-component system that, despite its relative simplicity, possesses all of the break-recognition, end-processing, and ligation activities required to facilitate the complex task of DSB repair. Here, we review recent discoveries on the structure and function of the bacterial NHEJ repair apparatus. In particular, we discuss the evolutionary origins of this DSB repair pathway, how the diverse activities within the prokaryotic end-joining complex cooperate to facilitate DSB repair, the physiological roles of bacterial NHEJ, and finally, the essential function of NHEJ in the life cycle of mycobacteriophage."

To identify amino acids involved in substrate recognition and catalytic activity of CaUGT2, a combination of domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out. Exchange of the PSPG-box of CaUGT2 with that of NtGT1b (a phenolic glucosyltransferase from tobacco) led to complete loss of enzyme activity in the resulting recombinant protein. However, replacement of Arg378 of the NtGT1b PSPG-box with cysteine, the corresponding amino acid in CaUGT2, restored the catalytic activity of the chimeric enzyme. Further site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the size of the amino acid side-chain in that particular site is critical to the catalytic activity of CaUGT2."
17515605,The 90S preribosome is a multimodular structure that is assembled through a hierarchical mechanism.,10.1128/MCB.00380-07,"The 90S preribosomal particle is required for the production of the 18S rRNA from a pre-rRNA precursor. Despite the identification of the protein components of this particle, its mechanism of assembly and structural design remain unknown. In this work, we have combined biochemical studies, proteomic techniques, and bioinformatic analyses to shed light into the rules of assembly of the yeast 90S preribosome. Our results indicate that several protein subcomplexes work as discrete assembly subunits that bind in defined steps to the 35S pre-rRNA. The assembly of the t-UTP subunit is an essential step for the engagement of at least five additional subunits in two separate, and mutually independent, assembling routes. One of these routes leads to the formation of an assembly intermediate composed of the U3 snoRNP, the Pwp2p/UTP-B, subunit and the Mpp10p complex. The other assembly route involves the stepwise binding of Rrp5p and the UTP-C subunit. We also report the use of a bioinformatic approach that provides a model for the topological arrangement of protein components within the fully assembled particle. Together, our data identify the mechanism of assembly of the 90S preribosome and offer novel information about its internal architecture."

To provide a more comprehensive list of polypeptides associated with the pre-mRNA splicing apparatus, we have determined the composition of the bulk pre-mRNA processing machinery in living cells. We purified endogenous nuclear pre-mRNA processing complexes from human and chicken cells comprising the massive (>200S) supraspliceosomes (a.k.a. polyspliceosomes). As expected, RNA components include a heterogeneous mixture of pre-mRNAs and the five spliceosomal snRNAs. In addition to known pre-mRNA splicing factors, 5' end binding factors, 3' end processing factors, mRNA export factors, hnRNPs and other RNA binding proteins, the protein components identified by mass spectrometry include RNA adenosine deaminases and several novel factors. Intriguingly, our purified supraspliceosomes also contain a number of structural proteins, nucleoporins, chromatin remodeling factors and several novel proteins that were absent from splicing complexes assembled in vitro. These in vivo analyses bring the total number of factors associated with pre-mRNA to well over 300, and represent the most comprehensive analysis of the pre-mRNA processing machinery to date."
17544411,"Cannabidiolic-acid synthase, the chemotype-determining enzyme in the fiber-type Cannabis sativa.",10.1016/j.febslet.2007.05.043,"Cannabidiolic-acid (CBDA) synthase is the enzyme that catalyzes oxidative cyclization of cannabigerolic-acid into CBDA, the dominant cannabinoid constituent of the fiber-type Cannabis sativa. We cloned a novel cDNA encoding CBDA synthase by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions with degenerate and gene-specific primers. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme demonstrated that CBDA synthase is a covalently flavinylated oxidase. The structural and functional properties of CBDA synthase are quite similar to those of tetrahydrocannabinolic-acid (THCA) synthase, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of THCA, the major cannabinoid in drug-type Cannabis plants."
17557827,Quorum sensing in Escherichia coli is signaled by AI-2/LsrR: effects on small RNA and biofilm architecture.,10.1128/JB.00014-07,"The regulatory network for the uptake of Escherichia coli autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is comprised of a transporter complex, LsrABCD; its repressor, LsrR; and a cognate signal kinase, LsrK. This network is an integral part of the AI-2 quorum-sensing (QS) system. Because LsrR and LsrK directly regulate AI-2 uptake, we hypothesized that they might play a wider role in regulating other QS-related cellular functions. In this study, we characterized physiological changes due to the genomic deletion of lsrR and lsrK. We discovered that many genes were coregulated by lsrK and lsrR but in a distinctly different manner than that for the lsr operon (where LsrR serves as a repressor that is derepressed by the binding of phospho-AI-2 to the LsrR protein). An extended model for AI-2 signaling that is consistent with all current data on AI-2, LuxS, and the LuxS regulon is proposed. Additionally, we found that both the quantity and architecture of biofilms were regulated by this distinct mechanism, as lsrK and lsrR knockouts behaved identically. Similar biofilm architectures probably resulted from the concerted response of a set of genes including flu and wza, the expression of which is influenced by lsrRK. We also found for the first time that the generation of several small RNAs (including DsrA, which was previously linked to QS systems in Vibrio harveyi) was affected by LsrR. Our results suggest that AI-2 is indeed a QS signal in E. coli, especially when it acts through the transcriptional regulator LsrR."

17560162,Maturation and degradation of RNA in bacteria.,10.1016/j.mib.2007.05.008,"RNA decay plays an important role, not only in recycling nucleotides but also in determining the rapidity with which cells can react to changing growth conditions. The degradation process can be regulated, thus providing an often-underestimated means of controlling gene expression. Recent developments in the field of RNA maturation and decay in two key model organisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, include the resolution of the structures of many of the participants in these processes in E. coli and the identification of an enzyme in B. subtilis that appears to fit the bill as a major player in RNA decay in this organism."
17573542,Novel insights into seed fatty acid synthesis and modification pathways from genetic diversity and quantitative trait Loci analysis of the Brassica C genome.,10.1104/pp.107.096172,"Natural genetic variation in fatty acid synthesis and modification pathways determine the composition of vegetable oils, which are major components of human diet and renewable products. Based on known pathways we combined diversity and genetic analysis of metabolites to infer the existence of enzymes encoded by distinct loci, and associated these with specific elongation steps or subpathways. A total of 107 lines representing different Brassica genepools revealed considerable variation for 18 seed fatty acid products. The effect of genetic variation within a single biochemical step on subsequent products was demonstrated using a correlation matrix of scatterplots, and by calculating relative step yields. Surprisingly, diploid Brassica oleracea segregating populations had a similar range of variation for individual fatty acids as across the whole genepool. This allowed identification of 22 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with activity in the plastid, early stages of synthesis, desaturation, and elongases. Four QTL were assigned to early stages of synthesis, seven to subpathway specific or general elongase activity, one to ketoacyl acyl-carrier protein synthetase, and two each to fatty acid desaturase and either desaturase or fatty acyl-carrier protein thioesterase. An additional 10 QTL had distinct effects but were not assigned specific functions. Where contrasting behavior in more than one subpathway was detected, we inferred QTL specificity for particular combinations of substrate and product. The assignment of enzyme function to QTL was consistent with the known position of some Brassicaeae candidate genes and collinear regions of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome."
17589524,Role of Dnl4-Lif1 in nonhomologous end-joining repair complex assembly and suppression of homologous recombination.,10.1038/nsmb1261,"Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) eliminates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in bacteria and eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are pairwise physical interactions among the core complexes of the NHEJ pathway, namely Yku70-Yku80 (Ku), Dnl4-Lif1 and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX). However, MRX also has a key role in the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR). Here we have examined the assembly of NHEJ complexes at DSBs biochemically and by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Ku first binds to the DNA end and then recruits Dnl4-Lif1. Notably, Dnl4-Lif1 stabilizes the binding of Ku to in vivo DSBs. Ku and Dnl4-Lif1 not only initiate formation of the nucleoprotein NHEJ complex but also attenuate HR by inhibiting DNA end resection. Therefore, Dnl4-Lif1 plays an important part in determining repair pathway choice by participating at an early stage of DSB engagement in addition to providing the DNA ligase activity that completes NHEJ."
17604854,Function and regulation in MAPK signaling pathways: lessons learned from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.05.003,"Signaling pathways that activate different mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) elicit many of the responses that are evoked in cells by changes in certain environmental conditions and upon exposure to a variety of hormonal and other stimuli. These pathways were first elucidated in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast). Studies of MAPK pathways in this organism continue to be especially informative in revealing the molecular mechanisms by which MAPK cascades operate, propagate signals, modulate cellular processes, and are controlled by regulatory factors both internal to and external to the pathways. Here we highlight recent advances and new insights about MAPK-based signaling that have been made through studies in yeast, which provide lessons directly applicable to, and that enhance our understanding of, MAPK-mediated signaling in mammalian cells."
17636255,Osmotically induced synthesis of the compatible solute hydroxyectoine is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved ectoine hydroxylase.,10.1074/jbc.M704023200,"By using natural abundance (13)C NMR spectroscopy, we investigated the types of compatible solutes synthesized in a variety of Bacilli under high salinity growth conditions. Glutamate, proline, and ectoine were the dominant compatible solutes synthesized by the various Bacillus species. The majority of the inspected Bacilli produced the tetrahydropyrimidine ectoine in response to high salinity stress, and a subset of these also synthesized a hydroxylation derivative of ectoine, 5-hydroxyectoine. In Salibacillus salexigens, a representative of the ectoine- and 5-hydroxyectoine-producing species, ectoine production was linearly correlated with the salinity of the growth medium and dependent on an ectABC biosynthetic operon. The formation of 5-hydroxyectoine was primarily a stationary growth phase phenomenon. The enzyme responsible for ectoine hydroxylation (EctD) was purified from S. salexigens to apparent homogeneity. The EctD protein was shown in vitro to directly hydroxylate ectoine in a reaction dependent on iron(II), molecular oxygen, and 2-oxoglutarate. We identified the structural gene (ectD) for the ectoine hydroxylase in S. salexigens. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcript levels of the ectABC and ectD genes increased as a function of salinity. Many EctD-related proteins can be found in data base searches in various Bacteria. Each of these bacterial species also contains an ectABC ectoine biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting that 5-hydroxyectoine biosynthesis strictly depends on the prior synthesis of ectoine. Our data base searches and the biochemical characterization of the EctD protein from S. salexigens suggest that the EctD-related ectoine hydroxylases are members of a new subfamily within the non-heme-containing, iron(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily (EC 1.14.11)."
17637737,Lysosomes: fusion and function.,10.1038/nrm2217,"Lysosomes are dynamic organelles that receive and degrade macromolecules from the secretory, endocytic, autophagic and phagocytic membrane-trafficking pathways. Live-cell imaging has shown that fusion with lysosomes occurs by both transient and full fusion events, and yeast genetics and mammalian cell-free systems have identified much of the protein machinery that coordinates these fusion events. Many pathogens that hijack the endocytic pathways to enter cells have evolved mechanisms to avoid being degraded by the lysosome. However, the function of lysosomes is not restricted to protein degradation: they also fuse with the plasma membrane during cell injury, as well as having more specialized secretory functions in some cell types."
17644605,Origins of flagellar gene operons and secondary flagellar systems.,10.1128/JB.00643-07,"Forty-one flagellated species representing 11 bacterial phyla were used to investigate the origin of secondary flagellar systems and the structure and formation of flagellar gene operons over the course of bacterial evolution. Secondary (i.e., lateral) flagellar systems, which are harbored by five of the proteobacterial species considered, originated twice, once in the alphaproteobacterial lineage and again in the common ancestor of the Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria. The order and organization of flagellar genes have undergone extensive shuffling and rearrangement among lineages, and based on the phylogenetic distributions of flagellar gene complexes, the flagellar gene operons existed as small, usually two-gene units in the ancestor of Bacteria and have expanded through the recruitment of new genes and fusion of gene units. In contrast to the evolutionary trend towards larger flagellar gene complexes, operon structures have been highly disrupted through gene disassociation and rearrangements in the Epsilon- and Alphaproteobacteria. These results demonstrate that the genetic basis of this ancient and structurally conserved organelle has been subject to many lineage-specific modifications."

Within this class of natural products are the C7N-aminocyclitol-containing compounds, which were originally associated with potent sugar-hydrolase inhibition. However, recent discoveries indicate a broader array of chemical structures and biological activities of this class of compounds. Using both conventional feeding experiments and contemporary molecular genetic approaches, some progress has been made in understanding the biosynthesis of this class of natural products. Results of in silico investigation also suggest a wide distribution of this class of natural products or closely related compounds across different classes of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria and fungi. This review describes our recent progress in the biosynthetic studies of a number of C7N-aminocyclitol-containing compounds and the potential use of bioinformatic approaches to search for novel aminocyclitol-containing natural products."

Chloral hydrate concentrations decreased in these cultures between 1 h and 24 h of incubation.

17719540,"A bacterial effector targets Mad2L2, an APC inhibitor, to modulate host cell cycling.",10.1016/j.cell.2007.06.043,"The gut epithelium self-renews every several days, providing an important innate defense system that limits bacterial colonization. Nevertheless, many bacterial pathogens, including Shigella, efficiently colonize the intestinal epithelium. Here, we show that the Shigella effector IpaB, when delivered into epithelial cells, causes cell-cycle arrest by targeting Mad2L2, an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) inhibitor. Cyclin B1 ubiquitination assays revealed that APC undergoes unscheduled activation due to IpaB interaction with the APC inhibitor Mad2L2. Synchronized HeLa cells infected with Shigella failed to accumulate Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1, causing cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in an IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent manner. IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent cell-cycle arrest by Shigella infection was also demonstrated in rabbit intestinal crypt progenitors, and the IpaB-mediated arrest contributed to efficient colonization of the host cells. These results strongly indicate that Shigella employ special tactics to influence epithelial renewal in order to promote bacterial colonization of intestinal epithelium."
17784964,Acute graft versus host disease.,10.1186/1750-1172-2-35,"Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. Activated donor T cells damage host epithelial cells after an inflammatory cascade that begins with the preparative regimen. About 35%-50% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients will develop acute GVHD. The exact risk is dependent on the stem cell source, age of the patient, conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis used. Given the number of transplants performed, we can expect about 5500 patients/year to develop acute GVHD. Patients can have involvement of three organs: skin (rash/dermatitis), liver (hepatitis/jaundice), and gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain/diarrhea). One or more organs may be involved. GVHD is a clinical diagnosis that may be supported with appropriate biopsies. The reason to pursue a tissue biopsy is to help differentiate from other diagnoses which may mimic GVHD, such as viral infection (hepatitis, colitis) or drug reaction (causing skin rash). Acute GVHD is staged and graded (grade 0-IV) by the number and extent of organ involvement. Patients with grade III/IV acute GVHD tend to have a poor outcome. Generally the patient is treated by optimizing their immunosuppression and adding methylprednisolone. About 50% of patients will have a solid response to methylprednisolone. If patients progress after 3 days or are not improved after 7 days, they will get salvage (second-line) immunosuppressive therapy for which there is currently no standard-of-care. Well-organized clinical trials are imperative to better define second-line therapies for this disease. Additional management issues are attention to wound infections in skin GVHD and fluid/nutrition management in gastrointestinal GVHD. About 50% of patients with acute GVHD will eventually have manifestations of chronic GVHD."
17875410,Yeast osmoregulation.,10.1016/S0076-6879(07)28002-4,"Osmoregulation is the active control of the cellular water balance and encompasses homeostatic mechanisms crucial for life. The osmoregulatory system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is particularly well understood. Key to yeast osmoregulation is the production and accumulation of the compatible solute glycerol, which is partly controlled by the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling system. Genetic analyses combined with studies on protein-protein interactions have revealed the wiring scheme of the HOG signaling network, a branched mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) pathway that eventually converges on the MAPK Hog1. Hog1 is activated following cell shrinking and controls posttranscriptional processes in the cytosol as well as gene expression in the nucleus. HOG pathway activity can easily and rapidly be controlled experimentally by extracellular stimuli, and signaling and adaptation can be separated by a system of forced adaptation. This makes yeast osmoregulation suitable for studies on system properties of signaling and cellular adaptation via mathematical modeling. Computational simulations and parallel quantitative time course experimentation on different levels of the regulatory system have provided a stepping stone toward a holistic understanding, revealing how the HOG pathway can combine rigorous feedback control with maintenance of signaling competence. The abundant tools make yeast a suitable model for an integrated analysis of cellular osmoregulation. Maintenance of the cellular water balance is fundamental for life. All cells, even those in multicellular organisms with an organism-wide osmoregulation, have the ability to actively control their water balance. Osmoregulation encompasses homeostatic processes that maintain an appropriate intracellular environment for biochemical processes as well as turgor of cells and organism. In the laboratory, the osmoregulatory system is studied most conveniently as a response to osmotic shock, causing rapid and dramatic changes in the extracellular water activity. Those rapid changes mediate either water efflux (hyperosmotic shock), and hence cell shrinkage, or influx (hypoosmotic shock), causing cell swelling. The yeast S. cerevisiae, as a free-living organism experiencing both slow and rapid changes in extracellular water activity, has proven a suitable and genetically tractable experimental system in studying the underlying signaling pathways and regulatory processes governing osmoregulation. Although far from complete, the present picture of yeast osmoregulation is both extensive and detailed (de Nadal et al., 2002; Hohmann, 2002; Klipp et al., 2005). Simulations using mathematical models combined with time course measurements of different molecular processes in signaling and adaptation have allowed elucidation of the first system properties on the yeast osmoregulatory network."
17900507,Pathophysiology of acute graft-versus-host disease: recent advances.,10.1016/j.trsl.2007.06.003,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for many malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases. Donor T cells from the allografts are critical for the success of this effective therapy. Unfortunately these T cells not only recognize and attack the disease cells/tissues but also the other normal tissues of the recipient as ""foreign"" or ""nonself"" and cause severe, immune-mediated toxicity, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Several insights into the complex pathophysiology of GVHD have been gained from recent experimental observations, which show that acute GVHD is a consequence of interactions between both the donor and the host innate and adaptive immune systems. These insights have identified a role for a variety of cytokines, chemokines, novel T-cell subsets (naĩve, memory, regulatory, and NKT cells) and for non-T cells of both the donor and the host (antigen presenting cells, delta T cells, B cells, and NK cells) in modulating the induction, severity, and maintenance of acute GVHD. This review will focus on the immunobiology of experimental acute GVHD with an emphasis on the recent observations."
17921282,The cyclic AMP receptor protein modulates colonial morphology in Vibrio cholerae.,10.1128/AEM.01564-07,"Inactivation of the quorum-sensing regulator HapR causes Vibrio cholerae El Tor biotype strain C7258 to adopt a rugose colonial morphology that correlates with enhanced biofilm formation. V. cholerae mutants lacking the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) produce very little HapR, which results in elevated expression of Vibrio exopolysaccharide (vps) genes and biofilm compared to the wild type. However, Deltacrp mutants still exhibited smooth colonial morphology and expressed reduced levels of vps genes compared to isogenic hapR mutants. In this study we demonstrate that deletion of crp and cya (adenylate cyclase) converts a rugose DeltahapR mutant to a smooth one. The smooth DeltahapR Deltacrp and DeltahapR Deltacya double mutants could be converted back to rugose by complementation with crp and cya, respectively. CRP was found to enhance the expression of VpsR, a strong activator of vps expression, but to diminish transcription of VpsT. Ectopic expression of VpsR in smooth DeltahapR Deltacrp and DeltahapR Deltacya double mutants restored rugose colonial morphology. Lowering intracellular cAMP levels in a DeltahapR mutant by the addition of glucose diminished VpsR expression and colonial rugosity. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for the regulatory input of CRP on exopolysaccharide biosynthesis."
17926129,Basic concepts and recent developments in human steroid hormone biosynthesis.,10.1007/s11154-007-9052-2,"The biosynthesis of steroid hormones requires the coordinated expression of the enzymes that comprise the pathways via which specific hormones are synthesized. These pathways and their associated enzymes are typically subject to regulation consisting of trophic hormone stimuli and feedback mechanisms. Very few tissues contribute substantially to de novo steroidogenesis, primarily the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the placenta. Both the embryonic origins and the signaling mechanisms for the adrenals and gonads are similar, and steroid synthesis in these two glands are the major focus of this review. We will further describe peripheral steroid metabolism and the regulation of steroid hormone potency in target tissues. In addition, we will briefly discuss the congenital adrenal hyperplasias to illustrate the principles developed in the initial sections. Finally, we will discuss some recent developments in steroidogensis, focusing on cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency and the alternate or ""backdoor"" pathway to dihydrotestosterone. We will conclude with a description of aberrant signaling mechanisms observed in adrenal tumors as a further example of how these pathways can be disturbed in pathologic states."

The study of these diseases has provided essential insights into the functioning of the immune system. More than 120 distinct genes have been identified, whose abnormalities account for more than 150 different forms of PID. The complexity of the genetic,immunologic, and clinical features of PID has prompted the need for their classification, with the ultimate goal of facilitating diagnosis and treatment. To serve this goal, an international committee of experts has met every 2 years since 1970.

17981973,A novel role for enzyme I of the Vibrio cholerae phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system in regulation of growth in a biofilm.,10.1128/JB.01410-07,"Glucose is a universal energy source and a potent inducer of surface colonization for many microbial species. Highly efficient sugar assimilation pathways ensure successful competition for this preferred carbon source. One such pathway is the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS), a multicomponent sugar transport system that phosphorylates the sugar as it enters the cell. Components required for transport of glucose through the PTS include enzyme I, histidine protein, enzyme IIA(Glc), and enzyme IIBC(Glc). In Escherichia coli, components of the PTS fulfill many regulatory roles, including regulation of nutrient scavenging and catabolism, chemotaxis, glycogen utilization, catabolite repression, and inducer exclusion. We previously observed that genes encoding the components of the Vibrio cholerae PTS were coregulated with the vps genes, which are required for synthesis of the biofilm matrix exopolysaccharide. In this work, we identify the PTS components required for transport of glucose and investigate the role of each of these components in regulation of biofilm formation. Our results establish a novel role for the phosphorylated form of enzyme I in specific regulation of biofilm-associated growth. As the PTS is highly conserved among bacteria, the enzyme I regulatory pathway may be relevant to a number of biofilm-based infections."

18023214,The endoplasmic reticulum and the unfolded protein response.,10.1016/j.semcdb.2007.09.003,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site where proteins enter the secretory pathway. Proteins are translocated into the ER lumen in an unfolded state and require protein chaperones and catalysts of protein folding to attain their final appropriate conformation. A sensitive surveillance mechanism exists to prevent misfolded proteins from transiting the secretory pathway and ensures that persistently misfolded proteins are directed towards a degradative pathway. In addition, those processes that prevent accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen are highly regulated by an intracellular signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR provides a mechanism by which cells can rapidly adapt to alterations in client protein-folding load in the ER lumen by expanding the capacity for protein folding. In addition, a variety of insults that disrupt protein folding in the ER lumen also activate the UPR. These include changes in intralumenal calcium, altered glycosylation, nutrient deprivation, pathogen infection, expression of folding-defective proteins, and changes in redox status. Persistent protein misfolding initiates apoptotic cascades that are now known to play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of multiple human diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases."
18047734,The Fanconi anemia pathway and ubiquitin.,10.1186/1471-2091-8-S1-S10,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, cancer/leukemia susceptibility and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, such as cisplatin. To date, 12 FA gene products have been identified, which cooperate in a common DNA damage-activated signaling pathway regulating DNA repair (the FA pathway). Eight FA proteins form a nuclear complex harboring E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (the FA core complex) that, in response to DNA damage, mediates the monoubiquitylation of the FA protein FANCD2. Monoubiquitylated FANCD2 colocalizes in nuclear foci with proteins involved in DNA repair, including BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2 and RAD51. All these factors are required for cellular resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. The inactivation of the FA pathway has also been observed in a wide variety of human cancers and is implicated in the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA crosslinking agents. Drugs that inhibit the FA pathway may be useful chemosensitizers in the treatment of cancer.

Bile acid 7alpha/beta-dehydroxylation is carried out by a few species of intestinal clostridia which harbor a multi-gene bile acid inducible (bai) operon. Several genes encoding enzymes in this pathway have been cloned and characterized. However, no gene product(s) has yet been assigned to the production of 3-oxo-Delta4-cholenoic acid intermediates of cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We previously reported that the baiH gene encodes an NADH:flavin oxidoreductase (NADH:FOR); however, the role of this protein in bile acid 7-dehydroxylation is unclear. Homology searches and secondary structural alignments suggest this protein to be similar to flavoproteins which reduce alpha/beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The baiH gene product was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and discovered to be a stereo-specific NAD(H)-dependent 7beta-hydroxy-3-oxo-Delta4-cholenoic acid oxidoreductase. Additionally, high sequence similarity between the baiH and baiCD gene products suggests the baiCD gene may encode a 3-oxo-Delta4-cholenoic acid oxidoreductase specific for CDCA and CA. We tested this hypothesis using cell extracts prepared from E. coli overexpressing the baiCD gene and discovered that it encodes a stereo-specific NAD(H)-dependent 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-Delta4-cholenoic acid oxidoreductase."

Evidence is presented based on enzymatic incubations with purified natural and synthetic galactofuranose (Galf) acceptors that the recombinant galactofuranosyl transferase, GlfT1, from Mycobacterium smegmatis, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3782 ortholog known to be involved in the initial steps of galactan formation, harbors dual beta-(1-->4) and beta-(1-->5) Galf transferase activities and that the product of the enzyme, decaprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Galf-Galf, serves as a direct substrate for full polymerization catalyzed by another bifunctional Galf transferase, GlfT2, the Rv3808c enzyme."
18065535,"Mesaconyl-coenzyme A hydratase, a new enzyme of two central carbon metabolic pathways in bacteria.",10.1128/JB.01621-07,"The coenzyme A (CoA)-activated C5-dicarboxylic acids mesaconyl-CoA and beta-methylmalyl-CoA play roles in two as yet not completely resolved central carbon metabolic pathways in bacteria. First, these compounds are intermediates in the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle for autotrophic CO2 fixation in Chloroflexus aurantiacus, a phototrophic green nonsulfur bacterium. Second, mesaconyl-CoA and beta-methylmalyl-CoA are intermediates in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for acetate assimilation in various bacteria, e.g., in Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Methylobacterium extorquens, and Streptomyces species. In both cases, mesaconyl-CoA hydratase was postulated to catalyze the interconversion of mesaconyl-CoA and beta-methylmalyl-CoA. The putative genes coding for this enzyme in C. aurantiacus and R. sphaeroides were cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the proteins were purified and studied. The recombinant homodimeric 80-kDa proteins catalyzed the reversible dehydration of erythro-beta-methylmalyl-CoA to mesaconyl-CoA with rates of 1,300 micromol min(-1) mg protein(-1). Genes coding for similar enzymes with two (R)-enoyl-CoA hydratase domains are present in the genomes of Roseiflexus, Methylobacterium, Hyphomonas, Rhodospirillum, Xanthobacter, Caulobacter, Magnetospirillum, Jannaschia, Sagittula, Parvibaculum, Stappia, Oceanicola, Loktanella, Silicibacter, Roseobacter, Roseovarius, Dinoroseobacter, Sulfitobacter, Paracoccus, and Ralstonia species. A similar yet distinct class of enzymes containing only one hydratase domain was found in various other bacteria, such as Streptomyces species. The role of this widely distributed new enzyme is discussed."
18077448,Characterization of tRNA-dependent peptide bond formation by MurM in the synthesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae peptidoglycan.,10.1074/jbc.M708105200,"MurM is an aminoacyl ligase that adds l-serine or l-alanine as the first amino acid of a dipeptide branch to the stem peptide lysine of the pneumococcal peptidoglycan. MurM activity is essential for clinical pneumococcal penicillin resistance. Analysis of peptidoglycan from the highly penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strain 159 revealed that in vivo and in vitro, in the presence of the appropriate acyl-tRNA, MurM(159) alanylated the peptidoglycan epsilon-amino group of the stem peptide lysine in preference to its serylation. However, in contrast, identical analyses of the penicillin-susceptible strain Pn16 revealed that MurM(Pn16) activity supported serylation more than alanylation both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, both MurM(Pn16) acylation activities were far lower than the alanylation activity of MurM(159). The resulting differing stem peptide structures of 159 and Pn16 were caused by the profoundly greater catalytic efficiency of MurM(159) compared with MurM(Pn16) bought about by sequence variation between these enzymes and, to a lesser extent, differences in the in vivo tRNA(Ala):tRNA(Ser) ratio in 159 and Pn16. Kinetic analysis revealed that MurM(159) acted during the lipid-linked stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, that the d-alanyl-d-alanine of the stem peptide and the lipid II N-acetylglucosaminyl group were not essential for substrate recognition, that epsilon-carboxylation of the lysine of the stem peptide was not tolerated, and that lipid II-alanine was a substrate, suggesting an evolutionary link to staphylococcal homologues of MurM such as FemA. Kinetic analysis also revealed that MurM recognized the acceptor stem and/or the TPsiC loop stem of the tRNA(Ala). It is anticipated that definition of the minimal structural features of MurM substrates will allow development of novel resistance inhibitors that will restore the efficacy of beta-lactams for treatment of pneumococcal infection."
18081658,Review article: The function and regulation of proteins involved in bile salt biosynthesis and transport.,10.1111/j.1365-2036.2007.03522.x,Bile salts are produced and secreted by the liver and are required for intestinal absorption of fatty food components and excretion of endobiotics and xenobiotics. They are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and transported back to the liver via the portal tract. Dedicated bile salt transporters in hepatocytes and enterocytes are responsible for the unidirectional transport of bile salts in the enterohepatic cycle.

This review summarizes the current knowledge on the membrane steps leading to the formation of the lipid II intermediate, i.e. the substrate of the polymerization reactions. It makes the point on past and recent data that have significantly contributed to the understanding of the biosynthesis of undecaprenyl phosphate, the carrier lipid required for the anchoring of the peptidoglycan hydrophilic units in the membrane, and to the characterization of the MraY and MurG enzymes which catalyze the successive transfers of the N-acetylmuramoyl-peptide and N-acetylglucosamine moieties onto the carrier lipid, respectively. Enzyme inhibitors and antibacterial compounds interfering with these essential metabolic steps and interesting targets are presented."
18092812,Crystal structure of a molybdopterin synthase-precursor Z complex: insight into its sulfur transfer mechanism and its role in molybdenum cofactor deficiency.,10.1021/bi701734g,"In almost all biological life forms, molybdenum and tungsten are coordinated by molybdopterin (MPT), a tricyclic pyranopterin containing a cis-dithiolene group. Together, the metal and the pterin moiety form the redox reactive molybdenum cofactor (Moco). Mutations in patients with deficiencies in Moco biosynthesis usually occur in the enzymes catalyzing the first and second steps of biosynthesis, leading to the formation of precursor Z and MPT, respectively. The second step is catalyzed by the heterotetrameric MPT synthase protein consisting of two large (MoaE) and two small (MoaD) subunits with the MoaD subunits located at opposite ends of a central MoaE dimer. Previous studies have determined that the conversion of the sulfur- and metal-free precursor Z to MPT by MPT synthase involves the transfer of sulfur atoms from a C-terminal MoaD thiocarboxylate to the C-1' and C-2' positions of precursor Z. Here, we present the crystal structures of non-thiocarboxylated MPT synthase from Staphylococcus aureus in its apo form and in complex with precursor Z. A comparison of the two structures reveals conformational changes in a loop that participates in interactions with precursor Z. In the complex, precursor Z is bound by strictly conserved residues in a pocket at the MoaE dimer interface in close proximity of the C-terminal glycine of MoaD. Biochemical evidence indicates that the first dithiolene sulfur is added at the C-2' position."

PID are also very informative in defining key checkpoints controlling immunity to self. Despite a Mendelian inheritance of most PID, mutations of a given gene can lead to a vast array of phenotypes as a function of the type of mutations, environmental factors, the occurrence of additional somatic mutations, or regulatory factors, which add considerable but hitherto underestimated complexity. Understanding the molecular pathophysiology of PID is not only contributing to a better knowledge of the immune system but may also favor new therapeutic approaches."
18158581,Protein factors in pre-mRNA 3'-end processing.,10.1007/s00018-007-7474-3,"Most eukaryotic mRNA precursors (premRNAs) must undergo extensive processing, including cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3'-end. Processing at the 3'-end is controlled by sequence elements in the pre-mRNA (cis elements) as well as protein factors. Despite the seeming biochemical simplicity of the processing reactions, more than 14 proteins have been identified for the mammalian complex, and more than 20 proteins have been identified for the yeast complex. The 3'-end processing machinery also has important roles in transcription and splicing. The mammalian machinery contains several sub-complexes, including cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor, cleavage stimulation factor, cleavage factor I, and cleavage factor II. Additional protein factors include poly(A) polymerase, poly(A)-binding protein, symplekin, and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II largest subunit. The yeast machinery includes cleavage factor IA, cleavage factor IB, and cleavage and polyadenylation factor."
18192444,Elucidation of the final reactions of DIMBOA-glucoside biosynthesis in maize: characterization of Bx6 and Bx7.,10.1104/pp.107.111237,"Benzoxazinoids were identified in the early 1960s as secondary metabolites of the grasses that function as natural pesticides and exhibit allelopathic properties. Benzoxazinoids are synthesized in seedlings and stored as glucosides (glcs); the main aglucone moieties are 2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIBOA) and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA). The genes of DIBOA-glc biosynthesis have previously been isolated and the enzymatic functions characterized. Here, the enzymes for conversion of DIBOA-glc to DIMBOA-glc are identified. DIBOA-glc is the substrate of the dioxygenase BENZOXAZINLESS6 (BX6) and the produced 2,4,7-trihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3-(4H)-one-glc is metabolized by the methyltransferase BX7 to yield DIMBOA-glc. Both enzymes exhibit moderate K(m) values (below 0.4 mm) and k(cat) values of 2.10 s(-1) and 0.25 s(-1), respectively. Although BX6 uses a glucosylated substrate, our localization studies indicate a cytoplasmic localization of the dioxygenase. Bx6 and Bx7 are highest expressed in seedling tissue, a feature shared with the other Bx genes. At present, Bx6 and Bx7 have no close relatives among the members of their respective gene families. Bx6 and Bx7 map to the cluster of Bx genes on the short arm of chromosome 4."
18230623,"Molecular cloning and characterization of CYP80G2, a cytochrome P450 that catalyzes an intramolecular C-C phenol coupling of (S)-reticuline in magnoflorine biosynthesis, from cultured Coptis japonica cells.",10.1074/jbc.M705082200,"Cytochrome P450s (P450) play a key role in oxidative reactions in plant secondary metabolism. Some of them, which catalyze unique reactions other than the standard hydroxylation, increase the structural diversity of plant secondary metabolites. In isoquinoline alkaloid biosyntheses, several unique P450 reactions have been reported, such as methylenedioxy bridge formation, intramolecular C-C phenol-coupling and intermolecular C-O phenol-coupling reactions. We report here the isolation and characterization of a C-C phenol-coupling P450 cDNA (CYP80G2) from an expressed sequence tag library of cultured Coptis japonica cells. Structural analysis showed that CYP80G2 had high amino acid sequence similarity to Berberis stolonifera CYP80A1, an intermolecular C-O phenol-coupling P450 involved in berbamunine biosynthesis. Heterologous expression in yeast indicated that CYP80G2 had intramolecular C-C phenol-coupling activity to produce (S)-corytuberine (aporphine-type) from (S)-reticuline (benzylisoquinoline type). Despite this intriguing reaction, recombinant CYP80G2 showed typical P450 properties: its C-C phenol-coupling reaction required NADPH and oxygen and was inhibited by a typical P450 inhibitor. Based on a detailed substrate-specificity analysis, this unique reaction mechanism and substrate recognition were discussed. CYP80G2 may be involved in magnoflorine biosynthesis in C. japonica, based on the fact that recombinant C. japonica S-adenosyl-L-methionine:coclaurine N-methyltransferase could convert (S)-corytuberine to magnoflorine."
18235503,Structure and mechanism of the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus.,10.1038/nature06531,"The integral membrane protein M2 of influenza virus forms pH-gated proton channels in the viral lipid envelope. The low pH of an endosome activates the M2 channel before haemagglutinin-mediated fusion. Conductance of protons acidifies the viral interior and thereby facilitates dissociation of the matrix protein from the viral nucleoproteins--a required process for unpacking of the viral genome. In addition to its role in release of viral nucleoproteins, M2 in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement of newly synthesized haemagglutinin during transport to the cell surface by equilibrating the pH of the TGN with that of the host cell cytoplasm. Inhibiting the proton conductance of M2 using the anti-viral drug amantadine or rimantadine inhibits viral replication. Here we present the structure of the tetrameric M2 channel in complex with rimantadine, determined by NMR. In the closed state, four tightly packed transmembrane helices define a narrow channel, in which a 'tryptophan gate' is locked by intermolecular interactions with aspartic acid. A carboxy-terminal, amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular to the transmembrane helix forms an inward-facing base. Lowering the pH destabilizes the transmembrane helical packing and unlocks the gate, admitting water to conduct protons, whereas the C-terminal base remains intact, preventing dissociation of the tetramer. Rimantadine binds at four equivalent sites near the gate on the lipid-facing side of the channel and stabilizes the closed conformation of the pore. Drug-resistance mutations are predicted to counter the effect of drug binding by either increasing the hydrophilicity of the pore or weakening helix-helix packing, thus facilitating channel opening."
18243016,Dynamic interactions between bacteria and immune cells leading to intestinal IgA synthesis.,10.1016/j.smim.2007.12.003,"The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by an immense number of bacteria that are in a constant dialog with our immune cells. One obvious question is how the mucosal immune system maintains a state of hypo-responsiveness toward the commensal bacteria and a state of readiness that allows efficient and prompt responses against pathogens. The answers have important implications for immunologists who seek to understand the fundamental aspects of bacteria-immune cell interactions in the steady-state condition and wish to elucidate the patho-physiologic mechanisms in immune disregulations, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. An important adjustment of the immune system to bacterial colonization of the gut is the ""constitutive"" production of IgA by the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). In this review, we summarize the sites and mechanisms for IgA synthesis in mice. We emphasize the important role played by secretory IgAs in maintenance of an appropriate intestinal microbiota, which is required for local and systemic immune homeostasis."
18252769,From one amino acid to another: tRNA-dependent amino acid biosynthesis.,10.1093/nar/gkn015,"Aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are the essential substrates for translation. Most aa-tRNAs are formed by direct aminoacylation of tRNA catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. However, a smaller number of aa-tRNAs (Asn-tRNA, Gln-tRNA, Cys-tRNA and Sec-tRNA) are made by synthesizing the amino acid on the tRNA by first attaching a non-cognate amino acid to the tRNA, which is then converted to the cognate one catalyzed by tRNA-dependent modifying enzymes. Asn-tRNA or Gln-tRNA formation in most prokaryotes requires amidation of Asp-tRNA or Glu-tRNA by amidotransferases that couple an amidase or an asparaginase to liberate ammonia with a tRNA-dependent kinase. Both archaeal and eukaryotic Sec-tRNA biosynthesis and Cys-tRNA synthesis in methanogens require O-phosophoseryl-tRNA formation. For tRNA-dependent Cys biosynthesis, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase directly attaches the amino acid to the tRNA which is then converted to Cys by Sep-tRNA: Cys-tRNA synthase. In Sec-tRNA synthesis, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase phosphorylates Ser-tRNA to form the intermediate which is then modified to Sec-tRNA by Sep-tRNA:Sec-tRNA synthase. Complex formation between enzymes in the same pathway may protect the fidelity of protein synthesis. How these tRNA-dependent amino acid biosynthetic routes are integrated into overall metabolism may explain why they are still retained in so many organisms."
18262778,The genetic basis for indole-diterpene chemical diversity in filamentous fungi.,10.1016/j.mycres.2007.06.015,"Indole-diterpenes are a structurally diverse group of secondary metabolites with a common cyclic diterpene backbone derived from geranylgeranyl diphosphate and an indole group derived from indole-3-glycerol phosphate. Different types and patterns of ring substitutions and ring stereochemistry generate this structural diversity. This group of compounds is best known for their neurotoxic effects in mammals, causing syndromes such as 'ryegrass staggers' in sheep and cattle. Because many of the fungi that synthesise these compounds form symbiotic relationships with plants, insects, and other fungi, the synthesis of these compounds may confer an ecological advantage to these associations. Considerable recent progress has been made on understanding indole-diterpene biosynthesis in filamentous fungi, principally through the cloning and characterisation of the genes and gene products for paxilline biosynthesis in Penicillium paxilli. Important insights into how the indole-diterpene backbone is synthesised and decorated have been obtained using P. paxilli mutants in this pathway. This review provides an overview of these recent developments."

This review deals with the cytoplasmic steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, which can be divided into four sets of reactions that lead to the syntheses of (1) UDP-N-acetylglucosamine from fructose 6-phosphate, (2) UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, (3) UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide from UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid and (4) D-glutamic acid and dipeptide D-alanyl-D-alanine. Recent data concerning the different enzymes involved are presented. Moreover, special attention is given to (1) the chemical and enzymatic synthesis of the nucleotide precursor substrates that are not commercially available and (2) the search for specific inhibitors that could act as antibacterial compounds."
18310071,myo-Inositol catabolism in Bacillus subtilis.,10.1074/jbc.M708043200,"The iolABCDEFGHIJ operon of Bacillus subtilis is responsible for myo-inositol catabolism involving multiple and stepwise reactions. Previous studies demonstrated that IolG and IolE are the enzymes for the first and second reactions, namely dehydrogenation of myo-inositol to give 2-keto-myo-inositol and the subsequent dehydration to 3D-(3,5/4)-trihydroxycyclohexane-1,2-dione. In the present studies the third reaction was shown to be the hydrolysis of 3D-(3,5/4)-trihydroxycyclohexane-1,2-dione catalyzed by IolD to yield 5-deoxy-d-glucuronic acid. The fourth reaction was the isomerization of 5-deoxy-D-glucuronic acid by IolB to produce 2-deoxy-5-keto-D-gluconic acid. Next, in the fifth reaction 2-deoxy-5-keto-D-gluconic acid was phosphorylated by IolC kinase to yield 2-deoxy-5-keto-D-gluconic acid 6-phosphate. IolR is known as the repressor controlling transcription of the iol operon. In this reaction 2-deoxy-5-keto-D-gluconic acid 6-phosphate appeared to be the intermediate acting as inducer by antagonizing DNA binding of IolR. Finally, IolJ turned out to be the specific aldolase for the sixth reaction, the cleavage of 2-deoxy-5-keto-D-gluconic acid 6-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and malonic semialdehyde. The former is a known glycolytic intermediate, and the latter was previously shown to be converted to acetyl-CoA and CO(2) by a reaction catalyzed by IolA. The net result of the inositol catabolic pathway in B. subtilis is, thus, the conversion of myo-inositol to an equimolar mixture of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, acetyl-CoA, and CO(2)."
18313922,Sumoylating and desumoylating enzymes at nuclear pores: underpinning their unexpected duties?,10.1016/j.tcb.2008.02.001,"Modulation of protein activities by SUMO-dependent modification has emerged as a key feature of cellular regulation. Evidence of the localization of different enzymes of the sumoylation-desumoylation cycle at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), and of its biological relevance, has steadily accumulated over the past ten years. Recent findings indicate that, beyond nucleocytoplasmic transport, sumoylation processes underpin newly emerging, and initially unexpected, roles for NPCs in a broad array of biological functions. These include cell division, DNA repair, DNA replication and mRNA quality control. Most of these functions were initially discovered through genetic studies in budding yeast, but the localization of SUMO-proteases at NPCs in higher eukaryotes suggests that at least some of these mechanisms might have been conserved during evolution."
18355280,Identification of genes coding for hydrolytic dehalogenation in the metagenome derived from a denitrifying 4-chlorobenzoate degrading consortium.,10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01106.x,"A metagenomic approach was taken to investigate the genetic basis for the ability of an anaerobic consortium to grow on either 4-chlorobenzoate or 4-bromobenzoate under denitrifying conditions. Degenerate PCR primers were designed for the family of 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase genes. The primers were utilized to screen a metagenome library and two overlapping clones were identified which yield a PCR product. The complete sequence of one metagenome clone was determined and genes encoding 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA ligase (FcbA) and 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase (FcbB) were identified. Analysis of the ORFs present in the nucleotide sequence suggests that the metagenome clone originated from an uncultured denitrifying microorganism belonging to the Betaproteobacteria. Interestingly, unlike similar gene clusters reported in aerobes, a gene encoding 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase was not present in the gene cluster. This suggests that 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA is further degraded via the anaerobic reduction pathway in the corresponding microorganism instead of through thioester hydrolysis to yield 4-hydroxybenzoate."
18356490,Metabolic diversification--independent assembly of operon-like gene clusters in different plants.,10.1126/science.1154990,"Operons are clusters of unrelated genes with related functions that are a feature of prokaryotic genomes. Here, we report on an operon-like gene cluster in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana that is required for triterpene synthesis (the thalianol pathway). The clustered genes are coexpressed, as in bacterial operons. However, despite the resemblance to a bacterial operon, this gene cluster has been assembled from plant genes by gene duplication, neofunctionalization, and genome reorganization, rather than by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. Furthermore, recent assembly of operon-like gene clusters for triterpene synthesis has occurred independently in divergent plant lineages (Arabidopsis and oat). Thus, selection pressure may act during the formation of certain plant metabolic pathways to drive gene clustering."
18363779,Two nearly identical terpene synthases catalyze the formation of nerolidol and linalool in snapdragon flowers.,10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03496.x,"Terpenoids emitted from snapdragon flowers include three monoterpenes derived from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), myrcene, (E)-beta-ocimene and linalool, and a sesquiterpene, nerolidol, derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Using a functional genomics approach, we have isolated and biochemically characterized two nearly identical nerolidol/linalool synthases, AmNES/LIS-1 and AmNES/LIS-2, two enzymes responsible for the terpenoid profile of snapdragon scent remaining to be characterized. The AmNES/LIS-2 protein has an additional 30 amino acids in the N-terminus, and shares 95% amino acid sequence identity with AmNES/LIS-1, with only 23 amino acid substitutions distributed across the homologous regions of the proteins. Although these two terpene synthases have very similar catalytic properties, and synthesize linalool and nerolidol as specific products from GPP and FPP, respectively, they are compartmentally segregated. GFP localization studies and analysis of enzyme activities in purified leucoplasts, together with our previous feeding experiments, revealed that AmNES/LIS-1 is localized in cytosol, and is responsible for nerolidol biosynthesis, whereas AmNES/LIS-2 is located in plastids, and accounts for linalool formation. Our results show that subcellular localization of bifunctional enzymes, in addition to the availability of substrate, controls the type of product formed. By directing nearly identical bifunctional enzymes to more than one cellular compartment, plants extend the range of available substrates for enzyme utilization, thus increasing the diversity of the metabolites produced."
18379584,The role of kinases in the Hedgehog signalling pathway.,10.1038/embor.2008.38,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway has a crucial role in several developmental processes and is aberrantly activated in a variety of cancers. In Drosophila, many of the canonical Hh pathway components are phosphorylated, yet the precise role of these phosphorylation events in the regulation of Hh signal transduction is unclear. Furthermore, the Hh pathway receives input from several kinases that have well-described roles in other cellular functions, some of which have both positive and negative effects on Hh signalling. Several recent studies have characterized the role of specific phosphorylation events in the Hh pathway, and have begun to shed light on how phosphorylation of Hh signalling components affects their subcellular location, stability and activity to mediate the transcriptional response to the Hh gradient."
18382419,Mechanisms of disease: molecular genetics of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy.,10.1038/ncpcardio1182,"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy is an inherited cardiomyopathy estimated to affect approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals. Cardinal manifestations include right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction, fibrofatty replacement of myocytes in the right ventricle, characteristic electrocardiographic abnormalities, and ventricular arrhythmia most commonly arising from the right ventricle. The disease is frequently familial and typically involves autosomal dominant transmission with low penetrance and variable expressivity. Approximately 50% of symptomatic individuals harbor a mutation in one of the five major components of the cardiac desmosome. Nevertheless, other genetic modifiers and environmental factors complicate the clinical management of mutation carriers as well as counseling of their relatives. This Review summarizes the known genetic mutations associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, describes possible origins of recurrent mutations, presents theories on the pathogenesis of disease following a mutation, and discusses the current issues surrounding clinical use of genetic analysis in the assessment of individuals with this condition."
18435614,Chemistry of mixed melanogenesis--pivotal roles of dopaquinone.,10.1111/j.1751-1097.2007.00238.x,"Melanins can be classified into two major groups-insoluble brown to black pigments termed eumelanin and alkali-soluble yellow to reddish-brown pigments termed pheomelanin. Both types of pigment derive from the common precursor dopaquinone (ortho-quinone of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) which is formed via the oxidation of l-tyrosine by the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase. Dopaquinone is a highly reactive ortho-quinone that plays pivotal roles in the chemical control of melanogenesis. In the absence of sulfhydryl compounds, dopaquinone undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form cyclodopa, which is then rapidly oxidized by a redox reaction with dopaquinone to give dopachrome (and dopa). Dopachrome then gradually and spontaneously rearranges to form 5,6-dihydroxyindole and to a lesser extent 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, the ratio of which is determined by a distinct melanogenic enzyme termed dopachrome tautomerase (tyrosinase-related protein-2). Oxidation and subsequent polymerization of these dihydroxyindoles leads to the production of eumelanin. However, when cysteine is present, this process gives rise preferentially to the production of cysteinyldopa isomers. Cysteinyldopas are subsequently oxidized through redox reaction with dopaquinone to form cysteinyldopaquinones that eventually lead to the production of pheomelanin. Pulse radiolysis studies of early stages of melanogenesis (involving dopaquinone and cysteine) indicate that mixed melanogenesis proceeds in three distinct stages-the initial production of cysteinyldopas, followed by their oxidation to produce pheomelanin, followed finally by the production of eumelanin. Based on these data, a casing model of mixed melanogenesis is proposed in which a preformed pheomelanic core is covered by a eumelanic surface."
18440267,Building lipid barriers: biosynthesis of cutin and suberin.,10.1016/j.tplants.2008.03.003,"Cutin and suberin are the polymer matrices for lipophilic cell wall barriers. These barriers control the fluxes of gases, water and solutes, and also play roles in protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stresses and in controlling plant morphology. Although they are ubiquitous, cutin and suberin are the least understood of the major plant extracellular polymers. The use of forward and reverse genetic approaches in Arabidopsis has led to the identification of oxidoreductase and acyltransferase genes involved in the biosynthesis of these polymers. However, major questions about the underlying polymer structure, biochemistry, and intracellular versus extracellular assembly remain to be resolved. The analysis of plant lines with modified cutins and suberins has begun to reveal the inter-relationships between the composition and function of these polymers."

Unlike other types of secondary metabolites, the various structural categories of alkaloids are unrelated in terms of biosynthesis and evolution. Although the biology of each group is unique, common patterns have become apparent. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), which produces several benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, and Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), which accumulates an array of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, have emerged as the premier organisms used to study plant alkaloid metabolism. The status of these species as model systems results from decades of research on the chemistry, enzymology and molecular biology responsible for the biosynthesis of valuable pharmaceutical alkaloids. Opium poppy remains the only commercial source for morphine, codeine and semi-synthetic analgesics, such as oxycodone, derived from thebaine. Catharanthus roseus is the only source for the anti-cancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine. Impressive collections of cDNAs encoding biosynthetic enzymes and regulatory proteins involved in the formation of benzylisoquinoline and monoterpenoid indole alkaloids are now available, and the rate of gene discovery has accelerated with the application of genomics. Such tools have allowed the establishment of models that describe the complex cell biology of alkaloid metabolism in these important medicinal plants. A suite of biotechnological resources, including genetic transformation protocols, has allowed the application of metabolic engineering to modify the alkaloid content of these and related species. An overview of recent progress on benzylisoquinoline and monoterpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis in opium poppy and C. roseus is presented."
18483500,The regulation of IgA class switching.,10.1038/nri2322,"IgA class switching is the process whereby B cells acquire the expression of IgA, the most abundant antibody isotype in mucosal secretions. IgA class switching occurs via both T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent pathways, and the antibody targets both pathogenic and commensal microorganisms. This Review describes recent advances indicating that innate immune recognition of microbial signatures at the epithelial-cell barrier is central to the selective induction of mucosal IgA class switching. In addition, the mechanisms of IgA class switching at follicular and extrafollicular sites within the mucosal environment are summarized. A better understanding of these mechanisms may help in the development of more effective mucosal vaccines."
18488143,"Bile acids: chemistry, pathochemistry, biology, pathobiology, and therapeutics.",10.1007/s00018-008-7568-6,"Bile acids and bile alcohols in the form of their conjugates are amphipathic end products of cholesterol metabolism with multiple physiological functions. The great variety of bile acids and bile alcohols that are present in vertebrates are tabulated. Bile salts have an enterohepatic circulation resulting from efficient vectorial transport of bile salts through the hepatocyte and the ileal enterocyte; such transport leads to the accumulation of a pool of bile salts that cycles between the liver and intestine. Bile salt anions promote lipid absorption, enhance tryptic cleavage of dietary proteins, and have antimicrobial effects. Bile salts are signaling molecules, activating nuclear receptors in the hepatocyte and ileal enterocyte, as well as an increasing number of G-protein coupled receptors. Bile acids are used therapeutically to correct deficiency states, to decrease the cholesterol saturation of bile, or to decrease the cytotoxicity of retained bile acids in cholestatic liver disease."
18492791,Integrin-dependent phagocytosis: spreading from microadhesion to new concepts.,10.1242/jcs.018036,"By linking actin dynamics to extracellular components, integrins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes that are associated with or require cytoskeletal remodelling and cell-shape changes. One such function is integrin-dependent phagocytosis, a process that several integrins are capable of mediating and that allows the binding and clearance of particles. Integrin-dependent phagocytosis is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, from the clearance of microorganisms and apoptotic-cell removal to extracellular-matrix remodelling. Integrin signalling is also exploited by microbial pathogens for entry into host cells. Far from being a particular property of specific integrins and specialised cells, integrin-dependent uptake is emerging as a general, intrinsic ability of most integrins that is associated with their capacity to signal to the actin cytoskeleton. Integrin-mediated phagocytosis can therefore be used as a robust model in which to study integrin regulation and signalling."
18492807,Microbial production of plant benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.,10.1073/pnas.0802981105,"Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, such as the analgesic compounds morphine and codeine, and the antibacterial agents berberine, palmatine, and magnoflorine, are synthesized from tyrosine in the Papaveraceae, Berberidaceae, Ranunculaceae, Magnoliaceae, and many other plant families. It is difficult to produce alkaloids on a large scale under the strict control of secondary metabolism in plants, and they are too complex for cost-effective chemical synthesis. By using a system that combines microbial and plant enzymes to produce desired benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, we synthesized (S)-reticuline, the key intermediate in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, from dopamine by crude enzymes from transgenic Escherichia coli. The final yield of (S)-reticuline was 55 mg/liter within 1 h. Furthermore, we synthesized an aporphine alkaloid, magnoflorine, or a protoberberine alkaloid, scoulerine, from dopamine via reticuline by using different combination cultures of transgenic E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The final yields of magnoflorine and scoulerine were 7.2 and 8.3 mg/liter culture medium. These results indicate that microbial systems that incorporate plant genes cannot only enable the mass production of scarce benzylisoquinoline alkaloids but may also open up pathways for the production of novel benzylisoquinoline alkaloids."

18511565,A dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate autotrophic carbon assimilation cycle in the hyperthermophilic Archaeum Ignicoccus hospitalis.,10.1073/pnas.0801043105,"Ignicoccus hospitalis is an anaerobic, autotrophic, hyperthermophilic Archaeum that serves as a host for the symbiotic/parasitic Archaeum Nanoarchaeum equitans. It uses a yet unsolved autotrophic CO(2) fixation pathway that starts from acetyl-CoA (CoA), which is reductively carboxylated to pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted to phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP), from which glucogenesis as well as oxaloacetate formation branch off. Here, we present the complete metabolic cycle by which the primary CO(2) acceptor molecule acetyl-CoA is regenerated. Oxaloacetate is reduced to succinyl-CoA by an incomplete reductive citric acid cycle lacking 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase or synthase. Succinyl-CoA is reduced to 4-hydroxybutyrate, which is then activated to the CoA thioester. By using the radical enzyme 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is dehydrated to crotonyl-CoA. Finally, beta-oxidation of crotonyl-CoA leads to two molecules of acetyl-CoA. Thus, the cyclic pathway forms an extra molecule of acetyl-CoA, with pyruvate synthase and PEP carboxylase as the carboxylating enzymes. The proposal is based on in vitro transformation of 4-hydroxybutyrate, detection of all enzyme activities, and in vivo-labeling experiments using [1-(14)C]4-hydroxybutyrate, [1,4-(13)C(2)], [U-(13)C(4)]succinate, or [1-(13)C]pyruvate as tracers. The pathway is termed the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle. It combines anaerobic metabolic modules to a straightforward and efficient CO(2) fixation mechanism."
18513324,"Structure, regulation and evolution of Nox-family NADPH oxidases that produce reactive oxygen species.",10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06488.x,"NADPH oxidases of the Nox family exist in various supergroups of eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes, and play crucial roles in a variety of biological processes, such as host defense, signal transduction, and hormone synthesis. In conjunction with NADPH oxidation, Nox enzymes reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide as a primary product, and this is further converted to various reactive oxygen species. The electron-transferring system in Nox is composed of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region homologous to the prokaryotic (and organelle) enzyme ferredoxin reductase and the N-terminal six transmembrane segments containing two hemes, a structure similar to that of cytochrome b of the mitochondrial bc(1) complex. During the course of eukaryote evolution, Nox enzymes have developed regulatory mechanisms, depending on their functions, by inserting a regulatory domain (or motif) into their own sequences or by obtaining a tightly associated protein as a regulatory subunit. For example, one to four Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand motifs are present at the N-termini in several subfamilies, such as the respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) subfamily in land plants (the supergroup Plantae), the NoxC subfamily in social amoebae (the Amoebozoa), and the Nox5 and dual oxidase (Duox) subfamilies in animals (the Opisthokonta), whereas an SH3 domain is inserted into the ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase region of two Nox enzymes in Naegleria gruberi, a unicellular organism that belongs to the supergroup Excavata. Members of the Nox1-4 subfamily in animals form a stable heterodimer with the membrane protein p22(phox), which functions as a docking site for the SH3 domain-containing regulatory proteins p47(phox), p67(phox), and p40(phox); the small GTPase Rac binds to p67(phox) (or its homologous protein), which serves as a switch for Nox activation. Similarly, Rac activates the fungal NoxA via binding to the p67(phox)-like protein Nox regulator (NoxR). In plants, on the other hand, this GTPase directly interacts with the N-terminus of Rboh, leading to superoxide production. Here I describe the regulation of Nox-family oxidases on the basis of three-dimensional structures and evolutionary conservation."
18518821,Structural and functional relationships of the XPF/MUS81 family of proteins.,10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.070306.102408,"Proteins belonging to the XPF/MUS81 family play important roles in the repair of DNA lesions caused by UV-light or DNA cross-linking agents. Most eukaryotes have four family members that assemble into two distinct heterodimeric complexes, XPF-ERCC1 and MUS81-EME1. Each complex contains one catalytic and one noncatalytic subunit and exhibits endonuclease activity with a variety of 3'-flap or fork DNA structures. The catalytic subunits share a characteristic core containing an excision repair cross complementation group 4 (ERCC4) nuclease domain and a tandem helix-hairpin-helix (HhH)(2) domain. Diverged domains are present in the noncatalytic subunits and may be required for substrate targeting. Vertebrates possess two additional family members, FANCM and Fanconi anemia-associated protein 24 kDa (FAAP24), which possess inactive nuclease domains. Instead, FANCM contains a functional Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase domain that is required for DNA translocation. Determining how these enzymes recognize specific DNA substrates and promote key repair reactions is an important challenge for the future."
18549797,The biology of intestinal immunoglobulin A responses.,10.1016/j.immuni.2008.05.001,"The gut mucosa is exposed to a large community of commensal bacteria that are required for the processing of nutrients and the education of the local immune system. Conversely, the gut immune system generates innate and adaptive responses that shape the composition of the local microbiota. One striking feature of intestinal adaptive immunity is its ability to generate massive amounts of noninflammatory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies through multiple follicular and extrafollicular pathways that operate in the presence or absence of cognate T-B cell interactions. Here we discuss the role of intestinal IgA in host-commensal mutualism, immune protection, and tolerance and summarize recent advances on the role of innate immune cells in intestinal IgA production."

Studies of MAPK pathways in genetic model organisms are especially informative in revealing the molecular mechanisms by means of which MAPK cascades are controlled and modulate cellular processes. The present review highlights recent insights into MAPK-based signalling in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress), revealing the complexity and future challenges to understanding signal-transduction networks on a global scale."

Here we provide a catalog of available structural information for these three enzymes. Most structural data have been accumulated for Pol II and its functional complexes. These studies have provided insights into many aspects of the transcription mechanism, including initiation at promoter DNA, elongation of the mRNA chain, tunability of the polymerase active site, which supports RNA synthesis and cleavage, and the response of Pol II to DNA lesions. Detailed structural studies of Pol I and Pol III were reported recently and showed that the active center region and core enzymes are similar to Pol II and that strong structural differences on the surfaces account for gene class-specific functions."
18587410,Methanogenic archaea: ecologically relevant differences in energy conservation.,10.1038/nrmicro1931,"Most methanogenic archaea can reduce CO(2) with H(2) to methane, and it is generally assumed that the reactions and mechanisms of energy conservation that are involved are largely the same in all methanogens. However, this does not take into account the fact that methanogens with cytochromes have considerably higher growth yields and threshold concentrations for H(2) than methanogens without cytochromes. These and other differences can be explained by the proposal outlined in this Review that in methanogens with cytochromes, the first and last steps in methanogenesis from CO(2) are coupled chemiosmotically, whereas in methanogens without cytochromes, these steps are energetically coupled by a cytoplasmic enzyme complex that mediates flavin-based electron bifurcation."
18621892,Biosynthesis of a rare di-N-acetylated sugar in the lipopolysaccharides of both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bordetella pertussis occurs via an identical scheme despite different gene clusters.,10.1128/JB.00579-08,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bordetella pertussis produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that contains 2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-D-mannuronic acid (D-ManNAc3NAcA). A five-enzyme biosynthetic pathway that requires WbpA, WbpB, WbpE, WbpD, and WbpI has been proposed for the production of this sugar in P. aeruginosa, based on analysis of genes present in the B-band LPS biosynthesis cluster. In the analogous B. pertussis cluster, homologs of wbpB to wbpI were present, but a putative dehydrogenase gene was missing; therefore, the biosynthetic mechanism for UDP-D-ManNAc3NAcA was unclear. Nonpolar knockout mutants of each P. aeruginosa gene were constructed. Complementation analysis of the mutants demonstrated that B-band LPS production was restored to P. aeruginosa knockout mutants when the relevant B. pertussis genes were supplied in trans. Thus, the genes that encode the putative oxidase, transaminase, N-acetyltransferase, and epimerase enzymes in B. pertussis are functional homologs of those in P. aeruginosa. Two candidate dehydrogenase genes were located by searching the B. pertussis genome; these have 80% identity to P. aeruginosa wbpO (serotype O6) and 32% identity to wbpA (serotype O5). These genes, wbpO(1629) and wbpO(3150), were shown to complement a wbpA knockout of P. aeruginosa. Capillary electrophoresis was used to characterize the enzymatic activities of purified WbpO(1629) and WbpO(3150), and mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the two enzymes are dehydrogenases capable of converting UDP-D-GlcNAc, UDP-D-GalNAc, to a lesser extent, and UDP-D-Glc, to a much lesser extent. Together, these results suggest that B. pertussis produces UDP-D-ManNAc3NAcA through the same pathway proposed for P. aeruginosa, despite differences in the genomic context of the genes involved."
18621978,Identification of the wax ester synthase/acyl-coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase WSD1 required for stem wax ester biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.,10.1104/pp.108.123471,"Wax esters are neutral lipids composed of aliphatic alcohols and acids, with both moieties usually long-chain (C(16) and C(18)) or very-long-chain (C(20) and longer) carbon structures. They have diverse biological functions in bacteria, insects, mammals, and terrestrial plants and are also important substrates for a variety of industrial applications. In plants, wax esters are mostly found in the cuticles coating the primary shoot surfaces, but they also accumulate to high concentrations in the seed oils of a few plant species, including jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis), a desert shrub that is the major commercial source of these compounds. Here, we report the identification and characterization of WSD1, a member of the bifunctional wax ester synthase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene family, which plays a key role in wax ester synthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) stems, as first evidenced by severely reduced wax ester levels of in the stem wax of wsd1 mutants. In vitro assays using protein extracts from Escherichia coli expressing WSD1 showed that this enzyme has a high level of wax synthase activity and approximately 10-fold lower level of diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity. Expression of the WSD1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the accumulation of wax esters, but not triacylglycerol, indicating that WSD1 predominantly functions as a wax synthase. Analyses of WSD1 expression revealed that this gene is transcribed in flowers, top parts of stems, and leaves. Fully functional yellow fluorescent protein-tagged WSD1 protein was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, demonstrating that biosynthesis of wax esters, the final products of the alcohol-forming pathway, occurs in this subcellular compartment."
18627460,Biosynthesis of mycobacterial arabinogalactan: identification of a novel alpha(1-->3) arabinofuranosyltransferase.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06354.x,"The cell wall mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex is essential in mycobacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is the target of several antitubercular drugs. For instance, ethambutol targets arabinogalactan biosynthesis through inhibition of the arabinofuranosyltransferases Mt-EmbA and Mt-EmbB. A bioinformatics approach identified putative integral membrane proteins, MSMEG2785 in Mycobacterium smegmatis, Rv2673 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and NCgl1822 in Corynebacterium glutamicum, with 10 predicted transmembrane domains and a glycosyltransferase motif (DDX), features that are common to the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases. Deletion of M. smegmatis MSMEG2785 resulted in altered growth and glycosyl linkage analysis revealed the absence of AG alpha(1-->3)-linked arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. Complementation of the M. smegmatis deletion mutant was fully restored to a wild-type phenotype by MSMEG2785 and Rv2673, and as a result, we have now termed this previously uncharacterized open reading frame, arabinofuranosyltransferase C (aftC). Enzyme assays using the sugar donor beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryl-decaprenol (DPA) and a newly synthesized linear alpha(1-->5)-linked Ara(5) neoglycolipid acceptor together with chemical identification of products formed, clearly identified AftC as a branching alpha(1-->3) arabinofuranosyltransferase. This newly discovered glycosyltransferase sheds further light on the complexities of Mycobacterium cell wall biosynthesis, such as in M. tuberculosis and related species and represents a potential new drug target."
18635948,Mucolipidosis type IV: the importance of functional lysosomes for efficient autophagy.,10.4161/auto.6567,"Mucolipidosis IV (MLIV) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe neurological and ophthalmologic abnormalities. In contrast with most lysosomal storage disorders, which are attributed to the absence of specific lysosomal hydrolases, accumulation of material in MLIV results from defects in membrane transport along the late endocytic pathway. Mutations in MCOLN1 are the cause of MLIV; however, how the lack of MCOLN1 function ultimately leads to neurodegeneration remains largely unknown. We found that MCOLN1 is required for efficient fusion of both late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes. Impaired autophagosome degradation results in accumulation of autophagosomes in MLIV fibroblasts. In addition, we found increased levels and aggregation of p62, suggesting that abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated protein inclusions may contribute to the neurodegenerative phenotype observed in MLIV patients. These findings corroborate recent evidence indicating that defects in autophagy may be a common feature of many neurodegenerative disorders."
18647649,Clathrin-independent endocytosis: a unique platform for cell signaling and PM remodeling.,10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.06.020,"There is increasing interest in endocytosis that occurs independently of clathrin coats and the fates of membrane proteins internalized by this mechanism. The appearance of clathrin-independent endocytic and membrane recycling pathways seems to vary with different cell types and cargo molecules. In this review we focus on studies that have been performed using HeLa and COS cells as model systems for understanding this membrane trafficking system. These endosomal membranes contain signaling molecules including H-Ras, Rac1, Arf6 and Rab proteins, and a lipid environment rich in cholesterol and PIP(2) providing a unique platform for cell signaling. Furthermore, activation of some of these signaling molecules (H-Ras, Rac and Arf6) can switch the constitutive form of clathrin-independent endocytosis into a stimulated one, associated with PM ruffling and macropinocytosis."
1864846,Acyclic monoterpene primary alcohol:NADP+ oxidoreductase of Rauwolfia serpentina cells: the key enzyme in biosynthesis of monoterpene alcohols.,,"Acyclic monoterpene primary alcohol:NADP+ oxidoreductase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of monoterpene alcohols in plants, is unstable and has been only poorly characterized. However we have established conditions which stabilize the enzyme from Rauwolfia serpentina cells, and then purified it to homogeneity. It is a monomer with a molecular weight of about 44,000 and contains zinc ions. Various branched-chain allylic primary alcohols such as nerol, geraniol, and 10-hydroxygeraniol were substrates, but ethanol was inert. The enzyme exclusively requires NADP+ or NADPH as the cofactor. Steady-state kinetic studies showed that the nerol dehydrogenation proceeds by an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism. NADP+ binds the enzyme first and then NADPH is the second product released from it. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction products showed that 10-hydroxygeraniol undergoes a reversible dehydrogenation to produce 10-oxogeraniol or 10-hydroxygeranial, which are oxidized further to give 10-oxogeranial, the direct precursor of iridodial. The enzyme has been found to exclusively transfer the pro-R hydrogen of NADPH to neral. The N-terminal sequence of the first 21 amino acids revealed no significant homology with those of various other proteins including the NAD(P)(+)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases registered in a protein data bank."
18648803,Genetic organization of the putative salbostatin biosynthetic gene cluster including the 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase gene in Streptomyces albus ATCC 21838.,10.1007/s00253-008-1591-2,"The cyclization of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone, catalyzed by the 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthases, is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of C( 7 )N-aminocyclitol-containing natural products, such as validamycin and acarbose. These natural products contain in their structures a valienamine unit, which is important for their biological activity. The same core unit is also found in salbostatin, a related pseudodisaccharide that has strong trehalase inhibitory activity. In silico analysis of the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of salbostatin from Streptomyces albus ATCC 21838 revealed 20 open reading frames, including an acbC homolog gene (salQ), which is believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of salbostatin. The salQ gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the catalytic function of the recombinant protein was confirmed to be a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase. In addition, SalF, SalL, SalM, SalN, SalO, and SalR were found to be homologous to AcbR, AcbM, AcbL, AcbN, AcbO, and AcbP from the acarbose pathway, respectively, which suggests that the biosynthesis of C(7)N-aminocyclitol moiety of salbostatin may be very similar to that of acarbose."
18685108,Architecture and inherent robustness of a bacterial cell-cycle control system.,10.1073/pnas.0805258105,"A closed-loop control system drives progression of the coupled stalked and swarmer cell cycles of the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus in a near-mechanical step-like fashion. The cell-cycle control has a cyclical genetic circuit composed of four regulatory proteins with tight coupling to processive chromosome replication and cell division subsystems. We report a hybrid simulation of the coupled cell-cycle control system, including asymmetric cell division and responses to external starvation signals, that replicates mRNA and protein concentration patterns and is consistent with observed mutant phenotypes. An asynchronous sequential digital circuit model equivalent to the validated simulation model was created. Formal model-checking analysis of the digital circuit showed that the cell-cycle control is robust to intrinsic stochastic variations in reaction rates and nutrient supply, and that it reliably stops and restarts to accommodate nutrient starvation. Model checking also showed that mechanisms involving methylation-state changes in regulatory promoter regions during DNA replication increase the robustness of the cell-cycle control. The hybrid cell-cycle simulation implementation is inherently extensible and provides a promising approach for development of whole-cell behavioral models that can replicate the observed functionality of the cell and its responses to changing environmental conditions."
18685225,Arabidopsis CYP85A2 catalyzes lactonization reactions in the biosynthesis of 2-deoxy-7-oxalactone brassinosteroids.,10.1271/bbb.80192,"Brassinolide (BL), a plant 7-oxalactone-type steroid hormone, is one of the active brassinosteroids (BRs) that regulates plant growth and development. BL is biosynthesized from castasterone by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP85A2. We showed that a Pichia pastoris transformant that synchronously expresses Arabidopsis P450 reductase gene ATR1 and P450 gene CYP85A2 converts teasterone and typhasterol to 7-oxateasterone and 7-oxatyphasterol, respectively. Thus, CYP85A2 catalyzes the lactonization reactions of not only castasterone but also teasterone and typhasterol. The two 2-deoxy-7-oxalactone-type BRs were identified in Arabidopsis plants. Although the reversible conversion between 7-oxateasterone and 7-oxatyphasterol was observed in vivo, no conversion of 7-oxatyphasterol to BL was observed. The biological activity of 7-oxatyphasterol toward Arabidopsis hypocotyl elongation was nearly the same as that of castasterone. These results suggest that a new BR biosynthetic pathway, a BR lactonization pathway, functions in Arabidopsis and plays an important role in regulating the concentration of active BRs, even though the metabolism of 7-oxatyphasterol to BL is still unknown."

18692429,Ethylene signaling: new levels of complexity and regulation.,10.1016/j.pbi.2008.06.011,"The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays important roles in plant growth and development. Recent discoveries have expanded our linear view of ethylene signaling by revealing an elaborate signaling network with multiple regulatory circuits. At the membrane, the ethylene receptors form heteromeric and higher order complexes providing enhanced sensitivity and fine-tuning of signaling. Ethylene sensitivity is further enhanced by the rapid degradation of ethylene receptors upon ethylene binding and by dependence on a novel protein REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY1 (RTE1)/GREEN-RIPE (GR). In the nucleus, EIN3-BINDING F-BOX1 and 2 (EBF1/2) coordinately control 26S proteasome degradation of the critical transcription factors EIN3 and EIL1. EBF1/2 expression is repressed by ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE5 (EIN5), which encodes the exoribonuclease XRN4. Additionally, EIN3 possesses two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation sites that have opposing effects on EIN3 stability."
18708085,Signaling by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR): studies on the GnRH receptor.,10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.07.001,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the first key hormone of reproduction. GnRH analogs are extensively used in in vitro fertilization, and treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers, due to their ability to bring about 'chemical castration'. The interaction of GnRH with its cognate type I receptor (GnRHR) in pituitary gonadotropes results in the activation of Gq/G(11), phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbetaI), PLA(2), and PLD. Sequential activation of the phospholipases generates the second messengers inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), diacylglycerol (DAG), and arachidonic acid (AA), which are required for Ca(2+) mobilization, the activation of various protein kinase C isoforms (PKCs), and the production of prostaglandin (PG) and other metabolites of AA, respectively. PKC isoforms are the major mediators of the downstream activation of a number of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades by GnRH, namely: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38MAPK. The activated MAPKs phosphorylate both cytosolic and nuclear proteins to initiate the transcriptional activation of the gonadotropin subunit genes and the GnRHR. While Ca(2+) mobilization has been found to initiate rapid gonadotropin secretion, Ca(2+), together with various PKC isoforms, MAPKs and AA metabolites also serve as key nodes, in the GnRH-stimulated signaling network that enables the gonadotropes to decode GnRH pulse frequencies and translating that into differential gonadotropin synthesis and release. Even though pulsatility of GnRH is recognized as a major determinant for differential gonadotropin subunit gene expression and gonadotropin secretion very little is yet known about the signaling circuits governing GnRH action at the 'Systems Biology' level. Direct apoptotic and metastatic effects of GnRH analogs in gonadal steroid-dependent cancers expressing the GnRHR also seem to be mediated by the activation of the PKC/MAPK pathways. However, the mechanisms dictating life (pituitary) vs. death (cancer) decisions made by the same GnRHR remain elusive. Understanding these molecular mechanisms triggered by the GnRHR through biochemical and 'Systems Biology' approaches would provide the basis for the construction of the dynamic connectivity maps, which operate in the various cell types (endocrine, cancer, and immune system) targeted by GnRH. The connectivity maps will open a new vista for exploring the direct effects of GnRH analogs in tumors and the design of novel combined therapies for fertility control, reproductive disorders and cancers."

The NA crystal structure from the 1918 ""Spanish flu"" (A/Brevig Mission/1/18 H1N1) and that of its complex with zanamivir (Relenza) at 1.65-A and 1.45-A resolutions, respectively, corroborated the successful expression of correctly folded NA tetramers in a baculovirus expression system. An additional cavity adjacent to the substrate-binding site is observed in N1, compared to N2 and N9 NAs, including H5N1. This cavity arises from an open conformation of the 150 loop (Gly147 to Asp151) and appears to be conserved among group 1 NAs (N1, N4, N5, and N8). It closes upon zanamivir binding. Three calcium sites were identified, including a novel site that may be conserved in N1 and N4. Thus, these high-resolution structures, combined with our recombinant expression system, provide new opportunities to augment the limited arsenal of therapeutics against influenza."

We demonstrate this transition to be controlled by mutual inhibition of the FlhDC/motility and sigma(S)/adhesion control cascades at two distinct hierarchical levels. At the top level, motility gene expression and the general stress response are inversely coordinated by sigma(70)/sigma(FliA)/sigma(S) competition for core RNA polymerase and the FlhDC-controlled FliZ protein acting as a sigma(S) inhibitor. At a lower level, the signaling molecule bis-(3'-5')-cyclic-diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) reduces flagellar activity and stimulates transcription of csgD, which encodes an essential activator of adhesive curli fimbriae expression. This c-di-GMP is antagonistically controlled by sigma(S)-regulated GGDEF proteins (mainly YegE) and YhjH, an EAL protein and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase under FlhDC/FliA control. The switch from motility-based foraging to the general stress response and curli expression requires sigma(S)-modulated down-regulation of expression of the flagellar regulatory cascade as well as proteolysis of the flagellar master regulator FlhDC. Control of YhjH by FlhDC and of YegE by sigma(S) produces a fine-tuned checkpoint system that ""unlocks"" curli expression only after down-regulation of flagellar gene expression. In summary, these data reveal the logic and sequence of molecular events underlying the motile-to-adhesive ""lifestyle"" switch in E. coli."
18774298,The three adaptation systems of Bacillus subtilis chemotaxis.,10.1016/j.tim.2008.07.003,"Adaptation has a crucial role in the gradient-sensing mechanism that underlies bacterial chemotaxis. The Escherichia coli chemotaxis pathway uses a single adaptation system involving reversible receptor methylation. In Bacillus subtilis, the chemotaxis pathway seems to use three adaptation systems. One involves reversible receptor methylation, although quite differently than in E. coli. The other two involve CheC, CheD and CheV, which are chemotaxis proteins not found in E. coli. Remarkably, no one system is absolutely required for adaptation or is independently capable of generating adaptation. In this review, we discuss these three novel adaptation systems in B. subtilis and propose a model for their integration."
18802415,The genetics of mammalian circadian order and disorder: implications for physiology and disease.,10.1038/nrg2430,"Circadian cycles affect a variety of physiological processes, and disruptions of normal circadian biology therefore have the potential to influence a range of disease-related pathways. The genetic basis of circadian rhythms is well studied in model organisms and, more recently, studies of the genetic basis of circadian disorders has confirmed the conservation of key players in circadian biology from invertebrates to humans. In addition, important advances have been made in understanding how these molecules influence physiological functions in tissues throughout the body. Together, these studies set the scene for applying our knowledge of circadian biology to the understanding and treatment of a range of human diseases, including cancer and metabolic and behavioural disorders."
18819910,Ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides defines a new subclade of coenzyme B12-dependent acyl-CoA mutases.,10.1074/jbc.M805527200,"Coenzyme B(12)-dependent mutases are radical enzymes that catalyze reversible carbon skeleton rearrangement reactions. Here we describe Rhodobacter sphaeroides ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Ecm), a novel member of the family of coenzyme B(12)-dependent acyl-CoA mutases, that operates in the recently discovered ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for acetate assimilation. Ecm is involved in the central reaction sequence of this novel pathway and catalyzes the transformation of ethylmalonyl-CoA to methylsuccinyl-CoA in combination with a second enzyme that was further identified as promiscuous ethylmalonyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase. In contrast to the epimerase, Ecm is highly specific for its substrate, ethylmalonyl-CoA, and accepts methylmalonyl-CoA only at 0.2% relative activity. Sequence analysis revealed that Ecm is distinct from (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase as well as isobutyryl-CoA mutase and defines a new subfamily of coenzyme B(12)-dependent acyl-CoA mutases. In combination with molecular modeling, two signature sequences were identified that presumably contribute to the substrate specificity of these enzymes."

One response following intestinal colonization is the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) A by B cells present in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the sites, mechanisms, and functions of intestinal IgA synthesis. We discuss here the pathways leading to IgA production, in organized structures as well as nonorganized tissues, by T-dependent as well as T-independent mechanisms. In addition, we discuss new insights into the role of gut IgA in the regulation of bacterial communities and maintenance of immune homeostasis."
18929068,Sulfur metabolism in phototrophic sulfur bacteria.,10.1016/S0065-2911(08)00002-7,"Phototrophic sulfur bacteria are characterized by oxidizing various inorganic sulfur compounds for use as electron donors in carbon dioxide fixation during anoxygenic photosynthetic growth. These bacteria are divided into the purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) and the green sulfur bacteria (GSB). They utilize various combinations of sulfide, elemental sulfur, and thiosulfate and sometimes also ferrous iron and hydrogen as electron donors. This review focuses on the dissimilatory and assimilatory metabolism of inorganic sulfur compounds in these bacteria and also briefly discusses these metabolisms in other types of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria. The biochemistry and genetics of sulfur compound oxidation in PSB and GSB are described in detail. A variety of enzymes catalyzing sulfur oxidation reactions have been isolated from GSB and PSB (especially Allochromatium vinosum, a representative of the Chromatiaceae), and many are well characterized also on a molecular genetic level. Complete genome sequence data are currently available for 10 strains of GSB and for one strain of PSB. We present here a genome-based survey of the distribution and phylogenies of genes involved in oxidation of sulfur compounds in these strains. It is evident from biochemical and genetic analyses that the dissimilatory sulfur metabolism of these organisms is very complex and incompletely understood. This metabolism is modular in the sense that individual steps in the metabolism may be performed by different enzymes in different organisms. Despite the distant evolutionary relationship between GSB and PSB, their photosynthetic nature and their dependency on oxidation of sulfur compounds resulted in similar ecological roles in the sulfur cycle as important anaerobic oxidizers of sulfur compounds."
18990184,The diverse CheC-type phosphatases: chemotaxis and beyond.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06482.x,"A new class of protein phosphatases has emerged in the study of bacterial/archaeal chemotaxis, the CheC-type phosphatases. These proteins are distinct and unrelated to the well-known CheY-P phosphatase CheZ, though they have convergently evolved to dephosphorylate the same target. The family contains a common consensus sequence D/S-X(3)-E-X(2)-N-X(22)-P that defines the phosphatase active site, of which there are often two per protein. Three distinct subgroups make up the family: CheC, FliY and CheX. Further, the CheC subgroup can be divided into three classes. Bacillus subtilis CheC typifies the first class and might function as a regulator of CheD. Class II CheCs likely function as phosphatases in systems other than chemotaxis. Class III CheCs are found in the archaeal class Halobacteria and might function as class I CheCs. FliY is the main phosphatase in the B. subtilis chemotaxis system. CheX is quite divergent from the rest of the family, forms a dimer and some may function outside chemotaxis. A model for the evolution of the family is discussed."
19007773,Ubiquitin in trafficking: the network at work.,10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.10.014,"Targeting of membrane proteins to their proper destination requires specific mechanisms. Protein cargos are included in vesicles that bud off a donor organelle and ultimately fuse with a target organelle, where the cargos are delivered. Endocytosis of transmembrane receptors (e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases, RTKs) follows a common scheme that consists of an internalization reaction and a delivery step, during which cargos are transferred to an endosomal station to be either directed to the lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the cell surface. At each stage along the endocytic route, short motifs within protein cargos and/or post-translational modifications regulate transmembrane receptor sorting. In recent years, studies have shown that ubiquitination acts as a signal for the internalization and sorting of plasma membrane proteins. Here, we present an overview of ubiquitin's role as a 'signal' for intracellular trafficking and give examples of the multifaced mechanisms of ubiquitin-regulated RTK endocytosis."
19016485,Simultaneous synthesis of 2-phenylethanol and L-homophenylalanine using aromatic transaminase with yeast Ehrlich pathway.,10.1002/bit.22178,"2-Phenylethanol is a widely used aroma compound with rose-like fragrance and L-homophenylalanine is a building block of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. 2-phenylethanol and L-homophenylalanine were synthesized simultaneously with high yield from 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid and L-phenylalanine, respectively. A recombinant Escherichia coli harboring a coupled reaction pathway comprising of aromatic transaminase, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, carbonyl reductase, and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was constructed. In the coupled reaction pathway, the transaminase reaction was coupled with the Ehrlich pathway of yeast; (1) a phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (YDR380W) as the enzyme to generate the substrate for the carbonyl reductase from phenylpyruvate (i.e., byproduct of the transaminase reaction) and to shift the reaction equilibrium of the transaminase reaction, and (2) a carbonyl reductase (YGL157W) to produce the 2-phenylethanol. Selecting the right carbonyl reductase showing the highest activity on phenylacetaldehyde with narrow substrate specificity was the key to success of the constructing the coupling reaction. In addition, NADPH regeneration was achieved by incorporating the GDH from Bacillus subtilis in the coupled reaction pathway. Based on 40 mM of L-phenylalanine used, about 96% final product conversion yield of 2-phenylethanol was achieved using the recombinant E. coli."

19051051,Accumulation of an organic anticancer selenium compound in a transgenic Solanaceous species shows wider applicability of the selenocysteine methyltransferase transgene from selenium hyperaccumulators.,10.1007/s11248-008-9233-0,"Tolerance to high selenium (Se) soils in Se-hyperaccumulating plant species is correlated with the ability to biosynthesise methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys), due to the activity of selenocysteine methyltransferase (SMT). In mammals, inclusion of MeSeCys in the diet reduces the incidence of certain cancers, so increasing the range of crop plants that can produce this compound is an attractive biotechnology target. However, in the non-Se accumulator Arabidopsis, overexpression of SMT does not result in biosynthesis of MeSeCys from selenate because the rate at which selenate is reduced to selenite by ATP sulfurylase (ATPS) is low. This limitation is less problematic in other species of the Brassicaceae that can produce MeSeCys naturally. We investigated the potential for biosynthesis of MeSeCys in other plant families using Nicotiana tabacum L., a member of the Solanaceae. When plants were watered with 200 microM selenate, overexpression of a SMT transgene caused a 2- to 4-fold increase in Se accumulation (resulting in increased numbers of leaf lesions and areas of necrosis), production of MeSeCys (up to 20% of total Se) and generation of volatile dimethyl diselenide derived directly from MeSeCys. Despite the greatly increased accumulation of total Se, this did not result in increased Se toxicity effects on growth. Overexpression of ATPS did not increase Se accumulation from selenate. Accordingly, lines overexpressing both ATPS and SMT did not show a further increase in total Se accumulation or in leaf toxicity symptoms relative to overexpression of SMT alone, but directed a greater proportion of Se into MeSeCys. This work demonstrates that the production of the cancer-preventing compound MeSeCys in plants outside the Brassicaceae is possible. We conclude that while the SMT gene from Se hyperaccumulators can probably be utilised universally to increase the metabolism of Se into MeSeCys, the effects of enhancing ATPS activity will vary depending on the species involved."
19053436,PhzA/B catalyzes the formation of the tricycle in phenazine biosynthesis.,10.1021/ja806325k,"Phenazines are redox-active bacterial secondary metabolites that participate in important biological processes such as the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species and the reduction of environmental iron. Their biosynthesis from chorismic acid depends on enzymes encoded by the phz operon, but many details of the pathway remain unclear. It previously was shown that phenazine biosynthesis involves the symmetrical head-to-tail double condensation of two identical amino-cyclohexenone molecules to a tricyclic phenazine precursor. While this key step can proceed spontaneously in vitro, we show here that it is catalyzed by PhzA/B, a small dimeric protein of the Delta(5)-3-ketosteroid isomerase/nuclear transport factor 2 family, and we reason that this catalysis is required in vivo. Crystal structures in complex with analogues of the substrate and product suggest that PhzA/B accelerates double imine formation by orienting two substrate molecules and by neutralizing the negative charge of tetrahedral intermediates through protonation. HPLC-coupled NMR reveals that the condensation product rearranges further, which is probably important to prevent back-hydrolysis, and may also be catalyzed within the active site of PhzA/B. The rearranged tricyclic product subsequently undergoes oxidative decarboxylation in a metal-independent reaction involving molecular oxygen. This conversion does not seem to require enzymatic catalysis, explaining why phenazine-1-carboxylic acid is a major product even in strains that use phenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid as a precursor of strain-specific phenazine derivatives."
19053721,Syntheses of the P-methylase substrates of the bialaphos biosynthetic pathway.,10.1021/ol802269x,"Genetic studies suggest that either N-acetyldemethyl phosphinothricin (1, N-AcDMPT) or N-acetyldemethyl phosphinothricin tripeptide (2, N-AcDMPTT) is the substrate for the P-methylation reaction in the biosynthesis of phosphinothricin tripeptide (PTT), which is widely used as an herbicide. To study the mechanism for this unique P-methylation reaction catalyzed by the BcpD protein and the functions of the unusual nonribosomal peptide synthetases involved in PTT biosynthesis, this work reports the chemical syntheses of 1 and 2."
1906464,Location of the mycolyl ester substituents in the cell walls of mycobacteria.,,"The question of the precise location of mycolic acids, the single most distinctive cell wall entity of members of the Mycobacterium genus, has now been addressed. The free hydroxyl functions of the arabinogalactan component of the mycobacterial cell wall were O-methylated under conditions in which the mycolyl esters were not cleaved. Subsequent replacement of the mycolyl functions with O-ethyl groups resulted in an acid- and base-stable differentially O-alkylated surrogate polysaccharide, more amenable to analysis. Complete hydrolysis, reduction, acetylation, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed the unexpected finding that the mycolyl substituents were selectively and equally distributed on the 5-hydroxyl functions of terminal- and 2-linked arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. Further analysis of the O-alkylated cell wall through partial acid hydrolysis, NaB[2H]4 reduction, pentadeuterioethylation, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry demonstrated that the mycolyl units are clustered in groups of four on the previously recognized nonreducing terminal pentaarabinosyl unit [beta-Araf-(1----2)-alpha-Araf)2-3, 5-alpha-Araf. However, only about two-thirds of the available pentasaccharide units are so substituted. Thus, the antigenicity of the arabinan component of mycobacterial cell walls may be explained by the fact that about one-third of the pentaarabinosyl units are not mycolyated and are available for interaction with the immune system. On the other hand, the extreme hydrophobicity and impenetrability of the mycobacterial cell may be explained by the same motif also acting as the fulerum for massive esterified paraffin residues. New fundamental information on the structure of mycobacterial cell walls will aid in our comprehension of its impenetrability to antibiotics and role in immunopathogenesis and persistence of disease."
19079156,The immune geography of IgA induction and function.,10.1038/mi.2007.6,"The production of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in mammals exceeds all other isotypes, and it is mostly exported across mucous membranes. The discovery of IgA and the realization that it dominates humoral mucosal immunity, in contrast to the IgG dominance of the systemic immune system, was early evidence for the distinct nature of mucosal immunology. It is now clear that IgA can function in high-affinity modes for neutralization of toxins and pathogenic microbes, and as a low-affinity system to contain the dense commensal microbiota within the intestinal lumen. The basic map of induction of IgA B cells in the Peyer's patches, which then circulate through the lymph and bloodstream to seed the mucosa with precursors of plasma cells that produce dimeric IgA for export through the intestinal epithelium, has been known for more than 30 years. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying selective IgA induction of mucosal B cells for IgA production and the immune geography of their homing characteristics. We also review the functionality of secretory IgA directed against both commensal organisms and pathogens."
19079167,Differentiation and homing of IgA-secreting cells.,10.1038/mi.2007.14,"Most antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in mucosal tissues produce immunoglobulin A (IgA), the most abundant immunoglobulin in the body and the main class of antibody found in secretions. IgA-ASCs differentiate in the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues and are usually considered as a homogeneous population of cells. However, IgA-ASCs that travel to the small intestine have unique characteristics in terms of their migratory requirements. These IgA-ASCs require the homing molecules alpha4beta7 and CCR9 to interact with their ligands, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 and CCL25, which are constitutively expressed in the small intestine. Indeed, recent work has shown that IgA-ASCs specific for the small bowel are generated under different conditions as compared with IgA-ASCs in other mucosal compartments. Moreover, the mechanisms inducing IgA class switching may also vary according to the tissue where IgA-ASCs differentiate. Here we describe the mechanisms involved in the differentiation of IgA-ASCs in mucosal compartments, in particular those involved in the generation of gut-homing IgA-ASCs."
19101977,"Biosynthetic gene cluster of cetoniacytone A, an unusual aminocyclitol from the endosymbiotic Bacterium Actinomyces sp. Lu 9419.",10.1002/cbic.200800527,"A gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the antitumor agent cetoniacytone A was identified in Actinomyces sp. strain Lu 9419, an endosymbiotic bacterium isolated from the intestines of the rose chafer beetle (Cetonia aurata). The nucleotide sequence analysis of the 46 kb DNA region revealed the presence of 31 complete ORFs, including genes predicted to encode a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (CetA), a glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein (CetB), an acyltransferase (CetD), an FAD-dependent dehydrogenase (CetF2), two oxidoreductases (CetF1 and CetG), two aminotransferases (CetH and CetM), and a pyranose oxidase (CetL). CetA has previously been demonstrated to catalyze the cyclization of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to the cyclic intermediate, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone. In this report, the glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein homolog CetB was identified as a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone epimerase (EVE), a new member of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily. The 24 kDa recombinant histidine-tagged CetB was found to form a homodimer; each monomer contains two betaalphabetabetabeta scaffolds that form a metal binding site with two histidine and two glutamic acid residues. A BLAST search using the newly isolated cet biosynthetic genes revealed an analogous suite of genes in the genome of Frankia alni ACN14a, suggesting that this plant symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium is capable of producing a secondary metabolite related to the cetoniacytones."
19138128,Identification and characterization of the Staphylococcus aureus gene cluster coding for staphyloferrin A.,10.1021/bi801844c,"Siderophores are key virulence factors that allow bacteria to grow in iron-restricted environments. The Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is known to produce four siderophores for which genetic and/or structural data are unknown. Here we characterize the gene cluster responsible for producing the prevalent siderophore staphyloferrin A. In addition to expressing the cluster in the heterologous host Escherichia coli, which confers the ability to synthesize the siderophore, we reconstituted staphyloferrin A biosynthesis in vitro by expressing and purifying two key enzymes in the pathway. As with other polycarboxylate siderophores, staphyloferrin A is biosynthesized using the recently described nonribosomal peptide synthetase independent siderophore (NIS) biosynthetic pathway. Two NIS synthetases condense two molecules of citric acid to d-ornithine in a stepwise ordered process with SfnaD using the delta-amine as a nucleophile to form the first amide followed by SfnaB utilizing the alpha-amine to complete staphyloferrin A synthesis."
19151091,Mechanistic characterization of the sulfur-relay system for eukaryotic 2-thiouridine biogenesis at tRNA wobble positions.,10.1093/nar/gkn1023,"The wobble modification in tRNAs, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm(5)s(2)U), is required for the proper decoding of NNR codons in eukaryotes. The 2-thio group confers conformational rigidity of mcm(5)s(2)U by largely fixing the C3'-endo ribose puckering, ensuring stable and accurate codon-anticodon pairing. We have identified five genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, YIL008w (URM1), YHR111w (UBA4), YOR251c (TUM1), YNL119w (NCS2) and YGL211w (NCS6), that are required for 2-thiolation of mcm(5)s(2)U. An in vitro sulfur transfer experiment revealed that Tum1p stimulated the cysteine desulfurase of Nfs1p, and accepted persulfide sulfurs from Nfs1p. URM1 is a ubiquitin-related modifier, and UBA4 is an E1-like enzyme involved in protein urmylation. The carboxy-terminus of Urm1p was activated as an acyl-adenylate (-COAMP), then thiocarboxylated (-COSH) by Uba4p. The activated thiocarboxylate can be utilized in the subsequent reactions for 2-thiouridine formation, mediated by Ncs2p/Ncs6p. We could successfully reconstitute the 2-thiouridine formation in vitro using recombinant proteins. This study revealed that 2-thiouridine formation shares a pathway and chemical reactions with protein urmylation. The sulfur-flow of eukaryotic 2-thiouridine formation is distinct mechanism from the bacterial sulfur-relay system which is based on the persulfide chemistry."

These effectors act in concert to subvert the host cell cytoskeleton, signal transduction pathways, membrane trafficking and pro-inflammatory responses. This allows Salmonella to invade non-phagocytic epithelial cells, establish and maintain an intracellular replicative niche and, in some cases, disseminate to cause systemic disease. This review focuses on the actions of the effectors on their host cell targets during each stage of Salmonella infection."
19185531,Translocated effectors of Yersinia.,10.1016/j.mib.2008.12.005,"Currently, all known translocated effectors of Yersinia are delivered into host cells by type III secretion systems (T3SSs). Pathogenic Yersinia maintain the plasmid-encoded Ysc T3SS for the specific delivery of the well-studied Yop effectors. New horizons for effector biology have opened with the discovery of the Ysps of Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B, which are translocated into host cells by the chromosome-endoded Ysa T3SS. The reported arsenal of effectors is likely to expand since genomic analysis has revealed gene-clusters in some Yersinia that code for other T3SSs. These efforts also revealed possible type VI secretion (T6S) systems, which may indicate that translocation of effectors occurs by multiple mechanisms."
19203648,Diversity in bacterial chemotactic responses and niche adaptation.,10.1016/S0065-2164(08)00803-4,"The ability of microbes to rapidly sense and adapt to environmental changes plays a major role in structuring microbial communities, in affecting microbial activities, as well as in influencing various microbial interactions with the surroundings. The bacterial chemotaxis signal transduction system is the sensory perception system that allows motile cells to respond optimally to changes in environmental conditions by allowing cells to navigate in gradients of diverse physicochemical parameters that can affect their metabolism. The analysis of complete genome sequences from microorganisms that occupy diverse ecological niches reveal the presence of multiple chemotaxis pathways and a great diversity of chemoreceptors with novel sensory specificities. Owing to its role in mediating rapid responses of bacteria to changes in the surroundings, bacterial chemotaxis is a behavior of interest in applied microbiology as it offers a unique opportunity for understanding the environmental cues that contribute to the survival of bacteria. This chapter explores the diversity of bacterial chemotaxis and suggests how gaining further insights into such diversity may potentially impact future drug and pesticides development and could inform bioremediation strategies."

Mutations in seven candidate genes coding for five desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, desmoplakin, desmoglein-2, desmocollin-2), for the cardiac ryanodine receptor-2, for the transforming growth factor beta-3, and for the transmembrane protein 43, respectively, are pathogenetically important. A typical feature of the disease is the replacement of the right ventricular myocardium by fibrofatty infiltrates, leading to electrical instability including ventricular arrhythmias in the early stages, and reduced contractility and heart failure later on. The left ventricle may also be involved. Unfortunately, the disease is often diagnosed post mortem only, especially in young adults dying suddenly during exercise. Since the disease is inherited in up to 50% of cases, the screening of relatives is important. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator is an important therapeutic tool. Nevertheless, the mortality of the disease remains to be 2%-4% per year. Several clinical, electrocardiographic, and imaging parameters were identified as risk predictors for an adverse outcome. In this paper, we describe distinct clinical presentations of ARVC/D, review the genetic background of the disease, and discuss its diagnosis and treatment."
19211038,Participation in aflatoxin biosynthesis by a reductase enzyme encoded by vrdA gene outside the aflatoxin gene cluster.,10.1016/j.fgb.2008.12.005,"Three reactions from hydroxyversicolorone to versicolorone, from versiconal hemiacetal acetate to versiconol acetate, and from versiconal to versiconol are involved in a metabolic grid in aflatoxin biosynthesis. This work demonstrated that the same reductase of Aspergillus parasiticus catalyzes the three reactions. The gene (named vrdA) encoding the reductase was cloned, and its sequence did not show homology to any regions in aflatoxin gene cluster. Its cDNA encoding a 38,566Da protein was separated by three introns in the genome. Deletion of the vrdA gene in A. parasiticus caused a significant decrease in enzyme activity, but did not affect aflatoxin productivity of the fungi. Although the vrdA gene was expressed in culture conditions conducive to aflatoxin production, it was expressed even in the aflR deletion mutant. These results suggest that the vrdA is not an aflatoxin biosynthesis gene, although it actually participates in aflatoxin biosynthesis in cells."

Whereas most RNP enzymes are stable in composition and harbor preformed active sites, the spliceosome, which removes noncoding introns from precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs), follows fundamentally different strategies. In order to provide both accuracy to the recognition of reactive splice sites in the pre-mRNA and flexibility to the choice of splice sites during alternative splicing, the spliceosome exhibits exceptional compositional and structural dynamics that are exploited during substrate-dependent complex assembly, catalytic activation, and active site remodeling."
19239894,The many pathways of RNA degradation.,10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.019,"From the earliest comparisons of RNA production with steady-state levels, it has been clear that cells transcribe more RNA than they accumulate, implying the existence of active RNA degradation systems. In general, RNA is degraded at the end of its useful life, which is long for a ribosomal RNA but very short for excised introns or spacer fragments, and is closely regulated for most mRNA species. RNA molecules with defects in processing, folding, or assembly with proteins are identified and rapidly degraded by the surveillance machinery. Because RNA degradation is ubiquitous in all cells, it is clear that it must be carefully controlled to accurately recognize target RNAs. How this is achieved is perhaps the most pressing question in the field."
19246239,Single domain response regulators: molecular switches with emerging roles in cell organization and dynamics.,10.1016/j.mib.2009.01.010,"Single domain response regulators (SD-RRs) are signaling components of two-component phosphorylation pathways that harbor a phosphoryl receiver domain but lack a dedicated output domain. The Escherichia coli protein CheY, the paradigm member of this family, regulates chemotaxis by relaying information between chemoreceptors and the flagellar motor switch. New data provide a more complex picture of CheY-mediated motility control in several bacteria and suggest diverging mechanisms in control of cellular motors. Moreover, advances have been made in understanding cellular functions of SD-RRs beyond chemotaxis. We review recent reports indicating that SD-RRs constitute a family of versatile molecular switches that contribute to cellular organization and dynamics as spatial organizer and/or as allosteric regulators of histidine protein kinases."

These bacteria derive their energy for growth from the conversion of ammonium and nitrite into dinitrogen gas in the complete absence of oxygen. These slowly growing microorganisms belong to the order Brocadiales and are affiliated to the Planctomycetes. Anammox bacteria are characterized by a compartmentalized cell architecture featuring a central cell compartment, the ""anammoxosome"". Thus far unique ""ladderane"" lipid molecules have been identified as part of their membrane systems surrounding the different cellular compartments. Nitrogen formation seems to involve the intermediary formation of hydrazine, a very reactive and toxic compound. The genome of the anammox bacterium Kuenenia stuttgartiensis was assembled from a complex microbial community grown in a sequencing batch reactor (74% enriched in this bacterium) using a metagenomics approach. The assembled genome allowed the in silico reconstruction of the anammox metabolism and identification of genes most likely involved in the process. The present anammox pathway is the only one consistent with the available experimental data, thermodynamically and biochemically feasible, and consistent with Ockham's razor: it invokes minimum biochemical novelty and requires the fewest number of biochemical reactions. The worldwide presence of anammox bacteria has now been established in many oxygen-limited marine and freshwater systems, including oceans, seas, estuaries, marshes, rivers and large lakes. In the marine environment over 50% of the N(2) gas released may be produced by anammox bacteria. Application of the anammox process offers an attractive alternative to current wastewater treatment systems for the removal of ammonia-nitrogen. Currently, at least five full scale reactor systems are operational."
19258320,Curcuminoid biosynthesis by two type III polyketide synthases in the herb Curcuma longa.,10.1074/jbc.M900070200,"Curcuminoids found in the rhizome of turmeric, Curcuma longa, possess various biological activities. Despite much attention regarding the biosynthesis of curcuminoids because of their pharmaceutically important properties and biosynthetically intriguing structures, no enzyme systems have been elucidated. Here we propose a pathway for curcuminoid biosynthesis in the herb C. longa, which includes two novel type III polyketide synthases. One of the type III polyketide synthases, named diketide-CoA synthase (DCS), catalyzed the formation of feruloyldiketide-CoA by condensing feruloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The other, named curcumin synthase (CURS), catalyzed the in vitro formation of curcuminoids from cinnamoyldiketide-N-acetylcysteamine (a mimic of the CoA ester) and feruloyl-CoA. Co-incubation of DCS and CURS in the presence of feruloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA yielded curcumin at high efficiency, although CURS itself possessed low activity for the synthesis of curcumin from feruloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. These findings thus revealed the curcumin biosynthetic route in turmeric, in which DCS synthesizes feruloyldiketide-CoA, and CURS then converts the diketide-CoA esters into a curcuminoid scaffold."
19277700,Regulated acid-base transport in the collecting duct.,10.1007/s00424-009-0657-z,"The renal collecting system serves the fine-tuning of renal acid-base secretion. Acid-secretory type-A intercalated cells secrete protons via a luminally expressed V-type H(+)-ATPase and generate new bicarbonate released by basolateral chloride/bicarbonate exchangers including the AE1 anion exchanger. Efficient proton secretion depends both on the presence of titratable acids (mainly phosphate) and the concomitant secretion of ammonia being titrated to ammonium. Collecting duct ammonium excretion requires the Rhesus protein RhCG as indicated by recent KO studies. Urinary acid secretion by type-A intercalated cells is strongly regulated by various factors among them acid-base status, angiotensin II and aldosterone, and the Calcium-sensing receptor. Moreover, urinary acidification by H(+)-ATPases is modulated indirectly by the activity of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC. Bicarbonate secretion is achieved by non-type-A intercalated cells characterized by the luminal expression of the chloride/bicarbonate exchanger pendrin. Pendrin activity is driven by H(+)-ATPases and may serve both bicarbonate excretion and chloride reabsorption. The activity and expression of pendrin is regulated by different factors including acid-base status, chloride delivery, and angiotensin II and may play a role in NaCl retention and blood pressure regulation. Finally, the relative abundance of type-A and non-type-A intercalated cells may be tightly regulated. Dysregulation of intercalated cell function or abundance causes various syndromes of distal renal tubular acidosis underlining the importance of these processes for acid-base homeostasis."
19287449,Principles of c-di-GMP signalling in bacteria.,10.1038/nrmicro2109,"On the stage of bacterial signal transduction and regulation, bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) has long played the part of Sleeping Beauty. c-di-GMP was first described in 1987, but only recently was it recognized that the enzymes that 'make and break' it are not only ubiquitous in the bacterial world, but are found in many species in huge numbers. As a key player in the decision between the motile planktonic and sedentary biofilm-associated bacterial 'lifestyles', c-di-GMP binds to an unprecedented range of effector components and controls diverse targets, including transcription, the activities of enzymes and larger cellular structures. This Review focuses on emerging principles of c-di-GMP signalling using selected systems in different bacteria as examples."
19296488,Cytoskeleton rearrangements during Listeria infection: clathrin and septins as new players in the game.,10.1002/cm.20353,"The study of an infection process can reveal how microbes exploit the host, and can illuminate unknown host cellular functions. Invasive pathogens have evolved efficient strategies to promote their internalization within normally non-phagocytic host cells. The so-called ""zippering"" bacteria present to host cell receptors molecules that mimic endogenous ligands, thereby inducing specific intracellular signaling cascades ultimately resulting in actin polymerization and uptake. Here we review how the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes enters into cells, and present a series of studies revealing that in addition to actin rearrangements this bacterium exploits the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery together with septins, a novel cytoskeleton element. The challenge is now to decipher how all of these components orchestrate themselves to permit entry into normally non-phagocytic cells."
19308322,Recent advances in understanding the structure and function of general transcription factor TFIID.,10.1007/s00018-009-0009-3,"The general transcription factor TFIID is a macromolecular complex comprising the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a set of 13-14 TBP associated factors (TAFs). This review discusses biochemical, genetic and electron microscopic data acquired over the past years that provide a model for the composition, organisation and assembly of TFIID. We also revisit ideas on how TFIID is recruited to the promoters of active and possibly repressed genes. Recent observations show that recognition of acetylated and methylated histone residues by structural domains in several TAFs plays an important role. Finally, we highlight several genetic studies suggesting that TFIID is required for initiation of transcription, but not for maintaining transcription once a promoter is in an active state."
19325624,The ESCRT machinery in endosomal sorting of ubiquitylated membrane proteins.,10.1038/nature07961,"Selective trafficking of membrane proteins to lysosomes for destruction is required for proper cell signalling and metabolism. Ubiquitylation aids this process by specifying which proteins should be transported to the lysosome lumen by the multivesicular endosome pathway. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery sorts cargo labelled with ubiquitin into invaginations of endosome membranes. Then, through a highly conserved mechanism also used in cytokinesis and viral budding, it mediates the breaking off of the cargo-containing intraluminal vesicles from the perimeter membrane. The involvement of the ESCRT machinery in suppressing diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration and infections underscores its importance to the cell."
19344744,The biosynthesis of cutin and suberin as an alternative source of enzymes for the production of bio-based chemicals and materials.,10.1016/j.biochi.2009.03.016,"Oxygenated fatty acids such as ricinoleic acid and vernolic acid can serve in the industry as synthons for the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals and polymers traditionally produced by chemical conversion of petroleum derivatives. Oxygenated fatty acids can also be useful to synthesize specialty chemicals such as cosmetics and aromas. There is thus a strong interest in producing these fatty acids in seed oils (triacylglycerols) of crop species. In the last 15 years or so, much effort has been devoted to isolate key genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis of oxygenated fatty acids and to express them in the seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana or crop species. An often overlooked but rich source of enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of oxygenated fatty acids and their esterification to glycerol is the biosynthetic pathways of the plant lipid polyesters cutin and suberin. These protective polymers found in specific tissues of all higher plants are composed of a wide variety of oxygenated fatty acids, many of which have not been reported in seed oils (e.g. saturated omega-hydroxy fatty acids and alpha,omega-diacids). The purpose of this mini-review is to give an overview of the recent advances in the biosynthesis of cutin and suberin and discuss their potential utility in producing specific oxygenated fatty acids for specialty chemicals. Special emphasis is given to the role played by specific acyltransferases and P450 fatty acid oxidases. The use of plant surfaces as possible sinks for the accumulation of high value-added lipids is also highlighted."
19348578,The structural and biochemical foundations of thiamin biosynthesis.,10.1146/annurev.biochem.78.072407.102340,"Thiamin is synthesized by most prokaryotes and by eukaryotes such as yeast and plants. In all cases, the thiazole and pyrimidine moieties are synthesized in separate branches of the pathway and coupled to form thiamin phosphate. A final phosphorylation gives thiamin pyrophosphate, the active form of the cofactor. Over the past decade or so, biochemical and structural studies have elucidated most of the details of the thiamin biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. Formation of the thiazole requires six gene products, and formation of the pyrimidine requires two. In contrast, details of the thiamin biosynthetic pathway in yeast are only just beginning to emerge. Only one gene product is required for the biosynthesis of the thiazole and one for the biosynthesis of the pyrimidine. Thiamin can also be transported into the cell and can be salvaged through several routes. In addition, two thiamin degrading enzymes have been characterized, one of which is linked to a novel salvage pathway."
19362651,Enzymology of aminoglycoside biosynthesis-deduction from gene clusters.,10.1016/S0076-6879(09)04619-9,"The classical aminoglycosides are, with very few exceptions, typically actinobacterial secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities all mediated by inhibiting translation on the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Some chemically related natural products inhibit glucosidases by mimicking oligo-alpha-1,4-glucosides. The biochemistry of the aminoglycoside biosynthetic pathways is still a developing field since none of the pathways has been analyzed to completeness as yet. In this chapter we treat the enzymology of aminoglycoside biosyntheses as far as it becomes apparent from recent investigations based on the availability of DNA sequence data of biosynthetic gene clusters for all major structural classes of these bacterial metabolites. We give a more general overview of the field, including descriptions of some key enzymes in various aminoglycoside pathways, whereas in Chapter 20 provides a detailed account of the better-studied enzymology thus far known for the neomycin and butirosin pathways."
19429610,"3-hydroxypropionyl-coenzyme A dehydratase and acryloyl-coenzyme A reductase, enzymes of the autotrophic 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle in the Sulfolobales.",10.1128/JB.00068-09,"A 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle operates in autotrophic CO(2) fixation in various Crenarchaea, as studied in some detail in Metallosphaera sedula. This cycle and the autotrophic 3-hydroxypropionate cycle in Chloroflexus aurantiacus have in common the conversion of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and two bicarbonates via 3-hydroxypropionate to succinyl-CoA. Both cycles require the reductive conversion of 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA. In M. sedula the reaction sequence is catalyzed by three enzymes. The first enzyme, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetase, catalyzes the CoA- and MgATP-dependent formation of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA. The next two enzymes were purified from M. sedula or Sulfolobus tokodaii and studied. 3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase, a member of the enoyl-CoA hydratase family, eliminates water from 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA to form acryloyl-CoA. Acryloyl-CoA reductase, a member of the zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase family, reduces acryloyl-CoA with NADPH to propionyl-CoA. Genes highly similar to the Metallosphaera CoA synthetase, dehydratase, and reductase genes were found in autotrophic members of the Sulfolobales. The encoded enzymes are only distantly related to the respective three enzyme domains of propionyl-CoA synthase from C. aurantiacus, where this trifunctional enzyme catalyzes all three reactions. This indicates that the autotrophic carbon fixation cycles in Chloroflexus and in the Sulfolobales evolved independently and that different genes/enzymes have been recruited in the two lineages that catalyze the same kinds of reactions."
19429925,Protein O-mannosylation: conserved from bacteria to humans.,10.1093/glycob/cwp066,"Protein O-mannosylation is an essential modification in fungi and animals. Different from most other types of O-glycosylation, protein O-mannosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the transfer of mannose from dolichol monophosphate-activated mannose to serine and threonine residues of secretory proteins. In recent years, it has emerged that even bacteria are capable of O-mannosylation and that the biosynthetic pathway of O-mannosyl glycans is conserved between pro- and eukaryotes. In this review, we summarize the observations that have opened up the field and highlight characteristics of O-mannosylation in the different domains/kingdoms of life."

19464381,Isolation and characterization of a bile acid inducible 7alpha-dehydroxylating operon in Clostridium hylemonae TN271.,10.1016/j.anaerobe.2009.05.004,"Primary bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, conjugated to either glycine or taurine and secreted into bile. Bile salts undergo enterohepatic circulation several times each day. During this process, they are biotransformed into a variety of metabolites by gut bacteria. The major biotransformation is the 7alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid yielding deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, respectively. 7alpha-Dehydroxylation is a multi-step pathway. The genes encoding enzymes in this pathway have been identified in two species of ""high"" activity strains of clostridia. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a bile acid inducible (bai) operon in Clostridium hylemonae, a ""low"" activity 7alpha-dehydroxylating strain. The gene organization and sequence of the baiBCDEFGHI operon was highly conserved between C. hylemonae and ""high"" activity strains. Surprisingly, the baiA gene was missing from the bai operon of C. hylemonae. The baiA gene was isolated using PCR and degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The mRNA start site for the large bai operon was determined and shown to be only 11bp from the initiation codon of the first gene. It was also discovered that allocholic acid (5alpha) induced the bai operon and stimulated the conversion of [24-(14)C] cholic acid to [24-(14)C] allodeoxycholic acid in cultures of C. scindens and C. hylemonae allodeoxycholic acid. Finally, it was discovered that the addition of testosterone to the growth medium markedly increased 7alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid in Clostridium scindens and C. hylemonae. We hypothesize that testosterone may be a gratuitous inducer of genes involved in the reductive arm of the bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation pathway."
19483713,"Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup), proteasomes and pathogenesis.",10.1038/nrmicro2148,"Proteasomes are ATP-dependent, multisubunit proteases that are found in all eukaryotes and archaea and some bacteria. In eukaryotes, the small protein ubiquitin is covalently attached in a post-translational manner to proteins that are targeted for proteasomal degradation. Despite the presence of proteasomes in many prokaryotes, ubiquitin or other post-translational protein modifiers were presumed to be absent from these organisms. Recently a prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein, Pup, was found to target proteins for proteolysis by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteasome. The discovery of this ubiquitin-like modifier opens up the possibility that other bacteria may also have small post-translational protein tagging systems, with the ability to affect cellular processes."

Recent years have seen a renewed interest in the biochemistry and biology of these compounds with the cloning of the biosynthetic gene clusters for several family members. This review discusses the commonalities and differences in the molecular logic that lie behind the biosynthesis of these compounds. The current knowledge regarding the metabolic pathways and enzymes involved in the production of a number of natural products, including the approved antibiotic fosfomycin, the widely used herbicide phosphinothricin (PT), and the clinical candidate for treatment of malaria FR-900098, is presented. Many of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds catalyze chemically and biologically unprecedented transformations, and a wealth of new biochemistry has been revealed through their study. These investigations have also suggested new strategies for natural product discovery."

Perturbations that disrupt ER homeostasis lead to the misfolding of proteins, ER stress and up-regulation of a signaling pathway called the ER stress response or the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is characterized by the induction of chaperones, degradation of misfolded proteins and attenuation of protein translation. Age-related declines and activity in key molecular chaperones and folding enzymes compromise proper protein folding and the adaptive response of the UPR. This review will highlight age-related changes in the protein folding machinery and in the UPR."
19523676,X-ray structures of the hexameric building block of the HIV capsid.,10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.063,"The mature capsids of HIV and other retroviruses organize and package the viral genome and its associated enzymes for delivery into host cells. The HIV capsid is a fullerene cone: a variably curved, closed shell composed of approximately 250 hexamers and exactly 12 pentamers of the viral CA protein. We devised methods for isolating soluble, assembly-competent CA hexamers and derived four crystallographically independent models that define the structure of this capsid assembly unit at atomic resolution. A ring of six CA N-terminal domains form an apparently rigid core, surrounded by an outer ring of C-terminal domains. Mobility of the outer ring appears to be an underlying mechanism for generating the variably curved lattice in authentic capsids. Hexamer-stabilizing interfaces are highly hydrated, and this property may be key to the formation of quasi-equivalent interactions within hexamers and pentamers. The structures also clarify the molecular basis for capsid assembly inhibition and should facilitate structure-based drug design strategies."
19553373,A dynamic interface for capsaicinoid systems biology.,10.1104/pp.109.136549,"Capsaicinoids are the pungent alkaloids that give hot peppers (Capsicum spp.) their spiciness. While capsaicinoids are relatively simple molecules, much is unknown about their biosynthesis, which spans diverse metabolisms of essential amino acids, phenylpropanoids, benzenoids, and fatty acids. Pepper is not a model organism, but it has access to the resources developed in model plants through comparative approaches. To aid research in this system, we have implemented a comprehensive model of capsaicinoid biosynthesis and made it publicly available within the SolCyc database at the SOL Genomics Network (http://www.sgn.cornell.edu). As a preliminary test of this model, and to build its value as a resource, targeted transcripts were cloned as candidates for nearly all of the structural genes for capsaicinoid biosynthesis. In support of the role of these transcripts in capsaicinoid biosynthesis beyond correct spatial and temporal expression, their predicted subcellular localizations were compared against the biosynthetic model and experimentally determined compartmentalization in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To enable their use in a positional candidate gene approach in the Solanaceae, these genes were genetically mapped in pepper. These data were integrated into the SOL Genomics Network, a clade-oriented database that incorporates community annotation of genes, enzymes, phenotypes, mutants, and genomic loci. Here, we describe the creation and integration of these resources as a holistic and dynamic model of the characteristic specialized metabolism of pepper."
19577780,"Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, a model for evolution of secondary metabolic pathways in plants.",10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.05.012,"Benzoxazinoids are secondary metabolites that are effective in defence and allelopathy. They are synthesised in two subfamilies of the Poaceae and sporadically found in single species of the dicots. The biosynthesis is fully elucidated in maize; here the genes encoding the enzymes of the pathway are in physical proximity. This ""biosynthetic cluster"" might facilitate coordinated gene regulation. Data from Zea mays, Triticum aestivum and Hordeum lechleri suggest that the pathway is of monophyletic origin in the Poaceae. The branchpoint from the primary metabolism (Bx1 gene) can be traced back to duplication and functionalisation of the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSA). Modification of the intermediates by consecutive hydroxylation is catalysed by members of a cytochrome P450 enzyme subfamily (Bx2-Bx5). Glucosylation by an UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT, Bx8, Bx9) is essential for the reduction of autotoxicity of the benzoxazinoids. In some species 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one-glucoside (DIBOA-glc) is further modified by the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase BX6 and the O-methyltransferase BX7. In the dicots Aphelandra squarrosa, Consolida orientalis, and Lamium galeobdolon, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis is analogously organised: The branchpoint is established by a homolog of TSA, P450 enzymes catalyse hydroxylations and at least the first hydroxylation reaction is identical in dicots and Poaceae, the toxic aglucon is glucosylated by an UGT. Functionally, TSA and BX1 are indole-glycerolphosphate lyases (IGLs). Igl genes seem to be generally duplicated in angiosperms. Modelling and biochemical characterisation of IGLs reveal that the catalytic properties of the enzyme can easily be modified by mutation. Independent evolution can be assumed for the BX1 function in dicots and Poaceae."

Phosphoinositides are molecularly diverse due to variable phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups of their inositol rings. The rapid and reversible configuration of the seven known phosphoinositide species is controlled by a battery of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphoinositide phosphatases, which are thus critical for phosphoinositide isomer-specific localization and functions. Significantly, a given phosphoinositide generated by different isozymes of these phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases can have different biological effects. In mammals, close to 50 genes encode the phosphoinositide kinases and phosphoinositide phosphatases that regulate phosphoinositide metabolism and thus allow cells to respond rapidly and effectively to ever-changing environmental cues. Understanding the distinct and overlapping functions of these phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzymes is important for our knowledge of both normal human physiology and the growing list of human diseases whose etiologies involve these proteins. This review summarizes the structural and biological properties of all the known mammalian phosphoinositide kinases and phosphoinositide phosphatases, as well as their associations with human disorders."

Key enzymes which play an important role in these catabolic pathways are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) lyase (EC 4.1.3.4; HMG-CoA lyase) and the 3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA lyase (EC 4.1.2.26; HIHG-CoA lyase), respectively. HMG-CoA lyase is encoded by the liuE gene while the gene for HIHG-CoA lyase remains unidentified. A mutant in the liuE gene was unable to utilize both leucine/isovalerate and acyclic terpenes indicates an involvement of liuE in both catabolic pathways (Chávez-Avilés et al. 2009, FEMS Microbiol Lett 296:117-123). The LiuE protein was purified as a His-tagged recombinant protein and in addition to show HMG-CoA lyase activity (Chávez-Avilés et al. 2009, FEMS Microbiol Lett 296:117-123), also displays HIHG-CoA lyase activity, indicating a bifunctional role in both the leucine/isovalerate and acyclic terpenes catabolic pathways."

Our 3.5-A structure of a HEV-like particle (VLP) shows that each capsid protein contains 3 linear domains that form distinct structural elements: S, the continuous capsid; P1, 3-fold protrusions; and P2, 2-fold spikes. The S domain adopts a jelly-roll fold commonly observed in small RNA viruses. The P1 and P2 domains both adopt beta-barrel folds. Each domain possesses a potential polysaccharide-binding site that may function in cell-receptor binding. Sugar binding to P1 at the capsid protein interface may lead to capsid disassembly and cell entry. Structural modeling indicates that native T = 3 capsid contains flat dimers, with less curvature than those of T = 1 VLP. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of HEV molecular biology and have application to the development of vaccines and antiviral medications."

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a complete cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces melanosporofaciens MI614-43F2 and heterologous production of cyclooctatin in S. albus. Sequence analysis coupled with subcloning and gene deletion revealed that the minimal cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster consists of four genes, cotB1 to cotB4, encoding geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) synthase, terpene cyclase (CotB2), and two cytochromes P450, respectively. Incubation of the recombinant CotB2 with GGDP resulted in the formation of cyclooctat-9-en-7-ol, an unprecedented tricyclic diterpene alcohol. The present study establishes the complete biosynthetic pathway of cyclooctatin and provides insights into both the stereospecific diterpene cyclization mechanism of the GGDP cyclase and the molecular bases for the stereospecific and regiospecific hydroxylation."

Besides oxylipins and unsaturated fatty acids known to play important signaling functions during plant-pathogen interactions, the very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) biosynthesis pathway has been recently associated to plant defense through different aspects. VLCFAs are indeed required for the biosynthesis of the plant cuticle and the generation of sphingolipids. Elucidation of the roles of these lipids in biotic stress responses is the result of the use of genetic approaches together with the identification of the genes/proteins involved in their biosynthesis. This review focuses on recent observations which revealed the complex function of the cuticle and cuticle-derived signals, and the key role of sphingolipids as bioactive molecules involved in signal transduction and cell death regulation during plant-pathogen interactions."

19680425,Temporal controls of the asymmetric cell division cycle in Caulobacter crescentus.,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000463,"The asymmetric cell division cycle of Caulobacter crescentus is orchestrated by an elaborate gene-protein regulatory network, centered on three major control proteins, DnaA, GcrA and CtrA. The regulatory network is cast into a quantitative computational model to investigate in a systematic fashion how these three proteins control the relevant genetic, biochemical and physiological properties of proliferating bacteria. Different controls for both swarmer and stalked cell cycles are represented in the mathematical scheme. The model is validated against observed phenotypes of wild-type cells and relevant mutants, and it predicts the phenotypes of novel mutants and of known mutants under novel experimental conditions. Because the cell cycle control proteins of Caulobacter are conserved across many species of alpha-proteobacteria, the model we are proposing here may be applicable to other genera of importance to agriculture and medicine (e.g., Rhizobium, Brucella)."

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a model for studies of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis type II (FAS II) and as a template for identification of mammalian components. Inactivation of mitochondrial FAS II in yeast results in respiratory deficiency and loss of cytochromes. The pathway produces the octanoyl-ACP substrate for lipoic acid synthesis, but several pieces of evidence indicate that it is capable of the generation of longer fatty acids. A number of structures of mitochondrial FAS II enzymes have been published in the past few years, allowing for a comparison with their prokaryotic counterparts, several of which have been described as promising targets for antibiotics. Recently, novel links between mitochondrial FAS and RNA processing in yeast and vertebrates have been reported. In S. cerevisiae, deficiency in mitochondrial FAS results in failure of maturation of mitochondrial RNAse P, while, in mammals, mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl thioester dehydratase and the RPP14 subunit of RNase P are encoded by the same bicistronic transcript.

Key insights into bacterial regulatory programs that orchestrate cell cycle progression have come from studies of Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium that divides asymmetrically. Three global regulatory proteins cycle out of phase with one another and drive cell cycle progression by directly controlling the expression of 200 cell-cycle-regulated genes. Exploration of this system provided insights into the evolution of regulatory circuits and the plasticity of circuit structure. The temporal expression of the modular subsystems that implement the cell cycle and asymmetric cell division is also coordinated by differential DNA methylation, regulated proteolysis, and phosphorylation signaling cascades. This control system structure has parallels to eukaryotic cell cycle control architecture. Remarkably, the transcriptional circuitry is dependent on three-dimensional dynamic deployment of key regulatory and signaling proteins. In addition, dynamically localized DNA-binding proteins ensure that DNA segregation is coupled to the timing and cellular position of the cytokinetic ring. Comparison to other organisms reveals conservation of cell cycle regulatory logic, even if regulatory proteins, themselves, are not conserved."
19696797,Pathways and mechanisms of endocytic recycling.,10.1038/nrm2755,"Endocytic recycling is coordinated with endocytic uptake to control the composition of the plasma membrane. Although much of our understanding of endocytic recycling has come from studies on the transferrin receptor, a protein internalized through clathrin-dependent endocytosis, increased interest in clathrin-independent endocytosis has led to the discovery of new endocytic recycling systems. Recent insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control endocytic recycling have focused on recycling through tubular carriers and the return to the cell surface of cargoes that enter cells through clathrin-independent mechanisms. Recent work emphasizes the importance of regulated recycling in processes as diverse as cytokinesis, cell adhesion, morphogenesis, cell fusion, learning and memory."
19710102,Review: Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,10.1177/1753425909106436,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes serious nosocomial infections, and an important virulence factor produced by this organism is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This review summarizes knowledge about biosynthesis of all three structural domains of LPS - lipid A, core oligosaccharide, and O polysaccharides. In addition, based on similarities with other bacterial species, this review proposes new hypothetical pathways for unstudied steps in the biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa LPS. Lipid A biosynthesis is discussed in relation to Escherichia coli and Salmonella, and the biosyntheses of core sugar precursors and core oligosaccharide are summarised. Pseudomonas aeruginosa attaches a Common Polysaccharide Antigen and O-Specific Antigen polysaccharides to lipid A-core. Both forms of O polysaccharide are discussed with respect to their independent synthesis mechanisms. Recent advances in understanding O-polysaccharide biosynthesis since the last major review on this subject, published nearly a decade ago, are highlighted. Since P. aeruginosa O polysaccharides contain unusual sugars, sugar-nucleotide biosynthesis pathways are reviewed in detail. Knowledge derived from detailed studies in the O5, O6 and O11 serotypes is applied to predict biosynthesis pathways of sugars in poorly-studied serotypes, especially O1, O4, and O13/O14. Although further work is required, a full understanding of LPS biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa is almost within reach."
19721811,Molecular pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis.,10.2174/138920209787581262,"Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis due to renal impaired acid excretion. Hyperchloremic acidosis with normal anion gap and normal or minimally affected glomerular filtration rate defines this disorder. RTA can also present with hypokalemia, medullary nephrocalcinosis and nephrolitiasis, as well as growth retardation and rickets in children, or short stature and osteomalacia in adults. In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RTA and the fundamental molecular physiology of renal tubular transport processes. This review summarizes hereditary diseases caused by mutations in genes encoding transporter or channel proteins operating along the renal tubule. Review of the molecular basis of hereditary tubulopathies reveals various loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding cotransporter, exchanger, or channel proteins, which are located in the luminal, basolateral, or endosomal membranes of the tubular cell or in paracellular tight junctions. These gene mutations result in a variety of functional defects in transporter/channel proteins, including decreased activity, impaired gating, defective trafficking, impaired endocytosis and degradation, or defective assembly of channel subunits. Further molecular studies of inherited tubular transport disorders may shed more light on the molecular pathophysiology of these diseases and may significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying renal salt homeostasis, urinary mineral excretion, and blood pressure regulation in health and disease. The identification of the molecular defects in inherited tubulopathies may provide a basis for future design of targeted therapeutic interventions and, possibly, strategies for gene therapy of these complex disorders."
19732866,Folate receptor alpha defect causes cerebral folate transport deficiency: a treatable neurodegenerative disorder associated with disturbed myelin metabolism.,10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.08.005,"Sufficient folate supplementation is essential for a multitude of biological processes and diverse organ systems. At least five distinct inherited disorders of folate transport and metabolism are presently known, all of which cause systemic folate deficiency. We identified an inherited brain-specific folate transport defect that is caused by mutations in the folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) gene coding for folate receptor alpha (FRalpha). Three patients carrying FOLR1 mutations developed progressive movement disturbance, psychomotor decline, and epilepsy and showed severely reduced folate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated profound hypomyelination, and MR-based in vivo metabolite analysis indicated a combined depletion of white-matter choline and inositol. Retroviral transfection of patient cells with either FRalpha or FRbeta could rescue folate binding. Furthermore, CSF folate concentrations, as well as glial choline and inositol depletion, were restored by folinic acid therapy and preceded clinical improvements. Our studies not only characterize a previously unknown and treatable disorder of early childhood, but also provide new insights into the folate metabolic pathways involved in postnatal myelination and brain development."
19733268,Spliceosome structure: piece by piece.,10.1016/j.bbagrm.2009.08.010,"Processing of pre-mRNAs by RNA splicing is an essential step in the maturation of protein coding RNAs in eukaryotes. Structural studies of the cellular splicing machinery, the spliceosome, are a major challenge in structural biology due to the size and complexity of the splicing ensemble. Specifically, the structural details of splice site recognition and the architecture of the spliceosome active site are poorly understood. X-ray and NMR techniques have been successfully used to address these questions defining the structure of individual domains, isolated splicing proteins, spliceosomal RNA fragments and recently the U1 snRNP multiprotein.RNA complex. These results combined with extant biochemical and genetic data have yielded important insights as well as posing fresh questions with respect to the regulation and mechanism of this critical gene regulatory process."
19775248,Molecular characterization of staphyloferrin B biosynthesis in Staphylococcus aureus.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06880.x,"Siderophores are iron-scavenging molecules produced by many microbes. In general, they are synthesized using either non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) pathways. Staphylococcus aureus produces siderophores, of which the structures of staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B are known. Recently, the NIS biosynthetic pathway for staphyloferrin A was characterized. Here we show that, in S. aureus, the previously identified sbn (siderophore biosynthesis) locus encodes enzymes required for the synthesis of staphyloferrin B, an alpha-hydroxycarboxylate siderophore comprised of l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid, citric acid, 1,2-diaminoethane and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. Staphyloferrin B NIS biosynthesis was recapitulated in vitro, using purified recombinant Sbn enzymes and the component substrates. In vitro synthesized staphyloferrin B readily promoted the growth of iron-starved S. aureus, via the ABC transporter SirABC. The SbnCEF synthetases and a decarboxylase, SbnH, were necessary and sufficient to produce staphyloferrin B in reactions containing component substrates l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid, citric acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. Since 1,2-diaminoethane was not required, this component of the siderophore arises from the SbnH-dependent decarboxylation of a 2,3-diaminoproprionic acid-containing intermediate. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) analyses of a series of enzyme reactions identified mass ions corresponding to biosynthetic intermediates, allowing for the first proposed biosynthetic pathway for staphyloferrin B."
19781638,The role of proteolysis in the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle and development.,10.1016/j.resmic.2009.09.006,Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle progression is implemented by oscillating global transcriptional regulators that establish temporal and spatial control of modular genetic subsystems during the cell cycle. The hierarchy of this regulatory circuit is established through a combination of gene expression control and regulated proteolysis. Recent results highlight the importance of spatial organization for controlled proteolysis in C. crescentus.
19801473,Identification of two aflatrem biosynthesis gene loci in Aspergillus flavus and metabolic engineering of Penicillium paxilli to elucidate their function.,10.1128/AEM.02146-08,"Aflatrem is a potent tremorgenic toxin produced by the soil fungus Aspergillus flavus, and a member of a structurally diverse group of fungal secondary metabolites known as indole-diterpenes. Gene clusters for indole-diterpene biosynthesis have recently been described in several species of filamentous fungi. A search of Aspergillus complete genome sequence data identified putative aflatrem gene clusters in the genomes of A. flavus and Aspergillus oryzae. In both species the genes for aflatrem biosynthesis cluster at two discrete loci; the first, ATM1, is telomere proximal on chromosome 5 and contains a cluster of three genes, atmG, atmC, and atmM, and the second, ATM2, is telomere distal on chromosome 7 and contains five genes, atmD, atmQ, atmB, atmA, and atmP. Reverse transcriptase PCR in A. flavus demonstrated that aflatrem biosynthesis transcript levels increased with the onset of aflatrem production. Transfer of atmP and atmQ into Penicillium paxilli paxP and paxQ deletion mutants, known to accumulate paxilline intermediates paspaline and 13-desoxypaxilline, respectively, showed that AtmP is a functional homolog of PaxP and that AtmQ utilizes 13-desoxypaxilline as a substrate to synthesize aflatrem pathway-specific intermediates, paspalicine and paspalinine. We propose a scheme for aflatrem biosynthesis in A. flavus based on these reconstitution experiments in P. paxilli and identification of putative intermediates in wild-type cultures of A. flavus."
19805513,XPF-ERCC1 participates in the Fanconi anemia pathway of cross-link repair.,10.1128/MCB.00086-09,"Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) prevent DNA strand separation and, therefore, transcription and replication, making them extremely cytotoxic. The precise mechanism by which ICLs are removed from mammalian genomes largely remains elusive. Genetic evidence implicates ATR, the Fanconi anemia proteins, proteins required for homologous recombination, translesion synthesis, and at least two endonucleases, MUS81-EME1 and XPF-ERCC1. ICLs cause replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and MUS81-EME1 facilitates DSB formation. The subsequent repair of these DSBs occurs via homologous recombination after the ICL is unhooked by XPF-ERCC1. Here, we examined the effect of the loss of either nuclease on FANCD2 monoubiquitination to determine if the nucleolytic processing of ICLs is required for the activation of the Fanconi anemia pathway. FANCD2 was monoubiquitinated in Mus81(-/-), Ercc1(-/-), and XPF-deficient human, mouse, and hamster cells exposed to cross-linking agents. However, the monoubiquitinated form of FANCD2 persisted longer in XPF-ERCC1-deficient cells than in wild-type cells. Moreover, the levels of chromatin-bound FANCD2 were dramatically reduced and the number of ICL-induced FANCD2 foci significantly lower in XPF-ERCC1-deficient cells. These data demonstrate that the unhooking of an ICL by XPF-ERCC1 is necessary for the stable localization of FANCD2 to the chromatin and subsequent homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair."
19850913,Powering through ribosome assembly.,10.1261/rna.1792109,"Ribosome assembly is required for cell growth in all organisms. Classic in vitro work in bacteria has led to a detailed understanding of the biophysical, thermodynamic, and structural basis for the ordered and correct assembly of ribosomal proteins on ribosomal RNA. Furthermore, it has enabled reconstitution of active subunits from ribosomal RNA and proteins in vitro. Nevertheless, recent work has shown that eukaryotic ribosome assembly requires a large macromolecular machinery in vivo. Many of these assembly factors such as ATPases, GTPases, and kinases hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates. Because these enzymes are likely regulatory proteins, much work to date has focused on understanding their role in the assembly process. Here, we review these factors, as well as other sources of energy, and their roles in the ribosome assembly process. In addition, we propose roles of energy-releasing enzymes in the assembly process, to explain why energy is used for a process that occurs largely spontaneously in bacteria. Finally, we use literature data to suggest testable models for how these enzymes could be used as targets for regulation of ribosome assembly."
19854671,Spatial regulation in Caulobacter crescentus.,10.1016/j.mib.2009.09.013,"The proper positioning of regulatory proteins has a central role in the organization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Important insights into the principles that underlie the spatial control of cellular processes have been gained from studies on the asymmetric bacterium C. crescentus. In this organism, the cell cycle state is monitored by a complex two-component signaling network that feeds into the central pathways controlling gene expression, DNA replication and polar morphogenesis. Moreover, a sophisticated regulatory system closely interconnects chromosome dynamics with cell division, thus ensuring the generation of viable offspring. Recent work has identified several new key players in this intricate machinery and considerably increased our knowledge on the communication between the different regulatory pathways involved."
19854898,Combined genomic and proteomic approaches identify gene clusters involved in anaerobic 2-methylnaphthalene degradation in the sulfate-reducing enrichment culture N47.,10.1128/JB.00874-09,"The highly enriched deltaproteobacterial culture N47 anaerobically oxidizes the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, with sulfate as the electron acceptor. Combined genome sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteome analyses were performed to identify genes and proteins involved in anaerobic aromatic catabolism. Proteome analysis of 2-methylnaphthalene-grown N47 cells resulted in the identification of putative enzymes catalyzing the anaerobic conversion of 2-methylnaphthalene to 2-naphthoyl coenzyme A (2-naphthoyl-CoA), as well as the reductive ring cleavage of 2-naphthoyl-CoA, leading to the formation of acetyl-CoA and CO(2). The glycyl radical-catalyzed fumarate addition to the methyl group of 2-methylnaphthalene is catalyzed by naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate synthase (Nms), composed of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits that are encoded by the genes nmsABC. Located upstream of nmsABC is nmsD, encoding the Nms-activating enzyme, which harbors the characteristic [Fe(4)S(4)] cluster sequence motifs of S-adenosylmethionine radical enzymes. The bns gene cluster, coding for enzymes involved in beta-oxidation reactions converting naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate to 2-naphthoyl-CoA, was found four intervening open reading frames further downstream. This cluster consists of eight genes (bnsABCDEFGH) corresponding to 8.1 kb, which are closely related to genes for enzymes involved in anaerobic toluene degradation within the denitrifiers ""Aromatoleum aromaticum"" EbN1, Azoarcus sp. strain T, and Thauera aromatica. Another contiguous DNA sequence harbors the gene for 2-naphthoyl-CoA reductase (ncr) and 16 additional genes that were found to be expressed in 2-methylnaphthalene-grown cells. These genes code for enzymes that were supposed to catalyze the dearomatization and ring cleavage reactions converting 2-naphthoyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and CO(2). Comparative sequence analysis of the four encoding subunits (ncrABCD) showed the gene product to have the closest similarity to the Azoarcus type of benzoyl-CoA reductase. The present work provides the first insight into the genetic basis of anaerobic 2-methylnaphthalene metabolism and delivers implications for understanding contaminant degradation."
19865606,The Mechanism of Budding of Retroviruses From Cell Membranes.,10.1155/2009/623969,"Retroviruses have evolved a mechanism for the release of particles from the cell membrane that appropriates cellular protein complexes, referred to as ESCRT-I, -II, -III, normally involved in the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies. Three different classes of late assembly (L) domains encoded in Gag, with core sequences of PPXY, PTAP, and YPXL, recruit different components of the ESCRT machinery to form a budding complex for virus release. Here, we highlight recent progress in identifying the role of different ESCRT complexes in facilitating budding, ubiquitination, and membrane targeting of avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) and human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1). These findings show that retroviruses adopt parallel budding pathways by recruiting different host factors from common cellular machinery for particle release."
19879902,Driving ribosome assembly.,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2009.10.009,"Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process that provides cells with the molecular factories for cellular protein production. Accordingly, its misregulation lies at the heart of several hereditary diseases (e.g., Diamond-Blackfan anemia). The process of ribosome assembly comprises the processing and folding of the pre-rRNA and its concomitant assembly with the ribosomal proteins. Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis relies on a large number (>200) of non-ribosomal factors, which confer directionality and accuracy to this process. Many of these non-ribosomal factors fall into different families of energy-consuming enzymes, notably including ATP-dependent RNA helicases, AAA-ATPases, GTPases, and kinases. Ribosome biogenesis is highly conserved within eukaryotic organisms; however, due to the combination of powerful genetic and biochemical methods, it is best studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This review summarizes our current knowledge on eukaryotic ribosome assembly, with particular focus on the molecular role of the involved energy-consuming enzymes."
19880312,Archaeal RNA polymerase.,10.1016/j.sbi.2009.10.006,"The recently solved X-ray crystal structures of archaeal RNA polymerase (RNAP) allow a structural comparison of the transcription machinery among all three domains of life. Archaeal transcription is very simple and all components, including the structures of general transcription factors and RNAP, are highly conserved in eukaryotes. Therefore, it could be a new model for the dissection of the eukaryotic transcription apparatus. The archaeal RNAP structure also provides a framework for addressing the functional role that Fe-S clusters play within the transcription machinery of archaea and eukaryotes. A comparison between bacterial and archaeal open complex models reveals likely key motifs of archaeal RNAP for DNA unwinding during the open complex formation."
19924646,The early endosome: a busy sorting station for proteins at the crossroads.,10.14670/HH-25.99,"Endocytosis marks the entry of internalized receptors into the complex network of endocytic trafficking pathways. Endocytic vesicles are rapidly targeted to a distinct membrane-bound endocytic organelle referred to as the early endosome. Despite the existence of numerous internalization routes, early endosomes (EE) serve as a focal point of the endocytic pathway. Sorting events initiated at this compartment determine the subsequent fate of internalized proteins and lipids, destining them either for recycling to the plasma membrane, degradation in lysosomes or delivery to the trans-Golgi network. Sorting of endocytic cargo to the latter compartments is accomplished through the formation of distinct microdomains within early endosomes, through the coordinate recruitment and assembly of the sorting machinery. An elaborate network of interactions between endocytic regulatory proteins ensures synchronized sorting of cargo to microdomains followed by morphological changes at the early endosomal membranes. Consequently, the cargo targeted either for recycling back to the plasma membrane, or for retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network, localizes to newly-formed tubular membranes. With a high ratio of membrane surface to lumenal volume, these tubules effectively concentrate the recycling cargo, ensuring efficient transport out of the EE. Conversely, receptors sorted for degradation cluster at the flat clathrin lattices involved in invaginations of the limiting membrane, associating with newly formed intralumenal vesicles. In this review we will discuss the characteristics of early endosomes, their role in the regulation of endocytic transport, and their aberrant function in a variety of diseases."
19939922,Conformational changes in the hepatitis B virus core protein are consistent with a role for allostery in virus assembly.,10.1128/JVI.02033-09,"In infected cells, virus components must be organized at the right place and time to ensure assembly of infectious virions. From a different perspective, assembly must be prevented until all components are available. Hypothetically, this can be achieved by allosterically controlling assembly. Consistent with this hypothesis, here we show that the structure of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein dimer, which can spontaneously self-assemble, is incompatible with capsid assembly. Systematic differences between core protein dimer and capsid conformations demonstrate linkage between the intradimer interface and interdimer contact surface. These structures also provide explanations for the capsid-dimer selectivity of some antibodies and the activities of assembly effectors. Solution studies suggest that the assembly-inactive state is more accurately an ensemble of conformations. Simulations show that allostery supports controlled assembly and results in capsids that are resistant to dissociation. We propose that allostery, as demonstrated in HBV, is common to most self-assembling viruses."
19948674,The kidney and acid-base regulation.,10.1152/advan.00054.2009,"Since the topic of the role of the kidneys in the regulation of acid-base balance was last reviewed from a teaching perspective (Koeppen BM. Renal regulation of acid-base balance. Adv Physiol Educ 20: 132-141, 1998), our understanding of the specific membrane transporters involved in H(+), HCO(3)(-), and NH(4)(+) transport, and especially how these transporters are regulated in response to systemic acid-base disorders, has advanced considerably. In this review, these new aspects of renal function are presented, as are the broader and more general concepts related to the role of the kidneys in maintaining the acid-base balance. It is intended that this review will assist those who teach this aspect of human physiology to first-year health profession students."
19955419,Identifying the missing steps of the autotrophic 3-hydroxypropionate CO2 fixation cycle in Chloroflexus aurantiacus.,10.1073/pnas.0908356106,"The phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus uses a yet unsolved 3-hydroxypropionate cycle for autotrophic CO(2) fixation. It starts from acetyl-CoA, with acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA carboxylases acting as carboxylating enzymes. In a first cycle, (S)-malyl-CoA is formed from acetyl-CoA and 2 molecules of bicarbonate. (S)-Malyl-CoA cleavage releases the CO(2) fixation product glyoxylate and regenerates the starting molecule acetyl-CoA. Here we complete the missing steps devoted to glyoxylate assimilation. In a second cycle, glyoxylate is combined with propionyl-CoA, an intermediate of the first cycle, to form beta-methylmalyl-CoA. This condensation is followed by dehydration to mesaconyl-C1-CoA. An unprecedented CoA transferase catalyzes the intramolecular transfer of the CoA moiety to the C4 carboxyl group of mesaconate. Mesaconyl-C4-CoA then is hydrated by an enoyl-CoA hydratase to (S)-citramalyl-CoA. (S)-Citramalyl-CoA is cleaved into acetyl-CoA and pyruvate by a tri-functional lyase, which previously cleaved (S)-malyl-CoA and formed beta-methylmalyl-CoA. Thus, the enigmatic disproportionation of glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and pyruvate is solved in an elegant and economic way requiring only 3 additional enzymes. The whole bicyclic pathway results in pyruvate formation from 3 molecules of bicarbonate and involves 19 steps but only 13 enzymes. Elements of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle may be used for the assimilation of small organic molecules. The 3-hydroxypropionate cycle is compared with the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and other autotrophic pathways."
20023024,The nonphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway in the thermoacidophilic euryarchaeon Picrophilus torridus involves a novel 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate- specific aldolase.,10.1128/JB.01281-09,"The pathway of glucose degradation in the thermoacidophilic euryarchaeon Picrophilus torridus has been studied by in vivo labeling experiments and enzyme analyses. After growth of P. torridus in the presence of [1-(13)C]- and [3-(13)C]glucose, the label was found only in the C-1 and C-3 positions, respectively, of the proteinogenic amino acid alanine, indicating the exclusive operation of an Entner-Doudoroff (ED)-type pathway in vivo. Cell extracts of P. torridus contained all enzyme activities of a nonphosphorylative ED pathway, which were not induced by glucose. Two key enzymes, gluconate dehydratase (GAD) and a novel 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG)-specific aldolase (KDGA), were characterized. GAD is a homooctamer of 44-kDa subunits, encoded by Pto0485. KDG aldolase, KDGA, is a homotetramer of 32-kDa subunits. This enzyme was highly specific for KDG with up to 2,000-fold-higher catalytic efficiency compared to 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) and thus differs from the bifunctional KDG/KDPG aldolase, KD(P)GA of crenarchaea catalyzing the conversion of both KDG and KDPG with a preference for KDPG. The KDGA-encoding gene, kdgA, was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) as Pto1279, and the correct translation start codon, an ATG 24 bp upstream of the annotated start codon of Pto1279, was determined by N-terminal amino acid analysis. The kdgA gene was functionally overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that KDGA is only distantly related to KD(P)GA, both enzymes forming separate families within the dihydrodipicolinate synthase superfamily. From the data we conclude that P. torridus degrades glucose via a strictly nonphosphorylative ED pathway with a novel KDG-specific aldolase, thus excluding the operation of the branched ED pathway involving a bifunctional KD(P)GA as a key enzyme."
20032175,The structure of the poxvirus A33 protein reveals a dimer of unique C-type lectin-like domains.,10.1128/JVI.02247-09,"The current vaccine against smallpox is an infectious form of vaccinia virus that has significant side effects. Alternative vaccine approaches using recombinant viral proteins are being developed. A target of subunit vaccine strategies is the poxvirus protein A33, a conserved protein in the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily of Poxviridae that is expressed on the outer viral envelope. Here we have determined the structure of the A33 ectodomain of vaccinia virus. The structure revealed C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) that occur as dimers in A33 crystals with five different crystal lattices. Comparison of the A33 dimer models shows that the A33 monomers have a degree of flexibility in position within the dimer. Structural comparisons show that the A33 monomer is a close match to the Link module class of CTLDs but that the A33 dimer is most similar to the natural killer (NK)-cell receptor class of CTLDs. Structural data on Link modules and NK-cell receptor-ligand complexes suggest a surface of A33 that could interact with viral or host ligands. The dimer interface is well conserved in all known A33 sequences, indicating an important role for the A33 dimer. The structure indicates how previously described A33 mutations disrupt protein folding and locates the positions of N-linked glycosylations and the epitope of a protective antibody."
20039786,DNA interstrand crosslink repair in mammalian cells: step by step.,10.3109/10409230903501819,"Interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) are formed by natural products of metabolism and by chemotherapeutic reagents. Work in E. coli identified a two cycle repair scheme involving incisions on one strand on either side of the ICL (unhooking) producing a gapped intermediate with the incised oligonucleotide attached to the intact strand. The gap is filled by recombinational repair or lesion bypass synthesis. The remaining monoadduct is then removed by nucleotide excision repair (NER). Despite considerable effort, our understanding of each step in mammalian cells is still quite limited. In part this reflects the variety of crosslinking compounds, each with distinct structural features, used by different investigators. Also, multiple repair pathways are involved, variably operative during the cell cycle. G(1) phase repair requires functions from NER, although the mechanism of recognition has not been determined. Repair can be initiated by encounters with the transcriptional apparatus, or a replication fork. In the case of the latter, the reconstruction of a replication fork, stalled or broken by collision with an ICL, adds to the complexity of the repair process. The enzymology of unhooking, the identity of the lesion bypass polymerases required to fill the first repair gap, and the functions involved in the second repair cycle are all subjects of active inquiry. Here we will review current understanding of each step in ICL repair in mammalian cells."
20064461,FANCM connects the genome instability disorders Bloom's Syndrome and Fanconi Anemia.,10.1016/j.molcel.2009.12.006,"Fanconi Anemia (FA) and Bloom's Syndrome (BS) are genetic disorders characterized by overlapping phenotypes, including aberrant DNA repair and cancer predisposition. Here, we show that the FANCM gene product, FANCM protein, links FA and BS by acting as a protein anchor and bridge that targets key components of the FA and BS pathways to stalled replication forks, thus linking multiple components that are necessary for efficient DNA repair. Two highly conserved protein:protein interaction motifs in FANCM, designated MM1 and MM2, were identified. MM1 interacts with the FA core complex by binding to FANCF, whereas MM2 interacts with RM1 and topoisomerase IIIalpha, components of the BS complex. The MM1 and MM2 motifs were independently required to activate the FA and BS pathways. Moreover, a common phenotype of BS and FA cells-an elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchanges-was due to a loss of interaction of the two complexes through FANCM."
20110990,The endocytic matrix.,10.1038/nature08910,"Endocytosis has long been thought of as simply a way for cells to internalize nutrients and membrane-associated molecules. But an explosive growth in knowledge has given a new dimension to our understanding of this process. It now seems that endocytosis is a master organizer of signalling circuits, with one of its main roles being the resolution of signals in space and time. Many of the functions of endocytosis that are emerging from recent research cannot yet be reconciled with the canonical view of intracellular trafficking but, instead, point to endocytosis being integrated at a deeper level in the cellular 'master plan' (the cellular network of signalling circuits that lie at the base of the cell's make-up). Deconvolution of this level, which we call the 'endocytic matrix', might uncover a fundamental aspect of how a cell is built."
20112977,"Organization of the Sec61 translocon, studied by high resolution native electrophoresis.",10.1021/pr900900x,"Cotranslational translocation of polypeptides into the ER is controlled by the dynamic interaction of ribosome and translocon components. Analysis of the steps involved in this process by high resolution techniques such as gel electrophoresis is precluded by the high molecular masses of these complexes. We show, here, that modifications to standard native electrophoresis protocols can overcome these problems and lead to an increase in mass range and resolution. Using the modified technique, we show that ER ribosome anchored membrane protein (RAMP) complexes resolve into 3 stable and semistable complexes which range in size between 4 and 8 MDa and are sensitive to relevant concentrations of divalent metals. We demonstrate the molecular composition of the complexes and identify a number of modular components that differentiate them. The components that are common to all three RAMP complexes include the OST translocon subcomplex, Glucosidase I and microtubule tethering protein CLIMP63. The two larger complexes further include the kinesin motor binding protein p180 and Sec61, and the largest complex includes the TRAP translocon component and apoptotic regulator BAP31. On the lumenal side, the BiP cochaperone ERdj3 resides with the three RAMP complexes. Our observations may hint at how subcompartmentalization is achieved in the ER membrane continuum."
20143161,Inorganic sulfur oxidizing system in green sulfur bacteria.,10.1007/s11120-010-9531-2,"Green sulfur bacteria use various reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide, elemental sulfur, and thiosulfate as electron donors for photoautotrophic growth. This article briefly summarizes what is known about the inorganic sulfur oxidizing systems of these bacteria with emphasis on the biochemical aspects. Enzymes that oxidize sulfide in green sulfur bacteria are membrane-bound sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase, periplasmic (sometimes membrane-bound) flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase, and monomeric flavocytochrome c (SoxF). Some green sulfur bacteria oxidize thiosulfate by the multienzyme system called either the TOMES (thiosulfate oxidizing multi-enzyme system) or Sox (sulfur oxidizing system) composed of the three periplasmic proteins: SoxB, SoxYZ, and SoxAXK with a soluble small molecule cytochrome c as the electron acceptor. The oxidation of sulfide and thiosulfate by these enzymes in vitro is assumed to yield two electrons and result in the transfer of a sulfur atom to persulfides, which are subsequently transformed to elemental sulfur. The elemental sulfur is temporarily stored in the form of globules attached to the extracellular surface of the outer membranes. The oxidation pathway of elemental sulfur to sulfate is currently unclear, although the participation of several proteins including those of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase system etc. is suggested from comparative genomic analyses."

Until recently, it was believed that mutations in ribosomes or ribosome biogenesis factors would be lethal, due to the essential nature of these complexes. However, in the last few decades, a number of diseases of ribosome biogenesis have been discovered. It remains a challenge in the field to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying them."
20194784,Identification and characterization of the furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural degradation pathways of Cupriavidus basilensis HMF14.,10.1073/pnas.0913039107,"The toxic fermentation inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates pose significant problems for the production of second-generation biofuels and biochemicals. Among these inhibitors, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) and furfural are specifically notorious. In this study, we describe the complete molecular identification and characterization of the pathway by which Cupriavidus basilensis HMF14 metabolizes HMF and furfural. The identification of this pathway enabled the construction of an HMF and furfural-metabolizing Pseudomonas putida. The genetic information obtained furthermore enabled us to predict the HMF and furfural degrading capabilities of sequenced bacterial species that had not previously been connected to furanic aldehyde metabolism. These results pave the way for in situ detoxification of lignocellulosic hydrolysates, which is a major step toward improved efficiency of utilization of lignocellulosic feedstock."
20197497,Getting in the loop: regulation of development in Caulobacter crescentus.,10.1128/MMBR.00040-09,"Caulobacter crescentus is an aquatic Gram-negative alphaproteobacterium that undergoes multiple changes in cell shape, organelle production, subcellular distribution of proteins, and intracellular signaling throughout its life cycle. Over 40 years of research has been dedicated to this organism and its developmental life cycles. Here we review a portion of many developmental processes, with particular emphasis on how multiple processes are integrated and coordinated both spatially and temporally. While much has been discovered about Caulobacter crescentus development, areas of potential future research are also highlighted."
20219571,Endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation: a chaperone assisted journey to hell.,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.02.005,"Recognition and elimination of misfolded proteins are essential cellular processes. More than thirty percent of the cellular proteins are proteins of the secretory pathway. They fold in the lumen or membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum from where they are sorted to their site of action. The folding process, as well as any refolding after cell stress, depends on chaperone activity. In case proteins are unable to acquire their native conformation, chaperones with different substrate specificity and activity guide them to elimination. For most misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum this requires retro-translocation to the cytosol and polyubiquitylation of the misfolded protein by an endoplasmic reticulum associated machinery. Thereafter ubiquitylated proteins are guided to the proteasome for degradation. This review summarizes our up to date knowledge of chaperone classes and chaperone function in endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation of protein waste."
20228623,A new paradigm of bacteria-gut interplay brought through the study of Shigella.,10.2183/pjab.86.229,"Bacteria-gut epithelial interplay and the mucosal immune response are the most critical issues in determining the fate of bacterial infection and the severity of diseases. Shigella species (abbreviated here as Shigella), the causative agent of bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), are highly adapted human pathogens that are capable of invading and colonizing the intestinal epithelium, which results in severe inflammatory colitis. Shigella secrete a large and diverse number (more then 50) of effectors via the type III secretion system (TTSS) during infection, some of which are delivered into the surrounding bacterial space and some others into the host cell cytoplasm and nucleus. The delivered effectors mimic and usurp the host cellular functions, and modulate host cell signaling and immune response, thus playing pivotal roles in promoting bacterial infection and circumventing host defense systems. This article overviews the pathogenic characteristics of Shigella, and highlights current topics related to the bacterial infectious stratagem executed by the TTSS-secreted effectors. Though bacterial stratagems and the molecular mechanisms of infection vary greatly among pathogens, the current studies of Shigella provide a paradigm shift in bacterial pathogenesis."
20233335,Plant-specific glycosylation patterns in the context of therapeutic protein production.,10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00497.x,"While N-glycan synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is relatively well conserved in eukaryotes, N-glycan processing and O-glycan biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus are kingdom specific and result in different oligosaccharide structures attached to glycoproteins in plants and mammals. With the prospect of using plants as alternative hosts to mammalian cell lines for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins, significant progress has been made towards the humanization of protein N-glycosylation in plant cells. To date, successful efforts in this direction have mainly focused on the targeted expression of therapeutic proteins, the knockout of plant-specific N-glycan-processing genes, and/or the introduction of the enzymatic machinery catalyzing the synthesis, transport and addition of human sugars. By contrast, very little attention has been paid until now to the O-glycosylation status of plant-made therapeutic proteins, which is surprising considering that hundreds of human proteins represent good candidates for Hyp-O glycosylation when produced in a plant expression system. This review describes protein N- and O-linked glycosylation in plants and highlights the limitations and advantages of plant-specific glycosylation on plant-made biopharmaceuticals."
20300064,A bacterial effector targets host DH-PH domain RhoGEFs and antagonizes macrophage phagocytosis.,10.1038/emboj.2010.33,"Bacterial pathogens often harbour a type III secretion system (TTSS) that injects effector proteins into eukaryotic cells to manipulate host processes and cause diseases. Identification of host targets of bacterial effectors and revealing their mechanism of actions are crucial for understating bacterial virulence. We show that EspH, a type III effector conserved in enteric bacterial pathogens including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli and Citrobacter rodentium, markedly disrupts actin cytoskeleton structure and induces cell rounding up when ectopically expressed or delivered into HeLa cells by the bacterial TTSS. EspH inactivates host Rho GTPase signalling pathway at the level of RhoGEF. EspH directly binds the DH-PH domain in multiple RhoGEFs, which prevents their binding to Rho and thereby inhibits nucleotide exchange-mediated Rho activation. Consistently, infection of mouse macrophages with EPEC harbouring EspH attenuates phagocytosis of the bacteria as well as FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis. EspH represents the first example of targeting RhoGEFs by bacterial effectors, and our results also reveal an unprecedented mechanism used by enteric pathogens to counteract the host defence system."

The polysaccharide was found to contain an unusual higher sugar, 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (di-N-acetyl-8-epilegionaminic acid, 8eLeg5Ac7Ac). The following structure of the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was established: -->4)-alpha-8eLegp5Ac7Ac-(2-->6)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->3)-alpha-L-FucpNAc-(1-->3)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->. Functions of the E. coli O108 antigen biosynthetic genes, including seven putative genes for synthesis of 8eLeg5Ac7Ac, were assigned by sequencing the O-antigen gene cluster along with comparison with gene databases and known biosynthetic pathways for related nonulosonic acids."
20332208,Structure and function of an iterative polyketide synthase thioesterase domain catalyzing Claisen cyclization in aflatoxin biosynthesis.,10.1073/pnas.0913531107,"Polyketide natural products possess diverse architectures and biological functions and share a subset of biosynthetic steps with fatty acid synthesis. The final transformation catalyzed by both polyketide synthases (PKSs) and fatty acid synthases is most often carried out by a thioesterase (TE). The synthetic versatility of TE domains in fungal nonreducing, iterative PKSs (NR-PKSs) has been shown to extend to Claisen cyclase (CLC) chemistry by catalyzing C-C ring closure reactions as opposed to thioester hydrolysis or O-C/N-C macrocyclization observed in previously reported TE structures. Catalysis of C-C bond formation as a product release mechanism dramatically expands the synthetic potential of PKSs, but how this activity was acquired has remained a mystery. We report the biochemical and structural analyses of the TE/CLC domain in polyketide synthase A, the multidomain PKS central to the biosynthesis of aflatoxin B(1), a potent environmental carcinogen. Mutagenesis experiments confirm the predicted identity of the catalytic triad and its role in catalyzing the final Claisen-type cyclization to the aflatoxin precursor, norsolorinic acid anthrone. The 1.7 A crystal structure displays an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold in the catalytic closed form with a distinct hydrophobic substrate-binding chamber. We propose that a key rotation of the substrate side chain coupled to a protein conformational change from the open to closed form spatially governs substrate positioning and C-C cyclization. The biochemical studies, the 1.7 A crystal structure of the TE/CLC domain, and intermediate modeling afford the first mechanistic insights into this widely distributed C-C bond-forming class of TEs."
20347046,Protein quality control in the ER: the recognition of misfolded proteins.,10.1016/j.semcdb.2010.03.006,"The mechanism, in molecular terms of protein quality control, specifically of how the cell recognizes and discriminates misfolded proteins, remains a challenge. In the secretory pathway the folding status of glycoproteins passing through the endoplasmic reticulum is marked by the composition of the N-glycan. The different glycoforms are recognized by specialized lectins. The folding sensor UGGT acts as an unusual molecular chaperone and covalently modifies the Man9 N-glycan of a misfolded protein by adding a glucose moiety and converts it to Glc1Man9 that rebinds the lectin calnexin. However, further links between the folding status of a glycoprotein and the composition of the N-glycan are unclear. There is little unequivocal evidence for other proteins in the ER recognizing the N-glycan and also acting as molecular chaperones. Nevertheless, based upon a few examples, we suggest that this function is carried out by individual proteins in several different complexes. Thus, calnexin binds the protein disulfide isomerase ERp57, that acts upon Glc1Man9 glycoproteins. In another example the protein disulfide isomerase ERdj5 binds specifically to EDEM (which is probably a mannosidase) and a lectin OS9, and reduces the disulfide bonds of bound glycoproteins destined for ERAD. Thus the glycan recognition is performed by a lectin and the chaperone function performed by a specific partner protein that can recognize misfolded proteins. We predict that this will be a common arrangement of proteins in the ER and that members of protein foldase families such as PDI and PPI will bind specifically to lectins in the ER. Molecular chaperones BiP and GRp94 will assist in the folding of proteins bound in these complexes as well as in the folding of non-glycoproteins."
20352425,Metabolism and function of phenazines in bacteria: impacts on the behavior of bacteria in the environment and biotechnological processes.,10.1007/s00253-010-2509-3,"Phenazines constitute a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds produced by a diverse range of bacteria. Both natural and synthetic phenazine derivatives are studied due their impacts on bacterial interactions and biotechnological processes. Phenazines serve as electron shuttles to alternate terminal acceptors, modify cellular redox states, act as cell signals that regulate patterns of gene expression, contribute to biofilm formation and architecture, and enhance bacterial survival. Phenazines have diverse effects on eukaryotic hosts and host tissues, including the modification of multiple host cellular responses. In plants, phenazines also may influence growth and elicit induced systemic resistance. Here, we discuss emerging evidence that phenazines play multiple roles for the producing organism and contribute to their behavior and ecological fitness."
20383543,Chemopreventive mechanisms of α-keto acid metabolites of naturally occurring organoselenium compounds.,10.1007/s00726-010-0578-3,"Previous studies on the chemopreventive mechanisms of dietary selenium have focused on its incorporation into antioxidative selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase. Several studies, however, have revealed that dietary selenium in the form of L-selenomethionine and the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine, also have intrinsic anti-cancer properties. Biochemical mechanisms previously investigated to contribute to their anticancer effects involve β- and γ-lyase reactions. Some pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-containing enzymes can catalyze a β-lyase reaction with Se-methyl-L-selenocysteine (MSC) generating pyruvate and ammonia. Other PLP-enzymes can catalyze a γ-lyase reaction with L-selenomethionine (SM) generating α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. In both cases, a purported third product is methylselenol (CH(3)SeH). Although not directly quantifiable, as a result of its extreme hydrophobicity and high vapor pressure, CH(3)SeH has been indirectly observed to act through the alteration of protein-sulfhydryl moieties on redox-responsive signal and transcription factors, thereby maintaining a non-proliferative intracellular environment. We have considered the possibility that α-keto acid analogues of MSC (i.e., methylselenopyruvate; MSP) and SM (i.e., α-keto-γ-methylselenobutyrate; KMSB), generated via a transamination and/or L-amino acid oxidase reaction may also be chemoprotective. Indeed, these compounds were shown to increase the level of histone-H3 acetylation in human prostate and colon cancer cells. MSP and KMSB structurally resemble butyrate, an inhibitor of several histone deacetylases. Thus, the seleno α-keto acid metabolites of MSC and SM, along with CH(3)SeH derived from β- and γ-lyase reactions, may be potential direct-acting metabolites of organoselenium that lead to de-repression of silenced tumor suppressor proteins and/or regulation of genes and signaling molecules."
20437165,Pseudomonas putida A ATCC 12633 oxidizes trimethylamine aerobically via two different pathways.,10.1007/s00203-010-0577-5,"The present study examined the aerobic metabolism of trimethylamine in Pseudomonas putida A ATCC 12633 grown on tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide or trimethylamine. In both conditions, the trimethylamine was used as a nitrogen source and also accumulated in the cell, slowing the bacterial growth. Decreased bacterial growth was counteracted by the addition of AlCl(3). Cell-free extracts prepared from cells grown aerobically on tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide exhibited trimethylamine monooxygenase activity that produced trimethylamine N-oxide and trimethylamine N-oxide demethylase activity that produced dimethylamine. Cell-free extracts from cells grown on trimethylamine exhibited trimethylamine dehydrogenase activity that produced dimethylamine, which was oxidized to methanal and methylamine by dimethylamine dehydrogenase. These results show that this bacterial strain uses two enzymes to initiate the oxidation of trimethylamine in aerobic conditions. The apparent K(m) for trimethylamine was 0.7 mM for trimethylamine monooxygenase and 4.0 mM for trimethylamine dehydrogenase, but both enzymes maintain similar catalytic efficiency (0.5 and 0.4, respectively). Trimethylamine dehydrogenase was inhibited by trimethylamine from 1 mM. Therefore, the accumulation of trimethylamine inside Pseudomonas putida A ATCC 12633 grown on tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide or trimethylamine may be due to the low catalytic efficiency of trimethylamine monooxygenase and trimethylamine dehydrogenase."
20441529,Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in plants.,10.1146/annurev-arplant-042809-112252,"Eukaryotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have evolved to transduce environmental and developmental signals into adaptive and programmed responses. MAPK cascades relay and amplify signals via three types of reversibly phosphorylated kinases leading to the phosphorylation of substrate proteins, whose altered activities mediate a wide array of responses, including changes in gene expression. Cascades may share kinase components, but their signaling specificity is maintained by spaciotemporal constraints and dynamic protein-protein interactions and by mechanisms that include crossinhibition, feedback control, and scaffolding. Plant MAPK cascades regulate numerous processes, including stress and hormonal responses, innate immunity, and developmental programs. Genetic analyses have uncovered several predominant MAPK components shared by several of these processes including the Arabidopsis thaliana MAPKs MPK3, 4, and 6 and MAP2Ks MKK1, 2, 4, and 5. Future work needs to focus on identifying substrates of MAPKs, and on understanding how specificity is achieved among MAPK signaling pathways."
20451491,Influenza M2 proton channels.,10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.04.015,"M2 of the influenza virus is an intriguing transmembrane protein that forms a minuscule proton channel in the viral envelope. Its recognized function is to equilibrate pH across the viral membrane during cell entry and across the trans-Golgi membrane of infected cells during viral maturation. It is vital for viral replication and it is a target for the anti-influenza drugs, amantadine and rimantadine. Recently, high resolution structures of M2 channels of both flu A and B have been obtained, providing the desperately needed structural details for understanding the mechanism of proton conductance. In particular, the establishment of the functional solution NMR system of the proton channels enabled simultaneous high resolution structure characterization and measurement of channel dynamics coupled to channel activity. This review summarizes our current understanding of how protons are conducted through the M2 channel from a structural point of view, as well as the modes by which important channel gating elements function during proton conduction."

Targeted autoimmune therapies capable of eradicating the rare autoreactive immune cells that are responsible for the attack on the body's own cells are yet to be identified. This Review presents a new emerging approach aimed at selectively destroying autoreactive immune cells by specific activation of tumour necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), which is found on autoreactive and normal T lymphocytes, with the potential of avoiding or reducing the toxicity observed with existing therapies."
20493981,Chromatin remodeling regulation by small molecules and metabolites.,10.1016/j.bbagrm.2010.05.007,"The eukaryotic genome is a highly organized nucleoprotein structure comprising of DNA, histones, non-histone proteins, and RNAs, referred to as chromatin. The chromatin exists as a dynamic entity, shuttling between the open and closed forms at specific nuclear regions and loci based on the requirement of the cell. This dynamicity is essential for the various DNA-templated phenomena like transcription, replication, and repair and is achieved through the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and covalent modifiers of chromatin. A growing body of data indicates that chromatin enzymatic activities are finely and specifically regulated by a variety of small molecules derived from the intermediary metabolism. This review tries to summarize the work conducted in many laboratories and on different model organisms showing how ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are regulated by small molecules and metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and inositol polyphosphates (IPs)."
2050632,4-Toluene sulfonate methyl-monooxygenase from Comamonas testosteroni T-2: purification and some properties of the oxygenase component.,10.1128/jb.173.12.3741-3748.1991,"Comamonas testosteroni T-2 synthesizes an inducible enzyme system that oxygenates 4-toluene sulfontate (TS) to 4-sulfobenzyl alcohol when grown in TS-salts medium. We purified this TS methyl-monooxygenase system (TSMOS) and found it to consist of two components. A monomeric, iron-sulfur flavoprotein (component B), which has been shown to act as a reductase in the 4-sulfobenzoate dioxygenase system of this organism (H. H. Locher, T. Leisinger, and A. M. Cook, Biochem. J. 274:833-842, 1991), carried electrons from NADH to component M, an oxygenase. This oxygenase had the UV-visible spectral characteristics of an iron-sulfur protein. Mrs of about 152,000 for the native oxygenase and of 43,000 under denaturing conditions indicated a homotri- or homotetrameric enzyme, whose N-terminal amino acids and amino acid composition were determined. The activity of the purified enzyme was enhanced about fivefold by the addition of Fe2+. In the presence of O2 and NADH, components B and M together catalyzed the stoichiometric transformation of TS or p-toluate to the corresponding alcohol. The reaction was confirmed as oxygenation of the methyl group by observation of an oxygen atom from 18O2 in carboxybenzyl alcohol. The substrate range of TSMOS included carboxylated analogs of TS (p- and m-toluates and 4-ethylbenzoate), whereas p-xylene, toluene, and p-cresol were not substrates. TSMOS also catalyzed demethylation; 4-methoxybenzoate was transformed to 4-hydroxybenzoate and formaldehyde."
20530542,Mechanism and evolution of cytosolic Hedgehog signal transduction.,10.1242/dev.045021,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is required for embryonic patterning and postnatal physiology in invertebrates and vertebrates. With the revelation that the primary cilium is crucial for mammalian Hh signaling, the prevailing view that Hh signal transduction mechanisms are conserved across species has been challenged. However, more recent progress on elucidating the function of core Hh pathway cytosolic regulators in Drosophila, zebrafish and mice has confirmed that the essential logic of Hh transduction is similar between species. Here, we review Hh signaling events at the membrane and in the cytosol, and focus on parallel and divergent functions of cytosolic Hh regulators in Drosophila and mammals."
20601960,Crystal structure of the conserved herpesvirus fusion regulator complex gH-gL.,10.1038/nsmb.1837,"Herpesviruses, which cause many incurable diseases, infect cells by fusing viral and cellular membranes. Whereas most other enveloped viruses use a single viral catalyst called a fusogen, herpesviruses, inexplicably, require two conserved fusion-machinery components, gB and the heterodimer gH-gL, plus other nonconserved components. gB is a class III viral fusogen, but unlike other members of its class, it does not function alone. We determined the crystal structure of the gH ectodomain bound to gL from herpes simplex virus 2. gH-gL is an unusually tight complex with a unique architecture that, unexpectedly, does not resemble any known viral fusogen. Instead, we propose that gH-gL activates gB for fusion, possibly through direct binding. Formation of a gB-gH-gL complex is critical for fusion and is inhibited by a neutralizing antibody, making the gB-gH-gL interface a promising antiviral target."
20659292,Removal of the outer Kdo from Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide and its impact on the bacterial surface.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07304.x,"Helicobacter pylori produces a unique surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) characterized by strikingly low endotoxicity that is thought to aid the organism in evading the host immune response. This reduction in endotoxicity is predicted to arise from the modification of the Kdo-lipid A domain of Helicobacter LPS by a series of membrane bound enzymes including a Kdo (3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid) hydrolase responsible for the modification of the core oligosaccharide. Here, we report that Kdo hydrolase activity is dependent upon a putative two-protein complex composed of proteins Hp0579 and Hp0580. Inactivation of Kdo hydrolase activity produced two phenotypes associated with cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance and O-antigen expression. Kdo hydrolase mutants were highly sensitive to polymyxin B, which could be attributed to a defect in downstream modifications to the lipid A 4'-phosphate group. Production of a fully extended O-antigen was also diminished in a Kdo hydrolase mutant, with a consequent increase in core-lipid A. Finally, expression of O-antigen Lewis X and Y epitopes, known to mimic glycoconjugates found on human tissues, was also affected. Taken together, we have demonstrated that loss of Kdo hydrolase activity affects all three domains of H. pylori LPS, thus highlighting its role in the maintenance of the bacterial surface."
20660314,Bacterial phenylalanine and phenylacetate catabolic pathway revealed.,10.1073/pnas.1005399107,"Aromatic compounds constitute the second most abundant class of organic substrates and environmental pollutants, a substantial part of which (e.g., phenylalanine or styrene) is metabolized by bacteria via phenylacetate. Surprisingly, the bacterial catabolism of phenylalanine and phenylacetate remained an unsolved problem. Although a phenylacetate metabolic gene cluster had been identified, the underlying biochemistry remained largely unknown. Here we elucidate the catabolic pathway functioning in 16% of all bacteria whose genome has been sequenced, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. This strategy is exceptional in several aspects. Intermediates are processed as CoA thioesters, and the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-CoA becomes activated to a ring 1,2-epoxide by a distinct multicomponent oxygenase. The reactive nonaromatic epoxide is isomerized to a seven-member O-heterocyclic enol ether, an oxepin. This isomerization is followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage and beta-oxidation steps, leading to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. This widespread paradigm differs significantly from the established chemistry of aerobic aromatic catabolism, thus widening our view of how organisms exploit such inert substrates. It provides insight into the natural remediation of man-made environmental contaminants such as styrene. Furthermore, this pathway occurs in various pathogens, where its reactive early intermediates may contribute to virulence."
20660769,Phages have adapted the same protein fold to fulfill multiple functions in virion assembly.,10.1073/pnas.1005822107,"Evolutionary relationships may exist among very diverse groups of proteins even though they perform different functions and display little sequence similarity. The tailed bacteriophages present a uniquely amenable system for identifying such groups because of their huge diversity yet conserved genome structures. In this work, we used structural, functional, and genomic context comparisons to conclude that the head-tail connector protein and tail tube protein of bacteriophage lambda diverged from a common ancestral protein. Further comparisons of tertiary and quaternary structures indicate that the baseplate hub and tail terminator proteins of bacteriophage may also be part of this same family. We propose that all of these proteins evolved from a single ancestral tail tube protein fold, and that gene duplication followed by differentiation led to the specialized roles of these proteins seen in bacteriophages today. Although this type of evolutionary mechanism has been proposed for other systems, our work provides an evolutionary mechanism for a group of proteins with different functions that bear no sequence similarity. Our data also indicate that the addition of a structural element at the N terminus of the lambda head-tail connector protein endows it with a distinctive protein interaction capability compared with many of its putative homologues."
20962583,Autophagy in protists.,10.4161/auto.7.2.13310,"Autophagy is the degradative process by which eukaryotic cells digest their own components using acid hydrolases within the lysosome. Originally thought to function almost exclusively in providing starving cells with nutrients taken from their own cellular constituents, autophagy is in fact involved in numerous cellular events including differentiation, turnover of macromolecules and organelles, and defense against parasitic invaders. During the last 10-20 years, molecular components of the autophagic machinery have been discovered, revealing a complex interactome of proteins and lipids, which, in a concerted way, induce membrane formation to engulf cellular material and target it for lysosomal degradation. Here, our emphasis is autophagy in protists. We discuss experimental and genomic data indicating that the canonical autophagy machinery characterized in animals and fungi appeared prior to the radiation of major eukaryotic lineages. Moreover, we describe how comparative bioinformatics revealed that this canonical machinery has been subject to moderation, outright loss or elaboration on multiple occasions in protist lineages, most probably as a consequence of diverse lifestyle adaptations. We also review experimental studies illustrating how several pathogenic protists either utilize autophagy mechanisms or manipulate host-cell autophagy in order to establish or maintain infection within a host. The essentiality of autophagy for the pathogenicity of many parasites, and the unique features of some of the autophagy-related proteins involved, suggest possible new targets for drug discovery. Further studies of the molecular details of autophagy in protists will undoubtedly enhance our understanding of the diversity and complexity of this cellular phenomenon and the opportunities it offers as a drug target."
20980831,MAPK machinery in plants: recognition and response to different stresses through multiple signal transduction pathways.,10.4161/psb.5.11.13020,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play diverse roles in intra- and extra-cellular signaling in plants. MAP kinases are the component of kinase modules which transfer information from sensors to responses in eukaryotes including plants. They play a pivotal role in transduction of diverse extracellular stimuli such as biotic and abiotic stresses as well as a range of developmental responses including differentiation, proliferation and death. Several cascades are induced by different biotic and abiotic stress stimuli such as pathogen infections, heavy metal, wounding, high and low temperatures, high salinity, UV radiation, ozone, reactive oxygen species, drought and high or low osmolarity. MAPK signaling has been implicated in biotic stresses and has also been associated with hormonal responses. The cascade is regulated by various mechanisms, including not only transcriptional and translational regulation but through post-transcriptional regulation such as protein-protein interactions. Recent detailed analysis of certain specific MAP kinase pathways have revealed the specificity of the kinases in the cascade, signal transduction patterns, identity of pathway targets and the complexity of the cascade. The latest insights and finding are discussed in this paper in relation to the role of MAPK pathway modules in plant stress signaling."

CHIKV invasion of susceptible cells is mediated by two viral glycoproteins, E1 and E2, which carry the main antigenic determinants and form an icosahedral shell at the virion surface. Glycoprotein E2, derived from furin cleavage of the p62 precursor into E3 and E2, is responsible for receptor binding, and E1 for membrane fusion. In the context of a concerted multidisciplinary effort to understand the biology of CHIKV, here we report the crystal structures of the precursor p62-E1 heterodimer and of the mature E3-E2-E1 glycoprotein complexes. The resulting atomic models allow the synthesis of a wealth of genetic, biochemical, immunological and electron microscopy data accumulated over the years on alphaviruses in general. This combination yields a detailed picture of the functional architecture of the 25 MDa alphavirus surface glycoprotein shell. Together with the accompanying report on the structure of the Sindbis virus E2-E1 heterodimer at acidic pH (ref. 3), this work also provides new insight into the acid-triggered conformational change on the virus particle and its inbuilt inhibition mechanism in the immature complex."
21190829,Comparison of different selenocompounds with respect to nutritional value vs. toxicity using liver cells in culture.,10.1016/j.jnutbio.2010.08.006,"The essential micronutrient selenium (Se) exerts its biological effects mainly through enzymatically active selenoproteins. Their biosynthesis depends on the 21st proteinogenic amino acid selenocysteine and thus on dietary Se supply. Hepatically derived selenoprotein P (SEPP) is the central selenoprotein in blood controlling Se transport and distribution. Kidney-derived extracellular glutathione peroxidase is another relevant serum selenoprotein depending on SEPP for biosynthesis. Therefore, secretion of SEPP by hepatocytes is crucial to convert nutritional sources into serum Se, supporting Se status and selenoprotein biosynthesis in other tissues. In order to compare the bioactivity of 10 different selenocompounds, their dose-dependent toxicities and nutritional qualities to support SEPP and glutathione peroxidase biosynthesis were determined in a murine and two human liver cell lines. Characteristic dose- and time-dependent effects on viability and SEPP production were observed. Incubations with 100 nM sodium selenite, l- or dl-selenocystine, selenodiglutathione or selenomethyl-selenocysteine increased SEPP concentrations in the culture medium up to 6.5-fold over control after 72 h. In comparison, sodium selenate, l- or dl-selenomethionine or methylseleninic acid was less effective and increased SEPP by 2.5-fold under these conditions. As expected, ebselen did not increase selenoprotein production, supporting its classification as a stable selenocompound. Methylseleninic acid, l-selenocystine, selenodiglutathione or selenite induced cell death in micromolar concentrations, whereas selenomethionine or ebselen was not toxic within the concentration range tested. Our results indicate that hepatic selenoprotein production and toxicity of selenocompounds do not correlate with and rather represent compound-specific properties. The favourable profile of selenomethylselenocysteine warrants its consideration as a promising option for supplementation purposes."
21232019,Tumor necrosis factor receptor cross-talk.,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08017.x,"Extensive research has been performed to unravel the mechanistic signaling pathways mediated by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), by contrast there is limited knowledge on cellular signaling upon activation of TNFR2. Recently published data have revealed that these two receptors not only function independently, but also can influence each other via cross-talk between the different signaling pathways initiated by TNFR1 and TNFR2 stimulation. Furthermore, the complexity of this cross-talk is also dependent on the different signaling kinetics between TNFR1 and TNFR2, by which a delicate balance between cell survival and apoptosis can be maintained. Some known signaling factors and the kinetics that are involved in the receptor cross-talk between TNFR1 and TNFR2 are the topic of this review."
21252347,A methylaspartate cycle in haloarchaea.,10.1126/science.1196544,"Access to novel ecological niches often requires adaptation of metabolic pathways to cope with new environments. For conversion to cellular building blocks, many substrates enter central carbon metabolism via acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Until now, only two such pathways have been identified: the glyoxylate cycle and the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Prokaryotes in the haloarchaea use a third pathway by which acetyl-CoA is oxidized to glyoxylate via the key intermediate methylaspartate. Glyoxylate condensation with another acetyl-CoA molecule yields malate, the final assimilation product. This cycle combines reactions that originally belonged to different metabolic processes in different groups of prokaryotes, which suggests lateral gene transfer and evolutionary tinkering of acetate assimilation. Moreover, it requires elevated intracellular glutamate concentrations, as well as coupling carbon assimilation with nitrogen metabolism."

Concerted efforts are underway to understand the specific interactions between gp120 and coreceptors as well as their contribution to the subsequent membrane fusion process. The present review summarizes the current knowledge on this biological aspect, which represents one of the key and essential points of the HIV-host cell interplay and HIV life cycle. The relevance of conformational HIV-1 Envelope proteins presented on Virus-like Particles for appropriate assessment of this molecular interaction, is also discussed."
21360054,New insights into the control of HIV-1 transcription: when Tat meets the 7SK snRNP and super elongation complex (SEC).,10.1007/s11481-011-9267-6,"Recent studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism controlling HIV-1 transcription have led to the identification and characterization of two multi-subunit complexes that both contain P-TEFb, a human transcription elongation factor and co-factor for activation of HIV-1 gene expression by the viral Tat protein. The first complex, termed the 7SK snRNP, acts as a reservoir where active P-TEFb can be withdrawn by Tat to stimulate HIV-1 transcription. The second complex, termed the super elongation complex (SEC), represents the form of P-TEFb delivered by Tat to the paused RNA polymerase II at the viral long terminal repeat during Tat transactivation. Besides P-TEFb, SEC also contains other elongation factors/co-activators, and they cooperatively stimulate HIV-1 transcription. Recent data also indicate SEC as a target for the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein to promote the expression of MLL target genes and leukemogenesis. Given their roles in HIV-1/AIDS and cancer, further characterization of 7SK snRNP and SEC will help develop strategies to suppress aberrant transcriptional elongation caused by uncontrolled P-TEFb activation. As both complexes are also important for normal cellular gene expression, studying their structures and functions will elucidate the mechanisms that control metazoan transcriptional elongation in general."
21488979,Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli: even more subversive elements.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07661.x,"The human pathogens enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC) share a unique mechanism of colonization that results from the concerted action of effector proteins translocated into the host cell by a type III secretion system (T3SS). EPEC and EHEC not only induce characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, but also subvert multiple host cell signalling pathways during infection. Our understanding of the mechanisms by which A/E pathogens hijack host cell signalling has advanced dramatically in recent months with the identification of novel activities for many effectors. In addition to further characterization of established effectors (Tir, EspH and Map), new effectors have emerged as important mediators of virulence through activities such as mimicry of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Map and EspM), inhibition of apoptosis (NleH and NleD), interference with inflammatory signalling pathways (NleB, NleC, NleE and NleH) and phagocytosis (EspF, EspH and EspJ). The findings have highlighted the multifunctional nature of the effectors and their ability to participate in redundant, synergistic or antagonistic relationships, acting in a co-ordinated spatial and temporal manner on different host organelles and cellular pathways during infection."
21502959,Mechanisms and functions of Hedgehog signalling across the metazoa.,10.1038/nrg2984,"Hedgehog proteins constitute one of a small number of families of secreted signals that have a central role in the development of metazoans. Genetic analyses in flies, fish and mice have uncovered the major components of the pathway that transduces Hedgehog signals, and recent genome sequence projects have provided clues about its evolutionary origins. In this Review we provide an updated overview of the mechanisms and functions of this signalling pathway, highlighting the conserved and divergent features of the pathway, as well as some of the common themes in its deployment that have emerged from recent studies."
21555513,Detailed structural and quantitative analysis reveals the spatial organization of the cell walls of in vivo grown Mycobacterium leprae and in vitro grown Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,10.1074/jbc.M110.210534,"The cell wall of mycobacteria consists of an outer membrane, analogous to that of gram-negative bacteria, attached to the peptidoglycan (PG) via a connecting polysaccharide arabinogalactan (AG). Although the primary structure of these components is fairly well deciphered, issues such as the coverage of the PG layer by covalently attached mycolates in the outer membrane and the spatial details of the mycolic acid attachment to the arabinan have remained unknown. It is also not understood how these components work together to lead to the classical acid-fast staining of mycobacteria. Because the majority of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria in established experimental animal infections are acid-fast negative, clearly cell wall changes are occurring. To address both the spatial properties of mycobacterial cell walls and to begin to study the differences between bacteria grown in animals and cultures, the cell walls of Mycobacterium leprae grown in armadillos was characterized and compared with that of M. tuberculosis grown in culture. Most fundamentally, it was determined that the cell wall of M. leprae contained significantly more mycolic acids attached to PG than that of in vitro grown M. tuberculosis (mycolate:PG ratios of 21:10 versus 16:10, respectively). In keeping with this difference, more arabinogalactan (AG) molecules, linking the mycolic acids to PG, were found. Differences in the structures of the AG were also found; the AG of M. leprae is smaller than that of M. tuberculosis, although the same basic structural motifs are retained."
21569500,Tat RNA silencing suppressor activity contributes to perturbation of lymphocyte miRNA by HIV-1.,10.1186/1742-4690-8-36,"MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated RNA silencing is integral to virtually every cellular process including cell cycle progression and response to virus infection. The interplay between RNA silencing and HIV-1 is multifaceted, and accumulating evidence posits a strike-counterstrike interface that alters the cellular environment to favor virus replication. For instance, miRNA-mediated RNA silencing of HIV-1 translation is antagonized by HIV-1 Tat RNA silencing suppressor activity. The activity of HIV-1 accessory proteins Vpr/Vif delays cell cycle progression, which is a process prominently modulated by miRNA. The expression profile of cellular miRNA is altered by HIV-1 infection in both cultured cells and clinical samples. The open question stands of what, if any, is the contribution of Tat RNA silencing suppressor activity or Vpr/Vif activity to the perturbation of cellular miRNA by HIV-1."
21660427,Variations on a theme: plant autophagy in comparison to yeast and mammals.,10.1007/s00709-011-0296-z,"Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved process of bulk degradation and nutrient sequestration that occurs in all eukaryotic cells. Yet, in recent years, autophagy has also been shown to play a role in the specific degradation of individual proteins or protein aggregates as well as of damaged organelles. The process was initially discovered in yeast and has also been very well studied in mammals and, to a lesser extent, in plants. In this review, we summarize what is known regarding the various functions of autopahgy in plants but also attempt to address some specific issues concerning plant autophagy, such as the insufficient knowledge regarding autophagy in various plant species other than Arabidopsis, the fact that some genes belonging to the core autophagy machinery in various organisms are still missing in plants, the existence of autophagy multigene families in plants and the possible operation of selective autophagy in plants, a study that is still in its infancy. In addition, we point to plant-specific autophagy processes, such as the participation of autophagy during development and germination of the seed, a unique plant organ. Throughout this review, we demonstrate that the use of innovative bioinformatic resources, together with recent biological discoveries (such as the ATG8-interacting motif), should pave the way to a more comprehensive understanding of the multiple functions of plant autophagy."
21666210,Genetic characterization of measles vaccine strains.,10.1093/infdis/jir097,"The complete genomic sequences of 9 measles vaccine strains were compared with the sequence of the Edmonston wild-type virus. AIK-C, Moraten, Rubeovax, Schwarz, and Zagreb are vaccine strains of the Edmonston lineage, whereas CAM-70, Changchun-47, Leningrad-4 and Shanghai-191 were derived from 4 different wild-type isolates. Nucleotide substitutions were found in the noncoding regions of the genomes as well as in all coding regions, leading to deduced amino acid substitutions in all 8 viral proteins. Although the precise mechanisms involved in the attenuation of individual measles vaccines remain to be elucidated, in vitro assays of viral protein functions and recombinant viruses with defined genetic modifications have been used to characterize the differences between vaccine and wild-type strains. Although almost every protein contributes to an attenuated phenotype, substitutions affecting host cell tropism, virus assembly, and the ability to inhibit cellular antiviral defense mechanisms play an especially important role in attenuation."
21701511,DNA interstrand crosslink repair and cancer.,10.1038/nrc3088,"Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic DNA lesions that prevent transcription and replication by inhibiting DNA strand separation. Agents that induce ICLs were one of the earliest, and are still the most widely used, forms of chemotherapeutic drug. Only recently, however, have we begun to understand how cells repair these lesions. Important insights have come from studies of individuals with Fanconi anaemia (FA), a rare genetic disorder that leads to ICL sensitivity. Understanding how the FA pathway links nucleases, helicases and other DNA-processing enzymes should lead to more targeted uses of ICL-inducing agents in cancer treatment and could provide novel insights into drug resistance."
21742267,Insights into the evolution of a complex virus from the crystal structure of vaccinia virus D13.,10.1016/j.str.2011.03.023,"The morphogenesis of poxviruses such as vaccinia virus (VACV) sees the virion shape mature from spherical to brick-shaped. Trimeric capsomers of the VACV D13 protein form a transitory, stabilizing lattice on the surface of the initial spherical immature virus particle. The crystal structure of D13 reveals that this major scaffolding protein comprises a double β barrel ""jelly-roll"" subunit arranged as pseudo-hexagonal trimers. These structural features are characteristic of the major capsid proteins of a lineage of large icosahedral double-stranded DNA viruses including human adenovirus and the bacteriophages PRD1 and PM2. Structure-based phylogenetic analysis confirms that VACV belongs to this lineage, suggesting that (analogously to higher organism embryogenesis) early poxvirus morphogenesis reflects their evolution from a lineage of viruses sharing a common icosahedral ancestor."
21766819,Pseudoglycosyltransferase catalyzes nonglycosidic C-N coupling in validamycin a biosynthesis.,10.1021/ja203574u,"Glycosyltransferases are ubiquitous in nature. They catalyze a glycosidic bond formation between sugar donors and sugar or nonsugar acceptors to produce oligo/polysaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosylated natural products, and other sugar-containing entities. However, a trehalose 6-phosphate synthase-like protein has been found to catalyze an unprecedented nonglycosidic C-N bond formation in the biosynthesis of the aminocyclitol antibiotic validamycin A. This dedicated 'pseudoglycosyltransferase' catalyzes a condensation between GDP-valienol and validamine 7-phosphate to give validoxylamine A 7'-phosphate with net retention of the 'anomeric' configuration of the donor cyclitol in the product. The enzyme operates in sequence with a phosphatase, which dephosphorylates validoxylamine A 7'-phosphate to validoxylamine A."
21833341,Mechanisms and evolution of oxidative sulfur metabolism in green sulfur bacteria.,10.3389/fmicb.2011.00116,"Green sulfur bacteria (GSB) constitute a closely related group of photoautotrophic and thiotrophic bacteria with limited phenotypic variation. They typically oxidize sulfide and thiosulfate to sulfate with sulfur globules as an intermediate. Based on genome sequence information from 15 strains, the distribution and phylogeny of enzymes involved in their oxidative sulfur metabolism was investigated. At least one homolog of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) is present in all strains. In all sulfur-oxidizing GSB strains except the earliest diverging Chloroherpeton thalassium, the sulfide oxidation product is further oxidized to sulfite by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR) system. This system consists of components horizontally acquired partly from sulfide-oxidizing and partly from sulfate-reducing bacteria. Depending on the strain, the sulfite is probably oxidized to sulfate by one of two different mechanisms that have different evolutionary origins: adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase or polysulfide reductase-like complex 3. Thiosulfate utilization by the SOX system in GSB has apparently been acquired horizontally from Proteobacteria. SoxCD does not occur in GSB, and its function in sulfate formation in other bacteria has been replaced by the DSR system in GSB. Sequence analyses suggested that the conserved soxJXYZAKBW gene cluster was horizontally acquired by Chlorobium phaeovibrioides DSM 265 from the Chlorobaculum lineage and that this acquisition was mediated by a mobile genetic element. Thus, the last common ancestor of currently known GSB was probably photoautotrophic, hydrogenotrophic, and contained SQR but not DSR or SOX. In addition, the predominance of the Chlorobium-Chlorobaculum-Prosthecochloris lineage among cultured GSB could be due to the horizontally acquired DSR and SOX systems. Finally, based upon structural, biochemical, and phylogenetic analyses, a uniform nomenclature is suggested for sqr genes in prokaryotes."
21867484,Tetrahydrobiopterin: biochemistry and pathophysiology.,10.1042/BJ20110293,"BH4 (6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin) is an essential cofactor of a set of enzymes that are of central metabolic importance, including four aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, alkylglycerol mono-oxygenase and three NOS (NO synthase) isoenzymes. Consequently, BH4 is present in probably every cell or tissue of higher organisms and plays a key role in a number of biological processes and pathological states associated with monoamine neurotransmitter formation, cardiovascular and endothelial dysfunction, the immune response and pain sensitivity. BH4 is formed de novo from GTP via a sequence of three enzymatic steps carried out by GTP cyclohydrolase I, 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase. An alternative or salvage pathway involves dihydrofolate reductase and may play an essential role in peripheral tissues. Cofactor regeneration requires pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase and dihydropteridine reductase, except for NOSs, in which the BH4 cofactor undergoes a one-electron redox cycle without the need for additional regeneration enzymes. With regard to the regulation of cofactor biosynthesis, the major controlling point is GTP cyclohydrolase I. BH4 biosynthesis is controlled in mammals by hormones and cytokines. BH4 deficiency due to autosomal recessive mutations in all enzymes, except for sepiapterin reductase, has been described as a cause of hyperphenylalaninaemia. A major contributor to vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension, ischaemic reperfusion injury, diabetes and others, appears to be an effect of oxidized BH4, which leads to an increased formation of oxygen-derived radicals instead of NO by decoupled NOS. Furthermore, several neurological diseases have been suggested to be a consequence of restricted cofactor availability, and oral cofactor replacement therapy to stabilize mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase in the BH4-responsive type of hyperphenylalaninaemia has an advantageous effect on pathological phenylalanine levels in patients."
21876149,Formation of plant metabolic gene clusters within dynamic chromosomal regions.,10.1073/pnas.1109273108,"In bacteria, genes with related functions often are grouped together in operons and are cotranscribed as a single polycistronic mRNA. In eukaryotes, functionally related genes generally are scattered across the genome. Notable exceptions include gene clusters for catabolic pathways in yeast, synthesis of secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi, and the major histocompatibility complex in animals. Until quite recently it was thought that gene clusters in plants were restricted to tandem duplicates (for example, arrays of leucine-rich repeat disease-resistance genes). However, operon-like clusters of coregulated nonhomologous genes are an emerging theme in plant biology, where they may be involved in the synthesis of certain defense compounds. These clusters are unlikely to have arisen by horizontal gene transfer, and the mechanisms behind their formation are poorly understood. Previously in thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) we identified an operon-like gene cluster that is required for the synthesis and modification of the triterpene thalianol. Here we characterize a second operon-like triterpene cluster (the marneral cluster) from A. thaliana, compare the features of these two clusters, and investigate the evolutionary events that have led to cluster formation. We conclude that common mechanisms are likely to underlie the assembly and control of operon-like gene clusters in plants."
21917929,"Structure of the Lassa virus nucleoprotein revealed by X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, and electron microscopy.",10.1074/jbc.M111.278838,"The nucleoprotein (NP) of Lassa virus (LASV) strain AV was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system. The crystal structure of full-length NP was solved at a resolution of 2.45 Å. The overall fold corresponds to that of NP of LASV strain Josiah (Qi, X., Lan, S., Wang, W., Schelde, L. M., Dong, H., Wallat, G. D., Ly, H., Liang, Y., and Dong, C. (2010) Nature 468, 779-783) with a root mean square deviation of 0.67 Å for all atoms (6.3% difference in primary sequence). As the packing in the crystal offers two different trimer architectures for the biological assembly, the quaternary structure of NP in solution was determined by small-angle x-ray scattering and EM. After classification and averaging of >6000 EM raw images, trimeric centrosymmetric structures were obtained, which correspond in size and shape to one trimer in the crystal structure formed around a crystallographic 3-fold rotation axis (symmetric trimer). The symmetric trimer is also a good model for the small-angle x-ray scattering data and could be well embedded into the ab initio model. The N-terminal domain of NP contains a deep nucleotide-binding cavity that has been proposed to bind cellular cap structures for priming viral mRNA synthesis. All residues implicated in m(7)GpppN binding were exchanged, and the transcription/replication phenotype of the NP mutant was tested using a LASV replicon system. None of the mutants showed a specific defect in mRNA expression; most were globally defective in RNA synthesis. In conclusion, we describe the full-length crystal structure and the quaternary structure in solution of LASV NP. The nucleotide-binding pocket of NP could not be assigned a specific role in viral mRNA synthesis."
21943085,The protein interaction map of bacteriophage lambda.,10.1186/1471-2180-11-213,Bacteriophage lambda is a model phage for most other dsDNA phages and has been studied for over 60 years. Although it is probably the best-characterized phage there are still about 20 poorly understood open reading frames in its 48-kb genome. For a complete understanding we need to know all interactions among its proteins. We have manually curated the lambda literature and compiled a total of 33 interactions that have been found among lambda proteins. We set out to find out how many protein-protein interactions remain to be found in this phage.

Here, we review the current literature on a relatively new O-glycosylation pathway, the mammalian O-mannosylation pathway. The importance of O-mannosylation is illustrated by the fact that O-mannose glycan structures play roles in a variety of processes including viral entry into cells, metastasis, cell adhesion, and neuronal development. Furthermore, mutations in the enzymes of this pathway are causal for a variety of congenital muscular dystrophies. Here we highlight the protein substrates, glycan structures, and enzymes involved in O-mannosylation as well as our gaps in understanding structure/function relationships in this biosynthetic pathway."
21953451,Identification of nicotinamide mononucleotide deamidase of the bacterial pyridine nucleotide cycle reveals a novel broadly conserved amidohydrolase family.,10.1074/jbc.M111.275818,"The pyridine nucleotide cycle is a network of salvage and recycling routes maintaining homeostasis of NAD(P) cofactor pool in the cell. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) deamidase (EC 3.5.1.42), one of the key enzymes of the bacterial pyridine nucleotide cycle, was originally described in Enterobacteria, but the corresponding gene eluded identification for over 30 years. A genomics-based reconstruction of NAD metabolism across hundreds of bacterial species suggested that NMN deamidase reaction is the only possible way of nicotinamide salvage in the marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. This prediction was verified via purification of native NMN deamidase from S. oneidensis followed by the identification of the respective gene, termed pncC. Enzymatic characterization of the PncC protein, as well as phenotype analysis of deletion mutants, confirmed its proposed biochemical and physiological function in S. oneidensis. Of the three PncC homologs present in Escherichia coli, NMN deamidase activity was confirmed only for the recombinant purified product of the ygaD gene. A comparative analysis at the level of sequence and three-dimensional structure, which is available for one of the PncC family member, shows no homology with any previously described amidohydrolases. Multiple alignment analysis of functional and nonfunctional PncC homologs, together with NMN docking experiments, allowed us to tentatively identify the active site area and conserved residues therein. An observed broad phylogenomic distribution of predicted functional PncCs in the bacterial kingdom is consistent with a possible role in detoxification of NMN, resulting from NAD utilization by DNA ligase."
22031445,Saccharomyces cerevisiae THI4p is a suicide thiamine thiazole synthase.,10.1038/nature10503,"Thiamine pyrophosphate 1 is an essential cofactor in all living systems. Its biosynthesis involves the separate syntheses of the pyrimidine 2 and thiazole 3 precursors, which are then coupled. Two biosynthetic routes to the thiamine thiazole have been identified. In prokaryotes, five enzymes act on three substrates to produce the thiazole via a complex oxidative condensation reaction, the mechanistic details of which are now well established. In contrast, only one gene product is involved in thiazole biosynthesis in eukaryotes (THI4p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Here we report the preparation of fully active recombinant wild-type THI4p, the identification of an iron-dependent sulphide transfer reaction from a conserved cysteine residue of the protein to a reaction intermediate and the demonstration that THI4p is a suicide enzyme undergoing only a single turnover."
22031465,"Microbial degradation of furanic compounds: biochemistry, genetics, and impact.",10.1007/s00253-011-3632-5,"Microbial metabolism of furanic compounds, especially furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), is rapidly gaining interest in the scientific community. This interest can largely be attributed to the occurrence of toxic furanic aldehydes in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. However, these compounds are also widespread in nature and in human processed foods, and are produced in industry. Although several microorganisms are known to degrade furanic compounds, the variety of species is limited mostly to Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with a few notable exceptions. Furanic aldehydes are highly toxic to microorganisms, which have evolved a wide variety of defense mechanisms, such as the oxidation and/or reduction to the furanic alcohol and acid forms. These oxidation/reduction reactions constitute the initial steps of the biological pathways for furfural and HMF degradation. Furfural degradation proceeds via 2-furoic acid, which is metabolized to the primary intermediate 2-oxoglutarate. HMF is converted, via 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, into 2-furoic acid. The enzymes in these HMF/furfural degradation pathways are encoded by eight hmf genes, organized in two distinct clusters in Cupriavidus basilensis HMF14. The organization of the five genes of the furfural degradation cluster is highly conserved among microorganisms capable of degrading furfural, while the three genes constituting the initial HMF degradation route are organized in a highly diverse manner. The genetic and biochemical characterization of the microbial metabolism of furanic compounds holds great promises for industrial applications such as the biodetoxifcation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates and the production of value-added compounds such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid."
22069531,Predicted roles of the uncharacterized clustered genes in aflatoxin biosynthesis.,10.3390/toxins1010037,"Biosynthesis of the toxic and carcinogenic aflatoxins (AFs) requires the activity of more than 27 enzymes. The roles in biosynthesis of newly described enzymes are discussed in this review. We suggest that HypC catalyzes the oxidation of norsolorinic acid anthrone; AvfA (AflI), the ring-closure step in formation of hydroxyversicolorone; HypB, the second oxidation step in conversion of O-methylsterigmatocystin to AF; and HypE and NorA (AflE), the final two steps in AFB(1) formation. HypD, an integral membrane protein, affects fungal development and lowers AF production while AflJ (AflS), has a partial methyltransferase domain that may be important in its function as a transcriptional co-activator."

To gain insight into the sulfur metabolism, the proteome of Cba. tepidum cells sampled under different growth conditions has been quantified using a rapid gel-free, filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol with an in-solution isotopic labeling strategy. Among the 2245 proteins predicted from the Cba. tepidum genome, approximately 970 proteins were detected in unlabeled samples, whereas approximately 630-640 proteins were detected in labeled samples comparing two different growth conditions. Wild-type cells growing on thiosulfate had an increased abundance of periplasmic cytochrome c-555 and proteins of the periplasmic thiosulfate-oxidizing SOX enzyme system when compared with cells growing on sulfide. A dsrM mutant of Cba. tepidum, which lacks the dissimilatory sulfite reductase DsrM protein and therefore is unable to oxidize sulfur globules to sulfite, was also investigated. When compared with wild type, the dsrM cells exhibited an increased abundance of DSR enzymes involved in the initial steps of sulfur globule oxidation (DsrABCL) and a decreased abundance of enzymes putatively involved in sulfite oxidation (Sat-AprAB-QmoABC). The results show that Cba. tepidum regulates the cellular levels of enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism and other electron-transferring processes in response to the availability of reduced sulfur compounds."
22174182,Regulation of cell wall biogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the cell wall integrity signaling pathway.,10.1534/genetics.111.128264,"The yeast cell wall is a strong, but elastic, structure that is essential not only for the maintenance of cell shape and integrity, but also for progression through the cell cycle. During growth and morphogenesis, and in response to environmental challenges, the cell wall is remodeled in a highly regulated and polarized manner, a process that is principally under the control of the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway. This pathway transmits wall stress signals from the cell surface to the Rho1 GTPase, which mobilizes a physiologic response through a variety of effectors. Activation of CWI signaling regulates the production of various carbohydrate polymers of the cell wall, as well as their polarized delivery to the site of cell wall remodeling. This review article centers on CWI signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through the cell cycle and in response to cell wall stress. The interface of this signaling pathway with other pathways that contribute to the maintenance of cell wall integrity is also discussed."
22193161,Sorting nexins provide diversity for retromer-dependent trafficking events.,10.1038/ncb2374,"Sorting nexins are a large family of evolutionarily conserved phosphoinositide-binding proteins that have fundamental roles in orchestrating cargo sorting through the membranous maze that is the endosomal network. One ancient group of complexes that contain sorting nexins is the retromer. Here we discuss how retromer complexes regulate endosomal sorting, and describe how this is generating exciting new insight into the central role played by endosomal sorting in development and homeostasis of normal tissues."
22215586,Localization of the proteasomal ubiquitin receptors Rpn10 and Rpn13 by electron cryomicroscopy.,10.1073/pnas.1119394109,"Two canonical subunits of the 26S proteasome, Rpn10 and Rpn13, function as ubiquitin (Ub) receptors. The mutual arrangement of these subunits--and all other non-ATPase subunits--in the regulatory particle is unknown. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we calculated difference maps between wild-type 26S proteasome from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and deletion mutants (rpn10Δ, rpn13Δ, and rpn10Δrpn13Δ). These maps allowed us to localize the two Ub receptors unambiguously. Rpn10 and Rpn13 mapped to the apical part of the 26S proteasome, above the N-terminal coiled coils of the AAA-ATPase heterodimers Rpt4/Rpt5 and Rpt1/Rpt2, respectively. On the basis of the mutual positions of Rpn10 and Rpn13, we propose a model for polyubiquitin binding to the 26S proteasome."
22219507,The regulation of filamentous growth in yeast.,10.1534/genetics.111.127456,"Filamentous growth is a nutrient-regulated growth response that occurs in many fungal species. In pathogens, filamentous growth is critical for host-cell attachment, invasion into tissues, and virulence. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes filamentous growth, which provides a genetically tractable system to study the molecular basis of the response. Filamentous growth is regulated by evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways. One of these pathways is a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. A remarkable feature of the filamentous growth MAPK pathway is that it is composed of factors that also function in other pathways. An intriguing challenge therefore has been to understand how pathways that share components establish and maintain their identity. Other canonical signaling pathways-rat sarcoma/protein kinase A (RAS/PKA), sucrose nonfermentable (SNF), and target of rapamycin (TOR)-also regulate filamentous growth, which raises the question of how signals from multiple pathways become integrated into a coordinated response. Together, these pathways regulate cell differentiation to the filamentous type, which is characterized by changes in cell adhesion, cell polarity, and cell shape. How these changes are accomplished is also discussed. High-throughput genomics approaches have recently uncovered new connections to filamentous growth regulation. These connections suggest that filamentous growth is a more complex and globally regulated behavior than is currently appreciated, which may help to pave the way for future investigations into this eukaryotic cell differentiation behavior."
22221911,Effect of oxygen on the anaerobic methanotroph 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera': kinetic and transcriptional analysis.,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02682.x,"'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' is a denitrifying methanotroph that performs nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation through a newly discovered intra-aerobic pathway. In this study, we investigated the response of a M. oxyfera enrichment culture to oxygen. Addition of either 2% or 8% oxygen resulted in an instant decrease of methane and nitrite conversion rates. Oxygen exposure also led to a deviation in the nitrite to methane oxidation stoichiometry. Oxygen-uptake and inhibition studies with cell-free extracts displayed a change from cytochrome c to quinol as electron donor after exposure to oxygen. The change in global gene expression was monitored by deep sequencing of cDNA using Illumina technology. After 24 h of oxygen exposure, transcription levels of 1109 (out of 2303) genes changed significantly when compared with the anoxic period. Most of the genes encoding enzymes of the methane oxidation pathway were constitutively expressed. Genes from the denitrification pathway, with exception of one of the putative nitric oxide reductases, norZ2, were severely downregulated. The majority of known genes involved in the vital cellular functions, such as nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis and cell division processes, were downregulated. The alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, ahpC, and genes involved in the synthesis/repair of the iron-sulfur clusters were among the few upregulated genes. Further, transcription of the pmoCAB genes of aerobic methanotrophs present in the non-M. oxyfera community were triggered by the presence of oxygen. Our results show that oxygen-exposed cells of M. oxyfera were under oxidative stress and that in spite of its oxygenic capacity, exposure to microoxic conditions has an overall detrimental effect."

Autophagy is a macromolecule degradation pathway that recycles damaged or unwanted cell materials upon encountering stress conditions or during specific developmental processes. Over the past decade, our molecular and physiological understanding of plant autophagy has greatly increased. Most of the essential machinery required for autophagy seems to be conserved from yeast to plants. Plant autophagy has been shown to function in various stress responses, pathogen defense, and senescence. Some of its potential upstream regulators have also been identified. Here, we describe recent advances in our understanding of autophagy in plants, discuss areas of controversy, and highlight potential future directions in autophagy research."

The genes encoding the enzymes occur as a cluster on the chromosomal DNA of Mesorhizobium loti, a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium. Here, it was found that disruption of the mll6786 gene, which is located between the genes encoding the first and eighth enzymes of the pathway, caused constitutive expression of the eight enzymes. The protein encoded by the mll6786 gene is a member of the GntR family and is designated as PyrR. PyrR comprises 223 amino acid residues and is a dimeric protein with a subunit molecular mass of 25 kDa. The purified PyrR with a C-terminal His(6) -tag could bind to an intergenic 67-bp DNA region, which contains a palindrome sequence and a deduced promoter sequence, between the mll6786 and mlr6787 genes, encoding PyrR and AAMS amidohydrolase, respectively."
22296764,Signaling in innate immunity and inflammation.,10.1101/cshperspect.a006049,"Inflammation is triggered when innate immune cells detect infection or tissue injury. Surveillance mechanisms involve pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm. Most PRRs respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by triggering activation of NF-κB, AP1, CREB, c/EBP, and IRF transcription factors. Induction of genes encoding enzymes, chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and regulators of the extracellular matrix promotes the recruitment and activation of leukocytes, which are critical for eliminating foreign particles and host debris. A subset of PRRs activates the protease caspase-1, which causes maturation of the cytokines IL1β and IL18. Cell adhesion molecules and chemokines facilitate leukocyte extravasation from the circulation to the affected site, the chemokines stimulating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Binding initiates signals that regulate leukocyte motility and effector functions. Other triggers of inflammation include allergens, which form antibody complexes that stimulate Fc receptors on mast cells. Although the role of inflammation is to resolve infection and injury, increasing evidence indicates that chronic inflammation is a risk factor for cancer."
22443545,The complete genome sequence of the acarbose producer Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110.,10.1186/1471-2164-13-112,"Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 is known as the wild type producer of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, a potent drug used worldwide in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus. As the incidence of diabetes is rapidly rising worldwide, an ever increasing demand for diabetes drugs, such as acarbose, needs to be anticipated. Consequently, derived Actinoplanes strains with increased acarbose yields are being used in large scale industrial batch fermentation since 1990 and were continuously optimized by conventional mutagenesis and screening experiments. This strategy reached its limits and is generally superseded by modern genetic engineering approaches. As a prerequisite for targeted genetic modifications, the complete genome sequence of the organism has to be known."

For the first time, the two glucosyltransferases UGT75L6 and UGT94E5 that sequentially mediate the final glucosylation steps in crocin biosynthesis in G. jasminoides have been identified and functionally characterized. UGT75L6 preferentially glucosylates the carboxyl group of crocetin yielding crocetin glucosyl esters, while UGT94E5 glucosylates the 6' hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety of crocetin glucosyl esters. The expression pattern of neither UGT75L6 nor UGT94E5 correlated with the pattern of crocin accumulation in G. jasminoides."

In this study, we identified a novel dihydrodaidzein racemase (L-DDRC) that is involved in equol biosynthesis in a lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus sp. strain 20-92, and confirmed that histidine-tagged recombinant L-DDRC (L-DDRC-His) was able to convert both the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of dihydrodaidzein to the racemate. Moreover, we showed that recombinant L-DDRC-His was essential for in vitro equol production from daidzein by a recombinant enzyme mixture and that efficient in vitro equol production from daidzein was possible using at least four enzymes, including L-DDRC. We also proposed a model of the metabolic pathway from daidzein to equol in Lactococcus strain 20-92."

These prokaryotes use multiheme c-type proteins to shuttle electrons from electron donors, and electron transport complexes presumed to contain b-type hemoproteins contribute to proton charging of the membrane. Numerous sulfate and sulfur reducers use an alternate pathway for heme synthesis and, frequently, uniquely specific axial ligands are used to secure c-type heme to the protein. This review presents some of the types and functional activities of hemoproteins involved in these two dissimilatory reduction pathways."

Recent studies have revealed sophisticated and complicated expression mechanisms for HNK-1 glycan. Activities of biosynthetic enzymes are controlled through the formation of enzyme-complexes and regulation of subcellular localization. Functional aspects of HNK-1 carbohydrate were examined by overexpression, knockdown, and knockout studies of these enzymes. HNK-1 is involved in several neural functions such as synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and the underlying molecular mechanisms have been illustrated upon identification of the target carrier glycoproteins of HNK-1 such as the glutamate receptor subunit GluA2 or tenascin-R. In this review, we describe recent findings about HNK-1 carbohydrate that provide further insights into the mechanism of its expression and function in the nervous system."

This chapter summarizes published protein interaction data of intraviral protein interactions, as well as known phage-host protein interactions of these phages retrieved from the literature. We also review the published results of comprehensive protein interaction analyses of Pneumococcus phages Dp-1 and Cp-1, as well as coliphages λ and T7. For example, the ≈55 proteins encoded by the T7 genome are connected by ≈43 interactions with another ≈15 between the phage and its host. The chapter compiles published interactions for the well-studied phages λ (33 intra-phage/22 phage-host), P22 (38/9), P2/P4 (14/3), and ϕ29 (20/2). We discuss whether different interaction patterns reflect different phage lifestyles or whether they may be artifacts of sampling. Phages that infect the same host can interact with different host target proteins, as exemplified by E. coli phage λ and T7. Despite decades of intensive investigation, only a fraction of these phage interactomes are known. Technical limitations and a lack of depth in many studies explain the gaps in our knowledge. Strategies to complete current interactome maps are described. Although limited space precludes detailed overviews of phage molecular biology, this compilation will allow future studies to put interaction data into the context of phage biology."

The ltm genes responsible for the synthesis of these metabolites are organized in three clusters at a single sub-telomeric locus in the genome of E. festucae. Here we resolve the genetic basis for the remarkable indole-diterpene diversity observed in planta by analyzing products that accumulate in associations containing ltm deletion mutants of E. festucae and in cells of Penicillium paxilli containing copies of these genes under the control of a P. paxilli biosynthetic gene promoter. We propose a biosynthetic scheme to account for this metabolic diversity."
22764279,"Beginning to understand autophagy, an intracellular self-degradation system in plants.",10.1093/pcp/pcs099,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process for the vacuolar degradation of cytoplasmic components. There is no doubt that autophagy is very important to plant life, especially because plants are immobile and must survive in environmental extremes. Early studies of autophagy provided our first insights into the structural characteristics of the process in plants, but for a long time the molecular mechanisms and the physiological roles of autophagy were not understood. Genetic analyses of autophagy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have greatly expanded our knowledge of the molecular aspects of autophagy in plants as well as in animals. Until recently our knowledge of plant autophagy was in its infancy compared with autophagy research in yeast and animals, but recent efforts by plant researchers have made many advances in our understanding of plant autophagy. Here I will introduce an overview of autophagy in plants, present current findings and discuss the physiological roles of self-degradation."

SE50/110 led to the identification of gene products involved in acarbose metabolism.,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.08.011,"The pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose is a medically relevant secondary metabolite produced by strains of the genera Actinoplanes and Streptomyces. In this study gene products involved in acarbose metabolism were identified by analyzing the cytosolic and extracellular proteome of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 cultures grown in a high-maltose minimal medium. The analysis by 2D protein gel electrophoresis of cytosolic proteins of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 resulted in 318 protein spots and 162 identified proteins. Nine of those were acarbose cluster proteins (Acb-proteins), namely AcbB, AcbD, AcbE, AcbK, AcbL, AcbN, AcbR, AcbV and AcbZ. The analysis of proteins in the extracellular space of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 cultures resulted in about 100 protein spots and 22 identified proteins. The identifications included the three acarbose gene cluster proteins AcbD, AcbE and AcbZ. After their identification, proteins were classified into functional groups. The dominant functional groups were the carbohydrate binding, carbohydrate cleavage and carbohydrate transport proteins. The other functional groups included protein cleavage, amino acid degradation, nucleic acid cleavage and a number of functionally uncharacterized proteins. In addition, signal peptide structures of extracellularly found proteins were analyzed. Of the 22 detected proteins 19 contained signal peptides, while 2 had N-terminal transmembrane helices explaining their localization. The only protein having neither of them was enolase. Under the conditions applied, the secretome of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 was dominated by seven proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism (PulA, AcbE, AcbD, MalE, AglE, CbpA and Cgt). Of special interest were the identified extracellular pullulanase PulA and the two solute-binding proteins MalE and AglE. The identifications suggest that Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 has two maltose/maltodextrin import systems. We postulate the identified MalEFG transport system of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/100 as the missing acarbose-metabolite importer and present a model of acarbose metabolism that is extended by the newly identified gene products."
22982583,Unifying concepts in anaerobic respiration: insights from dissimilatory sulfur metabolism.,10.1016/j.bbabio.2012.09.001,"Behind the versatile nature of prokaryotic energy metabolism is a set of redox proteins having a highly modular character. It has become increasingly recognized that a limited number of redox modules or building blocks appear grouped in different arrangements, giving rise to different proteins and functionalities. This modularity most likely reveals a common and ancient origin for these redox modules, and is obviously reflected in similar energy conservation mechanisms. The dissimilation of sulfur compounds was probably one of the earliest biological strategies used by primitive organisms to obtain energy. Here, we review some of the redox proteins involved in dissimilatory sulfur metabolism, focusing on sulfate reducing organisms, and highlight links between these proteins and others involved in different processes of anaerobic respiration. Noteworthy are links to the complex iron-sulfur molybdoenzyme family, and heterodisulfide reductases of methanogenic archaea. We discuss how chemiosmotic and electron bifurcation/confurcation may be involved in energy conservation during sulfate reduction, and how introduction of an additional module, multiheme cytochromes c, opens an alternative bioenergetic strategy that seems to increase metabolic versatility. Finally, we highlight new families of heterodisulfide reductase-related proteins from non-methanogenic organisms, which indicate a widespread distribution for these protein modules and may indicate a more general involvement of thiol/disulfide conversions in energy metabolism. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: The evolutionary aspects of bioenergetic systems."

Understanding how bacteria integrate signals from various environmental factors and quorum sensing autoinducers to regulate the metabolism of various nucleotide second messengers c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP, cGMP, cAMP and ppGpp, which control several key processes required for adaptation is key for efforts to develop agents to curb bacterial infections. In this review, we provide an update of nucleotide signaling in bacteria and show how these signals intersect or integrate to regulate the bacterial phenotype. The intracellular concentrations of nucleotide second messengers in bacteria are regulated by synthases and phosphodiesterases and a significant number of these metabolism enzymes had been biochemically characterized but it is only in the last few years that the effector proteins and RNA riboswitches, which regulate bacterial physiology upon binding to nucleotides, have been identified and characterized by biochemical and structural methods. C-di-GMP, in particular, has attracted immense interest because it is found in many bacteria and regulate both biofilm formation and virulence factors production. In this review, we discuss how the activities of various c-di-GMP effector proteins and riboswitches are modulated upon c-di-GMP binding. Using V. cholerae, E. coli and B. subtilis as models, we discuss how both environmental factors and quorum sensing autoinducers regulate the metabolism and/or processing of nucleotide second messengers. The chemical syntheses of the various nucleotide second messengers and the use of analogs thereof as antibiofilm or immune modulators are also discussed."
23028184,Response to hyperosmotic stress.,10.1534/genetics.112.140863,"An appropriate response and adaptation to hyperosmolarity, i.e., an external osmolarity that is higher than the physiological range, can be a matter of life or death for all cells. It is especially important for free-living organisms such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When exposed to hyperosmotic stress, the yeast initiates a complex adaptive program that includes temporary arrest of cell-cycle progression, adjustment of transcription and translation patterns, and the synthesis and retention of the compatible osmolyte glycerol. These adaptive responses are mostly governed by the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is composed of membrane-associated osmosensors, an intracellular signaling pathway whose core is the Hog1 MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade, and cytoplasmic and nuclear effector functions. The entire pathway is conserved in diverse fungal species, while the Hog1 MAPK cascade is conserved even in higher eukaryotes including humans. This conservation is illustrated by the fact that the mammalian stress-responsive p38 MAPK can rescue the osmosensitivity of hog1Δ mutations in response to hyperosmotic challenge. As the HOG pathway is one of the best-understood eukaryotic signal transduction pathways, it is useful not only as a model for analysis of osmostress responses, but also as a model for mathematical analysis of signal transduction pathways. In this review, we have summarized the current understanding of both the upstream signaling mechanism and the downstream adaptive responses to hyperosmotic stress in yeast."

In this study, we isolated fumitremorgin A from N. fischeri. This led to the identification of the responsible gene, ftmPT3, for O-prenylation of an aliphatic hydroxy group in verruculogen. This gene was found at a different location in the genome of N. fischeri than the identified cluster. The coding sequence of ftmPT3 was amplified by fusion PCR and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme product of the soluble His(8)-FtmPT3 with verruculogen and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) was identified unequivocally as fumitremorgin A by NMR and MS analyses. K(M) values of FtmPT3 were determined for verruculogen and DMAPP at 5.7 and 61.5 μM, respectively. Average turnover number (k(cat)) was calculated from kinetic parameters of verruculogen and DMAPP to be 0.069 s(-1). FtmPT3 also accepted biosynthetic precursors of fumitremorgin A, for example, fumitremorgin B and 12,13-dihydroxyfumitremorgin C, as substrates and catalyses their prenylation."
23178000,Small RNAs and their role in biofilm formation.,10.1016/j.tim.2012.10.008,"The formation of biofilms is initiated by bacteria transitioning from the planktonic to the surface-associated mode of growth. Several regulatory systems have been described to govern the initiation and subsequent formation of biofilms. Recent evidence suggests that regulatory networks governing the decision of bacteria whether to attach and form biofilms or remain as planktonic cells are further subject to regulation by small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). This is accomplished by sRNAs fine-tuning regulatory networks to enable concentration-specific responses by sequestering, antagonizing, or activating regulatory proteins in response to environmental cues, or by directly affecting the synthesis of proteins promoting or disfavoring the formation of biofilms. This review gives an overview of the contribution of sRNAs in regulating the switch from the planktonic to the sessile bacterial lifestyle by highlighting how sRNAs converge with known regulatory systems required for biofilm formation."

Because terpendole E production is unstable, we isolated and analyzed the terpendole E biosynthetic gene cluster, which consists of seven genes encoding three P450 monooxygenases (TerP, TerQ, and TerK), an FAD-dependent monooxygenase (TerM), a terpene cyclase (TerB), and two prenyltransferases (TerC and TerF). Gene knockout and feeding experiments revealed that terpendole E is a key intermediate in terpendole biosynthesis and is produced by the action of the key enzyme TerQ from paspaline, a common biosynthetic intermediate of indole-diterpenes. TerP converts terpendole E to a downstream intermediate specific to terpendole biosynthesis and converts paspaline to shunt metabolites. We successfully overproduced terpendole E by disrupting the terP gene. We propose that terpendole E is a key biosynthetic intermediate of terpendoles and related indole-diterpenes."
23263767,A MAPK cascade downstream of ERECTA receptor-like protein kinase regulates Arabidopsis inflorescence architecture by promoting localized cell proliferation.,10.1105/tpc.112.104695,"Spatiotemporal-specific cell proliferation and cell differentiation are critical to the formation of normal tissues, organs, and organisms. The highly coordinated cell differentiation and proliferation events illustrate the importance of cell-cell communication during growth and development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ERECTA (ER), a receptor-like protein kinase, plays important roles in promoting localized cell proliferation, which determines inflorescence architecture, organ shape, and size. However, the downstream signaling components remain unidentified. Here, we report a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; or MPK) cascade that functions downstream of ER in regulating localized cell proliferation. Similar to an er mutant, loss of function of MPK3/MPK6 or their upstream MAPK kinases (MAPKKs; or MKKs), MKK4/MKK5, resulted in shortened pedicels and clustered inflorescences. Epistasis analysis demonstrated that the gain of function of MKK4 and MKK5 transgenes could rescue the loss-of-function er mutant phenotype at both morphological and cellular levels, suggesting that the MPK3/MPK6 cascade functions downstream of the ER receptor. Furthermore, YODA (YDA), a MAPKK kinase, was shown to be upstream of MKK4/MKK5 and downstream of ER in regulating inflorescence architecture based on both gain- and loss-of-function data. Taken together, these results suggest that the YDA-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 cascade functions downstream of the ER receptor in regulating localized cell proliferation, which further shapes the morphology of plant organs."
23279921,Unraveling the function of the two Entner-Doudoroff branches in the thermoacidophilic Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2.,10.1111/febs.12106,"Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 is a thermoacidophilic archaeon that metabolizes glucose and galactose via an unusual branched Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, which is characterized by a non-phosphorylative (np) and a semi-phosphorylative (sp) branch. However, so far the physiological significance of the two pathway branches is unknown. In order to address these questions two key enzymes of the branched ED pathway, the class II glycerate kinase (GK) of the np-ED branch and the 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase (KDGK) of the sp-ED branch in S. solfataricus, were investigated. GK was recombinantly purified and characterized with respect to its kinetic properties. Mg(2+) dependent Sso-GK (glycerate + ATP → 2-phosphoglycerate + ADP) showed unusual regulatory properties, i.e. substrate inhibition and cooperativity by D-glycerate and ATP, and a substrate-inhibition model was established fitting closely to the experimental data. Furthermore, deletion of the sp-ED key enzyme KDGK in S. solfataricus PBL2025 resulted in a similar growth phenotype on glucose as substrate compared with the wild-type. In contrast, the mutant showed strongly increased concentrations of np-ED intermediates whereas the hexose and pentose phosphates as well as trehalose were decreased. Together the results indicate (a) that the np-ED pathway is able to compensate for the missing sp-ED branch in glucose catabolism, (b) that in addition to its catabolic function the sp-ED pathway has an additional although not essential role in providing sugar phosphates for anabolism/gluconeogenesis and (c) that GK, with its unusual regulatory properties, seems to play a major role in controlling the flux between the glycolytic np-ED and the glycolytic/gluconeogenetic sp-ED pathway."

TYM3221, is able to grow on biphenyl and degrades 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE) via a meta-ring cleavage pathway. The bphAa gene, encoding a biphenyl dioxygenase large subunit, was previously demonstrated to be involved in the degradation of DDE in TYM3221. The bph gene cluster, containing orf2 and bphDAaAbAcAdBCST was cloned and characterized. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that these genes were transcribed as an operon. The real-time RT-PCR on orf2, bphAa, bphC, and bphS suggest the presence of the inducible orf2 promoter (orf2p) and constitutive bphAa promoter (bphAap). The TYM3221 bphST conducted biphenyl-dependent inducible activation plus constitutive basal activation of orf2p and constitutive activation of bphAap in a rhodococcal host strain, Rhodococcus erythropolis IAM1399, suggesting that expression of the TYM3221 bph operon depends on the bphST-coded two-component regulatory system. Both of these promoters were also induced by the bphS1T1 of a biphenyl degrader, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, and contained the 24-bp consensus sequences of RHA1 bphS1T1-dependent promoters. The replacement of RHA1 bphS1 with TYM3221 bphS in combination with RHA1 bphT1 suggests that TYM3221 bphS is responsible for low inducible and high constitutive activation of orf2p in IAM1399 by the TYM3221 bphST-system. Expression of bphAaAbAcAdBC in IAM1399 resulted in the transformation of DDE to the meta-ring cleavage product via 2,3-hydroxylation, suggesting that these genes are involved in DDE degradation."
23443158,Small Regulatory RNAs in the Control of Motility and Biofilm Formation in E. coli and Salmonella.,10.3390/ijms14034560,"Biofilm formation in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria involves the inverse regulation of the synthesis of flagella and biofilm matrix components such as amyloid curli fibres, cellulose, colanic acid and poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PGA). Physiologically, these processes reflect the transition from growth to stationary phase. At the molecular level, they are tightly controlled by various sigma factors competing for RNA polymerase, a series of transcription factors acting in hierarchical regulatory cascades and several nucleotide messengers, including cyclic-di-GMP. In addition, a surprisingly large number of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) have been shown to directly or indirectly modulate motility and/or biofilm formation. This review aims at giving an overview of these sRNA regulators and their impact in biofilm formation in E. coli and Salmonella. Special emphasis will be put on sRNAs, that have known targets such as the mRNAs of the flagellar master regulator FlhDC, the stationary phase sigma factor σS (RpoS) and the key biofilm regulator CsgD that have recently been shown to act as major hubs for regulation by multiple sRNAs."
23495936,Molecular architecture and assembly of the eukaryotic proteasome.,10.1146/annurev-biochem-060410-150257,"The eukaryotic ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for most aspects of regulatory and quality-control protein degradation in cells. Its substrates, which are usually modified by polymers of ubiquitin, are ultimately degraded by the 26S proteasome. This 2.6-MDa protein complex is separated into a barrel-shaped proteolytic 20S core particle (CP) of 28 subunits capped on one or both ends by a 19S regulatory particle (RP) comprising at least 19 subunits. The RP coordinates substrate recognition, removal of substrate polyubiquitin chains, and substrate unfolding and translocation into the CP for degradation. Although many atomic structures of the CP have been determined, the RP has resisted high-resolution analysis. Recently, however, a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, biochemical analysis, and crystal structure determination of several RP subunits has yielded a near-atomic-resolution view of much of the complex. Major new insights into chaperone-assisted proteasome assembly have also recently emerged. Here we review these novel findings."
23531747,Tumor Necrosis Factor-α: Life and Death of Hepatocytes During Liver Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.,,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine involved in a variety of disease pathologies, including ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries in transplantation. The interaction of TNF-α with its cognate receptor TNF receptor I (TNFRI) results in the activation of signal transduction pathways that regulate either cell survival or cell death. Hepatocytes express TNFRI and respond to TNF-α released by resident Kupffer cells as well as leukocytes that migrate to the liver during I/R injury. Upon binding TNF-α, the hepatocyte proliferates or undergoes apoptosis or necroptosis. The decision by the cell to commit to one path or the other is not understood. The damaged tissue exhibits cell death and hemorrhaging from the influx of immune mediators. TNF-α inhibitors ameliorate the injury in animal models, suggesting that lowering (but not eliminating) TNF-α levels shifts the balance of TNF-α toward its beneficial functions."
23577234,Structural analyses at pseudo atomic resolution of Chikungunya virus and antibodies show mechanisms of neutralization.,10.7554/eLife.00435,"A 5.3 Å resolution, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) map of Chikungunya virus-like particles (VLPs) has been interpreted using the previously published crystal structure of the Chikungunya E1-E2 glycoprotein heterodimer. The heterodimer structure was divided into domains to obtain a good fit to the cryoEM density. Differences in the T = 4 quasi-equivalent heterodimer components show their adaptation to different environments. The spikes on the icosahedral 3-fold axes and those in general positions are significantly different, possibly representing different phases during initial generation of fusogenic E1 trimers. CryoEM maps of neutralizing Fab fragments complexed with VLPs have been interpreted using the crystal structures of the Fab fragments and the VLP structure. Based on these analyses the CHK-152 antibody was shown to stabilize the viral surface, hindering the exposure of the fusion-loop, likely neutralizing infection by blocking fusion. The CHK-9, m10 and m242 antibodies surround the receptor-attachment site, probably inhibiting infection by blocking cell attachment. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00435.001."

The same enzyme also helps improving turnover of LovB through hydrolysis of incorrectly tailored intermediates.
23719463,Mature HIV-1 capsid structure by cryo-electron microscopy and all-atom molecular dynamics.,10.1038/nature12162,"Retroviral capsid proteins are conserved structurally but assemble into different morphologies. The mature human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) capsid is best described by a 'fullerene cone' model, in which hexamers of the capsid protein are linked to form a hexagonal surface lattice that is closed by incorporating 12 capsid-protein pentamers. HIV-1 capsid protein contains an amino-terminal domain (NTD) comprising seven α-helices and a β-hairpin, a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) comprising four α-helices, and a flexible linker with a 310-helix connecting the two structural domains. Structures of the capsid-protein assembly units have been determined by X-ray crystallography; however, structural information regarding the assembled capsid and the contacts between the assembly units is incomplete. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a tubular HIV-1 capsid-protein assembly at 8 Å resolution and the three-dimensional structure of a native HIV-1 core by cryo-electron tomography. The structure of the tubular assembly shows, at the three-fold interface, a three-helix bundle with critical hydrophobic interactions. Mutagenesis studies confirm that hydrophobic residues in the centre of the three-helix bundle are crucial for capsid assembly and stability, and for viral infectivity. The cryo-electron-microscopy structures enable modelling by large-scale molecular dynamics simulation, resulting in all-atom models for the hexamer-of-hexamer and pentamer-of-hexamer elements as well as for the entire capsid. Incorporation of pentamers results in closer trimer contacts and induces acute surface curvature. The complete atomic HIV-1 capsid model provides a platform for further studies of capsid function and for targeted pharmacological intervention."
23719536,The mechanisms of Hedgehog signalling and its roles in development and disease.,10.1038/nrm3598,"The cloning of the founding member of the Hedgehog (HH) family of secreted proteins two decades ago inaugurated a field that has diversified to encompass embryonic development, stem cell biology and tissue homeostasis. Interest in HH signalling increased when the pathway was implicated in several cancers and congenital syndromes. The mechanism of HH signalling is complex and remains incompletely understood. Nevertheless, studies have revealed novel biological insights into this system, including the function of HH lipidation in the secretion and transport of this ligand and details of the signal transduction pathway, which involves Patched 1, Smoothened and GLI proteins (Cubitus interruptus in Drosophila melanogaster), as well as, in vertebrates, primary cilia."
23851014,A balanced ratio of proteins from gene G and frameshift-extended gene GT is required for phage lambda tail assembly.,10.1016/j.jmb.2013.07.002,"In bacteriophage λ, the overlapping open reading frames G and T are expressed by a programmed translational frameshift similar to that of the gag-pol genes of many retroviruses to produce the proteins gpG and gpGT. An analogous frameshift is widely conserved among other dsDNA tailed phages in their corresponding ""G"" and ""GT"" tail genes even in the absence of detectable sequence homology. The longer protein gpGT is known to be essential for tail assembly, but the requirement for the shorter gpG remained unclear because mutations in gene G affect both proteins. A plasmid system that can direct the efficient synthesis of tails was created and used to show that gpG and gpGT are both essential for correct tail assembly. Phage complementation assays under conditions where levels of plasmid-expressed gpG or gpGT could be altered independently revealed that the correct molar ratio of these two related proteins, normally determined by the efficiency of the frameshift, is also crucial for efficient assembly of functional tails. Finally, the physical connection between the G and T domains of gpGT, a consequence of the frameshift mechanism of protein expression, appears to be important for efficient tail assembly."
23897464,Trapped intermediates in crystals of the FMN-dependent oxidase PhzG provide insight into the final steps of phenazine biosynthesis.,10.1107/S0907444913008354,"Phenazines are redox-active secondary metabolites that many bacteria produce and secrete into the environment. They are broad-specificity antibiotics, but also act as virulence and survival factors in infectious diseases. Phenazines are derived from chorismic acid, but important details of their biosynthesis are still unclear. For example, three two-electron oxidations seem to be necessary in the final steps of the pathway, while only one oxidase, the FMN-dependent PhzG, is conserved in the phenazine-biosynthesis phz operon. Here, crystal structures of PhzG from Pseudomonas fluorescens 2-79 and from Burkholderia lata 383 in complex with excess FMN and with the phenazine-biosynthesis intermediates hexahydrophenazine-1,6-dicarboxylate and tetrahydrophenazine-1-carboxylate generated in situ are reported. Corroborated with biochemical data, these complexes demonstrate that PhzG is the terminal enzyme in phenazine biosynthesis and that its relaxed substrate specificity lets it participate in the generation of both phenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). This suggests that competition between flavin-dependent oxidations through PhzG and spontaneous oxidative decarboxylations determines the ratio of PDC, PCA and unsubstituted phenazine as the products of phenazine biosynthesis. Further, the results indicate that PhzG synthesizes phenazines in their reduced form. These reduced molecules, and not the fully aromatized derivatives, are the likely end products in vivo, explaining why only one oxidase is required in the phenazine-biosynthesis pathway."
23911548,Chaperone-protein interactions that mediate assembly of the bacteriophage lambda tail to the correct length.,10.1016/j.jmb.2013.06.040,"Bacteriophage λ makes two proteins with overlapping amino acid sequences that are essential for tail assembly. These two proteins, gpG and gpGT, are related by a programmed translational frameshift that is conserved among diverse phages and functions in λ to ensure that gpG and the frameshift product gpGT are made in a molar ratio of approximately 30:1. Although both proteins are required and must be present in the correct ratio for assembly of functional tails, neither is present in mature tails. During λ tail assembly, major tail protein gpV polymerizes to form a long tube whose length is controlled by the tape measure protein gpH. We show that the ""G"" domains of gpG and gpGT bind to all or parts of tail length tape measure protein gpH and that the ""T"" domain of gpGT binds to major tail shaft subunit gpV, and present a model for how gpG and gpGT chaperone gpH and direct the polymerization of gpV to form a tail of the correct length."
23927593,Intimate host attachment: enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli.,10.1111/cmi.12179,"Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli use a novel infection strategy to colonize the gut epithelium, involving translocation of their own receptor, Tir, via a type III secretion system and subsequent formation of attaching and effecting (A/E) lesions. Following integration into the host cell plasma membrane of cultured cells, and clustering by the outer membrane adhesin intimin, Tir triggers multiple actin polymerization pathways involving host and bacterial adaptor proteins that converge on the host Arp2/3 actin nucleator. Although initially thought to be involved in A/E lesion formation, recent data have shown that the known Tir-induced actin polymerization pathways are dispensable for this activity, but can play other major roles in colonization efficiency, in vivo fitness and systemic disease. In this review we summarize the roadmap leading from the discovery of Tir, through the different actin polymerization pathways it triggers, to our current understanding of their physiological functions."
23990784,Crystal structure of vaccinia viral A27 protein reveals a novel structure critical for its function and complex formation with A26 protein.,10.1371/journal.ppat.1003563,"Vaccinia virus envelope protein A27 has multiple functions and is conserved in the Orthopoxvirus genus of the poxvirus family. A27 protein binds to cell surface heparan sulfate, provides an anchor for A26 protein packaging into mature virions, and is essential for egress of mature virus (MV) from infected cells. Here, we crystallized and determined the structure of a truncated form of A27 containing amino acids 21-84, C71/72A (tA27) at 2.2 Å resolution. tA27 protein uses the N-terminal region interface (NTR) to form an unexpected trimeric assembly as the basic unit, which contains two parallel α-helices and one unusual antiparallel α-helix; in a serpentine way, two trimers stack with each other to form a hexamer using the C-terminal region interface (CTR). Recombinant tA27 protein forms oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro in gel filtration. Analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle light scattering revealed that tA27 dimerized in solution and that Leu47, Leu51, and Leu54 at the NTR and Ile68, Asn75, and Leu82 at the CTR are responsible for tA27 self-assembly in vitro. Finally, we constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing full length mutant A27 protein defective in either NTR, CTR, or both interactions; the results demonstrated that wild type A27 dimer/trimer formation was impaired in NTR and CTR mutant viruses, resulting in small plaques that are defective in MV egress. Furthermore, the ability of A27 protein to form disulfide-linked protein complexes with A26 protein was partially or completely interrupted by NTR and CTR mutations, resulting in mature virion progeny with increased plasma membrane fusion activity upon cell entry. Together, these results demonstrate that A27 protein trimer structure is critical for MV egress and membrane fusion modulation. Because A27 is a neutralizing target, structural information will aid the development of inhibitors to block A27 self-assembly or complex formation against vaccinia virus infection."
24038353,Expression-level optimization of a multi-enzyme pathway in the absence of a high-throughput assay.,10.1093/nar/gkt809,"Engineered metabolic pathways often suffer from flux imbalances that can overburden the cell and accumulate intermediate metabolites, resulting in reduced product titers. One way to alleviate such imbalances is to adjust the expression levels of the constituent enzymes using a combinatorial expression library. Typically, this approach requires high-throughput assays, which are unfortunately unavailable for the vast majority of desirable target compounds. To address this, we applied regression modeling to enable expression optimization using only a small number of measurements. We characterized a set of constitutive promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that spanned a wide range of expression and maintained their relative strengths irrespective of the coding sequence. We used a standardized assembly strategy to construct a combinatorial library and express for the first time in yeast the five-enzyme violacein biosynthetic pathway. We trained a regression model on a random sample comprising 3% of the total library, and then used that model to predict genotypes that would preferentially produce each of the products in this highly branched pathway. This generalizable method should prove useful in engineering new pathways for the sustainable production of small molecules."
24177970,Subcellular localization of luteolin glucuronides and related enzymes in rye mesophyll.,10.1007/BF00201627,"Vacuoles were isolated by osmotic rupture of mesophyll protoplasts from the primary leaves of 4-d- and 7-d-old plants of rye (Secale cereale L.). Their content of two flavones, luteolin 7-O-[β-D-glucuronosyl-(1→2)β-D-glucuronide] (R2) and luteolin 7-O-[β-D-glucuronosy 1 (1→2) β-D-glucuronide]-4'-O-β-D-glucuronide (R1), as well as that of three specific flavone-glucuronosyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis and of a specific β-glucuronidase was determined in comparison to the parent protoplasts. The two flavonoids were found to be entirely located in the vacuolar fraction, together with 70% of the activity of UDP-glucuronate: luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide-4'-O-glucuronosyl-transferase (LDT; EC 2.4.1.), the third enzyme of the sequence of three transferases in the anabolic pathway. The activities of the first and second anabolic enzymes, UDP-glucuronate: luteolin 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase (LGT; EC 2.4.1.) and UDP-glucuronate: luteolin 7-O-glucuronide-glucuronosyltransferase (LMT; EC 2.4.1.) could not be found in the vacuolar fraction in appreciable amounts. The specific β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.), catalyzing the deglucuronidation of luteolin triglucuronide to luteolin diglucuronide, was present with 90% of its activity in the digestion medium after isolation of mesophyll protoplasts, indicating an apoplastic localization of this enzyme. The data presented indicate a directed anabolic and subsequent catabolic pathway for the luteolin glucuronides in the mesophyll cells of rye primary leaves. This includes two cytosolic and a last vacuolar step of glucuronidation of luteolin, and the vacuolar storage of the luteolin triglucuronide. We propose the transport of the latter into the cell wall, after which the triglucuronide is deglucuronidated, this being the first step for further turnover."
24179159,Crystal structure of a soluble cleaved HIV-1 envelope trimer.,10.1126/science.1245625,"HIV-1 entry into CD4(+) target cells is mediated by cleaved envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers that have been challenging to characterize structurally. Here, we describe the crystal structure at 4.7 angstroms of a soluble, cleaved Env trimer that is stabilized and antigenically near-native (termed the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer) in complex with a potent broadly neutralizing antibody, PGT122. The structure shows a prefusion state of gp41, the interaction between the component gp120 and gp41 subunits, and how a close association between the gp120 V1/V2/V3 loops stabilizes the trimer apex around the threefold axis. The complete epitope of PGT122 on the trimer involves gp120 V1, V3, and several surrounding glycans. This trimer structure advances our understanding of how Env functions and is presented to the immune system, and provides a blueprint for structure-based vaccine design."
24217225,The ribonucleoprotein Csr network.,10.3390/ijms141122117,"Ribonucleoprotein complexes are essential regulatory components in bacteria. In this review, we focus on the carbon storage regulator (Csr) network, which is well conserved in the bacterial world. This regulatory network is composed of the CsrA master regulator, its targets and regulators. CsrA binds to mRNA targets and regulates translation either negatively or positively. Binding to small non-coding RNAs controls activity of this protein. Expression of these regulators is tightly regulated at the level of transcription and stability by various global regulators (RNAses, two-component systems, alarmone). We discuss the implications of these complex regulations in bacterial adaptation."

The enzyme was enriched approx. 70-fold. It has a pH-optimum of 7.0, an isoelectric point at pH 8.8, molecular weight of 56 kD and shows a high degree of substrate specificity. The enzyme obviously catalyzes the terminal step in the formation of benzophenanthridine alkaloids containing methylene dioxy substitutions in rings A and D."
24241851,Tissue-distribution of secondary phenolic biosynthesis in developing primary leaves of Avena sativa L.,10.1007/BF00391415,"Primary leaves of oats (Avena sativa L.) have been used to study the integration of secondary phenolic metabolism into organ differentiation and development. In particular, the tissue-specific distribution of products and enzymes involved in their biosynthesis has been investigated. C-Glucosylflavones along with minor amounts of hydroxycinnamic-acid esters constitute the soluble phenolic compounds in these leaves. In addition, considerable amounts of insoluble products such as lignin and wall-bound ferulic-acid esters are formed. The tissue-specific activities of seven enzymes were determined in different stages of leaf growth. The rate-limiting enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis in this system, chalcone synthase, together with chalcone isomerase (EC 5.5.1.6) and the terminal enzymes of the vitexin and isovitexin branches of the pathway (a flavonoid O-methyltransferase and an isovitexin arabinosyltransferase) are located in the leaf mesophyll. Since the flavonoids accumulate predominantly (up to 70%) in both epidermal layers, an intercellular transport of products is postulated. In contrast to the flavonoid enzymes, L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.5), 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.12), and S-adenosyl-L-methionine: caffeate 3-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-), all involved in general phenylpropanoid metabolism, showed highest activities in the basal leaf region as well as in the epidermis and the vascular bundles. We suggest that these latter enzymes participate mainly in the biosynthesis of non-flavonoid phenolic products, such as lignin in the xylem tissue and wall-bound hydroxycinnamic acid-esters in epidermal, phloem, and sclerenchyma tissues."
24372821,Identification of a broad family of lipid A late acyltransferases with non-canonical substrate specificity.,10.1111/mmi.12501,"Most Gram-negative organisms produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a complex macromolecule anchored to the bacterial membrane by the lipid A moiety. Lipid A is synthesized via the Raetz pathway, a conserved nine-step enzymatic process first characterized in Escherichia coli. The Epsilonproteobacterium Helicobacter pylori uses the Raetz pathway to synthesize lipid A; however, only eight of nine enzymes in the pathway have been identified in this organism. Here, we identify the missing acyltransferase, Jhp0255, which transfers a secondary acyl chain to the 3'-linked primary acyl chain of lipid A, an activity similar to that of E. coli LpxM. This enzyme, reannotated as LpxJ due to limited sequence similarity with LpxM, catalyses addition of a C12:0 or C14:0 acyl chain to the 3'-linked primary acyl chain of lipid A, complementing an E. coli LpxM mutant. Enzymatic assays demonstrate that LpxJ and homologues in Campylobacter jejuni and Wolinella succinogenes can act before the 2' secondary acyltransferase, LpxL, as well as the 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) transferase, KdtA. Ultimately, LpxJ is one member of a large class of acyltransferases found in a diverse range of organisms that lack an E. coli LpxM homologue, suggesting that LpxJ participates in lipid A biosynthesis in place of an LpxM homologue."
24375100,Identification in Haloferax volcanii of phosphomevalonate decarboxylase and isopentenyl phosphate kinase as catalysts of the terminal enzyme reactions in an archaeal alternate mevalonate pathway.,10.1128/JB.01230-13,"Mevalonate (MVA) metabolism provides the isoprenoids used in archaeal lipid biosynthesis. In synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the classical MVA pathway involves decarboxylation of mevalonate diphosphate, while an alternate pathway has been proposed to involve decarboxylation of mevalonate monophosphate. To identify the enzymes responsible for metabolism of mevalonate 5-phosphate to isopentenyl diphosphate in Haloferax volcanii, two open reading frames (HVO_2762 and HVO_1412) were selected for expression and characterization. Characterization of these proteins indicated that one enzyme is an isopentenyl phosphate kinase that forms isopentenyl diphosphate (in a reaction analogous to that of Methanococcus jannaschii MJ0044). The second enzyme exhibits a decarboxylase activity that has never been directly attributed to this protein or any homologous protein. It catalyzes the synthesis of isopentenyl phosphate from mevalonate monophosphate, a reaction that has been proposed but never demonstrated by direct experimental proof, which is provided in this account. This enzyme, phosphomevalonate decarboxylase (PMD), exhibits strong inhibition by 6-fluoromevalonate monophosphate but negligible inhibition by 6-fluoromevalonate diphosphate (a potent inhibitor of the classical mevalonate pathway), reinforcing its selectivity for monophosphorylated ligands. Inhibition by the fluorinated analog also suggests that the PMD utilizes a reaction mechanism similar to that demonstrated for the classical MVA pathway decarboxylase. These observations represent the first experimental demonstration in H. volcanii of both the phosphomevalonate decarboxylase and isopentenyl phosphate kinase reactions that are required for an alternate mevalonate pathway in an archaeon. These results also represent, to our knowledge, the first identification and characterization of any phosphomevalonate decarboxylase."
24418573,The SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein--forms and functions.,10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.12.009,"The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV N protein) packages the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) and plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly. It is a protein with multifarious activities. In this article we will review our current understanding of the N protein structure and its interaction with nucleic acid. Highlights of the progresses include uncovering the modular organization, determining the structures of the structural domains, realizing the roles of protein disorder in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, and visualizing the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structure inside the virions. It was also demonstrated that N-protein binds to nucleic acid at multiple sites with a coupled-allostery manner. We propose a SARS-CoV RNP model that conforms to existing data and bears resemblance to the existing RNP structures of RNA viruses. The model highlights the critical role of modular organization and intrinsic disorder of the N protein in the formation and functions of the dynamic RNP capsid in RNA viruses. This paper forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on ""From SARS to MERS: 10 years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses."""
24512081,The intestinal absorption of folates.,10.1146/annurev-physiol-020911-153251,"The properties of intestinal folate absorption were documented decades ago. However, it was only recently that the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) was identified and its critical role in folate transport across the apical brush-border membrane of the proximal small intestine established by the loss-of-function mutations identified in the PCFT gene in subjects with hereditary folate malabsorption and, more recently, by the Pcft-null mouse. This article reviews the current understanding of the properties of PCFT-mediated transport and how they differ from those of the reduced folate carrier. Other processes that contribute to the transport of folates across the enterocyte, along with the contribution of the enterohepatic circulation, are considered. Important unresolved issues are addressed, including the mechanism of intestinal folate absorption in the absence of PCFT and regulation of PCFT gene expression. The impact of a variety of ions, organic molecules, and drugs on PCFT-mediated folate transport is described."
24563201,AUTOPHAGY-RELATED11 plays a critical role in general autophagy- and senescence-induced mitophagy in Arabidopsis.,10.1105/tpc.113.120014,"Autophagy-mediated turnover removes damaged organelles and unwanted cytoplasmic constituents and thus plays critical roles in cellular housekeeping and nutrient recycling. This ""self eating"" is tightly regulated by the AUTOPHAGY-RELATED1/13 (ATG1/13) kinase complex, which connects metabolic and environmental cues to the vacuolar delivery of autophagic vesicles. Here, we describe the Arabidopsis thaliana accessory proteins ATG11 and ATG101, which help link the ATG1/13 complex to autophagic membranes. ATG11 promotes vesicle delivery to the vacuole but is not essential for synthesizing the ATG12-ATG5 and ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine adducts that are central to autophagic vesicle assembly. ATG11, ATG101, ATG1, and ATG13 colocalize with each other and with ATG8, with ATG1 tethered to ATG8 via a canonical ATG8-interacting motif. Also, the presence of ATG11 encourages starvation-induced phosphorylation of ATG1 and turnover of ATG1 and ATG13. Like other atg mutants, ATG11-deficient plants senesce prematurely and are hypersensitive to nitrogen and fixed-carbon limitations. Additionally, we discovered that the senescence-induced breakdown of mitochondria-resident proteins and mitochondrial vesicles occurs via an autophagic process requiring ATG11 and other ATG components. Together, our data indicate that ATG11 (and possibly ATG101) provides important scaffolds connecting the ATG1/13 complex to both general autophagy and selective mitophagy."
24612080,Co-ordination between BrlA regulation and secretion of the oxidoreductase FmqD directs selective accumulation of fumiquinazoline C to conidial tissues in Aspergillus fumigatus.,10.1111/cmi.12284,"Aerial spores, crucial for propagation and dispersal of the Kingdom Fungi, are commonly the initial inoculum of pathogenic fungi. Natural products (secondary metabolites) have been correlated with fungal spore development and enhanced virulence in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus but mechanisms for metabolite deposition in the spore are unknown. Metabolomic profiling of A. fumigatus deletion mutants of fumiquinazoline (Fq) cluster genes reveal that the first two products of the Fq cluster, FqF and FqA, are produced to comparable levels in all fungal tissues but the final enzymatically derived product, FqC, predominantly accumulates in the fungal spore. Loss of the sporulation-specific transcription factor, BrlA, yields a strain unable to produce FqA or FqC. Fluorescence microscopy showed FmqD, the oxidoreductase required to generate FqC, was secreted via the Golgi apparatus to the cell wall in an actin-dependent manner. In contrast, all other members of the Fq pathway including the putative transporter, FmqE - which had no effect on Fq biosynthesis - were internal to the hyphae. The co-ordination of BrlA-mediated tissue specificity with FmqD secretion to the cell wall presents a previously undescribed mechanism to direct localization of specific secondary metabolites to spores of the differentiating fungus."
24677498,Cytochrome P450 as dimerization catalyst in diketopiperazine alkaloid biosynthesis.,10.1002/cbic.201300751,"As dimeric natural products frequently exhibit useful biological activities, identifying and understanding their mechanisms of dimerization is of great interest. One such compound is (−)-ditryptophenaline, isolated from Aspergillus flavus, which inhibits substance P receptor for potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. Through targeted gene knockout in A. flavus and heterologous yeast gene expression, we determined for the first time the gene cluster and pathway for the biosynthesis of a dimeric diketopiperazine alkaloid. We also determined that a single cytochrome P450, DtpC, is responsible not only for pyrroloindole ring formation but also for concurrent dimerization of N-methylphenylalanyltryptophanyl diketopiperazine monomers into a homodimeric product. Furthermore, DtpC exhibits relaxed substrate specificity, allowing the formation of two new dimeric compounds from a non-native monomeric precursor, brevianamide F. A radical-mediated mechanism of dimerization is proposed."
24724055,Mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulation in bacterial biofilms.,10.3389/fcimb.2014.00038,"Biofilms are characterized by a dense multicellular community of microorganisms that can be formed by the attachment of bacteria to an inert surface and to each other. The development of biofilm involves the initial attachment of planktonic bacteria to a surface, followed by replication, cell-to-cell adhesion to form microcolonies, maturation, and detachment. Mature biofilms are embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix composed primarily of bacterial-derived exopolysaccharides, specialized proteins, adhesins, and occasionally DNA. Because the synthesis and assembly of biofilm matrix components is an exceptionally complex process, the transition between its different phases requires the coordinate expression and simultaneous regulation of many genes by complex genetic networks involving all levels of gene regulation. The finely controlled intracellular level of the chemical second messenger molecule, cyclic-di-GMP is central to the post-transcriptional mechanisms governing the switch between the motile planktonic lifestyle and the sessile biofilm forming state in many bacteria. Several other post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are known to dictate biofilm development and assembly and these include RNA-binding proteins, small non-coding RNAs, toxin-antitoxin systems, riboswitches, and RNases. Post-transcriptional regulation is therefore a powerful molecular mechanism employed by bacteria to rapidly adjust to the changing environment and to fine tune gene expression to the developmental needs of the cell. In this review, we discuss post-transcriptional mechanisms that influence the biofilm developmental cycle in a variety of pathogenic bacteria."
24786756,"Mammalian O-mannosylation pathway: glycan structures, enzymes, and protein substrates.",10.1021/bi500153y,"The mammalian O-mannosylation pathway for protein post-translational modification is intricately involved in modulating cell-matrix interactions in the musculature and nervous system. Defects in enzymes of this biosynthetic pathway are causative for multiple forms of congenital muscular dystophy. The application of advanced genetic and biochemical technologies has resulted in remarkable progress in this field over the past few years, culminating with the publication of three landmark papers in 2013 alone. In this review, we will highlight recent progress focusing on the dramatic expansion of the set of genes known to be involved in O-mannosylation and disease processes, the concurrent acceleration of the rate of O-mannosylation pathway protein functional assignments, the tremendous increase in the number of proteins now known to be modified by O-mannosylation, and the recent progress in protein O-mannose glycan quantification and site assignment. Also, we attempt to highlight key outstanding questions raised by this abundance of new information."
24884615,Complete genome sequence and comparative genomic analyses of the vancomycin-producing Amycolatopsis orientalis.,10.1186/1471-2164-15-363,"Amycolatopsis orientalis is the type species of the genus and its industrial strain HCCB10007, derived from ATCC 43491, has been used for large-scale production of the vital antibiotic vancomycin. However, to date, neither the complete genomic sequence of this species nor a systemic characterization of the vancomycin biosynthesis cluster (vcm) has been reported. With only the whole genome sequence of Amycolatopsis mediterranei available, additional complete genomes of other species may facilitate intra-generic comparative analysis of the genus."
24915502,The cell envelope glycoconjugates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,10.3109/10409238.2014.925420,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the second most common cause of death due to a single infectious agent. The cell envelope of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the disease in humans, is a source of unique glycoconjugates and the most distinctive feature of the biology of this organism. It is the basis of much of Mtb pathogenesis and one of the major causes of its intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. At the same time, the unique structures of Mtb cell envelope glycoconjugates, their antigenicity and essentiality for mycobacterial growth provide opportunities for drug, vaccine, diagnostic and biomarker development, as clearly illustrated by recent advances in all of these translational aspects. This review focuses on our current understanding of the structure and biogenesis of Mtb glycoconjugates with particular emphasis on one of the most intriguing and least understood aspect of the physiology of mycobacteria: the translocation of these complex macromolecules across the different layers of the cell envelope. It further reviews the rather impressive progress made in the last 10 years in the discovery and development of novel inhibitors targeting their biogenesis."
24970213,Structure and function of the bi-directional bacterial flagellar motor.,10.3390/biom4010217,"The bacterial flagellum is a locomotive organelle that propels the bacterial cell body in liquid environments. The flagellum is a supramolecular complex composed of about 30 different proteins and consists of at least three parts: a rotary motor, a universal joint, and a helical filament. The flagellar motor of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica is powered by an inward-directed electrochemical potential difference of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. The flagellar motor consists of a rotor made of FliF, FliG, FliM and FliN and a dozen stators consisting of MotA and MotB. FliG, FliM and FliN also act as a molecular switch, enabling the motor to spin in both counterclockwise and clockwise directions. Each stator is anchored to the peptidoglycan layer through the C-terminal periplasmic domain of MotB and acts as a proton channel to couple the proton flow through the channel with torque generation. Highly conserved charged residues at the rotor-stator interface are required not only for torque generation but also for stator assembly around the rotor. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding of the structure and function of the proton-driven bacterial flagellar motor."
25028968,"Small RNAs in the control of RpoS, CsgD, and biofilm architecture of Escherichia coli.",10.4161/rna.28867,"Amyloid curli fibers and cellulose are extracellular matrix components produced in the stationary phase top layer of E. coli macrocolonies, which confer physical protection, strong cohesion, elasticity, and wrinkled morphology to these biofilms. Curli and cellulose synthesis is controlled by a three-level transcription factor (TF) cascade with the RpoS sigma subunit of RNA polymerase at the top, the MerR-like TF MlrA, and the biofilm regulator CsgD, with two c-di-GMP control modules acting as key switching devices. Additional signal input and fine-tuning is provided by an entire series of small RNAs-ArcZ, DsrA, RprA, McaS, OmrA/OmrB, GcvB, and RydC--that differentially control all three TF modules by direct mRNA interaction. This review not only summarizes the mechanisms of action of these sRNAs, but also addresses the question of how these sRNAs and the regulators they target contribute to building the intriguing three-dimensional microarchitecture and macromorphology of these biofilms."
25036886,Roles of HIV-1 capsid in viral replication and immune evasion.,10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.010,"The primary roles of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid (CA) protein are to encapsidate and protect the viral RNA genome. It is becoming increasing apparent that HIV-1 CA is a multifunctional protein that acts early during infection to coordinate uncoating, reverse transcription, nuclear import of the pre-integration complex and integration of double stranded viral DNA into the host genome. Additionally, numerous recent studies indicate that CA is playing a crucial function in HIV-1 immune evasion. Here we summarize the current knowledge on HIV-1 CA and its interactions with the host cell to promote infection. The fact that CA engages in a number of different protein-protein interactions with the host makes it an interesting target for the development of new potent antiviral agents."
25203508,Insights into mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis from the structure of heterotetrameric 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase/3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase.,10.1038/ncomms5805,"Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) is essential for respiratory growth in yeast and mammalian embryonic survival. The human 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (KAR) of mtFAS is a heterotetrameric α2β2-assembly composed of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-8 (HSD17B8, α-subunit) and carbonyl reductase type-4 (CBR4, β-subunit). Here we provide a structural explanation for the stability of the heterotetramer from the crystal structure with NAD(+) and NADP(+) bound to the HSD17B8 and CBR4 subunits, respectively, and show that the catalytic activity of the NADPH- and ACP-dependent CBR4 subunit is crucial for a functional HsKAR. Therefore, mtFAS is NADPH- and ACP dependent, employing the 3R-hydroxyacyl-ACP intermediate. HSD17B8 assists in the formation of the competent HsKAR assembly. The intrinsic NAD(+)- and CoA-dependent activity of the HSD17B8 subunit on the 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates may indicate a role for this subunit in routing 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA esters, potentially arising from the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids, into the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway."
25264025,Manipulation of the host cell death pathway by Shigella.,10.1111/cmi.12367,"Host cells deploy multiple defences against microbial infection. One prominent host defence mechanism, the death of infected cells, plays a pivotal role in clearing damaged cells, eliminating pathogens, removing replicative niches, exposing intracellular bacterial pathogens to extracellular immune surveillance and presenting bacteria-derived antigens to the adaptive immune system. Although cell death can occur under either physiological or pathophysiological conditions, it acts as an innate defence mechanism against bacterial pathogens by limiting their persistent colonization. However, many bacterial pathogens, including Shigella, have evolved mechanisms that manipulate host cell death for their own benefit."
25327248,Hepatitis A virus and the origins of picornaviruses.,10.1038/nature13806,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) remains enigmatic, despite 1.4 million cases worldwide annually. It differs radically from other picornaviruses, existing in an enveloped form and being unusually stable, both genetically and physically, but has proved difficult to study. Here we report high-resolution X-ray structures for the mature virus and the empty particle. The structures of the two particles are indistinguishable, apart from some disorder on the inside of the empty particle. The full virus contains the small viral protein VP4, whereas the empty particle harbours only the uncleaved precursor, VP0. The smooth particle surface is devoid of depressions that might correspond to receptor-binding sites. Peptide scanning data extend the previously reported VP3 antigenic site, while structure-based predictions suggest further epitopes. HAV contains no pocket factor and can withstand remarkably high temperature and low pH, and empty particles are even more robust than full particles. The virus probably uncoats via a novel mechanism, being assembled differently to other picornaviruses. It utilizes a VP2 'domain swap' characteristic of insect picorna-like viruses, and structure-based phylogenetic analysis places HAV between typical picornaviruses and the insect viruses. The enigmatic properties of HAV may reflect its position as a link between 'modern' picornaviruses and the more 'primitive' precursor insect viruses; for instance, HAV retains the ability to move from cell-to-cell by transcytosis."
2548847,Structural factors that control conformational transitions and serotype specificity in type 3 poliovirus.,10.1002/j.1460-2075.1989.tb03541.x,"The three-dimensional structure of the Sabin strain of type 3 poliovirus has been determined at 2.4 A resolution. Significant structural differences with the Mahoney strain of type 1 poliovirus are confined to loops and terminal extensions of the capsid proteins, occur in all of the major antigenic sites of the virion and typically involve insertions, deletions or the replacement of prolines. Several newly identified components of the structure participate in assembly-dependent interactions which are relevant to the biologically important processes of viral assembly and uncoating. These include two sites of lipid substitution, two putative nucleotides and a beta sheet formed by the N-termini of capsid proteins VP4 and VP1. The structure provides an explanation for the temperature sensitive phenotype of the P3/Sabin strain. Amino acids that regulate temperature sensitivity in type 3 poliovirus are located in the interfaces between promoters, in the binding site for a lipid substituent and in an assembly-dependent extended beta sheet that stabilizes the association of pentamers. Several lines of evidence indicate that these structural components also control conformational transitions at various stages of the viral life cycle."
25588886,Bringing down the host: enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli effector-mediated subversion of host innate immune pathways.,10.1111/cmi.12412,"Enteric bacterial pathogens commonly use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to successfully infect intestinal epithelial cells and survive and proliferate in the host. Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC; EHEC) colonize the human intestinal mucosa, form characteristic histological lesions on the infected epithelium and require the T3SS for full virulence. T3SS effectors injected into host cells subvert cellular pathways to execute a variety of functions within infected host cells. The EPEC and EHEC effectors that subvert innate immune pathways--specifically those involved in phagocytosis, host cell survival, apoptotic cell death and inflammatory signalling--are all required to cause disease. These processes are reviewed within, with a focus on recent work that has provided insights into the functions and host cell targets of these effectors."
25611507,"The roles of PINK1, parkin, and mitochondrial fidelity in Parkinson's disease.",10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.007,"Understanding the function of genes mutated in hereditary forms of Parkinson's disease yields insight into disease etiology and reveals new pathways in cell biology. Although mutations or variants in many genes increase the susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, only a handful of monogenic causes of parkinsonism have been identified. Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that the products of two genes that are mutated in autosomal recessive parkinsonism, PINK1 and Parkin, normally work together in the same pathway to govern mitochondrial quality control, bolstering previous evidence that mitochondrial damage is involved in Parkinson's disease. PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of damaged mitochondria, activates Parkin's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and recruits Parkin to the dysfunctional mitochondrion. Then, Parkin ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to trigger selective autophagy. This review covers the normal functions that PINK1 and Parkin play within cells, their molecular mechanisms of action, and the pathophysiological consequences of their loss."
25666534,The expanding roles of c-di-GMP in the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides and secondary metabolites.,10.1039/c4np00086b,"The cyclic dinucleotide c-di-GMP has emerged in the last decade as a prevalent intracellular messenger that orchestrates the transition between the motile and sessile lifestyles of many bacterial species. The motile-to-sessile transition is often associated with the formation of extracellular matrix-encased biofilm, an organized community of bacterial cells that often contributes to antibiotic resistance and host-pathogen interaction. It is increasingly clear that c-di-GMP controls motility, biofilm formation and bacterial pathogenicity partially through regulating the production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and small-molecule secondary metabolites. This review summarizes our current understanding of the regulation of EPS biosynthesis by c-di-GMP in a diversity of bacterial species and highlights the emerging role of c-di-GMP in the biosynthesis of small-molecule secondary metabolites."
25720833,Identification and characterization of an ABA-activated MAP kinase cascade in Arabidopsis thaliana.,10.1111/tpj.12808,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a major phytohormone involved in important stress-related and developmental plant processes. Recent phosphoproteomic analyses revealed a large set of ABA-triggered phosphoproteins as putative mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) targets, although the evidence for MAPKs involved in ABA signalling is still scarce. Here, we identified and reconstituted in vivo a complete ABA-activated MAPK cascade, composed of the MAP3Ks MAP3K17/18, the MAP2K MKK3 and the four C group MAPKs MPK1/2/7/14. In planta, we show that ABA activation of MPK7 is blocked in mkk3-1 and map3k17mapk3k18 plants. Coherently, both mutants exhibit hypersensitivity to ABA and altered expression of a set of ABA-dependent genes. A genetic analysis further reveals that this MAPK cascade is activated by the PYR/PYL/RCAR-SnRK2-PP2C ABA core signalling module through protein synthesis of the MAP3Ks, unveiling an atypical mechanism for MAPK activation in eukaryotes. Our work provides evidence for a role of an ABA-induced MAPK pathway in plant stress signalling."
25727146,Simple sugars to complex disease--mucin-type O-glycans in cancer.,10.1016/bs.acr.2014.11.002,"Mucin-type O-glycans are a class of glycans initiated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) α-linked primarily to Ser/Thr residues within glycoproteins and often extended or branched by sugars or saccharides. Most secretory and membrane-bound proteins receive this modification, which is important in regulating many biological processes. Alterations in mucin-type O-glycans have been described across tumor types and include expression of relatively small-sized, truncated O-glycans and altered terminal structures, both of which are associated with patient prognosis. New discoveries in the identity and expression of tumor-associated O-glycans are providing new avenues for tumor detection and treatment. This chapter describes mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis, altered mucin-type O-glycans in primary tumors, including mechanisms for structural changes and contributions to the tumor phenotype, and clinical approaches to detect and target altered O-glycans for cancer treatment and management."
25847245,Two duplicated genes DDI2 and DDI3 in budding yeast encode a cyanamide hydratase and are induced by cyanamide.,10.1074/jbc.M115.645408,"Two DNA damage-inducible genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DDI2 and DDI3, are identical and encode putative HD domain-containing proteins, whose functions are currently unknown. Because Ddi2/3 also shows limited homology to a fungal cyanamide hydratase that converts cyanamide to urea, we tested the enzymatic activity of recombinant Ddi2. To this end, we developed a novel enzymatic assay and determined that the Km value of the recombinant Ddi2/3 for cyanamide is 17.3 ± 0.05 mm, and its activity requires conserved residues in the HD domain. Unlike most other DNA damage-inducible genes, DDI2/3 is only induced by a specific set of alkylating agents and surprisingly is strongly induced by cyanamide. To characterize the biological function of DDI2/3, we sequentially deleted both DDI genes and found that the double mutant was unable to metabolize cyanamide and became much more sensitive to growth inhibition by cyanamide, suggesting that the DDI2/3 genes protect host cells from cyanamide toxicity. Despite the physiological relevance of the cyanamide induction, DDI2/3 is not involved in its own transcriptional regulation. The significance of cyanamide hydratase activity and its induced expression is discussed."
25895940,Living in the matrix: assembly and control of Vibrio cholerae biofilms.,10.1038/nrmicro3433,"Nearly all bacteria form biofilms as a strategy for survival and persistence. Biofilms are associated with biotic and abiotic surfaces and are composed of aggregates of cells that are encased by a self-produced or acquired extracellular matrix. Vibrio cholerae has been studied as a model organism for understanding biofilm formation in environmental pathogens, as it spends much of its life cycle outside of the human host in the aquatic environment. Given the important role of biofilm formation in the V. cholerae life cycle, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process and the signals that trigger biofilm assembly or dispersal have been areas of intense investigation over the past 20 years. In this Review, we discuss V. cholerae surface attachment, various matrix components and the regulatory networks controlling biofilm formation."
25995186,"The three 'P's of mitophagy: PARKIN, PINK1, and post-translational modifications.",10.1101/gad.262758.115,"Two Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated proteins, the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 and the E3-ubiquitin (Ub) ligase PARKIN, are central to mitochondrial quality control. In this pathway, PINK1 accumulates on defective mitochondria, eliciting the translocation of PARKIN from the cytosol to mediate the clearance of damaged mitochondria via autophagy (mitophagy). Throughout the different stages of mitophagy, post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical for the regulation of PINK1 and PARKIN activity and function. Indeed, activation and recruitment of PARKIN onto damaged mitochondria involves PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of both PARKIN and Ub. Through a stepwise cascade, PARKIN is converted from an autoinhibited enzyme into an active phospho-Ub-dependent E3 ligase. Upon activation, PARKIN ubiquitinates itself in concert with many different mitochondrial substrates. The Ub conjugates attached to these substrates can in turn be phosphorylated by PINK1, which triggers further cycles of PARKIN recruitment and activation. This feed-forward amplification loop regulates both PARKIN activity and mitophagy. However, the precise steps and sequence of PTMs in this cascade are only now being uncovered. For instance, the Ub conjugates assembled by PARKIN consist predominantly of noncanonical K6-linked Ub chains. Moreover, these modifications are reversible and can be disassembled by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), including Ub-specific protease 8 (USP8), USP15, and USP30. However, PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ub can impede the activity of these DUBs, adding a new layer of complexity to the regulation of PARKIN-mediated mitophagy by PTMs. It is therefore evident that further insight into how PTMs regulate the PINK1-PARKIN pathway will be critical for our understanding of mitochondrial quality control."
25999423,How mitochondrial dynamism orchestrates mitophagy.,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.306374,"Mitochondria are highly dynamic, except in adult cardiomyocytes. Yet, the fission and fusion-promoting proteins that mediate mitochondrial dynamism are highly expressed in, and essential to the normal functioning of, hearts. Here, we review accumulating evidence supporting important roles for mitochondrial fission and fusion in cardiac mitochondrial quality control, focusing on the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1-Parkin mitophagy pathway. Based in part on recent findings from in vivo mouse models in which mitofusin-mediated mitochondrial fusion or dynamin-related protein 1-mediated mitochondrial fission was conditionally interrupted in cardiac myocytes, we propose several new concepts that may provide insight into the cardiac mitochondrial dynamism-mitophagy interactome."
25999954,Shigella manipulates host immune responses by delivering effector proteins with specific roles.,10.3389/fimmu.2015.00219,"The intestinal epithelium deploys multiple defense systems against microbial infection to sense bacterial components and danger alarms, as well as to induce intracellular signal transduction cascades that trigger both the innate and the adaptive immune systems, which are pivotal for bacterial elimination. However, many enteric bacterial pathogens, including Shigella, deliver a subset of virulence proteins (effectors) via the type III secretion system (T3SS) that enable bacterial evasion from host immune systems; consequently, these pathogens are able to efficiently colonize the intestinal epithelium. In this review, we present and select recently discovered examples of interactions between Shigella and host immune responses, with particular emphasis on strategies that bacteria use to manipulate inflammatory outputs of host-cell responses such as cell death, membrane trafficking, and innate and adaptive immune responses."
26104198,Genetics of Mycobacterial Arabinogalactan and Lipoarabinomannan Assembly.,10.1128/microbiolspec.MGM2-0013-2013,"The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is unique in that it differs significantly from those of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The thick, carbohydrate- and lipid-rich cell wall with distinct lipoglycans enables mycobacteria to survive under hostile conditions such as shortage of nutrients and antimicrobial exposure. The key features of this highly complex cell wall are the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP)-based and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol-based macromolecular structures, with the latter possessing potent immunomodulatory properties. These structures are crucial for the growth, viability, and virulence of M. tuberculosis and therefore are often the targets of effective chemotherapeutic agents against tuberculosis. Over the past decade, sophisticated genomic and molecular tools have advanced our understanding of the primary structure and biosynthesis of these macromolecules. The availability of the full genome sequences of various mycobacterial species, including M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium marinum, and Mycobacterium bovis BCG, have greatly facilitated the identification of large numbers of drug targets and antigens specific to tuberculosis. Techniques to manipulate mycobacteria have also improved extensively; the conditional expression-specialized transduction essentiality test (CESTET) is currently used to determine the essentiality of individual genes. Finally, various biosynthetic assays using either purified proteins or synthetic cell wall acceptors have been developed to study enzyme function. This article focuses on the recent advances in determining the structural details and biosynthesis of arabinogalactan, lipoarabinomannan, and related glycoconjugates."
26104206,The Inflammatory Response during Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Infection.,10.1128/microbiolspec.EHEC-0012-2013,"The inflammatory response is an integral part of host defense against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection and also contributes to disease pathology. In this article we explore the factors leading to inflammation during EHEC infection and the mechanisms EHEC and other attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens have evolved to suppress inflammatory signaling. EHEC stimulates an inflammatory response in the intestine through host recognition of bacterial components such as flagellin and lipopolysaccharide. In addition, the activity of Shiga toxin and some type III secretion system effectors leads to increased tissue inflammation. Various infection models of EHEC and other A/E pathogens have revealed many of the immune factors that mediate this response. In particular, the outcome of infection is greatly influenced by the ability of an infected epithelial cell to mount an effective host inflammatory response. The inflammatory response of infected enterocytes is counterbalanced by the activity of type III secretion system effectors such as NleE and NleC that modify and inhibit components of the signaling pathways that lead to proinflammatory cytokine production. Overall, A/E pathogens have taught us that innate mucosal immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract during infection with A/E pathogens are highly complex and ultimate clearance of the pathogen depends on multiple factors, including inflammatory mediators, bacterial burden, and the function and integrity of resident intestinal epithelial cells."
26207987,The Biosynthesis of UDP-D-QuiNAc in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.,10.1371/journal.pone.0133790,"N-acetylquinovosamine (2-acetamido-2,6-di-deoxy-D-glucose, QuiNAc) is a relatively rare amino sugar residue found in glycans of few pathogenic gram-negative bacteria where it can play a role in infection. However, little is known about QuiNAc-related polysaccharides in gram-positive bacteria. In a routine screen for bacillus glycan grown at defined medium, it was surprising to identify a QuiNAc residue in polysaccharides isolated from this gram-positive bacterium. To gain insight into the biosynthesis of these glycans, we report the identification of an operon in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 that contains two genes encoding activities not previously described in gram-positive bacteria. One gene encodes a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine C4,6-dehydratase, (abbreviated Pdeg) that converts UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-4-keto-4,6-D-deoxy-GlcNAc (UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-α-D-xylo-4-hexulose); and the second encodes a UDP-4-reductase (abbr. Preq) that converts UDP-4-keto-4,6-D-deoxy-GlcNAc to UDP-N-acetyl-quinovosamine in the presence of NADPH. Biochemical studies established that the sequential Pdeg and Preq reaction product is UDP-D-QuiNAc as determined by mass spectrometry and one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments. Also, unambiguous evidence for the conversions of the dehydratase product, UDP-α-D-4-keto-4,6-deoxy-GlcNAc, to UDP-α-D-QuiNAc was obtained using real-time 1H-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The two genes overlap by 4 nucleotides and similar operon organization and identical gene sequences were also identified in a few other Bacillus species suggesting they may have similar roles in the lifecycle of this class of bacteria important to human health. Our results provide new information about the ability of Bacilli to form UDP-QuiNAc and will provide insight to evaluate their role in the biology of Bacillus."
26263855,Stability of HIB-Cul3 E3 ligase adaptor HIB Is Regulated by Self-degradation and Availability of Its Substrates.,10.1038/srep12709,"The HIB-Cul3 complex E3 ligase regulates physiological homeostasis through regulating its substrate stability and its activity can be modulated by changing HIB abundance. However, regulation of HIB remains elusive. Here we provide evidence that HIB is degraded through the proteasome by Cul3-mediated polyubiquitination in K48 manner in Drosophila. Strikingly, HIB is targeted for degradation by itself. We further identify that three degrons ((52)LKSS(56)T, (76)LDEE(80)S and (117)MESQ(121)R) and K185 and K198 of HIB are essential for its auto-degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that HIB-Cul3 substrates, Ci and Puc, can effectively protect HIB from HIB-Cul3-mediated degradation. Taken together, our study indicates that there is an exquisite equilibrium between the adaptor and targets to achieve the tight control of the HIB, which is essential for maintaining suitable Hh and JNK signaling. And the mechanism of adaptor self-degradation and reciprocal control of the abundance between adaptor and its substrates is also applied to BTB-Cul3 E3 ligase adaptor dKeap1, dDiablo and dKLHL18."
26359402,Six enzymes from mayapple that complete the biosynthetic pathway to the etoposide aglycone.,10.1126/science.aac7202,"Podophyllotoxin is the natural product precursor of the chemotherapeutic etoposide, yet only part of its biosynthetic pathway is known. We used transcriptome mining in Podophyllum hexandrum (mayapple) to identify biosynthetic genes in the podophyllotoxin pathway. We selected 29 candidate genes to combinatorially express in Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco) and identified six pathway enzymes, including an oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that closes the core cyclohexane ring of the aryltetralin scaffold. By coexpressing 10 genes in tobacco-these 6 plus 4 previously discovered-we reconstitute the pathway to (-)-4'-desmethylepipodophyllotoxin (the etoposide aglycone), a naturally occurring lignan that is the immediate precursor of etoposide and, unlike podophyllotoxin, a potent topoisomerase inhibitor. Our results enable production of the etoposide aglycone in tobacco and circumvent the need for cultivation of mayapple and semisynthetic epimerization and demethylation of podophyllotoxin."

The timing, duration and location of Hh signaling activity need to be tightly controlled. Abnormalities of Hh signal transduction lead to birth defects or malignant tumors. Recent data point to ubiquitination-related posttranslational modifications of several key Hh pathway components as an important mechanism of regulation of the Hh pathway. Here we review how ubiquitination regulates the localization, stability and activity of the key Hh signaling components."
26488279,Assembly of the Mycobacterial Cell Wall.,10.1146/annurev-micro-091014-104121,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains one of the most successful bacterial pathogens, claiming over 1.3 million lives worldwide in 2013. The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant isolates has prompted the need for new drugs and drug targets. M. tuberculosis possesses an unusual cell wall dominated by lipids and carbohydrates that provides a permeability barrier against hydrophilic drugs and is crucial for its survival and virulence. This large macromolecular structure, termed the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, and the phosphatidyl-myo-inositol-based lipoglycans are key features of the mycobacterial cell wall. Assembly of these cell wall components is an attractive target for the development of chemotherapeutics against tuberculosis. Herein, we focus on recent biochemical and molecular insights into these complex molecules of M. tuberculosis cell wall."
26558757,The Distribution of Coumarins and Furanocoumarins in Citrus Species Closely Matches Citrus Phylogeny and Reflects the Organization of Biosynthetic Pathways.,10.1371/journal.pone.0142757,"Citrus plants are able to produce defense compounds such as coumarins and furanocoumarins to cope with herbivorous insects and pathogens. In humans, these chemical compounds are strong photosensitizers and can interact with medications, leading to the ""grapefruit juice effect"". Removing coumarins and furanocoumarins from food and cosmetics imply additional costs and might alter product quality. Thus, the selection of Citrus cultivars displaying low coumarin and furanocoumarin contents constitutes a valuable alternative. In this study, we performed ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analyses to determine the contents of these compounds within the peel and the pulp of 61 Citrus species representative of the genetic diversity all Citrus. Generally, Citrus peel contains larger diversity and higher concentrations of coumarin/furanocoumarin than the pulp of the same fruits. According to the chemotypes found in the peel, Citrus species can be separated into 4 groups that correspond to the 4 ancestral taxa (pummelos, mandarins, citrons and papedas) and extended with their respective secondary species descendants. Three of the 4 ancestral taxa (pummelos, citrons and papedas) synthesize high amounts of these compounds, whereas mandarins appear practically devoid of them. Additionally, all ancestral taxa and their hybrids are logically organized according to the coumarin and furanocoumarin pathways described in the literature. This organization allows hypotheses to be drawn regarding the biosynthetic origin of compounds for which the biogenesis remains unresolved. Determining coumarin and furanocoumarin contents is also helpful for hypothesizing the origin of Citrus species for which the phylogeny is presently not firmly established. Finally, this work also notes favorable hybridization schemes that will lead to low coumarin and furanocoumarin contents, and we propose to select mandarins and Ichang papeda as Citrus varieties for use in creating species devoid of these toxic compounds in future breeding programs."
26598298,Autophagy in Plants--What's New on the Menu?,10.1016/j.tplants.2015.10.008,"Autophagy is a major cellular degradation pathway in eukaryotes. Recent studies have revealed the importance of autophagy in many aspects of plant life, including seedling establishment, plant development, stress resistance, metabolism, and reproduction. This is manifested by the dual ability of autophagy to execute bulk degradation under severe environmental conditions, while simultaneously to be highly selective in targeting specific compartments and protein complexes to regulate key cellular processes, even during favorable growth conditions. Delivery of cellular components to the vacuole enables their recycling, affecting the plant metabolome, especially under stress. Recent research in Arabidopsis has further unveiled fundamental mechanistic aspects in autophagy which may have relevance in non-plant systems. We review the most recent discoveries concerning autophagy in plants, touching upon all these aspects."
26610024,Complete nitrification by Nitrospira bacteria.,10.1038/nature16461,"Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been considered to be a two-step process catalysed by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms oxidizing either ammonia or nitrite. No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly activated during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities."
26610025,Complete nitrification by a single microorganism.,10.1038/nature16459,"Nitrification is a two-step process where ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and/or archaea, and subsequently to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Already described by Winogradsky in 1890, this division of labour between the two functional groups is a generally accepted characteristic of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. Complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate in one organism (complete ammonia oxidation; comammox) is energetically feasible, and it was postulated that this process could occur under conditions selecting for species with lower growth rates but higher growth yields than canonical ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Still, organisms catalysing this process have not yet been discovered. Here we report the enrichment and initial characterization of two Nitrospira species that encode all the enzymes necessary for ammonia oxidation via nitrite to nitrate in their genomes, and indeed completely oxidize ammonium to nitrate to conserve energy. Their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzymes are phylogenetically distinct from currently identified AMOs, rendering recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from known ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms unlikely. We also found highly similar amoA sequences (encoding the AMO subunit A) in public sequence databases, which were apparently misclassified as methane monooxygenases. This recognition of a novel amoA sequence group will lead to an improved understanding of the environmental abundance and distribution of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Furthermore, the discovery of the long-sought-after comammox process will change our perception of the nitrogen cycle."
26611876,Mitophagy programs: mechanisms and physiological implications of mitochondrial targeting by autophagy.,10.1007/s00018-015-2087-8,"Mitochondria are an essential source of ATP for cellular function, but when damaged, mitochondria generate a plethora of stress signals, which lead to cellular dysfunction and eventually programmed cell death. Thus, a major component of maintaining cellular homeostasis is the recognition and removal of dysfunctional mitochondria through autophagy-mediated degradation, i.e., mitophagy. Mitophagy further constitutes a developmental program, and undergoes a high degree of crosstalk with apoptosis. Reduced mitochondrial quality control is linked to disease pathogenesis, suggesting the importance of process elucidation as a clinical target. Recent work has revealed multiple mitophagy programs that operate independently or undergo crosstalk, and require modulated autophagy receptor activities at outer membranes of mitochondria. Here, we review these mitophagy programs, focusing on pathway mechanisms which recognize and target mitochondria for sequestration by autophagosomes, as well as mechanisms controlling pathway activities. Furthermore, we provide an introduction to the currently available methods for detecting mitophagy."
26614870,New Insight into the Mechanism and Function of Autophagy in Plant Cells.,10.1016/bs.ircmb.2015.07.005,"Autophagy is a degradation pathway that is conserved throughout eukaryotic organisms and plays important roles in the tolerance of abiotic and biotic stresses. It functions as a housekeeping process to remove unwanted cell components under normal conditions, and is induced during stress and senescence to break down damaged cellular contents and to recycle materials. The target components are engulfed into specialized transport structures termed autophagosomes and are subsequently delivered to the vacuole for degradation. Here, we review milestones in the study of autophagy in plants, discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism and physiological roles of plant autophagy, and highlight potential future directions of research."
26615435,Regulation of Flagellar Gene Expression in Bacteria.,10.1134/S000629791511005X,"The flagellum of a bacterium is a supramolecular structure of extreme complexity comprising simultaneously both a unique system of protein transport and a molecular machine that enables the bacterial cell movement. The cascade of expression of genes encoding flagellar components is closely coordinated with the steps of molecular machine assembly, constituting an amazing regulatory system. Data on structure, assembly, and regulation of flagellar gene expression are summarized in this review. The regulatory mechanisms and correlation of the process of regulation of gene expression and flagellum assembly known from the literature are described."
26700108,Microbial Surface Colonization and Biofilm Development in Marine Environments.,10.1128/MMBR.00037-15,"Biotic and abiotic surfaces in marine waters are rapidly colonized by microorganisms. Surface colonization and subsequent biofilm formation and development provide numerous advantages to these organisms and support critical ecological and biogeochemical functions in the changing marine environment. Microbial surface association also contributes to deleterious effects such as biofouling, biocorrosion, and the persistence and transmission of harmful or pathogenic microorganisms and their genetic determinants. The processes and mechanisms of colonization as well as key players among the surface-associated microbiota have been studied for several decades. Accumulating evidence indicates that specific cell-surface, cell-cell, and interpopulation interactions shape the composition, structure, spatiotemporal dynamics, and functions of surface-associated microbial communities. Several key microbial processes and mechanisms, including (i) surface, population, and community sensing and signaling, (ii) intraspecies and interspecies communication and interaction, and (iii) the regulatory balance between cooperation and competition, have been identified as critical for the microbial surface association lifestyle. In this review, recent progress in the study of marine microbial surface colonization and biofilm development is synthesized and discussed. Major gaps in our knowledge remain. We pose questions for targeted investigation of surface-specific community-level microbial features, answers to which would advance our understanding of surface-associated microbial community ecology and the biogeochemical functions of these communities at levels from molecular mechanistic details through systems biological integration."
26869525,iRhoms; Its Functions and Essential Roles.,10.4062/biomolther.2015.149,"In Drosophila, rhomboid proteases are active cardinal regulators of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. iRhom1 and iRhom2, which are inactive homologs of rhomboid intramembrane serine proteases, are lacking essential catalytic residues. These are necessary for maturation and traffickingof tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) converting enzyme (TACE) from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to plasma membrane through Golgi, and associated with the fates of various ligands for EGFR. Recent studies have clarifiedthat the activation or downregulation of EGFR signaling pathways by alteration of iRhoms are connected to several human diseases including tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC) which is the autosomal dominant syndrom, breast cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, this review focuses on our understanding of iRhoms and the involved mechanisms in the cellular processes."
26882551,The ubiquitin signal and autophagy: an orchestrated dance leading to mitochondrial degradation.,10.15252/embr.201541486,"The quality of mitochondria, essential organelles that produce ATP and regulate numerous metabolic pathways, must be strictly monitored to maintain cell homeostasis. The loss of mitochondrial quality control systems is acknowledged as a determinant for many types of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). The two gene products mutated in the autosomal recessive forms of familial early-onset PD, Parkin and PINK1, have been identified as essential proteins in the clearance of damaged mitochondria via an autophagic pathway termed mitophagy. Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding how the mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase PINK1 and the E3 ligase Parkin work together through a novel stepwise cascade to identify and eliminate damaged mitochondria, a process that relies on the orchestrated crosstalk between ubiquitin/phosphorylation signaling and autophagy. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms governing Parkin-/PINK1-mediated mitophagy and the evidences connecting Parkin/PINK1 function and mitochondrial clearance in neurons."
26912609,Crystal Structure of the Oligomeric Form of Lassa Virus Matrix Protein Z.,10.1128/JVI.02896-15,"The arenavirus matrix protein Z is highly multifunctional and occurs in both monomeric and oligomeric forms. The crystal structure of a dodecamer of Z from Lassa virus, presented here, illustrates a ring-like structure with a highly basic center. Mutagenesis demonstrates that the dimeric interface within the dodecamer and a Lys-Trp-Lys triad at the center of the ring are important for oligomerization. This structure provides an additional template to explore the many functions of Z."
26923585,Identification of a Post-translational Modification with Ribitol-Phosphate and Its Defect in Muscular Dystrophy.,10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.017,"Glycosylation is an essential post-translational modification that underlies many biological processes and diseases. α-dystroglycan (α-DG) is a receptor for matrix and synaptic proteins that causes muscular dystrophy and lissencephaly upon its abnormal glycosylation (α-dystroglycanopathies). Here we identify the glycan unit ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P), a phosphoric ester of pentose alcohol, in α-DG. Rbo5P forms a tandem repeat and functions as a scaffold for the formation of the ligand-binding moiety. We show that enzyme activities of three major α-dystroglycanopathy-causing proteins are involved in the synthesis of tandem Rbo5P. Isoprenoid synthase domain-containing (ISPD) is cytidine diphosphate ribitol (CDP-Rbo) synthase. Fukutin and fukutin-related protein are sequentially acting Rbo5P transferases that use CDP-Rbo. Consequently, Rbo5P glycosylation is defective in α-dystroglycanopathy models. Supplementation of CDP-Rbo to ISPD-deficient cells restored α-DG glycosylation. These findings establish the molecular basis of mammalian Rbo5P glycosylation and provide insight into pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies in α-DG-associated diseases."
27021519,Receptor-mediated mitophagy.,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.010,"Mitochondria are essential organelles that supply ATP through oxidative phosphorylation to maintain cellular homeostasis. Extrinsic or intrinsic agents can impair mitochondria, and these impaired mitochondria can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as byproducts, inducing cellular damage and cell death. The quality control of mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of normal cellular functions, particularly in cardiomyocytes, because they are terminally differentiated. Accumulation of damaged mitochondria is characteristic of various diseases, including heart failure, neurodegenerative disease, and aging-related diseases. Mitochondria are generally degraded through autophagy, an intracellular degradation system that is conserved from yeast to mammals. Autophagy is thought to be a nonselective degradation process in which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are engulfed by isolation membrane to form autophagosomes in eukaryotic cells. However, recent studies have described the process of selective autophagy, which targets specific proteins or organelles such as mitochondria. Mitochondria-specific autophagy is called mitophagy. Dysregulation of mitophagy is implicated in the development of chronic diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases, and heart failure. In this review, we discuss recent progress in research on mitophagy receptors."
27033547,The 3.8 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of Zika virus.,10.1126/science.aaf5316,"The recent rapid spread of Zika virus and its unexpected linkage to birth defects and an autoimmune neurological syndrome have generated worldwide concern. Zika virus is a flavivirus like the dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. We present the 3.8 angstrom resolution structure of mature Zika virus, determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure of Zika virus is similar to other known flavivirus structures, except for the ~10 amino acids that surround the Asn(154) glycosylation site in each of the 180 envelope glycoproteins that make up the icosahedral shell. The carbohydrate moiety associated with this residue, which is recognizable in the cryo-EM electron density, may function as an attachment site of the virus to host cells. This region varies not only among Zika virus strains but also in other flaviviruses, which suggests that differences in this region may influence virus transmission and disease."
27059806,Genetic and functional characterization of a novel meta-pathway for degradation of naringenin in Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1.,10.1111/1462-2920.13313,"In this study, a random mutant library of Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1 was constructed by Tn5 insertion and a mutant incapable of utilizing naringenin as a carbon source was isolated. The Tn5 transposon was found to be inserted in the fdeE gene (Hsero_1007), which encodes a monooxygenase. Two other mutant strains in fdeC (Hsero_1005) and fdeG (Hsero_1009) genes coding for a dioxygenase and a putative cyclase, respectively, were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and then characterized. Liquid Chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS analyses of culture supernatant from the fdeE mutant strain revealed that naringenin remained unaltered, suggesting that the FdeE protein is involved in the initial step of naringenin degradation. LC-MS/MS analyses of culture supernatants from the wild-type (SmR1) and FdeC deficient mutant suggested that in H. seropedicae SmR1 naringenin is first mono-oxygenated by the FdeE protein, to produce 5,7,8-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-4H-chromen-4-one, that is subsequently dioxygenated and cleaved at the A-ring by the FdeC dioxygenase, since the latter compound accumulated in the fdeC strain. After meta-cleavage of the A-ring, the subsequent metabolic steps generate oxaloacetic acid that is metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This bacterium can also modify naringenin by attaching a glycosyl group to the B-ring or a methoxy group to the A-ring, leading to the generation of dead-end products."
27230378,Biosynthesis of a broad-spectrum nicotianamine-like metallophore in Staphylococcus aureus.,10.1126/science.aaf1018,"Metal acquisition is a vital microbial process in metal-scarce environments, such as inside a host. Using metabolomic exploration, targeted mutagenesis, and biochemical analysis, we discovered an operon in Staphylococcus aureus that encodes the different functions required for the biosynthesis and trafficking of a broad-spectrum metallophore related to plant nicotianamine (here called staphylopine). The biosynthesis of staphylopine reveals the association of three enzyme activities: a histidine racemase, an enzyme distantly related to nicotianamine synthase, and a staphylopine dehydrogenase belonging to the DUF2338 family. Staphylopine is involved in nickel, cobalt, zinc, copper, and iron acquisition, depending on the growth conditions. This biosynthetic pathway is conserved across other pathogens, thus underscoring the importance of this metal acquisition strategy in infection."
27357278,HIV Genome-Wide Protein Associations: a Review of 30 Years of Research.,10.1128/MMBR.00065-15,"The HIV genome encodes a small number of viral proteins (i.e., 16), invariably establishing cooperative associations among HIV proteins and between HIV and host proteins, to invade host cells and hijack their internal machineries. As a known example, the HIV envelope glycoprotein GP120 is closely associated with GP41 for viral entry. From a genome-wide perspective, a hypothesis can be worked out to determine whether 16 HIV proteins could develop 120 possible pairwise associations either by physical interactions or by functional associations mediated via HIV or host molecules. Here, we present the first systematic review of experimental evidence on HIV genome-wide protein associations using a large body of publications accumulated over the past 3 decades. Of 120 possible pairwise associations between 16 HIV proteins, at least 34 physical interactions and 17 functional associations have been identified. To achieve efficient viral replication and infection, HIV protein associations play essential roles (e.g., cleavage, inhibition, and activation) during the HIV life cycle. In either a dispensable or an indispensable manner, each HIV protein collaborates with another viral protein to accomplish specific activities that precisely take place at the proper stages of the HIV life cycle. In addition, HIV genome-wide protein associations have an impact on anti-HIV inhibitors due to the extensive cross talk between drug-inhibited proteins and other HIV proteins. Overall, this study presents for the first time a comprehensive overview of HIV genome-wide protein associations, highlighting meticulous collaborations between all viral proteins during the HIV life cycle."
27417139,Assembling of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell Wall Core.,10.1074/jbc.M116.739227,"The unique cell wall of mycobacteria is essential to their viability and the target of many clinically used anti-tuberculosis drugs and inhibitors under development. Despite intensive efforts to identify the ligase(s) responsible for the covalent attachment of the two major heteropolysaccharides of the mycobacterial cell wall, arabinogalactan (AG) and peptidoglycan (PG), the enzyme or enzymes responsible have remained elusive. We here report on the identification of the two enzymes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, CpsA1 (Rv3267) and CpsA2 (Rv3484), responsible for this function. CpsA1 and CpsA2 belong to the widespread LytR-Cps2A-Psr (LCP) family of enzymes that has been shown to catalyze a variety of glycopolymer transfer reactions in Gram-positive bacteria, including the attachment of wall teichoic acids to PG. Although individual cpsA1 and cpsA2 knock-outs of M. tuberculosis were readily obtained, the combined inactivation of both genes appears to be lethal. In the closely related microorganism Corynebacterium glutamicum, the ortholog of cpsA1 is the only gene involved in this function, and its conditional knockdown leads to dramatic changes in the cell wall composition and morphology of the bacteria due to extensive shedding of cell wall material in the culture medium as a result of defective attachment of AG to PG. This work marks an important step in our understanding of the biogenesis of the unique cell envelope of mycobacteria and opens new opportunities for drug development."
27443527,Defending the mitochondria: The pathways of mitophagy and mitochondrial-derived vesicles.,10.1016/j.biocel.2016.07.020,"Mitochondria are the powerhouses for the cell, consuming oxygen to generate sufficient energy for the maintenance of normal cellular processes. However, a deleterious consequence of this process are reactive oxygen species generated as side-products of these reactions. As a means to protect mitochondria from damage, cells and mitochondria have developed a wide-range of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove damaged mitochondrial cargo, enabling the mitochondria to repair the damage and ultimately restore their normal function. If the damage is extensive and mitochondria can no longer be repaired, a process termed mitophagy is initiated in which the mitochondria are directed for autophagic clearance. Canonical mitophagy is regulated by two proteins, PINK1 and Parkin, which are mutated in familial forms of Parkinson's disease. In this review, we discuss recent work elucidating the mechanism of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, along with recently uncovered PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy pathways. Moreover, we describe a novel mitochondrial quality control pathway, involving mitochondrial-derived vesicles that direct distinct and damaged mitochondrial cargo for degradation in the lysosome. Finally, we discuss the association between mitochondrial quality control, cardiac, hepatic and neurodegenerative disease and discuss the possibility of targeting these pathways for therapeutic purposes."
27553474,"Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis, fatty acids and mitochondrial physiology.",10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.08.011,"Mitochondria and fatty acids are tightly connected to a multiplicity of cellular processes that go far beyond mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. In line with this view, there is hardly any common metabolic disorder that is not associated with disturbed mitochondrial lipid handling. Among other aspects of mitochondrial lipid metabolism, apparently all eukaryotes are capable of carrying out de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS) in this cellular compartment in an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-dependent manner. The dual localization of FAS in eukaryotic cells raises the questions why eukaryotes have maintained the FAS in mitochondria in addition to the ""classic"" cytoplasmic FAS and what the products are that cannot be substituted by delivery of fatty acids of extramitochondrial origin. The current evidence indicates that mitochondrial FAS is essential for cellular respiration and mitochondrial biogenesis. Although both β-oxidation and FAS utilize thioester chemistry, CoA acts as acyl-group carrier in the breakdown pathway whereas ACP assumes this role in the synthetic direction. This arrangement metabolically separates these two pathways running towards opposite directions and prevents futile cycling. A role of this pathway in mitochondrial metabolic sensing has recently been proposed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Lipids of Mitochondria edited by Guenther Daum."
27570,Increased urinary excretion of keratan sulfate in fucosidosis.,10.1515/cclm.1978.16.6.329,"In two children exhibiting the clinical symptoms of fucosidosis, the diagnosis was biochemically ascertained by the demonstration of a profound altpha-L-fucosidase deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts. The non-dialysed urines of these fucosidosis patients were separated into two fractions by chromatography on Biogel P-2. The first fraction containing the glycosaminoglycans was further fractionated on Dowex 1 X 2 by stepwise elution with increasing NaCl concentrations. Keratan sulfate-chondroitin sulfates attached to the same peptide core were assayed and characterised mainly in the fractions eluted with 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mol/1 NaCl. Whereas the excretion of normal children of the same age was found to be 0.77 mumol glucosamine equivalents per day in the 2 mol/1 and 3 mol/1 NaCl fraction, the two patients excreted 6.7 (M. C.) and 3.5 (M. S.) mumol glucosamine equivalents per day, respectively. Since keratan sulfate contains alpha-fucose at the non-reducing terminal, this increase in excretion of long chain keratan sulfate in fucosidosis could result from impaired degradation of keratan sulfate, due to the alpha-fucosidase deficiency."

Epithelial cells are held together by the apical junctional complexes, consisting of adherens junctions, and tight junctions (TJs), and by underlying desmosomes. TJs lay in the apical domain of epithelial cells and are mainly composed by transmembrane proteins such as occludin, claudins, JAMs, and tricellulin, that are associated with the cytoplasmic plaque formed by proteins from the MAGUK family, such as ZO-1/2/3, connecting TJ to the actin cytoskeleton, and cingulin and paracingulin connecting TJ to the microtubule network. Extracellular bacteria such as EPEC and EHEC living in the intestinal lumen inject effectors proteins directly from the bacterial cytoplasm to the host cell cytoplasm, where they play a relevant role in the manipulation of the eukaryotic cell functions by modifying or blocking cell signaling pathways. TJ integrity depends on various cell functions such as actin cytoskeleton, microtubule network for vesicular trafficking, membrane integrity, inflammation, and cell survival. EPEC and EHEC effectors target most of these functions. Effectors encoded inside or outside of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) disrupt the TJ strands. EPEC and EHEC exploit the TJ dynamics to open this structure, for causing diarrhea. EPEC and EHEC secrete effectors that mimic host proteins to manipulate the signaling pathways, including those related to TJ dynamics. In this review, we focus on the known mechanisms exploited by EPEC and EHEC effectors for causing TJ disruption."

Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) are known to modulate the innate immune responses of infected cells. The interference is dependent on their type III secretion system (T3SS) and T3SS-dependent effector proteins. Furthermore, these cytosolically injected effectors have been demonstrated to engage multiple immune signaling pathways, including the IFN/STAT, MAPK, NF-κB, and inflammasome pathways. In this review, recent work describing the interaction between EPEC/EHEC and the inflammasome pathway will be discussed."
27701735,PINK1 in the limelight: multiple functions of an eclectic protein in human health and disease.,10.1002/path.4815,"The gene PINK1 [phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1] encodes a serine/threonine kinase which was initially linked to the pathogenesis of a familial form of Parkinson's disease. Research on PINK1 has recently unravelled that its multiple functions extend well beyond neuroprotection, implicating this eclectic protein in a growing number of human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiopulmonary dysfunctions, and inflammation. Extensive studies have identified PINK1 as a crucial player in the mitochondrial quality control pathway, required to label damaged mitochondria and promote their elimination through an autophagic process (mitophagy). Mounting evidence now indicates that PINK1 activities are not restricted solely to mitophagy, and that different subcellular and even sub-mitochondrial pools of PINK1 are involved in distinct signalling cascades to regulate cell metabolism and survival. In this review, we provide a concise overview on the different functions of PINK1 and their potential role in human diseases. Copyright © 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

27732847,Inhibition of WAVE Regulatory Complex Activation by a Bacterial Virulence Effector Counteracts Pathogen Phagocytosis.,10.1016/j.celrep.2016.09.039,"To establish pathogenicity, bacteria must evade phagocytosis directed by remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that macrophages facilitate pathogen phagocytosis through actin polymerization mediated by the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), small GTPases Arf and Rac1, and the Arf1 activator ARNO. To establish extracellular infections, enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) Escherichia coli hijack the actin cytoskeleton by injecting virulence effectors into the host cell. Here, we find that the virulence effector EspG counteracts WRC-dependent phagocytosis, enabling EPEC and EHEC to remain extracellular. By reconstituting membrane-associated actin polymerization, we find that EspG disabled WRC activation through two mechanisms: EspG interaction with Arf6 blocked signaling to ARNO while EspG binding of Arf1 impeded collaboration with Rac1, thereby inhibiting WRC recruitment and activation. Investigating the mode of EspG interference revealed sites in Arf1 required for WRC activation and a mechanism facilitating pathogen evasion of innate host defenses."

Recently, the entire structure of O-mannosyl glycan, [3GlcAβ1-3Xylα1]n-3GlcAβ1-4Xyl-Rbo5P-1Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-4 (phospho-6)Manα1-, which is required for the binding of α-DG to extracellular matrix ligands, has been proposed. However, the linkage of the first Xyl residue to ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P) is not clear. TMEM5 is a gene product responsible for α-dystroglycanopathy and was reported as a potential enzyme involved in this linkage formation, although the experimental evidence is still incomplete. Here, we report that TMEM5 is a xylosyltransferase that forms the Xylβ1-4Rbo5P linkage on O-mannosyl glycan. The anomeric configuration and linkage position of the product (β1,4 linkage) was determined by NMR analysis. The introduction of two missense mutations in TMEM5 found in α-dystroglycanopathy patients impaired xylosyltransferase activity. Furthermore, the disruption of the TMEM5 gene by CRISPR/Cas9 abrogated the elongation of the (-3GlcAβ1-3Xylα1-) unit on O-mannosyl glycan. Based on these results, we concluded that TMEM5 acts as a UDP-d-xylose:ribitol-5-phosphate β1,4-xylosyltransferase in the biosynthetic pathway of O-mannosyl glycan."

Cucurbitacins, a group of bitter and highly oxygenated tetracyclic triterpenes, are mainly produced by the plant family Cucurbitaceae. These compounds have similar structures, but differ in their antitumour activities and ecophysiological roles. By comparative analyses of the genomes of cucumber, melon and watermelon, we uncovered conserved syntenic loci encoding metabolic genes for distinct cucurbitacins. Characterization of the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) identified from these loci enabled us to unveil a novel multi-oxidation CYP for the tailoring of the cucurbitacin core skeleton as well as two other CYPs responsible for the key structural variations among cucurbitacins C, B and E. We also discovered a syntenic gene cluster of transcription factors that regulates the tissue-specific biosynthesis of cucurbitacins and may confer the loss of bitterness phenotypes associated with convergent domestication of wild cucurbits. This study illustrates the potential to exploit comparative genomics to identify enzymes and transcription factors that control the biosynthesis of structurally related yet unique natural products."
27990019,Transcriptional architecture of the mammalian circadian clock.,10.1038/nrg.2016.150,"Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that control 24-hour physiological and behavioural processes in organisms. These cell-autonomous clocks are composed of a transcription-translation-based autoregulatory feedback loop. With the development of next-generation sequencing approaches, biochemical and genomic insights into circadian function have recently come into focus. Genome-wide analyses of the clock transcriptional feedback loop have revealed a global circadian regulation of processes such as transcription factor occupancy, RNA polymerase II recruitment and initiation, nascent transcription, and chromatin remodelling. The genomic targets of circadian clocks are pervasive and are intimately linked to the regulation of metabolism, cell growth and physiology."

28137963,The Role of Efferocytosis in Atherosclerosis.,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.025684,"The necrotic core has long been a hallmark of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Although apoptotic cells are cleared quickly in almost all other tissue beds, their removal appears to be significantly impaired in the diseased blood vessel. Emerging evidence indicates that this phenomenon is caused by a defect in efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic tissue is recognized for engulfment by phagocytic cells such as macrophages. Genetic and experimental data suggest that efferocytosis is impaired during atherogenesis caused by dysregulation of so-called eat me ligands, which govern the edibility of cells undergoing programmed cell death. The following is a summary of recent data indicating that efferocytosis is a major unappreciated driver of lesion expansion but also a reversible defect that can potentially be targeted as a means to prevent plaque progression."

The recently occurred Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in the West African countries have categorized it as an international health concern. For the virus maintenance and transmission, the non-human primates and reservoir hosts like fruit bats have played a vital role. For curbing the disease timely, we need effective therapeutics/prophylactics, however, in the absence of any approved vaccine, timely diagnosis and monitoring of EBOV remains of utmost importance. The technologically advanced vaccines like a viral-vectored vaccine, DNA vaccine and virus-like particles are underway for testing against EBOV. In the absence of any effective control measure, the adaptation of high standards of biosecurity measures, strict sanitary and hygienic practices, strengthening of surveillance and monitoring systems, imposing appropriate quarantine checks and vigilance on trade, transport, and movement of visitors from EVD endemic countries remains the answer of choice for tackling the EBOV spread. Herein, we converse with the current scenario of EBOV giving due emphasis on animal and veterinary perspectives along with advances in diagnosis and control strategies to be adopted, lessons learned from the recent outbreaks and the global preparedness plans. To retrieve the evolutionary information, we have analyzed a total of 56 genome sequences of various EBOV species submitted between 1976 and 2016 in public databases."
28388438,LSM12 and ME31B/DDX6 Define Distinct Modes of Posttranscriptional Regulation by ATAXIN-2 Protein Complex in Drosophila Circadian Pacemaker Neurons.,10.1016/j.molcel.2017.03.004,"ATAXIN-2 (ATX2) has been implicated in human neurodegenerative diseases, yet it remains elusive how ATX2 assembles specific protein complexes to execute its physiological roles. Here we employ the posttranscriptional co-activator function of Drosophila ATX2 to demonstrate that LSM12 and ME31B/DDX6 are two ATX2-associating factors crucial for sustaining circadian rhythms. LSM12 acts as a molecular adaptor for the recruitment of TWENTY-FOUR (TYF) to ATX2. The ATX2-LSM12-TYF complex thereby stimulates TYF-dependent translation of the rate-limiting clock gene period (per) to maintain 24 hr periodicity in circadian behaviors. In contrast, ATX2 contributes to NOT1-mediated gene silencing and associates with NOT1 in a ME31B/DDX6-dependent manner. The ME31B/DDX6-NOT1 complex does not affect PER translation but supports high-amplitude behavioral rhythms along with ATX2, indicating a PER-independent clock function of ATX2. Taken together, these data suggest that the ATX2 complex may switch distinct modes of posttranscriptional regulation through its associating factors to control circadian clocks and ATX2-related physiology."
28392570,Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and its oncogenesis.,10.1038/aps.2017.17,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), a rapidly progressing clonal malignancy of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Exploring the host-HTLV-1 interactions and the molecular mechanisms underlying HTLV-1-mediated tumorigenesis is critical for developing efficient therapies against the viral infection and associated leukemia/lymphoma. It has been demonstrated to date that several HTLV-1 proteins play key roles in the cellular transformation and immortalization of infected T lymphocytes. Of note, the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax inhibits the innate IFN response through interaction with MAVS, STING and RIP1, causing the suppression of TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3/IRF7. The HTLV-1 protein HBZ disrupts genomic integrity and inhibits apoptosis and autophagy of the target cells. Furthermore, it is revealed that HBZ enhances the proliferation of ATL cells and facilitates evasion of the infected cells from immunosurveillance. These studies provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HTLV-1 mediates the formation of cancer as well as useful strategies for the development of new therapeutic interventions against ATL. In this article, we review the recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis, the underlying mechanisms, clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease caused by HTLV-1 infection. In addition, we discuss the future direction for targeting HTLV-1-associated cancers and strategies against HTLV-1."
28393050,How Do the Virulence Factors of Shigella Work Together to Cause Disease?,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00064,"Shigella is the major cause of bacillary dysentery world-wide. It is divided into four species, named S. flexneri, S. sonnei, S. dysenteriae, and S. boydii, which are distinct genomically and in their ability to cause disease. Shigellosis, the clinical presentation of Shigella infection, is characterized by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Shigella's ability to cause disease has been attributed to virulence factors, which are encoded on chromosomal pathogenicity islands and the virulence plasmid. However, information on these virulence factors is not often brought together to create a detailed picture of infection, and how this translates into shigellosis symptoms. Firstly, Shigella secretes virulence factors that induce severe inflammation and mediate enterotoxic effects on the colon, producing the classic watery diarrhea seen early in infection. Secondly, Shigella injects virulence effectors into epithelial cells via its Type III Secretion System to subvert the host cell structure and function. This allows invasion of epithelial cells, establishing a replicative niche, and causes erratic destruction of the colonic epithelium. Thirdly, Shigella produces effectors to down-regulate inflammation and the innate immune response. This promotes infection and limits the adaptive immune response, causing the host to remain partially susceptible to re-infection. Combinations of these virulence factors may contribute to the different symptoms and infection capabilities of the diverse Shigella species, in addition to distinct transmission patterns. Further investigation of the dominant species causing disease, using whole-genome sequencing and genotyping, will allow comparison and identification of crucial virulence factors and may contribute to the production of a pan-Shigella vaccine."
28496201,Engulfment signals and the phagocytic machinery for apoptotic cell clearance.,10.1038/emm.2017.52,"The clearance of apoptotic cells is an essential process for tissue homeostasis. To this end, cells undergoing apoptosis must display engulfment signals, such as 'find-me' and 'eat-me' signals. Engulfment signals are recognized by multiple types of phagocytic machinery in phagocytes, leading to prompt clearance of apoptotic cells. In addition, apoptotic cells and phagocytes release tolerogenic signals to reduce immune responses against apoptotic cell-derived self-antigens. Here we discuss recent advances in our knowledge of engulfment signals, the phagocytic machinery and the signal transduction pathways for apoptotic cell engulfment."
28528442,Herpesvirus Capsid Assembly and DNA Packaging.,10.1007/978-3-319-53168-7_6,"Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) is the causative agent of several pathologies ranging in severity from the common cold sore to life-threatening encephalitic infection. During productive lytic infection, over 80 viral proteins are expressed in a highly regulated manner, resulting in the replication of viral genomes and assembly of progeny virions. The virion of all herpesviruses consists of an external membrane envelope, a proteinaceous layer called the tegument, and an icosahedral capsid containing the double-stranded linear DNA genome. The capsid shell of HSV-1 is built from four structural proteins: a major capsid protein, VP5, which forms the capsomers (hexons and pentons), the triplex consisting of VP19C and VP23 found between the capsomers, and VP26 which binds to VP5 on hexons but not pentons. In addition, the dodecameric pUL6 portal complex occupies 1 of the 12 capsid vertices, and the capsid vertex specific component (CVSC), a heterotrimer complex of pUL17, pUL25, and pUL36, binds specifically to the triplexes adjacent to each penton. The capsid is assembled in the nucleus where the viral genome is packaged into newly assembled closed capsid shells. Cleavage and packaging of replicated, concatemeric viral DNA requires the seven viral proteins encoded by the UL6, UL15, UL17, UL25, UL28, UL32, and UL33 genes. Considerable advances have been made in understanding the structure of the herpesvirus capsid and the function of several of the DNA packaging proteins by applying biochemical, genetic, and structural techniques. This review is a summary of recent advances with respect to the structure of the HSV-1 virion capsid and what is known about the function of the seven packaging proteins and their interactions with each other and with the capsid shell."
28572385,Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus.,10.1126/science.aam7260,"The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a neutralizing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it neutralizes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for vaccine design against these threats to global health."
28583440,Proteasome Structure and Assembly.,10.1016/j.jmb.2017.05.027,"The eukaryotic 26S proteasome is a large multisubunit complex that degrades the majority of proteins in the cell under normal conditions. The 26S proteasome can be divided into two subcomplexes: the 19S regulatory particle and the 20S core particle. Most substrates are first covalently modified by ubiquitin, which then directs them to the proteasome. The function of the regulatory particle is to recognize, unfold, deubiquitylate, and translocate substrates into the core particle, which contains the proteolytic sites of the proteasome. Given the abundance and subunit complexity of the proteasome, the assembly of this ~2.5MDa complex must be carefully orchestrated to ensure its correct formation. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the understanding of proteasome assembly, structure, and function. Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy have resulted in a series of atomic cryo-electron microscopy structures of both human and yeast 26S proteasomes. These structures have illuminated new intricacies and dynamics of the proteasome. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of proteasome assembly, particularly in light of recent structural information."
28630161,Insertion of proteins and lipopolysaccharide into the bacterial outer membrane.,10.1098/rstb.2016.0224,"The bacterial outer membrane contains phospholipids in the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet. Both proteins and LPS must be frequently inserted into the outer membrane to preserve its integrity. The protein complex that inserts LPS into the outer membrane is called LptDE, and consists of an integral membrane protein, LptD, with a separate globular lipoprotein, LptE, inserted in the barrel lumen. The protein complex that inserts newly synthesized outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) into the outer membrane is called the BAM complex, and consists of an integral membrane protein, BamA, plus four lipoproteins, BamB, C, D and E. Recent structural and functional analyses illustrate how these two complexes insert their substrates into the outer membrane by distorting the membrane component (BamA or LptD) to directly access the lipid bilayer.This article is part of the themed issue 'Membrane pores: from structure and assembly, to medicine and technology'."

To expand and improve therapeutic strategies, identification of drug targets involved in several liver cancer-related pathways is crucial. Virtually all signal transduction cascades cross the nuclear envelope and therefore require components of the nuclear transport system (NTS), including nuclear transport receptors (e.g. importins and exportins) and the nuclear pore complex. Accordingly, members of the NTS represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Selective inhibitors of nuclear export have already entered clinical trials for various malignancies. Herein, we review the current knowledge regarding alterations of the NTS and their potential for targeted therapy in HCC."
28754839,A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis.,10.1104/pp.17.00501,"Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) contains α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was eliminated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of potato 16DOX (St16DOX) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22S)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. St16DOX-silenced potato plants contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22S)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato 16DOX (Sl16DOX) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, St16DOX silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that 16DOX may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in potato."
28978703,Atomic Structures of Minor Proteins VI and VII in Human Adenovirus.,10.1128/JVI.00850-17,"Human adenoviruses (Ad) are double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses associated with infectious diseases, but they are better known as tools for gene delivery and oncolytic anticancer therapy. Atomic structures of Ad provide the basis for the development of antivirals and for engineering efforts toward more effective applications. Since 2010, atomic models of human Ad5 have been derived independently from photographic film cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography studies, but discrepancies exist concerning the assignment of cement proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX. To clarify these discrepancies, we employed the technology of direct electron counting to obtain a cryo-EM structure of human Ad5 at 3.2-Å resolution. Our improved structure unambiguously confirms our previous cryo-EM models of proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX and explains the likely cause of conflict in the crystallography models. The improved structure also allows the identification of three new components in the cavity of hexon-the cleaved N terminus of precursor protein VI (pVIn), the cleaved N terminus of precursor protein VII (pVIIn2), and mature protein VI. The binding of pVIIn2-and, by extension, that of genome-condensing pVII-to hexons is consistent with the previously proposed dsDNA genome-capsid coassembly for adenoviruses, which resembles that of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses but differs from the well-established mechanism of pumping dsDNA into a preformed protein capsid exemplified by tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses.IMPORTANCE Adenovirus is a double-edged sword to humans: it is a widespread pathogen but can be used as a bioengineering tool for anticancer and gene therapies. The atomic structure of the virus provides the basis for antiviral and application developments, but conflicting atomic models for the important cement proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX from conventional/film cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography studies have caused confusion. Using cutting-edge cryo-EM technology with electron counting, we improved the structure of human adenovirus type 5 and confirmed our previous models of cement proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX, thus clarifying the inconsistent structures. The improved structure also reveals atomic details of membrane-lytic protein VI and genome-condensing protein VII and supports the previously proposed genome-capsid coassembly mechanism for adenoviruses."

Here, we summarize the positioning of bortezomib, as first-generation proteasome inhibitor, and second-generation proteasome inhibitors in leukemia treatment from a preclinical and clinical perspective. Potential markers for proteasome inhibitor sensitivity and/or resistance emerging from leukemia cell line models and clinical sample studies will be discussed focusing on the role of immunoproteasome and constitutive proteasome (subunit) expression, PSMB5 mutations, and alternative mechanisms of overcoming proteolytic stress."
29203665,Structural studies of Chikungunya virus maturation.,10.1073/pnas.1713166114,"Cleavage of the alphavirus precursor glycoprotein p62 into the E2 and E3 glycoproteins before assembly with the nucleocapsid is the key to producing fusion-competent mature spikes on alphaviruses. Here we present a cryo-EM, 6.8-Å resolution structure of an ""immature"" Chikungunya virus in which the cleavage site has been mutated to inhibit proteolysis. The spikes in the immature virus have a larger radius and are less compact than in the mature virus. Furthermore, domains B on the E2 glycoproteins have less freedom of movement in the immature virus, keeping the fusion loops protected under domain B. In addition, the nucleocapsid of the immature virus is more compact than in the mature virus, protecting a conserved ribosome-binding site in the capsid protein from exposure. These differences suggest that the posttranslational processing of the spikes and nucleocapsid is necessary to produce infectious virus."

Structure reveals a chymotrypsin-like protease fold with a conserved hydrophobic pocket in CHIKV capsid protein (CP) for interaction with the cytoplasmic tail of E2 (cdE2) similar to the capsid protein of other alphaviruses. Molecular contacts between CP-cdE2 were determined by fitting structures of CHIKV CP and cdE2 into the cryo-EM map of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). Binding of (S)-(+)-Mandelic acid (MDA) and Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate (EAB) to the hydrophobic pocket of CP was evaluated by molecular docking. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments confirmed MDA and EAB binding to the CP. The binding constants (KD) obtained from SPR for MDA and EAB were 1.2 × 10-3 M and 0.2 × 10-9 M, respectively. This study adds to the understanding of chikungunya virus structural proteins and may serve as the basis for antiviral development against chikungunya disease."

A promising approach for prevention are live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), some of which target the envelope (E) protein, which is a small membrane protein that forms ion channels. Unfortunately, detailed structural information is still limited for SARS-CoV E, and non-existent for other CoV E proteins. Herein, we report a structural model of a SARS-CoV E construct in LMPG micelles with, for the first time, unequivocal intermolecular NOEs. The model corresponding to the detergent-embedded region is consistent with previously obtained orientational restraints obtained in lipid bilayers and in vivo escape mutants. The C-terminal domain is mostly α-helical, and extramembrane intermolecular NOEs suggest interactions that may affect the TM channel conformation."

The best-characterized system mediating bacterial protein delivery into target eukaryotic cells is the type III secretion system (T3SS) expressed by Gram-negative bacteria, including the human enteric pathogens Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, and enteropathogenic/enterohemorragic Escherichia coli (EPEC/EHEC). The emerging global view is that these T3SS-bearing pathogens share similarities in their ability to target key cellular pathways such as the cell cytoskeleton, trafficking, cell death/survival, and the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In particular, multiple host proteins are targeted in a given pathway, and different T3SS effectors from various pathogens share functional similarities."
29622628,Structure of the herpes simplex virus 1 capsid with associated tegument protein complexes.,10.1126/science.aao7298,"Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) rely on capsid-associated tegument complex (CATC) for long-range axonal transport of their genome-containing capsids between sites of infection and neuronal cell bodies. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the HSV-1 capsid with CATC up to 3.5-angstrom resolution and atomic models of multiple conformers of capsid proteins VP5, VP19c, VP23, and VP26 and tegument proteins pUL17, pUL25, and pUL36. Crowning every capsid vertex are five copies of heteropentameric CATC, each containing a pUL17 monomer supporting the coiled-coil helix bundle of a pUL25 dimer and a pUL36 dimer, thus positioning their flexible domains for potential involvement in nuclear capsid egress and axonal capsid transport. Notwithstanding newly discovered fold conservation between triplex proteins and bacteriophage λ protein gpD and the previously recognized bacteriophage HK97 gp5-like fold in VP5, HSV-1 capsid proteins exhibit extraordinary diversity in forms of domain insertion and conformational polymorphism, not only for interactions with tegument proteins but also for encapsulation of large genomes."
29728654,Structural basis for membrane anchoring and fusion regulation of the herpes simplex virus fusogen gB.,10.1038/s41594-018-0060-6,"Viral fusogens merge viral and cell membranes during cell penetration. Their ectodomains drive fusion by undergoing large-scale refolding, but little is known about the functionally important regions located within or near the membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of full-length glycoprotein B (gB), the fusogen from herpes simplex virus, complemented by electron spin resonance measurements. The membrane-proximal (MPR), transmembrane (TMD), and cytoplasmic (CTD) domains form a uniquely folded trimeric pedestal beneath the ectodomain, which balances dynamic flexibility with extensive, stabilizing membrane interactions. The postfusion conformation of the ectodomain suggests that the CTD likewise adopted the postfusion form. However, hyperfusogenic mutations, which destabilize the prefusion state of gB, target key interfaces and structural motifs that reinforce the observed CTD structure. Thus, a similar CTD structure must stabilize gB in its prefusion state. Our data suggest a model for how this dynamic, membrane-dependent 'clamp' controls the fusogenic refolding of gB."
29875765,Autophagy and Its Interaction With Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens.,10.3389/fimmu.2018.00935,"Cellular responses to stress can be defined by the overwhelming number of changes that cells go through upon contact with and stressful conditions such as infection and modifications in nutritional status. One of the main cellular responses to stress is autophagy. Much progress has been made in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the induction of autophagy during infection by intracellular bacteria. This review aims to discuss recent findings on the role of autophagy as a cellular response to intracellular bacterial pathogens such as, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Legionella pneumophila, how the autophagic machinery senses these bacteria directly or indirectly (through the detection of bacteria-induced nutritional stress), and how some of these bacterial pathogens manage to escape from autophagy."
2995326,Self-cloning in Streptomyces griseus of an str gene cluster for streptomycin biosynthesis and streptomycin resistance.,10.1128/jb.164.1.85-94.1985,"An str gene cluster containing at least four genes (strR, strA, strB, and strC) involved in streptomycin biosynthesis or streptomycin resistance or both was self-cloned in Streptomyces griseus by using plasmid pOA154. The strA gene was verified to encode streptomycin 6-phosphotransferase, a streptomycin resistance factor in S. griseus, by examining the gene product expressed in Escherichia coli. The other three genes were determined by complementation tests with streptomycin-nonproducing mutants whose biochemical lesions were clearly identified. strR complemented streptomycin-sensitive mutant SM196 which exhibited impaired activity of both streptomycin 6-phosphotransferase and amidinotransferase (one of the streptomycin biosynthetic enzymes) due to a regulatory mutation; strB complemented strain SD141, which was specifically deficient in amidinotransferase; and strC complemented strain SD245, which was deficient in linkage between streptidine 6-phosphate and dihydrostreptose. By deletion analysis of plasmids with appropriate restriction endonucleases, the order of the four genes was determined to be strR-strA-strB-strC. Transformation of S. griseus with plasmids carrying both strR and strB genes enhanced amidinotransferase activity in the transformed cells. Based on the gene dosage effect and the biological characteristics of the mutants complemented by strR and strB, it was concluded that strB encodes amidinotransferase and strR encodes a positive effector required for the full expression of strA and strB genes. Furthermore, it was found that amplification of a specific 0.7-kilobase region of the cloned DNA on a plasmid inhibited streptomycin biosynthesis of the transformants. This DNA region might contain a regulatory apparatus that participates in the control of streptomycin biosynthesis."
30121295,Revised Crystal Structure of Human Adenovirus Reveals the Limits on Protein IX Quasi-Equivalence and on Analyzing Large Macromolecular Complexes.,10.1016/j.jmb.2018.08.011,"We report the revised crystal structure of a pseudo-typed human adenovirus at 3.8-Å resolution that is consistent with the atomic models of minor proteins determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The diffraction data from multiple crystals were rescaled and merged to increase the data completeness. The densities for the minor proteins were initially identified in the phase-refined omit maps that were further improved by the phases from docked poly-alanine models to build atomic structures. While the trimeric fiber molecules are disordered due to flexibility and imposition of 5-fold symmetry, the remaining major capsid proteins hexon and penton base are clearly ordered, with the exception of hypervariable region 1 of hexons, the RGD containing loop, and the N-termini of the penton base. The exterior minor protein IX together with the interior minor proteins IIIa and VIII stabilizes the adenovirus virion. A segment of N-terminal pro-peptide of VI is found in the interior cavities of peripentonal hexons, and the rest of VI is disordered. While the triskelion substructures formed by the N-termini of IX conform to excellent quasi 3-fold symmetry, the tetrameric coiled-coils formed by the C-termini and organized in parallel and anti-parallel arrangement do not exhibit any quasi-symmetry. This observation also conveys the pitfalls of using the quasi-equivalence as validation criteria for the structural analysis of extended (non-modular) capsid proteins such as IX. Together, these results remedy certain discrepancies in the previous X-ray model in agreement with the cryo-electron microscopy models."
30165442,Efferocytosis and autoimmune disease.,10.1093/intimm/dxy055,"An enormous number of cells in the body die by apoptosis during development and under homeostasis. Apoptotic cells are swiftly engulfed by macrophages and digested into units. This removal of apoptotic cells is called 'efferocytosis'. For efferocytosis, macrophages recognize phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) exposed on the cell surface as an 'eat me' signal. In healthy cells, PtdSer is exclusively localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by the action of flippases. When cells undergo apoptosis, caspase cleaves flippases to inactivate them, while it cleaves pro-scramblases to active scramblases, which quickly translocate PtdSer to the cell surface. The PtdSer is then recognized by PtdSer-binding proteins or by PtdSer receptors on macrophages, which subsequently engulf the apoptotic cells. When efferocytosis fails, apoptotic cells can rupture, releasing cellular materials that can evoke an autoimmune response. Thus, a defect in the PtdSer-exposing or PtdSer-recognizing processes triggers autoimmunity, leading to a systemic lupus erythematosus-type autoimmune disease."
30201289,Role of the malonyl-CoA synthetase ACSF3 in mitochondrial metabolism.,10.1016/j.jbior.2018.09.002,"Malonyl-CoA is a central metabolite in fatty acid biochemistry. It is the rate-determining intermediate in fatty acid synthesis but is also an allosteric inhibitor of the rate-setting step in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation. While these canonical cytoplasmic roles of malonyl-CoA have been well described, malonyl-CoA can also be generated within the mitochondrial matrix by an alternative pathway: the ATP-dependent ligation of malonate to Coenzyme A by the malonyl-CoA synthetase ACSF3. Malonate, a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase of the TCA cycle, is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. A major role for ACSF3 is to provide a metabolic pathway for the clearance of malonate by the generation of malonyl-CoA, which can then be decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Additionally, ACSF3-derived malonyl-CoA can be used to malonylate lysine residues on proteins within the matrix of mitochondria, possibly adding another regulatory layer to post-translational control of mitochondrial metabolism. The discovery of ACSF3-mediated generation of malonyl-CoA defines a new mitochondrial metabolic pathway and raises new questions about how the metabolic fates of this multifunctional metabolite intersect with mitochondrial metabolism."
30245684,The Role of Outer Membrane Proteins and Lipopolysaccharides for the Sensitivity of Escherichia coli to Antimicrobial Peptides.,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02153,"Bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics is emerging worldwide. The number of infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria is increasing and becoming a serious threat for human health globally. In particular, Gram-negative pathogens including multidrug resistant Escherichia coli are of serious concern being resistant to the currently available antibiotics. All Gram-negative bacteria are enclosed by an outer membrane which acts as an additional protection barrier preventing the entry of toxic compounds including antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In this study we report that the outer membrane component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays a crucial role for the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli BW25113 against the cationic AMPs Cap18, Cap11, Cap11-1-18m2, melittin, indolicidin, cecropin P1, cecropin B, and the polypeptide antibiotic colistin, whereas the outer membrane protease OmpT and the lipoprotein Lpp only play a minor role for the susceptibility against cationic AMPs. Increased susceptibility toward cationic AMPs was found for LPS deficient mutants of E. coli BW25113 harboring deletions in any of the genes required for the inner part of core-oligosaccharide of the LPS, waaC, waaE, waaF, waaG, and gmhA. In addition, our study demonstrates that the antimicrobial activity of Cap18, Cap11, Cap11-1-18m2, cecropin B, and cecropin P1 is not only dependent on the inner part of the core oligosaccharide, but also on the outer part and its sugar composition. Finally, we demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity of selected Cap18 derivatives harboring amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic interface, are non-active against wild-type E. coli ATCC29522. By deleting waaC, waaE, waaF, or waaG the antimicrobial activity of the non-active derivatives can be partially or fully restored, suggesting a very close interplay between the LPS core oligosaccharide and the specific Cap18 derivative. Summarizing, this study implicates that the nature of the outer membrane component LPS has a big impact on the antimicrobial activity of cationic AMPs against E. coli. In particular, the inner as well as the outer part of the core oligosaccharide are important elements determining the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli against cationic AMPs."

30315110,Structural and functional characterization of a modified legionaminic acid involved in glycosylation of a bacterial lipopolysaccharide.,10.1074/jbc.RA118.004966,"Nonulosonic acids (NulOs) are a diverse family of α-keto acid carbohydrates present across all branches of life. Bacteria biosynthesize NulOs among which are several related prokaryotic-specific isomers and one of which, N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), is common among all vertebrates. Bacteria display various NulO carbohydrates on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the identities of these molecules tune host-pathogen recognition mechanisms. The opportunistic bacterial pathogen Vibrio vulnificus possesses the genes for NulO biosynthesis; however, the structures and functions of the V. vulnificus NulO glycan are unknown. Using genetic and chemical approaches, we show here that the major NulO produced by a clinical V. vulnificus strain CMCP6 is 5-N-acetyl-7-N-acetyl-d-alanyl-legionaminic acid (Leg5Ac7AcAla). The CMCP6 strain could catabolize modified legionaminic acid, whereas V. vulnificus strain YJ016 produced but did not catabolize a NulO without the N-acetyl-d-alanyl modification. In silico analysis suggested that Leg5Ac7AcAla biosynthesis follows a noncanonical pathway but appears to be present in several bacterial species. Leg5Ac7AcAla contributed to bacterial outer-membrane integrity, as mutant strains unable to produce or incorporate Leg5Ac7AcAla into the LPS have increased membrane permeability, sensitivity to bile salts and antimicrobial peptides, and defects in biofilm formation. Using the crustacean model, Artemia franciscana, we demonstrate that Leg5Ac7AcAla-deficient bacteria have decreased virulence potential compared with WT. Our data indicate that different V. vulnificus strains produce multiple NulOs and that the modified legionaminic acid Leg5Ac7AcAla plays a critical role in the physiology, survivability, and pathogenicity of V. vulnificus CMCP6."

The chief aspects that are summarised include the various pathways whereby mandelate and its structural analogues are converted into catechol or protocatechuate, the properties of the enzymes that are involved in the pathways, and the regulation and genetics of the pathways. The review incorporates the idea that the study of peripheral metabolic pathways is particularly useful for illuminating evolutionary speculations and it concludes with a list of questions that need to be answered."
30867596,Discovery of a pathway for terminal-alkyne amino acid biosynthesis.,10.1038/s41586-019-1020-y,"Living systems can generate an enormous range of cellular functions, from mechanical infrastructure and signalling networks to enzymatic catalysis and information storage, using a notably limited set of chemical functional groups. This observation is especially notable when compared to the breadth of functional groups used as the basis for similar functions in synthetically derived small molecules and materials. The relatively small cross-section between biological and synthetic reactivity space forms the foundation for the development of bioorthogonal chemistry, in which the absence of a pair of reactive functional groups within the cell allows for a selective in situ reaction1-4. However, biologically 'rare' functional groups, such as the fluoro5, chloro6,7, bromo7,8, phosphonate9, enediyne10,11, cyano12, diazo13, alkene14 and alkyne15-17 groups, continue to be discovered in natural products made by plants, fungi and microorganisms, which offers a potential route to genetically encode the endogenous biosynthesis of bioorthogonal reagents within living organisms. In particular, the terminal alkyne has found broad utility via the Cu(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition 'click' reaction18. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a unique pathway to produce a terminal alkyne-containing amino acid in the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya. We found that L-lysine undergoes an unexpected reaction sequence that includes halogenation, oxidative C-C bond cleavage and triple bond formation through a putative allene intermediate. This pathway offers the potential for de novo cellular production of halo-, alkene- and alkyne-labelled proteins and natural products from glucose for a variety of downstream applications."

Over the past several decades, Shigella spp. have also served as model pathogens in the study of bacterial pathogenesis, and Shigella flexneri has become one of the best-studied pathogens on a molecular, cellular, and tissue level. In the arms race between Shigella and the host immune system, Shigella has developed highly sophisticated mechanisms to subvert host cell processes in order to promote infection, escape immune detection, and prevent bacterial clearance. Here, we give an overview of Shigella pathogenesis while highlighting innovative techniques and methods whose application has significantly advanced our understanding of Shigella pathogenesis in recent years."

During virion assembly, CA drives the formation of the hexameric lattice in immature viral particles, while in mature virions CA monomers assemble in cone-shaped cores surrounding the viral RNA genome and associated proteins. In addition to its functions in late stages of the viral replication cycle, CA plays key roles in a number of processes during early phases of HIV-1 infection including trafficking, uncoating, recognition by host cellular proteins and nuclear import of the viral pre-integration complex. As a result of efficient cooperation of CA with other viral and cellular proteins, integration of the viral genetic material into the host genome, which is an essential step for productive viral infection, successfully occurs. In this review, we will summarize available data on CA functions in HIV-1 replication, describing in detail its roles in late and early phases of the viral replication cycle."
31080061,Cryo-EM Structure of Chikungunya Virus in Complex with the Mxra8 Receptor.,10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.006,"Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses that cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease in humans. Herein, we present a 2.2 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of Mxra8 and 4 to 5 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of Mxra8 bound to chikungunya (CHIKV) virus-like particles and infectious virus. The Mxra8 ectodomain contains two strand-swapped Ig-like domains oriented in a unique disulfide-linked head-to-head arrangement. Mxra8 binds by wedging into a cleft created by two adjacent CHIKV E2-E1 heterodimers in one trimeric spike and engaging a neighboring spike. Two binding modes are observed with the fully mature VLP, with one Mxra8 binding with unique contacts. Only the high-affinity binding mode was observed in the complex with infectious CHIKV, as viral maturation and E3 occupancy appear to influence receptor binding-site usage. Our studies provide insight into how Mxra8 binds CHIKV and creates a path for developing alphavirus entry inhibitors."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 257 million people are living with HBV. Moreover, 20,900 acute hepatitis B cases were reported in 2016. Hepatitis B is highly prevalent in the African, Western Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and European regions, respectively. Due to the high mutational rate of HBV and lack of reverse transcriptase proofreading activity, ten different genotypes with different geographical distributions have been identified. HBV pathogenesis and severity of infection depend on several host and viral factors, particularly, the genetic variability of both the host and virus. Although HBV infection is a global health concern, there is a lack of adequate studies and reports in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Here, we provide a review on HBV epidemiology, pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, coinfection with selected viruses, and laboratory diagnosis, focusing on studies conducted in the MENA region to determine the current situation of the HBV infection and outline the future study areas."
31142842,Cryo-EM structures of herpes simplex virus type 1 portal vertex and packaged genome.,10.1038/s41586-019-1248-6,"Herpesviruses are enveloped viruses that are prevalent in the human population and are responsible for diverse pathologies, including cold sores, birth defects and cancers. They are characterized by a highly pressurized pseudo-icosahedral capsid-with triangulation number (T) equal to 16-encapsidating a tightly packed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome1-3. A key process in the herpesvirus life cycle involves the recruitment of an ATP-driven terminase to a unique portal vertex to recognize, package and cleave concatemeric dsDNA, ultimately giving rise to a pressurized, genome-containing virion4,5. Although this process has been studied in dsDNA phages6-9-with which herpesviruses bear some similarities-a lack of high-resolution in situ structures of genome-packaging machinery has prevented the elucidation of how these multi-step reactions, which require close coordination among multiple actors, occur in an integrated environment. To better define the structural basis of genome packaging and organization in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), we developed sequential localized classification and symmetry relaxation methods to process cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of HSV-1 virions, which enabled us to decouple and reconstruct hetero-symmetric and asymmetric elements within the pseudo-icosahedral capsid. Here we present in situ structures of the unique portal vertex, genomic termini and ordered dsDNA coils in the capsid spooled around a disordered dsDNA core. We identify tentacle-like helices and a globular complex capping the portal vertex that is not observed in phages, indicative of herpesvirus-specific adaptations in the DNA-packaging process. Finally, our atomic models of portal vertex elements reveal how the fivefold-related capsid accommodates symmetry mismatch imparted by the dodecameric portal-a longstanding mystery in icosahedral viruses-and inform possible DNA-sequence recognition and headful-sensing pathways involved in genome packaging. This work showcases how to resolve symmetry-mismatched elements in a large eukaryotic virus and provides insights into the mechanisms of herpesvirus genome packaging."
31482072,Evolutionary and Structural Overview of Human Picornavirus Capsid Antibody Evasion.,10.3389/fcimb.2019.00283,"Picornaviruses constitute one of the most relevant viral groups according to their impact on human and animal health. Etiologic agents of a broad spectrum of illnesses with a clinical presentation that ranges from asymptomatic to fatal disease, they have been the cause of uncountable epidemics throughout history. Picornaviruses are small naked RNA-positive single-stranded viruses that include some of the most important pillars in the development of virology, comprising poliovirus, rhinovirus, and hepatitis A virus. Picornavirus infectious particles use the fecal-oral or respiratory routes as primary modes of transmission. In this regard, successful viral spread relies on the capability of viral capsids to (i) shelter the viral genome, (ii) display molecular determinants for cell receptor recognition, (iii) facilitate efficient genome delivery, and (iv) escape from the immune system. Importantly, picornaviruses display a substantial amount of genetic variability driven by both mutation and recombination. Therefore, the outcome of their replication results in the emergence of a genetically diverse cloud of individuals presenting phenotypic variance. The host humoral response against the capsid protein represents the most active immune pressure and primary weapon to control the infection. Since the preservation of the capsid function is deeply rooted in the virus evolutionary dynamics, here we review the current structural evidence focused on capsid antibody evasion mechanisms from that perspective."
31527435,Equol: A Bacterial Metabolite from The Daidzein Isoflavone and Its Presumed Beneficial Health Effects.,10.3390/nu11092231,"Epidemiological data suggest that regular intake of isoflavones from soy reduces the incidence of estrogen-dependent and aging-associated disorders, such as menopause symptoms in women, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Equol, produced from daidzein, is the isoflavone-derived metabolite with the greatest estrogenic and antioxidant activity. Consequently, equol has been endorsed as having many beneficial effects on human health. The conversion of daidzein into equol takes place in the intestine via the action of reductase enzymes belonging to incompletely characterized members of the gut microbiota. While all animal species analyzed so far produce equol, only between one third and one half of human subjects (depending on the community) are able to do so, ostensibly those that harbor equol-producing microbes. Conceivably, these subjects might be the only ones who can fully benefit from soy or isoflavone consumption. This review summarizes current knowledge on the microorganisms involved in, the genetic background to, and the biochemical pathways of, equol biosynthesis. It also outlines the results of recent clinical trials and meta-analyses on the effects of equol on different areas of human health and discusses briefly its presumptive mode of action."
3161730,Intralysosomal formation and metabolic fate of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate from keratan sulfate.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1985.tb09138.x,"The physiological relevance of the ability of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A to liberate N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate from polymeric keratan sulfate was investigated. Upon intravenous injection into rats of [35S]sulfate-labeled proteokeratan sulfate up to 25% of the radioactivity excreted with the urine were identified as N-acetyl-glucosamine 6-sulfate. Within 24 h, however, excretion of inorganic sulfate rose at the expense of the sulfated monosaccharide. Upon incubation in vitro of liver lysosomes from rats treated with proteokeratan sulfate, inorganic sulfate and minor amounts of sulfated monosaccharide were found in the incubation fluid. Cultured rat peritoneal macrophages ingested proteokeratan sulfate with a clearance rate of 6-9 micrograms X h-1 X mg cell protein-1 and degraded it rapidly. Inorganic sulfate but not N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate was delivered to the culture medium. During a chase period the amount of intracellular N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate fell, and a corresponding amount of sulfate could be found extracellularly. Significant amount of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate were only found in the culture medium when the cells were challenged with zymosan. These results suggest that N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate is a physiological intermediate during the degradation of keratan sulfate, but is usually hydrolyzed intralysosomally by N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase. Genetic deficiency of the sulfatase in humans therefore results in excessive excretion of the sulfated amino sugar but not of keratan sulfate."
31711962,Mobile Loops and Electrostatic Interactions Maintain the Flexible Tail Tube of Bacteriophage Lambda.,10.1016/j.jmb.2019.10.031,"The long flexible tail tube of bacteriophage lambda connects its capsid to the tail tip. On infection, a DNA ejection signal is passed from the tip, along the tube to the capsid that triggers passage of the DNA down the tube and into the host bacterium. The tail tube is built from repeating units of the major tail protein, gpV, which has two distinctive domains. Its N-terminal domain has the same fold as proteins that form the rigid inner tubes of contractile tail phages, such as T4, and its C-terminal domain adopt an Ig-like fold of unknown function. We determined structures of the lambda tail tube in free tails and in virions before and after DNA ejection using cryoelectron microscopy. Modeling of the density maps reveals how electrostatic interactions and a mobile loop participate in assembly and also impart flexibility to the tube while maintaining its integrity. We also demonstrate how a common protein fold produces rigid tubes in some phages but flexible tubes in others."
31769422,The Emerging Roles of ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Complexes in Pancreatic Cancer.,10.3390/cancers11121859,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer with low survival rates. Genetic and epigenetic dysregulation has been associated with the initiation and progression of pancreatic tumors. Multiple studies have pointed to the involvement of aberrant chromatin modifications in driving tumor behavior. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes regulate chromatin structure and have critical roles in stem cell maintenance, development, and cancer. Frequent mutations and chromosomal aberrations in the genes associated with subunits of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes have been detected in different cancer types. In this review, we summarize the current literature on the genomic alterations and mechanistic studies of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes in pancreatic cancer. Our review is focused on the four main subfamilies: SWItch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF), imitation SWI (ISWI), chromodomain-helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD), and INOsitol-requiring mutant 80 (INO80). Finally, we discuss potential novel treatment options that use small molecules to target these complexes."

Accordingly, defective efferocytosis underlies a growing list of chronic inflammatory diseases. Although much has been learnt about the mechanisms of apoptotic cell recognition and uptake, several key areas remain incompletely understood. This Review focuses on new discoveries related to how phagocytes process the metabolic cargo they receive during apoptotic cell uptake; the links between efferocytosis and the resolution of inflammation in health and disease; and the roles of efferocytosis in host defence. Understanding these aspects of efferocytosis sheds light on key physiological and pathophysiological processes and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for diseases driven by defective efferocytosis and impaired inflammation resolution."
31835031,Structural Basis of Poxvirus Transcription: Transcribing and Capping Vaccinia Complexes.,10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.023,"Poxviruses use virus-encoded multisubunit RNA polymerases (vRNAPs) and RNA-processing factors to generate m7G-capped mRNAs in the host cytoplasm. In the accompanying paper, we report structures of core and complete vRNAP complexes of the prototypic Vaccinia poxvirus (Grimm et al., 2019; in this issue of Cell). Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Vaccinia vRNAP in the form of a transcribing elongation complex and in the form of a co-transcriptional capping complex that contains the viral capping enzyme (CE). The trifunctional CE forms two mobile modules that bind the polymerase surface around the RNA exit tunnel. RNA extends from the vRNAP active site through this tunnel and into the active site of the CE triphosphatase. Structural comparisons suggest that growing RNA triggers large-scale rearrangements on the surface of the transcription machinery during the transition from transcription initiation to RNA capping and elongation. Our structures unravel the basis for synthesis and co-transcriptional modification of poxvirus RNA."
32001526,Structure of nucleosome-bound human BAF complex.,10.1126/science.aaz9761,"Mammalian SWI/SNF family chromatin remodelers, BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), regulate chromatin structure and transcription, and their mutations are linked to cancers. The 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of human BAF bound to the nucleosome reveals that the nucleosome is sandwiched by the base and the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) modules, which are bridged by the actin-related protein (ARP) module. The ATPase motor is positioned proximal to nucleosomal DNA and, upon ATP hydrolysis, engages with and pumps DNA along the nucleosome. The C-terminal α helix of SMARCB1, enriched in positively charged residues frequently mutated in cancers, mediates interactions with an acidic patch of the nucleosome. AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) and the SWI/SNF complex subunit SMARCC serve as a structural core and scaffold in the base module organization, respectively. Our study provides structural insights into subunit organization and nucleosome recognition of human BAF complex."
32060358,Capsid protein structure in Zika virus reveals the flavivirus assembly process.,10.1038/s41467-020-14647-9,"Structures of flavivirus (dengue virus and Zika virus) particles are known to near-atomic resolution and show detailed structure and arrangement of their surface proteins (E and prM in immature virus or M in mature virus). By contrast, the arrangement of the capsid proteins:RNA complex, which forms the core of the particle, is poorly understood, likely due to inherent dynamics. Here, we stabilize immature Zika virus via an antibody that binds across the E and prM proteins, resulting in a subnanometer resolution structure of capsid proteins within the virus particle. Fitting of the capsid protein into densities shows the presence of a helix previously thought to be removed via proteolysis. This structure illuminates capsid protein quaternary organization, including its orientation relative to the lipid membrane and the genomic RNA, and its interactions with the transmembrane regions of the surface proteins. Results show the capsid protein plays a central role in the flavivirus assembly process."

Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination."
32200980,Clinical Implications of Folate Transport in the Central Nervous System.,10.1016/j.tips.2020.02.004,"Folates are essential for key biosynthetic processes in mammalian cells and play a crucial role in the maintenance of central nervous system homeostasis. Mammals lack the metabolic capacity for folate biosynthesis; hence, folate requirements are largely met through dietary sources. To date, three major folate transport pathways have been characterized: the folate receptors (FRs), reduced folate carrier (RFC), and proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT). This article reviews current knowledge on the role of folate transport systems in mediating folate delivery to vital tissues, particularly the brain, and how these pathways are modulated by various regulatory mechanisms. We will also briefly highlight the clinical significance of cerebral folate transport in relation to neurodevelopmental disorders associated with folate deficiency."
32226546,Targeting REV-ERBα for therapeutic purposes: promises and challenges.,10.7150/thno.43834,"REV-ERBα (NR1D1) is a circadian clock component that functions as a transcriptional repressor. Due to its role in direct modulation of metabolic genes, REV-ERBα is regarded as an integrator of cell metabolism with circadian clock. Accordingly, REV-ERBα is first proposed as a drug target for treating sleep disorders and metabolic syndromes (e.g., dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and obesity). Recent years of studies uncover a rather broad role of REV-ERBα in pathological conditions including local inflammatory diseases, heart failure and cancers. Moreover, REV-ERBα is involved in regulation of circadian drug metabolism that has implications in chronopharmacology. In the meantime, recent years have witnessed discovery of an array of new REV-ERBα ligands most of which have pharmacological activities in vivo. In this article, we review the regulatory role of REV-ERBα in various types of diseases and discuss the underlying mechanisms. We also describe the newly discovered ligands and the old ones together with their targeting potential. Despite well-established pharmacological effects of REV-ERBα ligands in animals (preclinical studies), no progress has been made regarding their translation to clinical trials. This implies certain challenges associated with drug development of REV-ERBα ligands. In particular, we discuss the potential challenges related to drug safety (or adverse effects) and bioavailability. For new drug development, it is advocated that REV-ERBα should be targeted to treat local diseases and a targeting drug should be locally distributed, avoiding the adverse effects on other tissues."

Here, we report the full-length structure of the severe fever with thrombocytopaenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) L protein, as determined by cryogenic electron microscopy at 3.4 Å, leading to an atomic model harbouring three functional parts (an endonuclease, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a cap-binding domain) and two structural domains (an arm domain with a blocker motif and a carboxy-terminal lariat domain). The SFTSV L protein has a compact architecture in which its cap-binding pocket is surprisingly occupied by an Arg finger of the blocker motif, and the endonuclease active centre faces back towards the cap-binding pocket, suggesting that domain rearrangements are necessary to acquire the pre-initiation state of the active site. Our results provide insight into the complete architecture of sNSRV-encoded L protein and further the understanding of sNSRV transcription initiation."

This virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus group, the same group of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and for the similarity, it was named SARS-CoV-2. Given the lack of registered clinical therapies or vaccines, many physicians and scientists are investigating previously used clinical drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

32384698,Conserved and Diverse Traits of Adhesion Devices from Siphoviridae Recognizing Proteinaceous or Saccharidic Receptors.,10.3390/v12050512,"Bacteriophages can play beneficial roles in phage therapy and destruction of food pathogens. Conversely, they play negative roles as they infect bacteria involved in fermentation, resulting in serious industrial losses. Siphoviridae phages possess a long non-contractile tail and use a mechanism of infection whose first step is host recognition and binding. They have evolved adhesion devices at their tails' distal end, tuned to recognize specific proteinaceous or saccharidic receptors on the host's surface that span a large spectrum of shapes. In this review, we aimed to identify common patterns beyond this apparent diversity. To this end, we analyzed siphophage tail tips or baseplates, evaluating their known structures, where available, and uncovering patterns with bioinformatics tools when they were not. It was thereby identified that a triad formed by three proteins in complex, i.e., the tape measure protein (TMP), the distal tail protein (Dit), and the tail-associated lysozyme (Tal), is conserved in all phages. This common scaffold may harbor various functional extensions internally while it also serves as a platform for plug-in ancillary or receptor-binding proteins (RBPs). Finally, a group of siphophage baseplates involved in saccharidic receptor recognition exhibits an activation mechanism reminiscent of that observed in Myoviridae."
32429351,The Interplay between HIV-1 Gag Binding to the Plasma Membrane and Env Incorporation.,10.3390/v12050548,"Advancement in drug therapies and patient care have drastically improved the mortality rates of HIV-1 infected individuals. Many of these therapies were developed or improved upon by using structure-based techniques, which underscore the importance of understanding essential mechanisms in the replication cycle of HIV-1 at the structural level. One such process which remains poorly understood is the incorporation of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) into budding virus particles. Assembly of HIV particles is initiated by targeting of the Gag polyproteins to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), a process mediated by the N-terminally myristoylated matrix (MA) domain and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). There is strong evidence that formation of the Gag lattice on the PM is a prerequisite for the incorporation of Env into budding particles. It is also suggested that Env incorporation is mediated by an interaction between its cytoplasmic tail (gp41CT) and the MA domain of Gag. In this review, we highlight the latest developments and current efforts to understand the interplay between gp41CT, MA, and the membrane during assembly. Elucidation of the molecular determinants of Gag-Env-membrane interactions may help in the development of new antiviral therapeutic agents that inhibit particle assembly, Env incorporation and ultimately virus production."
32456000,On the Host Side of the Hepatitis E Virus Life Cycle.,10.3390/cells9051294,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in the world. HEV is an enterically transmitted positive-strand RNA virus found as a non-enveloped particle in bile as well as stool and as a quasi-enveloped particle in blood. Current understanding of the molecular mechanisms and host factors involved in productive HEV infection is incomplete, but recently developed model systems have facilitated rapid progress in this area. Here, we provide an overview of the HEV life cycle with a focus on the host factors required for viral entry, RNA replication, assembly and release. Further developments of HEV model systems and novel technologies should yield a broader picture in the future."
32477596,Genes that Control Vaccinia Virus Immunogenicity.,10.32607/actanaturae.10935,"The live smallpox vaccine was a historical first and highly effective vaccine. However, along with high immunogenicity, the vaccinia virus (VACV) caused serious side effects in vaccinees, sometimes with lethal outcomes. Therefore, after global eradication of smallpox, VACV vaccination was stopped. For this reason, most of the human population worldwide lacks specific immunity against not only smallpox, but also other zoonotic orthopoxviruses. Outbreaks of diseases caused by these viruses have increasingly occurred in humans on different continents. However, use of the classical live VACV vaccine for prevention against these diseases is unacceptable because of potential serious side effects, especially in individuals with suppressed immunity or immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV-infected patients). Therefore, highly attenuated VACV variants that preserve their immunogenicity are needed. This review discusses current ideas about the development of a humoral and cellular immune response to orthopoxvirus infection/vaccination and describes genetic engineering approaches that could be utilized to generate safe and highly immunogenic live VACV vaccines."
32559343,Rationale for targeting complement in COVID-19.,10.15252/emmm.202012642,"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged in China and spread internationally, posing a health emergency to the global community. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an acute respiratory illness that varies from mild to the life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The complement system is part of the innate immune arsenal against pathogens, in which many viruses can evade or employ to mediate cell entry. The immunopathology and acute lung injury orchestrated through the influx of pro-inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils can be directly activated by complement components to prime an overzealous cytokine storm. The manifestations of severe COVID-19 such as the ARDS, sepsis and multiorgan failure have an established relationship with activation of the complement cascade. We have collected evidence from all the current studies we are aware of on SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis and the preceding literature on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection linking severe COVID-19 disease directly with dysfunction of the complement pathways. This information lends support for a therapeutic anti-inflammatory strategy against complement, where a number of clinically ready potential therapeutic agents are available."
32781026,Structure and Energy-Conversion Mechanism of the Bacterial Na+-Driven Flagellar Motor.,10.1016/j.tim.2020.03.010,"Many bacteria swim by means of flagella that are rotated by a nanoscale motor embedded in the cell membrane. Torque is generated by the interaction between ion-conducting membrane proteins that comprise the stator and ring-shaped structures that form the rotor. Although the structure and function of the motor have been extensively studied, many mysteries remain, including the force-generation mechanism, the path of ion flow through the stator, the activation mechanism of the stator, and the mechanism of switching between clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) rotation. We summarize recent knowledge of the Na+-driven flagellar motor, especially the Vibrio polar motor that rotates much faster than the H+-driven motor and provides a useful model system for examining comparative aspects of flagellar function."
32816086,Motility of Vibrio spp.: regulation and controlling strategies.,10.1007/s00253-020-10794-7,"Flagellar motility in bacteria is a highly regulated and complex cellular process that requires high energy investment for movement and host colonization. Motility plays an important role in the lifestyle of Vibrio spp. in the aquatic environment and during host colonization. Flagellar motility in vibrios is associated with several cellular processes, such as movement, colonization, adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence. The transcription of all flagella-related genes occurs hierarchically and is regulated positively or negatively by several transcription factors and regulatory proteins. The flagellar regulatory hierarchy is well studied in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Here, we compared the regulatory cascade and molecules involved in the flagellar motility of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus in detail. The evolutionary relatedness of the master regulator of the polar and lateral flagella in different Vibrio species is also discussed. Although they can form symbiotic associations of some Vibrio species with humans and aquatic organisms can be harmed by several species of Vibrio as a result of surface contact, characterized by flagellar movement. Thus, targeting flagellar motility in pathogenic Vibrio species is considered a promising approach to control Vibrio infections. This approach, along with the strategies for controlling flagellar motility in different species of Vibrio using naturally derived and chemically synthesized compounds, is discussed in this review. KEY POINTS: • Vibrio species are ubiquitous and distributed across the aquatic environments. • The flagellar motility is responsible for the chemotactic movement and initial colonization to the host. • The transition from the motile into the biofilm stage is one of the crucial events in the infection. • Several signaling pathways are involved in the motility and formation of biofilm. • Attenuation of motility by naturally derived or chemically synthesized compounds could be a potential treatment for preventing Vibrio biofilm-associated infections."
32858867,HIV-1 Maturation: Lessons Learned from Inhibitors.,10.3390/v12090940,"Since the emergence of HIV and AIDS in the early 1980s, the development of safe and effective therapies has accompanied a massive increase in our understanding of the fundamental processes that drive HIV biology. As basic HIV research has informed the development of novel therapies, HIV inhibitors have been used as probes for investigating basic mechanisms of HIV-1 replication, transmission, and pathogenesis. This positive feedback cycle has led to the development of highly effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), which has helped stall the progression to AIDS, prolong lives, and reduce transmission of the virus. However, to combat the growing rates of virologic failure and toxicity associated with long-term therapy, it is important to diversify our repertoire of HIV-1 treatments by identifying compounds that block additional steps not targeted by current drugs. Most of the available therapeutics disrupt early events in the replication cycle, with the exception of the protease (PR) inhibitors, which act at the virus maturation step. HIV-1 maturation consists of a series of biochemical changes that facilitate the conversion of an immature, noninfectious particle to a mature infectious virion. These changes include proteolytic processing of the Gag polyprotein by the viral protease (PR), structural rearrangement of the capsid (CA) protein, and assembly of individual CA monomers into hexamers and pentamers that ultimately form the capsid. Here, we review the development and therapeutic potential of maturation inhibitors (MIs), an experimental class of anti-HIV-1 compounds with mechanisms of action distinct from those of the PR inhibitors. We emphasize the key insights into HIV-1 biology and structure that the study of MIs has provided. We will focus on three distinct groups of inhibitors that block HIV-1 maturation: (1) compounds that block the processing of the CA-spacer peptide 1 (SP1) cleavage intermediate, the original class of compounds to which the term MI was applied; (2) CA-binding inhibitors that disrupt capsid condensation; and (3) allosteric integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs) that block the packaging of the viral RNA genome into the condensing capsid during maturation. Although these three classes of compounds have distinct structures and mechanisms of action, they share the ability to block the formation of the condensed conical capsid, thereby blocking particle infectivity."
32908308,The native structure of the assembled matrix protein 1 of influenza A virus.,10.1038/s41586-020-2696-8,"Influenza A virus causes millions of severe cases of disease during annual epidemics. The most abundant protein in influenza virions is matrix protein 1 (M1), which mediates virus assembly by forming an endoskeleton beneath the virus membrane1. The structure of full-length M1, and how it oligomerizes to mediate the assembly of virions, is unknown. Here we determine the complete structure of assembled M1 within intact virus particles, as well as the structure of M1 oligomers reconstituted in vitro. We find that the C-terminal domain of M1 is disordered in solution but can fold and bind in trans to the N-terminal domain of another M1 monomer, thus polymerizing M1 into linear strands that coat the interior surface of the membrane of the assembling virion. In the M1 polymer, five histidine residues-contributed by three different monomers of M1-form a cluster that can serve as the pH-sensitive disassembly switch after entry into a target cell. These structures therefore reveal mechanisms of influenza virus assembly and disassembly."
32979942,Molecular Architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus.,10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.018,"SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S proteins in pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 8.7-11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which revealed overall processing states of the native glycans highly similar to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The native conformation of the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and their higher-order assemblies were revealed. Overall, these characterizations revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in exceptional detail and shed light on how the virus packs its ∼30-kb-long single-segmented RNA in the ∼80-nm-diameter lumen."
32997730,Cryo-EM structures reveal two distinct conformational states in a picornavirus cell entry intermediate.,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008920,"The virions of enteroviruses such as poliovirus undergo a global conformational change after binding to the cellular receptor, characterized by a 4% expansion, and by the opening of holes at the two and quasi-three-fold symmetry axes of the capsid. The resultant particle is called a 135S particle or A-particle and is thought to be on the pathway to a productive infection. Previously published studies have concluded that the membrane-interactive peptides, namely VP4 and the N-terminus of VP1, are irreversibly externalized in the 135S particle. However, using established protocols to produce the 135S particle, and single particle cryo-electron microscopy methods, we have identified at least two unique states that we call the early and late 135S particle. Surprisingly, only in the ""late"" 135S particles have detectable levels of the VP1 N-terminus been trapped outside the capsid. Moreover, we observe a distinct density inside the capsid that can be accounted for by VP4 that remains associated with the genome. Taken together our results conclusively demonstrate that the 135S particle is not a unique conformation, but rather a family of conformations that could exist simultaneously."
33087881,The structural basis of herpesvirus entry.,10.1038/s41579-020-00448-w,"Herpesviruses are ubiquitous, double-stranded DNA, enveloped viruses that establish lifelong infections and cause a range of diseases. Entry into host cells requires binding of the virus to specific receptors, followed by the coordinated action of multiple viral entry glycoproteins to trigger membrane fusion. Although the core fusion machinery is conserved for all herpesviruses, each species uses distinct receptors and receptor-binding glycoproteins. Structural studies of the prototypical herpesviruses herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) entry glycoproteins have defined the interaction sites for glycoprotein complexes and receptors, and have revealed conformational changes that occur on receptor binding. Recent crystallography and electron microscopy studies have refined our model of herpesvirus entry into cells, clarifying both the conserved features and the unique features. In this Review, we discuss recent insights into herpesvirus entry by analysing the structures of entry glycoproteins, including the diverse receptor-binding glycoproteins (HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD), EBV glycoprotein 42 (gp42) and HCMV gH-gL-gO trimer and gH-gL-UL128-UL130-UL131A pentamer), as well gH-gL and the fusion protein gB, which are conserved in all herpesviruses."

Several animals including civets, camels, etc. have been identified as intermediate hosts enabling effective recombination of these viruses to emerge as new virulent and pathogenic strains. Among the seven known human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) have evolved as severe pathogenic forms infecting the human respiratory tract. About 8096 cases and 774 deaths were reported worldwide with the SARS-CoV infection during year 2002; 2229 cases and 791 deaths were reported for the MERS-CoV that emerged during 2012. Recently ~ 33,849,737 cases and 1,012,742 deaths (data as on 30 Sep 2020) were reported from the recent evolver SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies on epidemiology and pathogenicity have shown that the viral spread was potentially caused by the contact route especially through the droplets, aerosols, and contaminated fomites. Genomic studies have confirmed the role of the viral spike protein in virulence and pathogenicity. They target the respiratory tract of the human causing severe progressive pneumonia affecting other organs like central nervous system in case of SARS-CoV, severe renal failure in MERS-CoV, and multi-organ failure in SARS-CoV-2. Herein, with respect to current awareness and role of coronaviruses in global public health, we review the various factors involving the origin, evolution, and transmission including the genetic variations observed, epidemiology, and pathogenicity of the three potential coronaviruses variants SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV."

The prevalence of this autosomal recessive disorder is estimated to be <1/1,000,000. Fifteen different pathogenic variants in the folate receptor 1 gene (FOLR1) encoding the receptor of folate α (FRα) have already been described. We present a new pathogenic variation in the FOLR1 in a childhood-stage patient. We aim to establish the core structure of the FRα protein mandatory for its activity. A three-year-old child was admitted at hospital for a first febrile convulsions episode. Recurrent seizures without fever also occurred a few months later, associated with motor and cognitive impairment. Various antiepileptic drugs failed to control seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed central hypomyelination and biological analysis revealed markedly low levels of 5-MTHF in CSF. Next generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed a CFD with a FOLR1 homozygous variation (c.197 G > A, p.Cys66Tyr). This variation induces an altered folate receptor α protein and underlines the role of a disulfide bond: Cys66-Cys109, essential to transport 5-MTHF into the central nervous system. Fortunately, this severe form of CFD had remarkably responded to high doses of oral folinic acid combined with intravenous administrations."

They are candidates for providing the essential gallate for the biosynthesis of the aluminum-detoxifying metabolite oenothein B. The tree species Eucalyptus camaldulensis shows exceptionally high tolerance against aluminum, a widespread toxic metal in acidic soils. In the roots of E. camaldulensis, aluminum is detoxified via the complexation with oenothein B, a hydrolyzable tannin. In our approach to elucidate the biosynthesis of oenothein B, we here report on the identification of E. camaldulensis enzymes that catalyze the formation of gallate, which is the phenolic constituent of hydrolyzable tannins. By systematical screening of E. camaldulensis dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenases (EcDQD/SDHs), we found two enzymes, EcDQD/SDH2 and 3, catalyzing the NADP+-dependent oxidation of 3-dehydroshikimate to produce gallate. Based on extensive in vitro assays using recombinant EcDQD/SDH2 and 3 enzymes, we present for the first time a detailed characterization of the enzymatic gallate formation activity, including the cofactor preferences, pH optima, and kinetic constants. Sequence analyses and structure modeling suggest the gallate formation activity of EcDQD/SDHs is based on the reorientation of 3-dehydroshikimate in the catalytic center, which facilitates the proton abstraction from the C5 position. Additionally, EcDQD/SDH2 and 3 maintain DQD and SDH activities, resulting in a 3-dehydroshikimate supply for gallate formation. In E. camaldulensis, EcDQD/SDH2 and 3 are co-expressed with UGT84A25a/b and UGT84A26a/b involved in hydrolyzable tannin biosynthesis. We further identified EcDQD/SDH1 as a ""classical"" bifunctional plant shikimate pathway enzyme and EcDQD/SDH4a/b as functional quinate dehydrogenases of the NAD+/NADH-dependent clade. Our data indicate that in E. camaldulensis the enzymes EcDQD/SDH2 and 3 provide the essential gallate for the biosynthesis of the aluminum-detoxifying metabolite oenothein B."
33451326,Antivirals blocking entry of enteroviruses and therapeutic potential.,10.1186/s12929-021-00708-8,"Viruses from the genus Enterovirus (EV) of the Picornaviridae family are known to cause diseases such as hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD), respiratory diseases, encephalitis and myocarditis. The capsid of EV is an attractive target for the development of direct-acting small molecules that can interfere with viral entry. Some of the capsid binders have been evaluated in clinical trials but the majority have failed due to insufficient efficacy or unacceptable off-target effects. Furthermore, most of the capsid binders exhibited a low barrier to resistance. Alternatively, host-targeting inhibitors such as peptides derived from the capsid of EV that can recognize cellular receptors have been identified. However, the majority of these peptides displayed low anti-EV potency (µM range) as compared to the potency of small molecule compounds (nM range). Nonetheless, the development of anti-EV peptides is warranted as they may complement the small-molecules in a drug combination strategy to treat EVs. Lastly, structure-based approach to design antiviral peptides should be utilized to unearth potent anti-EV peptides."

These enteric HAdVs differ notably in tissue tropism and pathogenicity from respiratory and ocular adenoviruses, but the structural basis for this divergence has been unknown. Here, we present the first structure of an enteric HAdV-HAdV-F41-determined by cryo-electron microscopy to a resolution of 3.8 Å. The structure reveals extensive alterations to the virion exterior as compared to nonenteric HAdVs, including a unique arrangement of capsid protein IX. The structure also provides new insights into conserved aspects of HAdV architecture such as a proposed location of core protein V, which links the viral DNA to the capsid, and assembly-induced conformational changes in the penton base protein. Our findings provide the structural basis for adaptation of enteric HAdVs to a fundamentally different tissue tropism."
33707653,Folate metabolism: a re-emerging therapeutic target in haematological cancers.,10.1038/s41375-021-01189-2,"Folate-mediated one carbon (1C) metabolism supports a series of processes that are essential for the cell. Through a number of interlinked reactions happening in the cytosol and mitochondria of the cell, folate metabolism contributes to de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis, to the methionine cycle and redox defence. Targeting the folate metabolism gave rise to modern chemotherapy, through the introduction of antifolates to treat paediatric leukaemia. Since then, antifolates, such as methotrexate and pralatrexate have been used to treat a series of blood cancers in clinic. However, traditional antifolates have many deleterious side effects in normal proliferating tissue, highlighting the urgent need for novel strategies to more selectively target 1C metabolism. Notably, mitochondrial 1C enzymes have been shown to be significantly upregulated in various cancers, making them attractive targets for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. In this article, we present a detailed overview of folate-mediated 1C metabolism, its importance on cellular level and discuss how targeting folate metabolism has been exploited in blood cancers. Additionally, we explore possible therapeutic strategies that could overcome the limitations of traditional antifolates."
33788945,D-Amino acid metabolism in bacteria.,10.1093/jb/mvab043,"Bacteria produce diverse d-amino acids, which are essential components of cell wall peptidoglycan. Incorporation of these d-amino acids into peptidoglycan contributes to bacterial adaptation to environmental changes and threats. d-Amino acids have been associated with bacterial growth, biofilm formation and dispersal and regulation of peptidoglycan metabolism. The diversity of d-amino acids in bacteria is primarily due to the activities of amino acid racemases that catalyse the interconversion of the d- and l-enantiomers of amino acids. Recent studies have revealed that bacteria possess multiple enzymes with amino acid racemase activities. Therefore, elucidating d-amino acid metabolism by these enzymes is critical to understand the biological significance and behaviour of d-amino acids in bacteria. In this review, we focus on the metabolic pathways of d-amino acids in six types of bacteria."

Functional genomic studies revealed a remarkable mutation prevalence of SWI/SNF-encoding genes in 20-25% of all human cancers, frequently driving oncogenic programmes. Some SWI/SNF-mutant cancers are hypersensitive to perturbations in other SWI/SNF subunits, regulatory proteins and distinct biological pathways, often resulting in sustained anticancer effects and synthetic lethal interactions. Exploiting these vulnerabilities is a promising therapeutic strategy. Here, we review the importance of SWI/SNF chromatin remodellers in gene regulation as well as mechanisms leading to assembly defects and their role in cancer development. We will focus in particular on emerging strategies for the targeted therapy of SWI/SNF-deficient cancers using chemical probes, including proteolysis targeting chimeras, to induce synthetic lethality."
33975330,The BHMT-betaine methylation pathway epigenetically modulates oligodendrocyte maturation.,10.1371/journal.pone.0250486,"Research into the epigenome is of growing importance as a loss of epigenetic control has been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have implicated aberrant DNA and histone methylation in multiple sclerosis (MS) disease pathogenesis. We have previously reported that the methyl donor betaine is depleted in MS and is linked to changes in histone H3 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in neurons. We have also shown that betaine increases histone methyltransferase activity by activating chromatin bound betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT). Here, we investigated the role of the BHMT-betaine methylation pathway in oligodendrocytes. Immunocytochemistry in the human MO3.13 cell line, primary rat oligodendrocytes, and tissue from MS postmortem brain confirmed the presence of the BHMT enzyme in the nucleus in oligodendrocytes. BHMT expression is increased 2-fold following oxidative insult, and qRT-PCR demonstrated that betaine can promote an increase in expression of oligodendrocyte maturation genes SOX10 and NKX-2.2 under oxidative conditions. Chromatin fractionation provided evidence of a direct interaction of BHMT on chromatin and co-IP analysis indicates an interaction between BHMT and DNMT3a. Our data show that both histone and DNA methyltransferase activity are increased following betaine administration. Betaine effects were shown to be dependent on BHMT expression following siRNA knockdown of BHMT. This is the first report of BHMT expression in oligodendrocytes and suggests that betaine acts through BHMT to modulate histone and DNA methyltransferase activity on chromatin. These data suggest that methyl donor availability can impact epigenetic changes and maturation in oligodendrocytes."

Folates play a role as cofactors in essential one-carbon pathways donating methyl-groups to choline phospholipids, creatine, epinephrine, DNA. Compounds similar to folates are ubiquitous and have been found in different animals, plants, and microorganisms. Folates enter the body from the diet and are also synthesized by intestinal bacteria with consequent adsorption from the colon. Three types of folate and antifolate cellular transporters have been found, differing in tissue localization, substrate affinity, type of transferring, and optimal pH for function. Laboratory criteria of folate deficiency are accepted by WHO. Severe folate deficiencies, manifesting in early life, are seen in hereditary folate malabsorption and cerebral folate deficiency. Acquired folate deficiency is quite common and is associated with poor diet and malabsorption, alcohol consumption, obesity, and kidney failure. Given the observational data that folates have a protective effect against neural tube defects, ischemic events, and cancer, food folic acid fortification was introduced in many countries. However, high physiological folate concentrations and folate overload may increase the risk of impaired brain development in embryogenesis and possess a growth advantage for precancerous altered cells."
34249946,RAVE and Rabconnectin-3 Complexes as Signal Dependent Regulators of Organelle Acidification.,10.3389/fcell.2021.698190,"The yeast RAVE (Regulator of H+-ATPase of Vacuolar and Endosomal membranes) complex and Rabconnectin-3 complexes of higher eukaryotes regulate acidification of organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes by catalyzing V-ATPase assembly. V-ATPases are highly conserved proton pumps consisting of a peripheral V1 subcomplex that contains the sites of ATP hydrolysis, attached to an integral membrane V o subcomplex that forms the transmembrane proton pore. Reversible disassembly of the V-ATPase is a conserved regulatory mechanism that occurs in response to multiple signals, serving to tune ATPase activity and compartment acidification to changing extracellular conditions. Signals such as glucose deprivation can induce release of V1 from Vo, which inhibits both ATPase activity and proton transport. Reassembly of V1 with Vo restores ATP-driven proton transport, but requires assistance of the RAVE or Rabconnectin-3 complexes. Glucose deprivation triggers V-ATPase disassembly in yeast and is accompanied by binding of RAVE to V1 subcomplexes. Upon glucose readdition, RAVE catalyzes both recruitment of V1 to the vacuolar membrane and its reassembly with Vo. The RAVE complex can be recruited to the vacuolar membrane by glucose in the absence of V1 subunits, indicating that the interaction between RAVE and the Vo membrane domain is glucose-sensitive. Yeast RAVE complexes also distinguish between organelle-specific isoforms of the Vo a-subunit and thus regulate distinct V-ATPase subpopulations. Rabconnectin-3 complexes in higher eukaryotes appear to be functionally equivalent to yeast RAVE. Originally isolated as a two-subunit complex from rat brain, the Rabconnectin-3 complex has regions of homology with yeast RAVE and was shown to interact with V-ATPase subunits and promote endosomal acidification. Current understanding of the structure and function of RAVE and Rabconnectin-3 complexes, their interactions with the V-ATPase, their role in signal-dependent modulation of organelle acidification, and their impact on downstream pathways will be discussed."
34444848,Flavonoid-Modifying Capabilities of the Human Gut Microbiome-An In Silico Study.,10.3390/nu13082688,"Flavonoids are a major group of dietary plant polyphenols and have a positive health impact, but their modification and degradation in the human gut is still widely unknown. Due to the rise of metagenome data of the human gut microbiome and the assembly of hundreds of thousands of bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), large-scale screening for potential flavonoid-modifying enzymes of human gut bacteria is now feasible. With sequences of characterized flavonoid-transforming enzymes as queries, the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein catalog was analyzed and genes encoding putative flavonoid-modifying enzymes were quantified. The results revealed that flavonoid-modifying enzymes are often encoded in gut bacteria hitherto not considered to modify flavonoids. The enzymes for the physiologically important daidzein-to-equol conversion, well studied in Slackiaisoflavoniconvertens, were encoded only to a minor extent in Slackia MAGs, but were more abundant in Adlercreutzia equolifaciens and an uncharacterized Eggerthellaceae species. In addition, enzymes with a sequence identity of about 35% were encoded in highly abundant MAGs of uncultivated Collinsella species, which suggests a hitherto uncharacterized daidzein-to-equol potential in these bacteria. Of all potential flavonoid modification steps, O-deglycosylation (including derhamnosylation) was by far the most abundant in this analysis. In contrast, enzymes putatively involved in C-deglycosylation were detected less often in human gut bacteria and mainly found in Agathobacter faecis (formerly Roseburia faecis). Homologs to phloretin hydrolase, flavanonol/flavanone-cleaving reductase and flavone reductase were of intermediate abundance (several hundred MAGs) and mainly prevalent in Flavonifractor plautii. This first comprehensive insight into the black box of flavonoid modification in the human gut highlights many hitherto overlooked and uncultured bacterial genera and species as potential key organisms in flavonoid modification. This could lead to a significant contribution to future biochemical-microbiological investigations on gut bacterial flavonoid transformation.

Most antiviral vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies that prevent virus entry into cells. However, while the prevention of virus invasion by humoral immunity is well appreciated, considerably less is known about the immune defences present within cells (known as intrinsic immunity) that interfere with virus entry. The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, known for inhibiting fusion between viral and cellular membranes, were once the only factors known to restrict virus entry. However, the progressive development of genetic and pharmacological screening platforms and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have galvanized interest in how viruses infiltrate cells and how cells defend against it. Several host factors with antiviral potential are now implicated in the regulation of virus entry, including cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), lymphocyte antigen 6E (LY6E), nuclear receptor co-activator protein 7 (NCOA7), interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), CD74 and ARFGAP with dual pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein 2 (ADAP2). This Review summarizes what is known and what remains to be understood about the intrinsic factors that form the first line of defence against virus infection."
35026161,Structural basis of bacteriophage lambda capsid maturation.,10.1016/j.str.2021.12.009,"Bacteriophage lambda is an excellent model system for studying capsid assembly of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages, some dsDNA archaeal viruses, and herpesviruses. HK97 fold coat proteins initially assemble into a precursor capsid (procapsid) and subsequent genome packaging triggers morphological expansion of the shell. An auxiliary protein is required to stabilize the expanded capsid structure. To investigate the capsid maturation mechanism, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the bacteriophage lambda procapsid and mature capsid at 3.88 Å and 3.76 Å resolution, respectively. Besides primarily rigid body movements of common features of the major capsid protein gpE, large-scale structural rearrangements of other domains occur simultaneously. Assembly of intercapsomers within the procapsid is facilitated by layer-stacking effects at 3-fold vertices. Upon conformational expansion of the capsid shell, the missing top layer is fulfilled by cementing the gpD protein against the internal pressure of DNA packaging. Our structures illuminate the assembly mechanisms of dsDNA viruses."
35216007,Refined Capsid Structure of Human Adenovirus D26 at 3.4 Å Resolution.,10.3390/v14020414,"Various adenoviruses are being used as viral vectors for the generation of vaccines against chronic and emerging diseases (e.g., AIDS, COVID-19). Here, we report the improved capsid structure for one of these vectors, human adenovirus D26 (HAdV-D26), at 3.4 Å resolution, by reprocessing the previous cryo-electron microscopy dataset and obtaining a refined model. In addition to overall improvements in the model, the highlights of the structure include (1) locating a segment of the processed peptide of VIII that was previously believed to be released from the mature virions, (2) reorientation of the helical appendage domain (APD) of IIIa situated underneath the vertex region relative to its counterpart observed in the cleavage defective (ts1) mutant of HAdV-C5 that resulted in the loss of interactions between the APD and hexon bases, and (3) the revised conformation of the cleaved N-terminal segments of pre-protein VI (pVIn), located in the hexon cavities, is highly conserved, with notable stacking interactions between the conserved His13 and Phe18 residues. Taken together, the improved model of HAdV-D26 capsid provides a better understanding of protein-protein interactions in HAdV capsids and facilitates the efforts to modify and/or design adenoviral vectors with altered properties. Last but not least, we provide some insights into clotting factors (e.g., FX and PF4) binding to AdV vectors."

To allow for this continuous efferocytosis, rapid phenotypic changes occur in the phagocytes enabling them to engulf and digest the apoptotic cargo. In addition, efferocytosis is actively anti-inflammatory and promotes resolution. Owing to its ubiquitous nature and the sheer volume of cell turnover, efferocytosis is a point of vulnerability. Aberrations in efferocytosis are associated with numerous inflammatory pathologies, including atherosclerosis, cancer and infections. The recent exciting discoveries defining the molecular machinery involved in efferocytosis have opened many avenues for therapeutic intervention, with several agents now in clinical trials."

Efferocytosis can lead to the resolution of inflammation and restore tissue homoeostasis; however, the mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution are still not completely understood, and the effects of efferocytosis on other proresolving properties need to be explored and explained. In this review, the process of efferocytosis will be summarized briefly, and then these mechanisms and effects will be thoroughly discussed. In addition, the association between mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining resolution of inflammation and cardiovascular diseases will also be reviewed, as an understanding of this association may provide information on novel treatment targets."
36264808,Structure of the hepatitis C virus E1E2 glycoprotein complex.,10.1126/science.abn9884,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in humans and afflicts more than 58 million people worldwide. The HCV envelope E1 and E2 glycoproteins are essential for viral entry and comprise the primary antigenic target for neutralizing antibody responses. The molecular mechanisms of E1E2 assembly, as well as how the E1E2 heterodimer binds broadly neutralizing antibodies, remain elusive. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the membrane-extracted full-length E1E2 heterodimer in complex with three broadly neutralizing antibodies-AR4A, AT1209, and IGH505-at ~3.5-angstrom resolution. We resolve the interface between the E1 and E2 ectodomains and deliver a blueprint for the rational design of vaccine immunogens and antiviral drugs."

One of these strains, Nocardia sp. strain P18.3, was selected for detailed study. alpha-Pinene-grown cells oxidized, without lag, alpha-pinene, alpha-pinene oxide (epoxide), and the cis and trans isomers of 2-methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienal. No other tested terpene was oxidized at a significant rate. alpha-Pinene was not metabolized by cell extracts in the presence or absence of NADH or NADPH. Cell extracts catalyzed a rapid decyclization of alpha-pinene oxide, in the absence of added cofactors, with the formation of cis-2-methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienal. Further oxidation of the aldehyde to the corresponding acid occurred in the presence of NAD. Both activities were induced by growth with alpha-pinene. A rapid, nonenzymic transformation of the cis aldehyde into the trans isomer occurred in glycine buffer. The trans isomer was also a substrate for the NAD-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase. The distribution of the alpha-pinene oxide lyase in alpha-pinene-utilizing Pseudomonas spp. was also investigated and was compatible with the two alternative ring-cleavage sequences that have been proposed on the basis of accumulated metabolites."
36768667,"Methyl Donors, Epigenetic Alterations, and Brain Health: Understanding the Connection.",10.3390/ijms24032346,"Methyl donors such as choline, betaine, folic acid, methionine, and vitamins B6 and B12 are critical players in the one-carbon metabolism and have neuroprotective functions. The one-carbon metabolism comprises a series of interconnected chemical pathways that are important for normal cellular functions. Among these pathways are those of the methionine and folate cycles, which contribute to the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is the universal methyl donor of methylation reactions such as histone and DNA methylation, two epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression and play roles in human health and disease. Epigenetic mechanisms have been considered a bridge between the effects of environmental factors, such as nutrition, and phenotype. Studies in human and animal models have indicated the importance of the optimal levels of methyl donors on brain health and behavior across the lifespan. Imbalances in the levels of these micronutrients during critical periods of brain development have been linked to epigenetic alterations in the expression of genes that regulate normal brain function. We present studies that support the link between imbalances in the levels of methyl donors, epigenetic alterations, and stress-related disorders. Appropriate levels of these micronutrients should then be monitored at all stages of development for a healthier brain."

These highly valuable compounds are sourced by extraction from the bark, and their biosynthetic pathway is unknown. Here, we sequenced the Q. saponaria genome. Through genome mining and combinatorial expression in tobacco, we identified 16 pathway enzymes that together enable the production of advanced QS pathway intermediates that represent a bridgehead for adjuvant bioengineering. We further identified the enzymes needed to make QS-7, a saponin with excellent therapeutic properties and low toxicity that is present in low abundance in Q. saponaria bark extract. Our results enable the production of Q. saponaria vaccine adjuvants in tobacco and open the way for new routes to access and engineer natural and new-to-nature immunostimulants."

37185947,Cell entry and release of quasi-enveloped human hepatitis viruses.,10.1038/s41579-023-00889-z,"Infectious hepatitis type A and type E are caused by phylogenetically distinct single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that were once considered to be non-enveloped. However, studies show that both are released nonlytically from hepatocytes as 'quasi-enveloped' virions cloaked in host membranes. These virion types predominate in the blood of infected individuals and mediate virus spread within the liver. They lack virally encoded proteins on their surface and are resistant to neutralizing anti-capsid antibodies induced by infection, yet they efficiently enter cells and initiate new rounds of virus replication. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms by which specific peptide sequences in the capsids of these quasi-enveloped virions mediate their endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent release from hepatocytes through multivesicular endosomes, what is known about how they enter cells, and the impact of capsid quasi-envelopment on host immunity and pathogenesis."
37816705,Cryo-EM structure of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus.,10.1038/s41467-023-41804-7,"The severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a tick-borne human-infecting bunyavirus, which utilizes two envelope glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, to enter host cells. However, the structure and organization of these glycoproteins on virion surface are not yet known. Here we describe the structure of SFTSV determined by single particle reconstruction, which allows mechanistic insights into bunyavirus assembly at near-atomic resolution. The SFTSV Gn and Gc proteins exist as heterodimers and further assemble into pentameric and hexameric peplomers, shielding the Gc fusion loops by both intra- and inter-heterodimer interactions. Individual peplomers are associated mainly through the ectodomains, in which the highly conserved glycans on N914 of Gc play a crucial role. This elaborate assembly stabilizes Gc in the metastable prefusion conformation and creates some cryptic epitopes that are only accessible in the intermediate states during virus entry. These findings provide an important basis for developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs."
38929615,Hepatitis E Virus: What More Do We Need to Know?,10.3390/medicina60060998,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is typically a self-limiting, acute illness that spreads through the gastrointestinal tract but replicates in the liver. However, chronic infections are possible in immunocompromised individuals. The HEV virion has two shapes: exosome-like membrane-associated quasi-enveloped virions (eHEV) found in circulating blood or in the supernatant of infected cell cultures and non-enveloped virions (""naked"") found in infected hosts' feces and bile to mediate inter-host transmission. Although HEV is mainly spread via enteric routes, it is unclear how it penetrates the gut wall to reach the portal bloodstream. Both virion types are infectious, but they infect cells in different ways. To develop personalized treatment/prevention strategies and reduce HEV impact on public health, it is necessary to decipher the entry mechanism for both virion types using robust cell culture and animal models. The contemporary knowledge of the cell entry mechanism for these two HEV virions as possible therapeutic target candidates is summarized in this narrative review."

They exhibited strict position specificity for positions 3 of quercetin, 7 of 3-methylquercetin, 4' of 3,7-dimethylquercetin, and 6 of 3,7,3'-trimethylquercetagetin. None of these enzymes reacted with phenylpropanoids, flavones, dihydroflavonols, or any of their glucosides. Except for the 7-OMT whose activity was lost during chromatofocusing, the other enzymes had apparent pI values of 4.8, 5.4, and 5.7 for the 3-, 4'-, and 6-OMTs, respectively. They had similar molecular weights (Mr 57,000) and their pH optima varied between 7.8 and 9.0, with a shift in optimal activity from lower to higher pH with increasing level of substrate methylation. Unlike the 3 and 4' enzymes, the 6-OMT showed an absolute requirement for Mg2+ whose activation was saturable and was inhibited by EDTA. The in vitro stepwise O-methylation of quercetin----3-methylquercetin----3,7-dimethylquercetin----3 ,7, 4'-trimethylquercetin tends to suggest a coordinated sequence of methyl transfers in this tissue."

Tests for utilization of acyclic isoprenols such as citronellol and geraniol were complicated by toxic effects of these alcohols, and most species tested were killed by exposure to citronellol or geraniol (0.1%, vol/vol) in liquid culture. In the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis, sensitivity to isoprenols is reduced by prior induction of the isoprenoid degradative pathway via either growth on succinate in the presence of citronellol or growth on citronellic acid. For this species, citronellic acid proved to be the best isoprenoid growth substrate tested. Geraniol utilization as a taxonomic indicator for different subgroups of pseudomonads is discussed. Only a few of the species tested were able to utilize acyclic isoprenoids. Two species which utilize C10 acyclic isoprenoids, P. aeruginosa and P. mendocina, were shown to contain the inducible enzyme geranyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, one of the unique enzymes in the isoprenol degradative pathway known to occur in P. citronellolis. Of the species which utilized geranitol, none showed definite growth on the homologous C15 and C20 isoprenols."

The majority of the activity was mitochondrial. Activity with C16 substrate was enriched in the inner membrane fraction while the matrix showed enrichment of activity with C4 substrate. Gel-filtration in the presence of nonionic and ionic detergents separated two peaks of activity with C16 substrate from liver, heart, kidney and brown adipose tissue mitochondria. The highest molecular weight activity was associated with membrane fragments and accounted for 18-32% of the total activity with C16 substrate. This enzyme showed preference for long-chain substrate, the C16/C4 activity ratio being 6-15 for the different mitochondria studied. The other enzyme had a molecular weight of 71 000 and showed highest activity with C4 substrate (C16/C4 activity ratio of 0.2). The substrate specificity of the membrane-associated enzyme was not altered by extraction with detergent or lipid solvents. The membrane-associated enzyme could be partially purified by treatment with high concentrations of KCl and EDTA, when it showed a molecular weight of 186 000 while retaining its high C16/C4 activity ratio. Protease treatment caused loss of C4 activity from the high-molecular-weight enzyme without affecting its C16 activity. We conclude that an inner membrane-associated, long-chain-specific 3-ketoacyl-CoA dehydrogenase coexists in mitochondria with the better-documented matrix enzyme which shows preference for shorter-chain-length substrates."

Feeding with D-[1-13C]ribose did not result in 13C enrichment of 2'-deoxymugineic acid, while D-[2-13C]ribose resulted in 13C enrichment at the C-4"", -1, -4' positions, and D-[5-13C]ribose did in C-1', -4, and -1"" positions of 2'-deoxymugineic acid, respectively. Furthermore, two isotope-labeled intermediates of the methionine recycling pathway, 5-[5-2H2]methylthioribose and 2-[1-13C]keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid, were synthesized, and their incorporation into 2'-deoxymugineic acids was investigated. Six deuterium atoms at the C-4, -1', and -1"" positions of 2'-deoxymugineic acid were observed after feeding with 5-[5-2H2]methylthioribose. Feeding with 2-[1-13C]keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid yielded 2'-deoxymugineic acid enriched with 13C at the C-4', -1, and -4"" positions. These results demonstrated for the first time that the biosynthesis of 2'-deoxymugineic acid is associated with the methionine recycling pathway.

7639721,The biosynthesis of threonine by mammalian cells: expression of a complete bacterial biosynthetic pathway in an animal cell.,10.1042/bj3090999,"The coding regions for the Escherichia coli gene for aspartokinase I/homoserine dehydrogenase I (thrA) and the Corynebacterium glutamicum gene for aspartic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd) have been subcloned into a Simian Virus 40 (SV40)-based mammalian expression vector. Both enzyme activities are expressed in mouse 3T3 cells after transfer of the corresponding chimaeric gene. The kinetic parameters are similar to those of the native bacterial enzymes, and aspartokinase I/homoserine dehydrogenase I retains its allosteric regulation by threonine. An extract of the cells expressing aspartokinase I/homoserine dehydrogenase I, mixed with one from cells expressing aspartic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, produced homoserine when the mixture was incubated with aspartic acid, ATP and NADPH. The thrA and asd expression cassettes were combined into a single plasmid which, when transfected into 3T3 cells, enabled them to produce homoserine from aspartic acid. Homoserine-producing 3T3 cells were transfected with the plasmid pSVthrB/C (homoserine kinase and threonine synthase) and selected for growth on homoserine. Cell lines isolated from these cells expressed the complete bacterial threonine pathway, were independent of threonine for growth and could be maintained in medium which contained no free threonine. The threonine in the proteins of these cells became enriched in 15N when the culture medium contained [15N]aspartic acid. The production of homoserine and the growth of cells was at a maximum when there was more than 2.5 mM aspartate in the medium. Below this concentration the high Km of aspartokinase limited the flux through the pathway. In the presence of additional aspartic acid the new pathway could sustain a cell cycle time close to that of the same cells cultured in threonine-containing medium."
7768806,Molecular and biochemical characterization of two meta-cleavage dioxygenases involved in biphenyl and m-xylene degradation by Beijerinckia sp. strain B1.,10.1128/jb.177.11.3095-3103.1995,"Beijerinckia sp. strain B1 is able to grow on either biphenyl or m-xylene as the sole source of carbon and is capable of cooxidizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The catabolic pathways for biphenyl and m-xylene degradation are coinduced and share common downstream enzymatic reactions. The catabolic pathway for biphenyl degradation involves two meta-cleavage steps, one for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl and a second for catechol. The catabolic pathway for m-xylene involves one m-cleavage step for 3-methylcatechol. The genes for two meta-cleavage dioxygenases were cloned from Beijerinckia sp. strain B1 on a single fragment of genomic DNA. The two genes are located approximately 5.5 kb away from one another. Expression of each gene separately in Escherichia coli and analysis of the meta-cleavage dioxygenase produced showed that one enzyme was more specific for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl while the second was more specific for catechol. The genes for the two meta-cleavage enzymes were thus labeled bphC and xylE for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, respectively. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by enzyme activity staining showed that the two meta-cleavage dioxygenases could be easily separated from each other. Similar analyses of Beijerinckia sp. strain B1 grown on succinate, biphenyl, or m-xylene indicate that both meta-cleavage enzymes are induced when cells are grown on either biphenyl or m-xylene. The nucleotide sequence was determined for both bphC and xylE. The two genes are transcribed in opposite directions, demonstrating that at least two operons must be involved in biphenyl degradation by Beijerinckia sp. strain B1. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (BphC) falls into the class of meta-cleavage dioxygenases acting on dihydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and is somewhat distinct from the main group of meta-cleavage dioxygenases acting on 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (XyIE) falls into the class of meta-cleavage enzymes acting on dihydroxylated monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but shows little similarity to the canonical TOL plasmid-encoded catechol 2,3-dioxygenase."

Linkages to chromosomes 11q (IDDM4) and 6q (IDDM5) were confirmed by replication, and chromosome 18 may encode a fifth disease locus. There are probably no genes with large effects aside from IDDM1.

This mutant, designated FA2, although resistant to the pilus-specific phage D3112 was sensitive to the pilus-specific phages B3 and F116L. In spite of the unusual phage sensitivity pattern, FA2 lacked the ability to produce functional polar pili (pil) and was incapable of twitching motility (twt). Genetic analysis revealed that the FA2 pil mutation, designated pilG1, mapped near the met-28 marker located at 20 min and was distinct from the previously described pilT mutation. This map location was confirmed by localization of a 6.2-kb EcoRI fragment that complemented FA2 on the SpeI and DpnI physical map of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome. A 700-bp region encompassing the pilG gene was sequenced, and a 405-bp open reading frame, with characteristic P. aeruginosa codon bias, was identified. The molecular weight of the protein predicted from the amino acid sequence of PilG, which was determined to be 14,717, corresponded very closely to that of a polypeptide with the apparent molecular weight of 15,000 detected after expression of pilG from the T7 promoter in Escherichia coli. Moreover, the predicted amino acid sequence of PilG showed significant homology to that of the enteric CheY protein, a single-domain response regulator. A chromosomal pilG insertion mutant, constructed by allele replacement of the wild-type gene, was not capable of pilus production or twitching motility but displayed normal flagellum-mediated motility. These results, therefore, suggest that PilG may be an important part of the signal transduction system involved in the elaboration of P. aeruginosa pili."

Nine open reading frames were identified and designated doxABDEFGHIJ. Collectively, we refer to these genes as the DOX pathway. At the nucleotide level, doxABD are identical to the ndoABC genes that encode naphthalene dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida. The DoxG protein is 97% identical to NahC (1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase) of P. putida. DoxE has 37% identity with cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. DoxF is similar to the aldehyde dehydrogenases of many organisms. The predicted DoxHIJ proteins have no obvious sequence similarities to known proteins. Gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector and mass spectroscopy confirmed that the DOX proteins convert naphthalene to salicylate and converting phenanthrene to 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. doxI mutants convert naphthalene to trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate, indicating that the DoxI protein is similar to NahE (trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase). Comparison of the DOX sequence with restriction maps of cloned naphthalene catabolic pathway (NAH) genes revealed many conserved restriction sites. The DOX gene arrangement is identical to that proposed for NAH, except that the NAH equivalent of doxH has not been recognized. DoxH may be involved in the conversion of 2-hydroxy-4-(2'-oxo-3,5-cyclohexadienyl)-buta-2,4-dienoat e to cis-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate. doxJ encodes an enzyme similar to NahD (isomerase). Our findings indicate that a single genetic pathway controls the metabolism of dibenzothiophene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene in strain C18 and that the DOX sequence encodes a complete upper naphthalene catabolic pathway similar to NAH."
8253757,"Structure of the N-linked oligosaccharides that show the complete loss of alpha-1,6-polymannose outer chain from och1, och1 mnn1, and och1 mnn1 alg3 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",,"The periplasmic invertase was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae och1::LEU2 disruptant cells (delta och1), which have a defect in elongation of the outer chain attached to the N-linked core oligosaccharides (Nakayama, K., Nagasu, T., Shimma, Y., Kuromatsu, J., and Jigami, Y. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 2511-2519). Structural analysis of the pyridylaminated (PA) neutral oligosaccharides released by hydrazinolysis and N-acetylation confirmed that the och1 mutation causes a complete loss of the alpha-1,6-polymannose outer chain, although the PA oligosaccharides (Man9GlcNAc2-PA and Man10GlcNAc2-PA), in which one or two alpha-1,3-linked mannose(s) attached to the endoplasmic reticulumn (ER)-form core oligosaccharide (Man8GlcNAc2) were also detected. Analysis of the delta och1 mnn1 strain oligosaccharides released from total cell mannoprotein revealed that the delta och1 mnn1 mutant eliminates the alpha-1,3-mannose attached to the core and accumulates predominantly a single ER-form oligosaccharide species (Man8GlcNAc2), suggesting a potential use of this strain as a host cell to produce glycoproteins containing mammalian high mannose type oligosaccharides. The delta och1 mnn1 alg3 mutants accumulated Man5GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 in total cell mannoprotein, confirming the lack of outer chain addition to the incomplete corelike oligosaccharide and the leaky phenotype of the alg3 mutation. All the results suggest that the OCH1 gene encodes an alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase that is functional in the initiation of alpha-1,6-polymannose outer chain addition to the N-linked core oligosaccharide (Man5GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2) in yeast."
8457204,The long-chain sphingoid base of sphingolipids is acylated at the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum in rat liver.,10.1042/bj2900751,"Ceramide, a key intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism, is synthesized by acylation of sphinganine followed by dehydrogenation of dihydroceramide to ceramide. Using radioactive sphinganine, we have examined the site and topology of dihydroceramide synthesis in well-characterized subcellular fractions from rat liver. [4,5-3H]Sphinganine was introduced as a complex with BSA and was metabolized to [4,5-3H]dihydroceramide upon incubation of rat liver homogenates or microsomes with fatty acyl CoA. Conditions were established in a detergent-free system in which dihydroceramide synthesis was not limited by either substrate availability or by amounts of microsomal protein or reaction time. The distribution of dihydroceramide synthesis was found to exactly parallel that of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker upon subfractionation of microsomes, and no endogenous activity was detected in either purified Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane fractions. Limited protease digestion demonstrated that sphinganine N-acyltransferase is localized at the cytosolic surface of intact ER-derived vesicles. These results are discussed with regard to the subsequent transport of (dihydro)-ceramide from the ER to sites of further metabolism in a pre-Golgi apparatus compartment and in the cis and medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus."
8550403,Molecular characterization of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate catabolic pathway of Escherichia coli W: engineering a mobile aromatic degradative cluster.,10.1128/jb.178.1.111-120.1996,"We have determined and analyzed the nucleic acid sequence of a 14,855-bp region that contains the complete gene cluster encoding the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA) degradative pathway of Escherichia coli W (ATCC 11105). This catabolic pathway is composed by 11 genes, i.e., 8 enzyme-encoding genes distributed in two putative operons, hpaBC (4-HPA hydroxylase operon) and hpaGEDFHI (meta-cleavage operon); 2 regulatory genes, hpaR and hpaA; and the gene, hpaX, that encodes a protein related to the superfamily of transmembrane facilitators and appears to be cotranscribed with hpaA. Although comparisons with other aromatic catabolic pathways revealed interesting similarities, some of the genes did not present any similarity to their corresponding counterparts in other pathways, suggesting different evolutionary origins. The cluster is flanked by two genes homologous to the estA (carbon starvation protein) and tsr (serine chemoreceptor) genes of E. coli K-12. A detailed genetic analysis of this region has provided a singular example of how E. coli becomes adapted to novel nutritional sources by the recruitment of a catabolic cassette. Furthermore, the presence of the pac gene in the proximity of the 4-HPA cluster suggests that the penicillin G acylase was a recent acquisition to improve the ability of E. coli W to metabolize a wider range of substrates, enhancing its catabolic versatility. Five repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences that might be involved in transcriptional regulation were found within the cluster. The complete 4-HPA cluster was cloned in plasmid and transposon cloning vectors that were used to engineer E. coli K-12 strains able to grow on 4-HPA. We report here also the in vitro design of new biodegradative capabilities through the construction of a transposable cassette containing the wide substrate range 4-HPA hydroxylase, in order to expand the ortho-cleavage pathway of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and allow the new recombinant strain to use phenol as the only carbon source."
8610175,Crystal structures of the trimeric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix protein: implications for membrane association and assembly.,10.1073/pnas.93.7.3099,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) matrix protein forms a structural shell associated with the inner viral membrane and performs other essential functions throughout the viral life cycle. The crystal structure of the HIV-1 matrix protein, determined at 2.3 angstrom resolution, reveals that individual matrix molecules are composed of five major helices capped by a three-stranded mixed beta-sheet. Unexpectedly, the protein assembles into a trimer in three different crystal lattices, burying 1880 angstrom2 of accessible surface area at the trimer interfaces. Trimerization appears to create a large, bipartite membrane binding surface in which exposed basic residues could cooperate with the N-terminal myristoyl groups to anchor the protein on the acidic inner membrane of the virus."
8631713,p-Cumate catabolic pathway in Pseudomonas putida Fl: cloning and characterization of DNA carrying the cmt operon.,10.1128/jb.178.5.1351-1362.1996,"Pseudomonas putida F1 utilizes p-cumate (p-isopropylbenzoate) as a growth substrate by means of an eight-step catabolic pathway. A 35.75-kb DNA segment, within which the cmt operon encoding the catabolism of p-cumate is located, was cloned as four separate overlapping restriction fragments and mapped with restriction endonucleases. By examining enzyme activities in recombinant bacteria carrying these fragments and sub-cloned fragments, genes encoding most of the enzymes of the p-cumate pathway were located. Subsequent sequence analysis of 11,260 bp gave precise locations of the 12 genes of the cmt operon. The first three genes, cmtAaAbAc, and the sixth gene, cmtAd, encode the components of p-cumate 2,3-dioxygenase (ferredoxin reductase, large subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, small subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, and ferredoxin, respectively); these genes are separated by cmtC, which encodes 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate 3,4-dioxygenase, and cmtB, coding for 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate dehydrogenase. The ring cleavage product, 2-hydroxy-3-carboxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate, is acted on by a decarboxylase encoded by the seventh gene, cmtD, which is followed by a large open reading frame, cmtI, of unknown function. The next four genes, cmtEFHG, encode 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate hydrolase, 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, which transform the decarboxylation product to amphibolic intermediates. The deduced amino acid sequences of all the cmt gene products except CmtD and CmtI have a recognizable but low level of identity with amino acid sequences of enzymes catalyzing analogous reactions in other catabolic pathways. This identity is highest for the last two enzymes of the pathway (4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase [acylating]), which have identities of 66 to 77% with the corresponding enzymes from other aromatic meta-cleavage pathways. Recombinant bacteria carrying certain restriction fragments bordering the cmt operon were found to transform indole to indigo. This reaction, known to be catalyzed by toluene 2,3-dioxygenase, led to the discovery that the tod operon, encoding the catabolism of toluene, is located 2.8 kb downstream from and in the same orientation as the cmt operon in P. putida F1."
8662716,Purification and characterization of two isoenzymes of DL-glycerol-3-phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Identification of the corresponding GPP1 and GPP2 genes and evidence for osmotic regulation of Gpp2p expression by the osmosensing mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway.,10.1074/jbc.271.23.13875,"The existence of specific dl-glycerol-3-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.21) activity in extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was confirmed by examining strains lacking nonspecific acid and alkaline phosphatase activities. During purification of the glycerol-3-phosphatase, two isozymes having very similar molecular weights were isolated by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography. By microsequencing of trypsin-generated peptides the corresponding genes were identified as previously sequenced open reading frames of unknown function. The two genes, GPP1 (YIL053W) and GPP2 (YER062C) encode proteins that show 95% amino acid identity and have molecular masses of 30.4 and 27.8 kDa, respectively. The intracellular concentration of Gpp2p increases in cells subjected to osmotic stress, while the production of Gpp1p is unaffected by changes of external osmolarity. Both isoforms have a high specificity for dl-glycerol-3-phosphate, pH optima at 6.5, and KmG3P in the range of 3-4 mM. The osmotic induction of Gpp2p is blocked in cells that are defective in the HOG-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, indicating that GPP2 is a target gene for this osmosensing signal transduction pathway. Together with DOG1 and DOG2, encoding two highly homologous enzymes that dephosphorylate 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate, GPP1 and GPP2 constitute a new family of genes for low molecular weight phosphatases."

The n-alkane dehydrogenase (fraction R-3), obtained as a single peak from Bio-Gel P-60, showed an overall 135-fold purification and was demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography to convert n-decane to 1-decene. The alkene hydroxylase activity in the S-3 fraction, purified 167 times from diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, was shown by the same methodology to convert decene to decanol. Commercial ferredoxin has been shown to increase the alkane dehydrogenase activity. An NAD-, flavine adenine dinucleotide-, and iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase was demonstrated in the R-3 fraction. A mechanism for the anaerobic conversion of n-alkane to fatty acid has been proposed."
8782397,Characteristics of transposon insertion mutants of mandelic acid-utilizing Pseudomonas putida strain A10L.,10.1271/bbb.60.1051,"A soil isolate, Pseudomonas putida strain A10L that utilizes mandelate via the mandelate pathway was mutagenized by transposon Tn5-Mob insertion and mutant 168 lacking mandelate racemase (MR) and a mutant 254 lacking benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFDC) were obtained. Expression of (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase (MDH), BFDC, NAD(+)-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (BDH) and NADP(+)-dependent BDH in the MR-lacking mutant was not affected by the insertion, and it was inducible similarly to the wild type strain. On the other hand, expression of MR and MDH in the BFDC-lacking mutant was low and constitutive, and NAD(+)- and NADP(+)-dependent BDHs were produced at a rather high level under non-induced conditions by the mutant. Genes for MR (mdlA), MDH (mdlB), and BFDC (mdlC) were indicated to be organized in an operon in the order of mdlCBA. Optical resolution to obtain (R)-mandelate, a useful synthon for pharmaceuticals, was shown to be performed with the MR-lacking mutant."

Strain T-2 utilizes p-toluenesulfonate as a source of carbon and energy for growth via p-sulfobenzoate and protocatechuate, and p-toluenecarboxylate via terephthalate and protocatechuate, and has the unusual property of requiring the reductase (TsaB) of the toluenesulfonate methyl monooxygenase system (TsaMB) in an incompletely expressed sulfobenzoate dioxygenase system (PsbAC) [Schläfli Oppenberg, H.R., Chen, G., Leisinger, T. & Cook, A. M. (1995). Microbiology 141, 1891-1899]. The independently isolated C. testosteroni PSB-4 utilized only sulfobenzoate and terephthalate via protocatechuate. Mutant TER-1, derived from strain T-2, utilized only terephthalate via protocatechuate. We detected no enzymes of the pathway from toluenesulfonate to sulfobenzoate in strains PSB-4 and TER-1, and confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis that the genes (tsaMB) encoding toluenesulfonate monooxygenase were absent. We concluded that, in strain PSB-4, the regulatory unit encoding the genes for the conversion of toluenesulfonate to sulfobenzoate was missing, and that generation of mutant TER-1 involved deletion of this regulatory unit and of the regulatory unit encoding desulfonation of sulfobenzoate. The degradation of sulfobenzoate in strain PSB-4 was catalysed by a fully inducible sulfobenzoate dioxygenase system (PsbACPSB-4), which, after purification of the oxygenase component (PsbAPSB-4), turned out to be indistinguishable from the corresponding component from strain T-2 (PsbAT-2). Reductase PsbCPSB-4, which we could separate but not purify, was active with oxygenase PsbAPSB-4 and PsbAT-2. Oxygenase PsbAPSB-4 was shown by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to contain a Rieske [2Fe-2S] centre. The enzyme system oxygenating terephthalate was examined and the oxygenase component purified and characterized. The oxygenase component in strains T-2 (and mutant TER-1) and PSB-4 were indistinguishable. The reductase component, which we separated but failed to purify, was active with the oxygenase from all strains. Gains and losses of blocks of genes in evolution is discussed."
8939432,Molecular characterization of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O5 (PAO1) B-band lipopolysaccharide gene cluster.,10.1046/j.1365-2958.1996.1351503.x,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa co-expresses A-band lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a homopolymer of rhamnose, and B-band LPS, a heteropolymer with a repeating unit of 2-5 sugars which is the serotype-specific antigen. The gene clusters for A- and B-band biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa O5 (strain PAO1) have been cloned previously. Here we report the DNA sequence and molecular analysis of the B-band O-antigen biosynthetic cluster. Sixteen open reading frames (ORFs) thought to be involved in synthesis of the O5 O antigen were identified, including wzz (rol), wzy (rfc), and wbpA-wbpN. A further 3 ORFs not thought to be involved with LPS synthesis were identified (hisH, hisF, and uvrB). Most of the wbp genes are found only in serotypes O2, O5, O16, O18, and O20, which form a chemically and structurally related O-antigen serogroup. In contrast, wbpM and wbpN are common to all 20 serotypes of P. aeruginosa. Although wbpM is not serogroup-specific, knockout mutations confirmed it is necessary for O5 O-antigen biosynthesis. A novel insertion sequences, IS 1209, is present at the junction between the serogroup-specific and non-specific regions. We have predicted the functions of the proteins encoded in the wbp cluster based on their homologies to those in the databases, and provide a proposed pathway of P. aeruginosa O5 O-antigen biosynthesis."
8981984,"Trichloroethylene oxidation by purified toluene 2-monooxygenase: products, kinetics, and turnover-dependent inactivation.",10.1128/jb.179.1.90-96.1997,"Trichloroethylene is oxidized by several types of nonspecific bacterial oxygenases. Toluene 2-monooxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia G4 is implicated in trichloroethylene oxidation and is uniquely suggested to be resistant to turnover-dependent inactivation in vivo. In this work, the oxidation of trichloroethylene was studied with purified toluene 2-monooxygenase. All three purified toluene 2-monooxygenase protein components and NADH were required to reconstitute full trichloroethylene oxidation activity in vitro. The apparent Km and Vmax were 12 microM and 37 nmol per min per mg of hydroxylase component, respectively. Ten percent of the full activity was obtained when the small-molecular-weight enzyme component was omitted. The stable oxidation products, accounting for 84% of the trichloroethylene oxidized, were carbon monoxide, formic acid, glyoxylic acid, and covalently modified oxygenase proteins that constituted 12% of the reacted [14C]trichloroethylene. The stable oxidation products may all derive from the unstable intermediate trichloroethylene epoxide that was trapped by reaction with 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine. Chloral hydrate and dichloroacetic acid were not detected. This finding differs from that with soluble methane monooxygenase and cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase, which produce chloral hydrate. Trichloroethylene-dependent inactivation of toluene 2-monooxygenase activity was observed. All of the protein components were covalently modified during the oxidation of trichloroethylene. The addition of cysteine to reaction mixtures partially protected the enzyme system against inactivation, most notably protecting the NADH-oxidoreductase component. This suggested the participation of diffusible intermediates in the inactivation of the oxidoreductase."
8981987,2-Naphthoate catabolic pathway in Burkholderia strain JT 1500.,10.1128/jb.179.1.115-121.1997,"Burkholderia strain (JT 1500), able to use 2-naphthoate as the sole source of carbon, was isolated from soil. On the basis of growth characteristics, oxygen uptake experiments, enzyme assays, and detection of intermediates, a degradation pathway of 2-naphthoate is proposed. The features of this pathway are convergent with those for phenanthrene. We propose a pathway for the conversion of 2-naphthoate to 1 mol (each) of pyruvate, succinate, and acetyl coenzyme A and 2 mol of CO2. During growth in the presence of 2-naphthoate, six metabolites were detected by thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and spectroscopy. 1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate accumulated in the culture broth during growth on 2-naphthoate. Also, the formation of 2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate, phthalaldehydate, phthalate, protocatechuate, and beta-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid was demonstrated. (1R,2S)-cis-1,2-Dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate was thus considered an intermediate between 2-naphthoate and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, but it was not transformed by whole cells or their extracts. We conclude that this diol is not responsible for the formation of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate from 2-naphthoate but that one of the other three diastereomers is not eliminated as a potential intermediate for a dehydration reaction."
8995384,"Lipid dependence and basic kinetics of the purified 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase from membranes of Acholeplasma laidlawii.",10.1074/jbc.272.2.929,"UDP-glucose: 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.157), catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to diacylglycerol (DAG) to yield monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) and UDP. MGlcDAG is the first glucolipid along the glucolipid pathway, and a major (nonbilayer-prone) lipid in the single membrane of Acholeplasma laidlawii. MGlcDAG is further glucosylated to give the major diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGlc-DAG). The bilayer fractions of these lipids are crucial for the metabolic maintenance of phase equilibria close to a potential bilayer-nonbilayer transition and a nearly constant spontaneous curvature. The glucolipid syntheses are also balanced against the phosphatidylglycerol pathway, competing for the common minor precursor phosphatidic acid, to retain a constant lipid surface charge density. The 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase was purified to homogeneity from detergent-solubilized A. laidlawii cells by three column chromatography methods (enrichment approximately 9000 x), and identified as a minor 40-kDa protein by using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In CHAPS detergent, mixed micelles, a cooperative dependence on anionic lipids for activity was confirmed. Dependence of the enzyme on UDP-glucose followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics while the other hydrophobic substrate dioleoylglycerol stimulated the enzyme by an activating, potentially cooperative mechanism. Physiological concentrations of the activator lipid dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol influenced the turnover number of the enzyme but not the interaction with UDP-glucose, as inferred from variable and constant values of the apparent Vmax and Km, respectively. Dipalmitoylglycerol was a better substrate than the oleoyl species, supporting earlier in vivo and crude enzyme data. The responses of the purified 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase indicated that (i) the regulatory features of the MGlcDAG synthesis is held by the catalytic enzyme itself, and (ii) this strongly corroborates the ""homeostasis"" model for lipid bilayer properties in A. laidlawii proposed earlier."
9006050,Characterization of the p-toluenesulfonate operon tsaMBCD and tsaR in Comamonas testosteroni T-2.,10.1128/jb.179.3.919-927.1997,"Comamonas testosteroni T-2 uses a standard, if seldom examined, attack on an aromatic compound and oxygenates the side chain of p-toluenesulfonate (TS) (or p-toluenecarboxylate) to p-sulfobenzoate (or terephthalate) prior to complete oxidation. The expression of the first three catabolic enzymes in the pathway, the TS methyl-monooxygenase system (comprising reductase B and oxygenase M; TsaMB), p-sulfobenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (TsaC), and p-sulfobenzaldehyde dehydrogenase (TsaD), is coregulated as regulatory unit R1 (H. R. Schlafli Oppenberg, G. Chen, T. Leisinger, and A. M. Cook, Microbiology [Reading] 141:1891-1899, 1995). The components of the oxygenase system were repurified, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences were confirmed and extended. An internal sequence of TsaM was obtained, and the identity of the [2Fe-2S] Rieske center was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. We purified both dehydrogenases (TsaC and TsaD) and determined their molecular weights and N-terminal amino acid sequences. Oligonucleotides derived from the partial sequences of TsaM were used to identify cloned DNA from strain T-2, and about 6 kb of contiguous cloned DNA was sequenced. Regulatory unit R1 was presumed to represent a four-gene operon (tsaMBCD) which was regulated by the LysR-type regulator, TsaR, encoded by a deduced one-gene transcriptional unit. The genes for the inducible TS transport system were not at this locus. The oxygenase system was confirmed to be a class IA mononuclear iron oxygenase, and class IA can now be seen to have two evolutionary groups, the monooxygenases and the dioxygenases, though the divergence is limited to the oxygenase components. The alcohol dehydrogenase TsaC was confirmed to belong to the short-chain, zinc-independent dehydrogenases, and the aldehyde dehydrogenase TsaD was found to resemble several other aldehyde dehydrogenases. The operon and its putative regulator are compared with units of the TOL plasmid."
9098055,Genetic characterization and expression in heterologous hosts of the 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate catabolic pathway of Escherichia coli K-12.,10.1128/jb.179.8.2573-2581.1997,"We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene cluster encoding the 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate (3-HPP) catabolic pathway of Escherichia coli K-12. Sequence analysis revealed the existence of eight genes that map at min 8 of the chromosome, between the lac and hemB regions. Six enzyme-encoding genes account for a flavin-type monooxygenase (mhpA), the extradiol dioxygenase (mhpB), and the meta-cleavage pathway (mhpCDFE). The order of these catabolic genes, with the sole exception of mhpF, parallels that of the enzymatic steps of the pathway. The mhpF gene may encode the terminal acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) not reported previously in the proposed pathway. Enzymes that catalyze the early reactions of the pathway, MhpA and MhpB, showed the lowest level of sequence similarity to analogous enzymes of other aromatic catabolic pathways. However, the genes mhpCDFE present the same organization and appear to be homologous to the Pseudomonas xyl, dmp, and nah meta-pathway genes, supporting the hypothesis of the modular evolution of catabolic pathways and becoming the first example of this type of catabolic module outside the genus Pseudomonas. Two bacterial interspersed mosaic elements were found downstream of the mhpABCDFE locus and flank a gene, orfT, which encodes a protein related to the superfamily of transmembrane facilitators that might be associated with transport. All of the genes of the 3-HPP cluster are transcribed in the same direction, with the sole exception of mhpR. Inducible expression of the mhp catabolic genes depends upon the presence, in the cis or trans position, of a functional mhpR gene, which suggests that the mhpR gene product is the activator of the 3-HPP biodegradative pathway. The primary structure of MhpR revealed significant similarities to that of members of the IclR subfamily of transcriptional regulators. A 3-HPP catabolic DNA cassette was engineered and shown to be functional not only in enteric bacteria (E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium) but also in Pseudomonas putida and Rhizobium meliloti, thus facilitating its potential application to improve the catabolic abilities of bacterial strains for degradation of aromatic compounds."

The enzymes in this pathway that have been purified and characterized to any extent have either been shown to be stabilized by mixed phospholipid/detergent micelles, or else require a lipid matrix for catalytic activity. Further understanding of the mechanisms of these essential enzymes may require developing methods for the reconstitution of the glycosyltransferases and their hydrophobic substrates in appropriate lipid matrices."

The cym operon, encoding the conversion of p-cymene to p-cumate, is located just upstream of the cmt operon, which encodes the further catabolism of p-cumate and is located, in turn, upstream of the tod (toluene catabolism) operon in P. putida F1. The sequences of an 11,236-bp DNA segment carrying the cym operon and a 915-bp DNA segment completing the sequence of the 2,673-bp DNA segment separating the cmt and tod operons have been determined and are discussed here. The cym operon contains six genes in the order cymBCAaAbDE. The gene products have been identified both by functional assays and by comparing deduced amino acid sequences to published sequences. Thus, cymAa and cymAb encode the two components of p-cymene monooxygenase, a hydroxylase and a reductase, respectively; cymB encodes p-cumic alcohol dehydrogenase; cymC encodes p-cumic aldehyde dehydrogenase; cymD encodes a putative outer membrane protein related to gene products of other aromatic hydrocarbon catabolic operons, but having an unknown function in p-cymene catabolism; and cymE encodes an acetyl coenzyme A synthetase whose role in this pathway is also unknown. Upstream of the cym operon is a regulatory gene, cymR. By using recombinant bacteria carrying either the operator-promoter region of the cym operon or the cmt operon upstream of genes encoding readily assayed enzymes, in the presence or absence of cymR, it was demonstrated that cymR encodes a repressor which controls expression of both the cym and cmt operons and is inducible by p-cumate but not p-cymene.

9172332,Four genes from Pseudomonas fluorescens that encode the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin.,10.1128/aem.63.6.2147-2154.1997,"Pyrrolnitrin is a secondary metabolite of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia sp. strains with strong antifungal activity. Production of pyrrolnitrin has been correlated with the ability of some bacteria to control plant diseases caused by fungal pathogens, including the damping-off pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Pseudomonas fluorescens BL915 has been reported to produce pyrrolnitrin and to be an effective biocontrol agent for this pathogen. We have isolated a 32-kb genomic DNA fragment from this strain that contains genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin. Marker-exchange mutagenesis of this DNA with Tn5 revealed the presence of a 6.2-kb region that contains genes required for the synthesis of pyrrolnitrin. The nucleotide sequence of the 6.2-kb region was determined and found to contain a cluster of four genes that are required for the production of pyrrolnitrin. Deletion mutations in any of the four genes resulted in a pyrrolnitrin-nonproducing phenotype. The putative coding sequences of the four individual genes were cloned by PCR and fused to the tac promoter from Escherichia coli. In each case, the appropriate tac promoter-pyrrolnitrin gene fusion was shown to complement the pyrrolnitrin-negative phenotype of the corresponding deletion mutant. Transfer of the four gene cluster to E. coli resulted in the production of pyrrolnitrin by this organism, thereby demonstrating that the four genes are sufficient for the production of this metabolite and represent all of the genes required to encode the pathway for pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis."
9218445,"MNN6, a member of the KRE2/MNT1 family, is the gene for mannosylphosphate transfer in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",10.1074/jbc.272.29.18117,"In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the N-linked sugar chain is modified at different positions by the addition of mannosylphosphate. The mnn6 mutant is deficient in the mannosylphosphate transferase activity toward mannotetraose (Karson, E. M., and Ballou, C. E. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6484-6492). We have cloned the MNN6 gene by complementation. It has encoded a 446-amino acid polypeptide with the characteristics of type II membrane protein. The deduced Mnn6p showed a significant similarity to Kre2p/Mnt1p, a Golgi alpha-1, 2-mannosyltransferase involved in O-glycosylation. The null mutant of MNN6 showed a normal cell growth, less binding to Alcian blue, hypersensitivity to Calcoflour White and hygromycin B, and diminished mannosylphosphate transferase activity toward the endoplasmic reticulum core oligosaccharide acceptors (Man8GlcNAc2-PA and Man5GlcNAc2-PA) in vitro, suggesting the involvement of the MNN6 gene in the endoplasmic reticulum core oligosaccharide phosphorylation. However, no differences were observed in N-linked mannoprotein oligosaccharides between Deltaoch1 Deltamnn1 cells and Deltaoch1Deltamnn1Deltamnn6 cells, indicating the existence of redundant genes required for the core oligosaccharide phosphorylation. Based on a dramatic decrease in polymannose outer chain phosphorylation by MNN6 gene disruption and a determination of the mannosylphosphorylation site in the acceptor, it is postulated that the MNN6 gene may be a structural gene encoding a mannosylphosphate transferase, which recognizes any oligosaccharides with at least one alpha-1,2-linked mannobiose unit."
9235894,Analysis of a chemical plant defense mechanism in grasses.,10.1126/science.277.5326.696,"In the Gramineae, the cyclic hydroxamic acids 2,4-dihydroxy-1, 4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIBOA) and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1, 4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA) form part of the defense against insects and microbial pathogens. Five genes, Bx1 through Bx5, are required for DIBOA biosynthesis in maize. The functions of these five genes, clustered on chromosome 4, were demonstrated in vitro. Bx1 encodes a tryptophan synthase alpha homolog that catalyzes the formation of indole for the production of secondary metabolites rather than tryptophan, thereby defining the branch point from primary to secondary metabolism. Bx2 through Bx5 encode cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases that catalyze four consecutive hydroxylations and one ring expansion to form the highly oxidized DIBOA."
9238101,"Identification of stsC, the gene encoding the L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase from streptomycin-producing Streptomycetes.",10.1007/s002030050475,"Eight new genes, strO-stsABCDEFG, were identified by sequencing DNA in the gene cluster that encodes proteins for streptomycin production of Streptomyces griseus N2-3-11. The StsA (calculated molecular mass 43.5 kDa) and StsC (45.5 kDa) proteins - together with another gene product, StrS (39.8 kDa), encoded in another operon of the same gene cluster - show significant sequence identity and are members of a new class of pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferases that have been observed mainly in the biosynthetic pathways for secondary metabolites. The aminotransferase activity was demonstrated for the first time by identification of the overproduced and purified StsC protein as the L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase, which catalyzes the first amino transfer in the biosynthesis of the streptidine subunit of streptomycin. The stsC and stsA genes each hybridized specifically to distinct fragments in the genomic DNA of most actinomycetes tested that produce diaminocyclitolaminoglycosides. In contrast, only stsC, but not stsA, hybridized to the DNA of Streptomyces hygroscopicus ssp. glebosus, which produces the monoaminocyclitol antibiotic bluensomycin; this suggests that both genes are specifically used in the first and second steps of the cyclitol transamination reactions. Sequence comparison studies performed with the deduced polypeptides of the genes adjacent to stsC suggest that the enzymes encoded by some of these genes [strO (putative phosphatase gene), stsB (putative oxidoreductase gene), and stsE (putative phosphotransferase gene)] also could be involved in (di-)aminocyclitol synthesis."
9244273,Cloning of genes involved in carbazole degradation of Pseudomonas sp. strain CA10: nucleotide sequences of genes and characterization of meta-cleavage enzymes and hydrolase.,10.1128/jb.179.15.4841-4849.1997,"The DNA fragment encoding meta-cleavage enzymes and the meta-cleavage compound hydrolase, involved in carbazole degradation, was cloned from the carbazole-utilizing bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain CA10. DNA sequence analysis of this 2.6-kb SmaI-SphI fragment revealed that there were three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3, in this gene order). ORF1 and ORF2 were indispensable for meta-cleavage activity for 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol and its easily available analog, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, and were designated carBa and carBb, respectively. The alignment of CarBb with other meta-cleavage enzymes indicated that CarBb may have a non-heme iron cofactor coordinating site. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree, CarBb was classified as a member of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase family. This unique extradiol dioxygenase, CarB, had significantly higher affinity and about 20-times-higher meta-cleavage activity for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl than for catechol derivatives. The putative polypeptide encoded by ORF3 was homologous with meta-cleavage compound hydrolases in other bacteria, and ORF3 was designated carC. The hydrolase activity of CarC for 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid, the meta-cleavage compound of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, was 40 times higher than that for 2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoic acid, the meta-cleavage compound of 3-methylcatechol. Alignment analysis and the phylogenetic tree indicate that CarC has greatest homologies with hydrolases involved in the monoaromatic compound degradation pathway. These results suggest the possibility that CarC is a novel type of hydrolase."

They represent the major quantitative pathway by which cholesterol is metabolized in the body. This article covers the microbial and enzymatic transformations of free, saturated bile acids, that kept unaltered the C-24 cyclopentane-perhydrophenantrene nucleus. The bile acids that have been considered include the primary cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, the secondary deoxycholic and lithocholic acids as well as the relevant dehydrocholic, ursocholic and ursodeoxycholic acids. Among the bile acid biotransformations, attention is paid to reactions that lead to pharmaceutically significant compounds. This is the case of 7 alpha-hydroxy epimerization of chenodeoxycholic acid to ursodeoxycholic acid, currently used for cholesterol galistone dissolution therapy and in the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. Emphasis has placed on reporting reactions that may be of general interest and on the practical aspects of work in the field of biotransformations."
9303382,Streptogramin B biosynthesis in Streptomyces pristinaespiralis and Streptomyces virginiae: molecular characterization of the last structural peptide synthetase gene.,10.1128/AAC.41.9.1904,"Streptomyces pristinaespiralis and S. virginiae both produce closely related hexadepsipeptide antibiotics of the streptogramin B family. Pristinamycins I and virginiamycins S differ only in the fifth incorporated precursor, di(mono)methylated amine and phenylalanine, respectively. By using degenerate oligonucleotide probes derived from internal sequences of the purified S. pristinaespiralis SnbD and SnbE proteins, the genes from two streptogramin B producers, S. pristinaespiralis and S. virginiae, encoding the peptide synthetase involved in the activation and incorporation of the last four precursors (proline, 4-dimethylparaaminophenylalanine [for pristinamycin I(A)] or phenylalanine [for virginiamycin S], pipecolic acid, and phenylglycine) were cloned. Analysis of the sequence revealed that SnbD and SnbE are encoded by a unique snbDE gene. SnbDE (4,849 amino acids [aa]) contains four amino acid activation domains, four condensation domains, an N-methylation domain, and a C-terminal thioesterase domain. Comparison of the sequences of 55 amino acid-activating modules from different origins confirmed that these sequences contain enough information for the performance of legitimate predictions of their substrate specificity. Partial sequencing (1,993 aa) of the SnbDE protein of S. virginiae allowed comparison of the proline and aromatic acid activation domains of the two species and the identification of coupled frameshift mutations."
9371445,General secretion pathway (eps) genes required for toxin secretion and outer membrane biogenesis in Vibrio cholerae.,10.1128/jb.179.22.6994-7003.1997,"The general secretion pathway (GSP) of Vibrio cholerae is required for secretion of proteins including chitinase, enterotoxin, and protease through the outer membrane. In this study, we report the cloning and sequencing of a DNA fragment from V. cholerae, containing 12 open reading frames, epsC to -N, which are similar to GSP genes of Aeromonas, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Xanthomonas spp. In addition to the two previously described genes, epsE and epsM (M. Sandkvist, V. Morales, and M. Bagdasarian, Gene 123: 81-86, 1993; L. J. Overbye, M. Sandkvist, and M. Bagdasarian, Gene 132:101-106, 1993), it is shown here that epsC, epsF, epsG, and epsL also encode proteins essential for GSP function. Mutations in the eps genes result in aberrant outer membrane protein profiles, which indicates that the GSP, or at least some of its components, is required not only for secretion of soluble proteins but also for proper outer membrane assembly. Several of the Eps proteins have been identified by use of the T7 polymerase-promoter system in Escherichia coli. One of them, a pilin-like protein, EpsG, was analyzed also in V. cholerae and found to migrate as two bands on polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that in this organism it might be processed or otherwise modified by a prepilin peptidase. We believe that TcpJ prepilin peptidase, which processes the subunit of the toxin-coregulated pilus, TcpA, is not involved in this event. This is supported by the observations that apparent processing of EpsG occurs in a tcpJ mutant of V. cholerae and that, when coexpressed in E. coli, TcpJ cannot process EpsG although the PilD peptidase from Neisseria gonorrhoeae can."

This acyclic olefin is found in the essential oil of peppermint (Mentha x piperita) and can be synthesized from farnesyl diphosphate by a cell-free extract of peppermint secretory gland cells. A cDNA from peppermint encoding (E)-beta-farnesene synthase was cloned by random sequencing of an oil gland library and was expressed in Escherichia coli. The corresponding synthase has a deduced size of 63.8 kDa and requires a divalent cation for catalysis (Km for Mg2+ approximately 150 microM; Km for Mn2+ approximately 7 microM). The sesquiterpenoids produced by the recombinant enzyme, as determined by radio-GC and GC-MS, are (E)-beta-farnesene (85%), (Z)-beta-farnesene (8%), and delta-cadinene (5%) with the native C15 substrate farnesyl diphosphate (Km approximately 0.6 microM; Vrel = 100) and Mg2+ as cofactor, and (E)-beta-farnesene (98%) and (Z)-beta-farnesene (2%) with Mn2+ as cofactor (Vrel = 80). With the C10 analog, GDP, as substrate (Km = 1.5 microM; Vrel = 3 with Mg2+ as cofactor), the monoterpenes limonene (48%), terpinolene (15%), and myrcene (15%) are produced."

Comparison of constitutive and wound-induced activities, and cDNA isolation, characterization, and bacterial expression of delta-selinene synthase and gamma-humulene synthase.",10.1074/jbc.273.4.2078,"Grand fir (Abies grandis) has been developed as a model system for the study of oleoresin production in response to stem wounding and insect attack. The turpentine fraction of the oleoresin was shown to contain at least 38 sesquiterpenes that represent 12.5% of the turpentine, with the monoterpenes comprising the remainder. Assays of cell-free extracts from grand fir stem with farnesyl diphosphate as substrate indicated that the constitutive sesquiterpene synthases produced the same sesquiterpenes found in the oleoresin and that, in response to wounding, only two new products were synthesized, delta-cadinene and (E)-alpha-bisabolene. A similarity based cloning strategy yielded two new cDNA species from a stem cDNA library that, when expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene products subsequently assayed, yielded a remarkable number of sesquiterpene products. The encoded enzymes have been named delta-selinene synthase and gamma-humulene synthase based on the principal products formed; however, each enzyme synthesizes three major products and produces 34 and 52 total sesquiterpenes, respectively, thereby accounting for many of the sesquiterpenes of the oleoresin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the delta-selinene synthase cDNA open reading frame encodes a protein of 581 residues (at 67.6 kDa), whereas that of the gamma-humulene synthase cDNA encodes a protein of 593 residues (at 67.9 kDa). The two amino acid sequences are 83% similar and 65% identical to each other and range in similarity from 65 to 67% and in identity from 43 to 46% when compared with the known sequences of monoterpene and diterpene synthases from grand fir. Although the two sesquiterpene synthases from this gymnosperm do not very closely resemble terpene synthases from angiosperm species (52-56% similarity and 26-30% identity, there are clustered regions of significant apparent homology between the enzymes of these two plant classes. The multi-step, multi-product reactions catalyzed by the sesquiterpene synthases from grand fir are among the most complex of any terpenoid cyclase thus far described."

These antibodies bind to and activate the receptor, causing the autonomous production of thyroid hormones. Despite recent improvements in our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of autoimmunity, our currently available treatments for Graves' disease have remained largely unchanged over the last 50 years. Nevertheless, new concepts in immune system regulation hold out the prospect in the future for intervention designed to modify, and possibly cure, the underlying disease process."
9535909,Regulation of connexin-43 gap junctional intercellular communication by mitogen-activated protein kinase.,10.1074/jbc.273.15.9188,"Activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascade is initiated by activation of growth factor receptors and regulates many cellular events, including cell cycle control. Our previous studies suggested that the connexin-43 gap junction protein may be a target of activated MAP kinase and that MAP kinase may regulate connexin-43 function. We identified the sites of MAP kinase phosphorylation in in vitro studies as the consensus MAP kinase recognition sites in the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of connexin-43, Ser255, Ser279, and Ser282. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of MAP kinase by ligand-induced activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) or lysophosphatidic acid receptors or by pervanadate-induced inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases results in increased phosphorylation on connexin-43. EGF and lysophosphatidic acid-induced phosphorylation on connexin-43 and the down-regulation of gap junctional communication in EGF-treated cells were blocked by a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (PD98059) that prevented activation of MAP kinase. These studies confirm that connexin-43 is a MAP kinase substrate in vivo and that phosphorylation on Ser255, Ser279, and/or Ser282 initiates the down-regulation of gap junctional communication. Studies with connexin-43 mutants suggest that MAP kinase phosphorylation at one or more of the tandem Ser279/Ser282 sites is sufficient to disrupt gap junctional intercellular communication."

9596633,Arabidopsis gls mutants and distinct Fd-GOGAT genes. Implications for photorespiration and primary nitrogen assimilation.,10.1105/tpc.10.5.741,"Ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT) plays a major role in photorespiration in Arabidopsis, as has been determined by the characterization of mutants deficient in Fd-GOGAT enzyme activity (gls). Despite genetic evidence for a single Fd-GOGAT locus and gene, we discovered that Arabidopsis contains two expressed genes for Fd-GOGAT (GLU1 and GLU2). Physical and genetic mapping of the gls1 locus and GLU genes indicates that GLU1 is linked to the gls1 locus, whereas GLU2 maps to a different chromosome. Contrasting patterns of GLU1 and GLU2 expression explain why a mutation in only one of the two genes for Fd-GOGAT leads to a photorespiratory phenotype in the gls1 mutants. GLU1 mRNA was expressed at the highest levels in leaves, and its mRNA levels were specifically induced by light or sucrose. In contrast, GLU2 mRNA was expressed at lower constitutive levels in leaves and preferentially accumulated in roots. Although these results suggest a major role for GLU1 in photorespiration, the sucrose induction of GLU1 mRNA in leaves also suggests a role in primary nitrogen assimilation. This possibility is supported by the finding that chlorophyll levels of a gls mutant are significantly lower than those of the wild type when grown under conditions that suppress photorespiration. Both the mutant analysis and gene regulation studies suggest that GLU1 plays a major role in photorespiration and also plays a role in primary nitrogen assimilation in leaves, whereas the GLU2 gene may play a major role in primary nitrogen assimilation in roots."
9602501,Long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the cerebellum: cellular and molecular mechanisms revisited.,10.1016/s0301-0082(97)00096-8,"Long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission at parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in the cerebellum has been the first established example of enduring decrease of synaptic efficacy in the central nervous system. This review focuses on the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Thus, at the level of the postsynaptic membranes of PCs, induction of LTD requires concommitent activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and of ionotropic and metabotopic glutamate receptors, of the alpha-amino-3 hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxalone-4-propionate (AMPA) and mGluR1 alpha types respectively. Subsequent intracellular cascades involve production of nitric oxide from arginine and of cGMP, activation of phospholipase A2 and of several protein kinases including protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases. Activation of protein kinase G and of phosphatases are also likely to be involved in LTD induction. In contrast, there are still uncertainties concerning a major role of release of calcium from internal stores in LTD induction. Finally protein synthesis is required for a late phase of LTD to occur. All available experimental evidence points towards a postsynaptic site for LTD expression. In particular, electrophysiological data demonstrate a genuine modification of the functional properties of AMPA receptors of PCs during LTD, and immunocytochemical evidence suggests that this might result from a phosphorylation of these receptors."
9603882,Characterization of the hca cluster encoding the dioxygenolytic pathway for initial catabolism of 3-phenylpropionic acid in Escherichia coli K-12.,10.1128/JB.180.11.2915-2923.1998,"We have identified, cloned, and sequenced the hca cluster encoding the dioxygenolytic pathway for initial catabolism of 3-phenylpropionic acid (PP) in Escherichia coli K-12. This cluster maps at min 57.5 of the chromosome and is composed of five catabolic genes arranged as a putative operon (hcaA1A2CBD) and two additional genes transcribed in the opposite direction that encode a potential permease (hcaT) and a regulator (hcaR). Sequence comparisons revealed that while hcaA1A2CD genes encode the four subunits of the 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase, the hcaB gene codes for the corresponding cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. This type of catabolic module is homologous to those encoding class IIB dioxygenases and becomes the first example of such a catabolic cluster in E. coli. The inducible expression of the hca genes requires the presence of the hcaR gene product, which acts as a transcriptional activator and shows significant sequence similarity to members of the LysR family of regulators. Interestingly, the HcaA1A2CD and HcaB enzymes are able to oxidize not only PP to 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) but also cinnamic acid (CI) to its corresponding 2, 3-dihydroxy derivative. Further catabolism of DHPP requires the mhp-encoded meta fission pathway for the mineralization of 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate (3HPP) (A. Ferrández, J. L. García, and E. Díaz, J. Bacteriol. 179:2573-2581, 1997). Expression in Salmonella typhimurium of the mhp genes alone or in combination with the hca cluster allowed the growth of the recombinant bacteria in 3-hydroxycinnamic acid (3HCI) and CI, respectively. Thus, the convergent mhp- and hca-encoded pathways are also functional in S. typhimurium, and they are responsible for the catabolism of different phenylpropanoid compounds (3HPP, 3HCI, PP, and CI) widely available in nature."

9643506,The molecular genetics of central nervous system tumors.,10.1080/00313029800169236,"Over the past few years, although much has been learned about the molecular genetics of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, researchers and pathologists are only beginning to understand the scientific basis of the development of these tumors. Data accumulated so far support the division of glioblastoma into two clinical and molecular subsets. Primary or de novo glioblastomas occur in older patients, are clinically aggressive and exhibit epidermal growth factor receptor amplification or overexpression. Secondary glioblastomas develop from pre-existing low-grade astrocytomas, have a more protracted clinical course, and frequently contain p53 mutations. Both types of tumors show deletions of chromosome 10 and possibly mutations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene as an endstage event. Oligodendrogliomas have been shown to have genetic abnormalities distinct from those of the astrocytic tumors, commonly involving chromosomes 1p and 19q. As regards meningiomas, loss of chromosome 22q and mutations of the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene are frequent events and loss of chromosome 14q and 10q may be seen in atypical or malignant transformation. Such genetic findings, apart from providing a better understanding of neoplastic transformation in brain tumors, are beginning to form the basis of a new approach to neuro-oncology."
9687364,Structural basis of the oligomerization of hepatitis delta antigen.,10.1016/s0969-2126(98)00084-7,The hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a small satellite virus of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Coinfection with HBV and HDV causes severe liver disease in humans. The small 195 amino-acid form of the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) functions as a trans activator of HDV replication. A larger form of the protein containing a 19 amino acid C-terminal extension inhibits viral replication. Both of these functions are mediated in part by a stretch of amino acids predicted to form a coiled coil (residues 13-48) that is common to both forms. It is believed that HDAg forms dimers and higher ordered structures through this coiled-coil region.
9687453,"Degradation of 1,3-dichloropropene by pseudomonas cichorii 170.",10.1128/AEM.64.8.2931-2936.1998,"The gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas cichorii 170, isolated from soil that was repeatedly treated with the nematocide 1, 3-dichloropropene, could utilize low concentrations of 1, 3-dichloropropene as a sole carbon and energy source. Strain 170 was also able to grow on 3-chloroallyl alcohol, 3-chloroacrylic acid, and several 1-halo-n-alkanes. This organism produced at least three different dehalogenases: a hydrolytic haloalkane dehalogenase specific for haloalkanes and two 3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenases, one specific for cis-3-chloroacrylic acid and the other specific for trans-3-chloroacrylic acid. The haloalkane dehalogenase and the trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase were expressed constitutively, whereas the cis-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase was inducible. The presence of these enzymes indicates that 1, 3-dichloropropene is hydrolyzed to 3-chloroallyl alcohol, which is oxidized in two steps to 3-chloroacrylic acid. The latter compound is then dehalogenated, probably forming malonic acid semialdehyde. The haloalkane dehalogenase gene, which is involved in the conversion of 1,3-dichloropropene to 3-chloroallyl alcohol, was cloned and sequenced, and this gene turned out to be identical to the previously studied dhaA gene of the gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB13064. Mutants resistant to the suicide substrate 1,2-dibromoethane lacked haloalkane dehalogenase activity and therefore could not utilize haloalkanes for growth. PCR analysis showed that these mutants had lost at least part of the dhaA gene."
9687539,Intestinal mucosal amino acid catabolism.,10.1093/jn/128.8.1249,"The small intestine is not only responsible for terminal digestion and absorption of nutrients, but it also plays an important role in catabolism of arterial glutamine and dietary amino acids. Most of glutamine and almost all of glutamate and aspartate in the diet are catabolized by small intestinal mucosa, and CO2 accounts for 56-64% of their metabolized carbons. The small intestinal mucosa also plays an important role in degrading arginine, proline and branched-chain amino acids, and perhaps methionine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, glycine and serine in the diet, such that 30-50% of these dietary amino acids are not available to extraintestinal tissues. Dietary amino acids are major fuels for the small intestinal mucosa and are essential precursors for intestinal synthesis of glutathione, nitric oxide, polyamines, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, and amino acids (alanine, citrulline and proline), and are obligatory for maintaining intestinal mucosal mass and integrity. Because intestinal amino acid catabolism plays an important role in modulating dietary amino acid availability to extraintestinal tissues, it has important implications for the utilization efficiency of dietary protein and amino acids in animals and humans."

The dsrAB genes encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase are part of a gene cluster, dsrABEFHCMK, that encodes four small, soluble proteins (DsrE, DsrF, DsrH and DsrC), a transmembrane protein (DsrM) with similarity to haem-b-binding polypeptides and a soluble protein (DsrK) resembling [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing heterodisulfide reductase from methanogenic archaea. Northern hybridizations showed that expression of the dsr genes is increased by the presence of reduced sulfur compounds. The dsr genes are not only transcribed from a putative promoter upstream of dsrA but primary transcripts originating from (a) transcription start site(s) downstream of dsrB are also formed. Polar insertion mutations immediately upstream of dsrA, and in dsrB, dsrH and dsrM, led to an inability of the cells to oxidize intracellularly stored sulfur. The capability of the mutants to oxidize sulfide, thiosulfate and sulfite under photolithoautotrophic conditions was unaltered. Photoorganoheterotrophic growth was also unaffected. 'Reverse' sulfite reductase and DsrEFHCMK are, therefore, not essential for oxidation of sulfide or thiosulfate, but are obligatory for sulfur oxidation. These results, together with the finding that the sulfur globules of C. vinosum are located in the extracytoplasmic space whilst the dsr gene products appear to be either cytoplasmic or membrane-bound led to the proposal of new models for the pathway of sulfur oxidation in this phototrophic sulfur bacterium."

In contrast to a previous report, we found that gapA epd double mutants lacking the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and E4P dehydrogenases are auxotrophic for pyridoxine. These results implicate the GapA and Epd dehydrogenases in de novo PLP and PMP coenzyme biosynthesis."

9705852,A novel pathway for the metabolism of caffeine by a mixed culture consortium.,10.1006/bbrc.1998.9102,"A new oxidative pathway for the degradation of caffeine(1,3,7-Trimethylxanthine, I) by a mixed culture consisting of strains belonging to the genera Klebsiella and Rhodococcus is presented. The mixed culture does not initiate degradation by N-demethylation either complete or partial, but instead carries out oxidation at the C-8 position resulting in the formation of 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid (TMU, II) which further gets degraded to 3,6,8-trimethylallantoin (TMA, III). Both TMU and TMA are hitherto not shown to be formed in the microbial system. Further degradation of TMA (III) by caffeine grown cells yields dimethylurea (VII) as one of the metabolites. Oxygen uptake studies indicated that caffeine(I) grown cells oxidized TMU(II), TMA (III), glyoxalic acid (VI), dimethylurea(VII), and monomethylurea(V), but not monomethyl and dimethyluric acids. The mixed culture does not accept theophylline(1,3-dimethylxanthine), theobromine(3,7-dimethylxanthine), and paraxanthine(1,7-dimethylxanthine) as the carbon source."
9719467,Cytokines and their roles in pancreatic islet beta-cell destruction and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00492-9,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a disease that results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The autoimmune response against islet beta-cells is believed to result from a disorder of immunoregulation. According to this concept, a T helper 1 (Th1) subset of T cells and their cytokine products, i.e. Type 1 cytokines--interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFNgamma), and tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFbeta), dominate over an immunoregulatory (suppressor) Th2 subset of T cells and their cytokine products, i.e. Type 2 cytokines--IL-4 and IL-10. This allows Type 1 cytokines to initiate a cascade of immune/inflammatory processes in the islet (insulitis), culminating in beta-cell destruction. Type 1 cytokines activate (1) cytotoxic T cells that interact specifically with beta-cells and destroy them, and (2) macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNFalpha), and oxygen and nitrogen free radicals that are highly toxic to islet beta-cells. Furthermore, the cytokines IL-1, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma are cytotoxic to beta-cells, in large part by inducing the formation of oxygen free radicals, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite in the beta-cells themselves. Therefore, it would appear that prevention of islet beta-cell destruction and IDDM should be aimed at stimulating the production and/or action of Type 2 cytokines, inhibiting the production and/or action of Type 1 cytokines, and inhibiting the production and/or action of oxygen and nitrogen free radicals in the pancreatic islets."
9735948,Cellular mechanisms of cerebellar LTD.,10.1016/s0166-2236(98)01304-6,"In the past decade there have been advances in understanding the cellular mechanisms of the long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum. This review first summarizes current views on mechanisms involved in LTD induction, from activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, of ionotropic (AMPA) and metabotropic (mGluRI) glutamate receptors, to stimulation of protein kinase C and nitric oxide formation. Second, we will focus on recent findings that point towards the involvement of Ca2+ release from internal stores in LTD induction, localize the sources and targets of nitric oxide and indicate a postsynaptic site for LTD expression. Finally, a role for LTD in motor learning is now well supported by recent experiments on transgenic mice."
9756849,The putative tumor suppressors EXT1 and EXT2 are glycosyltransferases required for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate.,10.1074/jbc.273.41.26265,"Hereditary multiple exostoses, characterized by multiple cartilaginous tumors, is ascribed to mutations at three distinct loci, denoted EXT1-3. Here, we report the purification of a protein from bovine serum that harbored the D-glucuronyl (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl (GlcNAc) transferase activities required for biosynthesis of the glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate (HS). This protein was identified as EXT2. Expression of EXT2 yielded a protein with both glycosyltransferase activities. Moreover, EXT1, previously found to rescue defective HS biosynthesis (McCormick, C., Leduc, Y., Martindale, D., Mattison, K., Esford, L. E., Dyer, A. P., and Tufaro, F. (1998) Nat. Genet. 19, 158-161), was shown to elevate the low GlcA and GlcNAc transferase levels of mutant cells. Thus at least two members of the EXT family of tumor suppressors encode glycosyltransferases involved in the chain elongation step of HS biosynthesis."
9756928,Identification of the MNN2 and MNN5 mannosyltransferases required for forming and extending the mannose branches of the outer chain mannans of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1074/jbc.273.41.26836,"The mannan structure found on the N-linked glycans of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of a long backbone of alpha-1, 6-linked mannose to which are attached branches consisting of two alpha-1,2-linked mannoses followed by an alpha-1,3-linked mannose. In the mutants mnn2 and mnn5, the addition of the first and second of these two mannoses, respectively, is defective. In this paper, we report the identification of the genes corresponding to these mutations. The two genes encode closely related proteins with distant homology to the known Mnn1p alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase. We show that these proteins are localized in an early compartment of the yeast Golgi and that they are not physically associated with each other or with the two protein complexes known to be involved in synthesizing the alpha-1,6-linked backbone. The identification of Mnn2p and Mnn5p allows us to assign Golgi proteins to all of the catalytic steps in S. cerevisiae mannan synthesis."
9759502,The DNA replication fork in eukaryotic cells.,10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.721,"Replication of the two template strands at eukaryotic cell DNA replication forks is a highly coordinated process that ensures accurate and efficient genome duplication. Biochemical studies, principally of plasmid DNAs containing the Simian Virus 40 origin of DNA replication, and yeast genetic studies have uncovered the fundamental mechanisms of replication fork progression. At least two different DNA polymerases, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, a clamp-loading complex, and a polymerase clamp combine to replicate DNA. Okazaki fragment synthesis involves a DNA polymerase-switching mechanism, and maturation occurs by the recruitment of specific nucleases, a helicase, and a ligase. The process of DNA replication is also coupled to cell-cycle progression and to DNA repair to maintain genome integrity."
9765561,Conserved structural regions involved in the catalytic mechanism of Escherichia coli K-12 WaaO (RfaI).,10.1128/JB.180.20.5313-5318.1998,"Escherichia coli K-12 WaaO (formerly known as RfaI) is a nonprocessive alpha-1,3 glucosyltransferase, involved in the synthesis of the R core of lipopolysaccharide. By comparing the amino acid sequence of WaaO with those of 11 homologous alpha-glycosyltransferases, four strictly conserved regions, I, II, III, and IV, were identified. Since functionally related transferases are predicted to have a similar architecture in the catalytic sites, it is assumed that these four regions are directly involved in the formation of alpha-glycosidic linkage from alpha-linked nucleotide diphospho-sugar donor. Hydrophobic cluster analysis revealed a conserved domain at the N termini of these alpha-glycosyltransferases. This domain was similar to that previously reported for beta-glycosyltransferases. Thus, this domain is likely to be involved in the formation of beta-glycosidic linkage between the donor sugar and the enzyme at the first step of the reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of E. coli K-12 WaaO revealed four critical amino acid residues."
9791168,Molecular basis for structural diversity in the core regions of the lipopolysaccharides of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica.,10.1046/j.1365-2958.1998.01063.x,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are unique and complex glycolipids that provide characteristic components of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. In LPS of the Enterobacteriaceae, the core oligosaccharide links a highly conserved lipid A to the antigenic O-polysaccharide. Structural diversity in the core oligosaccharide is limited by the constraints imposed by its essential role in outer membrane stability and provides a contrast to the hypervariable O-antigen. The genetics of core oligosaccharide biosynthesis in Salmonella and Escherichia coli K-12 have served as prototypes for studies on the LPS and lipo-oligosaccharides from a growing range of bacteria. However, despite the wealth of knowledge, there remains a number of unanswered questions, and direct experimental data are not yet available to define the precise mechanism of action of many gene products. Here we present a comparative analysis of the recently completed sequences of the major core oligosaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters from the five known core types in E. coli and the Ra core type of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and discuss advances in the understanding of the related biosynthetic pathways. Differences in these clusters reflect important structural variations in the outer core oligosaccharides and provide a basis for ascribing functions to the genes in these model clusters, whereas highly conserved regions within these clusters suggest a critical and unalterable function for the inner region of the core."
9812980,"Identification of the 11,14,15- and 11,12, 15-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids as endothelium-derived relaxing factors of rabbit aorta.",10.1074/jbc.273.47.30879,"A number of endothelium-derived relaxing factors have been identified including nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Previous work showed that in rabbit aortic endothelial cells, arachidonic acid was metabolized by a lipoxygenase to vasodilatory eicosanoids. The identity was determined by the present study. Aortic homogenates were incubated in the presence of [U-14C]arachidonic acid, [U-14C]arachidonic acid plus 15-lipoxygenase (soybean lipoxidase), or [U-14C]15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) and analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Under both experimental conditions, there was a radioactive metabolite that migrated at 17.5-18.5 min on RP-HPLC. When the metabolite was isolated from aortic homogenates, it relaxed precontracted aortas in a concentration-dependent manner. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the derivatized metabolite indicated the presence of two products; 11,12,15-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (THETA) and 11,14,15-THETA. A variety of chemical modifications of the metabolite supported these structures and confirmed the presence of a carboxyl group, double bonds, and hydroxyl groups. With the combination of 15-lipoxygenase, arachidonic acid, and aortic homogenate, an additional major radioactive peak was observed. This fraction was analyzed by GC/MS. The mass spectrum was consistent with this peak, containing both the 11-hydroxy-14, 15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11-H-14,15-EETA) and 15-H-11,12-EETA. The hydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acid (HEETA) fraction also relaxed precontracted rabbit aorta. Microsomes derived from rabbit aortas also synthesized 11,12,15- and 11,14,15-THETAs from 15-HPETE, and pretreatment with the cyctochrome P450 inhibitor, miconazole, blocked the formation of these products. The present studies suggest that arachidonic acid is metabolized by 15-lipoxygenase to 15-HPETE, which undergoes an enzymatic rearrangement to 11-H-14,15-EETA and 15-H-11,12-EETA. Hydrolysis of the epoxy group results in the formation of 11,14,15- and 11,12,15-THETA, which relaxed rabbit aorta. Thus, the 15-series THETAs join prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids as new members of the family of endothelium-derived relaxing factors."

Initial DNA sequencing suggested that this system is highly conserved among the pathogenic Yersinia. Yersiniabactin contains a phenolic group and three five-membered thiazole heterocycles that serve as iron ligands."
9830033,Characterization of the syringomycin synthetase gene cluster. A link between prokaryotic and eukaryotic peptide synthetases.,10.1074/jbc.273.49.32857,"With this work we have completed the characterization of the syringomycin synthetase gene cluster. In particular, by sequencing additional 28.5 kilobase pairs we show that the nine modules involved in the binding of the nine amino acids of syringomycin are localized on SyrB and SyrE, with SyrE carrying eight modules. The recombinant SyrB and the first and second modules of SyrE (SyrE1 and SyrE2) have been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The biochemical data indicate that SyrB binds threonine, the putative precursor of the last amino acid of syringomycin, whereas SyrE1 and SyrE2 bind serine, the first and the second amino acids of syringomycin, respectively. On the basis of the sequence analysis and the biochemical data presented here, it appears that syringomycin synthetase is unique among peptide synthetases in that its genetic organization does not respect the ""colinearity rule"" according to which the order of the amino acid binding modules along the chromosome parallels the order of the amino acids on the peptide. This feature, together with the absence of a single transcription unit and the absence of epimerase-like domains make syringomycin synthetase more related to the eukaryotic peptide synthetases than to the bacterial counterparts."
9841672,MAP kinase pathways in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1128/MMBR.62.4.1264-1300.1998,"A cascade of three protein kinases known as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is commonly found as part of the signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells. Almost two decades of genetic and biochemical experimentation plus the recently completed DNA sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome have revealed just five functionally distinct MAPK cascades in this yeast. Sexual conjugation, cell growth, and adaptation to stress, for example, all require MAPK-mediated cellular responses. A primary function of these cascades appears to be the regulation of gene expression in response to extracellular signals or as part of specific developmental processes. In addition, the MAPK cascades often appear to regulate the cell cycle and vice versa. Despite the success of the gene hunter era in revealing these pathways, there are still many significant gaps in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms for activation of these cascades and how the cascades regulate cell function. For example, comparison of different yeast signaling pathways reveals a surprising variety of different types of upstream signaling proteins that function to activate a MAPK cascade, yet how the upstream proteins actually activate the cascade remains unclear. We also know that the yeast MAPK pathways regulate each other and interact with other signaling pathways to produce a coordinated pattern of gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms of this cross talk are poorly understood. This review is therefore an attempt to present the current knowledge of MAPK pathways in yeast and some directions for future research in this area."
9858571,"The yeast RER2 gene, identified by endoplasmic reticulum protein localization mutations, encodes cis-prenyltransferase, a key enzyme in dolichol synthesis.",10.1128/MCB.19.1.471,"As an approach to understand the molecular mechanisms of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein sorting, we have isolated yeast rer mutants that mislocalize a Sec12-Mfalpha1p fusion protein from the ER to later compartments of the secretory pathway (S. Nishikawa and A. Nakano, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:8179-8183, 1993). The temperature-sensitive rer2 mutant mislocalizes different types of ER membrane proteins, suggesting that RER2 is involved in correct localization of ER proteins in general. The rer2 mutant shows several other characteristic phenotypes: slow growth, defects in N and O glycosylation, sensitivity to hygromycin B, and abnormal accumulation of membranes, including the ER and the Golgi membranes. RER2 and SRT1, a gene whose overexpression suppresses rer2, encode novel proteins similar to each other, and their double disruption is lethal. RER2 homologues are found not only in eukaryotes but also in many prokaryote species and thus constitute a large gene family which has been well conserved during evolution. Taking a hint from the phenotype of newly established mutants of the Rer2p homologue of Escherichia coli, we discovered that the rer2 mutant is deficient in the activity of cis-prenyltransferase, a key enzyme of dolichol synthesis. This and other lines of evidence let us conclude that members of the RER2 family of genes encode cis-prenyltransferase itself. The difference in phenotypes between the rer2 mutant and previously obtained glycosylation mutants suggests a novel, as-yet-unknown role of dolichol."
9864322,Molecular and biochemical characterization of the protein template controlling biosynthesis of the lipopeptide lichenysin.,10.1128/JB.181.1.133-140.1999,"Lichenysins are surface-active lipopeptides with antibiotic properties produced nonribosomally by several strains of Bacillus licheniformis. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of an entire 26.6-kb lichenysin biosynthesis operon from B. licheniformis ATCC 10716. Three large open reading frames coding for peptide synthetases, designated licA, licB (three modules each), and licC (one module), could be detected, followed by a gene, licTE, coding for a thioesterase-like protein. The domain structure of the seven identified modules, which resembles that of the surfactin synthetases SrfA-A to -C, showed two epimerization domains attached to the third and sixth modules. The substrate specificity of the first, fifth, and seventh recombinant adenylation domains of LicA to -C (cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli) was determined to be Gln, Asp, and Ile (with minor Val and Leu substitutions), respectively. Therefore, we suppose that the identified biosynthesis operon is responsible for the production of a lichenysin variant with the primary amino acid sequence L-Gln-L-Leu-D-Leu-L-Val-L-Asp-D-Leu-L-Ile, with minor Leu and Val substitutions at the seventh position."
9874810,"Isolation of a cytokinin gene, ZOG1, encoding zeatin O-glucosyltransferase from Phaseolus lunatus.",10.1073/pnas.96.1.284,"Zeatin is the most active and ubiquitous of the naturally occurring cytokinins. The O-glucoside of zeatin, found in all plants examined, is considered to be important in cytokinin transport, storage, and protection against cytokinin oxidases. The enzyme UDPglucose:zeatin O-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.203) was previously isolated from Phaseolus lunatus seeds. Immunoscreening of an expression library with monospecific antibody resulted in the isolation of a cDNA encoding the enzyme. The recombinant protein efficiently converts labeled zeatin to O-glucosylzeatin and has properties similar to the native enzyme. The cDNA of 1.5 kb contains an ORF encoding a 51. 4-kDa polypeptide of 459 amino acids. The sequence is unique based on a BLAST search of data bases. The genomic sequence, isolated with PCR using specific primers based on the cDNA sequence, does not contain introns. The cloning of this gene provides the tools for further study of the regulation of cytokinin metabolism and analysis of the precise role of O-glucosylzeatin in plant development."
9878780,Processing glycosidases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,10.1016/s0304-4165(98)00129-9,"The properties of the N-glycan processing glycosidases located in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are described. alpha-Glucosidase I encoded by CWH41 cleaves the terminal alpha1, 2-linked glucose and alpha-glucosidase II encoded by ROT2 removes the two alpha1,3-linked glucose residues from the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide precursor while the alpha1,2-mannosidase encoded by MNS1 removes one specific mannose to form a single isomer of Man8GlcNAc2. Although trimming by these glycosidases is not essential for the formation of N-glycan outer chains, recent studies on mutants lacking these enzymes indicate that alpha-glucosidases I and II play an indirect role in cell wall beta1,6-glucan formation and that the alpha1,2-mannosidase is involved in endoplasmic reticulum quality control. Detailed structure-function studies of recombinant yeast alpha1,2-mannosidase are described that serve as a model for other members of this enzyme family that has been conserved through eukaryotic evolution."

These carbohydrates play a variety of biological roles, ranging from the stabilization of glycoprotein structure to the provision of ligands for cell-cell interactions to the regulation of cell surface properties. Progress in our understanding of the biosynthesis and regulation of glycoconjugates has been accelerating at a rapid pace. Recent advances in the field of yeast glycobiology have been particularly impressive. This review focuses on glycosylation of proteins in the Golgi of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with emphasis on the candidate mannosyltransferases that participate in the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides. Current views on how these enzymes may be regulated and how glycosylation relates on other cellular processes are also discussed."
9922132,Crystal structure of L-arginine:inosamine-phosphate amidinotransferase StrB1 from Streptomyces griseus: an enzyme involved in streptomycin biosynthesis.,10.1021/bi981949p,"Inosamine-phosphate amidinotransferases catalyze two nonconsecutive transamidination reactions in the biosynthesis of the streptomycin family of antibiotics. L-Arginine:inosamine-phosphate amidinotransferase StrB1 from Streptomyces griseus (StrB1) was cloned as an N-terminal hexa-histidine fusion protein, purified by affinity chromatography, and crystallized, and its crystal structure was solved by Patterson search methods at 3.1 A resolution. The structure is composed of five betabeta alphabeta-modules which are arranged circularly into a pseudo-5-fold symmetric particle. The three-dimensional structure is closely related to the structure of human L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AT), but five loops (the 40-, 170-, 220-, 250-, and 270-loop) are organized very differently. The major changes are found in loops around the active site which open the narrow active site channel of AT to form an open and solvent-exposed cavity. In particular, module II of StrB1 is AT-like but lacks a 10-residue alpha-helix in the 170-loop. The concomitant reorganization of neighboring surface loops that surround the active site, i.e., the 40-loop and the 270-loop, results in an arrangement of loops which allows an unrestricted access of substrates to the cavity. However, the residues which are involved in substrate binding and catalysis are conserved in AT and StrB1 and are at equivalent topological positions, suggesting a similar reaction mechanism among amidinotransferases. The binding site for L-arginine had been deduced from its complex with AT. Molecular modeling revealed a possible binding mode for the second substrate scyllo-inosamine 4-phosphate."
9927518,The common cytokine receptor gamma chain and the pre-T cell receptor provide independent but critically overlapping signals in early alpha/beta T cell development.,10.1084/jem.189.3.563,"Intracellular signals emanating from cytokine and antigen receptors are integrated during the process of intrathymic development. Still, the relative contributions of cytokine receptor signaling to pre-T cell receptor (TCR) and TCR-mediated differentiation remain undefined. Interleukin (IL)-7 interactions with its cognate receptor complex (IL-7Ralpha coupled to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain, gammac) play a dominant role in early thymopoiesis. However, alpha/beta T cell development in IL-7-, IL-7Ralpha-, and gammac-deficient mice is only partially compromised, suggesting that additional pathways can rescue alpha/beta T lineage cells in these mice. We have investigated the potential interdependence of gammac- and pre-TCR-dependent pathways during intrathymic alpha/beta T cell differentiation. We demonstrate that gammac-dependent cytokines do not appear to be required for normal pre-TCR function, and that the rate-limiting step in alpha/beta T cell development in gammac- mice does not involve TCR-beta chain rearrangements, but rather results from poor maintenance of early thymocytes. Moreover, mice double mutant for both gammac and pre-Talpha show vastly reduced thymic cellularity and a complete arrest of thymocyte differentiation at the CD44(+)CD25(+) cell stage. These observations demonstrate that the pre-TCR provides the gammac-independent signal which allows alpha/beta T cell development in gammac- mice. Thus, a series of overlapping signals derived from cytokine and T cell receptors guide the process of alpha/beta thymocyte development."

We purified NAS protein and isolated the genes nas1, nas2, nas3, nas4, nas5-1, nas5-2, and nas6, which encode NAS and NAS-like proteins from Fe-deficient barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Ehimehadaka no. 1) roots. Escherichia coli expressing nas1 showed NAS activity, confirming that this gene encodes a functional NAS. Expression of nas genes as determined by northern-blot analysis was induced by Fe deficiency and was root specific. The NAS genes form a multigene family in the barley and rice genomes."
9988768,Expression of heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase isoforms reveals novel substrate specificities.,10.1074/jbc.274.8.5185,"The 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues is an important modification during the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS). Our previous studies have led us to purify and molecularly clone the heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST-1), which is the key enzyme converting nonanticoagulant heparan sulfate (HSinact) to anticoagulant heparan sulfate (HSact). In this study, we expressed and characterized the full-length cDNAs of 3-OST-1 homologous genes, designated as 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B as described in the accompanying paper (Shworak, N. W., Liu, J., Petros, L. M., Zhang, L., Kobayashi, M., Copeland, N. G., Jenkins, N. A., and Rosenberg, R. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 5170-5184). All these cDNAs were successfully expressed in COS-7 cells, and heparan sulfate sulfotransferase activities were found in the cell extracts. We demonstrated that 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B are heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferases because the enzymes transfer sulfate from adenosine 3'-phosphophate 5'-phospho-[35S]sulfate ([35S]PAPS) to the 3-OH position of glucosamine. 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B sulfate an identical disaccharide. HSact conversion activity in the cell extract transfected by 3-OST-1 was shown to be 300-fold greater than that in the cell extracts transfected by 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A, suggesting that 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A do not make HSact. The results of the disaccharide analysis of the nitrous acid-degraded [35S]HS suggested that 3-OST-2 transfers sulfate to GlcA2S-GlcNS and IdoA2S-GlcNS; 3-OST-3A transfers sulfate to IdoA2S-GlcNS. Our results demonstrate that the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine is generated by different isoforms depending on the saccharide structures around the modified glucosamine residue. This discovery has provided evidence for a new cellular mechanism for generating a defined saccharide sequence in structurally complex HS polysaccharide."
