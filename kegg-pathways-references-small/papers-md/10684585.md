# Phagosome dynamics and function

Torunn Elisabeth Tjelle,$^{1*}$ Torunn Løvdal,$^{2}$ and Trond Berg$^{2}$

## Summary

Phagocytosis of microorganisms and other particles is mediated most efficiently by receptors such as Fc-receptors (FcR) and complement-receptors (C3R). Interaction between these receptors and ligands on the particle results in signal transduction events that lead to actin polymerisation and phagosome formation. The phagosome then undergoes a maturation process whereby it transforms into a phagolysosome. Phagosome maturation depends on interactions (fusion events) with early and late endosomes as well as with lysosomes. The fusion processes are regulated by small GTP-binding proteins and other proteins that are also involved in fusion processes in the endocytic pathway. Although most phagocytosed microorganisms are killed in the lysosome, some pathogens have developed survival strategies and are able to live in the harsh conditions in the phagolysosome or interfere with the maturation process and thereby evade destruction by acid hydrolases.

## Introduction

Phagocytosis is the uptake by the cell of relatively large particles (>0.5 μm) into vacuoles and is a central mechanism in the tissue remodelling, inflammation, and defence against infectious agents. Paradoxically, phagocytosis is also a common mechanism by which certain microorganisms invade host cells and thus avoid direct destruction by serum antibodies, complement, or cytotoxic cells.

The phagocytic process may be divided into several steps (Fig. 1): binding of the particle to the cell surface, formation of an endocytic vesicle termed phagosome, maturation of the phagosome to become a phagolysosome, and, finally, digestion within the phagolysosome. The process is initiated by signals that originate from the receptors involved in binding of the particle. The receptors are activated upon binding which results in signals that induce actin polymerisation. The receptors have been the subject of several recent reviews and will not be dealt with here although we will discuss briefly the mechanisms whereby the FcR and the C3R mediate the formation of phagosomes. The main emphasis will, however, be on the development of the phagosome. This process is intimately related to the endocytic process which is also involved in the presentation of antigen peptides from the phagocytosed material. Although one of the main functions of phagocytosis is to destroy microorganisms, several pathogens are able to live within the phagosome and even within the phagolysosome. The mechanisms whereby the pathogens modify the phagocytic pathway to their own advantage have provided interesting information about the development of the phagosome. We will, therefore, discuss how pathogens evade the host defence mechanisms.

### Formation of the phagosome

When particles bind to the cell surface, the cell membrane invaginates and buds off to form a phagosome. This process is mediated by a large number of different receptors (Table 1) that facilitate the binding of particles to the cell surface. These receptors may interact with targets directly, through structural determinants present on the surface of targets (non-opsonic phagocytosis), or indirectly, by recognising opsonins supplied by the host (opsonin-dependent phagocytosis). The best-characterised opsonin receptors are the various receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcyR) (for review see Ref. 1), and complement receptor 3 (CR3) that binds complement protein 3bi. FcyR are constitutively active in phagocytosis, whereas CR3 binds but does not internalise particles without additional stimuli, such as phorbol esters or cytokine stimulation or attachment to extracellular matrix proteins.(2)

Phagocytosis mediated by FcR and CR is driven by the reorganisation of filamentous actin (F-actin),(3,4) but the mechanisms of uptake appear to be different. FcyR initiate phagocytosis by a zipper mechanism whereby interaction of an opsonised IgG with FcyR stimulates the spreading of pseudopods around the particle to produce a phagosome that is tightly apposed to the particle.(5–7) However, particles that bind to CR sink directly into the body of the cell with elaboration of small, if any, pseudopodia. Moreover, the

phagosome membrane is less tightly attached to complement-opsonized particles, with point-like contact areas separating looser regions of membrane.^(6,7)^ Components of the cortical cytoskeleton such as F-actin, vinculin, α-actinin, paxillin, and proteins containing phosphotyrosine residues, are enriched in these contact areas but are uniformly distributed during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis.^(7)^

Internalisation of FcγR, but not pseudopod extension, is blocked by cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerisation, indicating that these events are functionally separate.^(8)^ Generally, the internalisation process requires actin polymerisation, pseudopod extension or membrane invagination, membrane recruitment, and membrane closure where all the different steps are tightly regulated by several factors depending on which receptor is involved (Table 2); for review see Ref. 9.

### Intracellular fate of the phagosome

The phagosome undergoes a series of fusion/fission processes with vesicles in the cell, preferentially with organelles from the endocytic pathway, to eventually form phagolysosomes. Thus, the phagosome membrane gradually changes to become more similar to that of late endosomes and lysosomes in the endocytic pathway.^(26)^ There are two major models to describe the endocytic pathway: the "vesicle shuttle model" which proposes that transport vesicles connect pre-existing endocytic organelles, and the "maturation model" which suggests that the endocytic vesicles gradually transform into later stages of endocytic vesicles. In both models, fusion and fission are frequent events; however, the phagocytic pathway is most likely to involve the same fusion and fission processes as those found in the endocytic pathway. While most groups perceive phagocytosis as a maturation process, the kinetics of this maturation presents a rather complex picture. The main reason for this complexity is the broad spectra of phagocytic particles and different cell systems used in different studies.

### Phagosomes and the endocytic pathway

There are multiple points of interaction between phagosomes and the endocytic pathway.^(27,28)^ The complexity of phagosome maturation, however, makes it difficult to dissect the molecular events that phagosomes undergo in vivo. Using a cell-free fusion system it has been shown that all the endocytic organelles can fuse with phagosomes following a certain pattern.^(28)^ Both early and late endosomes fuse readily with 20 minute old phagosomes in an ATP dependent manner. The efficiency of this process decrease steadily as the phagosomes age. Conversely, 2hr old phagosomes fuse most efficiently with lysosomes, supporting the observation that phagosomes acquire lysosomal enzymes at an increasing rate 2hr after internalisation.^(29)^ “Old” phagosomes (i.e., 7hr), do not fuse with any of the endocytic organelles.^(28)^ Similar to the lateral fusion of early endosomes,^(30)^ the fusion of phagosomes with early endosomes is stimulated by the small GTPase, rab5. Unexpectedly, however, fusion of phagosomes with late endosomes or lysosomes is also stimulated by rab5 in J774 cells.^(29)^ This finding is in contrast to the results obtained with other cell-lines.^(31)^ Most studies on membrane traffic have been performed on non-phagocytes, however, and professional phagocytes may show different endocytic features to facilitate the processing of invading microorganisms. It is possible that this is due to the presence of rab5 on the late endosomal and, to a lesser extent, the lysosomal membranes of J774 cells.

Chastellier et al.^(32)^ also proposed that, during maturation, newly formed phagosomes gradually lose their ability to fuse with early endosomes. It is possible that a recycling process results in the loss of fusion-mediating factors since prevention of recycling by using hydrophobic beads tightly associated with phagosome membranes creates phagosomes that are able to fuse with early endosomes but do not mature into phagolysosomes. In contrast, phagosomes containing hydrophilic beads display loose membranes surrounding the beads and fuse readily with early endosomes and lysosomes.

Evidence suggests that fusion between endocytic organelles and phagosomes is not a complete fusion but rather a brief exchange of fluid and membrane following a fusion and fission process defined as a “kiss-and-run” interaction.^(33)^ In support of this, the kinetics with which different molecules are delivered to phagosomes vary according to their size. Sulforhodamine, a low molecular weight molecule, appears in phagosomes within 2hr of phagocytosis. In contrast, dextran, a high molecular weight molecule, accumulates in the same phagosomes over a period of 24hr.^(34)^ The same phenomenon has been observed with colloidal gold particles of different sizes.^(35)^ In addition, phagosomes do not acquire endocytic membrane and solutes simultaneously, as would be expected in a single complete fusion event. Lysosomal markers such as LAMPs and the fluid phase marker horseradish peroxidase were delivered to latex-containing phagosomes with different kinetics.^(26)^ Furthermore, video microscopy showed that phagosomes and late endocytic organelles engage in multiple, transient contacts shortly after phagosome formation. This process is microtubule-

dependent suggesting that fusion of phagosomes with endocytic organelles occurs via microtubule-dependent transport.^(26,36,37)^

**Molecular mechanisms of phagosome fusion**

Desjardins et al.^(26,33)^ provided evidence that phagosomes undergo a complex series of biochemical changes. Phagosomes acquire markers of late endocytic organelles such as rab7, LAMP1, and LAMP2 and lose markers of early endocytic organelles including rab5 during their transformation into phagolysosomes.^(26)^ Therefore, it is likely that changes in the phagosome membrane are acquired by fusion events between phagosomes and endosomes of different stages depending on the age of the phagosomes.

Several endosomal markers are also present on phagosomal membranes; these include the mannose receptor and the transferrin receptor,^(38)^ fusion proteins, and factors such as rab5, rab7,^(26)^ NSF and α/β-SNAP,^(38)^ and other yet unidentified small GTPases.^(26)^ In addition, other proteins thought to be involved in endocytic or exocytic vesicle fusion such as annexins,^(39,40)^ synaptobrevin,^(35)^ and syntaxin^(41)^ are also found on phagosomal membranes. Over 200 molecules have been found to localise in the phagosomal membranes^(42)^ but only a few of these have yet been characterised (Table 3).

Phagosome-endosome in vitro fusion requires cytosol, ATP, and phagosomal membrane proteins and is inhibited by NEM (N-ethylmaleimide) and antibodies against NSF.^(27,36)^ In addition, small GTP binding proteins are thought to be involved in the regulation of phagosome-endosome fusion.^(36)^ Jahraus et al.^(28)^ revealed that fusion of early but not late phagosomes with endosomes as well as lysosomes are stimulated by rab5. Furthermore, cell-specific requirements have been shown: phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages is calcium independent^(45)^ while neutrophils require calcium for fusion.^(46)^

**Degradation of phagocytosed particles**

Phagocytosed particles are probably degraded by the same machinery as endocytosed material and as in the endocytic pathway, acidification of the phagosome is a critical component in the degradation process. Vacuolar ATPases accumulate in the phagosomal membrane as it matures^(47)^ and these may be involved in the acidification of the phagosome. Furthermore, it is suggested that phagosomes interact continuously with enzyme-bearing organelles in order to obtain enzymes and replenish those enzymes with a short half-life.^(48)^ The particle can, therefore, be completely degraded within the phagolysosomal compartment.^(49)^ This is supported by studies showing that the level of lysosomal enzymes increases in 2hr old phagosomes suggesting a bulk fusion with lysosomes.^(29)^ Moreover, partial degradation may occur in phagosomes with subsequent transport to late endosomes for complete proteolysis.^(50)^ Indeed, transport of phagosomal material to both endosomes^(51)^ and lysosomes^(49)^ has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, degradation probably starts before the transport to endocytic organelles. The proteases utilised for early processing could be provided from early or late endosomes which is consistent with studies showing fusion of phagosomes with endosomes,^(28)^ and transport of proteases resident in early endosomes to early phagosomes.^(29)^

**Antigen processing and presentation**

Proteolytic antigen processing produces short peptides that bind major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) molecules which, in turn, produce the peptide–MHC class II complexes that are presented to T-cells. Antigens taken up by phagocytosis are processed and presented at the cell surface in complex with MHC class II molecules^(52)^ and more recently discovered, with MHC class I molecules.^(53)^ Clearly, phagosomes play an important role in the proteolytic generation of immunogenic peptides from particulate antigens, including microorganisms.

Both MHC class II molecules and phagocytosed antigens are present in phagosomes.^(54)^ Phagosomes may receive MHC class II molecules following fusion with vesicles from the trans-Golgi network that contain newly synthesised MHC class II molecules or by fusion with endocytic organelles.^(44)^

^a^General occurrence of protein, age of the phagosomes was not determined.
The binding of antigens to MHC class II molecules may take place in the phagosome.^(55)^ Alternatively, partially or fully processed antigens from the phagosomes may be transported to the endocytic pathway for further processing and binding to MHC class II molecules.^(50,51)^

Phagosomal compartments acquire proteases by fusion with organelles in the endocytic pathway, as described previously. Kinetic studies by using electron microscopy indicate that phagosome–lysosome fusion and phagolysosomal degradation of bacteria are initiated during the course of antigen processing.^(52)^ A minimum of 20–30 minutes is required in this system to generate peptide–MHC class II complexes at the cell surface. Furthermore, bacterial peptide epitopes from the entire bacteria are efficiently presented to T-cells,^(52,56,57)^ indicating that the processing environment must be able to disrupt and degrade all bacterial compartments.

Although exogenous antigens are presented primarily by MHC class II molecules, the phagocytosed antigens may also be presented by MHC class I molecules.^(53,58–60)^ The MHC class I-presentation of phagocytosed antigens is dependent on cytosolic proteolysis and transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).^(58)^ In contrast, other studies have shown that class I presentation is resistant to Brefeldin A and cycloheximide, both of which inhibit the classical MHC class I pathway by preventing transport from ER to the surface. This suggests an alternative pathway for antigen–MHC class I presentation.^(53,59)^ These studies further suggest that there are two alternative processing mechanisms for the presentation of exogenous particulate antigens. In one, particulate antigens are internalised and escape from the phagosome before or after the formation of smaller peptides. The antigens are then eventually processed further by proteasomes and transported via the TAP1–TAP2 transporters into the ER.^(58)^ Alternatively, processed antigens may meet MHC class I molecules in endocytic organelles or at the cell surface,^(53,59)^ although this hypothesis needs further investigation. Generally, presentation of exogenous antigens by MHC class I molecules seems to be restricted to phagocytosed antigens.^(53,59)^ One exception is when endocytosed antigens are taken up in the presence of phagocytic stimuli. In this case, endocytosed antigens may also gain access to the MHC class I processing pathway.^(61)^

**Evading host defence mechanisms**

Different pathogens may interfere with one or more of the different steps in the phagocytic process to survive inside the host cell. A major function of phagocytosis is to mediate the ingestion and elimination of infectious agents, and the majority of bacteria, including many bacterial pathogens, that are phagocytosed by macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes are killed. However, several pathogens have devised strategies to survive and replicate inside cells.

---

### Evasion

One possible way to succeed in an environment inhabited with phagocytic cells is to avoid uptake by these cells. *Yersinia* species invade epithelial cells by induced phagocytosis.^(62)^ In addition, these pathogens may secrete Yop proteins (members of the type III secretion system) that inhibit phagocytosis. The anti-phagocytic proteins are injected into the phagocyte upon contact of the bacteria with the host cell. Yop proteins interfere with cytoskeletal functions and may act as tyrosine phosphatases and thereby interrupt the signalling associated with phagocytosis.^(63)^

### Escape

Some of the pathogenic organisms that enter parasitophorous vacuoles reside only transiently in the vacuoles. The bacteria *Shigella flexneri*^(64)^ and *Listeria monocytogenes*^(65)^ and the parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi*^(66)^ enter the host cytosol by pathogen-directed lysis of the vacuolar membranes. *Shigella* and *Listeria* invade cells by macropinocytosis whereas the parasitophorous vacuole containing *Trypanosoma cruzi* is formed by recruitment and fusion of host cell lysosomes at the site of entry.^(66)^

### Survival within the phagolysosome

Certain bacteria are able to survive in the phagolysosome. *Leishmania mexicana* induces parasitophorous vacuoles that by several criteria are bonafide lysosomes. These acidic organelles (pH 4.7–5.2) contain lysosomal hydrolases, lysosomal glycoproteins and proton ATPases.^(67,68)^ The vacuoles generated by *Leishmania* also acquire mannose-6-phosphate receptors, rab7, and microsialin.^(69)^ The presence of these markers are compatible with the theory that parasitophorous vacuoles develop into phagolysosomes. Phagocytosed *Coxiella burnetii* is also delivered to the phagolysosome and evidently thrives in the acidic environment of these organelles.^(70)^ How this bacterium manages to survive in the lysosome is not known, although it has been shown that it produces enzymes (including acid phosphatase) that eliminate or prevent formation of toxic oxygen metabolites by the host cell.^(70)^ *Salmonella* may express proteins that enhance survival within the macrophage after entry. Such products neutralise lysosomal killing mechanisms mediated by cationic peptides and inhibit processing and presentation of antigens expressed by the intracellular bacteria.^(71)^ The vacuole containing *Salmonella* seems to acidify rapidly during formation and the acidification appears necessary for survival since acidic pH initiate synthesis of factors that enhance survival.^(71)^

### Inhibition of the maturation process

Other phagocytosed pathogens that are not equipped to survive in the harsh conditions of the lysosome have devised different strategies to interfere with the normal maturation of
the phagosome so that the parasitophorous vacuole forms
a privileged niche for the pathogen. A common feature of
parasitophorous vacuoles is their ability to restrict the
interactions with endocytic and secretory organelles^(72)^
which are essential for phagosomal maturation. It is possible
that the pathogens regulate the insertion of proteins involved
in membrane budding and fusion in the endocytic and
phagocytic pathways. The degree to which the parasitophorous
vacuole communicates with other members of the
vacuolar apparatus varies with different pathogens. *Toxoplasma gondii* invades host cells by means of a micofilament-based motility system in the parasite itself.^(73)^ It rapidly
forms a “phagosome” by invaginating the host cell plasma
membrane. During this invasion a number of plasma membrane
proteins are removed from the phagosome which
becomes isolated from the endocytic pathway. Markers of
the endosomal system such as lgp1, LAMP1, transferrin
receptors, mannose-6-phosphate receptors and the proton
pump are not present in *Toxoplasma gondii* parasitophorous
vacuoles.^(70)^ Similarly, an early event in chlamydial infection
involves the expression of proteins that isolate the chlamydial
phagosome from the endosomal–lysosomal pathway. This
vacuole fuses with sphingomyelin-containing exocytic vesicles and inhibition of early chlamydial transcription or
translation causes the vacuoles to eventually fuse with
lysosomes.^(74)^

Although other intracellular parasites also restrict fusion
activity of the vacuole in which they reside, there is considerable variation in the way this is achieved. *Salmonella typhimurium* enters into both phagocytic and non-phagocytic
cells by macropinocytosis and resides subsequently in a
spacious phagosome.^(72)^ *Salmonella* entry also induces
sorting of membrane proteins, indicating that the bacteria
regulates the components of the parasitophorous vacuole for
its own needs. In both epithelial cells and in macrophages
the phagocytic pathway of *Salmonella* is separated from
the main endocytic pathway and lacks several lysosomal
markers.^(72)^

Mycobacterium species also interfere with phagosome
maturation.^(75)^ D’Arcy Hart and coworkers showed in early
studies that fusion between phagosomes containing *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* or *Mycobacterium microti* and lysosomes was suppressed.^(76)^ It was later shown that ammonia
produced by the bacteria inhibits fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes, and it was suggested that fusion is
pH-dependent.^(77)^ This notion is compatible with several
recent observations indicating that fusion between organelles in the vacuolar apparatus is dependent on a proton
gradient between the interacting vacuoles, for instance
between early and late endosomes.^(78)^ It was later established that live *M. tuberculosis* resides in nonacidified
phagosomes.^(79)^ Moreover, Russell and coworkers have
shown that mycobacterial phagosomes do not contain the
vacuolar proton pump.^(75)^ Mycobacterial vacuoles are
relatively inaccessible to the macrophage endosomal system. Not only is fusion between lysosomes and phagosomes
prevented, but endocytosed fluid phase markers are also
not transferred to mycobacterial vesicles in significant
amounts.^(76,80)^ Some communication between early endosomes and the mycobacterial vacuoles is indicated, however,
as mycobacterial phagosomes do accept the transferrin
receptor.^(81)^ The lack of fluid phase markers could simply be
due to the close apposition of phagosomal membrane and
pathogen.^(32)^ While the mycobacterial phagosome lacks the
vacuolar proton pump and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor it acquires the late endosomal marker LAMP1.^(82)^ If
LAMP1 and the transferrin receptor are acquired by fusion
with early and late endosomes, respectively, how are the
proton pump and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, both of
which are present in endosomes, excluded? The “kiss and run” model phagosome and endosome interaction (described above) could explain the acquisition of selected
membrane proteins and the exclusion of soluble contents.
Alternatively, LAMP1 could be acquired from the de novo
synthesis pathway of the Golgi rather than by fusion with
lysosomes and endosomes. Further studies are required to
elucidate mechanisms involved in membrane transport.

### Effects on the fusion mechanisms

Studies during the last decade have revealed that membrane
budding and fusion are regulated by a number of proteins
that are relatively specific to the interacting vacuoles.^(83,84)^
Rab5 is involved in fusion between early endosomes and
phagosomes,^(28)^ and it is likely that rab7 has a similar role in
the fusion between late endosomes and phagosomes.^(84)^
The proteins involved in budding and fusion of vesicular
membranes are ideal targets for pathogens that create their
privileged niches by interfering with phagosome formation
and maturation. The question of control of the mycobacterial
phagosome maturation by small GTP binding proteins has
recently been addressed.^(81)^ It was found that rab5 continues
to accumulate on phagosomes containing live mycobacteria
in contrast to those containing latex beads. The latter
vacuoles first acquire rab5 and then lose it as they mature
into phagolysosomes. Furthermore, while latex-containing
phagosomes acquire rab7, the mycobacterial phagosomes
do not. This is in line with the notion that transformation of
the phagosome into phagolysosomes is dependent on the
acquisition of rab7 at the expense of rab5.^(26)^ Stahl and
coworkers have recently shown that rab5 also accumulates
on phagosomes containing live *Listeria monocytogenes*.^(38)^
In addition, other early endosomal markers including the
mannose and transferrin receptors and key fusion factors
necessary for early events (rab5, NSF and α/β-SNAP) were
found in the membrane of live *Listeria*. The mannose 6-
phosphate receptor, a late endosomal marker, was not

The fusion may either be transient (kiss-and-run) or complete. However, the most likely mechanism for the maturation of phagosomes is a combination of these two fusion models.

present, however. In contrast, phagosomal membranes of dead *Listeria* readily acquired both early and late endosomal markers.^(38)^ The results indicate that the bacteria actively regulate fusion with early endosomes by recruiting rab5 to the membrane, and thereby prevent fusion with later degradative compartments. Thus, the live bacterium may extend its survival in the endosomal compartment from where it can translocate into the cytosolic compartment. The mechanism whereby rab5 and NSF are recruited to the phagosomal membrane is not known. One possibility is that alteration of phagosomal pH influences fusion between endosomes and phagosomes since it has been shown that live *M. avium* induces more basic endosomal pH than that in phagosomes containing dead bacteria.^(85)^ In this study, as previously, the phagosomes containing live bacteria fused less efficiently with lysosomes than ingested heat-killed bacteria.

### Conclusions

Our current knowledge supports a model of phagosome maturation in which the endocytic and phagocytic pathway communicate both by transient and complete fusion (Fig. 2). Transient fusion is suggested as phagosomes gradually acquire membrane markers with different kinetics than solutes.^(26,42)^ Complete fusion is suggested by the finding that endocytic vesicles can fuse with phagosomes in intact cells^(44)^ and in vitro fusion assay,^(28,44)^ although a transient fusion process has not been ruled out. In addition, continuous recycling of the phagosomal membrane to either the plasma membrane or to other endocytic/phagocytic vesicles probably occurs in the dynamic process of phagosome formation.

Phagosome maturation appears to employ the same fusion machinery as the fusion events in the endocytic pathway. However, the regulation of the two alternative outcomes subsequent to phagosome-endosome fusion (Fig. 2), remains unknown. Since phagocytosis is a highly specialised process, we may discover a variety of surprising mechanisms (i.e., lysosome fusion stimulated by rab5) in the cell’s attempt to eliminate invading microorganisms.
