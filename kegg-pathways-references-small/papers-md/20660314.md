Aromatic compounds constitute the second most abundant class of organic substrates and environmental pollutants, a substantial part of which (e.g., phenylalanine or styrene) is metabolized by bacteria via phenylacetate. Surprisingly, the bacterial catabolism of phenylalanine and phenylacetate remained an unsolved problem. Although a phenylacetate metabolic gene cluster had been identified, the underlying biochemistry remained largely unknown. Here we elucidate the catabolic pathway functioning in 16% of all bacteria whose genome has been sequenced, including *Escherichia coli* and *Pseudomonas putida*. This strategy is exceptional in several aspects. Intermediates are processed as CoA thioesters, and the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-CoA becomes activated to a ring 1,2-epoxide by a distinct multicomponent oxygenase. The reactive nonaromatic epoxide is isomerized to a seven-member O-heterocyclic enol ether, an oxepin. This isomerization is followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage and β-oxidation steps, leading to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. This widespread paradigm differs significantly from the established chemistry of aerobic aromatic catabolism, thus widening our view of how organisms exploit such inert substrates. It provides insight into the natural remediation of man-made environmental contaminants such as styrene. Furthermore, this pathway occurs in various pathogens, where its reactive early intermediates may contribute to virulence.

enoyl-CoA hydratase | epoxide | oxepin | oxygenase | phenylacetic acid

Although first reports of aerobic phenylacetate-metabolizing bacteria appeared more than 50 y ago (10), the pathway itself remained enigmatic. The induction of a phenylacetate-CoA ligase in *Pseudomonas putida* under aerobic conditions was reported 2 decades ago (11). That report suggested an unconventional strategy for an oxygen-dependent metabolism using CoA-thioesters as intermediates (12). The ligase gene was found to be clustered together with 13 other phenylacetic acid (*paa*) genes in three transcriptional units, which were suspected to be involved in phenylacetate assimilation (13). Moreover, many of these genes were mandatory for growth on this substrate (14). A similar gene organization was reported in *E. coli* (15) (Fig. 1A) and in several *Pseudomonas* species (13, 16, 17); the high sequence similarity allows the prediction of a similar structure and function of the homologous proteins in these organisms. It is the only known bacterial aerobic degradation pathway for phenylacetate and is the most common for phenylalanine.

Many attempts to identify pathway intermediates other than phenylacetyl-CoA led only to rough outlines (14, 18–20). We set out to elucidate the pathway for phenylacetate degradation by producing purified enzymes coded by the *E. coli* K12 and *Pseudomonas* sp. strain Y2 *paa* gene clusters. This widespread catabolic pathway differs fundamentally from known aromatic catabolic pathways and involves the use of CoA thioesters throughout, epoxide formation, isomerization of the epoxide to an oxepin, and hydrolytic ring cleavage.

## Results

The use of ${}^{13}$C- and ${}^{14}$C-labeled phenylacetate (Fig. 1B, compound I) was key to investigating this long-standing problem. These compounds were chemically transformed or enzymatically converted to phenylacetyl-CoA (Fig. 1B, compound II) using phenylacetate-CoA ligase (PaaK, the first enzyme of the pathway). Products were detected by UV and radioactivity detection and identified by ${}^{13}$C-NMR spectroscopy, assisted by mass spectrometry.

### Epoxidation of the Aromatic Ring

Phenylacetyl-CoA is the substrate of a presumed multicomponent oxygenase, PaaABCDE. This oxygenase is a key enzyme of the pathway, proposed to be responsible for the introduction of oxygen into the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-CoA (6, 14, 21). First we cloned the five genes encoding this enzyme. The genes for all subunits were expressed

(B) Reactions and intermediates of the pathway as studied in *E. coli* K12 and *Pseudomonas* sp. strain Y2. Proposed enzyme names (Table S1): 1: phenylacetate-CoA ligase (AMP forming); 2: ring 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase (NADPH); 3: ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA isomerase (oxepin-CoA forming), postulated 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA isomerase. 4: oxepin-CoA hydrolase/3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP⁺); 5: 3-oxoadipyl-CoA/3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA thiolase; 6: 2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA hydratase; 7: 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA dehydrogenase (NAD⁺) (probably (S)-3-specific). Compounds: I, phenylacetate; II, phenylacetyl-CoA; III, ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA; IV, 2-oxepin-2(3H)-ylideneacetyl-CoA; V, 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA; VI, 2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA; VII, acetyl-CoA; VIII, 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA; IX, 3-oxoadipyl-CoA; X, succinyl-CoA.

simultaneously with PaaA as a maltose-binding protein (mbp)-tagged protein. Purification carried out through amylose resin chromatography. Subunits PaaB, PaaC, and PaaE copurified with PaaA, whereas PaaD, a suspected subunit of this complex, eluted separately. The purified PaaABCE complex catalyzed a phenylacetyl-CoA-induced and strictly oxygen-dependent NADPH consumption in a spectrophotometric assay with ≈1 μmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein, implying phenylacetyl-CoA oxygenase/reductase activity. The product derived from phenylacetyl-CoA was highly unstable and was purified using reverse phase (RP)-HPLC (Fig. 2A and B). Mass spectrometry showed the incorporation of a single oxygen atom, suggesting the complex acts as a monooxygenase (Table 1). To identify PaaABC(D)E unambiguously as an oxygenase, we applied ¹⁸O-labeling studies and showed the incorporation of a single ¹⁸O atom from ¹⁸O₂ (Table 1). In contrast, no labeled oxygen was introduced to the ring when H₂¹⁸O was used in the assay, clearly demonstrating the monooxygenase activity of PaaABC(D)E. ¹³C-NMR analysis substantiated ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA (Fig. 1B, compound III) as the product (Table 2). Further proof was provided by derivatization of the epoxide (Table 1). PaaABC(D)E thus functions as a ring 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase. Interestingly, the ability of PaaABC(D)E to oxy-

genate its substrate was largely lost within 5 min in an enzymatic assay. The multicomponent oxygenase thus appears to have been inactivated by its reactive epoxide product. To test a possible impact of PaaD on phenylacetyl-CoA oxygenation, we added purified mbp-tagged PaaD separately to the activity tests. The addition of the preparation did not affect the specific activity of PaaABCE significantly.

C–C Bond Cleavage Through Isomerization. The *paaG* and *paaZ* knockout mutants of *E. coli* released 2-hydroxyphenylacetate when cultivated on phenylacetate (14), probably because of the decomposition of ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA. Therefore these genes probably are involved in early steps of the pathway. We purified his-tagged PaaG and found that it catalyzed a reversible conversion of the epoxide to a new product (Fig. 2C) that exhibited the same mass as the epoxide (Table 1). ¹³C-NMR spectroscopy identified this isomer as an unusual unsaturated, oxygen-containing, seven-member heterocyclic enol ether, namely 2-oxepin-2(3H)-ylideneacetyl-CoA (oxepin-CoA) (Fig. 1B, compound IV and Table 2). PaaG therefore acted as a ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA isomerase (oxepin-CoA-forming).

Hydrolytic Ring Cleavage of the C–O Heterocycle. PaaZ is the most likely candidate for the ring-cleavage reaction. It is a fusion protein consisting of a C-terminal MaoC-like domain and an N-terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase domain. MaoC-like Hotdog-fold proteins act as R-specific hydratases (22). Addition of purified mbp-tagged PaaZ to enzymatically produced epoxide and oxepin (in the presence of PaaG) led to a complete NADP⁺-dependent conversion of epoxide and oxepin into 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA (Fig. 1B, compound V, and Fig. 2D), as shown by mass spectrometry (Table 1) and ¹³C-NMR spectroscopy (Table 2). PaaZ thus functioned as an oxepin-CoA hydrolase/ 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehyde dehydrogenase catalyzing the two-step conversion of the oxepin-CoA via the open-chain aldehyde intermediate to 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA (Fig. 1B). This oxepin-CoA ring cleavage was affected by PaaZ with a specific activity of ≈20 μmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein.

β-Oxidation of the Ring-Opened Intermediates. PaaJ, a β-ketothiolase, probably transforms the resulting β-keto C₈ intermediate with CoA to the C₆ intermediate dehydroadipyl-CoA (Fig. 1B, compound VI) and acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1B, compound VII) (14), besides catalyzing the last step of the pathway, in which 3-oxoadipyl-CoA similarly is cleaved to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. This last function has been shown previously (19). To test if the C₈ compound also is a substrate for the β-ketothiolase, we added purified PaaJ to an enzymatic assay containing PaaABC(D)E, PaaG, and PaaZ. A complete conversion of 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA into 2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1B) with accompanying CoA consumption was demonstrated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 2E). The identity of the products was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Table 1) and ¹³C-NMR spectroscopy (Table 2).

PaaF is an enoyl-CoA hydratase. Purified PaaF, when added to the assay (Fig. 2E), catalyzed the reversible conversion of enzymatically produced 2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA into 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA (Fig. 1B, compound VIII and Fig. 2F), evidenced by mass spectrometry (Table 1). This analysis identified PaaF as a 2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA hydratase (Fig. 1B), in accordance with previous suggestions (14).

PaaH is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. To clarify the last steps of the aerobic phenylacetate pathway, we added purified mbp-tagged PaaH to enzymatically produced 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA. We observed the formation of NADH, succinyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA in the presence of CoA, NAD⁺, and PaaJ (Fig. 2G). PaaH therefore functioned as an NAD⁺-dependent [probably (S)-3-specific] 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA dehydrogenase forming 3-oxoadipyl-CoA (Fig. 1B, compound IX). PaaJ finally cleaved 3-oxoadipyl-CoA into the central metabolites

The initial reaction mixture (0.25 mL) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM CoA, 1 mM NADPH, 1 mM NADP⁺, and 0.8 mg of PaaABC(D)E. The reaction was started by addition of 0.5 mM phenylacetyl-CoA. The products were separated by RP-HPLC and detected at 260 nm. (A) Control without PaaABC(D)E. (B) Three minutes after substrate addition (ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA). (C) Three minutes after addition of 10 μg PaaG (oxepin-CoA). Because of an inactivation of the enzymes (likely through nonconverted epoxides), a second reaction mixture (0.4 mL) was used for the following samples. From the start of the reaction it contained PaaABC(D)E, as above, and 10 μg of PaaG and 30 μg of PaaZ. (D) After 2 min (3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA). (E) Four minutes after addition of 7 μg PaaJ (2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, consumption of CoA). (F) Three minutes of incubation with 2 μg of PaaF (3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA). (G) Three minutes of incubation with 16 μg of PaaH, 0.5 mM CoA, and 1 mM NAD⁺ (succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA). The PaaH product 3-oxoadipyl-CoA is directly converted by PaaJ and therefore is not shown.

significant difference between these two members of this superfamily. Whereas the isomerase PaaG shows a conserved aspartic acid, PaaF lacks this aspartic acid but harbors two strictly conserved glutamic acids, which have been shown to be essential in the incorporation or elimination of water in rat enoyl-CoA hydratase (26) (Fig. S1).

In total, the formation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA and one molecule of succinyl-CoA from phenylacetate follows the equation: 1 phenylacetic acid + 1 O₂ + 2 H₂O + 3 CoA + 1 ATP + 1 NAD⁺ → 2 acetyl-CoA + 1 succinyl-CoA + 1 AMP + 1 PPᵢ + 1 NADH + 1 H⁺.

**Functions of Other Gene Products of the Paa Cluster.** PaaI is predicted to be a thioesterase, and its gene is part of the conserved paa gene cluster. It has been shown that PaaI acts on hydroxylated phenylacetyl-CoA substrates but poorly on aliphatic CoA-esters; i.e., it acts preferentially on early rather than late intermediates of the pathway (30). Natural substrates thus could be ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA, the subsequent oxepin-CoA [PaaABC (D)E and PaaG products], or the breakdown product 2-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA. Because of the instability of the epoxide, such a salvage reaction could be vital for the bacteria to avoid CoA depletion resulting from the formation of the dead-end product 2-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA. PaaX has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor in *E. coli*, with phenylacetyl-CoA as a specific inducer that prevents PaaX from binding its target sequences (31). PaaY is a protein of unknown function resembling acetyltransferases. Because it is located within the same transcriptional unit as PaaX, a role in regulation seems likely, possibly by inactivating PaaK, the phenylacetate-CoA ligase, through acetylation. A similar mechanism recently has been shown for anaerobic benzoate-CoA ligase in *Rhodopseudomonas palustris* (32). PaaY therefore may down-regulate phenylacetate degradation on the enzymatic level, allowing rapid metabolic adjustment in response to increased acetyl-CoA levels.

**CoA-Thioesters in Aerobic Aromatic Catabolism.** Why are the intermediates of this pathway processed as CoA-thioesters? Anaerobic catabolism profits from the electron-withdrawing character of thioesters, which facilitates ATP-dependent or other energy-driven reduction of the aromatic system. In aerobic catabolism, oxygen is used to dearomatize and cleave the ring. Use of CoA-esters in an aerobic aromatic degradation pathway therefore may appear futile at first glance. However, the PaaG-mediated oxepin formation is facilitated by the CoA-ester, as discussed above. Furthermore, CoA-bound intermediates are retained within the cell and can be recognized rapidly and bound through CoA-binding motives of the processing enzymes. This rapid recognition and binding could be particularly important for the highly reactive intermediate ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA, because free epoxides would harm the cell.

**Virulence Through Reactive Pathway Intermediates.** Recently, connections between virulence and gene products of the phenylacetate catabolism have been shown in *Burkholderia cenocepacia* and have been proposed in *Mycobacterium abscessus* (33–35); both organisms cause severe and often fatal lung infections in cystic fibrosis or immunocompromised patients. The *paaE* knockout mutants of *B. cenocepacia* were unable to survive in a rat pulmonary infection model (34), and knockout of *paaA* or *paaE* genes led to an attenuated phenotype in a *Caenorhabditis elegans* model. In contrast, knockout of *paaZ* or *paaF* increased virulence slightly (35). Therefore, accumulation of early products of phenylacetate degradation probably has toxic effects on the host. Ring-1,2-epoxide and its phenolic breakdown product 2-hydroxyphenylacetate are obvious candidates for causing such damage. It is an intriguing question whether secretion of such substances contributes to host cell death, which would supply feed stock for the pathogen. Arguments for the toxicity of these compounds come from the very similar chemistry of benzene metabolism in humans. Cytochromes P450 are known to metabolize benzene to benzene-epoxide that equilibrates spontaneously with the oxepin. Further ring opening yields reactive aldehydes (36). Those compounds and also the spontaneous phenolic breakdown product of benzene-oxide are known to be reactive toward proteins and DNA and are potentially carcinogenic (37). Even more intriguing is the demonstration that catabolic gastrointestinal activities of gut bacteria leading to the formation of phenols are causal factors for leukemia (38). Therefore phenylacetate catabolism of *E. coli* and other (micro)aerobic gut bacteria may contribute to forms of de novo leukemia.

**Relevance and Distribution of the Reported Strategy.** Is this pathway ephemeral or is it of major importance? It is the only proven pathway for aerobic phenylacetate degradation in bacteria, a central key intermediate of aromatic catabolism; moreover, phenylalanine generally is metabolized via phenylacetate. Conserved genes of the phenylacetate pathway have been identified thus far in 16% of the sequenced bacterial species, strongly indicating its relevance (Fig. S2). These species include many members of Proteobacteria, such as the model organisms *E. coli* or *P. putida* (13, 15), pathogens such as *Bordetella pertussis, Shigella dysenteriae*, or opportunistic pathogens such as *B. cenocepacia*. Gram-positive organisms such as *Rhodococcus sp.* or members of the *Deinococcus/Thermus* group also make use of this route (6, 7) (Fig. S2). This pathway evolved in the bacterial domain, because the

only Archaea harboring key genes of the pathway are some members of the Halobacteria, which may have acquired a multitude of bacterial genes (39).

Is this strategy restricted to the metabolism of phenylacetate? We suppose that a similar type of aerobic benzoate metabolism also involves CoA thioesters, ring epoxy, and possibly oxepin intermediates as well as a hydrolytic ring cleavage. This benzoate pathway occurs in many bacteria, showing again the wide usage of the strategy (40). Therefore, this paradigm for aromatic degradation probably is widespread and closes a substantial gap in our understanding of how microorganisms exploit inert substrates and how metabolism may trigger virulence in certain pathogens.

### Materials and Methods

Recombinant enzymes from *Escherichia coli* (PaaZ, PaaH) or *Pseudomonas sp.* strain Y2 (PaaABC(D)E, PaaG, PaaJ, PaaF) were tagged with His₆, His₁₀, or mbp and purified accordingly via Ni²⁺-affinity or amylose resin chromatography. Labeled [U-¹⁴C, U-¹³C]phenylacetate was derived from L-[U-¹⁴C]phenylalanine or L-[U-¹³C, ¹⁵N]phenylalanine, and labeled or unlabeled phenylacetyl-CoA was synthesized chemically from the activated precursor phenylacetyl succinimide or enzymatically using phenylacetate-CoA ligase.

Enzymatic activity of PaaABC(D)E was determined at 30 °C by following NADPH consumption in a photometric assay at 365 nm after the addition of phenylacetyl-CoA. In addition, activities and product formation of PaaABC(D)E, PaaG, PaaZ, PaaJ, PaaF, and PaaH were tested by RP-HPLC with optical detection between 200–400 nm. A C18-E column was used to separate CoA-esters using an acetonitrile gradient in ammonium acetate buffer. The initial reaction mixture (0.25 mL) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM CoA, 1 mM NADPH, 1 mM NADP⁺, and 0.8 mg PaaABC(D)E. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 mM phenylacetyl-CoA. When the effect of PaaD on phenylacetyl-CoA transformation was tested, the assay included in addition 0.1 mg of mbp-tagged PaaD. Further enzymes were added step by step.

For mass spectrometry, fractions of product peaks from RP-HPLC runs were injected into a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. ¹³C-labeled intermediates were acquired through enzymatic conversions of [U-¹³C]-phenylacetyl-CoA by PaaABC(D)E, PaaG, PaaZ, and PaaJ. Labeled intermediates were prepared by RP-HPLC and subsequently analyzed by ¹³C-NMR using a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer.

The BLASTP searches were performed via the NCBI BLAST server ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST)) with the amino acid sequences of PaaA and PaaC as queries against assembled bacterial genomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi)). A BLASTP search was performed with PaaA and PaaC against 640 completely sequenced bacterial genomes.

The exact procedures of cloning and heterologous expression of genes from *E. coli* K12 and *Pseudomonas sp.* strain Y2, enzyme purification, enzyme measurements, syntheses, identification of compounds, and all other methods are described in *SI Materials and Methods*.
