## SUMMARY

Abscisic acid (ABA) is a major phytohormone involved in important stress-related and developmental plant processes. Recent phosphoproteomic analyses revealed a large set of ABA-triggered phosphoproteins as putative mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) targets, although the evidence for MAPKs involved in ABA signalling is still scarce. Here, we identified and reconstituted *in vivo* a complete ABA-activated MAPK cascade, composed of the MAP3Ks MAP3K17/18, the MAP2K MKK3 and the four C group MAPKs MPK1/2/7/14. *In planta*, we show that ABA activation of MPK7 is blocked in *mkk3-1* and *map3k17mapk3k18* plants. Coherently, both mutants exhibit hypersensitivity to ABA and altered expression of a set of ABA-dependent genes. A genetic analysis further reveals that this MAPK cascade is activated by the PYR/PYL/RCAR-SnRK2-PP2C ABA core signalling module through protein synthesis of the MAP3Ks, unveiling an atypical mechanism for MAPK activation in eukaryotes. Our work provides evidence for a role of an ABA-induced MAPK pathway in plant stress signalling.

## INTRODUCTION

Abiotic stresses such as drought, high salinity, temperature or hypoxia are severe environmental stresses that impair productivity in crop systems (Wang *et al.*, 2003; Tuteja, 2007; Qin *et al.*, 2011). They trigger many biochemical, molecular and physiological changes and the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a major role in the adaptation to these challenges (Seki *et al.*, 2002; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2006; Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2007). Recently, the core signalling complex that perceives ABA and transmits cues to downstream events has been deciphered (Fujii *et al.*, 2009; Ma *et al.*, 2009; Park *et al.*, 2009): Pyrabactin Resistance/Pyrabactin resistance-like/Regulatory Component of ABA Receptor (PYR/PYL/RCARs) function as the ABA receptors, Protein Phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs) act as negative regulators, and SNF1-related protein kinases 2 (SnRK2s) are positive regulators (Mustilli *et al.*, 2002; Park *et al.*, 2009; Umezawa *et al.*, 2009). In the presence of ABA, PYR/PYL/RCAR-PP2C complex formation leads to inhibition of PP2C activity (Fujii *et al.*, 2009; Ma *et al.*, 2009; Park *et al.*, 2009; Santiago *et al.*, 2009), thus allowing activation of SnRK2s, which target membrane proteins, ion channels and transcription factors, and facilitate transcription of ABA-responsive genes (Sheard and Zheng, 2009; Umezawa *et al.*, 2010; Soon *et al.*, 2012).

Other signalling pathways have also been implicated in ABA signal transduction. Among them, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) modules are of particular interest as they are known to be involved in stress signalling. A MAPK module is minimally constituted of three kinases, a MAP3K (or MAP2K Kinase), a MAP2K (or MAPK Kinase) and a MAPK, which are able to phosphorylate and thereby activate each other sequentially. These kinases belong to large families, for which we have incomplete functional information. A number of the MAPK components have been clearly involved in biotic and abiotic signal transduction (for review, Rodriguez et al., 2010). But for a large number of these kinases, only sparse evidence is available on their physiological functions. MKK3, which displays an atypical MAP2K structure, has been reported to act on MPK7 (Doczi et al., 2007) and MPK8 (Takahashi et al., 2011) to mediate ROS signalling and to regulate MPK6 in response to jasmonic acid, Salmonella typhimurium infection and blue light (Takahashi et al., 2007; Schikora et al., 2008; Sethi et al., 2014).

The direct activation of MAPKs by ABA has been reported for several plant species (for review, Danquah et al., 2014). In Arabidopsis, studies showed that MPK1 and MPK2 activity increased after ABA treatment (Ortiz-Masia et al., 2007; Hwa and Yang, 2008; Umezawa et al., 2013). Xing et al. (2008) demonstrated the ABA-dependent MKK1-mediated activation of MPK6 to regulate CATALASE1 (CAT1) expression in ROS homeostasis. MPK9 and MPK12, two MAPKs that are preferentially expressed in guard cells, were shown to mediate ABA-induced guard cell closure (Jammes et al., 2009). The role of these kinases, and particularly the connection between MAPK modules and the ABA core signalling pathway, is of primary interest but still a matter of debate. Recently, phosphoproteomic analyses revealed a significant fraction of ABA-induced phosphosites as potential MAPK targets (Umezawa et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013).

In the present work, we report the identification of an entire ABA-dependent MAPK pathway. We show that ABA induces two functionally redundant MAP3Ks, MAP3K17 and MAP3K18, to activate the MAPKK MKK3 which subsequently stimulates the activity of the four C group MAPKs: MPK1, MPK2, MPK7 and MPK14. Our genetic analysis confirms that the ABA-dependent MAPK pathway plays a role in ABA stress signalling.

### RESULTS

#### mkk3-1 plants are hypersensitive to ABA in germination and root elongation

Our previous work showed that MKK3 functions during pathogen perception and ROS signalling (Doczi et al., 2007). In an attempt to identify other MKK3 functions, the *mkk3-1* mutant and a line expressing a constitutively active version of MKK3 (named *MKK3-EE*) were subjected to ABA treatments. The ABA-insensitive line *hab1G246D* (Robert et al., 2006) was used as control. In germination assays, *mkk3-1* knock-out seeds were hypersensitive to increasing ABA concentrations when compared with WT whereas *MKK3-EE* seeds were less sensitive (Figure 1a,b). As ABA is involved in osmotic stress signalling, we also performed germination assays on high salt (150 mM NaCl) and mannitol (300 mM) conditions. Similarly, we observed hypersensitivity of *mkk3-1* seeds and insensitivity of *MKK3-EE* seeds (Figure S1). We also evaluated the ABA root growth sensitivity of these lines. *mkk3-1* plantlets grown in the presence of 1 μM ABA showed significantly stronger inhibition of root elongation than WT plantlets while in this assay, *MKK3-EE* roots did not show significant differences compared with WT (Figure 1c). These data suggest that the MKK3-dependent MAPK pathway could mediate ABA signalling during germination and root elongation.

MKK3 acts upstream of the C group MAPKs in protoplasts

Previous reports showed that MKK3 acts upstream of the C group MAPK MPK7 and interacts with the 4 MAPKs of this clade (Doczi *et al.*, 2007; Lee *et al.*, 2008). MKK3 was also published to act upstream of MPK6 and MPK8 (Takahashi *et al.*, 2007, 2011; Sethi *et al.*, 2014). To identify which of the six MAPKs were activated by MKK3, we expressed these MAPKs as HA-tagged proteins in mesophyll protoplasts prepared from *mkk3-1* leaves in the presence or absence of a Myc-tagged constitutively active MKK3 (MKK3-EE). After MAPK immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the HA epitope, the activity of the MAPKs was assayed by their ability to phosphorylate the heterologous substrate Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) (Figure 2a). The activity of MPK2, MPK7, MPK14 and in a lesser extent MPK1 was observed only when co-expressed with MKK3-EE. In contrast, MPK6 and MPK8 showed a detectable basal activity in *mkk3-1* protoplasts that was not significantly affected by MKK3-EE. These results confirm that MKK3 is an activator of the C group MAPKs.

C group MAPKs are activated by ABA in an MKK3-dependent manner

MPK1 and MPK2 were shown to be activated by ABA *in planta* (Ortiz-Masia *et al.*, 2007; Umezawa *et al.*, 2013). To test whether other C group MAPKs could be activated by ABA, we expressed MPK1, MPK2, MPK7 and MPK14 as HA-tagged proteins in WT Col-0 mesophyll protoplasts and subjected them to ABA treatment before performing kinase assays with the HA-immunoprecipitated MAPKs (Figure 2b). The four kinases were activated by ABA after 1 h. In order to evaluate whether the ABA-dependent activation of the MAPKs was mediated by MKK3, we used *mkk3-1* mesophyll protoplasts to express HA-tagged MPK7 with (or without) upstream WT Myc-tagged MKK3 and performed an ABA treatment. When MPK7 was co-expressed

with MKK3, its activity was stimulated by ABA (Figure 2c). Importantly, in the absence of MKK3, no MPK7 kinase activity was detectable even in the presence of ABA, although MPK7 was equally expressed in all samples. Similarly, the other MAPK members of the C clade (MPK1, MPK2 and MPK14) were also activated by ABA in an MKK3-dependent manner (Figure S2a). This ABA-dependent MAPK activation correlated with the increased phosphorylation of the TEY motif in the MAPK activation loop, suggesting that MKK3 activated the MAPKs through TEY phosphorylation, as expected in a functional MAPK module (Figure S2b).

In order to test whether MPK7 is activated by ABA *in planta*, we used an anti-MPK7 specific antibody (Doczi et al., 2007) to immunoprecipitate the endogenous MPK7 kinase and measure its activity on MBP. *In vitro* grown 10-day-old Col-0 and *mkk3-1* plantlets were treated with 50 μM ABA for 2, 4 or 6 h. In WT, we observed an ABA-dependent increase of MPK7 activity that was totally abolished in *mkk3-1* mutant (Figure 2d). As this slow ABA activation of MPK7 could result from an ABA-dependent transcriptional induction of MPK7, we performed qRT-PCR analysis in WT and *mkk3-1* backgrounds upon ABA treatment. MPK7 gene expression was indeed up-regulated by ABA, reaching a maximum of expression at 4 h (Figures 2e and S3). Interestingly, this transcriptional regulation was independent of MKK3 as it still occurs in the *mkk3-1* mutant background (Figure 2e). This suggests that MPK7 activation by ABA can be uncoupled from the transcriptional regulation of the MPK7 gene. All together, these results identify MKK3 as the critical MAP2K that activates MPK7 in response to ABA.

### The ABA core signalling module is required for MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 expression

We then attempted to identify the MAP3K(s) which could act upstream of MKK3 in the ABA signalling pathway. We hypothesised that such kinases could be transcriptionally regulated by ABA and performed a bioinformatic analysis using publicly available transcriptomic databases. Among the 20 Arabidopsis MEKK-like MAP3K genes, MAP3K17 (At2g32510) and MAP3K18 (At1g05100) showed induction by ABA and osmotic stresses (Figure S4), suggesting that they could act as ABA signal transducers in the context of abiotic stresses. A phylogenetic analysis of the Arabidopsis MEKK-like genes showed that the MEKK family is organised in three distinct subclades (Figure S5). MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 belong to a poorly characterized atypical subset of eight members (referred to as clade III): this clade encodes rather short kinases with small carboxy-termini. Interestingly, clade III genes do not have any introns whereas MEKK-like kinases from clades I and II always have more than eight introns and mostly code for larger proteins (Figure S5). Moreover, the sequence similarity of

pairs of clade III MAP3Ks suggested that these genes might function in a redundant manner. To confirm the ABA-triggered expression of MAP3K17 and 18, we performed qRT-PCR analysis on 2-week-old *in vitro* grown Col-0 plantlets after treatment with 50 μM ABA (Figure 3a,b). ABA induced a strong accumulation of MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 transcripts peaking at 4 h. Similar results but with lower intensity were obtained when plantlets were subjected to 300 mM mannitol or 150 mM NaCl (Figure S6a,b).

The main ABA signalling cascade, referred to as the core signalling module, consists of the ABA receptor, an SnRK2 kinase and a PP2C phosphatase (Fujii et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2009; Park et al., 2009). To test whether the ABA-dependent expression of MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 is regulated

through this pathway, we performed ABA treatments on the quadruple mutant of the ABA receptor, pyr1pyl1pyl2-pyl4, and the hab1G246D line expressing a dominant ABI1-like mutation of the HAB1 phosphatase (Robert *et al.*, 2006; Park *et al.*, 2009) (Figure 3c,d). The ABA-triggered accumulation of MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 transcripts observed in Col-0 plantlets was almost abolished in the two ABA-insensitive genotypes. Similar results were observed when plants were treated with 150 mM NaCl (Figure S6c,d). These results show that ABA- and salt-induced MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 expression depends on the ABA core signalling module.

MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 physically interact with MKK3 in yeast and *in planta*

To investigate whether MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 could be upstream activators of MKK3, we first tested if these kinases could interact with MKK3 in yeast. We performed yeast two-hybrid experiments using the MAP3Ks fused to the GAL4 Activation Domain (AD) and the 10 MAP2Ks fused to the GAL4 Binding Domain (BD). Yeast co-transformed with MKK3 and the two MAP3Ks were the only combinations able to grow on selective media (Figure S7a). To confirm that MAP3K17/18-MKK3 interactions also occur *in planta*, we used Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) assays. MKK3 was fused to the C-terminal half of YFP (YFPC) and MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 to the N-terminal half of YFP (YFPN) before expression in pair-wise combinations in agro-infiltrated leaves of *Nicotiana benthamiana*. Using confocal microscopy, we observed a functional cytoplasmic YFP signal in epidermal cells (Figure S7b). As positive and negative controls, we took advantage of the

specific interaction between MKK2 and MPK4 which occurs largely in the same compartment (Gao *et al.*, 2008). In our expression system, MKK2 interacted with MPK4 but not with MAP3K17 or MAP3K18 and MPK4 did not interact with MKK3 (Figure S7b). All together, these results suggest that the two MAP3Ks specifically interact with MKK3 *in planta*.

MAP3K17/18-MKK3-MPK7 defines a functional MAPK cascade *in vivo*

To test whether the interaction detected between MAP3K17, MAP3K18 and MKK3 in yeast and in *N. benthamiana* is biologically functional for the activation of MKK3, we co-expressed tagged versions of MAP3K17, MAP3K18 and MKK3 with MPK7-HA in *mkk3-1* mesophyll protoplasts. MPK7-HA was immunoprecipitated and its activity was assayed *in vitro* on MBP. In contrast with MKK3-EE, WT MKK3 alone was barely able to activate MPK7 (Figure 4a), suggesting that MKK3 needs to be first activated by an upstream component in the MAPK cascade. When MKK3 was expressed with either MAP3K17 or MAP3K18, MPK7 became highly active, indicating that MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 are indeed functional upstream activators of the MKK3 pathway. As MPK7 activation did not occur when MKK3 was omitted or replaced by another MAP2K, MKK1 (Figure S8), the MAP3K-dependent activation of MPK7 is specifically mediated by MKK3. Taken together, these results indicate that MAP3K17/18-MKK3-MPK7 constitutes a functional MAPK signalling module in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts.

To test whether the MAP3K17/18-MKK3 module could act upstream of other MAPKs, we co-expressed MAP3K18 and MKK3 with six HA-tagged MAPKs in *mkk3-1* mesophyll

protoplasts. The MAPKs were immunoprecipitated and assayed for kinase activity on MBP (Figure 4b). As with MPK7, a stronger activity was observed for MPK1, MPK2 and MPK14 when co-expressed with both MKK3 and MAP3K18, whereas these MAPKs expressed alone or with only one of the two upstream kinases displayed barely detectable activities. MPK6 was also more active in the presence of MAP3K18 but independently of MKK3 co-expression, suggesting that MAP3K18 activates MPK6 via other MAP2Ks. In contrast, MPK8 activity was not affected by MAP3K18 or MKK3 expression (Figure 4b). These results indicate that the MAP3K17/18-MKK3 module can activate all members of the C group MAPKs MPK1, MPK2, MPK7 and MPK14.

### ABA-induced activation of the MKK3-MPK7 module depends on MAP3K18

As ABA induces the expression of MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 (Figure 3) and constitutive expression of the MAP3Ks activates MKK3-MPK7 in protoplasts (Figure 4), we hypothesised that the ABA induction of endogenous MAP3Ks could be sufficient to activate the MKK3-MPK7 module. To test this hypothesis, we generated double mutant plants with T-DNA insertions in both MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 genes (Figure S9a). The characterization of the T-DNA insertion sites in these lines suggested that the insertion in the MAP3K18 gene results in a loss-of-function allele whereas the insertion at the very end of the MAP3K17 coding region might correspond to a knock-down as the truncated protein still possessed residual functionality in yeast (Figure S9b–d). We also complemented the map3k17map3k18 mutant with MAP3K18 fused to YFP under the control of its own promoter (Figure S9c,e). We performed mesophyll protoplast assays with these two genotypes to analyse the requirement of the MAP3Ks on ABA-dependent MPK7 activation. In the map3k17map3k18 background, ABA was unable to activate MPK7 even when co-expressed with MKK3 (Figure 5a). Importantly, the ABA activation of MPK7 was restored in the MAP3K18-YFP complemented line, and correlated with the accumulation of MAP3K18-YFP protein upon ABA treatment, as observed in the immunoblot with anti-GFP antibody (Figure 5a). These results demonstrate that MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 mediate the ABA-dependent activation of the MKK3-MPK7 module through ABA-induced de novo transcription and protein synthesis of the two MAP3Ks.

### ABA-triggered MPK7 activation is impaired in map3k17map3k18 plants and blocked by the inhibition of translation

We then wanted to confirm that the MAP3Ks function upstream of the ABA-dependent MKK3-MPK7 pathway *in planta*. In vitro grown map3k17map3k18 plantlets were subjected to ABA treatment before immunoprecipitation of

endogenous MPK7 with the anti-MPK7 specific antibody. As previously observed in mkk3-1 (Figure 2d), MPK7 activation was compromised, although not abolished, in map3K17map3K18 mutant plantlets (Figure 5b). The expression of a YFP-tagged MAP3K18 in the map3K17-mapk3K18 background restored the ABA-dependent activation of MPK7 in plantlets (Figure 5c). Consistently with the impaired ABA induction of MAP3K17/18 in the mutants of the ABA core signalling module (Figure 3), the ABA-dependent MPK7 activation was blocked in hab1G246D plants (Figure 5d). In addition, MPK7 activation correlates with MAP3K18 protein accumulation induced by ABA with respect to both its timing (Figure 5e) and its dose dependency (Figure 5f). These results confirm that the MAP3Ks are critical upstream components for the ABA-dependent activation of MPK7 and validate the conclusion that the MAPK module MAP3K17/18-MKK3-MPK7 is activated by ABA.

Whereas MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 are activated by stresses within minutes (Ranf *et al.*, 2011), corresponding to a fast post-translational activation mechanism, the ABA-dependent activation of MPK7 takes considerably longer (Figure 5b,e). The slow ABA-dependent MPK7 activation is compatible with the requirement of the *de novo* transcription and protein synthesis of the upstream MAP3Ks. To test this hypothesis, we used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on the MAP3K18-YFP complemented line. Incubation with 100 μM cycloheximide 1 h before ABA treatment completely abolished MPK7 activation by ABA (Figure 5g) and was correlated with the absence of MAP3K18 protein accumulation. Despite the fact that cycloheximide might also affect other pathways, these data support the hypothesis that MAP3K18 *de novo* production is a critical step for the activation of the C group MAPKs in response to ABA.

### The MKK3 module is controlling genes involved in response to abiotic stresses

Next, we wanted to test whether the MAPK module was involved in ABA-mediated gene regulation. We thus performed a transcriptome analysis of Col-0 and mkk3-1 plants in mock conditions or upon treatment with 50 μM ABA for 4 h (Figure S10a). When compared with wild-type in resting conditions, 58 genes were shown to be up-regulated and 89 genes to be down-regulated in mkk3-1 mutant plants, considering a two-fold change as cut-off (Figure 6a and Table S1). Based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis of these genes, we found enrichment in stress response genes (Figure S10b). Conversely, among the up-regulated genes, we also found an enrichment for ‘seed development’ and ‘embryonic development ending in seed dormancy’, suggesting that these genes might be connected to the observed germination phenotype of the mkk3-1 mutant (Figure 1).

ABA in an MKK3-dependent manner (Figure S10d). To test whether the whole MAPK module was involved in this ABA gene regulation, we compared the expression of the six selected target genes in Col-0, *mkk3-1*, *map3k17map3k18* and *map3K17map3K18-MAP3K18locus-YFP* plantlets upon treatment with 50 μM ABA for 6 h (Figure 6c). We confirmed the impaired ABA-dependent expression in *mkk3-1* and showed the same tendency, although to a lesser extent, in *map3K17map3K18* mutants, while the expression of MAP3K18locus–YFP largely complemented the misregulation. Altogether, these results show that a set of ABA-regulated abiotic stress genes depends on the MAPK module.

### DISCUSSION

The ABA core signalling pathway, composed of PYR/PYL receptors, PP2Cs and SnRK2s (Fujii et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2009; Park et al., 2009), controls a first and rapid wave of cellular responses, such as the stomatal pore closure through the modulation of plasma-membrane channel activities (Kim et al., 2010). ABA also modulates the expression of a large set of nuclear genes, including MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 (Leonhardt et al., 2004). In this work, we report the identification of an entire MAPK cascade, composed of MAP3K17/18, MKK3 and the C group MAPKs MPK1/2/7/14, which is activated by ABA via the ABA core signalling module.

#### A MAPK module with an atypical mode of activation by ABA

MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 belong to a monophyletic clade of MEKK-like MAP3Ks whose functions are still unknown. We confirmed that MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 are highly induced by ABA (Leonhardt et al., 2004), which was compromised in mutants of the ABA core signalling module. By yeast two-hybrid analysis against all MAP2Ks, we identified MKK3 as the only MAP2K interacting with MAP3K17 and MAP3K18. MKK3 harbours a C-terminal Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2) domain whose function is still unclear. All currently known plant genomes contain only one gene coding for such an MKK3-like MAP2K, indicating that this fusion occurred early and is conserved during evolution. MKK3 has been previously reported to regulate JA, Salmonella, ROS and blue light signalling (Doczi et al., 2007; Takahashi et al., 2007, 2011; Schikora et al., 2008; Sethi et al., 2014) but its involvement in ABA responses has not been reported so far, highlighting the importance of this MAP2K in plant stress signalling. Our results show that a loss-of-function of MKK3 totally abolished ABA-dependent MPK7 activation, indicating that this MAP2K is an important actor of the ABA-triggered MAPK pathway. MPK1 and MPK2, which belong to the C group MAPKs, were previously reported to be activated by ABA but the activation mechanism remained unclear (Ortiz-Masia et al., 2007; Umezawa et al., 2013). MPK1 and MPK2 are members of the group C MAPKs, and we show that all members of this group, namely MPK1, MPK2, MPK7 and MPK14, are activated by ABA in an MKK3-dependent manner. This redundant activation of four MAPKs by ABA is intriguing. One possibility is that they have similar roles in different cell types. Alternatively, despite being activated by the same MAP2K, the four MAPKs could phosphorylate distinct targets. This last hypothesis is supported by the PAMP-activated MAPK model in which MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 were shown to have both specific and shared targets (Frei dit Frey et al., 2014). Identifying the targets of each MAPK and studying the single mapk mutant phenotypes will help to solve these questions. Previous studies have shown that MKK3 also regulates MPK6 and MPK8 activities (Takahashi et al., 2007; Schikora et al., 2008). Although we could not confirm these data in our assays, it is likely that MKK3 can activate MPK6 or MPK8 under other culture conditions or developmental stages.

Interestingly, we found that activation of the ABA-triggered MAPK pathway depends on the transcription and protein synthesis of the MAP3Ks MAP3K17 and MAP3K18. As far as we know, such an activation mechanism has not been reported for a MAPK module neither in plants nor in animals, adding a level of complexity to MAPK signalling. Classical activation of MAPKs occurs within minutes upon stress stimulation, as observed for MPK3/4/6 in response to flg22 (Ranf et al., 2011), and involves post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation. Although we observed a slow and long-lasting activation of MPK7 by ABA, this does not exclude the possibility that MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 are additionally activated through PTMs. Importantly, mutations in the ABA core signalling SnRK2s abolished ABA activation of MPK1 and MPK2 (Umezawa et al., 2013), confirming our data that the ABA core machinery is required for the activation of the MAP3K17/18-MKK3-MPK1/2/7/14. Interestingly, previous studies reported faster kinetics for ABA-dependent MPK1 and MPK2 activation, which could be more compatible with a protein synthesis-independent mechanism (Ortiz-Masia et al., 2007; Umezawa et al., 2013). A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy could be that different developmental and experimental conditions might precondition ABA-triggered MKK3-dependent MAPK activation. Future experiments will have to show whether the transcriptional upregulation of the MAP3Ks might also be part of a feed forward loop to produce a long-term signal that is required for a persistent adaptation response to the prevailing stress conditions.

#### The MAP3K17/18-MKK3-MPK7 cascade modulates ABA responses

We showed that *mkk3-1* knock-out plants are hypersensitive to ABA during germination and root elongation, while the constitutively active 35S-MKK3-EE line was insensitive. By contrast, Hwa and Yang (2008) reported ABA hypersensitivity of estradiol-inducible MKK3-EE lines.

These opposite results may come from differences in the biological material or the technical setup of the experiments. Importantly, *map3k17 map3k18* displayed enhanced ABA inhibition of root growth, although not as strong as *mkk3-1* mutant (Figure S11). This result is consistent with the observation that ABA-triggered MPK7 activation is totally abolished in the *mkk3-1* background but only reduced in *map3k17 map3k18* mutants. However, the *map3k17-1* T-DNA insertion line does not correspond to a total loss-of-function allele and can thereby explain the weaker phenotype. An alternative possibility that we cannot exclude is that other MAP3Ks, such as MAP3K19, could redundantly act upstream of MKK3.

In an attempt to decipher what the downstream targets of the ABA-triggered MAPK pathway are, we performed a transcriptome analysis of *mkk3* mutant plants in the absence or presence of ABA. In mock conditions, we observed a general enrichment for genes involved in stress responses (Figure 6). However, the down-regulated genes in *mkk3-1* showed a specific role in defense responses, which is consistent with previous results demonstrating that *mkk3-1* is more susceptible to bacterial infection (Doczi et al., 2007). On the other hand, the set of up-regulated genes in *mkk3-1* plants was enriched for genes involved in seed development and more specifically in 'embryonic development ending in seed dormancy' (Figure 6), in correlation with the germination phenotype observed for *mkk3-1* and *MKK3-EE* in response to ABA and abiotic stresses. In response to ABA, our transcriptome analysis revealed a set of 377 ABA-regulated MKK3-dependent genes with functions enriched in response to different abiotic stimuli such as osmotic stress or temperature variation (Figure 6). The ABA induction of those genes was abolished or reduced in *mkk3-1* and *map3K17-*

ABA-activated MAPK cascade in Arabidopsis 241

*map3K18* mutants, while the complementation with the MAP3K18locus-YFP in the double mutant background restored the ABA responsiveness.

ABA is also known to be the major hormone involved in abiotic stress signalling. Coherently, *mkk3-1* knock-out plants were also hypersensitive to germination under salt and osmotic stress conditions (Figure S1). Interestingly, dehydration was shown to trigger MPK7 activation and MAP3K17/18 expression in an ABA-dependent manner, which was correlated with higher water loss in *mkk3-1* and *map3k17 map3k18* mutants when subjected to a 10-day drought treatment (Figure S12). Taken together, these results suggest that the MAPK module functions in ABA signalling in response to multiple abiotic stresses.

### CONCLUSIONS

The discovery of an ABA-activated MAPK pathway completes our understanding of the ABA signalling in plants. Our results support the concept (Figure 7) that the ABA core signalling pathway controls a first and rapid wave of cellular responses, including a large transcriptional reprogramming (Sirichandra et al., 2010; Yoshida et al., 2010), that precedes a second wave of late responses involved in stress adaptation. Our data indicate that MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 belong to the set of genes that are regulated by the ABA core signalling module, resulting in long-term activation of C group MAPKs by MKK3. This MAPK module might thereby contribute to generate a robust signal to induce ABA-dependent responses in persisting stress conditions. In support of this hypothesis, recent phosphoproteomic studies revealed a number of ABA-induced phosphosites in transcription factors and protein kinases among the potential MAPK targets (Umezawa et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), including various receptor-like kinases, the protein kinases AKIN10, PHOT1, PHOT2, SnRK2.10 and the transcription factors ZIGA4, GT2, GTL1, GRF4, RAP2.7 and WRKY18. Clearly, the phosphorylation of these protein kinases and transcription factors could contribute to regulate changes in the physiology and metabolism under long-lasting stress conditions. Analysis of the role of this ABA-activated MAPK module and its target proteins should provide valuable information on the complex mechanism of plant stress adaptation and should help to enhance crop stress tolerance that will be crucial for a future sustainable agriculture.

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Table S2 provides the sequences of all primers used during this work.

#### Plant material

Details of the *pyr1pyl1pyl2pyl4*, *hab1G246D*, *mkk3-1* and *MKK3-EE* lines have been published previously (Nambara and Marion-Poll, 2005; Robert et al., 2006; Doczi et al., 2007; Park et al., 2009). *map3k17-1* (Salk_137069) and *map3K18-1* (Gabi_244G02) were identified from a publicly available T-DNA collection.

The MAP3K18 locus upstream (3017 bp) or downstream (683 bp) of the STOP codon was amplified using iProof (Bio-Rad, http://www.bio-rad.com/) from Col-0 genomic DNA using a specific 3K18Locus5F/3K18Locus5R and 3K18Locus3F/3K18Locus3R pair of primers. The YFP ORF was amplified with the primer set (YFP_F/YFP_R) from pEXCS-GW-mYFP-nls (kindly provided by Dr Jane Parker). PCR fragments were cloned into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega, http://worldwide.promega.com/) and, using *KpnI*, *PstI* and *NotI* restriction enzymes, the MAP3K18 locus was reassembled in the pGREEN0229 vector (Hellens et al., 2000) to generate the pGREEN0229-MAP3K18locus. Then, the YFP DNA fragment was cloned into the unique *PstI* site to build the pGREEN0229-MAP3K18locus-YFP. The vector was transformed into *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* strain C58C1 containing pSOUP helper plasmid (Hellens et al., 2000). Kanamycin-resistant Agrobacteria were then used to transform *map3k17-1 map3k18-1 Arabidopsis* plants using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Segregation analysis was performed to identify an homozygous line for both insertions.

### Germination assay and root elongation assay

For *in vitro* culture, seeds were sterilized in 70% ethanol, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (10 min) washed twice in 96% ethanol and dried before use. Seeds were sown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (½MS) plates and stratified for 3 days at 4°C before being transferred to a growth chamber (16 h light, 8 h night, 22°C).

For germination assays, the ½MS plates contained either ethanol (ABA mock), ABA (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/), NaCl (Sigma) or mannitol (Sigma). Germination was considered as occurring when a radicle was detectable under the stereomicroscope.

For root growth assays, the ½MS plates contained either 0.002% ethanol (mock) or 1 μM ABA. Growth was performed vertically for 7 days to facilitate the measurement of root length using IMAGEJ software after scanning the plates (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

### Gene expression analysis

For ABA treatment, plantlets were grown *in vitro*, in 6-well plates containing 4 ml ½MS 0.9% agar for 9 days. Then, 4 ml liquid ½MS were added to the plants that were equilibrated for 24 h before treatment with 0.2% ethanol, 50 μM ABA (Sigma), 150 mM NaCl or 300 mM mannitol. Plants were collected at indicated times and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extraction with DNase treatment was performed using the RNeasy plant mini kit and RNase-Free DNase Set following manufacturer’s recommendations (Qiagen, https://www.qiagen.com). RNA quantification and quality was measured in a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, http://www.thermoscientific.com/). cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using oligo(dT) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, http://www.lifetechnologies.com/) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR reactions were carried out in 10 μl final volume with 1 μl of 10 times diluted reverse transcription (RT) reaction, 100 nM final concentration of each primer and SYBR FAST Universal qPCR kit (Kapa Biosystems, http://www.kapabiosystems.com/). *ACTIN2* was used as a reference gene. All reactions were done in a CFX384 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD) as follows: 95°C for 30 sec; 40× (95°C for 5 sec and 60°C for 20 sec); and a dissociation step to validate the PCR products. All reactions were performed with three technical replicates.

For transcriptomic analysis, the F2 progeny from an *mkk3-1* backcrossed in Col-0 were used to minimize the effect of putative side mutations. Col-0 (MKK3/MKK3) and *mkk3-1* seeds (>50 per condition) were grown in 25 ml ½MS, 1% sucrose (16 h light, 8 h night, 70% humidity, 22°C) for 12 days. Plantlets were then treated with ABA (50 μM) or mock (ethanol) for 4 h. Samples were collected in liquid nitrogen and ground. Three independent biological replicates were produced. RNAs were extracted using Qiagen kits as above. Microarray analysis was carried out using the CATMAv7 array based on AGILENT technology (Methods S4).

### Gateway cloning to generate pDONR vectors

PCR reactions were performed using iProof (Bio-Rad). ORFs were amplified from cDNA (if introns) or genomic DNA and recombined in pDONR207 using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen), following the protocol kindly provided by Lurin and co-workers (http://www-urgv.versailles.inra.fr/atome/protocols.htm). Chimeric ORFs as predicted from *map3k17-1* and *map3k18-1* loci were amplified with 3K17_ORF_F/3K17_ORFtr_R and 3K18_ORF_F/3K18_ORFtr_R couples of primers, respectively, and *map3k17-1 map3k18-1* DNA as amplification matrix. Clones with and without a stop codon were identified allowing N- and C-terminal protein fusions and carefully sequenced.

### Kinase assays using mesophyll protoplasts

Protoplasts from the different backgrounds were isolated and transfected as previously reported (Yoo et al., 2007), using three types of effector constructs: MAP3K–YFP, MKK-Myc and MPK-HA. Constructs for MKK3-Myc and MKK3-EE-Myc were described previously (Doczi et al., 2007). To generate MPK-HA constructs, MPK1, MPK2, MPK6, MPK7, MPK8 and MPK14 ORFs from pDONR207 vector were recombined in pHaGW7 using LR enzyme mix (Invitrogen). For MAP3K–YFP, MAP3K17 and MAP3K18 ORFs from pDONR207 vector were recombined in p2FGW7. Typically, 0.4 ml protoplasts at a density of 2 × 10^5/ml were transfected with 50 μg total DNA including the three effectors constructs (MAP3K–YFP, MKK-Myc and MPK-HA) in equal amount. Protoplasts were collected 14 h after transfection. For ABA treatment, transfected protoplasts were incubated for 14 h for protein expression before treatment with 30 μM ABA or mock ethanol for 3 h. For kinase assays, proteins were extracted in immunoprecipitation buffer [50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM orthovanadate, cocktail anti-protease 1× (Roche, http://www.roche.com/)], 2 mM DTT, 1% Triton X100, 150 mM NaCl). The protein extract was recovered after centrifugation at 20 000 g at 4°C for 5 min. The MPK-HA was immunoprecipitated with 1 μl anti-HA antibody (Sigma) at 4°C for 2 h, and an additional 1 h after addition of 20 μl of 50% slurry protein A-sepharose (GE Healthcare, www.gehealthcare.com/). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer and twice in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT. The kinase assay was performed for 30 min at RT in 15 μl reaction buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 μM cold ATP) supplemented with 2 μCi [γ-33P]ATP and 1 μg MBP per reaction. The reaction was stopped with SDS loading buffer, heated at 95°C for 5 min and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. The radioactive MBP was detected on dried gels using a Phosphor imaging system (GE Healthcare). The expression level of epitope-tagged proteins was monitored by immunoblots with anti-HA, anti-Myc and anti-GFP antibodies on the same transfected protoplasts directly extracted with SDS loading buffer.

### Kinase assays using plantlets

For ABA-induced MAPK activation, plantlets were grown vertically on ½ MS plates containing 1% sucrose (16 h light, 8 h night, 22°C)

for 12 days. Plantlets were transferred in liquid medium for equilibration. Then plantlets were treated with 0.1% ethanol (mock) or 50 μM ABA (Sigma). To stop treatments, plantlets were rapidly dried and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

For drought experiment, plantlets were grown in ½ MS plates containing 1% sucrose, for 15 days (16 h light, 8 h night, 22°C). Then, the plates were unsealed and equilibrated under a fume hood overnight. Drought stress was performed by removing the lid. In these conditions, the medium loses 50% of its water in 5 h. Kinase assays were performed as previously described (Ortiz-Masia *et al.*, 2007). Briefly, samples were homogenized using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) and proteins were extracted in extraction buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 20 mM NaF, 0.05% Triton, cocktail anti-protease 1× [Roche]). The protein extracts were recovered after centrifugation at 20 000 g at 4°C for 5 min and normalized to a concentration of 4 μg μl⁻¹ using Bradford. For immunoprecipitation, 300 μg of proteins were incubated with 7 μl anti-MPK7 antibody (Doczi *et al.*, 2007) and 20 μl of 50% slurry protein A-sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the extraction buffer and once with kinase buffer (30 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate). The kinase assay was performed for 30 min at RT in 15 μl reaction buffer (kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μM cold ATP, 1 μg μl⁻¹ MBP and 2 μCi [γ-³³P]ATP per reaction). The reaction was stopped with SDS loading buffer, heated at 95°C for 5 min and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. The radioactive MBP was detected on dried gels using a Phosphor imaging system (GE Healthcare). When necessary, the expression level of MAP3K18-YFP was monitored by immunoblots with anti-GFP antibody.
