ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade through recruitment of adapter proteins, such as the Shc/Grb2/Sos complex, which activate the small G protein, Ras [11, 13–19]. Depending on the GPCR agonist and cell type, Ca²⁺, PKC, G protein βγ subunits, and non-receptor tyrosine kinases including Src and Pyk
previously described [32]. The radioactivity in each sample was measured by liquid β scintillation spectroscopy. Data indicate the mean CPM from four wells at each time point.

Cells were grown on glass cover slips at low density, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and stained with anti-HA antibody against GnRH-R followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The same cell also shows green labeling of
