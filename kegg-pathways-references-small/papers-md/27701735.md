Abstract

The gene PINK1 [phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1] encodes a serine/threonine kinase which was initially linked to the pathogenesis of a familial form of Parkinson’s disease. Research on PINK1 has recently unravelled that its multiple functions extend well beyond neuroprotection, implicating this eclectic protein in a growing number of human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiopulmonary dysfunctions and inflammation.

Extensive studies have identified PINK1 as a crucial player in the mitochondrial quality control pathway, required to label damaged mitochondria and promote their elimination through an autophagic process (mitophagy). Mounting evidence now indicates that PINK1 activities are not restricted solely to mitophagy, and that different subcellular and even sub-mitochondrial pools of PINK1 are involved in distinct signalling cascades to regulate cell metabolism and survival. In this review, we provide a concise overview on the different functions of PINK1 and their potential role in human diseases.

Keywords: PINK1, Parkinson Disease, neurodegeneration, cancer, serine-threonine kinase, mitochondria, autophagy, mitophagy.

Introduction

The PINK1 gene was initially identified in 2001 as an up-regulated target of PTEN in endometrial cancer cells [1], but only in 2004 did this gene come into the spotlight when recessive mutations of PINK1 were found to cause early-onset Parkinson Disease (EOPD) [2]. The large number of mutations subsequently reported in several families worldwide made PINK1 the second commonest cause of autosomal recessive EOPD after Parkin [3].

Apart from the early onset (usually <45 years) and the slow disease progression with sustained beneficial response to levodopa, the PINK1-related phenotype was often reported as indistinguishable from idiopathic PD [4], with occasional additional features such as dystonia at onset, levodopa-induced dyskinesias and psychiatric disturbances [3, 5]. Interestingly, PINK1 single heterozygous mutations were detected in a number of sporadic PD patients as well as in controls displaying very mild signs of parkinsonism or subclinical manifestations, supporting the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of PINK1 may represent a susceptibility factor for PD [6, 7].

After the first study showing a neuroprotective role against proteasomal inhibition [2] research on PINK1 has increased impressively, unravelling multiple distinct functions beyond neuroprotection, that have implicated this eclectic protein widely in cancer development, regulation of metabolism, cardiac function, and inflammation.

PINK1 processing and stability

PINK1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed 581 amino acids protein containing a N-terminal mitochondrial leader peptide (MTS), a transmembrane domain and a vast highly conserved serine-threonine kinase domain [2, 8, 9]. In healthy cells, the full length 63 kDa PINK1 protein (PINK1-FL) is imported to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) via the TIM/TOM translocases complex [10]; here, PINK1-FL undergoes a sequential processing

operated by IMM proteases (MPP, m-AAA, ClpX and PARL), producing an N-terminal
cleaved isoform which is released into the cytosol. Cytosolic PINK1 is then stabilized, likely
through the interaction with molecular chaperones, or degraded in a proteasome-
dependent manner through the N-end rule pathway [11-14]. Due to this process,
endogenous PINK1 is constitutively maintained at very low levels in cells with
physiologically polarized mitochondria.

Conversely, a massive, selective accumulation of PINK1-FL at the outer mitochondrial
membrane (OMM) is observed following mitochondrial depolarization, misfolded protein
accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix, or treatment with OXPHOS inhibitors or PD-
related toxins [15]. The exact mechanism by which PINK1 is stabilized on damaged
mitochondria is controversial: one possibility is represented by the inactivation of IMM
proteases due to the dissipation of membrane potential [16-19]; an alternative model
suggests that PINK1-FL is entrapped into a 700 kDa TOM complex at the OMM, separated
from the IMM proteases [10]. Finally, two novel interactors (SARM1 and TRAF6) have
been implicated in PINK1 K63-linked ubiquitination and stabilization [20]. On the OMM,
PINK1 undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation, required for its complete
activation and mitochondrial quality control functions [10, 21-23].

It is now clear that, depending on its subcellular localization, PINK1 is able to finely
regulate both mitochondrial and cytosolic pathways implicated in cell survival and
metabolism. In the next sections we will briefly review the role of differently located pools
of PINK1 in coordinating multiple cellular functions and their relevance to human
pathology.

# PINK1 functions in health and disease

## PINK1 and neurodegeneration

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the commonest neurodegenerative disorders, affecting >1% of the population over 60 years; its motor phenotype, characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability, reflects the progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons [24, 25]. Diagnostic hallmarks of PD are Lewy bodies; cytoplasmic inclusions within surviving neurons containing α-synuclein, ubiquitin and other proteins [26]. Autopsy studies have reported classical Lewy body pathology in PINK1-mutated patients, confirming that PINK1 mutations induce a neurodegenerative process similar to PD [27, 28].

Several studies have consistently demonstrated the protective role of PINK1 against neuronal death induced by several stress conditions, such as those induced by proteasomal inhibition [2, 29, 30], staurosporine [31-34], ceramide [35], oxidative stress [36-41], endoplasmic reticulum stress [42], mitochondrial inhibitors [43-46] and growth factor withdrawal [47, 48]. More specifically related to PD, PINK1 overexpression was found to protect neurons exposed to the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPTP [49, 50], and to ameliorate reduced mobility and lifespan in a Drosophila PD model overexpressing mutant α-synuclein [51]. A neuroprotective activity of PINK1 was implicated not only in the context of PD but also in other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, including Alzheimer's disease [52], multiple sclerosis [53], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [54] and Huntington's disease [55]. Importantly, similar functional defects leading to neuronal death, mainly consisting in mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment of intracellular clearance systems underlie all of these disorders. The efficient functioning of these pathways is essential, especially in neurons which face high levels of reactive oxygen species due to

their strong reliance on mitochondrial OXPHOS; moreover, being long-living post-mitotic cells, neurons are unable to dilute the toxic effects of damaged proteins through the cell cycle, and therefore require perfectly working quality control mechanisms [56].

However, several PINK1-KO mouse models have failed to display loss of dopaminergic neurons nor obvious PD phenotypes, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms able to cope with PINK1 deficiency [57, 58]. Even two-year-old mice that were triple KO for PINK1/Parkin/DJ-1 (the three main genes causative of autosomal recessive EOPD) did not show abnormalities in dopamine metabolism or signs of neurodegeneration. These observations find a likely explanation in the mouse lifespan being too short to reach a threshold of damage sufficient to manifest an overt phenotype [59]. Indeed, dopaminergic neurodegeneration was observed in PINK1-KO mice upon α-synuclein- or MPTP-induced toxicity, indicating an increased susceptibility to both cellular and environmental stress [60, 61]. In contrast to the mouse model, PINK1-KO rats present progressive nigral neurodegeneration and significant motor deficits even in basal conditions [62]. Similar observations were made in PINK1-mutant Drosophila, which displayed dopaminergic loss, locomotive dysfunction and reduced lifespan [63-65].

In the following paragraphs we will review the experimental evidence of the many neuroprotective activities of PINK1, both when it accumulates on depolarized mitochondria and when it is cleaved within mitochondria and then exported back into the cytosol. All these pathways are schematically summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1.

# The role of PINK1 in depolarized mitochondria

## Mitochondrial quality control: mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in most neurodegenerative disorders, leading to increased oxidative stress, reduced ATP production and decreased cell survival.

To preserve a population of healthy mitochondria and avoid cell death, neuronal mitochondria are subjected to stringent quality control processes, that impact on mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion/fission, trafficking and removal. For instance, dysfunctional mitochondria inactivate their fusion machinery to avoid incorporation of altered metabolites into healthy organelles. In parallel, enhanced fission generates daughter mitochondria with different fates: organelles with higher membrane potential re-enter the network, whereas depolarized mitochondria are arrested, detained in perinuclear clusters and ultimately removed through autophagy [66, 67]. Upon oxidative stress, the selective removal of oxidized mitochondrial proteins without eliminating the entire mitochondrial pool can also be mediated by a different pathway, where mitochondrial derived vesicles (MDVs) deliver the altered cargo to lysosomes for degradation [68].

PINK1 was found to act as a key biological sensor of mitochondrial dysfunction that flags depolarized mitochondria by selectively accumulating on their surface and recruiting Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin-ligase also mutated in EOPD. The first evidence that PINK1 and Parkin could work in a common pathway came from genetic complementation studies in Drosophila. Both PINK1- and Parkin-KO flies displayed profound aberrations in mitochondrial morphology, characterized by enlarged/elongated or swollen organelles with fragmented cristae, and reduced mtDNA content and ATP production. This phenotype could be rescued in both cases by over-expression of Parkin, which placed it genetically downstream of PINK1 [63-65]. Further studies revealed that the PINK1-Parkin axis plays a major role in the selective degradation of depolarized mitochondria through the autophagy

pathway, an essential process termed “mitophagy” [69-76]. The molecular mechanism leading to Parkin recruitment on mitochondria was long debated [77-80]. Recently, three independent groups reported that ubiquitin is directly phosphorylated by PINK1 and may represent the Parkin receptor on the OMM, required for its translocation [79, 81, 82]. The subsequent K48- and K11-linked ubiquitination of Mfn1/2 and Miro by Parkin rapidly induces their proteasomal degradation, preventing mitochondrial trafficking and fusion with healthy organelles [83, 84]. In parallel, K63-linked ubiquitin chains are recognized by proteins of the autophagy receptors family (p62, NDP52, NBR1, TAX1BP1 and optineurin), which bind to LC3/GABARAP family members attached to the autophagosomal membranes; in this manner, the autophagy machinery is selectively recruited in proximity of depolarized mitochondria to promote their engulfment by autophagosomes and fusion with lysosomes [85-87]. Of note, regulation of mitochondrial quality control by the PINK1/Parkin axis also includes the MDVs pathway [88].

Interestingly, mitophagy mediated by endogenous PINK1 and Parkin was also shown to occur in mouse primary hippocampal neurons without the addition of depolarizing agents [89]. Moreover, human fibroblasts and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of PINK1-mutated patients failed to induce Parkin recruitment on mitochondria [90, 91], underlying the physiological relevance of the PINK1-Parkin axis in regulating mitophagy.

### Parkin-independent regulation of mitophagy

Besides its well established function to recruit Parkin onto damaged mitochondria, a novel role has recently emerged for PINK1 in regulating autophagy, an essential homeostatic process aimed at clearing misfolded or aggregated proteins and ensuring organelle turnover. We first showed that PINK1 promotes both basal and starvation-induced autophagy, and directly interacts with the key pro-autophagic protein Beclin1 [92]. More

recently we found that, upon mitochondrial depolarization, PINK1 selectively accumulates  
to specific sites of contact between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria (MAM,  
mitochondria associated membranes), where it recruits Beclin1 to initiate autophagosome  
formation (Gelmetti et al, unpublished observations). This is an essential step to form the  
membranes that will engulf damaged mitochondria or other cellular debris, before their  
fusion with lysosomes for enzymatic digestion [93], and is pivotal not only for mitophagy  
but for all autophagic processes. Moreover, a recent study on depolarized mitochondria  
showed that PINK1 is also able to activate a Parkin-independent cascade leading to the  
recruitment of several early autophagy factors to focal spots proximal to mitochondria [85].  
These findings clearly suggest that PINK1 can activate mitophagy (and possibly  
autophagy at large) through a number of distinct and parallel pathways.

Anti-apoptotic function

While part of the antiapoptotic activity of PINK1 could be explained by the mitophagic  
removal of damaged mitochondria before they trigger the apoptotic cascade, other  
mechanisms have also been advocated. We recently demonstrated that, upon  
mitochondrial depolarization induced by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone  
(CCCP), PINK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates serine 62 of Bcl-xL, a main anti-  
apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family highly expressed in neuronal cells.

The anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-xL is largely mediated by its N-terminal BH4 domain,  
which is able to preserve the mitochondrial membrane potential and block cytochrome c  
release by inhibiting the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) activity. Pro-apoptotic  
stimuli such as CCCP induce cleavage of Bcl-xL at the aspartate 61, generating a C-  
terminal fragment that potently stimulate apoptosis, and this cleavage is hampered by  
PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-xL at the nearby serine 62 [46]. Accordingly,

pharmacological activation of PINK1 by the ATP-analog Kinetin Tri-Phosphate (KTP) was found to enhance PINK1-mediated Bcl-xL phosphorylation and reduce CCCP-induced apoptosis [94].

### Regulation of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis

Alterations of intramitochondrial calcium levels have been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including PD [95]. Different studies demonstrated a role for PINK1 in the regulation of this pathway. Depletion of PINK1 in both human and mouse neurons increased the amount of mitochondrial calcium, likely related to impairment of the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger and consequent reduction of calcium efflux from mitochondria [96]. While physiological levels of mitochondrial calcium sustain oxidative metabolism and ATP production, excessive amounts of intramitochondrial calcium are detrimental for respiratory chain function, inducing collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS production and mPTP opening [97]. In line with this, treatment with ruthenium red (a well-known inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uptake) significantly rescued the mitochondrial damage induced by PINK1 mutations [98]. Our recent finding that, upon mitochondrial depolarization, PINK1 selectively accumulates at the MAM, which are the sites where calcium is exchanged through the uniporter channel [99], strongly supports a central role for PINK1 in regulating calcium homeostasis, for which further studies are clearly warranted.

### The role of PINK1 within and outside mitochondria

Most of the preceding data relates to experimental conditions of massive and acute mitochondrial depolarization, that are not expected to occur in more physiological settings such as aging neurons. Yet, even cleaved PINK1 has been found to play neuroprotective roles both within the mitochondria and after cytosolic export.

Modulation of the respiratory chain activity

Complex I activity is impaired by parkinsonian stressors such as MPTP and rotenone, and was found to be reduced in the brains of sporadic PD patients [100, 101]. Many studies implicated PINK1 in mitochondrial metabolism; as demonstrated by impaired electron transport chain activity, reduced oxygen consumption and increased ROS in PINK1-depleted cells [37, 44, 58, 102-104]. In particular, decreased complex I activity was observed in several PINK1-null models, explaining the higher sensitivity of PINK1-deficient cells to complex I inhibitors [37, 60, 105-110]. One mechanism through which PINK1 could regulate complex I involves its direct phosphorylation of NADH Dehydrogenase Ubiquinone 1 alpha subcomplex 10 (NdufA10), a subunit required for ubiquinone reductase activity [111]. Another explanation may reside in the ability of PINK1 to regulate mitochondrial targeting and translation of certain nuclear mRNAs encoding respiratory chain components, including the complex I subunits C-I 30 and ND75 [112].

Other intramitochondrial targets of PINK1

In addition to substrates located on the OMM, PINK1 was found to interact with intramitochondrial proteins, such as the chaperone TRAP1 and the serine protease HtrA2. PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of TRAP1 protects mitochondria against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [36]. According to this notion, TRAP1 over-expression in PINK1-mutant Drosophila neurons rescued mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death [113]. Increased protection against mitochondrial stress could also be mediated by phosphorylation of HtrA2 and activation of its proteolytic activity, which in turn would remove damaged mitochondrial proteins. Indeed, mice lacking HtrA2 displayed accumulation of misfolded proteins and increased ROS levels in brain mitochondria, and loss of function HtrA2 mutations lead to neuronal death also in humans. Finally, HtrA2 represents a susceptibility

factor for PD and reduced levels of phospho-HtrA2 were observed in brains of PINK1-
mutated PD patients [114, 115].

### Neuroprotective functions of cytosolic PINK1

Growing evidence indicates that N-terminal truncated cytosolic PINK1 could promote neuron survival and differentiation [116]. Haque and colleagues first demonstrated that a PINK1 construct lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence (ΔN-PINK1), mainly localized in the cytosol, protected neurons against MPTP [49]. In line with this, cytosolic PINK1 rescued the reduced dendritic branching observed in PINK1-deficient neurons, likely by enhancing anterograde transport and density of mitochondria in dendrites.

Transfection of ΔN-PINK1 (but not of OMM-sequestered PINK1) in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells induced the expression of neuronal differentiation markers and promoted neurite extension, indicating divergent roles for cytosolic and mitochondrial PINK1 in modulating this phenotype [117]. Protein kinase A (PKA), which is known to regulate neurite outgrowth, spine formation and synaptogenesis through activation of the CREB transcription factor, seems to be involved in this process [118], as pharmacological inhibition of PKA represses dendritic branching induced by overexpression of cytosolic PINK1 [117].

PINK1 also activates the cytosolic mTORC2/Akt pathway, which is known to play a fundamental role in neuron survival by sustaining multiple trophic effects on dopaminergic cells, including axonal growth [39, 119].

In addition, cytosolic PINK1 was reported to suppress macroautophagy and mitophagy induced by chronic deficiency of endogenous PINK1 [120, 121]; LC3 phosphorylation, Akt activation or Parkin sequestration in the cytosol could be the downstream effectors.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
In the cytosol, PINK1 was also reported to form an E3-ligase complex with both Parkin and DJ-1 (PPD complex), promoting ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of aberrant Parkin substrates such as Synphilin-1, and possibly of Parkin itself [122].

Interestingly, both mitochondrial and cytosolic PINK1 retain the ability to protect against apoptosis and block neuronal death induced by several stress conditions; this supports the concept that different subcellular pools of PINK1 regulate distinct biological functions, with the common goal to promote neuronal function and survival.

### PINK1 and cancer

As mentioned before, PINK1 was first discovered as a gene modulated by the tumour suppressor PTEN in a cancer cell model [1]. Later on, a strong expression of PINK1 was observed in melanoma and colon carcinoma mouse cancer cell lines displaying high metastatic potential [123]. The subsequent investigations on PINK1 functions further reinforced these pioneering findings, highlighting its involvement in several aspects of cancer biology and metabolism. Interestingly, many of the pathways involved in neurodegeneration were also implicated in oncogenic transformation and cancer progression. According to this notion, epidemiological studies revealed a reduced risk of certain cancers in patients with PD [124]. Moreover, PINK1 has been identified as a fundamental element for tumour cell survival and chemoresistance in two independent RNA interference screens, making it a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment [125-127], and a recent meta-analysis in human ovarian carcinoma revealed that high PINK1 mRNA expression correlates with a poor outcome [128]. These findings are supported by several studies showing a major role for PINK1 in sustaining cell proliferation and resistance to death, by impacting fundamental processes such as cell cycle control, apoptosis, regulation of protein degradation systems, mitochondrial homeostasis and cell metabolism.

Cell cycle regulation

Several studies have reported a role for PINK1 in processes associated with cell cycle regulation. O'Flanagan and colleagues demonstrated that PINK1 is a positive regulator of cell cycle progression, promoting cell division and growth by altering G2/M and G0/G1 checkpoints. Deletion of PINK1 in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cancer cells induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase at cytokinesis and accumulation of multinucleated cells, indicative of defective mitosis; in turn, this translated into reduced cell proliferation, colony formation and migration. Cell cycle alterations induced by PINK1 silencing were linked to excessive mitochondrial fragmentation, confirming the relevance of mitochondrial dynamics for cell cycle progression [129]. Expression, mitochondrial recruitment and activity of Drp1, a key mediator of mitochondrial fission, are finely regulated throughout mitosis, with a strong increase during metaphase, to allow the equal distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells [130]. In PINK1-deficient cells, Drp1 levels were significantly higher compared to control cells, explaining the increased mitochondrial fragmentation and the cytokinesis defect, and Drp1 knockdown significantly rescued multinucleation caused by PINK1 deficiency [129]. The role of PINK1 in cell cycle progression could explain why PINK1 silencing was able to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs targeting mitotic cells [125]. In this light, inhibition of PINK1 combined with paclitaxel treatment might be effective synergistically to kill cancer cells.

Protection from apoptosis

Extensive literature has consistently pointed towards a protective role of PINK1 against apoptosis induced by different stressors, including chemotherapy-related compounds (see above). The increased cell death observed in PINK1-depleted cells is intimately linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, and therefore to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Indeed, by affecting many aspects of mitochondrial homeostasis, such as mtDNA levels,

mitochondrial membrane potential, electron transport chain and mitochondrial calcium, the  
downregulation of PINK1 results in decreased ATP synthesis and increased oxidative  
stress. In turn, ROS production facilitates the opening of mitochondrial permeability  
transition pore (mPTP), inducing cytochrome c release and activation of the apoptotic  
cascade [29, 33, 44, 96, 102]. A direct effect of PINK1 on proteins belonging to the family  
of the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 has been also reported. For instance, PINK1  
overexpression inhibits the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax upon proteasomal  
stress [30], whereas its silencing upregulates Bax and prevents the activation of Bcl-xL  
[127]. Moreover, the direct binding and phosphorylation of Bcl-xL (as discussed above)  
[46] could represent an anti-apoptotic mechanism involved not only in neurodegeneration  
but also in cancer. All these findings suggest that compounds targeting mitochondrial  
function coupled to PINK1 depletion could increase apoptosis and therefore represent a  
potential target for cancer treatment.

### Regulation of protein degradation systems

Alterations in the pathways of intracellular clearance are directly related to the  
pathogenesis of cancer. In recent years, the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) has been  
recognized as an essential mechanism that cancer cells employ to alter the balance  
between cell growth and death and to induce drug resistance. In fact, many UPS targets  
are regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle progression, DNA damage response, signal  
transduction and cell metabolism [131].

The role of autophagy in cancer is more complex and debated. On one hand, autophagy  
may act as a tumour-suppressor mechanism, by preventing accumulation of misfolded  
proteins and damaged organelles, and limiting DNA damage and chromosomal instability.  
On the other hand, the ability of autophagy to sustain cell survival in hypoxic conditions or  
under nutrient deprivation definitely supports tumour survival [132].

Several inhibitors of both UPS and autophagy have been approved for cancer treatment, confirming that repression of these protein degradation pathways represents a promising anticancer strategy. Thus, PINK1 could play a key role in regulating these cellular clearance systems not only in the context of neurodegeneration but also of cancer. This was already shown in cancer cell models, in which PINK1 deficiency impaired both proteasome activity and stress-induced autophagy, resulting in reduced cancer cell survival [48, 122].

On the other hand, cytosolic PINK1 was found to suppress autophagy and mitophagy (see above). This apparent discrepancy is paralleled by the controversial role of mitophagy in cancer. For tumours relying on mitochondrial activity to sustain their proliferation, inhibition of mitophagy represents a valid approach to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and promote cancer cell death: drugs affecting mitochondrial function would increase the need for functional mitophagy, therefore the combined action of mitophagy inhibitors may provide additional benefits in terms of tumour suppression. However, mitophagy inhibition induced by Parkin deficiency was associated to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphomas, indicating that some cancers are still able to survive despite the absence of functional mitochondria [133].

### Effect on mitochondrial and cell metabolism

Cancer cells usually rely on both glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism to sustain their proliferation. Mitochondria provide cells not only with ATP, but also with all the TCA cycle intermediates necessary to synthesize lipids, amino acids and nucleotides, which are all essentials to satisfy the bioenergetics demand of cancer. As a consequence, cancer cells display a strong activation of the electron transport chain [134].The role of PINK1 in regulating complex I activity has been already mentioned before.

Moreover, at least in cancer cells, PINK1 could facilitate the mitochondrial uptake of Ca²⁺, which in turn allosterically triggers several TCA cycle enzymes to sustain oxidative metabolism; accordingly, depletion of PINK1 significantly reduces Ca²⁺ entry into the mitochondrial matrix, decreasing mitochondrial metabolism [135]. Of note, a metabolic shift leading to enhanced ATP production by glycolysis, followed by increased lactic acidosis, was observed in PINK1-depleted or mutant cells [136-138]. Mechanistically, PINK1 deficiency could induce ROS-mediated activation of HIF1α, leading to increased glucose metabolism [139]. Loss of PINK1 also induced a compensatory metabolic reprogramming to fuel nucleotide pools and promote mitochondrial biogenesis [140].

### Tumour suppressor functions

Although the main functions of PINK1 clearly point to a proto-oncogenic role, tumour suppressive properties have been also proposed in some contexts. The *PINK1* gene is located on chromosome 1p36, a region frequently deleted in several cancers [141]; PINK1 expression is induced by PTEN and FOXO3a [1, 47], two tumour suppressors, and Parkin, which acts downstream of PINK1 itself, is also an oncosuppressor [142]. Meta-analysis of PINK1 mRNA levels in cancer datasets revealed a significant decrease of PINK1 expression in liver and renal carcinoma, as well as in several primary brain tumours; moreover, PINK1 heterozygous mutations have been identified in endometrial, oesophageal and ovarian cancer, as well as in neuroblastoma [38, 143, 144]. The discrepancy between oncogenic and oncosuppressor activities of PINK1 could be explained by the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells lacking PINK1 [138]. In parallel, PINK1 depletion significantly increased mitochondrial ROS production, known to activate signalling pathways close to the mitochondria to promote cancer cell proliferation and

tumorigenesis [145]. Accordingly, treatment of PINK1 knockdown cells with anti-oxidant compounds suppressed ROS and blocked the glycolytic shift and cancer cell growth [143].

### PINK1 and dysmetabolism

Mitochondrial dysfunction also represents a main feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes: altered mitochondrial dynamics, reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, decreased OXPHOS and excessive ROS production have all been proposed to play a key role in insulin resistance [146].

Scheele and colleagues first observed reduced PINK1 expression levels in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients [147]. This was also seen in heart of type 1 diabetics [148] and in diabetic brains, the latter leading to lipid-droplets accumulation and impaired oxidation of mitochondrial fatty acids [149]. Further confirming a role for PINK1 in lipid metabolism, PINK1-deficient primary adipocytes display decreased expression of the fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4), a lipid chaperone associated with reduced lipolysis, insulin resistance and obesity [150].

At a metabolic level, loss of PINK1 significantly inhibits glucose uptake by pancreatic β-cells and primary intact islets, and is accompanied by increased insulin secretion and enhanced glucose tolerance [151]. Importantly, the elevated glucose levels resulting from PINK1 deficiency suppress autophagy and induce β-cells apoptosis, an effect that can be rescued by PINK1 over-expression [152]. Supporting a protective role for PINK1 for β-cells under hyperglycaemic conditions, increased expression of both PINK1 and Parkin was observed in the adipose tissue of mice subjected to prolonged high-fat diet; this was followed by activation of mitophagy, aimed at avoiding oxidative stress and the development of diabetes [153]. In this light, pharmacological interventions targeting

mitochondrial quality control may represent promising approaches for the treatment of diabetes and obesity.

### PINK1 and heart defects

The heart is highly dependent upon mitochondria to produce ATP necessary for its function, and preservation of a functional mitochondrial pool is fundamental to maintain cardiomyocytes healthy [154]. Billia and colleagues first demonstrated an essential role for PINK1 in heart muscle homeostasis: PINK1 KO mice developed left ventricular dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy, leading to pressure overload-induced heart failure. Mitochondria from PINK1 KO hearts displayed altered morphology, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased OXPHOS, which in turn induced oxidative stress and increased cardiomyocytes apoptosis [155, 156]. Cardiac hypertrophy and contractile anomalies were also observed in hearts from mice genetically ablated for either PTEN or FoxO1/3, the two main transcriptional regulators of PINK1 expression; this was accompanied by reduced autophagy, decreased anti-oxidant capacity and induction of apoptosis [157, 158].

Mitochondrial fragmentation, apoptosis and myocardial infarction were also observed following E2F1-mediated activation of miR-421, known to suppress PINK1 translation in cardiomyocytes [159]. Through ROS production and mtDNA release in the cytosol, damaged mitochondria from cardiomyocytes subjected to myocardial infarction or acute ischemia/reperfusion injury may also stimulate cytokine production and activate the inflammatory response; in this light, removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by the PINK1-Parkin axis could represent a key cardioprotective mechanism before they cause further damage. Consistent with this hypothesis, mouse hearts lacking functional mitophagy developed cardiac defects with age [80]. Finally, Gong et al. recently discovered that PINK1-Parkin dependent mitophagy would be responsible for the degradation of

mitochondria in embryonic cardiomyocytes, regulating the metabolic transition from fetal to adult heart [160].

### PINK1 and inflammation

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by declining lung function and inflammation, mainly in response to cigarette smoke (CS), that triggers ROS generation in the airway epithelium. Therefore, the production of anti-oxidant scavengers, the remodelling of mitochondrial network and mitophagy represent key mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress and avoid apoptosis. According to this notion, PINK1 expression was found to be higher in COPD patients compared to control smokers [161-163].

The role of PINK1 and CS-induced mitophagy in COPD is controversial: findings from lto and colleagues suggested a protective role for PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy against COPD development, with PINK1 loss increasing ROS production and senescence in primary human bronchial epithelial cells [164]. Impaired mitophagy and cellular senescence in the lungs of smokers and COPD patients was also reported by a different group [163]. In cultured pulmonary epithelial cells and murine models, however, PINK1-induced mitophagy seemed to be detrimental for lung cells exposed to CS, leading to activation of the necroptosis pathway; in fact, genetic depletion of PINK1 or administration of necroptosis inhibitors protected against mitochondrial dysfunction, airspace enlargement, mucociliary clearance disruption and CS-induced cell death [162].

A role for PINK1 was also proposed in the development of lung fibrosis [165]. Knockdown of PINK1 in lung epithelial cells resulted in defective mitophagy, leading to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and expression of profibrotic factors; accordingly, low

expression of PINK1 was observed in alveolar type II cells from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and in aging lungs [166, 167].

Finally, PINK1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver inflammation due to infection with hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV - HCV), often evolving into chronic liver disease, steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [168]. Alteration of mitochondrial quality control and metabolism are frequently associated with HV infection, and mitophagy represents a crucial mechanism to promote cell survival and virus persistence. Both HBV and HCV were found to induce PINK1 expression and mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, while PINK1 or Parkin silencing impaired HV-induced mitophagy and delayed virus replication [169, 170].

Conclusions and future perspectives

Largely studied in the context of PD, PINK1 has progressively been identified as a key protein not only for neuronal survival, but also for the homeostasis of several other tissues.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the regulation of mitochondrial quality control, representing the most explored and attractive face of PINK1-mediated effects, operates together with other pro-survival pathways controlled by different subcellular pools of PINK1; this consideration suggests that several actors and pathways are simultaneously affected by loss of function mutations in the PINK1 gene, and these should be taken into account when designing therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring PINK1 activity. In this light, research on PINK1 needs to extend well beyond mitophagy and neurodegeneration to explore other aspects of PINK1 signalling, including cell metabolism and regulation of nuclear gene expression. With the help of high-throughput “Omics” approaches, this line of research is expected to allow the identification of specific metabolic signatures, transcriptional programs and protein interaction networks operating in physiological conditions and altered in the context of human diseases caused by alterations of PINK1 expression. With these notions, the modulation of PINK1 function in different cellular contexts may represent a promising therapeutic strategy not only for PD but also for cancer and other human disorders.

In healthy cells, full-length PINK1 is constitutively imported inside mitochondria and processed in a mature isoform by proteases of the inner mitochondrial membrane; at this level, PINK1 is able to sustain respiratory chain activity and ATP production by phosphorylating the complex I subunit NdufA10. Inside mitochondria, PINK1 also interacts with the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1 and with the protease HtrA2, both involved in stress resistance mechanisms. In parallel, a pool of cleaved PINK1 is exported into the cytosol and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner, or stabilized in functional complexes by the interaction with molecular chaperones (such as HSP90). Cytosolic PINK1 activates both the mTORC2/Akt and the PKA signalling pathways, initiating transduction cascades that culminate in autophagy/mitophagy inhibition and activation of neuronal branching. In the cytosol, PINK1 also form a complex with Parkin and DJ-1 (PPD

complex), involved in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of misfolded/damaged proteins.

Following mitochondrial damage, proteases of the inner mitochondrial membranes are inhibited and full-length PINK1 accumulates in a dimeric form on the outer mitochondrial membrane. PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Parkin and/or ubiquitin induces Parkin recruitment on the mitochondrial surface; the combined action of PINK1 and Parkin, through phosphorylation, ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal removal of Miro and Mfn2, leads to mitochondrial arrest and inhibition of mitochondrial fusion, respectively. In this manner, dysfunctional mitochondrial are put in quarantine and isolated from the healthy network before their elimination. To this aim, the extensive ubiquitination of the outer mitochondrial membrane by Parkin triggers the translocation of several members of the autophagy receptors on the surface of damaged organelles, finally leading to autophagosomes formation and mitophagy activation. PINK1 is also able to promote autophagosomes formation, independently of Parkin, by interacting with the pro-autophagic protein Beclin1 at mitochondria/ER contact sites (MAMs, mitochondrial associated membranes). At this level, PINK1 would also control the amount of intramitochondrial calcium by regulating the activity of Na⁺/Ca²⁺ channels. In parallel, PINK1 protects from apoptotic cell death induced by mitochondrial depolarization by phosphorylating Bcl-xL and impairing the formation of its N-terminal cleaved pro-apoptotic fragment. Through this mechanism, PINK1 would slow down cytochrome c release from damaged organelles (and the consequent fatal activation of caspases), waiting for their removal through mitophagy.
