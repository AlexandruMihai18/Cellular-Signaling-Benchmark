## INTRODUCTION

In nature acetate is a key intermediate in bacterial anaerobic degradation of organic matter (89). Biological processes of formation, utilization, and disposal of acetate are therefore of considerable interest to microbiologists, biochemists, and ecologists. Acetate is a product of fermentation of various organic materials. It is also formed by a synthesis from CO₂ and/or other one-carbon precursors. Bacteria that produce acetate are often termed ace-

togens. However, in the usage of this term different ways of acetate formation are not distinguished. This review emphasizes the synthesis of acetate from one-carbon compounds, and the term acetogen is reserved for bacteria that catalyze this synthesis.

In 1932, Fischer et al (41) noticed that a bacterial culture obtained from sewage sludge could synthesize acetate from CO₂ with molecular hydrogen as reducing agent. In 1940, Wieringa (151) described *Clostridium aceticum*, which converts sugars to acetate and synthesizes acetate from CO₂ and H₂. However, not much work was done with *C. aceticum*, and the organism was considered lost until Braun et al (14) recently revived it from a spore preparation found stored in the laboratory of H. A. Barker. Consequently, the most detailed studies of acetate synthesis from CO₂ have been performed with *Clostridium thermoaceticum* (73, 83, 84), which was discovered in 1942 (42) and was the only acetogen available until 1967.

*C. thermoaceticum* completely converts sugars, e.g. glucose and xylose, to acetate (Reactions 1 and 2).

\[
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 \rightarrow 3\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \quad 1.
\]

\[
2\text{C}_5\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_5 \rightarrow 5\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \quad 2.
\]

The quantitative conversion of the sugars to acetate involves fermentation as well as the synthesis from CO₂ as shown in Reactions 3 and 4. Reaction 3 represents the fermentation of glucose via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas glycolytic pathway to pyruvate, which is further metabolized to acetate and CO₂ (156). Reaction 4 represents the pathway of CO₂ fixation leading to the synthesis of acetate (9, 155). The sum of these two reactions is Reaction 1.

\[
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + 2\text{CO}_2 + 8\text{H}^+ + 8\text{e}^- \quad 3.
\]

\[
2\text{CO}_2 + 8\text{H}^+ + 8\text{e}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \quad 4.
\]

The fermentation according to Reactions 3 and 4 can be considered to occur as shown in Figure 1. CO₂ formed in the fermentation serves as an electron acceptor and is reduced to acetate. This CO₂ is also in equilibrium with free CO₂ in the medium; when the latter is labeled with either ¹⁴C or ¹³C, both carbons of the synthesized acetate are derived from labeled CO₂. According to the stoichiometry, one third of the acetate is formed from CO₂; this has been observed experimentally (9, 155).

For many years it was believed that *C. thermoaceticum* lacked hydrogenase and was unable to use molecular hydrogen, and used instead the reduction of CO₂ as electron sink (84). However, recently hydrogenase was discovered in *C. thermoaceticum* (28). In addition it was found that this bacterium can grow

on a gas mixture of H₂/CO₂ (60) as well as on other one-carbon compounds including CO (92), formate (47), and methanol (150) (Reactions 5–10).

2CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₃COOH + 2H₂O    5.
4CO + 2H₂O → CH₃COOH + 2CO₂     6.
4HCOOH → CH₃COOH + 2CO₂ + 2H₂O  7.
4CH₃OH + 2CO₂ → 3CH₃COOH + 2H₂O 8.
2CO + 2H₂ → CH₃COOH             9.
2HCOOH + 2H₂ → CH₃COOH + 2H₂O   10.

It is evident from the following discussion that several acetogens grow with H₂/CO₂ as the sole source of carbon and energy. These bacteria are therefore H₂-oxidizing autotrophs. However, they do not use ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, the key enzyme of the Calvin cycle (21), to fix CO₂ for cell carbon. Instead, they synthesize acetyl-CoA, an intermediate in the pathway of acetate synthesis from CO₂. Thus, acetyl-CoA can be considered the first product of autotrophic fixation of CO₂ in acetogens.

All enzymes of this newly discovered pathway have been isolated from *C. thermoaceticum*. Of these enzymes, formate dehydrogenase (160), carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (107), a corrinoid protein, and methyltransferase are unique (50); formate dehydrogenase contains tungsten, selenium, and iron; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase has nickel, zinc, and iron; and the corrinoid enzyme has a vitamin B₁₂ derivative. Intermediates in the pathway are formate, one-carbon derivatives of tetrahydrofolate, and a methylcorrinoid.

That the pathway now established for acetate synthesis from CO₂ in *C. thermoaceticum* could constitute a unique autotrophic pathway of CO₂ fixation was suggested by Wood and coworkers in the 1950s (139, 159). With all due respect to the many who have contributed to the elucidation of this pathway, most of the credit must go to H. G. Wood. Therefore, I suggest that the pathway be named “the Wood pathway of autotrophic fixation of CO₂”. It is now apparent that this pathway, also called the corrinoid pathway, is more

widespread than was originally anticipated. The same or a very similar pathway may be present in methanogenic (129, 130) and sulfate-reducing (53, 62) bacteria.

# SURVEY AND PROPERTIES OF ACETOGENS

It has already been mentioned that *Clostridium thermoaceticum* was the only homoacetogen available until 1967. In 1967 an isolate considered to be *Clostridium aceticum* (37) was described. Since it did not fit the original description of *C. aceticum*, it was later renamed *Clostridium formicoaceticum* (4). A third homoacetogen, *Acetobacterium woodii*, was discovered in 1977 (8). It differs from the clostridial species in that it does not form spores. As shown in Table 1, 14 homoacetogens have now been isolated, 10 of these within the last four years. Presently the group contains five different genera and includes three thermophilic species, *Acetogenium kivui* (64), *C. thermoaceticum* (42), and *C. thermoautotrophicum* (149).

Homoacetogens have in common the formation of acetate as the main or only product. All except *Acetoanaerobium noterae* (126) and *Sporomusa sphaeroides* (98) convert 1 mol fructose to almost 3 mol acetate. Glucose is not fermented by *Acetobacterium wieringae* (13), *C. aceticum* (14), *C. formicoaceticum* (4), and *Sporomusa acidovorans* (100). As a group, the homoacetogens convert hexoses, pentoses, polyols, oxidized sugars such as onic and uronic acids, acids of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, serine, glutamate, diols, acetoin, lactate, and ethanol to acetate (14, 73, 100, 120). However, there has been no report of the fermentation of disaccharides or more complex carbohydrates by homoacetogens. In the fermentation of the above substrates CO₂ serves as electron acceptor and is converted to acetate.

In this review the emphasis is on the utilization of one-carbon compounds by acetogens and on autotrophy. Of the homoacetogens listed in Table 1, all but *C. formicoaceticum* and *C. magnum* grow on a gas mixture of H₂/CO₂ and can be considered hydrogen-oxidizing autotrophic acetogens. Although they grow best in media containing a small amount of yeast extract and some vitamins, many have been shown to grow in media essentially void of organic compounds (2, 8, 13, 14, 116). A list of vitamins required for growth of acetogens has been compiled by Savage & Drake (116). Several trace metals are essential for growth of acetogens. These include cobalt, iron, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and tungsten; all are constituents of enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of acetate from CO₂. However, it is difficult to demonstrate that acetogens require trace metals because the acetogens very efficiently take up necessary trace metals present as contaminants in media and on utensils.

Since *C. formicoaceticum* and *C. magnum* do not grow on H₂/CO₂ they cannot be considered autotrophs, yet they synthesize acetate from CO₂. With

C. formicoaceticum this synthesis was established by demonstrating the incorporation of \[^{14}C\]-formate and \[^{14}C\]-CO₂ into both carbons of acetate (4). Radioactivity was incorporated into the methyl and carboxyl groups of acetate with the ratios 0.98 using \[^{14}C\]-CO₂ and 1.11 using \[^{14}C\]-formate. This indicates that CO₂ labels the carboxyl group slightly better than the methyl group, whereas formate does the opposite. Schulman et al (123) ascertained that C. formicoaceticum synthesizes acetate with both carbons derived from CO₂ by fermenting fructose in the presence of \[^{13}CO₂\]. Mass spectroscopic examination of the acetate produced showed that 27% was totally derived from CO₂. The results of these tracer experiments are in complete agreement with a synthesis of acetate via the pathway established for C. thermoaceticum.

The synthesis of acetate from CO₂ by C. magnum has not been established using tracer experiments. However, in fermentations of glucose, fructose, and xylose the stoichiometry was similar to that obtained with C. thermoaceticum (120). Even more convincingly, fermentations of 200 μmol each of 2,3-butanediol and acetoin in the presence of excess bicarbonate yielded 515 and 478 μmol of acetate, respectively. Since these substrates can theoretically yield only 400 μmol of acetate, the additional acetate must have been synthesized from CO₂ (120) serving as an electron acceptor as shown in the fermentation of 2,3-butanediol (Reactions 11–13).

$$
4CH_3CHOHCHOHCH_3 + 8H_2O \rightarrow 8CH_3COOH + 24H^+ - 24e^- \quad 11.
$$

$$
6CO_2 + 24H^+ + 24e^- \rightarrow 3CH_3COOH + 6H_2O \quad 12.
$$

The sum of Reactions 11 and 12 gives

$$
4CH_3CHOHCHOHCH_3 + 6CO_2 + 2H_2O \rightarrow 11CH_3COOH. \quad 13.
$$

It is not known why C. formicoaceticum and C. magnum are unable to grow on H₂/CO₂. Clearly, hydrogenase is essential for autotrophic growth on H₂/CO₂, as is a mechanism of ATP synthesis, e.g., a H⁺-translocating ATPase coupled with electron transport. Presence of hydrogenase has not been demonstrated in C. formicoaceticum, and molar growth yields with fructose as substrate indicate that ATP is apparently formed only by substrate phosphorylation (4). However, C. formicoaceticum has a b-type cytochrome and menaquinone (48). These electron carriers are normally associated with electron transport coupled with phosphorylation. Furthermore, during fermentation of fumarate unusually high growth yields were observed; this may indicate the presence of electron-transport phosphorylation coupled to fumarate reduction (27).

Growth yields of C. magnum are about 48 g bacteria mol⁻¹ fructose or glucose and 35 g bacteria mol⁻¹ xylose (120). These high growth yields are

very close to those obtained with *C. thermoaceticum* (6) and *A. woodii* (12, 138). As is discussed later, *C. thermoaceticum* contains a F₁F₀-ATPase that synthesizes ATP in response to a pH gradient (52). Thus, judging from growth yields *C. magnum* may have an ATP-synthesizing ATPase system. It may also have hydrogenase, because a hydrogen-utilizing methanogen in a coculture with *C. magnum* obtained hydrogen through interspecies hydrogen transfer from the oxidation of butanediol by *C. magnum* (120). The failure by *C. magnum* to use H₂/CO₂ remains to be explained.

It is of considerable interest that *A. woodii* in the presence of bicarbonate utilizes the methyl groups of phenylmethylethers including vanillic, syringic, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic, ferulic, sinapic, 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic, 2,4-dimethoxybenzoic, and 3-methoxycinnamic acids, as well as those of vanillin and anisol (7). The bacterium is also able to reduce the double bond in the acrylic acid side chain of ferulic, caffeic, sinapic, and 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acids. The conversions of syringic and sinapic acids to the respective hydroxy derivatives and acetate are shown in Reactions 14 and 15.

![Reaction 14](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

Syringic acid + 2CO₂ + 2H₂O → Gallic acid + 3CH₃COOH

![Reaction 15](https://i.imgur.com/7654321.png)

Sinapic acid + 2CO₂ + 6H₂O → 3,4,5-Trihydroxy-3-phenylpropionic acid + 5 CH₃COOH

It can be assumed that the methoxyl groups of the above compounds are the source of the methyl group of acetate. Since *A. woodii* also utilizes methanol for acetate synthesis (7), it is possible that methanol is an intermediate. However, this has not been established, and the possibility of a transmethylation reaction has not been excluded.

Growth yields on the phenylmethylethers are correlated to the number of their methoxyl groups. However, the reduction of the double bond in the

acrylic acid side chain has been shown to be associated with ATP generation (138). The yield is about 1 ATP mol⁻¹ acrylic acid side chain reduced. Thus caffeic acid and similar compounds can replace CO₂ as the electron acceptor in the energy-producing system of A. woodii. Phenylmethylethers may be present as degradation products of lignin (22). Their further degradation by A. woodii in an anaerobic natural environment would then be of ecological significance. Other acetogens also carry out these reactions (36, 62).

In addition to homoacetogens, “other acetogens” are listed in Table 1. “Butyribacterium methylotrophicum” and Eubacterium limosum (formerly Butyribacterium rettgeri) clearly resemble each other and the homoacetogens (132). The main difference is that in addition to acetate they form butyrate and caproate (45, 165). Strains of both bacteria use methanol, but only in the presence of acetate. Both bacteria grow on H₂/CO₂ without any acetate present in the medium. Acetate was the sole product with B. methylotrophicum and acetate and butyrate were the two products with E. limosum. Carbon monoxide is also a substrate for both bacteria (44, 86); it is converted to CO₂ and acetate.

Cell yields have been determined with B. methylotrophicum growing on H₂/CO₂, CO, methanol, and glucose (87); the Yₛs (g cells mol⁻¹ substrate) were 1.6, 3.5, 7.5, and 43, respectively. The value on glucose was obtained in a complex medium; in a defined medium a value of 38 was obtained. The value on glucose in a complex medium is within the range obtained for C. thermoaceticum and other acetogens (6).

An acetogenic strain of Peptostreptococcus productus, U-1, was recently isolated from anaerobic sewage digester sludge (85). It ferments glucose to H₂, acetate, lactate, and succinate, and thus cannot be considered a homoacetogen. However, its growth on H₂/CO₂ with acetate as the only product and also on CO with acetate and CO₂ as products qualifies it as an acetogen. It does not grow on methanol or formate. Growth yields were 1.28 g cell protein mol⁻¹ CO and 0.39 g cell protein mol⁻¹ H₂; these appear to be similar to those obtained with B. methylotrophicum (87).

Desulfotomaculum orientis (62) and Desulfovibrio baarsii (54) are sulfate-reducing bacteria that are able to grow on CO₂ or other one-carbon compounds as sole carbon sources. Thus they are autotrophs, and since acetate is the product of one-carbon assimilation they can also be considered acetogens.

D. orientis in some aspects resembles A. woodii. It utilizes methoxyl groups of trimethoxybenzoate and can also grow on H₂/CO₂, CO, formate, and methanol. On these substrates in a sulfate-free medium, with a gas phase of H₂/CO₂ (80/20) or N₂/CO₂ (80/20), acetate is excreted. It can be concluded that CO₂ is used as an electron acceptor in lieu of sulfate. It was suggested that D. orientis synthesizes acetate via the autotrophic acetate pathway found in C. thermoaceticum. Evidence for this pathway has been obtained with

Desulfovibrio baarsii (53, 54). In addition to *D. orientis*, Desulfotomaculum ruminis and Desulfotomaculum nigrificans also use one-carbon compounds as carbon sources (62).

The above discussion shows that many bacteria previously considered heterotrophs are capable of autotrophic growth. The pathway leading to synthesis of acetyl-CoA as established in *C. thermoaceticum* is now discussed in detail.

# THE WOOD PATHWAY OF AUTOTROPHIC FIXATION OF CO₂ INTO ACETATE

## Outline of the Pathway

The present concept of the pathway of synthesis of acetate from CO₂ by *C. thermoaceticum* is outlined in Figure 2. Carbon dioxide is reduced to form the methyl group of a protein-bound Co-methylcorrinoid via formate and formyl-, methenyl-, methylene-, and methyltetrahydrofolate. This part of the pathway was discussed in a review in 1969 (83), based on some fundamental findings that are recapitulated here.

In experiments using \({}^{13}\)CO₂ it was shown that one third of the acetate produced by *C. thermoaceticum* in fermentations of glucose was solely from

CO₂ (155) (see Reactions 3 and 4, and Figure 1). In these experiments it was also found that an exchange reaction occurs between the carboxyl group of acetate and CO₂. As is discussed later, it was recently revealed that this exchange is catalyzed by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (113). Formate is a better precursor of the methyl group of acetate than is CO₂ (65), and *C. thermoaceticum* has an NADP-dependent formate dehydrogenase (67). Cell-free extracts containing pyruvate catalyze the formation of [2-¹⁴C]-acetate from [¹⁴CH₃]-Co-methylcobalamin (105, 106), and several [¹⁴CH₃]-Co-methylcorrinoids, including Co-(5-methoxybenzimidazolyl)-Co-methylcobamide and Co-methylcobyric acid, were isolated from cells of *C. thermoaceticum* exposed to ¹⁴CO₂ (78, 79). These Co-methylcorrinoids are substrates for acetate synthesis. Evidence also indicated that the methylcorrinoids are not free intermediates but are protein-bound (78). The 5-methyl group of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is a precursor of the methyl group of acetate (78), and *C. thermoaceticum* contains a high level of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (131).

Synthesis of acetate from CO₂, Co-methylcorrinoids, or methyltetrahydrofolate by cell-free extract was shown to be dependent on pyruvate (46, 78, 105, 106). Pyruvate serves a reducing agent and the carboxyl of pyruvate is the source of the carboxyl group of acetate (122). The previously observed incorporation of ¹⁴CO₂ into the carboxyl of acetate was postulated to occur via an exchange between ¹⁴CO₂ and the carboxyl group of pyruvate. This exchange is catalyzed by pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pyruvate dehydrogenase in Figure 2) present in cell-free extracts of *C. thermoaceticum*. However, as shown below, CO₂, the carboxyl group of pyruvate, and carbon monoxide are all precursors of the carboxyl group of acetate.

In 1978 Diekert & Thauer (25) discovered carbon monoxide dehydrogenase in *C. thermoaceticum* and *C. formicoaceticum*. Later they reported that the synthesis of this enzyme was dependent on the presence of nickel in the growth medium (26); nickel was found to be associated with a protein fraction exhibiting CO dehydrogenase activity (29). Meanwhile, Drake et al (30) isolated a five-protein component system from *C. thermoaceticum* consisting of phosphotransacetylase, methyltransferase, pyruvate cleavage enzyme (apparently pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase), ferredoxin, and a fraction designated F₃ containing a mixture of three or four proteins. This system catalyzes the synthesis of acetate from pyruvate and methyltetrahydrofolate. Fraction F₃ was found to contain CO dehydrogenase and a corrinoid protein (49). Most interestingly, this fraction together with methyltransferase and ATP catalyzed the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide, methyltetrahydrofolate, and coenzyme A (Reaction 16). Thus, pyruvate and the enzyme associated with pyruvate metabolism can be replaced by CO, which was found to be a precursor of the carboxyl group of acetate.

CO + CH₃-H₄folate + CoASH → CH₃COSCoA + H₄folate 16.

Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase has been purified to homogeneity from *C. thermoaceticum* (24, 107). Each enzyme molecule contains six nickel atoms, three zinc atoms, and several iron-sulfur centers (107). Using EPR spectroscopy and isotope substitution techniques (¹³C and ⁶¹Ni), evidence has been obtained for the formation of a nickel-carbon complex in the reaction between CO dehydrogenase and its substrates CO₂ and CO (110, 111). A one-carbon CO dehydrogenase complex is also formed from the carboxyl group of pyruvate (101). Thus, as shown in Figure 2, CO dehydrogenase, designated Ni-E, reacts with CO₂, CO, and the carboxyl of pyruvate to form a one-carbon CO dehydrogenase complex, [Co-Ni-E]. This complex reacts with the methyl group from the methylcorrinoid protein, [CH₃-Co-E], and coenzyme A to yield acetyl-CoA (101, 113). The fundamental function of CO dehydrogenase in acetate synthesis may therefore be to form an enzyme-bound C-1 unit from CO₂, CO, or pyruvate, and to condense it with a methyl group and CoA to yield acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA may then be used for synthesis of cell carbon or may be converted to acetate via phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase.

All enzymes indicated in Figure 2 and some other proteins involved in acetate synthesis or electron transport in *C. thermoaceticum* have been purified and characterized (Table 2). An evaluation of their properties follows.

### Formate Dehydrogenase

Formate dehydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide. The enzymes from different sources use diverse electron acceptors and they differ in size and composition of prosthetic groups (1, 72, 136). Although a great deal of attention has been given to formate metabolism in anaerobic bacteria, few formate dehydrogenases from such bacteria have been purified, perhaps because these enzymes are very oxygen-sensitive. Nevertheless, purified enzymes have been obtained from *Clostridium pasteurianum* (69), *C. thermoaceticum* (160), *Methanobacterium formicicum* (117), and *Methanococcus vannielii* (56). The latter bacterium has two formate dehydrogenases: a molybdenum-tungsten-selenium-iron-sulfur protein and a molybdenum-iron-sulfur protein with neither selenium nor tungsten. The enzymes from *C. pasteurianum* and *M. formicicum* both contain molybdenum and iron-sulfur centers.

Most formate dehydrogenases use ferredoxin as electron acceptor. The formate dehydrogenase of *C. thermoaceticum* is the only known enzyme that reversibly catalyzes the reduction of CO₂ or bicarbonate with NADPH (Reactions 17 and 18). The $K_{eq}$ at pH 7.5 and 55°C is $2.35 \times 10^{-2}$ if CO₂ is considered the active species, and $1.48 \times 10^{-3}$ if $\text{HCO}_3^-$ is the active species (160).

The *C. thermoaceticum* formate dehydrogenase has a molecular weight of $340 \times 10^3$ and consists of two each of two different subunits of 96 and 76 kd. The enzyme contains 2 tungsten, 2 selenium, about 36 iron, and 50 inorganic sulfur atoms per mole. The selenium is in the form of selenocysteine and is in the larger subunit. Tungsten is apparently in the form of a tungsten cofactor which is released from the enzyme by various treatments. This cofactor may be similar to the molybdenum cofactor of several molybdenum enzymes (55, 115). The molybdenum cofactor contains a reduced pterin ring with a side chain containing a dithiol that apparently binds the molybdenum (Figure 3). The tungsten cofactor is suspected to contain a similar reduced pterin; it contains fluorescent material with excitation and emission spectra similar to that of the molybdenum cofactor, and its "pterin" can replace the pterin of the molybdenum cofactor (70) in reconstituting the apoenzyme of nitrate reductase of the *nit-1* mutant of *Neurospora crassa* (61). Furthermore, extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies (23) have revealed that tungsten in the formate dehydrogenase of *C. thermoaceticum* has two W-S and two W-O or W-N bonds. The presence of the two W-S bonds is compatible with the idea that tungsten is coordinated to the two sulfurs of the side chain of the pterin moiety of the cofactor. However, this and the exact nature of the tungsten cofactor remain to be proven.

The formate dehydrogenase from *C. thermoaceticum* was the first enzyme shown to have tungsten as a biologically active trace metal (5). Molybdenum is not present in the most active preparations. The finding that tungsten and not molybdenum is the active metal in the formate dehydrogenase of *C. thermoaceticum* was surprising. Tungsten has been shown to be an antagonist of molybdenum (71). It replaces molybdenum in some enzymes, which then are inactive, and it prevents the formation of holoenzymes by hindering the incorporation of molybdenum into apoenzymes.

Tungsten is also a component (together with selenium) of one of the formate dehydrogenases of *M. vanielii* (56). It stimulates the formation of formate dehydrogenases of *C. formicoaceticum* (66), *C. acidiurici* (145), and *C. thermoautotrophicum* (H. Hon-nami, S.-M. Liu, L. G. Ljungdahl, unpublished). A newly isolated, extremely thermophilic bacterium, *Metha*-

nothermus fervidus (128), has an absolute requirement for tungsten and scavenges it so efficiently that it can satisfy its need by extracting tungsten from certain types of laboratory glassware (K. O. Stetter, personal communication).

Selenium is a component of several types of enzymes, most of which do not contain tungsten (127). However, all of the tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenases apparently have selenium (56, 66, 145, 160). This raises the possibility that tungsten and selenium interact in these enzymes. However, evidence for this is lacking (23). A second possibility would be that selenium replaces sulfur in a cysteine residue in iron-sulfur centers of the formate dehydrogenase.

The physiological function of formate dehydrogenase in acetogenic bacteria growing on H₂/CO₂ is clearly to reduce CO₂ to formate. Formate is then the precursor of the methyl group of acetate. However, it has been proposed that these bacteria may convert CO directly to formate when grown on CO (49, 157). Thus, it was suggested that CO forms a one-carbon intermediate bound to CO dehydrogenase. This intermediate would then either serve as the precursor of the carboxyl group of acetate or be converted to formate and enter the pathway leading to the methyl group of acetate. Further, according to this proposal CO₂ could also be converted to formate by the action of CO dehydrogenase, and formate dehydrogenase would not be needed. However, Ragsdale et al (107), using purified CO dehydrogenase from *C. thermoaceticum*, found no evidence for the formation of formate from CO or CO₂. Furthermore, they coupled CO dehydrogenase with purified enzymes of the tetrahydrofolate pathway to examine the possibility of the direct transfer of a CO dehydrogenase-bound “formate” intermediate to the tetrahydrofolate enzymes. Again no evidence was found for a formate intermediate. Thus, it is most likely that for CO to be incorporated into the methyl group of acetate it must first be oxidized to CO₂ by CO dehydrogenase, and then be reduced to formate by formate dehydrogenase. Support for this view is provided by the fact that in the presence of saturating levels of CO, ¹⁴CO₂ preferentially enters the methyl carbon of acetate; and with saturating levels of CO₂, ¹⁴CO enters predominantly the carboxyl carbon (91). Kerby et al (59), studying carbon flow in *A. woodii* and *B. methylotrophicum* with ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance, also found that CO₂ and formate are the better precursors of the methyl group and that CO is the better precursor of the carboxyl group of acetate.

## Tetrahydrofolate Enzymes

In acetogenic bacteria, formate is reduced to a methyl group via one-carbon intermediates of the tetrahydrofolate pathway (Figure 2). Evidence for this has been presented in previous reviews (73, 83, 84). Four enzymes are

involved, formyl-H₄folate synthetase (Reaction 19), methenyl-H₄folate cyclohydrolase (Reaction 20), methylene-H₄folate dehydrogenase (Reaction 21), and methylene-H₄folate reductase (Reaction 22).

HCOOH + H₄folate + ATP → HCO-H₄folate + ADP + Pᵢ 19.

HCO-H₄folate + H⁺ → CH-H₄folate⁺ + H₂O 20.

CH-H₄folate⁺ + NADPH → CH₂-H₄folate + NADP⁺ 21.

CH₂-H₄folate + ferredoxin_red → CH₃-H₄ folate + ferredoxin_ox 22.

These enzymes are present at high concentrations and with high specific activities in *C. formicoaceticum*, *C. thermoaceticum*, *C. thermooautotrophicum*, and *A. woodii* (73). This is in agreement with the concept that they serve in a major pathway in these acetogenic bacteria. These bacteria are excellent sources of these enzymes; all four have been purified from *C. thermoaceticum* (81, 93; E. Y. Han & L. G. Ljungdahl, unpublished) and *C. formicoaceticum* (18, 19, 81). Methylene-H₄folate dehydrogenase has also been obtained from *A. woodii* (108).

The physical and catalytic properties of many of these enzymes from various sources have recently been reviewed (88) and will not be detailed here. However, it is noteworthy that the methylene-H₄folate dehydrogenases of *C. thermoaceticum* (81) and *C. thermooautotrophicum* (20) are NADP-dependent, whereas those of *C. formicoaceticum* (81) and *A. woodii* (108) are NAD-dependent. A second significant difference between the dehydrogenases is that the NADP-dependent enzymes of the thermophiles are bifunctional, having cyclohydrolase activity in addition to dehydrogenase activity (17, 81). In contrast, the dehydrogenases of *C. formicoaceticum* and *A. woodii* have no cyclohydrolase activity, and thus are monofunctional. It is of interest that homogeneous enzymes from eukaryotes (88) are trifunctional, catalyzing the synthetase, cyclohydrolase, and dehydrogenase reactions (Reactions 19–21). One could speculate that NADP-dependent dehydrogenases are bifunctional and have cyclohydrolase activity while NAD-dependent dehydrogenases are monofunctional, but this is not a general rule. The methylene-H₄folate dehydrogenase from *Clostridium cylindrosporum* is NADP-dependent (140) but lacks cyclohydrolase activity (17). *C. cylindrosporum* synthesizes acetate from CO₂ during fermentation of purines by a H₄folate-dependent pathway that is different from that of acetogenic bacteria (74).

Methylene-H₄folate reductase (Reaction 22) was recently purified from *C. formicoaceticum* (19) and *C. thermoaceticum* (E. Y. Han & L. G. Ljungdahl,

unpublished). The enzyme from *C. formicoaceticum* is a 237-kd octamer containing two types of subunits of 26 and 35 kd. The octameric enzyme contains 16 Fe, 2 Zn, 20 acid-labile sulfur, and 2 FAD per mole. Like several other enzymes from acetogenic bacteria, it is oxygen-sensitive. It catalyzes the reduction of several artificial electron acceptors and rubredoxin with methyl-H₄folate. It also reduces FAD, but only with a large excess of methyl-H₄folate. Ferredoxin is not reduced. In the physiological direction, the methylene-H₄folate reductase catalyzes the reduction of methylene-H₄folate with FADH₂ or reduced ferredoxin, but not with reduced rubredoxin, NADH, or NADPH. The apparent redox potential of the 5,10-methylene-H₄folate/5-methyl-H₄folate couple is –120 mV. The redox potentials are –219 mV, for FAD/FADH₂; about –360 mV for ferredoxin<sub>ox</sub>/ferredoxin<sub>red</sub>, and around 0 mV for rubredoxin<sub>ox</sub>/rubredoxin<sub>red</sub>. These redox potentials indicate that FADH₂ and reduced ferredoxin would be expected to serve as reductants for methylene-H₄folate whereas rubredoxin would not. Reduced ferredoxin is formed by various reactions in acetogenic bacteria and appears to be the natural reductant. It is of interest that the conversion of methylene-H₄folate to acetate has been calculated to occur with enough free energy change (ΔG₀' = –29.1 kcal/mol) to allow the production of 1 or 2 mol ATP if coupled to electron transport (137).

### Corrinoid Proteins and Methyltransferase

According to the present concept of the synthesis of acetate in *C. thermoaceticum* (Figure 2), the methyl group of 5-methyl-H₄folate is transferred via a corrinoid protein to CO dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA. The methylation of the corrinoid protein requires methyltransferase (transmethylase in Figure 2) (50).

Two well-defined corrinoid proteins have been obtained from *C. thermoaceticum* (50). One (80) has a molecular weight of about 27 × 10³ and contains one mole of tightly bound 5-methoxybenzimidazolylycobamide per mole of protein. The corrinoid in the protein as isolated is in a reduced form corresponding to cob(II)alamin. The function of this protein in vivo has not been established, although substantial work was performed to find if it had a role in the synthesis of acetate. It may perhaps be involved in the synthesis of corrinoids by *C. thermoaceticum* (79), a corrinoid storage protein, or it may constitute the smaller of the subunits of the recently purified second corrinoid protein (50). This protein has a molecular weight of 89 × 10³ and consists of two different subunits of 34 and 55 kd. It contains 0.69 mol corrinoid mol⁻¹ protein, and in contrast to the first corrinoid protein it does function in the synthesis of acetate.

The cobalt in corrinoids occurs as Co⁺, Co²⁺, and Co³⁺. Alkylation in vitro, e.g., with methyl iodide, forms a Co-methylcorrinoid when the cobalt is

in its most reduced state (95). Similarly, in vivo the reduction of vitamin B₁₂  
to cob(I)alamin precedes the alkylation with ATP to form coenzyme B₁₂  
(143). Likewise, reduced B₁₂, cob(I)alamin, functions in the synthesis of  
methionine catalyzed by methyl-H₄folate-homocysteine cobalamin methyl-  
transferase (133). The reduction of cob(III)alamin to cob(I)alamin occurs by  
specific reductase (143) or with reduced ferredoxin (147).

The corrinoid protein of *C. thermoaceticum* must also be reduced to accept  
a methyl group from 5-methyl-H₄folate. Reduced ferredoxin for this purpose  
may be generated using pyruvate and pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase  
(162) or CO and CO dehydrogenase (50). The methylation of the reduced  
corrinoid protein with methyl-H₄folate is then catalyzed by transmethylase.  
The Co-methyl group of the methylated corrinoid protein condenses with CO  
and coenzyme A to yield acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by CO de-  
hydrogenase. Thus, the corrinoid protein undergoes three separate reactions  
(50) as follows:

[Co³⁺-E] + 2ferredoxin_red → [Co⁺-E] + 2ferredoxin_ox   23.  
[Co⁺-E] + CH₃-H₄folate → [CH₃-Co-E] + H₄folate           24.  
[CH₃-Co-E] + CO + HSCoA → CH₃COSCoA + [Co-E]             25.

Carbon monoxide in Reaction 25 may be replaced either by CO₂ and hydroge-  
nase or by pyruvate, pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase, thiamin pyrophos-  
phate, and ferredoxin.

### Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase and CO Dehydrogenase  
Disulfide Reductase

It has already been pointed out that CO dehydrogenase has a fundamental role  
and is the last of the series of enzymes needed for the autotrophic synthesis of  
acetyl-CoA (101, 102, 113). The enzyme has been purified from *C. thermo-  
aceticum* and *A. woodii* (107, 112). The CO dehydrogenases from the two  
bacteria are very similar. Each has the subunit composition α₃β₃. The sub-  
units are about 80 and 70 kD, respectively. The hexameric enzymes contain  
six nickel atoms, three zinc or magnesium atoms, and several Fe₄S₄ centers.  
The enzymes are extremely oxygen-sensitive and have been termed anaerobic  
CO dehydrogenases to distinguish them from oxygen-stable CO oxidases  
found in the carboxydrotrophic bacteria, e.g., *Pseudomonas carboxydovorans*.  
These CO oxidases of 230 kD (96, 97) are dimers containing two FAD  
molecules, two molybdenum atoms, and two types of Fe₂S₂ centers. The  
molybdenum is in the form of a molybdopterin cofactor (97) similar to the  
cofactor in some other molybdenum enzymes (see above) (Figure 3).

Although the anaerobic CO dehydrogenase and the aerobic CO oxidase are

clearly very different, both enzymes catalyze the oxidation of CO (Reaction 26). The best electron acceptors for both enzymes are those with potentials more positive than $-34 \, \text{mV}$, e.g., methylene blue and rubredoxin. However, in contrast with the aerobic CO oxidases, the CO dehydrogenases from the acetogens also reduce viologens and ferredoxins with potentials as low as $-440 \, \text{mV}$ (107).

\]

That nickel is biologically important is a relatively recent discovery. Presently four nickel enzymes are known: urease, methyl-CoM methyl reductase, hydrogenase, and CO dehydrogenase (135). Much attention has been focused on the roles and environments of the nickel in these enzymes. The yellow chromophore of methyl-CoM reductase, $\text{F}_{430}$, is a nickel-containing tetrapyrrole (38, 104). A nickel cofactor has not been found in hydrogenases, but extensive studies of the enzyme from *Desulfovibrio gigas* have shown that a Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox cycling scheme operates and that the nickel center in the enzyme is the hydride-binding site (134). The nickel has mainly sulfur ligands with an average Ni-S distance of $2.20 \, \AA$ (125).

It has already been mentioned that nickel in the CO dehydrogenase from *C. thermoaceticum* and *A. woodii* is the binding site for a one-carbon moiety from either CO, $\text{CO}_2$, or the carboxyl group of pyruvate (101, 111), which is the source of the carboxy group of acetyl-CoA. It has been postulated that this nickel is in the form of a cofactor (107), based on the release of a nickel compound with an apparent molecular weight of about $1.5 \times 10^3$ on acid treatment of the CO dehydrogenase. However, when the nickel was released under stringent anaerobic conditions it behaved like an ordinary inorganic compound (T. A. Morton, personal communication). Thus, the presence of a nickel cofactor in CO dehydrogenase is doubtful.

The nickel environment in the CO dehydrogenase of *C. thermoaceticum* has been examined with EXAFS (76) and was found to be distinctly different from that in urease, methyl-CoM methylreductase, and hydrogenase. In the CO dehydrogenase the nickel apparently has three or four Ni-N or Ni-O ligands with an average bond length of $2.03 \, \AA$. However, the possibility of sulfur ligands has not been excluded. Recently, Ragsdale et al (114) presented evidence from EPR studies that in CO dehydrogenase the nickel-carbon complex formed between Ni and CO (111) interacts with iron to form an iron-nickel-carbon complex in which the metals are bridged by acid-labile sulfur. However, EXAFS studies do not indicate such a complex. It is apparent that we still have much to learn about the role of metals in CO dehydrogenase.

The fact that CO dehydrogenase catalyzes the condensation of a methyl-

group, CO, and CoA to form acetyl-CoA indicates that the enzyme must have binding sites for these substrates. Previously described EPR studies (110, 111) showed the nickel to be the CO binding site, and more recent EPR studies (114) have indicated an influence of CoA on the EPR spectrum that suggests a CoA binding site close to nickel. However, all that is known about the methyl site is that it must exist, as judged by isotope exchange reactions catalyzed by the enzyme between ${}^{14}$CO and the carboxy group of acetyl-CoA (Reaction 27) (113) and between [${}^{3}$H]CoA and the CoA moiety of acetyl-CoA (103).

{}^{14}\text{CO} + \text{CH}_3{}^{12}\text{CO-SCoA} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3{}^{14}\text{CO-SCoA} + {}^{12}\text{CO}
\]

For the exchange to occur as shown in Reaction 27 the methyl, carboxy, and CoA moieties must be separated; thus each clearly requires a site on the enzyme.

Pezacka & Wood (101) noticed that a protein, $F_x$, was needed for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from methylated corrinoid protein, CO, and CoA catalyzed by CO dehydrogenase. This 225-kd protein consists of four apparently identical subunits and contains eight calcium and four zinc atoms. It catalyzes the reduction of disulfides including CoAS-SCoA, CoAS-glutathione, and cystine, but not that of oxidized glutathione, lipoic acid, lipoamide, or cystamine. However, its natural substrate is apparently CO dehydrogenase, and $F_x$ is now termed CO dehydrogenase disulfide reductase (103). Its function is to activate CO dehydrogenase. In one experiment the isolated CO dehydrogenase had 22 detectable SH groups per mole, and an aliquot of the enzyme synthesized 75 nmol of acetyl-CoA. After treatment with CO dehydrogenase disulfide reductase and NADPH, the CO dehydrogenase had 33 SH groups per mole, and the same amount of enzyme as above synthesized 350 nmol of acetyl-CoA. The reduction of the CO dehydrogenase also improved its catalysis of the exchange reaction between [${}^{3}$H]CoA and acetyl-CoA. The number of SH groups reduced by the CO dehydrogenase disulfide reductase was crucial. Thus, the reduction of six disulfide groups per mole (which is one disulfide per CO dehydrogenase monomer) is apparently sufficient for maximum activity. A further reduction, e.g., to 50 SH groups, produced a CO dehydrogenase with low activity. Based on these results it was suggested that a disulfide-dithiol conversion occurs with CO dehydrogenase and that the dithiol is involved in the CoA site (103). An interesting observation which seems consistent with this suggestion is that CO dehydrogenase also forms free acetic acid from the methylcorrinoid protein and CO in the absence of CoA (S. W. Ragsdale, unpublished results cited in 103).

It is possible or even likely that CO dehydrogenase in vivo forms a complex
with some of the other enzymes needed for acetate synthesis. Hu et al (50) found that $^{57}$Co-labeled corrinoid protein did not separate from CO dehydrogenase in chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column. CO dehydrogenase disulfide reductase is much more stable when stored in the presence of an equimolar amount of CO dehydrogenase (103), which indicates an interaction between these enzymes. CO dehydrogenase from *C. thermoaceticum* was reduced by H₂ in the presence of hydrogenase from *A. woodii* without the involvement of an electron carrier, which indicates an interaction between the two enzymes (109).

Impressive evidence indicates that CO dehydrogenase in acetogenic bacteria is the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from CO₂. Therefore the primary function of CO dehydrogenase in these bacteria may be to synthesize acetyl-CoA, and the reduction of CO₂ to nickel-bound CO may be just the first step in this synthesis. Perhaps the name of the enzyme should therefore be methyl-CO-CoA condensing enzyme rather than CO dehydrogenase.

### Hydrogenase and Energy Generation in Acetogens

Hydrogenase has been demonstrated in several acetogenic bacteria including *C. thermoaceticum* (28), *C. thermoautotrophicum* (20), *C. aceticum* (12), *A. woodii* (12), and *D. orientis* (62), but the enzyme has not been extensively studied in acetogens. A soluble hydrogenase fraction that exhibits several proteins with hydrogenase activity on gel-electrophoresis was obtained from *A. woodii* (109). The specific activity of the preparation was 3.5 × 10³ μmol H₂ oxidized min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein when measured at 35°C and pH 7.6 with methyl viologen as electron acceptor. Under the same conditions with reduced methyl viologen as electron donor the activity was 440 μmol H₂ evolved min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein. The enzyme does not contain nickel, which is a component of some hydrogenases (134, 135). Likewise, a hydrogenase in *C. thermoaceticum* is apparently not a nickel enzyme (28). The *A. woodii* enzyme contains iron-sulfur centers. It reduces ferredoxin and flavodoxin, and as discussed above it reduces CO dehydrogenase with H₂. The *C. thermoaceticum* hydrogenase has been shown to reduce the particulate b-type cytochrome of the same bacterium (28). Cells of *C. thermoaceticum* growing on glucose in the presence of CO₂ apparently produce a single hydrogenase, as was revealed by activity staining of polyacrylamide gels following electrophoresis. In contrast, two hydrogenases were detected when the cells were grown in the presence of CO (58).

One obvious function of hydrogenase is to oxidize H₂ in acetogens growing autotrophically on H₂/CO₂. Hydrogen is evolved when *C. thermoaceticum* is grown on glucose with a gas phase of CO, but not in significant amounts when CO₂ is present (91). This shows that under certain circumstances *C.*
thermoaceticum can use H₂ formation as a means of disposing electrons. The formation of hydrogen has also been demonstrated with A. woodii (12, 152), C. aceticum (12), and A. carbinolicum (36).

Since acetogens can produce H₂, one may ask why they use CO₂ as an electron sink and convert it to acetate by a complicated pathway. Perhaps H₂ is formed as an obligatory intermediate during fermentations conducted by acetogens, but is also efficiently taken up and recycled for the generation of ATP. A H₂-cycling system has been postulated for Desulfovibrio gigas and A. woodii (99). Such a system requires cytoplasmic and periplasmic hydrogenases, membrane electron transport, and a H⁺-translocating ATPase. In this system, when fructose or glucose is fermented by C. thermoaceticum to acetate and CO₂, the reducing equivalents generated are converted to H₂ inside the cell. This requires the cytoplasmic hydrogenase. Molecular hydrogen then diffuses to the outside of the membrane where it is oxidized by the periplasmic hydrogenase. Electrons from this reaction are picked up by the electron transfer system of the membrane, whereas the protons are passed through the H⁺-translocating ATPase to generate ATP. The operation of a H₂-cycling energy-generating system could explain the high growth yields obtained with several acetogens when they ferment sugars. When acetogens grow on H₂/CO₂ their need for cytoplasmic hydrogen is not obvious, and it is possible that ATP may be generated by the simple system shown in Figure 4.

Evidence for a H₂-cycling system or any other energy-generating system in acetogens is sketchy. However, evidence has been obtained for the presence of two hydrogenases in C. thermoaceticum grown with CO in gas phase (see above) (58). Perhaps one of these hydrogenases is on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane and the other is cytoplasmic. Several acetogens including C. thermoaceticum contain membrane-associated b-type cytochromes and menaquinone, electron carriers that are considered to be involved in

electron transport (48). *C. thermoaceticum* has two rubredoxins (161) and two ferredoxins (39, 40, 162). Ferredoxin II appears to be associated with the membrane (39). *C. thermoaceticum* has a H⁺-translocating ATPase; the F₁ portion was recently purified. It has a molecular weight of 370 × 10³ and consists of four different polypeptides of 60, 55, 37, and 17 kd in an apparent molar ratio of 3:3:1:1. The ATPase activity of native membranes or of F₁-stripped membranes reconstituted with purified F₁ ATPase is sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and tributyltin chloride, whereas the F₁ ATPase activity per se is barely affected by these inhibitors. Whole cells of *C. thermoaceticum* subjected to a pH jump synthesize ATP by a system inhibited by DCCD (52). ATPase synthesis in *C. thermoaceticum* is significantly similar to that in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria known to generate ATP by electron transport and proton-motive force. Therefore, it is postulated that the *C. thermoaceticum* ATPase can function as a proton-motive force-driven ATP synthase.

*C. thermoaceticum* maintains an internal pH more alkaline than that of the exterior environments (10). This pH is decreased by ionophores and inhibitors of H⁺-translocating ATPase. Furthermore, the acetic acid produced during the fermentation of glucose eventually lowers the pH of the medium. When the pH falls below 5 the un-ionized acetic acid moves passively into the cells and abolishes the pH gradient; cell growth and acetate production stop.

Although evidence for ATP generation by electron transport and H⁺-translocating ATPase have been obtained with *C. thermoaceticum*, similar evidence from other acetogens is lacking. However, the energy-generating processes of *Desulfovibrio* spp. and *C. thermoaceticum* exhibit many similarities. It seems possible that these processes are common among anaerobic bacteria. Zeikus et al (164) have proposed biochemical models for coupling carbon and electron flow pathways in acetogens and methanogens, and have pointed out similarities as well as differences between these two types of anaerobic autotrophs.

## Methanol as a Precursor to Acetate

Several acetogens can grow on methanol (Table 1), but only in the presence of CO₂, formate, CO, or acetate. In the presence of CO₂, 3 mol acetate is formed from 4 mol methanol and 2 mol CO₂ (Reaction 8). This implies that methanol-carbon is used as a precursor of both carbons of acetate. In vivo ¹³C NMR analyses of the transformations of [¹³C]methanol by *B. methylotrophicum* indicated that methanol in the presence of CO₂, CO, or formate predominantly labels the methyl group (59). These analyses also showed that methanol is oxidized to CO₂. Similar results have been obtained with *C. thermoautotrophicum* (153). Cells grown on [¹⁴C]methanol in the presence of ¹²CO₂ formed acetate with both carbons labeled; the CH₃/COOH labeling

ratio was 3.5. With ${}^{14}\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and [${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$]methanol the $\mathrm{CH}_{3} / \mathrm{COOH}$ labeling ratio was 0.7. Furthermore, [${}^{14}\mathrm{C}$]methanol was oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and ${}^{14}\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was converted to methanol in these experiments. Thus methanol appears to be incorporated directly into the methyl group of acetate.

The entrance of methanol into the pathway of acetate synthesis shown in Figure 2 appears to be at the level of the corrinoid protein [CoE] and methyltransferase. Thus a methanol-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase in *E. limosum* can couple with components of *Methanobacterium formicicum* to catalyze the conversion of methanol to methane even though *M. formicicum* is not able to utilize methanol by itself (141, 142). However, the synthesis of acetate using methanol as the source of the methyl group remains to be studied with purified enzymes.

Methanol could conceivably be oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by reversal of the tetrahydrofolate reactions of the acetate synthesis pathway. However, it is more likely that methanol is oxidized by a novel methanol dehydrogenase containing the coenzyme pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) (31) associated with NADH dehydrogenases. Preliminary evidence of such a methanol dehydrogenase has been obtained with *C. thermoautotrophicum* and *E. limosum* (32). Furthermore, D. Winters-Ivey (personal communication) has obtained from *C. thermoautotrophicum* a protein fraction that catalyzes the oxidation of methanol and formaldehyde to formate with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as electron acceptor. This protein fraction has a visible spectrum that indicates the presence of PQQ. It is possible that this enzyme fraction together with formate dehydrogenase may catalyze the oxidation of methanol to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. If these reactions are reversible, there may be an alternate route for the synthesis of the methyl group of acetate that does not involve tetrahydrofolate (153).

# ACETYL COENZYME A AS PRECURSOR OF CELL CARBON IN ACETOGENS

Acetyl-CoA is the precursor of lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, and carbohydrates. It is an ideal compound with which to start the synthesis of cell materials. Reinterpretation of results of earlier studies conducted with *C. thermoaceticum* in search of intermediates of acetate synthesis clearly indicate that acetyl-CoA formed from ${}^{14}\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is incorporated into sugar phosphates, amino acids, and carboxylic acids (82). The data shown in Figure 5 were obtained with *C. thermoaceticum* cells fermenting xylose and exposed for 5 sec to ${}^{14}\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Several carboxylic acids, free amino acids, and sugar phosphates were isolated from these cells and were found to be labeled with the highest specific activities in lactate, formate, acetate, aspartate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, and ribose-5-phosphate. These compounds were degraded to discern the distribution of ${}^{14}\mathrm{C}$ among individual carbons. Acetate was labeled

in both carbons, with 34.6% of the label in the methyl group and 65.4% in the carboxyl group. The higher labeling in the carboxyl group in this 5-sec pulse experiment reflects the fact that the route for incorporation of ¹⁴CO₂ into this group is shorter than that for incorporation into the methyl group (Figure 2). It can be assumed that the distribution of ¹⁴C in acetate is the same as that of

acetyl-CoA. Lactate, which reflects the labeling of pyruvate, was highly labeled in the carboxyl group; this indicates direct incorporation of ${}^{14}\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into this group via the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase reaction. In addition, the distribution of label was 34.2% in the $\beta$-carbon and 65.8% in the $\alpha$-carbon. This distribution was the same as for acetate, which indicates that acetyl-CoA is a precursor of these carbons. Aspartate was highly labeled in both carboxyl groups, which shows that these carbons are directly formed from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Again, the label had the same distribution as in acetate, 62.0% and 38.0% in the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons, respectively. Examination of the distribution of ${}^{14}\mathrm{C}$ in sugar phosphates (see Figure 5) indicated that they were also synthesized with acetyl-CoA as precursor. Thus, the labeling of carbons 5 and 6 of glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and fructose-1,6-phosphate and that of carbons 4 and 5 of ribose-5-phosphate reflect the incorporation of acetyl-CoA into these sugar phosphates. Figure 5a shows a pathway proposed for the incorporation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and acetyl-CoA into lactate, aspartate, and sugar phosphates by *C. thermoaceticum*. The incorporation of acetyl-CoA is based on the data in Figure 5b.

Eden & Fuchs (34, 35) have carried out extensive labeling experiments and enzyme studies on the autotrophic fixation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and on the synthesis of cell carbon from acetyl-CoA in *A. woodii*. Their results are very similar to those obtained with *C. thermoaceticum* (82). In addition, they demonstrated that the citric acid cycle is incomplete; $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is missing. The enzyme studies also revealed that pyruvate is directly converted to phosphoenolpyruvate, most likely by pyruvate phosphate dikinase (Reaction 28), and that oxaloacetate is formed from phosphoenolpyruvate by PEP carboxytransphosphorylase (Reaction 29).

\end{aligned}

That pyrophosphate is formed in prominent reactions in acetogens is of considerable interest since it is viewed as a source of energy in addition to ATP. Reactions involving pyrophosphate have been reviewed (158).

The sulfur-reducing bacterium *Desulfovibrio baarsii* grows on formate and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as sole carbon source. Labeling and enzyme studies have demonstrated that acetate (or acetyl CoA) is an early product of formate and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ assimilation and that it is used for the synthesis of cell components (53, 54). It was suggested that the pathway of acetate synthesis is the same as that in *C. thermoaceticum*. The further metabolism of acetyl-CoA seems also to be like that of *C. thermoaceticum* and *A. woodii*.

The acetogens belong to the eubacteria and they differ considerably from
the methanogens, which are archaebacteria (154). However, both types of bacteria are anaerobes and both categories include many autotrophic species. The pathway of methane synthesis from CO₂ in methanogens involves several unique coenzymes including methanofuran and tetrahydromethanopterin. These cofactors serve as one-carbon carriers as tetrahydrofolate does in acetogens (57). Regardless, the pathway of methane formation in methanogens has many similarities with the pathway of acetate synthesis in acetogens. It has recently been proposed that a methyl group formed from CO₂ and bound to tetrahydromethanopterin is a precursor of the methyl group of acetyl-CoA in methanogens (63, 129, 130). This methyl group is incorporated into acetyl-CoA in reactions that are apparently identical to those of the acetogens involving a corrinoid protein and CO dehydrogenase. The carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA is from CO or CO₂. Acetyl-CoA is then used for the synthesis of cell carbon in reactions similar to those used by the acetogens (43). Clearly, autotrophic fixation of CO₂ leading to the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, which in turn is the precursor of cell carbon, is probably common in anaerobic autotrophs.

## ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ACETOGENS

The first sentence of this review stated that acetate is a key intermediate in the bacterial degradation of organic matter (89). Many new acetogens have recently been found in nature, and it appears that acetogens are common, at least in an anaerobic environment. However, very little is known about their ecological importance.

The worldwide fixation of CO₂ has been estimated to yield \(150 \times 10^{12}\) kg of biomass per year (68). About 10% of this biomass is converted to CO₂ and methane in anaerobic environments (144). Since perhaps as much as 75% of the methane produced in nature is from acetate (90), about \(10 \times 10^{12}\) kg of acetate is metabolized anaerobically per year. Acetate is produced through fermentation by many bacteria other than acetogens. However, it is conceivable that a substantial amount of the acetate is formed by acetogens. The fact that they are able to convert a wide variety of organic compounds to acetate supports this notion.

Most remarkable, perhaps, is the fact that acetogens appear to be involved in an anaerobic degradation of phenylmethylethers (7) that are considered degradation products of lignin (22). Until recently the degradation of lignin was considered to occur only by aerobic processes (163). The fermentation of the methoxyl group of phenylmethylethers by acetogens yields acetate and phenols. The phenols are further degraded to acetate, e.g., by *Pelobacter acidigallici* (121). In cocultures involving *P. acidigallici*, *A. woodii*, and
Methanosarcina barkeri the complete conversion of phenylmethylethers to methane and CO₂ was observed.

Complex organic matter in the anaerobic environment is degraded by a consortium of several types of bacteria. For instance, the degradation of cellulose may involve cellulolytic, cellobiose- and glucose-fermenting, sulfate-reducing, acetogenic, and methanogenic bacteria (77). It has been found that H₂ is essential in the interaction among these bacteria, which involves a process termed interspecies H₂ transfer (15, 51): Some bacteria produce H₂, whereas others consume it. Syntrophic associations based on interspecies H₂ transfer are demonstrated by Syntrophomonas wolfei with a Desulfovibrio species (94) and A. woodii with methanogens (152). The acetogenic bacteria may have an important role in H₂ transfer processes, since they may function both as H₂ producers when fermenting organic compounds and as H₂ consumers when growing autotrophically.

# CONCLUDING REMARKS

Work on acetogenic bacteria has resulted in the elucidation of a new autotrophic pathway of CO₂ fixation, which leads to the synthesis of acetyl-CoA as the primary product. Acetyl-CoA is then used for the synthesis of cell carbon or is excreted as acetic acid. This pathway, or variations of it, seems to be present in several types of anaerobic bacteria including methanogens. It is important for the conversion of organic matter in an anaerobic environment.

All enzymes needed for the complete synthesis of acetate from CO₂, including four tetrahydrofolate enzymes, have been isolated from Clostridium thermoaceticum. The most unique enzymes in the pathway include a tungsten-selenium-iron-containing formate dehydrogenase, a corrinoid protein, transmethylase, and a nickel-zinc-iron CO dehydrogenase. The latter catalyzes the reduction of CO₂ to CO, but also the final step of the pathway which involves the condensation of a methyl group and a carboxyl group with coenzyme A to yield acetyl-CoA.

In this review the discussion has been restricted to the autotrophic pathway in acetogens. One important aspect that has not been covered is the metabolism of the many diverse organic compounds that acetogens can convert to acetate. Another topic that has not been discussed is the potential of acetogens for the industrial production of acetate from biomass including starch, cellulose, and hemicellulose (16, 73, 124, 146).

It should be mentioned that purine fermenting bacteria including Clostridium acidurici, C. cylindrosporum, C. purinolyticum, and Eubacterium angustum have a pathway of synthesis of acetate from CO₂ and one-carbon compounds almost exclusively dependent on tetrahydrofolate (11, 33, 119). Important reactions in this pathway are the formation of glycine from 5,10-

methylene-H₄folate, ammonia, and CO₂, and the direct conversion of glycine to acetate; these reactions are catalyzed by glycine decarboxylase and glycine reductase, respectively. Aspects of this pathway were covered in a recent review (74).
