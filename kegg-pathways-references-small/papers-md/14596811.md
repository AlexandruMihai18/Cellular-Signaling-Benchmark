### Abstract

The GnRH receptor influences gene expression in the gonadotrope through activating signaling cascades that modulate transcription factor expression and activity. A longstanding question in neuroendocrinology is how instructions received at the membrane in the form of the pattern of receptor stimulation are processed into specific biosynthetic changes at each gonadotropin promoter. Signal transduction from the membrane to preformed transcription factors relies on recognition of altered conformations. Signal transduction through the layers of the gene network also requires the biosynthesis of new transcription factors. The signal processing of this system depends on its molecular connectivity map and its feedback and feed-forward loops. Review of signal transduction, gene control, and genomic studies provide evidence of key loops that cross between cellular and nuclear compartments. Genomic studies suggest that the signal transduction and gene network form a continuum. We propose that information transfer in the gonadotrope depends on robust signaling modules that serve to integrate events at different time scales across cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments.

### 1. Introduction

The normal physiologic function of the nervous and endocrine systems depends on the delivery of specific instructions to distant targets which are reliably decoded by the cellular signal transduction network to elicit specific secretory or metabolic responses. The mechanism of addressing these instructions relies largely on the stereospecific interactions between neurotransmitters or hormones and protein receptors in the target cells. The importance of the specificity provided by this system for maintaining homeostasis is evident in the existence of many diseases that interfere with intercellular hormone addressing. A hereditary point mutation of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, for example, that interferes with its ability to distinguish chorionic gonadotropin from thyroid stimulating hormone causes familial gestational hyperthyroidism [145]. The previous decade has witnessed the discovery of a vast number of receptors that provide the backbone of the intercellular address system. The human genome project has revealed more than 1000 rhodopsin-like heptahelical receptors, which constitute the largest family of signaling molecules in the mammalian genome [93,179].

Despite this remarkable success in elucidating this receptor-based addressing system used by hormones, understanding the molecular basis for the subtle and specific transfer of information that occurs after the hormone interacts with its receptors at the target cells remains elusive. The fundamental problem is obvious to many students of the cellular molecular signaling pathways—if many receptors activate the same signaling pathways and the number of pathways are limited, how do specific instructions get transmitted?

The responses elicited by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) provides a puzzle that has long intrigued experimentalists and theoreticians. After release from the hypothalamus, GnRH interacts with specific

high-affinity receptors on the membrane of the pituitary gonadotrope. GnRH is secreted in a pulsatile manner and the normal physiological biosynthetic and secretory responses elicited at the gonadotrope depend largely on the pattern of receptor stimulation. More than two decades ago, studies demonstrated a requirement for pulsatile stimulation for gonadotropin release [8]. In humans, slower pulse frequencies cause anovulation and amenorrhea. Higher frequencies or constant stimulation cause a loss of pituitary responsiveness and a hypogonadal state [198]. How does the gonadotrope decode the pattern of GnRH receptor activation?

The control of biosynthesis by GnRH occurs via its modulation of cellular signaling and of transcription factor activity. The signaling network downstream of the GnRH receptor and the promoter control of the reproductive hormone subunits synthesized by the gonadotrope are current areas of intense study. Over the past several years our laboratory and collaborators developed and applied quantitative genomics and mathematical approaches towards understanding the signal processing that occurs following activation of the GnRH receptor. A surprisingly large number of genes are modulated by GnRH and their identification provides an intriguing glimpse of the organization of a seamlessly integrated signaling and genetic network in the gonadotrope. A review of the recent literature on signal transduction and gene induction in the gonadotrope provides insight into what types of mechanisms may underlie the response specificity of this key locus of the reproductive system.

demonstrate expression of a functional type II receptor in humans. Therefore, we focus on the signaling processes mediated by GnRH interaction with the mammalian GnRH receptor.

GnRH receptors are located in the anterior pituitary on the surface of the pituitary gonadotrope cells (representing 8–15% of anterior pituitary cells), where their activation by GnRH causes the biosynthesis and release of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulated hormone (FSH). The mammalian GnRHR is unique among rhodopsin-family receptors in lacking a carboxyl-terminal domain, a feature that contributes to its relatively slow internalization [17,65, 181], lack of G-protein receptor kinase phosphorylation, and lack of rapid desensitization [39,109,189]. The receptor aggregates upon activation by GnRH, as suggested by early antibody-based assays [30] and by recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays [31].

Many studies indicate that the GnRH receptor activates phospholipase C via Gq/11 family G proteins in both gonadotrope cell lines and in rodent pituitary primary cultures [32,47,58,67,91,141,153,154,162]. Stimulation of LH release following injection of GnRH agonist persists in both Gαq and Gα11 knockout mice, suggesting that the two G-proteins may be able to substitute for each other in GnRH receptor signaling [163]. In addition to its interaction with Gq/11 subclass G-proteins, the GnRH receptor has also been proposed to activate Gi [62,70,91,165] and Gs subtype G-proteins [62,72,76,91,92,100,102,104,165,177]. While the G-protein coupling potential of the GnRH receptor remains controversial, some principles emerge from the many studies addressing this question (see Table 1).

Pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitivity can provide an indication of receptor coupling to Gi/o subtype G-proteins. GnRH receptor coupling has been reported to be inhibited by PTX in the gonadotrope αT3-1 cells [158], as well as in SF9 [40] and COS-7 cells [3,44] that have been transfected with the GnRH receptor. However investigations in several laboratories have failed to confirm either PTX sensitivity or Gi/o coupling in αT3-1 cells [47,149,154]. Overall, while the GnRH receptor does appear to couple to Gi3 in the GnRH neuron [91], the consensus of the literature indicates that coupling of the GnRH receptor to Gi/o subtype G-proteins is not reproducibly observed in the gonadotrope. It is not established that this G-protein subclass contributes significantly to gonadotrope signaling.

GnRH receptor coupling to Gs and/or increased production of cAMP has been reported with heterologous expression of the receptor, transiently in COS-7 cells and stably in somatolactotroph GH3 cells (GGH3 cells) [44,76,92,102]. Grosse and coworkers [47] studied which G-proteins were activated by GnRH using G-protein photolabeling assays. Although these researchers found increased cAMP induced by GnRH, their data suggested

2. Signaling from the GnRH neuron to the gonadotrope gene network

Sixteen structural decapeptide GnRH variants have been isolated from various species and as many as three are expressed in many species (for review see [115,150]). The decapeptide GnRH (pGlu–His–Trp–Ser–Tyr–Gly–Leu–Arg–Pro–Gly–NH₂)) is the major physiological regulator of reproductive function. A conserved heptahelical receptor for GnRH has been cloned from a wide range of vertebrate species [1,20,27,28,43,81, 87,106,135,140,144,175] and a homologous invertebrate receptor has also been identified [61]. The mammalian receptor has 327–328 amino acids and is a member of the rhodopsin-like heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptor family of proteins [138,150]. Additional GnRH receptors, “type II receptors,” that may function as receptors for GnRH variants have been cloned from several vertebrate species [19,114,115,125,126,131,182]. However the role of the type II receptor in reproduction remains to be determined for any species. The importance of GnRH receptor variants for human physiology is unknown, especially in view of the failure thus far to

Gq/11, Gs, Gq/11, Gs, Gq/11, Gs, Gq/11, Gs, Gq/1that stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurred downstream of Gq/11 activation. Results with either the heterologous human receptor expressed in CHO-K1 cells or with the endogenous mouse receptor in αT3-1 cells were consistent with activation solely of Gq/11 subtype G-proteins [47]. Notably, a subsequent study of the closely related LβT2 gonadotrope cell line using cell permeable G-protein inhibitory peptides and GTP loading assays provided evidence that the endogenous mouse receptor in these cells can, in fact, activate both Gq/11 and Gs subtype G-proteins [104]. These studies can be reconciled to suggest that adenylate cyclase may be activated downstream of Gq/11 independently of Gs activation and that the specific cellular context in which the receptor is expressed determines whether coupling to Gs is observed.

GnRH complexing with its receptor results in the activation of phospholipase Cβ through the recruitment of the Gαq/11 G proteins [67]. Phospholipase C catalyzes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to (1,4,5)inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 mobilizes intracellular calcium which activates conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, of which α and βII have been identified in gonadotrope cell lines [74, 75, 103, 105]. The generation of DAG is likely to lead to the activation of novel PKC isoforms, which have also been identified in gonadotrope cells [103]. The initial phase of calcium results from intracellular stores, whereas the plateau phase depends on external calcium influx, predominantly via L-type voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ channels [38, 113, 159, 166, 167]. Phospholipase D (PLD) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) are sequentially activated by GnRH receptor signaling [11, 25, 121, 123, 129, 134, 156, 207], probably via PKC [118, 207]. Late DAG release by phospholipases may cause activation of the calcium-independent novel PKC isoforms, such as PKCε [4, 9, 124, 152], the expression of which is also induced by GnRH receptor activity [60].

Simulation studies of generic signaling cascades have revealed mechanisms by which crosstalk can lead to emergent properties of the signaling network such as bistability [16]. Many of the signaling modules proposed in other experimental systems have potential relevance to the pathways activated by GnRH. For example, ERK has been shown to activate phospholipase A2 in vitro [128], and the arachidonic acid (AA) produced, in conjunction with DAG, may promote activation of PKC [130]. As ERK itself is stimulated downstream of PKC, this forms a potential feed-forward loop that, by itself, would serve to modify GnRH signaling in a manner sensitive to the relative time courses of AA and DAG production [16].

GnRH receptor activation leads to stimulation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades that mediate gene induction [26, 117, 122, 142, 152, 170]. The basic assembly of the MAPK pathways consists of a three-component module that has been conserved from yeast to humans [188]. The MAPK

cascade activation by GnRH involves PKC-dependent and -independent pathways [122]. Four kinase cascades are activated by GnRH receptor signaling, leading to activation of ERK [50, 58, 117, 141, 143, 158, 170, 193], JNK [13, 97, 119, 199], p38MK [143], and BMK [122]. Activation of ERK occurs predominantly via PKC in αT3-1 cells, with some contribution through dynamin [13, 119]. In LβT2 cells, inhibition of conventional PKC only partly inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK by GnRH treatment [103]. Stimulation with GnRH results in phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 [117, 158, 170]. The pathway connecting signaling from the GnRH receptor to ERK is controversial. One group has reported that the GnRH receptor transactivates the EGF receptor which then activates ERK signaling pathways in αT3-1 cells [47]. However, another group studying the same cell line found that ERK activation by GnRH occurs independently of the EGF receptor [13]. Calcium influx through L-type calcium channels depends on PKC activation and appears to contribute to ERK activation in αT3-1 cells and in primary pituitary cultures [119, 120]. Notably, while the activation of ERK by GnRH in αT3-1 cells requires influx of calcium through L-type calcium channel, JNK activation is dependent only on mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores [119]. In LβT2 cells, conflicting observations on the role of L-type calcium channels in activating ERK have been reported [103, 199]. The increase in calcium concentration in the cytoplasm can also activate other protein kinases such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, independently of PKC or other members of the MAPK family [73, 119]. One study in αT3-1 cells reported that JNK-activation is PKC-dependent [97], whereas other groups studying αT3-1 cells [119] and LβT2 cells [199] have found that JNK activation occurs independently of PKC. Activation of p38 MAPK has also been reported to be PKC-dependent [143].

The active MAPKs translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription factors, such as Ets-family proteins, and thereby modulate the promoter activity of various genes [23, 49, 108, 133, 142, 183, 184, 194, 200]. A consensus map of the major signaling network components that transmit the formation of the GnRH-receptor complex to activation of nuclear kinases is shown in Fig. 1. As will be described in subsequent sections, the gene program responses have their own connectivity map, with the connections determined by the need for induction and synthesis of specific transcription factors.

in vivo [37,51] and in vitro [76,157,176,183,185]. In general, the α-subunit responds to constant exposure or high pulse frequency (~q 10 min), whereas the LHβ subunit promoter responds best to lower frequency pulses (~q 30–60 min) and FSHβ to even lower frequencies.

The experimental literature on the signaling pathways and transcription complexes mediating the GnRH response of these promoters can provide hypotheses about where the frequency decoder of the gonadotrope is likely to reside. Seminal models of GnRH receptor signaling by Goldbeter [98,99] were based on the frequency sensitivity arising from receptor desensitization. However, subsequent research on the induction of gonadotropin genes by GnRH make a proximal mechanism a less likely explanation for the dependence of gene induction of the frequency of GnRH receptor activation. Unlike many heptahelical receptors, the GnRH receptor itself shows minimal desensitization [39,109,189]. Furthermore, a mechanism of frequency sensitivity based on signaling components common to induction of all gonadotropin subunits would not explain the different frequency response characteristics of the various subunits.

The role of signaling and promoter structure in induction of each of the gonadotropin subunits suggests that their control mechanisms and positioning in the gene network may contribute to their differences in frequency sensitivity.

The structures of connections between the signaling network and each gonadotropin subunit promoter are unique. The common α-gonadotropin subunit functions as a primary gene, with several studies suggesting that its induction by GnRH is mediated by the activation of preformed transcription factors. LHβ, in contrast, has a complex promoter that requires simultaneous activation by preexisting and newly synthesized transcription factors for activation. These differences in the positioning of these promoters within the signaling and gene network of the gonadotrope suggest mechanisms for their differential sensitivity to patterns of receptor stimulation.

### 3.1. Common gonadotropin α-subunit

The mouse α-subunit promoter contains two distinct regions that are critical for activity [148] (Fig. 2). These regions, the pituitary glycoprotein basal element (PGBE) and the GnRH response element (GnRH-RE), contain interaction sites for LIM-homeobox and Ets family transcription factors, respectively. The PGBE region, in conjunction with other promoter sites, influences the basal expression of the common gonadotropin subunit transcript, whereas the GnRH-RE mediates GnRH-stimulated induction. A GnRH-RE has also been characterized in the human α subunit promoter [82].

PKC family members have been implicated as upstream activators of the α-subunit promoter. Several

studies have shown that PKC activation through TPA treatment activates the α-subunit promoter. PKC downregulation by PMA exposure or by PKC inhibitors are each able to reduce GnRH induced α-subunit promoter stimulation [12, 170, 184]. As described above, GnRH activation leads to a rise in cytosolic calcium levels through activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum. Some studies have found a positive role for calcium [12, 59], while others suggest that it contributes little to α-subunit stimulation [184].

A role for ERK in induction of the common α-subunit gene has been suggested by experiments using the MEK specific inhibitor PD98059 and dominant-negative ERK pathway expression vectors [59, 142]. Active ERK can translocate to the nucleus and directly activate transcription factors [59, 184].

A functional Ets site exists within the GnRH-RE of the mouse α-subunit promoter. Transfection of dominant negative Ets constructs inhibited activation of the mouse α-subunit promoter demonstrating a requirement for an activated Ets family member binding to the GnRH-RE [142]. As Elk-1 is a known substrate of ERK, it is a likely candidate for mediating α-subunit regulation.

The signaling pathways and transcriptional mechanisms connecting GnRH receptor activation to induction of the common α-subunit gene provides a relatively direct pathway. GnRH receptor activation rapidly activates PKC isoforms which, in turn, activate the ERK pathway. ERK translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates Elk1 [172]. Elk1 can directly interact with the Ets site in the GnRH-RE turning on transcription of the α-subunit gene [142]. As will be described in Section 5, this wiring approximates a feed-forward serial network that has frequency response characteristics in mathematical simulations similar to what is observed for the common α-subunit gene in vitro and in vivo.

3.2. LHβ

The LHβ promoter differs in many fundamental aspects from the common α-subunit promoter. The LHβ promoter is deeper in the gene network. Unlike the common α-subunit promoter, the induction of the LHβ gene shows the absolute requirement for the induction of at least one newly synthesized transcription factor, Egr1. In addition, many experiments on this promoter suggest that it requires an assembly of multiple transcription

factors for its activation by GnRH. Thus the LHβ promoter requires the concomitant assembly of both newly synthesized and preformed transcription factors for its activation. LHβ induction by GnRH is also likely to involve phosphorylation of transcription factors. These features of the LHβ system, the need for newly synthesized and preformed transcription factors and their modulation by phosphorylation, might contribute to the known frequency-decoding behavior of this gene.

Many in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that pulsatile GnRH exposure is optimal for stimulation of LHβ biosynthesis and secretion. Although the results vary in different experimental systems, in general a pulse period of approximately 30–60 min has been found to be most effective for stimulating LHβ gene induction in rodent models [21, 37, 52, 78, 157, 176]. A similar optimal frequency was observed in a study of LHβ induction in response to periodic calcium influx induced by activation of L-type calcium channels [53] and the persistent activation of MAP kinase activity has also been found to require pulsatile GnRH administration [50]. The connections from the GnRH receptor to the LHβ promoter are more complicated than the common α-subunit gene both in terms of the number of factors involved and differences in the timing of the processes required for induction. Transcription factor phosphorylation and the biosynthesis of new transcription factors occur with distinct time courses following receptor activation.

The LHβ promoter can be divided into two distinct proximal and distal domains, that lie within 500 bp of the transcription start site and that may act together as a composite GnRH-response element [80, 139] (Fig. 2). Cis-Acting elements are located 150 bp upstream from the start site. They comprise the tandem gonadotrope-specific elements (GSE) that bind SF-1 [77, 139]. The proximal domain also contains a pair of regulatory elements that bind Egr-1 [77, 139, 183]. Located between the pairs of Egr-1 and SF-1 binding elements in the proximal domain is a single binding site for Pitx-1 [139]. The LHβ promoter shows variation in different species. In the rat promoter, there are several putative binding sites for Sp1 within the GnRH responsive region. At least two Sp1 consensus sites are situated at the 3′-segment of the distal domain of the LHβ gene [80, 183] and one located in the 5′-region [183]. The Sp1 site at the 5′ region of the promoter overlaps a CarG box [183]. When Sp1 binds to these sites it can interact with SF1 and Egr1 in the proximal promoter [77, 183]. In the bovine LHβ promoter, the distal domain contains NF-Y binding sites [84].

Several transcription factors act in concert to mediate induction of the LHβ promoter by GnRH. In the gonadotrope LβT2 cells, SF-1 has been reported to synergize with Egr1 in the induction of LHβ by GnRH [41, 173]. LHβ promoter deletion studies indicated that Sp1 sites and a CaRG box are required for GnRH induction and that the CaRG box specifically contributes to the response to pulsatile GnRH [183]. In non-gonadotrope lines, SF-1, Sp1 [77], and Nab [151] have been implicated in contributing to the induction of the LHβ promoter by GnRH. Although the precise model of the control of the LHβ promoter by multiple transcription factors is evolving, many studies are consistent with the involvement of several transcription factors in its synergistic activation by GnRH [24, 41, 55, 85, 112, 139, 146, 174]. One study compared the role of the proximal Pitx1 site in cell lines and in transgenic models [139]. Notably, the Pitx1 site was found to partly contribute to the induction of the LHβ promoter by GnRH in cell lines, whereas induction was completely dependent on this site in the transgenic lines. It is not surprising that the behavior of these promoters may be very sensitive to the concentration of transcription factors and other signal mediators. Nonetheless these findings provide a caveat about reliability of extending the in vivo analysis of promoter responses to the gonadotrope in vivo.

In vivo gene deletion models also support a role for both Egr1 and SF1 in LHβ gene induction, with Egr1 serving a more essential function. Targeted mouse gene-deletion models indicate that Egr1 induction is required for the expression of LHβ. Mice lacking Egr-1 were infertile and failed to synthesize LH [95, 171]. The egr1 promoter contains two regions that have been identified by deletion analysis as important for its induction by GnRH in LβT2 cells [42]. SF1 contributes to the induction of LHβ, although mouse gene deletion studies suggest that it is possible to compensate for its absence. Both global and gonadotrope targeted SF1 gene deletion models are infertile. However, LH release can be restored in SF1 mutant mice by GnRH administration [22, 69, 206].

Phosphorylation of existing or newly synthesized transcription factors is also likely to be important in controlling the activity of the LHβ promoter. Several transcription factors implicated in LHβ induction are modulated by phosphorylation. SP1-family transcription factors, for example, can be phosphorylated [132]. SF-1 activity is regulated through phosphorylation by a MAPK-dependent mechanism that enhances the binding of cofactors [57]. Egr1 can be phosphorylated by PKC and PKC has been shown to augment the induction of the LHβ promoter by Egr-1 [173]. c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK may also contribute to GnRH-stimulated LHβ gene transcription [199]. A recent mass spectrometry study of promoter bound Pitx-1 using GnRH agonist-treated LβT2 cells showed that this transcription factor is phosphorylated on three sites when bound to DNA [112].

Although there are some inconsistencies in the literature, most studies implicate two GnRH receptor-modulated signaling pathways in LHβ gene activation: a PKC/MAPK pathway [23, 56, 147, 173] and calcium signaling
via L-type calcium channels [10,53,54,103,184]. The induction of the LHβ gene by calcium has been found to be frequency-dependent [53, 54]. A role for JNK in the induction of an LHβ promoter construct by GnRH receptor in LβT2 cells has also been proposed [199].

### 3.3. FSHβ

The mechanisms underlying the effects of GnRH on the induction of FSHβ, which have been recently reviewed [116], are less well defined than those of the common α-subunit or LHβ subunit genes. Although the role of GnRH in stimulated expression of FSHβ expression is well established [33,35,46,51,107], this effect in vivo is largely indirect and results from the induction of TGFβ family members [15]. Notably, the induction of activin and follistatin occurs preferentially at particular GnRH frequencies in primary cultures [36]. As has been the case for LHβ, there has been some discordance between the results obtained with in vitro and in vivo models. AP-1-like sites have been identified in the FSHβ promoter and their contribution to regulation by GnRH suggested by some, but not all, studies in transfected cells [168,169,178] (see Fig. 2). However, when these sites were mutated in an FSHβ reporter construct that in wild-type sequence showed appropriate physiological regulation in a transgenic model, the control of the promoter was unaffected [68]. Calcium, PKC, and MAPK have all been implicated in the signaling pathways involving activation of the FSHβ promoter in LβT2 cells [178].

The potential contribution of paracrine, autocrine, and multiple GnRH-stimulated pathways in the gonadotrope provide potential circuits that could serve as frequency decoders. Notably, the involvement of activin induction in mediating the effects of GnRH on the FSHβ gene is somewhat parallel to the requirement for EGR1 biosynthesis for the activation of the LHβ gene. Although most of the details of the FSHβ wiring diagram remain to be elucidated, the commonality of the requirement for new biosynthesis for both LHβ and FSHβ corresponds with a preference for a relatively long GnRH pulse intervals for induction. Therefore it appears likely that the temporal dispersion of events required for activation of the LHβ and FSHβ promoters are likely to be an important feature in their frequency-response characteristics.

## 4. Genomics studies of gonadotrope gene network

Genomic studies provide the ability to investigate systematically the pattern of gene responses following activation of the GnRH receptor [195, 197]. Our laboratory has utilized microarrays and high throughput quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) to study GnRH receptor-mediated responses in LβT2 cells. Microarrays provide the opportunity to survey global changes in gene expression. High throughput qRTPCR allows accurate measurement of the relative changes of expression of specific transcripts and provides the capacity to assay the large number of samples required for detailed characterization of gene changes over time or in response to varying stimuli [203]. The integration of microarray technology and high throughput mRNA assays by qRTPCR makes it possible to evaluate the biosynthetic responses that occur following activation of the GnRHR both globally and accurately [202].

### 4.1. Gene program activated by GnRH in LβT2 cells

In order to understand how the signaling pathways activated by the GnRH receptor percolate through the gene network to modulate the levels of specific tertiary genes, we studied the gene changes that occur rapidly after GnRH exposure in the LβT2 gonadotrope cell line. A sensitive and specific early gene microarray was fabricated for these studies [196]. Nine hundred and fifty-six cDNAs were selected for the microarray design and each gene was spotted in triplicate to provide repeated measures of each sample. In our initial experiments with this array, three independent replicated experiments comparing the effects of 1 h GnRH or vehicle treatment on LβT2 cells were performed and all genes identified as differentially expressed on the microarray were confirmed by qRTPCR assays [196]. Subsequent studies using both the cDNA array and commercial oligonucleotide arrays were undertaken to define the pattern of gene induction over the first 6 h of GnRH exposure [202].

These studies demonstrated that the gene program induced by GnRH in LβT2 cells is much broader and complex than had been previously suspected. The number of genes modulated during the first few hours in response to activation of the GnRHR is remarkable, especially in view of the relatively few genes previously reported to be regulated by GnRH in any gonadotrope system. In experiments that included independent confirmation by qRTPCR, we have identified increased expression of 44 genes within 1 h of GnRH exposure and of 31 additional genes within 3–6 h of exposure ([196] and unpublished data).

The classes of proteins encoded by the transcripts induced by GnRH receptor activation are illustrated in Fig. 3. The largest class of regulated genes in the first wave of gene activation encode inducible transcription factors. As described earlier, the transcript for *egr-1* had been previously reported to be induced by GnRH in the gonadotrope and studies suggest that its induction is required for subsequent activation of the LHβ promoter [77, 183]. We have identified the modulation of a surprisingly large number of other transcription factor genes that may also play an important role in the subsequent induction of tertiary genes such as LHβ.
mkp1 is induced by GnRH. Induction of map kinase phosphatases would provide feedback suppression of MAPK activity. Induction of the small G-protein Kir/ Gem would also contribute to negative feedback by decreasing the level of calcium influx through L-type calcium channels [7]. Thus the genomics studies suggest that the signaling from the receptor to the gene network forms a continuum and that many of the genes induced, after synthesis, constitute negative feedback loops to components of the signaling network.

### 4.2. Concentration-dependence of the gonadotrope gene program

There are three component features of GnRHR stimulation that could contribute encoding of the specific

Fig. 3. Schematic of transcripts regulated by GnRH in LβT2 cells. Reprinted from [196]. With permission of The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

These include the immediate genes egr2, c-fos, klf4, and the secondary genes nab1 and nab2. As consensus egr2 binding sites are present in the LHβ promoter (Fig. 2), there is a potential role for egr2 induction in the control of this gonadotropin subunit. Transcription factors acting at SP1 sites have been implicated in LHβ gene activation. One of the induced transcripts, klf4, is a member of the Sp/Xklf family [136]. As described above, Nab, in association with Egr1, has been reported to cause a paradoxical activation of the LHβ promoter [151]. In addition to nab1, which has been reported to be induced by GnRH in αT3-1 cells [194], we find that the closely related nab2 is also induced. These results suggest that the control of transcription at the LHβ promoter may be more complex than previously anticipated.

The second largest class of genes induced encode proteins involved in signal transduction and their identities suggest they represent a genomic response contributing to feedback inhibition that opposes the actions of GnRH-stimulated signaling. The induction of IkB would be expected to decrease signaling by NFkB. RGS2, a regulator of G-protein signaling, increases the GTPase activity especially at Gq and would be expected functionally to inhibit Gq-mediated signaling [83]. The effect of RGS2 in this system may be complex. Neill and coworkers [127] have reported that expression of RGS2 in COS cells did not affect GnRHR signaling. However, it has recently been reported that RGS2 is itself inactivated by protein kinase C activity [34]. Thus the effect of RGS2 on GnRH receptor signaling will depend on the level of protein kinase C activity in the gonadotrope. GnRH induction of map kinase phosphatase 2 (mkp2) has been previously reported [205]. We also find that

stimulus to the genome: amplitude (concentration), frequency, and pulse duration. In order to begin to elucidate the relationship between these input parameters and the gene program, we have quantified the relationship between the level of GnRH exposure to the subsequent rate of early and intermediate gene induction using microarrays and qRT-PCR [201].

A detailed time course study of the induction of early and secondary genes was performed with different concentrations of GnRH exposure. The resulting gene trajectories demonstrate that the temporal pattern of induction is unaffected by concentration (see Fig. 4). The overall shapes of these gene trajectories are similar at differing concentrations of GnRH exposure. However, their amplitudes are not—all of the genes studied show a direct correlation of the concentration of GnRH and the levels of transcript induced. When studied at the level of a population of cells, the induction of primary genes appears to be well described by a mathematical model that describes a hyperbolic stimulus response function ([201] and unpublished data). However, it is important to recognize that the average behavior of a population of cells may be a poor approximation of the stimulus-response characteristics at the single cell level. It was demonstrated more than a decade ago that single gonadotropes can show an all-or-none LH release pattern to varying concentrations of GnRH [96] and a similarly bistable response has been reported for MAP kinase activation by hormones in other systems [5, 45]. Therefore, an accurate assessment of the coupling between receptor occupancy and gene activation will require determination of the single cell responses.

and the role of individual signaling components, may be understood through the development of new experimental and theoretical approaches that can approach signaling as a network phenomenon. Quantitation of responses can be integrated with the development of computational models that organize and predict molecular responses [16, 18, 66, 86, 88, 94, 186]. The computational simulation of cell signaling network behavior leads to the emergence of novel bistable patterns that may be important in molecular switch mechanisms [16].

One goal of mathematical modeling of signaling systems is to develop models that are robust—i.e., models that are relatively insensitive to the values attained by any specific parameters. One example of a robust mathematical model was developed to study *Drosophila* segmentation. This model proposed a new feedback loop that was required for model robustness and that was later experimentally verified [180]. The gonadotrope signaling system is obviously very robust. Its reliable functioning has allowed reproduction to occur throughout mammalian evolution. The discrepancies between results obtained in experimental models of gonadotrope signaling could represent a lack of robustness of those experimental models, and may be obscuring the robustness of the mechanisms that underlie signal decoding in the gonadotropes. The mathematical testing of circuits based on cell line models provides an important assessment of robustness and therefore potential relevance to gonadotrope signaling and can also be useful in generating hypotheses for experimental testing.

Mathematical modeling can play an important role in trying to understand the integration of the various elements of GnRH receptor modulated signaling in control of specific gene promoters. Several models for LH release have recently been developed, which are modifications of the seminal Goldbeter models [98, 99]. Blum et al. [18] proposed a model to evaluate LH release following activation of the GnRHR. This model takes into account the number of GnRH receptors, which has been proposed to be important in frequency decoding [79]. It comprises three main steps: hormone binding at the receptor, regulation of calcium at the IP3 channels, and LH release. Heinze et al. [66] also describes a mathematical model for LH release. This model takes into account the administration of GnRH pulses and receptor desensitization. The model is based on three receptor states (active, bound, and desensitized) and two compartments of LH within the cell. However, the experimental literature suggests that receptor desensitization is not a major component of type I GnRH receptor signaling [110]. These models describe some aspects of GnRH regulation of LH release.

The mechanisms underlying the frequency dependence of LH release are likely to be distinct from those controlling the biosynthesis of the gonadotropins.

## 5. Mathematical simulations

The controversies in the literature concerning many aspects of the mechanism of signaling described in earlier sections may result from the dependence of the effects of inhibition of the various intermediaries on the specific experimental system and conditions. These discrepancies, which make it difficult to compare experimental results, may be exaggerated by the limitations of our present interpretative framework. The dependence of input and output on any specific component is in part determined by assessing the degree to which the output (e.g., induction of a specific gene following GnRH exposure) is eliminated by inhibition of the component. Depending on the result, the outcome is judged to be either fully or partly dependent on or independent of that factor. However, cellular signaling systems are not adequately represented by such a linear chain of causation. Computer simulations of intracellular signaling networks suggest that discrete network states can exist that are only loosely tied to any particular signaling component. The behavior of these signaling networks,We have begun to use mathematical modeling to explain data obtained using quantitative genomics and to generate hypotheses about frequency decoding of the system. In the study of the concentration-dependence of gene responses, we were interested in determining whether the differences in the rate of induction of various genes in response to varying concentrations of GnRH was due in part to differences in the delay from GnRH exposure to gene activation. We proposed a model correlating the concentration of GnRH to the level of activity of RNA polymerase and focused on the induction of two genes, Gly96 and Tis11 [201]. The analysis of detailed measurements obtained in LβT2 cells using this model indicated that the time until initial gene activation following GnRH is independent of the concentration of GnRH.

We also have investigated the behavior of simple circuit prototypes as frequency decoding modules [90]. The three simple circuits we modeled are shown in Fig. 5 and termed feed-forward serial, feed-forward parallel, and recurrent parallel. Although these circuits are obviously a dramatic reduction of the known gonadotrope signaling network shown in Fig. 1, they help guide the experimentation by evaluating how modules embedded in this network may mediate frequency decoding. Interestingly, the simple feed-forward serial, which reflects the direct wiring of the common α-subunit promoter, shows a lack of frequency response preference that is consonant with experimental data on the common α-subunit gene response characteristics. The recurrent parallel structure shows a robust capability to link biosynthesis to a particular frequency of stimulation. Whether a similar circuit contributes to this response pattern of the LHβ or FSHβ promoters will require identification and confirmation of these modules in the gonadotrope.

### 6. Mechanisms of tertiary gene control

As reviewed in previous sections, activation of the GnRH receptor leads to stimulation of a relatively small number of proximal signal mediators, including Gqα, βγ subunits, Gsα, and dynamin [14]. These proximal signal mediators in turn lead to activation of a number of terminal kinases, including ERKs, JNK, and P38 MAPK. Activation of these kinases induces a very large number of proximal and secondary genes. We can visualize signaling originating at the GnRHR as a diverging beam which encompasses an increasing group of signaling proteins. At the level of the primary and secondary genes, this beam reaches its maximal width where several dozen primary and secondary genes are activated. The pattern of activation does not continue to diverge. Indeed, the activation of dozens of primary and secondary genes must then converge, influenced by the pattern of GnRHR stimulation, to activate specific downstream tertiary genes. Convergence can be observed in our failure to detect any transcripts that are first elevated following a few hours of constant GnRH-exposure (unpublished data). Thus, after these two initial waves of widespread gene induction, the subsequent gene responses appear much more restricted.

With such a large number of regulated transcripts induced in the first few hours following GnRHR activation, how is the signaling specificity to downstream gene targets achieved? We suggest that the convergence of this signaling and the well-known frequency-dependent induction of specific downstream gene targets may result from the interplay of feedback and biosynthetic events that occur at different time scales following GnRHR stimulation. A variety of studies on the induction of the LHβ promoter reviewed above suggest

Arrows indicate positive inputs and boxes negative inputs. A represents the active intermediary and C is the desired product. Mathematical simulations of the frequency response characteristics of these circuits suggest that the feed-forward serial circuit shows no true frequency preference. More C will be generated at a higher frequency of A. The feed-forward parallel circuit behaves as a pulse counter. The recurrent parallel circuit shows significant decreases in the formation of C at low and high frequencies of activation of A, thus providing robust frequency decoding. Characterization of the behavior of simple models can assist in identifying and testing the behavior of circuit models within the complex signaling network in the gonadotrope. Adapted from [90].

that this promoter binds transcription factors relatively weakly and an aggregate of transcription factors have been implicated in its GnRH-stimulated induction, including Egr1, Nab1, Pitx1, SF1, SP1 factors, SP3 factors, and AP1 complexes. While the absolute necessity of individual transcription factors may vary in different experimental systems, the data suggest the necessity for the simultaneous presence of multiple transcription factors for LHβ gene activation. We suggest that the induction of the frequency-dependent genes, such as LHβ gene may require the concurrence of events that occur at different times following GnRHR activation. The frequency dependence of activation or induction of individual components, such as EGR1 for the LHβ promoter or activin for leading to activation of the FSHβ promoter may depend on frequency decoding modules, such as those described above [90].

The behavior of a signaling system is critically dependent on the structure of negative and positive feedback loops. Various components of GnRHR-mediated signaling are regulated. The GnRH receptor itself is regulated by GnRH, with low level, pulsatile stimulation causing an increase in receptor level. GnRH receptor regulation has been proposed to contribute to preferential induction of LHβ by pulsatile stimulation [79]. GnRH receptor mRNA is regulated by GnRH in some paradigms. GnRH regulation of the GnRH receptor gene may result, in part, from an ERK-dependent activation of a canonical AP-1 site located in the proximal promoter of the GnRH receptor gene [101, 187]. A truncated splice-variant of the human GnRH receptor has been identified that interferes with wild-type receptor signaling [48, 89]. The Gq/11 G proteins are downregulated by GnRH [154, 162] and stimulation of the GnRH receptor induces palmitoylation of multiple G-proteins in rat gonadotropes [162, 164]. GnRH induces a rapid uncoupling of IP3 production and calcium signaling [111] due to loss of the type I IP3 receptor, due predominantly to proteosomal degradation [190, 192]. GnRH also induces PKCε gene expression at 1 h in αT3-1 cells in a PKC-dependent manner [60] and PLA2 activation induces PKCβ [155]. Neill and coworkers [127] reported that expression of RGS3, which increases G-protein GTPase activity, suppresses GnRH receptor signaling in COS cells. We found a rapid induction of RGS2 mRNA by GnRH receptor activation of LβT2 cells. GnRH receptor activation also has recently been reported to induce expression of map kinase phosphatase-2 (MKP-2) in both primary rat culture and αT3 cells. MKP induction is dependent on both JNK and ERK activity and on intracellular calcium [160, 204]. MKP-2 could contribute to feedback inhibition of MAPKs. Translational control mechanisms have also been reported. GnRH receptor activation increases translation in αT3 cells, through a PKC and Ras-dependent mechanism [160].

An overall formulation for the control of tertiary genes is illustrated in Fig. 6. We can distinguish roughly three temporally distinct events that may contribute to activation of the promoter of a tertiary gene such as LHβ: I. <30 min: transcription factor phosphorylation (e.g., c-Jun-phosphorylation), II. 0.5–3 h: primary transcript protein formation, and III. 2–6 h: secondary transcript protein formation. Induction of tertiary downstream gene targets such as LHβ may occur at a slower time scale. For example, pulses of GnRH have been found to induce increases in LHβ in the LβT2 cells after 3 days [176]. Thus we propose that induction of the LHβ gene requires the concurrence of transient responses that occur at these different time scales after receptor activation, for example activation of a transcription factor by phosphorylation, synthesis of primary products such as Egr1 and Klf4, and synthesis of secondary gene products such as Nab1 or Nab2.

Fig. 6. Schematic illustrating the integration of temporally dispersed events for activation of a tertiary promoter such as LHβ. The induction of a tertiary gene requires the presence of multiple phosphorylated and newly synthesized transcription factors that are generated at different times following GnRH receptor activation. The negative feedback loops are proposed to lead to the concurrence of these factors to occur preferentially following different frequencies of receptor stimulation. I. <30 min: (blue) receptor signaling and activation of preformed transcription factors. II. 0.5–3 h: (red) primary gene products synthesized. III. 2–6 h: (green) secondary gene products synthesized. IV. Days: (orange) tertiary gene products synthesized. Continuously present transcription factors are black. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

Constant stimulation of the receptor would not lead to the required assembly of synthesized and activated transcription factors because of the activity of negative feedback loops. These negative feedback loops include desensitization of signaling components (such as the IP3 receptor [191]) and the variety of induced genes that negatively regulate the activity of early loci in the network, as described above.

## 7. Conclusions

Considerable progress has been made in developing the connectivity map downstream of the GnRH receptor. Genomics investigations have provided a comprehensive assessment of genetic network feed-forward and feedback loops that may contribute to the physiologically important differences in the GnRH-frequency sensitivity of the various gonadotropin subunit genes. Mathematical modeling has begun to probe the way in which prototype modules of the signaling circuit might serve as robust GnRH frequency decoders. The objective of work on this system is to develop predictive and experimentally testable hypotheses about its responses to specific patterns of receptor stimulation. While controversies abound and myriad questions remain, the field is progressing rapidly. Experimental and theoretical biology are converging on a fundamental understanding of the alchemy that regulates the exquisite and biologically crucial control of the GnRH receptor signaling system.
