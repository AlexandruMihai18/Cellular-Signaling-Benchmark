## Postsynaptic Signaling Networks: Cellular Cogwheels Underlying Long-Term Plasticity

### Robert D. Blitzer, Ravi Iyengar, and Emmanuel M. Landau

Learning depends on positive or negative changes in synaptic transmission that are synapse-specific and sustained. Synaptic signals can be directly measured and respond to certain kinds of stimulation by becoming persistently enhanced (long-term potentiation, LTP) or decreased (long-term depression, LTD). Studying LTP and LTD opens a window on to the molecular mechanisms of memory. Although changes in both pre- and postsynaptic strength have been implicated in LTP and LTD, most attention has been focused on changes in postsynaptic glutamate receptor density. This is controlled by intracellular Ca²⁺ ions via a network of signaling molecules. Changes in postsynaptic Ca²⁺ concentration depend on the coincidence of appropriate synaptic signals, as is found in learning situations. The long-term persistence of LTP and LTD requires gene transcription and translation. It is posited that local translation at the synapse, in a self-sustaining manner, mediates the persistence of long-term changes despite constant turnover of the synaptic components.

The brain changes throughout life and embodies memories, skills, and emotions, as well as mental diseases and addictions. Many of these changes in the brain are persistent and have profound effects on human behavior. Long-term changes in brain function are called neuroplasticity.

The brain is an enormous network of 10¹¹ neurons, each receiving some 10⁴ inputs and issuing close to 10⁴ outputs. The number of contacts between neurons (synapses) thus approaches 10¹⁵. It is believed that changes in the number of synapses or their effectiveness underlie neural plasticity. Early in life, neuroplasticity is mediated by cell division, migration of neurons, and growth of neuronal processes. Later in life, these processes are much curtailed, and it is predominantly the change in the efficacy of synaptic transmission that serves neural plasticity, although long-term changes in neuronal excitability also may play a role (Frick et al 2004). The three major questions that need to be answered in this field are the following: 1) how does the neuron modify synaptic transmission at specific synapses or groups of synapses; 2) how do such changes last for long periods of time, and 3) what distinguishes synaptic potentiation from synaptic depression. Our discussion concentrates on long-term synaptic potentiation but will also mention long-term synaptic depression for comparison.

Synaptic efficacy can be enhanced by increased transmitter release from presynaptic terminals as well as by increased postsynaptic responsiveness. There is compelling evidence for postsynaptic participation in processes of synaptic plasticity (for review, see Malenka and Nicoll 1999), but a presynaptic contribution has not been ruled out (for review, see Lisman 2003). Our discussion is limited to the better-known postsynaptic mechanism.

Long-term increases in synaptic efficacy can be studied at the cellular level (long-term potentiation, LTP). Multiple forms of LTP exist in many areas of the brain, but much research has been done on hippocampal LTP, in particular on LTP in the synapses between area CA3 and area CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 1). These neurons communicate via the transmitter glutamate, which has two predominant receptor subtypes: the AMPA receptor (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor, composed of subunits GluR1–4) and the NMDA receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, composed of NR1 and NR2A-D subunits). The glutamate receptors, like other ligand-gated receptors, have an ion channel that opens upon activation. The regular excitatory postsynaptic potential is mediated by the AMPA receptors, whereas the NMDA receptors have a much higher affinity for glutamate but yield much smaller and longer-lasting signals. The NMDA receptors allow Ca²⁺ ions into the synapse, whereas AMPA receptors generally do not. By employing brain slices as well as organotypic hippocampal or primary cell cultures, LTP can be studied in vitro. Many experimental approaches can be brought to bear on the mechanisms of LTP, including electrophysiology, biochemistry, histochemistry, and molecular biology.

When studying LTP one is interested in the mechanisms required for induction of LTP and in the processes that allow long-term maintenance of LTP. Different protocols of stimulation can be used to induce LTP, and they result in LTP of different durations. One can conclude that induction processes may vary, producing different modes of maintenance.

In our discussion, we distinguish between processes that set up a transient or early LTP (E-LTP) of various durations and those that set up a persistent one (late LTP, L-LTP; Winder et al 1998); E-LTP may last 1–3 hours, whereas L-LTP can be studied for up to 8 hours in vitro and for many months in vivo. Early LTP involves activation of kinases and phosphatases, and translocation of kinases and receptors to the postsynaptic membrane. Late LTP requires gene transcription and translation. In the first part of the discussion, we address the signaling network implicated in the induction of early LTP and the general properties of networks required for such a task. In the second part, we review late LTP and the signaling processes involved.

### The Induction of LTP

#### The Role of Glutamate Receptors

The major mechanism for the expression of LTP is an increase in the postsynaptic response to glutamate via the AMPA receptors, although a role for changes in NMDA receptor density has recently been proposed (Grosshans et al 2002). The increase in

the synaptic response to glutamate is mediated by increased conductance of the AMPA receptor ion channels and by accelerated insertion of these receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. The reverse occurs for LTD. The GluR subunits involved and their phosphorylation sites have been thoroughly studied (for review, see Malinow and Malenka 2002). Of particular importance is the subsynaptic cytoskeleton or scaffold, the “postsynaptic density,” where glutamate receptors and various kinases and phosphatases are embedded. A molecular “slot” was hypothesized as the site for the glutamate receptor insertion (Shi et al 2001).

This process is tightly regulated by the neuron to prevent spurious long-term synaptic changes. The regulation is based on the requirement for coincident signals to activate LTP. Coincidence detectors are important regulators of signaling networks, where they are considered “network junctions” (Jordan et al 2000; Weng et al 1999). The prime coincidence detector in LTP is the NMDA receptor, which requires concurrent glutamate binding and postsynaptic depolarization to be activated (Herron et al 1986). This is because the NMDA receptor channel, even when opened upon activation, is plugged by an extracellular Mg²⁺ ion. A reduction in the negative membrane potential (depolarization) is then required to expel this ion out of the channel (Ascher and Nowak 1988). The discovery of this property of the NMDA receptor generated much excitement because one can see a relation between this and associative learning. Thus, a conditioning stimulus (e.g., the sound of a bell, usually weak) will suffice to release a small amount of glutamate that binds to the higher affinity NMDA receptors. The unconditioned stimulus (e.g., electric shock, usually stronger) will release more glutamate, sufficient to activate AMPA receptors and trigger action potentials to depolarize the neuron. This combination will allow Ca²⁺ ions to flow into the relevant neurons. The association between disparate stimuli can thus occur at a single molecule to effect long-term synaptic change.

## The Role of Ca²⁺/Calmodulin-Dependent Kinase Type II

The activation of the NMDA receptor allows Ca²⁺ ions to enter the neurons, where they activate a large number of cellular processes. A major target for Ca²⁺ is Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CaMKII), a major component of the postsynaptic density. Among its many actions are the phosphorylation of GluR1 at serine 831 (which increases the channel conductance of the AMPA receptor; Lee et al 2000), and the insertion of the receptor into the postsynaptic membrane (through an indirect mechanism; Hayashi et al 2000). From a network perspective, the multiple effects of activated CaMKII define it as a “node,” a point where a signal is split and directed to multiple targets.

CaMKII is a holoenzyme with 14 subunits, each comprising catalytic, autoinhibitory, and anchoring domains (Hoelz et al 2003). The kinase becomes activated when it binds Ca²⁺/calmodulin (CaM), which removes the enzyme’s autoinhibition. (For a review of the basic properties of CaMKII, see Lisman et al 2002.) The subunits act on their substrates but also phosphorylate neighboring subunits on threonine 286. This increases the affinity of the subunits for CaM a thousandfold and effectively traps CaM, resulting in a prolonged activation of the enzyme. The activity of CaMKII is enhanced by binding to the cytoplasmic carboxy terminus of the NMDA receptor 2B subunit (NR2B). This binding permits autonomous kinase activity, facilitates intersubunit interaction, and suppresses the inhibitory autophosphorylation of the enzyme at threonine 305/306 (Bayer et al 2001). In addition, the binding of CaMKII to NR2B anchors the enzyme,

ing network of the neuron, the gate mechanism serves to connect the signaling network to the mechanism of LTP.

An analysis of the signaling network that is activated by LTP-inducing stimulation suggests many possible interactions between CaMKII and other signaling molecules, including positive feedback loops (Bhalla and Iyengar 1999). The intensity and duration of CaMKII activity may be influenced by such loops. An example is provided by a reciprocal relationship between MAPK and CaMKII: LTP is associated with a MAPK-dependent increase in CaMKII activity and expression (Giovannini et al 2001), whereas CaMKII can promote MAPK activity by inactivating a Ras-GAP (Ras-GTPase activating protein; Chen et al 1998). Progress in modeling the LTP signaling network is likely to improve our understanding of how pathway interactions determine the duration of E-LTP, which varies substantially under different stimulation conditions.

### Long-Term Maintenance of LTP

#### Two Switching Mechanisms

The duration of LTP depends on the condition of stimulation. Thus, LTP may decay within 1–3 hours (E-LTP, produced by weak stimulation) or persist for many hours in vitro (Frey et al 1993) and for months in vivo (Abraham et al 2002; L-LTP). In the latter case, LTP is said to undergo consolidation. This term is analogous to the process of memory consolidation in behaving animals. What type of mechanism could underlie consolidation, and how would it survive the constant turnover of synaptic components? In general terms, a self-sustaining feedback mechanism is required. Once such a mechanism is activated, it can persist for long periods of time. This would be the equivalent of throwing a switch. Such a switching mechanism will need to be strictly localized so that particular synapses could be selectively modified.

Numerous switching mechanisms may exist and operate at different levels: signaling, structural, transcriptional, or translational (Lisman and Fallon 1999). We will focus on two possibilities. The first, proposed by Lisman and Goldring (1988), suggests that CaMKII could provide a solution, because when a subunit in the activated CaMKII holoenzyme gets exchanged for a newly synthesized subunit, its neighbors will promptly phosphorylate it on threonine 286 and maintain the function of the holoenzyme. The mutual interaction of the subunits thus provides the mechanism for a switch. Indeed, CaMKII with alanine substituted for threonine 286 cannot support LTP (Giese et al 1998). A problem with this theory is that blockers of CaMKII, when injected into the neuron, do not inhibit long-lasting LTP (Chen et al 2001). A possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that CaMKII, when embedded in the synaptic density, is exposed to few molecules of the relevant phosphatase (PP1), so that CaMKII is insensitive to enzymatic blockers (Lisman and Zhabotinsky 2001). A more general objection to this model is the data showing that persistent LTP requires the transcription and translation of genes, and thus the pure enzymatic control proposed by Lisman may not be sufficient to explain the persistence of LTP. Additionally, the CaMKII model cannot account for either the directionality of the synaptic change or the cooperativity between synapses.

A second model assumes a translational switch. According to this model, there may exist proteins that, once translated in sufficient amounts, can further enhance their own synthesis and thus provide a translational “switch.” This will have to occur at the level of the individual synapse, or small groups of synapses,

www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych

so as to maintain synaptic specificity. A problem for this hypothesis is the finding that inhibitors of translation inhibit persistent LTP only when applied before or shortly after stimulation (Frey and Morris 1997, 1998a, 1998b; but see Calixto et al 2003). This finding was taken to mean that only transient protein synthesis is required for LTP consolidation; however, this may also mean that after an initial phase of rapid translation, the relevant proteins are made at a much lower rate, so that the application of a protein synthesis inhibitor may not last long enough to stop the translational cycle. The turnover rate of relevant proteins will have to be studied at various times after stimulation to test this possibility.

# The Role of Gene Transcription and RNA Transport

Late LTP-inducing stimulation triggers the transcription of many genes. These include immediate early genes (IEGs) such as cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and Zif268 (for review, see Bozon et al 2003), as well as structural genes such as those for CaMKII and MAP2 (Roberts et al 1998). The relevance of CREB for LTP is supported by the finding that some forms of L-LTP are inhibited in mice expressing a dominant-negative form of CREB (Pittenger et al 2002). Also, L-LTP is facilitated in mice with constitutively active CREB (Barco et al 2002). Transcription may be activated in neurons by proteins transported toward the nucleus (Martin et al 1997). A self-sustaining feedback cycle between synapses and the nucleus is thus a possibility; however, the maintenance of specific two-way pathways between individual synapses and the nucleus appears to be cumbersome. A more appealing mechanism involves the activation of transcription by back-propagated spikes (Dudek and Fields 2002). Because neuronal activity is persistent in vivo (Dobrunz and Stevens 1999), the generation of plasticity-related messenger RNAs (mRNAs) will probably be an ongoing process. Although proteins may be made in the soma and transported to the dendrites, the synthesis of the proteins involved in synaptic plasticity probably occurs in the dendrites. Local synaptic protein synthesis would then allow rapid, localized changes in synaptic strength. Supportive of this hypothesis is the finding that transport of CaMKII mRNA to the dendrites is required for L-LTP and behavioral memory (Miller et al 2002).

This mechanism requires the mRNA to be transported from the soma to the dendrites and that it be translated specifically at stimulated synapses. Messenger RNAs are packaged in granules together with ribosomes and multiple proteins. These include “zipcode binding proteins” that recognize specific 3′ terminal sequences (*cis*-acting targeting signals also known as “zipcode” sequences; Tiruchinapalli et al 2003), such as CPEB (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein; Huang et al 2003) and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (Ohashi et al 2002). The granules also contain nonspecific binding proteins such as Staufen, elongation factor 1A (Krichevsky and Kosik 2001), and possibly the molecular motors kinesin and dynein (Huang et al 2003). Granules may contain multiple mRNAs that have similar “zipcodes” (Huang et al 2003). It thus is likely that multiple types of granules are sorted according to the “zipcodes” of their mRNAs. The granules are attached to microtubules via the motor proteins (kinesins, dyneins, and myosin) and transported up the dendrites at rates of 4–8 μm/min (Huang et al 2003). When neurons are depolarized, the granules unravel (Krichevsky and Kosik 2001), releasing mRNA, some of which appears to be attached to ribosomes. It has been suggested that this occurs near the activated synapses (Kosik and Krichevsky 2002). The granules may also be transported into dendrites and synaptic spines (Tiruchinapalli et al 2003). In addition, polyribosomes are trans-

ported from the dendrites into synaptic spines by LTP-inducing stimulation. This is accompanied by an increase in the size of the spine, which is attributed to protein synthesis and is correlated with enhanced synaptic transmission (Ostroff et al 2002). An interesting question is whether different patterns of stimulation will release mRNA from specific granule types. If this were the case, different species of mRNA could be made available to synapses, depending on the pattern of stimulation. This could provide a mechanism to explain the difference between L-LTP and a form of LTD that requires neuronal protein synthesis (Huber et al 2001). Little is known about the mechanisms that lead to the capture of RNA-containing granules and the release of mRNA from them; however, because release of mRNA from granules is stimulation dependent, it is reasonable to assume that it will occur specifically at stimulated synapses.

## The Phenomenon of Synaptic Tagging

A clue for how mRNA release is regulated in the dendrites comes from the phenomenon of synaptic tagging. In hippocampus, when synapses are weakly stimulated, they nonetheless develop L-LTP if neighboring synapses are strongly stimulated within a brief interval. The strong stimulus needs to be able to induce protein synthesis, which may occur in the cell body or in the dendrites. The weakly stimulated synapses thus generate an identifying tag, which then allows them to capture proteins made in response to the strong stimulation of their neighbors (Barco et al 2002; Frey and Morris 1997, 1998a, 1998b). In *Aplysia*, two tagging processes have been described. One is protein synthesis independent (for long-term synaptic enhancement lasting 24 hours) and the other is protein synthesis dependent (for long-term synaptic enhancement lasting 72 hours; Casadio et al 1999). In hippocampus, tagging is independent of protein synthesis. The process of tagging is not understood, however.

Here we propose that synaptic tagging is related to the release of mRNA from granules at specific dendritic sites. The capture and mobilization of mRNA by stimulated synapses would logically precede synaptic protein synthesis because the mRNA in granules cannot be translated (Krichevsky and Kosik 2001), which fits with the observation that tagging in hippocampus does not require protein synthesis. This idea is also made plausible by the finding that mRNA can be localized to stimulated synapses (Steward and Worley 2001). Various candidates for molecules involved in tagging have been suggested, including protein kinases (CaMKII, PKA, and protein kinase C ζ [PKMζ]), adhesion molecules, and polymerized actin (Martin and Kosik 2002), any of which may trigger the release of mRNA from granules.

## Protein Synthesis at Synapses

Synaptic protein synthesis could provide the molecules necessary for increased synaptic transmission. These could be the same as the ones involved in the induction of LTP. Thus synthesis of CaMKII, glutamate receptors, and scaffold proteins may help sustain the synaptic enhancement seen during early LTP. In addition, proteins involved in protein synthesis and degradation could be made.

Synapses possess many components required for protein synthesis. Thus, ribosomes and membranes analogous to rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi and *trans*Golgi network are localized in dendrites and dendritic spines (Pierce et al 2000, 2001). Also, many species of mRNA have been identified in dendrites (Burgin et al 1990; Miyashiro et al 1994; for a review, see Job and Eberwine 2001b). Numerous components of the protein translational machinery have been similarly localized.

R.D. Blitzer et al

These include initiation factors, elongation factors, and enzymes known to regulate translation such as eIF-4E, 4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, eEF1A, CPEB, maskin, poly(A) polymerase, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and p70S6 kinase (Huang et al 2002; Krichevsky and Kosik 2001; Tang et al 2002). Translation of proteins in stimulated dendrites has been demonstrated by showing synthesis-dependent increases in dendritic proteins. In those experiments, the translational machinery was activated by synaptic stimulation of NMDA receptors (Giovannini et al 2001; Ouyang et al 1997, 1999), by the application of a metabotropic glutamate receptors agonist (Job and Eberwine 2001b), or of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Aakalu et al 2001). Of interest is the finding that protein synthesis in stimulated dendrites (but not in cell bodies) increases in an exponential manner with time (Job and Eberwine 2001a), which may hint at a translational positive feedback loop. Stimulation of cultured neurons with BDNF activates a number of transcription initiation factors (eIF-2b, eIF-4E, 4E-BP1) and related enzymes (mTOR, Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPK signal-integrating kinase (MnK1); Takei et al 2001).

Recently, we have shown the activation of the translation-regulating enzyme p70S6 kinase in dendrites of neurons exhibiting L-LTP (Tsokas et al, unpublished data). This enzyme is of particular interest because in many cells it controls the translation of a class of messages that possess a 5′ terminal polypyrimidine tract (TOP; Jefferies et al 1997). Such mRNAs often code for components of the translational machinery. Indeed, we have found evidence for a rapid (within 5 min) increase in the amount of the elongation factor eEF1A in dendrites of neurons stimulated to produce L-LTP. This may indicate that eEF1A is translated in the dendrites. Such translation might initiate a self-sustaining process because eEF1A may accelerate the rate of peptide elongation during translation, thus leading to further increases in eEF1A itself. This enhancement of translation may occur through the primary elongation function of eEF1A. In addition, eEF1A anchors mRNA transcripts to actin and bundles actin filaments (Liu et al 2002), which may also have an effect on translation. We have not yet studied the synthesis of other translation factors, but these also could be involved. The positive feedback effect of the synthesis of the translation factors may explain the exponential rate of focal protein synthesis in dendrites (Job and Eberwine 2001a) and could also explain the cooperativity between weakly and strongly stimulated synapses, if the latter could export newly synthesized translation factors to the former.

Other molecules may also support a translational feedback mechanism. One such protein, PKMζ, which is translated during L-LTP, is required for LTP maintenance (Ling et al 2002) and may, in turn, regulate protein synthesis (Romanelli et al 1999). Another candidate, is BDNF, which probably is translated in dendrites (Job and Eberwine 2001b), is released from dendrites upon stimulation (Hartmann et al 2001), and enhances dendritic protein synthesis (Aakalu et al 2001; Kang and Schuman 1996).

### A Model for Memory Consolidation at Synapses

A model that incorporates the local synaptic liberation of mRNA from granules and a translational switch is summarized in Figure 3. Here, the newly competent mRNA, which may be preloaded in polysomes, codes for a rate-limiting component of the translational machinery. The stimulation-dependent translation of this mRNA will provide an increase in translational capacity, which would then feed back into local protein synthesis and as well could be exported to nearby synapses. It is postulated that strong synaptic stimulation unravels nearby RNA granules and also causes a local boost in translation, whereas weaker stimulation only unravels granules. In this manner,

www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych

weakly stimulated synapses are tagged, or primed, because the mRNA has been made available, but protein synthesis awaits the advent of translation-related proteins. At such synapses, the relevant proteins can be synthesized upon the arrival of translational capacity from a nearby, strongly stimulated dendritic region, as long as the liberated transcripts remain available.

This paper summarizes the posttranslational and translation-dependent changes that are involved in long-term changes in synaptic strength. Even though the posttranslational mechanisms are important, we believe that the core mechanism for long-term change in synaptic strength depends on local synaptic protein translation. Long-term synaptic change requires two steps: 1) tagging (also called priming or marking), requiring only a weak stimulus, and 2) consolidation, which necessitates stronger stimulation. We propose that a weak stimulus can capture mRNA-containing granules at the synapse and cause the release of mRNA from the granules, making it available for translation. This would be the basis for the tagging process. Different patterns of synaptic stimulation could affect different classes of granules, leading to release of various species of mRNA. A strong stimulus, in addition, activates the translation of mRNA, leading to the expression of proteins necessary for modifying synaptic potency. Depending on the mRNA that has been made available, either strengthening or weakening of synapses could result. If some of the translated proteins were themselves involved in translation, a positive feedback mechanism could be set up that would maintain the newly set synaptic strength. The export of translational proteins to neighboring synapses could explain the cooperativity between strong and weak stimulation seen in hippocampus.

The elucidation of protein translation at synapses and its role in the persistent modification of synaptic function is a promising avenue for further exploration.
