**Abstract:** Many transcription factors are critical for ensuring proper embryonic development of the endocrine pancreas and normal islet function. The transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) is uniformly expressed in early pancreatic buds of embryos as well as the β and δ cells of the islets of Langerhans. PDX-1 has also been found in dispersed endocrine cells of the duodenum in adults and plays a key role in pancreas formation. It has been reported that null mutation of PDX-1 in mice results in a failure of the pancreatic bud to expand; thus, the mice die 2–3 days after birth from hyperglycemia and dehydration. Heterozygous PDX-1<sup>+/−</sup> mice developed a pancreas but were diabetic. It has been shown that PDX-1 is required for maintaining the pancreatic islet functions by activating gene transcriptions including insulin, somatostatin (SST), islet amyloid polypeptide, glucose transporter type 2, and glucokinase. PDX-1 serves a dual role in pancreatic development. It initially contributes to pancreatic formation during embryogenesis and subsequently regulates the pancreatic islet cell physiology in mature islet cells. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of pancreas formation, especially the function of PDX-1, may contribute to the enhanced treatment and prevention of debilitating diseases such as diabetes, insulinomas, and pancreatic carcinomas.

The pancreas derives from the foregut of the endoderm and is composed of exocrine, endocrine, and ductal cells. The exocrine cells comprise about 90% of the pancreatic gland and produce digestive enzymes such as proteases, amylases, lipases, and nucleases that are secreted into the duodenum through ductal cells. Secretion of these exocrine enzymes is regulated by hormonal stimulation, mainly by secretin, cholecystokinin, and gastrin, as well as neural stimuli. The endocrine islet cells consist in 4 different cell types: α, β, δ, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells, which produce glucagon, insulin, somatostatin (SST), and PP, respectively. These endocrine cells form a core of β cells surrounded by α, δ, and PP

cells. At present, little is known about the formation, development, and differentiation of the pancreas; however, a number of genes encoded for different key transcription factors that play important roles during development and differentiation of the pancreas have been identified. In addition, it has been reported that not only the signals between endoderm and mesoderm but also the cell-cell contact within islets influence pancreas formation.<sup>1–3</sup>

Mammalian homolog of Xenopus laevis Xlhomebox 8, PDX-1 (also known as insulin promoter factor 1, islet/duodenum homeobox 1, SST transactivating factor 1, insulin upstream factor 1, and glucose-sensitive factor) are transcription factors critical for embryonic development of the pancreas and normal islet function.<sup>4–10</sup> The crucial role of PDX-1 in pancreatic development was demonstrated in 2 transgenic mouse models. In the first model, Jonsson et al<sup>11</sup> reported that mice homozygous for PDX-1 deletion that selectively lacked a pancreas at birth. In a β cell-specific knockout of the PDX-1 gene, mice developed an adult-onset, noninsulin-resistant type of diabetes.<sup>12</sup> These models suggest that mutations in the PDX-1 gene may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes in humans. In humans, a heterozygote of such mutation has been linked to a high frequency of early-onset type 2 diabetes development, designated as maturity-onset diabetes of the young 4 (MODY-4).<sup>13</sup> In addition, a heterozygote of a frame-shift mutation within the PDX-1 gene coding region, which resulted in a truncated, nonfunctional protein, has been identified in children born with pancreatic agenesis.<sup>14</sup>

The purpose of this review is to elucidate the role of PDX-1 in pancreatic development and physiology.

### STRUCTURAL FEATURES AND REGULATION OF PDX-1

The human PDX-1 gene is located on chromosome 13q12.1 and consists of 2 exons spanning a region of about 6 kb.<sup>15,16</sup> The mouse PDX-1 gene has been mapped to the distal end of chromosome 5, and the rat PDX-1 gene is located on chromosome 12.<sup>17,18</sup> As shown in Figure 1A, the human PDX-1 protein consists of 283 amino acids and its molecular weight is estimated at 31 kd. The PDX-1 protein sequence has a high degree of amino acid sequence homology among different species, eg, 90% with hamster, 88% with rat, 87% with mouse, and 68% with Xenopus. Even in zebrafish, the PDX-1

sequence shares a 95% identity to mammalian PDX-1 in the homeodomain.¹⁹ Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that PDX-1 possesses within the N-terminal region a transactivation domain that contains 3 evolutionarily conserved subdomains spanning amino acids 13–22 (subdomain A), 32–38 (subdomain B), and 60–73 (subdomain C).²⁰ In the middle region, PDX-1 contains an antennapedia-like homeodomain consisting of 3 helices, flanked on both sides by proline-rich sequences. The homeodomain of the PDX-1 protein plays a critical role in DNA binding and protein-to-protein interactions as a transcriptional activation mechanism. Furthermore, it contains a nuclear localization signal within the helix 3 region consisting of 7 amino acids (RRMKWKK) that is conserved in mice, rats, and humans.²¹,²² Although it has been reported that phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of PDX-1 is caused by high levels of glucose and insulin to regulate the insulin gene transcription, it remains to be determined whether a nuclear export event is involved in the movement of PDX-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.²³⁻²⁵ Interestingly, the antenna-type hexapeptide (PFPWMK) present in the proline-rich region, prior to the homeodomain, mediates the heterodimerization with the DNA-binding protein termed PBX1 on a regulatory element of the SST promoter.²⁶,²⁷

During organogenesis, PDX-1 is widely expressed in all cells differentiating toward the exocrine and endocrine components of the pancreas. In the adult pancreas, PDX-1 expression is predominantly restricted to the insulin-producing islet β cells and a subset of SST-producing δ cells but is almost undetectable in other pancreatic cell types.²⁸,²⁹ Although little was known about the mechanisms and the factors that control PDX-1 expression and activity during embryogenesis and in mature islet cells, recent studies using transgenic mice, DNase I footprinting analyses, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) have revealed these regulations in great detail.

The 6.5-kb genomic fragment of 5′ flanking sequence from the PDX-1 gene has demonstrated pancreatic islet-specific activities in transgenic mice. As shown in Figure 1B, in the –190 to –95 region of the PDX-1 promoter, there are 3 consensus E-box motifs. Although removal of 2 of the tandem E boxes at –177 did not reduce promoter activity, deletion of the proximal E-box sequence at –104 completely abolished PDX-1 expression in HIT-T15 cells. This E-box DNA binding site is recognized primarily by the helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper nuclear factor USF-1.¹⁶ Moreover, a 530-bp fragment extending from –6200 to –5670 of the PDX-1 5′ flanking region has emerged as being extremely important for islet cell-specific activity. It contains a consensus E-box motif that is

identical to E-box elements within the insulin promoter. A previous study demonstrated that the islet-specific factor β-cell E-box transactivator-2 (BETA2, also known as NeuroD), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, activates insulin promoter activity by binding to these insulin-promoter elements as a heterodimer with the ubiquitous factor E47.³⁰ The study also revealed that the BETA2-E47 heterodimer does indeed recognize this element and upregulates the PDX-1 expression in β cells. Naya et al³¹ reported that BETA2 null mice had a striking reduction in the number of β cells and failed to develop mature islets. Furthermore, an endodermal transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β), a member of the forkhead and winged-helix family of transcription factors, binds to these fragments and activates expression of PDX-1 in a cooperative manner with BETA2/E47. It was previously reported that glucocorticoids repress islet cell maturation in vitro.³²⁻³⁵ Sharma et al³⁰ revealed that dexamethasone-treated HIT-T15 cells had a 10-fold reduction in levels of PDX-1 mRNA. Further studies demonstrated that glucocorticoids block HNF3β activity, resulting in the repression of PDX-1 expression and, ultimately, in the maturation of the pancreas. Wu et al³⁴ and Marshak et al³⁶ reported that in both mice and humans, there are several highly conserved sequences –2.5 kb upstream of 5′ flanking region of the PDX-1 gene. HNF1α, HNF3β, and PDX-1 are able to bind to this region and activate the PDX-1 expression cooperatively. Furthermore, Ben-Shushan et al³⁷ and others³⁸,³⁹ reported that near the 3.5-kb region of 5′ flanking region in the human PDX-1 gene, there are SP1 and HNF1α/HNF3β binding sequences where these transcription factors upregulate the PDX-1 expression. Indeed, PDX-1 expression levels were reduced in islet of HNF1α⁻/⁻ mice, and similar reductions of PDX-1 expression were found in HNF3β⁻/⁻ cell lines.³⁸,⁴⁰,⁴¹ Furthermore, several reports suggest that HNF4 and HNF6 may also be indirectly involved in the regulation of PDX-1 expression.⁴²,⁴³

### PDX-1 REGULATES PANCREAS DEVELOPMENT

#### Pancreatic Morphogenesis

The initial stage of pancreatic development occurs early during embryogenesis; however, transcription factors governing this process are largely unknown.⁴⁴ This developmental process depends on a network of specific transcription factors and signaling molecules that are subject to a specific location and time as well as duration aspects. Of these factors, PDX-1 plays a key role in the development of the pancreas. Neonatal mice, carrying a null mutation of this gene, lack a pancreas. In humans, homozygous deletion of the PDX-1 gene causes pancreas agenesis.¹⁴ Although the initiation of bud formation appears normal in homozygous mutant mice, the expansion of the buds was disabled, indicating the requirement of PDX-1 in the following process.

During embryogenesis, the pancreas arises from the foregut of the endoderm in the area that will become the duodenum. In the mouse, at embryonic day 9.5 (e9.5), the dorsal bud appears first with the ventral bud arising from this area shortly thereafter (within 1 day). PDX-1 is first detected at e8.5 in the dorsal region of the gut, and at e9.5, its expression is localized to the dorsal and ventral buds concomitantly with the first glucagon-secreting α cells. At e10.5, insulin-producing β cells appear, followed by (approximately e15.5) SST-secreting δ cells, and, at birth, pancreatic PP-secreting PP cells appear.⁴⁴ As the stomach and duodenum rotate, the ventral bud and hepatopancreatic orifice move around until they fuse with the dorsal bud to form the organ by e17. In adult pancreata, PDX-1 expression is restricted only to β and δ cells in the pancreas.⁴⁶

During pancreatic development, other signals from the adjacent germ layers are also required. For example, mesodermal fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) function as important regulatory signaling molecules during development. These proteins are involved in patterning, proliferation, and cell differentiation in many organs derived from the endoderm, including the pancreas.⁴⁷ Sonic hedgehog (SHH), a potent intercellular signaling protein and repressor of islet formation and acinar branching, is strikingly absent from the pancreatic endoderm, in contrast to high-level expression in the adjacent stomach and duodenum endoderm. Hebrok et al⁴⁸ have revealed that FGF2 and activin-β, a member of the transforming growth factor β family, are secreted from the adjacent notochord and repress endodermal SHH expression in the dorsal region of the foregut destined to form the pancreas. This permits the induction of PDX-1 and in turn the Lim domain homeobox gene (Isl-1) and leads to the evagination of the pancreatic buds. Furthermore, other factors such as the FGF4 protein have also been implicated in early endoderm specification. Results have showed that FGF4 is capable of inducing the expression of specific pancreatic genes such as BETA2 and SST in vitro.⁴⁹

Hb9 (encoded by Hlxb9), a homeodomain protein, is expressed in 2 distinct developmental phases: first during the evagination of the pancreatic buds and later in differentiation of β cells. It has an essential function in the initial stages of pancreatic development. In mice homologous of null mutation of Hlxb9, the dorsal lobe of the pancreas fails to develop and lacks PDX-1 expression. Even though the ventral bud develops, it has small islets of Langerhans with reduced numbers of β cells.⁵⁰,⁵¹

Recently, Liu et al⁵² suggested that PBX1, a member of the TALE (3 amino acid loop extension) class of homeodomain transcription factor, is essential for normal development and function of the pancreas. PBX1⁻/⁻ embryos had pancreatic hypoplasia and marked defects in exocrine and endocrine cell differentiation prior to death at e15. In these embryos, expression of Isl-1 was severely reduced. PBX1⁺/⁻ adults had islet malformations, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypoinsulinemia.⁵³ It was previously reported that PBX1 and PDX-1 form a complex and regulate the SST gene transcription coop-

eratively.²⁶ It is possible that through its interactions with PDX-1, PBX1 may play an important role in the early developmental stage of the pancreas.⁵⁴

### Formation of the Endocrine and Exocrine Tissues

The pancreas possesses both an exocrine function involved in the delivery of digestive enzymes into the duodenum and an endocrine function by which several hormones are secreted into the bloodstream. In the past few years, a growing number of transcription factors have been shown to be necessary for proper cell differentiation of the pancreas. There is a period during pancreatic development when PDX-1 is found in the ductal cells. It also appears in endocrine cells along with islet hormone secretion and in acinar cells with the exocrine enzymes. PDX-1 is required for the formation of both endocrine and exocrine tissues (Fig. 2). Therefore, it is thought that both exocrine and endocrine cells differentiate from a common pluripotent progenitor derived from the putative ductal stem cells. However, little is known about the source of these putative ductal stem cells or their regulation.

Collectively, these data indicate that 2 waves of PDX-1 expression occur during pancreatic development. The transcription factors, as well as several other factors such as growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix, and further cell-to-cell contact interactions within the islet, are all important to the formation of the pancreas.

#### Differentiation of Endocrine Cells

As mentioned previously, pancreas differentiation begins in epithelial cells expressing HNFs, Hb9, and PDX-1. After this initial period of early pancreas development, Isl-1 and BETA2 induce the epithelial cells to differentiate into the endocrine precursor cells (Fig. 2). Isl-1, a member of LIM homeodomain family, has been demonstrated to be required for the differentiation of all islet cells.⁵⁵ No endocrine cells were present in Isl-1 gene-ablated mice. However, the expression of Isl-1 is also important for development of exocrine tissue of the dorsal pancreatic bud. Null mutation of Isl-1 induces the failure of exocrine cell differentiation in the dorsal pancreatic bud, indicating that signals triggering morphogenesis of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds differ. HNF6 induces not only

FIGURE 2. Pancreatic cell lineage model. Transcription factors involved in the pancreas development and specific cell differentiation are shown in boxes.

HNF3β, which transactivates the PDX-1 expression, but also neurogenin 3 (Ngn3).⁴² Ngn3 belongs to the bHLH family of transcription factors and is implicated in the development of all endocrine cells as well. Mice with the null mutation of Ngn3 show no endocrine cells, and, therefore, Ngn3-positive cells are the candidates for islet cell precursors.⁵⁶,⁵⁷ The expression of Ngn3 starts at e9 in the pancreatic anlage and increases to a peak at e15.5. Ngn3 induces the expressions of BETA2 and Hes1 (hairy and enhancer of split), and thereafter it is down-regulated at around e18 prior to final differentiation.⁵⁸⁻⁶⁰

BETA2 is also required for the differentiation of endocrine cells. Homozygous mice with the null mutation of the BETA2 gene show a marked reduction of endocrine cells and die 3–6 days after birth because of hyperglycemia.³¹ On the other hand, the other bHLH family member, Hes1, is an inhibitor of the endocrine cell differentiation by repressing Ngn3-mediated expression of BETA2. The expression of Hes1 was not detected in α cells, and its mutant mice showed pancreatic hypoplasia with more glucagon-expressing cells.⁶¹ These data suggest that Hes1 plays a role in the maintenance of the pancreatic precursor pool during development and that pancreatic hypoplasia is due to premature endocrine cell differentiation with a depletion of pancreatic precursor cells.

During a later stage of pancreatic development, Pax6 and Nkx2.2 increase their expression in endocrine precursor cells. Pax6, a paired homeodomain protein, is essential for all endocrine cell differentiation. Its mutant mice showed no or few α cells and a significant reduction of other islet cells. This protein is also required for the final differentiation of glucagon-secreting α cells.⁶²,⁶³

Nkx2.2 belongs to the NK class of homeodomain proteins and its expression is detected in all endocrine precursor cells at e9.5. However, the expression of Nkx2.2 becomes gradually restricted to the α, β, and PP cells of the mature islet and is not expressed in mature δ cells. Studies conducted in mice with null mutation of this gene showed that this protein is required for not only the differentiation of β cells but also for α and PP cells. These mice showed accumulation of incomplete differentiation of β cells and died because of hyperglycemia. Furthermore, these mice also had a marked decrease of α and PP cells.⁶⁴ Nkx2.2 also mediates the expression of Nkx6.1, a member of NK class homeodomain protein.⁶⁴⁻⁶⁶ In a mature pancreas, Nkx6.1 is present only in β cells, with its disruption resulting in a profound decrease of β cells, not α, δ, or PP cells.

After the generation of mature α cells induced by Pax6 and Nkx2.2, the expression of other transcription factors, Pax4 and PDX-1, increased dramatically. Pax4, a member of paired homeodomain proteins, is needed for the differentiation of β and δ cells. Its inactivation leads to the absence of these cells and an increase in α cells.⁶⁷ The second wave of the PDX-1 expression also leads to the differentiation of β and δ cells. In these cells, PDX-1 mediates the expressions of cell-specific genes and maintains the function of islets, as mentioned below.


# Differentiation of Exocrine Acinar Cells

The exocrine of the pancreas is composed of acinar cells that produce various digestive enzymes and ductal cells that transport these enzymes to the duodenum. There are more than 20 different enzymes produced by acinar cells, including proteases, amylases, lipases, and nucleases. Most of these enzymes are secreted as inactive precursors and become activated after they enter the duodenum.

Signals from the pancreatic mesenchyme are important in stimulating exocrine development and determining the exocrine-endocrine tissue ratio in the pancreas. The removal of a large portion of the mesenchyme in pancreatic organ culture in vitro abolishes the development of exocrine cells and promotes exclusive differentiation of the epithelium into endocrine tissue.⁶⁸ Inhibitory factors, such as follistatin, are important for cellular differentiation. This protein is expressed in the pancreatic mesenchyme during embryogenesis and participates in the induction of exocrine development.⁶⁹

p48 is the acinar cell-specific component of the PTF-1 complex that binds many, if not all, of the promoters of the genes that encode the pancreatic digestive. p48 protein is required for the formation of pancreatic acinar and ductal cells; neonatal mice with both *ptf-1-p48* allele mutations lack all exocrine tissues, although islet-like endocrine cell clusters still form.⁷⁰ PDX-1 is present at lower levels in mature acinar cells and Rose et al⁷¹ revealed that PDX-1 and PTF-1–p48 bind and participate in the activation cooperatively of the elastase I gene in acinar cells.


# PDX-1 and Gene Regulation in Islet Cells

The islet of Langerhans is the functional unit of the endocrine pancreas. The insulin-producing β cells represent the majority of the endocrine cell population (60%–80%) and form the core of the islet, whereas α, δ, and PP cells secrete glucagon, SST, and PP, respectively, and are found at the periphery of the islets. Approximately 90% of β cells and 15% of δ cells express PDX-1. In β cells, PDX-1 regulates a number of genes involved in maintaining β-cell identity and function, which include insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, amylin), glucokinase (GK), and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). Indeed, Ahlgren et al¹² reported that β cell-specific inactivation of the mouse PDX-1 gene using the Cre-lox system results in loss of the β-cell phenotype, reduced insulin, and GLUT2 expression and leads to diabetes in these mice. The PDX-1 protein also regulates SST gene expression in δ cells. Both PDX-1 expression and cell-cell communication are required for δ-cell differentiation and SST secretion.² The ability of PDX-1 to activate gene transcription in a tissue-specific manner is dependent on its capacity to interact with other transcription factors.


# Insulin

Glucose homeostasis requires tight regulation of insulin synthesis and secretion. Several factors, such as transcription

factors, nutrients, and hormonal stimuli, are shown to regulate insulin levels cooperatively. Moreover, the electrical activities such as those of Ca²⁺ channels, K-ATP channels, and other intracellular signal transduction systems are important for the secretion of insulin.⁷²,⁷³

Most animals have a single copy of the insulin gene, with the exception of rats and mice, which carry 2 nonallelic insulin genes. The human insulin gene is located on chromosome 11p15.5 and contains 3 exons and 2 introns.⁷⁴ The final spliced mRNA transcript is 446 bp in length and codes for the prepro-insulin peptide. The insulin gene and its promoter sequences are well conserved throughout evolution. Activation of insulin gene transcription, specifically in the pancreatic β cells, depends on multiple nuclear factors that interact with each other and with sequences on the insulin gene promoter to build a transcriptional activation complex.⁷³ The schematic structures of human and rat insulin promoters are shown in Figure 3. There are several cis-acting elements located in the proximal promoter region of the insulin gene. Several transcription factors have been shown to bind to these cis-acting elements and regulate insulin gene transcription synergistically. The β cell-specific expression of insulin is mediated predominantly by A, E, and RIPE3b elements in the promoter region. In the human insulin promoter (Fig. 3A), there are 5 A elements (A1–5) and 2 E boxes (E1, E2). A1–4 as well as E1 and E2 elements are arranged in close proximity to each other. Except for the A2 element (GGAAAT), all A boxes share the core sequence TAAT, a motif for homeodomain protein recognition.⁷⁵ Mutation of the A3/A4 site in the rat insulin I promoter or corresponding A3 site in the human insulin promoter leads to a 75% loss of promoter activity, whereas mutation of the A1 site only modestly affects insulin transcription.⁷⁶⁻⁷⁸ Several homeodomain proteins have been reported to bind A boxes; among them, β cell-specific PDX-1 binds these A boxes and activates insulin transcription. In the rat insulin I gene (Fig. 3B), the juxtaposed A3 and A4 boxes bind additional homeodomain-containing proteins, such as Isl-1, Cdx-3, Lmx1.1, HNF1α, and HMGIY.⁷⁹⁻⁸²

E1 and E2 elements are also crucial for insulin transcriptional activation. Mutation of either of the 2 elements results in a 90% loss of the promoter activity when transfected into a hamster insulinoma cell line.⁷⁶ Mutation of both elements effectively abolishes its transcriptional activity. E-box binding factors belong to the bHLH family of transcription factors. E12 and E47 are differential RNA splicing products of the same

![Figure 3](#fig3)

FIGURE 3. Insulin gene promoters. Potential transcription factor binding sites are indicated by boxes. A: Human insulin promoter. B: Rat insulin promoter I. C: Rat insulin promoter II.

gene, E2A. HEB and E12/E47 are ubiquitously expressed in the endocrine β cells; therefore, their binding to the E boxes does not explain the tissue-specific expression of insulin. 83 However, Naya et al 84 have shown that another family member, BETA2/NeuroD, also binds to E boxes. BETA2 expression is, apart from the brain, limited to pancreatic islet cells.

A-box and E-box binding proteins interact with each other and synergistically regulate insulin gene transcription. Such protein-protein interactions involve several proteins such as PDX-1, E47, BETA2, and high-mobility group protein (HMGY). HMGY is an architectural protein that affects the conformation of DNA and is important in the assembly of nuclear pore complexes. Ohneda et al 82 have demonstrated that the homeodomain region of the PDX-1 protein acts as a protein-protein interaction domain to recruit multiple proteins. Moreover, Qiu et al 85 reported that p300 coactivator interacts directly with the N-terminal region of the PDX-1 protein and forms the complex containing PDX-1, BETA2, E47, and p300, which in turn activates rat I insulin gene transcription synergistically. Islet-specific LIM homeodomain protein Lmx1.1 binds A3/A4 boxes and can also activate A/E minienhancer in cooperation with E47.

Somatostatin

SST, a multifunctional peptide, is produced in many cells throughout the body, most notably those of the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas (δ cells). There are 2 endogenous bioactive forms of SST, SST-14 and SST-28, that act on a diverse array of endocrine, exocrine, neuronal, and immune cell targets to inhibit secretion, modulate neurotransmission, and regulate cell division. 86,87 The action of this peptide is mediated by a family of 7-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors termed SSTR1–5. 88 SSTRs are widely expressed in the CNS and periphery in a tissue- and subtype-specific manner. 86 In the pancreas, all 5 SSTR subtypes are variably expressed on islet cells. Kumar et al, 89 by using immunohistochemical analysis, revealed that in humans, SSTR1 is strongly colocalized with insulin in 100% of β cells. SSTR5 is also an abundant isotype, being colocalized in 87% of β cells. SSTR2 was found only in 46% of β cells. SSTR2 was strongly colocalized with glucagon in 89% of α cells, whereas SSTR5 and SSTR1 colocalized with glucagon in 35% and 26% of α cells, respectively. SSTR3 and SSTR4 were relatively poorly expressed. SSTR3 was also detected occasionally in α cells, and SSTR4 is absent in α cells. SSTR5 is also preferentially expressed in 75% of SST-positive cells and is the predominant SSTR subtype of δ cells, whereas SSTR1–3 are colocalized in only a few δ cells, and SSTR4 is absent. SST acts on β, α, and PP cells to inhibit both the synthesis and secretion of insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic PP. SST also inhibits SST secretion from δ cells through an autoregulatory feedback mechanism. 87

PDX-1 was originally isolated and characterized based on its ability to bind and activate the SST promoter. 6,7 It is detected in 15% of the δ cells, and the promoter region of SST contains 4 PDX-1 binding sites with a common TAAT core motif (Fig. 4). Activity of the SST promoter relies on a composite enhancer element termed the SST upstream enhancer (SMS-UE) and 2 A/T rich elements termed TAAT1 and TAAT2 (Fig. 4). The SMS-UE, spanning nucleotides –115 to –75, is a tripartite element consisting of the subdomains SMS-UE-A, -B, and -C. On the UE-A element, PDX-1, PBX1, and Prep1 are found to form complexes and induce a drastic activation. 26,27 On the UE-B and UE-C elements, PDX-1 and Pax6 are also found to form complexes and transactivate the SST gene. 90 Even though a point mutation in the UE-A element abolishes both PDX-1 and PBX1 binding activity, the promoter activity remains unchanged. However, a block mutation that reduces pax6 binding to the SMS-UE inhibits promoter activity. In contrast, a point mutation that selectively eliminates PDX-1 binding to a proximal B element reduces the promoter activity significantly. The activity of these elements of the SST promoter depends on the integrity of a cyclic AMP response element (CRE). In addition to PDX-1, PBX1, and Pax6,

**Glucokinase**

The highest expression levels of GK are found in pancreatic β cells and liver hepatocytes. It is a crucial factor in the transferring of phosphate from ATP to glucose to generate glucose-6-phosphate, the first rate-limiting step in the glucose metabolism. GK functions as the glucose sensor in the β cell by controlling the rate of entry of glucose into the glycolytic pathway and its subsequent metabolism. In the liver, glucokinase affects the ability to store glucose as glycogen, particularly in the postprandial state. Heterozygous mutation leading to partial deficiency of this enzyme is associated with MODY2. Furthermore, Njolstad et al reported that some cases of neonatal diabetes mellitus are due to homozygous mutation of this gene resulting in complete GK deficiency. Mutation of this gene should be sought in infants with neonatal diabetes, especially if some first-degree relatives have glucose intolerance. A combination of reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells and reduced glycogen storage in the liver leads to an increase in plasma glucose levels. The promoter region of the human GK gene comprises multiple cis-acting elements, including 2 very important cis motifs: the palindrome structure hPal-1 and the insulin gene cis motif A element-like hUPE3. Like BETA2, PDX-1 has been shown to be able to bind with the hUPE3 motif and hence activate the transcription of GK.

**PDX-1 AND PANCREATIC DISORDERS**

**Diabetes Mellitus**

Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia, which, if not treated properly, leads to several disorders such as blindness, dysfunction of the kidneys and peripheral nervous system, loss of limbs, and reduced life expectancy. More than 150 million people are affected by diabetes worldwide, with this figure likely to double by the year 2025. Type 1, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), results from autoimmune destruction of the β cells and accounts for 5%–10% of all cases of diabetes, with the major susceptibility gene mapping to the HLA region of chromosome 6. Type 2, or NIDDM, is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 90% of cases and affecting 10%–20% of those older than 45 years of age in many developed countries. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by varying degrees of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction, which together lead to hyperglycemia. Several molecular events are suggested to be involved in diabetes, including single-gene disorders that affect the ability of the β cell to secrete insulin, or the ability of muscle, fat, and liver cells to respond to insulin's actions. MODY is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and defects in insulin secretion, causing an early onset of NIDDM, usually before 25 years of age and frequently in childhood or adolescence. MODY

**Islet Amyloid Polypeptide**

IAPP, also known as amylin, is a 37-amino-acid peptide and is a member of the calcitonin family. In pancreatic β cells, IAPP is costored with insulin in the secretory granules and coreleased with insulin in response to a secretagogue. IAPP is also expressed in a subset of islet δ cells. IAPP is a characteristic pathologic finding in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, being present in >90% of β cells. Although the first description of amyloid deposits in the islets of the pancreas of a diabetic subject was made more than 100 years ago, the physiological role that IAPP plays in normal or disease states, such as noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), is unclear. As a consequence of its ability to inhibit insulin secretion in isolated islets and to counteract insulin action in peripheral tissues, IAPP has been proposed to play an important role in regulating plasma glucose levels in mammals. The IAPP gene contains 3 A box-like sequences, AT1–3, in the regulatory region of the IAPP gene promoter, which is similar to those found in the insulin promoter. In the study by Watada et al., all 3 sequences were shown to be capable of binding PDX-1, and the disruption of either AT1 or AT3, but not AT2, caused a marked reduction in the IAPP gene promoter activity. These observations suggest the involvement of PDX-1 in human IAPP gene regulation, which seems to be mediated through at least 2 A element-like cis motifs in the gene promoter region.

**Glucose Transporter 2**

GLUT2 is a membrane protein that facilitates glucose diffusion through the plasma membranes of mammalian cells. The GLUT2 gene is expressed in the liver, small intestine, kidney, some restricted areas of the brain, and the pancreatic β cells. During pancreas ontogeny, GLUT2 appears in the endoderm before pancreatic bud formation and before the appearance of the insulin-secreting β cells. In animals with diabetes, the impaired insulin secretory response is correlated with a reduced expression of GLUT2 in β cells. However, no decrease in GLUT2 abundance has been reported in the liver or kidney of diabetic animals, which suggests that expression of the GLUT2 gene is under the control of different factors in pancreatic β cells compared with other GLUT2-expressing tissues. Waeber et al identified a repeat of a TAAT motif (5′-TAATAATAACA-3′) conserved in the sequence of the human and murine GLUT2 promoters and demonstrated that PDX-1 binds this motif and transactivates GLUT2 expression. Furthermore, Bonny et al showed that another islet-specific DNA-binding protein, GTIIα, also transactivates the GLUT2 gene.

can result from mutations in any one of the following 6 genes: hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (MODY1), HNF1α (MODY3), PDX-1 (MODY4), HNF1β (MODY5), and BETA2 (MODY6). MODY2 encodes the glycolytic enzyme GK, while the other 5 encode transcription factors. All these genes are expressed in β cells, and mutation of any of these genes leads to β-cell dysfunction and diabetes mellitus. Although the mutations of the gene that encodes PDX-1 (MODY4) are rare, several mutations in PDX-1 have been reported such as frame-shift and missense mutations. Functional analyses of these mutations demonstrated decreased binding activity of PDX-1 to the insulin promoter accompanied by reduced transcription of insulin in response to hyperglycemia in vitro.

The first indication that PDX-1 might be associated with type 2 diabetes came from studies of an infant in whom the diagnosis of pancreatic agenesis was made by autopsy after a survival of 18 days. The infant was found to be homozygous for an inactivating cytosine deletion in the protein coding sequence of PDX-1. This frame-shift mutation generated a truncated protein that lacked a functional homeodomain necessary for DNA binding and nuclear localization. This mutation is of particular interest since it could generate 2 isoforms of the protein. One isoform, detectable with an N-terminal antibody, was present in the cytosol, contained an intact N-terminal transactivation domain and a foreign 59-amino-acid segment. This protein was unable to activate transcription of the insulin promoter and acted as a dominant negative regulator by inhibiting the transactivation function of the wild-type PDX-1. The second mutant PDX-1 isoform was recognized by a C-terminal antibody but not by an N-terminal antibody. This protein used an internal out-of-frame initiation codon to generate a third open-reading frame. This open-reading frame crosses over to the wild-type reading frame at the site of the cytosine deletion, generating a protein that contains the DNA binding domain and the nuclear localization signal but lacks a transactivation domain. Additional PDX-1 mutations have since been identified in French, UK, and Swedish families. Six of these disorders were missense mutations (C18R, Q59L, D76N, R197H, G212R, and P239Q) and 1 that inserts a proline at position 243. All mutations seem to affect transcription of the insulin gene with an impaired response to oral glucose.

Transplantation of insulin-producing cells is a powerful tool for the treatment of type 1 and some cases of type 2 diabetes; however, this strategy is hindered by the limitation of donor supply. Progression through the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic islet engineering could help to generate sufficient β cells from embryonic stem cells and overcome this problem. Furthermore, recently Ferber et al have reported that ectopic expression of PDX-1 in liver cells could endow the hepatic tissue with pancreatic β-cell characteristics and induce secretion of insulin from liver cells. This report indicates the capacity of PDX-1 to reprogram extrapancreatic tissue toward a β-cell phenotype. From this research, it can be proposed that

the self-neogenesis of islets in organs such as the liver, spleen, and pancreas through the introduction of PDX-1 and/or other related genes may be possible and would potentially provide a valuable approach for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

### Insulinoma

Islet cell tumors of the pancreas are rare, occurring in only 5 of every 1 million people annually in the United States. These tumors are named according to the hormones that they produce: insulinoma (β-cell origin), gastrinoma (non-β-cell origin), VIPoma (non-β-cell origin), glucagonoma (α-cell origin), and somatostatinoma [δ-cell origin]. Insulinomas are the most common form of the islet cell tumors. Ninety percent of insulinomas are benign, but 65% of malignant insulinomas have a 5-year recurrence rate, with an average survival of <4 years. Insulinomas can occur in either a sporadic or hereditary manner. The genetic events that occur during the initiation and progression of sporadic insulinoma are poorly understood. Multiple endocrine neoplasia affects primarily the pituitary, pancreas, and parathyroid gland and is caused by mutations in the menin gene. Menin is deficient in most hereditary cases but is not obviously affected in the majority of sporadic tumors.

There is no effective medical treatment of the devastating symptoms associated with hyperinsulinemia of insulinoma. However, with the identification of tissue-specific promoters, tumors can be targeted by gene therapy. Cancer-specific promoters are being identified and used in an effort to modify the expression of the suicidal gene, thymidine kinase, in tumor cells. However, these therapies have limitations as a result of either the weakness of the promoter or the tissue specificity of its activation. Since 1991, the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) gene, under the transcriptional control of a ubiquitous promoter, has been introduced into a host and experienced significant cell death in the presence of ganciclovir, an analogue of guanosine required for both mammalian and viral TK to become active. In viral TK-containing cells, ganciclovir is double phosphorylated into an intermediate that inhibits DNA synthesis by acting as a chain terminator, killing dividing cells. However, TK with a ubiquitous promoter is not cell specific, limiting its use as a cytotoxic agent. Rat insulin promoter (RIP) is an example of a cell-specific promoter that is activated in cells that produce insulin. Our study suggests that insulinoma cells [NIT-1] can be targeted in vitro using RIP-directed gene therapy. A significant decrease in cell survival was observed in NIT-1 cells transfected with RIP-TK in vitro. NIT-1 cells, when injected into the mouse peritoneum, resulted in death from hypoglycemia within 100 days. The development of the insulinoma mouse model has allowed the examination of RIP-driven, promoter-specific gene therapy in vivo. RIP-TK was successful in targeting NIT-1 tumor cells in vivo. The RIP-TK gene in concert with ganciclovir was able to prevent hypoglycemia and prevent tumor growth in NIT-1-injected mice. To explain RIP activation in NIT-1 cells, reverse

transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) were performed on NIT-1 cell RNA and nuclear extract. Results showed the presence of known RIP transcription factors BETA2 and PDX-1. The data suggested that the transcription factors BETA2 and PDX-1 are both present in NIT-1 cells and that these transcriptional proteins bind to and transactivate RIP, which results in cell-specific gene expression. ${ }^{115}$

# Pancreatic Cancer

Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the United States, affecting more than 28,000 patients each year. It is one of the few cancers in which its incidence equals its mortality. ${ }^{116}$ Incidence rates for pancreatic cancer increase steadily with age, with >80% of cases occurring in individuals between the ages of 60 and 80 years. At the time of diagnosis, 15% had localized disease, 40% had localized but unresectable disease, and the remaining 45% had distant metastases. Of the metastases present, 80% were liver, 40% were peritoneal dissemination, and 20% had both types. Several kinds of genetic modifications in pancreatic cancer have been reported, eg, activation of the oncogenes such as K-ras and CaSm, and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as p16 and p53. Although several clinical trials have been conducted, such as extended operations, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, results showed no survival benefit. Clearly, novel approaches for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are needed to improve outcomes. Gene therapy is one approach that allows direct treatment of tumor cells, by either modifying the malignant cells or delivering a cytotoxic gene to the tumor. Our unpublished data suggest that insulinoma cells, pancreatic cancer cells, and the liver metastases cells expressed significantly increased levels of PDX-1. This would allow us to examine the effect of the RIP-TK gene or human insulin promoter (HIP)-TK gene in concert with ganciclovir.

## CONCLUSION

This review discussed the role of PDX-1 in the development of the pancreas, the differentiation of the endocrine islet cells, and pancreatic disorders. The past few years have brought about great advances in knowledge of the formation of the pancreas. Among these are the enhanced study and understanding of transcription factors as well as of signal transduction pathways from other tissues and the pancreatic islet cells themselves. Undoubtedly, the growing knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic development, differentiation, and pancreatic disorders will ultimately lead to better treatments for these debilitating diseases.
