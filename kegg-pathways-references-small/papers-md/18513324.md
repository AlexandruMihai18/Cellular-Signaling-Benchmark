NADPH oxidases of the Nox family exist in various supergroups of eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes, and play crucial roles in a variety of biological processes, such as host defense, signal transduction, and hormone synthesis. In conjunction with NADPH oxidation, Nox enzymes reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide as a primary product, and this is further converted to various reactive oxygen species. The electron-transfer system in Nox is composed of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region homologous to the prokaryotic (and organelle) enzyme ferredoxin reductase and the N-terminal six transmembrane segments containing two hemes, a structure similar to that of cytochrome *b* of the mitochondrial *bc*₁ complex. During the course of eukaryote evolution, Nox enzymes have developed regulatory mechanisms, depending on their functions, by inserting a regulatory domain (or motif) into their own sequences or by obtaining a tightly associated protein as a regulatory subunit. For example, one to four Ca²⁺-binding EF-hand motifs are present at the N-termini in several subfamilies, such as the respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) subfamily in land plants (the supergroup Plantae), the NoxC subfamily in social amoebae (the Amoebozoa), and the Nox5 and dual oxidase (Duox) subfamilies in animals (the Opisthokonta), whereas an SH3 domain is inserted into the ferredoxin–NADP⁺ reductase region of two Nox enzymes in *Naegleria gruberi*, a unicellular organism that belongs to the supergroup Excavata. Members of the Nox1–4 subfamily in animals form a stable heterodimer with the membrane protein p22<sup>phox</sup>, which functions as a docking site for the SH3 domain-containing regulatory proteins p47<sup>phox</sup>, p67<sup>phox</sup>, and p40<sup>phox</sup>; the small GTPase Rac binds to p67<sup>phox</sup> (or its homologous protein), which serves as a switch for Nox activation. Similarly, Rac activates the fungal NoxA via binding to the p67<sup>phox</sup>-like protein Nox regulator (NoxR). In plants, on the other hand, this GTPase directly interacts with the N-terminus of Rboh, leading to superoxide production. Here I describe the regulation of Nox-family oxidases on the basis of three-dimensional structures and evolutionary conservation.

Structure, regulation and evolution of Nox

H. Sumimoto

## Introduction

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are conventionally regarded as inevitable deleterious byproducts of aerobic metabolism. On the other hand, there exist enzymes dedicated to ROS production. The first example of such enzymes is an NADPH oxidase expressed in mammalian professional phagocytes [1–10]. During engulfment of invading microbes, the phagocyte NADPH oxidase becomes activated to reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide anion ($O_2^-$), a precursor of microbicidal ROS, in conjunction with oxidation of NADPH. As the rapid increase in oxygen consumption during phagocytosis is known as the respiratory burst, this enzyme is also called respiratory burst oxidase. The significance of the phagocyte oxidase in host defense is exemplified by recurrent and life-threatening infections that occur in patients with chronic granulomatous disease, whose phagocytes genetically lack the superoxide-producing activity [11, 12].

The catalytic core of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase ($phox$) is gp91$^{phox}$, a membrane-integrated glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of about 91 kDa.

gp91$^{phox}$ contains two hemes in the N-terminal transmembrane region, and NADPH-binding and FAD-binding domains in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region (Fig. 1A), forming a complete apparatus that transports electrons from NADPH via FAD and two hemes to molecular oxygen. In the mid-1990s, homologs of the flavocytochrome gp91$^{phox}$ were discovered in land plants; these have been designated respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) [13–15]. Subsequent searches in genome databases led to the identification of novel homologs of gp91$^{phox}$ in animals, which are presently known as Nox (NADPH oxidase) or Duox (dual oxidase) [1–10]. The human genome contains seven genes encoding gp91$^{phox}$ homologs: Nox1–Nox5, where gp91$^{phox}$ is renamed Nox2, and the distantly related oxidases Duox1 and Duox2. It is currently known that a wide variety of eukaryotes express superoxide-producing NADPH oxidases that harbor a gp91$^{phox}$-like electron-transferring system; the enzymes constitute the Nox family. Recent studies on Nox-family enzymes have increasingly clarified the importance of deliberate ROS production in various biological events, including signal transduction, development, and hormone biosynthesis, in addition to well-established roles in host defense [1–10]. It is likely that individual Nox enzymes have developed regulatory systems, according to their respective special functions, during the course of eukaryote evolution by inserting a regulatory domain (or motif) into their own sequences or by obtaining a tightly associated protein as a regulatory subunit. Regulation by these proteins includes multiple protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. In this review, I describe post-translational regulation of Nox-family enzymes on the basis of three-dimensional structures and evolutionary conservation.

### Structure of Nox-family enzymes

The phagocyte NADPH oxidase gp91$^{phox}$/Nox2 (570 amino acid residues) exists in not only the plasma membrane but also the membrane of the specific granule in neutrophils: the latter contains a higher amount of Nox2 [1–10]. Although the phagosomal membrane is considered to primarily derive from the plasma membrane, the specific granule is fused to the phagosome during phagocytosis, and thus gp91$^{phox}$/Nox2 is further enriched in the phagosomal membrane. For killing engulfed microbes, superoxide (and microbicidal ROS derived from superoxide) must be produced from molecular oxygen within the phagosome. The intraphagosomal production requires electrons to be transported from the cytoplasmic NADPH across the membrane into the interior of the phagosome. Such

transmembrane electron transport very often involves di-heme membrane proteins.

gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 can be divided into two parts of similar size (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal half is a cytoplasmic domain homologous to ferredoxin–NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase (FNR), bearing the NADPH-binding and FAD-binding sites [16,17], whereas the N-terminal moiety comprises six predicted α-helical transmembrane segments (Fig. 1A). The bipartite structure is common not only to all the Nox-family enzymes but also to the family of fungal ferric reductases (Fre) [18]. Fre enzymes, which are expressed in the plasma membrane, reduce Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> for iron and copper uptake, but fail to use molecular oxygen as a substrate [19,20].

Among the conserved transmembrane segments of gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2, the third and fifth helices each contain two invariant His residues, which are considered to provide the axial and distal ligands for binding to the irons of two nonidentical hemes, thereby placing one heme towards the cytoplasmic face and the other towards the outer face (Fig. 1B). As the hemes are oriented perpendicular to the surface of the membrane, electrons are transferred from the cytosolic NADPH, through FAD, and across the membrane via the hemes to molecular oxygen, leading to superoxide production. Thus, transmembrane electron transport in gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 is considered to occur in the N-terminal bis-heme-containing region [18,21].

This model was initially proposed on the basis of a similar motif consisting of two pairs of spaced His residues that was predicted to be linked to heme coordination in a class of organelle and bacterial b-type cytochromes, such as the bis-heme cytochrome *b* of the mitochondrial cytochrome *bc*<sub>1</sub> complex (complex III) and cytochrome *b*<sub>6</sub> of the chloroplast cytochrome *b*<sub>6</sub>*f* complex [22–24] (Fig. 1C). The model for two bis-histidyl heme ligation was subsequently verified by determination of crystal structures of protein complexes containing these cytochromes [25–28]. In cytochrome *b* of the cytochrome *bc*<sub>1</sub> complex, containing eight α-helical transmembrane segments, the two *b*-type hemes are bound within a four helix bundle formed by the first four segments: His residues ligated to both hemes are located in the second and fourth helices [25,26,29], and a pair of the His residues in each helix are separated by 13 intervening amino acids (Fig. 1C). A similar coordination occurs in cytochrome *b*<sub>6</sub> of the cytochrome *b*<sub>6</sub>*f* complex in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts [27,28]: cytochrome *b*<sub>6</sub> comprises four α-helical transmembrane segments [30,31], and the two hemes are bis-His-coordinated by imidazole side chains separated by 13 and 14 residues in the second and fourth helices, respectively (Fig. 1C). In the fungal Fre-family enzymes, both His

pairs are separated by 13 amino acids, as in cytochrome *b* of the cytochrome *bc*<sub>1</sub> complex (Fig. 1C).

Although gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2, as well as other Nox-family enzymes, contains a pair of His residues in the third transmembrane α-helix with 13 intervening amino acids (His101 and His115 in human gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2), the other pair in the fifth helix (His209 and His222 in human gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2) are separated by 12 amino acids (Fig. 1). It should be noted that the imidazoles separated by 12–14 amino acids are likely to face the same side of the helix. Substitution of any of these four His residues results in disrupted insertion of hemes into gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 [32], supporting the view that the two bis-histidyl heme ligation also occurs in gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2.

Reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide in gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 requires both heme groups to be in the low-spin (hexacoordinate) state, which implies that electron transfer to oxygen occurs via the outer heme in a pocket near the heme edge, rather than through direct coordination of oxygen to the heme iron [33,34]. This outer sphere (or peripheral) mechanism is consistent with the ‘two bis-histidyl heme ligation’ structure, and explains well why gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2-catalyzed superoxide production is not inhibited by cyanide or carbon monoxide. Taken together, electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen occurs in a module designated the Nox superdomain. The Nox superdomain comprises two moieties, the N-terminal bis-heme cytochrome *b*, composed of six α-helical transmembrane segments, and the C-terminal FNR, which contains FAD-binding and NADPH-binding domains. Thus, gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 and its relatives (the Nox family) are flavocytochromes [16,17,35].

It is known that members of the Duox subfamily in animals, in contrast to oxidases of the other subfamilies, release H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> without forming detectable amounts of superoxide [36]. However, they are also expected to produce superoxide as an initial product, as Duox has the superoxide-producing Nox superdomain that comprises the bis-heme-containing transmembrane region and the FNR-like moiety. Indeed, it has been reported that Duox in an immature form is capable of producing superoxide [37]. In mature Duox, superoxide produced by the Nox superdomain may be rapidly converted to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via intramolecular dismutation, possibly by a peroxidase-like ectodomain; this module is located on the outer surface of the membrane, where superoxide is expected to be released.

In addition to the Nox and Fre families, both the bis-heme transmembrane segment and FNR-related moiety are present in ferric-chelate reductase (FRO) of land plants [38]. To acquire iron from soils of low iron availability, land plants such as *Arabidopsis thaliana*

reduce Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ by FRO in the plasma membrane of root epithelial cells. Four His residues in FRO that lie on two predicted, similarly orientated, transmembrane α-helices are in equivalent locations to the His residues in Nox enzymes that coordinate the two hemes: the 13 and 12 amino acids separating heme-liganding His residues exist in the helices (Fig. 1C). The FRO-family enzymes contain eight or 10 transmembrane segments, which is different from the situation in members of the Nox and Fre families; the precise membrane topology of FRO enzymes remains controversial [39,40].

### Origin of Nox-family enzymes

There is no evidence for the presence of Nox, Fre or FRO in prokaryotes: a superfamily of flavocytochromes that transport electrons across membranes. On the other hand, members of this superfamily are present in a variety of eukaryotes. The shared bis-heme binding motif raises the possibility of an evolutionary and functional relationship between the eukaryotic cell surface membrane proteins Nox, Fre and FRO and the prokaryotic (or organelle) b-type cytochromes. On the other hand, the C-terminal moiety of the flavocytochrome superfamily is homologous to FNR, a prokaryotic (organelle) protein that is made up of two structural domains, each containing about 150 amino acids: the C-terminal region includes most of the residues involved in NADPH binding, whereas the large cleft between the two domains accommodates the FAD group [41,42]. It is tempting to postulate that a gene encoding a protein containing two di-heme transmembrane helices was fused to an FNR gene in eukaryote evolution, leading to a common ancestor of the Nox and Fre families (Fig. 2). In this context, it seems interesting that FNR directly interacts with the cytochrome *b*₆*f* complex of plant chloroplasts, albeit in a noncovalent manner, and participates in electron transfer [43]; cytochrome *b*₆ in the complex has two *b*-type hemes across the membrane, as expected for Nox.

A similar fusion of the FNR gene with a gene encoding an electron-transporting protein is also considered to have occurred during evolution: eukaryotic diflavin reductases such as NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR or P450R), methionine synthase reductase and novel reductase 1 probably arose from the fusion of the ancestral genes for FNR and flavodoxin, a prokaryotic FMN-containing protein that transfers electrons in a variety of photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic reactions in prokaryotes [43–48] (Fig. 2). In turn, a diflavin reductase is likely to be the precursor of further fusion products such as nitric oxide reductase, which consists of a C-terminal CPR-like domain and an N-terminal, heme-containing oxygenase domain [48,49].

### Distribution of Nox-family enzymes in eukaryotes

In contrast to the absence of Nox in prokaryotes, genes encoding Nox-family enzymes are found in a wide variety of eukaryotes. Eukaryotes can be divided into several major supergroups, including the Opisthokonta, the Amoebozoa, the Plantae, the Excavata, the Rhizaria, and the Chromalveolata (the Heterokonta plus the Alveolata): animals and fungi belong to the Opisthokonta; the social amoeba *Dictyostelium discoideum* is a member of the Amoebozoa; land plants and red algae belong to the Plantae; and diatoms and oomycetes are members of the Heterokonta, a group that belongs to the Chromalveolata (Fig. 3) [50–52].

Fig. 3. Distribution of Nox-family enzymes in eukaryotes and animals. Upper panel: eukaryotes can be divided into six major supergroups, including the Opisthokonta, the Amoebozoa, the Plantae, the Excavata, the Rhizaria, and the Chromalveolata. All the supergroups except the Rhizaria are known to contain Nox genes. Lower panel: M. b., Mo. brevicollis; N. v., Ne. vectensis; L. g., Lot. gigantea; C. sp. I, Capitella sp. I; C. e., Ca. elegans; D. m., Dr. melanogaster; S. p., S. purpuratus; B. f., B. floridae; C. i., Ci. intestinalis; D. r., Da. rerio; X. t., X. tropicalis; G. g., Ga. gallus; H. s., Homo sapiens.

The relationships between these supergroups, however, remain to be determined, and thus the root of eukaryotes is presently uncertain [53,54].

Recent expansion of information available in genome databases has revealed that Nox-family enzymes are present in all the eukaryotic supergroups except the Rhizaria (Fig. 3). This suggests that a common ancestor of Nox genes emerged at an early stage in the evolution of eukaryotes; it diverged well in some lineages (e.g. in the Opisthokonta and Plantae), whereas it was often lost in some other lineages. The loss of Nox genes appears to have occurred at multiple stages in eukaryote evolution. For example, in the supergroup Amoebozoa, the social amoeba Di. discoideum contains three Nox genes [55], whereas they are absent in Entamoeba histolytica [56]. In the supergroup Excavata, the heterolobosa Naegleria gruberi has at least two Nox genes, as found by the present search using the database of the DOE's Joint Genome Institute (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/euk_home.html) (Fig. 3); on the other hand, no Nox gene has been found in the kinetoplastid Leishmania major or Trypanosoma brunei, or the diplomonad Giardia lamblia [56]. In the Chromalveolata, Nox genes are present in genomes of the oomycete Phytophthora sojae [56,57] and the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana [58], although they have not been found in the genomes of Plasmodium falciparum and Theileria parva, both of which belong to the same supergroup [56]. Even in the Opisthokonta, Nox genes have been lost independently in several fungal lineages;

for example, a Nox gene is absent in budding and fission yeasts [56,57,59].

Regulation of Nox-family enzymes by Ca²⁺

Superoxide production by Nox is regulated by various mechanisms. Several subfamilies of Nox enzymes appear to be directly regulated by Ca²⁺. It is well established that mammalian thyroid oxidase and sea urchin NADPH oxidase, both of which belong to the Duox subfamily, are reversibly activated by Ca²⁺. In addition to the Nox superdomain comprising the bis-heme-containing transmembrane region and the FNR-homologous moiety, Duox-subfamily oxidases feature an N-terminal peroxidase-like ectodomain that is separated from two EF-hands by an additional transmembrane segment (Fig. 4). Biosynthesis of thyroid hormones in humans requires Duox2, which is highly expressed in the thyroid gland: mutations in Duox2 are associated with a loss of thyroid hormone synthesis and can lead to permanent and severe congenital hypothyroidism [60]. With the H₂O₂ produced by Doux2, thyroid peroxidase catalyzes conjugation of iodide ions to Tyr residues on thyroglobulin in the thyroid follicles, an essential step for the synthesis of the active hormone [61]. On the other hand, during fertilization of sea urchins, a rapid increase in H₂O₂ generation occurs, which is catalyzed by the sea urchin Duox homolog Udx1, leading to formation of the fertiliza-

tion envelope as the physical block to polyspermy [62]. It is also known that Duox1 of *Caenorhabditis elegans* in the phylum Nematoda is involved in cross-linking of Tyr residues of extracellular matrix proteins, thereby facilitating cuticle formation [63], and that Duox plays a critical role in innate immunity in the gut of the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* in the phylum Arthropoda [64].

Regulation of Duox by Ca²⁺ probably occurs via its paired EF-hand motif. It has been reported that limited proteolysis with α-chymotrypsin renders thyroid NADPH oxidase fully and irreversibly active independently of Ca²⁺ [65]. This implies that the Ca²⁺-binding EF-hands of Duox serve as an autoinhibitory domain, whereas those of Nox5 function as an activation domain [66]. The inhibition of Duox by the EF-hands might be released reversibly by physiological Ca²⁺-induced conformational change and irreversibly by proteolytic removal of the autoinhibitory domain [37]. A recent study has shown that ectopically expressed Duox produces ROS without cell stimuli, and the production is enhanced two-fold by the addition of ionomycin [67], suggesting that elevation of cytoplasmic concentrations of Ca²⁺ is dispensable. Besides direct regulation by Ca²⁺, protein kinase C (PKC) may modulate Duox in a Ca²⁺-independent manner, as ROS production in thyrocytes is triggered by 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an agent that activates PKC without elevating the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca²⁺ [68]. A PKC-dependent

pathway may also function in H₂O₂ generation at fertilization in the sea urchin [62].

In addition to the animal Duox subfamily, oxidases of other two subfamilies have been shown to be directly regulated by elevations in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentrations: the Nox5 subfamily in animals [66,69,70], and the Rboh subfamily in land plants [71,72] (Fig. 4). The regulation by Ca²⁺ appears to be consistent with the presence of the Ca²⁺-binding EF-hand motif in the cytoplasmic region N-terminal to the Nox superdomain (Fig. 4).

Human Nox5 is abundantly expressed in T and B cells of spleen and lymph nodes, and also in the sperm precursors of testis [69]. Although the role for mammalian Nox5 remains unknown, *Drosophila* Nox5 has been reported to mediate smooth muscle contraction [70]. Oxidases of this subfamily build on the basic structure of the Nox prototype, adding an N-terminal extension that contains four EF-hands: three canonical motifs and one noncanonical motif [63] (Fig. 4). Biochemical analysis has shown that activation of Nox5 is directly regulated by Ca²⁺: superoxide production by Nox5-containing membrane fractions is dependent on the presence of Ca²⁺ [66]; and cells ectopically expressing Nox5 produce superoxide in response to the Ca²⁺ ionophore ionomycin [69]. The Ca²⁺-binding domain of Nox5, in contrast to that of Duox, may function as an activator module: the binding of Ca²⁺ causes a conformational change, which leads to intramolecular interaction of the N-terminal Ca²⁺-binding domain with the
C-terminal Nox superdomain, culminating in Nox5 activation [66]. On the other hand, the EC<sub>50</sub> for calcium of about 1 μM, determined in a cell-free activation system for Nox5 [66], is relatively high and unlikely to be achieved in most cells treated with physiological stimulants. Two mechanisms for the elevation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity have recently been proposed [73,74]. First, PKC phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues in the FAD-binding domain of Nox5, which increases the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the Nox5 activity regulated by the N-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain [73]. Second, a consensus calmodulin-binding site is present in the NADPH-binding domain of Nox5; calmodulin interacts with the site at a lower concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thereby elevating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity for Nox5 activation [74].

The Rboh subfamily of NADPH oxidases is responsible for ROS formation associated with plant defense responses, and also plays a crucial role in plant development [13,14,75]. Ten and nine members are present in *A. thaliana* [14] and the rice *Oryza sativa* [76], respectively. The Rboh-subfamily enzymes carry an N-terminal extension with two EF-hand motifs (Fig. 4). It has been reported that only about a two-fold to three-fold increase in superoxide production occurs in the membrane fraction of tobacco and tomato upon addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>; in addition, the effect requires high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (approximately millimolar) [71]. This observation suggests that the direct effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> may not contribute to Rboh activation to a large extent. A recent study has shown that elicitor-responsive phosphorylation of the N-terminal region of Rboh is involved in superoxide production [77,78], which is mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases [77]. Activation of Rboh is also regulated by plant homologs of the Rho-family small GTPase Rac (also known as Rop for Rho-like protein) [79–81]; Rac in the GTP-bound form functions by directly binding to the N-terminal region of Rboh, and this is probably inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup> [76]. Thus, regulation of Rboh is more complicated than previously expected, as described in detail in a later section.

As in plant Rboh, two copies of EF-hands are present in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of the NoxC-subfamily members in the Amoebozoa and Nox enzymes in oomycetes of the eukaryotic supergroup Chromalveolata [57], whereas enzymes in the fungal NoxC subfamily contain a single EF-hand in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region [56,57,59]. These subfamilies of Nox enzymes may be regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>; however, no experimental evidence for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated regulation has been obtained.

It is presently unknown whether the EF-hand-containing Nox subfamilies originated from a common

Structure, regulation and evolution of Nox ancestor gene. It seems rather likely that EF-hand motifs have been obtained independently several times during evolution. The genomes of *Monosiga brevicollis* in the choanoflagellates (a sister group of animals) and *Nematostella vectensis* in the cnidarians (a basal group of animals) contain solely Nox2-like enzymes, and not EF-hand-containing oxidases such as Nox5 and Duox, although these two families are found in a variety of species of protostomes and deuterostomes (Fig. 3). Thus, Nox5 and Duox may have evolved from Nox2-like prototype oxidases. Similarly, in fungi, the NoxC subfamily containing an EF-hand is found solely in more evolved groups, including the Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes, whereas the Nox2-like EF-hand-free subfamilies NoxA and NoxB are present also in relatively basal groups such as the Chytridiomyceta and Basidiomycota [57]. These features suggest that the NoxC subfamily emerged at a later stage of fungal evolution. Thus, the classification of the Nox family in eukaryotes into the two major groups, depending on the presence or absence of the EF-hand motif, does not seem to reflect molecular evolution.

### Regulation of Nox-family enzymes by protein–protein interactions

The genome of *Na. gruberi* (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/euk_home.html), a member of the eukaryotic superfamily Excavata, contains two genes encoding Nox-family enzymes of 627 and 630 amino acids, both of which have an SH3 domain and thus are tentatively designated as NoxSH3 (Fig. 5). The SH3 domain is inserted into a loop region in the NADPH-binding domain of the C-terminal FNR-homologous region (Fig. 5). It is tempting to postulate that the NoxSH3 enzymes in *Naegleria* are regulated by a protein harboring a proline-rich region (PRR); SH3 domains are generally known as modules that recognize a PRR to mediate protein–protein interactions [82,83]. Identification of a NoxSH3-binding protein will shed light on our understanding of Nox regulation.

Nox1–Nox4 in animals form a heterodimer with the nonglycosylated integral membrane protein p22<sup>phox</sup>, which contains two (or possibly four) putative transmembrane segments (Fig. 4). The complex of gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 with p22<sup>phox</sup> in phagocytes is known as flavocytochrome b<sub>558</sub>. In the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of p22<sup>phox</sup>, there exists a PRR, which serves as an anchoring site, thereby juxtaposing the catalytic center gp91<sup>phox</sup> and the SH3 domain-containing regulatory proteins p47<sup>phox</sup>, p67<sup>phox</sup>, and p40<sup>phox</sup>; on the other hand, the small GTPase Rac functions in Nox activation by interacting with p67<sup>phox</sup> or its homolo-

The two NoxSH3 enzymes in *Na. gruberi*, tentatively named NoxSH3-1 and NoxSH3-2, contain 627 and 630 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid sequences of NoxSH3-1 and NoxSH3-2 are shown: the heme-coordinated His residues in transmembrane segment 3 (TM3) and TM5 are shown in red; residues of FAD-binding motifs are shown in green; residues of NADPH-binding motifs are shown in blue; and residues of the SH3 domain are shown in magenta. A model for the structure of NoxSH3 is also shown. The SH3 domain is inserted into the C-terminal NADPH-binding domain. Cylinders represent six transmembrane α-helices.

ization of each protein [1–10]. Formation of the mutually stabilizing complex appears to require the correct folding of Nox, because heme incorporation into gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 is essential for heterodimer formation [84].

It is known that human Duox2 associates with a specific maturing protein named DuoxA2, which contains putative five transmembrane helices [67,85] (Fig. 6). The membrane protein DuoxA2 allows the transition from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, maturation and translocation to the plasma membrane of functional Duox2 [67,85]. Interestingly, the DuoxA2 gene is arranged head-to-head and coexpressed with the Duox2 gene; the gene for DuoxA1, a paralog of DuoxA2, is similarly linked to the Duox1 gene [85]. Biallelic inactivation of the DuoxA2 gene has recently been reported as a novel cause of congenital hypothyroidism [86], confirming its crucial contribution to function of Duox2, which is directly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis [60].

The Nox subfamilies in animals

The Nox enzymes in animals can be divided into three subfamilies: one containing Nox1–Nox4 (the Nox1–4

gous proteins. Detailed mechanisms for regulation by these proteins will be described below. Complex formation of p22<sup>phox</sup> with Nox also contributes to the stabil-

subgroup), which form a heterodimer with p22<sup>phox</sup> [87–93]; the Nox5 subfamily; and the Duox subfamily (Fig. 4). Although the Nox5 and Duox subfamilies are not found in the sea anemone *Ne. vectensis* of the Cnidaria (the basal group of animals) (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/euk_home.html) [94] (Fig. 3), they were probably present at the protostome–deuterostome divergence. This is because the Nox5 and Duox subfamilies exist in both extant protostomes and deuterostomes, with the exception that Nox5 has been lost in the lineage of the phylum Nematoda and in that of the order Rodentia in mammals: Nox5 is absent in the nematode *Ca. elegans* and the rodents mouse and rat (Fig. 3).

On the other hand, Nox2, a member of the Nox1–4 subgroup, was present before the divergence of the Choanoflagellata and Metazoa (equivalent to animals): Nox2 is found not only in the Cnidaria but also in the choanoflagellate *Mo. brevicollis* (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/euk_home.html) [94] (Fig. 3). During the evolution of protostomes, one of the two major groups of animals, Nox2 has been lost in the lineage of the clade Ecdysozoa, including the phyla Arthropoda and Nematoda: Nox2 is absent in the fruitfly *Drosophila* and the nematode *Ca. elegans*. On the other hand, Nox2 is present in the Lophotrochozoa, another major protostian clade, including the phyla Mollusca and Annelida: this oxidase exists in the limpet *Lottia gigantea* (Mollusca) and the leech *Capitella* species (Annelida) (Fig. 3). Thus, it is likely that Nox2 is the closest to the ancestral Nox in animals. In contrast, Nox1, Nox3 and Nox4 are not found in protostomes or the Echinodermata, a phylum that belongs to the deuterostomes (a sister group of protostomes). These three Nox enzymes appear to have diverged from Nox2 at distinct stages of evolution of the phylum Chordata in deuterostomes.

The Chordata is divided into three subphyla: the Vertebrata, Urochordata (also known as the Tunicata), and the Cephalochordata. Although tunicates were long considered to be the earliest offshoot of the chordate lineage, and cephalochordates (such as amphioxus) as the closest group to vertebrates, recent analyses have reversed their positions: amphioxus is now viewed as the ‘basal chordate’ [95], and tunicates as the sister group, or closest relatives, of the vertebrates [96] (Fig. 3). Thus, our understanding of the evolution of a certain protein in the Chordata requires information on the corresponding protein in the subphylum Cephalochordata. The present search for the database of the amphioxus (lancelet) *Branchiostoma floridae* (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/euk_home.html) revealed that, in addition to Nox2, Nox5, and Duox, Nox4 exists in the Cephalochordata. It is known that

Nox4 is present in *Ciona intestinalis* (the Urochordata) [97] but not in the sea urchin *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus* of the phylum Echinodermata, another major group of the Chordata [90]. Therefore, Nox4 appears to have branched from a root close to Nox2 with the emergence of the Chordata. Nox1 is found from fishes to mammals, but not in the Urochordata or Cephalochordata, suggesting that this oxidase probably arose with the emergence of the Vertebrata. Nox3 has emerged most recently, probably from a common ancestor of birds and mammals, because it is found solely in mammals and birds, but not in fishes or amphibians [98] (Fig. 3).

The membrane protein p22<sup>phox</sup> has been demonstrated to be complexed with mammalian Nox1–Nox4. Consistent with this, p22<sup>phox</sup> is absent in the Ecdysozoa, where the Nox1–4 subfamily is absent, but widely distributed in species that have Nox2, including the choanoflagellate *Mo. brevicollis* and the cnidarian *Ne. vectensis*. The known exceptions are the leech *Capitella* species (the Annelida) and the sea urchin *S. purpuratus* (the Echinodermata). Nox2 of these species or groups might be stable without p22<sup>phox</sup>, leading to loss of the p22<sup>phox</sup> gene. It may also be possible that the p22<sup>phox</sup> gene escaped cloning or correct sequencing for unknown reasons, which is known to often occur in various genome projects.

# Regulation of the Nox1–4 subfamily in animals

The phagocyte oxidase gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 in mammals is dormant in resting cells, but becomes activated during phagocytosis to produce superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal ROS. The oxidase activity is spatially and temporally restricted to the phagosome, as inappropriate or excessive production of ROS results in damage to surrounding cells and severe inflammation. Activation of gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 requires stimulus-induced membrane translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup>, p67<sup>phox</sup>, p40<sup>phox</sup>, and Rac, i.e. formation of the active oxidase complex at the membrane (Fig. 7A). The essential role of these regulatory proteins is evident from the following two lines of evidence. First, the phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity can be reconstituted in a cell-free system with gp91<sup>phox</sup>, p22<sup>phox</sup>, p47<sup>phox</sup>, p67<sup>phox</sup>, and Rac, using an anionic amphiphile, e.g. arachidonic acid, as an in vitro stimulant. Second, defects in any of the four genes encoding gp91<sup>phox</sup>, p22<sup>phox</sup>, p47<sup>phox</sup> and p67<sup>phox</sup> cause the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease [11,12].

In the cytoplasm of resting cells, p47<sup>phox</sup>, p67<sup>phox</sup> and p40<sup>phox</sup> form a ternary complex, whereas Rac is

tor [88]. The superoxide-producing activity can be strongly enhanced by p47phox, Noxo1, and p67phox [89,110,114,115]. In the presence of p67phox or Noxa1, Nox3 activity is upregulated by Rac [110,116].

Although it is well known that Nox4 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of the adult and fetal kidney [117,118] and vascular endothelial cells [91,119], its function remains to be elucidated. Nox4 is complexed with p22phox as well [80,82,84], and constitutively generates superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner [120]. The mechanism of Nox4 regulation is largely unknown at present: Nox4-mediated superoxide generation appears to be independent of p47phox, Noxo1, p67phox, or Noxa1 [89,117,118], whereas the role of Rac remains controversial [79,121].

**The organizer p47phox is required for Nox2 activation**

The oxidase organizer p47phox is a 390 amino acid protein that contains, from the N-terminus, a phagocyte oxidase (PX) domain, tandem SH3 domains, and a PRR (Fig. 7). The two SH3 domains cooperatively interact with the PRR in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of p22phox, an interaction that is essential for both membrane translocation of p47phox and oxidase activation [122–124]. The tandem SH3 domains sandwich a short PRR of p22phox (amino acid residues 151–160), containing a polyproline II (PPII) helix [125–127] (Fig. 8). Pro152, Pro156 and Arg158 in the human p22phox PRR are indispensable for the interaction with p47phox: Pro152 and Pro156 are recognized by the N-terminal SH3 domain, whereas Arg158 directly contacts with the C-terminal one [127] (Fig. 8). On the other hand, Pro151, Pro155, Pro157 and Pro160 are also involved in binding to p47phox but to a lesser extent [127].

The gene encoding p22phox exists in a wide variety of animals and also in the Choanoflagellata, a sister group of the Metazoa (Animalia) [128,129]; the p22phox gene is absent in the Ecdysozoa, which is consistent with the absence of the Nox1–4 subfamily in this clade (Fig. 9). The p22phox region comprising the N-terminal cytoplasmic region and the two transmembrane segments is functionally important [130] and well conserved in the Metazoa (animals) and Choanoflagellata, whereas the C-terminal cytoplasmic region is highly variable except for the PRR (Fig. 8). The three residues indispensable for binding to p47phox (Pro152, Pro156 and Arg158 in human p22phox) are invariant in all known animal p22phox proteins (Fig. 8), although identifiable p47phox exists solely in the phylum Chordata, as described later (Fig. 9).

Interactions in a resting state are indicated by blue arrows, stimulus-induced interactions by arrows in magenta, and constitutive interactions by green arrows.

complexed with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor. Upon cell stimulation, the three phox proteins are en bloc recruited to the membrane; on the other hand, Rac translocates independently but without Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, which remains in the cytoplasm. Although activation of gp91phox/Nox2 complexed with p22phox in cells absolutely requires p47phox, p67phox and Rac as cytosolic regulators, p47phox is dispensable for cell-free activation in the presence of excess amounts of p67phox and Rac [99,100]. It is thus considered that p47phox functions as an organizer, whereas p67phox serves as an activator that directly participates in gp91phox/Nox2 activation.

Nox1 is abundantly expressed in colon epithelial cells and also in vascular smooth muscle cells [101,102], and seems to be involved in angiotensin II-mediated hypertension [103–105]. Nox1, as well as Nox2, forms a complex with p22phox [88,106]. Although Nox1 is also inactive without an organizer or an activator, it generates superoxide in the presence of the p47phox paralog Noxo1 (Nox organizer 1) and the p67phox paralog Noxa1 (Nox activator 1) [106–109] (Fig. 7B). Rac is directly involved in Nox1 activation as well [110–112].

In the inner ear of mice, Nox3 plays a crucial role in formation of otoconia, tiny mineralized structures that are required for perception of balance and gravity [113]. Although Nox3 also forms a functional heterodimer with p22phox, this oxidase is capable of producing superoxide in the absence of an organizer or an activator.

cooperation with other agonists such as arachidonic acid, induces unmasking of the SH3 domains [136]; as a result, the bis-SH3 domain interacts with the PRR of p22<sup>phox</sup> [125–127]. The SH3-mediated interaction with p22<sup>phox</sup> also participates in p47<sup>phox</sup>-dependent enhancement of Nox3 activation [88].

The domain architecture of p47<sup>phox</sup> (PX, bis-SH3, AIR, and a p67<sup>phox</sup>-binding PRR) is conserved from fishes to mammals (Fig. 10). In addition, the genome of the amphioxus *B. floridae*, which belongs to the subphylum Cephalochordata, a basal group of the Chordata [96], contains the gene for p47<sup>phox</sup> (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/euk_home.html), in which protein the whole domain structure is duplicated (Fig. 10). The presence of the p47<sup>phox</sup> gene in the Cephalochordata indicates that it emerged early in chordate evolution. On the other hand, a typical p47<sup>phox</sup> is absent in the ascidian *Ci. intestinalis* of the Urochordata, suggesting that the p47<sup>phox</sup> gene has been lost in the ascidian lineage. This organism contains a typical p22<sup>phox</sup> carrying the conserved PRR [97], which may imply the presence of its interacting protein. Although *Ci. intestinalis* has been reported to possess a protein harboring a PX domain and three SH3 domains, but lacks an AIR and a PRR [97] (Fig. 10), there is no experimental evidence showing that this protein participates in oxidase activation. The residues in the AIR that strongly interact with the SH3 domains are all conserved in chordate p47<sup>phox</sup> proteins (Fig. 11): in human p47<sup>phox</sup>, the Pro-Pro-Arg sequence at the AIR N-terminus adopts a PPII helix conformation, which is lined in the groove formed between the tandem SH3 domains. Among these residues, Pro199 and Pro200 undergo hydrophobic interactions as addition to forming hydrogen bonds via their backbone carbonyl groups; Arg201 contacts Asp243 and Glu244 via electrostatic interactions. In addition, Ser303 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu241 (Fig. 11). The PPRRS region, however, is not sufficient to make the SH3 domains inaccessible to p22<sup>phox</sup> [131]; its C-terminal extension is required for efficient masking of the SH3 domains [131]. Besides Ser303, Ser310 and Ser328 form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Glu211 and Arg267, respectively (Fig. 11). It is known that phosphorylation of Ser303 and Ser328 plays a crucial role in disruption of the intramolecular interaction to activate the bis-SH3 domain [131,136]. In the p47<sup>phox</sup> autoinhibited structure, furthermore, Arg318 undergoes an electrostatic interaction with Asp261 [132], whereas Ile305 is located in a hydrophobic pocket of SH3(N), and Tyr324 probably points into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the linker region and SH3(C) (Fig. 11). Intriguingly, the amino acids of the AIR and

In the resting state, the two SH3 domains of p47<sup>phox</sup> are inaccessible to the target protein, as they are masked via an intramolecular interaction with the C-terminally flanking region called the autoinhibitory region (AIR) [125,131–133] (Fig. 7). During phagocytosis of invading microbes or with soluble stimuli such as N-formyl chemotactic peptide and PMA, p47<sup>phox</sup> undergoes phosphorylation at multiple Ser residues, several of which are present in the AIR [134,135].

Amino acid sequences of p22<sup>phox</sup>, p47<sup>phox</sup>, p67<sup>phox</sup> and p40<sup>phox</sup> in the Cephalochordata B. floridae are shown in supplementary Fig. S1.

SH3 domains, which are involved in the intramolecular interaction as described above, are invariant among vertebrate and amphioxus p47<sup>phox</sup>: the exceptions are that Ser328 is replaced by Thr in Branchiostoma and that Glu241 is replaced by Gln in the puffer fish Takifugu rubripes and by Ile in amphioxus. Thus, autoinhibition of the p47<sup>phox</sup> SH3 domains and phosphorylation-mediated regulation are probably conserved in p47<sup>phox</sup> of chordates.

It was recently proposed that the p47<sup>phox</sup> paralog Noxo1 in the medaka fish Oryzias latipes retains an AIR [94]. However, it seems unlikely that this region is functional, as fewer than a half of the crucial residues described above are conserved in this fish Noxo1. In addition, an AIR is absent in Noxo1 of the zebrafish Danio rerio, which belongs to a more basal group than medaka in the teleost fish [137], suggesting that the AIR was lost at an early stage after branching from the p47<sup>phox</sup> gene.

The homology between the N-termini of p47<sup>phox</sup> and p40<sup>phox</sup> was recognized when the p40<sup>phox</sup> cDNA was cloned [138]. It was subsequently pointed out that p47<sup>phox</sup> exhibits a similarity to a region of the yeast polarity protein Bem1 [139]. This module of about 120 amino acids was later found to exist in a variety of proteins [140,141], and was named the PX domain [140].

The PX domain of p47<sup>phox</sup> is capable of binding to phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>], albeit with a relatively low affinity and specificity [142,143]. In neutrophils, PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is predominantly formed from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a product of type I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), which is activated upon cell stimulation. The binding requires Arg43 and Lys90 in human p47<sup>phox</sup> [144–146] (Fig. 12). Intriguingly, in contrast to the complete conservation of Lys90, Arg43 is replaced by Lys in the mouse and by Thr in the puffer fish [147]. In contrast, the neighboring residue Arg42 is well conserved; this residue is required for stability of p47<sup>phox</sup> [12] but is not directly involved in binding to phosphoinositides [145]. Like the p22<sup>phox</sup>-interacting activity of the SH3 domains, the lipid-binding activity of the PX domain is negatively regulated under resting conditions [144,145]. The phosphorylation-induced conformational change of p47<sup>phox</sup> also renders the PX domain accessible to membrane phosphoinositides. This interaction, in cooperation with the binding to p22<sup>phox</sup>, allows p47<sup>phox</sup> to be targeted to flavocytochrome b<sub>558</sub>, which is crucial for phagocyte oxidase activation [144]. In addition to the phosphoinositide-binding pocket, the PX domain may have a binding site for acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine.

of p47phox, except that it lacks an AIR (Fig. 10). Noxo1 probably tethers the activator Noxa1 to Nox1: Noxo1 functions via its PRR by interacting with Noxa1 and via its SH3 domains by binding to the Nox1 partner p22phox [106,110,111,149]. In cells expressing Noxo1 and Noxa1, Nox1 generates superoxide without stimulants such as PMA, a potent in vivo activator of gp91phox/Nox2, although the superoxide production is further enhanced by PMA [106]. The constitutive activity of Nox1 appears to be at least partially due to the absence of AIR in Noxo1; hence its SH3 domains are accessible to p22phox even in the resting state, in contrast to the p47phox SH3 domains [106,115]. Regulation of the Noxo1 SH3 domains may be more complicated than previously expected, as they appear to interact intramolecularly with the N-terminal PRR, albeit with low affinity [149]. It is likely that the bis-SH3 domain is partly accessible to the p22phox PRR, and this intermolecular binding is facilitated by disruption of the intramolecular interaction with the p47phox PRR [149].

(Fig. 12), which facilitates membrane binding of the PX domain [145,148]. Another lipid-binding activity may explain well why the p47phox PX domain participates in membrane translocation even in the absence of the PI3K pathway products such as PtdIns(3,4)P₂ [144]. The two residues Lys55 and Arg70 in the proposed second binding site (Fig. 12) are well conserved in chordates, suggesting a role in oxidase activation.

Noxo1, the organizer for Nox1 activation

Noxo1 plays an essential role in Nox1 activation. This organizer exhibits a domain architecture similar to that

The PX domain of Noxo1 exhibits a phosphoinositide-binding activity, which is also crucial for activation of Nox1 [109,150,151]. In addition to its essential role in Nox1 activation, Noxo1 is capable of enhancing Nox3-catalyzed superoxide production [88,110,114,115,152]; the enhancement requires the PX domain [150] and the SH3-mediated interaction with p22phox [88,157].

a manner dependent on p47<sup>phox</sup>. p67<sup>phox</sup> contains two SH3 domains (Fig. 7A), both of which play a role in activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase [153]. Although the N-terminal (the first) SH3 domain is the most conserved region in p67<sup>phox</sup> [154], it is unknown how this module functions. The C-terminal SH3 domain participates in membrane translocation of p67<sup>phox</sup> by specifically binding to the C-terminal PRR of p47<sup>phox</sup> with high affinity [155–157]. The high affinity and specificity are achieved by the following mechanism: in addition to the canonical PxxP binding site of p67-SH3(C), which is occupied by the eight PRR residues of p47<sup>phox</sup> (Gln362–Pro369), which adopt a PPII helix conformation (Fig. 13), p67-SH3(C) makes direct contacts with the remaining C-terminal segment of the p47<sup>phox</sup> tail, which comprises two α-helices (Asp372–Asn376 and Glu380–Ser386), linked by a turn of Arg377–Ser379 [157] (Fig. 13). Structural analysis and comparison of p47<sup>phox</sup> proteins from various species reveal the consensus sequence xPxøPxRP(S/A)xxøIL-xRC(S/T)xxT(K/R)(R/K)xØ, where x is any amino acid and Ø is a hydrophobic residue (Fig. 13). The residue adjacent to the invariant Cys is a Ser or a Thr;

the corresponding residue in human p47<sup>phox</sup> (Ser379) is known to undergo phosphorylation during cell stimulation [158]. This phosphorylation attenuates the binding to p67<sup>phox</sup> [158], and thus negatively regulates oxidase activation [159].

The consensus sequence is also conserved in the C-terminal region of Noxo1, which is capable of interacting with p67<sup>phox</sup> as well as with Noxa1 [106]. The interaction of the Noxa1 SH3 domain with the Noxo1 PPR (Fig. 7B) plays an important role in both membrane localization of Noxa1 and activation of Nox1 [110,111].

## Interaction of Rac with p67<sup>phox</sup>

Rac, a member of the Rho-family small GTPases, plays an essential role in gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 activation [160–162]. Among phagocytes, human neutrophils predominantly express Rac2, whereas both Rac1 and Rac2 are present in monocytes/macrophages. A patient with abnormal neutrophil function was shown to have an inhibitory (dominant-negative) mutation in Rac2, resulting in decreased oxidase activity and other neutrophil function defects [163,164]. Upon cell stimulation, Rac is recruited to the membrane independently of p47<sup>phox</sup> or p67<sup>phox</sup>. The recruitment requires geranylgeranylation of Cys189 at the C-terminus. At the membrane, Rac is converted to the GTP-bound active form via the function of guanine nucleotide-releasing factors. Rac in the GTP-bound form directly interacts with the p67<sup>phox</sup> N-terminal region of about 200 amino acids, which is crucial for activation of gp91<sup>phox</sup> [165,166]. On the other hand, Cdc42 neither binds to p67<sup>phox</sup> nor activates gp91<sup>phox</sup>.

In the Rac-binding region, four tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs are found (Fig. 14): TPR motifs are degenerate 34 amino acid repeats that are present in a variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans, and are involved in a variety of protein-protein interactions [167]. The TPR domain of p67<sup>phox</sup> contains an insertion of 19 amino acids between the α-helices of TPR3 and TPR4: the insertion contains two short antiparallel β-strands and a 3<sub>10</sub> helical turn [168,169], with the consensus sequence of LRGNxøID-YxxLGøx(Y/F)KLx, where x is any amino acid and Ø is a hydrophobic residue (Fig. 14). The β-hairpin insertion and the loops connecting TPR1 and TPR2, and TPR2 and TPR3, create the binding surface for Rac [168] (Fig. 14). The invariant Arg in the β-hairpin (position 32 of TPR3; Arg102 in human p67<sup>phox</sup>) plays a key role in complex formation with Rac and oxidase activation, and the side chain of this residue undergoes direct hydrogen bonding interactions with main and

Structure, regulation and evolution of Nox

Between the Rac-binding TPR domain and the N-terminal SH3 domain, human p67<sup>phox</sup> contains a PRR region, PPPRPKTP (amino acids 227–234), which is well conserved among mammalian, avian and amphibian p67<sup>phox</sup> proteins, but not among fish p67<sup>phox</sup> [147] or mammalian Noxa1 [106]. Cell-free experiments using a series of C-terminally truncated mutants of p67<sup>phox</sup> showed that the PRR is dispensable for oxidase activation in vitro [171]. Intriguingly, these experiments also revealed that the region of amino acids 200–212, C-terminal to the Rac-binding TPR domain, plays an essential role in cell-free activation of the NADPH oxidase: a truncated p67<sup>phox</sup> of amino acids 1–212 is fully active, whereas a mutant protein of amino acids 1–199 is completely inactive [171]. These results were subsequently confirmed, and the short region (amino acids 201–210) was named the ‘activation domain’ [172]. Among amino acids in the activation domain, Ala substitution for Val204 results in an almost complete loss of gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 activation, not only under cell-free conditions [172], but also in intact cells [173]. The corresponding mutation in the p67<sup>phox</sup> homolog Noxa1, the V205A substitution, attenuates Nox1 activation [109]. Thus, both the Rac-binding TPR domain and the activation domain are probably minimal prerequisites for p67<sup>phox</sup> function.

Careful alignment of regions C-terminal to the TPR domain of various Nox activators reveals the consensus sequence of the activation domain: (V/L) xxLxxKD(Y/F)LGKAxVV(A/S)(S/A) (amino acids 190–208) (Fig. 14). Leu193 (the third residue in the consensus), Asp197, Leu199, Gly200 and Val205 (the amino acid number corresponds to that of human p67<sup>phox</sup>) are completely conserved in all Nox activator proteins, including p67<sup>phox</sup>, Noxa1, and NoxR. The ninth residue, Tyr (equivalent to Tyr198 of human p67<sup>phox</sup>), is common to p67<sup>phox</sup> proteins, but is replaced by Phe in Noxa1.

Binding of Rac is believed to induce a conformational change in p67<sup>phox</sup>, which may allow the activation domain to act on gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 [174–177]. However, it is unknown how the activation domain functions at the atomic level. The extended activation domain as proposed here (amino acids 190–208) appears to be flexible or disordered, judging from the crystal structure of an isolated p67<sup>phox</sup> TPR domain (amino acids 1–203) complexed with Rac [168], and that of a TPR domain alone (amino acids 1–213) [169]; in the latter case, the N-terminus of the activation domain is a part of an α-helix (amino acids 187–193) [169]. The activation domain in the Rac-bound p67<sup>phox</sup> might adopt a defined structure upon interaction with the gp91<sup>phox</sup>-p22<sup>phox</sup> complex. It

side chain atoms of no less than four residues from Rac [168]. Asp67 in the loop that connects TPR1 and TPR2 (position 31 of TPR2) also makes direct contacts with Rac (Fig. 14) and is completely conserved among p67<sup>phox</sup> and its related proteins such as vertebrate Noxa1 and fungal NoxR. In addition, the two residues involved in binding to Rac, Ser37 in the loop between the α-helices of TPR1 and TPR2 (position 1 of TPR2) and Asn204 in the β-hairpin (position 34 of TPR3), are highly conserved among p67<sup>phox</sup> and its related proteins (Fig. 14). In addition, substitution of Glu for the invariant Arg in human Noxa1 (Arg103) [106] and in fungal NoxR (Arg101) [170] results in a loss of binding to Rac. Thus, these proteins probably recognize Rac in the same way as p67<sup>phox</sup>.

Structure, regulation and evolution of Nox

has been also proposed that GTP-bound Rac by itself induces electron transport from NADPH by directly interacting with gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 [178]. In this case, the insert helix of Rac (amino acids 123–135), a region specific for the Rho-family GTPases, is suggested to play a crucial role [174]; however, the importance of this region remains controversial [179].

Interaction of p40<sup>phox</sup> with p67<sup>phox</sup>

p67<sup>phox</sup> contains a PB1 domain [180] between the two SH3 domains; via PB1 domain-mediated heterodimerization, p67<sup>phox</sup> stably interacts with p40<sup>phox</sup> in phagocytes (Fig. 15). Human p40<sup>phox</sup> of 339 amino acids, comprising PX, SH3 and PB1 domains, is not essential for oxidase activation. This protein, however, enhances recruitment of p67<sup>phox</sup> and p47<sup>phox</sup> to the membrane [181], especially to the phagosomal membrane, and is

therefore considered to play a crucial role in oxidase assembly at the phagosome [181–183].

The PB1 domains, comprising about 80 amino acid residues, adopt a ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold, containing two α-helices and a mixed five-stranded β-sheet [184–189]. This module is classified into groups harboring an acidic OPCA motif (also known as a PC motif) (type I), the invariant Lys residue on the first β-strand (type II), or both (type I/II) [180]. Heterodimeric assembly occurs between type I and II PB1 domains [180]. The dimerization involves specific electrostatic interactions involving a conserved acidic Dx(D/E)GD region of the OPCA motif from a type I PB1 domain and an invariant Lys residue from a type II PB1 domain. The type II PB1 domain in human p67<sup>phox</sup> contains Lys355 on the β1-strand, which directly participates in binding to p40<sup>phox</sup>, membrane targeting of p67<sup>phox</sup>, and oxidase activation [181]. The crystal structures of the p67<sup>phox</sup>-PB1 and p40<sup>phox</sup>-PB1 complexes [187] demonstrate that Lys355 of p67<sup>phox</sup> forms direct bonds with Asp289, Glu291 and Asp293 in the DxEGD sequence of the OPCA motif, which is presented on the PB1 domain (type I) of human p40<sup>phox</sup> (Fig. 15); this is also consistent with the findings that a mutant p40<sup>phox</sup> with the D289A substitution neither enhances p67<sup>phox</sup> translocation nor supports superoxide production at the phagosome [181, 182]. Importantly, it is evident from the crystal structure that even a basic residue such as Arg is incapable of replacing Lys355. Besides the first electrostatic interaction, a contact of Lys382 (of the p67<sup>phox</sup> PB1 domain) with Asp302 (of the p40<sup>phox</sup> OPCA motif) also contributes to p67<sup>phox</sup> binding to p40<sup>phox</sup>, but to a much lesser extent (Fig. 15) [190]. Furthermore, Thr361 and Trp425 of p67<sup>phox</sup> and Arg296 of p40<sup>phox</sup> also make intramolecular contacts, enhancing the interaction between p67<sup>phox</sup> and p40<sup>phox</sup> [187]. In agreement with the presence of the PB1 (type II)-containing p67<sup>phox</sup> in the amphioxus *B. floridae* of the Cephalochordata (Fig. 16), its genome contains the gene for p40<sup>phox</sup> of 346 amino acids, which comprises PX, SH3 and PB1 (type I) domains (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/euk_home.html). Residues that play crucial roles in PB1 heterodimerization, especially the two Lys residues in p67<sup>phox</sup> and the five OPCA residues (Asp289, Glu291, Asp293, Arg296 and Asp302 in human p40<sup>phox</sup>), are all conserved in the amphioxus proteins, indicating that the p67<sup>phox</sup>-p40<sup>phox</sup> interaction is maintained in the Chordata. In contrast, p40<sup>phox</sup> is absent in other phyla, including the sea urchin *S. purpuratus* of the Echinodermata, another phylum that belongs to the deuterostomes. Thus, p40<sup>phox</sup> appears to have emerged in the Chordata.

Translocation of p40<sup>phox</sup> to the phagosome is probably mediated via the N-terminal PX domain. This PX

In contrast to the PX and PB1 domains, the role of the SH3 domain in p40<sup>phox</sup> remains obscure, although it is capable of binding to p47<sup>phox</sup> very weakly [158,197].

# Origin of p67<sup>phox</sup>-like proteins functioning via interaction with Rac

Two major subgroups in animals are protostomes and deuterostomes, the latter of which includes the phyla Chordata and Echinodermata (Fig. 9). As described above, human p67<sup>phox</sup> comprises the Rac-binding TPR domain, the activation domain, the N-terminal SH3 domain, the PB1 domain (type II), and the C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig. 17). Such a canonical p67<sup>phox</sup> is found not only in the Vertebrata (from fishes to mammals) but also in the Cephalochordata, a basal group of the Chordata, as shown in the present search for the database of the amphioxus *B. floridae* (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/euk_home.html). Thus, the domain architecture of p67<sup>phox</sup> has arisen with the emergence of the Chordata. On the other hand, p67<sup>phox</sup> seems to be absent in the ascidian *Ci. intestinalis* of the Urochordata, a sister group of the Vertebrata, suggesting loss of the p67<sup>phox</sup> gene in this lineage. Instead, an ascidian protein that contains solely a Rac-binding TPR domain but not the other domains of p67<sup>phox</sup> (Fig. 17) has been considered as a functional p67<sup>phox</sup> homolog [97]; however, its identity as a protein that supports oxidase activation awaits functional analysis.

Noxa1, a p67<sup>phox</sup> paralog for Nox1 activation, seems to have emerged in the Vertebrata (Fig. 17), which is consistent with the appearance of Nox1 and the Nox1 organizer Noxo1 in this subphylum of the Chordata. The coincidence of the emergence of Nox1 and its regulatory proteins may be related to two rounds of whole genome duplication that occurred in early vertebrate evolution [198,199]. Noxa1 of the zebrafish *Danio rerio* almost retains the domain architecture of p67<sup>phox</sup> but harbors only a remnant of the N-terminal (the first) SH3 domain (Fig. 17). Its activation domain is of the Noxa1 type: the Tyr residue conserved in p67<sup>phox</sup> is replaced by Phe as in other Noxa1 proteins (Fig. 14). As zebrafish Noxa1 appears to contain an intact PB1 domain, it might function by interacting with p40<sup>phox</sup> [94]. On the other hand, Nox1 of the frog *Xenopus tropicalis* has an almost complete N-terminal SH3 domain and a nonfunctional PB1 domain (Fig. 17): the PB1-like region lacks crucial residues

domain is capable of specifically and strongly binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] [142,143,191], a lipid that is produced by type III PI3K and is highly enriched in the phagosomal membrane [192,193]. The PtdIns(3)P-binding activity, however, appears to be normally suppressed via an intramolecular interaction with the PB1 domain [194,195]. The high affinity and specificity for PtdIns(3)P requires the following three residues in human p40<sup>phox</sup> [196]: Arg58 undergoes extensive interactions with the 3-phosphate moiety of the bound PtdIns(3)P, NH2 and NE in the side chain of this residue forming hydrogen bonds with oxygens of the 3-phosphate; NH1 and NH2 of Arg105 form hydrogen bonds with the 4-OH and 5-OH of the inositol moiety; and the aromatic ring of Tyr59 stacks against one face of the inositol ring (the face with the axial 2-OH) (Fig. 16). In addition, Lys92 and Arg60 also contribute to binding to PtdIns(3)P but to a lesser extent (Fig. 16): these residues make hydrogen bonds with the nonbridging oxygens of the 1-phosphoryl group, although the contribution of Arg60 is much less than that of Lys92 [196]. The p40<sup>phox</sup> residues involved in binding to PtdIns(3)P, except Arg60, are completely conserved from amphioxus (http://genome.jgi/psf.org/

such as the irreplaceable Lys (corresponding to Lys355 in human p67<sup>phox</sup>), indicating that amphibian Noxa1 is not expected to bind to p40<sup>phox</sup>. Human Noxa1 does not contain an N-terminal SH3 domain but has a PB1 domain-like region that lacks the invariant Lys: indeed, human Noxa1 fails to interact with p40<sup>phox</sup> [106]. In addition, it was reported that the irreplaceable Lys is substituted with Arg in Noxa1 of the chicken *Gallus gallus* [94], and the present analysis has revealed that no identifiable PB1 domain is found in avian (chicken) Noxa1 (Fig. 17); these findings indicate that p40<sup>phox</sup> does not participate in activating Nox1 in the chicken. Similar to the tail-to-tail interaction between p67<sup>phox</sup> and p47<sup>phox</sup>, Noxa1 is capable of binding to Noxo1 via its C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig. 7B), which plays a crucial role in formation of the active Nox1 complex [110–112,200].

A protein homologous to p67<sup>phox</sup> exists in the sea urchin *S. purpuratus*, a member of the Echinodermata (Genebank accession number XP_781983) (Fig. 17). This protein contains two sets of the p67<sup>phox</sup> core cassette, comprising the Rac-binding TPR domain and activation domain (Fig. 17): the sequences of the Rac-binding insert region and the activation domain are almost completely fitted to the consensus ones (Fig. 14). The echinodermal p67<sup>phox</sup> harbors an SH3 domain at the C-terminus, like vertebrate homologs, but lacks a p40<sup>phox</sup>-binding PB1 domain, which seems

to be consistent with the absence of p40<sup>phox</sup> in this species. In animals, a p67<sup>phox</sup>-like protein is present also in the limpet *Lot. gigantea* of the Mollusca, a member of the protostomes [94]. This protein contains a Rac-binding TPR domain and an activation domain, but not other known modular domains or motifs (Fig. 17). Although the two species *S. purpuratus* and *Lot. gigantea* do not seem to have a recognizable p47<sup>phox</sup> homolog, the echinodermal and molluscan p67<sup>phox</sup>-homologous proteins might participate in oxidase activation without cooperating with p47<sup>phox</sup>. It is known that p47<sup>phox</sup> is dispensable for gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2 activation in the presence of large excess amounts of p67<sup>phox</sup> and Rac in a cell-free system [99,100], and that, even in a whole cell system, p67<sup>phox</sup> functions in activation of Nox3 (but not gp91<sup>phox</sup>/Nox2) in a manner independent of p47<sup>phox</sup>: p67<sup>phox</sup> is capable of activating Nox3 in cells lacking p47<sup>phox</sup> [88,115] and also in cells expressing a mutant p22<sup>phox</sup> that is defective in binding to p47<sup>phox</sup> [88].

The fungi, a major group of the eukaryotic supergroup Opisthokonta, have three Nox-family members: NoxA and NoxB are close to animal Nox2; and NoxC has an N-terminal cytoplasmic extension containing a single EF-hand motif [56,57,59]. The fungal oxidases are involved in a variety of biological events such as development of sexual fruiting bodies and ascospore germination [59,201], and symbiotic interactions such

as that between the clavicipitaceous fungal endophyte *Epichloë festucae* and its grass host *Lolium perenne* [202].

It has recently been shown that a p67<sup>phox</sup>-like oxidase activator, named NoxR (Nox regulator), exists in fungi possessing the NoxA gene [57,170], whereas p47<sup>phox</sup> or p22<sup>phox</sup> appears to be absent in fungi or so divergent that it has escaped identification. NoxR contains a typical core cassette of p67<sup>phox</sup>, comprising a Rac-binding TPR domain and an activation domain, suggestive of its role in Nox activation (Fig. 17). Indeed, NoxR in *Ep.* *festucae* is involved in ROS production by NoxA; a *noxR* deletion mutant confers a defect in fungus–grass mutualistic symbiosis, which is similar to that observed for a *noxA* mutant; and the phenotype in the *noxR* deletion mutant is complemented by expression of the wild-type NoxR, but not by a mutant NoxR carrying the R101E substitution, indicative of the crucial role of Rac [170]. In addition, NoxR harbors a PB1 domain of type II [170,180]; a fungal protein carrying a type I PB1 domain might be involved in oxidase activation, although a p40<sup>phox</sup>-like protein is not found in fungi. Thus, a Rac-interacting Nox activator appears to have evolved in the supergroup Opisthokonta and possibly also in the supergroup Amoebozoa, as described below.

The social amoeba *Di. discoideum*, which belongs to the Amoebozoa, is known to have three Nox enzymes [55]. Two of them lack an EF-hand and are close to fungal NoxA and NoxB [55,57], which may imply the presence of a Nox activator. The *Dictyostelium* genome contains a gene encoding a protein similar to p67<sup>phox</sup>, but not one homologous to p47<sup>phox</sup>, p40<sup>phox</sup>, or p22<sup>phox</sup> [55]. The p67<sup>phox</sup>-like protein contains four TPR motifs, a type II PB1 domain, and a WW domain (Fig. 17), and is expected to bind to Rac, because amino acids that participate in the interaction with this GTPase (Fig. 14) are well conserved in the TPR domain, including Arg101, which is equivalent to Arg102 of human p67<sup>phox</sup>. However, the *Dictyostelium* protein does not harbor an identifiable activation domain. Future studies should be addressed to determine whether this protein indeed serves as an oxidase activator.

**Another mechanism whereby Rac activates Nox: direct binding of Rac to Rboh**

molecules is largely unknown at present. In particular, there is no information at the atomic level about how electron transfer is induced by interaction of Nox with regulatory proteins such as a $p67^{phox}$-related protein and Rac. Studies of the crystal structures of full-length Nox proteins and their complexes will help immensely to extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern oxidase activation.

The Nox family exists in a wide variety of eukaryotes (Fig. 3), but oxidases from only a limited number of species have been experimentally investigated. As shown in Fig. 1, members of the Nox family contain a pair of His residues in the third transmembrane $\alpha$-helix with 13 intervening amino acids (His101 and His115 in human gp91${}^{phox}$/Nox2), with the other pair in the fifth helix (His209 and His222 in human gp91${}^{phox}$/Nox2) being separated by 12 amino acids. However, proposed Nox members in the red algae *Cyanidioschyzon merolae*, *Cyanidioschyzon crispus*, and *Porphyra yezoensis*, which belong to the eukaryotic supergroup Plantae [58,98], contain 13 intervening amino acids between His residues in both the third and the fifth transmembrane segments, like the fungal Fre family (Fig. 1). It thus seems interesting to test whether these oxidases (called NoxD) indeed reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide, or instead use Fe${}^{3+}$ as a substrate. In addition, it was reported that flavocytochromes, carrying 14 and 13 intervening amino acids, are present in the diatom *Phaeodactylum tricornutum* (supergroup Chromalveolata), although typical Nox enzymes (with 13 and 12 intervening amino acids) exist in another diatom, *Tha. pseudonana* [58]. Biochemical studies of Nox enzymes derived from various eukaryotes are now required to establish their identities as real Nox enzymes or other distinct oxidoreductases and to clarify their regulatory mechanisms.

$p22^{phox}$, the membrane partner of the Nox1–4 subfamily, is present in various animals and in the choanoflagellate *Mo. brevicollis*, and retains a conserved PRR in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region (Figs 8 and 9). On the other hand, p47${}^{phox}$ or Noxo1, a protein that specifically binds via its bis-SH3 domain to the PRR of p22${}^{phox}$, is found solely in an animal group of the Chordata (Figs 9 and 10). Although it was proposed that proteins with single PX domain and multiple SH3 domains might function as p47${}^{phox}$ [94,97], experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis has not yet been provided. Identification of a novel p22${}^{phox}$-binding protein will improve our understanding of regulation of the Nox1–4 subfamily enzymes.

In contrast to the finding that the presence of p47${}^{phox}$ or its homolog is restricted to the Chordata, proteins homologous to p67${}^{phox}$ exist in a variety of

eukaryotes (Figs 9 and 17). However, a role in Nox activation has been shown for only three types of p67${}^{phox}$ homolog: p67${}^{phox}$ and Noxa1 in mammals, and NoxR in fungi. Thus, it is worth testing whether proteins carrying a Rac-binding TPR domain but not an activation domain, like those found in the ascidian *Ci. intestinalis* and the social amoeba *Di. discoideum* (Fig. 17), are indeed involved in Nox regulation. It would be also interesting to know how a p67${}^{phox}$-like protein of the mollusc *Lot. gigantea* functions; this protein contains both the Rac-binding TPR domain and the activation domain, but lacks other known modular interaction domains (Fig. 17).

As discussed in the present review, it remains unknown whether the EF-hand-containing Nox subfamilies are descended from a single ancestor oxidase that initially obtained EF-hand motifs. It seems more likely that an EF-hand motif has been obtained independently several times during evolution. Nox2, but not Nox5 or Duox, has been found in the Choanoflagellata (a sister group of animals) and Cnidaria (a basal group of animals), whereas these three oxidases are widely distributed in protostomes and deuterostomes (Fig. 3), suggesting that Nox5 and Duox, containing four and two EF-hands, respectively, diverged after the emergence of a p22${}^{phox}$-binding Nox2-like oxidase in animal evolution. Similarly, in fungi, the NoxC subfamily containing a single EF-hand is found solely in more evolved groups, such as the Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes, whereas the Nox2-like EF-hand-free subfamilies NoxA and NoxB are present also in relatively basal groups such as the Chytridiomyceta and Basidiomycota [57], suggesting that the NoxC subfamily has emerged at a later stage of fungal evolution. Thus, the classification of the Nox family in eukaryotes into the two major groups, depending on the presence or absence of the EF-hand motif, does not seem to reflect molecular evolution. Although many studies using phylogenetic trees of the Nox family have been performed, it should be noted that this approach is sometimes misleading, e.g. due to ‘long branch attraction’, when distantly related genes derived from a wide variety of species are used [54,205–207]. Further increases in genomic data for various eukaryotes will help to clarify the origins of Nox subfamilies.

The function of EF-hands is variable between Nox subfamilies, which may be in agreement with their sequence diversity [98]. The EF-hands of the animal enzyme Nox5, in the Ca${}^{2+}$-bound state, appear to interact with the Nox superdomain, leading to superoxide production [66]. In the resting state of Duox, another EF-hand-containing Nox in animals, the EF-hands may exert an inhibitory effect by normally

associating with the Nox superdomain; for Duox activation, the association is probably disrupted by binding of Ca²⁺ to the EF-hands [65]. In plants, the EF-hands of Rboh localize within the Rac-binding region at the N-terminus, and binding of Ca²⁺ to the EF-hands prevents Rac from binding to the N-terminal region, resulting in inactivation of this oxidase [76]. Structural studies of EF-hands complexed with a Nox superdomain or Rac will help to extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern oxidase regulation.
