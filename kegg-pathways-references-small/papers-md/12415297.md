THE MOLECULAR ORGANIZATION  
OF CEREBELLAR LONG-TERM  
DEPRESSION  

**Masao Ito**

Synaptic plasticity is an important cellular mechanism for the formation of memory in neuronal circuits of the brain. Research during the past two decades has revealed surprisingly complex signal-transduction processes that underlie various forms of synaptic plasticity. More than 30 molecules are involved in the induction of long-term depression (LTD) — a unique form of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum. Here, I review recent data on these molecules, defining their roles as mediators or modulators, coincidence detectors or components of a self-regenerating circuit, and show how they are organized to form an efficient molecular machinery for LTD induction.

Among the various types of synaptic plasticity that have been described, long-term depression (LTD) in PURKINJE CELLS of the cerebellar cortex is unique. Since its discovery two decades ago, LTD has been investigated extensively¹⁻³. Each Purkinje cell receives numerous (approximately 175,000 in rat) small synapses from PARALLEL FIBRES (PFs) onto the tops of tiny extrusions from its dendrites (spines)⁴, and a single CLIMBING FIBRE (CF) forms many (up to 26,000 in rat)⁵ synaptic contacts with atypical stubby spines on Purkinje cell dendrites (FIG. 1). CFs are unique to the cerebellum — they are not found elsewhere in the central nervous system. If a sufficiently large bundle of PFs is activated repeatedly, a sustained depression of synaptic transmission from this bundle to Purkinje cells is induced⁶. However, activation of a PF bundle of a moderate size produces no such depression unless the CF that innervates a Purkinje cell is concurrently activated. This article focuses on LTD induced by PF–CF pairing and its reduced forms.

LTD is induced by coincidence of an event that follows impulses in PFs and another that follows those in CFs. Various reduced forms of LTD can be induced by introducing intermediate stages of these events — not necessarily by stimulating CFs and PFs (for example, by combining membrane depolarization and glutamate application)⁷. Although the complexity of the events that follow PF and CF impulses is becoming increasingly clear, the organization of the molecular machinery for the induction of LTD remains obscure.

To establish a functionally meaningful organization of numerous molecules, one strategy is to identify the mediators and modulators of LTD induction. This approach was proposed by Sanes and Lichtman⁸ as a general strategy for studies of synaptic plasticity. Mediators are receptors, channels, enzymes or second messengers that convey signals that are indispensable for the induction of LTD, whereas modulators are those that regulate the functions of the mediators. Modulators will also be indispensable for LTD induction when a mediator requires them for its upregulation, but the same modulators will not be required when the mediator is already sufficiently upregulated. Another strategy is to identify the coincidence-detector mechanism by which multiple signals that coincide within a short time window induce a supralinear effect (one that exceeds their linear sum). Berridge⁹ adopted this approach as the basis of research on synaptic plasticity — there must be a molecule(s) acting as a coincidence detector in the events that follow PF and CF stimulation that triggers LTD induction. A third strategy is to dissect out certain signal-transduction pathways that contribute to characteristic features of LTD, such as the threshold phenomenon or frequency dependence. This strategy, which was

PURKINJE CELLS  
Inhibitory neurons in the  
cerebellum that use GABA as  
their neurotransmitter. Their  
cell bodies are situated beneath  
the molecular layer, and their  
dendrites branch extensively in  
this layer. Their axons project  
into the underlying white matter,  
and they provide the only output  
from the cerebellar cortex.

PARALLEL FIBRES  
Parallel fibres are branches of  
the ascending axons of  
cerebellar granule cells. In the  
molecular layer of the cerebellar  
cortex, they run perpendicular  
to the planar Purkinje cell  
dendrites, with which they form  
so-called en passant synapses.

unless a poststimulus time histogram is constructed for  
many repeated trials¹⁸. Second, as a single CF impulse  
depolarizes a Purkinje cell dendrite for more than 1 s  
(REF. 19), it is difficult to see how this signal could form  
the basis of a precise time-locked event.  

In contrast to the well-timed triphasic tuning that is  
found between the two sets of inputs that induce long-  
term potentiation (LTP) and LTD in hippocampal  
neurons²⁰, the time window for coincidence detection in  
the induction of cerebellar LTD seems to be broad —  
in the order of hundreds of milliseconds. This broad  
tuning must be based on interactions between certain  
prolonged chemical processes that occur after PF and  
CF stimulation. Various chemical processes have been  
found to occur postsynaptically. Although some pre-  
synaptic events have been implicated in the plasticity of  
PF synapses under certain experimental conditions²¹,²²,  
I focus here on the postsynaptic signal-transduction  
events that account for LTD that is induced by the  
conjunctive stimulation of CFs and PFs.  

**PF-evoked signal transduction**  
FIGURE 2 illustrates the complex signal-transduction  
processes that are known to be induced by CF and PF  
impulses²,³. When they are stimulated, PFs release  
glutamate as well as nitric oxide (NO)²³. The released  
glutamate activates AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-  
5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)-type glutamate  
receptors (**AMPARs**), δ2 receptors and type 1 metabotropic  
glutamate receptors (**mGluR1s**) in the subsynaptic  
membrane of Purkinje cells. Activation of AMPARs  
opens the associated cation channels, allowing the  
entry of Na⁺ ions into the Purkinje cell. This Na⁺ cur-  
rent produces fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials  
(EPSPs), which can open voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels  
(**VGCCs**) if they are sufficiently large⁶,²⁴. Even though  
AMPARs are typical **ionotropic** receptors, they are also  
associated with a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) called  
**Lyn**²⁵. Lyn might be related to the PTK that is required  
for the induction of LTD in association with protein  
kinase C (**PKC**)²⁶.  

The signal-transduction processes that follow the  
activation of δ2 receptors are still unclear, except that  
δ2 receptors are associated with a tyrosine phosphatase²⁷.  
More is known about the signalling that follows the acti-  
vation of mGluR1s. The activation of this receptor is  
linked to the generation of slow EPSPs, which are associ-  
ated with the entry of Na⁺ ions into the cell²⁸. mGluR1 is  
also linked to the activation of phospholipase C (**PLC**)  
isoforms β2 and β4) through Gq proteins²⁹⁻³¹, resulting  
in the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-  
1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P₃). DAG in turn activates  
PKC, whereas Ins(1,4,5)P₃ causes the release of Ca²⁺ ions  
from intracellular stores³². In addition, mGluR1 activa-  
tion is linked to the activation of phospholipase A₂  
(**PLA₂**) through another type of G protein, which results  
in the production of arachidonic and oleic acids from  
membrane phospholipids.  

NO released from PFs diffuses into Purkinje cells and  
activates cytosolic guanylyl cyclase, which results in the  
production of cyclic GMP. In turn, cGMP activates  

**CLIMBING FIBRES**  
Cerebellar afferents that arise  
from the inferior olivary  
nucleus, each of which forms  
multiple synapses with a single  
Purkinje cell.  

**δ2 RECEPTOR**  
A subtype of glutamate receptor  
that is expressed selectively in  
Purkinje cells. δ2 receptors do  
not form functional glutamate-  
gated ion channels.  

**METABOTROPIC**  
A term that describes a receptor  
that is associated with G proteins  
and exerts its effects through  
enzyme activation.  

**IONOTROPIC**  
A term that describes a receptor  
that is associated with ion  
channels and generates electrical  
membrane currents.  

**Time window for CF-PF coincidence**  
A common protocol for inducing LTD is the simultaneous  
stimulation of PFs and CFs 100–600 times at a fre-  
quency of 1–4 Hz (REFS 12–14). When stimulation of the  
PF follows the paired CF stimulus with a delay of up to  
750 ms, LTD induction is maintained, although it  
is attenuated¹⁴. When the PF stimulation precedes  
the paired CF stimulation, LTD induction decreases  
gradually as the delay increases from 0 ms to –100 ms.  
However, when repetitive stimulation is used, the rela-  
tionship between CF and PF stimulation becomes com-  
plex, because each PF stimulus is related not only to its  
paired CF stimulus, but also to those that occur within  
the preceding or succeeding 0.25–1 s. This makes the  
interpretation of results difficult, but there is no evi-  
dence to suggest that a very short time window exists for  
the induction of LTD by PF-CF pairing.  

Another protocol that can be used to induce cerebel-  
lar LTD is to apply a train of pulses to PFs in conjunc-  
tion with one to three pulses to the CFs. LTD is induced  
effectively even when the PF pulses precede the CF  
pulses by up to 200 ms (REFS 15–17). Two further observa-  
tions support the view that sharp tuning of the timing  
of PFs and CFs is not required for LTD to be induced.  
First, CFs discharge at a low, irregular rate of about 1 Hz,  
and the timing of CF responses to natural stimuli varies  
from trial to trial. The precise timing of CF-PF  
responses to natural stimuli cannot be determined  

AMPAR-mediated Ca²⁺ influx leads to the production of Ins(1,4,5)P₃ (REF.37).

CFs also contain two types of peptide — corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)³⁸ and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)³⁹ — which also seem to be released in response to stimulation. Purkinje cells carry receptors for both peptides — CRF type 1 receptor (CRFR1) and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). Activation of CRFR1 leads to the translocation of PKC to the cell membrane⁴⁰, whereas IGF1R activation stimulates DAG production⁴¹, which in turn activates PKC. Because the partial peptides **dynamitin** and **amphiphysin**, which interfere with endocytosis, block the induction of LTD by IGF1, it is thought that IGF1 contributes to the induction of LTD by facilitating endocytosis⁴². In the absence of sufficient information, it is assumed that the CF-initiated activation of AMPARs and mGluR1s induces signal-transduction events similar to those elicited by the PF-initiated activation of these receptors, as discussed above (FIG.2).

### Which elements are modulators?

To identify modulators and mediators in the signal-transduction pathways of LTD, the schematic shown in FIG.2 has been simplified to that shown in FIG.3. As inhibition or genetic knockout of any of the three types of receptor that are associated with PFs (AMPARs⁴³, δ2 receptors⁴⁴ and mGluR1s⁴⁵⁻⁴⁷) blocks the induction of LTD in cerebellar slices, as do the depletion of PF-released NO⁴⁸ or the inhibition of guanylyl cyclase (which is activated by NO)⁴⁹, the activation of these receptors and enzymes seems to be indispensable for LTD induction in cerebellar slices. However, the reduced form of LTD that can be induced in cultured Purkinje cells by the application of glutamate combined with membrane depolarization does not require NO⁵⁰. These findings indicate that the NO–cGMP pathway is a modulator that facilitates LTD induction by the pairing of CF and PF stimulation in cerebellar slices, and that this pathway is not required for depolarization-glutamate-pairing-induced LTD in cultured Purkinje cells. I prefer this interpretation to the idea that there are entirely different LTD-inducing mechanisms in cerebellar slices and cultured cells. This is because signal transduction in various forms of LTD seems to converge on the same process — the phosphorylation of AMPARs at PF synapses and the removal of these receptors by endocytosis — regardless of where in the pathway it begins (see below). NO is a candidate molecule that mediates the spread of LTD from the spines that are involved in conjunctive stimulation to adjacent spines⁵¹,⁵². So, NO could be reviewed as a modulator that facilitates mediators that might be only marginally activated in adjacent spines.

To induce LTD in cerebellar slices, the activation of mGluR1s⁴⁵⁻⁴⁷, CRFR1s⁴⁰ and IGF1Rs⁴¹ at CF synapses is crucial. Inhibition or genetic ablation of any of these receptors blocks the induction of LTD. However, CF stimulation can be replaced in LTD induction by membrane depolarization that evokes Ca²⁺ spikes in a Purkinje cell⁵³. So, processes other than the entry of Ca²⁺

### RAS-RAF PATHWAY

Ras proteins are a group of small GTPases involved in growth, differentiation and cellular signalling that require the binding of GTP to enter into their active state. Raf is a serine/threonine kinase that is also implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. After its activation by Ras, Raf activates MEK and triggers the MAPK cascade.

### CF-induced signal transduction

An impulse in a CF causes the release of a transmitter — probably glutamate — which activates AMPARs at many synapses along the dendrites of a Purkinje cell, and thereby induces a large EPSP. This potential leads to the opening of VGCCs and induces Ca²⁺ spikes³⁶. It has recently been shown that CF-initiated

### protein kinase G (PKG)

A protein substrate of PKG called **G-substrate** is expressed specifically in Purkinje cells³³. When phosphorylated by PKG, G-substrate becomes a potential inhibitor of protein phosphatases — more potently for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) than for PP1 (REF.34). It is possible that NO also activates the RAS-RAF PATHWAY, eventually activating MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (MAPK) through MAPK kinase (MEK)³⁵.

of CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione), which is an AMPAR antagonist⁴³. Activation of AMPARs is required for a reduced form of LTD that is induced by PF stimulation at a frequency of 1 Hz in the presence of a protein phosphatase inhibitor⁵⁵. This form of LTD is interrupted by the addition of an AMPAR antagonist, and is not influenced by the inhibition of either mGluR1s or PKC (T. Launey *et al.*, unpublished data). Moreover, in some studies, LTD is still induced after mGluR1s have been blocked by antagonists⁵⁶.

So, PF-activated AMPARs might be a mediator of LTD induction. It can be assumed that the activation of AMPARs by a PF transmitter — glutamate — produces along-lasting change in AMPARs, such as a conformational change that is known to occur in AMPARs that are desensitized by prolonged exposure to agonists⁵⁷, which would make them sufficiently sensitive to a CF-triggered phosphorylation cascade for LTD induction (see below). Nevertheless, VGCCs (which are activated during AMPAR-mediated fast EPSPs) and Lyn (which is activated in association with AMPARs²⁵) should also be considered as candidate mediators that are associated with PF AMPARs, as shown in FIG. 3.

However, it is unlikely that PF AMPARs act exclusively as a mediator, because the agonist-evoked activation of mGluR1s in conjunction with membrane depolarization induces a reduced form of LTD⁴³, even in the presence of an AMPAR inhibitor. It is likely that AMPARs and mGluR1s act as alternative mediators. This would be possible if the activation of either AMPARs or mGluR1s leads to a process that is a common mediator of LTD induction. There are three candidates for this common mediator, as shown in red in FIG. 3. First, PF-AMPAR-mediated EPSPs will activate VGCCs to induce Ca²⁺ entry, whereas Ins(1,4,5)P₃ that is produced in response to the activation of mGluR1s by PFs will release Ca²⁺ ions from intracellular stores. Second, both PF-evoked EPSPs and mGluR1-induced slow EPSPs are associated with Na⁺ influx, and Na⁺ ions are involved in LTD induction⁵⁸. Third, the PF-initiated activation of AMPARs might elicit the activation of PKC through PTK²⁶, whereas PF-initiated activation of mGluR1s might induce the generation of DAG, which in turn activates PKC.

The duplicated pathways in FIG. 3 involving PF AMPARs and PF mGluR1s might solve controversy in identifying the mediators of LTD induction. Wang *et al.*¹⁸ distinguished two types of Ca²⁺ signalling that are triggered in Purkinje cell dendrites by pairing trains of PF stimulation with a single pulse of CF stimulation. When the paired stimulation involves a large bundle of PFs, Ca²⁺ signals span the entire dendritic branchlets owing to activation of VGCCs. When a small bundle of PFs is stimulated, Ca²⁺ signals are restricted to single spines. Single-spine Ca²⁺ signals and the LTD induced by them depend on the activation of mGluR1s and the release of Ca²⁺ ions from intracellular stores, whereas branchlet Ca²⁺ signalling and the LTD that it induces are independent of mGluR1 activation and Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores. As stimulation of a small PF bundle is more physiological than stimulation of a large PF bundle,

ions that are induced in the Purkinje cell by CF stimulation are regarded as modulators of LTD induction. CF stimulation has been noted to be more effective than membrane depolarization at inducing LTD⁵⁴. This difference between CF stimulation and membrane depolarization might be expected, because CF stimulation activates mGluR1s, CRFR1s and IGF1Rs, which might act as modulators to facilitate LTD induction. In cultured Purkinje cells that lack CFs, a reduced form of LTD can still occur⁷. This also supports the view that CRF and IGF1, released by stimulated CFs, are modulators but not mediators of LTD induction. In FIG. 3, these modulators are indicated in blue, and second-messenger processes associated with these modulators are indicated by blue lines.

Which elements are mediators? Can we, therefore, decide that either PF-activated AMPARs or PF-activated mGluR1s are mediators of LTD? In most cases, LTD does not occur in the presence

MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE CASCADE A signalling cascade that relays signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which represent the last step in the pathway, are activated by a wide range of proliferation- or differentiation-inducing signals. Extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are among the best-characterized MAPKs.

the mGluR1-Ins(1,4,5)P₃-Ca²⁺-release pathway should be the primary mediator of LTD induction. This primary mediator can be replaced by a secondary mediator — the AMPAR-VGCC-Ca²⁺-entry pathway — under certain experimental conditions, such as the stimulation of a large PF bundle in cerebellar slices⁶ or of AMPARs by glutamate application in cultured Purkinje cells⁷. In the latter case, Ins(1,4,5)P₃ is not required for LTD induction³².

Which elements are the coincidence detectors? Wang *et al.*¹⁸ showed that the increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration in dendritic spines that is induced by weak activation of PFs with conjunctive CF stimulation is supralinear — that is, it is 8.2 times as large as the linear sum of the increases that are induced by separate stimulation of CFs and PFs. On the basis of this observation, the first candidate coincidence detector should be located at Ins(1,4,5)P₃ receptors (InsP₃Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Purkinje cell dendrites, where Ca²⁺ is stored (C1 in FIG.3). Ins(1,4,5)P₃ that is produced in response to the activation of mGluR1s by PFs activates InsP₃Rs on the ER, thereby causing the release of Ca²⁺ from the ER⁵⁹. CF-initiated Ca²⁺ influx will also cause the release of Ca²⁺ from the ER, and together these effects will cause a supralinear increase in the concentration of Ca²⁺ within spines. This could occur effectively if Ca²⁺ is able to sensitize InsP₃Rs on ERs, as assumed by Berridge⁵⁹. Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release has been shown to occur through ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the ER⁶⁰, but these are located in the dendritic shafts (not the spines) of Purkinje cells. As the ER in spines (not that in dendritic shafts) is essential for LTD induction⁶¹, it is unclear how RyRs might be involved in the coincidence-detector mechanism of InsP₃Rs.

Wang *et al.*¹⁸ showed that the increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration that is induced by strong activation of PFs in dendritic shafts with conjunctive CF stimulation is also supralinear, being 4.5 times as large as the linear sum of the increases induced by separate stimulation of the CFs and PFs. In contrast to the event in dendritic spines, this second candidate coincidence detector is insensitive to mGluR1 antagonists or thapsigargin, which inactivates Ca²⁺ release from the ER. The second candidate coincidence detector is therefore VGCCs in spines (C2 in FIG.3), which have a highly nonlinear dependence on membrane potential⁶². The combined membrane depolarization that results from PF-evoked and CF-evoked EPSPs might therefore induce a supralinear increase in Ca²⁺ influx into spines. It seems that the second candidate coincidence detector accounts for the operation of the secondary mediator mechanism proposed above — the activation of VGCCs by AMPAR-mediated EPSPs.

The high intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration that results from coincidence detection leads to the next stage of signal transduction on the way to LTD induction. This is the phosphorylation and internalization of PF AMPARs, and is carried out by the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PD) system — a system of protein kinases and protein phosphatases that controls the balance between

The main part of the system that consists of protein kinases and protein phosphatases (the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PD) system) is enclosed in the box.

phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of PF AMPARs. A sufficiently large increase in the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, such as that induced by strong PF stimulation⁶,⁶³,⁶⁴ or by the photolytic release of caged Ins(1,4,5)P₃ (REF. 65), would effectively drive the PD system towards the induction of LTD. However, if the increase in Ca²⁺ concentration is relatively weak, another input will be required to drive the PD system. This system would then be a third candidate coincidence detector (C3 in FIG.3) for the increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration and PF-initiated signals such as Na⁺ ions, DAG or PTK, as indicated in FIG.3.

A fourth candidate coincidence detector could be PF AMPARs. The action of the PD system to phosphorylate PF AMPARs might be strengthened by the converging action of a PF transmitter — glutamate — that could sensitize AMPARs for phosphorylation (C4 in FIG.3). Even though there is no direct evidence that glutamate sensitizes AMPARs against phosphorylation, this possibility will remain until it is tested in future experiments.

How is the PD system organized?

The PD system is illustrated schematically in FIG.4. It consists of at least five protein kinases (PKG, PKC, PTK, MAPK and MEK), all of which are involved in the induction of LTD. Of the five protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP2C and PP5)⁶⁶⁻⁷¹ that are expressed in Purkinje cells, only PP2A is involved in LTD induction. These kinases and phosphatases interact with each

other. For example, PKC activates MAPK through the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway ${ }^{72}$, and PP2A inactivates both MAPK and PKC-$\alpha{ }^{73}$. The mechanism by which a high intracellular Ca $^{2+}$ concentration drives the PD system towards phosphorylation of PF AMPARs is the subject of both experimental and computational investigations.

When LTD is induced, the status of AMPARs in PF synapses changes from a normal functional state to a persistently depressed state. In LTP in hippocampal neurons, an abrupt change is thought to be achieved by a self-regenerating process that results from autophosphorylation of Ca $^{2+}$/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) ${ }^{74}$. It is reasonable to assume that, in LTD induction, a self-regenerating process is associated with the PD system. Kuroda et al. ${ }^{11}$ proposed the circular activation of PKC by arachidonic acid generated by PLA $_{2}$, which is activated by PKC through MAPK (FIG. 4). However, three key questions remain to be answered before this hypothesis is accepted. First, as arachidonic acid is known to inhibit PLA $_{2}$, can the postulated self-regeneration develop ${ }^{75}$? Second, even though arachidonic acid activates the PKC-$\gamma$ isoform, which is not involved in LTD induction ${ }^{76}$, does it also activate the PKC-$\alpha$ isoform, which does seem to be involved ${ }^{3}$? And third, will the perfusion of a cerebellar slice with arachidonic acid induce LTD, even though it compensates for the effect of PLA $_{2}$ inhibitors that block LTD induction ${ }^{77}$?

Another possibility to be considered in relation to the self-regenerating process is the rapid protein synthesis that is involved in LTD induction ${ }^{78}$. A translational inhibitor blocks LTD induction when it is applied briefly to a cerebellar slice (for 5 min) during the first 10 min after conjunctive PF and CF stimulation, but not later. It seems that conjunctive stimulation triggers the rapid synthesis of a protein that is involved in the early phase of the self-regenerative development of LTD. Identification of this protein and its role in the PD system will also be a subject of future investigations.

A final common path for LTD induction?
The processes that follow the phosphorylation of AMPARs have recently been investigated ${ }^{79-81}$. Phosphorylation at Ser880 of the carboxyl terminus causes the release of AMPARs from their anchorage to the cytoskeleton by the GRIP and PICK1 proteins ${ }^{82}$. The freed AMPARs are then removed from the subsynaptic membrane by endocytotic internalization. IGF1 released from CFs would facilitate the endocytotic internalization of AMPARs. The endocytotic internalization of the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluR2 has been shown to occur in reduced forms of LTD that are induced by combined glutamate application and membrane depolarization by a high concentration of extracellular K $^{+}$, and also by PF stimulation with the infusion of a PP2A inhibitor (T. Launey et al., unpublished data). This seems to be the final common event in LTD induction, although it remains to be confirmed that this event occurs in LTD induced by paired CF and PF stimulation.

Summary
In this article, the complexity of the molecular mechanisms of LTD induction is simplified by dissecting out the elements of this system into the following three categories. First, although VGCCs act as the only CF-associated mediator, there are several PF-associated candidate mediators that might operate in parallel—Ins(1,4,5)P $_{3}$, Ca $^{2+}$, Na $^{+}$ and protein kinases. Second, to integrate the actions of these mediators, there are four candidate coincidence detectors set either in parallel or in series with each other (C1–C4 in FIG. 3). Third, many modulators exert their effects on the mediators of LTD and on the PD system to maintain them in optimal functional conditions. It can be assumed that this complex organization is a safety lock for LTD induction under highly variable environmental conditions. The mediators, modulators, coincidence detectors and PD system proposed in this article could serve as a guide in our efforts to clarify the molecular mechanisms of cerebellar LTD.

Neurophysiol.* **80**, 2963–2974 (1998). This paper reports that Ins(1,4,5)P₃-mediated Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores is not required for the induction of a reduced form of LTD, even though it is indispensable for LTD induction in cerebellar slices. This is one of the bases of the present assumption that mGluR1s and AMPARs are alternative mediators of LTD induction.

Using two-photon excited fluorescence laser-scanning microscopy, individual spines of Purkinje cell dendrites were shown to be capable of independent Ca²⁺ activation. Ca²⁺ fluxes in spines showed a highly nonlinear dependence on membrane potential.

This is the first demonstration that a stress-hormone neuropeptide is involved in synaptic plasticity. As LTD induced by combined PF stimulation and membrane depolarization without the stimulation of CFs is blocked by CRF antagonists, CRF seems to have a permissive role in LTD induction.
