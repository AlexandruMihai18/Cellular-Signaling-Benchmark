### Abstract  
In many plants lipids represent up to 80% of dry weight of storage tissues. In seeds, lipids accumulate as triacylglycerols (TAGs), which are formed by an extension of the membrane-lipid biosynthetic pathway common to all plant tissues. In contrast to the conserved fatty acid (FA) composition of membrane lipids, the observed divergence in seed oil acyl chains among different species is very high. The acyl groups of seed TAGs can vary in their chain length (from 8 to 24) as well as in their degree of unsaturation. In addition to methylene-interrupted double bonds, many seeds contain TAGs that have unusual functional groups in their FAs, such as hydroxyl, oxirane, or acetylene groups. All of the major steps in the biosynthetic pathway to TAG are now known and sequence information for genes encoding most of the enzymes involved is available. Here we present the current knowledge of the metabolic mechanisms involved in the divergence from the membrane-lipid biosynthetic pathway during storage lipid formation.

the detergent property of a derived soap, and a certain active group might make a modified FA suitable as a special industrial feedstock. The existing natural diversity of seed TAGs indicates that there should be no theoretical barriers to producing exotic FAs in domesticated oilseed crops (which currently supply only half a dozen types of common FAs), but also provides a deep and potentially useful gene pool. Attractive targets for plant genetic engineering for altered TAG composition are the temperate oilseed crops, such as soybean, rapeseed, flax, and sunflower. In the past decade, this vision of modifying seed oils for commercial applications has driven the effort to identify key enzymes that have evolved in the species producing these unusual FAs. Through the metabolic engineering of the lipid biosynthetic pathways, traditional biochemical research has been supplemented by enzymatic redirection in vivo. Using genes encoding modified or exotic enzymes, oilseed plants harboring the common oil composition have been transformed genetically and the induced phenotype studied. This approach has allowed the identification and testing of key enzymes responsible for this divergence. It has also allowed us to define the minimum number of enzymatic alterations needed to create TAGs with an unusual composition and structure.

## OVERVIEW OF TRIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHESIS IN DEVELOPING OILSEEDS

The biosynthesis of plant glycerolipids has been reviewed extensively recently (52) [for a recent compilation of lipid biosynthesis genes in *Arabidopsis*, see (84)]. In this chapter we outline the common pathway only to provide a context for the discussion of its modifications (See Figures 1â3). Conceptually, the pathway leading to TAGs can be divided into six stages, described below.

### Acyl Chain Elongation

In the stroma of plastids, saturated acyl chains are synthesized de novo by stepwise condensation of C2 units from malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to acyl chains, with stearoyl-ACP (18:0-ACP) as the predominant terminal product (Figure 1). For each elongation cycle resulting in the addition of two carbons to the growing acyl chain, four separate reactions are necessary. Each reaction is catalyzed by a separate enzyme activity encoded by an individual polypeptide. The first step in the elongation is the condensation of acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP to form 3-ketobutyl-ACP and COâ. This is achieved by Î²-ketoacyl synthase III (KAS III) (114), followed by reduction to 3-hydroxylacyl-ACP, dehydration to an enoyl-ACP, and a second reduction to form the elongated 4:0-ACP. Subsequent rounds of condensation reactions of 4:0-ACP with malonyl-ACP through 14:0-ACP typically are catalyzed by an enzyme known as KAS I. The condensation of palmitoyl-ACP with malonyl-ACP is catalyzed by KAS II. The plastidial KAS I and II enzymes appear to be homo- or heterodimers of 46-kD and 50-kD polypeptides (64).

The current KAS nomenclature is confusing because the assignment of in vivo function (defined by enzymology) with respective gene products (defined by sequence classes) is only tentative. We therefore define a KAS terminology for the purposes of this review: Plastidial KAS subunits are encoded by two closely related *KASA* and *KASB* paralogues, both of which appear to have evolved from a bacterial *KAS II* gene (106). *KASB* encodes a polypeptide with an apparent \( M_r \) of 50 kD (64). A homodimer of this polypeptide appears to represent the plant KAS I enzyme. *KASA* encodes a polypeptide with an apparent \( M_r \) of 46 kD. There is circumstantial evidence that a heterodimer of *KASA* and *KASB* polypeptides represents the KAS II enzyme (64). In support of this classification is the observation in soybean that antisense inhibition of the *KASA* gene results in an increase in 16:0 acyl chains in the TAG, whereas antisense inhibition of *KASB* results in both an increase in 16:0 and a large reduction in flux through the entire FA biosynthetic pathway (AJ Kinney, unpublished results).

## Desaturation, Termination and Release

In the common pathway, most of the 18:0-ACP undergoes desaturation at C9, which is catalyzed by Îâ¹ desaturase, to form oleoyl-ACP (104, 105, 117). Typically, two different acyl-ACP thioesterases (TE), encoded by paralogous *FATA* and *FATB* genes, hydrolyze the acyl-ACPs to produce free FAs. *FATA* enzymes hydrolyze predominantly 18:1-ACP with minor activities toward 18:0-ACP and 16:0-ACP. *FATB* enzymes usually hydrolyze saturated C14-C18 ACPs, preferentially 16:0-ACP, but they will also hydrolyze 18:1-ACP. The interplay between the FA synthase, Îâ¹ desaturase, and the two FAT thioesterases determines the ratio of plastidially produced acyl chains for TAG formation. The resulting free FAs leave the plastid by an unknown mechanism. Note also that stromal acyl transferases use some acyl chains of ACPs for biosynthesis of plastidial membrane lipids, a minor pathway in oilseeds (52).

## TAG Formation

Upon arrival in the cytoplasm, the free FAs become esterified to coenzyme A (CoA) and now serve as substrates for the ER-based eukaryotic lipid formation [Kennedy pathway; see Frentzen (44) for a recent review] (Figure 2). Membrane-bound glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) initiates the process by transferring the acyl chain from CoA to the *sn*-1 position of glycerol-3-phosphate, forming lysophosphatidic acid. This enzyme appears to have a low selectivity for acyl chains (44). No gene has been identified for ER-localized GPAT in plants. Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) catalyzes the transfer of acyl-chain from the CoA ester to *sn*-2, creating phosphatidic acid. In plants, this enzyme prefers unsaturated acyl chains. There are two sequence-diverged gene subfamilies encoding LPAAT (44). Formation of TAG can be achieved in several ways. In one pathway, the phosphate is removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase, forming diacylglycerol (DAG). The final enzyme, diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DAGAT), transfers

an acyl group from acyl-CoA to *sn*-3 of DAG and forms TAG. Two unrelated genes have been identified as potentially encoding DAGAT enzymes in plants. One form is closely sequence-related to acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (128), whereas a second form does not resemble any other known genes (70). Evidence is also accumulating for an alternative mode of TAG formation in plants (112). This alternative pathway involves an enzyme normally involved in membrane biosynthesis, choline phosphotransferase (CPT). CPT esterifies *sn*-3 of DAG with choline, forming phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major membrane component. From there, it has been recently demonstrated that an enzyme called phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, PDAT, can transfer the *sn*-2 acyl chain from PC to DAG, forming lyso-PC and TAG (Figure 2) (30).

### Polyunsaturation

While esterified to PC, 18:1 can be desaturated to 18:2 and 18:3 by two specialized microsomal membrane-associated desaturases, FAD2 (*Ï*â¶) and FAD3 (*Ï*Â³), respectively. From PC, acyl chains can be either esterified to CoA and become part of the cytoplasmic substrate pool for lipid formation, or choline of PC can be removed to form DAG (16).

### Lipid Bodies

Oil is stored in the mature seed in the form of oil bodies (55). These are pools of TAG surrounded by a single monolayer membrane, most likely generated through budding of the outer ER membrane. The membrane contains proteins known as oleosins (58), which are thought to stabilize the oil body during desiccation of the seed.

Oilseed species with highly elevated levels of saturated FAs fall into two classes with respect to TAG structure. Coconut oil is the best known example of the fully saturated oils. More than 90% of its acyl chains are saturated, with chain lengths ranging from C8 to C16, predominantly laurate (12:0). Clearly, in this species the common pathway must be modified at the level of FA elongation to produce shorter chains. In addition, saturates reside at *sn*-2 of the TAGs, preferentially 12:0 (95, 124). Saturates are not normally found at this position in most oils because the normal LPAAT cannot use saturated acyl chains as substrates. This suggests that there is something unusual about LPAAT enzymes in species that have fully saturated oils. Other examples of these fully saturated oils can be found in many plant species, including members of the Lauraceae and Myristicaceae, which have, in their seed oils, predominantly laurate and myristate (14:0) acyl chains, respectively (56). The second class of saturated oilseed plants accumulate saturates up to approximately 60%, usually palmitate and stearate, both residing exclusively at

sn-1 and sn-3 of the TAGs. Examples are cocoa butter (25% 16:0; 34% 18:0) and oil palm mesocarp (45% 16:0; 15% 18:0). The sn-2 position in these oils contains 18:1 (95).

## Acyl-ACP Thioesterases

Despite intense research in several laboratories, satisfactory biochemical evidence for reduced-length acyl chain production remained elusive (51) until a 12:0-ACP hydrolytic activity was discovered in laurate-producing seeds of California bay trees (96). The protein with this activity was subsequently purified (32) and a cDNA encoding it was cloned. The encoded plastid-targeted enzyme conferred almost exclusive 12:0-ACP specificity in vitro. After expression in seeds of developing *Arabidopsis*, a large fraction of the seed oil was found to be laurate (121). This work demonstrated that a specialized thioesterase can redirect the common FA synthase of plants to medium chains, and the unusual FA is subsequently incorporated into TAG. Since then, evidence for medium-chain ACP hydrolytic activities have been found in extracts of other medium-chain producing seeds, such as *Cuphea*, coconut, and elm (31, 39). Many cDNAs encoding these medium-chain-specific thioesterases have been cloned from a variety of medium-chain producing angiosperms, and all belong to the FATB gene subfamily (Figure 1, blue box FATB).

For example, cDNAs encoding 8:0-ACP, 10:ACP, and 14:0-ACP hydrolyzing FATBs were isolated from *Cuphea* species with oils rich in the corresponding acyl chains [for more details on acyl-ACP thioesterases, see Voelker (119)]. The production of medium-chain (C8-C12) FAs in seeds such as *Cuphea* is thus catalyzed by novel FATB enzymes that have novel, shorter chain length specificities than the long-chain FATB enzymes found in all plants. The sequences of the medium-chain FATB enzymes invariably are found to be most similar to the long-chain FATB of the respective species (paralogues), which is direct evidence that they evolved independently several times from the common long-chain *FATB* after gene duplications (60, 119). This specialization also appeared to have involved an alteration of the respective promoters. The common *FATB* genes have general housekeeping function in all tissues with the highest expression in flowers (40, 41, 83), whereas the specialized medium-chain *FATB* genes are expressed exclusively in the developing embryo (35, 36, 76).

Although the greatest enzymatic divergence is observed in the FATB subfamily of thioesterases, there is one report of a specialized FATA thioesterase involved in the production of stearate (53). Stearate is the predominant FA (45â55% of total fatty acids) in the seed oil of mangosteen, *Garcinia mangostana*. When extracts from developing seeds were assayed for acyl-ACP thioesterase activities, no elevated 18:0-ACP hydrolysis could be detected. Exhaustive cloning of mangosteen seed FAT cDNAs yielded only one type of *FATB* clone, which encoded a classic FATB enzyme with highest activity toward 16:0-ACP. However, two different *FATA* transcripts were detected. One of these genes, *GarmFATA1*, encoded

a thioesterase with unusually low activities with 16:0-ACP. When this cDNA was expressed in seeds of canola, stearate accumulation increased from 1% to 20% of the total fatty acids. These results raise the possibility of a specialized FatA having evolved in some high-stearate oilseeds (Figure 1, orange box).

### Î²-Ketoacyl Synthases

The in vitro chain-length specificity of short-chain FATB enzymes and the induced phenotype of transgenic oilseeds in which they are expressed usually match rather closely. However, these transgenic phenotypes do not always correspond to the phenotypes of the species from which FATB genes were originally cloned. For example, *Cuphea hookeriana* accumulates predominantly C8:0, and lesser amounts of C10:0, but its seed-specific FATB, when expressed in *Escherichia coli*, is more active on 10:0-ACP than on 8:0-ACP in vitro [(36); see more cases discussed in (119)]. An even more extreme example of this divergence was observed with *Cuphea wrightii*, which accumulates 30% 10:0 and 54% 12:0. In seeds of transformed *Arabidopsis* expressing the *C. wrightii* FATB cDNAs, a broad range of saturates was observed (*CwFATB1*: C12-C16; *CwFATB2*: C10-C16), with the emphasis on mainly C14 and C16 chain lengths (76). These and other findings imply that although specialized FATB enzymes are necessary for medium-chain production, they may not represent all of the diverged enzymatic activities in the native plants.

In vitro evidence accumulated during studies of the developing seeds of medium-chain producers led to the conclusion that the FA synthase itself may also be modified to produce shorter chains (34, 102). Using KAS-specific antibodies, it was observed that a 46-kD (KASA) protein had a much weaker immunoblot signal than KASB (50 kD) in developing seeds of long-chain-producing members of this genus (106). In five of five medium-chain-producing *Cuphea* species, however, KASA accumulated to much greater levels than KASB during embryo development. More evidence was uncovered with a *C. viscosissima* mutant with a seed oil deficient in 10:0 FAs. Seed extracts of *C. viscosissima* elongate C8 to C10 in the presence of 10 Î¼m cerulenin (a KASB inhibitor), but in the mutant extract cerulenin impaired this elongation reaction. The mutant also had a diminished 46-kD (KASA) immunoblot signal. In summary, these results suggested the involvement of a cerulenin-resistant condensing activity, possibly encoded by a KASA-type gene, in the production of medium-chain FAs in *Cuphea*.

To address this latter issue, Slabaugh et al used sequences conserved among KAS genes to isolate cDNAs from *C. wrightii* seeds that were most similar to the KASA (46-kD) sequences of other plants (106). The *Cw* KASA encoded enzyme activity could not be measured after expression in and purification from *E. coli*, but it was functionally tested in seeds of transgenic *Arabidopsis* (77). Overexpression of *Cw* KASA resulted only in a minor reduction of 16:0 in the seed oil but, when measured in the presence of the KASI inhibitor cerulenin, increased 6:0-ACP and 8:0-ACP elongation of extracts in vitro. Lines transformed with *Cw* KASA cDNA

were then crossed with lines expressing \( C_w \) FATB2 thioesterases. When compared with the TE-only parents, resulting Fâ seeds had greatly increased concentrations of 10:0 and 12:0. In contrast, 14:0 and 16:0 production was diminished. Thus \( C_w \) KASA apparently increases the interception efficiency of the medium-chain thioesterases somehow (Figure 1, blue box, KASA).

This finding is supported by the work of Dehesh et al (37), who isolated embryo-specific KASA cDNAs from 8:0- and 10:0-producing *Cuphea* species and functionally tested the encoded polypeptides in seeds of transgenic canola. In transgenic seed extracts, the medium-chain elongation reaction had increased resistance to cerulenin, and in double-constructs with C8/10-specific TEs, the medium-chain production was increased relative to TE-only transformants. Additional support for this hypothesis comes from experiments in which the *Cuphea* KASA was co-expressed with the C12/C14-specific California bay FATB1 thioesterase. Expression of this thioesterase in transgenic canola results in the accumulation of laurate and myristate levels in a ratio of 10:1 in seed oil FAs (120). Oils of transgenic canola expressing both *Cuphea* seed KASA and bay FATB1 had increased amounts of 12:0, when compared with the FATB1-only plants and significantly less 14:0 (37).

KASA and FATB genes appear to have co-evolved in species that normally produce large quantities of medium-chain FAs. Assays with transgenic extracts from *Cuphea* mutants and from transgenic seeds expressing KASA genes lend support to the hypothesis that a KASA polypeptide probably confers a medium-chain-specific KAS activity to the common FAS. The transgenic data suggest that this modification results in elevated concentrations of medium-chain ACP intermediates, which in turn allows a more efficient interception of the FAS by the medium-chain FATB. Such a pathway-kinetic regulation of flux diversion is very effective when pathways are modeled by computer simulation (31). Since the activity of plant KASAs cannot be assayed in vitro, it is not known whether the resulting medium-chain production in plants such as *Cuphea* is the result of the increased expression in seeds of a medium-chain-specific KASA common to all plants, or of evolution and overexpression of a novel KASA polypeptide with specialized properties. Note that *Arabidopsis* appears to contain only one KASA gene (84), hence the *Cuphea* seed KASA enzymes are all likely to be derivatives of a common long-chain KASA gene that encodes the KAS II-conferring polypeptide.

## Acyltransferases

When the California bay 12:0-ACP thioesterase Uc FATB1 was expressed in developing seeds of canola, up to 52 mol% of laurate accumulated in mature seeds lipids. TAG analysis revealed that laurate was deposited almost exclusively at sn-1 and sn-3 positions (75% laurate) and represented only 5% at sn-2 (120). This indicated that canola LPAAT strongly discriminated against laurate, but GPAT and DAGAT accommodated the novel substrate, a result expected from previous biochemical observations (44). In high saturate producers, however, TAG is often enriched in

medium chains at the *sn-2* position. For example, in coconut oil, which contains 50% laurate, *sn-2* laurate represents 80% of the TAGs (95, 124). This is also true of *Cuphea wrightii*, whose oil contains 55% laurate (8). In *Cuphea lanceolata*, the *sn-2* position of TAG is composed of 97% C10:0, whereas the *sn-1 + sn-3* positions are composed of only 76% of this fatty acid (4).

Enzymatic evidence for an LPAAT enzyme specialized in the acylation of saturated substrates was first reported using lauroyl-CoA in feeding studies in extracts from laurate-producing developing palm endosperm (113). Oleoyl-lysophosphatidate LPAAT activity stayed constant during endosperm development, although a lauroyl-lysophosphatidate LPAAT activity was present when C12:0 FAs were being synthesized (73). This observation led to the suggestion of a specialized LPAAT gene, distinct from the housekeeping form. Finally, microsomes from developing *Cuphea lanceolata* embryos (90% 10:0 in oil) efficiently produced didecanoic diacylglycerol in vitro, providing further evidence of a possible medium-chain LPAAT in different plant families (4).

Davies et al (33) solubilized a LPAAT from membrane preparations of developing coconut endosperm. This enzyme displayed a marked preference for the transfer of medium-chain CoAs to 12:0-lysophosphatidic acid relative to unsaturated long-chain substrates. Using peptide sequences, a corresponding cDNA encoding a 299-amino acid integral membrane protein was cloned and expressed in *E. coli* and canola (65, 67). In both hosts, the coconut LPAAT conferred elevated medium-chain activity, with a preference for 12:0-CoA and 12:0-lysophosphatidic acid. The expression of the coconut LPAAT did not alter the TAG composition of normal canola oil (which contains no medium chains), but when crossed with thioesterase-engineered high-laurate canola, the resulting double-transformants produced TAGs with high levels of 12:0 at *sn-2* (65). In seeds with 65% laurate, up to 80% of the *sn-2* position was acylated with laurate, close to the positional distribution of this FA in coconut TAGs (95). Up to 15% of TAGs were trilaurin.

Is there evidence for other specialized glycerolipid pathway enzymes in high saturate producers? To date there are no reports on substrate specificity of cloned microsomal GPAT and DAGAT (Figure 2), but there are observations from in vitro feeding studies and engineered plants. Analysis of a series of conventional and specialized oilseeds suggests that microsomal GPAT and DAGAT usually display broad acyl-CoA selectivities and even prefer saturated Co-A substrates (27, 44). This in vitro evidence was confirmed in vivo. Transgenic canola accumulated up to 80% saturates at *sn-1* and *sn-3* when FA production was engineered to medium-chain production (120, 125). These data support the view that the acyl-composition at *sn-1* and *sn-3* positions in TAGs depends on the acyl composition of the available substrates rather than acyl transferase specificity. The DAGAT activities in microsomes of safflower (a conventional oilseed) did utilize 10:0-CoA and dicaproyl-DAG but with no specific preference. In contrast, the microsomal DAGAT of *Cuphea procumbens* (a high 10:0 oilseed) preferred these substrates by a wide margin over oleoyl-containing substrates (126). Additionally, seed extracts

from other natural medium-chain producers point to the existence of specialized GPAT and DAGAT activities (4, 7, 82, 122).

In summary, in high-saturate oilseeds, a specialized and seed-specific LPAAT has apparently evolved to allow the synthesis of trisaturate TAG. Interestingly, orthologues to the coconut LPAAT have only been reported from seeds with specialized seed FA composition (*Limnanthes*, *Cuphea*). In conventional oilseed plants like *Arabidopsis*, with the complete genome basically sequenced, only members of a very distant LPAAT gene family have been detected [see phylogenetic tree in Frentzen (44)]. Circumstantial evidence indicates that specialized GPAT or DAGAT might also have developed. In contrast, while oilseeds with saturates restricted to the *sn-1* and *sn-3* of TAG, such as cocoa butter and mangosteen, might have an altered plastidial FA biosynthesis, they probably contain only conventional acyltransferases.

## Other Mechanisms

Are there any modifications in FA biosynthesis besides the essential altered thioesterases and the synergistic KASA? There is no evidence that any of the three other enzymes of the FA synthase are significantly different in diverged oilseeds than in normal oilseeds. This observation supports the hypothesis that KAS determines the substrate specificity of elongation cycles. ACP (Figure 1) isoforms are expressed specifically in developing seed tissue in *Cuphea lanceolata* (69), and recent evidence indicates that ACP isoforms might be somewhat optimized for a medium-chain FA synthase (103). Finally, the accumulated unusual TAGs need to be metabolized after germination. Laurate appears to be metabolized efficiently in germinating seeds of transgenic laurate canola, indicating biochemical flexibility (120). However, specialized lipases appear to be induced post-germination in most species, with greater than 80% saturated FAs in their seeds (54). In summary, although the major players for the establishment of high saturates are defined, several more enzymes appear to be modified in high-saturate producers to allow optimized saturate production and metabolism.

# OILS WITH NOVEL MONOUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS

Oleic acid (ââ¹ 18:1) is a constituent of most common plant oils. Its relative abundance ranges from about 20% in soybean to over 80% in some mutant and transgenic varieties of canola, soybean, and sunflower (62). The insertion of the first double bond into FA chains is a plastid reaction catalyzed by a soluble desaturase enzyme, AAD1 (104, 105, 117). AAD1 normally inserts a double bond at the ââ¹ position of stearoyl-ACP to form oleoyl-ACP (Figure 1).

However, a number of naturally occurring oils contain monounsaturated FAs with double bonds in positions other than the ninth carbon from the carboxyl group (3, 95). Seeds of Umbelliferae species, for example, such as carrot and coriander,

contain oils rich in petroselenic acid (Îâ¶ 18:1). This unusual monounsaturate is the result of the activity of a plastidial Îâ´ desaturase that converts palmitoyl-ACP to Îâ´ hexadecanoyl-ACP. The hexadecanoyl-ACP is then elongated to petroselinoyl-ACP (26) (see Figure 1). Thus this soluble desaturase has both different substrate (chain length) specificity and different regiospecificity from the plastidal Îâ¹ desaturase enzyme and yet, based on its primary amino acid sequence, is clearly a member of the same gene family (104).

This family of soluble acyl-ACP desaturases (AAD1 gene family) includes other members that vary from the standard Îâ¹18:0-ACP in their substrate specificity, regiospecificity, or both. Examples include the Îâ¶ 16:0-ACP desaturase from *Thunbergia alata* (18, 21) and Îâ¹ 16:0-ACP desaturases from *Doxantha* spp. and from *Asclepias syriaca* (20), all of which have greater than 70% amino acid sequence similarity with Îâ¹ 18:0-ACP desaturases. Indeed, for members of this family, substitution of as few as two amino acids in a Îâ¹ 18:0-ACP desaturase can clearly result in changes in substrate specificity to a Îâ¹ 16:0-ACP desaturase. Substitution of as few as five amino acids can produce changes in both substrate and regio-specificities of an acyl-ACP desaturase, converting a Îâ¶ 16:0-ACP desaturase into a Îâ¹ 18:0-ACP desaturase (23) (Figure 1, green code).

It might be tempting to speculate, then, whether only a relatively minor evolutionary change in the primary structure of an AAD1 gene resulted in the ability of, for example, coriander seeds to produce petroselenic acid instead of oleic acid. If this were so, it would be comparatively simple to convert a standard oilseed crop such as soybean to one that produces the industrially useful petroselenic acid simply by expressing the coriander divergent AAD1 gene. However, Umbelliferae species producing this FA also have a variant KASA gene product, resulting in a condensing enzyme with specificity for Îâ´ hexadecanoyl-ACP. They also contain a variant FATB gene encoding a petroselinoyl-ACP thioesterase plus other variant polypeptides including acyl transferases and, as in high-saturated plants, possibly even variant ACPs (22, 38).

These observations underline not only the complexity of the evolutionary process that has resulted in divergent vegetable oils but also the potential challenges of producing novel FAs in transgenic oilseed plants.

Not all unusual monounsaturated FAs are the result of variant soluble desaturases. For example, the oils of many *Limnanthes* species and a number of gymnosperm plants contain 20-carbon monounsaturated FAs with a double bond at the Îâµ position, such as eicosa-5-enoic acid (Îâµ 20:1) (90, 115) (see Figure 2, blue code). These FAs are the result of a membrane-associated desaturase that inserts a double bond at the Îâµ position of 20:0-CoA (24, 100). The gene encoding this enzyme is closely related to those encoding mammalian Îâ¹ 18:0-CoA desaturases and was the first confirmed member of this family in higher plants. This gene family appears widespread throughout the plant kingdom; in addition to finding Îâµ fatty acids in ancient plants, a number of homologues of the *Limnanthes* Îâµ desaturase gene have been identified in species as diverse as *Rosa* and *Arabidopsis* (46). The function of the gene products of these homologues has not yet been determined.

# OILS WITH NOVEL POLYUNSATURATED FATS

Plants, in common with all eukaryotes, contain sphingolipids in their plasma membranes (81, 99). Although structurally analogous to phospholipids, sphingolipids contain only a single FA with an amide-linked long-chain amino alcohol (49). Plant sphingolipids contain a Îâ¸ double bond, the result of the activity of a cytochrome bâ fusion protein (108). This fusion protein is actually a Îâ¶ desaturase that places a *trans* double bond six carbons from the closest oxygen-containing carbon (92, 108).

These sphingolipid desaturases have been identified in many plant species (46, 92, 108) and possibly represent the ancestral family of unique desaturases first identified in borage (*Borago officinalis*) seeds. Borage seeds, in common with a few other plants such as evening primrose (*Oenothera biennis*) and black currant (*Ribes nigrum*), contain oils rich in Î³-linolenic acid (18:3 Îâ¶,â¹,Â¹Â²). The desaturase responsible for introducing the Îâ¶ double bond in borage (and probably the other species) is a cytochrome bâ-fusion protein closely related to the plant sphingolipid desaturases (10, 101). Given the ubiquity of the sphingolipid desaturases among plants, the borage-type Îâ¶ desaturases likely represent enzymes that have diverged in substrate specificity from the Îâ¸/Îâ¶ sphingolipid desaturase family. In contrast to the sphingolipid desaturases, which are effective on saturated acyl groups, the borage-type Îâ¶ desaturase prefers an unsaturated acyl group derived from linoleic acid.

Curiously, the borage Îâ¶ desaturase is very effective in producing Î³-linolenic acid in transgenic soybean embryos (S Coughlan, unpublished results) but not in transgenic canola seeds (66) or *Arabidopsis* (101). It remains to be seen if this observation is of evolutionary significance. One interesting member of this cytochrome bâ-fusion superfamily is the recently identified bifunctional Îâ¶ acetylase/desaturase from the moss *Ceratodon purpureus* (107). Expression of this gene in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* resulted in the formation of both a Îâ¶ double bond and a Îâ¶ triple bond in the yeast FAs. Thus the cytochrome bâ-fusion superfamily has members with divergence not only in substrate specificity but also in functional outcome of the reaction.

The greatest variation in novel functional groups in FAs described to date, however, is the result of divergence of another family of FA desaturases, the FAD2 family described below.

# OILS WITH VARIATIONS ON THE METHYLENE-INTERRUPTED DOUBLE-BOND

Plant membrane phospholipids contain 18-carbon Ïâ¶ and ÏÂ³ polyunsaturated FAs, which are the result of the activity of membrane-associated FA desaturases. Oleoyl-CoA is first incorporated into membrane PC where it is desaturated to 18:2-PC by a membrane-associated, Ïâ¶ desaturase encoded by *FAD2* (94).

(Figure 2, yellow box). Linoleoyl-PC can be further desaturated to 18:3-PC by a second membrane-associated desaturase, which inserts a double bond in the \(\omega^3\) position of 18:2-PC. The \(\omega^3\) desaturase is encoded by *FAD3* (2, 127).

Linoleic and linolenic acids are polyunsaturated FAs with two or three methylene-interrupted double bonds. A wide variety of plants have oils containing FAs with other types of functional groups or non-methylene-interrupted bonds, and many of these FAs are the result of the activity of diverged members of the *FAD2* family. In contrast, no member of the *FAD3*-desaturase family identified to date does anything except place a double bond at the \(\omega^3\) position of linoleic acid.

The first of these diverged *FAD2* genes to be identified were the genes encoding \(\omega^6\) hydroxylases from *Ricinius communis* and *Lesquerella fendleri* (12, 78, 80) (Figure 2, blue in yellow box). FA hydroxylases catalyze the introduction of hydroxy groups into FAs. Thus expression of the *Ricinius* and *Lesquerella* diverged *FAD2* cDNAs in *Arabidopsis* seeds resulted in the production of hydroxylated FAs, up to 20% of the total FAs of the *Arabidopsis* seed oil (12, 14). There was also a concomitant increase in oleic acid, a factor that has almost always been observed when diverged *FAD2*s are expressed in heterologous plants (19, 24, 74). This increase in oleic acid, along with the observed accumulation of unusual FAs in the membrane lipids of transgenic plants, could be taken as an indication that the novel FA is not being properly metabolized during oil biosynthesis. Thus, as for the diverged soluble desaturases, additional diverged enzymes quite likely exist in species producing unusual FAs. To produce a relative abundance of novel FAs in transgenic plants similar to the corresponding native species, genes for these other diverged enzymes will probably need to be co-expressed along with the diverged *FAD2* genes.

One possible candidate family for divergence is the recently identified PDAT (phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase) family (30). This enzyme transfers acyl groups directly from membrane phospholipids into DAG to form TAG, and it has been demonstrated that PDATs from species that produce a novel FA do have increased specificity toward the particular FA produced by the plant (30). Other obvious candidates for divergence are the acyltransferases, which assemble acyl-CoAs into TAG (45).

The *Lesquerella* hydroxylase enzyme is actually bifunctional and has some \(\omega^6\) desaturase activity in addition to hydroxylase activity (12). Also, as for the amino acids controlling the substrate and regiospecificity of soluble acyl-ACP desaturases, only a few amino acids of a *FAD*-encoded polypeptide appear to control the functional outcome of the *FAD2*-type reaction, in this case desaturation versus hydroxylation (13). Taken together, these observations have led to the suggestion that small differences in active site geometry are responsible for the different functional outcomes of a *FAD2*-desaturases and *FAD2*-hydroxylases (104).

The similarities among *FAD2*-desaturases and *FAD2* hydroxylases and their apparent similarity of reaction mechanism prompted the search for other *FAD2*-related genes in oilseed species that contained unusual FAs. This investigation

led to the identification of FAD2-related epoxygenases from *Vernonia galemen-sis* (57, 63) and *Crepis palaestina* (75) and a FA acetylenase from *Crepis alpina* (75). These enzymes catalyze the formation of epoxy groups and triple bonds, respectively, into fatty acids and represent FAD2 members with divergent substrate specificity. Although oleoyl-PC is the substrate for desaturation and hydroxylation, the result of metabolic studies has shown that the substrate for this type of epoxidation and acetylation reaction is linoleoyl-PC (6, 48, 68) (Figure 2, red code).

Most recently, FAD2-related conjugase cDNAs from *Momordica charantia*, *Impatiens balsamica*, and *Calendula officinalis* (24; E Cahoon, unpublished results) have been identified. Conjugated FAs are polyunsaturated FAs with non-methylene interrupted double bonds. *Momordica* is rich in Î±-eleostearic acid (18:3 Îâ¹-cis, 11trans, 13trans), *Impatiens* in Î±-parinaric acid (18:4 Îâ¹cis, 11trans, 13trans, 15cis), and *Calendula* in calendic acid (18:3 Îâ¸trans, 10trans, 12cis). When the diverged FAD2s from each of these species were expressed in soybean embryos, the corresponding conjugated FA was observed in the embryo oil at a relative abundance of around 20% (19; E Cahoon, unpublished results). The *Calendula* conjugase is interesting because it represents the first example of divergence from an Ïâ¶ regiospecificity for a FAD2-like gene product, in that the Îâ¸trans/10trans conjugation is the result of action by the *Calendula* conjugase on the Îâ¹ double bond of linoleoyl-PC. Furthermore, expression of this diverged FAD2 in tobacco and soybean results in the accumulation of calendic acid (to about 20% of total FAs) without the concomitant increase in oleic acid described above for other diverged FAD2s (E Cahoon, unpublished results). Calendic acid is likely to be metabolized normally by these transgenic plants.

In summary, the FAD2-gene family represents the widest variation from the path of oleic acid desaturation followed during membrane-lipid synthesis. There are now numerous examples of diverged FAD2 enzymes with variations in substrate specificity, regiospecificity, and most important, functional outcomes.

## OILS WITH VERY LONG CHAIN FATTY ACIDS

The presence of Îâµ 20:1 FA in *Limnanthes* oil is indicative of another class of divergent enzymes. In addition to Îâ¸ double bonds, plant membrane sphingolipids contain significant amounts of very long chain, unsaturated FAs (VLCFAs, 20â26 carbons). These unsaturated VLCFAs are also found in the storage oils of some plants, such as many of the members of the Cruciferae, and in epicuticular and storage wax esters. Most unsaturated VLCFAs are the result of the elongation of oleoyl-CoA by a membrane-bound elongase complex (52). A long-chain condensing enzyme (Î²-ketoacyl-CoA synthase) has been purified from jojoba (*Simmondsia chinensis*) seeds, which have oil rich in C20â24 monounsaturated acyl chains. The corresponding cDNA was cloned and the encoded enzyme characterized after expression in *E. coli* and canola. The recombinant enzyme caused the accumulation

of very long chains in canola seeds (72). An *Arabidopsis* gene (*FAE1*) that is related to the jojoba condensing enzyme has also been cloned by insertional mutagenesis (59). *FAE1* complements *Arabidopsis* mutants that have reduced 20-carbon FAs and increased oleic acid and produces VLCFAs when expressed in tobacco (88). Based on these observations, a single condensing enzyme clearly controls the elongation of 18-, 20-, and 22-carbon acyl-CoAs in very long-chain FA-producing seeds (Figure 3).

A *FAE1* homologue has also been cloned from *Limnanthes* and expressed in soybean seeds (24). The result is the formation of 20- and 22-carbon saturated fatty acids at the expense of palmitic acid (16:0). When co-expressed with the *Limnanthes Îâµ* desaturase, 20:1 is formed at a relative abundance of around 20% (Figure 2, blue box). These results illustrate two points. First, the specificity of the elongation step of acyl-CoAs appears to be determined entirely by the *FAE1* gene product. Second, this *FAE1* gene product from *Limnanthes* has substrate specificity for saturated FAs, unlike the monounsaturated specificity of *Arabidopsis FAE1* and jojoba KCS1. The latter observation has been confirmed by metabolic studies that have shown a substrate specificity of the *Lim FAE1* for C14-C18 saturated acyl-CoA substrates (100). *Limnanthes* seed extracts also had a separate 18:1-CoA elongation activity, indicating the presence of an additional, nondiverged *FAE1* gene (100).

The recently discovered *CUT1* gene from *Arabidopsis*, which encodes a VLCFA condensing enzyme involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis, displays a high degree of homology with the known *FAE1* (87). An *Arabidopsis KCS1* gene encoding a condensing enzyme involved in VLCFAs synthesis for wax biosynthesis has also been reported, again with good homology to *FAE1* (118). Because all angiosperm plants make epicuticular waxes, these discoveries may indicate that wax biosynthesis is a possible evolutionary origin of the condensing enzymes used for VLCFA biosynthesis in plant oils. Many plant oils contain at least trace amounts of saturated C20â24 VLCFAs (95), presumably resulting from saturated acyl-CoA elongation. Thus, the substrate specificity of different *FAE1* homologues may be as broad as the *KASA* gene family of acyl-ACP condensing enzymes described above. This suggestion is also supported by the presence, in waxy coatings on plant leaves, of VLCFAs derived from the elongation of saturated acyl-CoAs such as palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA (98).

As in saturated oils, VLCFA oils fall into two classes. Rapeseed oil contains 22:1 only at *sn*-1 and *sn*-3 because its LPAAT does not accept 22:1 (11). Hence, 22:1 is always less than 66% of total fatty acid content. However, other species, such as *Limnanthes* spp., have 92% VLCFAs in their seed oil and LPAATs specific for long-chain acyl groups have since been detected (73) and their cDNAs cloned (15). Expression of one of these cDNAs, from *Limnanthes*, led to the accumulation of 22:1 at the *sn*-2 of transgenic rapeseed TAG (71). These so-called Class B LPAATs are related to yeast and bacterial LPAATs and are distinct in their protein sequence from the Class A LPAATs involved in membrane-lipid biosynthesis (44).

# LIQUID WAXES

Waxes, esters of long-chain alcohols and FAs, are abundant in plants as a component of hydrophobic barriers and for light reflection [reviewed in (98)]. Jojoba (*Simmondsia chinensis*), a desert shrub native to the Southwest of the United States, is the only angiosperm known to accumulate liquid waxes in its seeds as an energy store. Up to 60% of the seed dry weight comprises linear esters of monounsaturated C20, C22, and C24 FAs and alcohols. TAG is completely absent, even as an intermediate (93, 97).

Early biochemical evidence pointed to 18:1-CoA-based chain elongation as responsible for the very long acyl chains of jojoba wax. This was confirmed when a cDNA encoding a jojoba Î²-ketoacyl-CoA synthase was cloned and functionally expressed in canola, as discussed above (72). The additional enzyme activities thought to be necessary for jojoba wax synthesis were a fatty acyl reductase and a wax synthase (97) (Figure 3).

Metz et al (85) purified a 58-kD fatty acyl reductase (FAR) from jojoba seed microsomes and subsequently cloned its cDNA. Expression of this cDNA conferred FAR activity to *E. coli* and resulted in the accumulation of small amounts of fatty alcohols. In seeds of transgenic rape, small amounts of wax accumulated, predominantly with 22:1 alcohol groups, which indicated that jojoba FAR prefers very long-chain acyl-CoA substrates. In lines where the wax content of the transgenic rape was >1% of total seed lipids, free alcohols accumulated. Thus there appeared to be an insufficient capacity in rape to further metabolize the reduced fatty acids. Interestingly, the jojoba FAR gene is related to a gene family that includes *Arabidopsis* male-sterility-2, expressed in developing tapetum and essential for pollen formation (1).

Microsomes of jojoba seeds exhibit a very active wax synthase (fatty acyl CoA: fatty alcohol acyltransferase) activity, which accepts saturated and unsaturated alcohols and acyl-CoA substrates of many chain lengths. A wax synthase was partially purified from microsomes using chromatographic separation. Partial peptide sequencing of a 33-kD candidate allowed the cloning of a cDNA that encoded a very hydrophobic 352-amino acid protein. Expression in transgenic *Arabidopsis* seeds conferred high wax synthase activity. In mature transgenic *Arabidopsis* seeds expressing the jojoba KCS, FAR, and wax synthase cDNAs, large quantities of long-chain liquid wax accumulated, representing up to 70% of the *Arabidopsis* seed oil (70). These waxes contained 20:1, 22:1, and 24:1 alcohols. Thus, not only are a reductase and wax synthase sufficient for seed wax formation, but this new pathway can also efficiently divert carbon from TAG formation in vivo (Figure 3).

Interestingly, seven open reading frames with strong homology to the wax synthase were discovered, located adjacent to each other, on chromosome 5 of *Arabidopsis*. Transcripts of some of these ORFs were found up-regulated in flowers, others in developing seeds. They likely encode wax synthases involved in many of the ubiquitous pathways of wax formation in plants, such as epicuticular wax synthesis.

Early studies with germinating jojoba seeds demonstrated that they metabolize the storage waxes via Î²-oxidation. An oil body membrane-bound alkaline lipase was found associated with this catabolism (91). Thus it appears that during the evolutionary development of storage wax biosynthesis two enzymes were recruited, probably from existing pathways of wax formation. In addition, the evolution of a specialized lipase was required to initiate the catabolism of this novel storage compound. At some point during this process, the ancestral jojoba plant must have lost its TAG formation capability.

# CHANNELING TO MEMBRANES AND TRIACYLGLYCERIDES

As discussed earlier, TAG production is an extension of the glycerolipid pathway essential for the biosynthesis of membrane lipids. Both processes occur simultaneously in the cells of the developing oil-storage tissues and share substrates (DAG, acyl-CoA) and location, the ER. This intimacy of the two pathways poses challenges to cells that accumulate TAGs with fatty acyl chains deleterious to membrane structure and function, such as saturated medium and long chains or oxygenated FAs (89). Indeed, the phospholipids of many seed tissues from plants producing highly saturated oils or unusual FAs have a conventional acyl composition. Very long and medium chains and oxygenated FAs appear only in traces, indicating an efficient âchannelingâ to TAG (4, 89, 109, 110, 123, 124).

This is not true of transgenic plants expressing genes from exotic oilseed species, however. For example, large quantities of medium-chain FAs are found during the oil-deposition phase in the phospholipids of transgenic canola embryos engineered for medium-chain production (124, 125). The lines with the highest laurate content in their oil (50%) had about 30% laurate in membrane PC plus substantial amounts in several other membrane lipid classes. Interestingly, laurate was much reduced, to about 7%, in the membrane lipids of mature seeds. This latter observation suggests there may be an active editing process in the membranes after the cessation of oil biosynthesis. Evidence from in vitro experiments supports the view that this pathway may be selectively activated in transgenic plants (124).

A similar editing mechanism may operate for other FAs. Mature Arabidopsis seeds expressing a Ricinus hydroxylase, for example, contained 17% hydroxylated FAs in their TAG but only about 1% in their seed phospholipid fraction (14). Because immature embryos were not analyzed in this experiment, exclusion as opposed to editing cannot be ruled out. However, because PC is the substrate for the hydroxylase (5), the hydroxylated FA must spend some time in this membrane lipid and thus simple exclusion from PC is unlikely. In contrast, the eleostearic acid produced by soybean embryos expressing the *Mormordica* conjugase appeared to be in equilibrium between TAG and phospholipids. In these tissues, conjugated fatty acids were equally distributed between PC and TAG (19). A similar distribution

between membrane and storage lipids was also observed in mature soybean seeds from these lines (E Cahoon, unpublished results).

Thus, although an editing mechanism for removing unwanted FAs from membranes appears to be present in most plants, it does not respond to all unusual FAs. Such a mechanism may have evolved to recognize and remove FA oxidation products from membranes. This may explain why shorter-chain and oxygenated FAs, common products of membrane-lipid oxidation (43, 50), might be more effectively removed from the membranes of transgenic plants than conjugated FAs. Moreover, conjugated fatty acids, or fatty acids with an unusual bond position, would probably be as damaging to membrane structure as medium chains or oxygenated fatty acids.

Transgenic plants, expressing divergent enzymes from other species, may or may not keep the resulting FA product out of their membranes by using an editing mechanism. However, native plants with divergent enzymes do not have unusual FAs in their membrane fractions in anywhere near the same abundance as in their TAG fraction, either in developing embryos or in mature seeds. What, then, allows the ER of these plants to make lipid classes with such divergent acyl compositions? In principle, this could be achieved by a spatial separation of TAG and membrane biosynthesis (ER differentiation), as proposed by Vogel & Browse (122). Alternatively, there may be some selectivity (âchannelingâ) at the stage of DAG utilization by DAGAT and CPT (4, 122) (Figure 2). Or, as observed in transgenic plants, there may be a selective and efficient removal of unusual FAs from phospholipids by a more efficient editing mechanism (30, 110, 111).

Some evidence supports the DAG utilization hypothesis from lipid analysis of developing *Cuphea lanceolata* seeds, which produce medium-chain FAs. These seeds have 83% 10:0 FA in their TAG, but during oil deposition only 30% of the DAG is disaturated C10:0. When incubated with equimolar quantities of radioactive 10:0-CoA and 18:1-CoA, microsomes from developing *C. lanceolata* embryos incorporated both tracers into TAG at about equal rates during the course of the experiment. However, although high 18:1 incorporation into the DAG fraction was detected, only traces of radiolabeled 10:0 in DAGs were observed. Taken together, these results support the concept of selective and efficient utilization of disaturated DAGs by DAGAT (4).

In contrast, no evidence for a specialized CPT, able to reject medium-chain acyl-CoAs, was found in *C. lanceolata* (122). These investigators noted that the CPT activities of both conventional oil producers and *C. lanceolata* accepted medium-chain substrates quite well. Additionally, CPT assays, using microsomes from *C. lanceolata* with dicaproyl DAG as substrate, resulted in very high levels of lyso-PC among the reaction products (110). These results are suggestive of a selective removal of 10:0 from the *sn*-2 position of PC. This may be interpreted to be the action of a specialized microsomal lipase (110), but it could also be a result of PDAT or some other acyltransferase activity.

Not all medium-chain FAs are excluded from the PC of medium-chain producers either. For example, *Actinodaphne hookeri* seeds contain 95% laurate in their oil and about 7% laurate in their PC during seed development (109). Likewise, during seed development, palm endosperm contains 55% laurate and 15% myristate in

its TAG and 1â2% 12:0 plus 2% myristate in its PC (123). Note that the TAG:PC ratio (mole %) for a given medium-chain FA is dependent on the chain length and PC exclusion or removal appears to be more stringent with shorter chain lengths. This observation may also apply to transgenics expressing diverged *FATB* genes. For example, transgenic canola accumulating C8:0, 10:0, and 12:0 in their seed oil excluded 8:0 most stringently from their phospholipids (125).

As mentioned above, PC is the substrate for many FA modifications by cytochrome P450-type enzymes (6) as well as the diverged FAD2s previously discussed. Thus, microsomes from the developing seeds of *Ricinus* catalyzed the transfer of oleate from ${}^{14}$C oleoyl-CoA to PC (5). Likewise, labeled vernolic acid is transiently incorporated into the PC fraction of *Euphorbia lagascae* microsomes. There is even evidence that products of diverged soluble desaturases, such as petroselenic acid, cycle through PC before they enter TAG (18). These fatty acids are found in the PC fraction of mature seeds of *Ricinus*, *Euphorbia*, or coriander in considerably lower abundance than in the TAG fraction (25, 95). This observation strongly supports the idea of efficient editing of these FAs from membrane lipids, again by the action of specific lipases or by PDAT.

VLCFAs are also excluded from the phospholipids of plants that normally produce them. For example, 22:1 represents more than 60% of the TAG acyl fraction in *Crambe abyssinica* seed oil but only 3% of the phospholipids (47). In radioactive feeding studies, microsomes derived from high VLCFA seeds excluded VLCFA-CoA from phospholipids, but accepted 18:1-CoA (9, 113, 116). Interestingly, the heterologous expression, under the control of the 35S promoter, of *FAEL* in transgenic *Arabidopsis* resulted in up to 30% of C20 and C22 FAs in the phospholipids of the vegetative tissues. This caused alterations in plant morphology and organelar structures (86). Because *Arabidopsis* has a high proportion of 20:1 in its seed TAGs, the VLCFA exclusion mechanism is clearly not as efficient in non-seed tissues. Alternatively, the absence of a TAG sink or inefficient VLCFA catabolism in vegetative tissues simply leaves the cellular machinery no other choice (89). In contrast, the ectopic expression of a laurate-producing TE in canola did not result in laurate accumulation in leaves, probably due to efficient catabolism (42).

In summary, most natural producers of unusual FAs have developed efficient mechanisms to exclude them from membrane lipids. The study of ER lipid metabolism is very difficult owing to the membrane-bound nature of the enzymes and the hydrophobicity of many substrates and products. It is also complicated by the fact that many different processes might occur simultaneously in isolated microsomes, making the interpretation of data difficult. However, the current evidence supports the idea that, in natural producers of unusual FAs, there is some selectivity of DAGAT toward the novel FA, increasing the flux into DAG rather than phospholipids. This mechanism appears to be combined with an efficient removal of novel FAs from PC by PDAT and/or lipases. A similar removal mechanism also exists in transgenic plants expressing diverged enzymes, but appears to operate much less efficiently and does not recognize certain acyl moieties such as conjugated FAs. The invasion of laurate into many membrane lipid classes during the development of engineered canola embryos, and the direct modification of FAs esterified to

the PC of ER membranes before incorporation into TAG, would argue against a spatial separation of TAG synthesis from the ER. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some natural medium-chain or conjugated FA producers have developed such structures as well.

# CONCLUDING REMARKS

A decade ago Browse & Somerville opened their review on Glycerolipid Synthesis: Biochemistry and Regulation in this series with the statement, âThis is an exciting time to be working on lipid metabolismâ (16). Indeed it was, and over the past ten years the rapid advances in biochemistry and molecular biology, along with extensive analysis of transgenic plants, have considerably deepened our understanding of plant lipid synthesis. During this time too, there has been much elucidation of the mechanisms by which the pathways of many oilseed plants diverge from the standard *Arabidopsis* pathway described by Browse & Somerville. Two fundamental questions remain, however: How are oilseeds that produce unusual fatty acids in their oil able to do so in such a large relative abundance and what is the evolutionary advantage for the plant of producing nonstandard fatty acids in seed oil?

A large, broad-based effort is currently under way to understand the first problem, primarily fueled by the desire of industry to produce commercial quantities of new and useful fatty acids in the oils of transgenic crops. No doubt a future review in this series will recount the success of this enterprise. It seems likely that there will be more than one mechanism involved, depending on the fatty acid type.

There are probably multiple answers to the second question also. One possibility is that unusual fatty acids confer minor evolutionary advantages by their potential as anti-feedants. Ricinoleic acid, after all, was known and feared by earlier generations for its effect on human digestive systems. Castor beans, however, offer a unique toxicity in the form of ricin that would surely have provided a greater selection pressure than anything ricinoleic acid had to offer. Perhaps shorter chain fatty acids allowed more rapid mobilization of resources and hence more competitive germination in a particular environment. Maybe storage waxes conferred a stability advantage over TAGs in high-temperature climates. Or in many cases, perhaps, there was no selective advantage or disadvantage for a plant to diverge its TAG biosynthetic pathway: It was just something that happened.

Whatever the reasons, one can only wonder at the many hundreds of different fatty acids found in natural plant oils that are mostly produced as a result of changes in a few amino acids of a handful of lipid biosynthetic genes.

Figure 1 Deviations from the standard plastidal de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.

The enclosed rounded rectangle represents the stroma of a plastid surrounded by its double membrane. Yellow area symbolizes the acyl-ACP reactions. The FA synthase acyl chain elongation steps are shown. Enzymes are in boxes, see text for more detailed descriptions.

- **Black**: standard pathway.
- **Blue**: modifications present in very high saturated medium-chain producers. There are many variations where the elongation has become interrupted, leading to different compositions.
- **Orange**: high stearate mangosteen seeds.
- **Green**: alternate desaturation pathway. The variations are found in different plants, see text.

The free FAs leave the plastids by an unknown mechanism and become esterified to CoA at the outer plastid membrane.

Figure 2 Variations in the ER-based desaturation pathway. All enzymes are localized in the ER. Light blue rounded rectangle represents CoA-pools and elongation reactions. Yellow represents the PC-based reactions. The glycerolipid pathway is shown in the center. Black: standard pathway. Enzymes are in rectangles. Blue: modification found in *Limnanthes*. Green and red: the alternative FAD2 enzymes found in several plants. Orange: PDAT, highly active in editing saturates or other unusual FAs from PC.

Figure 3 Jojoba wax biosynthesis. All reactions take place in the ER. To the right the conventional glycerolipid pathway is shown in black. Light blue rounded rectangle: acyl-CoA pools. Blue: KCS elongation (FAE1-like gene). Pink: fatty acid reductase (FAR). Green: wax formation, a general linear wax ester is shown. Since jojoba does not have TAGs in its seed oil, DAGAT appears to be inactivated.
