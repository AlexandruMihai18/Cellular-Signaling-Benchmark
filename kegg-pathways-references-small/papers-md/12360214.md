DEVELOPMENT OF αβ T CELLS  
IN THE HUMAN THYMUS  

**Hergen Spits**

The thymus is the main producer of αβ T cells and is, therefore, crucial for a normal immune system. The intrathymic developmental pathway of human αβ T cells has now been delineated. The production of new T cells by the thymus decreases with age, and the thymus was thought to be redundant in adults once the peripheral T-cell pool has been formed early in life. However, recent work has shown that the thymus can function even at an advanced age. Research into the production of T cells in clinical settings that are associated with loss of T cells in the periphery has sparked renewed interest in the function of the human thymus.

**THYMIC INVOLUTION**  
The age-dependent decrease in thymic epithelial volume, which results in decreased production of T cells.

The unique role of the thymus in T-cell development in humans is illustrated by the successful transplantation of an allogeneic thymus graft into patients who have complete **DiGeorge syndrome**. This is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by lack of a thymus and parathyroid glands, which results in complete T-cell deficiency and severe immunodeficiency. The transplantation of allogeneic thymus tissue into these patients rescues the T-cell deficiency¹. This landmark study confirmed the basic principle of thymic dependency of T-cell production that had been established in the mouse more than 40 years earlier by Miller². Since then, the mouse has been, and still is, the model of choice to study the dynamics and mechanisms of T-cell development. Although the value of the mouse models for investigating thymic development is indisputable, there are many differences between humans and mice with respect to the ontogeny and cell-surface phenotype of different transitional cell populations, and THYMIC INVOLUTION.

Over the past decade, our knowledge of the dynamics and mechanisms of human thymic T-cell development has increased considerably owing to the establishment of suitable *in vivo* and *in vitro* assays that have allowed the functional characterization of various T-cell progenitor populations (BOX 1). New strategies to introduce genes into primary human T-cell progenitors³,⁴ have led to investigations into the underlying mechanisms of their development. New insights have been obtained also by characterization of gene defects that lead to abnormalities in T-cell development (reviewed in REF.5).

Although it has long been recognized that the thymus involutes with age, recent studies in various clinical settings associated with T-cell depletion have established that, even in aged individuals, the thymus can still produce new T cells. In this review, I summarize and discuss recent data concerning the intrathymic development of mainstream αβ T cells and the effects of ageing on the production of new T cells in relation to various clinical settings that are associated with T-cell depletion, including HIV-1 infection.

Early stages of human T-cell development  
The thymus is populated by blood-borne precursor cells that originate from bone-marrow stem cells⁶. As the human thymus is highly active in the neonatal period, immediate thymic precursors should be present in neonatal cord blood. Cord-blood progenitor cells express **CD34**, which is present on haematopoietic stem cells and on precursor cells that are committed to particular lineages, but not on more mature haematopoietic cells. CD34⁺ cord-blood precursors can differentiate into T cells⁴,⁷, but they are not committed to the T-cell lineage, because these cells have not recombined the variable (*V*), diversity (*D*) and joining (*J*) segments of the T-cell receptor (TCR) loci. These cells also lack expression of recombination-activating gene 1 (**RAG1**), which is required for TCR rearrangements, and **CD1A**, cytoplasmic **CD3ε**, **CD2** and **CD7**, which are all present

Box 1 | Experimental systems to study human T-cell development

SCID-human (hu) thymus/liver (Thy/Liv) mouse model  
This technique involves the grafting of a human fetal thymus, together with fragments of fetal liver, into C.B-17 scid/scid (severe combined immunodeficient) mice that lack T and B cells<sup>145</sup>. These mice have a spontaneous mutation in the gene encoding DNA protein kinase, which results in a failure to complete T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and a lack of T and B cells, so these mice do not reject the human graft. The graft is placed under the kidney capsule to allow rapid vascularization of the graft. The fetal liver provides a source of haematopoietic stem cells for continued thymopoiesis. In most mice, the thymus will grow and produce T cells, which emigrate to the periphery. More recently, mice have been used that not only lack T and B cells, but are also deficient for natural killer (NK) cells. These include non-obese diabetic (NOD)/LtSz-scid mice and recombination-activating gene 2 (Rag2), common cytokine receptor γ-chain (γc) double-deficient mice, which lack T, B and NK cells. In the latter mice, Thy/Liv transplants can be placed under the skin, which facilitates manipulation of the graft<sup>13</sup>.

Hybrid human-mouse fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC)  
This technique was developed for the mouse system by Owen and Jenkinson<sup>146</sup>. It involves micro-dissection of fetal mouse thymus lobes at day 14 of gestation. The thymic lobes are treated with 2-deoxyguanosine to remove endogenous thymocytes. The T-cell-depleted lobes are then co-cultured with human thymocyte progenitor cells on 0.8-μm filters for 3–7 weeks<sup>147–149</sup>. Single-cell suspensions are checked for the expression of T-cell markers.

Human fetal thymic organ culture  
Pieces of human fetal thymus are first cultured at room temperature to reduce the number of endogenous thymocytes. The thymic fragments are then microinjected with progenitor cells and incubated on the surface of filters<sup>19</sup> or placed under the kidney capsule of SCID mice<sup>150</sup>.

Genetic modification of human T-cell development  
Recombinant retroviruses are used to introduce genes of interest tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) into T-cell progenitors under defined *in vitro* conditions. These progenitor cells can be cultured in a FTOC or injected into the thymus of SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice. By comparing the phenotypes of the differentiated GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>−</sup> cells, it is possible to determine the effect of the introduced gene on differentiation<sup>3</sup>.

develop into B cells and CD14⁺ monocytes³¹. Jaleco *et al.*³³ reported recently that the NOTCH ligand DELTA1 has a crucial role in instructing CD34⁺ neonatal cord-blood cells to differentiate into cells with a phenotype of T-cell and NK-cell precursors, whereas it inhibits B-cell development. In the mouse thymus, Delta1 is expressed at the cortex–medulla junction³³,³⁴. As early thymic immigrants enter the thymus through this junction¹⁷, it is possible that these cells are instructed to differentiate along the T-cell/NK-cell and, perhaps, lymphoid DC

lineages, but not the B-cell lineage, by the engagement of Notch1 by thymic stromal cells that express Delta1.

**The role of IL-7 in T-cell development.** CD34⁺ thymic T-cell progenitors proliferate in response to the cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7). This cytokine engages a receptor complex that consists of two chains — the IL-7 receptor α (IL-7Rα) and γ chains. The latter is also known as the cytokine receptor common γ-chain (γc), because it is shared by the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and

Figure 1 | A model of the early stages of T-cell development in the thymus. CD34⁺ blood-borne precursors populate the thymus and pass through distinct stages of development that can be discriminated on the basis of cell-surface antigen expression and the status of T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements. After commitment to the T-cell lineage, CD34⁺CD1A⁻ cells express CD1A and begin to undergo rearrangement of their TCR β, γ and δ loci (pre-T1 cells). At the next developmental stage, pre-T2 cells express CD4, but not yet CD8, and are referred to as CD4⁺ immature single-positive (CD4ISP) cells. This population contains precursors for both the αβ and γδ T-cell lineages. The CD4ISP stage is followed by cells that express CD4 and only one of the two CD8 chains, CD8α, and are referred to as early double-positive (EDP) cells. EDP cells are the direct precursors of CD4⁺CD8α⁺CD8β⁺ cells that subsequently acquire a TCRαβ dimer. It is probable that the CD34⁺CD1A⁻ cell population contains a mixture of different precursor cells. This population can give rise to T/NK (T cell and natural killer cell) precursors and myeloid precursors. The myeloid precursors express granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating receptor (GM-CSFR), whereas the T/NK precursors express interleukin-7 receptor α-chain (IL-7Rα) (TABLE 1)¹¹. Surprisingly, the myeloid precursors can develop into CD14⁺ moncytic cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and NK cells, whereas they fail to develop into T cells¹⁰,¹¹. As bipotential T/NK precursors have been shown directly, it is possible that there are two pathways for NK-cell development. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) can develop from CD5⁻ and CD5⁺ thymocytes (F. Couwenberg and H.S., unpublished observations). The strong expression of the pre-TCR α-chain (pTα) on PDCs, combined with the observation that ID2 and ID3 overexpression block both T-cell and PDC development, strongly indicates a developmental relationship between PDCs and T cells¹²,¹³, but proof that T cells, NK cells and PDCs are derived from a single precursor is lacking. It is also unclear whether thymic precursors can develop into B cells. NOTCH1 is required for the development of T cells in the thymus²⁹ and is speculated to act during the development of thymic stem cells into T/NK precursor cells. NOTCH1 was shown not to be required for development of a thymic DC population, but those DCs might be derived from myeloid precursors¹⁵⁴. As the overexpression of ID2 and ID3, but not of ID mutants that fail to dimerize with E proteins, blocks the development of T cells and PDCs¹², E proteins, such as HEB and E2A, are important for T-cell and PDC development. ID2 is required for NK-cell development²⁶. DP, double positive; SP, single positive.

IL-21 (reviewed in REF. 35). IL-7 is important for the development of T cells in the thymus because mice that are deficient for IL-7, IL-7Rα or γc have a markedly reduced number of αβT cells and no γδT cells<sup>36–38</sup>. The γc and IL-7Rα are also essential for T-cell development in humans, as indicated by the lack of T cells in patients who have X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) — which is caused by mutations in the γc gene<sup>39</sup> — and in IL-7Rα-deficient patients<sup>40</sup>. Correction of the γc defect — either by a naturally occurring back mutation<sup>41</sup> or by the transplantation of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells into which an intact γc gene has been introduced by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer<sup>42</sup> — results in normal T-cell differentiation. Engagement of the IL-7R complex by IL-7 brings together two Janus tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, which are activated by phosphorylation<sup>43</sup>. Once activated, JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate several substrates, including a tyrosine residue of IL-7Rα (Y449), which serves as a docking site for signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)<sup>44–46</sup>. STAT5 proteins are phosphorylated by the JAKs, dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription by binding to enhancer and promoter elements (reviewed in REF. 47). As for γc- and IL-7Rα-deficient patients, JAK3-deficient patients lack T cells, which indicates that, in this setting, IL-7 relays its signal through JAK3 (REFS 48, 49). Strikingly, γc-, IL-7Rα- and JAK3-deficient patients totally lack T cells, whereas mice that have the same defects have reduced, but nevertheless still significant, numbers of T cells<sup>37,38,50</sup>. This species difference indicates that in humans, IL-7 might not be only a survival factor for precursor cells that differentiate into αβ T cells, as it is in mice (discussed in REF. 51). In the mouse, IL-7 seems, at least in part, to be involved in TCRγ rearrangements<sup>52–54</sup>, but not in TCRβ rearrangements. By contrast, in humans, TCRβV-D-J rearrangements

could not be detected in the thymi of SCID-X1 patients<sup>55</sup>. This indicates that IL-7 might be involved directly in the induction of TCRβV-D-J rearrangements in humans. This conclusion might be supported by the observation that addition of IL-7 enhances TCRβ rearrangements in fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC)<sup>56</sup>. However, the alternative interpretation of these data is that γc deficiency completely blocks the generation of CD4<sup>+</sup> immature single-positive (CD4ISP) cells, in which TCRβV-D-J rearrangements are initiated, by a different mechanism. As expected, the inhibition of IL-7R signalling by a monoclonal anti-IL-7Rα antibody also inhibits the differentiation of human T cells in a hybrid FTOC<sup>46,57</sup> (BOX 1). This inhibition was neutralized by incubating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that express a chimaeric receptor, consisting of the extracellular domain of the human IL-4R and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of IL-7Rα, with IL-4 in an FTOC. Using this FTOC system, we have shown that PI3K and its downstream target protein kinase B are involved in the IL-7-mediated survival of human T-cell progenitors, but not in their differentiation, whereas STAT5 might have a role in T-cell differentiation, perhaps by affecting TCRα and/or TCRβ rearrangements<sup>46</sup>.

**β-selection and TCRα rearrangements.** Directly downstream of the CD34<sup>+</sup>CD1A<sup>+</sup> stage, cells express CD4, but not yet CD8, and they are referred to as CD4ISP cells<sup>19,58,59</sup>. This population contains precursors of both γδ and αβ T cells and is, therefore, upstream of the β-selection checkpoint<sup>21,28,60</sup>. β-selection is the process by which precursor T cells with a productive rearrangement of the TCRβ locus are selected for further differentiation. Signals from an effective sensor consisting of the product of a successfully rearranged TCRβ gene and the pre-TCR α-chain (pTα) lead to selective survival and proliferation (reviewed in REF. 61). Cells with out-of-frame TCRβ

Figure 2 | A model of the transitional stages that are associated with β-selection. β-selection takes place when CD4+ immature single-positive (CD4ISP) cells develop through early double-positive (EDP) cells to CD4+CD8α+CD8β+ double-positive (DP) cells. A large DP CD3low population that also expresses cell-surface pre-T-cell receptor (TCR) α-chain (pTα) has been described by Toribio and collaborators64,69. We have found a small population of cycling CD4ISP cells that expressed low levels of surface CD3 and developed into DP cells with faster kinetics than surface CD3− CD4ISPs (Y. Yasuda and H.S., unpublished observations). In addition, we found cytoplasmic TCRβ in 25% and cell-surface CD3 expression in 5–10% of the EDP cells21,28. So, three populations of immature cells (small subsets of CD4ISPs, EDP cells and CD4+CD8α+CD8β+ cells) have been described that express low levels of surface CD3. We speculate, therefore, that β-selection begins in a small population of CD4ISPs that have completed TCRβ rearrangements before upregulation of expression of CD8α. TCRβ rearrangements might also be completed after the upregulation of CD8α or of both CD8α and CD8β. So, β-selection in humans is not strictly correlated with the expression of CD4 or CD8. TCRα rearrangements start in the small CD3− cells. After completion of the rearrangements, the cells express low levels of TCRαβ associated with surface CD3. Two different pTα transcripts have been found, which are differentially regulated. In addition to the conventional pTα transcript (pTα(a)), a second, alternatively spliced isoform of the pTα gene (pTα(b)) has been described. Only pTα(a) can induce the surface expression of a CD3-associated pre-TCR complex, which seems to be recruited spontaneously to lipid rafts; pTα(b) pairs with and retains TCRβ intracellularly, which indicates that the β-form has a regulatory role155.

rearrangements that fail to produce a functional protein will not receive a survival and/or proliferation signal and will die. In the mouse, this checkpoint occurs at a stage before the onset of expression of CD4 and CD8 — more specifically, in CD25+CD44dimCD4−CD8− cells62. The phenotype of the cells at the stage where β-selection takes place in the human thymus is somewhat controversial. We have reported that β-selection starts at the CD4ISP stage, on the basis of the observations that TCRβ V-D-J recombination can be detected at a low level in CD4ISP cells and that 5% of CD4ISP cells express TCRβ protein in their cytoplasm21. Moreover, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of the SRC-family tyrosine kinase LCK results in inhibition of T-cell development at the CD4ISP stage in a FTOC system21. As it has been shown in the mouse that transgenic expression of this Lck mutant blocks rearrangements at the TCRβ locus63 and, therefore, β-selection, we concluded that β-selection begins in CD4ISP cells21. Consistent with this conclusion is our recent identification of a small subset of actively cycling CD4ISP cells that express low levels of cell-surface CD3 (Y. Yasuda and H.S., unpublished observations). Blom et al.21 also found that early double-positive (EDP) cells have abundant TCRβ gene rearrangements and observed that 25% of these cells express cytoplasmic TCRβ. A careful analysis by the group of Toribio64, however, located the β-selection checkpoint at a later stage — namely, in CD4+CD8α+CD8β+ cells that express a complex of TCRβ and pTα on the cell membrane. In this latter study, no cell-surface CD3–TCRβ–pTα complex was found on EDP cells; however, a low level of cell-surface CD3, which is indicative of a cell-surface pre-TCR complex, was detected on a small proportion of EDP cells in the study of Blom et al.21. On the basis of our studies and those of Toribio and collaborators, we propose that β-selection begins in a small subset of

Box 2 | T-cell receptor excision circles

T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements of particular variable ($V$), joining ($J$) and diversity ($D$) gene segments involve the deletion of intervening gene fragments. The excised DNA persists episomally (not integrated in the genome) as TCR excision circles (TRECs). Rearrangements at the $\delta / \alpha$ locus produce two types of TRECs. One type involves the rearrangement of $\delta$Rec to $\psi J \alpha$ and produces signal-joint (sj)TRECs ${}^{68,151}$. In most cases, these TRECs are generated without previous TCR$\delta$ rearrangement and are therefore identical, and they can be detected in 70% of T cells. TCR$\alpha$ rearrangement deletes the intervening $V\delta$ gene segments and produces coding-joint (cj)TRECs. A maximum of two sjTRECs and two cjTRECs can be present in one T cell if the corresponding rearrangements occur in both alleles. Kong et al. ${}^{101}$ in the chicken and Douek et al. ${}^{102}$ in humans have reported that TRECs can be detected in recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). TRECs are not integrated in the genome and they are stable. As TRECs do not replicate and are stable, they dilute out with each cell division. So, TREC levels are higher in thymocytes than in naive T cells, and naive T cells have higher TREC levels than memory T cells. TREC levels are determined not only by the output of the thymus, but also by the extent of proliferation and cell death of the naive T cells. The half-life of TRECs in chicken RTEs is around two weeks ${}^{152}$, but in humans, the half-life is not known.

The figure shows the generation of signal-joint and coding-joint TRECs during rearrangement at the TCR$\alpha / \delta$ locus. The TCR$\delta$ locus is nested in the TCR$\alpha$ locus. In most of the T cells that are destined to become $\alpha\beta$ T cells, the $\delta$ genes are deleted by a rearrangement of two deleting elements of the $\alpha$ locus, $\delta$Rec and $\psi J \alpha$, which produces a sjTREC ${}^{68,151}$. The cjTRECs are formed as a result of rearrangements of TCR$\alpha$ $V$ to $J$ gene segments.

CD4ISP cells before the onset of expression of CD8$\alpha$ and CD8$\beta$, and continues in cells that upregulate the expression of CD8$\alpha$ and, subsequently, CD8$\beta$. In this model, we assume that V-D-J$\beta$ rearrangements, TCR$\beta$ transcription and translation, and then $\beta$-selection occur in cells that express either CD4 only, CD4 and CD8$\alpha$, or CD4, CD8$\alpha$ and CD8$\beta$ (FIG. 2).

In the mouse, it has been shown that $\beta$-selection commits precursor cells to the $\alpha\beta$ T-cell lineage ${}^{65}$. Recent work in our group has provided some insight into the regulation of $\alpha\beta$ and $\gamma\delta$ TCR diversification at the $\beta$-selection checkpoint. Overexpression of ID3 in CD4ISPs inhibits their differentiation to $\alpha\beta$, but not $\gamma\delta$, T cells ${}^{28}$. In this study, it was found also that the expression of ID3 inhibited the expression of pT$\alpha$, which provides a possible explanation for the effect on T-cell differentiation ${}^{28}$. Indeed, studies in the mouse have shown that the E proteins HEB and probably also E12 control the expression of pT$\alpha$ ${}^{66,67}$. So, one effect of the expression of ID proteins in CD4ISP cells, a population that lies just upstream of the $\beta$-selection checkpoint, might be inhibition of expression of the pre-TCR complex and, thereby, the enormous clonal expansion of TCR$\beta$-expressing cells.

After the selection of TCR$\beta$-expressing cells, rearrangements at the TCR$\alpha$ locus are initiated. In most of the cells that are destined to become TCR$\alpha\beta$ cells, the first step in this process involves a non-productive $\delta$Rec-$\psi J \alpha$ rearrangement, which deletes the TCR$\delta$ locus, followed by V-J$\alpha$ rearrangements ${}^{68}$ (BOX 2 and TABLE 2). These rearrangements occur mainly in the small CD3${}^{-}$ double-positive (DP) population, giving rise to the expression of V-J$\alpha$ transcripts ${}^{69,70}$ (FIG. 2).

### Positive and negative selection in the thymus

After completion of TCR$\alpha$ rearrangements, $\alpha\beta$ T cells die unless they are rescued by a low-affinity interaction of the TCR$\alpha\beta$ heterodimer with self-peptides complexed with MHC antigens that are expressed on thymic epithelial cells (positive selection). Thymocytes that express high-affinity receptors for self-peptide-MHC expressed on thymic DCs are deleted in a process that is known as negative selection. After positive selection, CD3${}^{+}$CD4${}^{+}$CD8${}^{+}$ thymocytes differentiate into CD4${}^{+}$ or CD8${}^{+}$ single-positive (SP) mature T cells through various transitional stages. Using CD69 and RAG1 — which are up- and downregulated, respectively, after positive selection ${}^{71}$ — and other markers, these transitional stages have been delineated ${}^{72-75}$ (TABLE 2). In the mouse, positive selection is affected by the deletion of genes that encode MHC class I or class II antigens, or proteins or transcription factors that regulate MHC function, resulting in markedly decreased numbers of mature CD8${}^{+}$ T cells (MHC class I deficiency) or CD4${}^{+}$ T cells (MHC class II deficiency). Patients with MHC class II deficiency caused by defects in transactivating factors present with a severe immunodeficiency disease — bare lymphocyte syndrome, BLS (reviewed in REF. 76). The development of CD4${}^{+}$ T cells in BLS patients is affected, but to a lesser extent than in mice that have similar MHC class II deficiencies. However, subtle differences in

the T-cell repertoire of BLS patients compared with class II MHC-positive family members have been noted, which indicates that positive selection is affected<sup>77</sup>. Perhaps the thymic epithelial cells of these patients express very low levels of MHC class II antigen (allowing some positive selection). Alternatively, CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells might be selected by other ligands, such as CD1, because the residual CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells that are present in class II MHC-deficient mice are CD1 restricted<sup>78</sup>. However, the development of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in humans might be less stringently dependent on positive selection than in mice. Mice that are deficient for ZAP70 (ζ-chain-associated protein kinase, 70 kDa) — which is recruited to phosphorylated CD3ζ of the CD3-TCR complex after its stimulation — lack both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, whereas ZAP70-deficient patients lack CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells only<sup>79,80</sup>. The number of mature CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in the circulation of these patients is nearly normal, although these cells are signalling incompetent as they fail to respond to TCR triggering<sup>81</sup>. There is evidence that the related kinase SYK compensates for ZAP70 deficiency during positive selection in humans<sup>82,83</sup>.

As in the mouse, positive selection leads to a skewed TCRβ repertoire and a propensity towards reactivity to self-peptide-MHC complexes in humans. Early studies provided functional evidence for positive selection in the human thymus. After the transplantation of haploidentical bone marrow cells<sup>84</sup> or completely mismatched fetal liver/thymus cells into SCID patients<sup>85,86</sup>, the mature donor-derived T cells in the periphery react with foreign antigens in the context of the MHC proteins of the recipient, which indicates that positive selection of developing donor T cells occurs on the thymic epithelium of the recipient.

| Development in a hybrid FTOC into: | CD4SP and CD8SP | No development | CD4SP and CD8SP | CD8SP | CD4SP and CD8SP, respectively | CD4SP and CD8SP, respectively |

This model is based on the studies of Vanhecke and co-workers<sup>73,74</sup>, which combined a phenotypic analysis with a functional analysis of the different subpopulations in a hybrid fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC) system. Immature double-positive (I-DP) cells lack CD69 and are, therefore, not positively selected. These cells develop further in a FTOC into single-positive (SP) cells. After positive selection, expression of the early activation antigen CD69 is upregulated, followed by upregulation of surface CD3-T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD27. Of the two CD69<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup> populations, the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (II-DP) cells fail to develop further in a hybrid FTOC, whereas the CD69<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (III-CD4SP), which express CD8 at low levels, are the precursors for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> SP cells. The downstream CD69<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells (III-DP) are the precursors of CD8<sup>+</sup> SP (III-CD8SP) cells, whereas the CD69<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> (III-CD4SP) cells differentiate to CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells. Both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> SP cells go through a stage (IV-SP) that lacks expression of CD1A. The loss of CD1A is associated with the acquisition of *in vitro* expansion capacity and the production of high levels of cytokines, and it therefore marks functional maturation<sup>74,156</sup>. All populations develop eventually into SP cells that are CD45RA<sup>+</sup> (V-SP) and still express low levels of CD69, the expression of which is presumably lost when the cells migrate out of the thymus. CD8<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes express CD103 (REF. 107). RAG, recombination-activating gene.

In a SCID-hu Thy/Liv model (BOX 1) in which liver stem cells and thymic epithelium are derived from different donors, the resulting mature T cells are of liver origin, but are selected on the epithelium of the thymus donor<sup>87,88</sup>. Studies in this model have shown that T cells that have high affinity for MHC antigens of the stem-cell donor are deleted, presumably because the DCs that are present in the thymus and that are the most efficient inducers of negative selection are also of stem-cell origin<sup>87,88</sup>. Interestingly, in the SCID-hu Thy/Liv model, T cells with specificity for the MHC antigens of the thymic epithelium are not deleted, but are functionally anergic<sup>88,89</sup>. *In vitro* stimulation of these T cells with thymus-type MHC in the presence of IL-2 overcame the functional anergy<sup>89</sup>. A similar observation was made in SCID patients who had received a completely mismatched fetal-liver graft<sup>85,90</sup> or been transplanted with haploidentical bone marrow<sup>91</sup>. The mechanisms of T-cell anergy in these SCID patients are unknown, but a role for regulatory T (T<sub>R</sub>) cells in this process has been proposed<sup>92</sup>. CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>R</sub> cells can strongly suppress T-cell responses to HLA-disparate cells *in vitro* and *in vivo*, and they have been detected in the human thymus<sup>93,94</sup>. In the mouse, it has been shown that CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>R</sub> cells have high-affinity receptors for self-peptide-MHC complexes and are selected on the thymic epithelium<sup>95,96</sup>. So, it is possible that donor CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells that develop in the thymus of the recipient SCID patient are responsible for the tolerance of recipient-MHC-specific T cells. However, in a SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse model that uses fetal liver and thymus derived from two different donors, the non-responsiveness to fetal thymus donor MHC was not found to be due to suppression<sup>88</sup>.

The above findings provide functional evidence for the occurrence of positive selection. More direct evidence for positive selection in the human thymus was provided recently by Zippelius *et al.*<sup>97</sup>, who showed that the thymi of HLA-A2-positive individuals contain a relatively large pool of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that bind multimers of HLA-A2 complexed with the self-antigen **Melan-A/MART1** (melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells 1). This antigen is expressed exclusively by melanocytes, the pigment-forming cells in the skin<sup>98,99</sup>. As T cells expressing the Melan-A/MART1-HLA-A2-specific TCR were at a detectable level in the CD8<sup>+</sup> SP T-cell population, but not in the DP T-cell population, they must have been positively selected. The positive-selecting ligands should be distinct from the HLA-A2-binding Melan-A/MART1 peptide, because Melan-A/MART1 could not be detected in the thymus<sup>99</sup>. It was also shown that these T cells migrate out of the thymus and become resident in the periphery as naive T cells. For reasons that are not yet understood, these naive T cells are not activated by the Melan-A/MART1 self-antigen in healthy individuals<sup>97</sup>, but they are activated and elevated in number in certain disease situations, such as in the autoimmune syndrome vitiligo, which is characterized by the destruction of melanocytes<sup>100</sup>, and in malignant melanoma<sup>108,99</sup>.

Recent thymic emigrants

After positive selection and functional maturation, T cells gradually lose expression of CD69 and become CD45RO<sup>-</sup> and CD45RA<sup>+</sup> (REF.72). Recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) lack expression of CD1A but express high levels of CD3–TCR, **CD27**, **CD45RA** and **CD62L**. Not surprisingly, the pool of naive T cells also has this phenotype. So, using these markers, no distinction could be made between long-lived naive T cells and RTEs. Recently, a new molecular marker for RTEs has been identified. Kong *et al.*<sup>101</sup> reported that TCR excision circles (TRECs), which are formed during TCR rearrangements (Box 2), can be detected in the peripheral naive T cells of chickens, and they suggested that the presence of TRECs can be used as a molecular marker for RTEs. Applying TREC analysis to the human system, far fewer TCRδ TRECs were detected after thymectomy than in age-matched non-thymectomized controls, and, therefore, the presence of TRECs was considered to be a measure of ongoing thymic activity<sup>102</sup>. However, this interpretation might be an oversimplification as the number of TREC<sup>+</sup> T cells is determined not only by thymopoiesis, but also by the proliferation and apoptosis of naive T cells induced by either homeostatic stimuli or immune activation, which dilute out the TRECs<sup>103,104</sup>. Moreover, although the exact half-life of TRECs in human RTEs is not known, TRECs seem to be very stable and they remain detectable for long periods of time after removal of the thymus<sup>105</sup>. Therefore, the presence of TREC<sup>+</sup> naive T cells is not an absolute indication of ongoing thymopoiesis. Recently, two cell-surface markers have been described that might be expressed preferentially by naive T cells that have not undergone cell division. These are **CD31** for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup>106</sup> and **CD103** for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup>107</sup>. Both CD4<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> T cells have high levels of TRECs, but these markers might have the same disadvantage as the TREC molecular marker in that they do not distinguish between RTEs and long-lived naive T cells.

The effect of ageing on thymopoiesis

It has been known for a long time that although the thymus is extremely active during the fetal and prenatal periods, thymic function declines in an age-dependent manner, starting shortly after birth (reviewed in REF. 108). In a process that is known as thymic involution, the volume of the thymic area in which active thymopoiesis occurs — known as the thymic epithelial space (TES) — decreases and is replaced gradually by fat tissue formed in the non-epithelial perivascular space (PVS)<sup>109-111</sup> (reviewed in REF. 112). As removal of the thymus in children after six months of age does not result in overt immunodeficiency, it was believed that the T-cell repertoire that is formed before that age is maintained throughout life by thymus-independent mechanisms, thereby obviating the continued need for a functioning thymus. Work over the past decade has, however, shown that the involuting thymus can, nevertheless, function in adults even at an advanced age. Bertho *et al.*<sup>113</sup> found

histological evidence for ongoing thymopoiesis at ages
of up to 49 years, with a normal distribution of T-cell
subsets, including precursors and DP thymocytes. Three groups have found constant levels of TRECs
per $10^{5}$ thymocytes in the thymi of individuals up to
the age of 60 (REFS 102, 109, 114). Moreover, Haynes and
colleagues found ongoing TCRβ rearrangements in
the thymi of individuals up to 46 years of age (the oldest person to be analysed in that study) ${ }^{109}$. In addition,
Jamieson et al. ${ }^{114}$ have shown that the TCR Vβ families
that are present in immature and mature thymocytes
of adults (33–52 years of age) are as diverse as those
that are present in fetal thymocytes, which indicates
strongly that ageing does not lead to deficiencies in
the TCR repertoire of thymic T cells. These data
clearly indicate that the thymus can be active in adults
for at least 60 years.

**Thymic function in clinical settings**

Age-related changes in thymic function are notable in
clinical settings that are associated with T-cell depletion.
Transplantation of HLA-identical bone marrow
or haploidentical T-cell-depleted bone marrow to
T-cell-deficient SCID patients at a very young age
results in successful T-cell reconstitution in most of
the patients ${ }^{115}$. Immune reconstitution is most effective when transplantation is carried out in the neonatal period ${ }^{116}$. Importantly, four out of five SCID-X1
patients that were transplanted with autologous
CD34+ bone-marrow cells transduced with DNA
encoding an intact γc showed recovery of the number
of T cells ${ }^{42}$. These studies clearly show that the thymus, which is initially inactive in the young SCID
patients, produces new T cells when populated with
intact precursor cells. In keeping with a strong thymic
function in young individuals, Mackall et al. ${ }^{117}$ have
reported that after chemotherapy, the thymi of cancer
patients produce new naive T cells in most individuals
under the age of 18. By contrast, three 24-year-old
patients showed replenishment of T cells after six
months, but these were memory T cells rather than
naive T cells ${ }^{117}$. Replenishment of the T-cell pool by
the expansion of pre-existing memory T-cell populations was shown in a thymectomized individual who
received bone-marrow cells from an HLA-matched
sibling ${ }^{118}$. T cells that are generated early after stem-
cell transplantation have a limited Vβ repertoire and a
diminished ability to respond to vaccination with
recall antigens, which indicates that they are derived
from the clonal expansion of memory T-cell populations ${ }^{119,120}$. Together, these data clearly indicate that the
early replenishment of T cells after chemotherapy in
adults is the result of thymus-independent clonal
expansion of pre-existing memory T cells. Nevertheless,
the thymus can resume its function at later time-points
after transplantation. An increase in the number of
CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO−T cells has been observed two
or even three years after bone-marrow transplantation
in adults ${ }^{120}$. Such CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO−T cells are
naive cells, because although CD4+CD45RO+ memory
cells can become CD45RA+ cells, they never lose

expression of CD45RO ${ }^{121}$. Importantly, Roux et al. ${ }^{120}$
have shown that the late-appearing CD45RA+ cells
express a diverse TCRβ repertoire, in contrast to the
restricted TCRβ repertoire of the early appearing
memory cells.

An interesting, but unresolved, question is whether
the thymus responds to peripheral T-cell depletion
with a higher thymic output than in a steady-state situation, which is known as thymic rebound. In paediatric oncology patients, the size of the thymus seems to
be increased after stem-cell transplantation ${ }^{117}$. This is
associated with a replenishment of the pool of naive
T cells that express TRECs in the periphery ${ }^{119}$. A similar observation was made in a proportion of HIV-1-
infected adults, for which an increase in thymus size
correlated with an increase in the number of naive
peripheral T cells ${ }^{122}$ (see discussion below). It should
be noted that this is only correlative evidence for
thymic rebound, because the actual T-cell production
by the enlarged thymus cannot be determined. A study in the mouse has shown that increasing the
amount of thymic tissue in T-cell-depleted mice does
not result in enhanced production of T cells ${ }^{123}$. Moreover, normal thymic output after transplantation, when the T-cell pool is not yet replenished, will
also result in a relatively higher proportion of TREC+
naive T cells than in the pre-transplant situation ${ }^{124}$.

**Thymic function in HIV-1 infection**

*Experiments in the SCID-hu Thy/Liv model*. A marked
peripheral T-cell depletion occurs in the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome that is caused by infection with HIV-1. HIV-1 infection clearly affects the size
and histology of the thymus. These effects have been
investigated in the SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse model ${ }^{125,126}$
(BOX 1). Experiments using this model have shown
clearly that HIV-1 causes marked thymic pathology.
T-cell development is profoundly blocked in infected
thymi beyond the immature CD3−CD4−CD8− stage
and the cortex-medulla junction is lost. Direct killing
of CD4+ T cells, in particular of CD4ISPs, by HIV-1,
which leads to a reduction in the number of DP and
later SP cells, is the main cause of the reduced cellular-
ity owing to HIV-1 infection in the SCID-hu Thy/Liv
model ${ }^{127}$. The susceptibility of thymic subsets to infection by HIV-1 depends on viral load and on the tropism of viral substrains. The infection of T cells by
HIV-1 involves binding of the virus to CD4 and a
chemokine receptor co-receptor, CXCR4 or CCR5.
Viral isolates that use CXCR4 as a co-receptor (X4
viruses; also known as syncytium-inducing (SI) viruses)
infect CD1A+ and CD1A− thymocytes; they have a
much more severe impact on thymic cellularity than
HIV-1 isolates that use CCR5 as a co-receptor (R5
viruses; non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) viruses), which
infect only mature thymocytes ${ }^{128}$. This is not surprising
as almost all thymocytes express CXCR4, whereas
CCR5 is expressed only by a small minority of thymocytes. So, the most marked thymic atrophy is to be
expected after conversion of a viral strain from an R5 to
an X4 type (REF. 129).

**Thymopoiesis in HIV-infected individuals.** Although studies of the dynamics of HIV-1 infection in patients confirm an effect of HIV-1 on thymopoiesis, they also indicate that the interaction between HIV-1 and the thymus is more complex than that proposed from studies using the SCID-hu Thy/Liv model. It is clear that HIV-1 does not cause immediate thymic destruction in all infected individuals. In one study, only 17 out of 59 infected children had a marked reduction in the number of both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, indicating a thymic defect<sup>130</sup>. It seems probable that the differences between individuals are related to the timing of infection of the fetus. Individuals who are infected during the first and second trimesters might develop a much stronger thymic defect than those who are infected during passage through the birth canal. It is also possible that in the children who have the strongest thymic defect, conversion of an R5 NSI virus to an X4 SI type, which is highly pathogenic for the thymus, has occurred. However, a recent study indicates that co-receptor usage by primary HIV-1 isolates from infants is not the only determinant of HIV pathogenesis in the thymus<sup>131</sup>. Adults progressing to AIDS have premature thymic atrophy that is normally seen only in much older individuals, which is in keeping with a pathological effect of HIV-1 infection on the thymus<sup>111,112</sup>. However, early in infection, a different effect was seen in a study by McCune and collaborators. Somewhat surprisingly, these workers observed that in 50% of HIV-1-infected adults in the early stages of HIV-1 infection, the thymus is enlarged compared with age-matched controls, as assessed by computer tomography (CT)<sup>122</sup>. As pointed out by Haynes, this increase in thymic size could be due to the infiltration of lymphocytes from the circulation and formation of germinal centres in the thymic PVS, and not to an increase in the size of the TES<sup>111,112</sup>. However, in the study by McCune *et al.*<sup>122</sup>, the thymic enlargement was found to be associated with an increased number of peripheral CD45RA⁺ CD62L⁺CD4⁺ cells that have a high concentration of TRECs<sup>132</sup>, which indicates that the increase in thymic mass of HIV-1-infected individuals, as seen in CT scans, could be the result of enhanced thymopoiesis. Apparently, premature thymic atrophy, as shown in patients who have progressed to AIDS, is a relatively late effect of HIV-1 infection, whereas early in infection, the thymi of a proportion of individuals might increase in activity. It was proposed that the increased thymopoiesis was a response to T-cell depletion<sup>122</sup>. IL-7 might be involved in this process, because serum levels of IL-7 increase when T-cell levels decrease in HIV-1 infection<sup>133</sup>. Interestingly, serum levels of IL-7 also increase in other clinical settings in which T-cell depletion occurs<sup>134</sup>. This effect is specific, because serum levels of other T-cell growth factors produced by non-T cells, such as IL-12 and IL-15, are not increased<sup>134</sup>. These data indicate that enhanced IL-7 production might be a normal physiological response to T-cell depletion. The increased levels of IL-7 might cause the proliferation of naive T cells, which is consistent with the observation that naive T cells of HIV-1-infected individuals show increased proliferation<sup>133</sup>, and might also result in enhanced thymic activity.

However, it should be noted that so far there is no evidence for enhanced intrathymic IL-7 production after peripheral T-cell depletion.

The use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) strongly suppresses viral replication, which results in a restoration of the number and functional activities of CD4⁺ T cells. The marked reduction of TREC levels in T cells of HIV-1-infected individuals compared with age-matched controls, combined with the increase in the level of TRECs after HAART, has led to the belief that thymopoiesis resumes after this therapy. Indeed, recent longitudinal studies that combined various parameters, including TREC levels, CT scans and phenotyping of naive T-cell subsets, have provided evidence that, at least in a subpopulation of patients, thymopoiesis resumes after HAART<sup>135–137</sup>.

A hallmark of progressing HIV-1 infection is the depletion of CD4⁺ T cells, followed later by the depletion of naive CD8⁺ T cells. Although it is clear that HIV-1 infects and kills peripheral T cells directly, it seems reasonable to assume that the inhibition of thymic T-cell production by HIV-1 contributes to the depletion of naive CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells that is seen in progressing HIV-1 infections<sup>102,138</sup>. However, the importance of this contribution remains controversial<sup>139</sup>. Normal thymic function was found in many HIV-1-infected patients and HAART induced an increase in the level of TRECs in those patients who had low TREC levels before treatment<sup>140</sup>, which indicates that thymopoiesis was restored by HAART. Consistent with this notion is the observation that TCR repertoires become more diverse after HAART, which might be a result of the renewed production of naive T cells in the thymus<sup>141</sup>. However, it is clear that even in those situations where normal thymopoiesis resumes after HAART, this is insufficient to explain the post-treatment rise in the number of peripheral T cells<sup>142,143</sup>.

### Concluding comments

The studies that are reviewed here have delineated the developmental pathway for αβ T cells in the human thymus. The mechanisms that underlie the different steps in this developmental pathway are still incompletely understood. Although mouse models remain crucial for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of T-cell differentiation, such studies also need to be carried out in human models to enable us to understand some of the differences between these developmental processes in human and mouse — for example, the differences in the role of the IL-7R in human versus mouse T-cell development.

The question of whether, and how, the thymus of adults contributes to the production of new naive T cells in situations of T-cell depletion is currently being actively investigated. One problem with these studies is that there are no precise data from children and adults with regard to the number of T cells that are produced per day. In the mouse, these data are obtained from measurements of T-cell production starting from a known number of injected labelled precursor cells. Such experiments cannot be done in humans. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on indirect measurements.
The realization that TREC$ can be used as a molecular marker for thymic emigrants has led to a large number of studies applying TREC analysis to address pertinent questions with regard to the production of T cells in clinical settings. As discussed here, these studies have also made it clear that although it is very useful, TREC analysis by itself might lead to ambiguous answers. Obviously, concomitant analyses of the phenotype of RTEs that include the more recently identified markers CD31 and CD103 need to be included. Measurements of thymic mass are also required to gain information about the production of T cells in situations of T-cell depletion. The use of combinations of assays is indispensable for examining strategies to enhance thymopoiesis in adults. Such approaches might be applied to improve the slow recovery of thymopoiesis in many adults who receive stem-cell transplantation, which remains a formidable challenge. As discussed recently by Fry and Mackall, IL-7 might prove to be a useful reagent for improving thymopoiesis. However, as ageing leads to atrophy of the thymic microenvironment, it is to be expected that future strategies to improve thymopoiesis in adults should also be directed at stimulating and expanding the thymic stromal compartment.

   This exciting paper shows the successful gene therapy of patients suffering from X-linked SCID. An intact γc DNA was introduced into bone-marrow cells of these patients using retroviral gene transfer. After transplantation of the gene-modified bone-marrow cells, T cells were produced that carried the transgene. T cells from the treated patients were functionally normal and able to mediate immunoprotection.
