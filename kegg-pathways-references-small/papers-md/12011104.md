Sphingolipids form specialized structures, mediate cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions, modulate the behavior of cellular proteins and receptors, and participate in signal transduction. They are synthesized *de novo* via a common backbone (sphinganine) that is modified to produce ceramides and more complex phospho- and glycosphingolipids. This minireview summarizes sphingoid base metabolism, function, and perturbation, including the participation of *de novo* sphingolipid biosynthesis in disease; other minireviews in this series will focus on ceramides (1), sphingosine 1-phosphate (2), complex sphingolipids (3), and sphingolipid trafficking (4).

### Structural Diversity of Sphingoid Bases

Sphingoid bases¹ are compounds with structural similarity to sphingosine from the root name (“sphingosin”) assigned to this family of alkaloidal lipids by Thudichum (5). They encompass a wide array of 2-amino-1,3-dihydroxyalkanes or -enes with (2*S*,3*R*)-*erythro* stereochemistry, alkyl chain lengths from 14 to 22 carbon atoms, 0 to 2 double bonds, and other modifications, such as hydroxyl group(s) at positions 4 or 6 and branching methyl groups at ω-1 (iso), ω-2 (anti-iso), or elsewhere (6, 7). Mammals produce mainly the species shown in Fig. 1 plus small amounts of other chain length homologs; yeast have 18- and 20-carbon phytosphingosines and sphinganines (sphingoid bases with double bonds and hydroxyl and/or methyl groups are common in other fungi); and plants have unsaturated bases such as sphing-8-enines, sphing-4,8-dienes, and phytosphing-(8 or 9)-enines.

Some organisms (such as fungi and sponges) produce compounds that are sphingoid base-like, examples of which are shown in Fig. 2. As will be discussed later, at least some of these disrupt sphingolipid metabolism.

¹ Names in use for common sphingoid bases with those recommended by the IUPAC (7) shown in brackets are: sphingosine [(2*S*,3*R*,4*E*)-2-amino-octadec-4-ene-1,3-diol and (*E*)-sphing-4-enine]; dihydrosphingosine [(2*S*,3*R*)-2-amino-octadecane-1,3-diol and sphinganine]; phytosphingosine and 4-hydroxysphinganine [(2*S*,3*S*,4*R*)-2-amino-octadecane-1,3,4-triol]. When alkyl chain length is not specified, it is assumed to be 18-carbon atoms; other lengths can be designated by a name or number prefix (such as icosasphingosine or C₂₀-sphingosine for a sphingosine with 20 carbon atoms).

De Novo Sphingolipid Biosynthesis

The capacity for *de novo* sphingolipid biosynthesis (Fig. 1) is widespread among cell types and tissues. In the absence of an exogenous sphingoid base source, loss of this pathway by mutation of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)² (8, 9) or its inhibition by ISP1/myriocin or sphingofungin B (10) affects growth and viability. *De novo* sphingolipid biosynthesis is probably required for survival *in vivo* because, although sphingolipids are present in most foods, the sphingoid bases are largely degraded in the mammalian intestine (11).

It is intriguing that this pathway contains so many compounds that affect cell behavior when added exogenously or formed via sphingolipid turnover and that the consequences can be growth arrest and cytotoxicity (ceramide and sphingosine) or growth stimulation or inhibition of apoptosis (sphingosine 1-phosphate) (1, 2). With so many bioactive intermediates, essentially all of the enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism must be efficiently coordinated, with three warranting particular attention: serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the initial step of the pathway; (dihydro)ceramide synthase, which removes sphingoid bases as well as produces dihydroceramide (or ceramide, if sphingosine is available from sphingolipid turnover or an exogenous source); and dihydroceramide desaturase, which converts relatively inactive dihydroceramides to ceramides.

#### Serine Palmitoyltransferase

For mammals and yeast, two gene products (termed SPTLC1 and SPTLC2, or sometimes SPT1 and SPT2) are necessary for this activity (12) and appear to be physically associated (13). A third has been identified in yeast, but there does not appear to be a mammalian homolog (14). The amino acid sequence of SPT2 has homology to other pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent decarboxylases, with Lys³⁷⁷ predicted to be the site of the Schiff base with this cofactor (15). SPT2 may be primarily responsible for catalytic activity because SPT1 lacks this Lys (16); nonetheless, mutations in SPT1 (SPTLC1) cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSN1), the most common hereditary disorder of peripheral sensory neurons (17, 18). An intrinsic membrane protein, SPT is difficult to study; however, *Sphingomonas* has a soluble, homodimeric SPT (19).

The regulation of SPT is only beginning to be understood. One of the more straightforward factors that affects SPT activity is the availability of both serine- and palmitoyl-CoA, and because SPT is highly selective for fatty acyl-CoA with 16 ± 1 carbon atoms, other fatty acids can be inhibitory *in vivo*, possibly by competing for the CoA pool (20). Serine palmitoyltransferase is inhibited by a number of synthetic and naturally occurring agents. As for many pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes, it undergoes active site-dependent (“suicide”) inhibition with β-haloalanines and other aldehyde reactive compounds (21, 22). More potent and selective inhibitors have been isolated from microorganisms (sphingofungins, lipoxamycins, and ISP1/myriocin) (Fig. 2) (23, 24). These inhibitors (and particularly ISP1, which is available commercially) have been valuable in identifying the roles of *de novo* biosynthesis in sphingolipid-mediated cell death (25); however, care must be exerted in using the less specific inhibitors (10).

**Minireview: Sphingoid Base Biosynthesis**

![Diagram](#)

FIG. 1. *De novo* biosynthetic pathway for sphingoid bases and complex sphingolipids. The color coding distinguishes the biosynthetic enzymes (with common names in red and green arrows for the reactions catalyzed) and intermediates (in blue) from additional reactions that occur with these intermediates (in black). The dashed line for (*N*-acyl)phytosphingosine synthesis reflects that in yeast, where this has been best characterized, hydroxylation may occur with both free sphinganine and dihydroceramide.

Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) ceramide synthase (CS) inhibitors:

- ISP1 or myriocin (SPT)
- Sphingofungin B & C (AcO-) (SPT)
- Fumonisin B₁ (CS) (Aminopentol AP₁) (CS)

Examples of other sphingoid base-like compounds:
- Calyxoside 1
- BRS1

FIG. 2. Examples of naturally occurring inhibitors for two key enzymes of sphingolipid biosynthesis as well as other sphingoid base-like compounds. More information on these inhibitors is given in the text. Calyxoside (65) and BRS1 (66) were both isolated as bioactive compounds from sponges.

hibits SPT, which may have significance in brain tissue, where this stereoisomer is found (26).

Sphingoid base synthesis can be suppressed by adding lipoproteins or free sphingoid bases to cells in culture (reviewed in Ref. 11) perhaps by down-regulation of SPT by sphingoid base 1-phosphates (27). Regulation at a transcriptional level has been seen with a number of agents, including endotoxin and cytokines (28), UVB irradiation (29), retinoic acid (30), and other agents (31). Induction of both SPT1 and SPT2 occurs in balloon-injured rat carotid artery (32). Activation of SPT occurs post-translationally in response to etoposide (33) and heat shock in yeast (34). The heat shock response in yeast involves mainly eicosasphinganines (*i.e.* C₂₀ sphingoid bases) (35) and induces changes in amino acid transport (36) and activation of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (37).

(Dihydro)ceramide Synthase—The reduction of 3-ketosphinganine and acylation of sphinganine to dihydroceramide (Fig. 1) both appear rapid *in vivo* due to lack of accumulation of the intermediates under usual conditions. (Dihydro)ceramide synthase(s) utilize a range of fatty acyl-CoAs (C16:0 to C26:0) and probably represent a family of isozymes. The recent identification of yeast genes essential for acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide synthesis (38) should lead to isolation of the counterpart(s) in other organisms. Ceramides can also be synthesized by the reverse reaction of ceramidase(s) (39, 40), and in yeast this route has allowed cloning of an alkaline ceramidase based on resistance to fumonisin B₁ (40).

(Dihydro)ceramide synthesis is the target of a number of fungal inhibitors (11) such as fumonisin B₁ (FB₁) (Fig. 2). Structure-function investigations suggest that the aminoalkyl backbone competes with the sphingoid base binding site of (dihydro)ceramide synthase, and the anionic tricarballylic side chains interfere with utilization of the co-substrate fatty acyl CoA; thus, compounds with the aminopentol backbone alone (AP₁ in Fig. 2) are both substrates and inhibitors (41).

Dihydroceramide Desaturase—The last step of ceramide syn-

thesis is insertion of a 4,5-trans-double bond into dihydroceramide as shown in Fig. 1 (42). This is an important reaction because ceramides (but much less so dihydroceramides) are active in inducing apoptosis (1). This reaction can be reproduced *in vitro* using either dihydroceramide or dihydrosphingomyelin (42, 43). Sphingolipid desaturases have been cloned from plants (44), leading to the recent identification of the Δ4-desaturase genes of *Homo sapiens*, *Mus musculus*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, and *Candida albicans* and a bifunctional Δ4-desaturase/C-4-hydroxylase from *M. musculus* (45). The deuterium isotope effect for C–H bond cleavage suggests that the desaturase initially oxidizes C-4 (46), which is consistent with the finding that one of the desaturases catalyzes both ceramide and phytoceramide synthesis (45). A cyclopropene analog of ceramide potently inhibits the desaturase (47). Genes responsible for phytosphingosine synthesis have been identified in yeast (48, 49), plants (50), and *M. musculus* (45). *In vitro* assays suggest that hydroxylation can occur with both the free sphingoid base and dihydroceramide, at least in yeast (49) (dashed arrow in Fig. 1).

**Other Reactions—**The enzymes that remove ceramide (ceramidases and synthases for complex sphingolipids), the sphingoid base kinases (as well as the phosphatases that reverse this reaction and the lyase that cleaves sphingoid base 1-phosphates to a fatty aldehyde and ethanolamine phosphate) (Fig. 1) will be discussed in the accompanying minireviews (1–4).

**Implication of de Novo Sphingolipid Biosynthesis in Cell Death**

Alteration of *de novo* sphingolipid biosynthesis can be toxic, as was first shown for the fumonisins (51). Fumonisins are mycotoxin contaminants of maize that cause a spectrum of disease: cancer (rats and humans), leukoencephalomalacia (equines), pulmonary edema (pigs), liver and kidney toxicity (multiple species), and other disease (52). By inhibiting (dihydro)ceramide synthase, fumonisins cause the accumulation of sphinganine (Fig. 3) in tissues, serum, and urine, which is widely used as a biomarker of fumonisin exposure (51). The accumulation of sphinganine appears to be responsible for most of the deleterious effects of these mycotoxins, although depletion of complex sphingolipids impairs the function of some membrane proteins, such as the folate transporter (53), and may contribute to neural tube disease (67).

Fumonisins can significantly elevate sphinganine 1-phosphate (54) and production of ethanolamine phosphate (55) (Figs. 1 and 3). Because sphingoid base 1-phosphates are mitogenic and anti-apoptotic (2), this may account for (or at least contribute to) the seemingly paradoxical stimulation of growth by fumonisins in some cells (56) and the oft cited “protection of cells from apoptosis because of *de novo* synthesized ceramide”³ in some cases where fumonisins are used. This cautionary statement notwithstanding, it is clear that *de novo* sphingolipid biosynthesis participates in cell death induced by a wide variety of agents. First noted by Kolesnick and collaborators (57) in studies of daunorubicin-induced apoptosis, activation of (dihydro)ceramide synthase may also be involved in some aspects of the toxicities of phorbol esters and radiation (58, 59), angiotensin II and cannabinoids (60, 61), and elevations in palmitoyl-CoA because of excess production or impaired removal by mitochondrial oxidation or other metabolism (62) (Fig. 3). This has implications for a wide range of disorders and has been articulated as one of the mechanisms for “lipotoxic” disease (63).

³ As an inhibitor of the first step of this pathway, ISP1 (myriocin) can be used to block ceramide synthesis without elevating sphinganine and other intermediates (30).
