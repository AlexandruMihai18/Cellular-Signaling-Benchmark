**ABSTRACT:** Glycosyltransferases are ubiquitous in nature. They catalyze a glycosidic bond formation between sugar donors and sugar or nonsugar acceptors to produce oligo/ polysaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosylated natural products, and other sugar-containing entities. However, a trehalose 6-phosphate synthase-like protein has been found to catalyze an unprecedented nonglycosidic C—N bond formation in the biosynthesis of the aminocyclitol antibiotic validamycin A. This dedicated ‘pseudoglycosyltransferase’ catalyzes a condensation between GDP-valienol and validamine 7-phosphate to give validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate with net retention of the ‘anomeric’ configuration of the donor cyclitol in the product. The enzyme operates in sequence with a phosphatase, which dephosphorylates validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate to validoxylamine A.

**INTRODUCTION**

Glycosyltransferases (EC 2.4.x.y) are among the most abundant enzymes in nature and play a central role in structural and physiological aspects of living organisms. They catalyze the transfer of a sugar moiety from an activated donor sugar onto sugar or nonsugar acceptors, resulting in sugar-containing products, such as oligo/polysaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosylated natural products, and many others. To date, there are more than 44,000 genes which encode proteins across the 92 known families of glycosyltransferases listed in the NCBI database, and this number is fast growing.¹ However, only a fraction of them have actually been functionally characterized.

Whereas all glycosyltransferases characterized to date catalyze glycosylation reactions, some glycosyltransferase-like proteins have recently been implicated in nonglycosidic C—N bond formations in natural products biosyntheses. Examples include ValL/VldE, trehalose 6-phosphate synthase-like proteins involved in the biosynthesis of the crop protectant validamycin A (1) (Figure 1) in several *Streptomyces hygroscopicus* sp.,²³ and AcbS/GacS, glycosyltransferase-like enzymes proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the antidiabetic drug acarbose (2) in *Actinoplanes* sp. SE50/110 and *Streptomyces glaucescens*.⁴⁵

Validamycin A (1) is a bacterial-derived natural product that consists of an aminocyclitol moiety, validoxylamine A, and glucose. The validoxylamine A core structure is built of an unsaturated cyclitol and a saturated cyclitol, which are connected through a shared single nitrogen bridge. Previous investigations using isotopically labeled precursors and biochemical experiments demonstrated that these cyclitol units are derived from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate via a set of cyclic intermediates,⁶⁻⁹ and further downstream the pathway requires a coupling reaction between the two cyclitols. However, the biochemical mechanism underlying this coupling reaction had been poorly understood, stimulating speculations around how the nitrogen bridge in this compound is formed.²³⁶ Here, we describe the first biochemical evidence of an unprecedented nonglycosidic C—N coupling in validamycin biosynthesis catalyzed by a trehalose 6-phosphate synthase-like enzyme, VldE. This dedicated ‘pseudoglycosyltransferase’ recognizes GDP-valienol and validamine 7-phosphate as substrates and operates in sequence with a phosphatase (VldH), which dephosphorylates the VldE product validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate to validoxylamine A, a process that is similar to that of trehalose biosynthesis by trehalose 6-phosphate synthase and trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase.

**RESULTS**

Validation of VldB as a Cyclitol Nucleotidytransferase. Biosynthetic gene clusters of validamycin have been identified in a number of *Streptomyces* strains, for example, *S. hygroscopicus* subsp. *jinggangensis* S008 and *S. hygroscopicus* subsp. *limoneus* KCCM 11405 (IFO 12704).²³ Direct comparison of the former (the *val* cluster) and the latter (the *vld* cluster) has shown that both clusters contain almost identical sets of genes necessary for the biosynthesis of validamycin A (Figure 2A),¹⁰ suggesting that both producers may be closely related. As part of our investigation on validamycin biosynthesis in *S. hygroscopicus* S008, we recently established the role of ValB, a cyclitol nucleotidytransferase that catalyzes the conversion of valienol 1-phosphate to GDP-valienol.¹¹ However, its homologue (VldB) from *S. hygroscopicus* subsp. *limoneus* KCCM 11405 was reported as a glucose

1-phosphate uridylyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of UDP-glucose. To validate the function of VldB as a cyclitol nucleotidyltransferase, the recombinant protein was tested using synthetic valienol 1-phosphate as substrate in the presence of all five naturally occurring NTPs (ATP, GTP, CTP, dTTP, and UTP). The results showed that VldB, in reactions containing 1 mM Mg²⁺, effectively catalyzes the conversion of valienol 1-phosphate to GDP-valienol and less effectively to ADP-valienol or other NDP derivatives (Figure 2C). However, interestingly, in reactions containing 10 mM Mg²⁺, the enzyme more effectively used ATP as nucleotidyl donor than GTP or other NTPs (Figure 2C). Although the reason for this nucleotidyl donor preference switch is unclear, the results confirm our hypothesis that VldB is a cyclitol nucleotidyltransferase that plays a critical role in supplying NDP-valienol, most likely GDP-valienol, in validamycin biosynthesis. Therefore, the formation of validoxylamine A may involve a coupling reaction between GDP-valienol and an amino-bearing cyclitol counterpart.

Syntheses of Validamine (16) and Validamine 7-Phosphate (21). To explore the above-proposed coupling reaction, we synthesized two potential aminocyclitol substrates, validamine (16) and validamine 7-phosphate (21). The two compounds were prepared from validoxylamine A (8) as shown in Scheme 1. Thus, complete benzoylation of validoxylamine A using BnBr and NaH furnished perbenzoylated validoxylamine A (9), which was then treated with NBS to give a mixture of four products, tetrabenzylvalienone (10), tetrabenzylvalidone (11), tetrabenzylvalidamine (12), and tetrabenzylvalienamine (13). The benzylated validamine and valienamine products were chromatographically separated from their keto-analogues, and the mixture was subjected to Cbz-protection to give 1-Cbz-2,3,4,7-tetrabenzylvalienamine (14) and 1-Cbz-2,3,4,7-tetrabenzylvalidamine (15). The compounds were then chromatographically separated, and complete deprotection of 15 by hydrogenolysis afforded validamine (16) in a quantitative yield.

For the synthesis of validamine 7-phosphate (21), 15 was regioselectively debenzylated and acetylated using ZnCl₂, Ac₂O, and AcOH, followed by a deacetylation step to furnish a free alcohol product, 1-Cbz-2,3,4-tribenzylvalidamine (19). The alcohol 19 was then treated with dibenzyl diisopropyl phosphoramidite in the presence of 1H-tetrazole to form the phosphate intermediate, which was readily oxidized by m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to afford a phosphate product (20). Finally, debenzylation was achieved by hydrogenolysis with Pd/C to give the desired product validamine 7-phosphate (21).

Characterization of the Glycosyltransferase-like Protein VldE. As validoxylamine A is structurally similar to trehalose, the trehalose 6-phosphate synthase-like protein VldE was suspected to catalyze this coupling reaction. Trehalose 6-phosphate synthases (EC 2.4.1.15) catalyze the synthesis of trehalose 6-phosphate from UDP-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate with net retention of the anomeric configuration of the donor sugar in the product (Scheme S1). The notion that its homologue is involved in validoxylamine formation is intriguing, but raises fundamental questions as to how a glycosyltransferase-like enzyme catalyzes a condensation of two nonsugar molecules. To gain insight into the catalytic function of VldE and its involvement in the coupling reaction, we cloned and heterologously expressed the gene in E. coli and characterized its biochemical activity. As the potential donor substrate GDP-valienol is relatively unstable, the compound was prepared in situ using VldB, valienol 1-phosphate, and GTP. In addition to these components, recombinant VldE and the synthetic amino-bearing cyclitol, either validamine or validamine 7-phosphate, were included in the reaction mixture (Scheme 2). The results showed that only the incubation containing GDP-valienol and validamine

7-phosphate gave a product (*m/z* 416 \[M + H\]⁺), which is consistent with the molecular mass of the expected product validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate (Figure 3G, and Figures S2 and S3). MS/MS analysis of the product gave fragment ions consistent with those observed in authentic validoxylamine A, except that most of the fragment ions of validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate are 80 amu higher than those of validoxylamine A, indicating the presence of a phosphate moiety in the former compound (Figure 3L). HR-ESTOFMS analysis of the product revealed a molecular formula of C₁₄H₂₆NO₁₁P, consistent with that of validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate. Reactions containing validamine did not give any corresponding product, suggesting that VldE does not recognize an unphosphorylated substrate (Figure S3).

Synthesis of Validoxylamine A 7′-Phosphate (26) and Confirmation of the VldE Product. To further confirm the product of VldE, we synthesized validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate (26) and compared the VldE product with the synthetic compound. The synthesis was carried out using validoxylamine A (8), which was prepared from acid hydrolysis of validamycin A (1), as starting material. Validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate (26) was previously synthesized by Davies and co-workers in 10 steps starting from 8. However, using a modified procedure, we were able to obtain 26 from 8 in 5 steps (Scheme 3). Thus, 8 was treated with benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal in the presence of *p*-TsOH to selectively protect the 4′- and 7′-hydroxy groups.

The product was then perbenzylated with benzyl bromide and NaH to give 28. Compound 28 was treated with DIBAL-H for selective acetal opening to give 29. The free alcohol functionality was then phosphorylated as described for the synthesis of validamine 7-phosphate (21) and the product was debenzylated using BBr₃ at −40 °C to give validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate (26). This compound was used as reference for the assay of VldE catalysis. HPLC, MS, and MS/MS analyses of the VldE product gave chromatographic and spectral data identical to those of the synthetic compound, confirming its identity as validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate (26).

Kinetic Properties of VldE. The kinetic properties of VldE were determined using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (PK/LDH) coupled colorimetric assay (Scheme 2). Reactions were initiated by addition of a saturating amount of either GDP-valienol (25) or validamine 7-phosphate (21), and the oxidation of NADH to NAD⁺, which is stoichiometrically equivalent to the production of GDP, was measured by the decrease in A₃₄₀. Compound 25 was obtained from valienol 1-phosphate (24) and GTP catalyzed by VldB and the concentration was determined using a coupled colorimetric assay containing inorganic pyrophosphatase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) [EnzChek Pyrophosphate Assay Kit (Molecular Probes)]. For the kinetic studies, a protein concentration of 1–3 μM, a pH of 7.5, and a reaction time of 1–3 min, which showed linear decrease of

absorbance, were chosen. The apparent kinetic values, obtained from Hanes-Woolf plots, were $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ 308.0 ± 34.5 μM and $k_{\mathrm{cat}}$ 7.0 ± 0.4 min⁻¹ for 21 and $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ 59.7 ± 11.9 μM and $k_{\mathrm{cat}}$ 7.0 ± 0.7 min⁻¹ for 25 (Figure 4).

VldE Is a Dedicated Pseudoglycosyltransferase. Whereas VldE is genetically similar to trehalose 6-phosphate synthases, it does not have any trehalose 6-phosphate synthase activity. Incubation of the enzyme with UDP- or GDP-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate did not give any product (Figure S5). The same result was observed when only one of the cyclitol derivatives was replaced by its glucose analogue (Figure S6). These results suggest that VldE is a dedicated pseudoglycosyltransferase that only recognizes GDP-valienol and validamine 7-phosphate as substrates, and not a trehalose 6-phosphate synthase with relaxed substrate specificity.

The E. coli Trehalose 6-Phosphate Synthase OtsA Does Not Recognize GDP-Valienol and Validamine 7-Phosphate as Substrates. To investigate if a trehalose 6-phosphate synthase can alternatively catalyze the formation of validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate, we cloned and expressed in E. coli the trehalose 6-phosphate synthase gene otsA and characterized its catalytic function. While the recombinant OtsA can catalyze the formation of trehalose 6-phosphate, the enzyme was not able to catalyze the formation of validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate (Figure S7). Replacements of GDP-valienol with UDP-/GDP-glucose or validamine 7-phosphate with glucose 6-phosphate did not give any hybrid products (Figure S8), indicating that OtsA does not recognize any activated cyclitols as substrate.

VldE Is Not a Validoxylamine A Glycosyltransferase. Interestingly, VldE has previously been reported as a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the glucosylation of validoxylamine A to give validamycin A. However, a wealth of evidence is available to conclude that another glycosyltransferase, ValG (VldK), is responsible for this conversion. Nevertheless, we explored the reported glycosyltransferase activity of VldE by incubating the enzyme with validoxylamine A and UDP-glucose and analyzing the product by ESIMS. No validamycin A could be identified in this reaction (Figure S9). The results confirmed the distinct role of VldE as a dedicated validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate synthase and not a validoxylamine A glycosyltransferase.

The Role of the Phosphatase VldH. The production of validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate by VldE suggests that a dephosphorylation reaction is necessary downstream in the pathway to provide a phosphate-free substrate for the glycosyltransferase ValG (VldK). The only candidate phosphatase gene within the cluster is vldH, which encodes a protein that has high identity with proteins from the haloacid dehalogenase-like superfamily, which includes L-2-haloacid dehalogenase, epoxide hydrolase, phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphomannomutase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, P-type ATPase, and many others. Interestingly, the G + C content of the vldH gene is only 60%, relatively low compared to that of other genes in the cluster (68–72%).

**Scheme 2. Biosynthetic Pathway to Validamycin A and Characterization of VldB, VldE, and VldH**

To investigate the function of VldH as a phosphatase, the recombinant protein was produced (Figure 2B) and co-incubated with VldB and VldE in the presence of valienol 1-phosphate, GTP, and validamine 7-phosphate (Scheme 2). The results showed that addition of VldH to the mixture resulted in a phosphate-free product, validoxylamine A ($m/z$ 336 [M + H]$^+$) (Figure 3D,I). In addition, MS/MS analysis of the product gave fragment ions identical to those of authentic validoxylamine A (Figure 3N,O), providing compelling evidence for the critical roles of VldB, VldE, and VldH in the formation of validoxylamine A. However, in contrast to VldE, VldH appears to have broader substrate permissiveness, as it could also convert trehalose 6-phosphate to trehalose (Figure S10). On the other hand, the trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase OtsB, which was recombinantly produced in *E. coli* (Figure 2B), does not dephosphorylate validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate (Figure S4), suggesting that the role of VldH in validamycin A biosynthesis cannot be assumed by OtsB.

### DISCUSSION

The biochemical analysis of VldB, VldE, and VldH and the establishment of their roles in validoxylamine A biosynthesis have opened up a new dimension in our understanding of pseudoglycoside biosynthesis. Particularly, the involvement of VldE and VldH, which resemble OtsA and OtsB, in validoxylamine A formation is evolutionarily and mechanistically intriguing. VldE might have evolved from an ancestral trehalose 6-phosphate synthase to the extent that it no longer recognizes activated sugars as substrates, but still retains some of the catalytic properties, including the net retention of the anomeric configuration of the product.

In addition, the use of the aminocyclitol unit as pseudosugar acceptor by VldE to form N-pseudoglycosyl linkage is a significant departure from the OtsA catalyzed reaction. In comparison to the O-glycosyltransferases such as OtsA, glycogen synthase, cellulose synthase, and others, N-glycosyltransferase enzymes are less abundant, but play significant roles in biological systems. Among the known N-glycosyltransferases are the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which catalyzes asparagine-linked glycosylation of proteins, and UGT72B1, a bifunctional N- and O-glycosyltransferase that is involved in xenobiotic metabolism in plants. Other N-glycosyltransferases that are involved in natural products biosynthesis include the indolocarbazole N-glycosyltransferases RebG and StaG and the ansamitocin N-glycosyltransferase Asm25. However, most, if not all, of these enzymes catalyze the formation of glycosidic bonds with inversion of configuration at the anomeric center of the sugar donors.

Whereas inverting glycosyltransferases generally operate through a direct displacement, S$_\text{N}$2-like mechanism, retaining glycosyltransferases are believed to function via either a two-step double-displacement mechanism or an internal return (S$_\text{Ni}$)-like mechanism, which is also known as a D$_\text{N}$$^*$A$_\text{Nss}$ ion pair mechanism. Structural studies of OtsA suggest that its activity is likely to occur via the latter mechanism. As VldE shares a high number of conserved active site residues with OtsA, they may have similar catalytic mechanisms. However, the question remains how a glycosyltransferase-like enzyme catalyzes a condensation of two nonglycosyl units with retention of stereochemistry. Whereas the detailed mechanism underlying this unique capability is yet to be determined, we believe that the olefinic moiety of GDP-valienol plays a critical role in facilitating the coupling.

reaction. This is somewhat analogous to the involvement of the allylic moiety in farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase-catalyzed reactions (Figure 5).²⁵,²⁶ In both VldE and FPP synthase, and also in glycosyltransferases, a nucleophilic substitution reaction takes place at a carbon center with a diphosphate or nucleotidyldiphosphate acting as leaving group. Therefore, it may be proposed that at the enzyme active site the π-electrons of the unsaturated cyclitol resonate to form stabilized short-lived ion.

pair intermediates similar to the oxocarbenium-ion like transition states and the diphosphate group acts as a base to deprotonate the ammonium (−NH₃⁺) group of validamine 7-phosphate. The primary amine then attacks the ‘pseudoanomeric’ carbon, leading to a product with retained configuration.

Adoption of the S<sub>N</sub>i-like mechanism in VldE catalysis, however, may have a consequence, as the ion pair intermediate could collapse to give back starting material, which may affect the rate constant of the enzyme.<sup>24</sup> In fact, we observed a rather low turnover rate of VldE as evidenced from the MS data and its kinetic values (*k*<sub>cat</sub>/*K*<sub>m</sub> 0.023 min⁻¹·μM⁻¹ for validamine 7-phosphate and *k*<sub>cat</sub>/*K*<sub>m</sub> 0.12 min⁻¹·μM⁻¹ for GDP-valienol). However, this observation might be circumstantial; therefore, a more detailed study is necessary to determine the catalytic mechanism of this unusual enzyme. Nevertheless, the results of the present study suggest that certain glycosyltransferase-like enzymes are capable of catalyzing coupling reactions between nonglycosidic allylic cation-forming donors and amino-bearing acceptors. Some, if not all, of them are similar to members of certain groups of glycosyltransferases, for example, VldE to trehalose 6-phosphate synthases (GT20 family) and AcbS/GacS to glycogen synthases (GT5 family),<sup>4,5</sup> suggesting that this poorly recognized class of enzymes may have evolved from or shared ancestral traits with known glycosyltransferases. Similar glycosyltransferase-like enzymes may be involved in the biosynthesis of other natural products, for example, the adiposins (3), salbostatin (4), the trestatins (5), the amylostatins (6), and

The vldB PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET20b (Novagen) to give pET20b-vldB. The vldE and vldH PCR fragments were digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into pRSET-B (Invitrogen) to give pRSET-B-vldE and pRSET-B-vldH. The DNA sequences of vldB, vldE, and vldH were confirmed by the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB) at Oregon State University.

OtsA and OtsB Expression Plasmid Construction. The otsA and otsB genes from E. coli MG1655 were amplified by PCR from plasmid pTrc99A-otsAB (a gift from Dr. C-J. Kim) using the following primer pairs: 5′-AGG CTC GAG GCA TAT GAG TCG TTT AGT CGT-3′ and 5′-GAC GAA TTC TCA CGC AAG CTT TGG AAA GGT-3′ for otsA, 5′-GAC CTC GAG ACA TAT GAC AGA ACC GTT AAC-3′ and 5′-GCA GAA TTC TCA GAT ACT ACG ACT AAA CGA-3′ for otsB (XhoI and EcoRI sites are underlined). The otsA and otsB PCR fragments were digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into pRSET-B (Invitrogen) to give pRSET-B-otsA and pRSET-B-otsB. DNA sequences of otsA and otsB were confirmed by CGRB.

VldB, VldE, and VldH Production and Purification. pET20-vldB, pRSETB-vldE and pRSETB-vldH were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS. Transformants were grown overnight at 37 °C on LB agar plate containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol. A single colony was inoculated into 3 mL of LB medium and cultured at 37 °C for 6 h and then 1 mL of seed culture was transferred into 100 mL of LB medium in a 500 mL flask and grown at 28 °C until OD₆₀₀ reached 0.6. Then, the temperature was reduced to 18 °C, and after 2 h of adaptation, 0.1 mM IPTG was added to induce the C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged VldB and the N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged VldE and VldH proteins. After further growth for 14 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and stored at –80 °C until used. Cell pellets from 50 mL of culture were washed with 1 mL of binding (B) buffer (40 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM imidazole) and centrifuged (6000 rpm, 3 min, 4 °C). Then, 1 mL of B buffer was added and the mixtures were sonicated (8 W, 15 s, 4 times). After centrifugation (14 500 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C), 0.8 mL of the supernatants was each mixed with 0.2 mL of B buffer-equilibrated Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 3 min, 4 °C) and the supernatants were discarded. One milliliter of washing (W) buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mM imidazole in the case of VldE and VldH or 100 mM imidazole in the case of VldB) was added and the mixture centrifuged (4000 rpm, 3 min, 4 °C). This washing step was repeated three times. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of elution (E) buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 500 mM imidazole) was added to elute the desired proteins. This elution step was repeated twice. Eluted VldB, VldE, and VldH were dialyzed against 1 L of dialysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl₂) 3 times for 3 h each. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon YM-10 (Millipore). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (BIO-RAD) with BSA as standard.

Coupled VldB/VldE Assay with ATP and GTP. To determine whether ATP or GTP is the natural nucleotidy donor in the coupled VldB/VldE reaction, VldB (1 μM) and VldE (3 μM) were incubated with 4 mM valienol 1-phosphate, 4 mM validamine 7-phosphate, 6 mM of either ATP or GTP, and 2 mM MgCl₂ in 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. Then, 2 vol of MeOH were added and mixed. The mixture was centrifuged (14 500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was subjected to MS analysis. The results revealed that GTP is used more effectively in the VldB/VldE coupled assay than ATP.

Combined VldB, VldE, and VldH Assay. Typical reaction condition for activity assays were 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mM valienol 1-phosphate; 6 mM NTPs; 2 mM MgCl₂; 1 μM VldB; 4 mM validamine 7-phosphate; 3 μM VldE; and 3 μM VldH. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. For enzyme inactivation, VldB, VldE, and VldH were heated at 100 °C for 5 min.

HPLC Analysis of VldB, VldE, and VldH Products. For HPLC analysis, the reaction was quenched by adding 2 vol of MeOH and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu SPD-20A system) with a Gemini C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm,

Phenomenex) using 0.5% MeOH in H₂O containing 10 mM NH₄HCO₃ as eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Elution profiles were monitored at 210 nm.

**High-Resolution Mass Spectral Analysis of VldB/VldE and VldB/VldE/VldH Products.** HR-ESTOFMS of the VldB/VldE product: *m/z* 416.1315 (calcd for C₁₄H₂₇NO₁₁P [M + H]⁺: 416.1322). HR-ESTOFMS of the VldB/VldE/VldH product: *m/z* 336.1657 (calcd for C₁₄H₂₆NO₈ [M + H]⁺: 336.1658).

**Preparation of GDP-Valienol for Kinetic Studies.** A reaction mixture (100 μL) containing 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 2 mM MgCl₂; 5 mM valienol 1-phosphate; 7.5 mM GTP; and 3 μM VldB was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h and VldB was removed by ultrafiltration (YM-10, Amicon). GDP-valienol formed in the reaction mixture was measured by quantification of the generated inorganic diphosphate generated using the EnzChek pyrophosphate assay kit (E-6645, Invitrogen). Reaction mixtures lacking VldB were used as negative control (blank).

**K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> Determination for VldE.** K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values for VldE were determined by using the phosphorylpyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) coupled assay (Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture (100 μL) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 5 mM MgCl₂; 1.0–3.0 μM VldE; 1.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate; 0.5 mM NADH; 37 U of PK; and 46 U of LDH, in addition to 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 300, 600 μM GDP-valienol and 1 mM validamine 7-phosphate for the determination of the value for GDP-valienol, and 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 1000 μM validamine 7-phosphate and 300 μM GDP-valienol for the determination of the value for validamine 7-phosphate. Oxidation of NADH to NAD⁺ was monitored in 96-well plates using a spectrophotometric microplate reader at 340 nm. Reaction mixtures lacking VldE were used as negative control (blank). The data were collected in duplicate (for GDP-valienol) and triplicate (for validamine 7-phosphate). Hanes-Woolf plot was used for K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> value determination.

**Assay of VldE for Trehalose 6-Phosphate Synthase Activity.** To determine if VldE has trehalose 6-phosphate synthase activity, the enzyme (6 μM) was incubated with 1 mM donor substrate (either GDP-valienol, UDP-glucose, or GDP-glucose), 1 mM acceptor substrate (either validamine 7-phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate), 2 mM MgCl₂, 16 μM VldH or OtsB in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After a 3-h incubation at 30 °C, 2 vol of MeOH were added and mixed. The mixture was centrifuged (14 500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was subjected to MS analysis. The results revealed that VldE does not recognize UDP-glucose, GDP-glucose, or glucose 6-phosphate as substrates.

**OtsA and OtsB Production and Purification.** The productions and purifications of N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged OtsA and OtsB were carried out by the same procedures as used for VldE and VldH.

**Assay of OtsA for Validoxylamine A 7′-Phosphate Synthase Activity.** To determine if OtsA has validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate synthase activity, the enzyme (6 μM) was incubated with 1 mM donor substrate (either GDP-valienol or UDP-glucose), 1 mM acceptor substrate (either validamine 7-phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate), 5 mM MgCl₂, 16 μM OtsB or VldH in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After 3 h incubation at 30 °C, 2 vol of MeOH were added and mixed. The mixture was centrifuged (14 500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was subjected to MS analysis. The results revealed that OtsA does not recognize GDP-valienol and validamine 7-phosphate as substrates.

**Characterization of OtsB and VldH as Trehalose 6-Phosphate Phosphatases.** To determine if VldH has trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase activity, the enzyme (8 μM) was incubated with 5 mM trehalose 6-phosphate, and 10 mM MgCl₂ in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). OtsB was used as positive control. After 1.5 h incubation at 30 °C, 2 vol of MeOH were added and mixed. The mixture was centrifuged (14 500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was subjected to MS analysis. The results revealed that VldH was able to catalyze dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate to give trehalose.

**Assay of VldE for Validoxylamine A Glycosyltransferase Activity.** To determine if VldE can catalyze the glycosylation of validoxylamine A to validamycin A, the enzyme (50 μM) was incubated with 1 mM validoxylamine A, 1 mM UDP-glucose, 10 mM MgCl₂, and 10 mM NH₄Cl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After 3 h incubation at 30 °C, 2 vol of MeOH were added and mixed. The mixture was centrifuged (14 500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was subjected to MS analysis. The results show that VldE is not a validoxylamine A glycosyltransferase.
