## Transcriptional architecture of the mammalian circadian clock

### Joseph S. Takahashi

**Abstract** | Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that control 24-hour physiological and behavioural processes in organisms. These cell-autonomous clocks are composed of a transcription–translation-based autoregulatory feedback loop. With the development of next-generation sequencing approaches, biochemical and genomic insights into circadian function have recently come into focus. Genome-wide analyses of the clock transcriptional feedback loop have revealed a global circadian regulation of processes such as transcription factor occupancy, RNA polymerase II recruitment and initiation, nascent transcription, and chromatin remodelling. The genomic targets of circadian clocks are pervasive and are intimately linked to the regulation of metabolism, cell growth and physiology.

### Convergent evolution
The process by which unrelated organisms independently evolve similar traits as a result of adapting to similar environments or selective pressures.

### Network motif
As defined by Uri Alon, a small set of recurring regulatory patterns in a network.

### Oscillations
Repetitive variations of variables over time with a stable frequency or period.

Energetic cycles governed by the solar day have driven the evolution of life on Earth. To adapt and respond optimally to the daily environmental cycles, living systems utilize internal timing systems that resonate with the 24-hour day¹ (FIG. 1a,b). Across life forms, the internal timing system can be seen at the transcriptional level, giving rise to divergent gene networks in different organisms that oscillate on a 24-hour basis². Circadian clocks, as these endogenous timers are known, seem to be the product of convergent evolution, as the design principles of circadian transcriptional circuits share a common network motif³ (that is, negative feedback with delay (FIG. 1c)), although the specific components are divergent across the kingdoms of life⁴⁻⁷. The link to the daily solar energetic cycle is most obvious in photosynthetic organisms⁸ but is also a conserved motif in the nutrient cycles of higher organisms⁹⁻¹¹. Whether circadian clocks evolved to adapt to the energetic demands of the environment or to avoid the detrimental consequences of solar radiation remains a topic of debate¹,⁶,¹¹.

Irrespective of why circadian clocks evolved, it is evident today that cell-autonomous clocks are ubiquitous. In mammals, for example, the neuro-centric view of a master clock located only in the brain is no longer viable. Instead, the discovery of clock genes¹² in the 1990s showed that virtually all cells express these genes and have the capacity to generate circadian oscillations¹³,¹⁴. The circadian clock in mammals is now conceptualized as a hierarchical system in which a clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus acts as a master pacemaker to synchronize or entrain peripheral clocks distributed throughout the body¹⁵⁻¹⁹ (FIG. 1d). This system-wide architecture raises the following questions: how is this hierarchy coupled and integrated? And what are the functions of clocks in tissue-specific and cell-specific contexts?

The molecular mechanism of the circadian clock in mammals is generated by a cell-autonomous transcriptional autoregulatory feedback loop. The core clock genes include *CLOCK* and *BMAL1*, which encode activators, and *PER1*, *PER2*, *CRY1* and *CRY2*, which encode repressors. Current topics of active investigation include the components of this core circadian clock gene network, how environmental and systemic inputs impinge on the core clock mechanism²⁰,²¹, and how the core clock network regulates downstream output pathways. Recent work has provided insight into the genomic targets of the core clock pathway and has led to some surprises concerning the pervasiveness of circadian regulation in gene expression. A substantial fraction (~5–20%) of genes expressed in any particular cell or tissue have been found to undergo circadian oscillations at the mRNA level²²; however, this level of regulation (that is, steady-state mRNA rhythms) is only one of a multitude of layers of circadian regulation in gene expression. Virtually every regulatory stage in gene expression that has been examined in detail — including transcription, splicing, termination, polyadenylation, nuclear export, microRNA regulation, translation and RNA degradation — has revealed additional layers of circadian control²³,²⁴. Thus, both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of circadian gene expression are key nodal points of control.

Our understanding of the mechanism of the circadian clock in mammals has been informed by progress on two fronts: first, by the biochemical definition of components of circadian activator and repressor complexes,

and, second, by the structural determination of key domains of clock proteins (BOX 1). This Review focuses on the molecular, biochemical and genomic advances in our understanding of circadian regulation in mammals. I highlight work on the genomic targets of the core circadian transcriptional pathway, as well as studies revealing global circadian oscillations in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-mediated transcription and their relation to the dynamic circadian regulation of chromatin state and chromatin modifiers. For non-mammalian model systems and aspects of circadian biology focused on photic regulation, metabolism and immunity, there are other excellent reviews^{8,25-37}.

E-boxes  
Also known as enhancer boxes, these are short DNA regulatory elements in some eukaryotic promoters that act as binding sites for transcription factors and have thus been found to regulate gene expression. For CLOCK-BMAL1, the consensus sequence for this cis-regulatory element is CACGTG.

The core circadian clock gene network  
Core components of the mammalian circadian clock.  
In mammals, the mechanism of the circadian clock consists of the activators CLOCK (and its paralogue NPAS2) and its heterodimeric partner BMAL1 (also known as ARNTL), which are basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH)-PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) transcription factors^{38,39}. The CLOCK–BMAL1 complex binds to regulatory elements containing E-boxes in a set of rhythmic genes that encode the repressor proteins period (encoded by PER1, PER2 and PER3) and cryptochrome (encoded by CRY1 and CRY2)^{39-41} (FIG. 2). In mice, CLOCK–BMAL1 activation occurs in the daytime, leading to the transcription of the

Box 1 | Structural biology of clock proteins

Structural biology will have an essential role in achieving a mechanistic understanding of clock function ${ }^{154,155}$. The 3D structures of several circadian proteins and their complexes have been solved using X-ray crystallography. These structures include the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH), PAS-A and PAS-B domains of the heterodimeric transcriptional activator complex CLOCK–BMAL1 (Protein Data Bank identifier: 4F3L) ${ }^{156}$ (see the figure, part a); the PAS-A and PAS-B domains of the mammalian period (PER) proteins ${ }^{157,158}$; the photolyase homology region (PHR) of mammalian cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) ${ }^{159}$; the PHR of CRY2 in complex with the F-box protein FBXL3 (REF. 160); and the PER2-CBD (CRY-binding domain) in complex with CRY1 (REF. 161) or CRY2 (PDB ID: 4U8H) ${ }^{162}$ (see the figure, part b).

The structure of the CLOCK–BMAL1 complex is asymmetric, with CLOCK wrapping around BMAL1. The PAS-A and PAS-B domains of the two subunits interact with their complementary domains but with two different interfaces: the PAS-A domains have symmetrical interactions involving the β-sheet surfaces, whereas the PAS-B domains have a head-to-tail interaction in which the β-sheet surface of BMAL1 interacts with the α-helical surface of CLOCK. The PAS-A and PAS-B domain configuration of BMAL1 (REF. 156) (but not CLOCK) is identical to that seen in the PAS-A and PAS-B domains of the mammalian PER proteins ${ }^{157,158}$, indicating that PER could interact with CLOCK and replace BMAL1 (REF. 163). Interestingly, a crystal structure of another member of the bHLH–PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) heterodimeric protein family, HIF2α (also known as EPAS-1)-ARNT, reveals a completely different overall domain arrangement compared to CLOCK–BMAL1. However, specific domain interface interactions are preserved between the respective bHLH, PAS-A and PAS-B domains of the two subunits ${ }^{164}$ (see REF. 165 for a comparison of these bHLH–PAS structures). The recognition of the CACGTG E-box DNA-binding motif of the CLOCK–BMAL1 bHLH region is similar to that seen for other bHLH proteins ${ }^{166}$.

The crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 have been determined in five functional states: 1) the PHR by itself (apo); 2) the FAD-bound CRY2 PHR; 3) the CRY2–FBXL3–SKP1 complex; 4) the KL001-bound CRY2 PHR; and 5) CRY2 in complex with PER2-CBD ${ }^{160,162,167}$. Both the CRY1 and CRY2 apo structures adopt the canonical photolyase fold and can be aligned most closely to the Drosophila (6–4) photolyase ${ }^{159,160}$. However, unlike (6–4) photolyases and cryptochromes from plants and *Drosophila melanogaster*, the mammalian CRY1 and CRY2 PHRs do not have the FAD cofactor bound. In CRY2, FAD can bind with low affinity, and the FAD-binding pocket has a more open conformation, perhaps explaining the lower affinity for FAD ${ }^{160}$. CRY2 in complex with FBXL3 reveals an extensive interface with the FBXL3 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Moreover, most interestingly, the carboxy-terminal tail of FBXL3 inserts into the FAD-binding pocket, revealing a novel substrate recognition motif by the SCF ${ }^{\mathrm{FBXL} 3}$ ubiquitin ligase ${ }^{160}$. The small-molecule stabilizer of CRY, KL001 (REF. 168), binds to the FAD pocket, but also extends beyond the pocket where the FBXL3 C-terminal tail enters; this binding therefore blocks the FBXL3–CRY interaction to stabilize CRY ${ }^{167}$. Finally, the known interaction between CRY and PER proteins, which mutually stabilize one another, has been illuminated by the recent crystal structures of the CRY1–PER2-CBD ${ }^{161}$ and CRY2–PER2-CBD ${ }^{162}$ complexes. The PER2-CBD forms an extended conformation on CRY2 that begins at a secondary pocket critical for CLOCK–BMAL1 binding and winds around the CRY2 C-terminal helix to sterically hinder the recognition of CRY2 by the SCF ${ }^{\mathrm{FBXL} 3}$ ubiquitin ligase (see the figure, part b). Thus, the overlapping interfaces on CRY2 for PER2-CBD and FBXL3 provide a structural basis for the competition of PER proteins and FBXL3 for controlling the stability of CRY ${ }^{162}$.

The existing crystal structures raise the question of how PER and CRY interact with CLOCK–BMAL1 as a quaternary complex. In different contexts, CRY1 can interact directly with CLOCK–BMAL1 without PER in vitro ${ }^{169}$, although in other experiments PER has been shown to be essential for interaction with CLOCK–BMAL1 in vivo ${ }^{163}$. It seems probable that PER is involved in reducing the occupancy of CLOCK–BMAL1 on DNA ${ }^{170}$ as seen in *D. melanogaster* ${ }^{171}$, whereas CRY1 may be able to repress CLOCK–BMAL1 on DNA ${ }^{170,172}$. Because the native (CLOCK–BMAL1)–(PER–CRY) quaternary complexes are megadalton in size and involve other interacting proteins, and important domains of these proteins are intrinsically disordered, the solving of these complexes will probably require a combination of crystallography, NMR and cryoelectron microscopy methods.

Figure 2 | The circadian gene network in mammals. At the core of the network, the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH)–PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 activate the Per1, Per2, Cry1 and Cry2 genes, whose protein products interact and repress their own transcription. The stability of the period (PER) and cryptochrome (CRY) proteins are regulated by parallel E3 ubiquitin ligase pathways. CLOCK and BMAL1 also regulate the nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ (encoded by Nr1d1 and Nr1d2, respectively), which rhythmically repress the transcription of Bmal1 and Nfil3 (which encodes nuclear factor, interleukin-3 regulated) that is driven by the activators retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-α (RORα) and RORβ (encoded by Rora and Rorb, respectively). NFIL3 in turn represses the PAR-bZip factor DBP (D-box binding protein) to regulate a rhythm in the ROR nuclear receptors. These three interlocked transcriptional feedback loops represent the three major transcriptional regulators of the majority of cycling genes. Different combinations of these factors generate different phases of transcriptional rhythms, as exemplified by the graph (top right) showing the RNA profiles of Dbp, Per2, Cry1 and Bmal1 in the mouse liver. Additional rhythmic output genes (so-called clock-controlled genes or Ccgs) are transcriptionally regulated by the three loops acting on E-boxes, RevDR2 and ROR-binding elements (ROREs) and D-boxes in the regulatory regions of target genes.

declines and the PER and CRY protein levels decrease; the half-lives of PER and CRY proteins are relatively short and specific E3 ligase complexes target these proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome<sup>43,45</sup>. Once negative-feedback repression is relieved by turnover of the repressor complex, transcription by CLOCK–BMAL1 can begin anew to start a new cycle of transcription the next morning. Importantly, core clock genes, such as those that encode PER2 and its regulatory kinase CK1δ, have been found to underlie human sleep-timing disorders<sup>46,47</sup>, thus demonstrating a clear role for clock genes in humans (BOX 2).

In addition to the *PER* and *CRY* target genes, the CLOCK–BMAL1 complex also activates the nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ (encoded by *NR1D1* and *NR1D2*, respectively), which compete at RevDR2 and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-binding elements (ROREs) with RORα, RORβ and RORγ (encoded by *RORA*, *RORB* and *RORC*, respectively)<sup>48–50</sup> (FIG. 2). The rhythmic expression of REV-ERBα and REV-ERβ leads to the repression of *BMAL1* and *CLOCK*, which induces a rhythm in these genes that is in anti-phase with *PER* expression rhythms<sup>48</sup>. These interlocked feedback loops of activators and repressors form a canonical positive-feedback and negative-feedback gene network motif<sup>51</sup>. A third CLOCK–BMAL1-driven transcriptional loop involves the PAR-bZip (proline and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper) factors DBP (D-box binding protein), TEF (thyrotroph embryonic factor) and HLF (hepatic leukaemia factor). These proteins interact at sites containing D-boxes with the repressor NFIL3 (nuclear factor, interleukin-3 regulated; also known as E4BP4), which is driven by the

REV-ERB–ROR loop<sup>52,53</sup> (FIG. 2). Together, these three interlocking transcriptional feedback loops can generate cycles of transcription with various phases of expression depending on the combination of *cis*-elements (that is, E-boxes, ROREs and D-boxes) in the promoters and enhancers of specific target genes<sup>54</sup> (FIG. 2).

Core clock protein interactions with chromatin and chromatin-modifying complexes. At the beginning of the transcription cycle, the activators CLOCK and BMAL1 interact with the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), respectively, to acetylate histones and provide an accessible chromatin state for transcription<sup>55–58</sup>. CLOCK has been reported to have intrinsic HAT activity and to acetylate histone H3 on Lys9 (H3K9) and Lys14 residues (H3K14)<sup>59,60</sup>. The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) associates with CLOCK, BMAL1 and PER2 (REFS 61,62), and a circadian rhythm in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels driven by the expression of the CLOCK–BMAL1 target gene *Nampt* in turn leads to a rhythm in SIRT1 activity that feeds back to inhibit the CLOCK–BMAL1 complex<sup>63,64</sup>.

CLOCK and BMAL1 have also been shown to be associated with the methyltransferase MLL1 (mixed lineage leukaemia 1)<sup>65</sup>. Interestingly, MLL1 interacts with the Δ19 activation domain of CLOCK and is thought to be important for the recruitment of CLOCK to DNA<sup>65</sup>. Moreover, MLL1 is associated with rhythmic H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3)<sup>65</sup>, a common histone marker associated with active gene promoters. In addition, MLL1 is acetylated and the metabolic regulator SIRT1 rhythmically deacetylates MLL1, thereby affecting its methyltransferase activity<sup>66</sup>. The related methyltransferase MLL3 exhibits circadian occupancy and is associated with promoters bearing rhythmic H3K4me3 marks; however, MLL3 recruitment to DNA does not depend on BMAL1 or CLOCK<sup>67</sup>.

CLOCK and BMAL1 also interact with the lysine-specific histone demethylases JARID1A and LSD1, which are both thought to promote the recruitment of CLOCK–BMAL1 to *PER* promoters to enhance transcription<sup>68,69</sup>. BMAL1 interacts with TRAP150 (thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 150), a co-activator that promotes CLOCK–BMAL1 binding to circadian target genes and links CLOCK–BMAL1 to the Mediator complex subunit MED1 to recruit the general transcriptional machinery<sup>70</sup>. RNAPII is both recruited and initiated on a circadian basis as discussed in more detail below<sup>71,72</sup>.

During the transition from activation to repression, the CLOCK–BMAL1 complex interacts with the PER–CRY repressor complex at the beginning of the night as the levels of PER and CRY accumulate and translocate to the nucleus<sup>42</sup>. The PER complex is large and contains at least 25 proteins<sup>73–75</sup>. Initially, CLOCK and BMAL1 are associated with two components of the Mi-2–nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase (NuRD) transcriptional co-repressor complex: CHD4 (chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4) and MTA2 (metastasis-associated 1 family member 2).

Box 2 | Human genetics of clock genes

Validation of the core circadian transcriptional mechanism elucidated in rodents (FIG. 2) has come from the Mendelian disorder familial advanced sleep phase disorder (FASPD), in which the timing of sleep–wake cycles in affected individuals are shifted several hours earlier than normal<sup>173</sup>. Dominant mutations in the genes that encode period 2 (*PER2*) and the serine/threonine kinases casein kinase 1δ (*CSNK1D*) have been shown to be linked to FASPD and to be causative in humans<sup>46,47</sup>. In large-scale human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for fasting glucose levels and increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, common variants in the *MTNR1B* locus, which encodes melatonin receptor 1B, and in *CRY2*, which encodes cryptochrome 2, have been documented<sup>174–177</sup>. Melatonin signalling is a major output pathway of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals, and levels of melatonin are circadian, with high levels during night-time and low levels during daytime<sup>178</sup>, reflecting a physiological signal of darkness. The *MTNR1B* mutations have been proposed to act in pancreatic islets to impair insulin secretion, but this hypothesis remains a subject of debate<sup>179–181</sup>. Recently, large-scale GWAS for morningness and sleep-timing preference (chronotype) have identified several genes known to be associated with circadian rhythms in animals<sup>182–184</sup>. These genes include *RGS16*, a regulator of G protein signalling that is enriched in the SCN and has a long period phenotype with a loss-of-function mutation<sup>185</sup>; the core clock gene *PER2*; *VIP* (which encodes vasoactive intestinal polypeptide), a neuropeptide in the SCN involved in oscillator coupling<sup>186</sup>; *HCRT2*, the receptor for hypocretin or orexin that is linked to narcolepsy in humans and dogs<sup>187</sup>; and *FBXL3*, an F-box protein that is the recognition domain for an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that degrades the CRY proteins<sup>86</sup>. GWAS using sleep duration as a phenotype have identified a few loci (*PAX8*, *VRK2* and *UFL1*)<sup>183,188,189</sup>, but their relation to sleep mechanisms remains obscure. Overall, it is reassuring that numerous GWAS hits are associated with genes with known circadian and sleep functions, thus fortifying the notion that circadian transcriptional mechanisms are likely to apply to human biology.

Interestingly, PER complexes without CLOCK–BMAL1 lack CHD4 and MTA2 but contain other members of the NuRD complex, such as MBD2 (methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2), GATAD2A (GATA zinc finger domain-containing protein 2A), HDAC1 and RBAP48 (retinoblastoma-binding protein p48)⁷⁵. This finding indicates that during this transition phase there is a split NuRD complex that then comes together to form a reconstituted NuRD co-repressor complex to inhibit CLOCK–BMAL1 transcription. The CLOCK–BMAL1 complex also recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), leading to the trimethylation of H3K27 at target genes and thereby inhibiting gene expression⁷⁶,⁷⁷. In addition, CLOCK–BMAL1 recruits the DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1)–cullin 4 (CUL4) ubiquitin ligase complex to circadian target genes to promote H2B monoubiquitylation at E-box sites to covalently mark genes for subsequent recruitment of the PER complex⁷⁸. At the peak of repression during the middle of the night, the PER complex is also associated with the transcriptional repressor complexes SIN3–HDAC⁷⁹ and HP1γ–SUV39H histone methyltransferase⁸⁰, which contribute to CLOCK–BMAL1 repression through the deacetylation of histone H3K9 and H4K5 as well as dimethylation and trimethylation of H3K9. The PER repressor complex also includes NONO, a protein involved in RNA processing, and WDR5, a component of a histone methyltransferase complex⁷³. At later times during the repression phase, PER complexes include the RNA helicases DDX5 and DHX9, as well as the large subunit of RNAPII and SETX, a helicase that promotes transcriptional termination⁷⁴. Thus, the recruitment of several chromatin-modifying complexes as co-repressors is necessary for PER-mediated and probably CRY-mediated repression of CLOCK–BMAL1. During the circadian cycle, transcriptional activation and repression are accompanied by dynamic epigenetic transitions in chromatin state that poise the genome for rhythmic gene expression.

kinase (AMPK)-mediated phosphorylation, which provides a link to metabolism via nutrient-responsive AMPK activity⁸⁸.

The stability and turnover of PER proteins is primarily regulated by several mechanisms, including by CK1δ and CK1ε⁴³,⁸¹,⁸⁴,⁸⁹, by the balance between these two protein kinases and phosphatase 1 (REF. 90), and by the stoichiometry of PER proteins and these kinases⁹¹,⁹². Recent work has shown that a dual kinase, multisite phosphoswitch regulates PER stability and its ubiquitylation by the β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex⁹³.

For CRY proteins, their stability and turnover are regulated by the balance of the two paralogues FBXL3 and FBXL21 (REFS 94, 95) (FIG. 2). Contrary to expectation, FBXL21 antagonizes FBXL3 to reduce the E3 ligase activity of SCF<sup>FBXL3</sup> on CRY1 and CRY2 to stabilize them⁹⁵. Although SCF<sup>FBXL21</sup> does possess E3 ligase activity, it is less efficient than SCF<sup>FBXL3</sup> in the ubiquitylation of CRY⁹⁵. However, FBXL21 interacts more strongly with CRY than FBXL3, which protects CRY from SCF<sup>FBXL3</sup> activity⁹⁵. The subcellular localization of FBXL3 and FBXL21 also differ, with FBXL3 acting as the primary E3 ligase for CRY in the nucleus, whereas FBXL21 acts as the primary E3 ligase for CRY in the cytoplasm⁹⁵. Finally, in genetic experiments exploring the interaction of the CK1ε<sup>tau</sup> mutant with the FBXL3<sup>Afh</sup> mutant, a broad range of periodicities were seen depending on the combination of alleles⁹⁶, indicating that the PER and CRY pathways independently affect the ultimate period length *in vivo*.

### Genome-wide clock architecture

Although previous work has examined the transcriptional regulation of CLOCK–BMAL1 target genes such as *Dbp*, *Per1* and *Nr1d1* in detail, the identity of the circadian cistrome has only been recently defined. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), several research groups have identified genome-wide DNA-binding sites for BMAL1, CLOCK, NPAS2, PER1, PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 in mouse liver during the circadian cycle⁷¹,⁹⁷⁻¹⁰⁰.

#### Regulation of circadian period length by repressor stability

The stability of the core repressor proteins is an important determining factor in the dynamics of the transcriptional feedback loop, which in turn regulates the period length of the oscillation. The stability of PER and CRY is regulated by their phosphorylation state and by their ubiquitylation by E3 ligase complexes (FIG. 2). For example, the tau mutation in *CSNK1E* (which encodes CK1ε) shortens the circadian period length *in vivo*⁸¹. Moreover, this mutation causes the destabilization of PER proteins by phosphorylating a regulatory site that marks the PER proteins for ubiquitylation by β-TrCP (also known as F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 1A) and proteasomal degradation⁴³,⁸²⁻⁸⁴. By contrast, mutations in the gene encoding the F-box protein FBXL3, which is one of four subunits of the SCF (SKP1–cullin–F-box protein) E3 ligase complex, lengthen the circadian period and stabilize the CRY proteins by decreasing ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation⁸⁵⁻⁸⁷. In addition, CRY ubiquitylation by SCF<sup>FBXL3</sup> is triggered by 5′ AMP-activated protein

#### Genomic targets of the core circadian activators

Occupancy of CLOCK–BMAL1 at the *Dbp* locus, which encodes a transcription factor that modulates the expression of clock output genes, is circadian, with peak binding occurring during the middle of the day¹⁰¹. At the single-cell level, CLOCK and BMAL1 recruitment to E-boxes in *Dbp* are interdependent and circadian¹⁰². BMAL1 binding is dynamic and stochastic, and fluctuations in binding depend on the proteasome¹⁰², which is consistent with a ‘kamikaze’ model of transcriptional activation¹⁰³. On a genome-wide level, CLOCK and BMAL1 occupancy also peak within a narrow window of time during the middle of the day, and the phasing of CLOCK–BMAL1 occupancy is not tightly phase-locked with the RNA expression of their target genes⁷¹,⁹⁷,⁹⁸. This flexible phase relationship can be partially explained by the combinatorial action of other *cis*-acting elements (ROREs and D-boxes) within the tripartite clock gene network⁵⁴ (FIG. 2). For example, *Cry1* expression, which

In an effort to view the dynamics of the occupancy of the core circadian activator complexes in a genome-wide context, one study assessed all core clock proteins in the mouse liver<sup>71</sup>. At *Per1*, the activators BMAL1 and CLOCK bind in a cyclic manner at the promoter between circadian time zero (CT0) and CT12, with maximal binding observed at CT8 (FIG. 3a). In genome-wide analyses, CLOCK and BMAL1 bind to more than 4,600 and 5,900 sites, respectively, corresponding to ~3,000 unique genes in the liver<sup>71</sup> (FIG. 3b). At highly expressed target genes, CLOCK–BMAL1 DNA-binding motifs are enriched for a tandem E-box motif<sup>97</sup>. Native liver extracts showed that CLOCK–BMAL1 bind to tandem E-box sites cooperatively with higher affinity to more effectively compete with other E-box-binding factors such as USF1 (upstream stimulatory factor 1)<sup>105</sup>.

Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq). A nuclear run-on assay method that captures nascent transcripts from initiated RNA polymerase II followed by next-generation sequencing.

Zeitgeber time (ZT). A standard of time based on the period of an environmental synchronizer or zeitgeber, such as the 24-hour diurnal cycle of light and darkness. Under standard light–dark cycles, the time of 'lights on' usually defines zeitgeber time zero (ZT0) for diurnal organisms and the time of 'lights off' defines ZT12 for nocturnal animals.

Nascent-seq Next-generation sequencing of nascent RNA transcripts based on chromatin-associated RNA transcripts, nuclear run-on global transcripts, such as GRO-seq or PRO-seq, or RNA sequencing of transcripts immunoprecipitated with RNA polymerase II.

The hepatic steroid receptor co-activator 2 (SRC2; also known as N-CoA2) is recruited to DNA in a diurnal cycle and overlaps extensively with CLOCK-BMAL1 sites<sup>106</sup>. SRC2 acts as a potent transcriptional co-activator of CLOCK–BMAL1, and null Src2 mutations in mice lead to an abnormally early phase of the activity rhythm<sup>106</sup>, indicating that SRC2 has a role within the circadian clock system.

In addition to the liver, the circadian cistrome has recently been described in mouse pancreatic islets<sup>107</sup>. In a comparison of the occupancy of BMAL1 between the liver and pancreas, ~40% of the target genes overlapped, with disparate binding sites clustering at distal regulatory regions of tissue-specific genes. Interestingly, even within the overlapping set of target genes, BMAL1 was found to bind to distinct enhancers in the liver and pancreas<sup>107</sup>, consistent with the existence of tissue-specific circadian *cis*-regulatory modules<sup>108</sup>.

Genomic targets of the core circadian repressors. In contrast to the activators, the repressors PER1, PER2 and CRY2 bind genome-wide at night between CT12 and CT20, peaking between CT15 and CT17 (REF. 71) (FIG. 3b). CRY1 has a bimodal pattern, with a major peak at CT0 (FIG. 3b). The repressors CRY1 and CRY2 bind to significantly more sites in the genome than PER1 and PER2, with many thousands of these sites being independent of CLOCK–BMAL1 and containing DNA-binding motifs for nuclear receptors<sup>71</sup> (FIG. 3c). Consistent with this finding, CRY1 interacts with several nuclear receptors and is a co-repressor for the glucocorticoid receptor<sup>109</sup>. The nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ also occupy DNA rhythmically, with a peak in the daytime<sup>110,111</sup>. REV-ERBα competes with RORα for DNA binding at RORE and RevDR2 sites to regulate circadian target genes such as *Bmal1* and *Cry1*, where it recruits nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (N-CoR) and HDAC3 to repress gene expression<sup>50,111</sup>. Interestingly, REV-ERBα also interacts at other genomic sites that are enriched for tissue-specific transcription factors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) in the liver<sup>50</sup>. At these sites, the action of REV-ERBα is independent of its DNA-binding domain and defines a different set of target genes that are directly involved in metabolism. Finally, SRC2 has been proposed to modulate an oscillation in chromatin accessibility — by recruiting PBAF (polybromo-associated Brg/Brahma-associated factors) members of the SWI–SNF (switch–sucrose non-fermentable) complex — to promote REV-ERB loading

and enhance the amplitude of circadian gene expression<sup>112</sup>. Thus, the circadian cistrome is highly dynamic and involves the core circadian E-box transcriptional regulators and is interlinked via REV-ERBα/β as well as DBP and NFIL3 to secondary and tertiary gene targets with a wide range of phases of gene expression.

Genome-wide circadian RNA expression. To examine the functional consequences of the circadian cistrome, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to profile cycling genes in the mouse liver<sup>71,98,99</sup>. For example, using both the intron RNA signal as a proxy for pre-mRNA and the exon RNA signal as a proxy for mRNA<sup>113,114</sup>, strand-specific whole-transcriptome RNA-seq revealed a robust circadian oscillation at the *Dbp* and *Per2* genes<sup>71</sup>. As was previously observed in microarray experiments, thousands of genes cycle at the steady-state mRNA level in the liver as well as in many other tissues<sup>22,115</sup>. As more regions in the mouse have been profiled, more than half of all genes have been found to cycle at the mRNA level in at least one tissue<sup>22</sup>. Importantly, the identified cycling genes are enriched for drug targets; more than half of the top selling 100 drugs on the market in the United States have a circadian target gene<sup>22</sup>. This finding emphasizes the importance of optimizing the timing of drug administration for circadian drug targets, which can both enhance efficacy while at the same time reduce side effects.

A wide range of cycling RNA species has been found using RNA-seq. In addition to cycling protein-coding transcripts, oscillating long intergenic non-coding RNA, microRNA and antisense RNA transcripts have been found in the mouse liver<sup>71,98,99,116</sup>. Using Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq)<sup>117</sup> to identify enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcripts<sup>118</sup>, thousands of oscillating enhancers have been found, and the phase of these cycling eRNAs corresponds with the phases of transcription of nearby genes<sup>119</sup>. A motif analysis of cycling enhancers at different circadian phases revealed that there was phase-specific enrichment of transcription factor motifs and that four sets of motifs were enriched at different times<sup>119</sup>. E-box motifs were enriched between zeitgeber time six (ZT6) and ZT9, corresponding to the peak of CLOCK–BMAL1 occupancy. D-box motifs were enriched between ZT9 and ZT15, corresponding to the expression of *Dbp* and the low point of *Nfil3* repression. RORE and REV-DR2 motifs were enriched between ZT18 and ZT24, corresponding with the low point of REV-ERB repression of the RORs. ETS (E26 transformation-specific)-binding motifs were enriched between ZT0 and ZT3 (REF. 119), which may correspond to GM129 (also known as circadian-associated transcriptional repressor or CHRONO) repression<sup>120–122</sup>. Overall, the circadian cistromic results agree well with their transcriptional readouts as assessed by eRNA and gene expression analysis: the tripartite core circadian transcriptional feedback loop (E-box, D-box and RORE) drives the majority of circadian gene expression on a genome-wide level.

Using whole-transcriptome RNA-seq or nascent-seq combined with mRNA-seq, two divergent sets of cycling genes have been found: cycling nascent transcripts

and cycling mRNA levels^{71,98} (FIG. 4a). Only ~20% of cycling mRNAs also had a corresponding cycling nascent transcript^{71,98}, indicating that other RNA processes are likely to be contributing to steady-state circadian mRNA expression (FIG. 4b). Several different classes of cycling transcripts have been observed, including the following: first, cycling transcription and cycling steady-state mRNA; second, cycling transcription and no cycling mRNA; and third, no detectable cycling transcription, but cycling mRNA levels. The first class is typical for the core circadian genes and their high-amplitude direct targets. The second class is typically seen in highly expressed genes in the liver that have mRNAs with long half-lives, such as albumin. The third class represents transcripts that could become rhythmic via circadian variation in mRNA turnover, RNA splicing^{123}, polyadenylation^{124}, microRNA regulation^{116} and other post-transcriptional steps. Whether rhythmic translation or protein levels ultimately occur has also been revealing. For example, rhythmic diurnal polyadenylation occurs in 2.3% of expressed genes in the liver, and one-fifth of these genes (third class) lead to rhythmic protein expression that correlate with polyA tail length in the absence of rhythmic mRNA levels^{124}. Ribosomal profiling has also revealed substantial numbers of examples of circadian translation in U2OS cells and liver cells^{125,126}. Interestingly, there are at least 150 examples of translationally driven oscillations in the liver for which no mRNA rhythms are present^{125}. Thus, both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation are critical for circadian gene expression.

Genome-wide circadian regulation of transcription, RNAPII and chromatin states. In the mouse liver, cycling pre-mRNA levels (using the intron RNA signal) were coordinately expressed in time, with a peak at CT15 (FIG. 4c). Thus, there is a peak of globally coordinated circadian transcription that occurs at the beginning of the night during the active or awake portion of the mouse circadian rhythm, which is not seen at the mRNA level (which has a bimodal pattern). To further analyse the global rhythms in nascent transcription, RNAPII occupancy has been measured during the circadian cycle^{71,72}. The large subunit of RNAPII (POLR2A) contains a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) that is post-translationally modified at different stages of transcription^{127–129}. RNAPII is recruited into the pre-initiation complex in a hypophosphorylated state (recognized by the 8WG16 antibody)^{130}. Surprisingly, RNAPII–8WG16 occupancy is highly circadian in the mouse liver, with a peak that correlated with the intron RNA peak (FIG. 4d). The first step in the initiation of RNAPII involves phosphorylation on Ser5 (Ser5P) of the CTD of RNAPII^{130,131}. RNAPII-Ser5P occupancy is also circadian^{71}, indicating that both recruitment and initiation of RNAPII are under circadian control. An antibody against the RPB2 subunit of RNAPII (POLR2B) revealed that RNAPII occupancy for promoters and gene bodies is rhythmic and co-varies over time^{72}. Rhythmic loading of RNAPII to promoters rather than a rhythmic transition from a paused state to productive elongation accounts for the majority of rhythmic transcription in the mouse liver^{72}.

Box 3 | Four-dimensional regulation of the genome

It is well established that chromatin interactions occur in three dimensions^{190–192}. However, temporal changes in 3D genomic interactions or in both space and time (the fourth dimension) are an emerging area ('the 4D nucleome' (REF. 193)). Circadian cycles in chromosome organization have been observed using circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) methods at the *Dbp* locus, a well-known CLOCK–BMAL1 target gene^{144}. Although chromosome interactions surrounding the *Dbp* locus were not reported to change during the circadian cycle, the frequency of long-range inter-chromosomal interactions did vary. Inter-chromosomal interactions were highest at the peak of *Dbp* expression and were lowest at the opposite phase, when *Dbp* expression was low. The *Dbp* circadian interactome was dependent on *Bmal1* expression because *Bmal1⁻/⁻* knockout cells had lower inter-chromosomal interactions similar to that seen at the trough of *Dbp* rhythms^{144}. 4C analysis of a BMAL1-bound enhancer upstream of the circadian gene *Nr1d1* (which encodes the nuclear receptor REV-ERBa) also found that interactions were largely stable during the circadian cycle^{148}. However, a global analysis of cohesin and CTCF revealed that cohesin–CTCF co-binding sites insulated cycling genes with different phases of expression and that cohesin–non-CTCF sites were associated with high-amplitude circadian cycling^{148}. In addition, genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) combined with RNA sequencing expression was used in human fibroblasts to search for circadian interactions, and a Laplacian analysis framework was implemented to quantify dynamic structure–function relationships in the genome^{145}. Using multicolour 3D-FISH, CLOCK and PER2, which have rhythmic and anti-phasic structure–function dynamics, were shown to also have a correlated rhythm in spatial distance between them^{145}. Finally, using 4C to probe the H19 imprinting control region in human embryonic stem cells, a large inter-chromosomal interactome was identified^{146}. The interactome was organized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and CTCF, and, interestingly, active loci enriched for circadian genes were found to be recruited to repressed lamina-associated domains in the nuclear periphery. In serum-synchronized HCT116 cells, there was a circadian rhythm of recruitment of circadian loci to the nuclear envelope that was dependent on PARP1 and CTCF. This recruitment was associated with the acquisition of dimethylation of Lys9 at histone H3 (H3K9me2) repressive marks and the attenuation of transcription. Thus, circadian regulation of transcription also involves the recruitment and repression of circadian loci to lamina-associated domains in the nuclear periphery^{146}.

peaks along with p300 and CBP recruitment and are accompanied by histone H3K4me1 and H3K9ac activation marks; 4) a temporally coordinated transcriptional activation phase at CT12–CT15 during which RNAPII recruitment and pre-mRNA transcript expression peak, followed by histone H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks; 5) a classic repression phase at CT15–CT18 during which PER1, PER2 and CRY2 occupancy peaks and transcription declines; and 6) a transition between the end of repression and the beginning of the next cycle. Interestingly, the co-activator CBP interacts with the repressor PER2 at the end of the repression phase, and CBP occupancy has a second peak at this time^{71}, perhaps maintaining an open chromatin state during the transition from repression to activation. CRY1 occupancy also bridges this transition period and interacts with CLOCK–BMAL1 to begin the next cycle.

In contrast to embryonic stem cells, for which 30% of genes are paused and carry bivalent histone marks^{139,140}, genes that are not expressed in the mouse liver are not enriched for paused RNAPII^{71} (FIG. 5b). Interestingly, the histone H3K4me3 promoter marks lag RNAPII occupancy by approximately 1 hour in cycling genes, and the H3K36me3 elongation marks lag by approximately 3 hours^{72}, consistent with the idea that these marks arise as a consequence of RNAPII transcription. Thus, circadian transcriptional regulators are clearly involved in RNAPII recruitment and initiation, as are the histone modifications associated with these events. However, additional steps such as promoter proximal pausing, pause release and productive elongation probably have additional regulatory roles (FIG. 7). At enhancer sites, CLOCK–BMAL1 is a pioneer transcription factor and can bind nucleosomes to promote rhythmic chromatin remodelling and incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z^{141} (FIG. 7). Cycling enhancers also display circadian rhythms in eRNA expression in conjunction with tissue-specific transcription factors^{107,119}. In the case of cycling genes, RNAPII recruitment, initiation and productive elongation are all rhythmic and occur in phase, leading to associated rhythms in histone modifications^{72}. In the case of expressed but non-cycling genes, RNAPII recruitment and initiation are also rhythmic, leading to rhythmic histone modifications at the promoter. However, subsequent steps in pausing, pause release and productive elongation may no longer be under circadian regulation^{71}. Because RNAPII pausing at promoter-proximal regions and pause release are major regulatory steps in transcription, it will be important in the future to determine whether pausing factors such as negative elongation factor (NELF) and DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), as well as the positive transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb) complex, are under circadian control^{129,142} (FIG. 7).

Laplacian analysis  
A framework used in many disciplines to quantify topologies in which autonomous entities reach a consensus without a central direction. In the 4D nucleome, it is used to describe the underlying topology of genome-wide chromosome conformation capture interactions in the genome.

Lamina-associated domains  
Regions of condensed chromatin that are bound by the nuclear lamina and are enriched for repressive histone marks such as H3K9me2.

Given these circadian rhythms of RNAPII, chromatin states associated with RNAPII transcription have been examined during the circadian cycle^{71,72,99}. FIGURE 5 illustrates genome-level views of histone modifications that are characteristic of promoter, enhancer and elongation states^{132–138}. Histone H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac modifications are enriched at promoters and undergo circadian rhythms in histone modifications at *Per1* (FIG. 5a). On a genome level, circadian rhythms in RNAPII occupancy as well as histone H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac modifications are present in the majority of expressed genes irrespective of whether RNA cycling occurs^{71}. Both RNAPII occupancy and H3K4me3 marks are highly dynamic and show circadian oscillations that peak during the early night (CT12) for all expressed genes, cycling intron RNA genes and non-cycling genes (FIG. 5b).

In summary, in the mouse liver, there is a highly stereotyped, time-dependent pattern of core transcription factor binding, RNAPII occupancy, transcription and chromatin states (FIG. 6). There are six distinctive phases of the circadian cycle: 1) a poised state at the beginning of the cycle (at CT0) during which CLOCK–BMAL1 and CRY1 bind to E-box sites in a transcriptionally silent state; 2) a derepression phase at CT4 as the levels of CRY1 decline; 3) a major activation phase at CT8 during which CLOCK–BMAL1 occupancy

Conclusions  
The circadian modulation of transcription occurs on a genome-wide scale far greater than that seen previously by gene expression profiling. The circadian clock in the liver regulates RNAPII occupancy on a genome-wide basis and drives the genome-wide circadian modulation

of chromatin states. These circadian rhythms in the chromatin state poise the genome for transcription on a daily basis to coincide with the daily metabolic demands of the organism and to optimize the energy utilization of gene expression^{143}. In addition to the circadian modulation of chromatin states, the 3D architecture of the nucleus and the interaction of active and repressive chromosomal domains undergo circadian oscillations^{144–148} (BOX 3). Thus, the four-dimensional regulation of the genome and its nuclear architecture are ripe for study. In addition to the pervasive circadian regulation of metabolism^{11,149}, strong links between the circadian gene network and cell growth and cancer^{150–152}, immune function^{29,30} and signalling^{153} are apparent, and components of this network will be important therapeutic targets in the future.
