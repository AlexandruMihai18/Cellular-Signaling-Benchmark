The circadian rhythms in mammals are regulated by a pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus¹². Four clock-gene families have been found to be involved in a transcription–translation feedback loop that generates the circadian rhythm at the intracellular level³. The proteins Clock and Bmal1 form a heterodimer which activates the transcription of the Per gene from the E-box elements in its promoter region⁴⁵. Protein products of Per act together with Cry proteins to inhibit Per transcription⁶⁷, thus closing the autoregulatory feedback loop. We found that Dec1 and Dec2, basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors, repressed Clock/Bmal1-induced transcription of the mouse Per1 promoter through direct protein–protein interactions with Bmal1 and/or competition for E-box elements. Dec1 and Dec2 are expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in a circadian fashion, with a peak in the subjective day. A brief light pulse induced Dec1 but not Dec2 expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in a phase-dependent manner. Dec1 and Dec2 are regulators of the mammalian molecular clock, and form a fifth clock-gene family.

Circadian rhythms are evolutionally conserved from bacteria to humans⁸. All clock genes so far identified in mammals are components of an autoregulatory transcription–translation feedback loop³. Gene products of Clock and Bmal1 act as positive components, whereas those of the Per and Cry genes act as negative ones⁴⁻⁷. This molecular feedback loop is widely accepted to be the intracellular machinery for circadian rhythm generation, but the model is insufficient to explain the stability and precision of circadian rhythms in living cells. Interlocked multiple feedback loops are considered as additional components to stabilize the molecular machinery³,⁹,¹⁰.

DEC1 (Stra13/Sharp2/BHLHB2) and DEC2 (Sharp1/BHLHB3) encode basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors related to rat Hes, Drosophila Hairy, and Enhancer of split (E(spl))¹¹⁻¹³. Four of us (T.K., K.F., M.N., and Y.K.) cloned complementary DNA of human DEC1¹¹, a cyclic AMP inducible gene product, in embryonic chondrocytes and cloned cDNAs of DEC2 in human, mouse and rat, by expressed sequence tag (EST) searching for similar members to DEC1¹⁴. In contrast to other members of Hes/Hairy/E(spl) subgroups, DEC1 and DEC2 lack a carboxy-terminal ‘WRPW domain’ to which co-repressors bind¹¹,¹⁴. Circadian expression in peripheral tissues of Dec1 and Dec2 (M.N., manuscript in preparation), and reports that related proteins can bind to E-box elements¹⁵,¹⁶, prompted us to study the roles of Decs in the mammalian circadian system.

Both Dec1 and Dec2 suppressed Clock/Bmal1-induced activation of Per1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner as reported by a luciferase assay (Fig. 1a). Firefly reporter plasmid (E54-TK) was constructed by inserting a 5′ flanking region of mouse Per1 containing 3 E-box elements, CACGTG, upstream of the TK promoter and these were transfected to NIH3T3 cells. The luciferase activity was markedly increased (125-fold) in the presence of Clock and Bmal1 plasmid (50 ng per well). Co-transfection of the same amount of Dec1 or Dec2 plasmid suppressed the promoter activity down to 13.3 ± 1.0% (mean ± s.e.) and to 5.9 ± 0.5%, respectively. Even

with one-eighth of the amount of plasmid, Dec1 suppressed the promoter activity to 72.5 ± 4.5%, and Dec2, to 14.6 ± 1.1%. The suppressing effects of Dec2 overwhelmed those of Per1, Per2, CRY1 and CRY2 at the same dosage. In our luciferase assay, CRY1 and CRY2 inhibited the promoter activity more strongly than did Per1 or Per2, confirming a previous result<sup>6</sup>. The suppression by Dec1 was comparable to that by CRY1 and CRY2.

Dec1 and Dec2 are not general inhibitors of transcription. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a bHLH-PAS transcription factor like Clock and Bmal1, and activates transcription of targets such as the erythropoietin gene through hypoxia-response elements (HRE)<sup>17</sup>. We examined the effects of Dec1 or Dec2 cotransfection on a HIF-1α-induced increase of the HRE reporter activity, and found that they did not significantly change the reporter activity (75.3 ± 5.3% and 114.9 ± 9.6%, respectively)—which was increased by HIF-1α (20.4-fold).

Gel retardation assays show that both mouse Dec1 and mouse Dec2 bound to mouse Per1 proximal E-box elements (Fig. 1b). The binding was specific to an E-box, because excess dose of unlabelled E-box but not mutant E-box inhibited the binding. Thus, Decs may suppress Clock/Bmal1-induced transactivation by competing for E-box binding upstream of mouse Per1. Nevertheless, a yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that both Dec1 and Dec2 bound specifically to Bmal1 (Fig. 1c). Dec1 and Dec2 lacking the C-terminal regions were able to bind to Bmal1 as did the full-length Decs, but those lacking the amino terminal failed to bind, suggesting the bHLH is the responsible site. Dec1 and Dec2 with the N-terminal regions did not bind to Clock. In this respect, Decs are different from E4BP4, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor which represses Per1 transcription by competitively binding to the albumin D-site binding protein (DBP)-binding consensus at the 5′ upstream of Per1<sup>18</sup>. Dec1 and Dec2 exert their repressing effects on Clock/Bmal1-induced transactivation through competition for E-boxes with Clock/Bmal1 and/or direct protein–protein interactions with Bmal1.

Dec1 and Dec2 are expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN) in a circadian fashion (Fig. 2). Robust circadian rhythms (*P* < 0.001) were detected in both gene expression under continuous darkness (DD) as well as under light-dark conditions (LD) with peaks either early (Dec1) or in the middle (Dec2) of subjective day (Fig. 2a, b). Different light conditions did not change the circadian profiles. Compared with other brain areas, the hybridization signals in the SCN were weak for Dec1, but strong for Dec2 (Fig. 2c–f).

The circadian rhythms are phase-shifted by a light pulse, which is an important mechanism for the entrainment of the circadian clock

to 24-h light-dark environments. Light signals reach the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract¹⁹, and shift the circadian clock—the amount and direction (advance or delay) of the shift depends on the phase of the light pulse²⁰. We examined light responsiveness of *Dec1* and *Dec2* gene expression in rats kept under DD for 3 d and subsequently exposed to a single light pulse of 30 min. *Dec1* and *Dec2* responded differently to the light pulse (Fig. 3). The light pulses given at 20:00, 24:00 and 4:00 significantly increased *Dec1* expression, whereas the same light pulses failed to induce *Dec2* expression. In contrast, the light pulse at 24:00 slightly but significantly decreased *Dec2* expression. Light pulses at other times did not change the level of gene expression for either *Dec1* or *Dec2*. Thus, the light responsiveness of *Dec1* expression was phase-dependent, and corresponded to the light-sensitive portion of a phase response curve²⁰ (Fig. 3a, c).

The circadian profiles of *Dec1* and *Dec2* expression were also examined in brain structures other than the SCN. Gene expression for *Dec1* and *Dec2* was different in different brain areas (Fig. 2c–f and Fig. 4a, b). *Dec1* was expressed strongly in the cerebral cortex, especially in the fifth layer, thalamus, and superior colliculus. On the other hand, *Dec2* expression was robust in the caudate putamen, pineal gland, and granular cell layer of the cerebellum. Both *Dec1* and *Dec2* were expressed in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamic nuclei. Significant circadian rhythms were detected in the parietal and piriform cortices for *Dec1*, and in the piriform cortex and caudate putamen for *Dec2* under both LD and DD (Fig. 4c–f). None of them, however, were as robust as in the SCN. The circadian rhythms in these brain areas were almost 180° out of phase to those in the SCN. Phase reversal of the circadian rhythm outside the SCN has been observed in clock genes such as *Per1*, *Per2* and *Bmal1*²¹,²² and may be related to behavioural rhythms²². Rhythmic expression of *Dec1* and *Dec2* outside the SCN may reflect their roles in the interacting molecular feedback loops of peripheral clocks²³.

Recently, two interacting molecular loops were suggested to be involved in the clock mechanism in mammals⁹. Together with a core feedback loop of *Per* transcription with positive (Clock, Bmal1) and negative components (*Per1*, *Per2*, *Cry1*, *Cry2*), an additional feedback loop of Bmal1 was suggested to be involved in such a way that

*Bmal1* expression was enhanced by *Cry1*, *Cry2* and *Per2*⁹,¹⁰. In the present study, Decs are suggested as strong negative components of the core loop. As Dec expression is up-regulated by Clock/Bmal1 heterodimers (T.K., manuscript in preparation), Decs seem to be important components of an additional autoregulatory feedback loop which interlocks with the core feedback loop of circadian oscillation. Specifically, *Per* proteins activate the production of Bmal1⁹,¹⁰, which in turn stimulates *Per* and *Dec* transcription. Decs suppress the transactivation of *Per* gene by Clock/Bmal1, thus closing the loop. A physiological role for *Dec* proteins in the molecular clock mechanism is supported by the timing of their expressions in the SCN. High expression in the middle of the subjective day matches the time of maximum Clock/Bmal1 transcriptional activity²⁴. A recent study showed that most of the cyclic transcripts were tissue-specific and only a limited number of genes were rhythmically expressed both in the SCN and liver²⁴, suggesting a key role for these genes in the molecular clock mechanisms. Therefore, rhythmic expression of Decs in many peripheral tissues including the liver implies physiological significance (M.N., manuscript in preparation).

A single light pulse enhanced *Dec1* but not *Dec2* expression in a phase-dependent manner, which was similar to *Per1*²⁵,²⁶. The light-induced *Dec1* expression is not due to a light-induced increase in Per or Bmal1 proteins but is probably due to a direct action of light. Entraining light signals in mammals are mediated by the retinohypothalamic tract¹⁹, a major neurotransmitter of which is glutamate.

Glutamate increases intracellular calcium, which in turn activates cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) in the SCN neurons<sup>27</sup>. As happens for *Per1*<sup>28</sup>, a binding site for CREB—calcium/cAMP responsive element (CRE)—is found in the upstream promoter region of *Dec1*<sup>15</sup>. *Per1* and *Dec1* seem to be the doors to the molecular-clock machinery.

### Methods

#### Transfection and luciferase assay
A firefly reporter plasmid, E54-TK, was constructed by connecting an E54 fragment into the *NheI-XhoI* site upstream of the TK promoter of the pGL3-TK vector<sup>29</sup> (a gift from M. Negishi and T. Suyeyoshi). The E54 fragment consisted of three E-boxes within 2.0 kb of the 5′ flanking region of the mouse *Per1* gene with their immediate flanking sequences linked together (TTTAGCCACGTGACAGTGTAAGCACACGTGGGCCCTCAAGT CCACGTGCAGGGA) as reported previously<sup>4</sup>. NIH3T3 cells were plated (3.4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well) in a 24-well plate 24 h before transfection. Reporter plasmid (E54-TK, 2 ng per well) and mouse *Clock* and mouse *Bmal1b* (each 50 ng per well) expression vectors were transfected with or without one of following vectors; human *DEC1*, mouse *Dec2*, mouse *Perl*, rat *Per2*, human *CRY1* or human *CRY2* (each 50 ng per well) using Lipofectamine PLUS (Gibco-BRL) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. In a dose response experiment, *DEC1* and *Dec2* plasmids were added in doses of 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.125 ng per well. The total concentration of DNA was adjusted to 152.2 ng per well with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). For the intrinsic standard, 0.2 ng of pRL-SV40 vector (Promega) was transfected to each well. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were lysed with Cell Lysis Buffer (Promega), and renilla and firefly luciferase activities were examined with Dual Reporter Assay Reagent (Promega). Similarly, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 4 ng of firefly reporter plasmid containing HRE, 50 ng of HIF-1α (provided by L. Poellinger<sup>17</sup>) and 0.2 ng pRL-SV40 vector with or without 50 ng of *Dec1* or *Dec2* plasmid, and relative luciferase activity was measured (*n* = 8).

Expression constructs were made by subcloning full-length coding regions of the following genes into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen); mouse *Clock* (AF000998) and mouse *Bmal1b* (AB012601) were obtained by RT–PCR, mouse *Per1* was generously supplied by H. Tei<sup>28</sup>, human *CRY1* (D84657), by M. Ikeda, and rat *Per2* (AB016532) and human *CRY2* (AB014558), by T. Nagase. As the AB014558 gene lacks 13 bp at the 5′ end of the human *CRY2* coding region, the fragment was added by PCR according to the sequence of an EST clone (AL 040215).

#### Gel retardation assay
Mouse *Dec1* and *Dec2* were translated using the TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The double-stranded oligonucleotides of the *Per1* E-box (5′-cgcgCAAGTCCACGTGCAGGGAtcga-3′) were end-labelled using [³²P]dCTP and DNA polymerase Klenow fragment. Synthesized mouse *Dec1* or *Dec2* was incubated with approximately 30,000 c.p.m. of <sup>32</sup>P-labelled probe for 10 min in 10 μl of 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. In competition experiments, a 200-fold molar excess of unlabelled E-box or mutant E-box (5′-cgcgCAAGTCtcgctcCAGGGAtcga-3′) was added to the reaction mixture. The mixtures were applied to 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 12.5 mM Tris-HCl/125 mM glycine/1 mM EDTA buffer.

#### Yeast two-hybrid assay
cDNAs encoding full-length mouse Bmal1, mouse Clock, human DEC1 and mouse Dec2, and those encoding N-terminal (4–139) and C-terminal (150–412) regions of human DEC1 and N-terminal (1–196) and C-terminal (113–410) regions of mouse Dec2 were cloned with pLP-GADT7AD, pLP-GBKT7DNA-BD, pGADT7AD or pGBK7DNA-BD vector (Clontech). *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* AH109 was co-transfected with plasmids encoding either GAL4 DNA-BD or GAL4 AD fused protein. The transformants expressing two fused proteins were selected on plates of –Leu/–Trp SD medium. Three independent clones were assayed for transactivation of the HIS3 and ADE2 reporter genes on –Leu/–Trp/–His/–Ade SD plates.

#### Animal handling and tissue sampling
Male rats of Wistar strain were used at 2–2.5 months old. They were born and reared in our animal quarters, where environmental conditions were controlled (lights on from 06:00–18:00) as described elsewhere<sup>20–22</sup>. In the first experiment, rats were decapitated under LD (*n* = 30) and on the third day in DD (*n* = 30) at 6 times of the day starting from 8:00. In the second experiment, rats (*n* = 30) kept under DD for 3 d were exposed to a light pulse of 300 lux for 30 min from one of six time points as in the first experiment. They were returned to DD and decapitated 1 h after the onset of the light pulse. Control rats (*n* = 30) were decapitated under DD without exposing to light. The brains were quickly removed and frozen as described previously<sup>21,22</sup>.

#### Quantitative in situ hybridization
This was performed as described previously<sup>21,22</sup>. Twelve serial sections containing the SCN in each rat were alternatively hybridized with *Dec1* and *Dec2* probes (5′-ACATACAAGCACACGCACGGCACACTCACACTCTCACACAC-3′ and 5′-AAAGGGTAGAGGGTGGGGTGGCAGAAGGGTGAGAAAAGGGGCAAAA-3′, respectively) radiolabelled with <sup>35</sup>S-dATP (NEN). In addition, sagittal sections at the level of the SCN were saved in 3 brains obtained at 12:00 under LD. The hybridization signals were analysed using a microcomputer imaging device (Imaging Research). Optical density of the structure of interest was calibrated by converting it to relative signal intensity (kBq g⁻¹) using the <sup>14</sup>C-acrylic standards in the same cassette, and normalized by subtracting that of the corpus callosum in the same section as described previously<sup>21</sup>.

### Statistics
Circadian rhythms were statistically analysed by one-way analysis of variance, ANOVA. Differences between two circadian rhythms were analysed by two-way ANOVA with the Bonfferoni–Dunn *post hoc* test.
