## Abstract

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most prevalent human malignancies world-wide with rising incidence in industrialized countries, few therapeutic options and poor prognosis. To expand and improve therapeutic strategies identification of drug targets ideally involved in several liver cancer relevant pathways appears mandatory. Virtually all signal transduction cascades cross the nuclear envelope and thereby require components of the nuclear transport system (NTS) including nuclear transport receptors (e.g. importins and exportins) and the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Accordingly, members of the NTS represent rewarding targets for therapeutic intervention and selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) have already entered clinical trials for various malignancies. Here, we review current knowledge on alterations of the NTS and their potential for targeted therapy in HCC.

Introduction

The predominant type of primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for 85-90% of the cases. Liver cancer is the fifth most frequent malignancy worldwide and represents a major global health problem being the 2nd most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Furthermore, with an annual increase of 2% in the US, liver cancer shows the most rapidly rising incidence rate of all solid tumors [1, 2]. The vast majority of HCC arises in the context of liver cirrhosis, caused by chronic liver damage initiating and sustaining chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Chronic liver damage is induced by the main risk factors for HCC including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, aflatoxin exposure, alcohol abuse leading to alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), and metabolic disorders (obesity, diabetes mellitus) resulting in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [2]. Particularly the latter is expected to contribute to a further substantial increase of HCC cases in the next decades. While the etiology of the vast majority HCCs (over 90%) is well defined the therapeutic options are still limited with less than 20% of HCC patients being amenable for a curative treatment (partial hepatectomy and transplantation). For advanced HCC the multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib represents the first approved systemic treatment [3], however, with only mild improvement of patient outcome similar to other non-curative therapeutic options such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) [4]. In addition, as the majority of HCC patients suffer from liver cirrhosis as mentioned above aggressive treatment approaches are often not suitable due to the severely impaired liver function and regenerative capacity. Thus the prognosis of symptomatic HCC patients is extremely poor with a five-year-survival of less than 5%. A better understanding of the disease-relevant molecular mechanisms including chemotherapy resistance is indispensable for identifying novel drug targets and to expand the therapeutic repertoire in the future. In this context nuclear transport factors are about to emerge as promising candidates for targeted therapy with selective inhibitors being already tested in Phase-I clinical trials in solid tumors. Here, members of the nuclear transport machinery will be reviewed in terms of their expression profile, (dys-)regulation, (patho-) physiological, prognostic and therapeutic significance in HCC.

Altered signaling pathways (e.g. WNT/β-catenin, IL6-JAK/STAT, MAPK, PI3K-AKT/mTOR, TGF-β and p53) play a key role in HCC development and progression [5]. All of these have in common that they are intrinsically linked to the nuclear transport system (NTS) as they depend on translocation events across the nuclear envelope, e.g. by import of activated transcription factors or export of target gene products. Providing selective nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange of macromolecules the NTS consists of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) as the trafficking gateway embedded in the nuclear envelope and nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) shuttling cargos through the NPC. The NPC is composed by highly conserved, distinct structural modules: the inner ring, the cytoplasmic and nuclear rings as well as the cytoplasmic filaments and the nuclear basket (Figure 1A, left panel) [6]. These subcomplexes are in turn built by subsets of the overall ~30 Nucleoporins (Nups) with the corresponding individual structures being largely resolved [7-9] (Figure 1A, right panel). About one third of all Nups contain phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-rich repeat domains extending into the central channel that serve to build a meshwork implicated in transport selectivity [6, 10]. Nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) predominantly of the highly conserved karyopherin-β superfamily (e.g. importins and exportins) mediate translocation of cargoes through the NPC by interacting with these FG-repeat domains [11]. While proteins with a molecular weight below ~40kDa can passively diffuse through the NPC the transport of larger molecules depend on active transport by NTRs. Notably, several hundreds to ~1000 transport events per NPC per second have been estimated to occur [12]. Members of the
karyopherin-β family of NTRs are encoded by 20 genes comprising ten proteins serving in nuclear import, seven proteins that function in nuclear export, two proteins involved in bidirectional transport (although this very strict subdivision does not account for all of them) (Figure 1B) and one protein (RanBP6) that remains to be characterized [13, 14]. Proteins of the karyopherin-α/importin-α family are considered as adaptors encompassing seven members in humans (Figure 1B), connecting importin-β to its cargos.

The best characterized classical protein import pathway involves the recognition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within a cargo protein sequence by an importin-α isoform and subsequent association with importin-β to form a trimeric cargo-NLS/importin-α/importin-β complex [15, 16] (Figure 1C). Alternatively, importin-β can also bind directly to NLS cargo proteins independent of an importin-α adaptor protein (Figure 1C). In either scenario the importin/cargo complex passes the NPC by interacting with FG-containing Nups and dissociates upon binding of RanGTP to release its transport substrate into the nucleoplasm [16]. Importin-α isoforms are then re-shuttled to the cytoplasm by their exclusive exporter exportin-2/Cellular Apoptosis Susceptibility (CAS) in association with RanGTP [17, 18] (Figure 1D). Notably, some HCC relevant proteins (e.g. β-catenin and SMADs) do not require NTRs for their nuclear import but can interact directly with a subset of Nups (= “non-conventional” protein import, see below) [19].

Cargo proteins harbouring a nuclear export signal (NES) bind to exportins and RanGTP to form an export complex in the nucleoplasm. The disassembly of the exported NTR/NES cargo complex is induced by the GTPase-activating protein RanGAP and additional proteins at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC [16, 20] (Figure 1D). The probably best characterized exportin is exportin-1 (XPO1, CRM1) that is thought to expel a large set of proteins from the nucleus [21]. Beyond proteins exportin-1 is also involved in the export of subsets of mRNAs (e.g. c-fos) containing AU-rich elements [22], snRNAs, and rRNAs [23], while tRNAs are transported by exportin-t [23] and pre-miRNAs by exportin-5 [24], all of which depending on the RanGTP-RanGDP gradient. In contrast, nuclear export of bulk mRNA is provided by the non-karyopherin transport proteins NXF1(TAP)-NXT1(p15) in a Ran-GTP-independent manner [23, 25].

Members of the NTS, particularly Nups, participate in a variety of essential cellular processes such as cell differentiation, gene regulation, chromatin organization/modification, DNA repair, mitosis, and reprogramming [26-32]. Accordingly, nuclear transport factors have been linked to a wide range of human disorders with astonishingly specific phenotypes including autoimmune diseases (e.g. Nup210 and Nup62 as auto-antigens in primary biliary cirrhosis [33]), cardiovascular disorders (Nup155 mutation leading to atrial fibrillation [34]), triple-A (Achalasia-Addison-Alacrimia) syndrome (by mutation in the nucleoporin Aladin) [16], and a specific type of nephrotic syndrome associated with mutations in Nup93, Nup205, and exportin-5 [35]. Notably, these functions and phenotypes might come about through transport-dependent and -independent functions of Nups and NTRs. Traditionally, the link between Nups and cancer has been studied in the context of Nup-containing fusion proteins (e.g. Nup98/HoxA9 or DEK-Nup214) resulting from chromosomal translocation typically occurring in hematological malignancies [36, 37]. However, neither Nup-containing fusion proteins nor recurrent point mutations in Nups or karyopherin genes have yet been defined in HCC.

Dysregulation, function, and prognostic significance of nuclear transport factors in HCC
Overexpression of karyopherins in HCC was reported for exportin-1/CRM 1 (XPO 1), exportin-2/CAS, importin-α1 (KPNA 2), and importin-α5 (KPNA1) compared to non-tumorous liver tissue [38]. Interestingly, in a transcriptomic HCC subclassification study by Boyault et al [39] the karyopherins importin-β1 (KPNB1), exportin-1 (XPO1), importin-7 as well as the nucleoporins Nup155 and Nup107 were identified as highly expressed in a specific HCC subgroup (G3). This subgroup was characterized by TP53 mutations, lack of correlation to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and overexpression of cell cycle regulating genes [39] already indicating a link between the nuclear transport machinery, the p53 pathway, and cell cycle regulation (see below). Also downregulation of specific nuclear transport proteins is documented in liver cancer such as exportin-4 (XPO4) [40] and Nup98 [41] consistent with a potential or proven tumor suppressive role of these factors in HCC [41, 42]. Moreover, up-(e.g. exportin-1 and exportin-2/CAS) or down-regulation (e.g. exportin-4) correlate with tumor de-differentiation [38, 43, 44], proliferation [38, 44] and poor prognosis [40, 44-46] in HCC indicating a prognostic value of de-regulated transport factors. Notably, dysregulation of transport factors can already be observed in preneoplastic lesions (dysplastic nodules) as demonstrated for exportin-2/CAS [38] or Nup88 [47] suggesting that these are early events in hepatocarcinogenesis and therefore potential options for early intervention.

Functional characterization of overexpressed NTRs in liver cancer suggests an anti-apoptotic role of the exportin-2/CAS-importin-α1 transport cycle, being partially linked to the anti-apoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) [38]. However, the pro-survival role of exportin-2/CAS seems to be context-dependent since it can also be involved in apoptosis induction under certain conditions (e.g. toxin-treatment) [48-50]. Exportin-2/CAS was also linked to tumor cell migration and invasion in HCC, based on its requirement for maintaining integrin-β1 expression as identified by a proteomics approach [46]. Another aspect of the pro-migratory function of exportin-2/CAS is connected to its role in microtubule interaction as shown in breast cancer cells [51]. Although also not yet confirmed in HCC importin-α1 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenicity through upregulation of c-Myc and downregulation of FOXO3a [52].

In contrast to many studies that have focused on identifying and characterizing upregulated karyopherins in cancer, relatively little is known about the mechanisms leading to their overexpression [53]. For exportin-2/CAS and importin-α1 it was shown that both karyopherins are transcriptionally repressed by the tumor suppressor protein p53 in HCC in a p21-dependent manner [38]. Thus, a repression relief upon p53 inactivation either functionally (e.g. via MDM4 overexpression) or genetically (by mutations in the TP53 gene) leads to coordinated exportin-2/CAS and importin-α1 overexpression, presumably not only in HCC. A similar scenario could be relevant for exportin-1 upregulation, since exportin-1 was also demonstrated to be a p53 repression target in lung fibroblasts [54] and in cervical cancer cell lines [55]. The former report also identified importin-7 as p53 repression target while c-myc was found as inducer of importin-7, importin-5, importin-4, importin-11, and transportin-1 [54].

Gene amplification may also play a role for high levels of karyopherins such as exportin-2 [56], since the corresponding gene XPO2 resides in the 20q13.3 region which is frequently amplified in HCC [57]. For importin-β1 (KPNB1) and importin-α1 (KPNA2) E2F-driven increased transcription upon Rb inactivation was reported [58]. Although this phenomenon was identified in cervical carcinoma cells it may also contribute to dysregulation of both transport factors in HCC, as Rb1 is recurrently deleted in HCCs [57]. Other transcription factors postulated to regulate karyopherin-beta genes are Sp1, NRF-2, HEN-1, RREB-1, and NF-Y [59], of which SP1 and NRF-2 have been implicated in

hepatocarcinogenesis [57, 60-63]. Beyond transcriptional activation, dysregulation of karyopherins can also occur post-transcriptionally, which is exemplified by importin-α1 (KPNA2) mRNA being a target of miRNA-26b [64]. Although this post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism was observed in ovarian cancer miRNA-26b is also downregulated in HCC [65] and therefore could be relevant for importin-α1 (KPNA2) overexpression in liver cancer as well.

HCC relevant signaling cascades utilize NTR-dependent and -independent transport pathways

In the following we will discuss how HCC relevant signaling cascades using NTR-dependent and -independent transport pathways are associated with particular members of the nuclear transport system (Figure 2). The emphasis will be on the nuclear import and export mechanisms of key transcription factors of a selection of signaling cascades. Beyond these Table 1 also provides information about additional signaling pathways that are not discussed below.

p53 tumor suppressor pathway (NTR-dependent)

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a major barrier against liver tumor development and progression and is mutated in 18-35% of HCCs [57]. Upon different kinds of stress (e.g. DNA damage, oncogene activation, etc.) the transcription factor p53 is stabilized by escaping MDM2-mediated degradation and translocates to the nucleus [66]. There p53 transactivates subsets of its multiple target genes leading to a variety of cellular outcomes (e.g. cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, metabolic changes, etc.). Therefore, nuclear import is obviously pivotal to p53's function. In unstressed cells ubiquitylation of lysines 319–321 of NLS I protects p53 from binding to importin-α3 [67], thereby preventing its nuclear import and exposing p53 to proteosomal degradation. During a stress response posttranslational modifications of MDM2 and p53 result in reduced ubiquitylation, which allows the interaction between NLS I and importin-α3 and subsequent nuclear import. This adds a new aspect to the prevailing model suggesting that stress-induced tetramerization of nuclear p53 results in masking p53's NES and thereby causing an export block by preventing the interaction with exportin-1 and retaining p53 in the nucleus [68]. While active import via importin-α3 occurs at early stages, the export block appears to be relevant at later stages of the p53 mediated stress response [69]. Also the subcellular localization of regulators of the p53-MDM2 loop require consideration as shown for the polycomb group (PcG) member RING1-and YY1-binding protein (RYBP) [70, 71], being downregulated in HCC and correlated with patient outcome and responsiveness to chemotherapy [72, 73]. By identifying and mutating three functional monopartite NLSs in RYBP Tan et al could demonstrate that the cytoplasmically retained RYBPmut is more potent in inhibiting MDM2-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation of p53 compared to wild-type RYBP with predominant nuclear localization [71]. Consequently, RYBPmut reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis more efficiently than the corresponding wild-type protein, even though not entirely in a p53-dependent manner. Consistent with its increased tumorsuppressive function the authors suggest to utilize RYBPmut in a therapeutic approach [71].

Another level at which members of the nuclear transport machinery are linked to the p53 pathway is the one of p53 target gene selection. In a transport-independent function exportin-2/CAS can associate with chromatin at specific p53 target gene promoter regions (e.g. p53-AIP) being required for the full induction of these genes [50]. Furthermore, based on a targeted RNAi screen Nup98 was identified to regulate the induction of p21 (CDKN1A), a cell cycle regulator and key effector of the p53 response [74], on a post-transcriptional level [41]. Mechanistically Nup98 associates with the 3'UTR of p21 mRNA to protect it from exosomal degradation. In accordance with a potential

tumorsuppressive function Nup 98 was found lower expressed in ~25% of HCCs compared to non-
tumorous liver tissue. However, since Nup 98 and p21 mRNA were correlated to each other a subset
of HCCs also showed higher expression of both factors suggesting a dual role of Nup 98 in liver cancer
possibly through p21 [41]. The complexity of p21 in cancer biology ranging from tumor suppressive
to oncogenic functions involves many determinants including its subcellular localization [75, 76].
With few exceptions [77, 78] nuclear p21 is widely considered to exhibit tumor suppressive functions
for instance by mediating cell cycle arrest or senescence particular upon p53 induction [75, 76, 78]. In
contrast, cytoplasmic p21 is correlated with poor prognosis in several malignancies [75, 76] and
considered oncogenic by its anti-apoptotic function via binding to and inhibition of procaspase 3,
caspase 8, and caspase 10, among other mechanisms [76, 78]. Since the nuclear export of p21 is
exportin-1/CRM1-dependent [75, 79, 80], overexpression of exportin-1/CRM-1 observed in HCC [38,
45] favors the cytoplasmic accumulation and thereby pro-tumorigenic function of p21.

Wnt/β-catenin (NTR-independent)

Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling cascade is one of the main drivers in hepatocarcinogenesis
most frequently due to missense mutation in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene (10-33%) [57, 81]. A critical
step in this pathway is the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and its association with LEF/TCF,
converting the latter into a transcriptional activator and driving expression of pro-tumorigenic genes
such as MYC or CCND1 [82]. The nuclear translocation of β-catenin represents one of the most
studied NTR-independent import pathways which is also independent of the RanGTPase cycle [19].
Not containing a typical NLS, β-catenin interacts directly with NPC components, specifically the FG-
repeats of Nup62, Nup98, Nup153, and Nup358 [83]. As suggested by deletion studies the C-
terminus and the Armadillo repeats 10-12 represent the regions of β-catenin required for its nuclear
import [84]. However, it still remains a matter of debate if there is another import pathway for β-
catenin that is NTR- and Ran-dependent and involves a yet to be defined cytoplasmic binding partner
[19]. Nuclear export of β-catenin (devoid of a classical NES) relies on largely the same regions that are
required for its import [84] and involves direct interaction with RanBP3 [85]. Although RanBP3 is a
co-factor of exportin-1 [86], the export of β-catenin is exportin-1-independent [85]. These findings
further support the prevailing model that transport of β-catenin in either direction does not rely on
karyopherins [87].

NF-κB pathway (NTR-dependent)

HCC represents a prototype of inflammation associated cancer and the NF-κB pathway with its
fundamental role in inflammation and immune response has been strongly linked to liver
tumorigenesis [88]. However, NF-κB plays a dual role in HCC with context dependent pro- and anti-
tumorigenic effects [89]. Accordingly, NF-κB proteins represent a group of transcription factors
controlling the expression of genes involved in various important cellular processes, including
apoptosis, cell survival, stress and immune response, differentiation, and proliferation [90]. NF-κB
operates as a dimer composed by various combinations of the following five subunits: p65 (RelA), c-
Rel, and RelB as well as p50 and p52 (lacking transcriptional activation domains). The predominant
heterodimer in most cell types is p50/p65 [90]. Inhibitors of NF-κB (IκBs) such as IκBα and IκBβ retain
NF-κB in the cytoplasm by masking the NLS within the respective NF-κB subunits. A classical NLS is
found in p50 and p65. Upon activation an IκB kinase complex phosphorylates IκB followed by
ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of IκB. As a consequence, the NLSs of p50 and p65 are
unmasked, and the dimers are rapidly translocated into the nucleus, where they initiate transcription
by binding regulatory DNA sequences of responsive genes. Importin-α3 and importin-α4 are the main importin-α isoforms involved in the nuclear import of NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers upon TNF-alpha-stimulation [91]. Interestingly p52 protein directly interacts with importin-α3, -α4, -α5 and -α6, and c-Rel binds to importin-α5, -α6 and -α7 while RelB interacts with importin-α5 and -α6 [91]. Moreover, the specificity of a given heterodimer is dictated by only one of the respective subunits as the import of the p52/RelB heterodimers is mediated exclusively by the NLS of RelB, while p52 mediates the nuclear import of p52/p65 heterodimers [92]. Beyond NTRs NF-κB signaling has been linked to Nup88 based on the observation that low levels of Nup88 increase NF-κB nuclear export [36, 93]. In turn Nup88 overexpression that is frequently found in HCC [47] and other tumor entities contributes to NF-κB nuclear accumulation resulting from impaired nuclear export [36, 93]. A recent report suggested another role of NUP88 in malignant transformation, not directly related to NF-κB [94]. The authors identified Nup88 in association with NUP98 and RAE1 as an inhibitor of the premitotic activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). Consequently, overexpression and cytoplasmic accumulation of Nup88 sequestered NUP98-RAE1 preventing the interaction with APC/C and thereby impairing mitotic checkpoint control, inducing abnormal chromosome segregation, aneuploidy, and chromosomal instability [94].

Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling

Several HCC relevant receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-R1) signal through the ras/raf/mek/erk pathway and/or the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) AKT/PKB pathway which induce a variety of pro-tumorigenic downstream effects [95]. The former typically by driving proliferation and cell survival and the latter by increasing protein synthesis and glucose metabolism, among others [95, 96]. Critically for the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade is the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2. Under unstimulated conditions MEK1/2 anchors ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm [97, 98]. Upon stimulation MEK1/2 phosphorylates ERK1/2 leading to a conformation change of ERK1/2, subsequent separation from MEK1/2, and interaction with importin-7. Importin-7 recognizes a nuclear transport sequence containing a phosphorylated Ser-Pro-Ser (SPS) motif in the kinase insert domain of ERK1/2 [99] resulting in nuclear import of ERK1/2 in an importin-α independent manner. However, also NTR-independent nuclear import at least for ERK2 has been reported [100, 101]. The nuclear export of ERK2 was shown to be partially dependent on exportin-1 [102].

Increasing protein synthesis by the PI3K/AKT/PKB cascade involves activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) through inhibition of TSC1 and TSC2 by phosphorylated AKT/PKB. Activated mTORC1 in turn phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor F4E (eIF4E) binding proteins (4E-BPs) to be released from the potent oncogene eIF4E which induces mRNA translation [103]. EIF4E rearranges components of the cytoplasmic side of the NPC leading to increased export of eIF4E target mRNAs (e.g CyclinD1, c-myc, mdm-2) [104]. In detail, eIF4E reduces Nup358/RanBP2, relocalizes Nup214, and increases RanBP1 as well as the RNA export factors Gle1 and DDX19. Conversely, Nup358/RanBP2 overexpression inhibits eIF4E target mRNA export and impedes malignant transformation by eIF4E [104].

Targeting the nuclear transport system as a therapeutic approach
The expression profile, functional effects, and early dysregulation in HCC of a subset of NTRs designate these as attractive therapeutic targets. First to mention here is exportin-1/Crm1 being overexpressed not only in HCC [38, 105] but also in other solid tumors (e.g. ovarian and cervical cancer [106, 107]) and hematological neoplasms such as multiple myeloma [108], chronic myelogenous leukemia [109], acute myeloid leukemia [110], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [111], and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [112]. In fact, currently hematological malignancies are the primary group of neoplasms where anti-exportin-1 compounds are tested in a pre-clinical and clinical setting (see below). The current concept of targeting exportin-1/crm1 is its involvement in nuclear export of tumor suppressor and growth inhibiting proteins such as p53, p21, p27, FOXO, and I-kB [80] [79]. Overexpression of CRM1 in tumors thus leads to increased export of these factors and impairment of their tumor suppressing and growth inhibiting functions [79]. This in turn can be prevented by disrupting the interaction between exportin-1 and its transport substrates in a therapeutic approach. Unfortunately, the earliest generation of exportin-1 inhibitors such as leptomycin B (LMB) showed only minimal efficacy and severe toxicity, most likely due to off-target effects [113-116]. While disappointing from a clinical perspective, leptomycin B became a highly valuable tool compound in nuclear transport research. Recently, a promising new class of slowly reversible small molecule covalent inhibitors of exportin-1, so called selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE), were designed [79, 117]. SINE inhibit the interaction between exportin-1 and its transport substrates by covalently binding to the Cys 528 residue located in the NES-binding pocket [79]. Selinexor as the most prominent SINE compound is orally bioavailable, shows proportional pharmacokinetics with no evidence of drug accumulation, and broad anti-tumor activity [79, 118]. Extensive pre-clinical testing revealed that Selinexor, while not significantly affecting normal hematopoietic cells [119], causes increased cell death in T-ALL and AML cell lines, primary cells, and murine xenograft models [117, 120]. On-target effects were detectable in AML xenograft models as indicated by reduction in XPO1 protein and nuclear accumulation of p53 and NPM1 [117, 120]. Furthermore, in recent phase I studies it was shown that Selinexor can be administered safely in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine in pediatric relapsed or refractory acute leukemia [121] as well as a single therapeutic in patients with solid tumors in advanced stages [118]. The efficacy of Selinexor in the latter study was monitored by immunohistochemical analyses on tumor biopsies evaluating cleaved caspase 3, p53, Apoptag, Ki67, and FOXO3A [118]. The response rates of these studies were promising enough to be further explored in phase II trials. Another recent study could demonstrate that Selinexor shows synthetic lethality with oncogenic KRAS in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [122]. The authors could pinpoint the accumulation of nuclear IkBa and associated inhibition of the transcriptional activity of NFkB [122] as the primary mechanism of Selinexor sensitivity. Moreover, YAP1 activation via mutant FSTL5 was demonstrated to render tumors resistant to Selinexor, which could be circumvented by co-administration of a YAP1-TEAD inhibitor [122]. Since YAP1 plays an important role in liver tumorigenesis [123] YAP1-mediated resistance to Selinexor needs to be considered in HCC trials. First in vitro and in vivo findings in HCC cell lines and xenograft models using Selinexor are encouraging [105] as Selinexor treatment in HCC cell lines leads to cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, increase of p53, p27, and PUMA expression while inhibiting the expression of c-myc and c-MET. Finally, oral application of Selinexor reduced tumor growth in HCC xenograft models by showing only mild toxicity [105]. Based on the aforementioned reports it appears that inhibiting exportin-1-dependent nuclear export has only little effect on non-tumorous tissue. This in turn suggest that the dependency of cancer cells on this nuclear export pathway is much stronger compared to non-transformed cells, to some extent reminiscent of the phenomenon called “oncogene addiction” [124]. Furthermore, the “addiction” of liver cancer cells may also be

transferred to other members of the NTS such as exportin-2/CAS, since its depletion strikingly reduces the viability of HCC cell lines [38], while not significantly affecting non-tumorous liver cells [46]. Thus, despite the fundamental and general function of the nuclear transport machinery cancer-specific effects can be achieved by targeting dysregulated NTS members.

Final remarks and outlook

There is accumulating evidence indicating dysregulation and functional as well as prognostic significance of nuclear transport factors in hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, referring to properties of ideal drug targets [125], nuclear transport factors such as exportin-1 seem to fulfill several of the following criteria: the target is disease modifying, modulation of the target is less important under physiological conditions, it can be assayed using high throughput screening, target/disease-specific biomarkers exist to monitor therapeutic efficacy, and prediction of potential side effects according to phenotype data is favourable. As there is great potential in targeting the nuclear transport system in liver carcinogenesis, well-designed clinical trials with genomic and immunohistochemical tumor preselection are required. For instance, exportin-1 inhibitors are expected to be most effective in tumors showing high exportin-1 expression and low levels of e.g. nuclear (wild-type) p53, p21, p27, FOXO, and I-kB, which could be analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in pretreatment biopsies. In addition, also potential opposite effects of SINE compounds could be anticipated since some protumorigenic proteins (e.g. STATs) are exported by exportin-1 as well and may therefore further accumulate in the nucleus. In this context it is important to note that NTR-cargo specificities as dictated by the interactome of relevant karyopherins have not yet been comprehensively analyzed in liver cancer cells. These analyses will not only reveal cargo specificities but also redundancies with the latter being most relevant for potential resistance mechanisms employed by cancer cells to escape anti-NTR treatment strategies. First studies in this direction are underway and will complement future functional and mechanistic approaches to define the settings in which SINE and other upcoming anti-transport compounds are most effective in HCC.

Figure 1 A left panel The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is embedded in the nuclear envelope and includes the indicated subcomplexes: cytoplasmic filaments, cytoplasmic ring, nuclear ring, inner ring, and nuclear basket. right panel The subcomplexes are composed of subsets of NUPs indicated as colour-coded boxes: Y-complexes in red; the inner ring complex in blue; the transmembrane NUPs in yellow; the NUP62 complex in orange; cytoplasmic complexes in green; and nuclear basket complexes are in purple. *The current version of the Figure uses parts of a figure from another Publication “Beck M, Hurt E. The nuclear pore complex: understanding its function through structural insight. Nature reviews Molecular cell biology 2017;18:73-89.” This is meant to be a template for re-designing by the graphic designer team of the “Journal of Hepatology” and NOT to be taken as the final figure.* B List of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) sorted based on their transport directionality (import = blue, export = red, bi-directional = black). TNPO = Transportin, IPO = Importin, KPNB = Karyopherin beta, KPNA = Karyopherin alpha = Importin-alpha (Imp-α) C Conventional import pathway either with a heterotrimeric complex containing Importin-β, Importin-α and a cargo protein with a classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) or a heterodimeric complex containing Importin-β and a cargo protein with a “non-classical” nuclear localization signal (NLS). Upon binding to RanGTP within the nucleus each of the complexes dissociate. D Export pathway with a trimeric complex containing RanGTP, exportin-1 (XPO1/CRM1) and a cargo protein with a nuclear export signal (NES). Upon conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP the complex dissociates in the cytoplasm. Also shown re-shuttling of Importin-alpha (Imp-α) by exportin-2 (XPO2/CAS) together with RanGTP and of Importin-β by RanGTP alone from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Figure 2 Levels at which members of the nuclear transport system (NTRs and/or Nups) can be linked to liver cancer relevant pathways: (1) import/export of transcription factors (TF) either NTR-dependent (blue) or -independent (red), (2) transcriptional regulation/chromatin interaction (light blue), or (3) post-transcriptional regulation such as mRNA (wavy black lines) export/stability (grey).

Table 1 The link between (liver-) cancer relevant pathways/proteins and members of the nuclear transport system are listed.
