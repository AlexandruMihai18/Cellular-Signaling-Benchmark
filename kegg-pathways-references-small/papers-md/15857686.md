### Abstract

Ca²⁺-dependent mechanisms are important in regulating synaptic transmission. The results herein indicate that whole-cell perfusion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP₃R) agonists greatly enhanced excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes in postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 neurons. IP₃R agonist-mediated increases in synaptic transmission changed during development and paralleled age-dependent increases in hippocampal type-1 IP₃Rs. IP₃R agonist-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes were inhibited by postsynaptic perfusion of inhibitors of Ca²⁺/calmodulin, PKC and Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Postsynaptic perfusion of inhibitors of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) Ca²⁺-ATPases, which deplete intracellular Ca²⁺ stores, also enhanced EPSC amplitudes. Postsynaptic perfusion of the IP₃R agonist adenophostin (AdA) during subthreshold stimulation appeared to convert silent to active synapses; synaptic transmission at these active synapses was completely blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Postsynaptic IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release also produced a significant increase in spontaneous EPSC frequency. These results indicate that Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores play a key role in regulating the function of postsynaptic AMPARs.

### 1. Introduction

Reversible changes in synaptic transmission, termed synaptic plasticity, are believed to contribute to the cellular basis of learning and memory [7]. Two frequently studied cellular models of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) [56]. Increases in postsynaptic Ca²⁺ from extra-and/or intra-cellular sources play critical roles in mechanisms that induce LTP and/or LTD. Historically, Ca²⁺ influx through NMDA receptors has been shown to trigger mechanisms important for the induction of LTP [12] or LTD [69]. Other routes and/or sources of intracellular Ca²⁺, however, have been shown to play roles in synaptic plasticity. Photolysis of caged glutamate stimulated Ca²⁺ influx into layer V pyramidal neurons through voltage-gated Ca²⁺-channels (VGCCs) due to NMDAR mediated activation of VGCCs [88]. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, GABA_A-R mediated currents undergo long lasting potentiation triggered by Ca²⁺ influx through VGCCs following the activation of climbing fibers [103]. Photolysis of caged Ca²⁺ in postsynaptic hippocampal neurons produced variable results including potentiation, depression or no apparent change in synaptic transmission [71]. Activation of synaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and downstream IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release produced synaptic potentiation in hippo-

campal neurons [4,36,75]. Postsynaptic injection of inhibitors of IP₃Rs and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) can block tetanus-induced LTP [107]. Photolytic release of caged-IP₃ in cerebellar Purkinje cells showed that IP₃ receptor (IP₃R)-mediated Ca²⁺ release induced LTD at parallel fiber synapses [28]. These findings indicate that postsynaptic Ca²⁺ dynamics can increase and/or decrease synaptic transmission. However, a detailed understanding of signaling pathways that regulate postsynaptic Ca²⁺ dynamics is incomplete.

Defining the sources and mechanisms by which changes in intracellular Ca²⁺ regulate downstream signaling pathways is essential in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of long- and short-term changes in synaptic transmission. Increases in neuronal Ca²⁺ can come from VGCCs, ligand-gated Ca²⁺ channels and/or release from intracellular stores. The studies herein tested the hypothesis that Ca²⁺ release from IP₃-regulated stores in postsynaptic neurons can stimulate Ca²⁺ and Ca²⁺/calmodulin (Ca²⁺/CaM) signaling pathways that enhance synaptic transmission. We show that postsynaptic perfusion of IP₃R agonists into CA1 neurons substantially enhanced transmission at AMPAR-mediated synapses. This increase in synaptic transmission required postsynaptic Ca²⁺/CaM, PKC and Ca²⁺/CaM-dependent protein kinase activities. In addition, postsynaptic perfusion of the IP₃R agonist adenophostin increased the probability of detecting synaptic responses during subthreshold presynaptic stimulation and increased spontaneous EPSC frequency, indicating that enhanced synaptic transmission may result from the conversion of silent to active synapses.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Hippocampal slices

Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats of postnatal age 7–46 days. Animals were deeply anesthetized with methoxyflurane or isoflurane, decapitated and brains were quickly removed. Tissue blocks containing hippocampus and overlying cortex were immediately dissected in oxygenated, ice-cold (4 °C), high Mg²⁺/low Ca²⁺ ACSF containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.3 NaH₂PO₄, 26 NaHCO₃, 4 or 6 MgCl₂, 0.5 CaCl₂, 10 dextrose and 10 HEPES (pH 7.25; HEPES was omitted when recording sEPSCs (final pH 7.30)). Tissue slices were prepared in this ACSF (ice-cold and gassed with 95% O₂/5% CO₂) using a Vibratome. Slices were then transferred to oxygenated “standard” ACSF (1.3 mM MgCl₂ and 2.4 mM CaCl₂ plus the other salts/HEPES at the concentrations above) at 25 °C for 1–2 h before being transferred to a submersion recording chamber (0.3 mL volume) perfused with standard ACSF at 31 °C. All experiments were conducted with rats using a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (University of Kansas).

### 2.2. Electrophysiology

Synaptic responses were recorded under whole-cell patch clamp conditions. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were either population or minimal responses evoked by different stimulation protocols. Bipolar tungsten electrodes (12 MΩ) were placed in the Schaffer collateral/commissural (S/C) pathway to evoke population (stimulus frequency at 0.05–0.1 Hz), or subthreshold EPSCs [40,51] in area CA1. Stimulus intensity was quickly adjusted at the start of each recording to evoke AMPAR EPSC amplitudes between 50–175 pA. Evoked test stimuli were delivered every 10 or 30 s. AMPAR EPSCs were recorded at V<sub>m</sub> = –75 mV under voltage-clamp conditions (10 kHz sampling rate) to preserve the voltage-dependent Mg²⁺ block of NMDARs [74]. Pipette resistances were between 6–8 MΩ for recording AMPAR EPSCs. Subthreshold stimulation intensity was adjusted just below the intensity that evoked detectable EPSCs and left at this level for the rest of the experiment. During some recordings, CNQX (50 μM) was added to slices to verify the identity of AMPAR synaptic transmission (see Figs. 8A and D); in each experiment, CNQX completely blocked evoked EPSCs. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were recorded from control and IP₃R agonist perfused neurons during evoked stimulation of S/C axons at 0.1 Hz for the initial 30 s, followed by continuous recordings for 12–16 min with evoked stimuli at 0.033 Hz (evoked EPSCs were recorded to verify that IP₃R agonists increased evoked EPSC amplitudes).

To reduce GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibitory currents on excitable synaptic transmission, orthodromic stimulating electrodes were placed far away from recording sites to reduce evoking monosynaptic GABAergic transmission by directly stimulating interneurons. Under these conditions, seizure activity was not observed during recordings of basal transmission or whole-cell perfusions.

Patch pipettes were used to perfuse modulators of intracellular signaling pathways during whole-cell recordings. Standard pipette solution contained (in mM) 120 K-glucoside, 20 KCl, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.5 tris-GTP (290–295 mOsmol) for recording AMPAR EPSCs. All pipette solutions were filtered with a 0.1 μm centrifuge filter before use. Where specified, pipette solutions also contained IP₃R agonists (adenophostin A (AdA), or 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (D,F-IP₃)), sulforhodamine (50 μM; a fluorescent tracer) or SERCA-ATPase inhibitors (thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA)). Thapsigargin or CPA was dissolved in 100% ethanol as 50 mM stocks and then diluted to the designated concentration (see Results) in standard pipette solution. In certain experiments, pipettes also contained pseudosubstrate inhibitors of CaM-kinase II ([Ala²⁸⁶]CaM-KII<sub>281–302</sub>; 100 μM [2,95]), or PKC (PKC<sub>19–31</sub>; 100 μM [39]), a calmodulin-binding peptide CBP (CaM-KII<sub>290–309</sub>; 50 μM [105]), or a control peptide KY8 that does not bind

calmodulin, or inhibit CaM-KII or PKC (50 μM [53]). In certain experiments, patch pipette tips were initially filled with standard solution and then back-filled with experimental solutions (e.g., standard solution plus 1 μM AdA). All EPSCs were recorded with Axopatch-1D amplifiers (voltage-clamp mode) with output bandwidth filtered at 2 kHz. Series resistances were monitored throughout all voltage-clamp recordings by measuring whole-cell currents to voltage pulses (5–10 mV for 50 ms).

All NMDA-receptor (NMDAR)-mediated EPSCs were recorded in slices perfused with 10 μM CNQX to block AMPAR-mediated currents, plus 50 μM picrotoxin to block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated currents (Fig. 5). All NMDA EPSCs were recorded under voltage-clamp conditions (V<sub>m</sub> = –44 mV) to relieve the voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDARs [74] at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. NMDAR currents were recorded with a pipette solution containing (in mM) 155 K-gluconate or 145 K-gluconate and 5 BAPTA, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.5 tris-GTP (305–310 mOsmol). Stimulus intensities were rapidly adjusted at the start of each recording to evoke NMDAR EPSC amplitudes between 50–80 pA. The Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in ACSF was decreased from 1.3 to 0.8 mM to facilitate recording NMDAR currents; pipette resistances varied between 3–5 MΩ. EPSCs mediated by NMDARs were confirmed by complete blockade with 100 μM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (results not shown).

### 2.3. Neuron selection

CA1 pyramidal neurons were selected by electrophysiological properties and morphological appearance using an infrared DIC microscope (Olympus BX-50 with 40X water-immersion objective). Somas of pyramidal neurons (diameter of ~20 μm) in CA1 stratum pyramidale appeared triangular or olive in shape with one major apical dendrite and a few basal dendrites. Pyramidal neurons typically displayed one action current (without any burst discharge) in response to a depolarizing voltage pulse (50 ms, 30–50 mV; results not shown).

### 2.4. Subthreshold stimulation parameters

During subthreshold stimulation, it was important to have a brief period at the start of each recording in which AdA was not dialyzed into neurons. To extend the baseline recording period, the tip of each patch pipette was first filled with standard solution and then back-filled with the same solution plus AdA (1 μM) and the fluorescent tracer sulforhodamine (50 μM, Molecular Probes). The entry of sulforhodamine into neurons was continuously monitored by epi-fluorescence during recordings. Under these conditions, “back filling” allowed ~2 min before sulforhodamine was detected entering neurons. Under these conditions, AdA-stimulated increases in EPSC amplitudes were not observed until approximately ~3.5 min after whole-cell access was obtained (results not shown). The threshold for detecting EPSCs was ~3 pA during subthreshold stimulation.

### 2.5. Immunoblot analysis

Hippocampi from different aged rat brains (PNDs 7–46) were quickly dissected from rat forebrains in ice-cold standard ACSF, immediately sonicated in 300 μL of SDS-PAGE buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Hippocampal extracts were stored in –80 °C before analysis. Protein determinations were done using the Micro-BCA reagent (Pierce Chemical Company, USA) and 50 μg of total protein from each extract was separated on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in Tris/Glycine buffer containing 20% methanol and 0.0025% SDS [2] and incubated overnight (4 °C) in 5% (w/v) powdered milk plus 1% BSA in PBS. Immunostaining was performed using a primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal) specific against the type-1 IP<sub>3</sub>R (~1:1000; [90]), followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Promega) (1:1000 to 1:3000) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham). Antibody incubations were for 2–3 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive intensities on X-ray films were quantitated by analyses of optical densities using NIH-Image freeware. Multiple exposures of each blot were analyzed to avoid potential problems with film saturation. Detection of type-1 IP<sub>3</sub>Rs under these conditions was linear up to 70 μg of total extract protein.

### 2.6. Data analysis

Results were compiled only from neurons in which stable recordings were obtained in the initial 2 min of whole-cell configuration, and stable membrane potentials between –73 and –78 mV (for AMPARs), or between –41 and –47 mV (for NMDARs), were maintained throughout recordings. Baseline values for experiments (i.e., first data point in each figure) were obtained by averaging initial slopes (or peak amplitudes in Figs. 5 and 8) of 2–5 consecutive EPSCs recorded during the initial minute of whole-cell recordings, and defined as 100%. Synaptic currents are expressed as means ± SEM. Series and input resistances were monitored throughout all experiments by measuring responses to 5 mV hyperpolarizing pulses (50 ms). For NMDAR recordings, peak amplitudes (I<sub>in</sub>) were measured throughout each experiment; only neurons whose amplitudes remained within 20% of initial baseline values (first 50 s) were accepted for analysis. For AMPAR recordings, only neurons without significant changes in series and input resistances were accepted for analysis. Data were obtained with pClamp 5.5 and analyzed with custom software to compute initial slopes of AMPAR EPSCs, or pClamp 8.2 and analyzed with Clampfit (Axon Instr.) to measure peak amplitudes of NMDAR EPSCs. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were

recorded in gap-free mode in Clampex 8.2, filtered at 0.5 kHz and analyzed with MiniAnalysis 6.03 (Synaptosoft). Student *t* tests were used for comparisons within the same treatment at different times, and Mann–Whitney rank-sum tests [33] were used for comparisons between different treatments at comparable experimental times. Paired *t* tests were used for comparisons of sEPSCs recorded during 0–2 min vs. 8–10 min periods for control and AdA-perfused neurons. All waveforms in figures were averages of 3–5 consecutive EPSCs recorded from a representative neuron during the initial 1–2 vs. 24–27 min after obtaining whole-cell configuration.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Postsynaptic perfusion of IP₃R agonists enhances excitatory synaptic transmission

Intracellular Ca²⁺ modulates diverse neuronal functions from transmitter release to synaptic plasticity [43,72,117]. To determine if postsynaptic Ca²⁺ release from IP₃R-regulated stores modulates synaptic transmission, we examined whole-cell perfusion of two different IP₃R agonists while recording excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) under voltage-clamp conditions. The first agonist used was D,F-IP₃, an IP₃ analog that cannot be phosphorylated by IP₃-kinase [47] but is very similar to IP₃ with respect to its affinity for IP₃Rs and its IC₅₀ in stimulating ⁴⁵Ca²⁺ release from microsomes [110]. Perfusion of D,F-IP₃ (50 μM) produced large increases in EPSC slopes in a representative CA1 neuron (Fig. 1A, gray circles) compared to a representative control neuron (Fig. 1A, open circles). When all neurons were averaged, D,F-IP₃ increased EPSC slopes by 383 ± 65% (gray circles, Fig. 1B, *n* = 7; *p* < 0.02 relative to controls) compared to control neurons (93 ± 7%,

Postsynaptic perfusion of IP₃R agonists increased AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission: (A) a representative neuron showing that perfusion of D,F-IP₃ (50 μM) increases EPSC slopes; (B) averaged group data showing that D,F-IP₃ induced substantial increases in synaptic transmission (*n* = 7; gray circles) compared to control neurons (standard solution in pipettes, *n* = 9; open circles); (C) a representative neuron showing that perfusion of adenophostin (AdA; 1 μM) rapidly increased EPSC slopes; and (D) averaged group data showing that AdA induced large increases in synaptic transmission (*n* = 8; gray circles) compared to controls (*n* = 9; open squares). The EPSC waveforms displayed here (insets, panels A and C) and all subsequent figures were averaged from 3–5 consecutive EPSCs recorded from each experimental condition from a representative neuron during the initial 1–2 min vs. 24–27 min after obtaining whole-cell access (calibration bars are 150 pA and 50 ms).

Inhibition of postsynaptic Ca²⁺-ATPase activities increased synaptic transmission: (A) a representative neuron showing that perfusion of thapsigargin (1 μM) increased synaptic transmission; (B) averaged group data showing that thapsigargin induced large increases in synaptic transmission ($n = 10$; gray circles) compared to control neurons (open circles; pipettes contained 0.1% EtOH in standard solution; $n = 7$); (C) a representative neuron showing that cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 10 μM) perfusion increased synaptic transmission; and (D) averaged group data showing that CPA induced substantial increases in synaptic transmission ($n = 10$; gray circles) compared to control neurons (open circles; pipettes contained 0.2% EtOH in standard solution; $n = 7$; calibration bars are 150 pA and 40 ms (see waveforms in panels A and C)).

$n = 9$; open circles, Fig. 1B). Values were averaged from EPSC slopes obtained during the 27–30 min period compared to the initial 1 min baseline for each condition for Figs. 1–4 and 7. We next examined the action of adenophostin (AdA; 1 μM), an IP₃ analog ~100-fold more potent than IP₃ in stimulating Ca²⁺ release and which is resistant to the actions of IP₃-kinases and IP₃-phosphatases [97]. Postsynaptic perfusion of AdA substantially increased EPSC slopes in a representative CA1 neuron (Fig. 1C, gray circles) compared to a control neuron (Fig. 1C, open circles). When all neurons were averaged, AdA perfusion produced a 380 ± 32% increase in EPSC slopes (Fig. 1D, gray circles; $n = 8$; $p < 0.001$) compared to controls (93 ± 7%; open circles; $n = 9$). AdA’s action in increasing EPSC slopes appeared to plateau by ~8 min of perfusion. The addition of CNQX (50 μM) to slice perfusion ACSF resulted in the complete disappearance of evoked EPSCs (see Fig. 8A), indicating that synaptic transmission was due to activation of AMPA-type GluRs. These results suggested that stimulation of Ca²⁺ release from postsynaptic IP₃R-regulated stores can substantially increase synaptic transmission.

### 3.2. Inhibitors of postsynaptic Ca²⁺-ATPases enhance synaptic transmission

Levels of cytoplasmic free Ca²⁺ are influenced by the dynamic balance between IP₃R- and RyR-mediated Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores and energy-dependent Ca²⁺ uptake via smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) Ca²⁺-ATPases [32]. The above results with IP₃R agonists indicated that Ca²⁺ release from postsynaptic Ca²⁺ stores triggered increases in synaptic transmission. One can also increase intracellular free Ca²⁺ by inhibiting Ca²⁺ transport by SER Ca²⁺-ATPases [32] with specific inhibitors of these Ca²⁺ transporters. To test this hypothesis, we examined the actions of thapsigargin [98] and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; [96]), two structurally unrelated Ca²⁺-ATPase inhibitors. Thapsigargin is a sesquiterpene lactone with tumor promoting activity [101], whereas CPA is a fungal metabolite with mycotoxin activity.

Postsynaptic perfusion of thapsigargin (1 μM), a potent Ca²⁺-ATPase inhibitor (IC₅₀ ~10 nM; [98]), increased EPSC slopes in a representative neuron that reached a plateau level within 10–15 min (Fig. 2A). When all neurons were averaged, thapsigargin increased EPSC slopes by 495 ± 62% (Fig. 2B, $n = 10$, gray circles) relative to control neurons (109 ± 7%, $n = 7$; $p < 0.02$; standard pipette solution containing 0.1% ethanol; Fig. 2B, open circles). Postsynaptic perfusion of CPA (10 μM) also greatly increased EPSC slopes in a representative CA1 neuron (Fig. 2C). When all neurons were averaged, CPA produced large increases in EPSC slopes (564 ± 78%; $n = 10$, $p < 0.02$; Fig. 2D, gray circles) compared to control neurons (154 ± 21% relative to baseline 100%, $n = 7$; standard pipette solution plus 0.2% ethanol; Fig. 2D, open circles). Thus, inhibition of postsynaptic Ca²⁺-

increases in EPSC slopes (103 ± 6% relative to baseline 100%; \( p < 0.02 \)) compared to neurons perfused with D,F-IP₃ alone (Fig. 3A, \( n = 7 \), open circles). Likewise, co-perfusion of CBP (100 μM, Fig. 3B; \( n = 11 \), black circles) blocked AdA-stimulated increases in EPSC slopes (99 ± 8% relative to baseline of 100%; \( p < 0.02 \)) compared to AdA alone (Fig. 3B; \( n = 8 \), open circles). In contrast, co-perfusion of KY8 (50 μM), a control peptide with no significant affinity for Ca²⁺/CaM [53], with AdA had no apparent effect on AdA-stimulated increases in EPSC slopes (398 ± 52% relative to baseline 100%; \( n = 6 \); Fig. 3C, black circles) compared to AdA alone (380 ± 32%, \( n = 8 \), \( p > 0.5 \); Fig. 3C, open circles).

The latter results demonstrated the importance of Ca²⁺/CaM signaling pathways in IP₃R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission. One likely target of Ca²⁺/CaM is Ca²⁺/CaM-dependent protein kinases, particularly CaM-KII which is enriched in postsynaptic structures [44]. Previous studies have shown that postsynaptic perfusion of inhibitors against CaM-KII can block the induction of tetanus-LTP [60,61]. We examined if postsynaptic CaM-KII activity was involved in IP₃R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission using the same CaM-KII inhibitors used in previous studies [106–109].

Fig. 3. Inhibition of postsynaptic Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent signaling pathways blocked IP₃R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission: (A) the co-perfusion of CBP (50 μM; high affinity calmodulin-binding peptide) blocked D,F-IP₃-mediated (50 μM) increases in synaptic transmission (filled circles; \( n = 7 \)) that were produced by D,F-IP₃ alone (open circles; same data as in Fig. 1B); (B) the co-perfusion of CBP (50 μM) blocked AdA-mediated (1 μM) increases in synaptic transmission (filled circles; \( n = 11 \)) that were produced by AdA alone (open circles; same data as in Fig. 1D); and (C) the co-perfusion of a control peptide KY8 that does not bind Ca²⁺/CaM (50 μM; filled circles; \( n = 6 \)) with AdA (1 μM) did not significantly affect AdA-mediated increases in synaptic transmission (open circles; same data as in Fig. 1D); calibration bars are 200 pA and 50 ms for waveforms.

ATPase activity, which should deplete intracellular Ca²⁺ stores, substantially increased synaptic transmission.

### 3.3. Signaling pathways involved in IP₃R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission

Prior studies have shown that postsynaptic Ca²⁺ and Ca²⁺/CaM-dependent signaling pathways are required for the induction of tetanus-LTP [60,61], up-regulation of synaptic transmission [105] and the maintenance of LTP expression [104,107]; but see Otmakhov et al. [77]. Since calmodulin (CaM) is a likely downstream target to be activated by IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release, we tested whether a CaM antagonist could attenuate D,F-IP₃- or AdA-stimulated increases in EPSC slopes. To do this, a CaM-binding peptide (CBP) [105] was co-perfused with D,F-IP₃ or AdA into CA1 neurons. CBP (100 μM, Fig. 3A; \( n = 7 \), black circles) strongly attenuated D,F-IP₃-stimulated

Fig. 4. Inhibition of postsynaptic CaM-KII and PKC activities blocked AdA-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission: (A) the co-perfusion of a CaM-KII pseudosubstrate inhibitor (CaM-KIIᵢ; 100 μM; \( n = 8 \); gray circles) greatly attenuated AdA-mediated (1 μM) increases in synaptic transmission (open circles; same data as Fig. 1D); and (B) the co-perfusion of a PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor (PKCᵢ; 100 μM; \( n = 10 \); gray circles) strongly attenuated AdA-mediated (1 μM) increases in synaptic transmission (open circles; same data as Fig. 1D); calibration bars are 200 pA and 40 ms for waveforms.

perfusion of the peptide CaM-KII$_{i}$ [105] with AdA strongly attenuated increases in EPSC amplitudes (123 ± 14% at 28–32 min relative to baseline 100%; $n = 8$, $p < 0.02$; Fig. 4A, gray circles) compared to AdA alone (open circles). These results indicated that postsynaptic CaM-KII activity plays an important role in IP$_{3}$R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission.

Intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ release can activate other downstream targets such as PKC [99]. In addition, Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization can upregulate phospholipase C (PLC) activity [25] and increase levels of IP$_{3}$ and diacylglyceride (DAG). IP$_{3}$ stimulated Ca$^{2+}$ release, plus DAG can stimulate PKC [73]. We examined if postsynaptic PKC activity contributed to IP$_{3}$R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission by using a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKC (PKC$_{i}$) [39]. Co-perfusion of PKC$_{i}$ with AdA substantially attenuated increases in EPSC slopes (116 ± 19% relative to baseline 100%; $n = 10$, $p < 0.02$; Fig. 4B, gray circles) compared to AdA alone (open circles). Taken together, these results indicate that postsynaptic CaM-KII and PKC activities play important roles in IP$_{3}$R agonist-induced increases in synaptic transmission.

### 3.4. AdA enhances NMDAR synaptic transmission

Previous results indicate that alterations in the cellular trafficking of NMDARs can change synaptic transmission [18,85]. Because AdA greatly enhanced synaptic AMPAR EPSCs, we wanted to determine if AdA also altered NMDAR-mediated EPSCs. Perfusion of AdA into postsynaptic CA1 neurons increased NMDAR EPSC amplitudes by 195 ± 19% at 25 min ($n = 9$; $p = 0.003$, Fig. 5A, gray circles) compared to control neurons (101 ± 1% at 25 min, $n = 15$; open circles). To determine if increases in NMDAR currents required postsynaptic Ca$^{2+}$, we co-perfused BAPTA (5 mM) with AdA. AdA-stimulated increases in NMDAR EPSC amplitudes (Fig. 5A) were greatly attenuated by co-perfusing BAPTA (99 ± 7.5% at 25 min ($n = 9$); $p = 0.11$, Fig. 5B, gray circles). Interleaved neurons perfused with BAPTA alone were not significantly different from controls (118 ± 10% at 25 min ($n = 15$), Fig. 5A, open circles). These results indicate that, similar to AMPAR EPSCs, whole-cell perfusion of AdA increases NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents and this increase depends on postsynaptic Ca$^{2+}$.

### 3.5. Developmental changes in type I IP$_{3}$R and AdA-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission

Many studies of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity have used brain slices from young rats (e.g., postnatal days (PNDs) 10–21) because slices and neurons are more healthy compared to slices from older rodents (>25 days of age; see [58]). However, the expression of intracellular signaling molecules such as PKC [38], CaM-KII [15] and calcineurin [84] change dramatically during early postnatal development. Thus, mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission/plasticity could change considerably during this period of development. Since the AMPAR results described above were obtained from PND 18–24 slices, we decided to examine changes in hippocampal IP$_{3}$Rs during postnatal development. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes the type-I IP$_{3}$R [90], a major IP$_{3}$R isoform in hippocampus [91], we examined the developmental expression of IP$_{3}$Rs between PNDs 7 and 46. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from hippocampal slices revealed dramatic increases in the levels of type-1 IP$_{3}$R between PNDs 7 and 46 (Figs. 6A and B). Although type-1 IP$_{3}$R was detected at PND 7, analyses revealed an approximate 18-fold increase in type-1 IP$_{3}$R immunoreactivity between PNDs 11 and 24 (Fig. 6B). As previously shown [91], the levels of type-1 IP$_{3}$R in adult cerebellum (Fig. 6A, right lane, asterisk) were many times greater than 46 day-old hippocampus. These results predict that the role of IP$_{3}$R-mediated signaling pathways in regulating synaptic transmission should increase considerably during postnatal maturation.

If one of the primary targets for AdA is IP$_{3}$Rs, and IP$_{3}$R-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release is critically linked to enhancing synaptic transmission, then one would expect that the

### 3.6. AdA-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission during subthreshold stimulation

The results above indicated that IP₃R agonists substantially increased synaptic transmission of population EPSCs (Fig. 1D). Do IP₃R agonists increase synaptic transmission at one or a few synapses? To examine this possibility, we used a subthreshold stimulation protocol similar to minimal stimulation procedures that provided evidence for the conversion of silent to active synapses as a mechanism underlying synaptic potentiation [40,51]. At the beginning of each experiment, we delivered 2–3 afferent stimuli at intensities that evoked unmistakable EPSCs (10 to 25 pA), and then decreased stimulus intensity so that 4–5 consecutive stimuli evoked one or no EPSCs. EPSCs with amplitudes >3 pA were reliably detected. This initial period of the protocol lasted ~1.5 min. To increase the time for recording baseline EPSCs at the beginning of each experiment, patch pipettes were front-filled with standard solution and then back-filled with standard solution plus AdA (1 μM). Based on whole-cell perfusions with the fluorescent tracer sulforhodamine (comparable in molecular weight to AdA; see Methods), this protocol allowed ~2 min delay before AdA began perfusing into CA1 neurons.

A representative experiment showing AdA perfusion during subthreshold stimulation to a PND 22 neuron is shown in Figs. 8A and B. Following the decrease in stimulation intensity after the initial ~1.5 min of whole-cell recording (these EPSC amplitudes are not plotted in Fig. 8; see above), the next ~2 min of subthreshold stimulation failed to evoke EPSCs (see waveforms “a”, Fig. 8A). During the next 10 min of AdA perfusion (60 stimuli), EPSCs emerged and rapidly increased in amplitude. During this period, and before the addition of CNQX (see below), every stimulus produced a clearly detectable EPSC (see waveforms “b”, Fig. 8A). The distribution of EPSC amplitudes from this PND 22 neuron (Fig. 8B) showed that EPSCs recorded during the initial 4 min displayed amplitudes that approximated background noise (<3 pA, black bars), whereas EPSCs recorded during the 4–24 min period before CNQX application displayed amplitudes between 5 and 40 pA, with a majority between 10 and 30 pA (gray bars). During many subthreshold stimulation experiments, the addition of CNQX (50 μM) caused a complete disappearance of evoked EPSCs (see waveforms “c”, Figs. 8A and D), indicating that synaptic EPSCs were mediated by AMPA-type GluRs. Following CNQX washout, EPSCs reappeared (see waveforms “d”, Figs. 8A and D).

Group data from subthreshold experiments for PND 22–24 neurons are shown in Fig. 8C (n = 7). Evoked EPSCs were analyzed for failures vs. successes during the initial 4 min (0–4) vs. 20–24 min after beginning AdA perfusion. The probability of detecting evoked EPSCs during the 0–4 min period averaged 9.4±6.4% and the probability increased substantially to 84.5 ± 21.1% (n = 7) following

Fig. 7. AdA-mediated amplification of synaptic transmission increased during postnatal development: developmental changes in EPSC slopes are presented for seven data sets based on postnatal days (PNDs) of hippocampal slices; the youngest group was PNDs 7–9 and the oldest PNDs 22–30. Patch pipettes contained AdA (1 μM) and recordings were conducted for 30 min (each group contained 7–11 neurons). The left panel shows averaged changes in EPSC slopes (± SEM) during 30 min of AdA perfusion and the right panel displays the statistical analyses of EPSC slope averages during the 24–26 min period of AdA perfusion relative to baseline values (100%) obtained during the first minute of each recording. Representative EPSC waveforms (top of figure) recorded during the first minute vs. 24–26 min of AdA perfusion (calibration bars are 150 pA and 50 ms for waveforms).

20–24 min of AdA perfusion. Four out of seven PND 22–24 neurons displayed EPSC probabilities that increased to 100% during AdA perfusion (Fig. 8C, open symbols). Control neurons perfused with standard pipette solution (*n* = 4) displayed EPSC probabilities that changed very little during recordings; probabilities averaged 5.2 ± 2.3% during 0–4 min and 7.7 ± 4.6% at 20–24 min (Fig. 8C, gray symbols). These results indicated that IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release enhanced synaptic transmission at a few or single synapses, and that the underlying mechanism may be the conversion of silent to active synapses.

Because AdA's enhancement of population EPSCs increased greatly between PNDs 10 and 21 (Fig. 7), we examined subthreshold stimulation in PND 10–13 neurons. Fig. 8D shows a representative recording of a PND 13 neuron in which subthreshold stimulation did not evoke detectable EPSCs during the initial 2 min (see waveforms “a”, Fig. 8D). During the next 10 min of AdA perfusion (i.e., 60 stimuli), stimulation evoked EPSCs of increasing amplitudes prior to the addition of CNQX (see waveforms “b”, Fig. 8D). Application of CNQX caused the complete disappearance of evoked EPSCs indicating that transmission was due to AMPA-type GluRs (see waveforms “c”, Fig. 8D). The cumulative histogram of EPSC amplitudes for this experiment (Fig. 8E) showed that EPSCs recorded during the initial 0–4 min displayed amplitudes that approximated background noise (<3 pA, black bars), whereas EPSCs recorded during the 4 min immediately before CNQX application displayed amplitudes between 4 and 20 pA (Fig. 8E, gray bars).

Group data for subthreshold recordings in PND 10–13 neurons are shown in Fig. 8F (*n* = 7); EPSCs were analyzed for failures vs. successes as in Fig. 8C. These experiments showed that the probability of detecting evoked EPSCs during the initial 0–4 min averaged 7.1 ± 5.2%, and increased to 68.3 ± 12.9% during 20–24 min of AdA perfusion. In contrast to PND 22–24 CA1 neurons, AdA-induced increases in the probability of detecting EPSCs in each PND 10–13 neuron never reached 100%. Like PND 22–24 neurons, these results suggest that postsynaptic IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release enhanced synaptic transmission by the conversion of silent to active synapses. Moreover, IP₃R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission during postnatal development parallel increases in hippocampal type-1 IP₃Rs (Fig. 6).

### 3.7. AdA-mediated effects on spontaneous AMPAR EPSCs

We examined AMPAR spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) in control and AdA-perfused neurons to determine if postsynaptic Ca²⁺ release influenced the amplitude and/or frequency of sEPSCs. We analyzed the amplitudes and inter-event intervals of sEPSCs during the first 2 min of control or AdA recordings (PND 14–18 slices) and compared these values to those obtained 8–10 min after whole-cell access. S/C axons were stimulated once every 30 s during these experiments to record evoked EPSCs. Postsynaptic perfusion of AdA resulted in a 469 ± 63% increase in evoked EPSC amplitudes at 8 min (*n* = 16; *p* < 0.001; Fig. 9C, inset, black circles) compared to control

Fig. 8. AdA-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes during subthreshold stimulation increased substantially during postnatal development: these analyses show whole-cell recordings from PND 22–24 neurons (A, B and C; $n = 7$) compared to PND 10–13 CA1 neurons (D, E and F; $n = 7$) during AdA (1 μM) perfusion. (A and D) Recordings from neurons during subthreshold stimulation showing AdA-stimulated emergence of EPSCs in a representative PND 22 (A) vs. PND 13 neurons (D) subthreshold stimuli were delivered every 10 s for 40 min (A) or 30 min (D), and then CNQX (50 μM) was applied for ~10 min (horizontal bars) followed by washout with standard ACSF. Representative waveforms (six consecutive superimposed EPSCs) are shown in panels A and D that correspond to the different times (letters a, b, c and d; calibration bars are 25 pA and 50 ms). (B and E) Histograms of EPSC amplitudes for experiments shown in panels A and D, respectively; black bars indicate EPSC amplitudes recorded during the initial 4 min of each experiment, and gray bars represent EPSCs recorded during the 25 min preceding CNQX perfusion.

neurons (107 ± 8.2% at 8 min, $n = 13$; open circles), illustrating the same effect of AdA observed previously (Fig. 1). AdA did not significantly affect the amplitude of sEPSCs at 8–10 min compared to the initial 2 min of recordings (Fig. 9B); no significant change in amplitudes was observed in control neurons (Fig. 9A). In contrast, AdA-perfused neurons showed significant decreases in inter-event intervals at 8–10 min compared to 0–2 min (100–1400 ms interval, $p < 0.01$; 1500–3700 ms interval, $p < 0.05$), reflecting an increase in frequency of sEPSCs in this time window (Fig. 9D). We observed no significant change in sEPSC frequency in control neurons. Event traces for a representative AdA neuron showed this increase in sEPSC frequency (Fig. 9B, inset). This increase in frequency was also evident when the total number of sEPSCs in the first 2 min was compared to the 8–10 min window (data not shown). Control neurons did not show a significant increase in the number of sEPSCs between the two time windows (6.0 ± 1.9% increase; $p = 0.19$), while AdA-perfused neurons showed a significant increase in the number of sEPSCs in the later time window (71 ± 1.9% increase; $p = 0.013$).

### 4. Discussion

Ca²⁺ is key in regulating transmitter release and intracellular networks that modulate neuronal functions. Increases in postsynaptic Ca²⁺ trigger the induction of LTP and LTD, two cellular models of synaptic plasticity. The induction of LTP and LTD requires NMDA receptor-mediated Ca²⁺ influx [12,69]. In contrast, some forms of synaptic plasticity require Ca²⁺ influx via VGCCs [35,111]. Excitatory synaptic currents mediated by AMPARs can depolarize dendrites, activate VGCCs and generate substantial Ca²⁺ influx in the absence of action potentials [26]. Tetanus-induced LTP is blocked by inhibitors of IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release [75] or postsynaptic injection of inhibitors of IP₃R- and RyR-mediated Ca²⁺ release [107]. Thus, intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics due to extracellular influx or release from intracellular stores contribute to plastic changes in synaptic transmission.

We tested the hypothesis that Ca²⁺ release from postsynaptic stores in CA1 neurons can modulate excitatory synaptic transmission. We observed that stimulating Ca²⁺

Fig. 9. Postsynaptic perfusion of AdA increased AMPAR sEPSC frequencies in CA1 pyramidal neurons: sEPSCs were recorded for 12–16 min from control (A and C; $n = 13$) or AdA-perfused neurons (B and D; $n = 16$) and cumulative fraction histograms of sEPSC amplitudes and inter-event intervals (frequencies) were computed; group data represent comparisons between events obtained during the initial 2 min (filled circles) vs. 8–10 min (open circles) of whole-cell recordings. Insets show sEPSC waveforms from representative control (A) and AdA-perfused neurons (B). Calibration bars are 10 pA and 1 s. Evoked EPSCs were recorded every 30 s and showed large AdA-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes compared to control neurons (inset, C). Error bars indicated averaged values ± SEM. The horizontal bars in panel D indicate significance values between 0–2 vs. 8–10 min recording periods during AdA perfusion (*$p < 0.01$, and **$p < 0.05$).

release by postsynaptic perfusion of the IP₃R agonists AdA or D,F-IP₃ enhanced synaptic transmission (Fig. 1). We demonstrated that depleting postsynaptic Ca²⁺ stores with inhibitors of SER Ca²⁺-ATPases (thapsigargin and CPA) also enhanced synaptic transmission (Fig. 2). Thapsigargin has been shown to block tetanus-induced Ca²⁺ enhancements and LTP in CA1 neurons [63]. We have recently shown that co-perfusion of BAPTA with AdA strongly attenuated the large increase in EPSC amplitudes produced by AdA, indicating that IP₃R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission require intracellular Ca²⁺ [59]. We showed herein that IP₃R agonist-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission are strongly attenuated by co-perfusion of peptide inhibitors of Ca²⁺/CaM (Fig. 3), PKC or CaM-KII (Fig. 4). The activities of these postsynaptic protein kinases are required for tetanus-induced LTP [60,61].

One rationale for our studies was based on previous experiments which showed that activation of mGluRs and downstream IP₃-dependent Ca²⁺ release increased synaptic transmission [4,36,78]. IP₃Rs are phosphorylated and modulated by many protein kinases [79], including CaM-KII, PKG, tyrosine kinases, PKA and PKC. In addition, IP₃Rs are regulated by Ca²⁺ [29] and Ca²⁺/CaM [66]. IP₃Rs are tethered to mGluRs via Homer [113] which helps insure that activation of synaptic mGluRs and downstream G-
release and activation of signaling pathways underlying synaptic plasticity [67,76].

Immunohistochemical localization at light and EM levels shows that the type-1 IP₃R is a major isoform in CA1 pyramidal neurons where it is enriched in dendritic shafts and spines [91]. Studies have also shown that ryanodine receptors are enriched in CA1 dendrites and spines [91] where they could contribute to IP₃-mediated Ca²⁺ release through Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release [31]. Electrophysiological findings show that mGluR1 and mGluR5 receptors are present on CA1 pyramidal neurons where they play important roles in regulating neuronal excitability and intracellular Ca²⁺ release [62,70,86]. In contrast, immunohistochemical evidence suggests that there are very few if any mGluR1s in CA1 pyramidal neurons [30]. Mice lacking mGluR5 show impaired learning and reduced LTP in CA1, but normal LTP in CA3 [55]. Together, these findings indicate that mGluR signaling pathways underlying IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release are present in dendrites and can regulate neuronal excitability, Ca²⁺ release and synaptic plasticity.

Our results show that IP₃R agonist-stimulated synaptic strengthening significantly increases during postnatal development. Postsynaptic perfusion of AdA in PND 7–9 neurons failed to alter synaptic transmission, whereas AdA-mediated increases in synaptic transmission displayed large increases between PNDs 13 and 21 (Fig. 7). Age-dependent changes in AdA-mediated increases in synaptic transmission paralleled increases in hippocampal type-1 IP₃Rs (Fig. 6). Type-1 IP₃R is a major IP₃R subtype in CA1 neurons [91], and AdA stimulates Ca²⁺ release by all three IP₃R subtypes [57].

AdA does not directly stimulate Ca²⁺ influx through the plasma membrane [57]. However, AdA-stimulated Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores can stimulate Ca²⁺ influx through stores-operated Ca²⁺ channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane of many cells including neurons [57,83]. Thus, AdA-stimulated increases in synaptic transmission (Fig. 1) could be augmented by Ca²⁺ influx into postsynaptic neurons via SOCs. AdA has ~100-fold greater affinity for IP₃Rs compared to IP₃ [97] or D,F-IP₃ [110]. These differences in affinity for IP₃Rs are thought to underlie variations in time-to-peak of intracellular Ca²⁺ release induced by AdA (slower ~3–8 min) vs. IP₃ (faster ~1–2 min) in frog oocytes [11,57]. AdA’s much greater affinity for IP₃Rs causes it to bind tighter/longer and thus move more slowly through the cytoplasm. Despite their differences in IP₃R affinity, AdA-or D,F-IP₃-stimulated increases in transmission were similar in kinetics and magnitude (Fig. 1). Although we do not know the precise intracellular concentration of AdA achieved during whole-cell perfusions (we used 1 μM in pipettes), Ca²⁺ imaging studies have shown that cellular injections of AdA that achieved intracellular concentrations of ~2 μM stimulated Ca²⁺ release without depleting Ca²⁺ stores [57]. Therefore, we believe that whole-cell perfusion of AdA in our experiments stimulates intracellular Ca²⁺ release without depleting Ca²⁺ stores.

Estimates of \[Ca^{2+}\]i in SER stores range from 60 μM to 2 mM [16] and IP₃-stimulated release can reduce Ca²⁺ stores to 1–50 μM [68]. Postsynaptic perfusion of IP₃R agonists rapidly increased in EPSC amplitudes that plateaued in ~8 min and were maintained for 30 min (Fig. 1). Studies using permeabilized hepatocytes showed that AdA, like IP₃, induced rapid increases in Ca²⁺ levels that peaked in ~1 s and decreased to near baseline values in 3–5 s [1]. Likewise, injections of the metabolically stable IP₃ analog (2,4,5)IP₃ into lacrimal acinar cells produced submaximal intracellular Ca²⁺ release that peaked within 30 s after injection and returned to baseline Ca²⁺ levels within ~90 s [10]. In the much larger Xenopus oocyte, injections of AdA achieving intracellular concentrations of ~250 nM produced increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ that peaked in 2–3 min and returned to near baseline levels in 4–5 min [11]. Based on these previous results, we believe that postsynaptic perfusion of IP₃R agonists may cause a rapid but transient release of intracellular Ca²⁺, and the accompanying increase in synaptic strength is sustained because cytotoxic levels of intracellular Ca²⁺ are not produced.

Studies with microsomes [9] or synaptosomes [29] showed that IP₃-stimulated Ca²⁺ release was modulated by Ca²⁺ in a bell-shaped manner (highest release at ~0.5 μM Ca²⁺). In contrast, purified type-1 IP₃R reconstituted in lipid bilayers displayed no Ca²⁺-dependent regulation, and the addition of Ca²⁺/calmodulin to the reconstituted IP₃Rs completely blocked IP₃-stimulated channel openings [66]. In addition, calmodulin inhibitors blocked Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation of IP₃-stimulated Ca²⁺ currents in microsomes. These results indicate that calmodulin mediates the Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation of type-1 IP₃Rs at Ca²⁺ levels >1 μM [66]. We observed that IP₃R agonist-mediated increases in synaptic transmission were blocked by a calmodulin inhibitory peptide (Fig. 3), suggesting that inhibition acts on pathways downstream of Ca²⁺ release, possibly by inhibiting Ca²⁺/CaM and CaM-KII pathways.

One target of IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release is the Ca²⁺/calmodulin activated protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). CaN is active under basal conditions because inhibiting postsynaptic CaN activity increased basal synaptic transmission and this increase was blocked by inhibitors of ryanodine- and IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ release [108]. CaN is tethered to IP₃Rs via the FK506-binding protein FKBP-12 [17]. The conventional PKC isoform (i.e., activated by Ca²⁺ and DAG) phosphorylates IP₃Rs and increases their sensitivity to IP₃ [17]. Atypical isoforms of PKC (e.g., PKC lambda) that are directly activated by Ca²⁺ could also upregulate IP₃R activity by phosphorylation [79]. The CaN tethered to IP₃Rs can dephosphorylate the stimulatory site phosphorylated by PKC [17], thereby decreasing IP₃R sensitivity to IP₃. Thus, CaN may comprise a negative feedback mechanism that when activated by Ca²⁺ release would dephosphorylate IP₃Rs and make them less sensitive to IP₃.CaN is also involved in receptor internalization. CaN has been shown to bind dynamin in a \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\)-dependent manner, and dynamin physically links CaN to functional endocytic complexes [48]. Moreover, inhibition of CaN in vivo inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis. CaN's dephosphorylation of dynamin is a critical step in the assembly of functional endocytosis complexes [94]. Together, these studies indicate that the CaN–dynamin complex is a \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) sensor for vesicular endocytosis. Cell surface receptors (e.g., GluRs) undergo clathrin-mediated endocytosis [93]. For example, NMDAR activation triggers AMPAR endocytosis by a mechanism that involves \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx and CaN activity [8]. It is possible that CaN-mediated receptor endocytosis may be activated during AdA-stimulated intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release. However, our studies indicate that during IP\(_3\)R-agonist stimulated \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release the balance between the insertion and internalization of AMPARs greatly favors insertion which results in large increases in synaptic transmission.

Postsynaptic perfusion of AdA caused the emergence of EPSCs during subthreshold stimulation (Fig. 8). At the beginning of recordings, stimulation failed to evoke EPSCs, however at later times AdA dramatically increased EPSC amplitudes and detection probability. AdA-stimulated increases in EPSC amplitudes and detection probability were greater in PND 22–24 compared to PND 10–13 neurons, indicating the maturation of downstream signaling pathways during this period. Substantial developmental increases in the expression of PKC [38], CaM-KII [15,45] and type-1 IP\(_3\)R (results herein) occur between PNDs 10 and 24. In light of findings showing the conversion of silent to active AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission during postnatal development [24], or LTP [40,51], our results suggest that IP\(_3\)R agonist-induced \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release greatly increases postsynaptic responsiveness to glutamate. These changes may be due to the up-regulation of AMPAR function by phosphorylation (e.g., CaM-KII) [22] and/or trafficking of intracellular receptors to synapses [52,82].

Postsynaptic perfusion of AdA produced a significant increase in the frequency of sEPSCs (Fig. 9). Historically, presynaptic mechanisms were believed to modulate sEPSC frequency and/or paired-pulse facilitation (PPF; [116]), whereas changes in sEPSC amplitude were due to postsynaptic mechanisms [87]. These relationships may be oversimplified because exceptions have been observed. For example, modulation of postsynaptic \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} /\) CaM signaling pathways changed PPF at CA1 synapses [107], and the conversion of silent to active synapses alters sEPSC frequency [42,54]. Our observed AdA-mediated increase in sEPSC frequency could be due to the generation of retrograde messengers which feedback on presynaptic terminals to increase release probability and enhance release frequency (either spontaneous or action potential-mediated). The chief retrograde messengers include nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), arachidonic acid (AA) and platelet-activating factor (PAF), and the generation of all these messengers is directly regulated by \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) or \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} / \mathrm{CaM}\) [6,13,14]. Thus, AdA-stimulated release of intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) could activate phospholipase A\(_2\) and generate PAF and AA, or combine with CaM and activate nitric oxide synthase and heme oxygenase-2, generating NO and CO. Any one or a combination of these retrograde messengers could increase sEPSC frequency. However, NO may not function as a retrograde messenger in our experiments because extracellular application of a NO scavenger had no effect on \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} / \mathrm{CaM}\)-mediated increases in sEPSC frequency at excitatory synapses on presumptive interneurons [109]. In addition, extracellular NO scavengers had no affect on synaptic potentiation induced by injecting \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} / \mathrm{CaM}\) into CA1 pyramidal neurons [46].

One potential postsynaptic mechanism for the observed increases in sEPSC frequencies (Fig. 9) is the conversion of silent to active synapses [41,51]. AdA-mediated \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release could stimulate the insertion of new AMPARs at synapses containing very few AMPARs and NMDARS, or only NMDARs, causing the emergence of sEPSCs and increasing sEPSC frequency. Alternatively, AdA could increase the amplitude of very small sEPSCs that were initially hidden in the baseline noise and thereby increase sEPSC frequency. Increasing synaptic strength by the insertion of AMPARs at silent or weak synapses could increase the frequency of sEPSCs observed at 8–10 min (Fig. 9D), especially sEPSCs with very low initial amplitudes.

The AdA-mediated increase of sEPSC frequency without a corresponding increase in sEPSC amplitude is perplexing; especially because AdA produced such a huge increase in evoked EPSC amplitudes (Fig. 1). One explanation for this result may be that AdA-mediated increases in evoked EPSCs require repetitive presynaptic activity (e.g., action potential driven transmitter release). During evoked stimulation of AdA-perfused neurons, we repeatedly activated the same population of presynaptic terminals. In contrast, sEPSCs can occur at any one of 30,000 excitatory terminals on a CA1 pyramidal neuron [65]. Based on this extraordinary number of presynaptic terminals on a single postsynaptic neuron, it is very unlikely that multiple sEPSCs will occur at the same synapse during a typical experiment. If repetitive pre- and postsynaptic co-activity is required to increase sEPSC amplitudes, then one would not expect sEPSC amplitudes to increase during AdA perfusion. We believe AdA-mediated activation of silent synapses may be a major mechanism that increases evoked EPSC amplitudes. The AdA-mediated conversion of silent to active synapses is supported by our results using subthreshold stimulation (Fig. 8). Consistent with this possibility, we have shown that AdA’s potentiation of evoked EPSC amplitudes is due in large part to the synaptotagmin-mediated insertion of synaptic AMPARs [59]. Overall, the AdA-mediated increases in evoked EPSC amplitudes are likely due to the addition of AMPARs to active or silent synapses and/or increasing AMPAR function via phosphorylation [19].
Postsynaptic perfusion of a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKC strongly attenuated AdA-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes (Fig. 4B). We recently demonstrated that selective inhibition of interactions between GluR2/3s and the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1 strongly attenuated AdA-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes [59]. PDZ domains are important protein–protein binding motifs that regulate the trafficking/anchoring of AMPARs [23], and GluR2/3s preferentially bind class II PDZ domains in PICK1. PICK1 has been localized to spines and dendrites [112] and activation of PKC induced co-localization of PICK1, GluR2 and PKC in dendritic spines [21,80].

Although the exact role of PKC in AdA-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes is unclear, we believe that signaling between PKC, PICK1 and GluR2/3 may be critical. PKC modulates AMPA receptor trafficking by phosphorylating Ser<sup>880</sup> in GluR2/3; this inhibits GluR2/3’s interaction with GRIP/ABP but not PICK1 [64]. We suggest that AdA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release stimulates PKC’s phosphorylation of Ser<sup>880</sup> in GluR2/3 which releases receptors tethered by GRIP/ABP to intracellular storage sites. This facilitates the binding of GluR2/3s to PICK1, promoting receptor trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane and increasing synaptic transmission. The role of PICK1 in synaptic plasticity is supported by studies showing that over-expression of PICK1 in CA1 neurons significantly increased AMPAR EPSC amplitudes [100]. In addition, increases in synaptic transmission due to PICK1 over-expression were blocked by inhibitors of PKC or CaM-KII. This dependence on PKC/CaM-KII activities is similar to our results on AdA-mediated increases in synaptic transmission (Fig. 4).

Hayashi et al. [37] reported that CaM-KII activity during LTP drives AMPARs to synapses by a mechanism that requires the association between GluR1 and PDZ domain proteins. We have shown that postsynaptic perfusion of peptides that interfere with interactions between GluR2/3 and the PDZ domain proteins GRIP/ABP and/or PICK1 inhibited AdA-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes [59]. We observed that postsynaptic perfusion of peptides that inhibit the synaptotagmin-SNARE-dependent exocytotic machinery decreased AdA-stimulated increases in EPSC amplitudes [59]. Together, these studies indicate that stimulating postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release increases synaptic transmission by enhancing the insertion and/or anchoring of synaptic AMPARs.

Postsynaptic perfusion of AdA increased NMDAR EPSC amplitudes and this increase was blocked by co-perfusion of BAPTA (Fig. 5). This result suggests that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release can regulate the numbers and/or function of synaptic NMDARs. AdA-stimulated increases in NMDAR EPSC amplitudes developed slowly and did not appear to plateau until 25–30 min (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the time course of AdA-stimulated increases in AMPAR EPSCs was rapid and plateaued within 10 min (Fig. 1D).

Increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can activate CaM-KII and PKC signaling pathways which could directly or indirectly upregulate NMDAR function. Injection of PKC into neurons reduces the voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDARs which can increase NMDAR EPSCs [20]. Phosphorylation of the endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (RXR) in NMDAR1 by PKC facilitates the trafficking of NMDARs to the cell surface [89]. Increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplifies PKC’s ability to enhance NMDAR functions [115], and the association of NMDAR-2B with CaM-KII stabilizes this kinase in an active conformation [5]. PKC enhancement of NMDA currents can arise from the insertion of new NMDARs via SNARE-dependent exocytosis, or by increasing open channel probability of NMDARs [49]. Activation of mGluR1s enhances NMDAR currents and involves increases in \[Ca<sup>2+</sup>\]<sub>i</sub> and PKC activity [92]. Moreover, mGluR1 activation accelerates the trafficking of NMDARs to the cell surface [50]. Synaptic NMDARs are highly mobile, and increases in NMDAR currents may arise from lateral diffusion of NMDARs from extrasynaptic sites to synapses [102]. In addition, PKC activation preferentially increases the lateral mobility of extra-junctional vs. synaptic NMDARs [34], which could increase the number of synaptic NMDARs. Together, these multiple signaling pathways involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PKC can modulate the cell surface mobility, trafficking and/or function of NMDARs.

IP<sub>3</sub>R activation stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores which can increase the levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. Persechini and colleagues showed that the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is rate limiting under basal conditions and cannot activate many target proteins [81]. Functional concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM were not detected until free Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased above 0.2 μM. Activation of postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-regulated protein kinases can enhance the phosphorylation and function of AMPARs [3]. IP<sub>3</sub>R agonist-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release can also activate PLC [25] and increase levels of DAG/IP<sub>3</sub>, which would stimulate PKC’s phosphorylation of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs [17] and increase Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release [29]. Stimulation of these pathways should increase \[Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM\]<sub>i</sub> and CaM-KII activity in parallel with up-regulating AMPAR functions. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> could also stimulate the translocation/conversion of silent AMPARs to functional synaptic receptors [82]. Collectively, this network of postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways can play an important role in regulating the dynamics of synaptic transmission in the CNS.
