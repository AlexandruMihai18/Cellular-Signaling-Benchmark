## Abstract

Studies with invertebrates and vertebrates have strongly implicated the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway in long-term memory (LTM) and transcriptionally-dependent L-LTP. It is hypothesized that LTM and L-LTP are both dependent upon a Ca²⁺ signal generated through activation of NMDA receptors. This review discusses evidence that Ca²⁺ signals generated through activation of NMDA receptors coactivate the Erk/MAP kinase and cAMP signal transduction pathways. It is hypothesized that activation of these two regulatory pathways increases the transcription of a family of genes through the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway. Gene disruption studies have shown that Ca²⁺-activated adenylyl cyclases play a critical role in generating the cAMP signal required for LTM and L-LTP. Although cAMP may be required for several events in this complex signal transduction cascade, one of the major roles of cAMP may be to support nuclear translocation of Erk/MAP kinase in hippocampal neurons. © 2001 ISDN.

## 1. Introduction

One of the remarkable features of the central nervous system is its ability to process and store enormous amounts of information. Consequently, there is intense interest in the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory in vertebrates (Kandel, 1997; Dubnau and Tully, 1998; Stevens, 1998) as well as the relationships between synaptic plasticity and memory (Bliss and Lomo, 1973; Collingridge and Bliss, 1995; Stevens, 1998). LTP in the hippocampus and other areas of brain is a usage-dependent increase in synaptic plasticity that may be an appropriate electrophysiological model for learning and memory (for general reviews see Swanson et al. (1982), Barnes (1988), Siegelbaum and Kandel (1991), Thompson (1992), and Malenka (1994)). Although the major synaptic pathways in the hippocampus including the perforant mossy fiber, and Schaffer collateral all use excitatory amino acids as neurotransmitters and exhibit LTP, the mechanisms for LTP may be quite different (reviewed in Nicoll and Malenka, 1995). For example, perforant path and Schaffer collateral pathway LTP are both dependent upon activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993), whereas mossy fiber/CA3 LTP is not (Harris and Cotman, 1986; Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). Early phase or D-LTP at the Schaffer collateral/CA1 synapse is independent of transcription, whereas long-lasting LTP (L-LTP) at the same synapse depends upon new transcription.

Memory can also be divided into at least two temporally and mechanistically distinct forms: short-term memory (STM), which lasts no longer than several hours and LTM which lasts days or longer (Barondes and Cohen, 1968; Goelet et al., 1986; Tully et al., 1994). LTM depends upon activation of Ca²⁺ and/or cAMP signaling (Livingston et al., 1984; Yovell et al., 1987; Silva et al., 1992; Wu et al., 1995) as well as de novo gene expression (Flexner and Flexner, 1966; Squire and Barondes, 1973; Crow and Forrester, 1990; Tully et al.,

1994). One of the transcriptional pathways implicated in L-LTP and LTM is the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway. Furthermore, cross-talk between the Ca²⁺, Erk/MAP kinase, and cAMP regulatory pathways seems to play a critical role in regulation of CRE-mediated transcription in neurons as well as for LTM and L-LTP. Transcriptionally-dependent L-LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus is initiated by activation of NMDA receptors and postsynaptic Ca²⁺ increases. This Ca²⁺ increase can activate several signal transduction systems including the cAMP and Erk/MAP kinase cascade (Fig. 1). In brain, the Ca²⁺ and cAMP regulatory systems are coupled through calmodulin (CaM), a Ca²⁺ binding protein that mediates Ca²⁺ stimulation of type 1 or type 8 adenylyl cyclases (AC1 and AC8). It is hypothesized that AC1 and AC8 play a crucial role in LTM because they generate a critical cAMP signal required for Ca²⁺ stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription.

2. Activation of the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway is important for L-LTP and hippocampal-dependent memory

While the role of specific transcriptional pathways in learning and memory has remained elusive, the cAMP/Ca²⁺ response element (CRE) has several interesting characteristics that implicate it in L-LTP and LTM. The CRE can integrate Ca²⁺ and cAMP signals and

the CRE-binding protein (CREB) is hypothesized to be a key regulator of LTM. CREB is essential for long-term facilitation in Aplysia (Dash et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1997), as well as LTM in Drosophila (Yin 705 (1994) 90) and mice (Bourchuladze et al., 1994). In addition, the CRE transcriptional pathway is activated during L-LTP (Impey, 2049 (1996)), a form of transcription-dependent LTP proposed as a model for LTM (Frey et al., 1993; Nguyen and Kandel, 1996).

To determine whether the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway is activated during LTM formation, a CRE-lacZ mouse reporter was used to examine the effects of hippocampus-dependent learning on CRE-mediated gene expression and CREB phosphorylation in the brain (Impey et al., 1998b). Training for contextual conditioning or passive avoidance causes significant increases in CRE-dependent gene expression in areas CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus. Auditory cue fear-conditioning, which is amygdala-dependent, is associated with increased CRE-mediated gene expression in the amygdala, but not the hippocampus. Contextual learning also stimulates the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 in the hippocampus. These data were the first to show that learning and memory, in response to behavioral conditioning, activates the CRE transcriptional pathway in specific areas of brain. This supports the hypothesis that LTM formation requires activation of the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway in a specific and highly localized manner. Presumably, transcriptional activation of a family of genes through the CRE

Mechanism for L-LTP in the hippocampus: It is hypothesized that postsynaptic Ca²⁺ increases generated through NMDA receptors activate several signal transduction pathways including the Erk/MAP kinase and cAMP regulatory pathways. Either AC1 or AC8 can provide the cAMP signal required for L-LTP and LTM. The convergence of these pathways at the level of the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway may increase expression of a family of genes required for L-LTP and LTM.

causes long-term molecular changes at synapses which contribute to L-LTP and LTM.

Activation of the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway also plays an important role for other forms of neuroplasticity. For example, in the visual system, altering the pattern of visually-driven neuronal activity by monocular deprivation induces dramatic cortical synaptic rearrangement during a postnatal development window, the critical period. Monocular deprivation leads to an induction of CRE-mediated transcription in the visual cortex that precedes the onset of physiologic plasticity (Pham et al., 1999). This suggests that the coordinate regulation of a network of genes affected by CRE-signaling may control physiologic, experience-dependent plasticity during postnatal neocortical development. CRE-mediated transcription is also activated during experience-dependent plasticity in the adult mouse neocortex (Barth et al., 2000). Specifically, removal of all but one of the facial whiskers of a mouse causes an increase of the spared whisker's functional representation within the somatosensory cortex. Using the CRE-mouse, it was discovered that there is a robust increase in CRE-mediated transcription in layer IV of the spared whisker's barrel but not at other barrels in the somatosensory cortex.

Another example illustrating the importance of CRE-mediated transcription for adaptive changes in neurons comes from circadian biology. A program of regulated gene expression is a fundamental component of the circadian clock. Although E-Box-dependent transcription is implicated in circadian rhythmicity, the contribution of other enhancer elements is unknown. It was recently discovered that cells of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) exhibit a prominent circadian oscillation in CRE-mediated gene expression (Obrietan et al., 1999). Maximal CRE-mediated transcription occurs from late-subjective night to mid-subjective day. Cycling of CRE-dependent transcription does not occur in other brain regions, including the supraoptic nucleus and piriform cortex. Levels of the phospho-active form the transcription factor CREB (P-CREB) vary as a function of circadian time. Peak P-CREB levels occur during the mid-to-late-subjective night. Furthermore, photic stimulation during the subjective night, but not during the subjective day, triggers a marked increase in CRE-mediated gene expression in the SCN. Activation of the Erk/MAP kinase signaling cascade is required for Ca²⁺-dependent stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription in the SCN and MAPK activity also undergoes a circadian oscillation (Obrietan et al., 1998). These findings indicate that the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway is circadian-regulated within the SCN, and raise the possibility that this pathway provides signaling information essential for normal clock function.

3. Mechanisms for Ca²⁺ stimulation of the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway

How does Ca²⁺ increase activate CRE-mediated transcription in neurons? There are several kinases that can activate CREB by catalyzing its phosphorylation at Ser-133. For example, Ca²⁺-stimulated CRE-mediated transcription could occur via phosphorylation of CREB by one of the Ca²⁺/CaM-dependent kinase (CaMK) (Bitto et al., 1996). Overexpression of CaMK I, II or IV induces CRE-mediated gene expression in cell lines (Matthews 1087 (1994) 24, 60, 61, 63, 71, 72). Although CaMK IV may contribute to early (<2 min) Ca²⁺ stimulation of CREB phosphorylation (Bitto et al., 1996), it is not known if CaMK IV activity is required for prolonged Ca²⁺-stimulated CREB phosphorylation. CaMK IV may also lead to CREB phosphorylation via the activation of downstream kinases. For example, several studies indicate that CaMKs activate MAP kinases (Enslen et al., 1996). Recently, Shieh et al. (1998) implicated CaMK IV in CREB-dependent gene expression in cortical neurons. However, they examined Ca²⁺-stimulated transcription in the context of the BDNF exon III promoter, which requires a cooperative interaction between CREB and other inducible transcription factors (Shieh et al., 1998). Other data indicates that CaM kinases do not play a major role in mediating Ca²⁺ stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription in hippocampal neurons (Impey et al., 1998a). CREB (or ATF1) can be phosphorylated by other Ca²⁺-activated kinases including Rsk's, MAP-KAP kinase 2, p70 S6 kinase, and PKC (de-Groot et al., 1993; Ginty et al., 1994; Brindle et al., 1995; Xie and Rothstein, 1995; Sumov'a and Illnerov'a, 1996; Tan et al., 1996; Iordanov et al., 1997; Xing et al., 1998). It is also clear that other signaling events are necessary because Ca²⁺-stimulated transcription depends on PKA activity in PC12 cells and primary neuron cultures (Ginty et al., 1991; Impey et al., 1994; Thompson et al., 1995).

Since Ca²⁺ activates the Erk/MAP kinase pathway in PC12 cells and neurons (Bading and Greenberg, 1991; Rosen et al., 1994), the role of this kinase cascade in L-LTP and L-LTP-associated CRE-regulated gene expression was evaluated (Impey et al., 1998a). It was discovered that activation of the Erk/MAP kinase cascade is obligatory for Ca²⁺-stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons. The sequential activation of Erk and Rsk2 by Ca²⁺ leads to the phosphorylation and transactivation of CREB. Interestingly, the Ca²⁺-induced translocation of ERK to the nucleus requires activation of PKA. This may explain why PKA activity is obligatory for the induction of CREB-dependent transcription by Ca²⁺ in neuronal cells.

The full expression of L-LTP and L-LTP-associated CRE-mediated gene expression requires the activation of Erk, suggesting that the activation of CREB by Erk plays a critical role in the formation of long-lasting neuronal plasticity. Interestingly, high-frequency stimulation but not low-frequency stimulation markedly increases Erk/MAP kinase activity in CA1 pyramidal cell bodies and dendrites. The MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, blocks tetanus-induced phospho-Erk staining (Impey et al., 1998a). Sweatt's Lab has also reported that MEK inhibitors block L-LTP (English and Sweatt, 1996, 1997). Interestingly, IP administration of a MEK inhibitor, SL327, blocks fear conditioning (Atkins et al., 1998). However, the behavioral experiments are difficult to interpret since the Erk/MAP kinase system regulates cellular functions in many tissues and the SL327 was administered systematically rather than directly into the brain. Collectively, these data indicate that Erk may regulate synaptic efficacy at the post-synaptic membrane and possibly play a role in targeting long-term changes to activated synapses.

fiber and the medial perforant pathways (Frey et al., 1993; Impey et al., 1996; Abel et al., 1997; Nguyen and Kandel, 1996). Since neurons of the hippocampus including CA1-CA3 pyramidal cells and granule cells in the dentate gyrus express Ca²⁺-stimulated adenylyl cyclases (Xia et al., 1991; Cali et al., 1994), increases in Ca²⁺ during LTP may elevate cAMP. Indeed, stimulation of NMDA receptors increases cAMP in area CA1 of the hippocampus (Chetkovich et al., 1991). Furthermore, LTP in the dentate gyrus (Stanton and Sarvey, 1985) and the CA1 (Chetkovich and Sweatt, 1993) both increase cAMP. A role of PKA in LTP and hippocampal-dependent memory is also suggested by recent transgenic mice studies. For example, reduction of PKA activity in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative R subunit, R(AB), causes defects in L-LTP, spatial memory, and long-term contextual fear conditioning (Abel et al., 1997).

5. Ca²⁺-sensitive adenylyl cyclases are critical for mossy fiber/CA3 LTP

In contrast to the NMDA receptor-dependent LTP, which is dependent upon increased postsynaptic Ca²⁺, mossy fiber LTP requires an increase in presynaptic Ca²⁺ (Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990; Johnston et al., 1992). Although most of the evidence suggests that mossy fiber LTP is initiated and maintained presynaptically (Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990; Johnston et al., 1992; Huang et al., 1994a), the molecular mechanism for LTP at the mossy fiber/CA3 pyramidal cell synapse is not known. Evidence from several laboratories suggests that PKA activation is obligatory for the induction and maintenance of mossy fiber LTP (Huang et al., 1994b; Weisskopf et al., 1994). For example, elevation of cAMP with forskolin mimics mossy fiber LTP (Weisskopf et al., 1994) and mutant mice lacking PKA C1β or R1β subunits are defective in mossy fiber LTP (Huang et al., 1995).

Since agonists that stimulate ACs through receptor activation do not mimic mossy fiber LTP, it is hypothesized that this LTP is due to stimulation of an adenylyl cyclase by presynaptic Ca²⁺ increases. Subsequent activation of PKA may stimulate prolonged glutamate release. To test this hypothesis, several forms of hippocampal LTP in wild-type and AC1 mutant mice were examined (Villacres 3208 (1998)). Wild-type and AC1 mutant mice exhibit comparable perforant path LTP recorded in the dentate gyrus as well as decremental LTP at the Schaffer collateral/CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. Although the mutant mice exhibit normal paired pulse facilitation, mossy fiber LTP is significantly impaired in AC1 mutant mice. High concentrations of forskolin induce mossy fiber LTP to comparable levels in wild-type and AC1 mutant mice.

indicating that signaling components downstream from  
the adenylyl cyclase including PKA, ion channels, and  
secretory machinery are not affected by disruption of  
the AC1 gene. These data indicate that coupling of  
Ca²⁺ to activation of AC1 is crucial for mossy fiber  
LTP, most likely through activation of PKA and enhancement of excitatory amino acid secretion. There  
are several possible explanations for the residual mossy  
fiber LTP in AC1 mutant mice. Since AC8 is expressed  
in the hippocampus (Cali et al., 1994; Villacres et al.,  
1995), AC8 may be responsible for this residual LTP.  
Alternatively, the postsynaptic form of LTP described  
by Jaffe and Johnston (1990) may not depend upon  
Ca²⁺-stimulated ACs.

What is the molecular role for AC1 in mossy fiber  
LTP? AC1 has two unique regulatory properties that  
may contribute to synaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber  
synapse. It is stimulated by free Ca²⁺ and synergistically  
stimulated by Ca²⁺ and Gₛ-coupled receptors (Wayman et al., 1994). Consequently, AC1 is poised to  
respond to presynaptic Ca²⁺ increases. It is hypothesized that increases in presynaptic Ca²⁺ stimulate AC1,  
elevate cAMP and activate PKA. The mechanism by which PKA activation causes a persistent increase in  
glutamate release is not known but may be due to direct phosphorylation of one or more proteins in the  
secretory machinery (Trudeau et al., 1996). A likely candidate is Rab3A, a PKA substrate that may contribute to PKA-mediated neurotransmitter release by regulating Ca²⁺-stimulated vesicle release (Geppert et al., 1997). Interestingly, Rab3A mutant mice exhibit normal short-term plasticity but lack mossy fiber LTP (Castillo et al., 1997). Since there are noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the dentate gyrus and to the stratum lucidum of the CA3, where the glutamatergic mossy fibers terminate, modulation of mossy fiber LTP by β-adrenergic input (Huang and Kandel, 1996) may be attributable to synergistic stimulation of AC1 by β-adrenergic receptors and Ca²⁺.

The LTP mechanism described above may not be unique to the mossy fiber/CA3 synapse. AC1 is expressed at relatively high levels in dentate granule cells of the hippocampus as well as cerebellar granule cells (Xia et al., 1991). Cerebellar parallel fibers exhibit an LTP with properties similar to hippocampal mossy fiber LTP (Salin et al., 1996). Cerebellar LTP is independent of NMDA receptors but dependent on extracellular Ca²⁺ and AC activation. Interestingly, AC1 mice show a number of defects in cerebellar physiology including the complete lack of parallel fiber/Purkinje cell LTP in dissociated neuron cultures (Storm et al., 1998). This blockade is not accompanied by alterations in a number of basal electrophysiological parameters and is overcome by application of an exogenous cAMP analog suggesting that it results specifically from deletion of AC1.


6. Calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity is critical for hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and late-phase LTP

Although the relationships between L-LTP and LTM have not been fully defined, both depend on de novo transcription and the cAMP regulatory system, suggesting that there may be a common underlying mechanism. A key unanswered question is the mechanism for generation of cAMP signals required for modulation of synaptic plasticity and memory formation. In principle, inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterases or stimulation of adenylyl cyclases could provide the cAMP increase. Since L-LTP and LTM are initiated by an intracellular Ca²⁺ increase, Ca²⁺-inhibited phosphodiesterases or Ca²⁺-activated adenylyl cyclases are possible candidates for generation of cAMP transients needed for synaptic plasticity. Although there are several mechanisms for Ca²⁺ activation of adenylyl cyclases, the most direct mechanism is through the CaM-activated adenylyl cyclases (Westcott et al., 1979).

To test the hypothesis that CaM-stimulated adenylyl cyclases may be crucial for L-LTP and LTM, transgenic mice lacking AC1, AC8 or both enzymes (DKO) were prepared (Wong et al., 1999). Although the single mutants exhibit L-LTP and normal LTM for contextual and passive avoidance learning, the DKO mice do not. To determine if the defect in passive avoidance LTM is due to a loss of cAMP increases in the hippocampus, the DKO mutant mice were unilaterally cannulated to deliver forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator. Administration of forskolin to area CA1 right before training restores LTM for passive avoidance learning. The defect in L-LTP is also overcome by application of forskolin to hippocampal slices. These data indicate that Ca²⁺-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity is essential for L-LTP as well as some forms of LTM, and that either AC1 or AC8 can produce the critical cAMP signal.


7. Summary

It is hypothesized that Ca²⁺ signals generated through activation of NMDA receptors coactivate the Erk/MAP kinase and cAMP signal transduction pathways. Coincident activation of these two regulatory pathways increases the transcription of a family of genes through the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway. It is hypothesized that Ca²⁺ activation of AC1 or AC8 generates a critical cAMP signal required for Ca²⁺ activation of CREB-mediated transcription. Although cAMP may be required for several events in this complex signal transduction cascade, one of the major roles of cAMP may be to support nuclear translocation of Erk/MAP kinase in hippocampal neurons.
