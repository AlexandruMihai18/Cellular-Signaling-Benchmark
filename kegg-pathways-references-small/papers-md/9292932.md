The bile acids in mammals are all derivatives of 5β-cholan-26-oic acid. They represent the major quantitative pathway by which cholesterol is metabolized in the body. This article covers the microbial and enzymatic transformations of free, saturated bile acids, that kept unaltered the C-24 cyclopentane-perhydrophenanthrene nucleus. The bile acids that have been considered include the primary cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, the secondary deoxycholic and lithocholic acids as well as the relevant dehydrocholic, ursocholic and ursodeoxycholic acids. Among the bile acid biotransformations, attention is paid to reactions that lead to pharmaceutically significant compounds. This is the case of 7α-hydroxy epimerization of chenodeoxycholic acid to ursodeoxycholic acid, currently used for cholesterol gallstone dissolution therapy and in the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. Emphasis has placed on reporting reactions that may be of general interest and on the practical aspects of work in the field of biotransformations.

### Introduction

Bile acids, their conjugates, and their salts are natural products, fundamental constituents of bile. The determining physiological action of bile acids is the emulsification of bile lipids, in particular cholesterol, and of dietary lipids preparatory to digestion and absorption. Besides their importance as end products of cholesterol metabolism, however, bile acids occupy a central position in understanding the role of steroids in biological systems. The primary bile acids in human bile are cholic acid (3α,7α,12α-trihydroxycholanic acid) and chenodeoxycholic acid (3α,7α-dihydroxycholanic acid), mainly present as glycine and taurine conjugates. The bile acid group also includes conjugates of deoxycholic and lithocholic acids, commonly known as secondary bile acids, produced from cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, respectively, by intestinal bacteria C-7 dehydroxylation.¹⁻³

Chenodeoxycholic acid and its 7-hydroxy epimer ursodeoxycholic acid have important pharmaceutical applications related to their ability to solubilize cholesterol gallstones, thus alleviating the need for surgery.⁴ In recent years, however, ursodeoxycholic acid has replaced chenodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases because of its similar efficacy and the complete lack of side effects.⁵ Both chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acids are prepared on a large scale from raw, low-cost materials with a high bile acid content. In particular bovine bile, upon alkaline hydrolysis to release the free bile acids, is the most commonly employed biological material. Its major component is cholic acid, which is subsequently used as the starting reagent for the synthesis of chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acids. Fieser et al.⁶ and, later, Hofmann⁷ reported a five-step chemical procedure for the preparation of chenodeoxycholic acid from cholic acid. On the other hand, ursodeoxycholic acid is industrially prepared by a sequence of chemical reactions, the last two steps of which involve the selective α/β inversion of the 7-hydroxy carbon center.⁸⁻¹⁰ During the last decade, different approaches have been proposed to overcome the well recognized drawbacks of the chemical sequences, i.e., the occurrence of many by-products lowering the yield and the partial stereochemical control of the α/β inversion. In particular, biotransformations have been successfully used to enhance the selectivity and to reduce the number of steps to obtain chenodeoxycholic or ursodeoxycholic acid. Sawada et al.¹¹⁻¹³ described the preparation of chenodeoxycholic acid by bioconversion of dehydrocholic acid in the presence of *Lactobacillus xylosus* or *Brevibacterium fuscum*. More recently, Carrea, Riva, et al.¹⁴,¹⁵ reported the high stereochemical control that has been observed.

tained in the modification of the functional groups of the
steroid skeleton mediated by enzymes. A general summary
of the different sequences is given in Scheme 1.

After the boom of the bile acid research in the 1970s, a
number of books and reviews appeared on the subject,
mainly dealing with the biochemistry, physiology, analy-
sis ${ }^{1,5,16-18}$ and degradation ${ }^{19,20}$ of this class of compounds.
Despite the large number of papers and patents published on
the biotransformations involving bile acids, no recent,
readily accessible and comprehensive reviews have been
published. ${ }^{9,10,21}$ The aim of this article is to summarize the
results obtained in the microbial and enzymatic bioconver-
sions of free saturated bile acids to pharmaceutically signif-
icant compounds, limiting the discussion to those more
abundant in nature, of bovine or swine origin, and to the
transformations that kept unaltered the C-24 cyclopen-
tanephenanthrene nucleus I.

The bile acids (BA) that have been considered are as
follows: cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA),
deoxycholic acid (DCA), dehydrocholic acid (DHCA),
lithocholic acid (LCA), hyocholic acid (HCA), hyodeoxy-
cholic acid (HDCA), ursolic acid (UCA) and ursode-
oxycholic acid (UDCA). Literature references have been
grouped and discussed in the form presented in the text. In
particular, a cross search has been performed on subjects
type of reaction versus the carbon of the steroid skeleton
bearing the reaction for the microbial transformations and
type of enzyme versus the carbon of the steroid skeleton
bearing the reaction for the enzymatic transformations,
over the years 1967–1996. Tables, one at the end of each
section, are presented with the purpose of offering quick
reference to the reader as to emphasize the practical aspects
of work in the field of biotransformations.

### Microbial transformations

#### I. Epimerization

The epimerization of the hydroxy groups at C-3, C-7, and,
less frequently, at C-12 represents one of the most common
patterns to metabolize BA. This reaction is an inversion of
stereochemistry at the specific carbon site, with no change
in the oxidation state, that could occur through two mech-
anisms, associated with the formation of two different inter-
mediates: 1) oxidation, keto-intermediate, reduction; and

**Structure I**

2) dehydration, alkene-intermediate, rehydration or, less
likely, direct epimerization. ${ }^{22-24}$ It is also conceivable that
these two mechanisms might exist within the same bacteria.
Scheme 2 summarizes the pathways for C-3 epimerization
of CDCA. A summary of the epimerization reactions that
have been described may be found in Table 1. Note that the
first pathway of Scheme 2 may take place by the action of
two different organisms or by the action of a single organ-
ism containing both enzymes. ${ }^{25}$

A. C-3. *Clostridium perfringens* isolated from human fe-
ces and obtained from culture collection were screened for
$\beta$ -epimerization at the C-3 position of CDCA, DCA, and
CA (Equation 1). ${ }^{26,27}$ The mechanism of the 3-hydroxy
epimerization of CDCA by *Clostridium perfringens* was
investigated in detail on $3 \alpha, 7 \alpha$-dihydroxy-$[2,2,4,4-{ }^{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}]$-,
$3 \alpha, 7 \alpha$-dihydroxy-$[3 \beta-{ }^{-2} \mathrm{H}]$-, and $3 \beta, 7 \alpha$-dihydroxy-$[3 \alpha$-
${ }^{2} \mathrm{H}] 5 \beta$-cholanoic acid. ${ }^{24}$ The results ruled out the occur-
rence of a dehydration-rehydration mechanism in favor of a
redox process having 3-oxochenodeoxycholic acid as inter-
mediate. An analogous epimerization mechanism via for-
mation of the 3-keto intermediate has been proposed for the
transformation of DCA and CA in the presence of *Eubac-
terium lentum*. ${ }^{28}$ In addition, a marked increase of the
$\beta$-epimer product, from $10 \%$ to $30-50 \%$, has been observed
when *Eubacterium lentum* was cocultured in the presence of
*Clostridium innocuum*. ${ }^{29}$

Microbial transformation of CA, CDCA, UDCA, and the four 3,7-dihydroxy BA isomers (i.e., 3α,7α; 3α7β; 3β,7α; and 3β,7β) by anaerobic mixed cultures of human fecal microorganisms was investigated. A predominance of the α-hydroxy configuration at C-3 was observed.<sup>30-32</sup> A number of mass spectrometric studies have been published, focusing on the identification and analysis of products derived from the epimerization reaction.<sup>33,34</sup> Derivatization and gas-liquid chromatographic details are included.

Biotransformations of bile acids: Bortolini et al.

A. C-3. The 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity on several BA was detected in many strains of Clostridium paraputrificum.⁵⁰ Macdonald et al.⁵¹ identified 7α,12α-dihydroxy-3-oxo-cholanoic acid as the major biotransformation product of CA in the presence of Clostridium perfringens. The concurrent oxidation at C-3 and C-12 was found during fermentation of DCA with a strain of Arthrobacter simplex,⁵² whereas the same bacterial strain showed no activity on LCA. Patents are given.⁵³⁻⁵⁵

B. C-7. 7α-Dehydrogenating activity was found in strains of Eubacterium lentum. The oxidation of BA was considerably suppressed in the presence of O₂.²⁸ Dehydrogenation of the 7α-hydroxy group of CA and CDCA were observed in mixed microbial cultures from human feces as in isolated bacterial strains.³⁰

7-Oxolithocholic acid was produced from CDCA by human intestinal flora.³² A mixed culture of Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides uniformis was found to oxidize CA to the corresponding, 7-oxo derivative.⁴⁴ Lecithinase-lipase-negative Clostridia were able to transform CA³⁸ and CDCA in the corresponding 7-keto derivatives.²²,³⁸

The oxidoreductase activity of Peptostreptococcus productus was established during the conversion of CA and CDCA.⁴⁶ Kole et al.⁴⁰ observed that in experiments conducted with immobilized cells of Clostridium absonum, if bacteria were grown in the absence of CDCA, cells converted this substrate to the 3α-hydroxy-7-keto product. Clostridium absonum metabolized primary BA to 7-oxo derivatives.⁴² At relatively high redox potential (Eh) values of about −100 mV, the 7-oxo BA tend to predominate (yield 75%) over the 7β-hydroxy BA.

The 7α-dehydrogenating activity of Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli on CDCA has been documented.⁴³ Furthermore, a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium capable of dehydrogenating the 7β-hydroxy group of UDCA was recovered from human feces.⁴⁵ The formation of the 7-keto BA as well as the 7β-hydroxy derivatives are the major products of reaction of CDCA and CA in the presence of Clostridium absonum added to Eubacterium.⁴¹

Data on the transformation of CDCA by saccharolytic Bacteroides species were presented.⁵⁶ The majority of the strains, active when cultured anaerobically, belong to the species Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaiomicron. Suspensions of washed resting-stage cells of Clostridium bifermentans were incubated with CA under a variety of conditions in an attempt to manipulate the competing 7α-dehydroxylation and 7α-dehydrogenation reactions.⁵⁷ In the presence of EDTA, near quantitative 7α-dehydrogenation was achieved with no associated dehydroxylation. The presence of air enhanced oxidation, possibly through an effect on the redox potential of the medium. A Gram-positive anaerobe (strain F6) was isolated from soil and identified as Clostridium bifermentans.⁵⁸ Strains F6 formed 7-ketolithocholic acid from CDCA and 7-ketodeoxycholic acid from CA in whole cell cultures but did not transform UDCA or UCA. Two convenient nonchromatographic methods for the estimation of BA bioconversion at the 7α-OH position have been described.⁵⁹ The references of the patents are given.⁶⁰,⁶¹

II. Oxidation

This reaction and the strictly related reduction (Section IV) are characterized by a change in the oxidation state and usually proceed via a formal expulsion or insertion of H₂, i.e., the dehydration-rehydration mechanism (Scheme 3).

III. Hydroxylation

Hydroxylation and the related dehydroxylation (Section V) formally occur through a replacement of a hydrogen with a hydroxy group, or vice versa, and are characterized by a change in the reagent-product oxidation state as shown in Scheme 4 for the transformation of LCA to UDCA.

C. C-15. A fungus identified as Cunninghamella blakesle- eana ST-22 was reported to perform 15β-hydroxylation of LCA to the new bile acid 3α,15β-dihydroxy-5β-cholanolic acid<sup>83</sup> (Equation 4). The effects of temperature, pH, and organic solvents are discussed. In brief, the optimum pH for cell growth and reaction was found to be 8.0, and a temperature of 33°C seemed best for both processes. The enhancing product formation by organic solvents was observed as well. With 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, dimethyl formamide, and dioxane, 200%, 172%, 168%, and 114% of 15β-hydroxylating activity was measured, respectively. The same transformation is carried out more efficiently if the spores of Cunninghamella blakesleeana are immobilized on k-carragenan.<sup>84</sup> New trihydroxy BA have been produced by Cunninghamella blakesleeana, all possessing an OH-function in C-15, as suggested by two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H-NMR experiments.<sup>85</sup> The same technique was used to identify the products of 15β-hydroxylation of LCA by Cunninghamella spp.<sup>86</sup>

The products of incubation of LCA and CA with Absidia coerulea, Rhizoctonia solani, and Penicillium were analyzed and partially characterized.<sup>74</sup> The former acid was extensively hydroxylated at C-15, as well as at other carbons of the steroidal skeleton. The reference of the patent that has appeared on this specific transformation is given.<sup>87</sup>

IV. Reduction

Sawada et al. isolated two kinds of bacteria from soil, identified as Brevibacterium fuscum and Lactobacillus xylosus.<sup>11–13</sup> DHCA was converted to 12-ketocheno- deoxycholic acid, via the intermediate 7,12-diketolitho- cholic acid, by both strains (Equation 5). This product was obtained in a yield of 50%. The bioconversion in the presence of Lactobacillus xylosus has been optimized to a 55% yield in a two-stage continuous fermentor by adjusting the pH and dilution rate.<sup>12,13</sup>

Edenharder et al.<sup>22</sup> demonstrated that 3α-hydroxy-7- keto-5β-cholanolic acid is reduced by lecithinase-lipase- negative Clostridia to CDCA and UDCA, the latter being the preferred conversion product of most strains. The same authors<sup>50</sup> found that 13 strains of Clostridium paraputrificum reduced the 12-keto function of 3,12-diketo5β- cholanate stereospecifically to the 12β-hydroxy function, whereas the 3-keto group was reduced to the 3α- and 3β- hydroxy group. The reduction of 3-oxo-chenodeoxycholic acid to 3β-chenodeoxycholic acid by Clostridium innocuum was observed at a yield higher than 80%.<sup>29</sup> The same substrate was reduced to a mixture of 3α- and 3β-hydroxy

derivatives in a 4:1 ratio in the presence of *Clostridium perfringens*.²⁴

*Eubacterium aerofaciens*, isolated from normal human feces (isolate G20-7), is able to reduce 3α-hydroxy-7-keto- cholic acid to UDCA.⁴³ 3-Keto BA were concomitantly reduced to α- and β-hydroxy groups in the presence of *Eubacterium lentum*.²⁸ The reference of the pertinent patent is given.⁸⁸

### V. Dehydroxylation

The 7α-dehydroxylation of the primary bile acids CA and CDCA to the secondary bile acids DCA and LCA, respectively, is considered the most important biotransformation of this class of compounds. This approach has been recently discussed.³ A summary of the dehydroxylations reported in this section is given in Table 4.

#### A. C-7.
Archer et al.⁸⁹ investigated the variables important in the 7α-dehydroxylation of CA to DCA by *Clostridium bifermentans*. Under pH-controlled anaerobic fermentation, high yields of DCA are obtained in the presence of 10% CO₂ and near pH 7.

The addition of CA or CDCA to growing cultures of *Eubacterium* species V.P.I. 12708 caused 25- and 46-fold increases in the 7α-dehydroxylation activity.⁹⁰ The individual BA conversion rates using [¹⁴C]CA and [¹⁴C]CDCA as substrates increased at a similar rate. The induction of the dehydroxylation activity was highly specific, requiring a free C-24 carboxyl group and an unhindered 7α-hydroxy function on the B ring of the steroid nucleus.

Pure cultures of intestinal bacteria were isolated from human intestinal flora and screened for their ability to remove the 7-OH group from free CA. It has been reported that only a few strains could dehydroxylate CA at the C-7 position.⁹¹ In particular, this activity was observed in *Bacteroides*, *Veillonella*, *Clostridium*, and in many strains of *Streptococcus faecalis* and *Staphylococcus* but not in *Bi-*

The mixture reduced CA to DCA, which was further metabolized.⁹³ The same authors⁹⁴ isolated a strain of *Clostridium bifermentans* from mixed fecal culture which was able to convert 7β-[³H]CA to 7β-[³H]DCA (Equation 6). C-7 dehydroxylation of CA was reported in the presence of *Bacteroides* spp.²⁹

### Enzyme transformations

As pointed out by Davies, Green, Kelly, and Roberts in their book⁹⁸ on biotransformations in preparative organic chemistry, there are some advantages and disadvantages in the use of whole-cell (microbial) systems over enzymes for a biotransformation. Isolated enzymes are specific for selected reactions, and require simple apparatus and an easier work-up. On the other hand, enzymes are expensive and usually require the presence of a cofactor. The use of isolated enzymes has the distinct advantage that the selected enzyme will catalyze *only* that particular transformation, and unwanted side reactions are rarely observed. In addition, enzymes may carry out a given transformation (say A ⇔ B) in both directions, direct and reverse, depending on the experimental conditions adopted, whereas whole-cell systems usually catalyze only one of the two possible reactions.

In this section the transformations mediated by purified and nonpurified enzymes from bacterial and animal tissues are described. A summary of these reactions is given in Table 5.

### VI. Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase

#### A. C-3.
Enzymatic α/β inversion of the C-3 hydroxyl groups of different BA has been obtained in two steps through the sequential and combined use of commercially available 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.⁹⁹ Ox-

idation or reduction of the same substrates is obtained as well. ${}^{100-102}$ As an example, DHCA may be quantitatively and selectively reduced to 12-ketochenodeoxycholic acid ${}^{101}$ or to 12-ketoursodeoxycholic acid. ${}^{102}$ The enzyme collection was used in the free form, immobilized on Eupergit C or on Sepharose CL-4B, and the reactions were carried out in a membrane reactor or in a two-phase system.

The regio- and stereo-specific synthesis of $[3\alpha-{ }^{2} \mathrm{H}]$-3$\beta$-hydroxy-7,12-dioxo-5$\beta$-cholan-24-oic acid has been carried out on a preparative scale by coupling the reduction of DHCA by the specific hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to the oxidation of $[1-{ }^{2} \mathrm{H}]$glucose, catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase. ${}^{103}$

The formation of LCA and isolithocholic acid from 3-oxo-5$\beta$-cholanoic acid by human liver cytosol was examined in vitro. ${}^{104}$ Liver cytosol was incubated at various pH levels with the substrate, in a phosphate buffer containing NADPH or NADH. The production of LCA was observed at

pH $\geq 7$, whereas isolithocholic acid was the preferred product at pH $\leq 6$ and with NADPH as the coenzyme. Only the iso derivative was observed, from 3-oxo-5$\beta$-cholanoic acid, with NADH as the cofactor. A monomeric 3$\alpha$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with a molecular weight of 34,000 was purified from mouse liver cytosol. The enzyme catalyzed the reversible oxidation of the 3$\alpha$-hydroxy groups of $\mathrm{C}_{24}$-steroids. ${}^{105}$ Alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes SS and ES of horse, rat, and human liver catalyzed the NAD-dependent oxidation of the 3$\beta$-hydroxy groups in 5$\alpha$- and 5$\beta$-steroids of the $\mathrm{C}_{24}$ series. ${}^{106}$

Homogeneous indanol dehydrogenase from monkey liver catalyzed the reversible conversion of the 3$\alpha$- (and 20$\alpha$-) hydroxy groups of several BA. ${}^{107}$ The results suggest that indanol dehydrogenase acts as a 3(20)$\alpha$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the metabolism of certain BA.

Review

trioxo-5β-cholanic acids were incubated with human red blood cells and biotransformed to 3β,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid, for the former, and to 3α-hydroxylated dioxo BA together with 3β-hydroxylated 7,12-dioxo-5β-cholanic acid, for the latter.

A human fecal isolate, characterized by morphological, physiological, and biochemical data as a strain of *Pep\-tostreptococcus productus*, contained NAD-dependent 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases.¹⁰⁹ Optimum pH conditions were 8.5 and 9.5, respectively. The activities, measured on BA, were significantly reduced when bacteria were grown in the presence of 3-keto BA, while other BA were ineffective.

*Ruminococcus* sp. PO1-3 from human intestinal flora reduced DHCA to 3β-hydroxy-7,12-dioxo-5β-cholanic acid, by means of the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.¹¹⁰ This bacterium and its crude extract gave rise to an additional product, identified as 3β,7β-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5β-cholanic acid. Therefore, besides 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was shown to be present in this bacterium.

The partial purification and characterization of a NAD-dependent 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from *Clostridium innocuum* has been reported.¹¹¹ A pH optimum of 10.0–10.2 was found after partial purification by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. 3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was also found in the membrane fraction after solubilization with Triton X-100, suggesting that the enzyme was originally membrane bound. The enzyme was found to be partially heat labile (86% inactivation at 50°C for 10 min.).

Thirty-two strains of *Eubacterium lentum* and phenotypically similar anaerobic Gram-positive bacilli were screened for intracellular bile salt 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity.¹¹² These organisms were divided into four groups, and the specific C-3 activity was showed by group C (2 strains) and group B (13 strains) associated with 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Cell-free preparations of *Clostridium perfringens* in the presence of NADP and CDCA produced both 3-oxo and 3β-hydroxy products, but only the 3-oxo derivative with CA as substrate.²⁷ These activities were noninducible. The reference of the patent is given.¹¹³

B. C-7. Enzymatic α/β inversion of the C-7 hydroxy group of several BA derivatives has been described.¹⁴ The inversion was obtained in two steps through the sequential use of the enzymes 7α- and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, from *Escherichia coli* and *Clostridium absonum*, in a similar fashion to what was discussed for the C-3 position.

Three approaches to the synthesis of UDCA from CA were investigated.¹¹⁴ The first two were based on the use of cell-free systems and consisted of 1) enzymatic oxidation of CA to the 12-keto derivative, C-7 α to β isomerization of the 12-keto compound with *Clostridium absonum* 7α- and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and chemical reduction (Wolff-Kishner) to UDCA; and 2) isomerization of CA to UCA by *Clostridium absonum* 7α- and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, enzymatic oxidation of UCA to the corresponding 12-keto product, followed by chemical reduction to UDCA.

Both 7α- and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases were separated from cultures of *Clostridium absonum* ATCC.¹¹⁵ 7β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, purified 35-fold from CDCA-induced cultures, was shown to catalyze the epimerization of CDCA to UDCA.

A NAD-dependent 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was purified 18-fold over *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron* extracts.¹¹⁶ Substrate saturation kinetics were performed for 3α,7α-dihydroxy BA. The formation of CDCA and UDCA from 7-ketolithocholic acid by human liver preparations was examined in vitro.¹¹⁷ Liver preparations were incubated with 7-ketolithocholic acid at pH 5.5 in a Na-K-phosphate buffer containing NADPH or NADH.

The conversion of 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-[7β-³H]cholestanoic acid into CA and 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-[7β-³H]cholestanoic acid into CDCA has been studied in subcellular fractions of human¹¹⁸ and rat¹¹⁹ liver.

Hylemon et al.¹²⁰ reported the purification (>1200-fold) to apparent homogeneity of 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, from intestinal anaerobic bacterium. This enzyme, highly NADP-dependent, was specific for the oxidation of an unhindered 7α-hydroxy group of BA. The purified 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase obeyed a Michaelis–Menten kinetics. NADP-dependent 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was purified 11.5-fold over the activity in crude cell extracts prepared from *Peptostreptococcus productus* strain b-52.¹²¹ 7β-Dehydrogenation was the sole transformation of BA catalyzed by the partially purified enzyme. the same *Peptostreptococcus productus* strain b-52 and *Eubacterium aerofaciens* ATCC 25986 were found to contain NADP-dependent 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity.¹²² Kinetic studies revealed that both enzyme preparations oxidized the 7β-OH group in unconjugated and conjugated BA. No measurable activity against 7α-hydroxy groups, or 3α- and 12α-hydroxy groups, was detected in either enzyme preparation. The enzyme strain b-52 was found to be sensitive to heat and sulfhydryl inhibitors.

7α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was examined in crude preparations of one strain of *Escherichia coli* B.¹²³ Measurement of activity as a function of pH revealed a broad, flat optimal activity range between 9.0 and 10.0 for oxidation of cholate and glycocholate. The presence of a single enzymatic entity for the oxidation of both conjugated and free 7α-hydroxy substrates has been suggested. Extraction of enzyme from noninduced cells by sonication was shown to be more effective than grinding with alumina or silica.

Eight strains of nonfermentative clostridia have been characterized. In particular, cultures of *Clostridium sporosphaeroides* contained low amounts of 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and all the strains of *Clostridium SPH-1* contained both 7α- and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in a ratio of 1:10.¹²⁴

NADP-dependent 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, reacting specifically with 7β-hydroxy groups, was demonstrated in cell-free preparations of isolate G20-7.⁴³ Production of the enzyme was optimal at between 12 and 18 h of growth. The enzyme, when measured in the oxidative direction, was active with UDCA and UCA. The optimum pH range was 9.8–10.2.

Ruminococcus sp. PO1-3 from human intestinal flora

was demonstrated to possess 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.¹¹⁰ The crude extract reduced 7-ketolithocholic acid and its methyl ester in the presence of NADPH and oxidized UDCA and β-muricholic acid III in the presence of NADP⁺.

Convenient nonchromatographic methods to estimate the bioconversion of the BA at the 7α-hydroxy position have been proposed. The methods were based on the use of a cell-free preparation of 7α-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase from *Escherichia coli* to directly quantify the 7α-hydroxy groups.⁵⁹

C. C-12. 12-Ketochenodeoxycholic acid was prepared by oxidation of CA with NADP in the presence of 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, extracted from *Clostridium* group P, and the regeneration of NADP⁺ was obtained through the glutamate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reduction of α-ketoglutarate.¹²⁵,¹²⁶ The latter enzyme was extracted from *Proteus* species. Both enzymes were immobilized on Sepharose CL-4B activated with tresyl chloride. High concentrations of CA (up to 4% w/v) were completely and specifically transformed into the 12-keto compounds, using amounts of cofactor about 1600 times lower on a molar basis.

NADP(H)-dependent 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from *Clostridium* group P (strain C 48-50) was investigated.¹²⁷ Steady-state kinetic analysis for both reaction directions indicated NADP(H) binding first to the enzyme. The *K*ₘ constants that have been measured are as follows: CA, 72 μM; DCA, 45 μM; and 12-oxochenodeoxycholic acid, 12 μM. CA and UCA were oxidized to the corresponding 12-keto compounds by *Clostridium* group P 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.¹¹⁴

Strains of *Clostridium* group P were reported to contain 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and strains of *Clostridium* SPH-1, to contain the same activity associated with 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, although to a lesser extent.¹²⁴ CA was completely and selectively transformed into 12-ketoursodeoxycholic acid by means of two consecutive enzymatic steps catalyzed first by commercial 7α- and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and second by 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.¹²⁸

VII. Hydroxy- and dehydroxylation

The hydroxylation of LCA by adult male Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes, supplemented with NADPH, was studied.¹²⁹ Four different hydroxylation reactions are observed with this substrate, namely the predominant 6β- as well as the minor 6α-, 7α-, and 7β-hydroxylations. In addition, an unidentified trihydroxylic BA has been detected.

Hydroxylation and sulfation of BA were observed in rat hepatoma cultures, under the influence of a glucocorticoid.¹³⁰ CDCA was 6β-hydroxylated, whereas DCA was hydroxylated at 6β and 7α, as well as converted to its 3-sulfate. Similarly, hydroxylation and sulfation of BA were reported by Princen et al.¹³¹ in monolayers of rat hepatocytes. LCA and CDCA were metabolized to β-muricholic acid (3α,6β,7β-trihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid; 56–76%). The in vivo and in vitro conversion of CDCA in the eel was investigated.¹³² 12α-Hydroxylation of this ³H-substrate afforded [³H]CA.

The 7α-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid IV and the 6β-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid V and LCA have been studied.¹³³,¹³⁴ Bjorkhem et al.¹³³ used a reconstructed system from rat liver microsomes consisting of partially purified cytochrome P450, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, a synthetic phosphatidylcholine, and an NADH- or NADPH-generating system. 7α-Hydroxylase activity was observed with cytochrome P450 from either male or female rats, whereas 6β-hydroxylase activity is found only in the presence of cytochrome P450 male rats. On the other hand, Danielsson et al.¹³⁴ reported the occurrence of both hydroxylations by isolated rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH.

6β-Hydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic-24-¹⁴C acid and taurochenodeoxycholic-24-¹⁴C acid was demonstrated in vitro by cell-free preparations of rat liver.¹³⁵ The enzymatic activity, requiring O₂ and NADPH, was located in the microsomes prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and could be stimulated by addition of the 105.000-g supernatant fluid.

Human liver microsomes, isolated from surgical biopsy specimens, hydroxylated taurolithocholic acid at the 6α position.¹³⁶

The characteristics of 7α-dehydroxylase, a BA-transforming enzyme, were determined using dialyzed cell extracts of *Eubacterium* sp. V.P.I. 12708.¹³⁷ NAD was the only cofactor that consistently stimulated 7α-dehydroxylase, with an activity increase of 4- to 6-fold with either CA or CDCA. The reference is given.⁹⁵

Review

## Conclusions

Among the BA transformations performed by microorganisms (i.e., epimerization, oxidation, reduction, hydroxylation, and dehydroxylation), epimerization of hydroxy functions has received much interest related to the production of 3β- and especially 7β-hydroxy BA. While 12α/β-hydroxy epimerization is a rare event, resulting in a lack of literature on the reaction, 7α-hydroxy epimerization of CDCA, for example, is a key step in the production of UDCA, currently in use for cholesterol gallstone dissolution therapy. Interconversion of these BA via C-7 epimerization is performed by mixed fecal flora, pure cultures of *Clostridia*, and cultures of two microorganisms. Furthermore, an additional number of anaerobes contribute to this reaction. *Clostridial* spp. were shown to elaborate 7α- and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase systems, enabling epimerization via the keto intermediate (*intraspecies epimerization*). Incorporation of 7α- with 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase bacteria is the mechanistic approach in the other case (*interspecies epimerization*). The same principles are valid for the epimerization at C-3, where bacteria possessing *intraspecies epimerization* ability are rare. Worthy of note is that anaerobic bacteria performed most of the mentioned biotransformations with few exceptions (hydroxylation) and that the α-C elaborating ability largely overtakes the β-C one.

Advantages and disadvantages in the use of enzymes over whole-cell systems are well established. The following points deserve comment. The sources of the isolated enzymes do not always correspond to the microorganism carrying out the same or similar transformation. Once again, reactions at C-12 have been scarcely investigated, compared to those at C-3 and C-7. With few exceptions, the cost of the enzymes prevented their extensive use as catalysts for the production of pharmaceutically significant derivatives, as proved also by the low number of patents for this approach. Surprisingly, no reports could be found on biotransformations of HCA and HDCA, the major components of swine bile.
