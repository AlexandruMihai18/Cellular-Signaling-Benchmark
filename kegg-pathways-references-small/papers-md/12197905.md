**ABSTRACT**

Five years after publication of the complete genome sequence of *Helicobacter pyl
In contrast to a previous study, gamma-Glutamyltransferase was not necessary for colonization of mice and piglets [4]. The pivotal role of urease for colonization was confirmed by in vivo complementation experiments [5].

Several studies shed further light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of VacA action and on VacA mediated cellular damage to extrapolate its functional and pathological role in vivo

the G₁ phase, and cyclin D1 overexpression shortens the G₁ phase and increases the rate of cellular proliferation. The c-fos promoter is regulated in *H. pylori* infected cells via a serum response element [26]. Activation of Cyclin D1 and c-Fos involves mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (
with an odds ratio of 7.4. This finding is of particular importance in light of the recent prospective study by Uemura et al. who found increased gastric cancer risk in *H. pylori* infected patients with atrophic gastritis (odds ratio 4.9) [40]. A new aspect of Lewis regulation is brought up by Moran et al., who were able to identify pH as an

In another gerbil model, serum gastrin levels increased after infection with *H. pylori* while gastric acid output decreased, and both parameters normalized after blocking IL-1β action by rhIL-1ra, supporting the central role of IL-1β in *H. pylori*-induced hypochlorhydria [55]. Finally, gastrin
