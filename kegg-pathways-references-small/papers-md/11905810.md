## KNOCKOUT MICE: A PARADIGM SHIFT IN MODERN IMMUNOLOGY

**Tak W. Mak**, **Josef M. Penninger**, and **Pamela S. Ohashi**

In the past decade, advances in genetic engineering and mouse knockout technology have transformed our understanding of the immune system. In particular, new perspectives on T-cell development, co-stimulation and activation have emerged from the study of single and multiple gene-knockout animals, as well as from conditional knockout and ‘knock-in’ mutants. Analysis of these animals has clarified important intracellular signalling pathways and has shed light on the regulatory mechanisms that govern normal immune responses and autoimmunity.

### HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION

Recombination of an engineered version of a gene into its normal locus in a genome, as opposed to random integration. The use of ‘arms’ of DNA that are homologous to regions surrounding the gene of interest, facilitates the preferential insertion of genetically manipulated targeting vectors into the desired locus.

“It is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail” said Abraham H. Maslow<sup>1</sup>. To dissect the intricacies of the physiology and pathophysiology of the human immune system, immunologists have historically reached out to other disciplines. They have readily embraced the technologies of biochemistry, cell biology and animal modelling that are designed to explore complex biological systems. In particular, immunologists have a keen appreciation for the power of genetics, and have used numerous mutant animals in their quest for knowledge. Until about a decade ago, the number of relevant mouse mutants available for such studies was limited. Strains of mice that bear spontaneous mutations existed, but the specific genetic defects, in most cases, were not known. For example, early work on the naturally occurring *nude*, *scid*, *lpr*, *gld*, *motheaten*, *beige* and *aly* mutant strains has taught us valuable lessons about the development of the immune system, but the precise mutations in these animals have only recently been described.

Kaufman (reviewed in REF.2), that ES cells could be successfully isolated from mouse embryos, manipulated in culture and reintroduced back into a wild-type recipient embryo. A chimeric animal was created in which the germ cells were sometimes derived from the donor ES cells, allowing the theoretical transmission of an engineered mutation to progeny. In 1987, engineered mutations were successfully introduced into the *Hprt* (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) gene in ES cells by both the Capecchi and Smithies laboratories. The incorporation of positive and negative selection markers improved the identification and isolation of targeted cells, and the first knockout animals were generated in 1989 by Thompson and colleagues (reviewed in REF.2). These genetically manipulated mice revolutionized our study of mammalian physiology, and immunologists were among the first to take advantage of the new approach.

### Use of gene knockouts in immunology

The first problem in immunology addressed by the generation of a knockout mouse was the function of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in lymphocytes. Biologists had ascribed several functions to MHC molecules in addition to their role of presenting antigens to T cells. One hypothesis held that MHC class I genes were required for T-cell development. In 1990, the laboratories of Smithies<sup>3</sup> and Jaenisch<sup>4</sup> independently generated mice in which the *β2-microglobulin* gene was disrupted, abolishing MHC class I molecule expression.

mutation database, Harvard mouse knockout database and Bioscience mouse knockout database).

Immunologists have had good reasons to adopt KNOCKOUT TECHNOLOGY with greater enthusiasm than their counterparts in other disciplines. It was believed early on that many immunologically related genes were dispensable for embryonic development. So, it was expected that viable animals could be generated whose mutations would be confined to the immune system. Further impetus for the use of knockout technology for immunological studies came with the development of the recombinase-activating gene (RAG) complementation system by Alt's group in 1993 (REF.8) (FIG.2). In RAG chimeric animals, only the lymphocytes are genetically manipulated. This ingenious approach not only circumvents the embryonic lethality of a vital gene under study, but also allows investigators to 'fast-track' the creation of mice with lymphocyte-specific defects. Two breeding steps that are required to generate mice homozygous for the deleted gene can be avoided. Therefore, the RAG complementation system can reduce the time required to produce a knockout mouse bearing a lymphocyte-specific mutation by as much as 6 months. However, it should be noted that this approach works only if reconstitution is optimal, and only if the mutations created do not affect the survival of ES cells or haematopoietic progenitors. Moreover, because RAG-deficient mice still contain early T-cell progenitor (CD25+CD44-) (DN3) cells, the study of early thymocyte development requires the generation of congenic chimaeras.

Contrary to expectations, it soon became apparent that many immunologically related genes do in fact have profound effects on embryonic development, and that the mutation of such genes can lead to embryonic lethality. Immunologists were among the first researchers to counter this problem by adapting existing knockout techniques to generate conditional mutants bearing either tissue-specific or inducible mutations. Conditional knockout mice permit the functional analysis of genes that are lethal if knocked out during embryonic development. Such mice also allow gene function to be studied at different stages of development, and are important for the formulation of models of somatically acquired diseases such as cancer. In 1994, in collaboration with the Marth laboratory, Gu et al.9 of Rajewsky's group generated the first tissue-specific T-cell knockout mice. The DNA polymerase-β gene was selectively deleted in mouse T cells using the bacteriophage-derived, site-specific recombinase Cre9. Cre recombines two loxP sites positioned *in cis*, deleting all DNA between them. Transgenic mice that bear the DNA polymerase-β gene flanked by two loxP sites were crossed with transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase under control of the p56*ck* promoter. In the progeny, Cre was expressed and the polymerase was deleted only in T cells. This approach avoided embryonic lethality, and allowed the examination of the impact of this mutation on T cells (FIG.3). In our laboratory, tissue-specific knockouts have helped define the *in vivo* roles of several genes that have turned out to be essential for embryonic development in the mouse. For example, the

KNOCKOUT TECHNOLOGY
This technology allows for the deletion of a gene, or its function, by gene targeting. A targeting vector in which the gene of interest has been disrupted is introduced into the genome of a mouse embryonic stem cell by homologous recombination.

Another technological development that has helped to advance the targeting field is the KNOCKING-IN of defined mutations into a specific locus. This technique has the advantage of preserving the natural transcriptional control of the gene of interest, while showing its true function, therefore overcoming the potential disadvantages of transgenics in which integration is random. For example, in 1999, Paul and co-workers<sup>15</sup> knocked in a reporter gene into the IL4 (interleukin-4) locus to investigate control of IL-4 expression in an *in vivo* model. This elegant work indicated that, although either allele of the IL4 gene is randomly transcribed in recently primed T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) cells, long-term T<sub>H</sub>2 clones show distinct and heritable ratios of allele expression<sup>16</sup>. The knocking-in of mutations into coding sequences of immune system-related genes has also been achieved. In 1998, Litzenburger and colleagues<sup>17</sup> generated mice in which the germ-line immunoglobulin junctional region of the heavy-chain locus was replaced with the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene of a pathogenic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific monoclonal antibody. The presence of the knock-in transgene both accelerated and exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalitis, irrespective of the identity of the initial autoimmune insult. More recently, Weiss and colleagues<sup>18</sup> used knock-in technology to examine the importance of dimerization for the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase CD45, a key signalling enzyme expressed by most haematopoietic cells. A single point mutation knocked into the dimerization domain of CD45 led to the surprising development of a lymphoproliferative disorder and autoimmunity in the mutant mice<sup>18</sup>.

It is tempting to think of gene-targeting technology as a panacea for all our difficulties in determining gene function, but some caveats must be considered when assessing the phenotypes of genetically engineered mice. First, many genes belong to families of related molecules. It is often difficult to define the precise function of a gene due to redundancy or a partial overlap in function with other family members. Double and triple knockouts must then be created to determine the precise role of a specific molecule. Second, the generation of knockouts of the same gene by different laboratories using different strategies can result in different phenotypes. Some of these differences can be attributed to products of aberrant splicing or truncated translation of the mutated locus. Unanticipated alternative splicing of exons in a gene can also lead to misinterpretation if the resulting messenger RNA is expressed. Third, even when the same targeting strategy is used by different groups, differences in the genetic backgrounds of the strains of mice used can result in discrepancies in phenotypes. The establishment of truly inbred backgrounds is particularly crucial for the assessment of the effect of a mutation on the immune responses of mutant mice. Fourth, an engineered mutation in one gene might affect the expression of an unrelated neighbouring gene, giving rise to phenotypes that are in fact unconnected to the gene of interest. Fifth, subtle effects of animal colony

Figure 2 | RAG-deficient blastocyst complementation. Implantation of blastocysts from RAG-deficient mice into pseudo-pregnant mothers results in the development of viable mice that lack mature B and T cells. However, if normal embryonic stem (ES) cells are injected into RAG-deficient blastocysts, somatic chimaeras are formed, which develop mature B and T cells. Because of the RAG defect, these lymphocytes are necessarily derived only from the injected wild-type ES cells. Similarly, ES cells that are homozygous for a gene deletion can be injected into RAG-deficient blastocysts such that the role of the gene of interest in lymphocyte development can be studied. Because the gene deletion in this system is somatic, RAG-deficient blastocyst complementation is particularly useful for examining the function in lymphocyte development of genes that are embryonic lethal when deleted in the germ line.

tumour-suppressor genes Brca1 (breast cancer susceptibility) and Pten (phosphatase and tensin homologue) are both required for embryonic development, but the use of tissue-specific mutants has allowed us to show that Brca1 is also involved in T-cell proliferation and p53-dependent apoptosis<sup>10</sup>, whereas Pten is required for T-cell homeostasis<sup>11</sup>. Similar findings have been described for mice heterozygous for the Pten gene<sup>12</sup>.

Inducible knockout mice were also developed first in the Rajewsky laboratory. In 1995, these workers devised a construct in which the expression of Cre recombinase was controlled by an interferon-responsive promoter and so could be induced by administration of this cytokine<sup>13</sup>. Because the gene of interest is not deleted until interferon is administered, this approach allows the removal of a gene after the immune system has been established. Using this system, Rajewsky and colleagues<sup>13</sup> showed that interferon-induced deletion of a gene was extensive in liver but more limited in lymphocytes, and other cell types and tissues. This methodology was also recently used to show that the persistence of mature B cells in the periphery depends on expression of the B-cell receptor<sup>14</sup>.

KNOCK-IN MUTATION  
Introduction of a transgene into a precise location in the genome, rather than random integration. Knocking-in uses the same technique of homologous recombination as a knockout strategy, but the targeting vector is designed to preserve or enhance the function and control of the gene of interest, rather than disrupt it.

the functions of transcription factors and the transduction of intracellular signalling. Here, we will attempt to highlight only a few examples and will bias our description towards in vivo models of genes related to T-cell function, especially those of T-cell development, activation and co-stimulation. Space limitations have also forced us to abridge our reference list, and we regret that we must omit mention of many excellent studies. For some outstanding recent reviews on immunological knockouts outside the scope of this review, we refer the reader to REFS 24–33.

**T-cell development.** Genetic models have been particularly helpful in advancing our understanding of the thymic microenvironment and of αβ and γδ T-cell differentiation. One of the key findings to come out of these gene-targeting studies was that thymocytes mature through multiple genetic checkpoints (FIG. 4). For example, the gene that encodes the T-cell-specific Src-family kinase p56<sup>lck</sup> was knocked out in 1992. These mutant mice showed a profound block in thymocyte development at the double-negative (DN; CD4-CD8-) stage<sup>34</sup>. This was surprising at the time because the TCR was not known to be expressed at this early stage. Subsequent studies showed that the TCRβ chain<sup>35</sup> and RAG1/RAG2 (REFS 36,37) were also required for T-cell development beyond the DN stage. It was later shown that pro-thymocytes express a pre-TCR, and that expression of this molecule is the first important checkpoint controlling further T-cell maturation<sup>38</sup>.

Stimulation of the TCR results in the coordinated activation of various signalling intermediates. The few T cells that do develop in the p56<sup>lck</sup> knockout mice described above are unable to initiate effective tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream substrates<sup>34</sup>. p56<sup>lck</sup> was therefore the first crucial kinase shown to act immediately downstream of TCR stimulation. By contrast, genetic ablation of p59<sup>fyn</sup>, another prominent Src-family kinase present in T cells, results in less severe characteristics, such as a reduction in calcium mobilization in mature thymocytes<sup>39,40</sup>. Interestingly, mice that carry a double mutation of p56<sup>lck</sup> and p59<sup>fyn</sup> show a complete block in thymocyte development at the pre-TCR stage<sup>41,42</sup>, indicating that both kinases are required for thymocyte development and that p59<sup>fyn</sup> can only partially substitute for the loss of p56<sup>lck</sup>. The deletion of certain genes can also promote T-cell development. Tarakhovsky and colleagues<sup>43,44</sup> generated a conditional deletion of the Csk gene in T cells. Csk negatively regulates Src-family kinases, and loss of Csk expression led to the development of mature CD4+ T cells in a RAG-deficient background.

Further downstream, double-mutant mice that lack the tyrosine kinases ZAP70 and Syk show a complete arrest of thymocyte development at the pre-TCR stage<sup>45</sup>, a defect not observed in either ZAP70 (REF. 46) or Syk<sup>47</sup> single-mutant mice. Syk single mutants show impaired development of γδ-lineage T cells<sup>47</sup>. Knockout studies have also shown that the molecular adaptors SLP-76 (REFS 48,49), LAT<sup>50</sup> and GADS<sup>51</sup> are absolutely essential for pre-TCR signalling and early pre-TCR-driven thymocyte

Figure 3 | Cre/loxP-mediated gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. A mouse is generated in which the gene of interest is 'floxed', or flanked by loxP sites<sup>9</sup>. This mouse is then crossed with a cre transgenic mouse, which expresses Cre recombinase under the control of a tissue-specific promoter (in this case, the T-cell-specific p56<sup>lck</sup> promoter). In the progeny, Cre is expressed only in T lymphocytes, and the floxed target gene is deleted specifically in these cells.

conditions can also influence phenotypic expression of a knockout mutation. The same mutation in different animal colonies has been noted to give rise to different degrees of disease penetrance. Finally, gene deletions that affect the architecture of an organ, such as the lymph nodes or spleen, might have secondary effects on the behaviour or differentiation of cells within the organ. There is a danger that such effects might be misinterpreted as primary effects of the gene mutation on the cells themselves.

### POSITIVE THYMOCYTE SELECTION
The process in the thymus that selects thymocytes expressing T-cell receptors (TCRs) that have the ability to interact weakly with self-MHC. This weak interaction generates differentiation and survival signals in these lymphocytes, the TCRs of which later recognize foreign peptides bound to self-MHC. Positive selection establishes the MHC-restricted T-cell repertoire.

### NEGATIVE THYMOCYTE SELECTION
The deletion of self-reactive thymocytes in the thymus. Thymocytes that express T-cell receptors that strongly recognize self-peptide bound to self-MHC undergo apoptosis in response to the signalling generated by high-affinity binding.

### ADOPTIVE TRANSFER
An experimental method in which lymphocytes from an antigen-primed donor mouse are introduced into a recipient mouse that lacks lymphocyte function.

### CO-STIMULATION
Receptor-mediated signals required in addition to antigen-receptor engagement to achieve complete lymphocyte activation.

New immunological concepts
Genetically manipulated mice have been extremely useful for addressing questions related to the functional importance of a gene and for identifying pathways and the underlying mechanisms associated with this function. The study of knockout animals has also contributed to the development of important new immunological concepts and models. For example, using mice that were deficient in MHC class I gene expression, several laboratories were able to solve the long-standing paradox of how a given T-cell receptor (TCR) can signal either thymocyte differentiation and survival, or cell death. These investigations provided evidence that the mechanism that controls POSITIVE THYMOCYTE SELECTION and NEGATIVE THYMOCYTE SELECTION is governed by the affinity and the avidity of TCR-ligand interactions encountered during development<sup>19–21</sup>. In addition, the requirements for survival of mature lymphocytes were unexpectedly shown through the study of these mice. Using ADOPTIVE TRANSFER of CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell subsets into MHC-class-II- or class-I-deficient animals, several groups showed that continual engagement of MHC molecules is required for mature lymphocyte survival<sup>22,23</sup>.

Gene-targeting technology has led to new insights into apoptosis and cell survival, the role of cytokines,

maturation. Finally, animals in which CD3ε (REFS 52–56) (a TCR component), or Vav1 (REFS. 57–59) (a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for Rho-family GTPases) has been deleted show an early block at the DN transition, indicating an important role for these molecules in pre-TCR signalling.

At the double-positive (DP; CD4⁺CD8⁺) stage, thymocytes that express a mature αβTCR pass through the second important developmental checkpoint and undergo the processes of positive and negative selection. Various knockout mutants have helped define the molecules required for these processes. Examination of mice that are deficient for the TCRα chain³⁵ or CD3δ⁶⁰ showed that full expression of the TCR and its associated components is a prerequisite for both positive and negative selection, and for further maturation of DP thymocytes. CD45 (REFS 61,62), ZAP70 (REF. 63) and Vav1 (REFS 64,65) are also involved. Studies of single- and double-knockout mice that lack the Tec-family kinases Itk and Rik have shown that both of these molecules are important for setting the signalling thresholds for positive and negative selection⁶⁶,⁶⁷.

Attempts have been made to knock out genes specific for either positive or negative selection. Several lines of evidence indicate that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk2) pathway is intimately involved in positive selection (FIG. 5). Both Erk1 knockout mice and animals deficient for the novel upstream activator Ras guanyl-releasing protein (RasGRP) show defects in positive selection⁶⁸,⁶⁹. In addition, studies using CD3δ-deficient mice indicate that CD3δ functions in the coupling of TCR signals to the ERK pathway during positive selection⁷⁰. Mice that lack Id3, a nuclear helix-loop-helix protein regulated by ERK, are impaired in both positive and negative selection⁷¹,⁷². The genes necessary for negative selection are not as well defined, although many molecules have been implicated⁷³. Our laboratory recently showed that thymus-specific deletion of PTEN blocks negative selection¹¹. However, PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that antagonizes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, and it is not clear whether PTEN has a physiological role in negative selection. It is possible that the PTEN mutation might simply result in anti-apoptotic signalling, mediated partly through activation of the survival kinase protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. So far, no known mutation has unequivocally separated the processes of positive and negative selection, a finding that most likely reflects the sharing of molecular pathways. Subtle variations in downstream signalling yet to be discovered might ultimately determine cellular outcomes.

Knockout-mouse studies have also shown some unexpected players in thymocyte selection. Interferon-regulated transcription factor 1 (IRF1) is involved in the selection of CTLs, but animals that lack IRF1 show normal development of CD4⁺ lineage T cells⁷⁴. Although some of the mutant phenotypes in IRF1-deficient mice can be explained by the downregulation of MHC class I expression that occurs in thymic stromal cells⁷⁵, loss of IRF1 also results in a developmental defect that is intrinsic to thymocytes⁷⁶.

The induction and maintenance of DP lymphocyte survival provides a crucial time during which positive and negative selection can occur. Accordingly, selection has been examined in knockout mice that lack genes known to promote lymphocyte survival. Blastocyst complementation using ES cells deficient for the anti-apoptotic gene $Bcl-X_L$ showed that this molecule is particularly important at the DP stage of thymocyte development ${ }^{77,78}$. In addition, recent studies of mice that are deficient in the orphan nuclear hormone receptor retinoid-related orphan receptor-$\gamma$ ($ROR\gamma$) showed a correlation between ROR$\gamma$ and $Bcl-X_L$ expression ${ }^{79}$, implying a role for ROR$\gamma$ in thymocyte survival. The transcription factor NFAT4 (nuclear factor in activated T cells) has also been linked to DP survival ${ }^{80}$.

Together, these various gene-deficient models have led to the emergence of a multi-step model of how thymocyte development occurs. Studies of these mutant animals have also underscored the complex nature of the intricate network of differentiation and survival signals that are intertwined to promote thymocyte maturation.

**T-cell activation.** TCR triggering is a crucial and complex step in the activation of both thymocytes and mature T lymphocytes, but molecular dissection using mutant mice has shown that there are fundamental differences

in their activation pathways. Many gene-targeted mice have defects in T-lymphocyte activation and differentiation but maintain normal thymocyte maturation. An interesting case is that of the protein kinase c$\theta$ (PKC$\theta$)-deficient mice generated by Littman and colleagues ${ }^{81}$. Thymocytes from these animals undergo normal positive and negative selection, but mature T cells have defects in proliferation and nuclear factor-$\kappa B$ (NF-$\kappa B$) activation. This result identifies a previously unknown signalling molecule that is important for the activation of mature T cells, but has no apparent role in the development and selection of immature T cells. Another molecule important in NF-$\kappa B$ activation and the induction of T-cell proliferation is Bcl10 (REF. 82). Bcl10 probably acts downstream of PKCs in T cells and might couple antigen-receptor triggering to NF-$\kappa B$ activation.

Signals downstream of TCR engagement are translated into cellular responses through mobilization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of a multimolecular structure known as the IMMUNOLOGICAL SYNAPE (IS) or supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC) ${ }^{83}$. Studies of knockout mice in the 1990s shed considerable light on IS formation during T-cell activation. Loss of Vav1 (REFS 84,85) or its downstream target Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) ${ }^{86,87}$ resulted in severe defects in the cytoskeletal changes required for IS formation. TCR

Figure 5 | Schematic of TCR signalling. A summary of the signalling molecules downstream of the $\alpha\beta$TCR that influence thymocyte selection, based on various gene-targeting studies. Molecules that are involved specifically in positive selection (green), negative selection (orange), and both positive and negative selection (blue) are shown. $[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_i$, intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration; DAG, diacylglycerol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IP $_3$, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC-$\gamma$, phospholipase c-$\gamma$; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; RasGRP, Ras guanyl-releasing protein.

clustering and the formation of the immune synapse between a T cell and its antigen-presenting cell (APC) were defective. Similarly, deletion of the Vav1 and Wasp genes abrogated T-cell proliferation and cytokine production<sup>84–87</sup>. Vav1 knockout mice have also been used to define the molecular framework of the IS. Vav-deficient T cells were subjected to novel cell biology techniques that evaluate real-time signalling at the T-cell-APC interface. The results were a genetic validation that Vav1-dependent cytoskeletal changes, and cytoskeleton-dependent -antigen-receptor clustering and IS formation, are vital for T-cell functions<sup>88,89</sup>.

The importance of molecules that regulate intracellular signalling pathways was also clearly shown in studies using knockout mutations. Members of the Cbl/Sli family of E3 UBIQUITIN LIGASES function downstream of growth-factor and antigen receptors<sup>90</sup>. Mice that lack c-Cbl show enhanced positive thymocyte selection and develop splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and hyperactivation of peripheral T cells<sup>91,92</sup>, indicating that c-Cbl normally acts as a brake on TCR signalling. Knockout mice that lack Cbl-b show normal thymocyte maturation but develop spontaneous autoimmunity<sup>93,94</sup>. An unexpected finding was that mutation of Cbl-b uncouples T-cell proliferation, IL-2 production, *in vivo* immune responses and TCR clustering from a requirement for CD28 co-stimulation<sup>93–95</sup>. These results indicate that T-cell activation is due to a balance between TCR triggering, co-stimulatory signals and thresholds set by negative regulatory molecules.

One important surprise from the study of immune system knockout mice was that IL-2 is not absolutely required for T-cell activation *in vivo*. In vitro studies had indicated that IL-2 was the main factor required for T-cell proliferation and the generation of T-cell lines and clones. However, mice deficient for IL-2 retained most T-cell functions<sup>96</sup>. Even more perplexing at the time was the finding that mice deficient in IL-2 or one of the IL-2 receptor subunits went on to develop autoimmunity characterized by lymphoproliferation<sup>97–99</sup>. So, although IL-2 clearly has a role in lymphocyte proliferation *in vitro*, it is not required, and in fact is unnecessary to regulate T lymphocytes *in vivo*. We now know that these results are partially due to cytokine redundancy, in that IL-15 and IL-21 can also support T-cell activation and proliferation.

**T-cell co-stimulation.** Co-stimulation is a vital step in T-cell activation and differentiation. Since 1993, studies of knockout mice have provided particularly useful insights into the roles of these cell-surface molecules and their ligands. Analysis of mutant mice deficient for the most prominent co-stimulatory surface molecule, CD28, or its ligands, CD80/CD86 (B7-1/B7-2), have defined its many functions. CD28-deficient mice have defects in mature lymphocyte activation and T-cell function<sup>100</sup>. CD28-deficient T cells show impaired proliferation in response to activating stimuli and a reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-dependent production of neutralizing antibodies. Analysis of mice deficient in either CD80 or CD86 showed that these molecules have

overlapping, vital functions in immunoglobulin class switching and germinal centre formation<sup>101</sup>. As predicted, CD28 also has a role in peripheral tolerance by preventing anergy, as T cells from CD28-deficient mice rapidly become non-responsive after TCR stimulation<sup>102,103</sup>. Other studies using TCR transgenic models in the CD28<sup>-/-</sup> genetic background indicated that CD28 reduces the number of TCRs that need to be triggered for the induction of proliferation to low affinity ligands, broadening the T-cell repertoire<sup>104,105</sup>.

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4; CD152), a molecule which is related to CD28 and binds to CD80/86, is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. However, the function of this molecule was controversial until the generation of CTLA4-deficient mice. Many early reports had indicated that CTLA4 positively regulated the immune response, but CTLA4-deficient mice showed widespread T-cell activation and rampant lymphoproliferation<sup>106,107</sup>. Recent insights into the role of CTLA4 have indicated that this molecule influences the immune system primarily through its effects on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> immunoregulatory cells<sup>108,109</sup>. This population is also apparently regulated by interactions between CD28 and CD80/86 (REF. 110).

Knockout mice have been generated for several other co-stimulatory members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) is a molecule related to CD28 and CTLA4, the expression of which is upregulated on TCR engagement. Mice deficient for ICOS have defects in IL-4 production and impaired humoral responses to T-cell-dependent antigens<sup>111–113</sup>. Mice that lack the CD28 family member programmed death 1 (PD1) suffer from myeloid hyperplasia, arthritis, carditis and glomerulonephritis when the animals are of the C57Bl/6 genetic background<sup>114</sup>. Intriguingly, PD1 knockout mice of a BALB/c background develop immune-associated dilated cardiomyopathy with severely impaired contraction and congestive heart failure<sup>115</sup>. The data indicate that PD1 is another negative regulator of T-cell activation that might be crucial for the prevention of autoimmune disease. Genetic background strongly affects the outcome and target tissues of autoimmunity in the absence of PD1.

Members of the tumour-necrosis family (TNF) and TNF-receptor (TNFR) family are also involved in the activation of the immune response. CD40 is expressed primarily on ‘professional’ APCs, such as B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. B cells of mice that lack CD40 cannot interact with CD40 ligand (CD40L; CD154) upregulated on T lymphocytes after activation, which leads to a failure in T-cell-B-cell collaboration and impaired humoral responses<sup>116–118</sup>. Studies of these animals have also shown that CD40-CD40L interactions regulate CD80 expression, emphasizing the web-like nature of lymphocyte-APC interactions during T-cell activation<sup>119,120</sup>. Mice deficient for OX40 (CD134) or its ligand OX40L have shown the importance of these TNF/TNFR family co-stimulators in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation and APC function<sup>121–123</sup>. The sheer number of immunoglobulin and TNF/TNFR superfamilly members involved in immune system regulation is surprising.

Gene-knockout technology has proved an essential tool for unravelling the hidden roles of these molecules in cellular and humoral immune responses *in vivo*.

### Future directions

As gene-targeting techniques are further refined, they promise to shed more light on the diverse *in vivo* functions of co-stimulatory and regulatory molecules that govern lymphocyte development, activation, apoptosis and survival. With respect to knockout technology, such refinements will probably include the design of mutational systems in which genes can be switched on and off at will, so that, for example, the behaviour and effects of a signalling molecule can be examined when it is activated, then inactivated, then activated again. We can expect to see wider use of the knocking in of reporter gene constructs to more precisely monitor gene expression, and the fine-tuning of point mutation knock-in techniques. Gene trapping in conjunction with random knockouts, a technique established using P-element insertions in *Drosophila*, will be used more extensively in mammalian cells to identify genes the deletion of which generates a phenotype of interest. Any advance in knockout/knock-in design must also take into consideration that ‘context is all’, with respect to gene function. A signal transduction pathway worked out in one cell type might be irrelevant in another cell type, or indeed, in the same cell type in a different microenvironment. Future mutational systems must be able to examine a biological response more holistically, taking into account the complex interplay between genes and their products.

With respect to unresolved immunological questions, one important mechanism that remains undefined is the pathway(s) that controls the negative selection of thymocytes. A multitude of co-stimulatory ligands also remain to be defined. Identification of these molecules and delineation of the interplay between them will help demystify the complexities of lymphocyte activation. A greater understanding of the genes involved in lymphocyte biology will also unravel mechanisms underlying genetic susceptibility and the induction of autoimmune disease and haematopoietic malignancies.
