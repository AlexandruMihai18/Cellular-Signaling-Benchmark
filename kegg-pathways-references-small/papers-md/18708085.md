ABSTRACT

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the first key hormone of reproduction. GnRH analogs are extensively used in *in vitro* fertilization, and treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers, due to their ability to bring about ‘chemical castration’. The interaction of GnRH with its cognate type I receptor (GnRHR) in pituitary gonadotropes results in the activation of Gq/G₁₁, phospholipase Cβ (PLCβI), PLA₂, and PLD. Sequential activation of the phospholipases generates the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate (IP₃), diacylglycerol (DAG), and arachidonic acid (AA), which are required for Ca²⁺ mobilization, the activation of various protein kinase C isoforms (PKCs), and the production of prostaglandin (PG) and other metabolites of AA, respectively. PKC isoforms are the major mediators of the downstream activation of a number of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades by GnRH, namely: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38MAPK. The activated MAPKs phosphorylate both cytosolic and nuclear proteins to initiate the transcriptional activation of the gonadotropin subunit genes and the GnRHR. While Ca²⁺ mobilization has been found to initiate rapid gonadotropin secretion, Ca²⁺, together with various PKC isoforms, MAPKs and AA metabolites also serve as key nodes, in the GnRH-stimulated signaling network that enables the gonadotropes to decode GnRH pulse frequencies and translating that into differential gonadotropin synthesis and release. Even though pulsatility of GnRH is recognized as a major determinant for differential gonadotropin subunit gene expression and gonadotropin secretion very little is yet known about the signaling circuits governing GnRH action at the ‘Systems Biology’ level. Direct apoptotic and metastatic effects of GnRH analogs in gonadal steroid-dependent cancers expressing the GnRHR also seem to be mediated by the activation of the PKC/MAPK pathways. However, the mechanisms dictating life (pituitary) vs. death (cancer) decisions made by the same GnRHR remain elusive. Understanding these molecular mechanisms triggered by the GnRHR through biochemical and ‘Systems Biology’ approaches would provide the basis for the construction of the dynamic connectivity maps, which operate in the various cell types (endocrine, cancer, and immune system) targeted by GnRH. The connectivity maps will open a new vista for exploring the direct effects of GnRH analogs in tumors and the design of novel combined therapies for fertility control, reproductive disorders and cancers.

1. Introduction

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was first known as luteinizing hormone releasing factor (LRF) and later as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH). GnRH mediates the neural control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and secretion. LHRH discovery has established a link between the ‘Neuro’ and the ‘Humoral’ systems as predicted in the ‘Neurohumoral Hypothesis’ [73,71]. Richard Lower (1631–1691), an Oxford physician to Charles II, appended to his ‘de corde’ the ‘Dissertate de Origine Catarrhi’ [73,71], in which he overturned Galen’s principal that ‘animal spirit’ was formed from ‘vital spirit’ in the brain, while the waste passes through the ventricles to be distilled in the pituitary gland into the nose as nasal mucus (‘pituita’), and further proposed the ‘Neurohumoral Hypothesis’ [73,71]. Still, the credit for the conceptual leap from the ‘Neurohumoral Hypothesis’ to GnRH release goes to Geoffrey Wingfield Harris (1913–1971) [86,104,105,315]. The activity of
LHRH was first demonstrated by McCann’s group [190,191]. It was the pioneering work of McCann and others like G. Fink [72], the establishment of the radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow that will enable Andrew Schally and Roger Guillemin to isolate and characterize LRF/LHRH as (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly.NH₂) [31,182,276]. As it was a better releaser of LH than FSH, GnRH was first called LRF/LHRH in anticipation that a separate FSH releasing hormone (FSHRH) would later be isolated. However, the administration of an LHRH antagonist, or antibodies to LHRH, reduced serum levels of both LH and FSH, and therefore LHRH became GnRH, namely a gonadotropin (LH + FSH) releasing hormone [138].

Signaling pathways are a major driving force in both animals and plants. Cell–cell communication is critical for cellular development, growth, metabolism, reproduction, and homeostasis. Claude Bernard (1813–1878), the father of modern physiology, introduced the concept of a Milieu intérieur (internal environment), in which even though the conditions in the world around us constantly change, a delicate balance of internal characteristics within our bodies is not affected due to homeostasis. Signal transduction is the vehicle of homeostasis and hence must be tightly controlled to sustain life, while dysregulation of signaling pathways culminates in disease.

GnRH is released from some 1000 neurons within the hypothalamus in a pulsatile manner (every 30–120 min according to the species). GnRH gene expression apparently occurs intermittently and is dependent on a 300-bp promoter region termed the neuron specific enhancer (NSE) [44,150,15,314,258]. GnRH stimulates pituitary gonadotropes (about 5–10% of anterior pituitary cells) to synthesize and release the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. Gonadotropes from adult male rat pituitaries consist of 70% multi-hormonal cells (LH + FSH), 16% mono-hormonal LH cells, and 14% mono-hormonal FSH cells [41]. Occupancy of some 20% of GnRHR by GnRH is sufficient to evoke about 80% of the maximal rate of gonadotropin secretion in cultured rat pituitary cells [215]. The gonadotropins are members of the glycoprotein hormone family, and stimulate spermatogenesis, folliculogenesis, and ovulation.

Sex and reproduction sculpt the brain and behavior with a key role for GnRH [117]. The plasticity of GnRH effects within an organism context is governed by environmental cues. Photoperiod regulates GnRH synthesis and release in an experience-dependent manner in the European starling, and social cues regulate GnRH signaling in cichlid fishes (ibid). GnRH neurons are the master regulators of reproductive endocrine status, and afferent pathways to the GnRH neurons have evolved to ensure reproductive success [24,339]. GnRH neurons were shown to originate in embryonic olfactory tissue [331,277] and GnRH was shown to modulate olfactory sensory neurons. Molecules distributed in gradients in the olfactory system and the basal forebrain contributes to their migration [306]. Tracing experiments have pointed to the vomeronasal (VNO) pathway as a major input to GnRH neurons [246], in line with the idea that detection of pheromones would mediate the gender and species-specific cues to control mating behavior and reproductive success. However, Yoon et al. [339] could not find an anatomical connection between GnRH neurons and the VNO but pointed to other sensory inputs, such as the primary olfactory cortex as the link to the GnRH neurons. Boehm et al. [24] found that GnRH neurons integrate information from multiple sources and in turn, have an impact on numerous brain functions such as sexual behavior. Paracrine interactions between GnRH neurons, glial, and epithelial cells of the median eminence coordinate GnRH secretion. Nitric oxide (NO) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), generated by the epithelial cells and astrocytes, respectively, acting via Smad phosphorylation, regulate GnRH release [254,77]. TGF-β and the Kisspeptin-GPR54 signaling in the brain is now recognized as an important conduit for controlling GnRH

secretion in the developing and the adult animal [59,282,85,195,64]. Thus, the Kisspeptin-GPR54-GnRH cascade plays a key role in the onset of mammalian puberty and later in reproductive physiology [239,102,286,280].

Food availability is the most important factor that influences mammalian reproduction [115]. Undernutrition delays the onset of sexual maturation, disrupts estrous cycles, delays the postpartum return to estrus and negatively affects sexual behavior (ibid). Undernutrition negatively regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by decreasing GnRH secretion. Leptin is the key player in the mediation of the link between nutrition, metabolism, and reproduction.

GnRH is a highly conserved decapeptide with some twenty-four closely related structural variants found in protochordates and vertebrates, representing some 550 million years of evolution [196,303]. Most vertebrates express more than one form of GnRH and some express three forms. Among the earliest evolved forms are the octopus, sea squirt (*Ciona*) and chicken GnRH, known also as GnRHII [303]. GnRHI is found in early bony fish, lungfish, amphibians, and mammals. Immunoreactive GnRHI was found in scleractinian coral, with a dramatic increase during the spawning period [310]. GnRHI regulates the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and gonadotropin secretion. GnRHII is conserved from bony fish to man, has a wide distribution in the brain, in particular the hindbrain and spinal cord [326,311] and may be involved in reproductive behavior [69]. Indeed, infusion of GnRHII increased the total number of proceptive (sexual solicitation) behaviors exhibited by female marmoset monkeys towards their pair mates [10]. GnRHIII (salmon GnRH; sGnRH) functions in teleost and sGnRH neurons project throughout the brain and are thought to play a neuromodulatory role [236]. Although three cognate receptors have evolved [235], in man and several other species GnRHII is disrupted by a frame shift and premature stop codon and is not expressed as a mature and functional receptor [200]. In these species, GnRHII may act via binding to GnRHI. GnRHII has been found to stimulate sexual behavior and inhibit short-term food intake in underfed female shrews, independent of GnRHI, thus suggesting a role for GnRHII in sexual behavior in those species where it is expressed [129]. A human GnRHII gene fragment corresponding to the domains from the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane domain-5 to the carboxyl terminus of the putative full-length receptor has been identified [242]. Transient cotransfection of GnRHI and the truncated GnRHII resulted in reduced expression of GnRHI and impaired signaling of GnRHI. The authors concluded that the protein encoded by GnRHII gene may play a modulatory role in GnRHI expression (ibid).

Naturally occurring mutations in GnRHI result in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, demonstrating its crucial role in the physiology of reproduction [58,152,281,140]. The majority of the mutations result in poor expression and stability of the receptors [153]. However, even without mutations, a large proportion of the human GnRHR are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas most of the rat GnRHR is being routed to the plasma membrane [27]. Still, once mutations occur, the receptors are recognized by the quality control system as misfolded proteins and more receptors are retained in the ER.

Since GPCRs are relatively large membrane-embedded proteins, X-ray crystallography and NMR studies have encountered difficulties in trying to solve their 3D structure. Nevertheless, the X-ray structures of the bovine light receptor rhodopsin, bacteriorhodopsin and the human βII adrenergic receptor were determined [245,238,257]. In the absence of experimentally determined structures for most GPCRs, computational protein-modeling is currently being used as an alternative approach [283,284,175].

It is thought that constraining intramolecular interactions have been conserved during evolution to maintain the GPCRs preferen-
tially in an inactive state in the absence of an agonist [83]. According to the extended ternary complex model, the receptor is in equilibrium between an inactive state (R) and active state (R*) [271]. Under basal conditions, most of the receptor molecules are in the R state, but some assume the R* conformation spontaneously. Ligands bind with higher affinity to the R* state and therefore shift the equilibrium to the active R* state. Inverse agonists (capable of inhibiting an agonist-independent receptor activity) shift the equilibrium to the inactive R state. Antagonists bind to both R and R* and compete therefore with the ligand for binding to R* [83]. In the multistate model, the receptor alternates between multiple inactive and active conformations, even in the absence of the ligand [83]. Ligand binding stabilizes a given conformation and the interaction with a selective G-protein reveals whether the complex is bound by an agonist or by an inverse agonist. Furthermore, multiple conformations may be recognized as active states, giving rise to the possibility that multiple analogs of a given hormone may be able to activate the same receptor by binding to different conformations, as in the Kenakin model. According to this model [131]; different agonists can stabilize different receptor active states, leading to selective signaling pathways ('agonist trafficking of receptor signals'). In the case of the GnRHR, it was proposed that a bi-directional receptor activation process could take place, in which a GnRH ligand binds a particular GnRHR conformation, forming a signaling complex, which feeds-back by stabilizing the given receptor conformation and hence the ligand binding 'ligand induced selective signaling' (LISS) [196,175,174,197]. GPCR may therefore oscillate between various conformations, leading to preferential interactions with different intracellular protein complexes and activation of specific signal transduction pathways.

Structure-function studies on the GnRHR [196,197], studies on the regulation of GnRHR gene expression [40,103] and studies on the extra-pituitary functions of GnRH [88,328] have been reviewed recently and will not be discussed here. We will focus on signaling events associated with GPCRs in general and GnRHR in particular. We will emphasize the cross talk between the major players of GPCR signaling namely, Ca²⁺, PKCs and MAPKs since they are key nodes in the interaction network of the GnRHR, which may enable the gonadotrope to decode the nature of the pulsatile secretion of GnRH and to activate a program of transcription leading to differential gonadotropin synthesis and release. An understanding of the signaling mechanisms evoked by the GnRHR could help establish connectivity maps, point to potential signaling cascades in cancer cells as targets for new drugs and would open a vista for the future development of the next generation of GnRH analogs for fertility regulation and cancer treatment.

## 2. Signaling of the GnRH receptor in pituitary gonadotropes

### 2.1. GnRH receptor coupling to G-proteins

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are the largest group of membrane receptors [83]. There are some 800 GPCRs, half of which are devoted to olfaction and vision and some 150 orphan receptors. Since GPCRs mediate a wide variety of pathologies, such as neural, cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, inflammatory and other diseases, GPCRs are therefore the target for some 50–60% of all drugs [137]. GPCR ligands include light, odorants, pH, ions, amino acids, taste molecules, glycoproteins, proteases, peptide hormones, neurotransmitters, chemokines, nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acids, and lipid signaling molecules. GPCRs transduce the extracellular stimuli via heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). GPCRs are divided into three major subfamilies: the receptors related to rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor (Family A); the receptors related to the glucagon receptor (Family B), and the receptors related to the metabotropic neurotransmitter

receptors (Family C) [83]. The GnRHR is a member of Family A of GPCRs [259,309].

G-proteins consist of Gα, β, and γ subunits. The activation of Gα proteins is mediated by agonist binding to the GPCR, resulting in exchanges of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit. Gα-GTP dissociates from Gβγ and stimulates downstream effectors. Hence, GPCRs act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the G-proteins. In some systems, Gβγ is also capable of activating effector systems. Activation of the effectors translates the extracellular cue to a cellular event. Intrinsic GTPase activity of the α-subunit then turns off the signal by hydrolyzing Gα-GTP to Gα-GDP, which re-associates with Gβγ [33]. There are over 20 Gα subunits divided into four major families: Gαq/11, which activates phospholipase C (PLC), Gαs, which activates adenylyl cyclase, Gαi/o, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase and Gα₁₂/₁₃, which activates small GTPases [226,229]. In the case of the GnRHR, the amino acid residues essential for G-protein coupling are conserved among the cloned mammalian and non-mammalian GnRHR [5,304,206,121,157], thus suggesting similar mechanisms of receptor activation among the various GnRHRs.

It was proposed that GnRHR interacts mainly with Gαq/11 in pituitary gonadotropes [218,118,87]. In contrast, others have implicated Gαq/11, Gαi, and Gαs [110,295], or Gαq/11 and Gαs [169]. GnRH exerts multiple effects upon pituitary gonadotropes such as secretion, synthesis, and phenotype maintenance. To do so, GnRHR may interact with multiple G-proteins in order to mediate the various biological actions [295,169]. Alternatively, GnRHR may interact with a single G-protein leading to the activation of different downstream cascades that mediate its diverse functions [87]. In this case, the point of diversion will occur after G-protein activation, apparently by recruiting different signaling complexes as above.

It is thought that the pattern of GnRH pulse frequencies is responsible for the differential synthesis of LH vs. FSH [30]. High frequency of GnRH pulses (~10 min), favors the expression of common α and, to a lesser effect that of LHβ, while low frequencies (~120 min) selectively increase FSHβ mRNA levels (ibid). It is thought that low pulse frequencies will stimulate FSH production in the follicular phase needed for follicle growth, while higher frequencies will favor LH release needed for ovulation. The rise in levels of gonadal steroids will inhibit the release of GnRH and gonadotropin levels, while corpus luteum regression will result in the decrease in the steroids and the initiation of a new reproductive cycle (ibid). An intriguing question is how pulsatile GnRH secretion is decoded by signaling pathways.

A 'cycle of signaling' that may decode a GnRH pulse can already be detected at the G-protein level. GnRH increases the mRNA levels of RGS2 (regulators of G-protein signaling), a large family of proteins that modulate G-protein activity by interacting with active Gα-subunits to accelerate their intrinsic GTPase activity and limit their half-life [20]. On the other hand, GnRH activates PKC, and PKC is known to phosphorylate RGS2 leading to its inhibition and hence may reduce the deactivation by RGS2 of the Gα-subunits, providing a potential 'signaling cycle'.

In hypothalamic neurons and immortalized neuronal cell lines, GnRH regulates its own secretion via the GnRHR, and it was proposed that GnRHR interacts with multiple G-proteins such as Gαq/11, Gαi, and Gαs [146]. It is also known that GnRH analogs exert direct anti-proliferative actions upon sex hormone-dependent tumors, with which Gαi has been implicated [328,164,122,66,89, 165,144,184]. Hence, GnRHR interacts with different G-proteins in a 'cell context'-dependent manner.

### 2.2. GnRH receptors and adenylyl and guanylyl cyclase signaling

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) was first discovered in 1957 by Sutherland and Rall when they purified a heat-stable factor from hepatic tissue
after the addition of glucagons or epinephrine [111]. Cyclic AMP is now recognized as the classical second messenger mediating the actions of many hormones and neurotransmitters. Although cAMP was the first messenger molecule to be implicated in GnRH stimulation of gonadotropin secretion in the rat pituitary [26], we and others have demonstrated that elevation in cAMP production is not essential for GnRH-induced gonadotropin release in rat pituitary cells in culture [212,213,48].

GnRH stimulates cAMP production in LβT2 gonadotrope cells [149]. Stimulation of cAMP production is Ca²⁺-independent, mimicked by PMA and blocked by a PKC inhibitor. Further analysis has implicated PKCδ and PKCε in the apparent activation of adenylyl cyclase 5 and 7 (AC5 and AC7) as mediators of cAMP elevation by GnRH (ibid). In the rat gonadotropes, the gonadotropin subunit promoters contain CREs and cAMP may therefore play a role in gonadotropin synthesis by activation of the CRE binding protein, CREB. Indeed, GnRH stimulation of αT3-1 cells resulted in a four-to fivefold increase in phospho-CREB [63]. Also, elevation of cAMP levels stimulates the transcription of αGSU in mouse, rat, and human [57,186]. Exposure of rat pituitary cells to a cell-permeable analog of cAMP resulted in stimulation of αGSU, but not LHβ or FSHβ mRNA levels [93]. Nevertheless, in most species examined, activation of the CREs in the gonadotropin subunit promoters is mediated by the MAPK cascade, rather than by cAMP [30,28,107,108,50]. Indeed, c-Jun and activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, which are known MAPK substrates, have been shown to bind the CRE of αGSU [113]. Xie et al. [336] found increased expression of ATF-3 after a GnRH challenge. Additionally, PKC iso- zymes, ERK, and JNK were all implicated in ATF-3 expression. GnRH induced recruitment of ATF-3, c-Jun, and c-Fos to the dual CREs of αGSU promoter. Transcription of secretogranin II by GnRH in αT3-1 cells is also mediated by ATF-3 binding to the CRE [335]. The authors concluded that the dual CREs of αGSU and the CRE of secretogranin II are the target of GnRH-induced MAPK regulation [336,335].

GnRH auto-sensitizes the gonadotropes by up-regulating its own receptor preparatory to the onset of puberty and for the LH surge that triggers ovulation [274,45,173]. Cyclic AMP was shown to enhance gonadotrope responsiveness to GnRH by up-regulating GnRHR expression [341,167]. The mouse GnRHR promoter contains two CREs, and it was shown that cAMP stimulates the promoter when expressed in GH₃ cells [101]. In any case, it is now thought that the homologous up-regulation of the GnRHR by GnRH is mainly mediated by the PKC/MAPK/JNK pathway and a consensus AP-1 motif [234,327,65].

The role of cyclic GMP (cGMP) in rat gonadotrope functions is complex. We could not find a role for this cyclic nucleotide in GnRH-induced LH release in cultured rat pituitary cells [209]. Others have suggested that the rise in cGMP may be linked to the induced expression of nitric oxide synthase type I (NOS-I) by GnRH in rat pituitary gonadotropes, but the role of NO/cGMP has not yet been clarified [79,80,8]. Neuronal NOS is a Ca²⁺-sensitive enzyme and activation of a Ca²⁺ mobilizing pathway by GnRH is thus expected to stimulate this enzyme [38]. Also, pituitary cells express the soluble guanylyl cyclase α1-β1 dimer, implying that NO can stimulate cGMP production [3,139]. However, a direct proof that cGMP is involved in GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion has not been provided and its role is therefore still elusive. Interestingly, it was recently proposed that the multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) 4, 5, and 8 are potential ATP-dependent export pumps for cAMP and cGMP [124]. Although pituitary cells express these MRPs, it was recently proposed that MRP5 participates in cGMP, but not cAMP export from pituitary cells [4]. Hence, the majority of cGMP is rapidly released from the pituitary cells by MRP5, limiting the intracellular messenger function of this signaling molecule.

It is also tempting to suggest that both cAMP and cGMP act as modulators of specific cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels in rat pituitary gonadotropes as in other systems [333,183]. CNG channels do not operate by voltage gating, but are regulated by the direct reversible interaction with cAMP/cGMP and are permeable to monovalent and divalent cations and can therefore regulate intracellular Ca²⁺ levels. Activation of store-operated Ca²⁺ entry during hyperpolarization may open cGMP-induced CNG channels and can promote Ca²⁺ entry, resulting in depolarization [333]. CNG channel expression is up-regulated by NO, which also results in elevated Ca²⁺ levels [347]. We therefore propose that the role of gonadotrope cAMP and cGMP/NO is their ability to serve as modulators of Ca²⁺ homeostasis during GnRH action.

### 2.3. Sequential activation of phospholipases by the GnRH receptor

Phospholipases are divided according to their specificities. The phospholipidic bonds hydrolyzed by the various phospholipases (PLs) (A₁, A₂, C, D) are shown in Fig. 1. Products of PL hydrolysis are lipids or fatty acids (e.g., DAG, AA, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and phosphatidic acid (PA)) and water soluble (e.g., IP₃) mediators. Following the activation of Gαq/11 by the GnRHR, a rapid Ca²⁺-independent stimulation of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) (5–30 s) is detected [218]. The initial activation of PLCβ results in elevation of cellular Ca²⁺ levels, while the elevated Ca²⁺ may drive further activation of PLCβ in a positive, feed-forward mechanism [147]. One of the newest members of the PLC family is PLCε. Some GPCR agonists, such as endothelin 1 (ET-1), LPA, and thrombin, can activate both PLCβ and PLCε. PLCβ is predominantly involved in acute responses, while PLCε is involved in sustained hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) [130]. GnRH activation of PLCβ will cleave PIP₂ to generate inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are the second messengers required for Ca²⁺ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum and PKC activation, respectively [207,298]. Following a short time lag (~5–15 min), GnRH then activates phospholipase D (PLD) and phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂) [210,228,208,349,251]. PLD acts mainly on phosphatidylcholine, a major membrane phospholipid, and the PA formed by PLD can be converted to DAG by a specific PA-phosphohydrolase. The second wave of DAG formation provides high amounts of DAG, which may bring about a second wave of activation of PKC isoforms in a more prolonged manner. Another

Fig. 1. Specificity of phospholipases. In most phospholipids the fatty acid chains attached to C₁ and C₂ are saturated (R₁) and unsaturated (R₂), respectively. During phospholipid metabolism the phosphatidyl unit reacts with the hydroxyl group of a polar alcohol (R₃) (e.g., serine, choline, ethanolamine, inositol). Thus, PLA₁ and PLA₂ will generate fatty acids; PLC will participate in the phosphoinositide turnover (see text) and PLD will generate phosphatidic acid (PA) and a polar alcohol. The drawing is by the courtesy of Boris Shterental.source of messenger molecules is PLA₂, whose activation although delayed, provides long chain unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic (AA), oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. The fatty acids have been implicated in the activation of selected PKC isoforms, [219,14,6]. Moreover, AA was recently shown to activate a selective Ca²⁺-ARC channel [291]. AA can also bind and activate GPR40, now implicated as a receptor for long chain fatty acids [250]. Nevertheless, AA is released by GnRH [210] and its lipoxygenase products have been implicated in GnRH-induced gonadotropin synthesis and release [208,312,217,133,52,19,290]. More recently we followed the AA products in the prostaglandin (PG) synthesis pathway and found a novel inside-out signaling pathway in which newly formed PGs inhibit GnRH autoregulation of its own receptors and selectively reduce LH release by GnRH [224].

### 2.4. Role of calcium in GnRH receptor signaling

Calcium ions (Ca²⁺) represent a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger with enormous versatility [21]. The versatility of Ca²⁺ is based on its binding kinetics, varying amplitude, spatio-temporal distribution and multiple cross talks with other signaling cascades. This versatility enables Ca²⁺ to participate in numerous and sometimes opposing functions (ibid).

The early works focused on the role of extracellular Ca²⁺ in GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion [317,318,180,214,47]. Later it was demonstrated that GnRH stimulates rapid Ca²⁺ mobilization from internal IP₃-sensitive stores, followed by external Ca²⁺ influx via nifedipine-sensitive L-type voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ channels [298,220,297]. Three different types of Ca²⁺ responses are elicited in single gonadotropes by GnRH: sub-thresholds, baseline oscillations and biphasic responses [297,120,156]. A model was proposed to explain the mechanism of Ca²⁺ oscillations in pituitary gonadotropes [160]. Elevated levels of IP₃ activate the endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ channels leading to Ca²⁺ release into the cytosol. In a feedback mechanism, the elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ inhibits the IP₃ sensitive Ca²⁺ channels. The elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ is then pumped back to the endoplasmic reticulum, the channels recover and the cycle is repeated. The mitochondria take up Ca²⁺ rapidly during GnRH-induced Ca²⁺ elevation, and this accounts for 40% of the Ca²⁺ clearance from the cytosol during each cycle [125]. Furthermore, the mitochondria lower the local Ca²⁺ near sites that trigger exocytosis, and therefore limit the process. Since PKC can exert a negative feedback on PLCβ and hence IP₃ and Ca²⁺ elevation, ligand activation of PKC can also participate in the mechanisms leading to Ca²⁺ oscillations. Indeed, in some other systems, oscillations in IP₃ production or in PKC activation have been reported [275]. Interestingly, inhibition of PLCβ by PKC occurs in gonadotropes but is not essential for GnRH-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations, and non-oscillatory IP₃ is sufficient to generate periodic Ca²⁺ release [297].

A single pool Ca²⁺ oscillator is responsible for receptor, and non-receptor-operated Ca²⁺ oscillations via the IP₃ receptor in pituitary gonadotropes [298]. Pituitary cells release ATP and express several subtypes of purinergic P2 receptors, and it was shown that those receptors operate apparently as pace making channels to modulate GnRH-controlled electrical activity and gonadotropin secretion [343]. We have described a gonadotrope oscillator that seems to be involved in pulsatile gonadotropin secretion [159]. It was recently demonstrated that exposure of LβT2 cells to GnRH resulted in induction of the clock gene mPer1 via the PKC/MAPK pathway [237]. The functional significance of mPer1 expression and the possible link to the above oscillator are still not known.

The rapid exocytotic response elicited by GnRH (∼100 s) can be attributed to oscillatory Ca²⁺ signals mobilized by IP₃ [308]. IP₃ releases Ca²⁺ selectively from subsurface cisternae, raising the cytosolic free Ca²⁺ levels near the exocytotic sites to fivefold above the overall average, resulting in the release of ∼100 granules/s at 1 μM of free Ca²⁺ [308]. However, gonadotropin secretion will last more than 100 s under physiological pulses of GnRH and therefore the second phase of secretion may be mediated by Ca²⁺ influx and additional messenger molecules, such as PKC and lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid [207,298,133,52,299]. It is thought that PKC exerts a priming effect on secretory vesicles in general and increases the affinity of the exocytic apparatus to Ca²⁺ [337,332]. Hence, in the gonadotropes, PKC may enable further secretion of gonadotropins in the face of diminishing levels of cellular Ca²⁺, in particular during the plateau phase of gonadotropin secretion [297,350].

With regard to ‘hot spots’ of Ca²⁺ near exocytic sites, it was demonstrated that the initiation of the Ca²⁺ waves in pituitary gonadotropes occurred at a membranal region with high-density of GnRHR [156]. We have demonstrated exocytic sites in pituitary gonadotropes by co-localization of GnRHR with LH and FSH granules [211]. Compartmentalization of Ca²⁺ pools has been described in polarized cells [161]. Compartmentalization of Ca²⁺ pools has also been recently described in gonadotropes [225,23]. Constitutive localization of the GnRHR to low density membrane microdomains (rafts) was shown to be required for GnRHR signaling to ERK [225,23]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Ca²⁺ binds to calmodulin and may thus form part of a signaling platform within the lipid rafts, including the GnRHR and c-Raf kinase, leading to ERK activation [264].

As will be discussed below, activation of MAPK is a major pathway in GnRHR signaling, that is mainly involved in gonadotropin synthesis [223]. It was demonstrated that ERK activation by GnRH in rat pituitary cultures and αT3-1 cells is mediated by Ca²⁺ influx via voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels and not via Ca²⁺ mobilization [204,203]. On the other hand, JNK activation is mediated by Ca²⁺ mobilization, but not by Ca²⁺ influx (ibid).

As regard the differential release of the gonadotropins, it should be noted that the proportion of FSH released constitutively exceeds that for LH, while the proportion of LH released in a pulsatile manner exceeds that of FSH [68,241]. Another difference is the role of GnRH that seems to be crucial for LH, but less for FSH release (ibid). Only LH is transported to secretory granules in association with secretogranin II, while FSH is sorted mainly through a constitutive pathway [241]. Ca²⁺ is required mainly for elevation of αGSU and LHβ mRNA levels by GnRH, but less for FSHβ [18,94,17,273,321].

To study whether Ca²⁺ oscillations may participate in decoding GnRH pulse frequencies employed to bring about differential subunit gene expression, Haisenleder et al. [92] stimulated cultured rat pituitary cells with pulses of the Ca²⁺ channel activator, BAYK8644 and KCL, and measured the level of gonadotropin subunit transcription. It was found that αGSU was selectively stimulated by fast (15 min) pulses; LHβ was stimulated by slow pulses (15–60 min), while still slower pulses (180 min) selectively increased FSHβ transcription. Thus, intermittent changes in Ca²⁺ may be involved in the decoding of the GnRH pulse frequencies to give rise to differential gonadotropin subunit gene expression.

Using a nuclear run-on assay on a promoter-luciferase construct assay, some reports found that Ca²⁺ mediates elevation of αGSU and LHβ mRNA levels [322]. Others reported elevation by Ca²⁺ of αGSU, LHβ, and FSHβ mRNA levels [97]. Still others, using the GH₃ cells that stably express the GnRHR, reported that Ca²⁺ is involved in the transcription of αGSU, but not LHβ or FSHβ subunit genes [273]. Vasilyev et al. [313] reported that LHβ transcription was elevated by acute (6 h) treatment of LβT4 cells by GnRH or TPA, but not by Ca²⁺. In contrast, long-term treatment (24 h) with GnRH, TPA or Ca²⁺ each repressed LHβ transcription. We found a role for Ca²⁺ in GnRH stimulation of αGSU, but not LHβ or FSHβ transcription [107,108,25].
How does Ca²⁺ exert its functions on gonadotropin synthesis and release?

Interestingly, high and low Ca²⁺-sensitive populations of vesicles have recently been observed in LβT2 cells [172]. The high sensitive pool began to secrete at low Ca²⁺ concentrations (<1 μM) with low Ca²⁺ cooperativity. The second phase of secretion by the low sensitive Ca²⁺ pool began at high Ca²⁺ concentrations (>5 μM) with high Ca²⁺ cooperativity. The high Ca²⁺ sensitive pool is increased threefold by the PKC activator TPA. Forskolin, a cAMP/PKA activator, has no effect on the size of the two pools, while GnRH has a dramatic effect on both pools. It is possible that gonadotropes contain different Ca²⁺-sensitive populations of vesicles, which are distributed differently in mono- and multi-hormonal cells and may account for the differential release of the gonadotropins by GnRH. The heterogeneity of Ca²⁺-sensitive vesicles provides the possibility of a mechanism for the translation of the pulsatility of GnRH into differential gonadotropin secretion. Gonadotropin secretion most likely follows the general vesicular transport cascade in which Ca²⁺ activates Rab3A, leading to the tethering of the gonadotropin granules to the plasma membrane. Priming by NSF is followed by SNARE protein assembly (syntaxin, SNAP25, and synaptobrevin) in trans and results in SNARE-dependent docking of the granules. The docking machinery interacts with the Ca²⁺ sensor synaptotagmin, that undergoes a conformational change leading to the initiation of lipid bilayer fusion and regulated exocytosis in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner [293]. Pulsatile GnRH enhances the mRNA expression of SNAP-25 and MUNC-18 in rat pituitary and αT3-1 gonadotropes [325].

In regard to gonadotropin synthesis, several pathways are involved, although they are not mutually exclusive. GnRH was reported to activate the Ca²⁺-calmodulin kinase I and II (Ca²⁺/CaMKI/II) and CaMKII inhibition results in a decrease in αGSU and LHβ promoter activation [98,99]. Also, GnRH activation of CaMKI mediates the derepression of the FSHβ, but not the LHβ gene, via the phosphorylation of several classes IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) [162]. CaMKII has been the subject of extensive research that has identified the way in which this dodecameric enzyme is controlled by autophosphorylation and how autophosphorylation then allows the kinase to decode the frequency of Ca²⁺ oscillations [267]. In addition, CaMKII inhibitors affect the conductivity of potassium channels, leading to the depolarization of cells and facilitation of Ca²⁺ influx. Therefore, Ca²⁺ and CaMKI/II may exert feedback mechanisms ('signaling cycles') and participate in decoding GnRH pulse frequencies [70].

### 2.5. Role of protein kinase C (PKC) in GnRH receptor signaling

PKC is a serine/threonine lipid-activated kinase [232,233]. PKC is a family of at least 10 related isoforms [134,230]. PKC is involved in synaptic transmission, memory, learning, cellular growth, differentiation, transformation, metabolism, contraction, exocytosis, regulation of ion channel activity, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and gene expression (ibid). The isoforms are classified into the following major groups: conventional (cPKC-α, -βI, -βII, and -γ), novel (nPKC-δ, -ε, -θ, and -η/L) and atypical (aPKC-ζ and -ι/λ). PKC has an amino-terminal regulatory domain, consisting of the conserved regions C1 and C2, and a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain (the kinase domain). The activators Ca²⁺ and DAG bind to the regulatory domain. The regulatory domain has motifs, which mediate protein–protein interactions, and these are important in substrate recognition and localization of PKC to cellular compartments via receptors for activated C-kinase (RACKs) [62]. This domain also harbors a pseudosubstrate region that binds the catalytic domain and maintains the enzyme in an inactive state prior to the activation process. This is analogous to the role of the regulatory subunit in PKA, which maintains the enzyme in an inactive state prior to separation from the catalytic subunit brought about by the binding of cAMP. The catalytic domain has motifs involved in ATP and substrate binding. The hinge region connects the regulatory and the catalytic domains and is sensitive to proteolytic cleavage.

There are several post-translational modifications of proteins, which serve diverse functions, such as transport, membrane localization, stability, activation state and degradation. Reversible phosphorylation represents a major modification that controls the activity of some 500 mammalian protein kinases and their numerous substrates. The ABC kinases [PKA, PKB (also known as Akt) and PKC] have three conserved phosphorylation motifs: the first is found in the activation loop segment; the second is in the turn motif and the third is in the hydrophobic motif [231].

Newly formed molecules of PKC first associate in a weak manner with the plasma membrane in an 'open state', in which the pseudosubstrate does not bind to the catalytic domain. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) binds to PKC and phosphorylates a conserved threonine in the activation loop [231]. The activation loop, which resides near the entrance to the catalytic core, of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, needs to be phosphorylated for catalytic competence. PDK-1 basal activity is sufficient and the enzyme does not require further activation. PDK-1 is then released and the C-terminus inserts itself into the catalytic core and two additional sites in the turn and the hydrophobic motifs are then autophosphorylated. The pseudosubstrate region binds the catalytic domain and the 'closed form' is thus released to the cytosol. The now fully phosphorylated PKC is regarded as a 'mature form'; it is catalytically competent but inactive, since the substrates cannot approach the 'closed' catalytic domain [231]. As mentioned above, hydrolysis of PIP₂ by PLC will generate the second messengers IP₃ and DAG. Ca²⁺ mobilization by IP₃ and DAG will translocate PKC back to the membrane. The energy released by this interaction will 'open' the PKC by releasing the pseudosubstrate region and PKC then becomes fully active since substrates can now bind the catalytic core. Nevertheless, PKC is now sensitive to rapid dephosphorylation and inactivation. The molecular chaperon Hsp70 can stabilize PKC in its active form. Hsp70 binds the dephosphorylated PKC and protects it from being degraded by supporting rephosphorylation. Nevertheless, persistent activation of PKC does not enable Hsp70 to rescue the enzyme and PKC is degraded [231]. Hence, phosphorylation of PKC is constitutive, and newly synthesized molecules of PKC are fully phosphorylated, even in the absence of elevated levels of the second messengers that are required for its activation, namely Ca²⁺ and DAG.

The PKC isoforms listed above show different enzymological properties: tissue distribution, cellular localization and a different requirement for Ca²⁺, phosphatidylycerine (PS), DAG, free fatty acids and other lipid-derived mediators. Conventional PKCs (cPKC) are activated mainly by DAG (via binding to C1), Ca²⁺ (via binding to C2) and PS and are therefore regarded as Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms. Novel PKCs (nPKC) lack part of the C2, are Ca²⁺-independent and are activated by PS and DAG. Atypical PKCs (aPKC) lack the C2, and have an atypical C1, and are therefore Ca²⁺ and DAG-independent and activated by PS or some other lipid mediators. The many and some-time opposing functions of PKCs suggest that different isoforms may mediate its diverse functions.

The gonadotrope cell lines αT3-1 and LβT2 express PKCα, βII, δ, ε, θ, η, ι/λ, and ζ, that represent members from all groups of the PKC isoforms [222,170,178]. As mentioned above, rapid activation of PLCβ by GnRH may provide the Ca²⁺ and early-phase DAG needed for cPKC activation. Subsequently, the activated PLD might generate late-phase DAG that may be involved in nPKC activation in a Ca²⁺-independent manner. PS and other lipid mediators may activate aPKC. Finally, arachidonate, which is liberated by activated PLA₂, may further support selective activation of PKC isoforms in
the presence and/or the absence of other activators [219,14,6]. Thus, sequential activation of cellular phospholipases by GnRH should provide lipid-derived PKC activators in a time-dependent fashion that might be coordinated with various physiological tasks elicited by GnRH.

It was anticipated that protein phosphorylation should be positively correlated with gonadotropin secretion. Surprisingly, we found that protein dephosphorylation is also involved in GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion and have implicated the involvement of the protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, downstream of Ca²⁺ and PKC, in GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion [179]. How can phosphatases exert a positive regulatory signal to gonadotropin secretion? Gallegos et al. [78] have recently targeted COS-7 cells with a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer reporter for PKC activity for the study of the role of temporal and spatial segregation in PKC signal specificity. The probe was targeted to various cellular organelles by fusing appropriate targeting sequences to the probe. They found that the magnitude and duration of PKC signaling is location-specific and controlled differentially by phosphatase activity. Assuming that a PKC-driven phosphorylation event is involved in GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion (see below), it is likely that phosphatase activity regulates the spatio/temporal segregation of the signal during gonadotropin secretion and may therefore exert a positive regulatory signal.

GnRH stimulated PKCβ, PKCδ, and PKCε, but not PKCα mRNA levels in αT3-1 cells in a Ca²⁺- and PKC-dependent fashion [289,106]. Moreover, GnRH-stimulated PKCβ, PKCδ, and PKCε gene expression appeared to be mediated by PKC itself, indicating autoregulation of PKC gene expression (ibid). However, a more direct approach demonstrated the translocation to the membrane (a marker for PKC activation) of PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCβ by GnRH in αT3-1 cells [106,252].

With the availability of antibodies to the phosphorylated form of some PKC isoforms, it became possible to follow phosphorylated PKCs. Indeed, Maccario et al. [178] found that using anti-Thr505 and anti-Ser643, which are targeted at the trans- and auto-phosphorylated forms of PKCδ, GnRH increased the phosphorylation at both sites in a time-dependent manner in αT3-1 cells. At the same time, GnRH translocated both PKCδ and PKCε from the cytosol to the membrane (ibid), as was also observed by us [106]. Interestingly, prolonged GnRH stimulation induced down-regulation of PKCδ via the proteasome [178].

Both TPA and GnRH have been reported to induce down-regulation of PKC isoforms in gonadotrope cell lines [170,252]. It has also been shown that prolonged exposure of LβT2 cells to GnRH reduces the activation of MAPK, c-fos, and LHβ by TPA [170]. It was therefore proposed that, during prolonged GnRH stimulation, selected PKC isoforms are down-regulated. Indeed, Liu et al. [170] found that GnRH treatment resulted in the loss of PKCδ and the reduction in the expression of PKCε and PKCθ. Since PKC activation is followed by degradation, the above results are an indirect indication that GnRH activates the PKCδ, ε, and θ isoforms, in support of previous reports [178,106].

It is thought that cross talk between PKC and Ca²⁺ regulates gonadotropin secretion and mRNA expression [207,296,2]. In cultured rat pituitary cells, activation of PKC was shown to stimulate a rise in αGSU, LHβ, and FSHβ mRNA and αGSU transcription [17,321,313,100], or αGSU and LHβ transcription [95]. Also, the homologous activation of the mouse GnRHR promoter requires an AP-1 motif and mediation via PKC/MAPK/JNK, as mentioned above [234,327]. PKC may also be involved in the anti-proliferative effects of GnRH analogs in cancer cells. It was recently demonstrated that ERK activation via a PKC-dependent pathway is essential for GnRH inhibition of proliferation in ovarian cancer cells [136].

Unlike the pulses of Ca²⁺ described above, pulses of PKC have not been effective in differentially activating of the gonadotropin subunit genes [95]. As GnRH pulse frequencies determine differential gonadotropin synthesis, it therefore seems that the decoding of the GnRH pulses is executed via Ca²⁺ oscillations and PKC isoforms acting in a non-pulsatile fashion.

### 2.6. Signaling of the GnRH receptor to MAPK

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) cascades have pivotal roles during metazoan development including fate determination, differentiation, proliferation, survival, migration, growth, and apoptosis. Abnormal MAPK signaling contributes to developmental disorders and diseases such as oncogenic transformation. MAPK cascades consist of up to six tiers of protein kinases, that sequentially activate each other by phosphorylation [279,244] (Fig. 2).

Four major MAPK cascades are known in mammals: ERK1-2 (p42 and p44), JNK 1–3, p38α-δ, and ERK5 (big MAPK; BMK). A small G-protein of the Ras family (Ras, Rap1, CDC42, Rac1) activates the MAP3Ks directly or through MAP4Ks. MAP3Ks then activate MAPKKs and MAPKs. Interestingly, whereas the regulation at the level of MAP4K is via gene expression (e.g., the increase of Map4k4 mRNA levels by TNFα in adipocytes) [305], that of MAP3K and further down is maintained by phosphorylation. The ERK1/2 cascade is activated by growth factors, mitogens and various GPCRs, and consists of several candidate proteins as MAP4K (e.g., MAP4K4, KLK3, PKC), Rafs (MAP3K), MEK1/2 (MAPKK), and ERK1/2 (MAPK). It also consists of several MAPK-activating protein kinases (MAPKAPKs) such as MSK1, MNK1–2, and RSK1–4. ERK is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase with a high affinity for substrates (>100) with the consensus P-X-S/T-P sequence. Binding of MEK, RSK or some phosphatases to ERK requires a ‘docking domain’ (D), which binds to a ‘common docking’ (CD) domain in ERK. Substrate binding requires a ‘DEF’ docking [Phe/Tyr-Xaa-[Phe/Tyr]-Pro] domain, in the vicinity of the catalytic pocket [123,302,301,154]. The hallmark of the MAPK family is their ability to translocate into the nucleus to activate transcription factors [279,244]. Translocation of proteins into the nucleus requires a nuclear localization signal (NLS), while exit from the nucleus requires a nuclear export signal (NES), both of which are absent in the case of ERK. Thus, the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of ERK may be governed by other binding proteins expressing NLS and/or NES. MEK is a good candidate; having an NES, it was implicated in ERK export out of the nucleus [76,29]. It is thought that MEK1/2-ERK1/2 interaction is crucial for ERK1/2 activation and its sub-cellular distribution [42]. Initially the interaction of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 maintains the cytosolic localization of the ERKs, [42,269]. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MEK1/2 induces a conformation change releasing ERK1/2 from MEK1/2, enabling ERK1/2 to translocate into the nucleus (ibid). However, even in the nucleus MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 interact again and the complex is exported out by means of the NES of the MEKs (ibid). Still, it is not clear how ERK is translocated into the nucleus? It was recently suggested that entry of inactive ERK2 into the nucleus occurs by facilitated diffusion not requiring cytosolic transport factors and export, like import, can occur by a carrier-independent mechanism [256]. Translocation of ERK into the nucleus results in phosphorylation and activation of several transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, Elk-1, Ets, STAT, CREB, histone H3, egr-1, and others. Activation of ERK1/2 results mainly in proliferation and differentiation.

The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are now known as JNK (SAPK1) and p38 (SAPK2) and both are initiated by stress stimuli, various GPCRs, inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. The JNK cascade includes initially activation by Rac1/Cdc42 and adaptor molecules of MAP4Ks such as MAP4K4, or MAP3Ks. They in turn activate MAP kinase kinases (MKK) 4 and 7 at the level of MAPKK

and JNK1–3 at the level of MAPK. As with ERK, JNK activates several transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF-2, NF-ATcl, HSF-1, STAT3 and others which mediate stress responses and apoptosis [279,244] (Fig. 2).

The p38 cascade is also initiated by CDC42/Rac1 and adaptors leading to MAP4K, or MAP3K activation. The MAP3Ks activate MKK3/6, which then activates p38α-δ. Several MAPKAPKs such as MSK1, MK2–5 and MNK1/2 are also activated by p38α-δ. Transcription factors activated by p38 are ATF-1, ATF-2, MEF2A, Sap-1, Elk-1, NFκB, Ets-1, CHOP, p53 and others, which enable p38 to mediate stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis [279,244] (Fig. 2).

The ERK5 (BMK) cascade is activated by stress stimuli, growth factors, mitogens and various GPCRs and consists of LAD1 (at the level of Ras), WNK1 (at the level of MAP4K), MEKK2/3 (at the level of MAP3K), MEK5 (at the level of MAPKK) and ERK5. Transcription factors activated by ERK5 are MEF-2, SAP-1, Fra-1, and others and SGK1 at the level of MAPKAPKs. ERK5 (BMK) mediates stress responses and proliferation. Global gene expression reveals that out of the 17 genes uniquely regulated by ERK5, 14 genes (82%) have been previously associated with hypoxia via regulation by HIF-1 [278]. ERK8 is the last identified member of the MAPK family. It is a large MAPK, which is expressed in the brain, kidney, and lung, and its activity can be modulated by serum, c-Src, and c-Abl [1]. Very little information is available on its upstream activators, downstream effectors and cellular functions.

As MAPKs are involved in cell proliferation, activating mutations in cascade members lead to unbalanced growth and carcinogenesis [292]. About 30% of cancers have Ras mutations and mutations in K-Ras are found in some 90% of pancreatic cancers.
not find indications that GnRH transactivates the EGFR during ERK activation in $\alpha$T3-1 and L$\beta$T2 cells [25,16]. However, others have implicated the activation of MMP2 and MMP9 in EGFR transactivation by GnRH in $\alpha$T3-1 cells during ERK activation [266]. This discrepancy may reside in the conditions of cell growth and passage number of the cell line. Transactivation of the EGFR by GnRH was observed in hypothalamic GT1-7 cells. Here, activation of ERK by GnRH was mediated by PKC-dependent MMP activation and Hb-EGF release [287]. We found that the EGFR was activated by GnRH via G$_{\alpha i}$ in GnRHR-expressing COS7 cells [143]. Like LH/ hCG [240], GnRH-induced oocyte maturation in explanted rat follicles *in vitro* by transactivation of the EGFR via EGF-like factors that were released by metalloproteases in an autocrine/paracrine manner [201]. GnRH effects on metalloproteases have also been observed in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 [148]. In this case a GnRH agonist increased MMP-1, MMP-2, and TIMP-2 and decreased MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 mRNA levels (ibid).

Divergence of GnRHR signaling to ERK in a cell context-dependent manner has been recently described in HEK293 cells expressing the GnRHR [55]. GnRH was found to induce changes in cell adhesion and superstructural morphology, and the *de novo* formation of polymerized actin structures. GnRH induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and c-Src. The activation of ERK by GnRH was sensitive to cytoskeletal arrangement, interaction with c-Src and FAK and mediation via the monomeric G-protein Rac. Hence, the activation of ERK in this cell model occurs independently of the heterotrimeric G-protein-PLC$\beta$ pathway.

Various signaling complexes have been described to be associated with ERK activation by GnRH. One of them includes the GnRHR, c-Raf kinase, Ca$^{2+}$-calmodulin and ERK2 and was localized to low density membrane microdomains (lipid rafts/caveolae) [225,23,264]. Another was described in HEK293 cells stably expressing the GnRHR and was dependent on c-Src interaction with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), leading to ERK activation in a PLC$\beta$-independent manner [56]. The third implicated the calcium-dependent proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) as a scaffold for a focal adhesion/cytoskeleton-dependent complex formation comprised of c-Src, Grb2, and mSOS that translocated an ERK-activating signal into the nucleus in L$\beta$T2 cells [185].

JNK activation by GnRH in $\alpha$T3-1 cells is mediated by PKC, c-Src, CDC42/Rac1, and MEKK1 [158]. Others have reported that JNK activation is PKC-independent, and unlike ERK, is mediated via Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization, but not Ca$^{2+}$ influx [204,203]. Still others have reported that JNK activation in L$\beta$T2 cells does not involve PKC, Ca$^{2+}$ influx or Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization [338]. JNK activation in GnRHR-expressing COS7 cells required transactivation of EGFR, followed by activation of c-Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) [143]. The different cell systems used may explain the conflicting results. Activation of p38MAPK by GnRH is PKC-dependent [263].

As GnRH exerts direct effects on sex hormone-dependent cancers, we also explored the MAPK activation pathways in the human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU-145. GnRH activation of ERK in DU-145 cells, involved c-Src and EGFR transactivation [144]. JNK activation was mediated by c-Src and MLK3, but not by PKC or EGFR. In addition we implicated JNK as the main mediator of the apoptotic effect of GnRH analogs in DU-145 cells (ibid). Others have implicated p38 [184], or ERK and p38 [136] in the anti-proliferative effects of GnRH analogs in sex hormone-dependent cancers. Hence, the participation of various members of the MAPK super-family in the anti-proliferative effects of GnRH analogs in some cancers seems to be cell context-dependent.

Growing evidence suggests additional pathways for MAPK activation, which are G-protein-independent. Following their role in desensitization, $\beta$-arrestins become adaptors for signaling molecules such as c-Src, Ras, ERK1/2, JNK3, and MKK4 and could therefore participate in MAPK activation [155]. Furthermore, G-protein-
dependent and -independent activation of MAPK can be elicited by the same ligand. Sustained vs. transient activation of ERK has previously been shown to play an important role in signal specificity [181,90,91]. Still, the fate of the activated ERK may differ between the modes of its activation. G-protein-dependent ERK activation results in its translocation into the nucleus and subsequent participation in transcriptional regulation [248]. On the other hand, activation of ERK by the $\beta$-arrestin-dependent pathway confines ERK to the cytosol and may lead to activation of cytosolic substrates [307,268]. Caunt et al. [35] have compared ERK activation by the human GnRHR (hGnRHR; no C-tail and slow internalization) and Xenopus GnRHR (XGnRHR; having a C-tail and rapid internalization). Although, the two receptors differ in the rate and extent of receptor desensitization and internalization, both mediate a similar time course of GnRH-stimulated ERK activation, thus suggesting that desensitization and internalization do not participate in ERK activation. Interestingly, hGnRHR activated ERK more efficiently than XGnRHR, but was less efficient in translocating ERK to the nucleus. Since the hGnRHR activates ERK in a $\beta$-arrestin independent manner [35], other mechanisms may participate in determining the fate of the activated ERK.

One such mechanism may be the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 and 2 (MKP-1 and MKP-2), which are dual-specificity phosphatases that inactivate MAPK by dephosphorylation. GnRH induces MKP-2 expression in clonal $\alpha$T3-1 and primary gonadotropes [345]. Egr-1 may be the key factor in mediating GnRH-dependent transcriptional activation of MKP-2 [345]. One mechanism of MKP-2 protein expression requires ERK and JNK, but not p38 activation, and the second pathway is independent of MAPK activation and requires mobilization of Ca$^{2+}$ [346]. *In vivo* gene profiling demonstrated that both MKP-1 and MKP-2 are induced by GnRH with distinct temporal profiles [344]. Indeed, overexpression of MKP-2 was correlated with inhibition of MAPK activity. Activation of MKPs may terminate the MAPK activity and hence may represent another negative feedback mechanism ('signaling cycle') during the intermittent pulses of GnRH, as discussed above.

If both growth factor receptors and various GPCRs utilize MAPK cascades, how is signal specificity maintained? It is possible that different signaling components, such as isoforms of MAPK cascade members, are expressed and assembled in a cell-specific manner, giving rise to different combinations and hence to specific responses [265]. Different kinetics such as transient vs. sustained activation of MAPK may also result in different responses [181,82]. In PC12 cells, NGF induces sustained ERK activation, resulting in differentiation, whereas EGF stimulates a transient ERK response leading to proliferation [181,340]. Transient vs. sustained activation of ERK may be determined by receptor density, the scaffold protein involved (see below), the extracellular matrix and the ratio between the kinases and phosphatases involved [205]. ERK translocation into the nucleus will activate transcription factors phosphorylation (e.g., Ets, STAT3, CREB, histone H3), which results in the induction of immediate early genes (e.g., c-Fos). It was proposed that, during transient activation of ERK, the immediate early gene responses in the nucleus are relatively short, due to their degradation in the proteasome. However, sustained activation would preserve the activation of the immediate early genes for several hours (ibid). The half-life of the immediate early gene responses may then dictate specificity. It was also proposed that the ratio between the activation of the various MAPK cascades (ERK, JNK, and p38) may dictate signal specificity [46]. Different scaffold molecules may bring together different MAPK family members to gain specificity [247,177]. A signaling platform for ERK activation by GnRH was reported to include the GnRHR, c-Raf kinase, and Ca$^{2+}$-calmodulin, and to localize to low density membrane microdomains (rafts) [225,23,264]. Activation of ERKin HEK293 cells stably expressing the GnRHR was dependent on its protein–protein interaction with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and c-Src at focal adhesion complexes [56]. Compartmentalization of the activation process may also lead to signal specificity [221,261]. Microtubules and actin filaments restrict cAMP formation by regulating the localization and interaction of GPCR-Gs-Adenylyl cyclase (AC) in lipid rafts/caveolae [112]. In addition to its role in GPCR desensitization, arrestin serves as an escort for signaling molecules, such as Src and various components of the MAPK cascades [36,37,320]. However, no role for arrestin as a scaffold in GnRH signaling to ERK has yet been found, since GnRHI does not have a C-tail, whose phosphorylation serves as the binding site for arrestin during desensitization (ibid). Signal specificity may also be obtained by the mechanism of MAPK activation. p38 may be activated via the classical cascade as above, or via autophosphorylation, or via the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated protein kinase-binding protein 1 (TAB1) [128]. It was recently proposed that p38 signaling may differ according to its activation route [7]. It is likely that the various mechanisms mentioned above are operating alone, or in combination in different cellular systems leading to a large diversity of signaling responses [223,90,288].

Interaction of the GnRHR with different G-proteins may explain the diversity of signaling mechanisms leading to MAPK activation in the various target cells. Still, we cannot rule out the possibility that different mechanisms for MAPK activation by GnRH exist, even in pituitary gonadotropes [16,266,55], and that they complement or compensate each other, suggesting some degree of redundancy in the activation mechanisms.

‘Systems biology’ approaches have been taken to study frequency-dependent gene expression in the gonadotropes. Computer simulations revealed that different frequencies of GnRH pulses were synchronized with the relative activation of one, two or all three of the MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38) (P. Melamed, personal communication). Indeed, distinct patterns of ERK activation were found to be regulated by GnRH pulse frequencies *in vitro* [127]. Thus, GnRH pulses may be decoded via differential activation of MAPKs forming a combinatorial network for differential signaling.

### 2.7. MAPK is involved in GnRH regulation of gonadotropin subunit gene expression

The asynchronous phased secretion of LH and FSH in response to GnRH during the female reproductive cycle is a central dogma of reproduction, the mechanism of which remains unresolved. This differential secretion is associated with differential regulation of the gonadotropin subunit gene expression by gonadal steroids and peptides, but this is still not clear [28,50,84]. Changes in the frequency of GnRH pulses [92], or in the density of GnRHR, have also been implicated in the differential response [126]. MAPKs are ideal candidates to participate in the transcriptional machinery. Furthermore, the half-life of the transcription factors may also be involved in the formation of feedback loops (‘signaling cycles’) and the decoding of GnRH pulse frequencies (see below).

The role of PKC/Ca²⁺/MAPK in gonadotropin subunit gene expression is controversial. PKC and ERK were implicated in GnRH-induced αGSU expression [321,74], but not LHβ, which is mediated by Ca²⁺ [321]. Similarly, a role for PKC, ERK, and JNK, but not p38, in GnRH-regulation of the αGSU, has been demonstrated [336,263]. We have further reported a role for Ca²⁺, ERK, and c-Src, but not for JNK, in the transcriptional regulation of αGSU by GnRH in αT3-1 cells [108]. Others have claimed that Ca²⁺ is involved in αGSU activation, while PKC and ERK mediate the effect of GnRH on LHβ [273,32]. Another report found a role for JNK, but not for PKC and ERK in GnRH regulation of LHβ [338]. We have implicated PKC, ERK, and JNK, but not Ca²⁺, in LHβ gene expression by

GnRH in LβT2 cells [107]. Similarly, GnRH regulation of the FSHβ gene in LβT2 cells appears to involve PKC, ERK, JNK, p38, and c-Src but not Ca²⁺ [25]. These opposing results may be due to different cell types, promoters, species, and cell culture conditions.

How do the various MAPKs regulate the transcriptional responses to GnRH? We and others have shown that GnRH induces ERK translocation into the nucleus [108,25,168,36]. The JNK and ERK cascades might then operate via the activation of c-Jun and c-Fos, respectively, acting on AP-1 sites within the gonadotropin subunit promoters as in the case of FSHβ [25,119,49]. As for LH, c-Jun has been implicated in GnRH activation of the LHβ promoter [338]; while c-Fos derived from GnRH activation of ERK1/2 appears to stimulate the induction of the LHβ protein. In addition, c-Jun and ATF-2, which are known substrates of JNK, have been shown to bind to the CRE domain of the human αGSU promoter [113]. Similarly, PKC, ERK, and JNK have recently been shown to modulate the expression of ATF-3, which binds and activates the dual CREs of the human αGSU promoter [336]. The Ets family of transcription factors, such as Elk1, which are implicated in mediating transcriptional responses to the activation of the ERK cascade, has been shown to be involved in activation of the mouse αGSU promoter by GnRH via ERK [262]. It has recently been shown that Pyk2 can act as a scaffold for a focal adhesion/cytoskeleton-dependent complex comprised of c-Src, Grb2, and mSos that is involved in ERK translocation into the nucleus in LβT2 cells [185]. Once activated, the site of ERK action was mapped to the early growth response-1 (Egr-1) DNA binding sites within the LHβ-subunit promoter, which is also activated by p38MAPK, but not by JNK (ibid). Interestingly, the proximal promoters of LHβ genes in lower vertebrates lack an Egr-1 response element but are responsive to GnRH. In various types of fish, the LHβ promoter contains a conserved estrogen response element-like sequence, which is required for the GnRH effect and for a response to c-Jun [193]. Mediation by c-Jun of the GnRH effect on the LHβ gene may be common in lower vertebrates and may have preceded an evolutionary divergence in the cis-regulatory elements that led to its function being replaced in mammals by Egr-1 (ibid). It is therefore tempting to suggest that MAPK/JNK activation of c-Jun is involved in LHβ gene activation in lower vertebrates.

The role of MAPK in mediating the frequency-dependent effects of GnRH was investigated in perfused LβT2 cells [127]. First it was shown that stimulation of LβT2 cells with varying GnRH pulse frequencies resulted in differential stimulation of LHβ and FSHβ gene transcription [12] similar to previous observations in primary gonadotropes [96]. Distinct patterns of ERK activation/inactivation were then found to be regulated by GnRH pulse frequency, and this difference in ERK activation may be important for GnRH pulse frequency-dependent differential stimulation of LHβ and FSHβ gene expression [127]. The likely candidates to decode GnRH pulses are the dual MAPK phosphatases, MKP1/2 that are up-regulated by GnRH [262] and can therefore form a feedback loop (‘signaling cycle’). It is thus important to demonstrate further that variations in MAPK activation by GnRH pulses are linked to differential activation of the gonadotropin subunit genes. Indeed, using this *in vitro* approach and microarray analysis 1127 genes were activated by tonic or pulsatile GnRH [151]. Of major interest was the observation that Egr1 and Egr2, which are implicated in LHβ transcription, were induced at high pulse frequency. On the other hand, the Egr corepressor genes Ngfi-A binding protein Nab1 and Nab2 are stably induced at low pulse frequency. Thus, the pulse frequency may be decoded also by selective gene expression of activators and repressors of the gonadotropin subunit genes.

Gene expression is also regulated by chromatin modification that is manifested through post-transcription modification of histones by phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination [202,194]. It was recently shown that GnRH overcomes
HDAC-mediated repression of the gonadotropin beta-subunit genes in immature gonadotropes [162]. Activation of CaMKI seems to play a role in the derepression of FSHβ, but not the LHβ gene. HDAC-mediated repression of LHβ and FSHβ genes may explain the temporal shut-down of reproductive function after birth and their derepression by GnRH at puberty (ibid).

### 2.8. Cross talk between GnRH and prostanoid receptors

In vivo, cells are exposed to numerous stimuli, which simultaneously activate multiple signaling pathways that may potentially cross talk and affect the net biological outcome. A case in point are pituitary gonadotropes, which are simultaneously exposed to multiple inputs in the form of GnRH, neurotransmitters, melatonin, pituitary hormones, growth factors, and gonadal steroid and peptide hormones [67]. In linear signal transduction studies, the mechanism of hormone action is studied by introducing the hormone to target cells and analyzing the downstream events. In integrative signal transduction studies, which will better mimic the in vivo situation, one would stimulate the cell by the multiple ligands known to affect its fate. However, since some of the ligands interact with the target cell in a pulsatile fashion, this approach will require a sophisticated way of delivering multiple ligands in different pulses. One way to overcome these difficulties is by simultaneous activation of the cell by the main ligand of interest, together with effector molecules, which serve as second messengers for the other interacting ligands and which do not oscillate even during pulsatile stimulation by the receptor ligands. In addition, the effector molecules may contribute to downstream pathways shared by GPCRs and RTKs. We have recently proposed that eicosanoids may represent an ideal model for downstream effector molecules, since they are activated by both GPCRs and RTKs [224]. Eicosanoids are metabolites of arachidonic acid, which are involved in the regulation of reproduction, cancer, and the inflammatory, neuronal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and immune systems [109,199]. We have previously shown that GnRH stimulates arachidonic acid release from cultured rat pituitary cells [210] followed by an elevated expression of 12-lipoxygenase and the formation of 5-lipoxygenase products, which participate in GnRH actions [312,52,290,17,166]. We therefore decided to study the cross talk between the GnRH and the prostanoid receptors as a first step in elucidating the ‘integrative signaling map’ of the gonadotrope cell. We first demonstrated that GnRH stimulates PGE₂, PGF₂α, and PGI₂ synthesis through the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression mediated by the PKC/c-Src/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/MAPK pathway in LβT2 cells [224]. We then demonstrated that PGF₂α and PGI₂, but not PGE₂ reduces GnRHR gene expression by inhibiting GnRH-induced phosphoinositide turnover. Furthermore, PGF₂α, but not PGI₂ or PGE₂, reduced GnRH-stimulated LHβ gene transcription, but not αGSU, or FSHβ. As the expression of the various prostanoid receptors in pituitary cells was not known, we decided to characterize the expression pattern of the prostanoid receptors in pituitary slices and co-localize them with pituitary hormones. The PGE₂ receptor EP1 and EP2 were expressed in rat gonadotropes, while EP3 was found in mammotropes and EP4 in somatotropes. The PGF₂α and the PGI₂ receptors, FP, and IP, respectively, were expressed in rat gonadotropes (ibid). To find out the biological role of the newly produced prostaglandins (PGs), we decided first to inhibit their production. When we preincubated rat pituitaries with the general cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, we found that the drug enhanced GnRH-stimulated LH, but not FSH release. Thus, endogenous PGs seem to have an inhibitory effect on stimulated LH release. Further proof was obtained when we preincubated rat pituitaries with the PGs and later stimulated the glands with GnRH. PGF₂α, but not PGI₂ or PGE₂, inhibited GnRH-induced LH, but not FSH secretion (ibid).

Thus, a novel inside-out signaling pathway exists, mediated by PGF₂α-FP and PGI₂-IP, which acts through an autocrine/paracrine modality to limit autoregulation of the GnRHR and differentially inhibit LH release. Since, the asynchronous secretion of gonadotrope LH and FSH under the control of GnRH is crucial for ovarian cyclicity, while the underlying mechanism is not fully resolved; we propose that GnRH and prostanoid receptor cross talk may provide such a mechanism. Potential clinical applications may be the use of combination therapies of GnRH and prostanoid analogs, or GnRH analogs and prostanoid receptor agonists and/or antagonists to treat infertility, diseases with unbalanced LH and FSH secretion and in sex hormone-dependent diseases such as prostatic cancer (ibid). It will be interesting to find out if the above PGs are also produced by the neurotransmitters, melatonin, pituitary hormones, growth factors, and gonadal steroid and peptide hormones, all of which are known to bind and activate pituitary gonadotropes [67]. In such a case we may be able to reconstitute an integrative interaction map for the gonadotropes.

### 2.9. Desensitization of the gonadotropes

Gonadotrope responsiveness is dependent on the pulsatile nature of hypothalamic GnRH. Continuous exposure of the pituitary to GnRH results in desensitization of gonadotropin secretion [13,216,323,324,189]. This homologous desensitization should result in the reduction in gonadotropin and gonadal steroid levels, also known as chemical castration. Thus, the wide use of stable and long-acting GnRH analogs in the treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers, such as prostate, ovary and breast cancer, as well as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and precocious puberty.

Signal termination, receptor desensitization and re-sensitization and down-regulation are regulated processes mediated by interaction of GPCRs with intracellular proteins and underwent internalization and trafficking of activated GPCRs [61,176,249]. Phosphorylation of GPCRs by GPCR-specific kinases (GRKs), PKA or PKC at specific phosphorylation sites along the C-terminal tail and/or the intracellular loop 3 facilitates the binding of β-arrestin. β-Arrestin binding induces uncoupling from the G-proteins and, hence, desensitization of the receptors [189]. The bound receptors are then internalized via components of the clathrin endocytic apparatus, culminating in receptors that are recycled to the cell surface or degraded. Signal termination of GPCRs is also induced by members of the RGS family that modulate G-protein activity. RGS interacts with active Gα-subunits to accelerate their intrinsic GTPase activity and to limit their half-life [20]. RGS2, RGS3, and RGS10 have been implicated in the regulation of GnRHR activity [227,34]. GnRHR is unique among mammalian GPCRs in that it lacks a C-terminal tail. Indeed, mammalian GnRHR do not undergo agonist-dependent phosphorylation and rapid desensitization. However, chimeras of the rat GnRHR with the C-terminal tail of either the catfish GnRHR or the rat TRH receptor undergo agonist-dependent phosphorylation and desensitize [329]. As regards internalization, the rat GnRHR internalizes in an arrestin-independent, clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner [316,114]. The human GnRHR was reported to internalize in a dynamin-independent manner, whereas the Xenopus type I GnRHR (having a C-tail) internalizes in a dynamin-dependent manner. Both utilize a clathrin-dependent pathway [116]. Mammalian GnRHR undergo slow, constitutive, agonist-independent internalization [243]. It is possible that the lack of rapid receptor desensitization in the case of the GnRHR enables the formation of the LH surge needed for ovulation (ibid).

Nevertheless, gonadotropin secretion is still reduced during prolonged occupation of the GnRHR, indicating that events downstream to the receptor are in a refractory state. Studies have shown
that, while GnRH-stimulated PLC activity does not undergo rapid desensitization, sustained GnRH treatment of αT3-1 cells resulted in substantial loss of GnRH-stimulated InsP formation, a decrease in the number of GnRHR, and reduction in Ca²⁺ levels, PLD activity and arachidonic acid release [252,189,192,330,81,188]. Desensitization of GnRHR signaling is associated with decreased GnRHR and Gα/₁₁ levels in αT3-1 cells. Also, chronic activation of Gαq, by expression of a constitutively active Gαq induced a state of GnRH resistance [169] that was associated with reduced expression of PLCβ1, PKCδ, and PKCε [171]. It has also been shown that prolonged exposure of LβT2 cells to GnRH reduces the activation of MAPK, c-fos, and LHβ by TPA [170]. It was proposed that, during prolonged GnRH stimulation, selected PKC isoforms are down-regulated. Indeed, GnRH treatment resulted in the reduction in the expression of PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCθ [170]. Hence, the collective studies have shown that the refractory state of the gonadotropes in the face of a continuous GnRH challenge can be explained by ‘down-regulation’ of downstream signaling, rather than by desensitization of the receptor itself. Nevertheless, we assume that, under physiological-relevant GnRH pulses, rapid recovery of downstream signaling molecules should enable the GnRHR to respond to a new incoming pulse. Alternatively, the short duration of GnRH pulses (~5 min) may not be sufficient to trigger desensitization of downstream signaling molecules.

Rat type I GnRHR responds better to GnRHI as compared to GnRHII [319]. A motif (Ser-Glu-Pro; SEP) in ECL3 may mediate this ligand selectivity, since replacement of the SEP with PEV (Pro-Glu-Val) reversed ligand selectivity and efficacy (ibid). HEK 293 cells transfected with the rat GnRHR showed different rates of InsP formation after challenge by both GnRHI and GnRHII [294]. GnRHII desensitized the receptor faster than GnRH I in terms of Ca²⁺ responses, while the opposite result was obtained with the PEV mutant (ibid). It was thus suggested that the SEP motif could mediate ligand-selective receptor desensitization. In the case of the GnRHR, we contemplated that the ICLs may substitute for the C-terminal tail to evoke signal termination [285]. We found that the GnRHR harbors an inhibitory domain within the ICL2, and that Ser153 plays a key role in this domain in a phosphorylation-independent fashion. We assume that inhibitory-binding partners interact with this site, and are responsible for the inhibition of receptor activity. Desensitization of GnRHR signaling has apparently evolved to avoid premature ovulation and to reduce circulating levels of steroids. The large repertoire of mechanisms underlying desensitization of GPCRs in general and of the GnRHR in particular might have been evolved for greater robustness of physiological processes during the reproductive cycle.

### 3. Future perspectives

GnRH induces ‘life’ at the pituitary level (gonadotropins/sex steroids/ovulation and spermatogenesis) and ‘death’ (apoptosis) in prostate cancer cells [145]. How the same GnRH type I receptor (GnRHR) mediates ‘life-and-death’ decisions is a fascinating question. Initially it was thought that, while type I GnRHR mediates the pituitary actions of GnRH, Type II GnRHR mediates the effects in cancer cells [196]. Later, the recognition that type II GnRHR is not expressed in many species, including humans, gave rise to the proposal that Gαq and Gα₁ mediate the pituitary and cancer cells actions of GnRH type I receptor, respectively (ibid). However, since Gαq and Gα₁ have both been implicated in GnRHR coupling to pituitary gonadotropes [110,295], it seems therefore that the mechanism is more complex. GnRH ligands (GnRHI and GnRHII, agonists and antagonists of GnRH type I receptor) may bind selected active conformations of the receptor that are stabilized by receptor-mediated intracellular complexes, the nature of which may differ in a ‘cell context’-dependent manner [196]. The

complexes may also dictate the nature of the signaling (‘ligand-induced selective signaling’ or LISS, (ibid)). However, the observations that the MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) mediate the pituitary actions of GnRH [60] and that the same MAPKs also mediate the apoptotic and the anti-proliferative actions of GnRH in cancer cells [144,184,145,135] points to the additional complexity of LISS. It thus seems that divergent signaling may be further found in more distal targets, such as MAPK substrates. We therefore suggest that GnRH-induced selective signaling should be investigated at the level of PKC/MAPK substrates, culminating in the activation of specific genes in various GnRH target cells and elicitation of specific biological end-points in a cell-specific manner.

Aside from the pituitary, GnRHRs have been found (mRNA and/or protein) in the hypothalamus, brain, placenta, endometrium, myometrium, decidua, ovary, breast/mammary gland, testis, sperm, prostate, lymphocytes, T cells, mononuclear blood cells, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal, heart, skeletal muscle, submaxillary gland, gastric parietal cells, spinal chord, retina and various cancer cells and cell lines [103]. Since hypothalamic GnRH does not reach the extra-pituitary sites, it is thought that GnRH or a GnRH-like material could be produced in the target cells, analogous to prostate cancer where production of GnRH has been found [255,163,9]. GnRH might then act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion by binding to local GnRHRs. Only in some target cells a biological response has been suggested, while in most others, the biological role of the presence of the GnRHR is not yet known [103]. Nevertheless, it is expected that divergent GnRH signaling based on the intracellular milieu, selective PKC/MAPK substrates, and activation of specific genes in the various GnRH target cells should culminate in specific and divergent biological responses.

Wurmbach et al. [334] studied the genes that are rapidly regulated by GnRH in LβT2 cells. The biosynthetic rate of the induced genes was correlated with the concentration of GnRH [342]. Interestingly, the regulated genes were all activated at 1 h and returned to basal levels at 3 h. These genes included: signaling molecules such as Rgs2, MKP1, PRL1 (Ptp4a1), and IkBα; cytoskeletal proteins such as γ-actin, β-actin and transgellin; channel regulators such as Gem; transcription factors such as LRG21 (ATF3), EGR1, EGR2, TSC22, c-jun, c-fos, FosB, Per1, Klf4, Klf7, Nrf2, Ier2 (Pip92), Nr4a1 and general proteins such as gly96, NMDMC, and HSP30. GnRH also stimulated MKP2 [345], ATF3 [336], diacylglycerol kinaseζ (DGK-ζ) [55] and inhibits the expression of mRNA encoding the 60S acidic ribosomal phosphoproteins, P1 and P2 [39]. Since some of these genes are activators, while others are inhibitors, it was suggested that their activation forms a ‘combinatorial code’ to direct the activity of downstream secondary genes. Factors such as activin A, that are known to regulate the biological activity of GnRH, also modulate the gene networks activated by GnRH [187].

How do the various second messengers mentioned above participate and mediate the differential regulation of gonadotropin subunit gene expression by GnRH? We envisage that the MAPK members cross talk with Ca²⁺ and PKC to elicit differential gonadotropin subunit gene expression. Indeed, we can observe differential signaling to αGSU, but not for LHβ and FSHβ. Nevertheless, we and others have identified the messenger molecules involved in the transcriptional activation of the gonadotropin subunit genes by GnRH, namely: Ca²⁺, PKC, ERK, JNK, p38, and c-Src. The identified messengers may serve as nodes in potential ‘interaction maps’ of the GnRHR. Krakauer et al. [141] carried out the analysis of the computational modules required for frequency-decoding in the signal transduction network of the gonadotropes. Since the pulse frequency dictates the biological end-point, they proposed that gonadotropes compute by exploiting the variation in the time scales of protein phosphorylation, dephosphorylation and gene expression. Information transfer in the gonadotrope forms a connectivity map, which is based on feed-forward and feed-back
loops, and depends on a robust signaling module that integrates molecular events at different time scales [270]. Hence, the connectivity map should offer rhythmic sub-cellular signaling pathways capable of decoding the pulses of GnRH and mediating a process of differential gonadotropin release and synthesis [70]. Cells decode frequency based signaling networks consisting of circuit modules, based on protein–protein interaction networks, which operate in temporal, spatial and combinatorial inputs to discriminate selective signals [270]. Because of the complexity of signaling networks, high-throughput technologies are being developed to map the interaction maps [11]. To obtain a global view of signaling, genome-wide RNAi screens are used to identify novel components of known signal transduction pathways [53]. Such an approach has recently identified 331 regulators for the RTK/ERK pathway in Drosophila [75]. However, the current interaction maps, which are mainly based on protein–protein and enzyme–substrate interactions, suffer from the fact that they do not take into account kinetic parameters (affinities, rate constants, etc.). Hence, the current interaction maps reveal the players but not the rate or the order of interactions of its partners. New high-throughput technologies such as quantitative proteomics and time-resolved mass spectrometry are now emerging, and will enable mining of data in a quantitative manner, adding a kinetic dimension to signaling networks [22,348]. Network topology may also govern cell fate [272]. Reverse engineering using modular response analysis

(MRA) [132] was used to re-evaluate the classical experiment of Marshall [181], demonstrating differential activation of ERK by EGF and NGF in PC-12 cells. Upon EGF stimulation of PC-12 cells, the network exhibited negative feedback alone, whereas a positive feedback was found upon NGF stimulation [272]. NGF stimulation allows for bi-stable ERK activation dynamics as revealed by MRA analysis. The authors concluded that growth factor context determines the topology of the MAPK signaling network and the resulting dynamics govern cell fate (ibid). The combinatorial pathways comprising the network may be compared to a piano concerto. The pianist plays the keys in a combinatorial manner, where he increases and decreases the pace and the intensity. A network, written in analogy to a piano concerto is therefore required. Formation and interpretation of interaction maps should use insight from engineering theory, since they resemble modular architectures (e.g., bow-ties) that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feed-forward and feedback regulations. GPCR signaling should be studied as a bow-tie-configured network at the systems level [43]. Indeed, this is the task of the emerging field of ‘Systems Biology’ [51].

Variation in GnRH pulse frequency [30,12] may alter the density of GnRHR and generate a set of selective interaction networks, which activate the transcriptome to elicit differential gonadotropin release and synthesis. We propose that Ca²⁺, PKC, ERK, JNK, p38, and c-Src play a key role (Fig. 3) as major nodes in the interaction

network maps. The key nodes interact with the GnRHR and with other signaling proteins, apparently in a combinatorial manner to form a dynamic interaction circuit, which is then capable of executing a specific biological task. Based on the above, we therefore suggest that different signaling networks operate in pituitary and cancer cells. In the pituitary they culminate in differential gonadotropin synthesis and secretion and maintenance of the gonadotropic phenotype. In cancer cells they induce inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Hence, the biological end-point of the activated MAPK by the single GnRHR may differ in pituitary gonadotropes vs. cancer cells by virtue of the activation of different downstream substrates and target genes. We therefore propose that combinatorial signaling [222] is the key event in interaction network maps. Construction of the connectivity maps is crucial for the understanding of molecular mechanisms, which mediate the cyclical responsiveness of pituitary gonadotropes and the asynchronous gonadotropin synthesis and release during the reproductive cycle. The interaction network maps will enable further exploration of the pituitary and the extra-pituitary effects of GnRH and will open a new vista for the design of novel and combined therapies for fertility regulation and sex hormone-dependent diseases and cancers.
