# New insights into the pathogenesis of renal tubular acidosis – from functional to molecular studies

Received: 10 February 2000 / Revised: 7 April 2000 / Accepted: 7 April 2000

**Abstract** The diagnosis and classification of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) have traditionally been made on the basis of functional studies. On these grounds, RTA has been separated into three main categories: (1) proximal RTA, or type 2; (2) distal RTA, or type 1; and (3) hyperkalemic RTA, or type 4. In recent years significant advances have been made in our understanding of the subcellular mechanisms involved in renal bicarbonate ($\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ transport. Application of molecular biology techniques has also opened a completely new perspective to the understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited cases of RTA. Mutations in the gene $SLC4A4$, encoding $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ cotransporter (NBC-1), have been found in proximal RTA with ocular abnormalities; in the gene $SLC4A1$, encoding $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ exchanger (AE1), in autosomal dominant distal RTA; in the gene $ATP6B1$, encoding B1 subunit of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-ATPase, in autosomal recessive distal RTA with sensorineural deafness; and in the gene $CA2$, encoding carbonic anhydrase II, in autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. Syndromes of aldosterone resistance have been also characterized molecularly and mutations in the gene $MLR$, encoding mineralocorticoid receptor, and in the genes $SNCC1A$, $SNCC1B$, and $SCNN1G$, encoding subunits of the epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channel, have been found in dominant and recessive forms of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, respectively. It can be concluded that, although functional studies are still necessary, a new molecular era in the understanding of disorders of renal acidification has arrived.

## Introduction

To date classification of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) has been exclusively based on clinical and functional studies. On these grounds RTA has been separated into three main categories: (1) proximal RTA, or type 2; (2) distal RTA, or type 1; and (3) hyperkalemic RTA, or type 4 [1, 2, 3]. In the past few years the rapidly expanding knowledge about the molecular abnormalities involved in the disturbed bicarbonate ($\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ transport in these patients has opened a completely new perspective for the understanding of the pathophysiology of this entity. Although RTA may occur in a number of etiologies, both inherited and acquired, in this review we shall limit comments to the molecular biology of the primary forms of RTA (Table 1).

## Physiology of renal acidification

Renal acid-base homeostasis may be broadly divided into two processes: (1) reabsorption of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, which occurs fundamentally in the proximal convoluted tubule, and (2) excretion of fixed acids through the titration of urinary buffers and the excretion of ammonium, which takes place primarily in the distal nephron.

### Proximal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ reabsorption

The mechanisms for proximal reabsorption of about 80%–90% of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ are shown in Fig. 1 [4]. The foremost processes occurring in this segment are $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion at the luminal membrane via a specific $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{H}^{+}$ exchanger (NHE-3) and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ transport at the basolat-

Both CA II and CA IV are markedly stimulated during chronic metabolic acidosis.

A substantial fraction of proximal HCO₃⁻ reabsorption is mediated by vacuolar H⁺-ATPase, thus mutations of genes encoding the protein subunits of this transporter might lead to proximal RTA. However, it is possible that proximal HCO₃⁻ reabsorption through Na⁺-H⁺ exchange may fully compensate for defective H⁺-mediated reabsorption. Also, about 20% of filtered HCO₃⁻ is reabsorbed by passive back-diffusion along the paracellular pathway.

A second major function of the proximal tubule cell is ammonia (NH₃) formation from glutamine, a reaction which is rate-limited by the enzymes glutaminase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Chronic acidosis up-regulates the activity of both enzymes.

In recent years important advances have been made concerning the molecular biology of these transporters and enzymes. Na⁺-H⁺ exchangers (NHE) belong to a common family of transport proteins and perform electroneutral 1:1 exchange of Na⁺ and H⁺ [5]. To date, five isoforms of NHE have been cloned in mammals [6, 7]. They share a similar predicted structure with approximately 800 amino acids and 12 transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic termini (Fig. 2). The carboxy-terminal half of the protein is mainly regulatory in function and contains phosphorylation sites that are targets for protein kinases, and domains that bind to various regulatory cofactors [8]. NHE-1 and NHE-3 are the principal isoforms involved in renal function. NHE-1 is ubiquitous and is immunolocalized at the basolateral membrane. NHE-3 is kidney specific and is apically localized in proximal tubule and TALH cells. The human NHE-3 gene (SLC9A3) is encoded at 5p15.3 [9].

There are three Na⁺-HCO₃⁻ cotransporters (NBC-1, -2, and -3) belonging to a superfamily of HCO₃⁻ trans-

been described [12, 13]. In the kidney more than 95% of CA activity is located in the cytosol and is attributable to CA II. It is primarily found in proximal tubular cells and in intercalated cells of the cortical and outer medullary collecting tubules [14]. Membrane-bound CA IV represents approximately 5% of total kidney CA activity and although it is mainly localized at the apical side of proximal and medullary tubular cells, its presence in the basolateral membrane has been also demonstrated. The human CA II gene (CA2) maps to 8q22, whereas the human CA IV gene (CA4) maps to 17q23 [15]. A low pH is required for bone resorption, hence CA II is also expressed in osteoclasts, where it generates protons for a specific vacuolar H+-ATPase [16].

Proximal HCO₃⁻ reabsorption is influenced by luminal HCO₃⁻ concentration and flow rate, extracellular fluid volume, peritubular HCO₃⁻ concentration and PCO₂, Cl⁻, K⁺, Ca²⁺, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, α-adrenergic tone, and angiotensin II [17].

### Distal urinary acidification

Urinary acidification takes place in the distal nephron by three related processes: (1) reclamation of the small fraction of filtered HCO₃⁻ that escapes reabsorption proximally (10%–20%); (2) titration of divalent basic phosphate (HPO₄²⁻), which is converted to the monovalent acid form (H₂PO₄⁻) or titrable acid; and (3) accumulation of NH₃ intraluminally, which buffers H⁺ to form non-diffusible ammonium (NH₄⁺).

The thick ascending limb of loop of Henle reabsorbs about 15% of the filtered HCO₃⁻ load by a mechanism similar to that present in the proximal tubule, i.e., through Na⁺-H⁺ apical exchange. It also participates in NH₃ transport. Absorption of NH₄⁺ in the apical membrane of the loop of Henle occurs by substitution for K⁺ both in the Na⁺ K⁺ 2Cl⁻ cotransport system and in the K⁺-H⁺ antiport system. The medullary thick ascending limb has a low permeability to NH₃, limiting back-diffusion. A NH₄⁺ medullary concentration gradient is generated and amplified by countercurrent multiplication through NH₄⁺ secretion into the proximal tubule and possibly into the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle. The accumulation of NH₃ in the medullary interstitium increases the driving force for diffusional entry of NH₃ into the collecting tubule, a process facilitated by the high acidity of the tubular fluid at this level. Abnormalities in this complex process of NH₃/NH₄⁺ synthesis and transport may lead to impaired distal urinary acidification.

Distal urinary acidification occurs mainly in the collecting tubules [18]. In the cortical collecting tubule, the intercalated cells are involved in both H⁺ and HCO₃⁻ secretion, while the principal cells are in charge of Na⁺ reabsorption and K⁺ secretion. There are two populations of intercalated cells that differ both functionally and structurally. The α-cell is responsible for H⁺ secretion, and the β-cell is responsible for HCO₃⁻ secretion.

cellular mechanisms involved in distal acidification are shown in Fig. 4. The main pump for luminal H⁺ secretion in the α-type intercalated cell is a vacuolar H⁺-ATPase, but it is also highly influenced by the luminal electronegativity caused by active Na⁺ transport taking place in the principal cells. A second ATPase, the H⁺, K⁺-ATPase, is also involved in H⁺ secretion, but its physiological role is probably more related to K⁺ than to acid-base homeostasis. Intracellularly formed HCO₃⁻ leaves the cell by an electroneutral mechanism involving Cl⁻-HCO₃⁻ exchange, facilitated by an anion exchanger (AE1 or band 3 protein).

H⁺ secretion proceeds in the outer medullary collecting tubule, which is a unique segment that does not reabsorb Na⁺ or secrete K⁺ and whose only function is the transport of H⁺ [19]. The medullary collecting tubule is lumen positive and H⁺ must be secreted against the electrochemical gradient via an electronegenic, Na⁺-independent process modulated by the vacuolar H⁺-ATPase. H⁺ secretion is not inhibited by agents that block Na⁺ transport, but is influenced by aldosterone, through a mechanism which is independent of Na⁺ delivery or reabsorption. The terminal part, the inner medullary collecting duct, also plays an important role in distal acidification [20]. The cellular process involved in mediating H⁺ secretion appears to be similar to the process described in α-intercalated cells, but its importance in overall renal H⁺ secretion remains to be determined. All segments of the collecting tubule are very rich in cytosolic carbonic anhydrase II, but membrane-bound, luminal carbonic anhydrase IV is also present in both outer and inner segments of the medullary collecting duct. The luminal CA IV seems to play an important role for HCO₃⁻ absorption in this segment [21].

The vacuolar H⁺-ATPase (V-ATPase) is one of the most-fundamental enzymes in nature [22]. It functions in almost every eukaryotic cell and energizes a wide variety of organelles and membranes. Its primary function is ATP-dependent proton transfer. V-ATPases have similar structure and mechanism of action as F-ATPases, but these latter enzymes are confined to mitochondria, and the primary function is to form ATP at the expense of the proton-motif force. The structure of vacuolar H⁺-ATPases has been mainly elucidated in yeast [23, 24]. Genetic screening has led to the identification of 14 genes encoding subunits of the enzyme complex. Several additional genes have been identified that encode proteins that are not part of the final V-ATPase complex yet are required for its assembly. The complex is organized into two major domains, V0 and V1 (Fig. 5). The intracellular, catalytic V1 segment is formed by three A subunits and three B subunits. There are two isoforms (B1 and B2), encoded by different genes (ATP6B1 and ATP6B2) and showing different patterns of expression. The B2 isoform is widely distributed while the B1 isoform has been exclusively detected in α-intercalated cells of the distal nephron, placenta, and inner ear [25]. The human ATP6B1 gene is located at 2p13 and contains 14 exons.

The H⁺, K⁺-ATPases comprise a group of integral membrane proteins that belong to the P cation-transporting ATPases [26]. The other important member of this family is Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase. Both consist of two transmembrane subunits, the larger of which (catalytic α-subunit) has ten domains and exchanges K⁺ against intracellular Na⁺ or H⁺, at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. The β-subunit seems to be necessary for the correct packing and stable membrane insertion of the α-subunit [27] (Fig. 6). Differences in the functional properties and adaptability of the H⁺, K⁺-ATPases in different tissues can partly be explained by the existence of isoforms of the enzyme components. The isoforms of the α-subunit (HKα) were initially specified according to their original tissue origin, gastric or colonic. Recently, there is agreement that the HKα subunits should be assigned according to their order of discovery: HKα1 (gastric), HKα2 (colonic), HKα3, and HKα4. The ATP4A and ATP1AL1 genes code for HKα1 and HKα2, respectively. The human ATP1AL1 gene, formed by 23 exons, has been

It is formed by two transmembrane subunits, the larger of which (catalytic subunit α) has 10 domains and exchanges K⁺ against intracellular H⁺, at the expense of ATP hydrolysis.

cloned [28]. At least three different pumps containing the HKα1, HKα2, and HKα3 subunits have been detected in rabbit kidney. The HKβ protein associates with HKα1 in gastric tissue, but in the kidney the main role seems to be played by HKα2-HKβ isoforms [29]. Future work should elucidate the activity and pharmacological properties of different H⁺, K⁺-ATPases, depending on the presence of HKα2 variants and the interaction with different HKβ subunits.

Anion exchangers (AE) interchange Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ at cell membranes and belong to a superfamily of transporters which also includes Na⁺-HCO₃⁻ and K⁺-HCO₃⁻ cotransporters [30]. There are three isoforms: AE1, AE2, and AE3. The red cell AE1, or band 3 protein, contributes to cytoskeletal structure and is important for the respiratory function by interchanging Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ at red cell membranes. In the kidney, AE1 interchanges anions at basolateral membranes of α type intercalated cells of cortical and medullary collecting ducts [31]. AE2 is also expressed in the kidney, especially in medullary thick ascending limb [32]. AE3 is mainly expressed in cardiac muscle and brain. AE1 has 911 amino acids and it was formerly believed that it was made up of 14 transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic termini. Recent studies, however, have shown that human AE1 of erythrocyte membranes is composed of 13 typical transmembrane segments, while the region Asp⁸⁰⁷-His⁸³⁴ is membrane embedded but does not have the usual α-helical conformation [33] (Fig. 7). The AE1 gene (SLC4A1) is located at 17q21–22 and the AE2 gene (SLC4A2) has been localized to 7q35-36.

Distal urinary acidification is influenced by blood pH and PCO₂, distal Na⁺ transport and transepithelial potential difference, aldosterone, and K⁺. Aldosterone influences distal acidification through several mechanisms (Fig. 8). Firstly it enhances Na⁺ transport in the late distal and cortical collecting tubules, and thereby increases the lumen-negative potential difference across epithelium, so favoring both H⁺ and K⁺ secretion. This action is early mediated by activation of pre-existing epithelial

Fig. 8 Schematic representation of aldosterone action in distal and cortical collecting tubules. Once aldosterone is bound to the mineralocorticoid receptor, it penetrates into the nucleus and activates specific genes. The result is stimulation of Na⁺ entry and both H⁺ and K⁺ exit at the luminal membrane, and of K⁺ entry and Na⁺ exit at the basolateral membrane

Na⁺ channels (ENaC) and pumps (Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase), and subsequently mediated by increasing the overall transport capacity of the renal tubular cells [34]. Aldosterone seems to be responsible for the specific localization of the ENaC in the apical membrane of principal cells of distal and cortical collecting tubules [35]. Both early regulatory and late anabolic-type actions depend on the transcriptional regulation exerted by hormone-activated mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). However, the regulatory pathways that link the transcriptional action of aldosterone to these Na⁺ transport proteins are still largely unknown [36]. In addition to the genomic action of aldosterone, rapid effects involving second messengers, such as calcium and cAMP, have been also observed in knockout mice lacking the MR [37].

Aldosterone also enhances H⁺-ATPase activity in cortical and medullary collecting tubules, an effect that is independent of plasma K⁺ levels. However, the stimulation of H⁺, K⁺-ATPase, which is also observed in aldosterone excess, depends predominantly on the stimulus exerted by accompanying hypokalemia [38]. 3) Aldosterone also affects NH₄⁺ excretion by increasing NH₃ synthesis, both as a direct action and as a consequence of simultaneous changes in K⁺ homeostasis [39].

The MR is a protein of 984 amino acids belonging to the superfamily of steroid receptors. It contains an immunogenic domain, a zinc finger DNA-binding domain, and a hormone-binding domain. Unlike the glucocorticoid receptor, which is almost ubiquitous, MR expression is restricted to specific cells of kidney distal and collecting tubules, colonic epithelium, and sweat and salivary gland ducts. In all these epithelia aldosterone stimulates Na⁺ reabsorption [40]. The structure of the gene encoding the human MR (MLR) has been elucidated. It is formed by nine exons and is located at 4q31.1 [41]. Two different isoforms have been identified. Each isoform is expressed at an approximately equivalent level in kidney, colon, and sweat glands [42].

The epithelial Na⁺ channel (ENaC) is formed by three subunit proteins (α, β, and γ), having short cytosolic termini, two transmembrane domains, and a large extracellular loop [43]. The α-subunit appears to be required for the assembly or function of the whole complex. The three ENaC subunits are homologous to each other and have about 35% amino acid identity. There is a possible membrane topology of the heterotetrameric complex formed by 2 α, 1 β, and 1 γ subunits, since this complex maintains a high amiloride sensitivity and a very Na⁺ selective pore [44] (Fig. 9). The ENaC is not only present in the kidney but also in other organs such as lung, colon, exocrine glands, skin, and hair follicle. Both genes encoding the β– (SNCC1B) and γ-subunits (SNCC1G) are located in 16p12, while the gene encoding the α-subunit (SNCC1A) is located in 12p13 [45].

Ontogeny of renal acidification

It is well known that during early postnatal life there is a maturation increase in proximal tubular reabsorption of HCO₃⁻ [46]. The immaturity of this process is still more apparent in preterm newborn infants [47]. Classic functional studies in puppies and rabbits have shown that the rate of reabsorption in neonatal proximal tubules is approximately one-third of that observed in mature segments, and that normalization only occurs after a period of several weeks [48, 49]. Recent investigations have shown that several transporters and enzymes involved in HCO₃⁻ transport are insufficiently expressed during the early neonatal period. The functioning of apical NHE-3, either studied as Na⁺-H⁺ antiporter activity in microvillus membrane vesicles prepared from cortex of fetal and newborn lambs [50] or as expression of NHE-3 mRNA in cortex from neonatal rabbits [51, 52], is clearly impaired. NBC-1 activity at the basolateral membrane is also decreased in neonatal rabbits, but this activity is relatively more mature than the NHE-3 activity at the apical membrane [53]. Maturation of CA II and CA IV activities may also play an important role, since these enzymes are insufficiently expressed during the first 2 weeks of life in rat and rabbit kidneys, respectively [54, 55]. The maturation increase of proximal tubular reabsorption of HCO₃⁻ takes place pari passu with parallel increases in proximal tubular basolateral surface area and Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase activity [56, 57, 58].

It is of great interest that administration of glucocorticoids accelerates the maturation of both Na⁺-H⁺ antiporter activity [59] and expression of NHE-3 mRNA [51, 52]. These experimental findings have an important human correlate because administration of prenatal steroids is also associated with earlier maturation of glomerular filtration rate and tubular Na⁺ reabsorption [60, 61].

The process of distal tubular acidification appears to mature earlier than proximal tubular transport. In fact, the ability to excrete an acid load is not different in infancy than later in life [46]. Premature infants, however, do present an inability to acidify the urine as a consequence of insufficient ammoniagenesis [62, 63]. Glutamine uptake, NH₃ production, and excretion into the tubular fluid are lower in neonatal rats after an acid load [64].

There are few molecular biology studies related to ontogeny of distal H⁺ transport. They show that the various transporters involved are all expressed in post-S-shape stages, suggesting that microanatomical differentiation of the developing distal nephron to some degree precedes the tubular expression of specific transport-related gene product [65]. It should be noted that intercalated cells are fully developed in the fetal rat kidney and that the entire population of these cells present in the medullary collecting duct are eliminated, by programmed cell death, during the development of the collecting duct [66]. However, in the cortical collecting duct of the rabbit, intercalated cells are reduced in number and are also functionally immature. They undergo postnatal proliferation and maturation to attain adult function several weeks postnatally [67].

It is well known that, in contrast to term newborn infants, preterm newborn infants born before 35 weeks of gestational age present an obligatory Na⁺ loss despite

very elevated plasma levels of renin and aldosterone. This situation is especially observed in the context of high water intake and is caused by deficient proximal and distal tubular Na⁺ reabsorption [68].

The various proteins implicated in the function of aldosterone target cells, such as MR and ENaC, are already fully expressed in the terminal part of the nephron and the collecting duct [69]. The aldosterone unresponsiveness present during development may be therefore related to a low density of mineralocorticoid receptors and apical epithelial Na⁺ channels [70, 71].

### Proximal RTA (type 2)

Proximal RTA (type 2) is caused by an impairment of HCO₃⁻ reabsorption in the proximal tubule and is characterized by a decreased renal HCO₃⁻ threshold. Distal acidification mechanisms are intact and when plasma HCO₃⁻ concentration diminishes to sufficiently low levels these patients may lower urine pH below 5.5 and excrete adequate amounts of NH₄⁺. In children, proximal RTA is most frequently observed in the Fanconi syndrome, but it may also occur as a primary or inherited entity.

### Autosomal dominant proximal RTA

This form has been exclusively described in nine members of a Costa Rican family by Brenes et al. [72]. The age of the patients varied between 2 and 27 years and clinical signs were limited to the presence of growth retardation. The presence of the disorder in several generations suggested an autosomal dominant transmission. Molecular biology studies have not yet been reported in this family, but one may speculate about a possible candidate gene, such as SLC9A3, encoding the NHE-3 transporter.

A mouse model in which the gene SLC9A3 has been abated using gene targeting strategies has been developed [73]. These knock-out mice lack NHE-3 activity and have combined renal and intestinal absorptive defects. Microperfusion and micropuncture studies show a significant decrease in HCO₃⁻ reabsorption in the proximal tubule [74, 75]. However, the mice only exhibit a mild degree of metabolic acidosis, due to a compensatory increase in HCO₃⁻ reabsorption in more distal nephron segments [76]. Kidney expression of renin and different transporters such as NBC1, AE1, and HKα2 is increased [73]. It will be of interest to determine the clinical findings of surviving animals and specifically whether they exhibit growth retardation.

### Autosomal recessive proximal RTA with ocular abnormalities

Primary proximal RTA has also been reported as an autosomal recessive entity in association with other anomalies, such as mental retardation and ocular abnormalities [77, 78, 79]. Igarashi et al. [80] have reported molecular biology studies in two unrelated girls, of 22 and 11 years of age, presenting with short stature, mental retardation, bilateral glaucoma, cataracts, band keratopathy, and permanent isolated proximal RTA. Both girls had homozygous missense mutations (Arg298Ser in patient 1, Arg510His in patient 2) in the gene SLC4A4, encoding NBC-1. These findings are of great interest since they are the first showing that loss-of-function mutations of SLC4A4 may cause permanent primary proximal RTA with ocular abnormalities.

The involvement of the corneal epithelium may be explained by the fact that it transports fluids, Na⁺, and HCO₃⁻ out of the corneal stroma into the aqueous humor to maintain corneal transparency. The function of NBC-1 in this process is of great importance and NBC1 is highly expressed in corneal epithelium [81]. In mutated patients, the increase in HCO₃⁻ concentration in the corneal stroma may facilitate calcium deposition and development of band keratopathy.

---

### Sporadic isolated proximal RTA

A non-familial and transient type of isolated proximal RTA has been described in infancy [82, 83]. Affected individuals present with an isolated defect in renal and intestinal HCO₃⁻ absorption, without any identifiable cause or evidence of other abnormality. The presenting symptoms are growth retardation and persistent vomiting in early infancy. Alkali therapy induces a rapid increase in growth and can be discontinued after several years without reappearance of symptoms. The transient nature of this entity suggests the persistence beyond the neonatal period of a decreased HCO₃⁻ threshold, possibly as a continued immaturity of NHE-3 function.

---

### Distal RTA (type 1)

This type of RTA is caused by impaired distal acidification and is characterized by the inability to lower urine pH maximally (below 5.5) under the stimulus of systemic acidemia. The impaired excretion of NH₄⁺ is secondary to this defect. Distal RTA is almost always observed in children as a primary entity inherited in both autosomal dominant and recessive patterns. In adults, distal RTA is generally acquired and is often seen in the context of an immune-mediated disease. Prominent clinical features include impairment of growth, polyuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, lithiasis, and K⁺ depletion. Progression of nephrocalcinosis may lead to the develop-
ment of chronic renal failure. If detected early in life, therapeutic correction of the acidosis by continuous alkali administration may induce resumption of normal growth, arrest of nephrocalcinosis, and preservation of renal function.

**Autosomal dominant distal RTA**

In a few reported families the presence of the disorder in several generations suggests an autosomal dominant transmission [84, 85]. Although clinical findings are not different from those observed in autosomal recessive or sporadic cases, in these patients the disease may be diagnosed later or manifest with milder symptomatology. Autosomal dominant distal RTA has been found to be associated in several kindreds with mutations in the SLC4A1 gene encoding the CI-/HCO₃⁻ exchanger AEI [86, 87, 88]. Neither morphological abnormalities nor increased fragility are present in the erythrocytes, in contrast with an autosomal recessive AEI nonsense mutation found in cattle which is associated with systemic acidosis, severe anemia, and red cell fragility [89].

The abnormalities described in patients with autosomal dominant distal RTA mostly include missense mutations in codon Arg589 (Arg589His, Arg589Ser, Arg589Cys) found in various unrelated families, the Ser613Phe and Gly1766Ala mutations found in two families, and an 11-amino acid deletion at the carboxy terminus found in another family [86, 87, 88]. One of our patients presented a de novo Arg589His mutation [88]. The frequent involvement of codon Arg589 indicates the critical importance of this residue in the normal acidification process. Arg589 lies at the intracellular border of the sixth transmembrane domain of the protein, adjacent to Lys590. These basic residues are conserved in all the known vertebrate exchanger isoforms and may form part of the site of intracellular anion binding.

The few mutations described in distal RTA contrast with the great number of AEI mutations present in red cell diseases such as hereditary spherocytosis and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, where more than 20 different missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations have been described [90]. A remarkable fact is that these hereditary red cell disorders are not generally associated with distal RTA. Administration of an acid load to ten patients from seven unrelated families with hereditary spherocytosis and AEI deficiency revealed that uniquely two patients from one family had an acidification defect [91]. Also, the presence of distal RTA in hereditary ovalocytosis [92] or elliptocytosis [93, 94] has been only exceptionally described.

How can one explain either the absence of red cell abnormalities in patients with distal RTA or the rarity of defects in distal urinary acidification in patients with hematological disorders, when in both circumstances mutations in the same SLC4A1 gene are present? Functional analysis of the Arg589His mutation has revealed only a modest reduction in AEI-mediated ³⁶Cl⁻ transport when

expressed in Xenopus oocytes or of sulfate transport in patients' red cells [86]. It is therefore possible that this and other AEI mutations do not lead to defective distal acidification through a loss-of-function of the protein but through an intracellular misrouting. Lack of insertion of AEI exchanger into the basolateral membrane or erroneous insertion into the apical membrane would interfere with H⁺ secretion. The finding of high urine PCO₂ values in an adult patient with distal RTA and ovalocytosis favors the possibility that α-type intercalated cells secrete HCO₃⁻ instead of H⁺ due to the erroneous presence of AEI in the apical membrane [92]. This hypothesis is also supported by the findings in two affected siblings with a homozygous, loss-of-function mutation, Gly701Asp [95]. AEI-Gly701Asp loss-of-function was accompanied by impaired trafficking to the Xenopus oocyte surface. Glycophorin A rescued both AEI-mediated Cl⁻ transport and AEI surface expression in oocytes. In conclusion, normal erythroid anion transport may be present when the AEI mutation leads to disrupted intracellular trafficking rather than to significant loss-of-function of AEI. Conversely, in hematological disorders due to AEI mutations, remaining function of the exchanger in the heterozygous carriers may be insufficient to preserve the integrity of red cell membranes but sufficient to maintain, with a few exceptions, normal distal H⁺ secretion.

**Autosomal recessive distal RTA with sensorineural deafness**

An important fraction of cases of sporadic or autosomal recessive distal RTA develop sensorineural deafness. This association was first noted by Royer and Broyer in 1967 [96], and to date some 50 cases have been described [97]. Clinical findings, other than deafness, are identical to those present in patients with sporadic or autosomal recessive distal RTA and normal hearing. There is great variation in the presentation of deafness, from birth to late childhood, it is progressive and does not ameliorate after alkali therapy.

Karet et al. [98] have recently demonstrated that most patients with distal RTA and nerve deafness have mutations in the gene ATP6B1 encoding the B1-subunit of H⁺-ATPase. These represent the first genetic abnormalities described in autosomal recessive distal RTA (rdRTA). They found 15 different mutations in 20 patients belonging to 15 kindreds. The nonsense mutation, Ala31Stop, was found in three unrelated patients, frame-shift mutations were identified in 4 patients, and 7 different missense mutations were identified in 9 patients. Finally, mutations altering the highly conserved splice donor (GT) or splice acceptor (CAG) sequences were identified in 4 patients. The mutations were distributed across the ATP6B1 gene and not clustered in the protein structure, suggesting that alterations in many parts of this highly conserved molecule may result in loss of function.The absence of ATP6B1 mutations in nine kindreds with distal RTA and deafness indicates at least one additional locus [98]. An unknown gene may be also involved in the pathogenesis of a novel disorder described in two siblings with progressive central nervous system calcification, nerve deafness, microcytic anemia, and renal tubular acidosis, and in whom carbonic anhydrase II was normal [99].

The findings reported by Karet et al. [98] open new insights into the pathogenesis of hearing impairment. They demonstrated that ATP6B1 mRNA was expressed in fetal and adult human cochlea. Also, immunohistochemical studies using a polyclonal antibody specific for the carboxy terminus of the B1-subunit showed high-intensity staining in the interdental cell layer of the cochlear spiral limbus and in the epithelial cells of the endolymphatic sac of neonatal mice. The interdental and endolymphatic sac cells have both H+-ATPase and Cl--HCO₃⁻ exchanger, and closely resemble the α-type intercalated cell [100]. A normal acid-secreting capacity of these cells is necessary to maintain a low endolymph pH and a normal auditory function. Therefore, it is highly probable that mutations leading to alkalinization of the endolymph will also result in impaired hearing function.

### Autosomal recessive distal RTA with normal hearing

Karet et al. [101] have reported the results of genetic analysis of thirteen kindred with autosomal recessive distal RTA and normal hearing. Other than the difference in hearing status there was no significant differences in clinical or biochemical findings related to distal RTA. In all kindreds, the involvement of the ATP6B1 gene could be excluded. In nine kindreds, the disease could be linked to the segment 7q33-34 (rdRTA2). However, in four kindreds there was no evidence for such linkage, thus implying the existence of at least one additional distal RTA locus.

Karet et al. [101] speculate about the identity of this new gene, given the fact that no candidate genes are currently known to lie in the linked interval. They believe that the rdRTA2 gene encodes a subunit of H+-ATPase. Considering the normality of hearing function, one could anticipate that only genes encoding specific renal isoforms of H+-ATPase subunits would be implicated. Mutations in the SLC4A2 gene, encoding AE2, were excluded. Although this gene is also present in chromosome 7, its locus is telomeric to that of rdRTA2. A defective H+-K+-ATPase function at the apical surface of α-type intercalated cells has been previously proposed as a potential mechanism of disease [102], but this possibility remains highly theoretical since this transporter is more implicated in K⁺ than in H⁺ homeostasis [103].

Nevertheless, deficient H⁺-K⁺-ATPase function secondary to vanadium toxicity may be the cause of the environmental hypokalemic distal RTA present in northeastern Thailand [104].

### Combined proximal and distal RTA (type 3)

In some patients the delineation between proximal and distal RTA is difficult to establish because they share features of both forms. In these cases there is a striking reduction in tubular reclamation of filtered HCO₃⁻, but in contrast to a situation of pure proximal dRTA, there is also an inability to acidify the urine maximally despite severe degrees of systemic acidemia.

---

### Primary distal RTA with HCO₃⁻ wasting

The pattern of combined proximal and distal RTA may be observed as a transient phenomenon in infants and young children with primary distal RTA, and does not represent a different genetic entity [105, 106, 107]. Most cases were observed during the 1960s and 1970s, may be in relation to some exogenous factor such as a high salt intake. It should be noted that this pattern of hereditary distal RTA has almost disappeared over the past 2 decades.

### CA II deficiency

CA II deficiency is the primary defect in the autosomal recessive syndrome of osteopetrosis, renal tubular acidosis, cerebral calcification, and mental retardation [108]. To date more than 50 cases have been reported worldwide. However, the majority of patients come from North Africa and the Middle East, with nearly 75% being of Arabic descent.

Most of the Mediterranean and Arab patients are homozygous for the so-called Arabic mutation, i.e., a unique splice junction mutation at the boundary of exon 2/intron 2 [109, 110, 111]. Despite the presence of the same mutation there is a great inter-/intra-familial phenotypic variability. In Arab patients, severe mental retardation and metabolic acidosis are prominent, while bone fractures are less frequent. In patients of different ethnic origin other mutations are important, including single-base deletion [112], missense mutations [113, 114], and a different splice junction mutation [115].

All clinical findings may be explained as secondary to CA II deficiency in different organs and systems. Renal functional studies show the presence of impaired renal reabsorption of HCO₃⁻, failure to achieve maximally low urine pH, decreased NH₄⁺ excretion, low urine-to-blood PCO₂ difference in alkaline urine, and a high urinary citrate level, all indicative of the coexistence of proximal and distal RTA [116]. Osteopetrosis may be readily explained by the failure of osteoclasts to secrete acid to dissolve bone mineral [117]. In this process both normal activities of CA II and a specific vacuolar H⁺-ATPase are required [16, 118]. Mice with a targeted deletion of exons 2–5 of the Atp6i gene, encoding a specific bone H⁺-ATPase, also exhibit severe osteopetrosis [119]. However,er, not all mutant animals with osteopetrosis evidence abnormalities in osteoclastic acid secretion and there are at least four osteopetrotic mutations in the rat showing normal osteoclastic CA II and H+-ATPase functions [120]. CA II is present in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and its deficiency may delay brain maturation and result in mental retardation and cerebral calcification [121].

The development of mutant mice (CAR2<sup>n</sup>) exhibiting a loss-of-function point mutation in the CA2 gene has been of great help in studying the pathogenesis of CA II deficiency. This mutant mouse is generated by exposure to N-ethyl-nitrosourea and transmission of the mutation to the progeny [122]. The most-interesting study performed in this mouse has been the correction of the acidification defect by gene therapy. Lai et al. [123] performed retrograde injection into the intrarenal pelvic system of cationic liposome-complexed plasmid containing human CA II cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus early promoter. Expression of CA2 mRNA was highest by day 3 after treatment, but remained undetectable after 1 month. After gene therapy CA II-deficient mice had restored ability to acidify the urine, but this ability was progressively lost by 6 weeks. This study represents the first successful gene therapy of a genetic renal disease and opens a completely new way for treating other hereditary renal tubular disorders.

## Hyperkalemic RTA (type 4)

Hyperkalemic RTA (type 4) accompanies a large number of hyperkalemic states: the acidification defect is mainly caused by impaired renal ammoniagenesis. It is characterized by a normal ability to acidify the urine after an acid load, but net acid excretion remains subnormal due to a very low rate of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> excretion. Although the decrease in NH<sub>3</sub> production is mainly caused by hyperkalemia itself, aldosterone deficiency or resistance may also play important contributory roles [124]. Hyperkalemic RTA of hereditary origin is most frequently observed in children with primary pseudohypoaldosteronism.

## Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1

Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a hereditary condition characterized by salt wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. Since its first description by Check and Perry in 1958 [125], many cases have been reported. In recent years, it has become clear that PHA1 is a heterogeneous syndrome that includes at least two clinically and genetically distinct entities with either renal or multiple target organ defects [126].

The autosomal dominant renal form represents the most frequently encountered form of PHA1. These patients present with salt wasting, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia, but do not have pulmonary, sweat glands, or any other organ involvement. Clinical features are extremely variable, from severe neonatal sodium loss and menacing hyperkalemia to lack of symptoms throughout life [127]. Although the primary defect persists forever, improvement may occur beyond 1 or 2 years of age, due to maturation of proximal tubular transport, development of salt appetite, and improvement in the renal tubular response to mineralocorticoids [128].

The pathogenesis of renal PHA1 has been greatly clarified with the identification of heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene in one sporadic and four dominant kindreds with this disease [129]. The mutations found included two frameshift mutations, which resulted in deletion of a single base pair in exon 2, one premature stop codon in exon 2 at codon 537, and a single pair deletion in the intron 5 splice donor site. In two patients no mutations in the MRL gene could be demonstrated, indicating either the existence of other mutations in additional genes or the implication of non-genetic factors.

The observation that many adult gene carriers have elevated aldosterone levels but no history of clinical disease raises the possibility that only a fraction of such carriers develop clinically evident disease [130]. The reasons for the phenotype differences are unknown, but may be related to intercurrent volume-depleting events or to dietary habits of salt ingestion.

The coexistence of polymorphisms or mutations in the gene encoding ENaC could also play a potential contributory role. Polymorphisms and mutations which lead to either loss-of-function or gain-of-function of the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel may aggravate or attenuate, respectively, the consequences of deficient mineralocorticoid receptor function [131, 132, 133].

Mineralocorticoid receptor-deficient mice have been generated by gene targeting technology [134]. These MRL knock-out mice develop symptoms of pseudohypoaldosteronism soon after birth, which can be compensated by abundant sodium chloride administration [135]. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is greatly stimulated with maximal expression of renin mRNA in kidney and adrenal gland [136].

A few kindreds have been reported with PHA1 due to multiple target organ resistance (kidney, colon, sweat and salivary glands) since its original description [137]. This variant is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, with uniform expression. The parents of affected children are asymptomatic and evidence normal plasma aldosterone levels. This autosomal recessive form presents with more-severe salt wasting and has a poorer outcome than the renal form. Patients manifest salt wasting episodes early after birth, and death may ensue during the neonatal period. Sweat and salivary electrolytes are markedly elevated. The high incidence of lower respiratory tract involvement may contribute to the confusion with cystic fibrosis [138, 139].

It has recently been demonstrated that this entity is caused by loss-of-function mutations of genes encodingone of the three constitutive subunits (α, β, and γ) of the ENaC. Conversely, Liddle syndrome is caused by gain-of-function mutations of only the genes encoding the subunits β and γ of the ENaC [140]. In the recessive form, homozygous mutations have been identified in all three ENaC subunits and include frameshift, missense, and premature stop codons [141, 142, 143, 144]. Critical hot spots for loss-of-function mutations seem to be the cysteine-rich domains in the large extracellular loop of the proteins [145].

Multiple target organ PHA1 is due to defective Na⁺ transport in many organs containing the ENaC: kidney, lung, colon, and exocrine glands. Insights into pathogenesis have been facilitated by the development of transgenic mouse models in which expression of the α, β, or γ subunits of ENaC has been abated. Interestingly, only the αENaC-deficient mice have marked failure to clear the fetal lung fluid that leads to early neonatal death [146]. If the mice are "rescued" from death by the engineered expression of the α-subunit gene in the lung, they develop a full-blown picture of pseudohypoaldosteronism, with salt wasting and hyperkalemia [147]. The βENaC- and γENaC-deficient mice do not die of neonatal respiratory failure and develop from birth a very severe picture of neonatal salt wasting and hyperkalemia, similar to human PHA1 [148, 149, 150].

The neonatal lung findings present in αENaC-deficient mice are only exceptionally observed in humans [151], despite impressive truncations of the α-subunit in some kindreds. Bonny et al. [143] tried to explain this discrepancy by demonstrating that the tetrameric structure of ENaC (αβαγ), although formed in humans by two mutated α-subunits, maintains a low but sufficient Na⁺ transport activity to absorb the fetal pulmonary fluid. However, some impairment in Na⁺ transport across airway epithelia may persist throughout life. In fact, pulmonary symptoms in patients with autosomal recessive PHA1 are not always related to infection and may be secondary, especially in young patients, to failure to absorb liquid from airway surfaces [144, 152]. The defect in Na⁺ transport can be demonstrated by measurement of transepithelial voltage across the nasal epithelium [153].

### Early childhood hyperkalemia

A transient syndrome of hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, without clinical salt wasting, has been described in infancy. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion were consistently normal or elevated [154, 155]. This entity has been called “early-childhood” hyperkalemia and represents a variant of the renal form of PHA1 probably due to a maturation disorder in the number or function of mineralocorticoid receptors. This hypothesis, however, remains highly speculative because it does not explain the absence of salt wasting.

### Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (Gordon syndrome)

An autosomal dominant syndrome of arterial hypertension, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and suppressed plasma renin activity was characterized as a new clinical entity by Gordon et al. in 1970 [156]. Less than 50 cases with so-called Gordon syndrome have been reported in the literature [157]. Hypertension represents a feature limited to adolescent or adult individuals. A similar condition has been reported in children with short stature, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis but with normal blood pressure (Spitzer-Weinstein syndrome) [158, 159]. The name of “chloride-shunt” syndrome has been also proposed, according to the hypothesis that the primary abnormality is a tubular hyper-reabsorption of sodium chloride in the thick ascending loop of Henle or early distal tubule that leads to impaired K⁺ and H⁺ secretion in cortical collecting duct as a consequence of a voltage-shunting defect [160].

The genetic defect persists unknown. Linkage analysis in eight affected families showing autosomal dominant transmission demonstrated locus heterogeneity of the trait with involvement of chromosomes 1q31–42 and 17p11-q21 [161]. Therefore, gain-of-function mutations at the genes encoding bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter and chloride channel ClC-Kb can be readily excluded. An attractive hypothesis is that the syndrome results from gain-of-function mutations of a carrier protein governing sodium chloride passage across the paracellular tight junctions of the thick ascending loop of Henle. However, the existence of such a carrier protein remains to be proved.

### Future perspectives

Molecular biology studies have opened completely new insights into the pathogenesis of RTA. At present only a few genes controlling renal H⁺, HCO₃⁻, and Na⁺ transport have been implicated, but soon other candidate genes will surely join the spectrum of genetic causes of primary RTA. However, “loss-of-function” resulting from observed mutations has been experimentally demonstrated in only a few cases. Over the next few years functional studies with the mutant genes expressed in a heterologous system such as the Xenopus oocyte will be necessary to demonstrate the functional consequences of specific mutations. Also, molecular studies will also help to better understand cases of secondary RTA. Immunohistochemical techniques using mono- or polyclonal antibodies against specific renal transporters have already been used to clarify the pathogenesis of distal RTA associated with immune-mediated diseases such as thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis, and Sjögren syndrome [162, 163]. Direct study in renal tissue of gene expression of such transporters will soon ensue. Unfortunately, these molecular studies do not offer any obvious
advantage with regard to therapy, since gene transfer in the kidney is only expected to be clinically available in the distant future, and be initially oriented to more-common renal disorders, such as transplantation, polycystic disease or cancer [164]. Fortunately, the therapeutic needs of most patients with primary RTA are easily covered with alkali therapy. Nevertheless, application of gene therapy to generalized disorders such as CA II deficiency or autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 remains a prospect for the future.

**Initiation of hemodialysis treatment leads to improvement of T-cell activation in patients with end-stage renal disease**

Am J Kidney Dis (2000) 35:611–616

Patients with chronic renal failure show an immunodeficiency characterized by frequent infectious complications and a low response to vaccinations. This is paralleled in vitro by a low T-cell proliferation on mitogenic stimuli because of an impaired costimulation by accessory cells. Furthermore, alterations of the cytokine profile are correlated with impaired immune function. The immune system is influenced by both uremia and renal replacement therapy. To evaluate the influence of hemodialysis on immune parameters, we studied patients before and after the initiation of chronic hemodialysis therapy. Fourteen patients with end-stage renal failure were tested before dialysis initiation and during the first 6 weeks of hemodialysis treatment. We determined the in vitro T-cell proliferation, as well as plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the release of IL-6 and IL-10 into culture supernatant post-stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. After 6 weeks of intermittent hemodialysis, in vitro T-cell proliferation on stimulation improved significantly (stimulation index, 21.6 +/− 18.5 versus 58.1 +/− 45.5; P < 0.01). This improvement occurred regardless of whether synthetic dialyzers or cellulose membranes were used for the initiation of dialysis. Plasma IL-6 levels, as well as IL-6 and IL-10 secretion, did not change during the study period. In patients with end-stage renal disease, the initiation of hemodialysis led to a significant improvement of in vitro T-cell proliferation. This effect may have a role for an improvement of immune function in vivo. The expected normalization of IL-6 and IL-10 production may be masked by cytokine induction through hemodialysis membranes.

**Effects of potassium on blood pressure in salt-sensitive and salt-resistant black adolescents**

Hypertension (1999) 34:181–186

This study examined the effects of increasing dietary potassium on ambulatory blood pressure nondipping status (<10% decrease in blood pressure from awake to asleep) and cardiovascular reactivity in salt-sensitive and salt-resistant black adolescents. A sample of 58 normotensive (blood pressure, 101/57+/–9/4 mm Hg) black adolescents (aged 13 to 16 years) participated in a 5-day low sodium diet (50 mmol/24 h) followed by a 10-day high sodium diet (150 mmol/24 h NaCl supplement) to determine salt-sensitivity status. Participants showed a significant increase in urinary sodium excretion (24+/–19 to 224+/–65 mmol/24 h) and were identified as salt-sensitive if their mean blood pressure increase was >=5 mm Hg from the low to high sodium diet. Sixteen salt-sensitive and 42 salt-resistant subjects were then randomly assigned to either a 3-week high potassium diet (80 mmol/24 h) or usual diet control group. Urinary potassium excretion significantly increased in the treatment group (35+/–7 to 57+/–21 mmol/24 h). At baseline, a significantly greater percentage of salt-sensitive (44%) compared with salt-resistant (7%) subjects were nondippers on the basis of diastolic blood pressure classifications (P<0.04). After the dietary intervention, all of the salt-sensitive subjects in the high potassium group achieved dipper status as a result of a drop in nocturnal diastolic blood pressure (daytime, 69 versus 67 mm Hg; nighttime, 69 versus 57 mm Hg). No significant group differences in cardiovascular reactivity were observed. These results suggest that a positive relationship between dietary potassium intake and blood pressure modulation can still exist even when daytime blood pressure is unchanged by a high potassium diet.
