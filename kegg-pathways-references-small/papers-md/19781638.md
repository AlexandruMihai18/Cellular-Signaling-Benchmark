### Abstract

*Caulobacter crescentus* cell cycle progression is implemented by oscillating global transcriptional regulators that establish temporal and spatial control of modular genetic subsystems during the cell cycle. The hierarchy of this regulatory circuit is established through a combination of gene expression control and regulated proteolysis. Recent results highlight the importance of spatial organization for controlled proteolysis in *C. crescentus*.

### 1. Introduction

Because evolution favors protein stability [7,59,65], most cellular proteins are stable in growing cells under physiological conditions [33,46]. However, regulated protein degradation offers possibilities for signal input and integration that cells can use in addition to the regulatory mechanisms provided at the level of protein synthesis, activity or sequestration. By varying the levels of target proteins, proteases can serve as regulatory switches and confer speed and directionality to cellular processes. For example, continuous or controlled proteolysis in combination with timed expression can generate fluctuations in protein levels with fast up or down kinetics. This can be used by the cell to efficiently and robustly trigger transitions between different physiological or developmental programs or to stage a response to rapidly changing environmental conditions. While it has been known for some time that proteolysis contributes to the temporal control of cellular processes and to the response to external stimuli and stress factors, recent data emphasize the importance of the spatial organization of protease activity within a bacterial cell.

The goal of this paper is to review recent advances in understanding the role of controlled proteolysis in the *Caulobacter crescentus* cell cycle and development, and in deciphering the underlying regulatory mechanisms. *C. crescentus* is a dimorphic bacterium that divides asymmetrically and undergoes a characteristic morphological transition as part of its life cycle (Fig. 1). Each division produces two distinct cell types with specialized developmental programs. The sessile stalked cell (ST) has a long extension of the cell body, the stalk, at the old pole. An adhesive holdfast, located at the tip of the stalk, firmly anchors this cell type to biotic or abiotic surfaces. The newborn swarmer progeny (SW) has a polar flagellum, polar pili and a polar chemotaxis apparatus and remains motile for a defined interval before differentiating into a sessile stalked cell. This process involves the loss of the flagellar motor and chemotaxis apparatus, retraction of the pili, and the subsequent formation of the holdfast and stalk at the same pole. Pole morphogenesis is firmly rooted within the *C. crescentus* division cycle. Whereas the newborn ST cell immediately initiates a new round of chromosome replication and cell division, the motile SW cell inherits an inert chromosome and remains in the G1 phase for a defined period, the

length of which is determined by an internal cell cycle program and by environmental signals like the availability of certain nutrients. Coincident with pole morphogenesis, cells enter the S-phase and initiate DNA replication. As chromosome replication and segregation proceed, the cell grows and becomes a predivisional cell (PD), which eventually establishes its characteristic asymmetry, and, upon completion of cytokinesis (G2), produces the two specialized progeny cells.

The sequential series of morphogenetic and physiological changes during the *C.* *crecens* cell cycle are reflected in cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. Transcription of about 20% of all *C.* *crecens* genes varies throughout the cell cycle [35,42]. The observation that expression of most cell-cycle-regulated genes peaks coincident with the cellular process requiring the gene product has led to the notion of “just-in-time” transcription that may allow the cell to grow and differentiate more efficiently [35]. A proteomic analysis of the *C.* *crecens* cell cycle revealed a remarkable correlation with about 15% of the proteins detected showing a cell cycle-dependent synthesis profile [20]. More importantly, from the

roughly 5% of the proteins that were rapidly degraded within one cell cycle equivalent, more than half were also synthesized in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This suggested that a specific subset of *C.* *crecens* proteins is subject to rapid degradation and that proteolysis plays a global role in *C.* *crecens* cell cycle progression and development.

2. Protein degradation controls fluctuation of master cell cycle regulators

Progression through the *C.* *crecens* cell cycle requires the coordination of several processes including pole morphogenesis, chromosome replication and segregation, as well as cell growth and division. This is accomplished by a hierarchical regulatory machinery involving the controlled synthesis, activation, localization and degradation of several key regulators (for recent reviews see: [8,9,36]). The core of this machinery is formed by four master regulators, CtrA, GcrA, DnaA, and CcrM, which together control the expression of about 200 genes [15,22,24,34,39,48,66]. While CtrA and
DnaA are transcription factors, GcrA and CcrM influence transcription indirectly. The four regulators form an oscillatory genetic circuit that imposes the correct timing on the modular subsystems and numerous downstream targets, and through this implements cell cycle progression (Fig. 1).

CtrA is present in SW cells where it binds to the *Caulobacter* origin of replication (Cori) to silence replication initiation [49] while repressing *gcrA* transcription [22]. The CtrA regulon includes genes involved in flagellum assembly and function, pili biogenesis, holdfast synthesis, DNA methylation, chromosome replication, and cell division [34]. During the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition and also in the ST compartment of the PD cell, CtrA must be cleared from the cell to allow replication initiation to occur [16]. Replication initiation requires a concomitant increase in the DNA replication initiator protein DnaA, which at the same time activates *gcrA* transcription [15,24]. The DnaA regulon includes genes encoding replisome components, nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes, cell division proteins and the spatial organizer PodJ [24]. Upon accumulation of GcrA in S-phase, *ctrA* transcription is activated and is further stimulated by a positive feedback loop that leads to rapidly increasing levels of CtrA in late S-phase [17]. The accumulation of CtrA not only turns off *gcrA* transcription [22], but also sets the stage for the rapid accumulation of the CcrM methyl transferase towards the end of the cell cycle (Fig. 1). CcrM synchronizes the cell cycle regulation machinery with the replication status of the chromosome. This is achieved through an epigenetic mechanism that involves DNA methylation and the control of regulatory genes whose expression responds to the methylation state of their promoters. Most importantly, the accumulation of DnaA depends on the methylation state of the *dnaA* promoter region [14]. The appearance of CcrM results in remethylation of the hemi-methylated, newly replicated sister chromosomes and the induction of DnaA. Because *dnaA* is located near the Cori, its expression is downregulated immediately after replication has initiated and the replication fork has passed through this region [14]. Similarly, through chromosome methylation, CcrM contributes to the inhibition of *ctrA* transcription late in the cell cycle [52].

The accurate timing and order of appearance of the four master regulators is determined by their interdependent expression control in combination with regulation of protein levels by specific proteolysis. Whereas little information is available on the degradation control of DnaA and GcrA, CtrA and CcrM appear to be prime examples of protein regulation by controlled and constitutive proteolysis, respectively. This is accomplished by Lon and ClpXP, two of several ATP-dependent protease complexes present in bacterial cells (see chapters by E. Weber-Ban and L. van Melderen in this issue).

### 3. DnaA degradation links the cell cycle to the nutritional status of the cell

The *C. crescentus* DnaA replication initiator protein is preferentially degraded in SW cells and stabilized in ST cells [19]. It has been proposed that this mechanism ensures that replication initiation at the onset of S-phase depends on newly synthesized DnaA [19], which in turn depends on the replication and methylation status of the Cori region that contains the *dnaA* gene [14]. It is possible that degradation of DnaA enables *Caulobacter* to directly couple DnaA abundance to the replication status of the chromosome and/or to the presence of another cell cycle regulator that is out-of-phase with DnaA. The molecular basis for the differential stability of DnaA during the cell cycle is unclear. Although DnaA was stabilized in a strain depleted of the ClpP peptidase, no significant effect was observed in strains that either lacked ClpA or were depleted of the essential ClpX chaperone [19]. While it is possible that a different protease or chaperone subunit is responsible for DnaA turnover, it is also possible that under the conditions used, depletion of functional ClpX subunits was insufficient to observe an effect on DnaA stability. Because CtrA was efficiently stabilized under the same depletion conditions (see below), ClpX (possibly assisted by a specific adaptor molecule) might have a much higher affinity for DnaA than for CtrA, and minute levels of residual ClpX may suffice to degrade DnaA [19].

DnaA is not only subject to degradation in growing cells, but is also rapidly cleared upon entry of *C. crescentus* into stationary phase [19]. This phenomenon could contribute to the growth arrest of *Caulobacter* cells under starvation conditions. In agreement with this idea, DnaA stability in differentiating SW cells depends on the nutritional status of the cell with starvation for carbon or nitrogen activating DnaA turnover [19,38]. Interestingly, carbon starvation-induced degradation of DnaA requires SpoT, the bifunctional synthase/hydrolase that controls cellular levels of the stress-signaling nucleotide (p)ppGpp. Mutants lacking SpoT not only failed to downregulate DnaA in the absence of a carbon source, but also showed increased replication initiation frequency under these conditions [38]. Together, these studies led to the proposal that DnaA proteolysis prevents the inappropriate initiation of DNA replication in *C. crescentus* when resources are limiting, and suggested that this event is mediated by a SpoT-dependent increase in (p)ppGpp concentration [38]. How ppGpp influences DnaA stability and which other components and signals are involved in this regulatory mechanism remain unclear. The observation that DnaA is stable in *Escherichia coli* and accumulates in stationary phase [5,56] has led to the speculation that DnaA instability may be an evolutionary adaptation to the oligotrophic habitat of *C. crescentus*, where the economic use of proteins would be a strong selective advantage [19].

### 4. Cell cycle timing of CcrM through constitutive degradation by the Lon protease

CcrM DNA methyltransferase methylates adenine residues of specific GANTC recognition sites, which are randomly positioned throughout the *C. crescentus* chromosome. CcrM is essential for *C. crescentus* viability, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis. Recent data suggest that CcrM is a critical component of a ratchet-like mechanism that couples the progression of DNA replication to downstream cell cycle
events through sequential changes in the chromosome methylation state [14]. Transcription of the *ccrM* gene is restricted to a short interval near the end of DNA replication coinciding with the time when the two newly replicated and hemimethylated sister chromosomes are remethylated [66]. This remarkable accuracy in timing is achieved by a combination of positive control by CtrA [51, 52] and negative autoregulation by methylation of the *ccrM* promoter region through the action of its own gene product CcrM [58].

The level of CcrM protein during the cell cycle closely reflects the level of *ccrM* transcription, with negligible protein detected in the two progeny after cell division (Fig. 1) [57, 64]. Several observations suggest that this sharp fluctuation is accomplished by an elegant combination of controlled synthesis and constitutive degradation by the Lon protease. In strains lacking the Lon protease or expressing *ccrM* constitutively, the CcrM protein is present throughout the cell cycle [64, 66]. In both situations, this results in chromosomes that are fully methylated throughout the cell cycle, in relaxed control of chromosome replication initiation and in abnormal cell morphology [66]. Therefore, rapid degradation of CcrM is important to strictly limit the presence of the protein to an interval at the end of the cell cycle. This maintains the hemimethylated status of the chromosome throughout most of the S phase and ensures proper control of the temporal expression of key genes like *dnaA* (turned off in the hemimethylated state) [14] or CtrA (turned on in the hemimethylated state) [52]. In particular, continued expression of *dnaA* after replication initiation explains why *lon* mutant cells, which lack hemimethylated chromosomes, show aberrant replication initiation behavior [64].

### 5. Cell-cycle-dependent degradation of GcrA and CtrA

The synthesis and concentration of the two global regulators GcrA and CtrA oscillate during the cell cycle with a striking out-of-phase pattern (Fig. 1). This behavior is a direct consequence of their interdependence at the transcriptional level [22]. To transform this transcriptional interdependence into protein oscillation, both GcrA and CtrA need to be removed at specific stages of the cell cycle. Steady state levels of GcrA exactly parallel *gcrA* transcription and do not change significantly when *gcrA* is expressed from a constitutive promoter [15, 22]. This, together with the finding that the GcrA half-life is considerably shorter in SW cells than in ST cells, strongly argues that GcrA is subject to cell-cycle-dependent degradation. The protease(s) and regulatory mechanism(s) responsible for cell-cycle-dependent degradation of GcrA remain unknown.

In contrast, recent results begin to shed light on the regulatory mechanisms involved in CtrA proteolysis. CtrA, which impacts both cell cycle and development [34, 48, 49], is only present in SW and late PD cells (Fig. 1). Upon synthesis, CtrA is activated by phosphorylation, thereby increasing its affinity for its specific DNA binding sites [51]. The expression of *ctrA* is controlled by two promoters that are active at different times in the cell cycle. First, GcrA activates the weak P1 promoter; then, as CtrA~P begins to accumulate, the stronger P2 promoter is activated by

positive autoregulation [17]. Positive feedback of *ctrA* expression creates a binary switch that increases cellular levels of CtrA as long as it is not interrupted by CtrA degradation. This takes place during the SW-to-ST cell transition or in the ST compartment of the PD cell, when either of the two cell types enters the next S-phase (Fig. 1) [16].

How is CtrA degradation controlled temporally during the SW-to-ST cell transition and spatially in the PD cell? Recent results support a model where CtrA degradation is mediated by the transient dynamic localization of protease and substrate to the same subcellular site. During the G1-to-S transition and in the late PD cell, both CtrA and its cognate protease ClpXP [13, 28] localize to the stalked cell pole where CtrA is degraded [41, 53] (Fig. 2). CtrA is stabilized in mutants that fail to localize either the protease or the substrate to this subcellular site, suggesting that CtrA degradation is intimately linked to the dynamic spatial arrangement of these proteins during the cell cycle [18, 25, 41]. Polar targeting of ClpXP is controlled by the single domain response regulator CpdR [25]. CpdR is phosphorylated and dispersed in swarmer and PD cells, but during the G1-to-S transition and in the ST compartment of the late PD cell, CpdR is dephosphorylated and positioned to the ST pole to recruit ClpXP (see below) (Fig. 2). CpdR localization to the cell pole not only enables CtrA degradation, but eventually also leads to its own ClpXP-mediated degradation, thereby releasing the ClpXP protease from the pole and halting the degradation of newly synthesized CtrA [26].

CtrA localizes to the ST cell pole coincident with CpdR and ClpXP (Fig. 2). CtrA localization is mediated by PopA, a response regulator-like protein harboring two receiver-like domains fused to a GGDEF domain [18] (for a review on GGDEF domain proteins see: [54]). PopA is a paralog of the diguanylate cyclase PleD, which localizes to the differentiating cell pole during the SW-to-ST cell differentiation, where it directs flagellar ejection, holdfast biogenesis and stalk formation [4, 44, 45, 62]. PopA dynamically localizes to the same pole to direct CtrA to this subcellular site [18, 41]. However, while PleD activation and polar localization are driven by its cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation [44, 45], PopA recruitment to the ST cell pole requires binding of the signaling molecule c-di-GMP to a high affinity binding site located in the catalytically inactive GGDEF domain [18]. Together with the observation that expression of a heterologous c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase disrupts PopA localization and CtrA turnover, this has led to the idea that CtrA recruitment responds to an upshift in c-di-GMP upon S-phase entry (see below) (Fig. 2). PopA directly interacts with RcdA, a protein required for CtrA localization and degradation by ClpXP [41]. Although RcdA is not required for ClpXP-dependent degradation of CtrA in vitro [13], its strict requirement in vivo argues that it could play a role as a pole-specific adaptor enhancing ClpXP degradation of CtrA and possibly other substrates [41].

Although epistasis experiments suggested that PopA and CpdR define two distinct polar recruitment avenues for the CtrA substrate and the ClpXP protease, how exactly these pathways are interlinked is not clear [18]. Mutants lacking CpdR or ClpX also fail to localize CtrA and RcdA to the cell

pole [25]. Conversely, CpdR and ClpX frequently mislocalize in *popA* but not in *rcdA* mutants [18,41]. It is possible that the components of the CtrA degradation machinery form a macromolecular complex that transiently assembles at the cell pole to activate protein degradation in response to the appropriate signals during the cell cycle (Fig. 2).

But how exactly is the dynamic behavior of CpdR and PopA regulated during the cell cycle? CpdR is kept in its inactive, phosphorylated form by the CckA-ChpT phosphorelay that also activates CtrA [6,25]. Through this elegant mechanism cells directly coordinate CtrA activity and stability. When the CckA pathway is inhibited, CtrA is no

longer activated and active CtrA~P is rapidly cleared from the cell. In contrast, activating the CckA pathway not only activates CtrA, but leads to the stabilization of CtrA~P [6]. Although PopA shows similarity to response regulators, it is not activated by phosphorylation but through binding of c-di-GMP [18]. This led to the proposal that one or more diguanylate cyclases and/or phosphodiesterases may be responsible for an increase in c-di-GMP in ST cells and consequently direct PopA to the pole [18]. C-di-GMP levels indeed increase transiently when SW cells differentiate into ST cells [44]. This increase mainly depends on the diguanylate cyclase PleD, a central regulatory component of *C. crescentus* pole morphogenesis [3,4,44]. While a *pleD* single mutant showed no apparent defect in CtrA degradation [18,44], a mutant lacking all potential diguanylate cyclases (the *C. crescentus* genome encodes 11 proteins with a GGDEF domain) and hence is devoid of c-di-GMP, failed to localize PopA and degrade CtrA. Moreover, introduction of a copy of the *pleD* gene into this strain restored PopA localization and CtrA turnover [1]. This strongly argues that PleD is not only a key player for pole morphogenesis, but together with one or more additional diguanylate cyclases, is also responsible for PopA-mediated CtrA degradation and entry into S-phase (Fig. 2).

PleD activation during the SW-to-ST cell transition requires phosphorylation by the PleC and DivJ histidine kinases [4,45]. PleC and DivJ specifically localize to the SW and ST pole, respectively, and during a short interval that coincides with PleD activation, coexist at the old pole [44,63]. At this stage of the cell cycle, the single domain response regulator DivK plays a key role in stimulating both DivJ and PleC kinase activity and thus PleD phosphorylation. The appearance and polar localization of DivJ during cell differentiation results in DivK phosphorylation and sequestration of DivK~P to the same pole. Here it switches PleC from a phosphatase into a kinase state and, through allosteric activation of DivJ, stimulates its own phosphorylation and polar localization (Fig. 2) [27,44,50]. These spatially organized kinase feedback loops trigger a sharp increase in DivK~P and PleD~P levels and thus rapidly and robustly switch cells to the stalked cell program (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of PleD at this point in the cell cycle activates its C-terminal diguanylate cyclase domain and, through an increase in c-di-GMP, helps to recruit PopA to the cell pole [43,45]. Because the active form of PleD, PleD~P also localizes to the same subcellular site, it is possible that a specific spatial arrangement of the diguanylate cyclase and its downstream target PopA facilitates c-di-GMP-mediated signaling and protein dynamics [45].

DivK not only plays a key role in PopA-mediated polar recruitment of CtrA, but also stimulates the CpdR/ClpXP branch of the pathway by promoting the accumulation and polar localization of the unphosphorylated form of CpdR [6,26]. It has been proposed that DivK inhibits CckA activity in the ST cell, thus blocking phosphate transfer from ChpT to CpdR [6]. How DivK influences CckA activity remains unclear. The observation that DivK mediates delocalization of CckA at the G1-S transition suggested that inactivation of the kinase could be linked to its delocalization [6]. Alternatively,

CckA, in addition to functioning as a kinase in SW cells, could also play a role as a phosphatase in ST cells. DivK, directly or indirectly, would serve to shift the balance between these two states. A similar mechanism has recently been proposed for DivK-mediated control of the PleC kinase/phosphatase (Fig. 2) [44]. Together, these studies indicate that DivK is a central effector of the G1-S transition in *C. crescentus* that, through PopA and CpdR, promotes ClpXP and CtrA recruitment to the same subcellular site.

## 6. Other *Caulobacter* proteins regulated through proteolysis

The diguanylate cyclase PleD and its product c-di-GMP are critically involved in controlling *C. crescentus* motile-sessile transition [4,44,45]. Recent data demonstrate that, in addition to the tight cell cycle-dependent regulation of PleD, a SW cell-specific phosphodiesterase, PdeA, is required to establish the motile swarmer cell program. Mutants lacking PdeA show reduced motility, premature holdfast synthesis beginning in newborn swarmer cells, and an increased propensity for surface colonization (Abel and Jenal, unpublished). This argues that the primary function of PdeA is to uphold the motile SW cell program against the antagonistic activity of one or more diguanylate cyclases. A genetic screen for motile suppressors of the Δ*pdeA* mutant identified the diguanylate cyclase DgcB as a PdeA antagonist (Abel and Jenal, unpublished). DgcB operates in both cell types and, together with PleD, executes the sessile ST cell program. In motile SW cells, DgcB is kept in check by the dominant phosphodiesterase PdeA, which is specifically degraded during the SW-to-ST transition. During differentiation, PdeA transiently localizes to the incipient stalked pole, where it is degraded by the polar ClpXP protease complex [(Abel and Jenal, unpublished),41,53]. PdeA degradation requires CpdR and ClpXP, but not PopA and RcdA, arguing for the existence of several ClpXP-dependent polar degradation pathways in *C. crescentus* (Fig. 2) (Abel and Jenal, unpublished). Degradation of PdeA releases DgcB activity at the stage of the cell cycle that coincides with PleD activation (see above). Thus, both PdeA and PleD represent key regulatory effectors of *C. crescentus* cell fate determination. Their cell-type-specific role is achieved by an elegant combination of proteolysis and phosphorylation control, which inversely regulates these two activities to shift the c-di-GMP balance during development and to establish the characteristic cellular programs. The cell fate determinant DivK, which also regulates PdeA degradation through the CckA-ChpT-CpdR pathway, orchestrates the morphogenic and cell cycle transitions in *C. crescentus* through a multilevel mechanism involving the coordinated control of CtrA and PdeA stability as well as PleD activity (Fig. 2).

Protein degradation not only contributes to defined cell cycle fluctuations of regulatory proteins in *C. crescentus*, but also removes structural parts of the flagellum and components of the chemotaxis machinery during the SW-to-ST cell transition [20–22,30,49,62,63]. Whereas the polar chemoreceptor McpA and the soluble chemoreceptor McpB are degraded in a ClpXP-
dependent manner, the FliF protein, which forms the MS-ring anchor of the flagellar structure, is degraded by the ClpAP protease [21,47,60]. It is unclear whether ClpAP localizes to the incipient ST cell pole, where FliF degradation takes place. The degradation of components of SW cell-specific polar organelles facilitates their removal during cell differentiation and helps maintain cellular asymmetry within the *C. crescentus* life cycle.

The ubiquitous *trans* translation pathway can clear stalled ribosomes in bacteria through the addition of an ssrA degradation tag to the nascent polypeptide and release of the ribosome. Subsequently, tagged proteins are targeted to ClpXP or other proteases [13,31]. *C. crescentus* cells that lack *trans* translation activity grow slower than wild-type cells due to a delay in the initiation of DNA replication [30]. Thus, proteolysis of one or more tmRNA-tagged proteins is likely to be important for correct timing of DNA replication. Whereas CtrA is degraded at the same time as in wild type, transcription of *dnaA* (Fig. 1) is delayed in mutants lacking *trans* translation activity [12]. This phenomenon was recently linked to a *cis*-acting element upstream of the *dnaA* promoter, the mutations of which eliminated the transcription delay and partially suppressed the DNA replication phenotype [12]. Although several proteins have been identified that are tagged by the *trans* translation machinery in *C. crescentus* under normal growth conditions, their potential involvement in replication control remains unclear [23].

Aside from eliminating key regulatory and structural proteins, proteases can also modulate or stimulate the activity of specific proteins. This is nicely illustrated by the processing of the polarity determinant PodJ during the *C. crescentus* cell cycle. The *podJ* gene encodes a 974 amino acid protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminal part, a single transmembrane domain and a periplasmic C-terminal region [37,61]. The full-length protein (PodJ<sub>L</sub>) is synthesized in the early PD cell and localizes to the incipient SW pole where it recruits PleC histidine kinase/phosphatase and components required for pili biogenesis. As cells divide, the periplasmic domain of PodJ is degraded, resulting in a membrane-anchored short form PodJ<sub>S</sub>, which is required for later steps in pole development, presumably by recruiting additional polar factors after cell division. Eventually, PodJ<sub>S</sub> is cleared from the cell pole before PodJ<sub>L</sub> is synthesized again and localized to the opposite pole [61]. Processing of PodJ<sub>L</sub> into PodJ<sub>S</sub> requires the periplasmic protease PerP, which is expressed only after the two compartments of the PD cell have separated during cytokinesis [10]. Later in the cell cycle, clearance of PodJ<sub>S</sub> is initiated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) catalyzed by MmpA, a member of the site-2 metalloprotease family [2,11,40]. Eventually, the cytoplasmic part of PodJ is removed by an as-yet-unidentified protease. Thus, a sequence of proteolytic events contributes to the asymmetric distribution of PodJ isoforms and thus to the correct succession of polar organelle development.

### Conclusion

Recent work highlights the importance of the dynamic spatial organization of the ClpXP protease and its substrates for controlled protein turnover in *C. crescentus*. This raises the question as to why *Caulobacter* cells choose to spatially confine protein degradation within the same compartment. A simple explanation could be that such a spatial arrangement bears on the inherent asymmetry of *C. crescentus*, with CtrA degradation and replication initiation being limited to the ST compartment of the late PD. Alternatively, *Caulobacter* might separate different pools of substrates with distinct degradation behavior or kinetics by maintaining compartmentalized sub-fractions of the ClpXP complexes. Although ClpXP is essential for *C. crescentus* viability, mutants lacking the pole recruitment factor CpdR are fully viable, arguing that ClpXP indeed has distinct roles associated with different subcellular locations. Concentrating protease, substrate and specific adaptor proteins through co-localization to one cell pole might, for instance, avoid substrate competition or enhance the substrate recognition ability of the protease. It is interesting to note that in *Bacillus subtilis* several Clp complexes, adaptor and substrate proteins localize in discrete clusters close to the cell poles [29,32,55]. It has been proposed that in these polar regions translating ribosomes and distinct degradation clusters coexist to ensure proper protein quality control [29,32,55].

Although we are beginning to understand the complex spatiotemporal regulation of ClpXP protease activity in *C. crescentus*, there are still a number of components missing. Not only do genetic data indicate the presence of additional ClpXP substrates delivered by the PopA/CpdR pathway [18], but the existence of PopA/RcdA-dependent (CtrA) and -independent substrates (PdeA) argues for distinct recruitment pathways delivering substrates to the polar protease. Finally, ClpXP also transiently localizes to the septum during cytokinesis, indicating that it is involved in cell division control, perhaps by locally regulating the stability of additional substrate proteins [41]. Clearly, additional work is needed to fully appreciate the complex mechanisms of proteolysis control in this fascinating organism.
