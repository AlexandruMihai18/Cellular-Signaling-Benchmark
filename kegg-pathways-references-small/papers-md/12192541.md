**Abstract.** The autoimmune thyroid diseases, Graves’ disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism, represent the two ends of a disease spectrum where an immune response is directed against the thyroid gland. In Graves’ disease, antibodies directed against the thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) lead to the development of glandular overactivity, while in autoimmune hypothyroidism, cell-mediated and humoral thyroid injury leads to destruction of thyroid tissue and thyroid hormone deficiency. The mechanisms by which these diseases develop are unknown, although it is likely that both diseases occur in genetically susceptible individuals exposed to a permissive environment. A number of environmental factors have been postulated to be involved in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease. There is, however, no direct evidence to support clear causality. Susceptibility loci within immune response genes have been identified although a significant component of the genetic predisposition to disease remains unknown. This review will focus on some of the studies designed to identify genes that confer susceptibility to the autoimmune disease process within the thyroid gland.

## Introduction

Autoimmunity was first recognised in the early 1950s and to date more than 70 chronic autoimmune disorders have been characterised. Complex autoimmune diseases demonstrate a lack of tolerance to self-antigens, whereby autoreactive lymphocytes and/or antibodies of the adaptive immune system mount an inflammatory response against various tissues and systems within an individual. The response may be organ-specific, such as type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, Graves’ disease, autoimmune hypothyroidism and multiple sclerosis, or non-organ specific, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease [1]. Together, autoimmune diseases are estimated to be prevalent in 4%–5% of the general population, with most demonstrating a strong female predominance [2].

The aetiology of autoimmune disease is incompletely understood, although there seems little doubt regarding the genetic component, as evidenced by the phenomenon of multiple disease clustering within families and individuals. The fact that concordance rates for disease in monozygotic twins, at around 30%–40%, are much higher than in dizygotic twins supports a genetic contribution to disease. However, concordances in monozygotic twins are well below 100%, implicating the interaction with environmental or stochastic factors [3, 4, 5, 6].

The multifactorial nature of autoimmunity has made the identification of susceptibility factors difficult. However, the link between autoimmune disease and the major histocompatibility complex-human leukocyte antigen (HLA-MHC) has been known for over 20 years. Genetic polymorphism and in turn structural variants of the MHC-HLA molecules on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) may increase susceptibility to certain autoimmune diseases due to their roles in thymic selection of naïve T cells and antigenic peptide presentation to peripheral T cells.

T cell activation, however, requires co-stimulatory signals from the ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) with MHC/antigen complexes and binding of CD28 molecules on the T cell to B7-1 and B7-2 molecules on the APC. Suppression of the immune response and antigenic tolerance is mediated by the antagonistic effect of a CD28 homologue, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated-4 (CTLA-4) [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. CTLA-4 shares 70% sequence homology with CD28 and is located in close proximity on chromosome 2q33 [8]. CTLA-4 binds B7-1

**Graves' disease**

Graves' disease (GD) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease of the thyroid gland which usually develops in the fourth decade of life. Patients present with hyperthyroidism, a diffuse goitre and, in around 50% of cases, ophthalmopathy. Pretilial myxoedema and digital clubbing are rare clinical findings [20, 21]. Immunological features of GD include lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland and presence of autoantibodies against thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase and the thyroid stimulating hormone (thyrotropin) receptor (TSH-R) [22, 23]. TSH-R antibodies are present in more than 95% of GD patients [24] and appear to be primarily involved in the development of disease. A few individuals have been found to possess TSH-R-blocking antibodies, resulting in hypothyroidism [22]. Generally, however, hyperthyroidism is the rule and treatment options include antithyroid drugs, such as carbimazole, radioactive iodine and partial thyroidectomy [20].

GD is common in the general population, with a prevalence of 0.5%–1% and a strong female predominance (5–10:1) [25]. A genetic component to the disease has been suggested owing to familial clustering and twin studies [22, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Stenszky and co-workers initially reported monozygotic twin concordance rates of 30%–40% compared with 3%–9% for dizygotic twins, implicating a polygenic aetiology [28]. More recently, Brix et al. confirmed these findings in Danish twins, with similar concordance rates [29].

As with the other common autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, three main approaches have been employed in the search for GD susceptibility loci [30]. First, population-based case-control studies may be used, which are a sensitive method of gene detection and for which recruitment of subjects is relatively simple. False positives, however, may be generated owing to population stratification, and prior knowledge of candidate genes is required. Second, genome wide linkage analysis has been employed. This approach has met with very limited success in complex disease for a number of reasons, including the fact that it requires the collection of DNA from a large number of multiply affected families. Finally, intrafamilial association analyses are being increasingly used, employing, for example, the transmission disequilibrium test [31] to test candidate genes. This approach overcomes population stratification (population mismatching), whilst at the same time only requiring families with one affected member. Consequently the families are easier to collect, and the approach is therefore well suited to genetic studies, which require large numbers of individuals.

Down-regulation of the inflammatory immune response has also been attributed to regulatory T cells (T<sub>R</sub> cells), previously known as suppressor T cells. T<sub>R</sub> cells are a normal subpopulation of CD4+ T helper cells, which express cell surface markers such as CD25 (the IL-2 receptor) and CTLA-4 [13, 14]. CD4+ cells can be subdivided into Th1 and Th2 cells, which produce pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Th1 responses, although essential in controlling intracellular pathogens, could therefore also perpetuate autoimmune disease [15, 16]. Other possible aetiological factors in the manifestation of autoimmunity include defects in proteins of the innate immune system, such as complement components [17] and also molecular mimicry of host antigens by invading pathogens inducing immune cross-reactivity [18, 19].

**Susceptibility genes for GD**

MHC class II region. Human chromosome 6p21 encodes the HLA antigens, including DP, DQ and DR. These cell

European Journal of Nuclear Medicine Vol. 29, Supplement 2, August 2002
surface glycoproteins exist as many allelic variants on APCs such as B lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, capillary endothelium and, under certain circumstances, follicular thyrocytes [32, 33]. These features make the MHC class II region a good candidate for GD [34, 35].

In the past, associations between GD and HLA-DR3 and specifically the DRB1*0304-DQB1*02-DQA1*0501 haplotype [36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45] have been reported in both case control and family-based studies, producing relative risks, for the development of disease, of between 1.9 and 3.8 [27]. Family based linkage studies have been performed, with conflicting results at HLA, suggesting inadequately sized data sets [38, 39, 40, 46]. Studies have been carried out in an attempt to identify specific phenotypic differences including thyroid eye disease and antibody status but results have been inconsistent [45, 46]. Larger studies will be required if genotype and haplotype data are to be used in diagnostics.

**CTLA-4 gene.** The CTLA-4 gene on chromosome 2q33 has been investigated as a candidate for the development of GD because of its role in down-regulating the immune system. In 1995, Yanagawa et al. [47] studied an (AT)n microsatellite in the 3' untranslated region of CTLA-4 exon 3 and found a significant increase in the 106-bp allele in GD patients compared with controls. This result was subsequently confirmed by Kotsa et al. [48] in a UK population. The significance of this microsatellite is not clear, although it could possibly affect mRNA stability or the function of the resulting CTLA-4 protein.

A number of further studies [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52] reported an association between GD and an A to G polymorphism at position 49 in exon 1 of CTLA-4, which results in a threonine to alanine amino acid change and a relative risk, for the development of disease, of approximately 1.5 [51]. Heward et al. [51] demonstrated an increased frequency of the G allele in GD patients in case-control and family-based studies and also showed that a GG genotype was associated with a more severe biochemical disease (circulating free T4) at diagnosis. Takara et al. [52] replicated these A/G findings in Japanese patients with younger-onset type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease. Tomer et al. [53] have also shown the CTLA-4 A/G polymorphism to be linked to thyroid autoantibody production. Finally, although early reports suggested an association with thyroid eye disease [54], data from a much larger dataset cast doubt on these findings [45]. In summary, therefore, the CTLA-4 gene region confers susceptibility to the development of GD although there is no convincing evidence to suggest susceptibility to a particular phenotype and the mechanism underlying the association remains unknown.

TS H-R gene. The TSH-R is a candidate gene for GD because of the role of the TSH-R as the primary autoantigen in disease development. Polymorphism in the extracellular domain of the TSH-R on chromosome 14q has been identified, which results in a C to A change at position 1 of codon 52 and induces a proline to threonine amino acid change [55]. Studies of this polymorphism (mostly population-based case-control studies) have produced conflicting results [56, 57, 58, 59]. More recently however, a lack of association was found with GD in both a case-control and a family-based study of UK and Hong Kong Chinese patients [59].

Segregation and linkage analysis of microsatellite markers in the TSH-R failed to show an association with GD [60]. Tomer et al. [61] have, however, identified a preliminary GD susceptibility locus, designated GD-1, on chromosome 14q31, approximately 25 cM from TSH-R, although this is unlikely to involve the TSH-R and awaits replication in an independent dataset. At the present time, therefore, there is no clear evidence to link the TSH-R with GD.

Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene. The interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene on chromosome 2 has been investigated as a candidate for GD owing to its ability to compete with IL-1α and IL-1β for cell surface receptors to inhibit the action of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-1. Tarlow et al. [62] described a penta-allelic polymorphism in intron 2 of IL-1ra, due to the presence of a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) sequence. Allele 2 (IL1RN*2) was found to be associated with GD in a case-control study [63]. This result, however, could be attributed to population stratification or genetic mismatching, as a subsequent study [64] reported no association of the IL-1ra polymorphism with GD in either a case-control or a family-based study. Analysis using more informative markers in the IL-1ra region is required before a true role for the IL-1 antagonist can be ascertained.

Other genes. A number of other susceptibility genes for GD have been investigated and will be mentioned briefly. First, a C to T polymorphism at –590 in the promoter region of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene was reported to confer protection to GD [65]. However, information from a much larger study has raised serious questions of these data [66]. Second, the large multifunctional proteasome (LMP) genes, LMP2 and LMP7, were investigated [67] owing to their location within the MHC class II region, their hyperexpression in thyrocytes and their possible role in antigen processing. No association of a LMP7 polymorphism was found in either a case-control or a family-based study. Association between polymorphism of LMP2 and GD has been reported although this is secondary to linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the HLA haplotype, DRB1*0304-DQB1*02-DQA1*0501. Third, a 13-bp deletion in the autoimmune regulator gene

European Journal of Nuclear Medicine Vol. 29, Supplement 2, August 2002(AIRE1) on chromosome 21q22.3 has been shown to account for more than 70% of mutant alleles in UK subjects with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). The 13-bp deletion was, therefore, investigated in a case-control study and no evidence for association with GD was found in this large UK dataset [68].

**Genome wide linkage studies.** A genome-wide linkage study using microsatellite markers has revealed three further chromosomal regions conferring susceptibility to GD: $GD-1$ on chromosome 14q31, $GD-2$ on chromosome 20q11.2 and $GD-3$ on the X chromosome, Xq21.33–22 [69]. These regions were identified in a dataset that included multi-ethnic families. Replication of these data and the identification of novel candidate genes in these regions are awaited. Linkage to GD has also been reported on chromosome 18q21 [27], a region that has previously been identified as a susceptibility locus for type 1 diabetes, and on chromosome 5q31–33 in Japanese patients [70]. The latter is a cytokine-rich gene region which has also been reported to be linked to Crohn’s disease.

Finally, Barbesino et al. [71] investigated the female preponderance in GD through linkage studies targeting loci involved in oestrogen activity, such as the α and β oestrogen receptor genes and the aromatase genes. Microsatellite markers were used to screen the X chromosome. The oestrogen receptor α and aromatase genes were not associated with GD but the oestrogen receptor β could not be excluded owing to incomplete mapping information. Linkage, however, was detected with GD and Xq21.33–22, which could help explain the increased female tendency in the development of GD. Nevertheless, these data require confirmation in independent datasets.

### Autoimmune hypothyroidism

A form of autoimmune hypothyroidism (AH), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), was first described in 1912 by Hashimoto and is now recognised as the major form of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis [72]. Patients with AH present with symptoms of hypothyroidism including cold intolerance, mental slowing, apathy, dry skin, hair loss and constipation. They also share some of the features of GD, including a diffuse goitre, a thyroid lymphocytic infiltrate and autoantibodies to thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase [22]. This organ-specific autoimmune inflammatory response is estimated to be prevalent in 0.7% of the general population, with an incidence of 22 cases per 100,000 per year [73]. As with GD, there appears to be a strong female predominance and an age-dependent trend, where disease manifests more often after the age of 50 years [73, 74]. Stagnaro-Green et al. [75] also reported an association of AH with reduced fertility and noted a spontaneous abortion rate twice that in euthyroid women. Treatment for AH is typically with thyroxine [72].

Familial clustering of AH provides evidence for a complex genetic component in the aetiology of disease, although it seems that a permissive environment is also necessary. Further support for a genetic component comes from the finding of AH in diseases arising from chromosomal abnormalities, including Turner’s and Down’s syndrome [73].

The methods for studying the genetics of AH are the same as those for GD. However, our knowledge of genes conferring susceptibility to AH is not as advanced as that for GD owing to the lack of suitable cohorts of DNA. This is almost certainly because most patients with AH are not seen in the hospital setting as they can easily be managed by general practitioners in the community.

#### Susceptibility genes for HT

##### MHC class II region

Numerous studies have investigated the HLA region in AH, with conflicting results. Aberrant expression of DR alleles has been found on the surfaces of AH thyrocytes [33] and initially, $DR3$ and $DR5$ were thought to be associated with two separate forms of AH, although subsequent studies have failed to confirm these findings [76]. Shi et al. [77] showed that susceptibility to AH in Caucasians was probably via the DQA1*0301/DR4 and DQB1*0201/DR3 pathways, whereas others have suggested protective roles for DQA1*0102 and DQB1*0602 [78]. These data therefore highlight the need for further HLA investigations in large data sets to define the effect of this region on the development of AH.

##### CTLA-4 gene

Much work has been performed on this gene in association with GD but until recently, information on CTLA-4 in AH was lacking. Kotsa et al. [48] showed the $(AT)_n$ 106-bp microsatellite allele, located in the 3′ untranslated region of exon 3, to be associated with AH. This is the same allele as that which has been reported to be associated with GD and type 1 diabetes.

The A to G polymorphism at position 49 in exon 1 has been associated with AH in German, Canadian and Korean subjects [79, 80] and recently in a UK case-control study [81]. Petrone et al. [82], however, failed to show association of either the $(AT)_n$ microsatellite or the A/G polymorphism in Italian HT subjects. This discrepancy may have been due to a chance event in a small dataset or to geographical variation in allele frequencies. As previously mentioned, Tomer et al. [53] found that the A/G polymorphism was associated with thyroid autoantibody production, although they failed to detect linkage to AH in their family dataset.

The CTLA-4 gene region undoubtedly acts as a general autoimmunity locus and as such also confers susceptibility to AH. The size of the effects of $MHC-HLA$ and
CTLA-4 are, however, insufficient to account for all of the genetic susceptibility to AH [22]. A number of other candidate genes have been investigated by researchers, as described briefly below.

Other genes. None of the five alleles of the IL-1ra previously described for GD have shown an association with AH [64]. Similarly, no association was found between AH and the 13-bp deletion of the AIRE1 [68]. Genome-wide linkage studies by Tomer et al. [69] and Sakai et al. [70] identified potential AH susceptibility regions on chromosomes 5q31–33, 8q23–24, 12q22 (HT-2) and 13q22 (HT-1). These will, however, need confirmation in independent datasets.

### Conclusion

The multifactorial nature of the common autoimmune thyroid diseases makes study into factors conferring susceptibility to disease difficult. Complex diseases have been shown to involve many aetiological components such that no single environmental factor or gene is either sufficient or necessary for the development of disease (Table 1). A more likely picture is that a combination of a few key alleles, each contributing to susceptibility, results in disease manifestation, but only in a permissive environment. The phenomenon of “autoimmunity” is thought to be present in the normal immune system, but it is the environmental trigger which allows effector functions to be generated, resulting in the autoimmune disease process. Susceptibility alleles of genes may have been conserved throughout evolution as they may be the same alleles that have conferred protection against life-threatening infections in the past.

There is increasing evidence to suggest that the MHC-HLA and CTLA-4 gene regions play an important role in the development of both GD and AH. The mechanisms by which they confer susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease, however, remains unknown. Many of the conflicting results reported in this review have almost certainly arisen because of the small numbers of subjects in the various data sets. Future genetic studies must involve large data sets that are powered to detect small multiple effects and should include both population- and family-based data sets. All positive results need to be replicated in independent data sets.

So why should we identify genes involved in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease? At the therapeutic level the MHC-HLA genes have proved problematic in terms of developing disease-modulating therapies. It is to be hoped, however, that the unknown non-MHC loci accounting for the remaining genetic contribution to familial clustering will be identified, as this may impact on our understanding of the development of autoimmune thyroid disease and provide eventual therapeutic spin-offs.

could also impact on other diseases such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Gene therapy [83] could provide long-term gene expression either locally or systemically to correct pathogenic immune responses, whilst at the same time not affecting protective immune functions. It may also provide growth factors for the repair of damaged tissues. Above all, however, gene therapy must be specific as well as regulatory and it should be remembered that the immune system is multi-integrational and any affect on one component is likely to have an effect on others.
