Data presented in the preceding papers in this series (1, 2) showed the accumulation of an unstable intermediate after appropriate enzyme fractions had catalyzed three-, two-, or one-step oxidations of nicotine, 6-hydroxynicotine, or 6-hydroxy-pseudooxynicotine, respectively. The intermediate was spontaneously and irreversibly altered to a metabolically inactive form. The active compound was identified as 2,6-dihydroxy-pseudooxynicotine (I), and the inactive compound, isolated in crystalline form, as 2,6-dihydroxy-N-methylmyosmine (II). Since neither compound had previously been described and since neither an unambiguous synthesis nor degradation to known compounds was achieved, the identification rested on indirect data. Independently, Gries et al. (3) and Decker et al. (4) also isolated a product of nicotine breakdown which, in all reported properties, including metabolic inertness, was essentially identical to the inactive compound mentioned above. They considered several possible structures for it and its metabolically active precursor, including the dihydroxy derivatives I and II, and suggested, also on the basis of indirect evidence, that the active intermediate is γ-methylaminopropenyl-(6-hydroxypyridyl-3) ketone (IV)¹ and the inactive form, its inner salt (V).

We have studied the metabolism of the active compound and have demonstrated the following conversion (see Fig. 7):

I + H₂O → 2,6-dihydroxypyridine  
+ γ-methylaminobutyric acid

The results confirm the identification of I as 2,6-dihydroxy-pseudooxynicotine and establish further intermediates in the pathway of nicotine degradation by *Arthrobacter oxydans*.

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

#### Bacteriological—The nicotine-oxidizing bacterium originally designated P-34 (5) was used. It has now been identified as a strain of *Arthrobacter oxydans* which corresponds in most properties to the original description (6). Cells for most purposes

were obtained from 20-hour nicotine broth cultures grown as previously described (5). Cells were also grown on the surface of nicotine agar plates and harvested at 36 hours. Such cells proved more active in the oxidation of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine than those from liquid cultures.

Cell-free extracts were prepared by sonic disruption (1); the supernatant fluid obtained after centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min is referred to as “crude extract.” Fractions of the crude extract were obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation (7).

Analytical Methods—Spectrophotometric measurements were made with either a Bausch and Lomb Spectronic 505 or a Cary model 15 with cuvettes with 1-cm light paths. Thunberg tubes transmitting in the ultraviolet range were used for spectrophotometric experiments under anaerobic conditions. The tubes were alternately evacuated and filled with oxygen-free nitrogen through several cycles to achieve anaerobiosis.

Chromatography was performed at room temperature with the ascending technique and Whatman No. 1 paper. The solvent systems used are listed in the tables. Papers were sprayed with ninhydrin, dried, and heated at 90° for 30 min to locate γ-amino-butyric acid and γ-methylaminobutyric acid. The former compound reacts with the indicator almost immediately to form an intense purple spot while the latter is detectable as a less intense purple-gray spot after heating. FeCl₃ (1%) in alcohol was used as a spray to locate 2,6-dihydroxypyridine.

Chemicals—Nicotine, 2,6-dihydroxypyridine, and γ-amino-butyric acid were obtained from commercial sources; maleamic

absorbance at 325 mμ and pigment formation which paralleled that observed in the aerobic cuvette.

The absorption spectrum of the reaction mixture at the end of the anaerobic reaction, or at the end of the first phase of the aerobic reaction prior to pigment formation showed that the starting substrate had disappeared and that a new compound with maxima at 234 and 320 mμ was present (Fig. 2). These maxima correspond to those reported for 2,6-dihydroxypyridine (10). The same product was detected when a dilute suspension of early log phase cells (20 hours) was incubated with 6-hydroxy-

The reaction mixtures contained 0 to 40% ammonium sulfate fraction (1.5 mg of protein); 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxy- nicotine, 0.12 μmole in 0.05 ml 0.01 N HCl; potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 20 μmoles; and water to 3.0 ml.

droxynicotine and 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine were prepared enzymatically (7, 8); γ-methylaminobutyric acid was synthesized by the method of McElvain and Vozza (9).

2,6-Dihydroxypseudooxynicotine was prepared enzymatically by the oxidation of 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine with 40 to 60% ammonium sulfate fraction (1). The conversion was followed spectrophotometrically, and the reaction mixture was acidified with concentrated HCl to pH 2.0 as soon as product accumulation reached a maximum. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution, if not used immediately, was stored at −20°. The conversion of 2,6-di- hydroxypseudooxynicotine to 2,6-dihydroxy-N-methylmyos- mine is relatively slow under acid conditions (1), and the solution could be stored for several days. Aliquots of the acid solution of 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine were used as substrate and added to reaction mixtures containing sufficient buffer to give the desired final pH.

RESULTS

Identification of 2,6-Dihydroxypyridine—As reported earlier (1), the addition of 0 to 40% ammonium sulfate fraction in the presence of air to a reaction mixture containing 2,6-dihydroxy- pseudooxynicotine (λ_max 275, 345 mμ) resulted in a rapid decrease in absorbance at 345 mμ (Fig. 1). This initial change was followed by a slow decrease in absorbance at 325 mμ and a con- comitant formation of a blue pigment with an absorption maxi- mum at 600 mμ. The change at 345 mμ occurred equally rapidly in the absence of oxygen, but no additional changes were observed as long as the cuvette contents were kept anaerobic (Fig. 1). Introduction of air, however, initiated a decrease in

Cells and substrate were incubated at room temperature in a cuvette (1 × 1 × 4.5 cm), and the absorp- tion spectrum was recorded at periodic intervals. The initial (---) and final (——, 140 min) spectra are shown. Reaction mixture: 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine, 0.2 μmole; cell suspension (500 Klett units, No. 54 filter), 0.02 ml; 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to 3.02 ml.

pseudooxynicotine (λ_max 289 mμ) in an open (aerobic) cuvette. The absorbance of the reaction mixture between the range 360 to 220 mμ was recorded at about 3-min intervals. The family of curves obtained showed the gradual utilization of the initial substrate and the appearance of some 234- and 320-mμ absorbing material; the initial curve and that taken at 140 min are reproduced in Fig. 3. The reaction proceeded without detectable intermediate accumulation of 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine, but some pigment was formed by 140 min. The ratio of E_320: E_234 at 140 min did not correspond to that observed in experiments with extracts (Fig. 2) in which there was a rapid and apparently stoichiometric formation of the 234- and 320-mμ absorbing compound. Since pigment, and probably other ultraviolet absorbing compounds, were also present in the experiment with whole cells, the ratio has no significance. Cells grown on nutrient broth did not bring about this transformation.

To accumulate the product, 1 ml of crude extract (17 mg of protein), 28 μmoles of 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine, and 15 ml of 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were added to a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask which was incubated at 30° without agitation. Small aliquots were removed periodically and assayed spectrophotometrically. When peak absorption at 320 mμ had been attained, the reaction mixture was acidified with concentrated HCl to pH 2.0. Further manipulations were done in a nitrogen atmosphere. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fluid was stored at 10°. After 24 hours, dark green crystals were observed at the bottom of the flask. These were collected by filtration, washed repeatedly with water, and dried to constant weight; yield 2.7 mg (66% of theoretical calculated as 2,6-dihydroxypyridine hydrochloride).

The isolated product was compared with an authentic sample of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine hydrochloride (Table I). The melting points and mixed melting point were identical, as were their absorption spectra in neutral and acid solution. Aeration of a neutral or slightly alkaline solution of either resulted in a decrease in absorbance at 234 and 320 mμ concomitant with the development of the deep blue pigment characteristically produced during nicotine metabolism by Arthrobacter species. It is not known whether the green color of the crystals is an inherent property of the compound or whether it is due to a spontaneous oxidation of some of the 2,6-dihydroxypyridine to pigment during preparative manipulations, although the latter is more probable. In addition, both substances gave a positive Folin-

Identification of γ-Methylaminobutyric Acid—The identification of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine as a product of the anaerobic degradation of 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine implies that γ-methylaminobutyric acid could also be formed in the reaction. To detect the amine, crude extract was incubated with 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine as described above until accumulation of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine was maximum. The reaction mixture was deproteinized with acetone and clarified by centrifugation,

with this compound in several solvent systems (Table II). It will be noted that the compound differs from γ-aminobutyric acid, which has been implicated in nicotine metabolism (11).

Metabolism of γ-Methylaminobutyric Acid and 2,6-Dihydroxypyridine—Cells grown on nicotine were induced to the oxidation of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine and γ-methylaminobutyric acid while cells grown on nutrient broth failed to oxidize either substrate (Fig. 4). Cells grown on either medium failed to oxidize 2,5-dihydroxypyridine or γ-aminobutyric acid.

Crude extracts of 20-hour cells from nicotine broth rapidly oxidized γ-methylaminobutyric acid (Fig. 5) but failed to oxidize 2,6-dihydroxypyridine. The latter substrate was oxidized, however, by extracts of 36 hour cells from nicotine agar (Fig. 5). The oxygen uptake was approximately 1 μmole of oxygen per μmole of substrate, indicating catalysis of two oxidative reactions by the extract. Oxidation of the dipyridol was not accompanied by pigment formation, and spectrophotometric examination of reaction mixtures showed that all 2,6-dihydroxypyridine had disappeared and that no new ultraviolet-absorbing product had accumulated. Control flasks without enzyme or reaction mixtures with inactive enzymes always formed pigment upon shaking and contained residual substrate at the end of the experiment.

Maleamic Acid Oxidation—Since maleamic acid is a product of pyridine ring cleavage following hydroxylation at either the 2,5- or 2,6-position in nicotinic acid oxidation (12, 13), it was investigated as a possible intermediate in nicotine degradation. Cells grown on nicotine under a variety of conditions failed to oxidize maleamic acid in Warburg experiments. However, crude extracts of cells grown on nicotine oxidized this compound at an appreciable rate (Fig. 6). Neither cells grown on nutrient agar nor extracts of such cells oxidized maleamic acid.

DISCUSSION

The demonstration of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine and γ-methylaminobutyric acid as products of the anaerobic breakdown of the compound previously identified as 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine (1) confirms this identification. Parenthetically, it is difficult to see how these products could arise from the compound (IV) postulated by Gries et al. (3, 4) as the intermediate corresponding to 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine. The cleavage of 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine, being nonoxidative, can be formulated as a hydrolysis of the starting substrate (Fig. 7) which may appear unusual since, to the best of our knowledge, no previous example of the biochemical replacement of a side chain of an aromatic ring compound by hydrogen is known. However, the reaction has precedence in the thiolysis of β-ketoacyl-CoA compounds as carried out by plants, animals, and microorganisms in fatty acid oxidation. In the reaction under consideration, the carbonyl function attached to the 3-position of the ring is β to the 2-pyridone (the tautomer of the 2-hydroxy), and the structure is that of a β-keto acid amide. Although the reaction has been formulated as a hydrolysis our data do not exclude the possibility of CoA involvement.

In view of earlier reports (14) that methylamine is a product of nicotine oxidation, it is possible that γ-methylaminobutyric acid is metabolized via a cleavage to methylamine and γ-hydroxybutyric acid. On the other hand, Casida and Rosenfield (11) have shown the accumulation of γ-aminobutyric acid in *Arthrobacter* cultures growing on nicotine. They suggested that the amine arose from the pyridine moiety of nicotine. Since,

and the supernatant fluid was evaporated at room temperature under vacuum to a volume of 3 ml. Chromatography of the concentrate with a variety of solvent systems showed the presence of a compound which reacted with ninhydrin upon heating, as does γ-methylaminobutyric acid. It had the same \(R_f\) values as synthetic γ-methylaminobutyric acid and cochromatographed

FIG. 7. The pathway of nicotine oxidation by *A.* oxydans

however, the formation of this amine from 2,6-dihydroxypyridine is unlikely; a demethylation of $\gamma$-methylaminobutyric acid could be postulated. The failure of nicotine grown cells to oxidize aminobutyric acid argues against this possibility, but the data are not conclusive and further investigations are needed.

The oxidation of maleamic acid by extracts of cells grown on nicotine but not by extracts of cells grown on nutrient agar implicates this compound as an intermediate in the further metabolism of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine. The failure of intact cells to oxidize maleamic acid can be attributed to a permeability barrier; a similar situation has been described for three other organisms metabolizing this compound (12, 13, 15).

In addition to its formation from 2,6-dihydroxypyridine in the metabolism of nicotine by *A.* oxydans, maleamic acid is also formed from 2,5-dipyridol in the oxidation of nicotinic acid (12) or nicotine (15) by two pseudomonads and from 2,6-dihydroxynicotinic acid in the oxidation of nicotinic acid by a *Bacillus* species (13). From a consideration of the structures of these pyridine ring compounds and maleamic acid, it appears that a merging of the four diverse pathways occurs in a common intermediate previous to ring cleavage. To form maleamic acid the ring must be cleaved between carbon atoms 5 and 6, which implies a previous hydroxylation at both positions and suggests 2,5,6-tripyridol as the common intermediate. This compound could be formed from those mentioned above by an oxidation at the 5-position for *A.* oxydans, at the 6-position for the pseudomonads, and by an oxidative decarboxylation for the *Bacillus* species. Although spectrophotometric evidence has been obtained for the formation of a tripyridol during whole cell oxidation of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine (15), the data are not conclusive and further investigation of this point is required.

The data presented also bear on the problem of the origin and structure of the nicotine blue pigment first described by Bucherer (16) and Wenusch (17). It is clear that this pigment arises by the oxidation of the 2,6-dihydroxypyridine formed in the nonoxidative cleavage of 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine. Since it has been shown that the pigment formed by the chemical oxidation of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine is identical to the product arising in the course of nicotine metabolism (18), its formation

is additional confirmation of the intermediary role of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine in nicotine metabolism by *A.* oxydans. Gries et al. (3) concluded that production of the nicotine blue pigment from their postulated intermediate (IV) involved an additional equivalent of oxygen, at least two intermediate compounds, and elimination of all or most of the carbons of the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine. Thus, except for disagreement on the structure of the starting compound (I versus IV), their findings and ours correspond. In a recent note (19), it is suggested that the nicotine blue pigment is the magnesium salt of 2,2′-diketo-5,5′-dihydroxydipyridyl(6,6′), a structure similar to one proposed (20) for the related pigment formed from 2-hydroxypyridine by *Arthrobacter crystallopoietes* (21). This formulation of the structure implies that the metabolic precursor of the pigment is 2,5-dihydroxypyridine which is not consistent with the data reported here. Unfortunately the details of this work (19) are not yet available.

From the data in this and the preceding papers of this series (1, 2, 5, 7, 8), the pathway shown in Fig. 7 can now be proposed for nicotine degradation by *Arthrobacter oxydans*. It is a reasonable assumption that maleamic acid is metabolized via the reactions described by Behrman and Stanier (12); the fate of $\gamma$-methylaminobutyric acid is as yet unknown.

SUMMARY

A compound previously identified as 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine was cleaved anaerobically by an enzyme fraction of *Arthrobacter oxydans* with the accumulation of a product having absorption maxima at 234 and 320 $m\mu$. In the presence of oxygen this compound slowly disappeared with the parallel formation of the nicotine blue pigment. Whole cell and enzymatic metabolism of 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine also gave rise to the 234- and 320-$m\mu$ compound which was crystallized from an enzymatic reaction mixture and identified as 2,6-dihydroxypyridine. $\gamma$-Methylaminobutyric acid, demonstrated chromatographically, also accumulated during the enzymatic reaction. Both 2,6-dihydroxypyridine and $\gamma$-methylaminobutyric acid were oxidized by cells and extracts of *A.* oxydans grown on nicotine but not of organisms grown on nutrient agar. Maleamic

acid was also oxidized by extracts of cells grown on nicotine. These data confirm the identification of 2,6-dihydroxypseudo- oxynicotine, establish additional intermediates in the pathway of nicotine degradation by *A. oxydans*, and indicate the metabolic precursor of the nicotine blue pigment.
