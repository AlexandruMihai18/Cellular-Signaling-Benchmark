1 Introduction

Anthocyanins are secondary plant products that constitute a major subgroup of flavonoids. Anthocyanins play roles as pigments of flowers and fruits to attract insects for pollination and act as protectants against UV-B irradiation. They also exhibit anti-oxidant activities and therefore may serve as potential anti-cancer and anti-arteriosclerosis compounds in human health.

The biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins is one of the most extensively studied pathways of plant secondary products (Fig. 1). Most enzymes and genes involved in this biosynthetic route have been characterized in the last two decades. Several recent reviews describing the biosynthesis of anthocyanins are available.¹⁻⁸ Since the most recent comprehensive review⁷ has summarized the literature until 1997, we summarize the literature up to the beginning of 2002 on the progress in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins in this article.

2 Chalcone synthase

2.1 Diversity of chalcone synthase enzymes and related reactions

Chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and anthocyanin pigments. It performs sequential condensations with p-coumaroyl-CoA and three acetate units from malonyl-CoA. The resulting tetraketide intermediate undergoes intramolecular cyclization to 2′,4,4′,6′-tetrahydroxychalcone (naringenin chalcone). In plants, naringenin chalcone is stereospecifically converted to the flavanone (2S)-naringenin by chalcone isomerase (CHI). In the absence of CHI, the isomerization occurs spontaneously yielding racemic (2R/S)-naringenin (Fig. 2).⁷

Its reaction mechanism classifies CHS as polyketide synthase (PKS). In contrast to most fungal or bacterial PKSs, which are large assemblies of multifunctional (Type I PKS) or mono-functional (Type II PKS) proteins, CHS is a relatively small homodimeric protein with two functionally independent subunits of 40–45 kDa (Type III PKS).⁹ In addition, the CHS reaction does not require an acyl carrier protein or 4-phosphopantetheinyl derivative for the transfer of acetate units to the growing polyketide chain. CHS is a member of the large family of plant PKSs that includes e.g., the closely related stilbene synthases,¹⁰ acridone synthases,¹¹ pyrone synthases,¹² valero-

phenone synthases¹³,¹⁴ and benzalacetone synthases.¹⁵ These enzymes catalyze similar reactions, but differ with regard to the starter CoA ester, the number of condensations with malonyl-CoA and the stereochemistry of the final polyketide cyclization reaction (Fig. 3). This review chapter will focus on CHS and some general features of Type III PKS reactions. A more detailed description of plant PKSs can be found in recent reviews.¹⁶,¹⁷

CHS is one of the best-characterized enzymes of the plant secondary metabolism. Despite the large number of CHS sequences in the GeneBank database, only the identity of a comparatively small number was verified by heterologous expression or genetic evidence. Due to the high sequence homology of CHS with other plant PKSs, it is impossible to predict the function only from the sequence data. Therefore, several sequences in the databases which are annotated as CHSs by similarity may have different metabolic roles, which can only be elucidated by experimental characterization. For instance, two CHSs from *Pinus strobus* (PstrCHS1 and PstrCHS2) catalyze different reactions, although they show 88% identity at the protein level. PstrCHS1 performs the typical CHS reaction, whereas PstrCHS2 is inactive with p-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA.¹⁸ Instead, it catalyzes one condensation with a starter molecule that is chemically analogous to the postulated diketide-CoA intermediate of the CHS reaction and methyl-malonyl-CoA as extender (Fig. 3).¹⁸ Other examples are the

CHS catalyzes the condensation of p-coumaroyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA to a tetraketide intermediate which undergoes cyclization to naringenin chalcone. In plants, naringenin chalcone is converted stereospecifically to the flavanone (2S)-naringenin by chalcone isomerase (CHI).

raspberry PKSs. Despite negligible differences at the protein level, PKS1 and PKS3 from raspberry catalyze the CHS reaction, whereas PKS2 is inactive with any substrate tested so far. ${}^{19}$

In general, CHS displays a high flexibility with respect to various starters. In addition to p-coumaroyl-CoA, the physiological start substrate, CHS in vitro converts other phenylpropanoid-CoA esters, albeit with less efficiency. ${}^{18,20-22}$ An

phytoalexins. Besides cinnamic acid-derived starters, many disparate substrates like benzoyl-CoA, phenylacetyl-CoA, short aliphatic CoA esters and cinnamic acid analogs halogenated in the 4-position are converted by CHS.^{23–29} However, with many of these starters elongation and folding of the intermediate polyketide chain appear to be impaired, and little or no correctly cyclized chalcone derivatives are synthesized. Instead, pyrones are the major products.^{25,26,29}

Previous studies identified pyrones as byproducts of the CHS reaction.^{24,30} It was shown that under non-optimal reaction conditions, e.g. high concentrations of thiol reagents, CHS releases considerable amounts of reaction intermediates. Akiyama *et al.*^31 resumed these investigations and demonstrated that even under normal conditions CHS produces byproducts *in vitro*. Two major derailment products, bis-noryangonin and p-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone, were identified. They arise after condensation of p-coumaroyl-CoA with two or three molecules of malonyl-CoA followed by a presumably non-enzymatic lactonization of the tri- or tetraketide (Fig. 2). Due to their acidic nature these derailment products can only be extracted with ethyl acetate at low pH. In previous studies, however, the neutral or alkalyzed reaction mixture was extracted, which may explain the failure to identify the side products.^31

Of particular interest is the cross-reactivity of CHS with stilbene synthase (STS), a polyketide synthase which occurs in several taxonomically unrelated plant species. Similarly to CHS, STS catalyzes three stepwise condensations of p-coumaroyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA yielding an intermediate tetraketide, but performs a different ring closure reaction (Fig. 3). It was shown that a CHS from *Pueraria lobata* produces small amounts of the stilbene resveratrol, and an STS from *Arachis hypogaea* revealed low CHS side activity.^32 These findings are of considerable interest, because it was proposed that STS originated from CHS in the course of evolution.^33 Subsequent experiments, however, indicated that the cross-reactivity of CHSs and STSs is presumably due to misfolding of the recombinant proteins in bacterial expression systems, since lower rates of CHS and STS side activity were found after refolding of the recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies or expression in eucaryotic systems.^34

start substrate specificity, number of elongation cycles and the stereochemistry of the cyclization reaction. For instance, the alteration of three distinct amino acids in the active site of CHS was sufficient to significantly reduce the volume of the catalytic pockets and to functionally convert CHS into 2-pyrone synthase, 43a PKS which utilizes acetyl-CoA as start substrate and catalyzes only two condensations with malonyl-CoA (Fig. 3).12 In addition, the crystallographic studies may provide an explanation for the broad substrate specificity of CHS and the formation of side products. The active site acts as size-based filter and excludes bulky substrates, but allows access of all CoA-esters which fit in the cavity. However, small molecules like acetyl-CoA cannot be transferred efficiently to the active site cysteine and are therefore poor substrates.43 Likewise, the architecture of the active site cleft serves as a template for the correct folding of the tetraketide intermediate. Small changes in the catalytic center of CHS may impair the cyclization and consequently lead to derailed pyrone products. This is illustrated by mutational studies. Jez et al.29 demonstrated that the replacement of the G256 residue with larger amino acids decreases the volume of the active site cavity. This leads to an increased formation of derailment products, altered substrate preference towards smaller CoA-esters and a decreased number of condensations with malonyl-CoA. The catalytic efficiency of the G256 mutants was found to be only slightly reduced. Recent studies suggest that in addition to steric differences in the catalytic pocket, specific hydrogen bond interactions contribute to catalysis and are important for the regio-specificity of the polyketide cyclization.44

The crystallographic and mutational analysis of CHS provides the base for the combinatorial biosynthesis of new products by targeted engineering of CHS and related plant PKSs. Moreover, these results shed a new light on the evolution of CHS-like enzymes. Many plant species contain small CHS multigene families, and it has been proposed that the rapid diversification of the duplicated CHS genes leads to functional shifts in enzyme specificity.45 As minor amino acid exchanges in the active site cleft of CHS significantly alter the catalytic characteristics, a rapid evolutionary diversification appears to be likely.29

### 2.3 Chalcone ketide reductase

In most cases, the enzyme-bound intermediate of the CHS reaction is not modified. Many isoflavonoids, however, are derived from 2′,4,4′-trihydroxychalcone, which lacks the 6′-hydroxyl group.46 Precursor studies indicated that the reduction of the hydroxyl group occurs at the polyketide stage prior to cyclization.47 Further experiments demonstrated that this reaction is catalyzed by chalcone ketide reductase (CHKR), an NADPH-dependent, monomeric enzyme that presumably interacts with CHS.48 CHKR was purified and cloned for the first time from soybean.48,49 Expression in *E. coli* yielded recombinant CHKR, which synthesized 2′,4,4′-trihydroxychalcone in coaction with soybean CHS. The non-reduced chalcone and naringenin were also detected as products *in vitro*. For the exclusive formation of 6′-deoxychalcones a close association or interaction of CHS and CHKR may be required *in vivo*. Most noteworthy, 6′-deoxychalcones can also be formed when CHKR is incubated together with CHSs from species that do not synthesize isoflavonoids or 5-deoxyflavonoids.9,48

Despite the mechanistic similarities, the CHKR protein sequence does not reveal high homologies with reductases of fatty acid synthesis, but rather with oxidoreductases of carbohydrate metabolism.46 Reductases interacting with plant PKSs are presumably not confined to the isoflavonoid pathway. The presence of polyketide reductases has been postulated e.g. for the synthesis of stilbenes in liverworts and the formation of hydrangeic acid in Garden Hortensia.17

### 3 Chalcone isomerase

#### 3.1 Reaction catalyzed by chalcone isomerase

Chalcone isomerase (CHI) catalyzes the stereospecific cyclization of naringenin chalcone (2′,4,4′,6′-tetrahydroxychalcone) and 6′-deoxychalcone (2′,4,4′-trihydroxychalcone) to (2S)-naringenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavanone) and (2S)-liquiritigenin (4′,7-dihydroxyflavanone), respectively.7 CHIs of non-legumes convert only chalcones which are hydroxylated in the 6′-position. In leguminous plants, which accumulate 5,7-dihydroxyflavonoids and 7-hydroxyflavonoids, CHIs catalyze both reactions.50 Recent investigations revealed the presence of CHI enzymes with distinct substrate specificities in legumes. Three CHI isozymes of *Glycyrrhiza echinata* were partially purified and characterized.51 Two of these enzymes accepted both 6′-hydroxychalcones and 6′-deoxychalcones and appear to be responsible for the formation of isoflavonoids. The third enzyme converted only 6′-hydroxychalcones and therefore functions in the general flavonoid pathway. The further analysis of the CHI isozymes in the *Glycyrrhiza echinata* system will provide new information on the evolutionary specialization of CHIs in leguminous and non-legume plants.

Mechanistically, the CHI reaction is a Michael-type addition. It has been proposed that the reaction starts with the deprotonation of the 2′-hydroxyl group of the chalcone.52 The resulting 2′-oxyanion performs a nucleophilic attack on the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated double bond (Fig. 5). Due

![Figure 5](https://i.imgur.com/XYZ.png)

**Fig. 5** Proposed reaction of chalcone isomerase (CHI).52,56

Nat. Prod. Rep., 2003, 20, 288–303

to the acidic character of the 2′-hydroxyl group, deprotonation occurs in solution at physiological pH, 53 and the conversion to flavanones also proceeds *in vitro*. 6′-Deoxychalcones are chemically more stable than chalcones with a 2′,4′,6′- hydroxylation pattern, and their spontaneous isomerization occurs less readily.54

The non-enzymatic conversion of chalcones yields racemic (2R/S)-flavanones. Since (2S)-flavanones are the exclusive substrates of downstream enzymes of the flavonoid pathway *in vivo*, CHI guarantees the efficient formation of biologically active (2S)-isomers. Mutants lacking CHI activity such as the *Arabidopsis transparent testa 5* (*tt5*) mutants accumulate only trace amounts of flavonoids.55 This indicates that CHI activity is essential for the production of flavonoids *in vivo*.

CHI was cloned and characterized from several plant species. The enzyme is a functional monomer with a molecular mass ranging from 24–29 kDa. Alignments at the polypeptide level reveal a relatively high degree of identity (49–82%) between CHI enzymes from different plant species. CHI-like sequences are restricted to higher plants and show no detectable similarity with other proteins.

### 3.2 Structure of chalcone isomerase

The recently elucidated three-dimensional structure of alfalfa CHI52 corroborates the evolutionary unique position of CHI, since no structural homologues are present in the databases. The architecture of the active site cleft limits the possible conformations of the chalcone substrate, and side chains protruding into the catalytic cavity prevent the formation of (2R)- flavanones.52 In order to bring the chalcone into a catalytically productive formation, the 2′-oxyanion and the α,β-unsaturated double bond of the chalcone are exactly positioned into proximity to facilitate the cyclization reaction. Kinetic studies on the pH dependence of the CHI mechanism suggest that the 2′-oxyanion is already formed in solution before entering the active site cleft, and the formation of the flavanone occurs in a diffusion-controlled reaction.53 In the structure of CHI, two water molecules are involved in a network of hydrogen bonds of the chalcone ketone with amino acid side chains in the active site cleft (Fig. 5). Structural and mutational analysis revealed that four amino acid residues play important roles in the CHI reaction.56 T48 interacts with the chalcone ketone through hydrogen bonds and may directly participate in the catalysis, whereas Y106 presumably stabilizes the water molecule which contacts the oxygen of the keto group. N113 and T190 form hydrogen bonds with the 4′-hydroxyl group of the chalcone and polarize the enzyme-substrate complex. The hydrogen bonds with the 4′-hydroxyl group may also contribute to the correct positioning of the substrate. The amino acids T48, Y106 and N113 are conserved in all CHI sequences, whereas some variation is found at position 190. Only in leguminous plants is the residue in position 190 threonine, but CHIs from other species contain serine. However, no change in substrate specificity was observed after replacement of T190 with serine. These findings suggest that other amino acid residues define the different substrate preferences of CHI enzymes of leguminous and non-leguminous plants.

## 4 Flavanone 3β-hydroxylase

Flavanones are converted to dihydroflavonols by a hydroxylation in position 3 catalyzed by flavanone 3β-hydroxylase (F3H). This enzyme is classified as a soluble 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase according to its requirement of the co-factors 2-oxoglutarate, molecular oxygen, ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and ascorbate. F3H catalyzes the stereospecific hydroxylation of (2S)-naringenin and (2S)-eriodyctiol to form (2R,3R)-dihydrokaempferol and (2R,3R)-dihydroquercetin, respectively (Fig. 6). The biochemistry of F3H was investigated in detail using partially purified F3H from *Petunia hybrida*.57 However,

![Fig. 6 Reaction catalyzed by flavanone 3β-hydroxylase (F3H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR).](image.png)

the petunia enzyme purified to apparent homogeneity turned out to be a proteolytic degradation product.58 Recently, the primary site of cleavage was determined, and the purification method was optimized to avoid proteolysis.59 Catalytically active F3H was shown to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of ca. 42 kDa.60

A cDNA encoding petunia F3H was isolated and expressed in *E. coli* to confirm the activity *in vitro*.61 Sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of petunia F3H revealed that two histidines and an aspartic acid constitute the catalytic center with an iron in the active site of this enzyme.62,63 Moreover, the RXS (arginine-x-serine) motif in the petunia F3H was suggested to contribute to the specific binding of 2-oxoglutarate.64

## 5 Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase

Dihydroflavonols (dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin and dihydromyricetin) are reduced to leucoanthocyanidins (leucopelargonidin, leucocyanidin and leucodelphinidin, respectively) by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) in the course of anthocyanin and/or catechin biosynthesis. DFR catalyzes the stereo-specific conversion of (2R,3R)-dihydroflavonols to (2R,3S,4S)-leucoanthocyanidins (Fig. 6). The biochemistry of DFR has been investigated using the 41 kDa purified protein from young flower buds of *Dahlia variabilis*.65 DFR requires NADPH as reducing cofactor and catalyzes the transfer of the pro-S hydrogen of NADPH to the re-face of the 4-keto group of dihydroflavonol.65

cDNAs and/or genomic clones of DFR have been isolated and characterized from a number of plant species such as *Antirrhinum majus*, *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Zea mays* and *Petunia hybrida*.7 Especially, petunia DFR is well known to have a striking substrate specificity. Since it does not accept dihydrokaempferol, the pelargonidin-type anthocyanins cannot be produced in this plant. This is the reason for the absence of orange-colored flowers in petunia. Recently, the critical region for the substrate specificity was determined in the DFR protein using chimeric DFRs from *Petunia* and *Gerbera*.66 By changing a single amino acid, the substrate specificity of Gerbera DFR was successfully altered to accept preferentially dihydrokaempferol as a substrate (see notes added in proof).

### 6 Anthocyanidin synthase

Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) is pivotal to anthocyanin formation, since it catalyzes the oxidation of the colorless leucoanthocyanidin to a precursor of the colored anthocyanidin. cDNAs and genes that encode ANS have been isolated from a number of plant species, and the deduced amino acid sequences implied that ANS likely belongs to the family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases like flavanone 3β-hydroxylase (F3H) and flavonol synthase (FLS). Genetic evidence of ANS function was provided by the ability of a cDNA encoding maize ANS to restore anthocyanin formation *in vivo* in a mutant lacking ANS.⁶⁷ However, the precise biochemical information regarding the reaction catalyzed by ANS has been missing for a long time, since demonstration of ANS activity in protein extracts of plant tissues or by heterologous expression in bacteria has not been achieved until recently.

Expression of active ANS *in vitro* first succeeded in 1999 using the enzyme preparation of *Perilla frutescens* ANS overexpressed in *E. coli*.⁶⁸ Purified recombinant perilla ANS catalyzed the oxidation of leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin in the presence of ferrous iron, 2-oxoglutarate and ascorbate, followed by acidification with HCl. Further experiments indicated that CO₂ was liberated from 2-oxoglutarate concomitant with anthocyanidin formation. This was the first direct evidence for anthocyanidin synthase as a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase. Other ANSs from *Zea mays*, *Petunia hybrida* and *Antirrhinum majus* were shown to catalyze the reaction in the same manner as perilla ANS.⁶⁹ Sequential reactions with both ANS and flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (3-GT) further indicated that the *in vivo* cytosolic reaction sequence involves an ANS-catalyzed conversion of leuco-

anthocyanidin to 2-flaven-3,4-diol, which is spontaneously isomerized to 3-flaven-2,3-diol (pseudobase), followed by glucosylation at the C-3 position by 3-GT (Fig. 7). This C-3-glucosylated pseudobase is transported into vacuoles and converted to the colored flavylium ion due to the acidic vacuolar conditions.⁶⁹

Recent studies provided evidence that the *in vitro* conversion of leucoanthocyanidin by ANS yields not only anthocyanidin but also dihydroflavonol and flavonol.⁷⁰ It has been suggested that ANS catalyzes a hydroxylation at the C-3 position of leucoanthocyanidin or the direct formation of a C-3 ketone (Fig. 8). Subsequently, dehydration or enolization to 2-flaven-3,4-diol leads to anthocyanidin, while formation of 3-flaven-3,4-diol can lead either to (2R,3S)-cis-dihydroflavonol or (2R,3R)-trans-dihydroflavonol.⁷¹ The trans-dihydroflavonol can be oxidized again by ANS to form flavonol.

Recently, the three-dimensional structure of ANS from *Arabidopsis thaliana* was elucidated by crystallization and subsequent X-ray diffraction analysis.⁷²,⁷³ The structure of the enzyme-cofactor-substrate complex supports the previous biochemical information, e.g. importance of conserved amino acid residues for the binding of 2-oxoglutarate or ferrous iron. Based on the structural data a catalytic mechanism was proposed including a hydroxylation in the C-3 position as the initial step.

### 7 Glycosyltransferases

The anthocyanin pigments exist in glycosylated forms *in vivo*. One or more phenolic hydroxyl groups are glycosylated in the flavonoid C-15 skeleton. Most anthocyanins are glycosylated at the 3-O-position and often at the 5-O-position. The 3-O-

glycosylation is a prerequisite for further modifications, such as second glycosylation, acylation, methylation and prenylation, in anthocyanin molecules. These modifications contribute to increased stability of the anthocyanins and may influence the color variation of anthocyanins by inter- and intra-molecular stacking. ${}^{74}$

In anthocyanin biosynthesis, the unstable anthocyanidins are stabilized first by glucosylation at the 3-O-position by UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (3-GT), which is also referred to as UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase depending on its substrate specificity. In the last several years, the 3-GT cDNAs from a variety of plant species, e.g. *Gentiana triflora*, ${}^{75}$ *Perilla frutescens*, ${}^{76}$ *Vitis vinifera* ${}^{77}$ and *Petunia hybrida*, ${}^{78}$ have been isolated and characterized using recombinant proteins. The glucosylations by these enzymes are regiospecific to the 3-O-position but not absolutely substrate specific. All 3-GTs listed above catalyze the 3-O-glucosylation of flavonols besides anthocyanins. Both anthocyanins and flavonols are 3-O-glucosylated to the same extent by petunia 3-GT. ${}^{78}$ However, the recombinant 3-GT proteins from *Gentiana triflora* ${}^{75}$ and *Vitis vinifera* ${}^{77}$ prefer anthocyanins to flavonols. The sequential reactions by ANS and 3-GT, conversion of leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin followed by glucosylation at the 3-O-position, were confirmed by in vitro reconstitution experiments using the recombinant petunia ANS and 3-GT (Fig. 7). ${}^{69}$

Glucosylation at the 5-O-position of anthocyanins, which is catalyzed by anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT), is an important step in producing stable complexes for co-pigmentation. ${}^{74}$ A 5-GT cDNA was isolated and characterized, for the first time, from reddish-purple pigmented leaves of *Perilla frutescens* by mRNA differential display screening, ${}^{79}$ then 5-GT cDNAs were also obtained from *Verbena hybrida* ${}^{79}$ and *Petunia hybrida* ${}^{78}$ using the perilla cDNA as a probe. All these 5-GTs require 3-O-glucosylated anthocyanins as substrates. The recombinant 5-GTs from *Perilla frutescens* and *Verbena hybrida* accept a broad range of acylated and non-acylated anthocyanin 3-glucoside derivatives (Fig. 9). ${}^{79}$ In contrast, the recombinant petunia 5-GT exhibits a strict substrate specificity towards anthocyanidin 3-acetylrutinoside. Petunia 5-GT does not accept simple anthocyanin 3-glucosides, although sequence similarity between perilla and petunia 5-GTs is high, suggesting that a little change in primary sequence is critical for substrate specificity.

A phylogenetic tree based on an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of flavonoid glycosyltransferases and related proteins is shown in Fig. 10. The 5-GTs form a distinct subfamily and are separated from the other subfamilies, such as

Fig. 9 Late steps of anthocyanin biosynthesis in *Perilla frutescens*. ${}^{8}$ For the biosynthesis of malonylshisonin, the purple pigment in leaves of *Perilla frutescens*, several modifications of the aglycon cyanidin are required, including glucosylation, acylation and malonylation. Anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT) and anthocyanin 3-aromatic acyltransferase (ACT) exhibit a broad substrate specificity but show highest activities with cyanidin 3-O-glucoside. It is therefore likely that the two enzymes compete for their preferred substrate, and the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in perilla probably comprises two alternative routes. MAT, malonyltransferase.

the 3-GT subfamily. The flavonoid 3-O-galactosyltransferase from *Vigna mungo* ${}^{80}$ belongs to the 3-GT subfamily. *Petunia* 3-rhamnosyltransferase ${}^{81}$ is phylogenetically separated from all

specificities either catalyzing the acylation of 5-O-glucosides or 3-O-glucosides. However, both enzymes belong to a super-family of acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferases found in plants. This family includes a variety of acyltransferases with diverse functions in primary and secondary metabolism. Some of these enzymes are involved in the acylation of alkaloids.¹⁰⁰

Anthocyanin malonyltransferase, which catalyzes the malonylation of the glycoside moiety of bisdemalonylsalvianin, was cloned from scarlet sage (*Salvia splendens*) flowers¹⁰¹ and subsequently from *Perilla*.¹⁰² These proteins also belong to the acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase family.

### 9 P450 monooxygenases

Two P450-dependent monooxygenases are committed to anthocyanin biosynthesis, besides cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) involved in the general phenylpropanoid pathway and flavone synthase II (FSh) in flavone synthesis.⁷ These two P450 monooxygenases, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H) and flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H), are both responsible for flavonoid B-ring hydroxylation. F3′H reaction results in the formation of cyanidin-type anthocyanin, and F3′5′H is responsible for delphinidin-type compounds. Since the extra hydroxyl groups in the B-ring generally lead to blueing of flower color, these P450 monooxygenases are good candidates for the manipulation of flower color.¹⁰³

F3′H catalyzes the 3′-hydroxylation of flavanone (naringenin), dihydroflavonol (dihydrokaempferol), flavone (apigenin) and flavonol (kaempferol) to the respective metabolites (Fig. 11).⁷ The first cDNA encoding F3′H corresponding to the *Ht1* locus was isolated from petunia,¹⁰⁴ and then the *Arabidopsis* ortholog corresponding to the *TT7* locus¹⁰⁵ and the *Perilla frutescens* cDNA¹⁰⁶ were cloned. The F3′H activity was demonstrated with the recombinant proteins of these cDNAs. These results confirmed that F3′H proteins belong to the CYP75B subfamily of P450-dependent monooxygenases.

F3′5′H is responsible for the hydroxylation of flavanone (naringenin) and dihydroflavonol (dihydrokaempferol) in both 3′ and 5′ positions to yield the corresponding 3′,5′-dihydroxy-metabolites (3′,4′,5,5′,7-pentahydroxyflavanone and dihydromyricetin, respectively) (Fig. 11).⁷ The F3′5′H cDNA clones belong to the CYP75A subfamily and were isolated from several plant species. In petunia, two loci, *Hf1* and *Hf2*, correspond to two F3′5′H genes encoding P450 proteins 94% identical in amino acid sequences.¹⁰⁷ The petunia F3′5′H enzymes require for full activity a cytochrome b5 encoded by the *DifF* locus, which is responsible for the electron transfer to the specific cytochrome P450 monooxygenases.¹⁰⁸

### 10 Miscellaneous

#### 10.1 BANYULS gene

Genetic analysis of *Arabidopsis* mutants showing precocious accumulation of anthocyanins in the seed coat led to the isolation of the *BANYULS (BAN)* gene. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the *BAN* gene most probably encodes leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR), which belongs to the NADPH-dependent mammalian 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/plant dihydroflavonol reductase superfamily.¹⁰⁹ Since catechins are not produced in *ban* mutant seeds, *BAN* function is localized at the branching point between anthocyanin and tannin production (see notes added in proof).

#### 10.2 H⁺/Na⁺ antiporter

For blue coloration of anthocyanins, increased pH is required in vacuoles. A gene encoding a vacuolar H⁺/Na⁺ exchanger responsible for such pH change was isolated by a transposon tagging strategy from the Japanese morning glory (*Ipomoea nil*).¹¹⁰

### 11 Transport and accumulation

Anthocyanins produced by sequential steps of biosynthetic enzymes located in the cytosol and in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum need to be effectively transported into vacuoles. For the storage within this compartment anthocyanins must be stabilized for prolonged accumulation and prevented from degradation. Although the biosynthesis of anthocyanins has been thoroughly investigated, the vacuolar deposition and sequestration are comparatively little understood. However, several mechanisms have been described so far.

#### 11.1 pH-dependent transport

A conformational trapping mechanism or a specific transporter depending on pH have been supposed for the transport of some flavonoids, e.g., the transport of apigenin-7-(6-O-malonyl)-glucoside into parsley vacuoles¹¹ and anthocyanin into carrot vacuoles.¹² In these transport systems, the acylated structures of flavonoid substrates are essential. In barley vacuoles, isovitexin, a flavone C-glucoside, is accumulated via a ΔpH-dependent isovitexin/H⁺-antiporter.¹³

#### 11.2 ABC-type transporter

In the bronze-2 (bz2) mutant of maize, anthocyanins cannot be transported into vacuoles and remain in the cytosol.¹⁴ Further investigations revealed that the Bz2 gene encodes a type III glutathione S-transferase (GST). Functional analysis of maize Bz2 demonstrated that it is required for anthocyanin sequestration in vacuoles. The petunia Anthocyanin 9 (AN9) gene encodes a type I GST, which is functionally similar to maize Bz2.¹⁵ Despite being only distantly related at the sequence level, Bz2 and AN9 can reciprocally complement an9 and bz2 tissues.¹⁵ Furthermore, a glutathione S-conjugate or a non-covalently bound adduct of cyanidin 3-glucoside, which had been prepared enzymically, was transported by a glutathione S-conjugate pump of Arabidopsis, AtMRP1, expressed in yeast.¹⁶,¹⁷ The glutathione S-conjugate pump is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter and belongs to the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) subfamily. However, glutathionated anthocyanins have never been isolated from plant cells, and GSTs themselves do not seem to be pumps of anthocyanin-GSH conjugates as postulated initially.¹⁴ Rather they may bind anthocyanins through hydrophobic interactions and escort them to the tonoplast membrane. In addition, colocalization of GSTs with actual transporter proteins has been suggested.¹⁸ Recently, it was shown that the vacuolar uptake of flavone glucuronides non-conjugated to glutathione was mediated by an MRP-like ABC transporter in rye mesophyll vacuoles.¹⁹

#### 11.3 MATE family

A strong reduction of proanthocyanidin deposition in vacuoles of endothelial cells was observed in transparent testa 12 (tt12) mutants of *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The TT12 gene encodes a protein with 12 membrane-spanning domains belonging to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family.¹²⁰ TT12 is expressed in the endothelium layer of the testa in immature seeds of *A. thaliana*. These findings suggest that

TT12 controls the vacuolar sequestration of proanthocyanidins in the seed-coat endothelium.

11.4 VP24

A 24-kDa vacuolar protein (VP24) accumulates abundantly in intravacuolar pigmented globules in anthocyanin-containing sweet potato (*Ipomoea batatas*) cells. The primary structure deduced from its cDNA sequence suggested that VP24 is synthesized as a large precursor. VP24 gene expression is closely correlated with the accumulation of anthocyanins in vacuoles. These data suggest that the proteins derived from the VP24 precursor might be involved in the transport or stable accumulation of anthocyanins in vacuoles. Taken together, these findings indicate that different plant species may use distinct mechanisms to distribute flavonoids among subcellular compartments, and multiple mechanisms may be used in individual species.

12 Possible organization of anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes as a multi-protein complex

For the efficient operation of multiple steps of a metabolic pathway, multiple enzymes are sometimes organized as a complex to maintain high local substrate concentrations, to compete for common substrates with different pathways and to fulfil stereospecificity. Organization of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway as an enzyme complex has been postulated. A weak membrane association of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), C4H, CHS and 3-GT was found, leading to a model in which biosynthetic enzymes are loosely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum anchored via P450 proteins such as C4H and F3'H. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assays, affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the protein interaction of CHS, CHI, DFR and F3H in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Co-localization of CHS and CHI was observed at the endoplasmic reticulum and tonoplast in root tissues. However, in vivo interaction of the whole set of proteins in plant cells still remains to be confirmed.

13 Molecular genetic regulation

The biosynthesis of anthocyanins is largely regulated at the transcriptional level, and numerous regulatory loci have been identified (Table 1). The regulatory genes of the anthocyanin pathway generally control intensity and expression pattern of many different structural genes. In addition, some genes show pleiotropic effects and regulate not only anthocyanin biosynthesis, but also influence other traits. Among the regulatory factors of the anthocyanin pathway which have been characterized so far, MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are predominantly represented. The DNA-binding domain of most plant MYB proteins consists of two imperfect MYB repeats, each forming a helix-turn-helix structure, which show sequence homology with the mammalian MYB proto-oncogenes. Likewise, plant bHLH proteins contain a DNA-binding domain with similarity to the

DNA binding/dimerization domain of animal MYC oncogene products.

13.1 The maize system: interaction between MYB and bHLH proteins

One of the best-studied systems is maize, where the COLOR-LESS1 (Cl)/PURPLE LEAF (Pl) family of MYB proteins and the RED (R)/BOOSTER (B) family of bHLH proteins coordinately induce the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. In addition, the MYB homologue P controls the accumulation of 3-deoxyflavonoids and phlobaphene pigments in maize kernels. P and Cl interact with identical regulatory elements in the Al (DFR) promoter. Nonetheless, members of the Cl/Pl family need a bHLH partner, whereas P induces independently the expression of structural genes. Expression of a Cl-R fusion protein in maize cell suspensions activated structural genes of both early and late steps of anthocyanin biosynthesis. In contrast, expression of P in the same system induced genes required for the biosynthesis of flavan-4-ols.

Extensive mutational studies by Grotewold et al. showed that the replacement of four solvent-exposed amino acids in the MYBR3 domain of P with the corresponding residues from Cl was sufficient to enable P to interact with R. Two additional amino acid exchanges were required to make the P regulatory activity partially dependent on R. These findings elucidated how combinatorial interactions of MYB and bHLH homologues in the maize system influence the activation of target genes.

13.2 Regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in dicots

Several bHLH and MYB proteins with sequence homology to R and Cl were found to control anthocyanin biosynthesis in dicot plants, e.g. JAF13 and ANTHOCYANIN 2 (AN2) of *Petunia hybrida*, Delila of *Antirrhinum majus*, MYB-P1 and MYC-RP/GP of *Perilla frutescens*. Despite the sequence similarity, these regulatory proteins appear to control different subsets of structural genes. R and Cl from maize are required for the expression of early and late genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis, whereas JAF13 and AN2 from petunia induce only the transcription of late biosynthetic genes. These species-specific differences in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis are probably due to the divergent evolution of the target gene promoters. Some of the regulatory factors isolated from dicots, e.g. *Antirrhinum majus* MYB305 and MYB340, are similar to maize P in that they are not dependent on the interaction with a bHLH partner and activate the common early steps of flavonoid biosynthesis. In parsley, light regulation of CHS is mediated by MYB and bZIP transcription factors.

Arabidopsis is a useful system to study the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis because its genome displays less redundancy and smaller multigene families than in the case of maize or petunia. Moreover, transposon and activator tagging

can be used to identify key regulatory loci in Arabidopsis. Using the activation-tagging technology, Borevitz et al. 142 identified PAP1 (production of anthocyanin pigment 1), a MYB factor showing high sequence similarity with petunia AN2. When PAP1 is overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the whole plant exhibits purple pigmentation concomitant with a broad transcriptional activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway.

Most flavonoid-related mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana have been identified on the basis of modified seed pigmentation and are therefore known as transparent testa (tt) mutants. 143 Some of the tt mutants are defective in regulatory genes. The Arabidopsis TT2 and TT8 loci were found to encode novel MYB and bHLH proteins, which are both required for the expression of DFR and BAN (putative leucoanthocyanidin reductase) genes in siliques and the accumulation of pro-anthocyanidins in seeds. 144, 145 TT2 controls the temporal and spatial expression of DFR and BAN, and is dependent on TT8. It has not yet been established whether the combinatorial action of TT2 and TT8 is mediated through protein-protein interactions. However, TT2 contains the conserved residues which are required for the interaction between MYB and bHLH proteins, 132 and physical interaction of these two proteins is presumably necessary for their function. TT8 appears to be an ortholog of AN1 from petunia, 146 which controls anthocyanin patterning in flowers. AN1 directly activates the DFR promoter and is probably regulated by the MYB factors AN2 and AN4. In addition, AN1 controls seed coat morphogenesis and vacuolar pH, two processes which are only little understood. 147 Recently, the bHLH factor F3G1 was isolated from red leaves of Perilla frutescens by differential display RT-PCR. 148 F3G1 is presumably involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and shows considerable similarity to AN1 and TT8. The F3G1, TT8 and AN1 sequences show only little homology with other bHLH regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis, but display high identity with IN1 (INTENSIFIER1) from maize, which has been described as a putative repressor of anthocyanin biosynthesis. 149 This indicates that they may constitute a novel group of anthocyanin regulatory bHLH proteins.

### 13.3 Regulators from other protein families

One of the most remarkable discoveries during the last five years was the identification of the AN11 locus of petunia, which defines a new class of anthocyanin regulatory proteins. The AN11 locus encodes a WD40 repeat protein, 150 which is related to the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins and may be involved in protein-protein interactions. an11 mutants are rescued by overexpression of the MYB homologue AN2. This suggests that AN11 acts upstream of AN2. Nonetheless, a direct activation of target genes can be excluded for AN11, since it is localized in the cytoplasm.

The AN11 orthologs TTG1 (TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1) 151 and PFWD (Perilla frutescens WD repeats) 152 were isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana and Perilla frutescens, respectively. TTG1 and PFWD show the same subcellular localization as AN11, but seem to have more pleiotropic effects, as they also control trichome development and root epidermal cell patterning. In contrast to AN11, the WD40 proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana and Perilla frutescens modify the activity of bHLH proteins. PFWD interacts with perilla MYC-RP resulting in the translocation of the complex into the nucleus, 152 and TTG1 is required for the expression of TT8 in Arabidopsis siliques. 145

Two other transcription factors, TTG2 (TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2) 153 and TT1 (TRANSPARENT TESTA1), 154 were suggested to control proanthocyanidin synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds together with TTG1, TT2 and TT8. TTG2 is a WRKY transcription factor which controls trichome formation and seed coat development and acts downstream of

TTG1. 153 TT1 defines the WIP subfamily of zinc finger proteins and regulates seed pigmentation. Seeds of ttl mutants show decreased accumulation of phenolic compounds and reduced expression of BAN. 154 A crucial issue to be investigated now is the interplay of TT1, TT2, TT8, TTG1 and TTG2 in the regulation of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis seeds.

ANTHOCYANINLESS2 (ANL2) of Arabidopsis thaliana is the first homeodomain protein known to be involved in the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments. 155 Analysis of anl2 mutants showed reduced anthocyanin accumulation in seedlings and mature plants, particularly in the subepidermal leaf tissues, and an aberrant cellular organization of the root. It has not yet been investigated whether homeodomain proteins also regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in other species and which position they hold in the regulatory network.

#### 13.4 Repressors of anthocyanin biosynthesis

Only a few repressors of anthocyanin biosynthesis are known. Recently, several members of the MYB family were found to act as transcriptional inhibitors. FaMYB1, a repressor of anthocyanin biosynthesis in strawberry, was isolated using a random expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing approach of a cDNA library from red strawberry fruit. 156 FaMYB1 encodes a relatively short MYB-type protein, which is mainly expressed in ripening, red and over-ripe fruit. Tobacco plants overexpressing FaMYB1 showed significantly decreased anthocyanin accumulation in flowers and stamen filaments and reduced levels of flavonoids. Moreover, gene expression and enzyme activities of the late anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway were found to be reduced. Two-hybrid assays in yeast showed that the FaMYB1 protein interacted with the petunia bHLH factors JAF13 and AN1. The FaMYB1 sequence displays a high degree of similarity with AmMYB308 and AtMYB4, two inhibitors of hydroxycinnamate biosynthesis in Antirrhinum majus and Arabidopsis thaliana. 157, 158 Both sequences contain the conserved motif LNL[E/D]L in their C-terminal domain, which is characteristic for subgroup 4 of the Arabidopsis thaliana MYB gene family. 159 Mutational studies on AtMYB4 showed that this conserved sequence forms part of the region involved in the repression effect. 158

### 14 Conclusions

During the last five years, considerable progress has been made in the molecular characterization and expression of structural and regulatory genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. In particular, novel information was obtained on the late steps catalyzed by ANS, anthocyanin-modifying enzymes and transporters. The elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of enzymes like CHS, CHI and ANS provides the opportunity to analyze the reaction mechanisms in detail. However, there are still many open questions concerning the terminal reactions of anthocyanin biosynthesis, the formation of proanthocyanidins, vacuolar sequestration and protein-protein interactions.

The availability of genomic datasets from the diploid model plants Arabidopsis thaliana, 160 Medicago truncatula 161 and Lotus japonicus 162 makes it possible to study the anthocyanin pathway in a simplified system and to avoid the difficulties encountered when working with ornamental plants, which are often polyploid. Multiparallel analysis of mRNA and proteins and metabolite profiling can be applied to investigate the effects of a single change at one level of the metabolic network on multiple pathways. 163 mRNA-profiling of maize suspension cell cultures over-expressing the transcription factor Porac1-R fusion protein revealed the activation or repression of hundreds of genes belonging to various metabolic pathways. 131 This example illustrates that the use of the recently developed profiling technologies can provide new insights into the connection between different biosynthetic routes. With these new

300 Nat. Prod. Rep., 2003, 20, 288–303

perspectives the biosynthesis of anthocyanins remains an interesting topic to investigate.

### 15 Notes added in proof

While this paper was under review, successful expression of dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) in eucaryotic [164] and bacterial [165] systems was reported for the first time. The function of the protein encoded by the BANYULS (BAN) gene was identified as anthocyanidin reductase that converts anthocyanidins (but not leucoanthocyanidins) to the corresponding 2,3-cis-2R, 3R-flavan-3-ols, epicatechin-type compounds.
