ABSTRACT

Benzoxazinoids are secondary metabolites that are effective in defence and allelopathy. They are synthesised in two subfamilies of the Poaceae and sporadically found in single species of the dicots. The biosynthesis is fully elucidated in maize; here the genes encoding the enzymes of the pathway are in physical proximity. This “biosynthetic cluster” might facilitate coordinated gene regulation. Data from *Zea mays*, *Triticum aestivum* and *Hordeum lechleri* suggest that the pathway is of monophyletic origin in the Poaceae. The branchpoint from the primary metabolism (*Bx1* gene) can be traced back to duplication and functionalisation of the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSA). Modification of the intermediates by consecutive hydroxylation is catalysed by members of a cytochrome P450 enzyme subfamily (*Bx2–Bx5*). Glucosylation by an UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT, *Bx8, Bx9*) is essential for the reduction of autotoxicity of the benzoxazinoids. In some species 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one-glucoside (DIBOA-glc) is further modified by the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase BX6 and the O-methyltransferase BX7. In the dicots *Aphelandra squarrosa, Consolida orientalis,* and *Lamium galeobdolon*, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis is analogously organised: The branchpoint is established by a homolog of TSA, P450 enzymes catalyse hydroxylations and at least the first hydroxylation reaction is identical in dicots and Poaceae, the toxic aglucon is glucosylated by an UGT. Functionally, TSA and BX1 are indole-glycerolphosphate lyases (IGLs). *Igl* genes seem to be generally duplicated in angiosperms. Modelling and biochemical characterisation of IGLs reveal that the catalytic properties of the enzyme can easily be modified by mutation. Independent evolution can be assumed for the BX1 function in dicots and Poaceae.

Plants produce a vast array of secondary metabolites. Many of these natural products are specialised metabolites that are produced only by certain taxa (Dixon, 2001). Benzoxazinoids represent protective and allelopathic metabolites that are found in a multitude of species of the family Poaceae (Gramineae) of the

monocot plants (Table 1), including the major agricultural crops maize, wheat and rye. Outside the Poales, benzoxazinoids are detected in two distant orders of the eudicots, the Ranunculales and the Lamiales. In contrast to the situation in the Poales, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in these orders is restricted to single isolated species within the families Ranunculaceae (i.e. *Consolida orientalis*), Lamiaceae (*Lamium galeobdolon*) and Plantaginaceae (*Scoparia dulcis*) (*Sicker et al.*, 2000; *Alipieva et al.*, 2003) and to several species in the Acanthaceae (*Acanthus mollis*, *Aphelandra tetragona*, *Aphelandra squarrosa*, *Blepharis edulis*; *Baumeler et al.*, 2000). DIBOA [2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one] and its C-7-methoxy derivative DIMBOA (Fig. 1) are the predominant representatives of benzoxazinoids in plants (*Niemeyer*, 1988). The end product of the benzoxazinoid biosynthesis is the glucoside that has reduced toxicity compared to the aglucon. The glucoside is stored in the vacuole; the specific glucosidase is located in the plastid. The toxic aglucon is produced upon disintegration of the cell due to pathogen or pest attack. The reactivity of DIBOA and DIMBOA with e.g. NH₂ and SH nucleophilic groups in biomolecules (*Sicker et al.*, 2000) confers protection against a wide range of herbivores, pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis is fully elucidated in maize (*Frey et al.*, 1997, 2003; *Rad et al.*, 2001; *Jonczyk et al.*, 2008), is characterised in part for wheat (*Nomura et al.*, 2002, 2005, 2008), and diploid Triticales (*Nomura et al.*, 2007) and wild barley (*Grün et al.*, 2005). Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis commences in dicots with the same precursor; however, the complete pathway remains to be elucidated (*Schullehner et al.*, 2008).

### 2. Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in maize

The benzoxazinoid biosynthetic pathway was established in maize (Fig. 1). The branchpoint reaction was defined by the isolation of the *Bx1* gene (*Frey et al.*, 1997; *Melanson et al.*, 1997) that is characterised by the benzoxazinless phenotype of the mutant maize plant (*Hamilton*, 1964). Indole-3-glycerol phosphate is converted by BX1 to indole, the first committed intermediate of the pathway. The same reaction is performed by the alpha-subunit of the tryptophan synthase (TSA) in tryptophan biosynthesis. BX1 and TSA both are indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyases (IGLs), encoded by paralogous genes. Modifications have changed the enzymatic activities of the homologs. While TSAs form a complex with the beta-subunit of the tryptophan synthase (TSB), BX1 functions as monomer, optimised for the production of free indole (*Frey et al.*, 2000). In the following, we name indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyases ‘IGL’ as a neutral designation for enzyme function, ‘BX1’ when the catalytic parameters are in the range of ZmBX1 and we restrict the name ‘TSA’ to subunits of the tryptophan synthase. Like TSA, BX1 is localised in the stroma of the chloroplast.

The following reactions in biosynthesis comprise the conversion of indole to DIBOA. The introduction of four oxygen atoms is catalysed by four cytochrome P450 dependent monoxygenases (P450s) BX2 to BX5, which are members of the CYP71 family (*Frey et al.*, 1995). Indole is converted by BX2 to indolin-2-one, which is transformed to 3-hydroxy-indolin-2-one by BX3. Subsequently an unusual ring expansion is catalysed by BX4: the conversion of 3-hydroxy-indole-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (HBOA, *Spiteller et al.*, 2001). The N-hydroxylation of HBOA to DIBOA is catalysed by BX5. All four P450s are specific with respect to the substrate and the regioselective introduction of oxygen atoms. In maize, the two UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) BX8 and BX9 specifically glucosylate benzoxazinoids (*Rad et al.*, 2001). This glucosylation of benzoxazinoids takes place prior to hydroxylation by the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase (2-ODD) BX6 (*Frey et al.*, 2003) and the O-methylation by O-methyltransferase (OMT) BX7 (*Jonczyk et al.*, 2008). DIBOA is the first toxic intermediate of the pathway. Reduction of DIBOA reactivity by glucosylation might be required in order to reduce autotoxicity and to provide a stable metabolite for further modifications by BX6 and BX7 that are localised in the cytoplasm (*Jonczyk et al.*, 2008). Mutants of *Bx8* and *Bx9* are not yet available, hence the mutant phenotype is unknown. However, the example of the maize UGT BZ1 demonstrates that mutation in a glucosyltransferase of secondary metabolism results in a phenotypic alteration (*Schiefelbein et al.*, 1988). Other examples for glucosylation of biosynthetic intermediates in plant secondary pathways are rare but occur in glucosinolate biosynthesis of *A. thaliana* (*Grubb et al.*, 2004), in loganin biosynthesis of *Lonicera japonica* (*Katano et al.*, 2001) and in aurone biosynthesis of *Antirrhinum majus* (*Nakayama et al.*, 2000).

### 3. Monophyletic origin of DIBOA biosynthesis in the grasses

In the Poaceae, the expression of the pathway is developmentally regulated and highest benzoxazinoid levels are displayed at about four days after germination, both in root and shoot. Root exudation has been shown to be an important allelopathic function and has been recognised in the 1980s for rye (*Barnes and Putnam*, 1987). While the main aglucon in maize and wheat is DIMBOA, DIBOA is predominant in rye leaves, DIMBOA and DIBOA are found in the rye root (*Copoja et al.*, 2006). DIBOA-glucoside is the final product in wild *Hordeum* species and several other species of the Poaceae (*Niemeyer et al.*, 1992).

The sequence of reaction steps to DIBOA is identical in maize, diploid and hexaploid wheat and the wild barley *Hordeum lechleri*. The genes *Bx1* to *Bx5* have been isolated from hexaploid (*Triticum aestivum*, *Nomura et al.*, 2002, 2003) and diploid wheat (*Triticum monococcum*, *Triticum urartu*, and *Triticum boeoticum*, *Nomura et al.*, 2007) and the wild barley (*H. lechleri*, *Grün et al.*, 2005).

In maize and wheat the predominant benzoxazinoid is DIMBOA-glucoside. In many other plant species DIBOA-glucoside (DIBOA-Glc) is the final product. The glucosides are transferred into the vacuole. IGP; indole-3-glycerol phosphate, TRIBOA-Glc; TRIBOA-glucoside.

encoded enzymes have been tested for *in vitro* activity and it was demonstrated that they are functional analogues of the respective genes from maize. Interestingly, although all three genomes present in hexaploid wheat express the whole set of genes, the expression pattern for A-, B- and D-genome genes is different (Nomura et al., 2005). Furthermore, the enzymes differ with respect to the catalytic efficiency. The main contribution in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat is by the B-genome.

Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the genes of DIBOA biosynthesis in the grasses are of monophyletic origin. The branchpoint gene *Bx1* can be traced back to the duplication of a TSA gene that is shared by maize, wheat and *H. lechleri* (Grüin et al., 2005). The four P450 genes *Bx2* to *Bx5* from maize, wheat and *H. lechleri* belong to one subfamily, CYP71C, of the P450 supergene family. This subfamily is not represented in *A. thaliana* and to date all 35 members originate from the Poaceae (Fig. 2). However, except for *BX2* to *BX5* enzymes, their function is unknown. It is well documented in different species that accumulation of P450 genes is caused by gene duplication and modification. Homology and conserved gene structure of *Bx2* to *Bx5* suggest that these mechanisms were active in the evolution of the P450s of DIBOA biosynthesis. In a phylogenetic analysis *BX2* to *BX5* each form a clade in the CYP71C tree (Fig. 2), indicating that the *Bx2* to *Bx5* progenitors have evolved before the divergence of the Triticeae and the Panicoideae. The *Cyp71C5* gene of maize and rice *Cyp71C16* and *Cyp71C17* are relatively closely related to *Bx2*. However, their function is unknown. No homologs of *BX3* to *BX5* are present in rice and sorghum.

A biochemical survey of 117 *Oryza sativa*, *Oryza barthii*, *Oryza glaberrima*, *Oryza latifolia*, *Oryza officinalis* varieties and wild rice species did not reveal an indication for benzoxazinoids in *Oryza* (data not shown). The situation is different in the genus *Hordeum*. DIBOA was found in 4 out of 5 *Hordeum* species. *Hordeum spontaneum* lacks benzoxazinoids but contains gramine instead, while gramine is not detectable in DIBOA containing species (Grüin et al., 2005). Both secondary metabolites are connected to tryptophan biosynthesis and function in defence. Competition for substrate flux from the same primary biosynthetic pathway may favour the selection of only one of these defence pathways. In *Hordeum spontaneum*, no *Bx*-genes are detectable by DNA hybridisation (Grüin et al., 2005). It can be assumed that the genes were present in the progenitor of *Hordeum*. The different *Hordeum* species have diverged approximately 12 Myr ago (Jacob et al., 2004). During this time of independent evolution the *Bx*-genes were lost.

DIBOA glucoside is the final product of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in several plant species including dicots (Sicker et al., 2000, see below). The toxic aglucone is produced by a specific glu-

BOA. As a donor, the 7-MeO-group facilitates N–O bond heterolysis (Hashimoto and Shudo, 1996) and the dehydration of DIMBOA (Hofmann and Sicker, 1999). The first process leads to the formation of a reactive, multi-centered cationic electrophile, the latter results in the generation of a reactive formyl donor towards –NH₂, –OH, and –SH groups. Hence, synthesising DIMBOA instead of DIBOA seems to be of evolutionary advantage for the plant by producing a more reactive end product. In this scenario DIMBOA biosynthesis might be a more recent addition to the core DIBOA pathway. This might explain the unusual position of the glucosylation in the flow of the biosynthesis. Alternatively, the last two steps of the pathway might have been lost in some species and glucosylation of the intermediate DIBOA may be required to reduce auto toxic effects. Limited data outside of maize are available for the last two steps of the pathway. It will be interesting to evaluate the evolutionary relationship of the enzymes BX6 and BX7 involved in C-7-hydroxylation and O-methylation in the Poaceae. Experiments with an inhibitor implicate that a 2-ODD catalyses the hydroxylation in position C-7 in wheat (Frey et al., 2003); however, the respective gene has not been isolated so far. The maize enzymes BX6 and BX7 perform precisely one catalytic step each in the benzoxazinoid biosynthetic pathway. Both enzymes have no close relative among the characterised members of the respective gene family; hence the evolutionary origin can not be traced back. Given that maize and wheat are distantly related species, a monophyletic origin of maize and wheat Bx6 and Bx7 genes, respectively, would argue for the ‘loss’ theory.

Fig. 2. Phylogenetic tree of CYP71C. All publicly available full-size sequences (homepage http://drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html) are represented in the tree, but only one representative sequence of TaBx2 to TaBx5 genes from hexaploid wheat is included. The phylogenetic tree is generated for the amino acid sequences using CLUSTALW (http://clustalw.genome.jp), based on the Neighbor Joining (NJ) algorithm (Saitou and Nei, 1987). The four Bx genes belong to four individual clades (highlighted by colour). Only sequences from benzoxazinoid-producing plants appear in these four clades. The clustering follows function rather than plant phylogeny; the identity of the respective proteins from maize and wheat is between 76% and 79%, the identity of maize BX2 to BX5 is between 45% and 67%. The prefix refers to the plant species: Hl, Hordeum lechleri; Os, Oryza sativa; Lr, Lolium rigidum; Ta, Triticum aestivum; Tm, Triticum monococcum; Tp, Thinopyrum ponticum; Zm, Zea mays.

cosidase (e.g. rye, Nikus et al., 2003). Toxicity depends largely on the reactivity of both the N-hydroxyl function, which occurs rarely in natural products, and the presence of a cyclic hemiacetal unit. DIBOA and DIMBOA function as enzyme inhibitor of, e.g. α-chymotrypsin (Cuevas et al., 1990), aphid cholinesterase (Cuevas and Niemeyer, 1993) and plasma membrane H⁺-ATPase (Friebe et al., 1997). DIMBOA is a distinctively more reactive compound than DI-

4. Benzoxazinoid biosynthetic genes form a functional cluster in the grasses

In maize, all genes of the core pathway and Bx6 are linked within 6 cM on the short arm of chromosome 4 (Fig. 3). The OMT Bx7 is more loosely associated but also located on the short arm of chromosome 4. The Bx gene cluster is split into two parts in wheat (Nomura et al., 2002). The wheat genes Bx3, Bx4 and Bx5 map to the short arm of chromosome 5 in the A-, B- and D-genome, respectively; an additional Bx3 copy was detected on the long arm of chromosome 5B. Wheat chromosome 5 and maize chromosome 4 are partial homeologous. The wheat genes Bx1 and Bx2 are located in close proximity (Nomura et al., 2003). The Bx1and Bx2 locations are in homeologous regions in the A-, B-, D-genomes (short arm of the A-genome long arm in the B- and D-genome). In rye, the same split into two groups of genes was detected and the location is in homeologous positions to wheat (Nomura et al., 2002). The hypothesis is that originally the Bx genes formed a cluster. A reciprocal translocation in the ancestor of wheat and rye would then explain the separation in two parts in this lineages (Nomura et al., 2002).

Exact physical distances are known for ZmBx1 and ZmBx2 (2.5 kb, Frey et al., 1997), and TaBx3 and TaBx4 (7–11 kb in the three genomes, Nomura et al., 2008); the genes are arranged head to tail in both cases. ZmBx8 and ZmBx1 are separated by 44 kb and arranged head to head. Both, wheat and maize have large genomes (Sandhu and Gill, 2002) and genes are separated by large stretches of repetitive elements. The close neighbouring of the Bx genes is an extraordinary feature. Clusters of genes are often detected in gene families as a result of duplication and therefore the clustering of the P450 genes Bx2 to Bx5 is not unexpected. However, enzymes belonging to five different functional classes are assembled in the Bx cluster in maize. The generation of the biosynthetic cluster is probably not the result of an accidental neighbourhood but might have implications on the expression of the genes. Genes for most secondary pathways that have been characterised to date are generally unlinked (e.g. anthocyanin biosynthesis). However, exam-

Fig. 3. Genomic location of the Bx genes. The genes of the DIBOA-glucoside pathway, Bx1 to Bx5 and Bx8 map within 4 centiMorgan to the short arm of chromosome 4 (grey box). The second glucosyltransferase gene, Bx9, is found on chromosome 1. The map positions are according to the Genetic 2005 map of chromosome 4 by E. Coe. (www.maizegdb.org). The positions of the reference markers umc1 and adh2 are given. Bold numbers refer to centiMorgan.

samples for gene clusters of secondary biosynthetic pathways are emerging. Recently, a cluster of seven biosynthetic genes was defined for avenacins ([Qi et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkh268); [Mylona et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn577)), defence-related secondary metabolites in diploid oat. Another example is given by the momilactone biosynthesis in rice ([Wilderman et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0405835101)). Even more, prediction of clustering was one criterion for the isolation of genes of the triterpene thalianol biosynthetic pathway in *A. thaliana* ([Field and Osbourn, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern145)). Perhaps, clustering of the genes is of selective advantage in a population once beneficial allelic combinations are established in coupling phase. Furthermore, the genes of these pathways are co-expressed and can be considered as “operon-like” gene clusters ([Field and Osbourn, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern145)). Investigations in *A. thaliana* have shown significant co-regulation of adjacent genes ([Zhan et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl1030); [Ren et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki709)). Changes in chromatin structure may alter the expression status of gene clusters and coordinated regulation of the pathway might be facilitated by physical proximity of the genes.

### 5. Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in dicots plants

DIBOA and its glucoside are predominant in benzoxazinoid-producing dicot plants; DIMBOA is rarely found ([Table 1](#table:1); [Sicker et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00206-8)). Benzoxazinoids are primarily synthesised in the seedlings of the Poaceae. In this stage, the DIMBOA concentration exceeds the total tryptophan concentration in maize by a factor of 20 ([Frey et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1007/s004250050157)). In grass seeds, this massive biosynthesis during germination is facilitated by the energy-rich endosperm. In contrast to the Poaceae, in dicots benzoxazinoids are not restricted to seedlings or young plants but may be found in all aerial parts or the root throughout plant development ([Schullehner et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.04.016)). The benzoxazinoid concentrations may be as high as in the seedlings of the grasses (30 mmol/kg fr. wt), and very likely benzoxazinoids function also as defence chemicals. In the root, benzoxazinoids are present in low concentrations (*A. squarrosa*, *L. galeobdolon*) or not detectable (*C. orientalis*), allelopathic function via root exudation may therefore not be relevant in dicots.

### 6. Branchpoint reaction of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis is shared by dicot and monocot plants

Three benzoxazinoid-producing species, *C. orientalis* (larkspur), *L. galeobdolon* (yellow archangel) and *A. squarrosa* (zebra plant), from two families (Ranunculaceae and Lamiaceae) have been characterised with respect to the biosynthetic pathway. It has been shown that indole is the first committed intermediate of the pathway. For each of these plants several *Igl*-genes were isolated and characterised. One enzyme that efficiently produces indole and could potentially serve as branchpoint enzyme was identified for each species ([Schullehner et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.04.016)). However, only the *C. orientalis* enzyme CoBX1 has similar catalytic properties as the maize and wheat BX1 enzymes. Since CoBX1 is specifically expressed in tissues that contain high benzoxazinoid levels, it is most probably the first specific enzyme of DIBOA biosynthesis in *C. orientalis*. A phylogenetic analysis of TSA enzymes from maize and *A. thaliana*, BX1 enzymes from maize and *C. orientalis* and the IGLs from *L. galeobdolon* and *A. squarrosa* shows that the members of these IGL classes have evolved independently ([Schullehner et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.04.016)). In particular, ZmBX1 and CoBX1 are not closely related. The branchpoint reaction of DIBOA biosynthesis uses the same enzyme function in the grasses and in dicots, but these functions evolved independently ([Schullehner et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.04.016)).

*C. orientalis* and *L. galeobdolon* microsomes use indole as a substrate to produce indolin-2-one in a strictly NADPH-dependent manner ([Schullehner et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.04.016)). This is an indication that the second reaction of DIBOA biosynthesis in dicots is accomplished in a similar manner as in the grasses. The isolation of other *Bx* genes from *C. orientalis* and *L. galeobdolon* is underway. Preliminary results indicate that, like in the grasses, an UDP-glucosyltransferase catalyses benzoxazinoid-glucoside formation. Hence, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis would, in principle, appear to follow the same chemical route in dicots and monocots. The question whether monophyletic or independent evolution underlies this analogy can only be answered if more genes of the pathway are characterised.

### 7. Assembly of a defence-related secondary metabolic pathway

Three modules of a secondary biosynthetic pathway can be distinguished: the branchpoint reaction, chemical modification leading to a biological active compound, and detoxification. Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis is prototypic for these sequential events.

The pathway-specific branchpoint is generated by neo-functionalisation of a gene duplicate originating from primary metabolism. Beside the recruitment of *Bx1* from tryptophan biosynthesis, an example for this mechanism is found in the biosynthesis of pyrrolizidine alkaloids ([Ober and Hartmann, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1007/s002940050486)) by the pair deoxyhypusine synthase (primary metabolism) and homospermidine synthase (secondary metabolism). A third example concerns an alternative pathway of ester formation in phenylpropan metabolism that is facilitated by acyltransferases accepting 1-O-β-acetal esters (1-O-β-glucose esters) as acyl donors instead of coenzyme A. These thioesters acyltransferases originate from serine carboxypeptidases by gene duplication ([Milkowski and Strack, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00294-004-0559-0)).

P450 enzymes then chemically modify indole, the first specific intermediate to produce toxic DIBOA. Interestingly, *Bx2* to *Bx5* belong to the CYP71 clan that encodes predominantly enzymes for secondary metabolism ([Nelson et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/5.1.1)). Nearly one half of all modern angiosperm P450 genes belong to the CYP71 clan; the proliferation of the clan coincided with the explosion of terrestrial vascular plants approximately 425 million years ago. Many of the clan families and in particular, subfamilies appear to be species specific and represent the success in recruiting P450 enzymes for evolutionary novelty ([Nelson, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbl004)).

An intrinsic feature of defence-related secondary metabolites is that its reactivity results in autotoxicity ([Sahi et al., 1995](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00032067)). Glycosylation can reduce the reactivity (e.g. benzoxazinoids) and is discussed as an essential requirement for transport across the tonoplast into the vacuole. In maize and petunia, cyanidine-3-glucoside is produced by a specific UGT, transported to the tonoplast by a carrier protein and delivered to a multidrug resistance-like protein in the vacuolar membrane ([Goodman et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0405835101)). In *A. thaliana* 120 UGTs are annotated and none of these can efficiently detoxify DIBOA or DIMBOA ([Rad et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1007/s002940050486)). Hence, detoxification is pathway-specific and an integral part of the biosynthesis. The innate importance of detoxification by glucosyltransferases is indicated by the fact that *Bx8* and *Bx9* are the only duplicate genes in the pathway, encoding redundant function. It is tempting to speculate that evolution of secondary metabolic pathways can only happen in the presence of a detoxifying function.

### 8. Generation of indole by neofunctionalisation of TSAs

Two functionally unrelated enzyme classes are capable of synthesising indole, indole-3-glycerolphosphate lyase and tryptophanase. In bacteria, the only IGL-enzyme, TSA, is not active as a monomer and hence is not capable to efficiently produce indole; bacteria use tryptophanase for biosynthesis of free indole. Conversely, tryptophanase is not present in plants, but plant IGLs often occur as monomeric enzymes. Only one *Igl*-sequence, most probably representing a TSA, is

at present annotated in *Ostreococcus, Chlamydomonas, Physcomitrella, Selaginella*, and *Gingko*. Duplication of the gene seems to be a feature of angiosperms. At least two *Igl*-genes are present in all monocots and eudicots investigated so far (*Kriechbaumer et al.*, 2008; *Schullehner et al.*, 2008, Fießelmann, unpublished), and at least one of these has a significantly higher efficiency in indole formation compared with bacteria and plant TSAs (*E. coli* and *S. typhimurium, Weischet and Kirschner*, 1976; *A. thaliana, Schullehner et al.*, 2008; and *Z. mays, Kriechbaumer et al.*, 2008; respectively). BX1-type IGLs (*k*~cat~ value beyond 0.5 s^−1^) have been characterised in the Poaceae maize, wheat, *H. lechleri, Sorghum bicolor* and *Oryza sativa* (*Frey et al.*, 1997, 2000; *Nomura et al.*, 2005; *Grün et al.*, 2005; and A. Fießelmann, unpublished) and the Ranunculaceae *C. orientalis* (*Schullehner et al.*, 2008). BX1 enzymes in the Poaceae function in DIBOA biosynthesis or deliver volatile indole in the tritrophic interaction, e.g. ZmIGL (*Frey et al.*, 2000). No specific signature distinguishing between a ‘BX1’-type and ‘TSA’-type can be detected in the primary amino acid sequence. IGL structures were modelled (*Schullehner et al.*, 2008) based on X-ray structures of bacterial TSA and ZmBX1 (*Kulik et al.*, 2005). A correlation analysis between a structural feature and enzyme activity revealed one essential amino acid position: critical for the efficiency of the indole biosynthesis appears to be the orientation of the glutamate (position StTSA 49, *Salmonella typhimurium* TSA) that is directly involved in catalysis for the amino acid residue in the active center. In BX1 enzymes valin or leucin pushes the glutamate into the substrate-binding pocket, IGLs with intermediate activity have an amino acid in the respective site that allows a switch between active and an inactive conformation (e.g. alanine). The low catalytic activity of the *Arabidopsis* TSA monomer is explained by a serine in this position that pulls the glutamate out of the substrate cavern (*Schullehner et al.*, 2008). Hence, the catalytic properties of IGL enzymes can easily be changed by mutation. The frequent occurrence of IGLs in angiosperms that efficiently can produce indole implies an ecological function. Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis and volatile emission might be just two of several modes of indole utilisation in plants.

### 9. Conclusions

Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis appears to follow the same chemical route in dicots and monocots. The question whether monophyletic or independent evolution underlies this analogy can only be answered by isolation of the complete set of pathway genes. The comparison of the BX1 enzymes of the grasses and dicots reveals that the enzymes have no apparent monophyletic origin and were recruited independently. It will be interesting to determine the phylogenetic relationship of P450s in benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, specifically, to evaluate presence and function of CYP71C subfamily members in dicot plants. Glucosylation plays a crucial role in secondary metabolite biosynthesis by attenuating phytotoxicity and a large arsenal of glucosyltransferases distinguishes plants. A comparison of dicot and monocot glucosyltransferases of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis can provide insight in the structural premises for the recruitment of this essential function.

Monika Frey studied Biology at the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen, got her Diploma in Genetics in 1980, and her Dr. rer. nat in Biology in 1984 working in the lab of Vera Hemleben. In 1985 she joined the Max-Planck-Institut für Züchtungsforschung (MPIZ), Department of Molecular Plant Genetics, as a Bayer fellow and was working on a BMBF-project from 1988 on. Her scientific interest changed during this time at the MPIZ from the characterisation of transposable elements of maize to the investigation of resistance in this plant. Since 1993 she is working at the Lehrstuhl für Genetik, Life Science Center, Technische Universität München and holds the position of an Academic Director. Her main interest is in the investigation of defence related secondary metabolite biosynthesis and the possibilities to strengthen plant defence mechanisms. She made major contribution to the elucidation of DIMBOA biosynthesis in grasses and dicots.


Katrin Schullehner received her Diploma in Agricultural Sciences, focus on Agricultural Biology, at the Center of Life and Food Sciences, Weihenstephan, Technische Universität München, in 2003. Her thesis with the subject “Molecular analysis of genetic variation in potato” was awarded best of the year. Her Ph.D. studies were carried out at the Lehrstuhl für Genetik, Center of Life and Food Sciences, Weihenstephan, Technische Universität München. Her Ph.D. thesis focused on characterisation of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in dicot plants. She isolated genes involved in the biosynthesis and determined the catalytic properties. She defended her thesis in November 2007. Since January 2008 she holds a position at Phytowelt, Green Technologies GmbH, Cologne.


Regina Dick received her MSc degree in Molecular Biotechnology in 2007 from the Technische Universität München. The Master Thesis at the Lehrstuhl für Genetik, Life Science Center, focused on the protein purification of the UDPG-glycosyltransferase detoxifying the benzoxazinoid DIBOA from *Consolidata orientalis* (larkspur) and *Lamium galeobdolon* (yellow archangel). Since 2007 she is carrying out her PhD studies concerning the evolution of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in dicots.


Andreas Fiesselmann focused in his Diploma thesis at the Lehrstuhl für Genetik, Life Science Center, on the isolation of transcriptional regulators from maize and received his degree in 2004 from the Technische Universität München. His PhD thesis, to be defended in May 2009, has been carried out at pthe same institution. The studies were focused on the isolation and characterisation of indole-3-glycerolphosphate lyases from Poaceae.


Alfons Gierl obtained his Dr. rer. nat in Biology (1982) from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. Ph.D. study was done at Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried in the lab of Wolfram Zillig. After a postdoctoral year in the same lab, he joined Heinz Saedler’s Department of Molecular Plant Genetics at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plant Breeding in Cologne. The studies of plant transposable elements resulted in the determination of the complete structure and the elucidation of the transposition mechanism of McClintock’s *En/Spm* element. The detailed characterization of transposase function in transgenic tobacco and the introduction of *En/Spm* into Arabidopsis provided the bases for using this transposon for gene tagging and reverse genetic systems. Since 1993 he became full Professor at the Technische Universität München and Director of the Department of Genetics. Gene tagging with maize transposons led into the analysis of DIMBOA biosynthesis, a plant secondary metabolic pathway that confers broad pest resistance to cereals. By now, Alfons Gierl and his team have identified and functionally characterised the complete set of eight genes that encode benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in maize and other grasses. An evolutionary highlight was the discovery of *Bx1* gene function in DIMBOA biosynthesis. BX1 catalyzes the branch point reaction from primary metabolism, has evolved from tryptophan synthase, and its structure was determined. The *Bx1* homologue *Igl* encodes an enzyme with an identical function, however, this maize gene is involved in the production of volatile signals that are emitted after herbivore damage.
