### Abstract

Neuroactive steroids, such as 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone (3α,5α-THP) and 3α,5α-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone have been shown to be synthesized from progesterone in animal brains. Comparison of kinetic constants for the neuroactive steroids and their precursors among four human 3(20)α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (AKR1C1–AKR1C4) suggests that AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 are involved in the catabolism and synthesis, respectively, of the neuroactive steroids in the human brain. In our efforts to identify agents that would specifically inhibit the two enzymes, benz bromarone and 3′,3″,5′,5″-tetrabromophenolphthalein were found to be relatively selective and potent inhibitors of AKR1C1. Kinetic analyses in the oxidoreduction catalyzed by AKR1C1 in the presence of the inhibitors suggest that the inhibitors bind to the enzyme–NADP(H) complex ($K_{i}=0.7$ nM) in the ordered bi-bi pathway, including an isomerization step. The inhibitors effectively also decreased the reduction of 3α,5α-THP to its 20α-hydroxy metabolite in HepG2 cells treated with ethacrynic acid.

### 1. Introduction

Neuroactive steroids, naturally occurring metabolites of endogenous steroid hormones, have been shown to alter neuronal excitability through interaction with specific neurotransmitter receptors [1]. The term ‘neurosteroids’ refers to steroids that accumulate and are synthesized in the brain and includes the neuroactive steroids and their metabolites that are inactive on neural tissues. Of the neuroactive steroids, 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone (3α,5α-THP) and 3α,5α-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3α,5α-THDOC) are the most potent and efficacious of known positive allosteric modulators of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA$_{\text{A}}$) receptors [1–3]. 3α,5α-THP and 3α,5α-THDOC are synthesized from progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, respectively, through the respective

intermediates, 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP) and 5α-dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (5α-DHDOC). The two sequential enzymatic reactions are catalyzed by steroid 5α-reductase and cytosolic NADPH-dependent 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD). On the other hand, microsomal NAD⁺-dependent 3α-HSD oxidizes 3α,5α-THP and 3α,5α-THDOC back to 5α-DHP and 5α-DHDOC and is thought to be involved in the catabolism of the potent GABAergic steroids. The enzymes have been studied mostly in animal tissues, but little is known the roles of the human enzymes in the neurosteroid metabolism. Four NADP(H)-dependent enzymes exhibiting 3α-HSD activity, termed AKR1C1–AKR1C4, have been identified in human tissues [4–8]. The enzymes share >83% amino acid sequence identity and have been shown to exhibit broad substrate specificities for 3α-, 17β- and 20α-hydroxysteroids [9]. This suggests that the enzymes not only play roles in the synthesis of the neuroactive steroids, but also convert them into less neuroactive 3α,20α-dihydroxypregnanes [2] by exhibiting their 20α-HSD activities. Therefore, we have examined substrate specificity of the four enzymes for the neuroactive steroids and their precursors. Furthermore, we have found that benz bromarone (BZB) and 3′,3″,5′,5″-tetrabromophenolphthalein (TBPP) potently inhibit AKR1C1 and examined the specificity in terms of the structure of inhibitor molecule, kinetic inhibition mechanism and binding site of the enzyme.

### 2. Materials and methods

#### 2.1. Chemicals

Drugs, steroids and cell culture media were obtained from Sigma Chemicals and [9,11,12-³H] 3α,5α-THP (65 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Daiichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). BZB acetate and TBPP diacetate were synthesized by adding acetic anhydride into the pyridine solutions of BZB and TBPP and recrystallized from ethanol. The structures of the acetates were confirmed by NMR and Mass spectral analyses. All of the other chemicals used were of the highest grade available.

#### 2.2. Enzymes and their assays

The recombinant AKR1C1 [10], AKR1C2 [11], AKR1C3 [12], AKR1C4 [13], L54V mutant of AKR1C1 [14] and chimeric enzymes with the C-terminal 39 residues between AKR1C1 and AKR1C4 [10] were prepared and purified to homogeneity as previously described. The reductase activities of the enzymes were assayed in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 containing 0.1 mM NADPH, substrate and enzyme (total volume of 2.0 ml), by measuring the rate of change in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm. The dehydrogenase activity was determined with 0.25 mM NADP⁺ as the coenzyme in the above reaction mixture, unless otherwise noted. Enzyme activity (1 U) was defined as the amount that catalyzes the oxidation or formation of 1 μmol of NADPH per minute at 25 °C.

The kinetic mechanism and parameters of AKR1C1 in both 5β-pregn-3α-ol-20-one (3α,5β-THP) reduction and 5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol oxidation were analyzed according to initial velocity measurement described by Segel [15]. The inhibitor constants, \( K_{\text{is}} \) (slope effect) and \( K_{\text{ii}} \) (intercept effect), were estimated from the Dixon plot and/or Cornish-Bowden plot of the velocities obtained with four concentrations of the inhibitor. The kinetic constants and IC₅₀ (concentrations required for 50% inhibition) values are expressed as the means of at least three determinations.

#### 2.3. Product identification

The reaction was conducted in 0.1 ml systems containing 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2.0 mM NADPH, 10 μM [³H]-labeled 3α,5α-THP (1 μCi) and enzyme (2 μg). The oxidation of the steroid was performed with potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 and NADP⁺ as the buffer and coenzyme in the above reaction mixture. The substrate and products were extracted into 0.4 ml ethyl acetate 15, 30 and 60 min after the reaction was started at 37 °C and analyzed by TLC in toluene/ethyl acetate (2:1, v/v). The positions of the substrate and products were confirmed by authentic steroids that were simultaneously applied to the same TLC plate and visualized by spraying with an ethanol/

H₂SO₄ (1:1, v/v) solution and heating at 110 °C. The TLC plate was exposed to [³H]-Imaging Plate for 3 h and then analyzed by BAS™ system (BAS-1500, Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). The products of oxidation of the other steroids by the enzyme were identified with the non-labeled substrates (each 15 μM) in a 20-fold scale of the above reaction mixture as described [16].

### 2.4. Cell culture and treatment

HepG2 hepatoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. After the cells were treated with 50 μM ethacrynic acid for 24 h [17], they were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated for 1 h in the medium with or without an inhibitor. The steroid metabolism in the cells was initiated by the addition of 30 μM [³H]-labeled 3α,5α-THP (1 μCi) and after 6-h incubation the steroids in the medium were measured as described above. The isolation of cellular RNA and RT-PCR were performed as described previously [18].

### 3. Results and discussion

#### 3.1. Substrate specificity of AKR1C enzymes and their roles in the neurosteroid metabolism

Potent modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are 3α,5α-THP, 3α,5β-THP and 3α,5α-THDOC [1,2]. AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C4 catalyzed the oxidation of the neuroactive steroids and their 3-ketosteroid precursors, except that they did not reduce 3α,5α-THDOC. The products identified in the oxidation are listed as the respective pair of the substrate and product in Table 1. It should be noted that in the reduction of 5α-DHP or 5β-DHP, both 3α-hydroxy and 20α-hydroxy metabolites were initially formed and then 5α- or 5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol was detected by prolonging the incubation. Similarly, in the oxidation of 5α- or 5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol, 5α-DHP or 5β-DHP was detected as well as the initial products, the 3- and 20-keto metabolites. Thus, the three enzymes exhibited both 3α- and 20α-HSD activities for the pregnanes. Additionally, progesterone was converted into 4-pregnen-20α-ol-3-one by AKR1C1 and one product, 3α,5α-THDOC, was also formed in the reduction of 5α-DHDOC by AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C4. This suggests that the presence of a double bond at position 4 or 21-hydroxy group of the steroid molecule prevents the binding to the active sites of the enzymes from its D-ring side.

Two enzymes, steroid 5α-reductase and 3α-HSD, have been shown to be responsible for the synthesis of the neuroactive steroids from progesterone in animal brain, although an additional step of hydroxylation of progesterone by steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) is included in the synthesis of 3α,5α-THDOC (Fig. 1). In the human brain, mRNAs for steroid 5α-reductase type 1 [19], AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 [6,9,18] are expressed to a large extent, while AKR1C4 is liver-specific. The mRNA for CYP21 is detected in the brain, but its expression level is very low [20]. Therefore, at least 3α,5α-THP has been thought to

be synthesized in human brain through the pathway demonstrated in rodent brains [19]. The present kinetic data suggest that AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 play different roles in the cerebral metabolism of the neurosteroids. AKR1C1 efficiently reduced 3α, 5α-THP, 3α, 5β-THP and their precursors (progesterone, 5α-DHP and 5β-DHP), predominantly into the corresponding 20α-hydroxysteroids. Since the affinities of the 20α-hydroxypregnanes for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are weak [2], this enzyme may decrease the concentrations of the neuroactive steroids in the brain by eliminating their precursors from the biosynthesis pathways and by directly inactivating 3α, 5α-THP and 3α, 5β-THP. On the other hand, AKR1C2 reduced 5α-DHP, 5β-DHP and 5α-DHDOC to the corresponding neuroactive steroids and the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> values for the precursors were much higher than those for the neuroactive steroids. Thus, AKR1C2 may contribute to the synthesis of the neurosteroids rather than their catabolism. AKR1C3 did not show significant activities for the neurosteroids, and may function in the metabolism of prostaglandins [14] and/or androgens [8,9]. Liver-specific AKR1C4 may control the concentrations of circulating neuroactive steroids and androgens.

3.2. Selective and potent inhibitors of AKR1C1

Clinical investigations provide evidence for an involvement of the neuroactive steroids in conditions such as premenstrual syndrome, catamenial epilepsy and depressive disorders [19]. Premenstrual syndrome has been suggested to be associated with abrupt decline in progesterone and 3α, 5α-THP through increased production of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α4 subunit [21]. It is possible that inhibitors specific for AKR1C1 are useful for therapeutic management of such disorders because they increase 3α, 5α-THP level by preventing the catabolism of the neuroactive steroid and its precursors. AKR1C1 was the only an enzyme that effectively inactivates progesterone and thereby the inhibitors of this enzyme may also help to maintain pregnancy and to prevent premenstrual syndrome. Therefore, we searched for selective and potent inhibitors of AKR1C1 and found BZB and TBPP to act as such inhibitors.

Table 2 summarizes representative inhibitors of AKR1C1–AKR1C4 discovered after the screening of ≈300 compounds. The IC₅₀ values for BZB and TBPP were much lower than those for known AKR1C1 inhibitors, such as 1,10-phenanthroline,

medazepam and medroxyprogesterone acetate and the inhibition was relatively specific for AKR1C1. The two compounds also showed low or no inhibitory activity for the other AKR family enzymes, such as AKR1C6, AKR1C9, AKR1A1

Fig. 3. Metabolism of 3α,5α-THP in HepG2 cells treated with ethacrynic acid. (A) The cells were cultured in the absence (.....) or presence (-) of 50 μM ethacrynic acid for 24 h and then [³H]-labeled 3α,5α-THP was added. After 6 h, the metabolites in the medium of the culture were analyzed. The time-dependent expression of the mRNAs for AKR1C1 (1C1) and β-actin (βA) in the cells by ethacrynic acid is shown in the inset. (B) TLC chromatograms of the metabolites in the medium.

and AKR1B1 and the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family enzymes, such as human monomeric carbonyl reductase, L-xylulose reductase and hamster P26h protein (data not shown).

Derivatives of benzofuran or dibromophenyl ring of BZB showed low inhibitory potency for AKR1C1 (Fig. 2). Amiodarone, that structurally mimics BZB, did not inhibit the enzyme at 10 μM concentration. Several phenolphthalein derivatives showed lower inhibition than TBPP. Of particular interest, the 4-fold higher IC₅₀ value of 3′,3″,5′,5″-tetraiodophenolphthalein relative to that of TBPP, suggesting the importance of the bromo group for the potent inhibition. The IC₅₀ values for the acetates of BZB and TBPP were about 10-fold higher than those of the parent compounds. The results suggest that the existence of the dibromo-phenol part, together with hydrophobic benzo-furan or phthalein ring, in the inhibitor molecule is a specific structural requisite for the potent inhibitor of AKR1C1.

The effects of BZB and TBPP on the metabolism of 3α,5α-THP in cultured cells were examined. HepG2 cells have been shown to express

AKR1C1–AKR1C4, of which AKR1C1 is significantly induced by ethacrynic acid [17]. Therefore, we chose HepG2 cells treated with ethacrynic acid to examine the efficacy of the inhibitors on AKR1C1 in the intact cells. In the non-treated cells [³H]-labeled 3α,5α-THP was reduced mainly to 5α-pregnane-3α,20α-diol, which indicates that the enzyme acts as a reductase in the cells. The treatment of HepG2 cells with ethacrynic acid caused about 10-fold increase in expression of mRNA for AKR1C1 and significantly accelerated the conversion of 3α,5α-THP into 5α-pregnane-3α,20α-diol, not into 5α-DHP (Fig. 3A). BZB and TBPP dose-dependently inhibited the reduction of 3α,5α-THP in cells treated with ethacrynic acid (Fig. 3B). Inhibition percentages for 0.1, 1.0 and 10 μM BZB were 48, 77 and 86%, respectively, and the respective values for TBPP were 40, 70 and 84%. The results suggest that the metabolism of 3α,5α-THP into 5α-pregnane-3α,20α-diol in the cells is mediated by AKR1C1 and the permeability of BZB and TBPP across cell membranes is also high.

### 3.3. Inhibition mechanism by BZB and TBPP

The dehydrogenation of 5β-pregn-20α-ol-3-one by AKR1C1 was inhibited by BZB and TBPP, uncompetitively with respect to NADP⁺ ($K_{\text{ii}} = 2.3$ and 8.8 nM, respectively) and competitively with respect to the substrate ($K_{\text{is}} = 0.70$ and 0.66 nM, respectively) in the presence of a saturated concentration of the substrate or coenzyme at pH 7.0. In the reduction of 3α,5β-THP, the two inhibitors showed uncompetitive inhibition patterns with respect to both NADPH and the substrate. To explore the mechanism of inhibition by BZB and TBPP, we examined the steady-state kinetic mechanism of AKR1C1 in the forward (NADPH-linked 3α,5β-THP reduction) and reverse (NADP⁺-linked 5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol oxidation) directions at pH 7.0. The double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus NADPH concentration at five fixed levels of 3α,5β-THP yielded a series of intersecting lines. Similar patterns of initial velocity were observed in the reverse reaction (data not shown). The results are consistent with a reaction mechanism that proceeds in a sequential manner. The kinetic constants calculated from the secondary plots of the initial data were as follows. The Michaelis constants ($K_{\text{m}}$) for NADPH, 3α,5β-THP, NADP⁺ and 5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol were 2.1, 1.2, 0.9 and 1.1 μM, respectively; inhibition constants ($K_{\text{i}}$) for NADPH and NADP⁺ were 0.8 and 4.6 μM, respectively; and maximum velocities for the forward ($V_1$) and reverse ($V_2$) reactions were 0.20 and 0.21 U/mg, respectively. Although we did not analyze product inhibition patterns, NADP(H) binding to AKR1C1 was confirmed by significant decrease in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the enzyme. The reaction catalyzed by AKR1C2, which differs from AKR1C1 only by seven amino acids, follows an ordered bi-bi mechanism [22], which is supported by a recent crystallographic study of the enzyme [23]. Thus, the kinetic mechanism for AKR1C1 appears most likely to be the ordered sequential mechanism, where NADPH binds first and NADP⁺ leaves last. However, the inhibition patterns of BZB and TBPP suggest that the kinetic mechanism is not a compulsory ordered bi-bi mechanism. If an ordered bi-bi mechanism with no isomerization is operating, the relationships between different constants are:

(1)
$$
V_1 K_i^A / V_2 K_m^A \geq 1
$$

and

(2)
$$
V_2 K_i^Q / V_1 K_m^Q \geq 1
$$

where $A$ is the substrate which binds to the enzyme first and $Q$ is the product which leaves last [24]. Inserting the values for reactions by AKR1C1 into Eq. (1), the value of $V_1 K_i^A / V_2 K_m^A$ was calculated to be 0.35, which does not hold the relationship, although the second relationship gave 5.3. The failure of either of the two equations to hold experimentally provides evidence of isomerization [24]. Therefore, the reaction catalyzed by AKR1C1 probably follows an ordered bi-bi mechanism with coenzyme-induced isomerization and BZB or TBPP may bind to a site of the binary NADP(H)-enzyme complexes, although it remains unknown whether the inhibitors bind to the binary complexes before or after isomerization.

### 3.4. Binding site of BZB and TBPP on AKR1C1

To test whether the BZB-binding site of AKR1C1 overlaps with the TBPP-binding site, we first examined the kinetics of inhibition using a mixture of the two different inhibitors, as described by Segel [15]. The plots of $1/V$ versus BZB concentration (5–20 nM) at two fixed levels (20 and 50 nM) of TBPP were parallel. Hexestrol, flufenamic acid and medroxyprogesterone acetate have been known to be competitive inhibitors of AKR1C1 with respect to the alcohol substrate and 1,10-phenanthroline and medazepam are noncompetitive inhibitors [10,16]. Similar parallel lines were observed in the plots of $1/V$ versus BZB concentration at two different concentrations of either of the known competitive inhibitors, whereas the lines in the plots BZB mixed with 1,10-phenanthroline or medazepam were not parallel (data not shown). The results suggest that BZB, TBPP and the known competitive inhibitors compete a site, probably the substrate-binding site, of AKR1C1, which is distinct from the binding site for 1,10-phenanthroline and medazepam.

Fig. 4. Effect of pH on the inhibition of AKR1C1 by BZB, TBPP and other inhibitors. The dehydrogenase activity of the enzyme was assayed with 0.1 mM S-tetralol as the substrate in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffers that were prepared by mixing solutions of H₃PO₄ and K₃PO₄. Inhibitors: 25 nM BZB (▲), 25 nM TBPP (△), 8 μM hexestrol (□), 1.0 μM medroxyprogesterone acetate (■), 0.4 μM BZB acetate (◇), 0.3 μM TBPP diacetate (◆), 0.12 μM o-cresolphthalein (●) and 0.6 μM phenolphthalein (○).

Next, we compared the inhibitory effects of BZB and TBPP on the wild-type and mutant AKR1C1s. We previously reported that the replacement of Leu54 of AKR1C1 with Val (L54V) [14] and chimeric enzymes, that exchanged the C-terminal 39 residues between AKR1C1 and AKR1C4 [10], result in remarkable changes in the kinetic constants for substrates and inhibitor sensitivity. Recently, the importance of the residues at position 54 and in the C-terminal region as components of the substrate-binding pocket has been shown by the crystallographic study of AKR1C2 [23]. The L54V mutant became resistant to the inhibition by BZB and TBPP, showing the respective IC₅₀ values of 0.18 and 3.9 μM. The chimeric AKR1C1 with the C-terminal 39 residues of AKR1C4 was still sensitive to BZB (IC₅₀ value of 0.058 μM), but showed low sensitivity to TBPP (IC₅₀ value of 0.35 μM). The chimeric AKR1C4 with the C-terminal 39 residues of AKR1C1 resulted in almost the opposite effect of the chimeric AKR1C1: The IC₅₀ values for BZB and TBPP were 1.0 and 0.10 μM, respectively for this chimeric enzyme and the respective values were 0.73 and 1.0 μM for AKR1C4. Thus, although both BZB and TBPP bind to the substrate-binding site of AKR1C1, the interactions of the two inhibitor molecules with the C-terminal residues are different. The additional dibromophenol moiety of TBPP compared to BZB may be responsible for the interaction with the C-terminal residues.

The pKₐ value of BZB is 5.70 due to the hydroxyl group on the dibromophenyl ring, and TBPP is also thought to have a similar pKₐ value in addition to that due to the phthalin ring. To know the effect of dissociation of the hydroxyl group on the inhibitory potency of BZB and TBPP, we compared pH dependency of the inhibition of the S-tetralol dehydrogenase activity of AKR1C1 by several inhibitors (Fig. 4). The lowering of the pH values significantly increased the inhibitory potency of both BZB and TBPP, which is contrast to the pH dependency of hexestrol, medroxyprogesterone acetate and phenolphthalein. This seems to reveal that the protonated form of the hydroxyl group of BZB or TBPP is the inhibitory species of the inhibitor molecules. However, similar pH dependency was observed with BZB acetate and TBPP diacetate, which do not have the dissociative hydroxyl group. We speculate that acidic residue(s) are involved in the binding of BZB or TBPP to AKR1C1 and may be key residues for the potent inhibition by the compounds. To clarify such amino acid residues,
site-directed mutagenesis targeting several Asp and His residues on the enzyme and crystallization of the enzyme–coenzyme–inhibitor complex are now in progress.
