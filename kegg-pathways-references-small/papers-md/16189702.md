**Introduction**

The last 5 years has witnessed some major advances in the molecular characterisation of the well-differentiated carcinomas of the thyroid derived from follicular cells. The most important findings were the following:

(a) Detection of *PAX8–PPARγ* rearrangements in follicular carcinomas [28], follicular adenomas [32, 42] and follicular variant of papillary carcinoma [6].

(b) Identification of point mutations and large deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [34] and of mutations of *GRIM-19*, a nuclear gene involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) and cell death [33], which appear to be specific for oncocytic (Hürthle cell) tumours regardless of their histotype (follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma or papillary carcinoma).

(c) Detection of an extremely high prevalence of *BRAF* mutations in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) [12, 27, 59], namely in PTCs displaying a conventional (papillary or mixed follicular–papillary) growth pattern [65, 67].

In the present article, we have summarised the pathogenic, diagnostic and prognostic meaning of the aforementioned molecular features, together with the available evidence on some other genetic alterations, using as a classificative frame the recently published WHO book on endocrine tumours [14]. For the sake of simplicity, four tumour types will be addressed: follicular carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and oncocytic (Hürthle cell) tumours.

**Follicular carcinoma**

The most distinctive molecular features of follicular carcinoma are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of *RAS* mutations and *PAX8–PPARγ* rearrangements (as the result of a 2;3 translocation).

Aneuploidy is thought to indicate chromosomal instability (CIN) [53] and is frequently observed both in follicular adenomas, namely in those displaying a foetal/embryonal growth pattern, and in follicular carcinomas [4, 7].

Follicular adenomas with a foetal/embryonal growth pattern and follicular carcinomas, besides being aneuploid,

present, in about 60% of the cases, a DNA content which falls within the triploid range [7]. We have found evidence indicating that this DNA pattern is probably attained after a preliminary state of tetraploidisation, which is followed by a consistent loss of some chromosomes [4].

Giaretti et al. [20–22] showed that activating mutations of K-RAS were involved in the control of chromosome stability in colorectal tumours. Fagin [18] advanced that a similar mechanism, also involving RAS, might cause aneuploidy in follicular thyroid tumours. This possibility has been recently supported by the finding of a significant relationship between H-RAS 81T→C polymorphism, together with increased amount of p21 (which is the active form of RAS), and the occurrence of aneuploidy in follicular adenomas and follicular carcinomas (P. Castro et al., unpublished data).

The available evidence suggests there are at least two main pathways for thyroid follicular carcinogenesis: one, characterised by gross aneuploidy and a foetal-like growth pattern, displaying prominent chromosomal gains, and the other, occurring in lesions with a “common” follicular growth pattern and a diploid or near-diploid DNA content, displaying frequent chromosomal losses [4].

The aneuploid pattern and the various molecular alterations detected in follicular adenomas and follicular carcinomas support the assumption that the development of such tumours is the end product of multiple oncogenic steps, thus justifying their usual appearance as single (unicentric) neoplasms.

RAS mutations are frequently detected in follicular adenomas and follicular carcinomas and do not provide any useful information from the diagnostic standpoint [40]. In most cases, N-RAS and, less often, H-RAS are mutated in codon 61 (and less often in codons 12 and 13) [23, 45]. In some studies, it was advanced that RAS mutations carried a guarded prognosis, but such results have not been confirmed in most series, namely when the analyses were restricted to well-differentiated carcinomas, with the exclusion of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas [23, 44].

In 2000, Kroll et al. [28] reported the frequent occurrence in follicular carcinomas of the PAX8-PPARγ rearrangement, thus creating a sort of mirror image for follicular tumours of the well-known RET/PTC and TRK rearrangements of papillary carcinomas [19].

Initially, it was claimed that the PAX8-PPARγ translocation was exclusively detected in follicular carcinoma and thus could be considered as a sign of malignancy [28]. This concept was disproved in several studies that showed the presence of the translocation in a number of follicular adenomas [10, 15, 32, 42].

The most important molecular features of follicular cell tumorigenesis (follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma) are summarised in the following scheme:


Follicular cell
    ├── RAS activation
    ├── Other factors
    └── Chromosomal instability (CIN phenotype)
        └── Aneuploidy
            ├── PAX8-PPARγ
            └── Other alterations
                ├── Adenoma
                └── Follicular carcinoma


Regardless of the advances at the molecular level, the diagnosis of follicular carcinomas rests on the identification of signs of invasion, namely of vascular invasion at the tumour capsule [14, 49]. Besides the classic categories of minimally invasive and widely invasive follicular carcinoma, it is crucial to identify the vascular invasive tumours and, whenever possible, to quantify the type and number of vessels invaded [14, 49].

### Papillary carcinoma

At variance with follicular carcinoma, almost every PTC is diploid or quasi-diploid [24, 25]. Furthermore, PTCs display microsatellite stability [56]. Taking these facts together with the tendency of PTC to occur as multicentric neoplasms, which are clonally independent from each other [37, 54], it is tempting to advance that PTC tumorigenesis reflects the end product of (very) few oncogenic steps.

The major role played by RET/PTC and TRK rearrangements in the etiopathogenesis of PTC has been known for a while (for a thorough review, see Santoro et al. [51]). The prevalence of the different types of RET/PTC rearrangements is not the same in the different variants of PTC—e.g. RET/PTC1 is particularly prevalent in conventional PTC and in some prominent papillary PTC variants, whereas RET/PTC3 is more prevalent in the follicular/solid variant of PTC [41]. The overall prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangement varies greatly from series to series, depending on geographic factors and radiation exposure [41, 51]. Three other genetic and/or epigenetic alterations play a role in PTC pathogenesis: activating mutation of RAS genes, despite its much lower frequency than in follicular tumours [40, 44, 59], c-met overexpression [52] and downregulation of E-cadherin in PTC [47, 57].

Recently, another major player in PTC etiopathogenesis has been reported: the BRAF gene. The results on record show that, after melanoma, PTC is the human cancer displaying the highest prevalence of BRAF mutations, which occur almost always in the same hot spot (V600E) [12, 27, 59]. This mutation consists in a transversion from thymine to adenine in position 1799, leading to the substitution of a valine by a glutamate in codon 600. The V600E mutation is quasi-restricted to PTC with a conventional (papillary or mixed follicular-papillary) growth pattern and is particularly prevalent in PTCs with a prominent papillary structure, as is the case for tall cell variant and Warthin-like PTC [65, 67]. The prevalence of the BRAF mutation is also strongly associated with age, being rarely detected in young patients both in the post-Chernobyl setting and in sporadic cases occurring in western Europe [30].

The finding of a high prevalence of BRAF mutations, together with the involvement of RAS mutations and RET/PTC rearrangements in the majority of PTCs, points to the crucial role played by alterations at the RET/RAS/BRAF/MAPK signal transduction pathway in the etiopathogenesis of PTC. The three mutation groups (RET, RAS and BRAF) appear to be functionally similar and mutually exclusive [27, 59]. Despite the large amount of new molecular data,
the etiology of PTC remains to be fully clarified (for example, there is evidence to support that $RET/PTC$ rearrangements are among the earliest initiating events in PTC, but one still ignores the timing of $BRAF$ mutations in PTC oncogenesis) [30].

The prognostic significance of $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation remains controversial. Some groups claimed mutated cases carry a worse prognosis [39], whereas in our hands, mutated $BRAF$ PTCs do not display worse pathologic features than wild-type $BRAF$ PTC [65]. As a matter of fact, PTCs with $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation were less often multicentric and less vascular invasive than non-mutated PTCs [65]. Large series with longer follow-up are necessary to clarify the putative prognostic meaning of the $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation in PTC.

At variance with $RET/PTC$, which is not detected in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas [51, 57, 64], $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation is detected in about one third of poorly differentiated carcinomas and undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinomas, mainly in those tumours that appear to have arisen from pre-existing PTCs [43, 58].

The most important molecular features of PTC tumorigenesis are summarised in the following scheme:

| Follicular cell | Irradiation | No chromosomal instability | Diploidy; Near diploidy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Other factors | RET/PTC (mainly RET/PTC1) and TRK rearrangements | Conventional Papillary ca |
| BRAF mutations (V600E) |  |
| C-met and EGF-R overexpression |  |
| E-cadherin downregulation |  |

Despite all these molecular data, the diagnosis of PTC still depends on the identification of the typical nuclei: large, irregular, clear, grooved, occasionally displaying pseudo-inclusions. The differential diagnosis is particularly difficult in the field of encapsulated follicular patterned lesions that may correspond to follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma or follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC; see below) [31].

### Follicular variant of papillary carcinoma

In contrast to the high prevalence of the V600E mutation in conventional PTC, a distinct $BRAF$ mutation (K601E) has been detected in 9% of cases of FVPTC [67]. The $BRAF^{K601E}$ mutation has also been detected in two follicular adenomas of the thyroid [30, 59], but one cannot exclude the possibility that such $BRAF^{K601E}$ mutated lesions might represent misdiagnosed cases of FVPTC. Leaving this controversy aside, we think we have obtained enough evidence, after having searched for $BRAF$ mutations in several hundreds of thyroid tumours and tumour-like lesions, to conclude that the $BRAF^{K601E}$ mutation is typical of FVPTC although much less frequent (about 7%) than the $BRAF^{V600E}$ in conventional PTC (46–75%) [65].

The 1802A–G transition leading to the substitution of a lysine by a glutamate in codon 601 ($BRAF^{K601E}$) that is detected in the FVPTC mimics the $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation found in conventional PTC. Both types of mutation affect the activation segment of the protein, particularly the two adjacent residues (V600 and K601) that are localised between two major phosphoregulatory residues (T599 and S602) [11]. It was shown that the two mutations have high kinase activity in vitro [13, 68] and that the $BRAF^{V600E}$ has about 2.5× the kinase activity of $BRAF^{K601E}$ [68]. $BRAF^{V600E}$ and $BRAF^{K601E}$ mutations incorporate a negatively charged amino acid (glutamate) into the activation segment of $BRAF$; it was advanced that such glutamate may mimic the activating phosphorylation of T599 and/or S602 [13]. With so many similarities, the apparent specificity of the mutations vis-à-vis the PTC histotypes remains unexplained. Interestingly, in a microfollicular/solid variant of PTC, we have recently described [66], there was an in-frame triplet deletion of $BRAF$ leading, again, to the replacement of a valine and a lysine by a glutamate in the same $BRAF$ activation segment ($BRAF$ VK600-601E) [66].

Besides the type of $BRAF$ mutation, there are other molecular features of FVPTC that differ from those of conventional PTC. Some of those features resemble the molecular alterations that are thought to be characteristic of follicular carcinoma.

E-cadherin immunoeexpression in FVPTC resembles that of follicular carcinoma (and normal thyroid) rather than that of conventional PTC [47, 55]. The same holds true regarding some cytogenetic alterations, namely gains at chromosome arms 2q, 4q, 5q, 6q, 8q and 13q and deletions at 1p, 9q, 16q, 17q, 19q and 22q and the 2;3 translocation [5, 48, 69, P. Castro et al., unpublished data].

The frequency of $RAS$ mutations is much higher in FVPTC than in conventional PTC [70], thus contributing to approach the FVPTC to follicular carcinoma. We have recently confirmed the results of Zhu et al. with regard to the high prevalence of $RAS$ mutations in FVPTC (P. Castro et al., unpublished data). We have found, furthermore, similar prevalence of $RAS$ mutations [in most cases, in codon 61 of N-$RAS$] in follicular adenoma (33%), follicular carcinoma (22%) and FVPTC (25%) (P. Castro et al., unpublished data).

Finally, Roque et al. described in 2001, using conventional cytogenetics, the t(2;3)(q12;p25) in one case of FVPTC [48], and Wreesmann et al. [69], using immunohistochemistry, demonstrated in 2004 the overexpression of $PPAR\gamma$ in three cases; in one of these cases, the presence of rearranged $PPAR\gamma$ was detected by Southern blot [69]. After having detected in a small preliminary study the presence of the $PAX8-PPAR\gamma$ rearrangement in some cases of FVPTC [6], we confirmed such findings in a large series: the $PAX8-PPAR\gamma$ rearrangement was detected in 38% of the cases of FVPTC, in 33% of follicular adenomas, in 45% of follicular carcinomas and in no case of conventional PTC (P. Castro et al., unpublished data).

At variance with the rarity of the coexistence of $RAS$ mutations and $PAX8-PPAR\gamma$ rearrangement in follicular tumours reported by Nikiforova et al. [44], we detected both alterations in 13% of the cases of FVPTC, as well as in 14% of follicular carcinomas and in 8% of follicular adenomas (P. Castro et al., unpublished data). The presence of both alterations was significantly associated with the youngerage of the patients, favouring the concept that such coexistence may lead to more rapidly growing tumours.

Taken together, all the aforementioned data support the conclusion that FVPTC shows genetic differences from conventional PTC and suggest that at least a subset of FVPTC shares some of the molecular features of follicular carcinomas.

The most important molecular features of FVPTC are summarised in the following scheme:

Follicular cell
- Ras activation
- Irradiation
- Other factors

Discrete chromosomal instability
- Discrete aneuploidy

RET/PTC 3
PAX8/PPARγ
BRAF<sup>V601E</sup>

Follicular variant of PTC

FVPTC cases, like most conventional PTCs, are slowly growing neoplasms that tend to give rise to lymph node metastases [3, 8, 50]. In 1985, Carcangiu et al. [3] pointed out that, differently from conventional PTC, some FVPTC cases were prone to give rise to lung metastases. It was observed, moreover, that the growth pattern of the encapsulated form of FVPTC mimicked that of follicular carcinomas, pushing borders and signs of capsular and/or vascular invasion [4, 8, 50]. Baloch and LiVolsi [2] showed that these encapsulated FVPTCs may give rise to blood-borne metastases in the absence of lymph node metastases.

We still ignore the putative prognostic meaning of the molecular alterations detected in FVPTC (BRAF<sup>K601E</sup> mutation, RAS mutations and PAX8–PPARγ rearrangement). It remains also to be seen if the subset of FVPTC displaying genetic alterations of the follicular carcinoma type encompasses cases particularly prone to give rise to lung and/or bone metastases.

### Oncocytic (Hürthle cell) tumours

Tumours with oncocytic (Hürthle cell) features may be benign (oncocytic variant of follicular adenoma) or malignant (oncocytic variant of papillary carcinoma and oncocytic variant of follicular carcinoma). Medullary and poorly differentiated carcinomas may also display oncocytic features [14, 35, 46, 60].

It is also well established that oncocytes (Hürthle cells) occur frequently in non-neoplastic conditions such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, nodular goiters and atrophic glands of old individuals [35, 60]. The same holds true for oncocytic transformation in tumours and non-neoplastic conditions of other organs such as the salivary glands, parathyroids, pituitary and kidneys.

Hürthle cells are stuffed with mitochondria with morphologic, functional and genetic abnormalities [35, 60, 61]. The accumulation of the mitochondria may be due to a primary alteration of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or of the nuclear DNA (nDNA) that encodes mitochondrial enzymes [33, 34, 38]. The most typical mtDNA alteration in oncocytic cells is the presence of a large deletion (about 5 kb, which corresponds to one third of the total DNA in each mitochondrial chromosome) [38]. This large deletion is usually designated by “common deletion” and has been detected in oncocytic cells of Hashimoto thyroiditis and all sorts of oncocytic tumours of the thyroid, as well as in Warthin tumour of the salivary glands [29, 34, 38]. Point mutations in the mitochondrial genes encoding for enzymes of the complexes I, III, IV and V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) have also been reported in oncocytic tumours of the thyroid [34]. The mitochondria containing deleted and/or mutated mtDNA proliferate more than “normal” mitochondria, thus leading to a progressive increase in the percentage of abnormal mitochondria [35]. The mechanism of tumour formation under these circumstances is not yet well understood; however, several possibilities have been advanced: (a) The mitochondrial abnormalities block the apoptotic process, increasing the survival of the cells [29]. (b) The deficient mitochondrial function is sensed as a hypoxic stimulus leading to increased levels of the inducible form of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which triggers some pro-angiogenesis pathways (and also proliferation?). (For a review on these two possibilities, see Ref. [16].)

Regardless of the mechanism(s) involved in the process, a deficient mitochondrial function leads to an increased number of mitochondria through the stimulation of mitochondrial proliferation [16, 34–36, 60].

The oncocytic variant of PTC has papillary carcinomas that have RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations with similar frequency as the non-oncocytic PTC [9, 65, 67]. With regard to the oncocytic variant of follicular tumours, it remains controversial whether or not such Hürthle cell tumours have similar prevalences of RAS mutations and PAX8–PPARγ rearrangements as their non-Hürthle cell counterparts [62, 63].

The molecular features of the oncocytic tumours of the thyroid are thus associated for one side with the mitochondrial abnormalities that are their hallmarks and, for the other, with the oncogenic alterations that are associated with the carcinoma histotype (e.g. RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations in PTC) [9, 33, 67].

The presence of abundant (and abnormal) mitochondria in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells may be seen throughout the entire tumour (“primary” oxyphilia, indicating that the carcinogenic hit has occurred in cells with abnormalities of the mtDNA or mitochondrial abnormalities resulting from the nDNA encoding mitochondrial enzymes) or just in some parts of the tumour (“secondary” oxyphilia, indicating that the mitochondrial abnormalities have occurred after tumour development) [1, 34, 35].

The familial forms of benign and malignant Hürthle cell tumours [26] may be due to a germline mutation in GRIM-19, a dual-function nuclear gene involved in mitochondrial metabolism and cell death. Downregulation of GRIM-19 has been shown to confer a growth advantage on cells and to reduce the likelihood that they will enter apoptosis [1]. The detection of a RET/PTC1 rearrangement in one case of the oncocytic variant of PTC in which there was also a GRIM-19 mutation suggests that the latter mutation may serve as a predisposing alteration for the occurrence of
tumours with cell oxyphilia; other alterations such as RET/PTC rearrangement or BRAF mutation may be necessary for the acquisition of the malignant phenotype (for a thorough review, see Ref. [33]).

The most important molecular features of oncocytic (Hürthle cell) tumours are summarised in the following scheme:


Follicular cell
  ↓
Genetic events related to
the carcinoma histotype
  ↓
Large deletions of mitochondrial DNA
Mutations in mitochondrial OXPHOS genes
Mutations in nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins – e.g. GRIM-19
  ↓
Oncocytic (Hürthle cell)
variant of PTC and FTC


The criteria used in the diagnosis of the oncocytic variants of papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma are those used in the diagnosis of conventional tumours, i.e. mainly the nuclear characteristics in PTC and the signs of capsular and/or vascular invasion in follicular carcinoma. In other words, the presence of oncocytic cells should not interfere with the diagnostic criteria in any of the thyroid tumour settings. The prognosis of patients with the oncocytic variant of PTC is similar to that of patients with conventional PTC (and the same holds true regarding follicular carcinomas) provided the age of the patients and the staging of the tumours are comparable [17, 60]. From a clinical standpoint, the only negative aspect of oncocytic carcinomas of the thyroid is their lesser ability to trap iodine, thus rendering them less responsive to radioactive iodine [35, 60].
