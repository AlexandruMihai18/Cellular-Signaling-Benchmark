■ **Abstract** Genetic disorders of acid-base transporters involve plasmalemmal and organellar transporters of H⁺, HCO₃⁻, and Cl⁻. Autosomal-dominant and -recessive forms of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) are caused by mutations in ion transporters of the acid-secreting Type A intercalated cell of the renal collecting duct. These include the AE1 Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger of the basolateral membrane and at least two subunits of the apical membrane vacuolar (v)H⁺-ATPase, the V₁ subunit B1 (associated with deafness) and the V₀ subunit a4. Recessive proximal RTA with ocular disease arises from mutations in the electrogenic Na⁺-bicarbonate cotransporter NBC1 of the proximal tubular cell basolateral membrane. Recessive mixed proximal-distal RTA accompanied by osteopetrosis and mental retardation is associated with mutations in cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase II. The metabolic alkalosis of congenital chloride-losing diarrhea is caused by mutations in the DRA Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger of the ileocolonic apical membrane. Recessive osteopetrosis is caused by deficient osteoclast acid secretion across the ruffled border lacunar membrane, the result of mutations in the vH⁺-ATPase V₀ subunit or in the CLC-7 Cl⁻ channel. X-linked nephrolithiasis and engineered deficiencies in some other CLC Cl⁻ channels are thought to represent defects of organellar acidification. Study of acid-base transport disease-associated mutations should enhance our understanding of protein structure-function relationships and their impact on the physiology of cell, tissue, and organism.

## INTRODUCTION

Optimal function of physiological processes requires control of intracellular and extracellular pH. All cell types must maintain cytoplasmic pH within a narrow range, while generating and responding to metabolic acid and base loads, and while maintaining acidic and alkaline environments within distinct subcellular organellar compartments. The pH of blood and extracellular fluid must be maintained within a narrow range around pH 7.4, whereas specialized cell types can secrete large amounts of acid or base into delimited lumenal spaces. Segregation and regulation of these cellular and extracellular compartments of different pH requires control of acid-base transporter protein activity, biosynthesis and degradation, trafficking,

anchoring, and interaction with other polypeptides. Systemic pH homeostasis is achieved through integrated function of the intracellular and plasmalemmal acid-base transporters of kidneys, lungs, and gut, coordinated and regulated by endocrine and nervous systems.

This review summarizes the molecular bases for genetic diseases of plasmalemmal and organellar acid-base transporters. These diseases include (in varying combinations) renal tubular acidoses, deafness, osteopetrosis, mental retardation, alkalotic chloride-losing diarrhea, nephrolithiasis, ocular disease, and brain disease. The associated mutant acid-base transporters include the SLC4A and SLC26A bicarbonate transporters, vH⁺-ATPase subunits, and carbonic anhydrase II. Acid-base disorders of Cl⁻ channel diseases are also discussed. Diseases of renal Na⁺ reabsorption cause secondary acid-base disturbances. Inborn errors of metabolism associated with acid-base disturbances are not addressed.

# PHYSIOLOGY OF URINARY ACIDIFICATION

The human body fueled by a western diet daily generates ~1 mmol of mineral acid per kg of body weight. This acid load must be excreted by the kidney. In addition, the daily glomerular filtration of the human kidneys includes in its ~180 liters about 4.5 mol of filtered bicarbonate that must be recovered (1–3). The polarized epithelial cells of the proximal tubule reclaim 80–90% of filtered bicarbonate in a complex process requiring coordinated actions of transport and enzymatic activities in the apical and basolateral membranes and in the cytoplasm (Figure 1). Proximal tubular epithelial cells secrete H⁺ across their apical membranes into the tubular lumen via the NHE3 Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger (~2/3 of the total) and the vH⁺-ATPase (~1/3 of the total). H⁺ is made available for secretion by intracellular generation of H⁺ and HCO₃⁻ from cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase II-catalyzed hydration of CO₂. As H⁺ is secreted in the lumen, intracellular HCO₃⁻ is translocated across the basolateral membrane into the interstitium by the electronegenic kNBC1 Na⁺-bicarbonate cotransporter. Rapid equilibration between extracellular CO₂ and HCO₃⁻ is aided by lumenally disposed glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored carbonic anhydrase IV at the apical surface, as well as by basolateral surface carbonic anhydrase activity (4).

The small fraction of luminal bicarbonate not reclaimed by the proximal tubule is reabsorbed across thick ascending limb cells by a process requiring luminal membrane Na⁺/H⁺ exchange (NHE2 and/or NHE3). The nonvolatile acid load is secreted by the Type A intercalated cells of the connecting segment and collecting duct via apical vH⁺-ATPase, cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase CAII, and the kAE1 Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger of the basolateral membrane (Figure 1). Membrane-bound carbonic anhydrase likely also contributes to intercalated cell H⁺ secretion (5). Lumenal H⁺ is trapped by urinary buffers. These include ammonium, generated in the proximal tubule and subject to countercurrent recycling, and phosphate, subject to its regulated proximal tubular reabsorption. Loss-of-function mutations

in the genes encoding polypeptides that mediate some of these functions in the proximal and distal nephron underlie multiple heritable forms of renal tubular acidosis. Mutations in other contributing gene products are hypothesized to act as genetic modifiers.

## Familial Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (dRTA)

Primary familial dRTA is diagnosed by failure of the kidney to generate sufficiently acidic urine in the setting of spontaneous systemic metabolic acidosis (complete dRTA) or after an imposed acid load (incomplete dRTA). The inadequate urinary acidification is usually accompanied by hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis, leading to interstitial disease, urinary concentration defects, nephrolithiasis, and ultimately to chronic renal insufficiency. Affected children present with failure to thrive and growth retardation. The variably severe hypokalemia can present as muscle weakness, periodic paralysis, or cardiac arrhythmia. Decreased ammonium excretion is the result of reduced NH₄⁺ trapping in the less acid urine, in the setting of normal renal proximal ammoniagenesis. Chronic interstitial disease secondary to nephrocalcinosis contributes to the electrolyte abnormalities and concentration defects by disruption of the medullary countercurrent gradient (3, 6–9).

Familial dRTA is inherited in both dominant and recessive patterns. De novo mutations have also been documented. Recessive cases are more likely than dominant cases to be of severe and early onset. Only the recessive forms of dRTA are in some cohorts accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss. Bicarbonate supplementation reliably resolves acidosis. If started sufficiently early in the course of the disease, bicarbonate supplementation can restore normal growth and bone density, reverse hypocitraturia and hypercalciuria, and halt renal calcification processes. Bicarbonate treatment does not, however, ameliorate hearing loss (6).

Familial defects in distal urinary acidification might arise from any primary defect in acid secretion by the collecting duct Type A intercalated cell. Such defects in apical H⁺ translocation from cell to lumen could reflect mutations in a subunit of the heteromultimeric vacuolar H⁺-ATPase, mutations in a subunit of the heterodimeric H⁺/K⁺ ATPases, or mutations in one of several candidate apical Cl⁻ conductances. Defects could also be predicted in carbonic anhydrase II or in basolateral HCO₃⁻ translocation from cell into interstitium, reflecting mutations in the kAE1 Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger. In addition, secondary defects in urinary acidification due to impaired ENaC-mediated Na⁺ reabsorption across collecting duct principal cells could lead to a more lumen-positive apical membrane potential unfavorable for electrogenic H⁺ secretion. Constitutive upregulation of bicarbonate secretion from Type B intercalated cells might also result in mild dRTA. Lastly, mutations in genes encoding proteins that regulate activity, biosynthesis, targeting, retention, or degradation of any of these acid/base transporters could cause dRTA.

AE1 mutations in dominant and recessive forms of dRTA have been found through the candidate gene approach (9). Mutations in vH⁺-ATPase subunits have been found in recessive dRTA through whole-genome linkage mapping, followed by candidate screening within the linked region (6).

## AE1 Mutations in Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis

The 911 amino acid human erythroid AE1 (eAE1) Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger SLC4A1 is the major intrinsic membrane protein of the red cell and serves to increase the total CO₂ carrying capacity of the blood. The *AE1* gene on human chromosome 17q21-22 is transcribed in erythroid precursors under control of an erythroid-specific promoter upstream of exon 1. AE1 is also expressed at high level in the Type A intercalated cell of the collecting duct. Renal transcription arises from a distinct promoter within intron 3 of the 20 exon *AE1* gene (10). The resultant kidney transcript encodes a kidney-specific kAE1 polypeptide that lacks the N-terminal 65 (human) (11) or 79 (mouse) amino acids present in eAE1 (12).

The ~400 amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of eAE1 (Figure 2) anchors the membrane protein to the underlying cytoskeleton via interactions with ankyrin-1 and proteins 4.1 and 4.2. The N-terminal region of this domain also binds glycolytic enzymes and hemoglobin (13, 14). With the exception of the little understood protein kanadaptin (15), the identity of kAE1-binding proteins

in the intercalated cell remains unknown. The ~500 amino acid C-terminal domain includes 12 to 14 transmembrane spans and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Figure 2). The topographical disposition of the first 9 and (more provisionally) of the final 2 transmembrane spans is generally accepted. Several models have been proposed for the structure of the possibly flexible intervening region (16–19). Although residues have been identified whose mutation modifies anion permeation (20–22), the anion translocation pathway remains to be identified. The short C-terminal tail includes a binding site for carbonic anhydrase II (23). Transfection and mutagenesis experiments suggest that the resulting local channeling of transported substrate is important to maintain high rates of Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange (24) and that the model of the AE1/carbonic anhydrase “metabolon” (23, 24) is likely to be replicated by other bicarbonate transporters. The AE1 transmembrane domain reconstituted into two-dimensional lipid crystalline arrays has been visualized by cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction to 20 Å resolution (25).

The majority of AE1 mutations reported to date apparently cause only erythroid abnormalities without renal phenotype (Figure 2) (26–28). Most cause autosomal-dominant forms of hereditary spherocytic anemia (HS) and are not encountered in homozygous form, suggesting embryonic lethality. HS mutations are usually associated with moderately decreased total eAE1 polypeptide in the erythrocyte membrane, and apparent absence of mutant polypeptide. The mutants studied to date reveal abnormal trafficking in *Xenopus* oocytes (28) and in 293 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (30). The mutants fail to reach the medial Golgi and are misfolded as evidenced by failure to bind to SITS-affigel (30). Both the functionally inactive mutant AE1 Δ400-408 (Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis, SAO) and the gain-of-function mutant AE1 P868L (hereditary acanthocytosis) (Figure 2) also change red cell shape, but without symptomatic phenotype.

Dominant HS-associated AE1 mutations are generally not associated with dRTA. Conversely, dRTA-associated AE1 mutations are generally not associated with HS. Whereas HS missense mutations are distributed throughout AE1 cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, dRTA mutations are restricted to AE1’s transmembrane domain (Figure 2). The almost complete segregation between mutations associated with HS and with dRTA is not understood. In only two instances have homozygous recessive AE1 mutations been associated with the combination of neonatal life-threatening anemia and apparent distal renal tubular acidosis. Both of these mutations were associated with complete absence of red cell membrane eAE1: V488M in TM4 of human AE1 (31), and the equivalent in bovine AE1 of human R646X (32), terminating after TM7. [Two additional families with dominant HS due to AE1 truncation mutants exhibited deficient urinary acidification accompanied by proximal-type bicarbonaturia (33, 34); thus the renal defect could not be attributed simply to dRTA.]

Autosomal dominant dRTA was first associated with exon 14 nucleotide substitutions encoding missense mutations in residue 589, in which the wild-type Arg is converted to His (27, 28, 35), Ser (27, 35), or Cys (27). Red cells of these individuals displayed normal AE1 polypeptide abundance, ~25% reduction in

magnitude of AE1-mediated sulfate transport with normal pH-dependence, and minimally altered AE1 affinity for the antagonist DIDS. Heterologous expression of kAE1 R589H in *Xenopus* oocytes revealed ~50% of wild-type function, whether measured as Cl⁻/Cl⁻ exchange or as Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange (27, 28) and without abnormal inhibition by outer medullary values of pH or osmolarity (28). Enhancement of function and surface expression by co-expressed glycoporin A (36) was retained. Coexpression of mutant and wild-type AE1 forms indicated no dominant-negative phenotype that would explain defective urinary acidification. kAE1 R589C exhibited wild-type Cl⁻ transport activity (27). Interestingly, R589 is adjacent to K590, the covalent binding site for the inhibitor phenyl isothiocyanate, and this pair of basic residues is conserved in all AE anion exchangers.

Other dominant dRTA-associated AE1 mutations exhibited similarly modest decrements in function. These findings pose a central question about dominant dRTA. How do partial loss-of-function mutations (which in *Xenopus* oocytes and red cells do not exhibit a dominant-negative behavior) produce an impaired urinary acidification phenotype, whereas more severe loss-of-function mutants associated with HS leave urinary acidification apparently unaltered. Oocyte expression experiments cannot detect some temperature-sensitive defects in stability or trafficking or defects in polarized sorting. Preliminary cytological results in transiently transfected polarized MDCK cells grown on permeable filter supports suggest that kAE1 R589H polypeptide exhibits at steady state a wild-type level of accumulation and restriction to the basolateral membrane (D. Prabakaran & S. L. Alper, unpublished data). However, renal cortical tissue sections from one individual with AE1 R589H revealed intercalated cells with decreased vH⁺-ATPase immunostaining and apparently absent kAE1 (interpretation was complicated by the coincident scarring of chronic pyelonephritis) (37).

Other dominant dRTA AE1 mutations have minimal or no red cell phenotype. Heterozygosity for AE1 S613F within putative TM7 is associated with increased AE1-mediated sulfate uptake, normal iodide uptake in red cells, and near-normal Cl⁻ uptake in *Xenopus* oocytes (27). Heterozygosity for AE1 A858D in or near putative TM14 is associated with slight reductions in red cell AE1 polypeptide content and AE1-mediated sulfate flux. AE1 A858D expressed in *Xenopus* oocytes exhibited only 28% of wild-type Cl⁻ uptake but was moderately stimulated by glycoporin A coexpression to 43% of the wild-type stimulated value, with equivalent enhancement of surface polypeptide expression (38).

Studies of red cells heterozygous for AE1 R901X resulting from a 13-nucleotide duplication in exon 20 (35) have not been reported. This mutation truncates C-terminal cytoplasmic residues that include a putative Type II PDZ recognition domain capable (as a fusion protein) of interaction with the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1 (39), but retains residues 886–890 that constitute the AE1-binding site for carbonic anhydrase II (23, 24). Preliminary expression data in *Xenopus* oocytes (N. Dahl, L. Jiang & S. L. Alper, unpublished data.) show Cl⁻/Cl⁻ and Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange activities of magnitude equivalent to or greater than those
exhibited by the dominant dRTA mutant AE1 R589H (28) and without dominant-negative phenotype.

Among individuals with dominant dRTA, correlation between genotype and phenotype has not been apparent. Incomplete and complete dRTA are present within individual families. Extent of nephrocalcinosis and degree of hypokalemia vary among family members carrying the same mutation. Within one R589C family, the father presented with severe nephrocalcinosis/lithiasis and isosthenuria, but without metabolic acidosis (incomplete dRTA). In contrast, his daughter was aci-dotic, hypokalemic, and hypercalciuric, but without nephrocalcinosis (40). Thus clinical phenotype can be altered by (still undefined) modifier genes, some of which may themselves be RTA genes. Deafness has not been documented in association with dominant dRTA.

Within the intercalated cell, dominant dRTA-associated AE1 mutations likely do exert a dominant-negative effect. Additional functional studies, including those contrasting erythroid and intercalated cell types, will be required to understand AE1-associated dRTA in the absence of erythroid disease.

### AE1 Mutations in Recessive Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis

In Caucasian populations, AE1 has not been associated with classical recessive dRTA (35). However, AE1 mutations are a major cause of recessive dRTA in populations in Thailand (41, 42), Malaysia, and Papua-New Guinea (38). The first recessive dRTA mutation found was *AE1 G701D*. In this first family described, patient red cell AE1 content and AE1-mediated sulfate flux were normal, but in *Xenopus* oocytes, AE1 G701D exhibited complete loss-of-function owing to lack of surface accumulation and intracellular retention (41). Since red cell function appeared normal, glycoporhin A or another erythroid-specific AE1-binding protein were candidates to explain the difference. Indeed, glycoporhin A coexpression completely rescued AE1G701D function and surface expression (41). AE1G701D C-terminally linked to GFP was also retained inside polarized MDCK cells and was rescued to the basolateral surface by coexpressed glycoporhin A (D. Prabakaran & S. L. Alper, unpublished data). Thus the G701D mutation produces a conditional trafficking phenotype. It folds and traffics normally in the presence of glycoporhin A (the situation in erythroid precursor cells). However, intercalated cells lack detectable glycoporhin A (41), and in its absence, AE1 G701D cannot accumulate at the cell surface. A functional equivalent of glycoporhin A in intercalated cells has not been defined.

In some Southeast Asian patients, dRTA is associated with ovalocytosis, and early case reports of this association (43) fueled interest in AE1 as a dRTA candidate gene. These patients are compound heterozygotes of AE1 dRTA mutations with the Δ400–408 in-frame deletion ovalocytosis mutation SAO (Figure 2). dRTA with ovalocytosis has been found with the AE1 mutations G701D, A858D, and ΔV850 in trans with AE1 SAO. Compound heterozygosity with the alleles A858D and ΔV850 has also been reported (38). These more C-terminal mutants accumulatedto lower levels in the red cell and exhibited reduced transport function (only 29 and 14% of wild-type activity in *Xenopus* oocytes), but retained responsiveness to glycophorin A coexpression. Interestingly, although AE1 SAO is not dominant-negative in the red cell (44), glycophorin A enhancement of A858D function in oocytes was strongly inhibited in the presence of coexpressed SAO (38). This inhibitory effect of coexpressed AE1 SAO was also evident, though more modest, in the presence of other recessive mutants (38, 45). The ability of glycophorin A to effect rescue of the recessive dRTA mutation AE1 G701D did not require normally homodimeric glycophorin A. Four mutants with impaired homodimerization retained the ability to enhance wild-type AE1 translocation to the oocyte surface, as well as to rescue AE1 G701D function to normal levels (46).

The two most C terminal of the recessive dRTA mutations in AE1 reside in a region implicated in anion transport function. Covalent modification of A858C or of S852C in an otherwise Cys-less AE1 inhibited Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange by 40% in 293 HEK cells (17). Thus the integrity of the ecto-loop between putative TMs 13 and 14 appears important to AE1 function, especially in the absence of glycophorin A in intercalated cells.

Recessive and compound heterozygous AE1 mutations show functional defects that account for dRTA without anemia, due to loss-of-function or hypofunction in the Type A intercalated cell to a greater degree than in the erythrocyte. However, a role for altered targeting of kAE1 remains possible. One patient with SAO and dRTA (genetically yet undefined) responded to oral bicarbonate loading with a normally elevated value for the “urine minus blood carbon dioxide tension difference” (U-B pCO₂) in an alkaline urine, whereas patients with dRTA usually fail to elevate urine pCO₂ in this setting (47). Although consistent with accumulation of a mis-targeted mutant AE1 in the apical membrane of the intercalated cell, other explanations are possible for the result of this highly sensitive but less specific test (48).

The AE1 (−/−) mouse (49, 50) has runting, and severe anemia with very fragile red cell membranes. These AE1 (−/−) membranes are 50% depleted of ankyrin-1 and devoid of the AE1-binding proteins 4.2 and glycophorin A (51), despite retention of apparently normal spectrin-actin cytoskeletal ultrastructure. Although AE1 expression was absent in AE1 (−/−) mouse kidney (49), vH⁺-ATPase-expressing intercalated cells remained present (A. K. Stuart-Tilley, L. L. Peters & S. L. Alper, unpublished data). The targeted disruption of AE1 exon 3 in one of the mouse lines, despite its intended preservation of the kAE1 open reading frame (50), affected the kidney-specific promoter of the *AE1* gene as evidenced by loss of *kAE1* mRNA from kidney (B. E. Shmukler & S. L. Alper, unpublished data).

## ACID-BASE DISORDERS IN DISEASES OF SLC26A Cl⁻/BASE EXCHANGERS

Alkali-secreting Type B intercalated cells express Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange activity in their apical membranes. In the mouse, this activity is encoded by the SLC26 anion exchanger gene family member, pendrin (SLC26A4) on chromosome 7q22 (52, 53). In humans, pendrin mutations cause the Pendred syndrome of deafnessand variably penetrant hypothyroid goiter. With its broad anion selectivity (54, 55), pendrin likely mediates $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{I}^{-}$ exchange in thyrocytes and perhaps $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$/formate exchange in the cochlea. Deaf pendrin $(--)$ mice are not spontaneously alkalotic, as would be predicted if pendrin-mediated $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion by Type B intercalated cells were essential under normal dietary conditions. However, perfusion of cortical collecting ducts isolated from deoxycorticosterone-treated pendrin $(-/-)$ mice demonstrated absence of the normally activated bicarbonate secretion (53). An upregulatory mutation in pendrin might conceivably cause a mild or incomplete dRTA.

The AE4 $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ exchanger has also been proposed as an apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ exchanger of Type B intercalated cells (56). Conflicting reports on rat AE4 localization place it in either the Type B intercalated cell apical membrane (57) or the Type A cell basolateral membrane (58). Whatever the localization of AE4, genetics in human and mouse suggest that AE4 is central neither to Type A cell-mediated acid secretion nor to Type B cell-mediated bicarbonate secretion.

The pendrin gene is immediately adjacent to the DRA (downregulated in adenoma) gene ($\mathrm{SLC} 26 \mathrm{~A} 3$), encoding a transporter polypeptide of nearly $50 \%$ amino acid identity. Wild-type DRA mediates $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ exchange (59) in the apical membrane of the enterocyte. Mutations in the DRA gene cause recessive congenital chloride-losing diarrhea (60). This syndrome is associated with prenatal-onset watery diarrhea, metabolic alkalosis, dehydration, and severe electrolyte disturbances. Untreated, the volume contraction can lead to renal failure. After correction of serum electrolytes, fecal $[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$ is always greater $>90 \mathrm{mM}(61)$.

The relative importance of bicarbonate transport in the physiological function of two other disease-associated SLC26 anion exchangers remains uncertain. The DTD ($\mathrm{SLC} 26 \mathrm{~A} 2$) gene on chromosome $5 q 32$ encodes a sulfate/chloride/oxalate exchanger (62), and mutations in the gene cause recessive diastrophic chondrodysplasia. The disease has been attributed to inadequate sulfate uptake into chondrocytes, with consequent inadequate sulfation of cartilage glycosaminoglycans. CFEX/PAT ($\mathrm{SLC} 26 \mathrm{~A} 6$) (64) is an apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$/formate/bicarbonate exchanger of the proximal tubule apical membrane (65), which is also expressed in pancreas. Although CFEX likely contributes to proximal tubular $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ reabsorption, roles for CFEX in proximal nephron regulation of acid-base balance and in pancreatic bicarbonate secretion remain undefined.

## vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Subunit Mutations in Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis

Although the genes encoding the many subunits of the vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase were long considered as candidate genes for dRTA, mutations in genes encoding so widely expressed an activity were thought unlikely to generate the restricted phenotype of primary dRTA. However, the combined results of whole-genome screening of large recessive dRTA pedigrees with the sequencing of the human genome have led to rejection of this initial concern. Some subunits of the vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase are members of gene families with tissue-specific expression of particular members. Mutations
in two vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase gene members of such multigene families have been shown  
to cause recessive dRTA. Their expression is restricted entirely or nearly entirely  
to the kidney (66, 67).

The vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPases are a family of multisubunit ATP-dependent proton pumps  
responsible for acidification of intracellular organelles and acidification of lumena  
or interstitial spaces adjacent to cell plasma membranes (68, 69). The vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPases  
are hetero-oligomeric complexes composed of 13 polypeptide types. These can be  
fractionated into a soluble cytoplasmically disposed V<sub>1</sub> domain of ~570 kDa,  
which encompasses the ATPase activity, and a membrane-associated V<sub>0</sub> domain  
of ~260 kDa that includes the proton translocation pathway (Figure 3). The X-ray  
crystal structure of the V<sub>1</sub>-related F<sub>1</sub> domain from the structurally related mito-  
chondrial F-ATPase has been solved (70), and the electron microscopic image  
analysis of the F<sub>0</sub> domain from bovine brain clathrin-coated pits is available at 21 Å  
resolution (71).

The V<sub>1</sub> domain is composed of 8 subunit types A-H with molecular masses  
(in kDa) of 70 (A), 60 (B), 40 (C), 34 (D), 33 (E), 14 (F), and 16 (G), with a  
stoichiometry estimated at A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>C<sub>1</sub>D<sub>1</sub>E<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub>G<sub>2</sub>H<sub>1</sub>. The V<sub>0</sub> domain is composed of  
5 subunit types a (100–116 kDa), c and c′ (each 17 kDa), c″ (19 kDa), and d (38  
kDa), with a stoichiometry of a<sub>1</sub>d<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub>c<sub>6</sub>c<sub>6</sub>. The proteolipid subunits c, c′, and c″, each

predicted to encode four transmembrane $\alpha$-helices, are thought to assemble into a ring structure within the lipid bilayer (72). The $V_{1}$ domain likely is attached to the $V_{0}$ domain by a central stalk made up of subunit D. By analogy with mechanistic studies on the F-ATPase, hydrolysis of ATP by the catalytic site of subunit A is thought to force rotation of the stalk like a crankshaft inside the $A_{3}B_{3}$ hexamer. Rotation of the D subunit crankshaft in turn drives rotation of the proteolipid ring (73). Rotation of the proteolipid ring with respect to the immobile $a$ and associated subunits is thought to open the $H^{+}$ permeability pathway at or near the interface between the $a$ subunit and some of the proteolipid subunits.

Whole-genome linkage analysis by Karet et al. mapped a gene for recessive dRTA to chromosome 2p13 with a multipoint lod score of 7.34 (66). Although the B1 subunit of the vH${}^{+}$-ATPase (ATP6B1) had been previously assigned to chromosome 2q, its candidacy was pursued because in kidney its expression is restricted to intercalated cells, whereas the B2 subunit is expressed in both the brush border crypts of proximal tubule and widely in other tissues (74). The B1 gene was indeed remapped within the dRTA maximum likelihood interval, cloned, and its 14 exons sequenced. Fifteen mutations distributed throughout the 513 amino acid B1 sequence were identified in 19 of 62 evaluated kindreds, which included 7 missense mutations in addition to premature terminations, frameshifts, and splice-site mutations (66).

Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was documented in 87% of evaluated families. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed expression of B1 subunit in the mouse cochlea and endolymphatic sac (66), including the interdental cells and endolymphatic sac cells whose basolateral membranes contain abundant AE Cl${}^{-}$/ HCO${}_{3}^{-}$ exchanger (75). The failure of bicarbonate therapy to correct deafness while successfully treating systemic symptoms of dRTA suggests that transepithelial acid secretion is required for normal cochlear development and hair cell survival. The restricted sites of expression of ATP6B1 explain the limited phenotype of mutant-associated disease because ATP6B2 is thought to serve the same function in tissues other than intercalated cells and cochlea.

The mouse B1 gene encodes a B1 polypeptide 93% identical to human B1 gene. B1 subunit ($-$/$-$) mice are born in Mendelian ratios, but unlike humans with B1 mutations, grow at normal rates. However, the mice do fail to acidify their urine in response to oral acid loading. Thus absence of expression of the vH${}^{+}$-ATPase gene in the mouse has produced a model of recessive incomplete dRTA (76).

These findings strongly suggested other tissue-specific subunits of vH${}^{+}$-ATPase are candidate dRTA genes. Indeed, in a second group of families, recessive dRTA with preserved hearing mapped to chromosome 7q33-34 (77) in which a maximum likelihood interval of 4 cM was defined (67). Within a BAC previously mapped to this interval, an EST was found to encode a sequence homologous to the widely transcribed ATP6N1A $a$ subunit of the vH${}^{+}$-ATPase $V_{0}$ subunit. The new gene, $ATP6N1B$ (now called $a4$), encoded in 23 exons a protein of 840 amino acids 61% identical to ATP6N1A, and with 50% and 40% respective identities to homologs in *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The

cytoplasmic N-terminal 250 amino acids preceded 6 to 9 predicted transmembrane helices, several potential N-glycosylation sites, and a short C-terminal tail. Initial Northern analysis revealed expression only in fetal and adult kidney. Eight mutations in as many kindreds included the three missense mutations \( P524L \), \( M580T \) (invariant among all eukaryotic orthologs), and the charge-altering \( G820R \), predicted to lie within a transmembrane span. Initial immunocytochemical studies localized ATP6N1B polypeptide to the apical membrane of Type A intercalated cells of human kidney cortex, but not to proximal tubular cells (67). Thus its distribution in human kidney parallels that of ATP6B1.

The syntenic mouse \( Atp6n1b \) gene has recently been cloned and encodes an \( a4 \) polypeptide 85% identical to the human ortholog. RT-PCR analysis confirms kidney-specific expression. Unlike the human \( a4 \) 116-kDa subunit, the mouse \( a4 \) 105-kDa \( V_0 \) subunit of vH\(^+\)-ATPase is expressed in apical membrane of proximal tubule and in occasional cells of epididymis and vas deferens, and perhaps also in basolateral membrane of Type B intercalated cells, as well as in apical membrane of Type A cells (78).

Additional recessive dRTA mutations in both ATP6B1 and ATP6N1B genes have recently been found, including new missense mutations. In addition, families have been identified in which recessive dRTA maps no previously identified loci (79), suggesting that further recessive dRTA genes will be identified.

### vH\(^+\)-ATPase Mutations in Osteopetrosis

ATP6N1B is only one of four \( a \) subunits in human and mouse. The *S. cerevisiae* genome encodes two \( a \) subunits that differ in their proton pump energy-coupling efficiency, subcellular localization, and in their subunit association regulation by cellular metabolic status (80). The *C. elegans* genome encodes four \( a \) subunits that differ in their cell type localization and developmental stage of expression (81). In human and mouse, the bone disease osteopetrosis is associated with mutations in a different \( a \) subunit isoform.

Autosomal-recessive osteopetrosis is a rare early-onset disorder of abnormally dense bones caused by failure of osteoclast bone resorption and remodeling (82). Clinical findings include osteosclerosis, pancytopenia due to secondary hematopoietic dysfunction, and hepatosplenomegaly. Associated bony compression of cranial nerves often leads to progressive loss of hearing and vision (but primary degeneration may also contribute). Life expectancy rarely exceeds 20 years, but bone marrow transplantation can be curative. In this complex of diseases, impaired osteoclast-mediated acidification of the bony lacunar space leads to decreased dissolution of calcium apatite at the bone front.

The apical vH\(^+\)-ATPase of the osteoclast is pharmacologically distinct from the renal vH\(^+\)-ATPase and contains in its \( V_0 \) complex the \( a3 \) subunit OC116 (83). OC116 was mapped to chromosome 11q13, syntenic with the murine (*oc*) osteosclerosis mutation (84). The *oc* gene was found to be the mouse ortholog of OC116/\( a3 \). The *oc* mutation in \( a3 \) is a 1.6-kb deletion that includes the translation

initiation site (85). An engineered *a3* knockout mouse also exhibited severe osteopetrosis. Osteoclasts isolated from these animals failed to generate resorption pits on bone chips, but blood and urine pH, renal vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, and hepatic lysosomal vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity were normal (86). In humans, mutations in the *a3* gene account for ~50% of kindreds with recessive osteopetrosis. Nearly all mutations discovered are frameshift or termination mutations (82, 83). The murine osteopetroses resulting from genetic disruption of the mouse genes encoding the c-src tyrosine kinase and the cellular differentiation factor macrophage-colony stimulating factor have not yet been encountered among human osteopetroses.

An alternatively spliced transcript of OC116/*a3* encodes the lymphocyte *a3* protein TIRC7, an N-terminally truncated version beginning at *a3* amino acid 217. Anti-TIRC7 antibodies prevent T cell proliferation triggered by alloantigen or mitogen. Because a soluble fragment of TIRC7 can produce T cell unresponsiveness that can be rescued by interleukin-2, TIRC7 is considered a lymphocyte costimulatory molecule that binds to a surface receptor. Anti-TIRC7 antibody administration in a rat model of acute renal allograft rejection prolonged graft survival (87). However, TIRC7 remains to be implicated in lymphocyte vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase function or to be linked to disease.

## ACID-BASE TRANSPORT DISORDERS OF Cl<sup>−</sup> CHANNEL DISEASES

The ability of the vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase to acidify any lumenal or organellar space can be limited by the associated membrane's conductances for H<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>. H<sup>+</sup> conductance appears to vary progressively along the secretory pathway (88), but Cl<sup>−</sup> conductance is likely also regulated (89). In the absence of these conductances, the vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase can generate a sizable transmembrane electrical potential. However, in order to generate the ~1000-fold pH gradient of which it is capable, the H<sup>+</sup> pump-generated electrical gradient must be shunted by Cl<sup>−</sup> conductance, which allows movement of Cl<sup>−</sup> ion in parallel with H<sup>+</sup>. Thus Cl<sup>−</sup> channels are candidate disease genes for disorders of acid transport.

One such acid transport disease is another form of recessive osteopetrosis. Kornak et al. reported that knockout of the mouse ClC-7 gene leads to early-onset osteopetrosis and retinal degeneration (90). ClC-7 was detected in the ruffled lacunar membrane of the osteoclast, the retina, and other eye tissues, in addition to expression elsewhere. The developmental time course of retinal degeneration preceded apparent bony compression of the optic nerve, suggesting an intrinsic retinal defect. Isolated ClC-7 (−/−) osteoclasts had poorly developed ruffled borders that failed to resorb bone in vitro despite the presence of vH<sup>+</sup>-ATPase at the osteoclast surface. However, these osteoclasts retained the ability to acidify intracellular vesicles that likely correspond to lysosomes or prelysosomal compartments.

The clinical similarity of the mouse disease with human recessive osteopetrosis led to analysis of the CLCN7 gene in 12 cases of the human disease. In one of these

12 cases, compound heterozygosity for CLCN7 mutations Q555X and R762Q was exhibited. Only the missense mRNA was present in patient tissue, but its ClC7 translation product was undetectable in the patient’s fibroblasts (90).

The ClC-5 chloride channel was identified as the gene mutated in Dent’s disease (also referred to as X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis and X-linked recessive hypophosphatemic rickets). Positional cloning was aided by identification of a microdeletion in one patient (91). Dent’s disease is characterized by renal proximal tubular low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hyperphosphaturia, and hypercalciuria that often leads to nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. Untreated cases sometimes progress to renal osteomalacia and to renal insufficiency, occasionally associated with secondary incomplete dRTA (92).

In kidney, ClC-5 polypeptide is expressed in proximal tubule at the base of the brush border and in Type A intercalated cells of cortex, as well as in thick ascending limb (93). Its absence in ClC-5 (-/-) mice (94, 95) and its 90% reduction in a ClC-5 antisense ribozyme transgenic mouse (96) were associated with microproteinuria and with impaired in vivo proximal tubular endocytosis of several types of tagged filtered proteins. However, the several mouse models differed in the penetrance of hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and bone disease. Endocytosis regulated by ClC-5 likely depends on a proline-based internalization signal in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which can interact with WW-domain-containing proteins such as ubiquitin ligases (97). Direct demonstration of ClC-5’s requirement for endosomal acidification is still lacking. However, H⁺-ATPase-mediated luminal acidification was not reduced in isolated perfused CCD or proximal tubule from the antisense ribozyme mouse (98), suggesting that CLC-5 is not required for proximal or distal H⁺ secretion in the mouse, or alternatively that its complete absence is required to detect its contribution to luminal acid secretion. In interesting contrast, expression of CFTR appears to be required for vH⁺-ATPase function in mouse intercalated cells through a mechanism independent of Cl⁻ channel activity (99). Levels of the intercalated cell Cl⁻ channel AQP6 (100, 101) are regulated by acid-base loading protocols (102), but a role for AQP6 in vH⁺-ATPase-mediated luminal or vesicular acidification remains uncertain.

Absence of ClC-3 chloride channel in the ClC-3 (-/-) mouse led to reduced body size and to postnatal degeneration of retina and hippocampus. Although swelling-activated Cl⁻ conductance was unchanged in primary hepatocytes and pancreatic acinar cells of ClC3 (-/-) mice, the rate and extent of synaptic vesicle acidification was reduced compared with that of wild-type littermates (103). This constitutes the first direct evidence of involvement of a mammalian ClC Cl⁻ channel in organellar acidification. It seems likely, although unproven, that the pathology of the ClC-3 (-/-) mouse derives entirely from a reduction of organelar Cl⁻ conductance. Absence of the ClC-2 chloride channel in the ClC-2 (-/-) mouse led to degeneration of male germ cells, postnatal degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells (which never developed outer segments), and reduced transepithelial currents across retinal pigment epithelium (104). However, data on organellar acidification were not presented.

Recent data on CFTR-regulated bicarbonate transport has drawn increasing interest. In a recombinant overexpression system, CFTR-associated bicarbonate transport (but not chloride currents) correlated with clinical state of pancreatic sufficiency, an index of ductal $HCO_3^-$ secretion (105). However, the correlation was less good for high sweat $\left[Cl^-\right]$ (106). CFTR may increase $HCO_3^-$ secretion in pancreatic duct (and perhaps also in bronchial submucous gland and other tissues) either as an intrinsic $HCO_3^-$ channel/transporter or as a regulator of apical $Cl^-/HCO_3^-$ exchangers (likely DRA, CFEX/PAT and/or other SLC26 anion exchangers).

## NBC1 Mutations in Recessive Proximal Renal Tubular Acidosis

Permanent, isolated proximal RTA is a rare autosomal-recessive disease characterized by impaired proximal tubular bicarbonate reabsorption with maintenance of other proximal reabsorption functions, such as those for glucose, amino acids, phosphate, and citrate. This type of proximal RTA can present with growth retardation alone, or together with ocular abnormalities such as band keratopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma, and with mental retardation (107). Dietary bicarbonate supplementation is difficult because the proximal tubular capacity for proximal bicarbonate reabsorption is greatly reduced, and compensatory upregulation of bicarbonate reabsorption in more distal nephron segments is limited. However, very-high-dose bicarbonate supplementation can enhance growth even if correction of metabolic acidosis is incomplete (108).

$Na^+$-bicarbonate cotransport across the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells is required for proximal bicarbonate reabsorption and is almost certainly mediated by the kidney NBC1 isoform of the electrogenic $Na^+$-bicarbonate cotransporter, kNBC1 (109, 110). Therefore, the human NBC1 ($SLC4A4$) gene (111) was evaluated as a candidate gene for isolated proximal RTA in two families, and two missense mutations were found (112). R510H lies within the transmembrane domain of NBC1 at or near the exofacial end of putative TM4, and the R298S mutation is in the putative N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Initial measurement of $Cl^-$-independent, amiloride-resistant $pH_i$ recovery in transfected ECV304 cells acid-loaded by nigericin pretreatment indicated that both mutant polypeptides functioned at ~55% of the wild-type rate (112).

Two additional NBC1 mutations have been found in families with proximal RTA. The $Q29X$ mutation (107) severely truncates the 1007 amino acid kNBC1 protein of kidney, but leaves intact the pNBC1 polypeptide of pancreatic duct and other tissues, whose variant N-terminal sequence (85 unique amino acids in place of the 41 N-terminal residues of kAE1) is generated by alternate promoter usage (111). The missense mutation $S427L$ has been found in an Israeli family (113). Preliminary data in Xenopus oocytes suggest that the mutant NBC1 polypeptide R510H traffics abnormally (114) and that R298S and S427L mutant polypeptides also exhibit impaired transport activities (M. F. Romero, personal communication).

No pancreatic abnormalities have been reported to date in these patients. However, the ocular abnormalities that accompany isolated proximal RTA in these
patients are consistent with the finding that both kNBC1 and pNBC1 are expressed in multiple ocular tissues of human and rat (115). In addition, human lens epithelial cell Na<sup>+</sup>-bicarbonate cotransport and total NBC1 polypeptide are reduced in parallel by recombinant adenoviral transduction of NBC1 antisense ribozyme. Interestingly, the proximal RTA patient with the Q29X NBC1 mutation predicted to preserve pNBC1 biosynthesis has, in addition to mental retardation, bilateral glaucoma without band keratopathy or cataract (107).

The stoichiometry of Na<sup>+</sup>-bicarbonate cotransport in the intact proximal tubule is 3 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>:1 Na<sup>+</sup>, but for kNBC1 expressed in intact *Xenopus* oocytes (116) or macropatches (117) it is 2:1. However, a 2:1 stoichiometry of transport would not support observed rates of proximal tubular bicarbonate reabsorption. Stoichiometry estimates in transfected monolayers of polarized epithelial cells suggest that whereas kNBC1 and pNBC1 display equivalent stoichiometries of Na<sup>+</sup>-HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport, cell type–specific factors can determine that transport stoichiometry (118). The ability of submicromolar \[Ca<sup>2+</sup>\] addition to the cytosolic face of oocyte macropatches to convert kNBC1 stoichiometry from 2:1 to 3:1 (116) suggests a possible mechanism by which missense mutations might impair NBC1 transport function. Reduction of NBC1 transport stoichiometry from 3:1 to 2:1 by protein phosphorylation (119), perhaps mediated by NHERF (120), might also be altered in some mutants. The shift in stoichiometry from 2:1 to 3:1 may represent a change in one of the anion-binding sites from a preference for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to a preference for CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> (116).

The NHE3 (-/-) mouse exhibits a mild metabolic acidosis, with greatly reduced proximal tubular HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reabsorption and distal compensation (121) and lacks proximal tubular Cl<sup>-</sup>/formate exchange (122). Although, human *NHE3* mutations have not yet been reported in proximal RTA, *NHE3* remains a candidate or a modifier gene for the disease.

## Carbonic Anhydrase II Mutations in Mixed Renal Tubular Acidosis

The earliest example of a heritable renal tubular acidosis for which a cause was found was carbonic anhydrase II deficiency (123). This soluble, cytosolic enzyme is widely expressed. Patients with this deficiency exhibit osteopetrosis and cerebral calcification, as well as a mixed RTA with proximal and distal components. In different kindreds, mild or severe mental retardation has been described. Three of the 13 mutations described to date account for ~90% of patients. Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation can correct the osteopetrosis and halt progression of cerebral calcification, but cannot correct the mixed RTA and attendant growth retardation (124).

A carbonic anhydrase II-null mouse was created during an ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis screening program (125). This mouse had renal tubular acidosis with respiratory compensation (126) but lacked osteopetrosis (125). Intercalated cells developed normally in this mouse, but disappeared from the outer medulla and
were depleted from cortex during aging (127). The carbonic anhydrase II-null mouse provided the first example of transient therapeutic correction of a genetic renal defect by gene therapy (128). Retrograde injection into the renal pelvis of a liposome suspension containing plasmid DNA encoding CAII led to renal parenchymal expression of CAII protein and partial, transient correction of the urinary acidification defect. However, because precise cellular localization of CAII polypeptide was not performed, the developmental consequences to collecting duct cell phenotype of restored CAII expression were not determined (125).

# Acid-Base Disturbances Secondary to Genetic Disorders of Renal Na⁺ Reabsorption

Genetic impairment of Na⁺ reabsorption by the ENaC Na⁺ channel of the collecting duct principal cell apical membrane diminishes the electrical driving force favoring intercalated cell H⁺ secretion, as well as principal cell K⁺ secretion. Thus hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis usually accompanies hypotensive salt-wasting syndromes. In addition to recessive deficiencies of aldosterone synthase and steroid-21-hydroxylase, these syndromes include dominant and recessive forms of pseudohypoaldosteronism Type I, due, respectively, to heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor and to homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the α, β, or γ subunits of the ENaC Na⁺ channel (129).

Conversely, genetic enhancement of principal cell ENaC-mediated Na⁺ reabsorption is accompanied by increased collecting duct H⁺ and K⁺ secretion, leading to hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis in the setting of either hypertensive Na⁺ retention or hypotensive salt wasting. Examples include hypertension-associated upregulatory mutations of aldosterone action such as glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency (apparent mineralocorticoid excess), and an activating mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor rendering it sensitive to further activation by steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl groups such as progesterone. Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis can also accompany upregulatory mutations in the β and γ subunits of ENaC in the hypertensive Liddle’s syndrome (129).

Hypokalemic alkalosis in the setting of salt-wasting accompanies loss-of-function mutations of the distal convoluted tubule thiazide receptor NCC1 in Gitelman’s syndrome, as well as loss-of-function mutations in any of three components required for NaCl reabsorption by the thick ascending limb of Henle. These include the bumetanide receptor NKCC2 of the apical membrane, the apical membrane K⁺ channel ROMK, and the basolateral Cl⁻ channel CLCKNB (129). All of these salt-wasting disorders increase luminal Na⁺ presentation to ENaC in the principal cell apical membrane, with consequently enhanced H⁺ and K⁺ secretion.

A novel class of mutation is represented by the rare autosomal-dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism Type II (PHAII), a thiazide-responsive, chloride-dependent, hyperkalemic hypertension sometimes associated with metabolic acidosis. Two genes recently identified in PHAII kindreds encode two isoforms of WNK

serine-threonine kinases. WNK1 polypeptide is present throughout epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. WNK4 is restricted to tight junctions of distal convoluted tubule cells but appears both cytoplasmic and junctional in collecting duct cells (130). The presumed ion transporter substrates or downstream targets of the WNK kinases, and their relationship to urinary H⁺ secretion, remain to be determined.

# CONCLUSION

Acid-base transport is essential to all cells and tissues. Some acid-base transporter polypeptides or subunits are expressed in so wide a range of cell types, or perform functions with so little available redundancy, that loss-of-function mutations might be embryonic lethal. Those genetic disorders of acid-base transport that allow birth and postnatal development tend to have restricted spectra of tissue involvement. This may reflect restriction of mutant gene product expression to the tissues phenotypically affected or indicate that the mutant gene product is normally rate-limiting only in the affected tissues. Such disorders include those arising from mutations in the AE1, DRA, and pendrin Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchangers, select subunits of the vH⁺-ATPase, the NBC1 Na⁺-HCO₃⁻ cotransporter, carbonic anhydrase II, certain organellar Cl⁻ channels, and gene products contributing to renal Na⁺ reabsorption.

The growing number of mouse models of acid-base transport(er) disease reveals that orthologous mutations in mouse and human often exhibit phenotypes that, though similar, differ in important ways. This survey of genetic diseases of acid-base transporters highlights the importance of parallel investigation in multiple experimental systems. Studies of these acid-base transporters must be carried out at molecular, cellular, genetic, and organismic levels. At the organismic level, studies are required in genetically defined model organisms, in mouse, and in humans. Each type of investigation will yield its particular insights.

Figure 2 (See figure on previous page) Model of human AE1 secondary structure highlighting sites of missense or in-frame deletion mutations associated with dRTA (green); frameshift, nonsense, in-frame deletion, and missense mutations associated with HS and other erythroid dyscrasias (orange); and sites of blood group polymorphisms (blue). Consecutive green residues at the C terminus represent the dRTA mutation R901X. Consecutive orange residues at Δ117–22 and Δ400–408 represent in-frame deletions. Met 66 (arrow) is the first residue of the kidney AE1 isoform kAE1. Secondary structure of residues 55–356 in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is based on the crystal structure (131). Arrangement of the transmembrane helices is adapted from Wood (132) and Popov et al. (16). Topographical disposition of TMs 1–9 is supported by covalent labeling or proteolytic cleavage data. The uncertain disposition of TMs 10–12 may include a re-entrant loop (16) or an elongated, flexible transmembrane span (17), either of which has been postulated to contribute to the anion translocation pathway. Approximation of the C-terminal tail to N-terminal residues of AE1 is not meant to imply their interaction.
