### Abstract

Plants belonging to Malvaceae (about 90 species belonging to 33 genera) were analysed for the presence of gossypol by reversed-phase HPLC using absorbance detection at 365 nm, and the chirality and optical purity of gossypol were determined whenever the analysis was positive. Only plants belonging to the cotton tribe (Gossypieae) contained gossypol (detection limit better than 0.001%). In particular, no gossypol could be detected in *Abelmoschus esculentus* (okra), *Hibiscus tiliaceus*, *H*. *sabdariffa*, and *Hevea brasiliensis*, earlier claimed to contain this compound. Gossypol-containing plants usually produced dextrorotatory gossypol of varying optical purity; an enantiomeric excess of (-)-gossypol was detected in only one plant, *Gossypium barbadense*.

### Introduction

The interest in the classical plant product gossypol (1, Fig. 1) (1, 2), known for its ability to inhibit maturation of human sperm (3, 4), has recently been renewed due to the discovery of its selective toxicity towards cancer cells (5–11). Gossypol was originally isolated from cottonseed (*Gossypium* sp., Malvaceae) (1, 2), and was subsequently found in several other, closely related genera: *Cienfuegosia* (12, 13), *Gossypioides* (13), *Hampea* (13), *Kokia* (12), *Lebronnecia* (13), *Montezuma* (14), and *Thespesia* (12, 13, 15–17). The occurrence of gossypol is associated with the presence of distinctive pigment glands which occur throughout all parts of the plant, although some gossypol may be present outside the glands (18, 19). In connection with the pharmacological interest in gossypol, and the influence of the chirality of the molecule on the biological effects (6, 7, 20–22), we have examined a number of Malvaceae for the presence of gossypol, with the emphasis on the occurrence of optically active forms.

### Materials and Methods

#### General

HPLC analyses were carried out with a Waters chromatograph consisting of a model 6000A pump, UV detector model 440 operating at 254 or 365 nm, and a WISP 710A injection system, using columns of Spherisorb ODS, and 2 ml/min of 0.15 M phosphoric acid in acetonitrile/water, 4 : 1 (10 ml/l of conc. phosphoric acid). Occasionally, a Methrom 641 VA electrochemical detector (glassy carbon electrode) operating at +1.1 V was used along with the UV detector.

Preparative HPLC separations were carried out with a chromatograph consisting of a Waters model 590 pump, Rheodyne 7125 injector fitted with a 2 ml loop, Waters LambdaMax 481 flow spectrophotometer equipped with an 80 µl cell, and a 25 × 1.6 cm column of Lichrosorb RP-18, 7 µm, using the same eluent as above at 15 ml/min. Spectrophotometric assay for gossypol (aniline method) was performed according to the standard procedure (23). CD spectra were recorded on a CNRS Roussel-Jouan Dichrographe III. Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin-Elmer model 241 polarimeter.

Racemic gossypol (acetic acid solvate) was obtained from the Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, W. H. O. (+)-Gossypol was isolated from *Thespesia populnea* (L.) Soland ex Correa (15–17), and recrystallized from ether/hexane to constant optical rotation; [α]${}_{D}^{22}$: +374° (c 0.1, CHCl₃); lit. values: +376° (24), +373° (25), +359° (26).

#### Analytical procedure

Finely ground, dried plant material (0.02–10 g, depending on gossypol content) was added to 20–110 ml of 70% aqueous acetone and allowed to stand at room temperature for

6 h, during which the suspension was sonified several times, for 5 min each time. A portion of the extract was clarified by centrifugation and analysed by HPLC (0.8 × 25 cm column packed with 7 μm Spherisorb ODS, injection volume 10–200 μl, detection at 365 nm, detector sensitivity 0.01–0.5 AUFS; k′ = 2.3). Gossypol content in plants was calculated by comparison of electronically integrated areas of gossypol peaks with those obtained with gossypol standards (0.0005–1 mg/ml); the standards were prepared individually for each series of analyses and were used within 24 h. The response of the absorbance detector was linear for up to 0.08 mg of gossypol per injection; the injection of 5 ng of gossypol resulted in a signal-to-noise ratio of 4. Each plant sample was extracted and analysed at least twice; the results never differed by more than 6%.

An investigation of the time course of the extraction was carried out with various samples of *Gossypium* seeds, showing that the extraction was complete after 2–4 h; an extension of the extraction time to 20 h gave results in the range of 92–103% of those obtained using the usual procedure (6 h extraction) with 5 different seed samples. Addition of aliquots of gossypol standards (1–5 mg of gossypol) to various plant material suspensions (0.5–1 g in 100 ml of 70% aqueous acetone) at the beginning of the extraction procedure resulted in recoveries of 90–100% in the case of plants containing gossypol (5 different plants), and 80–95% in the case of plants containing no gossypol (5 different plants).

### Determination of optical purity of gossypol

When the above HPLC analysis showed the presence of gossypol, the extract was evaporated (rotatory evaporator followed by freeze-drying). Alternatively, a fresh portion of the plant material was extracted with diethyl ether in a Soxhlet apparatus, and the extract evaporated. The residue was dissolved in acetonitrile, and injected to the preparative HPLC column, collecting the gossypol band. The concentration of gossypol in the eluate was determined spectrophotometrically (λmax 365 nm, εmax 16,200 in the HPLC mobile phase). Optical purity of gossypol was determined by CD on the basis of Δε + 14.0 at 378 nm (in the same solvent).

### Results and Discussion

Although gossypol has been known for almost a century (1, 2), its optically active forms were encountered relatively recently (14–17, 27). The optical activity of gossypol is due to the axial dissymmetry of the molecule (atropisomerism), as shown in Fig. 1. The facts that (+)-gossypol was isolated from plants (14–17, 27), and that racemic gossypol can be separated chemically into optically stable enantiomers (24–26, 28, 29), show that the compound does not racemize easily. This is also expected from the presence of four substituents ortho to the pivot bond connecting the two naphthyl moieties (30, 31). Recent thermal racemization experiments and theoretical studies (32) also showed that gossypol has a prohibitively high barrier to rotational inversion. Thus, although racemization of some derivatives of gossypol can indeed be observed at high temperatures (32), the optical stability of gossypol itself under conditions of the analysis is ascertained.

A number of HPLC procedures for determination of gossypol in various materials have been reported; most of the methods use reversed-phase systems with acidified, aqueous methanol or acetonitrile as the mobile phase (33–40). Since methanol can form acetals

with gossypol, acetonitrile is preferred, and good results were obtained with 0.15 M phosphoric acid in acetonitrile/water, 4:1, and Spherisorb ODS as the stationary phase. However, satisfactory peak shapes were obtained only after the columns were washed for several hours with the mobile phase or a solution of EDTA (Fig. 2). Gossypol is a good metal complexing agent, and the broadening of peaks is presumably due to metal ions initially present in the stationary phase, and removed by prolonged rinsing; similar effects of metal ion impurities on HPLC separations were observed earlier with other metal chelators (41).

Gossypol was extracted from plants with 70% aqueous acetone, which is a powerful and relatively selective solvent used in standard methods of gossypol analysis (23, 42); the extract could be injected into the HPLC columns directly. Absorbance detection at 365 nm (at the long-wavelength absorption maximum of gossypol) gave good selectivity, since only few constituents of plant extracts absorbed significantly at this wavelength. The observed signal-to-noise ratio (see Materials and Methods) corresponded to a detection limit of 0.001 % or better, depending on sample preparation. Although absorbance detection at 254 nm offered twice as high sensitivity, the selectivity for the present application was poor. This is also true for electrochemical detection, where as little as 0.1 ng of gossypol per injection could be detected, but the plant extracts contained a lot of interfering compounds. Examples of typical chromatograms are shown in Figs. 3 and 4.

Tables 1 and 2 list plants analysed for gossypol with negative and positive results, respectively. One of the aims of this work was to search for gossypol in Malvaceae not belonging to the cotton tribe, Gossypieae

(19). Some species belonging to the closely related family Bombaceae were also included. However, only plants belonging to the Gossypieae were found to contain gossypol.

Gossypol has previously been reported in a few non-Gossypieae species, but using spectrophotometric methods of analysis. Thus, the okra seed (Abelmoschus esculentus) was claimed to contain gossypol (43, 44). Moreover, gossypol was reported in the seeds of Hibiscus sabdariffa (45), and in trace amounts in the root of a single collection of *H. tiliaceus* (46). Gossypol was also claimed to be present in the seed meal of Hevea brasiliensis (the rubber tree, Euphorbiaceae) (47), a species taxonomically distant from the Malvaceae.

We analysed several samples of *H. brasiliensis* seeds, as well as the seed meal used in the original work (47). No traces of gossypol were found in either case. On the other hand, we can confirm that the spectrophotometric method of analysis (23) used in the original work (47) gives a non-zero absorbance in the final measurement, but the absorption curve obtained is different from that resulting from gossypol. The positive result obtained with *H. brasiliensis* seed meal is thus false. Similarly, we were not able to detect any traces of gossypol in *A. esculentus* seeds (Fig. 3), nor was gossypol found in any of several Hibiscus species investigated, including *H.*

sabdariffa and *H. tiliaceus* (Fig. 4). Although the claim about the presence of gossypol in *A. esculentus* was recently reissued (48), our negative results are in agreement with those of Bell et al. (49) and Stipanovic et al. (50), who investigated many cultivars of the plant. In addition, Abelmoschus and Hibiscus species have no pigment glands typical for gossypol-producing plants (18, 19).

Table 2 lists plants from which gossypol was isolated, and its chirality and optical purity determined by CD. The plants producing gossypol usually contained fairly large amounts (Fig. 3), but the compound was found to be quite unevenly distributed between various plant parts. All but one of the plant samples analysed contained dextrorotatory gossypol with optical purity varying from 26% to 100%. Thespesia and Montezuma were previously shown to contain (+)-gossypol, but its optical purity was not determined (14–17). Azanza is a new source of (+)-gossypol. The cotton plant (*Gossypium hirsutum*) is often regarded as producing racemic gossypol, but the plant consistently yields a significant enantiomeric excess of (+)-gossypol (Table 2) (27, 51–53); the racemate is obtained only when acetic acid is used to precipitate gossypol from the plant extract, since (+)-gossypol does not form the solvate (15). In agreement with earlier observations (51–53), *Gossypium barbadense* contained levorotatory gossypol with moderate optical purity (Table 2).

Gossypol is biosynthesized by oxidative dimerization of hemigossypol (54). It has been proposed that all plants in fact synthesize (+)-gossypol, but the compound racemizes to a variable extent during its isolation (55). However, since gossypol does not racemize easily (32), the determinations of enantiomeric excess of gossypol could in the present work be made reproducibly, and the sources of (-)-gossypol exist, the hypothesis does not hold. What determines the occurrence of (+)- and (-)-gossypol in a particular ratio in a given plant is a fascinating problem that remains to be solved. In principle, the variable ratios may not only be due to the biosynthetic process, but may result from different rates of turnover of the enantiomers. As far as presently known, gossypol appears to be found only in Gossypieae, and we could not confirm any of previous reports about its occurrence in other Malvaceae.
