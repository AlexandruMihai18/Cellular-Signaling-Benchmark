### Abstract

Arachidonic acid (AA) can undergo monooxygenation or epoxidation by enzymes in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family in the brain, kidney, lung, vasculature, and the liver. CYP-AA metabolites, 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and diHETEs have different biological properties based on sites of production and can be stored in tissue lipids and released in response to hormonal stimuli. 20-HETE is a vasoconstrictor, causing blockade of Ca${}^{++}$-activated K${}^{+}$ (K${}_{\text{Ca}}$) channels. Inhibition of the formation of nitric oxide (NO) by 20-HETE mediates most of the cGMP-independent component of the vasodilator response to NO. 20-HETE elicits a potent dilator response in human and rabbit pulmonary vascular and bronchiolar rings that is dependent on an intact endothelium and COX. 20-HETE is also a vascular oxygen sensor, inhibits Na${}^{+}$/K${}^{+}$-ATPase activity, is an endogenous inhibitor of the Na${}^{+}$-K${}^{+}$-2Cl${}^{-}$ cotransporter, mediates the mitogenic actions of vasoactive agents and growth factors in many tissues and plays a significant role in angiogenesis. EETs, produced by the vascular endothelium, are potent dilators. EETs hyperpolarize VSM cells by activating K${}_{\text{Ca}}$ channels. Several investigators have proposed that one or more EETs may serve as endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF). EETs constrict human and rabbit bronchioles, are potent mediators of insulin and glucagon release in isolated rat pancreatic islets, and have anti-inflammatory activity.

Compared with other organs, the liver has the highest total CYP content and contains the highest levels of individual CYP enzymes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. In humans, 50–75% of CYP-dependent AA metabolites formed by liver microsomes are ω/ω-OH-AA, mainly w-OH-AA, i.e. 20HETE, and 13–28% are EETs. Very little information is available on the role of 19- and 20-HETE and EETs in liver function. EETs are involved in vasopressin-induced glycogenolysis, probably via the activation of phosphorylase. In the portal vein, inhibition of EETs exerts profound effects on a variety of K-channel activities in smooth muscles of this vessel. 20-HETE is a weak, COX-dependent, vasoconstrictor of the portal circulation. EETs, particularly 11,12-EET, cause

vasoconstriction of the porto-sinusoidal circulation. Increased synthesis of EETs in portal vessels and/or sinusoids or increased levels in blood from the mesenteric circulation may participate in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension of cirrhosis. CYP-dependent AA metabolites are involved in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension, not only by increasing resistance in the porto-sinusoidal circulation, but also by increasing portal inflow through mesenteric vasodilation. In patients with cirrhosis, urinary 20-HETE is several-fold higher than PGs and TxB2, whereas in normal subjects, 20-HETE and PGs are excreted at similar rates. Thus, 20-HETE is probably produced in increased amounts in the preglomerular microcirculation accounting for the functional decrease of flow and increase in sodium reabsorption.

In conclusion, CYP-AA metabolites represent a group of compounds that participate in the regulation of liver metabolic activity and hemodynamics. They appear to be deeply involved in abnormalities related to liver diseases, particularly cirrhosis, and play a key role in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension and renal failure.

1. **Introduction**

Arachidonic acid (AA), a widely distributed polyunsaturated fatty acid once liberated from phospholipids by phospholipases, can undergo either monooxygenation or epoxidation by enzymes in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family. CYP-AA metabolites, 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and diHETEs (Fig. 1), have different biological properties based on sites of production—the endothelium of vessels in various organs, the lung, the tubular and corneal epithelium, the liver. The likely targets are either enzymes (Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase) or ion channels (calcium activated potassium channels). The involvement of conventional receptor physiology in the tissue responses to CYP-AA products remains an open question.

2. **Biochemistry**

Several isoforms of CYP families that metabolize AA have been identified and cloned.

### 2.1. 20-HETE

Recombinant CYP4A1, 4A2 and 4A3 enzymes, and possibly 4A8, have been reported to produce 20-HETE when incubated with AA [1,2]. CYP4A2 and 4A3 mRNA have been shown in small arterioles of the rat kidney [3,4] cat brain [5], skeletal muscle, and liver [6]. Human liver and kidney express mRNA for the CYP4A11 and CYP4F2 isoforms; however, CYP4F2 now appears to be the isoform chiefly responsible for the formation of 20-HETE in the human kidney [7], rat glomeruli [4,8], proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TALH) of rats [8,9], and in both the airways and vasculature of the lungs of rabbits [10,11]. Microsomes prepared from all these tissues produce 20-HETE

when incubated with AA in the presence of adequate oxygen tension (PO₂ > 6650 Pa) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP).

### 2.2. EETs

The CYP2C family is involved in the production of EETs. Specific examples of this family include a CYP2C11 enzyme present in astrocytes in the brain [12], CYP2C8 and 2C9 in human liver [13,14] and endothelial cells [15], 2C2 in rabbit kidney [16], CYP2C29, 2C38 and 2C39 in the liver, kidney and brain of mice [17] and CYP2C23 in the kidney of rats [18]. Also CYP1A, 2B and 2J catalyze the formation of EETs in various tissues [19–22]. The formation in various tissues is highly dependent on experimental conditions.

### 2.3. Regulation of CYP enzymes

CYP4A1 and 4A3 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the neonatal rat kidney and decline in adulthood [23]. CYP4A2 is the dominant isoform expressed in the kidneys of adult male rats [23]. In the proximal tubule, angiotensin (AngII) increases the formation of 5,6-EET [24], while 20-HETE formation is stimulated by endothelin-1 (ET-1) [25], epidermal growth factor (EGF) [26], dopamine [27] and parathyroid hormone [28,29]. In the TALH, a variety of peptide hormones increases the formation of 20-HETE [30–32]. A high-salt diet decreases the expression of CYP4A proteins in the kidney and peripheral vasculature [4,33–37] which is preventable by maintaining circulating AngII levels by i.v. infusion [38]. Interestingly, a high-salt intake has also been reported to increase the expression of CYP2C23 and the formation of EETs in the kidney of some strains of rats [18,37,39]. Thus, the chronic adaptation to a high-salt diet may involve upregulation of renal epoxygenase activity that would contribute to elevations in renal sodium excretion. Glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and progesterone [6,40,41] increase renal CYP4A activity. Hypolipidaemic agents such as clofibrate, increase the synthesis of 20-HETE in the liver and kidney [6,42] by inducing the expression of CYP4A1 and 4A3. Inducers of other CYP enzymes, such as phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene and 3,4-benzo(a)pyrene, do not alter renal CYP4A activity [6]. A variety of hormones (i.e. AngII, noradrenaline, vasopressin and endothelin) activate phospholipases and increase the synthesis and release of 20-HETE in the kidney and in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) [30].

The expression and/or the activity of CYP enzymes responsible for the metabolism of AA is increased in diabetes [43], pregnancy [40,44], hepatorenal syndrome [45], cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity [46] and alcohol-induced liver disease [47]. The synthesis of 20-HETE and expression of CYP4A enzymes is elevated in the kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) [9,36,48] and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) salt-hypertensive rats [49], but it is reduced in the kidney of Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats [34,35].

### 2.4. Inhibitors of the formation and metabolism of 20-HETE and EETs

SKF 525 [30], and agents that induce haeme oxygenase [48] were used initially to reduce the formation of EET, and 20-HETE in experimental animals. 1-Aminobenzotriazole

(ABT) has recently been shown to reduce the formation of 20-HETE in the kidney [19]. 17-Octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) is a more specific suicide substrate inhibitor of CYP4A enzymes [50]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that 17-ODYA irreversibly blocks the formation of 20-HETE in renal and vascular tissues at concentrations greater than 1 mmol/l [51]. Unfortunately, it is equally as effective in blocking the formation of EET. More recently, Falck et al. have developed other inhibitors, such as dibromododecenoic acid (DBDD) and dibromododecenyl methylsulphimide (DDMS), that appear to be more selective inhibitors of the formation of 20-HETE [52,53]. The imidazole antimycotic agents (miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole and clotrimazole) selectively inhibit epoxygenase activity [54]. They act by binding to haeme, and inhibit the activity of many enzymes, including enzymes involved in drug metabolism, steroidogenesis [55], and the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) [49]. They also have direct effects on intracellular calcium release and ion channels [56,57]. More recently, Nguyen et al. [1] have reported that two new compounds, namely 6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)-hexanoic acid (PPOH) and methylsulphonyl-6-(2-propargyloxy- phenyl)-hexanoic acid (PPOMS), are more selective epoxygenase inhibitors. These compounds completely block epoxygenase activity at concentrations of 1–10 mmol/l and have little effect on the formation of 20-HETE.

NO exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on CYP metabolism of AA [58]. Removal of the suppressant effects of NO by inhibiting NO synthase (NOS) will result in marked perturbations of renal function resulting from increased production of 20-HETE [59,60]. Contrarily, increased production of NO will inhibit 20-HETE synthesis [52]. These interactions operate at the renal tubular and vascular levels and are important in setting the level of activities of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), K⁺ channels, and renal vasomotion [61–63].

### 2.5. Transformation of CYP-AA metabolites by cyclooxygenase (COX)

The most extensively studied renal CYP-AA metabolite in terms of transformation by COX is 20-HETE [64,65] (Fig. 1). It is converted by COX to a vasoconstrictor prostaglandin (PG) H₂ analog (20-OH PGH₂) that undergoes additional transformation by isomerases to vasodilator-diuretic metabolites (20-OH PGE₂, 20-OH PGI₂) and vasoconstrictor-antidiuretic metabolites (20-OH thromboxane (Tx)A₂, 20-OH PGF₂α) [66]. COX-related metabolism has been proposed to couple changes in transport in tubular segments to local blood flow, effected by a vasoactive product of metabolism of 20-HETE by COX [67]. Increased production of 20-HETE by the proximal tubules and the mTALH, the principal sites of ω-hydroxylase in the nephron, will reduce Na⁺ reabsorption in these nephron segments by the action of the untransformed eicosanoid [68,69]. Subsequently, extrusion of 20-HETE contraluminally into the interstitial space will facilitate metabolism of 20-HETE by COX to vasoactive analogs such as 20-OH PGE₂ and 20-OH PGH₂ that can affect local blood flow. 20-HETE, like 5,6-EET [70], also has the ability to release prostaglandins as relaxation of the bovine coronary artery by 20-HETE was related to stimulation of prostacyclin release from the artery [71]. The subterminal HETEs, 16-, 18-, and 19-HETE, which are synthesized by the kidney, are also substrates for COX [72]. The 5,6 epoxide shows an extensive COX dependency that has three components [73], which vary with the vascular territory and the species: (1) 5,6-EET releases PGs; (2) 5,6-EET is transformed by COX to vasoactive PG analogs; and (3) COX metabolism of 5,6-EET can generate reactive

oxygen species, having vasoactive effects that may account for cerebral vasodilation in the cat [74].

# 3. Actions of 20-HETE and EETs

## 3.1. 20-HETE

20-HETE is a potent constrictor (EC₅₀ < 10⁻⁸ mol/l) of renal and cerebral arteries [3,5,8,30,75]. It causes blockade of Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ (KCa) channels, thereby promoting Ca²⁺ entry by depolarizing vascular smooth muscle cells [5,76] and by increasing the conductance of L-type Ca²⁺ channels [75]. Inhibitors of the formation of 20-HETE activate KCa channels in VSM cells, an effect that can be reversed by nanomolar concentrations of 20-HETE [76]. Thus, 20-HETE is normally produced in small blood vessels, where it serves as an intracellular second messenger that regulates the activity of KCa channels. The signal transduction mechanism(s) by which 20-HETE inhibits the activity of KCa channels remains to be determined. 20-HETE activates protein kinase C (PKC); inhibitors of PKC block the vasoconstrictor response to 20-HETE and its effects on KCa channels in cat cerebral VSM cells [77]. 20-HETE has been reported recently to activate PKC and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in rat renal VSM cells [78]. The activation of PKC by 20-HETE has been linked to inhibition of the Na⁺ pump (Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase). Inhibition of either PKC or MAPK activity does not alter the effects of 20-HETE on KCa channel activity or vascular tone in these arteries. Rather, the effects of 20-HETE on KCa channels and vessel tone were blocked by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases [78]. Consistent with this view, Mutahalif et al. [79] and Uddin et al. [80] have recently shown that 20-HETE activates the MAPK pathway in rat aortic VSM cells and that blockade of 20-HETE formation prevents the mitogenic effects of noradrenaline. Taken together, these results indicate that 20-HETE likely activates multiple signaling cascades that impact on ion channel activity, vascular tone and growth in various cell types. Considerable evidence now supports the critical role of 20-HETE in the regulation of vascular tone both in vivo and in vitro, particularly in terms of regulation of renal autoregulation. In this regard, AA has been shown to augment the myogenic response of isolated perfused arteries to elevations in transmural pressure and inhibitors of the formation of 20-HETE block this effect [81]. Blockade of the formation of 20-HETE impairs autoregulation of renal and cerebral blood flow in vivo [9,81]. CYP inhibitors decrease the vasoconstrictor responses to vasopressin, AngII, endothelin and noradrenaline both in vivo and in vitro [30,37,48,81]. 20-HETE also appears to play a major role in the regulation of tubuloglomerular feedback in the kidney [63] acting either as a primary mediator of TGF or as a second messenger at the level of the afferent arteriole to transduce the vasoconstrictor response to some other mediator released by the macula densa. 20-HETE also may serve as a vascular oxygen sensor [40].

NO binds to the haeme moiety in CYP4A enzymes and inhibits the formation of 20-HETE [52,61,82]. This mediates most of the cGMP-independent component of the vasodilator response to NO by activating KCa channels in both renal and cerebral arteriolar VSM cells in response to removal of the inhibitory action of 20-HETE. A similar relation is emerging between 20-HETE and the endogenous carbon monoxide (CO)/haeme oxygenase systems.

In the rat, the glomerulus, proximal tubule and TALH express mRNA and protein for CYP4A2 and 4A3 [8], producing 20-HETE when incubated with AA [4,8,9,30]. 20-HETE is the primary metabolite of AA produced in proximal tubules where it inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity [27,83] by increasing PKC-induced phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the sodium pump [27]. The inhibitory effects of dopamine [27], parathyroid hormone [28,29] and elevations in renal perfusion pressure [84] on Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and sodium transport in the proximal tubule appear to involve activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and increased 20-HETE and/or EET formation. The major metabolite of AA produced in TALH cells is 20-HETE, where it serves as an endogenous inhibitor of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter in the rabbit [85]. 20-HETE also blocks a 70 pS K<sup>+</sup> channel in the apical membrane of TALH cells [86]. Blockade of this channel limits K<sup>+</sup> availability for recycling via the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup> transporter. It also reduces the lumen positive transepithelial potential that serves as the main driving force for the passive reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the TALH. The recent findings that CYP inhibitors increase and 20-HETE decreases transepithelial potential and chloride transport in rat isolated TALH perfused in vitro [87] support this view. The inhibitory effects of AngII [31], bradykinin [32] and elevations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration on sodium transport in the TALH are thought to be mediated by 20-HETE because these effects are blocked by inhibitors of ω-hydroxylase. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the effects of NO [86] and CO [88] on K+ channel activity and sodium transport in the TALH may be linked to inhibition of the formation of 20-HETE.

There is increasing evidence that 20-HETE mediates the mitogenic actions of vasoactive agents and growth factors in many tissues. 20-HETE (10–9 mol/l) promotes the growth of cultured cells and the mitogenic actions of EGF in these cells are blocked by CYP inhibitors [26]. Moreover, the MAPK signaling cascade is activated by 20-HETE and the mitogenic effects of EGF and noradrenaline in cultured aortic VSM cells are mediated by elevations in 20-HETE [78–80]. These studies indicate that CYP metabolites of AA may play a significant role in angiogenesis, proliferation of mesangial cells and the development of glomerulosclerosis (a mitogenic condition) in disease states such as hypertension, diabetes and immune injury.

Jacobs et al. [10] have recently reported that human, rabbit and canine pulmonary arteries and bronchial rings produce 20-HETE and express proteins that are recognized by a rat CYP4A antibody. In the pulmonary circulation, the effects of 20-HETE are opposite to those reported in the peripheral vasculature; namely, 20-HETE elicits a potent dilator response in human and rabbit pulmonary vascular and bronchiolar rings that is dependent on an intact endothelium and COX [10]. These findings suggest that COX metabolizes 20-HETE in the rabbit lung to a vasodilator product.

## 3.2. EETs

EETs, produced by the vascular endothelium, are potent dilators of rat renal [89,90] cat cerebral [91] and bovine coronary arteries [92,93]. EETs are also produced by brain astrocytes [94], cardiac tissue [95], airway and parenchymal tissues in the lung [96], and renal tubular cells [8,30,41]. In these tissues, they act as autocrine and paracrine factors that influence vascular tone. EETs hyperpolarize VSM cells by activating K<sub>Ca</sub> channels [90,91,93,97]; however, it is not known how EETs alter K<sub>Ca</sub> channel activity. In rat renal

[90] and cat cerebral arteries [91], 14,15-, 11,12- and 8,9-EET are equipotent dilators. In contrast, 5,6-EET is a potent constrictor of rat renal afferent arterioles [89]. This effect appears to be mediated by a COX metabolite because it can be blocked by indomethacin. The effects of EETs on K⁺ channels are stereospecific in renal arteriolar VSM, in that $R,S$ isomers are active, while the $S,R$ isomers are inactive [90], suggesting that there may be an EET receptor in VSM cells. 11,12-EET activates $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels in membrane patches excised from coronary artery VSM cells in a manner dependent on GTP and ATP with activation of the α-subunit of Gs-protein [107]. However, in the renal circulation, Imig et al. [98] reported that the vasodilator response to 5,6-EET is dependent on activation of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A (PKA), similar to the effects of prostacyclin and PGE₂.

Several investigators have proposed that one or more EETs may serve as endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF), based on the findings that EETs produced in the endothelium hyperpolarize VSM cells [90,93,99,100]. EDHF activity is defined as relaxations to an agonist in the presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and PG synthase and associated with endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that in the renal, coronary and mesenteric arteries, CYP inhibitors attenuate the responses to endothelial-derived vasodilators in the presence of NOS and COX inhibitors [49]. Conversely, in the guinea-pig carotid and cerebral arteries [101] and rat mesenteric arteries [102], CYP inhibitors have no effect on the responses to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. Many large conduit vessels such as the rabbit carotid artery, rat and rabbit aorta, also exhibit EDHF activity, but do not produce CYP metabolites of AA [49]. On the basis of these studies, it has been suggested that blockade of EDHF actions by CYP inhibitors are due to non-specific effects of these compounds on K⁺ channel activity [56] and calcium [57]. The issue as to whether endothelial-derived EETs serve as EDHF and play a major role in the regulation of vascular tone remains to be resolved.

Astrocytes in the brain express CYP2C11 mRNA and protein and produce EET when incubated with AA [94]. EETs are potent dilators of both cat and rat cerebral arterioles [12,91] and the production and release of an EET from astrocytes is stimulated markedly by glutamate and other excitatory amino acids [103]. Based on these results, an interesting hypothesis has emerged, namely an EET from cortical astrocytes is thought to be stimulated by ‘spillover’ of glutamate and other neurotransmitters from local neurons. Thus, this may be the mechanism by which local elevations in neuronal activity redistribute blood flow to active regions of the brain [12]. Recent findings indicating that selective epoxygenase inhibitors and antisense cDNA to CYP2C11 block the vasodilator response to local administration of glutamate in the rat brain support this hypothesis [103].

Proximal tubules, glomeruli, renal vessels and cultured cortical collecting duct cells produce EETs when incubated with AA [4,8,9,41]. Inhibitors of CYP also block the inhibitory effects of AngII on rabbit proximal tubule reabsorption [24]. AngII increases the formation of 5,6-EET, which in turn affects the translocation of the Na⁺–H⁺ exchanger in the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells.

In the renal proximal tubules of the mouse, enzymes of the CYP2J family are highly expressed and they may serve as another source of EETs [22]. EETs activate the Na⁺–H⁺ exchanger in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells [104], which suggests that they may contribute to the regulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Furthermore, EETs have also
been implicated as second messengers for the natriuretic effects of AngII in the proximal tubule of rabbits [24], perhaps by regulating intracellular Ca²⁺ release and the Na⁺–H⁺ exchanger. EETs directly activate K<sub>Ca</sub> channels and relax airway smooth muscle [105]. However, there is preliminary evidence that EETs constrict human and rabbit bronchioles. Should these observations be confirmed, increased inhalational exposure to organic chemicals may lead to induction of CYP isozymes that produce and/or metabolize EET. Induction of CYP enzymes, thus, may contribute to the alarming rise in the incidence of asthma in the US. Falck et al. [106] have shown that EETs are potent mediators of insulin and glucagon release in isolated rat pancreatic islets. These effects are very highly regioselective in that 5,6-EET stimulated insulin secretion but had no effect on glucagon release, and 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14-15-EET increased glucagon release without affecting insulin secretion. Zeldin et al. [107] have shown that CYP2J2, a recently identified human CYP-AA epoxygenase, is highly localized to cells in the islets of Langerhans, with minimal staining in pancreatic exocrine cells. Furthermore, colocalization studies using antibodies to the glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptides (PP) as markers for alfa, beta, delta and PP cells, respectively, showed that CYP2J2 protein expression was abundantly present in all four cell types, but was highest in the glucagon-producing alfa-cells. The authors have also documented the presence of EETs in vivo in human and rat pancreas.

Node et al. [108] have evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of EETs. Endothelial cells exposed to TNFα produce adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). When incubated in the presence of 11,12-EET, but not 14,15-EET, VCAM-1 expression was inhibited by about 70%. The expression of VCAM-1 in response to other inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1α, bacterial lipopolysaccharide was also inhibited by 11,12-EET. These effects were not reproducible with other K<sub>Ca</sub> channel blockers, indicating that the mechanism is independent of EET’s hyperpolarizing effects. Further, inhibition of TNFα-induced VCAM-1 expression could be inhibited also by overexpression of CYP2J2. Inhibition of VCAM-1 expression involved inhibition of NF-κB. These results also could be reproduced in the murine carotids, where TNFα stimulated mononuclear cell adhesion and VCAM-1 expression which could be inhibited by 11,12-EET, but not 14,15-EET infusion. These data induced the Authors to conclude that CYP epoxygenase-derived eicosanoids may be useful therapeutic agents for treating vascular and non vascular inflammatory disorders.

## 4. Storage of CYP-AA products

HETEs and EETs can be stored in tissue lipids [109] and released in response to hormonal stimuli as, for example, ANGII-stimulated, receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids [110]. In contrast, prostaglandins are not stored, being synthesized on demand. Preformed HETEs and EETs, bound to lipids, represent a significant reservoir in those tissues in which they have been measured: the liver [109], kidney [110], and platelets [111]. Additionally, membrane properties, as reflected by changes in permeability and activity of membrane-bound enzymes, can be altered by esterified CYP-AA metabolites [112]. Because inhibitors of CYP enzymes will not prevent release of preformed CYP-AA products from lipid storage sites, the efficacy of inhibitors of CYP enzymes may be misinterpreted
as being low. For example, despite adequate inhibition of CYP monooxygenase activity, ANGII released large quantities of HETEs from the kidney by stimulating a phospholipase that cleaved HETEs from the Sn-2 position of the phospholipid, a site of storage of HETEs [110].

## 5. Receptors for CYP-AA products?

CYP-AA products appear to act primarily within the cell of origin and, unlike most of the effects of prostaglandins, need not be extruded into the extracellular space in order to stimulate membrane receptors either on the cell of origin or nearby cells. However, a high affinity binding site for 14,15-EET was identified in membranes obtained from mononuclear cells [113].

Unlike PGs, CYP-AA products act primarily as autocrine rather than paracrine eicosanoids. PGs affect not only the cell of origin via stimulation of receptors coupled to G proteins but also contiguous cells and, in some instances, cells in remote sites [114]. The ability of 11,12-EET to increase the activity of Kca in bovine coronary artery smooth muscle was reported to be dependent on the activation of a stimulatory G protein, an effect consistent with a conventional receptor-operated mechanism [115]. However, involvement of a G protein in EET-induced activation of Kca could not be demonstrated in the bovine trachea; a direct effect of EETs was proposed, i.e. the Kca itself may be the receptor [116]. This area is open and mostly unexplored and invites definitive studies.

## 6. CYP-AA in the liver

Compared with other organs, the liver has the highest total CYP content and contains the highest levels of individual CYP enzymes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids [117]. In 1981, Capdevila et al. [118] demonstrated for the first time that the liver can oxidatively metabolize AA in the presence of NADPH and oxygen. The transformation to a mixture of HETEs was related to membrane-bound CYP. The rat liver microsomes can oxidize AA by a NADPH-dependent oxygenase to 9-, 11-, 12-, 15-HETEs [119], to 16-, 17-, 18-HETEs [120] and 19- and 20-HETE [121] as shown in the kidney and other tissues. The rat liver was also shown to form EETs, which were stored in the liver itself [122]. EETs were the principal products of liver microsomal metabolism of AA: the liver contains on the order of 0.5–1 ug of EETs/g of wet weight [120,123–125].

In humans, 50–75% of CYP-dependent AA metabolites formed by liver microsomes were ω/ω-OH-AA, mainly ω-OH-AA, i.e. 20-HETE, and 13–28% were EETs [124]. Very little information is available on the role of these compounds in liver function. Inhibition of CYP-dependent AA metabolites, particularly EETs, decreases the increment of cytosolic calcium concentration in vasopressin-stimulated hepatocytes, suggesting that EETs are involved in vasopressin-induced glycogenolysis, probably via the activation of phosphorylase, by increasing the cytosolic calcium concentration [126].

The regulation of CYP in liver physiological and pathophysiological conditions is very complex. Qu et al. [127] have evaluated the effect of fasting on liver CYP metabolism of AA.

Effect of decrease of EETs through inhibition of epoxygenase with miconazole (1 μM) or induction of heme oxygenase with CoCl₂ (24 mg/kg per day i.p. for 2 days) on the vasoconstrictive effect of phenylephrine (PE; 5 μg) and endothelin-1 (ET-1; 40 ng) on porto-sinusoidal circulation in isolated perfused normal rat liver (*n* = 8) (*P* < 0.05 vs. control ET-1).

After a 48-h fast, total liver CYP content was not changed, while microsomal synthesis of CYP-dependent AA metabolites was significantly reduced. The decrease was about 25% for 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET and 63% for 5,6-EET, an eicosanoid which stimulates insulin release by pancreatic islets [128]. Concerning HETEs, 20-HETE formation was decreased, while 19-HETE was more than doubled. Regarding the effects of fasting on CYP isozyymes, a 35% decrease in CYP2C11 and a 40% increase in CYP2E1 were found, the effect of fasting being at the pretranslational level.

We have evaluated the effects of 20-HETE and EETs on the porto-sinusoidal circulation of the rat [129]. EETs, particularly 11,12-EET, caused vasoconstriction of the porto-sinusoidal circulation, and mediated, in part, the vasoconstrictor response to ET-1 (Fig. 2). 20-HETE was a weaker vasoconstrictor, an effect which was COX-dependent, as pretreatment with indomethacin abolished it.

It has been suggested that liver EETs may also be secreted into the circulation and have effects in extrahepatic tissues [125,130].

## 7. CYP-AA in liver diseases

In liver cirrhosis in humans, George et al. [131] have shown that total microsomal cytochrome P450 content is decreased, both in cholestatic and non-cholestatic diseases. Individual isozyymes were variably affected by cholestatic disease; both decreased and unaffected isozyymes were identified. As some of these isozyymes are able to form EETs, it seems likely that under these conditions CYP AA metabolism is affected.

We have studied hepatic production of CYP-dependent AA metabolites in carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis in rat. Incubation of liver microsomes with C14-labelled AA showed a decreased production of CYP-AA metabolites in cirrhotic livers (Fig. 3A), mainly related to EETs (Fig. 3B). In a different pathophysiological condition, i.e. the regenerating

Fig. 3. (A) Production of CYP-AA by liver microsomes from control and cirrhotic rats. Microsomes (0.3 mg protein) were incubated with \[^{14}C\]-AA (0.2 μCi), indomethacin and NADPH for 30 min. Metabolites were separated by thin-layer chromatography. Radioactive zones were visualized by autoradiography and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. (B) Differential production of CYP-AA metabolites by liver microsomes from control and cirrhotic animals. Microsomes (0.3 mg protein) were incubated with \[^{14}C\]-AA (0.4 μCi), indomethacin, and NADPH for 30 min. ω-Hydroxylation compounds, EETs and the corresponding diols (DHT) were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (*P < 0.05).

liver after 2/3 hepatectomy, CYP content as well as its activities were decreased, but microsomal production of CYP-AA metabolites was unchanged [132]. The significance of these findings is not clear. However, the reduction in EETs may play a role in liver regeneration or fibrosis, suggesting that stimulation of epoxygenase could be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of liver diseases leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Zygmunt and co-workers [133] have evaluated the effects of 17-ODYA and clotrimazole in the portal vein and have shown that inhibition of EETs exerts profound effects on a variety of K-channel activities in smooth muscles of this vessel. In experimental cirrhosis in the rat,

we have evaluated the role of CYP-dependent AA metabolites in the pathophysiology of increased portal resistance [134]. We hypothesized that 20-HETE participated in the increase in portal resistance as it was produced by the liver. When we inhibited 20-HETE with DBDD, in the isolated perfused cirrhotic liver, it was without effect on perfusion pressure. In contrast, when we inhibited epoxygenase with miconazole, portal perfusion pressure was decreased, while in normal animals it did not change. Thus, it can be hypothesized that increased synthesis of EETs in portal vessels and/or sinusoids may participate in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension of cirrhosis.

Blood flow to the liver through the portal vein is regulated by mesenteric artery flow. Chu et al. [135] have shown that mesenteric arterial vessels are able to metabolize AA to HETEs and EETs. Furthermore, increased EETs production contributed to endothelium-dependent VSM cell hyperpolarization and blunted sensitivity to vasoconstrictor stimuli following prolonged hypoxic exposure [136]. EETs were also shown to function as EDRF in the mesenteric arterial vessels. As mesenteric vasodilation and increased portal inflow have an important role in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis, we evaluated the role of EETs in the vasodilatation of mesenteric circulation of experimental cirrhosis. In isolated perfused mesenteric circulation, inhibition of EET production with miconazole partially abolished the vasodilatation, causing a significant increase in perfusion pressure [137]. Miconazole also partially reversed the hyporeactivity to ET-1, but not to phenylephrine (PE) in cirrhotic animals (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that CYP-dependent AA metabolites are involved in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension, not only by increasing resistance in the porto-sinusoidal circulation, but also by increasing portal inflow.

The role of CYP-AA metabolites in cirrhosis has also been studied in relation to kidney dysfunction [138]. Renal failure represents one of the main complications of cirrhosis, a common cause of death in these patients. In experimental cirrhosis, we have shown alterations of renal microsomal metabolism of AA through the CYP-dependent pathway. In rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis and ascites, total synthesis of these metabolites was reduced, both in the cortex and in the outer medulla. In particular, there was reduced activity of epoxygenase, with reduced synthesis of EETs in the renal cortex. In another study in humans, we have evaluated the role of CYP-dependent HETEs in the pathophysiology of renal failure of cirrhosis [45]. Under this condition, activation of both COX and lipoxygenase pathways has been demonstrated [139,140]. In humans, as observed previously by Prakash et al. [141], 20-HETE was excreted conjugated to glucuronides. In cirrhotic patients, 20-HETE urinary excretion was significantly increased and the increase was related to the severity of cirrhosis and the decrease in renal blood flow. In patients with cirrhosis, urinary 20-HETE was several-fold higher than PGs and TxB2, whereas in normal subjects, 20-HETE and PGs were excreted at similar rates. In patients with more severe disease, 20-HETE was about two-fold higher than in those with compensated disease and an inverse relationship was present with renal plasma flow. Thus, 20-HETE is probably produced in increased amounts in the preglomerular microcirculation accounting for the functional decrease of flow and increase in sodium reabsorption. This opens the question of where the 20-HETE glucuronide is formed and whether the glucuronide of 20-HETE is biologically active.

In conclusion, CYP-AA metabolites represent a group of compounds that participate in the regulation of liver metabolic activity and hemodynamics. They appear to be deeply
