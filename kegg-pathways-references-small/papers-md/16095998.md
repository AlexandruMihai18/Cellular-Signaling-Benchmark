Glioma, and in particular high-grade astrocytoma termed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common primary tumor of the brain. Primarily because of its diffuse nature, there is no effective treatment for GBM, and relatively little is known about the processes by which it develops. Therefore, in order to design novel therapies and treatments for GBM, research has recently intensified to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to GBM formation. Modeling of astrocytomas by genetic manipulation of mice suggests that deregulation of the pathways that control gliogenesis during normal brain development, such as the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into astrocytes, might contribute to GBM formation. These pathways include growth factor-induced signal transduction routes and processes that control cell cycle progression, such as the p16-CDK4-RB and the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathways. The expression of several of the components of these signaling cascades has been found altered in GBM, and recent data indicate that combinations of mutations in these pathways may contribute to GBM formation, although the exact mechanisms are still to be uncovered. Use of novel techniques including large-scale genomics and proteomics in combination with relevant mouse models will most likely provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma formation and will hopefully lead to development of treatment modalities for GBM. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

I. CLASSIFICATION OF GLIOMAS

Gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors of the brain. They arise from astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or their precursors and can be classified histologically as astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, or tumors with morphological features of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, termed oligoastrocytomas. According to the degree of malignancy, gliomas are subsequently divided into four clinical grades, with grades I and II presenting in patients as “benign” tumors and grades III and IV displaying more malignant phenotypes (Konopka and Bonni, 2003; Maher et al., 2001).

- Gliomas of astrocytic origin (astrocytomas) are divided into pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I), astrocytoma (grade II), anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III), and glioblastoma (grade IV), while oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas are classified only as grade II and III (Table I). Pilocytic astrocytomas are slow-growing, non-infiltrative tumors occurring in children and young adults that might represent a separate disease from the gliomas of other grades. These tumors are usually curable by surgery, and thus most patients with grade I astrocytomas have good prognosis and survival rates. Grade II astrocytomas are low-grade malignancies that diffusely infiltrate the brain and therefore are not curable by surgery. Within 5–10 years of diagnosis, most grade II gliomas progress to higher grade tumors. Grade III astrocytomas (anaplastic astrocytomas) and grade IV, also called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), represent the malignant forms of gliomas and account for 30% of primary brain tumors in adults. Patients with grade IV gliomas have a mean survival of about 1 year, whereas patients with anaplastic gliomas survive for 2–3 years and those with

**Table I Classification of Human Glioma According to the WHO**

| Grade | Prognosis |
|-------|------------|
| **Astrocytoma** |  |
| Grade I (pilocytic astrocytoma) | curable by surgery |
| Grade II (astrocytoma) | 10–15 years survival |
| Grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma) | 2–3 years survival |
| Grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme) | ~1 year survival |
| **Oligodendroglioma** |  |
| Grade II (oligodendroglioma) | 10–15 years survival |
| Grade III (anaplastic oligodendroglioma) | 5–10 years survival |
| **Mixed gliomas** |  |
| Grade II (mixed oligoastrocytoma) | 10–15 years survival |
| Grade III (anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) | 3–5 years survival |
grade II gliomas can survive for as long as 10–15 years (Kleihues and Cavenee, 2000; Kleihues et al., 2002).

As mentioned above, low-grade gliomas often progress to higher grade tumors, such as GBM. However, GBMs not only develop from lower grade gliomas, but also are thought to arise *de novo*. Both forms of GBM (called secondary and primary GBM, respectively) arise through the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations (Sonoda et al., 2001). Although the precise relationships between the genetic lesions and cellular responses are still not understood, it seems clear that two main cellular processes are affected in the majority of brain tumors: cell cycle control pathways and signal transduction routes downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors.

## II. CELL CYCLE CONTROL

### A. The p16-CDK4-RB Pathway

The cell cycle is the process that leads to duplication of a cell and consists of four phases: the S phase, in which DNA replication occurs, M phase or mitosis, when the DNA is segregated and the cell actually divides, and two gap phases, G1 (before DNA synthesis) and G2 (before mitosis). Progression through the cell cycle is regulated by a family of protein kinases, termed cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are serine/threonine kinases that control the transition between successive phases of the cell cycle and that require binding of regulatory subunits, named cyclins, as an initial step in their activation process (reviewed by Bird, 2003; Murray, 2004). In mammalian cells, cyclins can form catalytically active complexes with different types of CDKs and different cyclin/CDK complexes are assembled and activated at specific points of the cell cycle (Fig. 1). To guarantee that the processes of DNA replication and cell division take place only at the appropriate moment and to ensure that cell cycle progression is stopped in response to irregularities such as DNA damage or faulty spindle assembly, the activity of the different cyclin/CDK complexes is further regulated by multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events and by binding to so-called cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). CKIs inhibit the activity of CDKs by associating with the CDK subunit, the cyclin or the cyclin/CDK complex. In mammalian cells, two families of CKIs have been described, based on protein similarity: the CIP/KIP family, composed of p21<sup>CIP1</sup>, p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, and p57<sup>KIP2</sup> and the INK4 family (inhibitors of CDK4), including p15<sup>INK4B</sup>, p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, p18<sup>INK4C</sup>, and p19<sup>INK4D</sup>. The CIP/KIP family of CKIs inhibits CDKs 2, 4, and 6, whereas members of the INK4-family bind exclusively to CDK4 and CDK6, thus preventing them from binding to

The transition between the different phases is regulated by cyclin/CDK activity. In the absence of growth factors, cells will stop dividing and enter the quiescent state (G0).

cyclins or blocking the kinase activity of pre-assembled complexes (Sherr and Roberts, 1999; Tyner and Gartel, 2003).

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) is one of the most important substrates regulated by cyclin/CDK activity in mammalian cells. pRB is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and binds in the hypophosphorylated state to transcription factors, particularly members of the E2F family (reviewed by Cam and Dynlacht, 2003; Stevaux and Dyson, 2002). E2F transcription factors regulate various cellular processes, such as apoptosis and differentiation, but are mainly known for their role in the regulation of G1/S transition. Many E2F-regulated gene products, such as CDC6, cyclin E, DNA polymerase α, and MCM (mini chromosome maintenance), control DNA synthesis, but as long as the various E2Fs are in complex with one of the pRB family members during early G1, their expression is repressed by the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other chromatin remodeling factors. During mid- to late-G1, however, pRB becomes phosphorylated on several residues by cyclin D/CDK complexes (containing CDK4 or CDK6), causing the dissociation of pRB from the HDACs and E2Fs, thus inducing E2F-dependent gene expression and

Fig. 2 Effect of CDK-inhibitors (CKIs) on the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) during the G1/S transition. The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) binds in its hypo-phosphorylated form to E2F/DP transcription factor complexes, leading to repression of gene expression by the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other chromatin remodeling factors. Phosphorylation of pRB by cyclin/CDK complexes in late G1 phase results in the release of the transcription complex from pRB and consequently in the activation of the E2F complex and entrance into S phase. CDK inhibitors of the INK4 and CIP/KIP family regulate this process through inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 or CDK2-containing complexes, respectively.

progression into S phase (Ferreira et al., 2001; Harbour and Dean, 2000; Takaki et al., 2004) (Fig. 2).

GBMs often contain alterations in one of the genes that regulate the pRB/E2F pathway. Mutations in RB1 (located on 13q14) are observed in 30% of high-grade tumors, while amplification of CDK4 (on chromosome 12q13-14) is found in nearly 15% of GBM (Burns et al., 1998; He et al., 1994a; Henson et al., 1994; Ichimura et al., 1996; Tsuzuki et al., 1996; Ueki et al., 1996; Venter et al., 1991). More frequently, however, are mutations in the gene encoding for the CKI p16INK4A. In addition to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) that will be discussed in further detail below, alterations in expression of the p16INK4A protein have been described (Nishikawa et al., 1995), caused either by a decrease in mRNA or protein stability or by a decreased transcription of the p16INK4A gene due to methylation of CpG islands (Costello et al., 1996; Fueyo et al., 1996; Nakamura et al., 2001).

B. The ARF-MDM2-p53 Pathway

A second pathway that controls cell cycle progression is the route that activates the p53 tumor suppressor protein. p53 is a transcription factor that is induced in response to DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogene activation and can either induce cell cycle arrest or promote programmed cell death (apoptosis) (reviewed by Fridman and Lowe, 2003; Oren, 2000; Vousden and Lu, 2002). Although the biological outcome of p53 activation (apoptosis versus cell cycle arrest) might depend on the cellular context or the availability of “survival signals,” it has been suggested that low levels of p53 cause cell cycle arrest (primarily through an upregulation of p21<sup>CIP1</sup>), whereas high levels of p53 would result in the expression of apoptosis-promoting genes (Zhao et al., 2000). One of the main regulators of p53 levels—and thus of the biological response—is Mdm2 (murine double mutant 2), an E3 ligase that binds to p53, thus blocking its transcriptional activity and targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Transcription of Mdm2, in turn, is regulated by p53 and, in addition, Mdm2 is inactivated by the binding to p19<sup>Arf</sup> (p14<sup>ARF</sup> in humans)—consequently blocking the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (Fig. 3).

The p53 pathway is inactivated in about 30% of gliomas, by mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor (*TP53*) gene, by amplification of *MDM2*, or by loss of expression of ARF. The most common event causing p53 inactivation in all glioma grades, excluding pilocytic astrocytomas (grade I), is LOH of *TP53* (located on chromosome 17p). LOH usually coincides with missense mutations in the remaining copy of *TP53* in exons 5, 7, or 8, leading to DNA binding deficient mutants of p53 (Louis, 1994). Amplification and overexpression of *MDM2* occurs in 8–10% of high-grade astrocytomas (He et al., 1994b; Reifenberger et al., 1993). Like CDK4, *MDM2* is located on

Fig. 3 The p19<sup>ARF</sup>-MDM2-p53 pathway. The transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is counteracted by binding of the E3 ligase MDM2, which also targets p53 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Binding of MDM2 to p19ARF releases p53 and activates p53-dependent transcription.

chromosome 12q13-14, and MDM2 and CDK4 are often co-amplified (Reifenberger *et al.*, 1994), thus affecting both the pRB and the p53 pathways. In fact, recent results showed that overexpression of CDK4 in astrocytes in itself is not sufficient for the formation of brain tumors and that an additional mutation in the p53 pathway is required for increased astrocyte proliferation (Huang *et al.*, 2002). Amplification of 12p13-14 is not the only mutation leading to a modification of both the pRB and the p53 cell cycle control pathways: the p19<sup>ARF</sup> protein is encoded by an alternative reading frame (ARF) of the INK4A locus that encodes for the CKI p16<sup>INK4A</sup> (Quelle *et al.*, 1995). Thus, mutations in this gene locus (called CDKN2A, located on chromosome 9p) also affect both the regulation of the pRB pathway and the stability of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. CDKN2A mutations are frequently detected in sporadic gliomas, occurring in 50–70% of high-grade tumors, usually via homozygous gene deletion (Izumoto *et al.*, 1995; Labuhn *et al.*, 2001; Moulton *et al.*, 1995; Ueki *et al.*, 1996).

Although the loss of the CDKN2A locus is a common event in glioblastoma, deletion of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and p19<sup>ARF</sup> in itself does not seem to cause glioma formation. Germline mutations in the INK4A gene have been shown to predispose to pancreatic adenocarcinoma and melanoma but do not promote gliomagenesis (Hall and Peters, 1996), suggesting that additional mutations are needed for the formation of brain tumors. Another class of proteins that is frequently deregulated in gliomas and that is most likely involved in glioma formation includes the components of signal transduction pathways.

## III. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION

### A. Growth Factor Receptors

In addition to internal signal transduction routes that control cell cycle progression, cell division is also regulated by signals from outside the cell. The transmission of extracellular signals to intracellular targets, like the cell cycle machinery, is mediated by specific signal transduction pathways, which involve protein–protein interactions and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins. Several extracellular signaling molecules, or ligands, are known, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors that can bind to receptors at the cell surface. In order to respond specifically to certain situations, different cell types produce different signaling molecules and contain distinct combinations of receptors, for example, Notch receptors to monitor cell–cell interactions and TGFβ receptors that respond to cytokine signaling or growth factor receptors.

Growth factors bind and activate either receptors with an intrinsic protein kinase activity, most often receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), or receptors that transmit signals to the cytoplasm by interacting with GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). RTK type growth factor receptors are characterized by an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane region, and a large intracellular catalytic domain and dimerize upon binding of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) (reviewed by Heldin, 1996). This dimerization leads to activation and autophosphorylation of the receptors on tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, which triggers the recruitment of a number of target proteins to the receptors, for example, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), the p85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) or growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2). In some instances, receptor binding results in the tyrosine phosphorylation and a direct change in the activity of the target molecule (e.g., PLCγ) (Anderson et al., 1990; Margolis et al., 1990). In other cases, however, proteins without any enzymatic activity are bound, such as Grb2 and p85 (Buday and Downward, 1993; Gale et al., 1993; Hu et al., 1992; Rozakis-Adcock et al., 1993). These proteins serve as adaptor proteins to couple the activated receptor to other intermediates. All protein interactions consequently lead to modification (e.g., phosphorylation or dephosphorylation) and activation of other target proteins, thus creating a signal transduction cascade that finally results in activation of nuclear transcription factors and induction of gene expression. For example, binding of Grb2 can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway through recruitment of Sos and subsequent activation of Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK, while binding of p85 activates the PI3-kinase (PI3K) cascade, leading to phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB, also named Akt) (Fig. 4).

Although the components of the different signaling pathways downstream of growth factor receptors have been identified, the exact ways in which these pathways control cell fate and proliferation in glial development is still unknown. Yet, it is clear that signaling through EGF, FGF-2, and PDGF plays an important role in the regulation of gliogenesis during normal brain development (Maher et al., 2001; Richardson et al., 1988; Santa-Olalla and Covarrubias, 1999). Peak expression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) coincides with the development of glia (Burrows et al., 1997), and EGF and FGF-2 signaling is required for sustained proliferation, survival, and motility of NSCs (Boockvar et al., 2003; Caric et al., 2001; Doetsch et al., 2002; Tropepe et al., 1999). The PDGF receptor (PDGFR) is expressed at high levels in glial progenitors (Ellison and de Vellis, 1995), and PDGF induces proliferation of glial progenitor cells. In addition, PDGF inhibits, in cooperation with FGF-2, the differentiation of oligodendroglial

This phosphorylation subsequently triggers the recruitment of a number of target proteins to the receptor, thus inducing downstream signaling cascades such as the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.

progenitor cells into mature oligodendrocytes *in vitro* and stimulates oligodendrocytic progenitor cell migration (McKinnon et al., 1990; Simpson and Armstrong, 1999).

Overexpression of the different growth factors and their respective growth factor receptors and activation of the downstream signaling pathways have been detected in a great number of GBMs (DiRocco et al., 1998; Finn et al., 1997; Fleming et al., 1992; Lokker et al., 2002; Ueba et al., 1994; van der Valk et al., 1997). For example, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5′ UTR of the EGF gene has recently been identified that correlates with high levels of EGF expression (Bhowmick et al., 2004), and between 30 and 50% of glioblastomas show amplification of the EGF receptor gene (located on chromosome 7p12). In addition, a constitutively active mutant EGFR (called EGFRvIII, ΔEGFR, or del2-7EGFR) is expressed in a large number of GBMs that promotes constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways (Li et al., 2004; Lorimer and Lavictoire, 2001) and is thought to induce glial transformation through both increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis (Nagane et al., 1996; Sugawa et al., 1998). Although overexpression of this constitutive active
EGF receptor in itself was found not to confer any growth advantage in tissue culture (Nishikawa *et al.*, 1994), *in vivo* experiments demonstrated that ΔEGFR could cause an increase in cell proliferation and cell motility (Lal *et al.*, 2002; Pedersen *et al.*, 2004). Moreover, the combination of EGFR activation and loss of both p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and p19<sup>ARF</sup> (but not of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> or p19<sup>ARF</sup> alone) was found to dedifferentiate astrocytes *in vitro* and to induce high-grade glioma formation *in vivo* (Bachoo *et al.*, 2002; Holland *et al.*, 1998). Likewise, overexpression of PDGF in cells that also expressed the PDGFR was found to dedifferentiate astrocytes and to induce oligodendroglioma formation in mice. In this case, loss of Ink4a/Arf was not required for tumor formation but appeared to promote the progression toward a more malignant phenotype (Dai *et al.*, 2001).

### B. TGFβ Signaling

Overexpression of PDGF and the PDGFR in hyperdiploid GBMs has been suggested to be due to misregulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway (Jennings *et al.*, 1991; Mapstone, 1991; Yamada *et al.*, 1995). TGFβ belongs to a superfamily of cytokines that includes activins, inhibins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that control different cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed by Massagué, 2000). In non-transformed cells, such as primary astrocytes, TGFβ is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, presumably working through repression of *c-MYC* expression (Malliri *et al.*, 1996) and upregulation of the CKIs p15<sup>INK4B</sup>, p21<sup>CIP1</sup>, and p27<sup>KIP1</sup> (Reynisdottir *et al.*, 1995; Robson *et al.*, 1999), while in high-grade GBM, TGFβ has been found to stimulate cell proliferation (Jennings and Pietenpol, 1998). Like RTK-induced signal transduction, TGFβ signaling is triggered by the binding of a ligand, allowing receptor dimerization and phosphorylation. As opposed to growth factor-induced signal transduction, however, two different types of receptor serine/threonine kinases are brought together whereby receptor II phosphorylates the receptor I kinase domain, allowing the binding of Smad proteins. There are three classes of Smad proteins: the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), the co-mediator Smads (Co-Smads), and the inhibitory Smad proteins (I-Smads). Only the R-Smads are directly phosphorylated and activated by the type I receptor kinase. R-Smads subsequently form a heteromeric complex with the Co-Smad (Smad 4) and translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of target genes in complex with different DNA-binding partners (Fig. 5).

So far, the best-known target genes regulated by TGFβ signaling are *c-MYC*, *p15<sup>INK4B</sup>*, and *p21<sup>CIP1</sup>* (Feng *et al.*, 2000; Frederick *et al.*, 2004;
Molecular Mechanisms in Gliomagenesis

Fig. 5 Signaling through TGFβ receptors. Upon binding of a ligand, TGFβ receptor I and receptor II dimerize, leading to activation and phosphorylation of receptor I. This phosphorylation triggers the recruitment of R-Smads, which subsequently form a heteromeric complex with Co-Smads. Thereupon, this newly formed Smad complex translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates gene transcription/repression.

Pardali *et al.*, 2000; Seoane *et al.*, 2001; Yagi *et al.*, 2002). Selective loss of growth inhibition by TGFβ in gliomas may, in part, be explained by DNA methylation or deletions of the $p15^{INK4B}$ gene (Herman *et al.*, 1996; Rich *et al.*, 1999). However, the upregulation of PDGF and PDGFR, as mentioned above, or a lack of $p21^{CIP1}$ induction, might also lead to the formation of a more aggressive phenotype (Jennings and Pietenpol, 1998). It has been shown recently that TGFβ-induced transcription of $p21^{CIP1}$ depends on the downstream effectors Smad 3 and Smad 4, which form a complex with the Forkhead transcription factor FoxO (Seoane *et al.*, 2004). Formation of FoxO–Smad complexes can be inhibited by activation of the PI3K signaling pathway downstream of PDGF signaling or by the presence of another Forkhead family member, FoxG1 (formerly Brain Factor-1, BF-1) that protects neuroepithelial progenitor cells from differentiation during the forebrain formation (Hanashima *et al.*, 2002, 2004; Xuan *et al.*,

1995). FoxG1 is highly expressed in high-grade GBM, and it has been suggested that the combined actions of FoxG1 and PI3K mediate the resistance of human glioblastoma cells to TGF$\beta$-induced transcription of $p21^{CIP1}$ (Seoane *et al.*, 2004).

## C. The PI3-Kinase Pathway/PTEN

As mentioned above, the PI3-kinase pathway, which is downstream of activated growth factor receptors, might interfere with TGF$\beta$-induced gene expression and the control of cell cycle progression. However, its most important role in the formation of glioma appears to lie in the suppression of cell death through activation of PKB/Akt. Upon activation of growth factor receptors such as PDGFR, FGFR, or EGFR, PI3K is activated and recruited to the plasma membrane, where it can subsequently phosphorylate inositol phospholipids, leading to the production of three different lipid products: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (Cantrell, 2001; Kapeller and Cantley, 1994). Although PI3-kinase is thought to interact directly with some cellular signaling proteins (Carpenter *et al.*, 1990, 1993; Dhand *et al.*, 1994), it is the generation of those phosphoinositide products of PI3K that seems to be important for cell signaling. Phosphoinositides can interact with proteins containing lipid-binding protein domains, such as PKB/Akt, which promotes cell survival and suppresses apoptosis by phosphorylating a number of substrates involved in death regulation (Datta *et al.*, 1999). Among the PKB/Akt targets are the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bad (Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-antagonist, causing cell death), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and proteases of the caspase family, but also Mdm2, leading to inactivation of p53 (Ashcroft *et al.*, 2002; Cross *et al.*, 1995; Kandel and Hay, 1999; Mayo and Donner, 2001). Furthermore, PKB/Akt phosphorylates several members of the Forkhead family of transcription factors, such as FoxO, mentioned above (Biggs *et al.*, 1999; Brunet *et al.*, 1999; Kops *et al.*, 1999; Rena *et al.*, 1999), causing the export of the Forkhead transcription factors from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thus downregulating gene expression. In addition to the regulation of $p21^{CIP1}$ mentioned earlier, the expression of the CKI $p27^{KIP1}$ is also supposed to be regulated in this way (Medema *et al.*, 2000).

The PI3K pathway is upregulated in gliomas through several mechanisms. The most common mechanisms involve amplification/overexpression of critical growth factors and their receptors and mutation or loss of heterozygosity of PTEN. The tumor suppressor PTEN (for phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10) is a phosphatase that

dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and thus counteracts PKB activation (reviewed by Besson *et al.*, 1999; Mayo and Donner, 2002). In addition, PTEN (also called MMAC/TEP1) modulates (neuronal and glial) cell migration by direct dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Tamura *et al.*, 1998, 1999), a function that seems to be essential for the organization of the brain during development (Li *et al.*, 2003; Marino *et al.*, 2002). Loss of all, or part, of chromosome 10q, where PTEN and other tumor suppressor genes such as MXI1 (Max interacting protein1) or DMBT1 (deleted in malignant brain tumors) are situated, occurs in approximately 75–90% of gliomas, mostly high-grade GBM (Fults and Pedone, 1993; Lang *et al.*, 1994). In about 60% of those glioblastomas, mutations in the PTEN gene are observed (Wang *et al.*, 1997). Although overexpression of wild-type PTEN in glioma cells can cause growth suppression, both *in vitro* and *in vivo* (Furnari *et al.*, 1997), lack of PTEN does not seem to be sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation of neuronal or glial cells (Marino *et al.*, 2002). Thus, it has been suggested that lack of PTEN is a late event that accelerates astrocytoma development and plays a role in the conversion of low-grade astrocytomas to GBM (Sonoda *et al.*, 2001; Xiao *et al.*, 2002).

## IV. MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF GBM FORMATION

### A. Downstream Signaling Pathways

Given the aggressive clinical behavior of human gliomas and the lack of good markers for various glioma grades, most research regarding these brain tumors has focused on the analysis of gene expression and the characterization of chromosomal alterations. However, these studies are only an indication of which signaling pathways are altered in gliomas and give little insight into the actual molecular mechanisms that control the cellular processes that lead to GBM formation. Since it will be essential for the development of novel therapies and treatments of glioblastoma to understand exactly which molecular mechanisms lead to glioma formation, an increasing amount of research has focused on identifying the “cell of origin” for GBM and on determining the role of downstream molecular targets. For example, overexpression of growth factor receptors is detected in most malignant gliomas, but the actual effector proteins appear to be the downstream targets c-MYC or RAS. c-MYC is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays a role in many cellular processes such as proliferation, suppression of differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed by Dang, 1999) and is found to be upregulated in many different forms of cancer, including human glioblastoma (Engelhard *et al.*, 1989; Trent *et al.*, 1986). Recently,

ectopic expression of MYC was found to promote the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in culture (Fults *et al.*, 2002), and deregulation of the c-Myc pathway in developing astroglia in transgenic mice was shown to induce the formation of malignant gliomas, which highly resembled human GBM *in vivo*: expression of c-MYC under control of an astrocyte-specific promoter (the GFAP [glial fibrillary acidic protein] promoter) predisposed mice to malignant astrocytomas within 2–3 weeks of age (Jensen *et al.*, 2003). Likewise, expression of oncogenic V<sup>12</sup>Ha-RAS in a transgenic mouse model using the GFAP promoter induced the growth of malignant astrocytomas (Ding *et al.*, 2001), even though most astrocytomas lack primary oncogenic RAS mutations (Bos, 1989). Interestingly, these astrocytomas exhibited typical molecular alterations that have been described for human GBM, including a decreased or absent expression of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and p19<sup>ARF</sup>, as well as overexpression of EGFR, MDM2, and CDK4. Since overexpression of oncogenic RAS in itself is not transforming, the occurrence of those additional genomic alterations is thought to be essential for glioma formation. In fact, in primary cells, including neurons, oncogenic Ras alone has been described to cause senescence, correlating with an increased expression of p53 and p16<sup>Ink4A</sup> (Serrano *et al.*, 1997), while induced Ras signaling in combination with the deletion of the Ink4a/Arf locus has been found to induce GBM formation from both neural progenitor cells and astrocytes (Uhrbom *et al.*, 2002). Thus, high levels of activated Ras due to increased growth factor signaling might induce genomic instability and initiate the sequence of additional genetic events that lead to the development of astrocytomas in mice.

## B. “Cell of Origin”

It is now widely believed that most tumors, including glioblastoma, arise from multipotent stem cells, as these have the long lifespan that is required for the accumulation of the many genetic alterations that are found in most cancers (Owens and Watt, 2003; Recht *et al.*, 2003). However, alternative mechanisms involving committed cells that have begun the process of differentiation may exist (Perez-Losada and Balmain, 2002). As a third possibility, gliomas may arise through dedifferentiation of mature astrocytes or oligodendrocytes (Holland, 2001a). All three hypotheses could explain the observation that human glioblastoma contain NSC-like cells that express markers specific for primitive undifferentiated cells and that are capable of forming neurosphere clones *in vitro* (Ignatova *et al.*, 2002; Kondo *et al.*, 2004; Singh *et al.*, 2003). However, only the last two would explain the presence of cells that resemble immature astrocytes, immature oligodendrocytes, or mixtures of the two cell types. Mutations in astrocytic

precursors could lead to the formation of astrocytomas, while oligodendrocytomas would arise from oligodendrocytic precursors and mixed gliomas from progenitors of both cell types (Holland, 2001a,b). Alternatively, terminally differentiated astrocytes and oligodendrocytes could dedifferentiate into NSC-like cells through oncogenic alterations that induce glioma formation, thus giving rise to astrocytomas and oligodendrocytomas, respectively (Bachoo et al., 2002; Dai et al., 2001; Holland et al., 2000a).

It has been suggested that the two forms of GBM that are distinguished on the basis of clinical history, primary and secondary GBM, may in fact represent two different diseases that arise from different initial target cells, are induced through different genetic pathways, and should be treated in different ways. In this hypothesis, primary GBM should originate from primitive glial precursor cells, whereas secondary glioblastomas arise from the dedifferentiation of low-grade gliomas (Maher et al., 2001). Although neural stem cell activity decreases with age (Temple, 2000), this hypothesis would fit with the observation that primary GBM is usually reported in older patients (generally without any evidence of prior clinical disease): if one considers that there are only relatively few progenitor cells present in the brain, the chance that a precursor cell is hit is low (and thus likely to occur only at a later age), but once mutated it might be more destructive. Moreover, mutated progenitor cells might give rise to phenotypically normal astrocytes that all harbor the same genetic lesion that upon a second mutation might form a glioblastoma. For example, a mutation in the CDKN2A gene would initially lead to immortalized astrocytes with an infinite lifespan, which will not necessarily form a tumor. Upon activation of the EGFR, however, these cells will be induced to dedifferentiate, thus triggering glioma formation (Bachoo et al., 2002).

As opposed to primary glioblastoma, secondary GBM is generally observed in younger patients who initially display a low-grade astrocytoma that transforms into GBM within 5–10 years of the initial diagnosis, correlating with an increase in gene and chromosomal deletions and amplifications (Holland, 2001a). Although both primary and secondary forms of GBM are very similar in clinical and histological features, the kind of mutations in these tumors is quite different, and the different molecular signature of the two groups of GBM might reflect the way in which the tumors develop. Primary glioblastomas often overexpress the EGFR and show deletions in the CDKN2A gene. In addition, amplification of MDM2 (and CDK4) or mutations in the RB1 locus are observed, while almost no p53 deletions are present (Benjamin et al., 2003; Biernat et al., 1997). Secondary GBM, on the other hand, often have deletions in the TP53 gene but do not overexpress the EGFR. Instead, high expression of the PDGFR is observed, even though these two events do not seem to be causally linked, since overexpression of PDGFR in p53-/- mice does

not increase the incidence of PDGF-induced gliomas when compared to wild-type mice (Dai et al., 2001) (Fig. 6). It is notable, however, that the mutations that characterize primary GBM, including the upregulation of EGFR and MDM2, have been described in malignant gliomas that develop upon expression of MYC in GFAP-expressing cells (suggesting that c-MYC might be involved in dedifferentiation of astrocytes) (Jensen et al., 2003), while the overexpression of other genes seems to be more effective in the formation of gliomas when expressed in progenitor cells (Holland et al., 1998; Uhrbom et al., 2002).

### V. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

During the last 10 years much progress has been made in the characterization of glioblastoma and the genetic pathways that underlie glioma formation. As described above, a number of genes have been identified that are frequently mutated in GBM and that can be used to distinguish primary from
secondary GBM, but a good prognostic marker to predict patient survival or to design patient-tailored treatment is still missing ([Puduvalli et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/2.4.287); [Strege et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/nwh065); [Zagzag et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/5.4.315)). In this respect, the use of genomics appears to be a powerful and promising tool: gene expression profiling has been used for other types of cancer to discover previously unrecognized tumor subtypes or to predict responses to therapy ([Alizadeh et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/35019014); [Chen et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng883); [Golub et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1038/13395); [Perou et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/35056001); [Sorlie et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/35056004); [van't Veer et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/35056056)). Various screens using DNA microarray technology have already been performed on different forms of glioma and have been shown to be efficient in separating low-grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM from each other and from normal brain tissue and to distinguish primary GBM from secondary GBM ([Markert et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/3.4.321); [Mischel et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/5.4.326); [Nutt et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/5.4.333); [Rickman et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/3.4.331); [Sallinen et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/2.4.295); [Shai et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/5.4.340)). More importantly, gene expression profiling has identified a number of novel candidate genes that are associated with GBM formation ([van den Boom et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/5.4.346)). However, it remains to be shown if these genes are causally related to the transformation of glial cells and whether alterations in the signaling pathways in which they are involved are sufficient to induce tumor formation. The use of accurate mouse models will be important to resolve these questions and may provide a way to understand disease development and to test preclinical models for therapeutic drug screening.

So far, the use of “classical” knockout mice has indicated that gliomas, as opposed to other kinds of tumors, are rarely initiated by mutations in pathways controlling cell cycle progression. Mice deficient for p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> or p53 develop lymphomas and sarcomas but no brain tumors, and mice with a specific loss of p19<sup>Arf</sup> expression develop only sporadically low-grade, but not high-grade, gliomas ([Donehower et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1038/356215a0); [Kamijo et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1038/10889); [Serrano et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1038/380841a0)). However, the combined use of gene disruption and overexpression in mice has shown that mouse models can be used to efficiently reproduce clinical symptoms of human GBM *in vivo*. A promising system to study the effect of gene expression in mice is the RCAS (replication competent ALV splice acceptor) system, which allows the efficient transduction of combinations of genes either to primary cells or *in vivo* ([Uhrbom and Holland, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/3.4.351)). Putative oncogenes can be delivered to specified cell types in the CNS of tv-a transgenic mice using RCAS viral vectors, whereby only cells expressing tv-a, the receptor for ALV-A, will be infected. Using the RCAS system, Holland and co-workers have shown that overexpression of polyoma virus middle T antigen (MTA) or PDGF is sufficient to induce the formation of oligodendrogliomas or mixed astrocytomas *in vivo* and that induced Ras signaling in combination with the deletion of the *Ink4a/Arf* locus induces GBM formation from both neural progenitor cells and astrocytes ([Holland et al., 2000b](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/2.4.303); [Uhrbom et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/4.4.361)) ([Table II](#table-ii)). Thus, the use of postnatal gene transfer is a powerful way to test

the importance of certain signaling pathways in glioma formation. The availability of relevant mouse models in combination with large-scale genomic and proteomic technologies and other new techniques, such as the use of tissue microarrays (TMAs) or the ability to grow neural stem cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in culture, can provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma formation.
