L-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was measured in mammalian tissues with long-chain ($C_{16}$) and short-chain ($C_4$) 3-ketoacyl-CoA substrates. The majority of the activity was mitochondrial. Activity with $C_{16}$ substrate was enriched in the inner membrane fraction while the matrix showed enrichment of activity with $C_4$ substrate. Gel-filtration in the presence of nonionic and ionic detergents separated two peaks of activity with $C_{16}$ substrate from liver, heart, kidney and brown adipose tissue mitochondria. The highest molecular weight activity was associated with membrane fragments and accounted for 18–32% of the total activity with $C_{16}$ substrate. This enzyme showed preference for long-chain substrate, the $C_{16}/C_4$ activity ratio being 6–15 for the different mitochondria studied. The other enzyme had a molecular weight of 71000 and showed highest activity with $C_4$ substrate ($C_{16}/C_4$ activity ratio of 0.2). The substrate specificity of the membrane-associated enzyme was not altered by extraction with detergent or lipid solvents. The membrane-associated enzyme could be partially purified by treatment with high concentrations of KCl and EDTA, when it showed a molecular weight of 186000 while retaining its high $C_{16}/C_4$ activity ratio. Protease treatment caused loss of $C_4$ activity from the high-molecular-weight enzyme without affecting its $C_{16}$ activity. We conclude that an inner membrane-associated, long-chain-specific 3-ketoacyl-CoA dehydrogenase coexists in mitochondria with the better-documented matrix enzyme which shows preference for shorter-chain-length substrates.

Introduction  

L-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35), a component enzyme of the β-oxidation pathway, catalyses the reversible dehydrogenation of L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA. The mitochondrial enzyme has been isolated from several tissues, and the pig heart [1,2] and rat liver [3] enzymes have been extensively studied. Recently, following the discovery by Lazarow and De Duve [4] that β-oxidation capacity exists in peroxisomes of rat liver, Osumi and Hashimoto [5] reported the presence of a peroxisomal L-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (designated type II) which also has enoyl-CoA hydratase activity [6]. The type II enzyme differed in many properties from the type I (mitochondrial) dehydrogenase, but both show a broad acyl-chain length specificity, giving similar velocities with 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA substrates of chain lengths from $C_4$ to $C_{10}$.  

In this work we investigated the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity of tissue extracts towards short- ($C_4$) and long-chain ($C_{16}$) 3-ketoacyl-CoA substrates in order to establish whether this

component step of β-oxidation is catalysed by a group of enzymes of differing substrate specificity, as described for other steps of the pathway [7–9]. A preliminary report of this study has appeared [10].

**Materials and Methods**

**Animals.** Rats were 180–220 g male Wistars fed a normal diet ad libitum. Rabbits were 1–2-days-old New Zealand White.

**Chemicals.** NADH, CoA, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35, from pig heart), fatty acid-poor bovine serum albumin, subtilisin (EC 3.4.21.14), deoxycholic acid, diketene and thioglycollic acid were from Sigma (London) Chemical Co., Poole, Dorset, U.K. Glycerol AR and poly(ethylene glycol) 6000 were from Fisons Ltd., Loughborough, U.K. Ultrogel AcA34 was purchased from LKB-Produkter AB, Sweden. Triton X-100 (purified) was from Koch-Light Laboratories Ltd., Colnbrook, Bucks., U.K. Emepigen BB was a gift from Albright and Wilson Ltd., Whitehaven, U.K.

**Preparation and purity of 3-ketoacyl-CoA derivatives**

Acetoacetyl-CoA was prepared by treating CoA at pH 8.5 with redistilled diketene [11]. The thioglycolic esters of 3-ketohexanoic, 3-ketodecanoic and 3-ketohexadecanoic acids were prepared by the method of Vagelos and Alberts [12] from the ethyl- or methyl-esters of the keto acids. The latter were prepared by the method of Stahlberg-Stenhagen [13]. The CoA esters of these compounds were prepared by thiol-exchange with CoA at pH 8.5 in a medium composed of 2-methylpropan-2-ol and water as described in Ref. 14. 3-Ketodecanoyl-CoA and 3-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA were separated from residual free CoA as previously described [9]. The 3-ketoacyl-CoA content of the preparations was measured by following NADH oxidation in the presence of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase at pH 7.0 [15]. In the case of 3-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA, care was taken not to exceed a concentration of 80 μM since irreversible inhibition of the enzyme occurred above this value. The total acyl-CoA content was determined from the absorption of the adenine moiety at 259 nm in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 16.4 [16]. The free CoA (thiol) contents of the products were determined by the method of Ellman [17]. The content of total 3-ketoacyl-thioester was determined by measuring the thiol release (as above) after the addition of neutral hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 50 mM. Under these conditions the hydroxylamine will cause rapid thiol release from 3-ketoacyl-thioesters but not from other acyl-thioesters (Middleton, unpublished data). Typical purity of the products were: free thiol maximum at 3% of total acyl-CoA; 3-ketoacyl-CoA, 99–100% of total acyl-CoA; 3-ketoacyl-thioester, 100–110% of total acyl-CoA.

**Preparation of tissue extracts**

Tissues were removed immediately after death of the animal, dissected free of connective tissue etc., rinsed with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (at 4°C) to remove blood, blotted and frozen at –20°C. After partial thawing, tissues were chopped and blended in an overhead-drive blender with 5 vol. of cold 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Sometimes tissues were frozen-thawed twice before blending. The homogenate was brought to 1% (w/v) with Triton X-100 and used directly for enzyme assay.

**Preparation of mitochondrial fractions**

Rat livers of kidneys were rapidly removed, chopped and rinsed with 0.25 M sucrose and homogenised with eight passes in 5 vol. of the same solution using a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogeniser with a radial clearance of 0.3 mm. The resulting homogenate was diluted with the same medium to 10% (w/v) and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 6500 × g for 7 min to yield a pellet fraction. The pellet was suspended in the sucrose medium and respun. The final pellet was taken up in a minimal volume of medium. All procedures were at 4°C. Rat hearts were processed in a similar manner except that the medium contained 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4. Homogenisation was carried out on the finely chopped material using a loose-fitting (0.4 mm) Potter-Elvehjem homogeniser. The homogenate was spun as before. Rat brains were homogenized in 10 vol. of 0.3 M sucrose in a Dounce

homogeniser. After a low-speed spin of \(1000 \times g\) for 10 min the crude mitochondrial fraction was sedimented at \(10000 \times g\) for 10 min. The method of Gray and Whittaker [18], using discontinuous sucrose density gradients, was employed to obtain a purified mitochondrial pellet. Brown adipose tissue was dissected from six newborn rabbits, finely chopped and homogenised (seven strokes) in \(0.29 \mathrm{M}\) sucrose with a Dounce homogeniser (0.3 mm gap). The homogenate was centrifuged at \(9500 \times g\) for 7 min. The infranatant was discarded and the excess fat wiped from the tube sides. The pellet was suspended in \(10 \mathrm{ml}\) of sucrose solution and filtered through muslin. Defatted albumin was added to give a final concentration of \(1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}\). This material was then spun as for liver mitochondria, but the final washing step was omitted. The mitochondrial pellet was taken up \(0.5 \mathrm{ml}\) of sucrose medium.

Unless otherwise stated, mitochondria were prepared from tissues removed from at least three animals and pooled before use.

**Mitochondrial subfractionation**

Freshly prepared rat liver mitochondria were subfractionated by the method of either Schnaitman and Greenawalt [19] or Sottocasa et al. [20] into a pellet fraction (inner membrane plus matrix; mitoplasts) light fraction (outer membrane) and soluble fraction (soluble material between the two membranes). The pellet fraction (mitoplast) was further fractionated as follows: the pellet was suspended in 9 vol. of \(20 \mathrm{mM}\) potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and frozen-thawed twice before being separated into soluble fraction (matrix) and particulate fraction (inner membrane) by centrifugation at \(100000 \times g\) for 1 h.

**Assay of enzymes and protein**

3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was measured at \(30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) by the change in absorbance at \(340 \mathrm{~nm}\) resulting from the oxidation of NADH in the presence of 3-ketoacyl-CoA. The standard assay contained in \(1 \mathrm{ml}, 0.1 \mathrm{mg}\) NADH and an appropriate volume of enzyme in \(0.1 \mathrm{M}\) potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The reaction was started by addition of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA substrate to a final concentration of \(40 \mu \mathrm{M}\). Any NADH oxidase was subtracted from the final rate. Preliminary experi-

ments showed that the inclusion of low concentrations of defatted serum albumin in the assay caused significant stimulation of enzyme activity when measured with long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA. This stimulation was maximal with \(0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}\) albumin when 3-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA was the substrate. Concentrations of albumin higher than \(0.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}\) exhibited an inhibitory effect (Fig. 1). The standard assay with 3-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA \(\left(C_{16}\right)\) always included defatted albumin to \(0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}\). Albumin did not affect the activity of the enzyme when acetoacetyl-CoA \(\left(C_{4}\right)\) was substrate.

Citrate synthase was assayed by the method of Srere et al. [21]. Citrate synthase or 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities in particulate fractions were determined after treating with \(1 \%\) (w/v) Triton X-100. Succinic dehydrogenase and rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome \(c\) reductase were assayed as described in Ref. 20. Protein was determined by the biuret method [22] or the microbiuret modification [23].

determined in rat liver, heart, kidney and brain and neonatal rabbit brown adipose tissue using acetoacetyl-CoA (C₄) and 3-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA (C₁₆) substrates (Table I). Activities with both substrates reflected the known β-oxidative abilities of the tissues and, while use of C₁₆ substrate always gave lower activity than C₄ substrate, there were significant differences between tissues in the ratios of the two activities.

A very similar pattern was seen when mitochondrial extracts were assayed with C₄ and C₁₆ substrates (Table II). The highest activity with either substrate was found in brown adipose tissue mitochondria. The very high content of

mitochondria in this tissue (more than 80% of tissue protein; Middleton, unpublished data) accounted for the similar specific activities in tissue homogenate and mitochondrial extract. The apparent substrate specificity remained the same in homogenates and mitochondria from all tissues examined, indicating a mitochondrial location for the activities. However, the $C_{16} / C_{4}$ activity ratio showed tissue-specific differences compatible with the existence of more than one 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in mitochondria.

**Mitochondrial inner membrane location of activity with long-chain substrate**

In preliminary experiments we found that $55 \pm 15\%$ of $C_{16}$ activity was associated with particulate material while $78 \pm 4\%$ of $C_{4}$ activity was soluble after rat liver mitochondria were crudely fractionated by freeze-thawing and spinning at $100,000 \times g$ for 60 min in phosphate buffer, pH

**TABLE III**

DISTRIBUTION OF LONG- AND SHORT-CHAIN 3-HYDROXYACYL-COA DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY BETWEEN MATRIX AND INNER MEMBRANE FRACTIONS OF MITOCHONDRIA

Rat liver mitochondrial mitoplasts (intact inner membrane plus matrix) were prepared by the procedure of Sottocasa et al. [20]. Mitoplasts were further fractionated by freeze-thawing and centrifugation at $100,000 \times g$ for 1 h into an inner membrane fraction (containing 98.5% of initial mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase activity, but less than 6% of citrate synthase activity) and a soluble matrix fraction (containing no detectable succinic dehydrogenase but 94% of the citrate synthase activity). 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity of these fractions was determined with $C_{4}$ and $C_{16}$ substrates.

| Mitochondrial fraction | Specific activity with different substrates ($\mu$mol/min per mg protein) | % Activity in unfractionated mitochondria |

|                        | $C_{4}$ | $C_{16}$ | $C_{4}$ | $C_{16}$ |

7.0. Freshly prepared rat liver mitochondria fractionated by digitonin [19] or sonication plus swelling [20] into outer membrane fragments, intermembrane soluble proteins and mitoplasts (intact inner membranes plus matrix) demonstrated that an average of 90% of mitochondrial $C_{4}$ activity and 94% of mitochondrial $C_{16}$ activity was located in the mitoplast. The latter contained 91 and 98% of matrix and inner membrane markers, respectively, and less than 20% of outer membrane marker. The mitoplasts were further fractionated (Table III) after breakage by freeze-thawing and centrifugation into inner-membrane fragments and matrix, which were identified by the markers succinic dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, respectively. The inner membrane fraction contained 53% of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity with $C_{16}$ substrate activity that was originally measured in mitoplasts, but now the $C_{16} / C_{4}$ activity ratio was increased 7-fold, from 0.42 in mitoplasts to 2.9. The matrix fraction contained 92% of the short-chain ($C_{4}$) activity originally measured in mitoplasts and showed a $C_{16} / C_{4}$ ratio reduced to 0.18. This divergent behaviour with short- and long-chain substrates provides clear evidence for the existence of at least two mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases.

**Separation of mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases by gel filtration**

More detailed information about the physical nature of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity of mitochondria was obtained by gel filtration. Preliminary experiments had shown that treatment of frozen-thawed rat liver mitochondria with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 (0.3 mg detergent/mg mitochondrial protein) apparently solubilised up to 90% of the mitochondrial activity with $C_{16}$ substrate. The criterion for solubilization was failure to sediment after 1 h of centrifugation at $100,000 \times g$. To test whether this activity with $C_{16}$ substrate was truly soluble, Triton X-100-treated mitochondria were chromatographed on Ultrogel AcA34 (exclusion limit, 350,000). Glycerol (20%, v/v) was included in the running buffer to reduce loss of enzyme activity. In its absence very variable recoveries were found, varying with the individual preparations of mitochondria. A typical

Fig. 2. Separation of mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities by gel filtration. Frozen-thawed rat liver mitochondria pretreated with Triton X-100 were chromatographed in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol (but no detergent) on a 1.6 × 60 cm column of Ultrogel AcA 34. Fractions (2.0 ml) were collected and assayed with C₁₆ and C₄ chain length 3-ketoacyl-CoA substrates. Activity with C₁₆ substrate, ●; C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio, ○.

result (Fig. 2) showed two peaks of activity measured with C₁₆ substrate. The higher molecular weight peak was excluded from the column, showed a preference for long-chain substrate (C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio rising to 1.0) and accounted for about 40% of the total mitochondrial activity with C₁₆ substrate. The other activity peak had a molecular weight of approx. 70000, contained most of the activity with C₄ substrate and had a C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio of 0.2–0.3. An identical activity profile was obtained if mitochondria were pretreated with the zwitterionic detergent Empigen BB instead of the nonionic Triton X-100. Gel filtration was repeated with increasing concentrations of Triton X-100 (Fig. 3) or Empigen BB (not shown) in the running buffer. The pattern of behaviour was very similar in each case, although Empigen BB was approximately eight times more effective on a weight basis than Triton X-100 [24]. The amount of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity recovered in the high-molecular-weight peak decreased somewhat with increasing detergent concentration, but the C₁₆/C₄ activity rose more than 10-fold. The highest activity ratios (10–12)

were obtained when the high molecular weight C₁₆ activity was 20–30% of the total and this was found with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 or 0.024% (w/v) Empigen BB in the running buffer. These results indicated that a large part of the activity with short-chain (C₄) substrate found in the high-molecular-weight fraction in Fig. 2 was probably trapped in vesicles and was removed when detergent was included in the running buffer. At concentrations of detergent greater than those quoted above the % of C₁₆ activity found in the high molecular weight fraction declined and the overall yield of C₁₆ activity fell significantly. It was not possible, therefore, to use detergent to solubilize the long-chain-specific form of the dehydrogenase in an active form. Thus, when the high-molecular-weight fraction was isolated by gel filtration in 0.024% (w/v) Empigen BB and rerun in 0.06% (w/v) Empigen BB the recovery of the activity with C₁₆ substrate was only 25% of that applied, although it still ran at the same high molecular weight and showed an activity ratio increased from 12 to 18. In contrast, the C₄ activity was 78% of that applied, although it was now found exclusively in the low-molecular-weight fractions. This confirmed that short-chain activity initially pre-

sent in the high-molecular-weight fraction was largely due to physical trapping. The differential stability to high detergent concentration was further evidence for the existence of a separate long-chain-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase.

When mitoplasts, prepared from liver mitochondria by the digitonin method [19] were chromatographed on Ultrogel AcA 34 in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, two peaks of activity with C₁₆ substrate were found (Fig. 4) giving an elution profile like that found with whole mitochondria. The high molecular weight peak coincided with all the succinic dehydrogenase activity, contained 18% of all the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity with C₁₆ substrate and showed a C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio of 10.

This chromatographic procedure in 0.2% Triton X-100 was used to investigate the existence of long-chain-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in those mitochondria studied previously. In every case, a high-molecular-weight peak of activity with C₁₆ substrate was found (Table IV). The C₁₆/C₄ activity ratios of these high molecular weight preparations varied from 6 to 15 and the % of activity of with C₁₆ substrate varied from 18 to

Extracts of mitochondria prepared from liver, heart, kidney and brown adipose tissue (pooled from at least three animals in every case) were chromatographed on Ultrogel AcA 34 in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 as described in Figs. 2 and 3. High-molecular-weight 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity is expressed as a percentage of the total recovered activity measured with long-chain (C₁₆) substrate and the mean C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio for the pooled peak material is given.

32%. Although this technique cannot be used to measure accurately the relative amount of the long-chain substrate-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, it is clear that this enzyme is present in significant amount in heart, kidney, brown adipose tissue and liver mitochondria and in each tissue it appears to be bound to membranes.

Effect of lipid-extracting agents on the substrate specificity of high-molecular-weight 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase

Membrane fractions enriched in activity towards C₁₆ substrate were isolated as described in Fig. 2 (but omitting the glycerol), then freeze-dried and aliquots subjected to various treatments with lipid-extracting agents. These were: repeated dissolution and precipitation (with poly(ethylene glycol)) from 0.42% (w/v) deoxycholate at pH 7.8, or extraction at −15°C by homogenization with 10 ml of n-butanol, or 90% (v/v) acetone, or chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v). After these treatments the recovery of activity (with C₁₆ substrate) was (respectively) 70, 68, 50 and 71% while the C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio was 1.1, 1.3, 1.2 and 1.2, respectively.
These were not significantly different from that of the starting material from the column ($C_{16}/C_4 = 1.2$), indicating that these treatments, which are routinely used to extract a wide variety of membrane lipids, do not influence the substrate specificity.

### Attempted solubilization of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase

In preliminary experiments we had shown that the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity could be released from mitochondrial membranes into the $100\,000 \times g$ supernatant fraction by $3\ \mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{KCl}$ or $0.1\ \mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{EDTA}$, pH 7.9. This technique was combined with the gel-filtration approach to attempt a true solubilization of the enzyme from liver mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 5). The elution profiles showed that $25\%$ of the applied activity with long-chain substrate ($C_{16}$) ran in a high-molecular-weight peak which was, however, not now at the exclusion limit. The remaining $C_{16}$ activity and all the activity with $C_4$ substrate was found at the usual position. After calibration of the same column with cytochrome $c$,

bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), $\alpha$-chymotrypsinogen A, aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) and ferritin, the molecular weight of the two peaks of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity were $186\,000$ and $71\,000$. The higher-molecular-weight enzyme still showed its specificity for long-chain substrate ($C_{16}/C_4$ activity ratio was 9) while the lower-molecular-weight enzyme favoured acetoacetyl-CoA ($C_{16}/C_4$ activity ratio was 0.23).

The relative substrate specificities of these two enzymes were determined with 3-ketoacyl-CoA of chain lengths $C_4$, $C_6$, $C_{10}$ and $C_{16}$ under standard assay conditions (Table V). The lower-molecular-weight enzyme showed highest activity with $C_4$ substrate, but maintained significant activity with increasing chain length up to $C_{16}$. The enzyme of apparent molecular weight $186\,000$ had a very definite specificity for long-chain substrates, showing maximum activity with 3-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA.

Differential effects of proteolytic attack on 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases from liver mitochondria

Further evidence for the existence of separate 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases in mitochondria came from the effects of subtilisin on extracts of rat liver mitochondria and the partly purified enzymes separated by gel-filtration under the high-salt conditions illustrated in Fig. 5. In the crude mitochondrial extract (Fig. 6a), exposure to subtilisin caused a rapid loss in C₄ activity so that by 60 min only 6% remained. Initial loss of C₁₆ activity was less rapid and became very biphasic so that at 60 min 18% remained and further loss was so slow that 16% remained after 160 min of exposure. The result was an increase in C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio from 0.29 at zero time to 0.87 at 60 min and 2.3 at 160 min. This behaviour was due to susceptibility of the 71000 molecular weight enzyme to attack by subtilisin (Fig. 6b). By 60 min of exposure this enzyme had lost 70% of C₁₆ activity and 81% of C₄ activity. By contrast, the enzyme of molecular weight 186000 only lost C₄ activity so that by 60 min 90% was gone while 95% of C₁₆ activity remained (Fig. 6c). Thus, the C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio of the high-molecular-weight dehydrogenase rose to values in excess of 40, indicating that it is probably absolutely specific for long-chain-length substrate. The apparent short-chain activity in the untreated enzyme probably represented contamination with a lower-molecular-weight form.

Discussion

The results reported in this paper describe the evidence for the existence of a new 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in mammalian tissue which differs from those previously reported [5,25] by showing a marked preference for long-chain-length (C₁₆) 3-ketoacyl-CoA substrates (Table V).

Recently, rat liver has been shown to contain two 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases [5]; type I in the mitochondrial matrix, type II in peroxisomes. The enzyme described here had high activity in washed mitochondrial fractions from livers of rats fed normal diets in which type II activity was very low [3,5]. Furthermore, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase enriched in long-chain activity (C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio of over 10) could be found in significant amounts in mitochondrial preparations from tissues, such as heart, (Table IV) in which peroxisomes are absent [26]. The possibility that peroxisomal membranes might be the site of the new long-chain enzyme was finally ruled out by the finding that this activity was located on the inner membrane of liver mitochondria (Table III and Fig. 4). The mitochondrial location of this new 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase also distinguished it from the acetoacetyl-CoA reductase reported by Wakil and Bressler [27].

Unfractionated frozen-thawed rat liver mitochondria (a), low-molecular-weight (b) and high-molecular-weight (c) 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases (separated as in Fig. 5) were incubated with subtilisin at 30°C (2.2 μg subtilisin/mg protein) in the high-ionic-strength medium of Fig. 5. Samples removed for activity measurement with C₄ substrate (○) and C₁₆ substrate (●) and the results are expressed as % of the relevant control activities measured in incubations without subtilisin.

tissues were chromatographed on molecular sieve columns in the presence of low concentrations of detergent, the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase with the high C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio was associated with high-molecular-weight (over 350,000) membrane fractions while the enzyme with preference for short-chain substrates (C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio of 0.2) had a molecular weight of 71,000 and was probably the type I dehydrogenase described in Ref. 3. Further distinction between the long-chain-specific dehydrogenase and the type I enzyme was made by the susceptibility of the latter to loss of activity by proteolysis with subtilisin (Fig. 6b). The effect of subtilisin on the long-chain-specific dehydrogenase (Fig. 6c) was confined to the loss of the low amount of C₄ activity associated with the enzyme. This indicated that separation from the type I form was not complete on gel-filtration.

This affinity of the type I enzyme for membrane fractions prompted us to test whether the new long-chain-specific dehydrogenase activity might not be due to the interaction between lipid in the membrane environment and the type I polypeptide. However, when membrane fractions were subjected to a variety of lipid-extraction procedures the C₁₆/C₄ activity ratio remained high and unchanged, indicating no effect of lipid removal. Furthermore, treatment with high salt concentrations caused apparent solubilization of the new long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from membrane material (Fig. 5) without altering its substrate specificity. Therefore, we conclude that this long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity is due to a separate enzyme which is distinct and different from the type I dehydrogenase [3].

In summary, these studies show that a minimum of 18% of the mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity with long-chain (C₁₆) substrate is due to a second mitochondrial enzyme. The new 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase appears to be bound to the inner membrane of mitochondria and is probably specific for long-chain substrates only and is found in at least four

different types of mammalian tissue. In rat liver there are, therefore, two mitochondrial and one peroxisomal [5] 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases.
