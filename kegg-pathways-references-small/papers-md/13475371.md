(Received for publication, March 18, 1957)

Nicotinic acid, furnished as the sole source of carbon and energy, can support the growth of many bacteria (1–5). The ability to use this compound as a substrate for aerobic growth appears to be particularly widespread in the *Pseudomonas* group. The fermentation of nicotinic acid by an unidentified *Clostridium* has also been reported; the fermentative end products are acetic and propionic acids, ammonia, and carbon dioxide (6). These observations establish the ability of bacteria to carry out a cleavage of the pyridine ring system of nicotinic acid. However, there is relatively little published information on the biochemistry of the process. The first intermediate in both the oxidative and fermentative dissimilations has been identified as 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (7–9). The formation of this compound during the oxidation of nicotinic acid by *Pseudomonas fluorescens* was discovered by Hughes, who was also successful in preparing extracts which would catalyze the reaction (8). These extracts were, however, unable to attack 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, and hence the later steps in the reaction sequence could not be ascertained.

Using another strain of *P. fluorescens*, we have succeeded in extending the work of Hughes on the oxidative pathway, and have established in main outline the nature of the reactions through which nicotinic acid is converted to aliphatic metabolites. Our observations are reported in this paper.

EXPERIMENTAL

Biological Material and Conditions of Cultivation—We have worked principally with one strain, *P. fluorescens* N-9, which was isolated locally from soil by aerobic enrichment in a medium containing nicotinic acid as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Stock cultures were maintained on slants of Difco nutrient agar, supplemented with 0.05 per cent nicotinic acid (neutralized with KOH) and 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Cultures for experiments were grown on a medium of the following basal

composition: NH₄Cl 1.0 gm., MgSO₄ (anhydrous) 0.25 gm., concentrated mineral base¹ 1.0 ml., phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 6.8) 1 liter. This base was supplemented with a source of carbon and energy, added at a concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 per cent. Specifically induced cells were grown at the expense of nicotinic or 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, and uninduced cells at the expense of asparagine or succinic acid. The acids were neutralized before incorporation in the basal medium. In such synthetic media, growth yields are low. When large crops of cells were required for enzymatic work, the medium was often additionally supplemented with 0.02 per cent Difco casein hydrolysate, which increases the growth yield without affecting the specific induced enzymatic pattern.

Cultures of small volume were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks about one-third filled with medium, while being shaken at high speed. The large quantities of cells required for enzymatic work were grown in 20-liter carboys, each containing 10 to 12 liters of medium. The contents of the carboys were not sterilized, but the use of a 10 per cent inoculum, coupled with an extremely short growth period (7 hours), rendered contamination by other microorganisms negligible. Cultures in carboys were stirred and aerated by the passage of compressed air into the medium through spargers. The cells were harvested in the phase of logarithmic growth by the use of a Sharples supercentrifuge, washed once by resuspension in 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and recentrifugation, and stored at –25° as a wet, packed paste until ready for extraction. The yield obtained from cultures in carboys was about 5 gm. (wet weight) per liter of medium. All cultures were grown at 30°.

Preparation of Cell-Free Extracts—Frozen cells were thawed, mixed with 2 to 3 times their weight of alumina (Norton), and ground by hand until cell breakage occurred. Crystalline deoxyribonuclease (5 γ per gm. of cells) and 0.1 M MgCl₂ (0.2 ml. per gm. of cells) were added to the mixture, which was then extracted with phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 6.8), the volume of which was 2.5 to 3.0 ml. per gm. of cells. Alumina and residual unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3000 × *g* to yield a cell-free extract.

For most of the experiments, these extracts were fractionated by centrifugation at 144,000 × *g* for 1 hour, a treatment which yields a clear, straw-colored supernatant liquid (soluble fraction) and a brick-red pellet (particulate fraction). The particulate fraction was then again suspended

¹ This solution contained, per ml., 5 mg. of Zn (as ZnCl₂), 2 mg. of Ca (as CaCl₂), 2 mg. of B (as H₃BO₃), 1.4 mg. of Mn (as MnCl₂), 0.6 mg. of Mo (as Na₂MoO₄), 0.4 mg. of Cu (as CuCl₂), 0.4 mg. of Co (as Co(NO₃)₂), 0.4 mg. of V (as NaVO₂), 1 mg. of Fe (as FeSO₄), 26 mg. of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 31 mg. of nitrilotriacetic acid. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 with KOH.

in phosphate buffer and subjected to one additional sedimentation in order to free it from contaminating material derived from the soluble fraction. Extracts were stored at $-25^{\circ}$ if not immediately used.

Chemicals—Nicotinic acid was purchased from the Eastman Kodak Company and Matheson, Coleman, and Bell, Inc., and 6-hydroxynicotinic

acid from S. F. Light and Company. 2,5-Dihydroxypyridine was isolated from bacterial cultures grown at the expense of nicotinic acid and purified as described below. Extinction curves for these three compounds are shown in Fig. 1.

Nicotinic acid-carboxyl-$\mathrm{C}^{14}$ was obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Maleamic acid was synthesized by the method of Anschütz (10) and fumaramic acid by that of Griess (11).

Deoxyribonuclease was purchased from the Nutritional Biochemicals

Corporation, and crystalline fumarase was generously furnished by Professor J. B. Neilands.

Analytical Methods—Pyruvic acid was identified by the method of Cavallini *et al.* (12), and measured quantitatively by that of Friedemann and Haugen (13). The method of column chromatography developed by Kinnory *et al.* (14) was used for quantitative analysis of mixtures of formic, acetic, lactic, succinic, and malic acids. Formic acid, which was not measured by these workers, is recovered in a sharp, narrow peak which leaves the column just after acetic acid. In a few experiments, formic acid was estimated manometrically by the formic hydrogenlyase reaction, a suspension of *Escherichia coli* grown anaerobically in glucose broth being used.

Non-volatile acids were identified qualitatively by unidirectional paper chromatography by use of the solvent of Adelberg *et al.* (15). For qualitative identification of volatile acids by paper chromatography, the solvent of Kennedy and Barker (16) was used. For the paper chromatography of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, the following solvent mixture was employed: *n*-butanol 100 ml., concentrated HCl 20 ml., water 25 ml.

The colorimetric method of Folin and Ciocalteu (17) was used for the quantitative determination of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. A sample containing 0.05 to 0.3 μmole of this compound was diluted to 6.0 ml. with water, after which 1.0 ml. of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and 3.0 ml. of saturated Na₂CO₃ were added. The optical density at 760 mμ was measured in a cuvette with a light path of 1 cm. after the mixture had stood for 20 minutes at room temperature. Under these conditions, 0.1 μmole of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine produces an optical density of 0.170.

Protein was determined by the method of Weichselbaum (18) and ammonia by that of Braganca *et al.* (19).

Spectrophotometric experiments were conducted with a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer, and manometric experiments at 30° by use of the Warburg apparatus.

### Results

Formation of Pyruvic Acid from Nicotinic Acid by Whole Cells—When tested manometrically, cells of strain N-9 grown at the expense of nicotinic acid oxidize both nicotinic and 6-hydroxynicotinic acids without lag. Both oxidations are initiated only after a long lag by cells grown at the expense of asparagine or succinate. The total oxygen uptake at the expense of nicotinic acid is 7.6 to 8.0 atoms per mole of substrate supplied, and at the termination of oxygen uptake no acidic or ketonic products can be detected in the supernatant liquid.

In the presence of appropriate concentrations of either sodium arsenite or 2,4-dinitrophenol, the oxidation of nicotinic acid is accompanied by a

substantial accumulation of keto acid. This material was identified as pyruvic acid by the method of Cavallini *et al.* (12). A quantitative experiment on the accumulation of pyruvic acid during the oxidation of nicotinic acid by whole cells in the presence of \(5 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{M}\) sodium arsenite is illustrated in Fig. 2. During the initial period of rapid oxygen consumption there was a steady increase in the quantity of pyruvic acid, which reached

FIG. 2. The accumulation of pyruvate during the oxidation of nicotinic acid by arsenite-poisoned cells. The horizontal lines indicate the oxygen uptake required for the conversion of nicotinic acid to pyruvate, and the maximal possible yield of pyruvate (1 mole per mole of substrate). The reaction vessels contained cells (equivalent to 0.43 mg. of dry weight) suspended in 2.0 ml. of 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) with \(5 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{M}\) sodium arsenite. Oxygen uptake was measured manometrically after addition of 2.0 μmoles of nicotinic acid. In parallel vessels, the reaction was stopped at intervals by acidification with \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\), and the vessel contents were used to measure pyruvate.

a maximal level corresponding to the formation of 0.65 mole per mole of nicotinic acid furnished. Since other experiments have shown that the carboxyl group of nicotinic acid is lost as carbon dioxide before ring cleavage, the observed accumulation is 65 per cent of that which is theoretically possible.

*Formation of 2,5-Dihydroxypyridine from Nicotinic Acid by Whole Cells*—Under certain conditions, a phenolic substance which gives a blue color upon treatment with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent accumulates in

cultures of strain N-9 during growth at the expense of either nicotinic or 6-hydroxynicotinic acid. A portion of the supernatant liquid from such a culture was chromatographed on paper. After development, a spot appeared which showed blue-white fluorescence upon ultraviolet illumination. The same spot gave a blue color when treated with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, and a reddish pink color when treated with an acid solution of 2 per cent ferric chloride. The substance was tentatively assumed to be a dihydroxypyridine. Within this group, the above color reactions are specific for the 2,5 isomer (20). In order to confirm the identity of the presumed 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, isolation of a sufficient quantity to permit a chemical characterization was undertaken.

It was first necessary to find conditions which would favor the accumulation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. A clue was furnished by the observation that an aqueous solution of the material isolated by paper chromatography turned green after it stood for some hours at room temperature. Previous workers (1, 3) had reported that a green, water-soluble pigment was sometimes produced by bacterial cultures growing at the expense of nicotinic acid, a phenomenon which we had also encountered. It occurs characteristically in cultures with relatively high concentrations (0.5 to 2.0 per cent) of either nicotinic or 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, after growth has become dense and the medium has become alkaline. It seemed probable that the green pigment was a decomposition product formed spontaneously from 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, and hence that its appearance in cultures furnished an index of the conditions which give rise to a substantial accumulation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. Accordingly, it could be anticipated that the following factors might be important in leading to such an accumulation: high substrate concentration, limited oxygen supply, and mild alkalinity. Systematic experiments with suspensions of cells grown at the expense of nicotinic acid soon revealed that this combination of conditions did indeed cause the formation of substantial quantities of phenolic material from 6-hydroxynicotinic acid. The observation that the accumulation of phenolic material invariably preceded the appearance of the green pigment supported the assumption that the pigment was a decomposition product of the phenolic compound. If the pH of the cell suspension does not rise above 7.8, no marked pigment formation occurs, although there is a satisfactory production of phenolic material.

In the light of these preliminary experiments, the accumulation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine in amounts sufficient for isolation was undertaken. A culture grown at the expense of nicotinic acid was harvested in the exponential phase and centrifuged. The cells were resuspended in 3 liters of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 15 gm. of 6-hydroxynicotinic
acid, previously neutralized with KOH. The final density of bacteria was about 1 mg. (dry weight) per ml. This mixture was distributed into three Fernbach flasks, each of 2.5 liter capacity, which were gently agitated at 30°. Aliquots were withdrawn at intervals and assayed for phenolic material, which reached a maximal value corresponding to 0.9 μmole of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine per ml. after 5 hours. Based on the quantity of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid supplied, this represents a yield of 2.5 per cent.

The cells were then sedimented, and the supernatant liquid was acidified to pH 2.0 by the addition of 6 N HCl. The precipitated 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (containing much occluded 2,5-dihydroxypyridine) was removed by filtration and set aside. The filtrate was passed through a column (23 × 4.5 cm.) of Dowex 50 (200 to 400 mesh, 8 per cent cross linkage) in the acid form. The column was washed successively with 2 liters of water and 1 liter of N HCl, after which the 2,5-dihydroxypyridine was eluted with concentrated HCl. The eluate was distilled to dryness *in vacuo* at 60° and the residue again dissolved in methanol. This solution was decolorized with Norit, adjusted to pH 6.0 with M sodium bicarbonate, and evaporated to dryness *in vacuo*. The residue was extracted twice in succession with boiling isopropanol, and the combined isopropanol extracts were decolorized with Norit and concentrated *in vacuo* until a faint precipitate began to form. The solution was then placed at –20°. Crystallization of the 2,5-dihydroxypyridine occurred, and after 24 hours the crystals were collected and dried, yielding 51 mg. of a gray powder.

The crude 6-hydroxynicotinic acid precipitated by the initial acidification was dissolved again in boiling methanol. When this solution was slowly cooled, most of the 6-hydroxynicotinic acid reprecipitated, leaving most of the occluded 2,5-dihydroxypyridine in solution. After removal of the 6-hydroxynicotinic acid by filtration, an equal volume of water was added to the filtrate, which was then passed through a Dowex 50 column, and purified in the same fashion as the main batch, to yield 28 mg. of material.

The two batches were combined and recrystallized from isopropanol, yielding 51 mg. of almost colorless material. The properties of the isolated 2,5-dihydroxypyridine are listed in Table I, together with the corresponding data of den Hertog et al. (20) on the synthetic compound.

Oxidation of Nicotinic Acid by Cell-Free Extracts and Particulate Fraction—Provided that they are sufficiently concentrated, extracts from cells grown at the expense of nicotinic acid can carry out an extensive oxidation of both nicotinic acid and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid. The protein concentration must be of the order of 20 mg. per ml. Such extracts show a high endogenous oxygen uptake. When limiting quantities of nicotinic acid are added, the oxygen uptake in excess of endogenous approximates
closely the theoretical value for complete oxidation (11 atoms per mole of substrate).

The particulate fraction can also oxidize nicotinic acid, but the total oxygen uptake is only 1 atom per mole of substrate, and there is no production of carbon dioxide. This fraction is wholly incapable of consuming oxygen at the expense of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid. Since Hughes (7, 8) had already shown that 6-hydroxynicotinic acid is formed from nicotinic acid by cell-free extracts, it seemed probable that this compound was the product of the oxidation catalyzed by the particulate fraction. In order to confirm this supposition, the reaction was conducted on a larger scale and the product was isolated.

* Unfortunately, no extinction coefficients for synthetic material have been published. The values given here were estimated from the graph of the absorption spectrum by den Hertog et al. (20), and hence are only approximations.

2 ml. of a particulate fraction (11 mg. of protein per ml.) were mixed with 25 ml. of 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and 4.0 ml. of neutralized, 0.25 M nicotinic acid in an Erlenmeyer flask of 500 ml. capacity. The flask was incubated in a water bath at 30° and shaken mechanically in order to provide sufficient aeration. Aliquots were withdrawn periodically, and the course of the oxidation was followed by measuring the increase in optical density of the mixture at 295 mμ. As shown in Fig. 1, light absorption by nicotinic acid at this wavelength is negligible, whereas 6-hydroxynicotinic acid has a high absorption. The optical density at 295 mμ became constant after 75 minutes, at which time the particulate material was sedimented by high-speed centrifugation. The supernatant liquid was evaporated to a volume of 5 ml. on a steam bath, a slight precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the concentrated solution was

acidified with 6 N HCl. A copious precipitate of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid formed. It was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water, and dried. The yield was 129 mg., or 92 per cent of the theory. This very convenient method was also used to prepare 6-hydroxynicotinic acid-carboxyl-C<sup>14</sup> from nicotinic acid-carboxyl-C<sup>14</sup>. The properties of natural and synthetic 6-hydroxynicotinic acid are compared in Table II.

It is evident from these data that the reaction catalyzed by the particulate fraction can be formulated as nicotinic acid + 0.5 O₂ → 6-hydroxynicotinic acid.

The soluble fraction is unable to oxidize nicotinic acid. The hydroxylating enzyme therefore appears to be strictly localized in the particulate fraction, which also contains the entire bacterial cytochrome system, which is almost completely in the oxidized state. Upon the addition of nicotinic acid to a heavy suspension of particles, there is a rapid appearance of

reduced cytochrome bands, as observed with a hand spectroscope. The hydroxylation of nicotinic acid is, therefore, a cytochrome-linked oxidation.

Oxidation of 6-Hydroxynicotinic Acid and 2,5-Dihydroxypyridine by Soluble Fraction—An extensive oxidation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid is catalyzed by the soluble fraction. The total oxygen uptake is, however, less than that obtained with a cell-free extract which still contains the particulate fraction. The difference reflects the fact that the oxidation catalyzed by the soluble fraction leads to the formation of organic acids (formic, acetic, and lactic) which cannot be further oxidized without the intervention of the cytochrome system, exclusively located in the particles.

Quantitative data on the oxidation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid by the soluble fraction are shown in Table III. For each mole of substrate oxidized, 1 mole of formic acid is produced. The quantities of acetic and lactic acids formed are much less: there is approximately 0.5 mole of each, the sum of the two being almost exactly 1 mole. It will be noted also that the amount of carbon dioxide produced approximates 2.5 moles

per mole of substrate oxidized. These facts suggest that the acetic and lactic acids, together with part of the carbon dioxide, are derived secondarily from 2 molecules of an intermediate formed through the oxidation of the 6-hydroxynicotinic acid. Since whole cells accumulate pyruvate from nicotinic acid in the presence of arsenite, the production of acetic and lactic acids by the soluble fraction could be most reasonably attributed to a dismutation of pyruvic acid. As shown in Table IV, this reaction is in fact catalyzed by the soluble fraction. Quantitative determinations of the

products formed under aerobic conditions from pyruvic and 6-hydroxynicotinic acids by the soluble fraction always showed a molar ratio of acetic to lactic acid slightly in excess of 1.0. This reflects the ability of the soluble fraction to catalyze a very slow oxidation of pyruvic acid, which consequently does not undergo a pure dismutation in the presence of air.

When the oxidation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid by the soluble fraction was conducted in the presence of appropriate concentrations of arsenite, pyruvic acid could be detected qualitatively among the end products. The action of the soluble fraction on 6-hydroxynicotinic acid may, therefore, be represented as

C₆H₅O₃N + 2O₂ + 2H₂O → HCOOH + CH₃COCOOH + 2CO₂ + NH₃

followed by

$ 2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CHOHCOOH} + \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH} + \mathrm{CO}_{2} $

Preparations of the crude soluble fraction characteristically oxidize 6-hydroxynicotinic acid with the uptake of 4 atoms of oxygen per mole of substrate. A single exceptional preparation effected the consumption of only 1 atom of oxygen per mole of substrate. The factors responsible for this are unknown; we were never able to obtain similar results with any subsequent preparation. Spectrophotometric examination of the vessel

934 BACTERIAL OXIDATION OF NICOTINIC ACID

Typical preparations of the soluble fraction, which oxidize 6-hydroxy- nicotinic acid with the uptake of 4 atoms of oxygen, can also rapidly oxidize 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, with formation of the same end products: ammonia, carbon dioxide, and formic, acetic, and lactic acids. The total oxygen uptake is 3 atoms per mole of substrate.

*Effects of Dilution and Aging on Oxidations Catalyzed by Soluble Fraction*—The enzymatic oxidation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid is nearly always characterized by an initial lag, the duration and intensity of which depend markedly on the concentration of the enzyme system. Indeed, if even a fresh and highly active soluble fraction is diluted to a protein content of about 5 mg. per ml., the ability to consume oxygen at the expense of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid is completely lost. The system is likewise very sensitive to aging. If a soluble fraction is shaken in air in a Warburg vessel for 90 minutes before the addition of substrate, the duration of the lag in oxygen uptake is doubled, and the subsequent steady maximal rate of oxidation is halved. The extreme apparent instability of this system probably reflects coupling with some reactant present in the soluble fraction. The kinetics of the oxidation resemble those of tryptophan oxidation by tryptophan peroxidase (21, 22), and it is possible that a similar coupled peroxidase-oxidase system is involved. Activity is fairly well maintained in frozen extracts, stored at $-25^{\circ}$. Such extracts can be preserved for several weeks before the decline in their activity becomes sufficient to preclude further use.

The system responsible for the oxidation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine is much less sensitive to dilution and aging. Oxygen uptake always begins immediately after substrate addition, and proceeds at a constant rate until 2 atoms of oxygen per mole of substrate have been consumed. The

differential effects of dilution on the oxidation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine by the soluble fraction are illustrated in Fig. 3.

**Enzymatic Conversion of 2,5-Dihydroxypyridine to Dicarboxylic Acids—**

The magnitude of the oxygen uptake at the expense of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine is influenced by the concentration of the enzyme system (Fig. 3). With a concentrated soluble fraction, there is a rapid uptake of 2 atoms of oxygen, followed by a somewhat slower uptake of a 3rd atom. If such a preparation is appropriately diluted, the total oxygen uptake falls to 2 atoms. Quantitative analysis of the products formed under these conditions (Table VI) shows that 2,5-dihydroxypyridine is converted to 1 mole each of ammonia, formic acid, and malic acid. Presumably the oxidation of malic acid to pyruvic acid is prevented by dilution.

If the oxidation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine by a diluted preparation is arrested before completion of the oxygen uptake, some fumaric acid can be detected by paper chromatography among the products in the reaction mixture. These observations show that the carbon skeleton of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine is converted to 1 mole of formic acid and 1 mole of a C₄ compound which can give rise by subsequent reactions to fumaric and malic acids.

ages between atoms 3 and 4 or 4 and 5 of the ring cannot yield directly an aliphatic product containing more than 3 carbon atoms, and hence appeared unlikely.

There are relatively few known biochemical mechanisms for the produc-
tion of formic acid and, if the nature of the substrate is considered, only one of these mechanisms appeared at all probable; namely, the hydrolysis of an N-formyl group. A cleavage reaction which yields an aliphatic product with a terminal N-formyl group was accordingly indicated, and this in turn limited the likely sites of ring opening to the 2,3 and 5,6 positions. Cleavage between atoms 2 and 3 appeared improbable, as Hughes (8) had already pointed out. Hughes found that 5-fluoronicotinic acid can be oxidized almost as extensively as nicotinic acid itself, a fact which is not readily explicable if the 5 position of nicotinic acid (equivalent
to the 3 position of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine) is involved in oxidative ring cleavage.

This left a 5,6 cleavage as the most likely possibility. Oxidative ring cleavage of benzenoid phenolic substrates occurs characteristically with the uptake of 2 atoms of oxygen. A similar cleavage of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine between the 5 and 6 positions should yield *N*-formylmaleamic acid as the first product. Three subsequent non-oxidative reactions would be required to convert this compound to fumaric acid: two hydrolyses, liberating formic acid and ammonia, respectively, and a cis-trans isomerization. The simultaneous liberation of the formyl and amino groups as formamide could be excluded *a priori*, since earlier experiments had shown that the soluble fraction is unable to attack formamide. The postulated immediate product of ring cleavage, *N*-formylmaleamic acid, has never been described or synthesized. However, its conversion to fumaric acid, after a hydrolytic removal of the formyl group, would necessarily involve as intermediates either maleamic acid or fumaramic acid or both. Both of these compounds, the respective semiamides of maleic and fumaric acids, are known and can be easily synthesized. Their preparation was accordingly undertaken as indicated in the section on methods.

The action of the soluble fraction on fumaric, maleic, fumaramic, and maleamic acids was tested in the following way. A series of tubes, each containing 0.2 ml. of the soluble fraction (15 mg. of protein per ml.), was prepared. To each tube there were added 100 μmoles of one of the acids mentioned above (0.5 ml. of a neutral 0.2 M solution). The tubes were incubated under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 3 hours at room temperature. At the end of this period, 0.5 ml. of 2 N H₂SO₄ was added to each tube. The contents were extracted with ether, the ether extracts were evaporated to dryness, and the residues were dissolved in an excess of NH₄OH. Aliquots were then chromatographed on paper, in parallel with samples of the pure acids, the solvent of Adelberg *et al.* being used (15). Chromatography showed (*a*) that fumaramic acid had not been attacked by the soluble fraction, (*b*) that maleamic and maleic acids had been converted entirely to mixtures of fumaric and malic acids, and (*c*) that fumaric acid had been partly converted to malic acid.

The reactions which result in the conversion of maleamic and maleic acids to fumaric and malic acids were further investigated by spectrophotometry. Although the ultraviolet absorption spectra of maleamic, maleic, and fumaric acids are similar in shape, the extinctions of these three acids differ (Fig. 4). Fumaric acid has the highest extinction, followed in turn by maleamic acid and maleic acid. Consequently the hydrolysis of maleamic acid to maleic acid causes a fall in optical density, the isomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid causes a rise in optical
density, and the conversion of fumaric acid to malic acid, which has negligible ultraviolet light absorption, causes a fall in optical density. Measurements were made at 295 mμ, where the extinctions are low, which permits the use of relatively high concentrations of substrates. The results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 5. There is a slow change of optical density with fumaric acid as substrate, indicating that the fumarase activity in the soluble fraction is weak. With maleic acid as a substrate, the optical density rises rapidly to a maximum and then declines slowly at a rate which parallels fairly closely the rate of decline of optical density with fumaric acid as substrate. The fact that fumaric acid had

![Figure 4](#fig-4)

FIG. 4. The absorption spectra of maleic, maleamic, fumaric, and fumaramic acids in water at pH 6.8.

been formed from maleic acid was established by the addition of a large amount of crystalline fumarase, at the time indicated in Fig. 5 by an arrow. This was immediately followed by a rapid fall in optical density. With maleamic acid as substrate, there is a short initial decline of optical density, reflecting the conversion of the maleamic to maleic acid; the subsequent optical density changes parallel those observed with maleic acid as substrate. The ultimate accumulation of fumaric acid was again demonstrated by the occurrence of a rapid decline of optical density upon the addition of fumarase. No optical density change occurs when fumaramic acid is added to the soluble fraction, which confirms its biochemical inertness in this system.

The demonstration that the soluble fraction derived from cells grown

on nicotinic acid can catalyze the rapid conversion of maleamic acid to fumaric acid was in accord with our deductions concerning the mechanism of ring cleavage, but constituted only indirect evidence for the postulated mechanism. However, maleamic and maleic acids were not previously known to occur naturally, and hence the existence of enzymes capable of attacking them in a bacterial extract could be regarded as an event with an

exceedingly small random probability. The most reasonable interpretation of this observation is that the two acids in question are intermediates in the dissimilation of nicotinic acid, and that the high activities of the two enzymes which act upon them in extracts of bacteria grown at the expense of nicotinic acid are a consequence of sequential induction (simultaneous adaptation). Accordingly, an extract was prepared in the usual manner from cells of strain N-9 grown at the expense of succinic acid. The soluble fraction was isolated by high speed centrifugation, and tested spectrophotometrically for its ability to attack maleamic, maleic, and fumaric acids.

Fumaric acid was slowly decomposed, but there was no decomposition of the two other substrates. This experiment shows that the enzymes acting upon maleamic and maleic acids are inducible in strain N-9, and are formed as a consequence of growth at the expense of nicotinic acid. In view of the steric specificity of induced enzyme synthesis, the observed patterns of activity are intelligible only as a consequence of sequential induction.

Interestingly enough, neither maleamic nor maleic acid can serve as a substrate for the growth of strain N-9 or be oxidized by it. Since our culture collection contained many other strains of the *Pseudomonas* group capable of growing at the expense of nicotinic acid, a systematic study of the ability of these strains to use maleamic and maleic acids for growth was undertaken. None could grow with maleamic acid, and only a small minority with maleic acid. Among those strains initially incapable of growing with maleic acid, some gave rise to mutants which had acquired this ability. Presumably the intact bacterial cell is as a rule impermeable to maleic acid, but the permeability barrier can be overcome by mutation.

Properties of 2,5-Dihydroxypyridine Oxidase—2,5-Dihydroxypyridine has an absorption maximum at 320 mμ (Fig. 1), and its oxidation can, accordingly, be conveniently measured by spectrophotometry. By use of a spectrophotometric assay, some preliminary studies of the oxidase were carried out. The enzyme shows roughly equal activity in pyrophosphate, phosphate, and glycylglycine buffers, but considerably less in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer. The pH optimum lies close to 8.0, but at this pH some component of the system appears to be rapidly inactivated, and linear rates cannot be maintained. Almost all activity is lost after storage at 0° for 48 hours.

Experiments with inhibitors showed that α,α′-dipyridyl at a concentration of 1.7 × 10⁻³ M completely abolished oxidase activity, suggesting the involvement of iron in the reaction. Spectrophotometric study of the effect of ferrous ions is complicated by the ready oxidation of ferrous salts with air under alkaline conditions, and the resulting precipitation of ferric hydroxide. Fortunately, the oxidase is still active at pH 6.5. With 0.5 M acetate (pH 6.5) as a solvent, ferrous ions may be added to the reaction mixture without formation of a precipitate.

Dialysis of the soluble fraction against water at 5° for 12 hours causes a complete loss of activity, but activity of such a dialyzed preparation can be restored by the addition of ferrous iron (3.3 × 10⁻⁴ M ferrous ammonium sulfate). The effect of Fe++ cannot be duplicated by Mn++, Ni++, Co++, or Fe+++. The requirement for Fe++ for the oxidation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine by a dialyzed extract is shown in Fig. 6.

The oxidase can be fractionated by the use of ammonium sulfate, al-

though ammonium sulfate precipitation causes a complete resolution with respect to Fe++. In a preliminary fractionation, the bulk of the activity was recovered in the fraction which precipitated between 0.50 and 0.625 saturation. This fraction was found to be incapable of attacking maleamic acid. An experiment was therefore conducted in order to determine the nature of the products which accumulated as a result of the oxidation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. Two flasks were furnished with 5 ml. of 0.5 M acetate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.5 ml. of the enzyme fraction (11.5 mg. of protein

Ferrous ammonium sulfate (0.1 ml. of a 0.01 M solution) was added at -2 minutes (Curve 1), 1 minute (Curve 2), and 4 minutes (Curve 3).

per ml.), and 0.5 ml. of 0.01 M ferrous ammonium sulfate. One flask was furnished in addition with 30 μmoles of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. The flasks were incubated at a temperature of 30°, and agitated mechanically to provide aeration. Aliquots were withdrawn at intervals, and the course of the oxidation was followed by determination of the optical density at 320 mμ. After 60 minutes, 90 per cent of the added 2,5-dihydroxypyridine had disappeared. The reaction mixtures were deproteinized, and formic acid was measured on aliquots by the formic hydrogenlyase method. The control flask contained none, whereas the flask furnished with 2,5-dihydroxypyridine contained 27.6 μmoles of formic acid. The remainder of the deproteinized reaction mixtures was extracted with ether, and aliquots

of the ether extracts were subjected to paper chromatography. A spot corresponding to known maleamic acid was found in the material from the flask furnished with 2,5-dihydroxypyridine; there was no trace of maleic, fumaric, or malic acid. In order to confirm the presence of maleamic acid, the remaining ether extract was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). When this solution was treated with the soluble fraction, the spectral changes characteristic of the action of the soluble fraction on synthetic maleamic acid took place (Fig. 7). It may therefore be concluded that 2,5-dihydroxypyridine had been converted to maleamic and formic acids by the fractionated oxidase preparation.

# DISCUSSION

The oxidation of nicotinic acid by *P. fluorescens* is mediated through a series of special enzymes, of which the synthesis is induced sequentially by exposure of the cells to nicotinic acid. By the action of these enzymes, the primary substrate is converted to ammonia, carbon dioxide, formic acid, and fumaric acid. The subsequent steps are not peculiar to this oxidation; with the formation of fumaric acid, 4 carbon atoms derived from nicotinic acid enter the main pathways of cellular metabolism. The individual steps in the conversion of nicotinic acid to fumaric acid are illustrated in Fig. 8. There is still no direct evidence for one of the postulated intermediates, N-formylmaleamic acid, which we infer to be the immediate product of ring cleavage.

The fate of the individual atoms of nicotinic acid is indicated schematically in Fig. 9. Physiologically speaking, the important feature of this oxidation is the production of 1 mole of pyruvic acid from each mole of substrate. The pyruvic acid so generated serves as the proximate source of carbon for synthesis and growth. Its oxidation must also provide the main source of energy, although some energy may also be obtained from preceding oxidative steps which are cytochrome-linked. These include the initial hydroxylation of nicotinic acid and the oxidation of formic acid, both catalyzed by enzymes bound to the particulate cellular fraction, which also bears the cytochrome system.

In the bacterial fermentation of nicotinic acid discovered by Harary (6, 9), the substrate is decomposed to yield 1 mole each of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and propionic and acetic acids. Harary has also shown that the first product is 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, identical with the first product in the oxidative pathway. It is, accordingly, possible that the anaerobic dissimilation occurs through the same series of intermediates as the aerobic one. This would imply that the formyl group, derived from position 2 of nicotinic acid, is preserved and transferred to another 1-carbon fragment

to form acetic acid, and that the propionic acid is derived from carbon atoms 3, 4, and 5 or 4, 5, and 6, like the pyruvic acid formed in the aerobic dissimilation.

There are some striking parallels between the oxidative dissimilation of the pyridine ring, as exemplified by the present work, and the various oxidative dissimilations of substrates which contain the benzene ring. Characteristic of both classes of oxidations is the occurrence of a double hydroxylation of the ring as a preliminary to its oxidative cleavage. In the oxidation of benzenoid substrates, the two hydroxyl groups are inserted either ortho to each other, as in the oxidation of benzoic acid (hydroxylated intermediate: catechol), or para, as in the oxidation of tyrosine (hydroxylated intermediate: homogentisic acid). In the oxidation of nicotinic acid,

![Fig. 8](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)
**Fig. 8.** The pathway for the conversion of nicotinic acid to fumaric acid.

![Fig. 9](https://i.imgur.com/7654321.png)
**Fig. 9.** The metabolic fates of the individual atoms of nicotinic acid.

the two hydroxyls are inserted para to each other (intermediate: 2,5-dihydroxypyridine), and, just as in the case of homogentisic acid, ring cleavage then occurs across a bond adjacent to one of the carbon atoms which bears a hydroxyl group.

The oxidases which cleave benzenoid rings constitute a distinctive group of enzymes. The group properties include a requirement for ferrous ions and the catalysis of an oxidation which consumes 2 atoms of oxygen. The oxygen actually enters into the oxidized product, as recently proved by Hayaishi *et al.* (23), for catechol oxidase. These oxidases accordingly catalyze biological oxidations in which a direct addition of molecular oxygen to an organic substrate takes place. Our preliminary observations indicate that 2,5-dihydroxypyridine oxidase will take its place in the same class. It requires ferrous ions for activity, and the reaction occurs with the simultaneous uptake of 2 atoms of oxygen.

These ring cleavages all give rise to aliphatic products which contain at least one double bond of cis configuration. In reaction sequences in which

ring cleavage occurs between adjacent hydroxyl groups, such as the sequences leading from catechol (24) and protocatechuic acid (25), two double bonds of cis configuration remain and are subsequently eliminated by formation and hydrolysis of a lactone (26, 27). In reaction sequences in which ring cleavage involves a substrate with two hydroxyl groups in para relationship, the product has only one double bond of cis configuration. This is exemplified by the formation of maleylacetoacetic acid from homogentisic acid (28). The same situation is encountered in the oxidation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. In both of these reaction sequences, the subsequent elimination of the double bond involves a specific enzymatic cis-trans isomerization, with subsequent hydration of the trans isomer so formed. In the oxidation of homogentisic acid, cis-trans isomerization takes place immediately after cleavage, with the formation of fumarylacetoacetic acid, which is decomposed to fumaric acid and acetoacetic acid before hydration of the trans double bond occurs (29). In the oxidation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, the cis configuration of the aliphatic product is initially retained, and the two steps necessary for double bond elimination occur in conjunction at a later stage (isomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid, followed by hydration to malic acid).

The biological oxidations of unsaturated ring systems therefore appear to involve certain characteristic types of reactions, catalyzed by special classes of enzymes uniquely operative in these reaction sequences.

SUMMARY

The pathway for the oxidation of nicotinic acid by a strain of *Pseudomonas fluorescens* has been investigated. The first step, catalyzed by a cytochrome-linked, particulate enzyme system, is hydroxylation in the 6 position. This is followed by an oxidative decarboxylation to yield 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, which is in turn cleaved oxidatively to yield maleamic and formic acids. Maleamic acid undergoes a hydrolytic deamination to maleic acid, which is isomerized to fumaric acid. All of these reactions except the initial hydroxylation are catalyzed by soluble enzymes.
