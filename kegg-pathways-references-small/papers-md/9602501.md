Abstract—Long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission at parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in the cerebellum has been the first established example of enduring decrease of synaptic efficacy in the central nervous system. This review focuses on the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.

Thus, at the level of the postsynaptic membranes of PCs, induction of LTD requires concomitant activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxalone-4-propionate (AMPA) and mGluR1α types respectively.

Subsequent intracellular cascades involve production of nitric oxide from arginine and of cGMP, activation of phospholipase A₂ and of several protein kinases including protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases. Activation of protein kinase G and of phosphatases are also likely to be involved in LTD induction. In contrast, there are still uncertainties concerning a major role of release of calcium from internal stores in LTD induction. Finally protein synthesis is required for a late phase of LTD to occur.

All available experimental evidence points towards a postsynaptic site for LTD expression. In particular, electrophysiological data demonstrate a genuine modification of the functional properties of AMPA receptors of PCs during LTD, and immunocytochemical evidence suggests that this might result from a phosphorylation of these receptors. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The cellular bases of learning and memory are still a major challenge in modern neurosciences, even though the most popular working hypothesis—i.e.

that these processes involve long-term changes of synaptic efficacy in neuronal networks—was formulated by Ramon y Cajal, almost a century ago. For some time the most deeply investigated use-dependent change in synaptic strength has been the so-called long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission at glutamatergic synapses, discovered in 1973 by Bliss and Lomo (Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973) in the hippocampus of rabbits. Indeed, not only is LTP in the hippocampus, it is easy to induce and appears as a robust phenomenon in every mammalian species where it has been studied (references in Bliss and Collingridge, 1993), but LTP also follows rules which were postulated in the late 1940s by Hebb (1949), so that one commonly speaks of “hebbian synapses” to refer to synapses undergoing LTP under circumstances where both pre- and postsynaptic partners are active at the same time. In 1983, Collingridge et al. (1983) established that the “coincidence detector” required by such a rule to apply is the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor borne by dentate gyrus granule cells and by hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Since then, LTP of excitatory synaptic transmission has been shown to occur in many other regions of the brain, including several neocortical areas, rendering it still more popular as a putative cellular basis for learning and memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993).

In contrast, the inverse phenomenon, i.e. long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission has taken ages to emerge as a respectable phenomenon to study, most probably because neuroscientists working on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus had not found the proper experimental protocol to induce it until a few years ago (see Dudek and Bear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992). In fact, LTD was discovered in another brain structure, the cerebellum, within the framework of a postulated role of this structure in motor learning, as initially postulated by Brindley (1964) and formalized by Marr (1969). According to Marr’s hypothesis, which was based on the principles of operation of the simple perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958), the gain of synaptic transmission at glutamatergic synapses between parallel fibers (PFs) and Purkinje cells (PCs) changes if, and only if, these synapses are repetitively activated at low rate in conjunction with climbing fibers (CFs) impinging on the same PC. In this scheme, CFs act as an external teacher to instruct PF-PC synapses to change their gain in such a way that the cerebellar cortex output become adapted to the desired motor command. In this model, Marr postulated that this long-term change in synaptic strength was an increase (LTP) of synaptic efficacy. However, this model was revisited 2 years later by Albus, who proposed instead that LTD occurs rather than LTP at PF-PC synapses during motor learning, to avoid saturation of neuronal networks (Albus, 1971). A first experimental support in favor of the Marr-Albus theory of cerebellar learning was given in 1982 by Masao Ito and colleagues who showed, in in vivo experiments on rabbits, that conjunctive stimulation at low rate (1–4 Hz) of PFs and CFs impinging on the same PC leads to LTD of synaptic transmission at PF-PC synapses, and that this

change in synaptic strength is input specific, a crucial point for a mechanism involved in motor learning (Ito et al., 1982). In the same paper, the authors demonstrated that coactivation of PCs by CFs and by direct application of glutamate (Glu) in their dendritic fields by ionophoretic electrodes leads to a persistent decrease of the responsiveness of PCs to this agonist, an observation which was reproduced and extended later (see below), and which already suggested that part of the phenomenon occurs postsynaptically. Following these initial studies, Ito proposed that LTD is due to an enduring desensitization of postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxalone-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors at PF-PC synapses, resulting from both their activation by Glu released by PFs and the calcium (Ca) entry which occurs through voltage-gated Ca channels (VGCCs) in PC dendrites when PCs are activated by CFs (references in Ito, 1984). However, cerebellar LTD in in vivo experiments was difficult to replicate by other groups, probably in part because it is somehow less robust than hippocampal LTP, so that some doubts were cast on its reality until the development of in vitro preparations makes it possible to establish unambiguously that LTD is a genuine phenomenon. In the following sections, we will describe the most salient results of these in vitro experiments, which have now led to an understanding of a reasonable fraction of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cerebellar LTD.

2. IN VITRO MODELS OF CEREBELLAR LTD

In the late 1980s, it was shown by Sakurai (1987) on the one hand, and by Crepel and Jaillard (1990) on the other hand that, in acute cerebellar slices maintained in vitro, a reliable LTD of synaptic transmission at PF-PC synapses can be obtained by conjunctive stimulation of PFs and CFs impinging on the same PC (Sakurai (1987), or by pairing PF-mediated EPSPs of PCs with depolarization of these cells giving rise to Ca spike firing (Crepel and Jaillard, 1990; see also below and Fig. 3AFig. 5A). These results were confirmed and extended by Crepel and Jaillard (1991) and by Konnerth et al. (1992). Similar results were obtained by Hirano (1990) on cultured dissociated PCs. On the other hand, Linden and Connor (1991) were also able to induce LTD of the inward currents elicited in cultured PCs by pairing ionophoresis of Glu or AMPA in their dendritic fields with cell depolarization, to mimic activation of PCs by PFs and by CFs respectively. Finally, similar results were obtained in acute slices by Ito and Karachot (1990) with the so-called grease-gap method.

3. GLUTAMATERGIC RECEPTORS INVOLVED IN LTD INDUCTION

It is now well established that the receptor-channels gated by the excitatory amino acid glutamate can be classified into three groups named for their preferential agonist, AMPA, kainate and NMDA. Indeed, molecular cloning studies have identified

different glutamate receptor subunits which can be grouped in several sub-families on the basis of their structural homologies and the properties of the recombinantly expressed receptors. Thus, AMPA preferring receptors are assembled from subunits GluR1, 2, 3 and 4 (Hollmann and Heineman, 1994; Boulter *et al.*, 1990; Nakanishi *et al.*, 1990) whereas kainate preferring receptors are assembled from subunits GluR5, 6, 7, KA1 and KA2 (Egebjerg *et al.*, 1991; Bettler *et al.*, 1992; Herb *et al.*, 1992; Sommer *et al.*, 1992). The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors are made up by combining NR1 subunits with NR2A, B, C and D (NR2) subunits, which endow the NR1/NR2 heteromers with different functional properties (references in Schoepfer *et al.*, 1994).

Cerebellar Purkinje cells, in marked contrast with most other neurons in the brain, have the peculiarity of not bearing functional NMDA receptors *in situ* as well as in organotypic monolayer cultures (Crepel *et al.*, 1982; Dupont *et al.*, 1987; Audinat *et al.*, 1990; Krupa and Crepel, 1990; Konnerth *et al.*, 1990; Llano *et al.*, 1991). This is probably due to the fact that although NR1 mRNAs and the corresponding protein are well expressed in these neurons

(Moriyoshi *et al.*, 1991; Petralia *et al.*, 1994), no expression of NR2 subunits have been detected so far in mature Purkinje cells. Therefore, as previously mentioned, ionotropic receptors present at PF-PC synapses are of the non-NMDA type, and most probably mainly correspond to the so-called AMPA receptors (Renard *et al.*, 1995).

It is also now well established that, in addition to ionotropic receptors, Glu also acts on G protein-coupled receptors named metabotropic Glu receptors (mGluRs). Recent molecular cloning studies have shown the existence of two large subfamilies of mGluRs. The first one is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase (mGluR2, mGluR3, mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, mGLUR8) whereas the second one (mGluR1, mGluR5) is positively coupled to phospholipase C (PLC) (see references in Pin and Duvoisin, 1995) and can therefore lead to the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), as well as to the activation of the InsP₃/Ca signal transduction pathway. The cellular localisation of mGluRs is highly specific so that in the cerebellum, for instance, mGluR1 and mGluR7 receptors are located in Purkinje cells (PCs) whereas mGluR4 receptors are exclusively present in granule cells. More specific

(A) In cerebellar slices, pairing parallel fiber (PF)-mediated EPSPs with depolarization of Purkinje cell (PC) giving rise to Ca²⁺ spikes in the presence of 4 mM CNQX (horizontal bar) in the bath, does not induce LTD, as ascertained after wash-out of the drug. The EPSP amplitudes are plotted against time before and after the conventional pairing protocol (P, indicated by thick bar). Insets display averaged EPSPs recorded during the control period (1), during the effect of CNQX (2) and 15 min after the end of pairing (3) [adapted from Hemart *et al.* (1995) by permission of Oxford University Press]. (B) In cultured PCs, quisqualate/depolarization conjunction (P) in the presence of 20 μM CNQX fails to induce LTD of quisqualate currents, as observed after washout of the compound. A second series of conjunctive stimulations (applied at t = 30 min) in the absence of CNQX induces LTD [adapted from Linden *et al.* (1991) with permission from *Neuron*, Cell Press].**

cally, Baude *et al.* (1993) have recently shown that mGluR1 receptors are located at PF-PC synapses, at the periphery of the postsynaptic receptor densities. Therefore, the question arises of determining which of these AMPA and mGluR1 receptors must be activated to induce LTD.

In early *in vivo* experiments, Kano and Kato (1987) demonstrated that pairing CF input with direct application on PC dendrites of quisqualate—a mixed mGluR and AMPA receptors agonist—induces subsequent LTD of synaptic transmission between PFs and PCs, whereas kainate, aspartate and NMDA are ineffective in this respect. These results are of importance since they were the first to suggest that mGluR and/or AMPA receptors of PCs are involved in LTD induction.

In *in vitro* experiments performed with the grease gap technique, Ito and Karachot (1990) also showed that co-activation of AMPA receptors of PCs by AMPA and of their mGluRs by the selective mGluR agonist 1S,3R-aminocyclopentyl-dicarboxylate (1S,3R-ACPD), is sufficient to induce a long lasting desensitization of AMPA receptors of these cells, again suggesting that mGluR and AMPA receptors of PCs are indeed involved in LTD induction.

Similarly, in dissociated PC cultures, Linden *et al.* (1991) showed that both AMPA and metabotropic receptors must be activated in order to induce LTD (Fig. 1). These results were confirmed and extended by Shigemoto *et al.* (1994), who showed that, in cultured PCs, application of an inactivating antibody directed against mGluR1α also blocks induction of LTD by Glu/depolarization conjunction.

Finally, in acute slices maintained *in vitro*, the demonstration that activation of AMPA and of metabotropic receptors is required for LTD induction was given by the following experiments. Concerning AMPA receptors, Hemart *et al.* (1995) showed that LTD of PF-mediated EPSPs induced

by pairing these synaptic responses with Ca spike firing of PC no longer occurs when the pairing protocol is performed in the presence of the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitrooxaline-2-3-dione (CNQX) in the bath (Fig. 1). In contrast, bath application of CNQX after the induction of LTD does not prevent its maintenance after wash-out of the compound (Hemart *et al.*, 1995).

Concerning mGluRs, Daniel *et al.* (1992) showed that LTD is consistently larger when the pairing protocol between PF-mediated EPSPs and Ca spike firing of PCs is performed in the presence of 1S,3R-ACPD in the bath. However, it was also shown later (Hemart *et al.*, 1995) that this LTD induced pharmacologically and named for this reason LTD<sub>mGlu</sub> has features different from those of the more physiological LTD (LTD<sub>PF</sub>) induced by a conventional pairing protocol between PF-mediated EPSPs and Ca spike firing of PCs. Firstly, this LTD<sub>mGlu</sub> could be also induced in the absence of AMPA receptor activation, i.e. without PF stimulation and in the presence of CNQX in the bath, by simply pairing Ca spike firing of PCs with activation of mGluRs by bath application of 1S,3R-ACPD. Secondly, it will be shown below that LTD<sub>mGlu</sub> appears to depend on the release of Ca from internal stores, whereas LTD<sub>PF</sub> does not. Finally, in the same study, it was also shown that the mGluR antagonist (RS)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) does prevent induction of LTD<sub>mGlu</sub>, whereas it does not prevent induction of LTD<sub>PF</sub>. Therefore, there was an obvious need for other tools to establish the role of mGluRs in LTD at PF-PC synapses.

This was achieved by demonstrating, as shown in Fig. 2, that LTD is impaired in knock-out mice lacking functional mGluR1α receptors (Aiba *et al.*, 1994; Conquet *et al.*, 1994), which made it possible to establish unambiguously that these receptors are indeed necessary for LTD<sub>PF</sub> induction.

Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms in Long-Term Depression of Synaptic Transmission

4. ROLE OF CALCIUM IN CEREBELLAR LTD

4.1. Role of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels

In early *in vivo* experiments, involvement of Ca flowing into PCs through VGCCs in LTD induction was suggested by the observation that stellate cell inhibition prevents LTD from occurring (Ekerot and Kano, 1985), probably by blocking Ca-dependent plateau potentials in PC dendrites following their activation by CFs (Ekerot and Oscarsson, 1981). In more recent experiments in rat cerebellar slices, it was demonstrated that LTD of PF-mediated EPSPs is consistently induced by pairing these synaptic responses with Ca spikes directly induced in the postsynaptic cell by depolarizing current pulses (Fig. 3A). In contrast, when only sodium spikes are induced in PCs during the pairing protocol, LTD is no longer observed and is replaced by LTP of PF-mediated EPSPs (Crepel and Jaillard, 1990; Crepel and Jaillard, 1991), probably of presynaptic origin (Salinet al., 1996). Along the same line, in guinea pig cerebellar slices, LTD of PF-mediated EPSPs induced by their pairing with CF inputs is blocked when PCs are loaded with the Ca chelator EGTA (Sakurai, 1990).

The involvement of Ca flowing into PCs through VGCCs in LTD induction was confirmed still more recently by two independent groups. (1) In cultured PCs, Linden et al. (1991) have shown that LTD of AMPA-mediated currents is induced by conjunctive ionophoretic glutamate pulses and PC depolarization sufficient to produce Ca entry through voltage-gated Ca channels (Fig. 3B). (2) By combining measurements of synaptic efficacy with fura-2 measurements of intracellular Ca concentration in single patch-clamped PCs in thin slices, Konnerth et al. (1992) showed that, in pairing experiments, a transient rise in internal Ca is sufficient to induce LTD (Fig. 3C). It must be emphasized that the fact that Ca concentration goes back to normal levels after LTD induction rules out the possibility that this form of synaptic plasticity is merely a pathological process.

4.2. Role of Na-Ca Exchange

In cultured PCs, Linden et al. (1993) showed that replacement of external sodium (Na) with impermeant ions or with the permeant ion lithium during quisqualate/depolarization conjunction prevents LTD induction, whereas the Na channel opener veratridine promotes the induction of this long-term change in synaptic efficacy. This led Linden and coworkers to propose that Na entry through AMPA receptors or through voltage-gated Na channels during quisqualate/depolarization conjunction participates in the increase of cytosolic Ca concentration required for LTD induction, probably through the activation of a Na-Ca exchange (Fig. 6). However, in acute slices, the role of AMPA receptors in LTD induction does not seem to be simply to allow Na entry into PC, since aniracetam, a compound which potentiates PF-mediated EPSCs (see below) and therefore the entry of Na trough AMPA-gated ionic channels, prevents LTD induction instead of promoting it as expected from Linden's data.

4.3. Role of Calcium Release from Internal Stores

In cultured PCs, Kohda et al. (1995) showed that ryanodine and ruthenium red, two inhibitors of ryanodine receptors, block the induction of LTD of Glu-evoked currents by the conjunction of repeated depolarizations and Glu applications. In the same preparation, Kasuno and Hirano (1995) reported that dialysis of PCs with heparin, an inhibitor of InsP3 receptors, also inhibits LTD induction. Therefore, it would seem that release of Ca from internal stores is necessary for LTD induction in cultured PCs (Fig. 6). However, in acute slices, it was shown by Hemart et al. (1995) that LTDPF could still be elicited in slices preincubated with thapsigargin, a compound which irreversibly depletes Ca internal stores, whereas LTDMGlu could no longer be obtained in such conditions. Therefore, the need for Ca release from internal stores in LTD induction might well be more or less compelling depending on the protocol used to induce LTD.

4.4. Role of Protein Kinases in LTD

It is common knowledge that PKCγ, a Ca-dependent enzyme, is abundant in PCs (Nishizuka, 1986; Hidaka et al., 1988) and that mGluR1α receptors located at PF-PC synapses (Martin et al., 1992) can activate PKC through the production of DAG (see above). It is therefore tempting to postulate (Crepel and Krupa, 1988) that the cascade of events leading to LTD involves a coactivation of PKC of PCs by Ca entry through voltage-gated ionic channels, and by DAG produced by the activation of mGlu receptors by Glu released by PFs. Indeed, a selective LTD of the responsiveness of PCs to Glu and quisqualate (i.e. Asp-induced responses were unaffected) is obtained in about 40% of PCs in the presence of Phorbol esters known to activate PKC, whereas inactive analogs are without any effect (Crepel and Krupa, 1988, 1990; see Fig. 4A). Moreover, LTD of PF-mediated EPSPs following their pairing with Ca spikes in rat cerebellar slices *in vitro* is almost totally prevented by bath application of polymixin B, a potent protein kinase inhibitor (Crepel and Jaillard, 1990) and the same results are obtained when the selective PKC inhibitor peptide 19-36 is directly dialysed in the recorded cells (Hemart et al., 1995). These results were fully confirmed and extended in cultured PCs by Linden and Connor (1991; Fig. 4B). Now, a recent paper by David Linden (1995) has introduced a new player in the game, i.e. phospholipase A2 (PLA2), as schematized in Fig. 6. Indeed, during pairing protocols in cell culture experiments, activation of this enzyme by calcium was shown to be a necessary step in LTD induction, so that only short-term depression (STD) could be induced when PLA2 was pharmacologically blocked. The interpretation given by Linden of these results is that LTD induction requires full activation of PKC, and that this is only achieved when the

enzyme is activated through both the DAG and PLA₂ cascades; when only partial activation of PKC occurs, i.e. when PLA₂ is blocked, only STD can be induced. This is a very important finding even though, as stressed by the author, the presence of this new cascade has to be ascertained in intact tissues before it can be incorporated in a general scheme of LTD induction.

Surprisingly, LTD appears normal in PKCγ knock-out mice (Chen et al., 1995). However, in the same study, the authors showed that this LTD is still sensitive to PKC inhibitors, suggesting the presence of some compensatory process during development.

Finally, in acute slices, still more recent experiments (Boxall et al., 1996) showed that, in intracellularly recorded PCs, two structurally and mechanistically distinct protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) inhibitors (lavendustin A and herbimycin A) block LTD induced by pairing PF stimulation with postsynaptic Ca spiking. Moreover, these PTK inhibitors nullify the run-down of PF-mediated EPSPs induced by intracellular application of the PKC activator (-)-indolactam. Therefore, this data suggests that PTKs are necessary for LTD at PF-PC synapses, and that PKC-induced synaptic depression requires PTK activity.

### 4.5. Nitric Oxide and LTD

There is numerous experimental evidence that LTD also depends on another cascade of events beyond Ca entry into PCs. Indeed, it is known that Ca can induce the formation of nitric oxide (NO) from arginine by activating a CAM-dependent NO-synthase (references in Garthwaite et al., 1988, 1989; see also Ross et al., 1990). Nitric oxide is highly diffusible and thus activates soluble guanylate cyclase (references in Tremblay et al., 1988) in cells where it is produced, as well as in surrounding cellular elements (references in Garthwaite et al., 1989; and in Ross et al., 1990). This cascade of events can therefore activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases in PCs where this enzyme is particularly abundant (Lohmann et al., 1981) as well as in PFs and glial cells.

In intracellularly recorded PCs in acute slices, N-monomethylarginine (L-NMMA), a potent inhibitor of NO synthesis (Knowles et al., 1989), was shown to almost totally prevent induction of LTD of PF-mediated EPSPs by a conventional pairing protocol with Ca spikes (Crepel and Jaillard, 1990). At the same time, Ito and Karachot (1990) also established, with the grease-gap method, that desensitization of AMPA receptors of PCs is likely to require the production of guanosine 3′:5′cyclic monophosphate (c-

GMP) via the production of NO. Later, Shibuki and Okada (1991) showed that protocols known to induce LTD lead to the production of NO in cerebellar slices. The role of NO in the induction of LTD at PF-PC synapses was also investigated in whole-cell patch clamped PCs in thin slices *in vitro* (Daniel *et al.*, 1993). It was thus confirmed that bath application of L-NMMA consistently prevents induction of LTD of PF-mediated EPSPs by their pairing with Ca spikes (Fig. 5B), and that the effect of L-NMMA can be reversed by an excess of arginine. It was also shown that bath application of NO donors and of 8-bromo-cGMP are able to reproduce a LTD-like phenomenon (Fig. 5C). Finally, LTD of PF-mediated EPSPs was also induced when NO donors or c-GMP were directly dialyzed into PCs and these LTD-like effects partially occluded LTD induced by pairing protocols as illustrated in Fig. 5D (Daniel *et al.*, 1993).

The latter results were recently confirmed and extended by Lev-Ram *et al.* (1995, 1997) who showed that, in acute slices, conjunctive PF stimulation/depolarization required for LTD induction can be respectively replaced by NO (or cGMP) and Ca photolytically released inside PCs. Interestingly, these studies showed that LTD induction permits a less than 10ms gap between NO release and Ca elevation, whereas 200–300ms is allowed between uncaged cGMP and Ca increase.

Therefore, it is clear that NO indeed plays a role in LTD induction in acute slices; its site of action is probably the soluble guanylate cyclase of PCs (Fig. 6). This was recently confirmed by Boxall and Garthwaite (1996), who showed that induction of LTD at PF-PC synapses in acute slices is totally inhibited by 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-*α*)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a selective and potent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase. According to Ito and Karachot (1992), cGMP would in turn activate a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), thereby allowing phosphorylation of its specific substrate G-substrate, a potent inhibitor of phosphatases. In this scheme (see Fig. 6), LTD would involve both phosphorylation of AMPA receptors of PCs by PKC, and inhibition of their de-phosphorylation by the NO route.

However, in the cerebellum, NO-synthase has not been identified in PCs, even following RT-PCR analysis of mRNAs directly harvested from these neurons during patch-clamp experiments (Crepel *et al.*, 1994). In contrast, NO-synthase is highly expressed in neighbouring elements (Bredt *et al.*, 1990; Southam *et al.*, 1992). This led us to make the hypothesis (Daniel *et al.*, 1993) that, following a large entry of Ca into PCs during the pairing protocols used to induce LTD, the resulting potassium (*K*⁺) efflux through Ca-dependent *K*⁺ conductances is sufficient to depolarize neighbouring cellular elements to such an extent that they produce enough NO to activate the soluble guanylate cyclase of nearby PCs by a paracrine effect (Fig. 6). Indeed, this hypothesis was supported by electrophysiological experiments showing that raising the extracellular *K*⁺ concentration is sufficient to induce a robust LTD in PCs, which is sensitive to NO-synthase inhibitors (Crepel *et al.*, 1994).

In all the aforementioned experiments, the site of action of NO remained unclear. Using the Coefficient of Variation (CV) method applied to PF-mediated EPSCs recorded in voltage clamped Purkinje cells, we recently showed (Blond *et al.*, 1997) that NO exerts its effects at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites. The presynaptic depression of the PF-mediated EPSCs is mediated through the potentiation of A1 adenosine receptors and is reversible, i.e., it fades away with washout of NO donors. In contrast, LTD of PF-mediated EPSCs induced by NO donors as well as LTD induced by a conventional pairing protocol are expressed at a postsynaptic site. More specifically, the fact that the CV is not modified during LTD expression (Fig. 5) supports the view that the properties of AMPA receptors, rather than the number of spines bearing those receptors, are affected by LTD. This is in striking contrast with current views concerning the mechanisms of LTP in the hippocampus (Kullmann, 1994; Liao, 1995).

In experiments on the role of NO in LTD in acute slices (Daniel *et al.*, 1993), the decrease in synaptic efficacy induced by a pairing protocol with Ca spikes was not completely occluded by that induced by direct dialysis of cGMP in the same recorded cell (see above). This supports the view that LTD involves two different routes, via PKC and via NO respectively (Fig. 6). Accordingly, in a further study (Crepel *et al.*, 1994) it was shown that the induction of LTD is totally prevented when cells are bathed with L-NMMA and dialysed at the same time through the patch pipette with the PKC inhibitor peptide 19-36, whereas blockade of LTD induction with only one of the inhibitors is generally only partial. The fact that LTD may involve two different routes might also explain why no effect of NO blockers was seen in experiments on LTD performed in dissociated cell cultures (Linden and Connor, 1992) since in particular, putative NO donors as PFs and basket cells were possibly scarcely represented. It is also conceivable that cultured PCs only develop the PKC route and are thus insensitive to bath application of NO donors (Linden and Connor, 1992).

Finally, an interesting observation by Ito and Karachot (1992) is that induction of LTD in slices by phorbol esters or by 8-bromo-cGMP requires concomitant activation of AMPA receptors. As we will see below, this fits well with recent experimental evidence showing that LTD induction requires, as an initial step, an agonist-dependent desensitization of AMPA receptors of PCs.

### 4.6. Modification of Postsynaptic AMPA Receptors During LTD Expression

In early *in vivo* experiments on LTD, coactivation of PCs by CFs and by direct application of Glu in their dendritic fields was shown to lead to a persistent decrease of their responsiveness to this agonist (Ito *et al.*, 1982). This observation led Ito to propose that induction of LTD ultimately leads to long-term desensitization of ionotropic Glu receptors of PCs, and thus to the observed decrease in synaptic efficacy (Fig. 6). Accordingly, it was later shown that

### 4.7. Protein Synthesis Requirement During LTD Expression

Synthesis of new proteins has been shown to be required for the establishment of a late phase of LTP in the hippocampus. Similarly, at least in cultured PCs, David Linden clearly showed recently (Linden, 1996) that application of transcription inhibitors or of the translation inhibitor anisomycin, immediately, and not 30 min after Glu/ddepolarization conjunction, attenuates a late phase of LTD. Moreover, LTD induced in a perforated outside-out macropatch of PC dendrite, which lacks nuclear material, returns to baseline values with a time course paralleling that observed in intact PCs with protein synthesis inhibitors. It seems therefore that, as for LTP, a late phase of cerebellar LTD (beginning 30 to 45 min after Glu/ddepolarization conjunction) also depends upon postsynaptic protein synthesis.

### 4.8. Homosynaptic LTD

In previous sections, all protocols used to induce LTD were based either on conjunctive stimulation of PF and CFs impinging on the same PC, or on PF stimulation/ddepolarization conjunction, or on Glu/ddepolarization conjunction. In Ito's group, Nick Hartell recently demonstrated (Hartell, 1996) that repetitive stimulation at low rate of PFs alone is sufficient to induce a sizeable LTD at PF-PC synapses, provided that the stimulation strength is high enough to evoke a PF-mediated EPSP of amplitudes above 10 mV. Indeed, the author showed that such a large PF-mediated EPSP induces entry of Ca through VGCCs that is similar in peak levels to that following CF stimulation, but remains spatially localized to the dendritic branchlets on which the stimulated PFs impinges. Therefore, one may consider that Ca transients elicited by such high PF volleys simply replace Ca accumulation in PC dendrites following CF stimulation in conventional pairing protocols.

Although the fact that such massive and synchronous PF stimulations occurs in real life can be questioned, this study brought another interesting observation, i.e. that this homosynaptic LTD is independent of NO but dependent on Ca, is accompanied by a reduction of synaptic efficacy in spatially isolated PF inputs to the same cell, that is now independent of postsynaptic Ca, but dependent on NO.

Therefore, these results are entirely consistent with our view that two independent routes to LTD exist, via PKC and via NO respectively (see above and Fig. 6), but extends this notion by showing that these two routes can be taken separately and simultaneously by spatially distant synapses located on the same PC.

### 4.9. Cerebellar LTD in Knock-Out Mice

We have seen previously that knock-out mice have been successfully used to establish the role of

Fig. 6. Schematic diagram of signal transduction processes proposed to participate in LTD induction.

mGluR1α in LTD at PF-PC synapses in acute slices (see above). Since then, other knock-out mice have been produced with somewhat surprising results concerning LTD. Firstly, this is the case for knock-out mice for δ2 subunits of Glu receptors. These subunits are present in PCs (Lomeli *et al.*, 1993) but are still rather mysterious, as they do not give rise to functional Glu receptors in expression systems (Hollmann and Heineman, 1994). Nevertheless, Kashiwabuchi *et al.* (1995) recently showed that LTD is impaired in such homozygous mutant mice. The interpretation of this defect is still a matter of conjecture. Secondly, knock-out mice for GFAP also exhibit impaired LTD (Shibuki *et al.*, 1996), for reasons which also remain to be determined.

### 5. CONCLUSIONS

Much is already known on cellular and molecular mechanisms of cerebellar LTD. Beyond further refinements in the knowledge of intracellular cascades involved in this long-term change in synaptic efficacy, the key question which remains to be solved is the physiological role(s)—if any—of this phenomenon. Recent work seems to indicate that LTD impairment is better correlated with impairment of motor learning, such as the eyeblink reflex (Shibuki *et al.*, 1996) or the adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (Nagao and Ito, 1991), than with motor coordination *per se*. Thus, for instance, in GFAP mutant mice, motor coordination seems to be normal whereas eyeblink reflex is impaired as is LTD (Shibuki *et al.*, 1996). Conversely, in PKCγ mutant mice, LTD is normal (as eyeblink reflex) whereas motor coordination is impaired (Chen *et al.*, 1995).
