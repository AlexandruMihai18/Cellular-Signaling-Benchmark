Immunodeficiency due to inborn errors, infections, autoimmune diseases and the toxicity of certain therapies, has become an important clinical challenge. Strategies to enhance immune function could improve the outcome for a considerable number of patients. Although myeloid growth factors have found widespread use in clinical medicine, a 'lymphoid growth factor' has not yet been established in clinical use. Several recent studies have proposed two candidate immunostimulatory cytokines: interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15. In this Review, we discuss recent findings regarding the effects of IL-7 and IL-15 on lymphopoiesis and their potential use for the treatment of immunodeficiency.

Despite progress in the understanding of the immune response to microbial, tumor, self- and allo-antigens, immunodeficiency in patients with inherited or acquired primary immune deficiencies, malignancies, infections (such as HIV), allografts (solid organ or hematopoietic stem cells) or autoimmune diseases continues to be an important clinical problem, which results in significant morbidity and mortality from infections and the failure of immunotherapeutic strategies (such as vaccinations). The development of strategies to enhance immune responses could have beneficial effects in a variety of clinical settings. In this Review, we describe two cytokines, which could both be considered for further development as 'lymphoid growth factors' for clinical use: interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15.

### IL-7

IL-7 is a 25 kDa glycoprotein that is secreted by fetal liver cells, stromal cells in the bone marrow (BM) and thymus and other epithelial cells, including keratinocytes and enterocytes. The IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) consists of the α-chain (CD127) [1] and the common cytokine receptor γ-chain, which is shared by the common γ-chain (γc) family cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21) (Figure 1). Expression of IL-2Rα, IL-7Rα and IL-15Rα on different cells is shown in Table 1.

#### IL-7 and basic physiology

IL-7 is a non-redundant cytokine for T- and B-cell development. Mice deficient in IL-7 or IL-7Rα and mice treated with neutralizing anti-IL-7 antibodies display severely impaired B- and T-cell development [2] (Table 2). In humans, a defect in the IL-7Rα results in a severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID) and a complete lack of T cells [3].

The regulation of IL-7 production is poorly understood. However, an inverse relationship between serum levels and lymphocyte counts has been consistently described in various settings of lymphocyte depletion [4,5]. IL-7 production seems to be constant and serum levels of IL-7 are mainly determined by IL-7 consumption and by the availability of target cells, which express the IL-7R. The regulation of IL-7 gene expression has not been extensively studied and no upstream control sequences or inducible genes in the IL-7 region have been identified. In keratinocytes, a few regulatory elements, which contain interferon-γ (IFN-γ) responsive elements, have been found around the gene sequence [6]. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) can inhibit proliferation of pre-B cells induced by IL-7 and suppress the production of IL-7 by BM stromal cells [7]. Because IL-7 can inhibit TGF-β production by macrophages and fibroblasts, possibly through the upregulation of the TGF-β inhibitor Smad7 [8], both cytokines can regulate each other in a negative feedback loop.

IL-7Rα (CD127) expression regulates the effects of IL-7 on T cells. CD127 is constitutively expressed on naive T cells and is profoundly and rapidly downregulated on activation [9,10]. As shown by DNA microarray, IL-7Rα expression decreases markedly during the transition from naïve to effector T cells in T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice after stimulation by the cognate antigen [11]. This downregulation, which occurs within hours, might be due to IL-2–IL-2Rα activation [12]. The IL-7Rα is re-expressed or remains expressed at the end of the expansion phase in a minority of T cells, which represent ~5–10% of the expanded T-cell effectors, suggesting that IL-7Rα expression has a crucial role in the transition from effector to memory T cells [13].

### The role of IL-7 in T-cell development, activation and homeostasis

IL-7 has an important role at various stages of T-cell development, from T-cell precursors in the BM to mature T cells in the periphery (Figure 2).

#### Thymopoiesis

IL-7Rα is expressed throughout T-cell development in the thymus but it is decreased on double positive thymocytes [14]. IL-7 is a growth and maintenance factor for

(a) IL-7–IL-7R pathways  
(b) IL-15–IL-15R pathways  

Figure 1. Signal transduction pathways of (a) interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and (b) IL-15R in T cells. (a) IL-7Rα is expressed on early thymocytes, T cells, pre-B cells and bone marrow (BM) macrophages. Downstream signaling pathways induced by IL-7 involve Janus kinase 1 (Jak1), Jak3 (through the γ-chain), Src kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), phosphokinase B (PKB), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and STAT5. (b) IL-2 and IL-15 stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activates Jak1 and Jak3 that are selectively associated with the IL-2Rβ and γc. Activation of Jak1 and Jak3 results in STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation, respectively. The IL-2 and IL-15 signaling pathways also involve the phosphorylation of the Src related tyrosine kinases, induction of BCL-2, and stimulation of the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway leading to Fos/Jun activation.

immature and mature thymocytes and promotes the survival of thymocytes (possibly through the upregulation of Bcl-2) in vivo [15]. Along with stem-cell factor (c-kit ligand), IL-7 has a crucial role in differentiation, survival and proliferation of triple negative early thymocytes [16]. It also has a role in the proliferation and survival of single positive CD4+ or CD8+ thymocytes, differentiation of γδT cells [17], and differentiation of thymic dendritic T cells [18]. IL-7 also serves as a cofactor for V(D)J rearrangement of the TCR β gene (TcRb gene) [19].

Mature T cells and the antigenic response  
IL-7 has an anti-apoptotic effect on peripheral T cells by increasing Bcl-2 expression [9] and upregulating lung Kruppel-like factor, which is a T-cell survival factor for both naive and memory T cells [20].  
IL-7 is not required in the initiation phase of the antigenic response, which is regulated by IL-2, IL-12 and IL-15. After T-cell expansion, physiological levels of IL-7 are essential for the generation memory T cells, in both the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets [13,21,22]. A recent study has suggested that, on antigenic stimulation, CD8αα is transiently induced on a small subset of CD8+ T cells, which seem to function as memory precursors [23]. These activated CD8αα+ T cells express the IL-7R, whereas all CD8αα− T cells downregulate their IL-7R on activation. These results suggest that CD8αα molecules promote the survival and differentiation of activated CD8 T cells into memory T cells, at least partially, through the regulation of the expression of the IL-7R. During viral infections, IL-7 controls the transition from effector memory CD8+ T cells (TEMs) to central memory CD8+ T lymphocytes (TCMs) by promoting the survival and maturation of the cells that at the end of the expansion phase retain IL-7Rα expression [13].

in the periphery [9] (Figure 3). Other γc cytokines, notably IL-15 (as discussed later), also have the potential to support HE of T cells. With respect to the survival and HE of naive CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, the role of IL-7 might be crucial for immune restoration [10]. IL-7 is the sole identified cytokine that stimulates the survival and HE of memory CD4⁺ T cells [22,24]. Finally, IL-7, as well as IL-15, can support the survival and HE of CD8⁺ memory T cells [25], and the overexpression of IL-7 in transgenic mice increases the amount of memory CD8⁺ T cells, even in IL-15 deficient animals [26].

γδT cells

IL-7 has a non-redundant role in γδT-cell development in the thymus and the intestine [17]. IL-7 induces the germline configuration for the V–J recombination of γδ TCR genes through the activation of Stat 5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) [27] and

mice deficient in IL-7 or IL-7Rα show a complete lack of γδT cells (Table 1).

B cells

IL-7 was first described as a B-cell growth factor and has a role in survival, differentiation and proliferation of B-cell precursors. A block in the transition from pro- to pre-B cells occurs in IL-7-deficient mice [28]. IL-7 is also required for the rearrangement of Ig heavy chain V segments through the activation of the Pax5 gene [29]. Administration of IL-7 to normal mice stimulates B-cell lymphopoiesis in the spleen, lymph nodes and BM [30]. IL-7 also increases B-cell recovery after stress conditions, such as irradiation or cyclophosphamide treatment [31]. However, SCID patients with IL-7R deficiency have no defects in B lymphopoiesis, suggesting that IL-7 is not an absolute requirement for B-cell development in humans [3].

Figure 2. The effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) on early lymphoid precursors and lymphopoiesis. Common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) have been characterized as Lineage⁻CD44⁺c-KitlowSca-1lowThy-1lowIL-7Rα⁺Flt3⁺AA4⁺ and represent 0.02% of adult bone marrow (BM) [90]. These cells have short-term reconstitution capability for T, B, natural killer (NK), NKT and dendritic cells (DCs), however, their potential for B-cell lymphopoiesis is greater than that for T-cell lymphopoiesis. Thymopoiesis requires continuous seeding of BM progenitors into the adult thymus, however, CLPs have not been isolated from an adult thymus. Recently, a new CLP-2 population has been identified in the thymus, which can be derived from CLPs (now termed CLP-1), and gives rise to B and T cells [91]. Early T-lineage progenitors (ETPs) are defined as Lineage⁻CD25⁻CD44⁺c-KithighSca-1highIL-7Rαlow/neg [92]. CLPs and ETPs represent lymphoid precursors with different B- or T-cell potential, and are probably derived from a still undefined early lymphoid precursor. Recently, a candidate precursor (or analog) for the ETP has been identified in the BM, which is defined as Lineage⁻Sca-1highc-KithighThy-1.1⁻L-selectin⁺ [93].

However, recent studies have demonstrated increased thymopoiesis $in vivo$, as determined by the number of thymocytes with a TCR excision circle (TREC) [37] in IL-7 treated mice, as well as an increased number of TREC+ T cells $in vitro$ in human thymic organ cultures treated with IL-7 [14]. Recently, a dose effect of IL-7 on thymocyte development has been shown using two types of IL-7 transgenic mice, which show low- and high-level over-expression of IL-7. Whereas low-level overexpression results in enhanced $\alpha\beta$T-cell development, high-level overexpression induces a block at an early thymocyte precursor stage [38].

Systemic administration of IL-7 markedly increases thymic cellularity in irradiated old and young mice, which had received a syngeneic or allogeneic BM transplantation (BMT) [39,40]. The effect of IL-7 administration in mice with a damaged thymus (i.e. after radiation) could be due to a reduction in intrathymic IL-7 production after a radiation-induced loss of IL-7-producing thymic stromal cells [41].

**Homeostatic T-cell expansion**

IL-7 is a key regulator of peripheral T-cell homeostasis (Figure 3) and IL-7 administration enhances HE. Transgenic mice that overexpress IL-7 (IL-7 TG mice) have a 10–20-fold increase in the number of T and B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, and numbers of CD8+ memory T cells are preferentially increased [26,36]. IL-7 administration to sublethally irradiated recipients of syngeneic or allogeneic CFSE [5-(and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester]-labeled T cells results in enhanced homeostatic proliferation of T cells with a memory-like phenotype [10]. Administration of IL-7 to recipients of a BM transplant also increases HE of T cells in these lymphopenic recipients [10].

**T-cell immune response**

IL-7 can enhance immune responses, and in several rodent models, supra-physiological doses of IL-7 protect animals from an infectious challenge, control the growth of an experimental tumor or restore skin graft rejection in the absence of thymic function [33,42,43]. IL-7 has also been used ex vivo or in vivo to support or enhance adoptive cell therapy, and in some of these models IL-7 was even more effective than IL-2.

**IL-7 administration to primates**

Peripheral blood T cells increase their expression of Ki67 (a marker for cell proliferation) and Bcl-2 within the first 72 h after IL-7 administration. IL-7 administration to normal or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected monkeys increases both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers in the periphery [44]. Interestingly, IL-7 administration to primates had less prominent effects on B-cell lympho-poesis as compared to rodents [45]. Moreover, IL-7 administration to SIV-infected monkeys or recipients of an autologous BM transplant had stronger effects on peripheral T-cell expansion than on thymopoiesis [44,45].

The toxicity of IL-7 at therapeutic doses is limited. Unlike IL-2 or IL-12, human IL-7 administered daily for 14 to 21 days did not induce fever, capillary leak syndrome

**Figure 3.** The effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) peripheral T-cell homeostasis. Naive and memory T cells in the periphery begin to proliferate during lymphopenia and this slow nonspecific proliferation has been termed homeostatic expansion (HE). HE causes naive T lymphocytes, both recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) and mature T cells, to acquire phenotypic properties similar to memory T cells. These 'memory-like' T cells, at least in the CD8+ subset, also seem to acquire the behavior of true memory T cells in their response to recall antigens (Ags). IL-7 has an important role in the homeostasis of T cells and memory T-cell generation after antigenic stimulation.

**Other cells**

IL-7 has not only an important role in T and B lymphopoiesis and homeostasis but also in the survival and differentiation of other cell lineages, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). For human APCs, IL-7 is instrumental in the development of lymphoid dendritic cells (DCs) in the thymus [18], and for the differentiation of immature DCs from myeloid precursors [32]. Some of the effects of IL-7 on T cells might therefore be indirect and linked to its impact on APCs [33].

**To the bedside: effects of IL-7 administration**

At present no data are available regarding the effects of IL-7 administration in humans, however, a number of studies have assessed the effects of IL-7 administration in experimental animal models.

**Hematopoietic and lymphoid precursors**

IL-7 administration increases hematopoietic stem cell and myeloid progenitor-cell mobilization from BM to peripheral blood, liver and spleen in mice [34]. Common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) express IL-7R$\alpha$, however, the effects of IL-7 administration on the behavior of these cells $in vivo$ have not been elucidated (Figure 2).

**Thymopoiesis**

Data concerning the effect of exogenous IL-7 at supra-physiological doses on thymopoiesis and T-cell development are contradictory. For example, IL-7 administration has no effect on thymic cellularity in normal mice [35] and IL-7 transgenic mice have a normal sized thymus [36].

or any other clinical abnormalities related to the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, at dose levels, which are 10–20 fold higher than the therapeutic dose, IL-7 can induce severe diarrhea and renal failure (Michel Morre, pers. commun.).

**Therapeutic potential**

The biological properties and pre-clinical data of IL-7 indicate its potential use in at least three clinical areas where physicians expect to correct T lymphopenia or boost antigen-specific responses: (i) cancer, (ii) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and (iii) HIV infection.

**Cancer**

Enhancement of thymopoiesis and HE make IL-7 an ideal candidate to promote T-cell reconstitution after chemotherapy and to improve T-cell responses. IL-7 can also enhance the immune response against malignancies and data from experimental tumor models in mice have been encouraging. For example, systemic treatment with IL-7 of mice challenged with a renal cell carcinoma cell line resulted in increased T-cell responses and a reduction of metastases [43]. In a different model, IL-7 administration to mice, which had received adoptive transfer of human T cells, resulted in increased antitumor responses against a colon carcinoma xenograft [46]. When IL-7 was used as an ex vivo growth factor to expand cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for adoptive cell therapy, IL-7 appeared to be more effective than IL-2 and enhanced the in vivo activity of the CTLs transferred to sarcoma-bearing mice [47].

The safety of recombinant human IL-7 is currently being studied in patients with refractory non-hematological malignancies. A Phase I dose escalation trial has been recently initiated at the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA; www.nci.nih.gov/) and the results should be available soon.

**Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation**

IL-7 treatment increases thymic cellularity, as well as T- and B-cell numbers in the periphery, in recipients of syngeneic or allogeneic BM grafts in experimental BMT models. Importantly, graft-versus-tumor activity is not impaired in IL-7-treated recipients of an allogeneic BMT [39]. IL-7 administration also augments antiviral and antimicrobial activity after BMT [42]. A major concern regarding post-transplant IL-7 administration is the possibility that IL-7 could aggravate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in recipients of an allogeneic BMT. Conflicting results have been reported, demonstrating either no effect on [10,39], or an enhancement of [48], the development of GVHD after IL-7 treatment. These discrepancies could be related to differences in experimental models, the dose and the duration of IL-7 administration, and host conditioning, which can affect endogenous IL-7 production, serum IL-7 levels and the ability of exogenous IL-7 to exacerbate GVHD [49].

However, all studies in mouse models concur that no GVHD can be detected in IL-7-treated recipients of T-cell-depleted allogeneic BMT. Therefore, a Phase I/II clinical

trial will be initiated in the near future to assess the safety of human IL-7 in patients receiving a T-cell-depleted HSCT for the treatment of a non-lymphoid malignancy.

**HIV infections**

Enhancing de novo T-cell generation after highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) has become one of the next goals in HIV-AIDS therapy. Despite the thymopoietic and lymphopoietic effects of IL-7 on normal and irradiated hosts, its effect on the course of HIV is controversial. As mentioned before, an inverse relationship between IL-7 serum levels and the intensity of the lymphopenia, measured in peripheral blood, has been consistently documented in several studies [4,5]. In HIV patients, endogenous serum levels of IL-7 and IL-7 production by DC-like cells in the peripheral lymphoid tissues are increased when these patients have low T-cell counts [5]. IL-7 induces virus replication and increases proviral DNA levels in naturally infected CD8⁺ peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures and augments naive T-cell susceptibility to HIV in vitro [50,51]. However, studies in non-human primates infected with SIV have shown that IL-7 administration could stimulate T-cell renewal and peripheral T-cell expansion without increasing viral replication [44,52]. Therefore, it needs to be assessed in further studies whether the beneficial effects on T-cell recovery will outweigh the risk of HIV reactivation.

**IL-15**

IL-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine, which has various roles in the innate and adaptive immune system, including the development, activation, homing and survival of immune effector cells, especially natural killer (NK), NKT and CD8⁺ T cells (Figure 4).

**IL-15 and basic physiology**

IL-15 was first isolated from a simian kidney epithelial cell line in 1994 by Grabstein *et al.* and was described as a novel T-cell growth factor with a biological activity similar to IL-2 [53]. In the same year, Burton *et al.* showed that a lymphokine originally designated interleukin-T (IL-T), secreted by an human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1)-associated leukemia cell line, was able to stimulate T cells and lymphokine activated cells [54] and was subsequently found to be identical to IL-15.

IL-15 is a 14–15 kDa protein of 114 amino acids, and belongs to the four α-helical bundle cytokine family, which includes growth hormone, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6 and IL-7 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). There is 97% homology between human and simian IL-15 and 73% homology between human and murine IL-15 [53]. IL-15 is produced by monocytes, macrophages, BM stroma and thymic epithelium, as well as by epithelial cells in the kidney, skin and intestines (reviewed in Ref. [55]).

IL-15 binds to a receptor complex that consists of the IL-15Rα, IL-2Rβ and the γc chain [53,56]. The IL-15Rα is structurally similar to the IL-2Rα but displays broader tissue distribution. IL-15Rα is a high affinity receptor that binds to IL-15 with 1000-fold higher affinity than the binding between IL-2 and IL-2Rα [56]. IL-2 and IL-15

share a common receptor complex (IL-2βγ) and similar activation signaling pathways that involve Jak and STAT molecules (Figure 1). IL-15 binds to IL-15Ra with high affinity but transduces signals only through IL-2–IL-15Rβ and γc (Figure 1). IL-15 can also block tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1)-mediated apoptosis through the competitive binding of IL-15Ra to TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [57].

Despite their similar intracellular downstream pathways, IL-2Ra and IL-15Ra have different functional roles in vivo. IL-2⁻/⁻ and IL-2Ra⁻/⁻ mice display lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and T-cell-dependent autoimmunity [58]. By contrast, IL-15-or IL-15Ra-deficient mice do not develop autoimmunity but exhibit lymphopenia (especially CD8⁺ T cells) and have decreased numbers or a lack of NK, NKT and γδT cells [59,60]. The distinct functions of the IL-2Ra and IL-15Ra in vivo might be related to differences in expression patterns of these receptors in the immune system. IL-15Ra is found on CD8⁺ T cells (naive and activated), NK, NKT and γδT cells, monocytes, macrophages, DCs, neutrophils and non-immune system cells, such as endothelial cells, kidney epithelial cells, colonic epithelial cells, brain microglial cells and skeletal muscle (reviewed in Ref. [55]) (Table 1). By contrast, IL-2Ra expression is restricted to subsets of pre-B cells, NK cells, thymic precursors, regulatory CD4⁺ T cells and activated mature B and T cells (Table 1).

Despite the widespread tissue expression of IL-15 mRNA, soluble IL-15 is not detectable in normal physiological conditions or in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cell culture supernatants [61]. This suggests that IL-15 secretion is regulated by transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional control mechanisms [62].

NK cells

IL-15 functions as a key regulator of NK-cell development, homeostasis and activity [63,64]. Absence of NK-cell development was shown in IL-15-, IL-15Ra-and IL-2–IL-15Rβ-deficient mice [59,60,65] (Table 2). BM stromal cells produce IL-15 [53], which is required for NK-cell development from hematopoietic progenitor cells in the BM microenvironment. In the BM, Flt3 ligand and c-kit ligand stimulate expansion of NK cells and their precursors in the presence of IL-15. Resting NK cells constitutively express IL-15 receptors (consisting of IL-15Ra and IL-2–IL-15Rβγ) and respond to IL-15 at picomolar concentrations [64]. IL-15 secretion by activated macrophages has a role in the crosstalk between macrophages and NK cells during inflammation [55]. IL-15 administration to normal mice, or overexpression of IL-15, increases the number and percentage of NK cells in the spleen [66,67], the proliferation and survival of NK cells, and their cytolytic activity and cytokine secretion.

T cells

IL-15 has a role in the survival and antigen-independent expansion of naive and memory CD8⁺ T cells [68,69]. IL-15 is a potent stimulator of CD44High or IL-2RβHigh CD8⁺ T cells both in vitro and in vivo but does not affect CD4⁺ T cells [70]. The survival effects of IL-15 on CD8⁺ naive and memory T cells are associated with the upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL [68,70]. IL-15Ra-deficient mice show a marked reduction in CD8⁺ T cells (especially CD44high memory CD8⁺ T cells) but have normal levels of CD4⁺ T cells and B cells (B220⁺) [59,60]. IL-15Ra-deficient mice have a similar phenotypic profile as IL-15-deficient mice but they also have a deficiency in thymic CD8⁺ T-cell development [59]. This implies that IL-15R signaling is important for normal

thymic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell production as well as peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival and proliferation [59]. IL-15 administration to IL-15-deficient mice increased the percentage and absolute number of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells in the spleen and the lymph nodes [60]. Consistent with these findings, regarding the importance of IL-15 for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell memory T-cell generation, viral infection of IL-15-and IL-15Rα-deficient mice results in an adequate primary CD8<sup>+</sup>-cell response but reduced generation of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells and proliferation and maintenance of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [71,72].

In combination with IL-7, IL-15 regulates the HE of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in lymphopenic hosts [73] and IL-15<sup>-/-</sup> mice cannot support HE of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells [25,73]. Finally, it has been suggested that IL-15 has a role in T-cell distribution throughout the body [59] and IL-15Rα-deficient mice show defects in T-cell recruitment into the lymph nodes [59].

### NKT cells

IL-15 is important for the expansion, survival, homeostasis and functional maturation of NKT cells [60,74] and NKT-cell numbers are significantly decreased in IL-15-and IL-15Rα-deficient mice [59,60] (Table 2).

### Macrophages and monocytes

Macrophages and monocytes are major producers of IL-15 [53] and recent studies suggest that they express a complex of biologically active IL-15 and IL-15Rα on their surface, which can be further upregulated by IFN-γ [75]. The IL-15–IL-15Rα complex can interact in trans with IL-15Rβγ or ILRaβγ on neighboring cells (i.e. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells). On macrophage or monocyte activation, the complex is internalized and the IL-15 is recycled in the endosomes and re-expressed on the cell surface [75]. This suggests that IL-15 signaling requires cell–cell contact (APC–T cells) similar to CD40–CD40L, TCR–MHC, CD28–B7.1. IL-15–IL-15R signaling is crucial for the functional maturation of APCs (both macrophages and DCs) and can stimulate IL-12 production. IL-12, IFN-γ and nitric oxide production are severely impaired in IL-15-deficient mice [76].

### To the bedside

To date, IL-15 has not been used in clinical trials and only few preclinical studies have analyzed the in vivo effects of IL-15 administration. A single dose of IL-15 in normal mice results in increased proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells but does not affect CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells, owing to low expression of IL-2Rβ on these cells [70]. Importantly, an increase in antimicrobial activity has been observed after IL-15 administration and also in IL-15 transgenic mice [77,78].

### BM transplantation

Administration of IL-15 to mice enhanced antitumor activity after syngeneic BMT, and proved to be less toxic than IL-2 [79]. In recipients of an allogeneic BMT, IL-15 administration increases NK-, NKT- and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell reconstitution and function [80]. However, IL-15 has the potential to aggravate GVHD and this suggests that IL-15

administration to recipients of an allogeneic BMT should only be considered after a T-cell depleted BMT [80].

#### Tumor immunotherapy

Enhanced T- and NK-cell function resulting in increased antitumor activity has been reported after IL-15 administration to tumor-bearing mice and in IL-15 transgenic mice challenged with tumor [81,82]. Again, in these studies, IL-15 was less toxic than IL-2. Moreover, IL-15 administration can enhance antigen-specific T-cell responses after (i) adoptive transfer of T cells from a TCR transgenic mouse whose CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognize the melanoma gp100 antigen [83] or (ii) vaccination with peptide-pulsed DCs [84]. These results suggest that IL-15 could be a potent adjuvant for a variety of cell transfer therapies and vaccination strategies aimed at enhancing CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses.

#### IL-15 and immunodeficiency virus infections

IL-15 has a central role in the immune response during HIV infection (reviewed in Ref. [85]). Unlike IL-7, IL-15 production is defective in HIV infected patients, and higher IL-15 serum levels correlate with a better response to therapy [86]. A significant difference in the production of IL-15 by mononuclear cells in response to different antigens has been found between untreated patients and HAART-responsive patients [87]. IL-15 also stimulates the anti-HIV response more than IL-2 and IL-7, as determined by IFN-γ secretion in vitro [88]. HIV specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have an important role in the immune response during HIV infection. However, these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are sensitive to CD95 (Fas)-induced apoptosis and IL-15 enhances survival and function of HIV specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [89]. These findings suggest that IL-15 can be used as an immunomodulator in future anti-HIV therapies.

#### Summary

In conclusion, the important roles in the development, homeostasis and activity of lymphoid cells and the immunostimulatory properties in preclinical studies of IL-7 and IL-15 provide a strong rationale for the use of these cytokines in clinical trials to enhance immune recovery and responses. IL-7 and IL-15 could potentially serve as lymphoid growth factors and provide novel strategies for immune recovery and the optimization of immune therapies.
