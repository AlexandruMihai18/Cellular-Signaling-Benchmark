# Photosynthesis: New light on biological oxygen production
**Michael R. Jones and Paul K. Fyfe**

In oxygenic photosynthesis, a highly oxidising chlorophyll species strips electrons out of two water molecules, generating molecular oxygen as a waste product. A recent study has provided new insights into the structure of the molecular machinery responsible for biological oxygen production.

Most biological systems are powered, either directly or indirectly, by energy made freely available by the sun. The process by which the energy of sunlight is captured and utilised by biology is called photosynthesis, and occurs in plants, algae and a wide variety of bacteria. In general terms, light energy is used to power a series of electron transfer reactions that are linked to the movement of protons across a charge-impermeable membrane. The resulting electrochemical gradient of protons is used to power energy-requiring reactions, including the synthesis of ATP. In evolutionary terms photosynthesis is a very old process, probably dating back to the first few hundred million years after the origin of life on the planet [1,2].

In the oxygenic photosynthesis carried out by plants, algae and cyanobacteria, two membrane-bound complexes of proteins and pigments, called photosystems, operate in series to generate the proton gradient. The photosystems have a modular organisation, consisting of a core ‘reaction centre’ that contains the chlorophyll molecules that catalyse light-driven electron transfer, and a surrounding ‘antenna’ region that contains chlorophylls and other pigments that are responsible for harvesting light energy. The emerging crystallographic picture of oxygenic photosynthesis is summarised in Box 1. This picture has recently been added to by the publication of an X-ray crystal structure of the photosystem II complex, at a resolution of 3.8 Å [3]. This new report provides us with new information on the detailed structure of the photosystem II complex, and is a significant step forward in our understanding of this important biological system.

The photosystem II complex uses light energy to catalyse an energetically unfavourable reaction, the reduction of plastoquinone by electrons derived from water (Box 1). The electrons in plastoquinone are then passed on to a small, water-soluble copper protein called plastocyanin, via an integral membrane protein called the cytochrome *bf* complex. Finally, the photosystem I pigment-protein complex uses light energy to catalyse a second energetically unfavourable reaction, the reduction of NADP⁺ by electrons donated by plastocyanin (Box 1). The purpose of this light-driven electron transfer is to produce NADPH, a source of reducing power, and ATP, which is generated via the proton gradient that is established during electron flow from water to NADP⁺.

## Biological oxygen production

Oxygenic photosynthesis is so-called because the removal of electrons from water produces molecular oxygen. Over the course of evolution, this waste product of photosynthesis has gradually built up in the atmosphere, eventually reaching the present day level of around 20%. One of the major aims of photosynthesis research has been to understand the molecular basis of light-activated oxygen production by the photosystem II complex. The removal of electrons from water requires the generation of a very strong oxidant, and it has been known for many years that this is achieved by the photo-oxidation of a particular chlorophyll species inside the photosystem II complex. Water oxidation also involves a cluster of four manganese atoms, in a part of photosystem II alternatively known as the oxygen-evolving or water-oxidising complex. The structural and mechanistic basis for water oxidation has been examined through a combination of spectroscopy, mutagenesis and studies of model compounds, and a very recent edition of *Biochimica et Biophysica Acta* summarises current views on this challenging topic (see [4] and papers in the same issue).

## The structure of photosystem II

Key to a detailed understanding of biological oxygen production is the determination of the atomic structure of the photosystem II complex. As with all integral membrane proteins, this is a significant challenge. In recent years, electron crystallography has been used to provide structural information on single particles of photosystem II, at 24–30 Å resolution [5], and on two-dimensional crystals of sub-complexes of photosystem II either with [6] or without [7] oxygen-evolving activity, at resolutions of 8–9 Å. This information has been interpreted using extensive knowledge of the biochemistry of photosystem II, and through homologies with the reaction centre complex of purple bacteria, where X-ray structural models are available at resolutions approaching 2 Å [8], and with photosystem I, where a 4 Å resolution structural model is available [9–11]. The results from electron crystallography have emphasised the dimeric nature of photosystem II, and have produced proposals

A schematic representation of the molecular machinery that catalyses oxygenic photosynthesis. The arrows show the direction of electron flow from water to NADP⁺, and PQ refers to the intramembrane pool of plastoquinone/plastoquinol. In their recent report, Zouni et al. [3] describe a structural model for the *Synechococcus elongatus* photosystem II. At the 3.8 Å resolution reported, the protein components are modelled as connected Cα carbon atoms and the chlorophyll cofactors as porphyrin rings. A 4.0 Å resolution structure of the *Synechococcus elongatus* photosystem I complex has also been described by the same laboratories [9–11], and a new 2.5 Å resolution structure for this complex will be published in the near future (P. Fromme, P. Jordan and N. Krauß, personal communication). High-resolution structures have been determined for plastocyanin, ferredoxin and ferredoxin:NADP⁺ oxidoreductase from a variety of sources, and the complexes from spinach are shown [15–17]. Although an X-ray crystal structure for the cytochrome *bf* complex has not been determined, high-resolution structural models have been produced for the extra-membrane regions of the Rieske Fe-S protein and cytochrome *f* subunits from spinach [18] and turnip [19], respectively. In addition, a very recent report [20] describes the X-ray crystal structure of the interaction complex formed between ferredoxin and ferredoxin:NADP⁺ oxidoreductase from maize.

as to the organisation of the main protein subunits, including the components that are the site of oxygen evolution [5–7].

In a recent report in *Nature*, Zouni et al. [3] have reported an X-ray structure for the photosystem II complex from the thermophilic cyanobacterium *Synechococcus elongatus*, at a resolution of 3.8 Å. At this resolution, the structure shows the spatial organisation of the protein subunits, and the location and gross orientation of a number of the cofactors, including the chlorophylls and the atoms of the manganese cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex.

#### Details of the X-ray structure

The *Synechococcus elongatus* photosystem II is a dimer in the crystals produced by Zouni et al. [3], the two monomers being related by an axis of two-fold rotational symmetry orientated perpendicular to the plane of the membrane [3]. Given the limited resolution of the X-ray data, only major structural elements, such as α helices and β sheets, have been modelled, as a Cα trace. The chlorophyll *a*, phaeophytin *a* (chlorophyll *a* lacking the central magnesium) and heme cofactors have been modelled as porphyrin rings, reflecting the fact that the planes of the macrocycles can be modelled in the electron density map but the precise orientations of these tetrapyrrolles within the plane of the macrocycle cannot be modelled.

Each monomer has 36 transmembrane α helices, 29 of which have been assigned to one of the approximately 14 membrane-integral subunits of the *Synechococcus elongatus* photosystem II. As with previous lower-resolution studies, these assignments have been made largely on the basis of homologies with the purple bacterial reaction centre, and through knowledge of the biochemistry of photosystem II, including the results of cross-linking studies. The major subunits of photosystem II, namely D1, D2, CP43, CP47 and cyt *b*₅₅₉, are included in the model and account for 24 of the transmembrane α helices. Five additional minor subunits, each with a single transmembrane α helix, have also been modelled (although some of these assignments are tentative), as have two of the three membrane-extrinsic subunits. Three subunits intrinsic to the membrane remain unsigned, and presumably correspond to some or all of the ...### Figure 1

**Arrangement of the cofactors in the reaction centres of photosystem I, photosystem II and purple photosynthetic bacteria, viewed in the plane of the membrane. In the deposited coordinates of photosystems I and II, the chlorophyll and pheophytin cofactors are modelled as porphyrin rings, because of the limited resolution of the X-ray data. For the purposes of comparison, the bacteriochlorophyll and bacteriopheophytin cofactors of the *Rhodobacter sphaeroides* reaction centre are also shown as porphyrin rings. In photosystem II and the bacterial reaction centre, the pheophytin and bacteriopheophytin cofactors, respectively, can be distinguished by the absence of the central magnesium atom (green sphere) that is present in chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll. In photosystem II, only the tightly bound ($Q_A$) quinone is present, modelled as a six-membered ring, whereas both quinones are present in the bacterial complex. In photosystem I, the approximate positions of the quinones are marked by the red bars. Photosystem II and the bacterial reaction centre contain a non-heme iron atom (brown sphere), whereas photosystem I contains three Fe₄S₄ centres, labelled $F_X$, $F_A$ and $F_B$. The model of photosystem II includes the four Mn atoms of the manganese cluster, and the proposed position of the redox-active residue Tyr$_Z$ ($Y_Z$). The inset shows the spacing of the excitonically coupled chlorophyll pairs denoted as P700 in photosystem I and P870 in the bacterial reaction centre, and the spacing of the equivalent chlorophylls in the photosystem II reaction centre.**

### A common structural blueprint for photochemistry in photosynthesis

In the new structural model of photosystem II [3], four molecules of chlorophyll $a$ and two molecules of pheophytin $a$ are modelled into the reaction centre domain (Figure 1), arranged in two membrane-spanning branches around an axis of two-fold rotational symmetry (vertical line in Figure 1). This region also contains a modelled plastoquinone and a non-heme iron atom. The arrangement of these cofactors, and the arrangement of the transmembrane helices of the D1 and D2 subunits, confirms the much-discussed structural homology between the photosystem II reaction centre and the reaction centres of purple bacteria and photosystem I (Figure 1), and underlines the view that the diverse reaction centres seen in plants, algae and bacteria have a common evolutionary ancestor [2,13,14].

An intriguing feature of the structural model of photosystem II is the spacing of the two chlorophylls located closest to the lumenal side of the membrane. In both the purple bacterial reaction centre and the photosystem I reaction centre, the equivalent chlorophylls are sufficiently close together that they behave as a dimer (see inset to Figure 1). These dimers, denoted as P870 and P700 respectively, are the site of the photochemical reaction that initiates transmembrane electron transfer in each complex, and are referred to as the ‘primary donor’ of electrons to signify this.

Turning to the cofactors, the structural model includes (per monomer) 36 porphyrin rings — 32 chlorophyll $a$ rings, two pheophytin $a$ rings and two cytochrome hemes — and one plastoquinone modelled as a benzene ring. Zouni *et al.* [3] have also assigned a bulge in the electron density, corresponding to the C helix of the D1 subunit, to residue tyrosine 161 (Figure 1). This residue is also known as Tyr$_Z$ ($Y_Z$), and operates as an electron transfer intermediate between the photo-oxidised chlorophyll species in the core of the photosystem and the site of water oxidation in the manganese cluster.

An important aspect of the complex crystallised by Zouni *et al.* [3] is that the water-oxidising centre is intact, as attested to by the observation that the crystals produce oxygen and protons when illuminated [12]. The electron density map includes an intensity-rich ‘Y’ shaped feature located at the luminal side of the D1 subunit, which has been modelled as four manganese atoms (Figure 1). This is an exciting finding, as the structure of the manganese cluster that catalyses oxygen production has been a topic of intense interest for many years, and data reported by Zouni *et al.* [3] will no doubt trigger new work in this area. It is known that oxygen production also involves Ca²⁺ and Cl⁻ ions, but these have not been located in the electron density data.
In the photosystem II reaction centre, the chemical identity of the equivalent photochemical species, termed P680, is a matter of ongoing debate. In the structural information on the photosystem II reaction centre [3,7], the two chlorophylls closest to the lumenal side of the membrane are modelled as being further apart than the equivalent P700 and P870 chlorophylls in the related complexes (see inset to Figure 1). It is likely that the spacing of these chlorophylls, and their position with respect to the neighbouring chlorophylls in the complex, will be of great interest to researchers seeking to explain the biophysical properties of P680. In particular, it should help to explain how photooxidation in the photosystem II reaction centre generates a chlorophyll cation with sufficiently high oxidising power to strip electrons out of water, and so generate molecular oxygen.
