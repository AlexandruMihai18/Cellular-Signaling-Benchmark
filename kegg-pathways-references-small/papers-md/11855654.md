**Abstract** Betanidin 6-O-glucosyltransferase (6-GT) is involved in the glycosylation of betacyanins, which replace the chromogenic anthocyanins as flower colorants in the Caryophyllales. The 6-GT cDNA was cloned from a cDNA library of *Dorotheanthus bellidiformis* (Burm. f.) N.E. Br., and the amino acid and nucleotide sequences were shown to be distinctly different from the corresponding betanidin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT) from the same plant species. Although both enzymes share very similar substrates, the proteins show only 19% amino acid sequence identity. In contrast, the protein sequence of the 6-GT showed significant identity to GTs from other species and may identify a new cluster of putative anthocyanidin GTs. Therefore, 6-GT and 5-GT apparently have evolved independently from ancestral glucosyltransferases involved in flavonoid biosynthesis.

## Introduction

Glycosylation is the most prominent conjugation reaction in plant natural product biosynthesis. This is particularly evident in flavonoid biosynthesis, where up to now a total of 6,000 different glycosides has been described (Harborne and Baxter 1999). Individual glycosides are synthesized by glucosyltransferases (GTs), which transfer nucleotide-diphosphate-activated sugars, in most cases UDP-glucose, to the respective aglycone moieties. These GTs correspond to a multigene family, characterized by a unique sequence motif, the proposed UDP-glucose-binding site (PSPG-box) (Bairoch 1991; Hughes and Hughes 1994). The small genome of *Arabidopsis thaliana* has recently been shown to contain about 110 individual GT sequences, with only very few functionally characterized (Jackson et al. 2001; Lim et al. 2001). Based on sequence identities, all *A. thaliana* GTs may be clustered into 14 distinctive groups (Li et al. 2001). These sequence data can be integrated into clusters of GTs from other plant species, which can be identified based on the substrate and regiospecificities of various heterologously expressed genes (Vogt and Jones 2000).

In the Caryophyllales, the chromogenic anthocyanins have been replaced by functionally equivalent, but biosynthetically different betacyanins. Both classes of pigments are usually glycosylated and mutually exclude each other. In a recent paper we characterized the native and recombinant betanidin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT), which catalyzes the formation of betanin from betanidin (Vogt et al. 1999). Substrate preference and regioselectivity of 5-GT is reflected in amino acid sequence data, with surprisingly high identity to stress-inducible flavonoid and coumarin GTs from the Solanaceae (Horvath and Chua 1996; Frassinet-Tachet et al. 1998). In this report we present data on cloning of a second gene from *Dorotheanthus bellidiformis* (Livingstone daisy; Aizoaceae), encoding a betanidin 6-O-glucosyltransferase (6-GT). The specificity of the 6-GT towards individual hydroxy groups of flavonols and anthocyanidins (Fig. 1), again emphasizes regioselectivity rather than substrate specificity as the key to understanding the organization and the phylogeny of the members of the GT-multigene family. These data also may present the first evidence that anthocyanidin glycosylation is an old phylogenetic feature and may have evolved several times independently during evolution.

Materials and methods

Two degenerate primers were synthesized. The forward primer 5′-CCNACNCCNGGNATGGGCCA-3′ corresponded to a short stretch (PTPGMGH) of the 31-amino-acid N-terminal sequence of the native 6-GT protein (Vogt et al. 1997). The reverse primer 5′-ACNGCNACYTGNNGNGCCA-3′ was based on one conserved part of the plant secondary product glucosyltransferase (“PSPG”) consensus sequence (Hughes and Hughes 1994). Isolation of total RNA from *Dorotheanthus bellidiformis* cell-suspension cultures, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and screening of a λ-Zap cDNA library (Stratagene) were essentially as described previously (Vogt et al. 1999). PCR was performed with an annealing temperature of 52 °C and a resulting 950-bp fragment was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was compared with the databases using “Blast” algorithms (Altschul et al. 1990) and the presence of the corresponding RNA in *D.* *bellidiformis* plants was verified by northern blot analysis. From 600,000 plaque-forming units (pfu), two positive clones were picked and the longest (full length) clone sequenced by primer walking in both directions and compared with the databases. Computational analysis of the 6-GT sequence data and multiple sequence alignments were performed with the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR). The sequence has been deposited as accession number AF374004 in GenBank. For heterologous expression, the 6-GT open reading frame was amplified by PCR with Pfu-Polymerase (Promega) and cloned into the following expression vectors: pQE 30-32 and pET1blue (Qiagen and Novagen, respectively) for expression in *Escherichia coli*; pYES2 (Invitrogen) for expression in yeast; and pFastBac 1 (Gibco-BRL) for expression in the baculovirus/insect cell culture system.

ride (PVDF) membrane and partial sequencing (Vogt et al. 1997). Initial attempts to clone the corresponding gene by an homology approach with the 5-GT were unsuccessful due to less than 15% identity on the nucleotide-sequence level. Based on primers designed from N-terminal sequence data and the conserved PSPG-box (Hughes and Hughes 1994) a partial sequence of the 6-GT was obtained and used to screen a cDNA library. A full-length clone of 1,920 bp with an open reading frame of 1,446 bp was obtained. This corresponded to a protein of 482 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 53.7 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.0. There are no apparent glycosylation or phosphorylation sites. No signal sequence was detected by the program Signal P (Nielsen et al. 1997). The data are in agreement with earlier results from the native plant enzyme (Vogt et al. 1997). All 31 amino acids from the sequenced protein were identical to the deduced sequence of the cloned 6-GT cDNA, including the N-terminal methionine. These data corroborated our assumption that a full-length 6-GT cDNA clone was indeed obtained. Attempts to express the 6-GT cDNA in *E. coli*, in yeast or in a baculovirus/insect cell culture system have failed up to now. In no case was any enzyme activity obtained and no putative 6-GT protein was detectable by SDS-PAGE. High, constitutive transcript levels of the 6-GT were detected in cell cultures probed with a specific 6-GT fragment, whereas the transcript was hardly detectable in red-to-purple flowers of intact *D.* *bellidiformis* plants (Fig. 2).

Results and discussion

Cloning and expression of the 6-GT cDNA

The 6-GT was purified by a combination of anion-exchange and dye-ligand chromatography from cell cultures of *D.* *bellidiformis*. 31 N-terminal amino acids were determined after blotting onto a polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) membrane and partial sequencing (Vogt et al. 1997). Initial attempts to clone the corresponding gene by an homology approach with the 5-GT were unsuccessful due to less than 15% identity on the nucleotide-sequence level. Based on primers designed from N-terminal sequence data and the conserved PSPG-box (Hughes and Hughes 1994) a partial sequence of the 6-GT was obtained and used to screen a cDNA library. A full-length clone of 1,920 bp with an open reading frame of 1,446 bp was obtained. This corresponded to a protein of 482 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 53.7 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.0. There are no apparent glycosylation or phosphorylation sites. No signal sequence was detected by the program Signal P (Nielsen et al. 1997). The data are in agreement with earlier results from the native plant enzyme (Vogt et al. 1997). All 31 amino acids from the sequenced protein were identical to the deduced sequence of the cloned 6-GT cDNA, including the N-terminal methionine. These data corroborated our assumption that a full-length 6-GT cDNA clone was indeed obtained. Attempts to express the 6-GT cDNA in *E. coli*, in yeast or in a baculovirus/insect cell culture system have failed up to now. In no case was any enzyme activity obtained and no putative 6-GT protein was detectable by SDS-PAGE. High, constitutive transcript levels of the 6-GT were detected in cell cultures probed with a specific 6-GT fragment, whereas the transcript was hardly detectable in red-to-purple flowers of intact *D.* *bellidiformis* plants (Fig. 2).

Sequence analysis of the 6-GT

Surprisingly, the 6-GT nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed only 19% identity to the 5-GT cloned from the same plant species. Albeit both enzymes use the same substrates and the only difference is the specific transfer of the glucose moiety to one or the other of the vicinal hydroxy groups of the substrate, neither the reaction mechanisms (Vogt et al. 1997) nor the sequence data are similar. This is in contrast to examples from the literature, where similar or identical substrate specificity results in a very similar amino acid sequence or even closely identical protein structure. Recent examples from plants include tropinone reductase (Nakajima et al. 1999) or the polyketide synthase family (Ferrer et al. 1999). On the other hand, the example of the crystal

expressed gentian anthocyanidin 3-GT from the same genus (Tanaka et al. 1996). Both reports are in agreement with the presence of acylated 3-O- and 5-O-glycosylated delphinidin derivatives in blue gentian flowers (Hosokawa et al. 1997). Neither the CGT1 protein from leaflets of cassava (Hughes and Hughes 1994) nor three deduced protein sequences from *A. thaliana* have been characterized on the substrate level. If the corresponding genes, in addition to the 6-GT, also represent cyanidin- and flavonol GTs, they define a new phylogenetic branch of sequences that is distinctly different from the functionally characterized clusters of anthocyanidin 3-GTs and anthocyanin 5-GTs (Vogt and Jones 2000; Li et al. 2001). Therefore, the evolution of these GTs may be classified as poly- or paraphyletic. Based on these sequence data, attempts will be made to assign substrate specificity and transcriptional activity of the 6-GT homologous genes from cassava and *A. thaliana*.

The origin of both betanidin-glucosylating enzymes, 5-GT and 6-GT, from *D. bellidiformis* is truly paraphyletic (Fig. 3). They were recruited at one point to glucosylate betacyanins instead of, or in addition to, anthocyanidins and flavonols. This implies that betacyanin accumulation appeared later in evolution than anthocyanin biosynthesis. In an ongoing debate on the origin of betalain accumulation (Stafford 1994), these and recent molecular data (Vogt et al. 1999) seem to corroborate the assumption of Clement and Mabry (1996) that both classes of pigments may have co-occurred in hypothetical ancestors.

structures of two transferases, the bacteriophage T4 glucosyltransferase and the bacterial N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, indicates that even though enzymes do not share any significant sequence identity their corresponding topology may be very similar (Unligil and Rini 2000).

The 6-GT displays a significant degree of sequence identity to several only tentatively defined GTs from *Gentiana* sp., *Manihot esculenta* and *A. thaliana*. Nearly 50% identity on the amino acid level and a remarkable 90% identity within in the PSPG-box characterize this cluster of closely related proteins from randomly dispersed species within the plant kingdom. This cluster is separated from two other clusters of well-characterized flavonol/anthocyanidin 3-GTs, anthocyanin 5-GTs, and also from the cluster including betanidin 5-GT (Fig. 3). About 50% identity based on amino acid sequence data is observed within individual clusters. However, a sequence comparison of all clusters shows less than 20% overall sequence identity, with only very few amino acids completely conserved, with the exception of the PSPG-box.

The substrate specificity of the 6-GT, besides the natural substrate betanidin, also includes cyanidin and quercetin, glycosylated with high specificity at the 3-OH position of the flavonoid C-ring (Vogt et al. 1997) (Fig. 1). The GT from blue gentian petals is a flavonoid GT, with a poorly described 3,5-OH GT-specificity (Yoshida and Ito 1998) and different from a cloned and
