**Transcriptional regulation through Mediator-like coactivators in yeast and metazoan cells**

**Sohail Malik and Robert G. Roeder**

A novel multiprotein complex has recently been identified as a coactivator for transcriptional control of protein-encoding genes by RNA polymerase II in higher eukaryotic cells. This complex is evolutionarily related to the Mediator complex from yeast and, on the basis of its structural and functional characteristics, promises to be a key target of diverse regulatory circuits.

Modular structure of the Mediator complex. (a) Yeast Mediator has various modules, including a core, that have been identified through genetic and biochemical studies. The core Mediator subunits are further organized into two submodules. The RGR1 submodule (RGR1-MED1-MED2-MED4-MED7-MED8-MED9-CSE2-NUT2

The TRAP complex had been purified several years earlier on the basis of its intracellular association and copurification with ligand
on the basis of specific intrinsic subunits related to yeast Mediator components (SRB10/CDK8 for NAT, SRB7 and MED7 for murine Mediator). Only CRSP and PC2 were first observed as coactivator activities [CRSP for Sp1 (Ref. 28), and PC2 both for a variety of natural activators, including Sp1 (Refs 6,30), and for GAL4-based activators²²] and later identified as Mediator-like complexes.

between these interactions and corresponding activator functions, also implies that contact with the activator is important at some point in the activation pathway. Other examples of activator interactions (DRIP with the vitamin-D receptor, ARC with SREBP and VP16, and SUR2 with EIA) have already been mentioned above. The fact that TRAP/SMCC can be isolated as a complex with liganded TR further suggests a novel pathway in which pre-existing coactivator-activator complexes are brought into contact with the promoter.

Furthermore, although direct physical interactions between TRAP

A model for the activation of transcription through synergistic activator interactions with TRAP/SMCC (and other Mediator-like complexes). The preinitiation complex consisting of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and general transcription factors (yellow) is assembled at the core elements [the TATA box (TATA) and initiator (INR)] of a model promoter. A hypothetical distally located enhancer element (UAS) containing binding sites for the activators p
expression of metazoan genes and has led to a pleasing convergence of disparate coactivator studies. These complexes, like the yeast Mediator to which they are evolutionarily related, display a modular organization and a consequent potential for integrating diverse regulatory signals. However, because many of the subunits in the metazoan complexes are divergent, they could reflect additional metazoan-specific control mechanisms. Therefore, the next challenges are (1) to determine how regulatory signals impinge on the Mediator complexes and are, in turn, relayed to the Pol II machinery in the context of natural genes and (2) to elucidate similarities and differences (
