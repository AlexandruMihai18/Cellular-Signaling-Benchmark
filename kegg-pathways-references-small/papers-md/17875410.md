### Abstract
Osmoregulation is the active control of the cellular water balance and encompasses homeostatic mechanisms crucial for life. The osmoregulatory system in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is particularly well understood. Key to yeast osmoregulation is the production and accumulation of the compatible solute glycerol, which is partly controlled by the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling system. Genetic analyses combined with studies on protein-protein interactions have revealed the wiring scheme of the HOG signaling network, a branched mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) pathway that eventually converges on the MAPK Hog1. Hog1 is activated following cell shrinking and controls posttranscriptional processes in the cytosol as well as gene expression in the nucleus. HOG pathway activity can easily and rapidly be controlled experimentally by extracellular stimuli, and signaling and adaptation can be separated by a system of forced adaptation. This makes yeast osmoregulation suitable for studies on system properties of signaling and cellular adaptation via mathematical modeling. Computational simulations and parallel quantitative time course experimentation on different levels of the regulatory system have provided a stepping stone toward a holistic understanding, revealing how the HOG pathway can combine rigorous feedback control with maintenance of signaling competence. The abundant tools make yeast a suitable model for an integrated analysis of cellular osmoregulation.

Maintenance of the cellular water balance is fundamental for life. All cells, even those in multicellular organisms with an organism-wide osmoregulation, have the ability to actively control their water balance. Osmoregulation encompasses homeostatic processes that maintain an appropriate intracellular environment for biochemical processes as well as turgor of cells and organism. In the laboratory, the osmoregulatory system is studied most conveniently as a response to osmotic shock, causing rapid and dramatic changes in the extracellular water activity. Those rapid changes mediate either water efflux (hyperosmotic shock), and hence cell shrinkage, or influx (hypoosmotic shock), causing cell swelling. The yeast *S. cerevisiae*, as a free-living organism experiencing both slow and rapid changes in extracellular water activity, has proven a suitable and genetically tractable experimental system in studying the underlying signaling pathways and regulatory processes governing osmoregulation. Although far from complete, the present picture of yeast osmoregulation is both extensive and detailed (de Nadal *et al.*, 2002; Hohmann, 2002; Klipp *et al.*, 2005). Simulations using mathematical models combined with time course measurements of different molecular processes in signaling and adaptation have allowed elucidation of the first system properties on the yeast osmoregulatory network.

### 1. TIME LINE: RESPONSE TO OSMOTIC SHOCK

Following a hyperosmotic shock, yeast cells shrink within seconds. Within less than 1 min the glycerol export channel Fps1 closes rapidly to prevent glycerol leakage and enables the accumulation of this compatible solute (Tamás *et al.*, 1999, 2003; Thorsen *et al.*, 2006). Within the same time frame, the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signal transduction system is activated (de Nadal *et al.*, 2002; Hohmann, 2002) (Fig. 2.1). The initial responses mediated by the active Hog1 protein kinase appear to encompass the stimulation of ion export (Proft and Struhl, 2004), arrest of the cell cycle (Clotet *et al.*, 2006; Escote *et al.*, 2004), diminishing of translational capacity (Bilsland *et al.*, 2004; Bilsland-Marchesan *et al.*, 2000; Teige *et al.*, 2001), and stimulation of glycolysis to enhance production of the osmolyte glycerol (Dihazi *et al.*, 2004). A significant portion of active Hog1 accumulates in the nucleus where it is recruited to target promoters to control gene expression (O’Rourke and Herskowitz, 2004; Pokholok *et al.*, 2006; Posas *et al.*, 2000; Rep *et al.*, 2000). Genes encoding enzymes in glycerol production and active glycerol uptake are among those upregulated in a Hog1-dependent manner, but the bulk of the transcriptional change seems to revolve around metabolism and is similar to that caused by other stresses (Causton *et al.*, 2001; Gasch *et al.*, 2000). Adaptation depends on glycerol accumulation, and once the intracellular glycerol level has reached about one-third of its maximum, Hog1 is dephosphorylated and gene expression responses attenuate (Hohmann, 2002; Klipp *et al.*, 2005).

Figure 2.1 The yeast HOG pathway signaling system and overview of response mechanisms. The pathway consists of two branches: the Sho1 branch (Cdc42/24: G protein, Ste20: PAK protein kinase, Opy2, Sho1: membrane protein scaffold, Ste11/Ste50: MAPKKK, Pbs2: MAPKK) and the Sln1 branch (with Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1: sensing histidine kinase phosphorelay system, Ssk2/22: MAPKKK), Hog1: MAPK, Ptc1, Ptp2/3: protein phosphatases, TF: transcription factor.

Less is known about the time line of the response to a hypoosmotic shock. Cell volume increases rapidly following such treatment. The Fps1 glycerol export channel opens to allow glycerol release; this process is essential for survival (Luyten et al., 1995; Tamás et al., 1999). In addition, the cell integrity pathway with its mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Slt2 is activated rapidly and transiently (Davenport et al., 1995). Active Slt2 kinase stimulates the transcription of genes encoding proteins required for cell wall assembly, which may be important to adapt to the new conditions (Jung and Levin, 1999).

### 2. GLYCEROL METABOLISM AND THE AQUAGLYCEROPORIN FPS1

During growth on glucose as a carbon source, glycerol for osmoadaptation is produced via a short branch of glycolysis consisting of two enzymatic steps (Ansell et al., 1997; Norbeck et al., 1996). The yeast genome encodes two isoforms for both steps: Gpd1 and Gpd2 for glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and Gpp1 and Gpp2 for glycerol-3-phosphatase.

Elimination of glycerol production by gene knockout causes an inability of yeast cells to grow in growth medium with more than about 0.3 M NaCl. The expression of *GPD1*, *GPP2*, and, to a lesser extent, *GPP1* is stimulated by hyperosmotic shock (Albertyn et al., 1994; Rep et al., 2000) (Fig. 2.2). However, the observed glycerol accumulation immediately after osmotic shock is probably mainly because of stimulated metabolic flux and prevention of glycerol efflux. The yeast plasma membrane is rather impermeable for glycerol (Karlgren et al., 2005; Oliveira et al., 2003) and hence a gated glycerol export channel allows yeast cells to rapidly control and fine-tune their glycerol content. This role is taken by the aquaglyceroporin Fps1. These type of proteins are characterized by six transmembrane domains and two loops, B and E, that dip into the membrane from both sides, essentially forming a seventh transmembrane domain. Mutants lacking Fps1 display a higher intracellular glycerol level (Tao et al., 1999) but accumulate glycerol with a similar profile as wild-type cells under hyperosmotic conditions (Tamás et al., 1999). However, such *fps1Δ* mutants poorly survive a hypoosmotic shock, that is, when yeast cells are transferred into distilled water.

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Figure 2.2 The HOG pathway controls water and glycerol homeostasis. At the level of gene expression the capacity for glycerol uptake and production are increased by Hog1. Hog1 also appears to stimulate glycolytic flux by activating Pfk26 to produce fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. Finally, Hog1 may participate in the control of the glycerol efflux channel Fps1.
Under such conditions most of the intracellular glycerol is released to the surrounding medium within less than 3 min in an Fps1-dependent manner (Tamás *et al.*, 1999). Only a fraction of $fps1\Delta$ mutants cells survive such a treatment (Tamás *et al.*, 1999), illustrating the role of Fps1 as an osmotic safety valve.

Constitutively open Fps1 mutants exist, which mediate glycerol export even under hyperosmotic conditions. As a consequence, yeast cells that express them are unable to accumulate glycerol, which they try to compensate by enhanced glycerol production (Hedfalk *et al.*, 2004; Karlgren *et al.*, 2004; Tamás *et al.*, 1999, 2003). Mutants expressing constitutively open Fps1 grow more poorly under hyperosmotic conditions. Hence, mutants lacking Fps1 are hypoosmosensitive, whereas mutants with overactive Fps1 are hyperosmosensitive, again illustrating the importance of Fps1 for yeast osmoregulation. While proteins with similar functions in regulated osmolyte export are likely to exist in most organisms, the precise type of aquaglyceroporin represented by S. *cerevisiae* Fps1 appears to be specific to yeasts (Pettersson *et al.*, 2005).

The control mechanism of Fps1 has been investigated by targeted and random mutagenesis. It appears that three regions play a role in Fps1 gating: the B loop (Karlgren *et al.*, 2004), the region of about 40 amino acids proximal to the first transmembrane domain (Karlgren *et al.*, 2004; Tamás *et al.*, 1999, 2003), and the 10 amino acids immediately distal to the sixth transmembrane domain (Hedfalk *et al.*, 2004; Karlgren *et al.*, 2004). All these elements are highly conserved in Fps1 orthologues from other yeasts.

### 3. THE HOG SIGNALING SYSTEM

The HOG pathway (Fig. 2.1) is one of the best understood and most intensively studied MAPK systems. First, components (Hog1 and Pbs2) were identified in a genetic screen for osmosensitive mutants deficient in glycerol accumulation (Brewster *et al.*, 1993). In parallel, inactivation of SLN1, encoding the single yeast sensor histidine kinase, was found to be lethal (Ota and Varshavsky, 1993). This lethality, which was later shown to be because of inappropriate overactivation of the Hog1 kinase, was suppressed by knockout of any of the genes SSK1, SSK2, PBS2, and HOG1, thereby defining a linear pathway from Sln1 to Hog1. In addition, overexpression of PTC1, PTP2, or PTP3 suppressed lethality of the sln1$\Delta$ mutant, defining those as negative elements of the pathway (Maeda *et al.*, 1994; Posas and Saito, 1997; Posas *et al.*, 1996). Finally, the observation that ssk1$\Delta$ as well as ssk2$\Delta$ ssk22$\Delta$ mutants were osmotolerant while deletion of PBS2 and HOG1 caused osmosensitivity prompted genetic screens employing
synthetic enhancement that identified SHO1, STE20, and STE11 as encoding components of the Sho1 branch (Maeda *et al.*, 1995). Identification of the pathway components and characterization of their order of function represent textbook examples of the power of both targeted and global yeast genetics approaches. In fact, forward genetics, suppressor mutation, multicopy suppression, synthetic enhancement, epistasis analysis, and yeast two hybrid screens were all employed in this context. Particular powerful genetic tools are mutations that activate signaling constitutively. Significant knowledge has emerged on the flow of information through the pathway and hence the mechanisms of signal transduction by combining the genetic tools with *in vitro* and *in vivo* protein interaction assays, as well as *in vitro* protein kinase assays (de Nadal *et al.*, 2002; Hohmann, 2002; O’Rourke *et al.*, 2002; Saito and Tatebayashi, 2004; Tatebayashi *et al.*, 2006).

The HOG signaling system consists of two branches that converge on the MAPKK Pbs2, the Sln1, and the Sho1. Components of the Sho1 branch also take part in pseudohyphal development and mating in *S. cerevisiae* (O’Rourke and Herskowitz, 1998). In many fungi, it appears that the Sho1 module is not connected to Pbs2 and hence is not involved in osmotic responses (Furukawa *et al.*, 2005; Krantz *et al.*, 2006). This indicates that the Sho1 module might not primarily have a role in osmosensing but rather perceives signals related to cell shape and/or cell surface conditions, in accordance with the role in activation played by the cell polarity machinery. Sho1 is specifically located at sites of cell growth and does not appear to sense turgor changes (Reiser *et al.*, 2000, 2003).

The Sho1 branch consists almost exclusively of proteins shared with the pseudohyphal development pathway and the pheromone response pathway. Signaling specificity seems to be assured by recruitment to scaffold proteins (Sho1, Opy2, Pbs2) and requires the Hog1 kinase. In *hog1Δ* mutants, exposure to osmotic stress causes activation of the pseudohyphal and pheromone response pathways and morphological aberrations (Davenport *et al.*, 1999; O’Rourke and Herskowitz, 1998; Rep *et al.*, 2000). The mechanism by which Hog1 prevents such cross talk has not yet been elucidated. Mechanisms involved in activation of the Sho1 branch following osmotic shock have been described in detail using constitutively active Ste11 and Sho1 mutants as well as protein interaction studies (Tatebayashi *et al.*, 2006). As indicated earlier, the sensing mechanism of osmotic changes in the Sho1 branch is not understood at this point but must be closely related to Sho1 (Tatebayashi *et al.*, 2006). The observation that Sho1 can be replaced by engineered proteins that recruit Pbs2 to the plasma membrane suggests that Sho1 does not function as a sensor itself (Raitt *et al.*, 2000). Sho1 shows much less variation in size than in primary sequence (Krantz and Hohmann, 2006), indicating a structural rather than an enzymatic function.

Sln1 is a sensor histidine kinase related to bacterial two-component systems. Such proteins are widespread in fungi and plants (Catlett *et al.*, 2003).
Sln1 has a similar domain organization as the bacterial osmosensing histidine kinase EnvZ. Both proteins have two transmembrane domains at their N terminus, which are connected by a large extracellular loop, about 300 amino acids in yeasts. It is believed that the extracellular loop and the transmembrane domains sense turgor changes (Reiser et al., 2003), perhaps by responding to movements of the plasma membrane relative to the cell wall. The homodimer is likely regulated by a structural change, which is propagated from the extracellular sensing domain to the intracellular histidine kinase domain of Sln1 (Posas et al., 1996; Reiser et al., 2003). In *S. cerevisiae* the Sln1 histidine kinase is a negative regulator of the downstream MAPK cascade; deletion of *SLN1* or inactivation of the kinase results in lethal Hog1 overactivation (Maeda et al., 1994). When active (i.e., under ambient conditions), the Sln1 histidine kinase cross-phosphorylates within a dimer (Posas et al., 1996), and the phosphate group is transferred via the Sln1 receiver and response regulator domains as well as the Ypd1 phosphotransfer protein to the Ssk1 response regulator protein. Hyperosmotic shock causes inactivation of Sln1 kinase activity and dephosphorylation of Ssk1. This scenario is well supported by mutational analysis of all steps in the phosphorelay system (Posas et al., 1996). Unphosphorylated Ssk1 mediates activation of the redundant MAPKKKKs Ssk2 and Ssk22, which in turn activate Pbs2.

The activity and the relative contribution of the two pathway branches to Hog1 kinase activity are usually measured in mutants that are blocked in either branch (Maeda et al., 1995; O’Rourke and Herskowitz, 2004). Whether such experiments reflect activity of the two branches in wild-type cells is presently unknown. It appears that the Sho1 branch has a higher stress threshold for activation (Maeda et al., 1995; O’Rourke and Herskowitz, 2004) and that it is insufficient to mediate maximal pathway activation alone (unpublished data).

### 4. TRANSCRIPTIONAL RESPONSES

Several studies have reported global gene expression analyses employing different types of microarrays following a hyperosmotic shock of different intensity (Causton et al., 2001; Gasch et al., 2000; Posas et al., 2000; Rep et al., 2000; Yale and Bohnert, 2001). The reported number of genes up- or downregulated following a hyperosmotic shock varies between studies because of different growth conditions and thresholds applied in the analyses. It appears that about 200 to 400 genes are upregulated and that some 150 to 250 genes are downregulated. Some important conclusions from these analyses are as follows (Hohmann, 2002).1. The response is transient. Most genes are up- or downregulated only for a certain period of time, which depends on the strength of the osmotic treatment from a few minutes to more than 1 h.
2. The response is largely general. Essentially all genes showing robust up- or downregulation following osmotic shock are affected in a similar way by a range of different stress conditions. This general stress response is regulated negatively by protein kinase A.
3. Downregulated genes encode proteins related to growth and biomass formation. In fact, most of those genes encode ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and glycolytic enzymes. Those genes are regulated positively by protein kinase A.
4. Upregulated genes are not necessary for osmotolerance. There is essentially no overlap between the set genes whose expression is upregulated by osmotic shock and those whose knockout affects growth in high osmolarity conditions (Warringer *et al.*, 2003). Probably, genes encoding functions required to sense and respond to stress need to be present at all times and hence may not be stress regulated. Many proteins whose production is upregulated may rather be relevant for sustaining an osmotolerant state and their deletion may not cause a strong phenotype. In addition, several upregulated genes, such as those encoding enzymes in glycerol production, are duplicated and only one copy is stress controlled. Its deletion is, at least partly, compensated by the presence of the second isoform.
5. Hog1 is required only for a fraction of the observed transcriptional response. The osmostress-induced upregulation of only about 20% of the genes is fully or largely Hog1 dependent. However, those typically include the most strongly osmoregulated genes.

Several transcription factors seem to be involved in Hog1-dependent responses: Hot1, Sko1, Msn2/Msn4, Msn1, and Smp1 (Fig. 2.3). The first four of those are best characterized and also seem to play the most significant roles.

Hot1 (Alepuz *et al.*, 2003; Rep *et al.*, 1999, 2000) is a nuclear protein that seems to control a set of less than 10 genes, including those that encode proteins in glycerol metabolism and uptake. Hot1 recruits Hog1 to target promoters.

Sko1 binds to cAMP response element sites in targets promoters, although not all of the about 40 target genes seem to contain such a site (Proft and Struhl, 2002; Proft *et al.*, 2001, 2005; Rep *et al.*, 2001). Active Hog1 converts Sko1 from a repressor to an activator (Proft and Struhl, 2002; Rep *et al.*, 2001). It appears that Sko1 controls the expression of several regulators of the osmoreponse systems, such as the Msn2 transcription factor and the Ptp3 protein phosphatase (Proft *et al.*, 2005). Hence, Sko1 may be central to a transcriptional network important for establishing the adapted state in osmoregulation.

Figure 2.3 Hog1 and control of gene expression. Hog1 interacts with different transcription factors in the nucleus, such as Sko1, Hot1, and probably also Smpl, to control different sets of genes (some typical examples are shown). It appears that Hog1 thereby itself is the activating factor.

Msn2 and Msn4 are two redundant proteins mediating a general stress response (Ruis and Schüller, 1995). Msn2/Msn4 nuclear localization is negatively controlled by protein kinase A. Although Msn2/Msn4 is required for transcriptional responses to a range of stress conditions, stimulation of its targets under osmotic stress requires the Hog1 kinase (Rep et al., 2000).

It appears that the Hog1 kinase itself is the activating transcription factor for its targets. Hog1 is recruited to target promoters by Hot1, Sko1, and Msn2/Msn4 (Alepuz et al., 2001, 2003; De Nadal et al., 2004; Pokholok et al., 2006; Proft and Struhl, 2002). Hog1 is not only required for initiating transcription of target genes, but also for the transcriptional elongation step (Pokholok et al., 2006; Proft et al., 2006). Hence, the perspective of how a protein kinase controls gene expression has changed substantially through studies on the Hog1 MAPK. Rather than phosphorylating and thereby (in) activating a DNA-binding transcription factor, Hog1 (and also other kinases [Pokholok et al., 2006]) associates with DNA-binding proteins to mediate gene-specific control of transcription via general components of the gene regulation machinery.

### 5. STUDYING THE CONTROL OF SIGNALING

The response of yeast cells to a hyperosmotic shock is transient (Fig. 2.4). Hence, HOG pathway activation is controlled by feedback mechanisms that ensure that the pathway is inactivated during adaptation.

Figure 2.4 Osmotic responses are transient. An example of quantification of the level of phospho-Hog1 and the mRNA of the Hog1-target gene GPD1 is shown. Cells were treated with 0.5 M NaCl at time 0.

This means that the observed, strong HOG pathway activation following a hyperosmotic shock mainly serves to trigger the adaptation process but that maintenance of the adapted state is supported either by a much smaller level of active Hog1 or by entirely different mechanisms.

The yeast osmosensing HOG system controls a homeostatic process and hence needs to remain in a signaling-competent state at all times. Indeed, the HOG pathway, and HOG-dependent gene expression, can be reactivated readily with essentially the same time course and amplitude by a second osmotic shock at different times following a first shock (Klipp et al., 2005). Hence, mechanisms that control signaling through the HOG pathway combine feedback with maintenance of signaling competence. This property is shared by both branches of the HOG pathway when they control Hog1 activation individually (unpublished data).

In order to better understand the dynamics of osmoregulation and signaling we study how several biological processes can be integrated into one system. To do quantitative time-resolving measurements of biomolecules, such as phosphorylated Hog1, mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites provide insight into the causal and temporal relationships between different biological events. Based on biochemical knowledge of the system and quantitative biological data, a mathematical reconstruction of the system was undertaken in order to be able to simulate and address specific biological questions, such as the mechanism underlying feedback control and maintenance of signaling competence (Klipp et al., 2005).

In its present state, the model encompasses sensing through the Sln1 phosphorelay system, signaling through the MAPK cascade, gene and protein expression for glycerol production, and glycolytic metabolism, including glycerol production and regulated export through Fps1, as well as changes in cell volume and turgor. These items were initially set up as modules on the basis of literature and large-scale genomics data and were

tested individually before they were connected to an overall model of 35 differential equations and 70 parameters. Some of the parameters were calculated on the basis of standard experiments (osmotic shock with 0.5 M NaCl) and time course data on relative levels of phosphorylated Hog1, levels of mRNA of HOG target genes, and specific activity of an enzyme in glycerol production, as well as the levels of intracellular and total glycerol. Other parameters were calculated and optimized to best fit experimental data. The model was then tested and improved iteratively using additional experimental data from perturbations such as different types of stress treatments or genetic changes, including inability to accumulate glycerol. Furthermore, the model will be used to test specific hypothesis and will serve as a guideline of what types of experimental data should be generated in order to increase our knowledge of osmoregulation and signaling in yeast.

Like any other MAPK signaling pathway, the HOG pathway is controlled negatively by protein phosphatases (Fig. 2.5). Three phosphatases are physiologically relevant: Ptp2, a nuclear phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase; Ptp3, a cytosolic phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase; and Ptc1, a type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) located in both the cytosol and the nucleus. Simultaneous knockout of *PTP2* and *PTC1* is lethal because of overactive Hog1 (Maeda et al., 1993), demonstrating that the phosphatases are needed to control noise and thresholds of signaling.

Simulations (Klipp et al., 2005) were used to test if Hog1-mediated upregulation of protein phosphatases could account for the observed feedback control on the Hog1 phosphorylation status. Although it could possibly account for the observed downregulation, it is incompatible with the ability of the HOG pathway to maintain signaling competence. In osmostressed yeast

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Figure 2.5 Feedback of the osmotic response. Osmotic adaptation, i.e., turgor recovery, seems to determine the time point when HOG signaling is downregulated. The onset of cell reswelling probably terminates initial stimuli. Then, protein phosphatases deactivate the pathway. Upregulation of those phosphatases, indicated here as a transcriptional feedback loop, may play a role in adaptation or, rather, contribute to establish a new steady state in adapted cells.
cells, it appears that the timing of downregulation is determined by adaptation, that is, recovery of volume and turgor, which in turn is mediated by glycerol accumulation (Fig. 2.5). This scenario directly implies that the sensors of the HOG pathway detect an osmotic change rather than an osmotic status. In this picture, the phosphatases act constitutively and keep the phosphorylation state of Hog1 dependent on sensor activity. The roles of the phosphatases are to adjust the dynamic range, control noise, and determine signaling thresholds of the entire signaling system depending on environmental requirements.

Several experimental scenarios support the idea that the Hog1 phosphorylation state is mainly controlled by the osmotic changes caused by external stimuli or cellular adaptation rather than intrinsic feedback mechanisms. First, mutations that prevent glycerol production ($gpd1\Delta$ $gpd2\Delta$) or that delay glycerol accumulation despite glycerol overproduction (constitutively open Fps1) cause sustained Hog1 phosphorylation ([Klipp et al., 2005; Siderius et al., 2000]). Such cells do not adapt to increased osmolarity or only with a significant delay. Second, cells that accumulate glycerol faster display a shorter period of Hog1 phosphorylation ([Krantz et al., 2004]). Such faster glycerol accumulation can be achieved by treating cells growing under anaerobic conditions (the rate of glycerol production is higher in such cells) or by overexpressing $GPD1$ from a multicopy plasmid. Third, it is well known that yeast cells treated with an osmotic shock of higher intensity display a longer period of Hog1 phosphorylation than cells treated with lower stress levels ([Van Wuytswinkel et al., 2000]). Finally, there is a clear correlation between the apparent period of osmotic adaptation and Hog1 phosphorylation ([Karlgren et al., 2005]) in an experimental setup of forced adaptation (or conditional osmotic stress). This experimental setup makes use of yeast cells unable to produce any glycerol ($gpd1\Delta$ $gpd2\Delta$) and hence unable to adapt to increased osmolarity. Even treatments with glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol prevent cell growth and sustained activation of the HOG pathway because of rapid closing of the Fps1 glycerol channel, which is independent of the osmoticum employed. Under these conditions, such mutant cells can be rescued when transformed with a plasmid that expresses a constitutively open Fps1. Initially these cells shrink, but the polyols equilibrate over the plasma membrane via the aquaglyceroporin, with a rate decreasing from glycerol to sorbitol, such that they relieve the osmotic stress at different rates. Consequently, the period of Hog1 phosphorylation is shortest with glycerol, longer with xylitol, and longest with sorbitol ([Karlgren et al., 2005]), demonstrating a clear link between osmotic adaptation and the period of Hog1 phosphorylation/activity. This experimental setup employing constitutively open Fps1 and heterologous aquaglyceroporin (such as rat AQP9), as well as different polyols, allows different periods of osmotic adaptation independent of the initial stress level, providing an experimental tool to separate the two. An additional advantage of the system is that cells adapt independently of their own activity. Hence, this setup allows addressing a range of questions on osmosensing feedback control and the
consequences of different periods of Hog1 activity, for instance on the global gene expression profile.

By controlling the osmotic response and the timing of its downregulation mainly via actual osmotic adaptation, probably via the activity of the sensors, the cell combines effective feedback control with signaling competence, as required for a homeostatic process. However, there are clearly additional mechanisms that impinge on HOG pathway activity and feedback control. Ssk1 in the Sln1 pathway is destabilized in osmostressed cells and this mechanism may contribute to pathway downregulation, although it has to take into account maintenance of signaling competence (Sato *et al.*, 2003). Moreover, Ste11 in the Sho1 pathway is an unstable protein and is degraded at least during the pheromone response (Esch and Errede, 2002).

### 6. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Quantitative analyses and combination of modeling and experimentation will provide new insights into the mechanisms of osmotic homeostasis. For instance, the contribution of the two HOG pathway branches to signaling has so far only been studied in mutants blocked in one branch, which may give an incorrect impression of their roles in wild-type cells. Monitoring the activity of different proteins in the two branches by more sophisticated experimental setups in combination with modeling may help elucidate the precise role of the Sln1 and Sho1 branches in the overall response. Another interesting question concerns the quantitative and temporal contributions of different control mechanisms in glycerol accumulation: Fps1 closure and control of glycolytic flux, as well as upregulation of enzymes in glycerol production and uptake (Fig. 2.2). Finally, most measurements done so far monitor osmotic responses in cell populations. Such response profiles may give a misleading impression, as they could be composed of single cell responses that follow a very different profile. Such single cell measurements are feasible using specific fluorescent reporters combined with flow cytometry or time-lapse microscopy combined with microfluidics and optical manipulations tools. Hence, systems level understanding of cell responses, such as analysis of thresholds, noise regulation, and feedback control, requires acquisition of a new type of data and hence encompasses both computational and experimental challenges.
