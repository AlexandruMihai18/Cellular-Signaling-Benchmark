**Abstract—** The flagellum of a bacterium is a supramolecular structure of extreme complexity comprising simultaneously both a unique system of protein transport and a molecular machine that enables the bacterial cell movement. The cascade of expression of genes encoding flagellar components is closely coordinated with the steps of molecular machine assembly, constituting an amazing regulatory system. Data on structure, assembly, and regulation of flagellar gene expression are summarized in this review. The regulatory mechanisms and correlation of the process of regulation of gene expression and flagellum assembly known from the literature are described.

**Key words:** flagella, motility, bacteria, molecular machine, transcriptional control  

Bacterial motility is enabled by rotation of a lash-like appendage in the bacterium—the flagellum [1]. In many bacteria such as the most studied Gram-negative bacteria *Escherichia coli* and its close relative *Salmonella typhimurium* that are popular objects for investigating motility, the availability of a flagellum is not obligatory, and transition is possible between motile and non-motile forms. Flagellum-less bacteria replace motile strains rather rapidly (within 10 days) in a well-agitated medium due to economy of resources required for construction and functioning of flagella. The growth rate of flagellar forms of bacteria is approximately 2% lower than that for non-motile forms [2]. Nevertheless, under conditions when a bacterium is forced to search for nutrient sources or to avoid toxic compounds, motility provides a substantial advantage. It is obvious that the expression of motility genes is regulated at practically all levels: transcription, translation, and transport. This is important not only to regulate the presence or absence of flagellum, but also to coordinate rigidly the time and level of expression of genes encoding components of this complex molecular motor.

From five to ten flagella are present on average in a cell of such bacteria as *E. coli* or *S. typhimurium*; they are located randomly on the cell surface. Each flagellum (Fig. 1) consists of a basal body, a long external filament made of flagellin protein, and a “hook” connecting these two parts [3]. The flagellum is set in rotation and energy for this is provided by transmembrane potential [4]. In addition to motor function, the flagellum exhibits transport function that is used during self-assembly [5]. Transport of proteins comprising the extracellular part of the flagellum occurs via the central shaft of this structure [6]. Energy conserved in the form of transmembrane potential is also used to facilitate transport. It must be mentioned that some pathogenic bacteria have a supramolecular structure similar to flagellum that is used not for movement, but for injection of toxins into epithelial cells of the host organism.

More than 60 different proteins are involved in assembly and functioning of a flagellum [7]. The basal part of the flagellum is most complex (Fig. 1). Part of it consists of rings, with each ring embedded into a certain layer of the cell wall or inner and outer membranes of the bacterial cell [7]. The rings form “bearings” with a hollow rod rotating within them. The C-ring forms a “cup” from a cytoplasmic side, the MS-ring penetrates the inner membrane, the P-ring penetrates the cell wall, and the L-ring is in the outer membrane [8]. The motor complex located in the periplasm and embedded into the inner membrane rotates the “shaft”, setting in motion the outer semi-rigid helical protein filament [4, 9]. Because of this, the bacterial cell is capable of exhibiting very high speed—100 μm/s, which is more than 50 cell lengths per second.

caps the hollow rod consisting of FlgG and penetrating the peptidoglycan layer. Hence, this cap serves as a sort of “drill” of the cell wall in front of the growing end of the flagellum (Fig. 2a). The hook has its own cap consisting of FlgD protein [10] (Fig. 2, c and d). These intermediate cap proteins are absent in the assembled flagellum (Fig. 1). The cap made from FliD interacting with flagellin [15] closes the distal end of the mature flagellum. Its role involves regulation of addition of the flagellin synthesized in the cell to the end of the flagellum and protection from addition of exogenous flagellin from the medium. During all stages of flagellum assembly, the growing end of the flagellum is the one that is farthest from the cell rather than the closest. Mutants with inactivated *fliD* gene are non-motile due to the loss of the flagellar filament, and the flagellin molecules from such mutant are released into the culture medium [16]. Unlike the protein components of the flagellum transported through the hollow rod itself, the components of external rings are transported via the Sec-dependent transport system [17].

The system of substrate selection for transport is located at the cytoplasmic side of flagellum; it consists of FlhA and FlhB proteins (Fig. 1) together with ATPase complex consisting of proteins FliH, FliI, and FliJ [10]. ATP hydrolysis is needed not for transport, but for selective delivery of transported substrates to the flagellum base and probably for their partial unfolding [10, 18]. The transport substrates are delivered to the flagellum only as a complex with one of the several specific transport chaperons (Fig. 1), each of which exhibits regulatory in addition to transport function. The transported protein connected with the chaperon interacts with FliI subunit of the ATPase complex and in such way is delivered to the FliM/FliN components of the cytoplasmic C-ring. The FliJ component of ATPase interacts with chaperons without “load” and thus prevents binding of transport substrates that were delivered to the base of the hollow rod [18].

### FLAGELLUM ASSEMBLY

The flagellum assembly proceeds sequentially starting from the cytoplasmic parts and ending with the distal ones. The correct sequence of assembly is enabled both by regulation of expression of flagellum component genes and posttranslational changes of the protein structure of the organelle (Fig. 2). The main problem is in ensuring strict sequence of component transport through the inner channel of the flagellum. The components of the hollow rod (FlgG) must be transported first, followed by the hook (FlgE) and connecting layers FlgK and FlgL, and finally flagellin (FliC) must be transported (Fig. 2). Prior to the transport of each tube component, its cap must be transported, namely FlgJ prior to FlgG, FlgD prior to

FlgE, and FliD prior to FliC. Regulation of the transport by conformational and/or covalent changes of the flagellum itself provides an advantage over regulation of gene expression by allowing simultaneous coordination of construction of several flagella, each at its own stage of assembly.

The mechanism of the transport switch from early to late substrates occurring when the length of the hook reaches 55 nm is the most studied [10]. This switch arrests transport of FlgE among other things and allows transport of the important regulatory protein FlgM and other late substrates such as FliC [19], and it is irreversible [20]. The molecular basis for this switch is the autoproteolysis of the FlhB protein (Fig. 2d) [10, 17, 21]. Mutants with disrupted switch [22, 23] synthesize longer hooks that in some cases completely lack the outer flagellin part of the flagellum. In addition to FlhB mutations that hinder proteolysis, mutations inactivating the *fliK* gene also result in an elongated hook [24]. The FliK protein has an elongated form [25] and is exported through the flagellar export system as its early substrate *fliK* [26]. The N-domain of FliK interacts with the FlgD protein, forming a cap during the hook assembly (Fig. 2, c and d). The C-domain of FliK interacts with FlhB, stimulating autoproteolysis of the latter (Fig. 2d). One of the most plausible models of the function of FliK is that it serves as a sort of ruler measuring the distance from the cap, i.e., end of the hook to the base of the basal body FlhB (Fig. 2, c and d). When the C-domain of FliK is positioned exactly opposite to FlhB, autoproteolysis of FlhB occurs. As a result, the early substrates are not transported, while the late ones begin to be transported (Fig. 2e) [10]. This mechanism, while being demonstrated for regulation of the *Yersinia enterocolitica* needle [27], is only suggested for *E. coli* and *S. typhimurium*.

The system of flagellar export specificity switch by FliK was found to be not unique. In addition to successful hook assembly, the cell must control assembly of the external P- and L-rings, the components that are exported via the Sec-dependent mechanism rather than the flagellar mechanism [17]. If assembly of these rings is disrupted, the hook assembly starts but then it is arrested before the end of the ring assembly [28]. Genetic analysis revealed another protein switch, Flk [29–31]. The role of Flk in regulation and localization of export substrate translation via flagellum was suggested [29], but later it was questioned [32].

The system of switching the assembly of the periplasmic hollow rod to the assembly of hook has been less investigated [10, 17]. The hollow rod penetrating the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall consists of only two ring-like layers of FlgG protein and interacts with the P-ring [8]. Mutant forms of FlgG capable of excessive polymerization cannot leave the periplasm and form a lengthened hollow rod with multiple P-rings [10, 33]. The length of this rod is limited by the regulatory action of FliK, and if

BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 80 No. 11 2015

FliK functioning is also disrupted then the hollow rod occupies the entire intracellular space, stretching the periplasm [10]. Under normal conditions, the length of the hollow rod is limited by interaction with the outer L-ring (Fig. 2b) replacing the cap of the rod (FlgJ) by the cap of the hook (FlgD) [10].

In addition to the regulation system of flagellum assembly based on conformational changes and proteolysis, a system of regulation expression of genes encoding the flagellum components also functions.

### GENES OF FLAGELLUM COMPONENTS

The genes mediating assembly and functioning of the flagellum are organized in multiple operons (Fig. 3) [34]. The operons of the bacterial flagellum are organized in a hierarchical system according to the type of regulon, when the expression of operons of a given level determines the expression of operons of the lower levels [2]. The main functional sense of this regulation system lies in the fact that, first, the “decision must be made” to construct the flagellum and, second, the expression of genes must be organized in accordance with the sequence of assembly of flagellum components. The operons in the regulon can be arbitrarily divided into three transcriptional classes based on time: early (I), intermediate (II), and late (III) (Fig. 3) depending on at what stage of bacterial flagellum assembly the expression is initiated. The process itself involves positive and negative control on all the stages of flagellum assembly starting with transcription and ending with localization of the proteins of flagellar system.

#### DECISION ON FLAGELLUM ASSEMBLY: REGULATION OF THE *flhDC* OPERON

Assembly and functioning of flagella require significant resources [2]. A bacterial cell must be able to activate or inactivate the system of flagellum construction depending on external conditions. The molecular mechanism of this switch comprises expression of genes *flhD* and *flhC* (Fig. 4) initiating further the entire flagellar regulon (Fig. 5). The protein products of these genes form transcriptional factor FlhD₄C₂ [35, 36], and only together they can initiate the cascade of flagellar gene expression. The respective operon *flhDC* belongs to class I (Fig. 3). The transcription of *flhDC* depends on many external signals (Fig. 4) and is affected by the promoter recognition.

Activation of transcription occurs via interaction between FlhD₄C₂ and the α-subunit of RNA polymerase [39]. Taken separately, FlhD and FlhC are not capable of activating transcription of flagellar regulon genes [40]. In addition to genes related to the flagellum, FlhD₄C₂ can activate several genes

not related to flagella such as *mglBAC* (galactose transport), malate dehydrogenase, and a number of enzymes involved in anaerobic catabolism [41].

The promoter region of the *flhDC* operon occupies more than 200 bp with multiple binding sites for proteins regulating transcription [37] (Fig. 4). Cells growing in the presence of glucose do not have flagella [42]. Under starvation conditions causing cAMP accumulation, the catabolism activator protein CRP activates transcription of the *flhDC* operon in addition to tens of other operons [43]. The CRP/cAMP complex interacts with the (-61)-(-81) site of *flhDC*. H-NS protein that also stimulates transcription has several binding sites [44]. Proteins of the quorum sensing system (QseB and QseC) also activate transcription of the *flhDC* operon [45, 46]. The activator of attachment pili — fimbriae (MatA) — could also be found among repressors of *flhDC* transcription [47]. It is likely that the flagellum and fimbriae are mutually exclusive surface structures. LrhA [48], OmpR [49], RcsCDB [50, 51], HdfR [52], DksA/ppGpp [53], as well as Fur and IHF [37] repress the *flhDC* genes.

In addition to transcription regulators, *flhDC* expression is affected by the large set of small RNAs. The small noncoding RNAs ArcZ, OmrA, OmrB, and OxyS inhibit expression of genes in the *flhDC* operon [54], while snRNA Mcas [55] activates expression of genes from this operon. The RNA-binding protein CsrA, which suppresses translation of numerous genes via binding with mRNA, on the contrary activates expression of the *flhDC* operon preventing mRNA degradation [56]. The activity of FlhD₄C₂ is also controlled on the level of stability of these proteins [57]. Heat shock proteins positively affect FlhD₄C₂ activity [58].

Even if the system of regulation of *flhDC* expression seems complicated, the result of its operation is not gradual change, but all-or-nothing switch. If the expression of the flagellar gene cascade is initiated, this state becomes irreversible due to availability of several systems of positive feedback connections.

**FLAGELLAR GENE EXPRESSION CASCADE: SEQUENCE OF FLAGELLAR COMPONENT SYNTHESIS AND CORRELATION OF GENE EXPRESSION AND FLAGELLUM ASSEMBLY**

Emergence of the major transcriptional regulator of the flagellum (FlhD₄C₂), which is a product of expression of a single operon of group I (Fig. 5a), initiates expression of several operons of group II: *flgAMN*, *flgBCDEFGHIJ*, *flhBAE*, *fliAZY*, *fliDST*, *fliE*, *fliFGHIJK*, and *fliLMNOPQR* (Fig. 3). At this stage, FlhD₄C₂ activates σ⁷⁰-dependent promoters of these operons. The mentioned genes essentially encode structural components of rings, basal body, and hook, early substrates of flagellar transport, and their chaperons.

In addition to structural genes, the operons of group II encode several regulatory proteins. The σ²⁸ factor [59] encoded by the *fliA* gene and its inhibitor FlgM [60] are the most important. Transcription of late genes of the flagellar regulon transcribed from the promoters of the group III occurs with participation of σ²⁸ rather than σ⁷⁰. Expression of the late genes is initiated only after the basal body and hook are formed. In the early stages of flagellum assembly, σ²⁸ is inactive as it is located in a complex with FliA/FlgM (Fig. 5b) [61] that is incapable of interacting with RNA polymerase.

FlgM is the most important sensor of the specificity switch of flagellar transport. It can be exported from the cell through the flagellum, but it belongs to the late substrates [62], hence, such transport becomes possible only after the hook is formed (Fig. 5c) [63]. This amazing regulatory mechanism postpones synthesis of flagellin in the cell up to the moment when the possibility of its export and embedding into a flagellum is created. After the drop of intracellular FlgM concentration due to its export, free σ²⁸ can bind to RNA polymerase and activate the dependent class III promoters of the flagellar system (Figs. 3 and 5d) *flgKL*, *fliDST*, *flgMN*, *fliC*, *tar-tap-cheRBYZ*, *motAB-cheAW*, *fliAZY* [64] and the genes responsible for the direction of movement of the bacterium (chemotaxis system) — *trg* [65], *tsr* [66], and *aer* [67]. It must be mentioned that a relatively large number of operons of the flagellar system has two promoters (Figs. 3 and 5): one from class II and another from class III. The *fliA* gene itself has two promoters, one of which (class III) is active only in the presence of σ²⁸ itself. This system of positive feedback makes the switch of the regulatory system to flagellum synthesis irreversible, and it probably affects the accelerated synthesis of the components of other flagella when the first one has already emerged.

Several gens have promoters only from class III. These are the genes of the flagellar motor system, the system for regulation of motor rotation (chemotaxis), and flagellin itself (Figs. 3 and 5d). It is likely that the motor rotation before completion of the flagellum assembly and polymerization of flagellin inside the cell before the possibility of its export arises could be extremely detrimental for the bacterium. Delay in flagellin synthesis with prior accumulation of other late substrates of the flagellar transport that have class II promoters provides an advantage to the latter during export immediately after the specificity switch FlhB. This is quite logical, because it allows export of proteins forming connection between the hook and distal flagellin part of flagellum FlgK and FlgL after the completion of the hook assembly but before the emergence of flagellin FliC [68].

In addition to FlgM — a σ²⁸ inhibitor — one more protein (FliT) plays an important role in regulation of the flagellar regulon (Fig. 4). Strains with *fliT* deletion make approximately twice as many flagella than the wild-type

BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 80 No. 11 2015

bacteria [69]. FliT represses transcription from the FlhD4C2-dependent promoters of class II [70]. Prior to hook assembly, FliT is bound to the FliD protein and is inactive as a transcription repressor [71]. FliD is a late substrate of flagellar export and, hence, it leaves the cell after hook formation and FlhB autoproteolysis forming the flagellum cap. In this way, free FliT is accumulated within the cell, inhibiting transcription of class II promoters, whose activity is not needed after completion of assembly of the hook and the basal body [10].

It must be mentioned that FliT serves as a chaperon of flagellar export for FliD [72], the same way as FliA does for FlgM [73]. Close relationship of the transport and regulatory activities of this pair of factors is clear. Another chaperon of flagellar transport FlgN is responsible for transport of FlgK and FlgL proteins [72], which connect the hook and the distal part of the flagellum (Fig. 1). Mutations of the *flgN* gene result in decreased motility and availability of only one or two flagella per cell, in contrast to normal cells that have from five to 10 flagella [74]. Further investigation established that strains with mutations in the *flgN* have the normal number of hook-basal body structures, but only a few of them have attached filament. This phenotype is related to the fact that FlgN is required for the export of FlgK and FlgL. In addition to the transport function, FlgN also exhibits regulatory functions, the same as transport chaperons FliA and FliT. This protein stimulates translation of the *flgM* mRNA obtained via the class III promoter translation [75].

Participation in translation regulation has been postulated for the sensor of the P- and L-ring assembly—export regulator Flk [29]. Inactivation of *flk* on the background of the assembly of defective P- and L-rings decreases FlgM level with its transcription being not affected. This has been a basis for the suggestion that Flk stimulates translation. Later studies have thrown doubt on this idea, and it was suggested that Flk inactivation resulted in excessive export of FlgM and its degradation in periplasm [32].

Data are available in the literature indicating that the flagellin mRNA translation is also regulated. Hairpin mutations at the 5′-terminus of the nontranslated *fliC* mRNA region, which is sufficiently far from the ribosome-binding site, suppress translation of this mRNA [76]. The search for suppressors revealed several compensatory mutations both in the 5′-nontranslated region of flagellin mRNA and in the beginning of its coding region [77]. It was suggested that the beginning of the coding region of *fliC* could form RNA-duplex with the 5′-nontranslated region, forming complex secondary structure. Among the mutations facilitating translation of mutant forms, a *fliC* mRNA mutation was found that caused shortening of FlgM. Additional mutation analysis suggested FlgM activity regulating *fliC* translation that was not related to FliA inhibition [77].

Investigation of the flagellum assembly and regulation of expression of its genes revealed an interesting molecular mechanism. In this mechanism, the self-assembly of the most complex molecular motor is strictly coordinated by conformational transformations of its structure. These switches, in turn, control the complex hierarchical system of gene expression. It was surprising that several flagellar proteins have multiple functions. Structural components of the flagellum regulate activity of transcription factor proteins, and the latter, in turn, are required for export of the former through the flagellum.

Investigation of the flagellum is not yet complete. Regulation of translation of mRNA components of the flagellar system has not been adequately investigated. Our understanding of how the number of flagella is regulated and how the flagella at different stages of assembly affect each other is far from perfect. Finally, the mechanisms of flagella disassembly under changes in environmental conditions are practically unknown.
