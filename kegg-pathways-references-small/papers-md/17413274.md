## Purpose of review
Recent developments in the elucidation of genes underlying arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and possible pathogenic mechanisms will be highlighted.

## Recent findings
The cardiac desmosome is a multiprotein structure involved in cell–cell interactions. Mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins such as PKP2, DSP, JUP, DSC2 and DSG2 underlie arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which can therefore be considered a desmosome cardiomyopathy. Mutations in the plakophilin-2 gene are most prevalent. Current pathophysiological insights suggest a final common pathway in which plakoglobin release from the desmosome, independent of the primarily affected desmosomal protein, results in desmosome impairment, intercalated disc remodeling and Wnt/β-catenin pathway signaling defects. The recognition of left ventricular involvement associated with mutations in desmosomal protein genes and low penetrance suggests that formal criteria should not be followed too closely in selecting patients for DNA analysis, because finding a mutation may have important implications for clinical practice.

## Summary
Recent developments have demonstrated that arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy can be considered a desmosome cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular involvement is not uncommon in this type of cardiomyopathy. Such findings are important for diagnostics and family screening and form a starting-point for the elucidation of other (non)-genetic factors influencing disease progression and outcome.

## Introduction
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is generally characterized by right ventricular (fibro)-fatty replacement of myocardial tissue. Usually it presents with palpitations or syncope as a result of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It is an important cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) at relatively young ages. A review on the clinical aspects was recently presented in this journal [1].

In 1994 a task force proposed criteria that are used as a standard in clinical diagnostics [2]. ARVC is familial in up to 50% of cases [3] and is generally transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, with some examples of autosomal recessive inheritance. As a result of the variable expression and age-related penetrance of the disease, manifestations in family members can be limited. Therefore, less strict criteria for family members have been proposed [3].

The elucidation of genes underlying autosomal dominant inherited ARVC has been very limited until the end of 2004. Before that date, three genes and six loci had been identified [4–12]. Besides, in an autosomal recessive syndromal form of ARVC, with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair (Naxos disease), a homozygous 2 base pair deletion in the junctional plakoglobin gene (JUP) was found [13]. The discovery of mutations in the plakophilin-2 gene (PKP2) encoding another desmosomal protein led to a breakthrough in the unraveling of the genetics of ARVC, and supported the idea that ARVC might be a desmosomal disease [14].

In this review, we focus on recent advances in the molecular genetics of ARVC, with emphasis on

pathophysiology, genes encoding desmosomal proteins, and implications for clinical practice.

### Desmosomal abnormalities and pathophysiological mechanisms

The structural and functional integrity of cardiomyocytes is supported by cell adhesion junctions in the intercalated disc. This specialized structure contains three types of intercellular connection: gap junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes. Gap junctions are responsible for electric coupling and signaling mechanisms by mediating ion transfer between cells. Adherens junctions and desmosomes provide mechanical attachment between cells by anchoring actin filaments or intermediate filaments, respectively. In addition, adherens junctions are involved in force transmission, whereas desmosomes protect the other junctions from mechanical stress and are involved in structural organization of the intercalated disc [15, 16, 17]. Notably, desmosomes are also believed to play a role in cell–cell signaling themselves [18, 19]. Desmosomes are found in tissues that experience mechanical stress; epidermis and myocardium in particular. Mutant desmosomes are probably able to maintain tissue integrity unless subjected to excessive mechanical stress. In this respect, the thinnest portions of the right ventricle, i.e., the right ventricular outflow tract, inflow tract and the apex (the ‘triangle of dysplasia’) are the most vulnerable.

Desmosomes are multiprotein structures in the cell membrane and consist of three protein families: (1) transmembrane proteins (cadherins): desmogleins (DSG) and desmocollins (DSC); (2) linker-(armadillo-repeat) proteins: plakoglobin and plakophilin; and (3) plakins: desmoplakin (DSP) and plectin (Fig. 1).

Within desmosomes, cadherins interact with armadillo proteins, which for their part are connected to plakins. The latter anchor desmosomes to intermediate filaments, mainly desmin (Fig. 1), thereby forming a three-dimensional scaffolding that provides tissues with mechanical strength [20, 21]. Although desmosomal proteins are widely expressed, mutations in specific components lead to myocardial dysfunction only, because some are specifically expressed in myocardial tissue. Some desmosomal proteins (e.g., desmoplakin and plakoglobin) also participate in desmosomes of other tissues. This is exemplified by the fact that mutations in these components, in addition to cardiomyopathy, lead to skin and hair abnormalities.

#### Pathophysiological mechanisms

Desmosome mutations are currently believed to exert pathogenic effects at different levels (discussed in more detail below): (1) desmosome composition and function; (2) intercalated discs; and (3) Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In all cases, desmosome impairment is believed to

A model of the relative organization of major desmosome components is presented. The plasma membrane-bound (PM) desmocollin-2 (DSC2) and desmoglein-2 (DSG2) proteins interact via their extracellular domains at the dense midline (DM) in the extracellular space between adjacent cells. Their cytoplasmic domains interact with plakoglobin (PG) and plakophilin-2 (PKP2) in the outer dense plaque (ODP). Also in the ODP, PKP2 and plakoglobin interact with the N-terminal domain of desmoplakin (DSP). The C-terminus of desmoplakin anchors intermediate filaments, mainly desmin (DES), at the inner dense plaque (IDP).

predispose to tissue damage under conditions of mechanical stress, leading to the disruption and subsequent degeneration of cardiomyocytes [22] and their replacement by (fibro)-fatty tissue. This may lead to variations in conduction properties, resulting in the initiation of ventricular tachycardias. Important in this respect is the observation that plakoglobin fails to localize to the intercalated discs of patients with plakoglobin mutations, but also in those with PKP2 and desmoplakin mutations, suggesting a final common pathway in ARVC pathogenesis [15,16].

**Pathogenic effects at the level of the desmosome**

Mutations in genes encoding components of this complex might lead to: (1) haploinsufficiency and thus insufficient incorporation of the protein; (2) the absence of essential protein–protein interactions; and (3) the incorrect incorporation of mutant proteins in the desmosome. The latter will result in disturbed formation or reduced numbers of functional desmosomes. This was exemplified by studies of Basso *et al.* [17•], which showed decreased desmosome numbers, and increased desmosome lengths in myocardial tissue of mutation carriers. Mechanical stress might induce the disruption of these desmosomal structures, resulting in reduced mechanical contacts and the detachment of cardiomyocyte cells. This effect might be direct (reduced desmosomal contacts), indirect (reduced contacts of gap and adherens junctions), or both.

**Pathogenic effects at the level of the intercalated disk**

The indirect effects of desmosome disruption might be caused by its role in the protection of other junctions from mechanical stress and in the structural organization of the intercalated disc [19]. In the aforementioned studies of Basso *et al.* [17•] this was exemplified by abnormal small junctions and intercellular gap widening in the absence of convolution in the tissue of mutation carriers. Impaired desmosome function might lead to the disruption of adhesion junctions and the consequent loss of cell–cell contacts and cardiomyocyte death [17•]. Moreover, the destabilization of cell adhesion complexes may perturb the kinetics of gap junction turnover, resulting in heterogeneous conduction, a potential contributor to arrhythmogenesis in ARVC [15,16,23].

**Pathogenic effects at the level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling**

It has recently been discovered that desmosomes or desmosome components participate in intercellular signaling networks via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Wnt signaling is involved in a variety of developmental processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, and the development of tissues and organs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation

of plakoglobin [24]. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and β-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells [25••]. Notably, plakophilins (e.g., PKP2) are also expressed in or localized to the nucleus, however its nuclear function is currently unknown [26]. They might, however, be involved in transcriptional regulation or in regulating β-catenin activity in the Wnt-signaling pathway [26,27].

In conclusion, current insights into ARVC pathogenesis point towards a ‘final common pathway’ with plakoglobin delocalization as the key event. Desmosome mutations lead to impaired mechanical coupling or desmosome disruption, followed by remodeling of the intercalated disc. This will result in the delocalization and nuclear localization of plakoglobin and in effects at cellular signal transduction. Together, these processes will lead to cardiomyocyte death, (fibro)-fatty replacement, slow conduction, and thus facilitates re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias [22]. Importantly, gap junction remodeling may be considered to be an intermediate or alternative pathway to slow intramyocardial conduction, enhancing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias [15].

**Desmosomal mutations and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy**

The genes encoding desmosomal proteins plakophilin-2, desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein-2 and desmocollin-2 are discussed separately.

**Plakophilin-2**

The first study on PKP2 mutations in patients fulfilling the task force criteria (TFC) showed that 32 out of 120 patients carried a mutation in this gene [14]. The importance of PKP2 was confirmed in other studies with a yield of mutational screening of up to 43% in TFC-positive patients (Table 1) [28,29,30•,31•,32–36]. On the basis of earlier cardiological screening of family members, we demonstrated that mutations were even found in 70% of confirmed familial cases, whereas mutations were absent in patients without additional affected family members [31•]. So far approximately 50, mainly truncating mutations, have been found (for an overview see www.cardiogenetics.umcg.nl). Eleven identical mutations have been identified in the different studies. These were both recurrent and from common founders [14,28,31•].

**Genotype–phenotype relationships**

Dalal *et al.* [28] demonstrated that patients carrying PKP2 mutations presented at an earlier age than those without mutations (28 ± 11 versus 36 ± 16 years; \(P < 0.05\)). Besides, the median cumulative symptom-free and arrhythmia-free survival was lower in PKP2 mutation carriers than among non-carriers (32 versus 42 years and 34 versus 46 years, respectively; \(P < 0.05\)).

Other groups did not identify significant differences between carriers and non-carriers of a PKP2 mutation with respect to average age at initial presentation, a family history of SCD, TFC characteristics and endpoint events (i.e. documented sustained ventricular tachycardias, the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy, successful resuscitation, and SCD) [29,31<sup>•</sup>]. The only exceptions were more frequently encountered negative T waves in V<sub>2</sub>-V<sub>3</sub> in mutation carriers [31<sup>•</sup>], and the more frequent occurrence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardias in the non-mutation group [29].

Reduced penetrance and variable expression in PKP2 mutation carriers

Penetrance in ARVC is higher in men than women and has been reported to be 62–72% in men [3,37]. This might be caused by factors such as exposure to vigorous athletic activity and viral agents, and biological factors such as the inhibitory effects of estrogens on myocardial cell apoptosis [38,39]. Besides, other (epi)-genetic factors might play a role.

Reduced (age-related) penetrance has also been observed in several pedigrees, with PKP2 mutation carriers demonstrating normal or mild disease phenotypes, even at ages over 70 years [14,29,40,41<sup>•</sup>]. Syrris et al. [29] reported the penetrance among PKP2 mutation carriers to be nearly 50%, although the influence of sex and age was not represented. Dalal et al. [41<sup>•</sup>] studied 26 PKP2 mutation carriers, related to nine probands previously shown to carry pathogenic PKP2 mutations, who underwent clinical screening. Eight (31%) were diagnosed with ARVC, whereas nine (35%) had at least some TFC other than family history. The penetrance of symptoms, diagnosis (meeting TFC), occurrence of ventricular tachycardia and death were shown to be age dependent [41<sup>•</sup>].

The clinical variability/reduced penetrance (i.e. not fulfilling TFC) associated with PKP2 mutations has been corroborated by the fact that PKP2 mutations have also been identified in up to 5% of patients who did not fulfil the TFC [29,31<sup>•</sup>].

Apart from this absence of features in mutation carriers, phenocopies can also occur. Syrris et al. [29] identified family members who fulfilled modified criteria but did not carry the mutation identified in the proband (false positives). These phenocopies were mainly accounted for by the inclusion of frequent occurrence of ventricular ectopy on Holter monitoring and the overinterpretation of wall motion abnormalities on imaging. On the other hand, this can be completely coincidental, and might shed light on possible other (genetic) factors explaining clinical variability in relatives.

### Desmoplakin

Mutations in desmoplakin are associated with two autosomal recessive inherited syndromes: Carvajal syndrome [dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), woolly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma] and a ‘Naxos-like’ disorder consisting of ARVC, woolly hair and an epidermolytic skin disorder [42,43]. In addition, desmoplakin mutations have been identified in ‘non-syndromal’ typical autosomal dominant ARVC with respect to electrocardiographic and structural features [12,44]. Desmoplakin mutations were identified in four out of 25 (16%) Italian ARVC index patients studied, later confirmed in a larger series from the same population (Table 1) [30<sup>•</sup>,44]. Finally, Yang et al. [32] identified desmoplakin mutations in four out of 66 (6%) ARVC patients from the north American ARVD/C registry (Table 1).

The clinical spectrum of familial ARVC caused by desmoplakin mutations is quite heterogeneous. A high rate of SCD, even as an initial manifestation, is noted. In addition, left ventricular involvement was found in half of the patients (Table 2) [45–47]. The role of desmoplakin in the left ventricular involvement of ARVC was substantiated by the identification of a desmoplakin mutation, resulting in truncation of the carboxy terminus of desmoplakin, in a family with (predominant, yet not exclusive) left-sided ARVC; arrhythmogenic left

ventricular cardiomyopathy [46]. Clinical manifestations include left ventricular involvement preceding the development of significant right ventricular dysfunction, lateral T-wave inversion, and arrhythmias of left ventricular origin [46, 48]. Prominent repolarization abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias and right ventricular aneurysms distinguish arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy from DCM [44].

It is hypothesized that the desmoplakin mutations resulting in the truncation of the carboxy terminus of desmoplakin (located at the inner dense plaque and containing the desmin-binding site) predispose to early left ventricular involvement as a result of disruption of the cytoskeletal integrity, and explain the high prevalence of left ventricular involvement [49]. In contrast, mutations in desmosomal proteins at the outer dense plaque are associated with a predominantly right ventricular phenotype.

### Plakoglobin

In 19 patients with Naxos disease (autosomal recessive inherited ARVC with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair) a homozygous 2 base pair deletion in plakoglobin was identified. Heterozygous mutation carriers do not exhibit signs of the disease, neither have mutations been identified in autosomal dominant inherited ARVC [13]. In-vitro studies in endothelial cells demonstrated that inhibition of plakoglobin expression induces cell-cell dissociation in response to shear stress, but not in resting conditions [50]. Plakoglobin null-mutant mouse embryos died from ventricular rupture when myocardial cells undergo increased mechanical stress [51]. Plakoglobin null mice show a clinical picture identical to Naxos disease. Endurance training in heterozygous plakoglobin-deficient mice accelerated the development of right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias, supporting the hypothesis that exercise aggravates ARVC development [52**]. Interestingly, no (fibro)-fatty myocardial replacement was identified in these heterozygous mice.

### Desmoglein-2

In typical ARVC patients DSG2 mutations were identified in 10% of screened patients [8/80; 12% of the PKP2/desmoplakin/transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) negative group] [30*]. This was confirmed in other series (Table 1) [33, 34]. Reduced penetrance and the involvement of other mutations (compound heterozygosity) is observed. Interestingly, some of the mutation carriers had almost exclusively left-sided disease (Table 2). This and other observations made the authors leave the original concept of diagnosing ARVC solely on the basis of isolated right ventricular disease [34].

### Desmocollin-2

DSC2 is the desmosomal protein most recently causally related to ARVC. DSC2, like DSG2, is a major constituent

of desmosomal cadherins, and was therefore considered an important candidate gene. Syrris *et al.* [36] found mutations in four out of 77 (5%) desmoplakin/JUP/PKP2/DSG2-negative ARVC patients, with incomplete penetrance in the families studied. Left ventricular involvement was found in the majority of mutation carriers with examples of predominant left-sided disease (Table 2) [36]. Simultaneously, Heuser *et al.* [35] identified a splice-site mutation in one out of 88 PKP2/DSG2-negative patients.

### Other non-desmosomal genes

Non-desmosomal genes identified in ARVC are TGF-β3 and RYR2.

#### Transforming growth factor beta 3 gene

Beffagna *et al.* [11] described two families with a mutation in, respectively, the 5′ and 3′ untranslated region of the TGF-β3 gene leading to the altered expression of TGF-β3. No mutations were identified in two other ARVC-1 families. Overexpression of TGF-β3, a cytokine stimulating the production of extracellular matrix components, may lead to myocardial fibrosis. This study suggests that different pathways may lead to myocyte apoptosis and myocardial atrophy.

#### Cardiac ryanodine receptor gene

Eight families with a distinct phenotype of highly penetrant ARVC and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and a mutation in the RYR2 gene have been described [10,47]. RYR2 is the major calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiomyocytes. As a result of a close resemblance to familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, it is controversial whether this entity should be considered a primary form of ARVC.

#### Clinical implications

As a result of the intrinsic clinical variability of ARVC, the TFC are a valuable guide in the initial approach of a patient with features of ARVC. One has to be aware that the TFC do not allow for left ventricular disease. The growing recognition of left ventricular involvement, as demonstrated in different studies [34,36,44,46], and the low penetrance and variable expressivity suggest that clinicians should not adhere too closely to the TFC in selecting patients for DNA analysis, because finding a mutation may have important implications for clinical practice. First, it may help in the diagnostic clarification of ‘borderline’ cases. Second, although the clinical course of the disease cannot be predicted from DNA analysis, it can help in identifying individuals at risk. This facilitates timely diagnosis, with the subsequent possibility of preventing complications and reducing morbidity and mortality. Genetic predisposition may lead to alterations in lifestyle such as avoiding strenuous exercise. Given the

low penetrance, however, a mutation carrier is not automatically assumed to be destined for the severe phenotype that once was encountered in a family member.

Finally, developments in molecular biology will enable cascade screening in family members with a high negative-predictive value. Until now it has been common practice to screen close relatives of an index case cardiological at regular intervals. The identification of a pathogenic mutation in an index patient will give the opportunity to reassure family members who have not demonstrated abnormalities in cardiological (periodical follow-up) screening and do not carry the respective mutation. These can be dismissed from regular cardiological follow-up.

The recently acquired insights in molecular biology and pathogenesis also raise (new) challenges with regard to the proper identification and treatment of mutation carriers without apparent structural cardiac abnormalities but with increased risk of arrhythmias. In addition, there lies a major challenge in the clarification of factors underlying non-penetrance, risk factors and therapeutic strategies.

### Conclusion

After the initial recognition of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mainly as a sarcomeric disease, and DCM as a cytoskeleton disease, ARVC can be considered a ‘desmosome cardiomyopathy’, with the PKP2 gene as the key player followed by desmoplakin and DSG. As encountered in DCM and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, overlap in genes encoding proteins of the respective structures (sarcomere, cytoskeleton) occurs. ARVC itself also has interesting intrinsic features, such as the recognition of more left-sided oriented forms that may mimic DCM, which may lead to the clarification of overlap in cardiomyopathies. The recognition of ARVC as a ‘desmosome cardiomyopathy’ will pave the way to the elucidation of other genetic and non-genetic factors that will initiate the development of the disease in mutation carriers, explaining the extreme ends of the wide clinical spectrum. The tremendous increase in knowledge on pathogenesis in recent years is an important step but only a beginning.
