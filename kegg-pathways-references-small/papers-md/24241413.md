**ABSTRACT**

The observation that upon elicitation cell suspension cultures of *Eschscholtzia californica* showed a decrease of dihydromacarpine with a concomitant increase of macarpine led to the discovery of a novel enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of dihydrobenzophenanthridines in the presence of oxygen. The enzyme was enriched approx. 70-fold. It has a pH-optimum of 7.0, an isoelectric point at pH 8.8, molecular weight of 56 kD and shows a high degree of substrate specificity. The enzyme obviously catalyzes the terminal step in the formation of benzophenanthridine alkaloids containing methylene dioxy substitutions in rings A and D.

**INTRODUCTION**

In a preceding paper (Schumacher et al., 1987) it was reported that treatment of *Eschscholtzia californica* cells with a fungal elicitor resulted in the massive induction of bright red benzophenanthridine alkaloids in this normally colorless cell culture strain. The main compounds produced under elicitation were sanguinarine, chelirubine and macarpine. In our attempt to elucidate benzophenanthridine biosynthesis at the cell-free level, we are specifically searching for the enzymes involved directly in the pathway leading from (S)-cis-N-methylstylopine, the established precursor, to macarpine, the dead-end benzophenanthridine alkaloid (Takao et al., 1983). In this investigation we observed that during the elicitation process of a benzophenanthridine containing *Eschscholtzia* strain the concentration of dihydrobenzophenanthridine derivatives in the plant cells decreased strongly while the concentration of the respective quaternary alkaloids concomitantly rose. This prompted us to search for an enzyme which could be involved in the terminal steps of benzophenanthridine biosynthesis, namely the dehydrogenation of the dihydro-

alkaloidal precursors to form the strongly colored quaternary alkaloids. Preliminary results on the detection, partial purification and characterization of this enzyme which we named: dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase are reported in this paper.

**MATERIAL and METHODS**

**Enzyme preparation**

A culture of *E. californica* which was established on Linsmaier and Skoog (1965) medium was split by cellular cloning into 4 different cell lines which varied in their content of benzophenanthridines and their ability to be stimulated by fungal elicitors (Schumacher et al., 1987). The suspension cultures were transferred every 7th day and were cultivated at 100 rpm at 23±1°C under 600 lux incandescent light. Light had no effect on the biosynthetic capacity of

the cells. The cells were harvested in the late log phase, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C. Typically 1000 g (fwt) of frozen cells were thawed while stirring in 1000 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 20 mM mercaptoethanol). The homogeneous mass was pressed through cheese-cloth and centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 x g. Solid \((\mathrm{NH}_{4})_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\) was added to the supernatant and a 50 - 70% cut was prepared. The precipitate was taken up in 20 ml of the above buffer and desalted using a AcA 44 column (5 x 95 cm); equilibration and elution buffer was 0.02 M phosphate containing 20 mM mercaptoethanol. The fractions containing the enzyme (31 - 47) were pooled and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 x 22 cm). The enzyme did not adhere to the column but was found quantitatively in the wash-through using the above buffer (20 mM). The enzyme solution was applied to a CM-cellulose column (1.5 x 11 cm) (Whatman) and the protein eluted with a step gradient containing 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2% KCl (each 40 ml). The enzyme was contained in the 1% KCl step and dialyzed against Tris/HCl buffer (20 mM, pH 8.9). In the final purification step the enzyme was subjected to FPLC (Pharmacia) chromatography using a mono-Q HR 5/5 column. The column was eluted (50 min) with a linear gradient of KCl (0 - 0.5 M in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.9). The enzyme eluted at 0.2 M KCl. Those fractions containing the enzyme were used as an enzyme source for characterization.

Standard enzyme assay

The reaction mixture (250 μl) included 20 μmol potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 nmol \({ }^{[8-3} \mathrm{H}\) ]-dihydromacarpine (57 000 dpm) and enzyme solution (1 - 300 μg protein). In case of controls, boiled (10 min) enzyme was used. The assay mixture was incubated for 45 min at \(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). The reaction was terminated by addition of 300 ml activated charcoal suspension. The sample was mixed for 1 min and subsequently centrifuged for 5 min (all Eppendorf systems). The radioactivity of the supernatant was counted and the reaction calculated from the tritium released into the aqueous phase. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by standard gel filtration techniques. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was determined using column chromatofocusing (PBE 94, Pharmacia). Protein was determined according to Bradford (1976). \({ }^{[8-3} \mathrm{H}\) ]-Dihydrobenzophenanthridines were prepared by sodium boro-\({ }^{[3} \mathrm{H}\) ]-hydride (Amersham) reduction of the corresponding quaternary alkaloids in freshly distill-

ed MeOH and subsequent purification of the labelled compounds by TLC (Schumacher et al., 1987). The average specific activity was 0.28 mCi/μmol. Alkaloids were extracted and quantitated by HPLC as described previously (Schumacher et al., 1987).

RESULTS

The Eschscholtzia cell culture strain used in the investigation contained dihydromacarpine as the main alkaloid and only traces of the quaternary macarpine next to small amounts of chelerythrine, sanguinarine, chelirubine (Fig. 2A). Application of the yeast elicitor (Schumacher et al., 1987) to the cell cultures resulted in the decrease of dihydromacarpine concentration and the appearance of macarpine (Fig. 2B). This effect was reproducible and was seen in a number of Eschscholtzia strains. This observation made it likely that an enzyme exists in these cells which oxidizes the dihydroforms of benzophenanthridines to yield the quaternary alkaloids. We therefore set out to detect and characterize this enzyme possibly involved in one of the terminal steps in benzophenanthridine biosynthesis.

A convenient test for enzyme activity was applied involving the removal of one tritium atom of \([8-{ }^{3} \mathrm{H}]\)-dihydromacarpine which is easily accessible by reduction of macarpine by sodium boro-\({ }^{3} \mathrm{H}\)-hydride. Half of the tritium contained in the reduction product should appear in the aqueous phase of incubation medium upon oxidation of the substrate.

To test the validity of this assumption, \(\left[8-{ }^{3} \mathrm{H}\right]\)-dihydromacarpine was chemically oxidized in the standard assay mixture with either \(\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}\) or \(\mathrm{CrO}_{3}\). In both cases exactly \(50 \%\) of the radioactivity of the dihydrocompound was found in the water phase of the incubation mixture. Applying this test system, crude enzyme preparations of E. californica cells were incubated in the presence of tritium-labelled di-hydromacarpine and with the coenzymes NAD and NADP as potential hydrogen acceptors. While in the case of control experiments using heat denatured protein, no radioactivity was found in the aqueous medium, the native enzyme showed after 3 h incubation the theoretical release of tritium. This activity was protein (10 - 300 μg tested) and time (0 - 20 min) dependent. The oxidation proceeded also in the absence of NAD and NADP, which were therefore omitted in future experiments. Scaling up the assay used for the radioactive experiment by a factor of 4 and increasing the concentration of dihydromacarpine to 0.8 mM, after a reaction time of 12 h at \(30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and subjecting this incubation mixture to HPLC analysis, demonstrated that the dihydromacarpine was enzymatically transformed to a product which in retention time and UV absorption was identical to authentic macarpine. The heat denatured control did not yield this oxidation product. Subsequently the enzyme was partially purified from E. californica, the results shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Purification procedure for dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase

The final enzyme preparation was 70-fold enriched, yielding only \(3 \%\) of the original enzyme activity. The final purification step used in this procedure, chromatography on a mono-Q FPLC-column, is shown in Fig. 3.

A linear relationship between dihydromacarpine oxidized and time was observed for the initial 60 min using \(1 \mu \mathrm{g}\) of enzyme. Dependence of the reaction rate on protein concentration proved linear over a range of 0 to \(1.5 \mu \mathrm{g}(40 \mathrm{~min}, 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C})\) and then gradually decreased. The molecular weight, \(56 \mathrm{kD} \pm 5 \%\), was determined using gel filtration chromatography. The temperature optimum resided at \(45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), with a \(Q_{10}\)-value of 2.2 and an activation energy of \(53 \mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{mole}\) in a temperature range of \(14-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). The \(\mathrm{pH}\) optimum of the enzyme catalyzed reaction was at 7.0, half maximal reaction rates were observed at \(\mathrm{pH} 5.5\) and 8.0. The isoelectric point was at \(\mathrm{pH} 8.8\). The substrate specificity and kinetic constants of the enzyme measured using the partially purified enzyme were determined for dihydrosanguinarine \(\left(K_{\mathrm{M}}=16 \mu \mathrm{M}\right)\), dihydrochelirubine \(\left(K_{\mathrm{M}}=8 \mu \mathrm{M}\right)\) and dihydromacarpine \(\left(K_{\mathrm{M}}=6 \mu \mathrm{M}\right)\). Dihydrochelerythrine as well as chelidonine did not serve as substrates.

Substitution of helium for oxygen stopped the enzyme reaction completely; readmission of oxygen led to a linear increase of substrate oxidation. Because of the small amounts of enzyme available it was up to now not possible to determine whether the reaction depicted in Fig. 1 proceeds with the formation of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\).or H₂O₂. This problem is under investigation.

The mechanism of the reaction and coenzyme possibly involved is yet unclear. Using potential enzyme inhibitors it was found that SH-group reactive compounds did not influence the enzyme reaction even if applied at 10 mM concentration. However, the inclusion of morin (1 mM) and dicumarol (0.1 mM) led to 80% inhibition. Whether this indicates the presence of covalently bound flavine in the enzyme as it was found in the case of the (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase (Amann et al., 1984) cannot be answered yet.

This enzyme was not found to occur in control cell suspension cultures which do not contain benzophenanthridine alkaloids such as Rauwolﬁa serpentina, Catharanthus roseus and others.

DISCUSSION

The biosynthesis of benzophenanthridine has received only little attention in the past. The precursor role of protoberberines has been postulated on theoretical grounds by Robinson (1955). This hypothesis was supported by precursor feeding experiments conducted by Leete and Murrill (1964) and subsequently by Battersby et al. (1965, 1967, 1975 a,b), who demonstrated the specific incorporation of scoulerine and stylopine into chelidonine and sanguinarine and therefore the origin of the benzophenanthridine from the tetrahydroprotoberberine skeleton. Takao et al. (1983) have made the important observation that protopines serve as direct intermediates in the formation of the benzophenanthridine nucleus. While the synthesis of protopine has now been clarified at the enzyme level (Rueffer and Zenk, 1987) none of the enzymes are known catalyzing reactions between protopine and the quaternary benzophenanthridines.

The finding described in this paper, that upon stimulation of the benzophenanthridine biosynthesis in E. californica cell cultures by fungal elicitors the quaternary alkaloids are obviously formed at the expense of their respective dihydro precursors, led to the discovery of a novel enzyme: dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase.

This enzyme was partially purified and characterized. It is highly specific with regard to the benzophenanthridine skeleton, and substitutions in rings A and D other than methylenedioxy groups render it inactive for oxidation. The enzyme is dependent on molecular oxygen but no dissociable coenzyme which could serve as hydrogen acceptor could be detected. The study of the reaction mechanism has to await the availability of larger amounts of enzyme. Takao et al. (1983) did not find an in vivo conversion to chelirubine of dihydrosanguinarine supplied to callus of Macleaya cordata and therefore excluded the oxidation of the dihydro to quaternary benzophenanthridines in the terminal biosynthetic steps. The occurrence, however, of dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase in Eschscholtzia cells and its absence in, for instance, indole alkaloid containing Rauwolﬁa or Catharanthus plants, together with its high substrate specificity make it highly likely that this enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of benzophenanthridines.
