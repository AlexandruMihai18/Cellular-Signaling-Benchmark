## Summary

The Ci/Gli family of transcription factors mediates Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in many key developmental processes. Here we identify a Hh-induced MATH and BTB domain containing protein (HIB) as a negative regulator of the Hh pathway. Overexpressing HIB downregulates Ci and blocks Hh signaling, whereas inactivating HIB results in Ci accumulation and enhanced pathway activity. HIB binds the N- and C-terminal regions of Ci, both of which mediate Ci degradation. HIB forms a complex with Cul3, a scaffold for modular ubiquitin ligases, and promotes Ci ubiquitination and degradation through Cul3. Furthermore, HIB-mediated Ci degradation is stimulated by Hh and inhibited by Suppressor of Fused (Sufu). The mammalian homolog of HIB, SPOP, can functionally substitute for HIB, and Gli proteins are degraded by HIB/SPOP in *Drosophila*. We provide evidence that HIB prevents aberrant Hh signaling posterior to the morphogenic furrow, which is essential for normal eye development.

## Introduction

The Hedgehog family of morphogens controls pattern formation and tissue homeostasis through the Ci/Gli family of transcription factors ([Ingham and McMahon, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg759); [Jia and Jiang, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.061)). Aberrant Hh signaling that leads to uncontrolled Gli activity has been linked to many human diseases including cancer ([Pasca di Magliano and Hebrok, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm1183); [Villavicencio et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/79547)). As such, the activity of Ci/Gli is tightly monitored through multiple levels of regulation including phosphorylation, proteolysis, nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning, and protein-protein interactions ([Jia and Jiang, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.061); [Lum and Beachy, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm1487)). In *Drosophila*, the full-length Ci (Ci<sup>FL</sup>) is phosphorylated by multiple kinases including protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and casein kinase I (CKI) in the absence of Hh ([Jia et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01082), [2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03876); [Price and Kalderon, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01083)). Phosphorylation recruits the Slimb-Cul1-based E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets Ci<sup>FL</sup> for ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolysis to generate a truncated repressor form (Ci<sup>Rep</sup>) ([Jia

Figure 1. HIB Downregulates Ci<sup>FL</sup> through Proteasome

(A–D) LacZ expression from a HIB enhancer trap line, l(3)03477 (hib-Z), in eye-antenna disc (A), wing and leg discs (B), or wing discs expressing UAS-Hh (C) or UAS-HA-Ci<sup>-3P</sup> (D) with MS1096. hib-lacZ is restricted posterior to the MF of eye discs (arrowhead in [A]) and is elevated along the A/P compartment border in antenna (arrow in [A]), wing (arrowhead in [B]), and leg (arrow in [B]) discs. Misexpression of Hh induces ectopic hib-lacZ expression in A compartment cells (C), whereas Ci<sup>-3P</sup> induces ectopic hib-lacZ expression in both A and P compartments (D). Of note, hib-lacZ expression is downregulated near the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary in the wing disc (asterisk).

(E and E′) An eye-antenna disc immunostained to show Ci<sup>FL</sup> (red) and hib-lacZ (green) expression. hib-lacZ-expressing cells have diminished levels of Ci<sup>FL</sup>.

(F and F′) An eye-antenna disc expressing UAS-GFP plus multiple copies of UAS-Flag-HIB with eq-Gal4 was immunostained to show GFP (green) and Ci<sup>FL</sup> (red) expression. GFP marks the cells expressing HIB transgenes. Misexpression of HIB resulted in a reduction of Ci<sup>FL</sup> at the MF (arrow in [F′]).

(G–J′) Wild-type wing disc (G) and wing discs expressing two copies (H–H″, I, and I′) or four copies (J and J′) of UAS-Flag-HIB were immunostained to show the expression of Ci<sup>FL</sup> (red in [G], [I], and [J]), Flag (green in [H]–[H″]), ptc-lacZ (blue in [I′] and [J′]), and a nuclear pore complex protein (NPCP, red in [H″]). Overexpressing HIB caused downregulation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> at the A/P boundary (arrows in [I] and [J]) and a reduction of ptc-lacZ expression (arrows in [I′] and [J′]). Flag-HIB exhibited punctate staining in the nuclei encircled by the NPCP staining (H′ and H″). Of note, MS1096 expresses Gal4 at higher levels in the dorsal compartment than in the ventral compartment (H).

(K) S2 cells were transfected with 6 μg Myc-Ci and indicated amounts of Flag-HIB expression construct, and treated with or without MG132, followed by Western blot analysis. The arrow indicates Myc-Ci, and the asterisk indicates a nonspecific band that serves as a loading control.

of antenna, leg, and wing discs (Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S1C and S1D), suggesting that CG9924 transcription is induced by Hh signaling and may regulate Hh signaling in multiple tissues. Indeed, misexpressing Hh or an active form of Ci (Ci<sup>-3P</sup>; Wang et al., 1999) in wing disc resulted in ectopic CG9924 expression (Figures 1C and 1D; Supplementary Figures 1E and 1F). Hence, we name this protein HIB for Hh-induced MATH and BTB domain protein.

### HIB Promotes Ci Degradation in a Proteasome-Dependent Manner

To determine whether HIB regulates Ci<sup>FL</sup> abundance, we misexpressed HIB across the MF using the equator gal4 driver, eq-Gal4 (Ou et al., 2002). HIB is restricted posterior to the MF where Ci<sup>FL</sup> level is low in wild-type eye disc (Figures 1A, 1E, and 1E′). We found that misexpression of HIB across the MF reduced Ci<sup>FL</sup> accumulation at the MF (Figures 1F and 1F′), suggesting that HIB is a rate-limiting factor that downregulates Ci<sup>FL</sup> in the eye disc. Likewise, overexpressing HIB in wing discs using the MS1096 gal4 driver diminished Ci<sup>FL</sup> accumulation near the A/P compartment boundary and inhibited Hh signaling, as indicated by a reduction of the Hh pathway target

ptc-lacZ (Figures 1I and 1I′). Increasing the dose of HIB resulted in more dramatic blockage of Ci<sup>FL</sup> accumulation and ptc-lacZ expression (Figures 1J and 1J′). In cultured Drosophila S2 cells, coexpression of HIB with Ci<sup>FL</sup> also downregulated Ci<sup>FL</sup> levels in a dose-dependent manner, and this downregulation was inhibited by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 1K), suggesting that HIB promotes degradation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> through the proteasome.

### Loss of HIB Results in Elevation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> and Hh Pathway Activity

To determine whether HIB is required for Ci<sup>FL</sup> instability in eye discs posterior to the MF or in wing discs near the A/P boundary, we employed the heritable RNAi technique to inactivate HIB (Kennedell and Carthew, 2000). Expressing a HIB RNAi construct (UAS-HIB-RNAi) in eye discs with either eq-Gal4 or GMR-Gal4 led to an elevation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> posterior to the MF (Figures 2A and 2B). UAS-HIB-RNAi expression in the dorsal compartment of wing discs using apterous-Gal4 (ap-Gal4) also resulted in elevation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> and Hh pathway activity, as manifested by increased expression of dpp-lacZ and ptc-lacZ (Figures 2D–2E′), suggesting that HIB

Figure 2. Loss of HIB Results in Elevation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> and Hh Signaling Activity

(A–B) Eye discs expressing multiple copies of UAS-HIB-RNAi plus UAS-GFP with eq-Gal4 (A and A′) or GMR-Gal4 (B) were immunostained with Ci<sup>FL</sup> (red) and GFP (green) antibodies. HIB knockdown resulted in Ci<sup>FL</sup> elevation posterior to the MF.

(C and C′) hib<sup>Δ6</sup> clones were generated in eye disc, followed by immunostaining with GFP (green) and Ci (red) antibodies. Ci<sup>FL</sup> is accumulated in posterior hib<sup>Δ6</sup> clones (marked by the lack of GFP expression and indicated by arrows).

(D–E′) Wing discs expressing multiple copies of UAS-HIB-RNAi plus UAS-GFP with ap-Gal4 were immunostained to show the expression of Ci<sup>FL</sup> (red in [D], [D′], and [E]), GFP (green in [D] and [E]), and dpp-lacZ (D″) or ptc-lacZ (E′). GFP marks the cells expressing UAS-HIB-RNAi, and the white line in D′ traces the A/P border. HIB knockdown leads to elevation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> and enhanced expression of dpp-lacZ and ptc-lacZ near the A/P border.

(F–F″) A wing disc carrying hib<sup>Δ6</sup> clones was immunostained to show the expression of Ci<sup>FL</sup> (red), GFP (green), and dpp-lacZ (blue). hib<sup>Δ6</sup> clones are recognized by the lack of GFP and outlined by white lines. hib mutant cells near the A/P boundary (arrow) exhibit elevated Ci<sup>FL</sup> and enhanced dpp-lacZ expression, whereas hib mutant cells distant from the A/P boundary show little or no change in Ci<sup>FL</sup> level (arrowhead). Of note, hib mutant cells close to the D/V boundary failed to accumulate Ci<sup>FL</sup> (asterisk).

(G–G″) A wing disc carrying hib<sup>Δ6</sup> clones and expressing MS1096/UAS-Hh was immunostained with Ci<sup>FL</sup> (red), GFP (green), and Ptc (blue) antibodies. Misexpression of Hh in A compartment cells induced activation but instability of Ci<sup>FL</sup>; however, A compartment hib mutant cells (marked by the lack of GFP and indicated by arrowheads) stabilized the Ci<sup>Act</sup> and exhibited enhanced Ptc expression regardless of their positions along the A/P axis.

normally attenuates Hh signaling by downregulating Ci<sup>FL</sup> in A compartment cells near the A/P boundary.

I(3)03477 harbors a P element inserted into the second annotated intron of hib (Figure S1A), and the associated lethality is reversed by precise excision of the P element. The P element insertion results in a dramatic reduction, but not complete loss, of hib expression (Figure S1B). Mutant clones homozygous for I(3)03477 only exhibited modestly increased Ci<sup>FL</sup> posterior and close to the MF, whereas I(3)03477 mutant cells situated in more posterior regions did not exhibit a detectable change in Ci<sup>FL</sup> level (Figures S3A and S3B). The lack of strong phenotype associated with I(3)03477 is likely due to the hypomorphic nature of this mutation, as suggested by residual hib expression in I(3)03477 homozygotes (Figure S1B). Indeed, posterior mutant clones homozygous for a hib deficiency, Df(3R)Exel6171, accumulated high levels of Ci<sup>FL</sup> posterior to the MF in regions both close to and distant from the MF (Figures S3C and S3D).

To further explore the role of HIB in the Hh pathway, we generated a null mutation by “ends-out” gene targeting in which hib coding sequence was replaced by the white gene (Gong and Golic, 2003). Two independent targeting alleles, hib<sup>Δ6</sup> and hib<sup>Δ14</sup>, were isolated (Figure S2) and exhibited similar phenotypes (data not shown). We used hib<sup>Δ6</sup> to carry out all the following experiments.

hib<sup>Δ6</sup> mutant clones posterior to the MF accumulated high levels of Ci<sup>FL</sup> similar to Df(3R)Exel6171 (Figures 2C and 2C′; Figures S3C–S3F), confirming that hib<sup>Δ6</sup> is a null allele. In wing discs, hib<sup>Δ6</sup> mutant clones located near the A/P boundary exhibited elevated Ci<sup>FL</sup> and enhanced dpp-lacZ expression (Figures 2F–2F″). In contrast, A compartment hib<sup>Δ6</sup> mutant clones distant from the A/P boundary did not affect Ci<sup>FL</sup>, suggesting that HIB targets Ci<sup>FL</sup> in Hh-receiving cells. To further test this hypothesis, we misexpressed Hh uniformly in wing pouch regions carrying hib<sup>Δ6</sup> mutant clones. Misexpressing Hh in A compartment cells converts Ci<sup>FL</sup> into active but labile forms, as manifested by ectopic ptc expression and diminished Ci<sup>FL</sup>; however, Ci<sup>FL</sup> is stabilized in anteriorly situated hib<sup>Δ6</sup> mutant clones (Figures 2G and 2G′). Moreover, the level of ectopic ptc is higher in hib<sup>Δ6</sup> mutant cells than in neighboring hib<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 2G″),

(G) Eye discs expressing indicated HA-tagged Ci deletion mutants with eq-Gal4 were immunostained with HA (red) and Ci (blue) antibodies. The MF is demarcated by the elevation of endogenous Ci (arrowheads). Of note, HA-Ci703 was not stained by the anti-Ci antibody, which recognizes a C-terminal region epitope deleted from Ci703 (Motzny and Holmgren, 1995).

suggesting that HIB attenuates Hh signaling outputs by downregulating the active forms of Ci<sup>FL</sup>.

Of note, *hib*<sup>Δ6</sup> mutant cells near the junction between the A/P and D/V boundaries did not accumulate Ci<sup>FL</sup> (indicated by an asterisk in Figure 2F′). One possibility is that perdurance of residual HIB in *hib* mutant cells could be responsible for Ci degradation in this region. Alternatively, a HIB-independent mechanism might act redundantly with HIB to degrade active forms of Ci in response to high levels of Hh.

HIB Promotes Ci Degradation by Binding to Its N- and C-Terminal Domains

The N- and C-terminal regions of HIB contain a MATH and a BTB domain, respectively (Figure 3B). Several recent studies revealed that BTB domain-containing proteins interact with Cul3 through their BTB domains and function as substrate recognition subunits for Cul3-based E3 ubiquitin ligases (Pintard et al., 2004). Therefore, we carried out biochemical experiments to assess whether HIB interacts with Ci and Cul3. Coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments showed that Myc-tagged full-length Ci (Myc-Ci<sup>FL</sup>) formed a complex with Flag-tagged HIB (Flag-HIB) in S2 cells; however, a stable complex was detected only when S2 cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 3C, compare lanes 2 and 6), consistent with the observation that HIB promotes proteasome-dependent Ci<sup>FL</sup> degradation (Figure 1K). In contrast, the N-terminal HIB fragment containing the MATH domain (Flag-MATH) formed a stable complex with Myc-Ci<sup>FL</sup> regardless of MG132 treatment (Figure 3C, compare lanes 3 and 7), whereas the C-terminal fragment containing the BTB domain (Flag-BTB) failed to bind Myc-Ci<sup>FL</sup> (Figure 3C, lanes 4 and 8).

To map the HIB-interacting domain(s) in Ci, Myc-tagged Ci deletion mutants were transfected into S2 cells with Flag-HIB, followed by CoIP. As shown in Figure 3D, both the N- and C-terminal Ci fragments

Figure 4. HIB Interacts with Cul3 to Promote Ci Ubiquitination and Degradation

(B) Autoradiogram of in vitro translated and $^{35}$S-labeled Cul3 bound to GST-HIB or GST-BTB. Equal amounts of GST and GST fusion proteins were used.

(C) In vivo ubiquititation of CiN promoted by HIB. Myc-CiN was immunoprecipitated from S2 cells expressing the indicated proteins and treated with MG132, followed by Western blot with HA antibody to detect conjugated HA-Ub. Roc1a was also included in the transfection (not shown). Cell lysates were immunoblotted with Myc antibody to monitor the level of Myc-CiN (bottom panel). Loading was normalized according to Myc-CiN level.

(D–E′) Wing discs overexpressing Cul3 alone (D) or Cul3 plus HIB (E and E′) were immunostained to show the expression of Ci$^{\mathrm{FL}}$ (red) and ptc-lacZ (blue). Coexpression of Cul3 with HIB resulted in more dramatic downregulation of Ci$^{\mathrm{FL}}$ near the A/P boundary (arrow in [E]; compare with Figure 1I) and more complete blockage of ptc-lacZ expression (arrow in [E′]; compare with Figure 1I′).

(F–F″) A wing disc carrying cul3$^{gtf2}$ clones and expressing two copies of UAS-Flag-HIB with MS1096 were immunostained to show the expression of Ci$^{\mathrm{FL}}$ (red) and GFP (green). cul3 mutant cells are marked by the lack of GFP expression. cul3 mutant cells near the A/P boundary accumulated high levels of Ci even when HIB was overexpressed (arrows).

(Myc-CiN and Myc-CiC) pulled down Flag-HIB, whereas the middle region of Ci containing the Zn finger DNA binding domain and dCBP binding domain (Myc-CiΔNC1) showed little or no interaction with Flag-HIB. GST pull-down experiments confirmed that both CiN and CiC interact with HIB through the MATH domain (Figure 3E). Finally, both HIB-FL and MATH, but not BTB, interact with the N- and C-terminal regions of Ci in yeast (Figure 3F), demonstrating that HIB directly binds two distinct domains of Ci through its MATH domain.

To assess whether the HIB-interacting domains mediate Ci degradation in vivo, we expressed various HA-tagged Ci deletion mutants lacking either the N-terminal (HA-CiΔN1 and HA-CiΔN2) or the C-terminal (HA-Ci703) HIB binding domain, or both (HA-CiΔNC1 and HA-CiΔNC2) in eye discs with eq-Gal4. Ci mutants lacking either the N- or C-terminal HIB binding domain were still degraded posterior to the MF; however, Ci mutants lacking both HIB binding domains were stabilized (Figure 3G), suggesting that either the N- or the C-terminal domain alone can target Ci$^{\mathrm{FL}}$ for HIB-mediated degradation.

HIB Forms a Complex with Cul3 and Promotes Ci Ubiquitination and Degradation through Cul3

To determine whether HIB forms a complex with Cul3, S2 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged Cul3 plus HA-tagged full-length HIB (HA-HIB) or its BTB-containing fragment (HA-BTB). As shown in Figure 4A, Flag-Cul3 was coimmunoprecipitated with both HA-HIB and HA-BTB. In addition, in vitro translated Cul3 was specifically pulled down by GST-HIB or GST-BTB (Figure 4B), suggesting that HIB interacts with Cul3 through its BTB domain.

To determine whether HIB promotes Ci$^{\mathrm{FL}}$ degradation through Cul3, we overexpressed HIB in wing discs carrying cul3 mutant clones. HIB failed to downregulate Ci$^{\mathrm{FL}}$ in cul3 mutant cells near the A/P boundary (Figures 4F–4F″). On the other hand, coexpressing Cul3 with HIB facilitated Ci$^{\mathrm{FL}}$ degradation at the A/P boundary (Figure 4E), leading to near complete blockage of ptc-lacZ expression (Figure 4E′). Of note, overexpression of Cul3 alone slightly stabilized Ci$^{\mathrm{FL}}$ in A compartment cells both close to and distant from the A/P compartment boundary (Figure 4D), likely due to a squelching effect whereby excess amounts of Cul3 titrated out other components (such as BTB protein or Roc1) of the E3 ligase, thus interfering with the assembly of functional E3 ligase complexes.

To determine whether a HIB-Cul3 complex promotes Ci ubiquitination, we carried out an in vivo ubiquitination assay (see Experimental Procedures). As shown in Figure 4, HIB promotes CiN ubiquitination in S2 cells, likely through endogenous Cul3 (Figure 4C, lane 3).

Figure 5. Sufu Interferes with HIB-Mediated Ci Degradation

(A–D) Ci<sup>FL</sup> expression in a wild-type wing disc (A) or wing discs expressing UAS-Myc-Sufu (B), two copies of UAS-Flag-HIB (C), or two copies of UAS-Flag-HIB plus UAS-Myc-Sufu (D) with MS1096.

(E) Sufu and MATH compete for binding to Ci. S2 cells were transfected with Myc-Ci together with fixed amount of Flag-MATH and increasing amounts of Flag-Sufu (lanes 3–4) or fixed amount of Flag-Sufu and increasing amounts of Flag-MATH (lanes 6 and 7). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody and immunoblotted with Myc or Flag antibody (top panels). Cell lysates were also directly immunoblotted with Flag antibody (bottom panels). Open arrowheads indicate IgG, and the asterisk indicates a nonspecific band.

---

Cotransfection of a dominant-negative form of Cul3, Cul3<sup>KR</sup> (Wu et al., 2005), reduced HIB-mediated CiN ubiquitination (Figure 4C, lane 8), whereas coexpression of a wild-type Cul3 enhanced CiN ubiquitination (Figure 4C, lane 6). Consistent with HIB bridging Ci with Cul3, the HIB MATH or BTB domain alone failed to induce CiN ubiquitination (Figure 4C, lanes 4 and 5) or suppress Ci<sup>FL</sup> accumulation in *hib*<sup>Δ6</sup> cells (Figures S4B and S4C). Moreover, overexpressing MATH in wing discs stabilized Ci<sup>FL</sup> near the A/P boundary (data not shown), suggesting that the MATH domain alone behaves in a dominant-negative fashion.

Sufu Protects Ci from HIB-Mediated Degradation

Hh stimulates the maturation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> into a short-lived nuclear transcriptional activator, whereas Sufu opposes this step by interacting with Ci<sup>FL</sup> (Ohlmeyer and Kalderon, 1998). Indeed, mutations in Sufu increase Hh target gene expression but destabilize Ci<sup>FL</sup> (Ohlmeyer and Kalderon, 1998). Conversely, overexpressing Sufu stabilized Ci<sup>FL</sup> near the A/P compartment boundary (compare Figures 5A and 5B). We noticed that like HIB, Sufu also binds both the N- and C-terminal regions of Ci (Methot and Basler, 2000; Monnier et al., 1998; Q.Z. and J.J., unpublished data), raising the possibility that Sufu binding may stabilize Ci<sup>FL</sup> by excluding HIB. We therefore carried out experiments to determine whether Sufu and HIB bind competitively to Ci<sup>FL</sup>. As shown in Figure 5E, increasing the amount of Sufu diminished the amount of MATH immunoprecipitated by Ci<sup>FL</sup> and vice versa. In wing discs, coexpressing Sufu prevents Ci<sup>FL</sup> degradation induced by overexpressed HIB (Figure 5D). Hence, Ci<sup>Act</sup>, which presumably dissociates from Sufu, becomes short-lived because it is more accessible to HIB-mediated degradation.

Loss of HIB Enhances the Overgrowth Caused by an Activated Form of Ci

Hh prevents Ci phosphorylation (Chen et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2005), which not only blocks Slimb-mediated proteolysis but also contributes to the activation of Ci<sup>FL</sup> (Wang et al., 1999). Our finding that HIB downregulates Ci<sup>Act</sup> in Hh-receiving cells implies that it may promote Ci degradation independent of Ci phosphorylation. Indeed, Ci<sup>-3P</sup>, which lacks three PKA sites in its C-terminal region and thus is unable to undergo sequential phosphorylation by PKA, GSK3, and CKI, is still degraded by HIB in eye discs posterior to the MF (Figures 6A–6A′′). Misexpression of Ci<sup>-3P</sup> in wing discs activated Hh target genes in both A and P compartments and caused enlargement of wing discs due to overgrowth (Figure 6C). Removal of HIB in wing discs expressing Ci<sup>-3P</sup> greatly enhanced the overgrowth phenotype (compare Figure 6D to Figure 6C). Strikingly, *hib* mutant cells expressing Ci<sup>-3P</sup> formed tumor-like overgrowths (Figures 6D and 6E). In addition, *hib* mutant cells accumulated higher levels of Ci<sup>-3P</sup> (Figures 6E and 6E′) and exhibited enhanced Hh pathway activation, as indicated by higher levels of ectopic Ptc (Figure 6E′′). Hence, loss of *hib* synergizes with Ci<sup>-3P</sup> to induce wing overgrowth.

HIB is Localized in the Nucleus

Our data so far suggest that HIB can target the active forms of Ci for degradation. As Ci<sup>Act</sup> is thought to act in the nucleus, we went on to examine whether HIB also resides in the nucleus. We expressed Flag-HIB either in wing discs or eye discs posterior to the MF and monitored the subcellular localization of HIB by immunostaining with a Flag antibody. We marked the nuclei with either anti-Elav antibody, which stains the nuclei of differentiating neurons in eye discs, or anti-NPCP

antibody, which recognizes a nuclear pore complex protein. As shown in **Figures 1H–1H"** and **Figure S5**, Flag-HIB exhibited punctate staining mainly in the nucleus in both wing and eye discs. A similar subcellular localization has been observed for the mammalian homolog of HIB (**Kwon et al., 2006**). Hence, the subcellular localization of HIB suggests that HIB promotes ubiquitination and degradation of Ci in the nucleus.

### HIB/SPOP Regulates Degradation of Gli Proteins

The regulation of Ci/Gli in Hh signaling is largely conserved between *Drosophila* and vertebrates (**Jia and Jiang, 2006**). There are multiple HIB homologs in vertebrates (**Figure S1G**). Mouse SPOP protein shares 79% amino acid sequence identity with HIB. To determine whether SPOP can degrade Ci in place of HIB, we expressed SPOP in eye discs carrying *hib* mutant clones. We found that *hib* mutant clones posterior to the MF no longer accumulated high levels of Ci<sup>FL</sup> when they expressed SPOP (**Figures 7A–7A"**), suggesting that SPOP degrades Ci<sup>FL</sup> in the absence of HIB.

To further explore whether HIB/SPOP represents a conserved regulator of the Ci/Gli family of transcription factors, we tested whether Gli proteins could be degraded by HIB/SPOP in a way similar to Ci. Gli2 and Gli3 are the primary transcriptional effectors of the vertebrate Hh signaling pathway (**Jia and Jiang, 2006; Stamataki et al., 2005**). When expressed in eye discs with eq-Gal4, both Gli2 and Gli3 were selectively degraded posterior, but not anterior, to the MF (**Figures 7B and 7C**). To determine whether HIB is responsible for degrading Gli proteins posterior to the MF, we expressed Gli2 and Gli3 in eye discs carrying *hib* mutant clones. Indeed, both Gli2 and Gli3 were stabilized in *hib* mutant cells posterior to the MF, as was the case for Ci<sup>FL</sup> (**Fig-

Figure 7. Downregulation of Ci/Gli by HIB/SPOP Prevents Aberrant Hh Pathway Activity Posterior to the MF, which Is Essential for Normal Eye Development

(A–A′) Flag-SPOP (blue) was expressed in an eye disc carrying $hib^{Δ6}$ clones marked by the lack of GFP expression (green). SPOP blocked $Ci^{FL}$ accumulation in $hib$ mutant cells posterior to the MF (arrows).

(B and C) Eye discs expressing Myc-Gli2 (B) or Myc-Gli3 (C) with eq-$Gal4$ were immunostained with Myc (red) and Ci (blue) antibodies. Both Myc-Gli2 and Myc-Gli3 are degraded posterior to the MF, which is marked by high levels of $Ci^{FL}$.

(D–E′) Myc-Gli2 (D and D′) or Myc-Gli3 (E and E′) was expressed using GMR-$Gal4$ in eye discs carrying $hib^{Δ6}$ clones. The discs were immunostained with Myc (red) and Ci (blue) antibodies. Both Myc-Gli2 and Myc-Gli3 were stabilized in $hib^{Δ6}$ clones, which are marked by $Ci^{FL}$ elevation (arrows).

(F–G′) $hib^{Δ6}$ clones were induced in wing discs expressing MS1096/UAS-Myc-Gli2, followed by immunostaining with GFP (green), Myc (red in [F] and [F′]), and Ptc (red in [G] and [G′]) antibodies. $hib$ mutant cells (arrows) accumulated higher levels of Myc-Gli2 and expressed higher levels of Ptc than neighboring $hib^+$ cells.

(H–K) Wild-type (H) adult eye or adult eyes expressing GMR-$Gal4$/UAS-$Ci^{FL}$ (I), GMR-$Gal4$/UAS-$Ci^{ΔN1}$ (J), or GMR-$Gal4$/UAS-$Ci^{ΔNC1}$ (K).

(L–O) Adult eyes carrying $hib$ mutant clones alone (L), or carrying $hib$ mutant clones and expressing GMR-$Gal4$/UAS-$Ci^{FL}$ (M), GMR-$Gal4$/UAS-$Ci^{-3P}$ (N), or GMR-$Gal4$/UAS-Gli2 (O).

(P) A model for regulating Ci by dual ubiquitination systems. In the absence of Hh, $Ci^{FL}$ undergoes sequential phosphorylation by PKA, GSK3, and CKI. Hyperphosphorylation recruits Slimb-Cul1-based E3 ligase that promotes proteolytic processing of $Ci^{FL}$ to generate C-terminally truncated $Ci^{Rep}$. Hh prevents Ci phosphorylation and induces maturation of $Ci^{FL}$ into $Ci^{Act}$. $Ci^{Act}$ activates Hh target genes and HIB. HIB-Cul3-based E3 ligase binds $Ci^{Act}$ and promotes its ubiquitination, followed by proteasome-mediated degradation. Sufu opposes the conversion of $Ci^{FL}$ into $Ci^{Act}$ and stabilizes Ci by blocking HIB-Ci interaction.

suggest that failure to degrade Ci by perturbing the HIB activity either in cis or in trans leads to aberrant Hh signaling and abnormal eye development. We noticed that eye carrying $hib$ mutant clones only exhibited mild roughness (Figure 7L), although endogenous Ci was accumulated posterior to the MF. A likely explanation is that additional mechanism(s) may exist to restrict Hh signaling activity posterior to the MF and such a mechanism(s) can be overcome by excess amount of Ci provided exogenously.

Discussion

In this study, we identify HIB as a negative regulator of the Hh pathway and provide genetic and biochemical evidence that HIB is the substrate recognition component of a Cul3-based ubiquitin ligase that binds multiple regions of Ci to catalyze its ubiquitination, followed by proteasome-mediated degradation. Interestingly, Hh induces $hib$ transcription, and thus, HIB-mediated down-regulation of Ci forms a negative feedback loop to modulate Hh signaling responses. In conjunction with previous studies, our results demonstrate that Ci is regulated by dual ubiquitination systems that act in two distinct signaling states (Figure 7P). In the absence of Hh, the Slimb-Cul1-based ubiquitin ligase targets $Ci^{FL}$ for proteolytic processing to generate $Ci^{Rep}$, and this process requires prior phosphorylation of $Ci^{FL}$ by PKA, GSK3, and CKI. In the presence Hh, Ci phosphorylation is inhibited and Slimb-Cul1-mediated Ci processing is blocked. Hh further induces nuclear translocation and maturation of $Ci^{FL}$ into $Ci^{Act}$, which activates Hh target
genes and concomitantly induces the production of HIB. The HIB-Cul3-based E3 ligase then binds and targets Ci<sup>Act</sup> for ubiquitination and degradation. The subcellular distribution of HIB is consistent with its acting in a nuclear E3 complex that targets nuclear Ci for degradation in Hh responding cells.

Although our observations support the idea that HIB targets Ci<sup>Act</sup> to downregulate Hh responses, we do not intend to suggest that HIB-Cul3 exclusively regulates Ci<sup>Act</sup>. As a matter of fact, we find that Ci703, which is similar to Ci<sup>Rep</sup>, can be degraded by HIB (Figure 3G), raising the possibility that HIB/SPOP could also modulate Hh signaling in certain development contexts, such as vertebrate limb development, that are regulated only by the repressor form of Ci/Gli. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that Ci<sup>Act</sup> is a better substrate for HIB because (1) it is nuclear and (2) it may dissociate from Sufu or bind Sufu less tightly than latent forms of Ci<sup>FL</sup>.

Neither do we rule out the possibility that a partially redundant mechanism(s) may exist that targets Ci for degradation in Hh-responding cells. We notice that HIB expression is downregulated near the D/V boundary (Figure 1B) and that *hib* mutant cells near the junction between the A/P and D/V boundaries failed to accumulate Ci<sup>FL</sup> (Figure 2F'). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that residual HIB in *hib* mutant cells could be responsible for degrading Ci, these observations raise the possibility that a HIB-independent mechanism may exist to degrade Ci<sup>Act</sup> in response to high thresholds of Hh.

The HIB-Cul3-based regulatory mechanism may provide a means to regulate the strength and/or duration of Hh pathway activity in a spatially or temporally regulated manner. It may also provide a mechanism to terminate Hh signaling in certain developmental contexts, as appears to be the case in *Drosophila* eye development. During *Drosophila* eye development, Hh signaling is required for the initiation and progression of the MF ([Treisman and Heberlein, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(98)70453-8)). Although Hh is expressed in differentiating cells posterior to the MF, Hh target genes are not expressed in differentiating cells. We provide evidence that Hh signaling is downregulated through HIB-mediated degradation of Ci posterior to the MF. Furthermore, we demonstrated that termination of Hh signaling posterior to the MF is essential for normal eye development. Indeed, misexpression of truncated forms of Ci that are resistant to HIB-mediated degradation or removal of HIB resulted in rough eye phenotypes (Figures 7H–7O). Hence, during eye development, differentiating cells turn on HIB to prevent aberrant Hh signaling by degrading Ci, which is essential for normal eye development.

The HIB-Cul3-based regulatory mechanism we identify here is likely to be evolutionarily conserved and may play a more general role in fine-tuning Hh responses in various developmental contexts. Indeed, we find that both Gli2 and Gli3, the two primary transcription factors for the vertebrate Hh signaling pathway, are degraded by HIB in a fashion similar to Ci. There are multiple HIB homologs in vertebrates. For example, human and mouse each have two whereas zebrafish has three (Figure S1G). We have demonstrated that mouse SPOP can functionally replace HIB in degrading Ci. It would be interesting to determine whether

the other mouse HIB homolog, LOC76857, which shares with SPOP 94% and 83% identical amino acids in their MATH and BTB domains, respectively, can also functionally substitute for HIB, and whether the vertebrate homologs of HIB play any roles in modulating Hh responses in vertebrate development.

A recent study demonstrated that Gli proteins possess dual degradation signals, one regulated by Slimb/β-TRCP-Cu11 E3 ligase and the other by an unknown mechanism ([Huntzicker et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2006.03.009)). Moreover, perturbation of Gli degradation mechanisms appears to greatly potentiate the ability of Gli proteins to induce tumor formation in transgenic animals ([Huntzicker et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2006.03.009)). Similarly, we found that *hib* mutation greatly enhances the ability of an active form of Ci to induce disc overgrowth (Figure 6D). Our finding that HIB/SPOP also regulates Gli stability raises the exciting possibility that SPOP and its paralogs may act as tumor suppressors whose loss of function could synergize with aberrant Gli activation to induce tumor formation.

We also note that a recent study demonstrated that the Wnt pathway induces a Cul3-based ubiquitin ligase to attenuate pathway activity through degradation of the key pathway component Dishevelled ([Angers et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04823)). Our finding that the Hh pathway also induces a Cul3-based ubiquitin ligase to attenuate pathway activity extends the many interesting parallels between these two pathways ([Jia and Jiang, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.061); [Kalderon, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00784-2); [Lum and Beachy, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2004.07.015)) and suggests that similar mechanisms could be employed by other signaling pathways. Given the large number of BTB proteins present in the genomes of various species ([Stogios et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki485)), it should be fruitful to explore the potential roles of BTB-Cul3 E3 ligases in various signaling pathways.

While this manuscript was under review, Kent et al. published a paper online where they made independent observations that CG9924, which they named Roadkill, degrades Ci and attenuates Hh responses ([Kent et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2006.07.004)).

### Experimental Procedures

#### Mutations and Transgenes
I(3) 03477, *Df*(3R)Exel6171, *cul3<sup>gft2</sup>*, MS1096, eq-Gal4, ap-Gal4, GMR-Gal4, UAS-GFP, UAS-hh, UAS-HA-Ci<sup>3P</sup>, USA-Ci deletion mutants, UAS-Myc-Sufu, UAS-Flag-Cul3, Myc-Gli2, UAS-Myc-Gli3, *dpp-lacZ*, and *ptc-lacZ* have been described (Flybase; [Aza-Blanc et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00008-6); [Methot and Basler, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00009-8); [Ou et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00784-2); [Wang et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80038-0), [2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00008-6)). A HIB cDNA clone (RE34508, *Drosophila* DGC2 EST library) was obtained from Open Biosystems. This cDNA clone encodes the B isoform of CG9924 (CG9924-PB; Flybase). To construct UAS-HIB-RNAi, a genomic DNA fragment with the coding sequence for HIB amino acids 132–363 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and Xhol sites of pUAST vector with the corresponding cDNA fragment inserted in a reverse orientation between the Xhol and KpnI sites. Constructs expressing tagged HIB or its fragments were generated by placing the cDNA encoding for various portions of HIB between the BglII and Xhol sites of pUAST-Flag or pUAST-HA vector. To construct UAS-Flag-Spop, full-length SPOP cDNA was amplified by PCR from mouse E17 cDNA library (Clontech) and subcloned in the BglII and Xhol sites of the pUAST-Flag vector.

#### Generating *hib* Null Mutation by Gene Targeting
Ends-out homologous recombination was used to generate *hib* null mutation ([Gong and Golic, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00837-8)). Left and right arms of the targeting vector were prepared by PCR of ~4 kb fragments from genomic DNA

using two pairs of primers: 5′-CTCTGCGGCCGCAGAAATGCCGA CTGCAAAG-3′/5′-GGATGCATGCAGGTTCGAGGTTGACTCTAGC-3′ and 5′-AACAGGCGCCGCGCCGTACCGTTTATTGTTTCG-3′/5′-TGTAG GCGCGCCAACAACACTTCAGCTTTTG-3′. Transgenic flies carrying the targeting construct on the second chromosome were crossed to flies carrying heat-inducible FLP recombinase and I-SceI endonuclease and targeting events were mapped to the third chromosome and verified by Southern blot (Gong and Golic, 2003).

### Generating Clones of Marked Mutant Cells
Clones of mutant cells were generated by FLP/FRT-mediated mitotic recombination as described (Jiang and Struhl, 1995). Genotypes for generating clones are as follows: *hib* clones in eye discs with or without expressing UAS transgenes: *ey-flp*; (GMR-Gal4/ UAS transgenes); FRT82 *hib*<sup>46</sup>/FRT82 hs-Myc-GFP. *hib* clones in wing discs with or without expressing UAS transgenes: MS1096 hs-flp/(UAS-P35); (*UAS-hh* or *UAS-HACI*<sup>-3P</sup>); FRT82 *hib*<sup>46</sup>/FRT82 hs-Myc-GFP. *cul3* clones in wing discs expressing UAS-Flag-HIB: MS1096 hs-flp; *cul3*<sup>gft2</sup> FRT40/hs-Myc-GFP FRT40; UAS-Flag-HIB.9 + UAS-Flag-HIB.10/+.

### Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, and In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay
S2 cell culture, transfection, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis were performed with standard protocols as previously described (Zhang et al., 2005). In vivo ubiquitination assays were based on the protocol previously described (Wang and Li, 2006). Briefly, S2 cells were transfected in 10 cm plates with 6 μg UAS-Myc-CiN and 4 μg each of the following constructs: UAS-Flag-HIB or UAS-Flag-MATH or UAS-Flag-BTB, UAS-Flag-Cul3<sup>KR</sup> or UAS-Flag-Cul3, UAS-Roc1a, pMT-HA-Ub, and ub-Gal4. 24 hr after transfection, 700 μM CuSO4 was added to the medium for another 24 hr to induce HA-Ub expression. Cells were treated with 50 μM MG132 for 4 hr before harvesting. Cells were first lysed in 100 μl denaturing buffer (1% SDS/50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 0.5 mM EDTA/1 mM DTT). After incubation for 5 min at 100°C, the lysates were diluted 10× with lysis buffer and then subjected to coimmunoprecipitation with Myc antibody, followed by immunoblot analysis with HA antibody.

### Yeast Two-Hybrid Assay and GST Fusion Protein Pull-Down Assay
Various portions of Ci were fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain in the pAS2 vector, and HIB fragments were fused to the Gal4 activation domain in the pACT2 vector. The yeast strain AH109 was transformed with plasmids encoding the bait and prey proteins sequentially. Protein interactions were determined according to the standard protocol (Clontech). GST fusion proteins were produced in *E. coli*, and purified with glutathione agarose beads. GST fusion protein-loaded beads were incubated with either in vitro translated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins or cell lysates derived from S2 cells expressing epitope-tagged proteins at 4°C for 1.5 hr. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, followed by Western blot analysis or autoradiogram.

### Immunostaining and In Situ Hybridization
Immunostaining and in situ hybridization of imaginal discs were done with standard protocols (Jiang and Struhl, 1995). Antibodies used in this study: rat anti-Ci (2A) (gift form R. Holmgren), mouse anti-Ptc (gift from I. Guerrero), rabbit anti-βGal (Cappel), mouse anti-Flag (Sigma), mouse anti-HA (F7), mouse anti-Myc (9E10), mouse anti-NPCP (Berkeley Antibody Company, Richmond, CA), and rabbit anti-GFP (Santa Cruz).
