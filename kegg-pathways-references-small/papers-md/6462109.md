The glucosyl transferases involved in the biosynthesis of flavonol-3-triglucosides in *Pisum sativum* L. have been further purified and characterized. The reaction sequence is as follows:

Flavonol → flavonol-3-monoglucoside → flavonol-3-diglucoside → flavonol-3-triglucoside

The reaction kinetics suggested the involvement of three distinct glucosyl transferases which could be demonstrated after elution of the enzyme preparation from DE-52 with a linear KCl gradient. Each enzyme has been characterized as to its pH optimum, stability, substrate specificity, and \(K_m\). The results obtained show that the synthesis of flavonol triglucosides in *Pisum* involves three distinct and highly specific enzymes, and the kinetic data present an explanation for the lack of accumulated mono- and diglucoside derivatives *in vivo*.

Recently the biosynthesis of the C₁₅ flavonoid skeleton has been intensively investigated and the essential facts are now well established (1, 2). Subsequent modifications of the flavonoid skeleton have been characterized, mostly from studies *in vitro* of glucosylation and acylation reactions. The flavonoid glycosides are synthesized by transfer of glucose, rhamnose, apiose, or arabinose from pyrimidine nucleotide donors (3–7). In those flavonoids which possess di- or triglucoside residues, the sugars are added sequentially, and specific enzymes catalyze the individual reactions (5–7). Thus sequential glucosylation has been established from both genetic (8) and enzymological studies.

The major flavonoids of *Pisum sativum* L. are kaempferol-3-triglucoside (KTG),² its *p*-coumaroyl ester (aKTG), quercetin-3-triglucoside (QTG), and its *p*-coumaroyl ester (aQTG) (9). In an earlier publication, we reported a hydroxycinnamoyl:CoA transferase involved in the biosynthesis of the *p*-coumaroyl derivatives of KTG and QTG (10). Recently, we demonstrated a UDP-glucose:glucosyltransferase which catalyzes the glucosylation of kaempferol and quercetin in the 3-position to form the 3-O-triglucoside derivative. The reaction proceeds from the aglycone via mono- and diglucoside intermediates and the triglucoside is formed from any of the less substituted derivatives (11).

The synthesis of 3-O-triglucosides in *Pisum* is particularly interesting because the intermediate mono- and diglucosides do not accumulate in the tissues (9). However, both intermediates are found *in vitro* (11). Thus the limited evidence indicates that synthesis of the triglucoside is a stepwise process as proposed in Fig. 1, but an explanation for the accumulation of only the triglucosides in the intact tissue is not readily apparent.

In this manuscript we report on the isolation, partial purification, and

characterization of three distinct flavonol:glucosyl transferase enzymes, and an analysis of the kinetic data suggests an explanation for the absence of the mono- and diglucosides *in vivo*.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Kaempferol (KAE), quercetin (QAE), naringenin, naringin, rutin, UDP-glucose, ADP-glucose, TDP-glucose, GDP-glucose, Sephadex G-25, G-100, Sigmacell Type 20 microcrystalline cellulose were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. UDP-[¹⁴C]glucose (UL, 310 mCi/mmol) was obtained from ICN and, after dilution with unlabeled UDP-glucose to the desired specific activity, was used without further purification. DEAE-Cellulose (DE-52) was purchased from Whatman Company. All other chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from commercial sources.

Preparation of substrates. Kaempferol-3-O-monoglucoside (KMG), quercetin-3-O-monoglucoside (QMG), KTG, and QTG were prepared as described previously (10, 11). Kaempferol-3-O-digluoside (KDG) was synthesized by glucose transfer to KMG utilizing enzyme II (see Results). The reaction mixture was processed as described for KTG purification.

Plant material. Seeds of *Pisum sativum* L. var. "Alaska" were purchased locally from Ferry Morse. The seeds were imbibed for 12 h in tap water, then were planted in a perlite, vermiculite, soil mix (1:1:1) and were kept under continuous illumination (1500 erg·cm⁻²) at 25°C. When the plants were 5 cm tall (5–7 days) the top 3 cm were removed for enzyme extraction.

Enzyme extraction and purification. Thirty grams of pea seedlings were frozen in liquid N₂ and ground in a mortar. The powder was allowed to thaw in 150 ml of 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 7.7, containing 20 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (βME), after which the mixture was stirred for 45 min at 4°C. The extract was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and was centrifuged at 40,000g for 30 min. The clear yellow supernatant solution contained the enzymes of interest. Fractionation of the crude extract was done with solid ammonium sulfate. The 40–75% saturation pellet was redissolved in a minimal volume of 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 20 mM βME and after clarification by centrifugation, was used as the ammonium sulfate fraction. For some characterization studies, the ammonium sulfate fraction was first desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5 × 30 cm). For further purification, the ammonium sulfate fraction was chromatographed on Sephadex G-100 (2.5 × 30 cm) in 0.01 M phosphate-βME buffer and 5-ml fractions were collected; the absorbance at 280 nm was monitored for protein, and every second fraction was assayed for transferase activity. Those fractions containing activity were pooled and the entire volume was chromatographed on a DE-52 column (1.5 × 15 cm). The column was first washed with buffer then with a stepwise gradient of 100 ml of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 M KCl; 5-ml fractions were collected, and each was assayed for activity.

For the separation of the transferase enzymes, the crude extract was fractionated as described above and either desalted on Sephadex G-25 or partially purified on Sephadex G-100 and subsequently applied to the DE-52 column. The latter was washed with 100 ml 0.01 M phosphate-βME buffer. The enzymes were separated with a 500-ml, linear KCl gradient of 0–0.1 M, and 5-ml fractions were collected. The same purification procedure was followed for the isolation of each glucosyltransferase. Protein was determined according to Bradford (12) using the Bio-Rad protein reagent.

Enzyme assay. The standard reaction mixture for glucosyltransferase activity consisted of 50 nmol of acceptor (kaempferol (KAE) was dissolved in 5 μl ethylene glycol monomethyl ether; KMG and KDG were dissolved in water), 100 nmol UDP-[¹⁴C]glucose (UL, sp act 0.3 μCi/μmol), 2.5 μmol potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and 50 μl of enzyme in a total volume of 70 μl. The reaction was started by addition of enzyme and incubation was at 30°C for various time periods according to the particular experiment (see Results). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 vol of absolute ethanol, and the protein was removed by centrifugation. The pellet was washed with 67% ethanol, and the combined supernatants were streaked on Sigmacell, TLC plates. Ten nanomoles

of unlabeled KMG, KDG, and KTG was added as carrier and the plates were developed ascending in 1% HCl. A strip of Whatman No. 3 chromatograph paper was attached to the top of the plate so that the solvent could overflow down the backside and after 1.5 h maximum separation of the products was obtained. Each band was located under uv and was scraped into a scintillation vial containing 5 ml of cocktail (666 ml toluene, 333 ml Triton X-100, 0.2 g POPOP, and 11 g PPO/liter) and counted.

The standard reaction mixture was used for enzyme assay during the purification and isolation of the individual transferases and for the determination of acceptor molecule specificity. For the study of glucose donor specificity, a modified, nonradioactive assay procedure was followed. The reaction mixture consisted of 100 nmol of acceptor, 200 nmol glucose donor (ADP-, GDP-, TDP-, or UDP-glucose), 5 μmol potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and 100 μl of enzyme in a final volume of 140 μl. The incubation time was extended to 3 h at 30°C. The reaction was stopped and processed as described above except that carrier kaempferol glucosides were not added. After chromatography in 1% HCl the products could be visualized under 366 nm uv and were eluted from the cellulose with 80% MeOH. The cellulose was removed by filtration. The MeOH was concentrated to 0.5 ml and the concentration of product was determined spectrophotometrically at 355 nm (10).

RESULTS

When a crude enzyme extract from week-old, light-grown pea seedlings was incubated with KAE and UDP-

${}^{[14}\mathrm{C}]$glucose, three different glucosylated derivatives could be detected. These derivatives differed in chromatographic properties and were identified as KMG, KDG, and KTG (11). Similarly, in incubations with the extract and KMG instead of KAE as glucose acceptor molecule, KDG and KTG were produced. As expected, where KDG was the initial acceptor molecule, only KTG accumulated. Thus, the flavonol:glucosyltransferase in pea extracts was able to catalyze the glucosylation of the aglycone as well as the mono- and diglucoside derivatives. Table I summarizes the extent of ${}^{[14}\mathrm{C}]$glucose incorporation into glucosides with each of the potential acceptor molecules. In experiments where the pea extract had been denatured (heat or alcohol) or where either the glucose acceptor or donor molecule was absent, no incorporation of label was detected.

**Properties of the glucosylating enzyme.** For preliminary characterization of the transferase, extracts were fractionated with ammonium sulfate and purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and then by ion exchange on DEAE-cellulose (see Materials and Methods for details). When a stepwise increase in salt concentration was used to elute the activity from DEAE, all the glucosylating activity was removed with 0.1 M KCl. This purification procedure

Note. The reaction mixture contained acceptor substrate (25 nmol), UDP-${}^{[14}\mathrm{C}]$glucose (100 nmol, 0.3 μCi/μmol), 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3 (2.5 μmol), and 50 μl of enzyme (KCl eluate from DE-52) in a total volume of 70 μl. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30°C.

FIG. 2. Time course for the glucosylation of KAE by the enzyme preparation eluted from DE-52 with 0.1 M KCl. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.5 μmol KAE, 1 μmol UDP-[¹⁴C]glucose (UL, sp act 0.3 μCi/μmol), 25 μmol potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and 0.5 ml enzyme in a total volume of 0.7 ml. Aliquots of 25 μl were removed every 5 min and processed as described under Materials and Methods.

resulted in an 11-fold increase in the rate of KAE to KTG glucosylation per milligram protein as determined by the total radioactivity incorporated into the glucosylated products.

The partially purified glucosyltransferase activity showed no requirements for substrates or cofactors other than the acceptor flavonol molecule and the nucleotide sugar donor. This finding agrees with reports of flavonoid-glucosyltransferase activities from other tissues (7, 13, 14). Although a detectable stimulation of activity by divalent cations, in particular Mg²⁺, has been reported for one anthocyanin glucosylating activity (15) we have tested the effect of various concentrations of divalent cations on the rate of flavonol glucosylation in peas but have found neither inhibitory nor stimulatory effects within near-physiological ranges (0.1–10 mM). Furthermore, chelating agents such as EDTA and EGTA failed to alter the activity significantly. Extensive dialysis of the enzyme extracts did not result in loss of activity, further substantiating the lack of a cofactor requirement.

Upon storage of the partially purified preparation (DE-52 batch elution) at room temperature or at –15°C, there was a rapid loss of activity (80% decrease in 36 h). However, the glucosylating activity remained stable for approximately 2 weeks when stored at 4°C.

A limited analysis of substrate specificity was carried out with the DEAE eluate. Besides kaempferol, the partially purified enzyme was able to glucosylate the other flavonols most commonly found in higher plants, quercetin and myricetin. In all three cases, the mono-, di-, and triglucoside derivatives were produced, and the relative activity (based on total radioactivity in the products) was: KAE (100), QAE (75), MYR (66). On the other hand, incubations of the extract with pelargonidin (an anthocyanidin), naringenin or naringin (flavanones), and p-coumaric acid did not result in the incorporation of labeled glucose. Thus, the glucosyltransferase of peas appears to be specific for flavonols. The specificity for glucose donor in the glucosylation reaction is limited to pyrimidine nucleotides. Both UDP-glucose and TDP-glucose could be utilized as glucose donors and UDP-glucose resulted in a threefold higher rate of glucose incorporation into the products. No incorporation occurred with ADP-glucose or GDP-glucose as glucose donors.

The reaction was strongly inhibited by increasing concentrations of UDP in the reaction mixture. At 0.14 mM UDP, the overall reaction (i.e., KMG + KDG + KTG) was inhibited 10%; at 0.36 mM UDP, conversion to glucosides decreased by 70%, and at 1.43 mM UDP, the reaction was inhibited 89%.

That the rate of KAE glucosylation to KTG is not a simple linear relationship is demonstrated by Fig. 2, which shows the time course of products formation in a standard assay mixture. The initial rate of KMG formation is linear for a period of approximately 20 min and subsequently levels off. Simultaneously, the rate of KDG formation lags for approximately 30 min and then increases nearly linearly. The accumulation of KTG follows a very similar pattern although the initial lag phase is longer. The complex nature of KAE glucosylation to KTG suggests a sequential addition of sugars to the aglycone, mono-, and diglucoside intermediates. However, the independent nature of each glucosylation step is only suggested by this experiment.

From the time-course data presented, it might be expected that we are dealing

Figure 3 shows the elution profile of a DEAE-cellulose column when a linear KCl gradient was used to fractionate the proteins. Eluted first was an enzyme which catalyzed the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to KMG yielding KDG. A second fraction contained an enzyme which catalyzed the formation of KMG from the aglycone and finally a third enzyme was eluted which resulted in the synthesis of KTG from KDG. Each of the isolated transferases was unable to glucosylate the other two substrates.

The purification of each glucosyltransferase is summarized in Table II. The overall procedure resulted in a marked increase in total activity, but since the crude fraction likely contains low-molecular-weight compounds inhibitory to one or more of the enzymes, these substances would be removed during chromatography. In addition, total protein did not change during filtration.

Note. The purification procedure for the enzymes is described under Materials and Methods. For the purification of enzymes I and II, the ammonium sulfate fraction was run through a Sephadex G-100 column and subsequently applied to the DE-52. In the purification procedure for enzyme III, a Sephadex G-25 was used after ammonium sulfate. All assays were carried out as specified under enzyme assays and incubated for 30 min.

Each glucosyltransferase exhibited maximal activity between pH 8 and 9 in both KH₂PO₄ and glycine-NaOH buffers. However, the enzymes differed in their sensitivity to the nature of the buffer. Enzyme I showed similar activity in 0.2 M KH₂PO₄ and glycine but the levels of activity were lower in 0.2 M Tris-HCl. Similarly, enzyme II showed lower levels of activity in Tris but there was also a large difference in activity between the KH₂PO₄ and glycine buffers. Enzyme III, however, exhibited two peaks of activity, one at pH 7.6 in Tris and another at 8.3 in glycine, and the enzyme was equally active in either buffer.

The three enzymes also showed the typical increase in activity with increasing protein concentration. For enzymes I and III, the reaction was linear up to 5 μg of protein while for enzyme III, the activity was linear to at least 20 μg.

The analysis of substrate specificity exhibited by the transferases was limited because of the unavailability of various reactants, however a representative group of flavonoids was tested (Table III). In each case, the glucosyltransferases could only glucosylate a flavonol aglycone (enzyme I) or a flavonol-3-O-glucoside. However, the relative activity of each enzyme for the corresponding substrate showed distinct differences. For example, enzyme I showed the highest activity with QAE whereas enzyme III had the lowest activity with the QDG acceptor. Similarly, each enzyme could utilize UDP-glucose or TDP-glucose as glucose donors and were inactive with ADP-glucose and GDP-glucose.

For enzyme I, 0.4 mg of enzyme preparation from DEAE chromatography were incubated in 400 μl 50 mM KH₂PO₄, pH 7.3, with 150 nmol KAE and 300 nmol UDP-glucose at 30°C and aliquots were removed every 5 min. For enzyme II, 1 mg enzyme preparation was incubated as above with 200 nmol KMG and 400 nmol UDP-glucose, while for enzyme III, 0.3 mg of enzyme preparation was incubated with 100 nmol KDG and 200 nmol UDP-glucose.

Glucosylation of KAE to KTG showed similar general properties although each differed in a number of ways thereby emphasizing their unique nature.

The enzymes show a linear rate of product formation under the conditions of assay (Fig. 4). The reactions catalyzed by enzymes I and III are linear for at least 1 h, while the reaction with enzyme II is linear for 20 min.

The activity of each enzyme was measured between pH 6.0 and 10.0 (Fig. 5).

Note. 50 nmol of each substrate was incubated with 200 nmol UDP-glucose and 25 μmol KH₂PO₄, pH 7.3, in 70 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 1 h.

All three enzymes showed product inhibition with UDP, the common product in each reaction. For enzyme I, a 50% inhibition was observed at a UDP concentration of 1.1 mM. For enzyme II, 50% inhibition was at 1.75 mM and for enzyme III at 0.25 mM (Fig. 6).

Michaelis constants for both flavonol acceptor and glucose donor were determined for each enzyme. The determinations were made by measuring the initial reaction velocities at different concentrations of one substrate where the concentration of the second substrate was maintained at fixed, saturating levels (8). For enzyme I, the concentration of KAE was varied from 0.036 to 0.71 mM while that of UDP-glucose was fixed at 7.14 mM. Each reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30°C. Under these conditions, the initial velocity of KAE glucosylation increased with increasing KAE concentration up to 0.36 mM; at higher KAE levels, the initial reaction velocities decreased. Figure 7 shows the linear transformation of Hanes

(17) for the s-v curve. The apparent \(K_m\) for KAE under these conditions was 90 μM (9.0 × 10⁻⁵ M). The Michaelis constant

apparent \( K_m \) for acceptor (KMG) was 4  
\( \mu M \) (\( 4 \times 10^{-6} \) M) and for donor (UDP-glucose) it was 640 \( \mu M \). Similarly, the \( K_m \) for  
acceptor and donor in the reaction catalyzed by enzyme III was 8 (\( 8 \times 10^{-6} \) M) and  
800 \( \mu M \), respectively. No substrate inhibition was detected for either of these enzymes.

DISCUSSION

Enzymatic studies have supported the earlier idea that glycosylation is a terminal step in the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids. Consequently, it has been expected that a flavonol would be the original glucose acceptor for the synthesis of kaempferol and quercetin triglucosides in peas. This has been supported by the observation that dihydroflavonols, believed to be precursors of flavonols (1, 2), were not glycosylated by enzyme preparations able to glycosylate flavonols or anthocyanins. Evidence that the addition of sugars to flavonoids occurs in a sequential manner has come from enzymatic studies where it was shown that the formation of flavone, flavonol, and anthocyanin diglycosides involves two separate enzymes, one specific for the aglycone moiety, and another specific for the flavone or anthocyanin monoglycoside (7, 18). For the tissues where these enzymes have been studied, the accumulation of monoglycosides as normal constituents provides a pool of precursor molecules for further glycosylation by a second enzyme. In *Pisum sativum*, however, the intermediate mono- and diglycosides involved in the synthesis of triglucosides have only been detected in cell-free experiments (11).

The time course for the conversion to KTG provides evidence for the sequential addition of glucose residues. The initial KMG accumulation precedes production of KDG and similarly, KTG is formed only after KDG has accumulated. The pattern shown in Fig. 2 is very similar to what might be expected from the theoretical variation in reactant concentrations for a sequential series: A → B → C → D (19). Thus, one might expect that three different, but sequential reactions are involved in the production of KTG and the results

(a) = flavonol acceptor in mM; (b) UDP-glucose in mM; \( v \) = reaction velocity in nmol/min; \( a/v \) (●) and \( b/v \) (○) in mM × min × nmol\(^{-1}\). The sp act of UDP-[¹⁴C]glucose was 5000 cpm/nmol. The separated enzymes from DEAE chromatography were assayed under the following specifications: Enzyme I: for \( k_m \) of acceptor, KAE was varied from 0.036 to 0.71 mM at fixed 7.14 mM UDP-glucose; for \( k_m \) of donor, UDP-glucose was varied from 0.14 to 3 mM at fixed 0.36 mM KAE. The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30°C and initiated by addition of enzyme. Enzyme II: as for enzyme I, KMG was varied from 0.005 to 0.14 mM at 7.14 mM UDP-glucose; UDP-glucose was varied from 0.1 to 20 mM at 1 mM KMG. Incubations were for 5 min at 30°C. Enzyme III: KDG was varied from 0.01 to 0.15 mM at 7.14 mM UDP-glucose; UDP-glucose was varied from 0.2 to 5 mM at 1 mM KDG. Reactions as for enzyme I.

for UDP-glucose was similarly measured by varying the UDP-glucose concentration from 0.14–3.0 mM at 0.36 mM KAE. A non-saturating concentration of KAE was used because of the inhibition of glucosylation observed at higher flavonol acceptor concentrations.

For enzyme II, Michaelis constants were determined as above with the substrate concentration ranges shown in Fig. 7. The

of experiments described here demonstrate that the synthesis of KTG in *Pisum sativum* occurs by three, sequential, single-step transfers each catalyzed by a specific enzyme.

The glucosyltransferases identified in this work have very similar properties, but differ in ways which emphasize their unique nature. First, each enzyme shows absolute specificity for the glucose acceptor molecule. Thus, enzyme I glucosylates only aglycones and apparently only flavonols. Reports of other aglycone glycosylating enzymes have also demonstrated similar specificity for a class of flavonoids and there also appears to be a strict positional specificity for these glycosylations. Flavonols are known to occur with sugars at positions 3, 7, and 4′ on the C₁₅ nucleus (20), and the flavonoid glucosyl transferases thus far reported are specific for a single position on the aglycone (5, 7, 13–15). Accordingly, we have found only 3-O-glycosylation in *Pisum*. Enzyme II glucosylates only flavonol-3-O-monoglucosides and does not catalyze the glucosylation of aglycones. However, due to the unavailability of substrates we have not yet been able to make a thorough examination of specificity for the sugar residues found in monoglycosides. We have, however, found that enzyme II is unable to glucosylate quercetin-3-rhamnoside, thus, the specificity of the enzyme may involve both the flavonol and sugar residues. Enzyme III shows specificity for a flavonol-3-O-diglucoside acceptor. As with enzyme II, there also appears to be specificity for the glucose residues in the diglycoside since rutin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside) is not glucosylated. Therefore, all three glucosyl transferases from *Pisum* appear to be specific for flavonols and their 3-O-glucosides.

Second, each enzyme shows linearity with increasing protein concentration, linear course of reaction under the condition of assay, inhibition of UDP, and pH optima in the range of 8–8.5. However, the glucosyltransferases do differ in their sensitivity to UDP and in the activity in different buffers. For example, enzyme II is more strongly inhibited at low UDP concentrations than the other two, and it

shows two pH optima. Enzymes I and II show similar pH dependence but differ in the extent of inhibition by UDP. Whether the inhibition by UDP is due to a change on the equilibrium of the reaction or due to a direct effect on the individual enzymes cannot be ascertained from these experiments.

Third, the three glucosyltransferases show marked and important differences in kinetic properties. Enzyme I is the only enzyme which shows substrate inhibition at high acceptor concentrations, and in addition, the *K*ₘ for KAE is the highest of all three acceptor molecules. Significantly, the *K*ₘ’s for flavonol acceptor of enzymes II and III are 22- and 11-fold lower, respectively. Thus it is evident that the second and third enzymes in this pathway have very high affinities for their flavonol substrates, and perhaps the lack of accumulation of KMG and KDG *in vivo* may be explained by this fact. For example, as the monoglucoside is formed from the catalysis of the first enzyme, it is immediately glucosylated further by the second enzyme due to the latter’s higher affinity in relation to the first, and a similar situation would then occur for the next glucosylation step.

On the other hand, the *K*ₘ’s for donor UDP-glucose do not show the pronounced differences for the acceptors, although enzyme I again has the higher *K*ₘ. It is probable that UDP-glucose itself is not a regulatory substrate in these reactions as it is involved in numerous cellular processes and thus would not be limiting.

Although the kinetic differences between enzymes II and III and enzyme I may help explain the lack of intermediate glycoside accumulation *in vivo*, it is important to note that the aglycone itself also does not accumulate. In general, flavonoid aglycones appear not to accumulate in living tissue because they are highly toxic (21, 22). Thus, the relatively high *K*ₘ of enzyme I for KAE raises a question as to the actual *in vivo* condition of this enzyme. It has been postulated (23) that flavonoid glycosylating and acylating enzymes may be associated with membranes, in particular the tonoplast, and it might be that the synthesis of the flavonol agly-

cone occurs in a location associated with enzyme I and therefore would not be free to form pools.

In conclusion, the presence of three independent flavonoid glucosyltransferases in *Pisum* is clearly established. The *in vitro* properties of the enzymes help explain the nature of the pathway of KTG formation. However, it is apparent that further work is required before the intricate relationship of these enzymes *in vivo* can be fully elucidated.
