Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) binds to the pituitary GnRH receptor to activate signal transduction cascades that ultimately modulate gonadotropin biosynthesis. Comprehensive studies of the GnRH-activated gene program in the LβT2 gonadotrope cell line have greatly increased our knowledge of the number of early and intermediate gene transcripts that are modulated by GnRH. Among the classes of gene induced are several whose protein products provide feedback to various levels of signaling pathways, suggesting that gene induction forms an integral component of signal transduction and contributes to longer-timescale feedback and feedforward loops. High-throughput quantitative genomic studies, mathematical modeling and biochemical studies are beginning to delineate the organization and function of the signal-decoding and logic circuit modules of the gonadotrope's signal transduction network.

Normal endocrine physiology relies on the delivery of specific instructions to distant targets. The mechanism for addressing these instructions is based on stereochemically specific interactions between neurotransmitters or hormones and protein receptors on the target cells. GnRH is secreted by neurons in the hypothalamus, and the effects of GnRH are directed to the anterior pituitary gonadotrope by its interaction with the GnRH receptor, a heptahelical membrane protein. After receptor activation, the signal transduction network of the gonadotrope must reliably decode the instructions received to generate the appropriate rates of gonadotropin biosynthesis and secretion.

The basic principles underlying the transfer of specific instructions through the signal transduction pathways of the cell are poorly understood. Because many receptors activate the same signaling pathways and the number of pathways is limited, how can distinct instructions be transmitted? The answer to this question must lie in the design of the signal transduction network. One component of the biosynthetic response to activating the GnRH receptor involves modulating the activity of tertiary gonadotropin genes, such as those encoding the luteinizing hormone (LHβ) and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSHβ) β-subunits.

Connections between the GnRH receptor and the gonadotropin gene promoters are, however, unlikely to consist of straightforward linear chains of signaling proteins and primary gene products. Because there are a relatively few signaling components, it is hard to imagine how a linear signaling cascade would provide either the capacity to modulate a specific collection of genes by this particular receptor or the ability to vary the biosynthetic response elicited by different input patterns such as variations in GnRH pulse frequency. It is more likely that the activation of the GnRH receptor modulates tertiary gene expression through a network that provides the logical operators and pattern-decoding capabilities needed to discriminate different input stimuli.

The signal transduction and gene control mechanisms in the gonadotrope represent an area of intense investigation in many laboratories. Quantitative genomics approaches, especially high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), have facilitated studies of the GnRH regulation of several genes, many of which encode proteins that modulate cellular signaling. Recent results provide insight into the modular organization of a seamlessly integrated signaling and genetic network. In this review, we focus on advances in our understanding of the signal transduction and gene responses elicited by the interaction of GnRH and its type I receptor in the pituitary gonadotrope.

### GnRH signaling: a complex network

#### GnRH and its receptor
The decapeptide GnRH (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH₂) is the chief regulator of the reproductive system of mammals. GnRH is released in a pulsatile pattern by GnRH-producing neurons of the hypothalamus, and it binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) of 327–328 amino acids. The GnRH receptor, whose sequence has been highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, is a member of the heptahelical rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs (reviewed in Ref. [1]). It is unique among GPCRs in lacking an intracellular carboxyl (C)-terminus – a domain that in many other receptors contributes to internalization and desensitization ([2]; reviewed in Refs [3,4]).

Sixteen structural variants of GnRH have been identified in various vertebrate species, and as many as three can be expressed within the same species [5]. Additional GnRH receptors for other GnRH structural variants ('type II receptors') have been also identified in several vertebrate species [6]. Type II receptors are notable for

containing an intracellular C-terminal domain. The physiological role of these additional GnRH receptor subtypes remains to be determined [7,8].

**Signaling from the GnRH receptor to the nucleus**

When GnRH interacts with its receptor on the gonadotrope membrane, it stabilizes a conformational change in the receptor that promotes the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. The principal G protein activated by GnRH is a member of the Gq/11 subclass. G proteins of the Gi/o and Gs subclasses have been reported to be also activated by GnRH ([9]; reviewed in Ref. [1]); however, activation of G proteins other than Gq/11 is not found in all experimental systems, and the significance of these other G proteins to GnRH receptor signaling in the gonadotrope is unclear (reviewed in ref. [1]).

Although the signaling of GPCRs is specific to cell type, heterologous expression is valuable for generating hypotheses about additional signaling mediators. Many GPCRs have been found to couple to signaling pathways independently of their activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. For example, when the GnRH receptor is transfected into HEK293 cells it promotes cytoskeletal reorganization via the small G-protein Rac in a mechanism that does not involve heterotrimeric G-protein coupling [10].

Phospholipase Cβ is activated by Gq/11 G proteins [11] and catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P₃] and diacylglycerol (reviewed in Ref. [12]). Ins(1,4,5)P₃ mobilizes intracellular Ca²⁺, which activates conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms such as PKCβ and PKCβII, which are present in gonadotrope cell lines [13,14]. The initial phase of the Ca²⁺ increase results from a triggering of the Ins(1,4,5)P₃ receptor on intracellular stores, whereas the plateau phase depends on an influx of external Ca²⁺, which occurs predominantly via L-type voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ channels [12]. Phospholipase D and phospholipase A2 are sequentially activated by GnRH receptor signaling [15–17], probably via PKC (reviewed in Ref. [17]). Late release of diacylglycerol by phospholipase D [18] might cause the activation of Ca²⁺-independent PKC isoforms such as PKCδ or PKCε [19], the expression of which is itself rapidly induced by GnRH receptor activity in gonadotrope cells [20].

The GnRH receptor activates extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in a GnRH neuron cell line [21] and in transfected COS cells [22], but not in transfected HEK293 cells [21,23]. Dependence of ERK activation on the EGF receptor in αT3 gonadotrope cells has been found by one group [24], but not by another [25], and it possibly might be sensitive to the precise experimental cell culture conditions. Crosstalk between the GnRH receptor and the EGF receptor is mediated by metalloproteinases [21,26,27]. GnRH has been also found to stimulate the activation of lipid-directed kinases such as diacylglycerol kinase-ζ in LβT2 gonadotrope cells, a pathway that might contribute to sustained ERK activity [28]. Activation of ERK by the GnRH receptor requires localization of the receptor to low-density lipid rafts [29]. Activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases such

as ERK then translocate to the nucleus, activate transcription factors and mediate gene activity (reviewed in Refs [12,23,30,31]; Figure 1).

Mathematical simulation studies of cell signaling networks show that these networks can manifest emergent properties, such as bistability, that are independent of any specific components of the network [32]. In other words, in a complex signaling network the cellular response is generated by the distributed behavior of the network and not by the activation or suppression of any individual signaling component. This type of information processing system provides greater reliability in cellular signaling for a system in which, at the level of the single cell, the concentrations of individual signaling components are subject to considerable variation [33].

The connectivity map of gonadotrope signaling that is emerging from current pharmacological research provides evidence for the distributed activation of numerous signaling pathways. In conjunction with studies of other systems, short feedforward and feedback regulatory loops that control the responses of the network can now be suggested. For example, ERK has been shown to activate phospholipase A2 *in vitro* [34], and the arachidonic acid produced, together with diacylglycerol, might promote activation of PKC (reviewed in Ref. [17]). Because ERK itself is stimulated downstream of PKC, this pathway forms a potential feedforward loop that, by itself, would function to modify GnRH signaling in a manner sensitive to the relative time course of arachidonic acid and diacylglycerol production [35]. As described below, genomic studies have begun to delineate longer-timescale feedback loops.

**Genomic studies of GnRH modulated genes**

Most assays of signal transduction measure changes in the activity of a very few signaling components. In studying the behavior of the complex gonadotrope signaling network (Figure 1), this limitation makes it difficult to characterize the diverse molecular responses that occur after activation of the membrane receptor. Assays for global changes in cell signaling that are based on quantifying the resulting changes in early gene expression have been developed. This type of assay platform depends on refining and integrating genomic techniques to provide both high measurement accuracy and high sample throughput [36].

Microarrays allow the simultaneous study of thousands of transcripts for changes in expression (Box 1); however, microarrays have high false-positive and false-negative rates in comparison to traditional assays of gene expression, such as northern blot analysis, and are inaccurate in actually quantifying the gene expression changes [37]. Furthermore, because their expense and processing requirements limit the number of samples that can be analyzed, microarrays provide a restricted view of the gene changes that occur under varied experimental conditions. Understanding the gene responses elicited by activation of the GnRH receptor requires studying a complex physiological space involving various concentrations, durations and patterns of exposure that would not be feasible by using microarray assays alone.

Figure 1. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor-modulated signaling network. Activation of the GnRH receptor leads to the activation of at least two G-protein subtypes, $G_s$ and $G_q$. Signaling downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Active MAPKs translocate to the nucleus, resulting in activation of transcription factors and rapid induction of early genes. This figure illustrates the distributed and interconnected movement of information from the receptor to the genome. Adapted with permission from Ref. [1].

To increase the accuracy of microarray studies, Wurmbach et al. [38] have developed a focused cDNA array containing most known immediate early genes with triplicate representation of each transcript, coupled with a t-statistic based approach for identifying candidate regulated genes. {All candidates identified by this microarray approach have been confirmed and studied further by high-throughput qPCR assays.

The use of robotics for qPCR allows detailed time-course studies, such as determining the effects of variations in GnRH concentration on the expression of each transcript [38–40]. This integrated genomics assay platform for studying global changes in signal transduction can differentiate between subtle differences in stimuli, such as the differential effects of individual agonists acting at the same neurotransmitter receptor in brain cortex [41]. Using this approach to study the GnRH response in LβT2 cells, it has been found that the gene program induced is much broader and complex than was previously suspected.

### The GnRH gene network

Microarray experiments incorporating independent qPCR confirmation of all regulated genes have found that the expression of 44 genes increases within 1 h of GnRH exposure and that of 31 additional genes increases within 3–6 h of exposure in LβT2 cells (Ref. [38]; B.J. Eversole, T. Yuen and S.C.S., unpublished).

The main types of protein encoded by the transcripts induced by GnRH receptor activation are shown in Figure 2. The largest class of upregulated genes encodes transcription factors. The egr1 transcript had been previously reported to be induced by GnRH in the gonadotrope and studies suggest that its induction is required for subsequent activation of the LHβ promoter [42–44]. The microarray study [38] has now identified the modulation of several additional transcription factor genes that also might be important in the subsequent induction of tertiary genes such as that encoding LHβ. These factors include the immediate genes egr2, c-fos and klf4, and the secondary genes nab1 and nab2. Because consensus Egr2-binding sites are present in the LHβ promoter [1], there is a also potential role for egr2 induction in the control of this gonadotropin subunit.

Transcription factors acting at SP1 sites have been implicated in the activation of LHβ. One of the induced transcripts, klf4, is a member of the Sp/Xklf family of transcription factors [45]. Nab, in association with Egr1, has been reported to stimulate activation of the LHβ promoter [46]. In addition to nab1, which had been previously reported to be induced by GnRH in αT3-1 cells [47], the closely related gene nab2 is also induced. These results suggest that many protein-kinase-induced transcription factors in the gonadotrope can modulate

Box 1. Genomic techniques

Over the past few years, techniques that facilitate the simultaneous study of the relative expression of a large number of transcripts have been developed. Two complementary assay platforms are quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and microarrays (Figure I).

Microarrays are being widely applied to refine the classification of neoplasias and to elucidate the gene programs underlying various cellular processes. The number of publications in PubMed referring to microarrays increased exponentially from 2 in 1996 to 2300 in 2003. Microarrays are based on nucleic acid hybridization, where reverse-transcribed mRNA is fluorescently or radioactively labeled and hybridized to specific test sequences located at defined positions on a fixed substrate, such as a microscope slide. Fabrication techniques have evolved to enable ten thousand, or more, different transcripts to be assayed in one sample on a single microarray.

Either of two different experimental platforms, an oligonucleotide array or a custom printed cDNA array, is used for most microarray experiments. cDNA arrays are typically custom printed from PCR-generated amplicons. Probes from two samples, each labeled with different fluorophores, are hybridized simultaneously on one cDNA array. This competitive hybridization allows direct comparison of the relative gene expression in the two RNA samples within each array. Oligonucleotide arrays can be either printed from oligonucleotide libraries or synthesized *in situ* on the array using an adaptation of the technology developed for etching integrated circuits. This latter approach is the basis for the most common commercial microarray platform (Affymetrix). With regard to endocrine systems, microarrays enable a large number of transcripts to be studied but provide poor measurement accuracy and have significant practical limitations in the number of treatment conditions or time points that can be studied.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) allows more precise measurement of a limited number of genes in a large number of samples. qPCR relies on detecting a specific target DNA sequence by a PCR reaction and then quantifying the PCR product during each cycle of amplification by using fluorescent dye incorporation. From the amplification curves that result, the relative initial target concentration can be accurately determined. Specific detection systems, such as molecular beacons and TaqMan assays, rely on the detection of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. The PCR product can also be assayed by using the minor-groove-binding fluorescent dye SYBR green and standard oligonucleotides. The robotic instrumentation used for reaction set-up and assay handling can provide high sample capacity. High-throughput qPCR enables the accurate assay of dozens to hundreds of transcripts in thousands of RNA samples, facilitating the generation of statistically significant data comparing the effects of several experimental parameters.

Figure 2. Primary gene response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the gonadotrope. Shown is a summary of results obtained in real-time PCR studies of LβT2 cells exposed to GnRH for 1 h [38]. Only representative genes among the 44 that have been found to be regulated are shown. The largest group of genes induced encode transcription factors. Other categories of genes induced include those encoding cytoskeletal proteins and signal transduction modulators. IκB, inhibitor of κB; hsp30, heat shock protein 30; MKP1, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase 1; RGS2, regulator of G-protein signaling 2.

The induction of signaling modulators indicates that the gene network is an integral part of the signal transduction network: it creates long-timescale, negative-feedback loops progressing from GnRH signaling, through gene induction and protein synthesis, back to GnRH signaling (Figure 3).

In addition to its role in gonadotropin biosynthesis, GnRH induces activity changes in the signaling network that are responsible for modulating various cellular processes, such as gonadotropin secretion and membrane excitability. The rapid self-priming of the rat gonadotrope's secretory response to previous GnRH stimulation, in which a second GnRH pulse leads to an increase in gonadotropin secretion, has been known for more than three decades and is implicated in the surge of LH. Although the specific mechanism underlying priming is not known, it depends on gene induction and new protein synthesis [52]. These characteristics suggest that priming results from a similar 'genome to secretory signaling' feedforward loop. Thus, many gonadotrope functions, in addition to biosynthesis, are likely to be influenced by regulatory feedback from the nucleus to the signaling network.

Stimulation of the GnRH receptor activates several MAP kinases, including ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to the induction of early genes. Recent biochemical and genomic studies have begun to identify the dependence of the induction of specific early genes on individual kinases [14,44,53]. High-throughput

Figure 3. Long-timescale negative-feedback loops to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor signaling involving the transcription and translation of GnRH-induced inhibitory proteins. After GnRH stimulation, activation of the GnRH signaling network leads to the transcription and translation of different proteins that can feed back to the signaling pathway. Some examples of potential negative-feedback loops identified by genomic studies are shown. Induction of the inhibitor IκB decreases signaling by the transcription factor NFκB. RGS2 increases G-protein GTPase activity at Gα and inhibits Gα-mediated signaling. Induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) provides feedback suppression of MAPK activity. Induction of the small G-protein Kir/Gem could decrease the degree of Ca²⁺ influx through L-type Ca²⁺ channels. RGS2, regulator of G-protein signaling 2; PKC, protein kinase C; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; IκB: inhibitor of κB.

qPCR studies of global early gene induction coupled with inhibition of individual kinases suggest that the wiring of kinases to individual genes has characteristics of logic gates [53]. Some transcripts, such as c-jun for example, require both ERK and JNK activity for induction and thereby function in a fashion analogous to an 'AND' logic gate. It is possible to design gene induction circuits for all logical operators on the basis of the additivity or inhibitory activity of kinase-activated transcription factors at each promoter. Possible designs for the transcriptional mechanisms underlying AND and OR operators are shown in Figure 4. Such operators would provide switches that are sensitive to differences in the relative activity of different types of kinase.

Three component features of GnRH receptor stimulation might influence the specific biosynthetic response: concentration, frequency and pulse duration. To begin to elucidate the relationship among these input parameters and the gene program, the effects of varying levels of GnRH exposure have been quantified by high-throughput qPCR [40]. Measurement of the expression levels of transcripts induced by continuous GnRH exposure generates a characteristic time trajectory for each gene. Notably, it seems that varying the concentration of GnRH exposure affects only the level of gene induction,

Figure 4. Hypothetical design of 'OR' and 'AND' logic gates at the level of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and gene activation. An OR gate could be generated by a transcription factor that is activated by more than one type of MAP kinase, for example, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Activation of either MAP kinase would be sufficient to activate the transcription factor and induce gene transcription. An AND gate could result from a gene requiring the activation of two different transcription factors (e.g., TFA and TFB), which are in turn activated by different MAP kinases. In both cases, the transcription factors induce gene transcription after being activated via phosphorylation by the MAP kinases.

whereas the pattern of induction over time is similar at all concentrations of GnRH studied [40]. This indicates that the fractional occupancy of the receptor is closely coupled to the level of gene induction for each transcript studied.

Systems biology and the gonadotrope signaling network

An understanding of the behavior of networks as complex as gonadotrope signaling cannot be achieved merely by inspecting the connectivity diagram shown in Figure 1. Mathematical modeling, in combination with experimental testing, can help to clarify how various components of the GnRH system join together to control specific gene promoters and gonadotropin release [54,55]. The integration of high-throughput, global experimental assays and mathematical simulation is a fundamental tenet of the emerging discipline of systems biology [56–59] and will have an increasingly important role in studies of endocrine systems.

Although several mathematical models have been developed to describe the relationship between the frequency of GnRH receptor activity and LH secretion (reviewed in Ref. [1]), the mechanisms underlying the frequency dependence of LH release are likely to be distinct from those that control gonadotropin gene synthesis. A mathematical model to explain gonadotropin gene induction has been developed that correlates the concentration of GnRH to the activity of RNA polymerase [40]. The analysis of detailed measurements obtained in LβT2 cells using this model have indicated that the delay in initial gene activation after GnRH stimulation is independent of GnRH concentration.

The biosynthetic response of the gonadotrope depends on the frequency of GnRH stimulation. To understand how the gonadotrope distinguishes among varying patterns of stimulation to generate specific responses, Krakauer et al. [55] have simulated the behavior of simple circuit prototypes as frequency-decoding modules. The three circuits modeled were feedforward serial, feedforward parallel and recurrent parallel (Figure 5). Notably, a simple recurrent parallel structure shows a robust capability to link biosynthesis to a particular frequency of stimulation. Analysis of these simple circuits will help to guide

### Conclusions

Modulation of gonadotrope signaling by GnRH and its analogs is central to the treatment of a wide spectrum of disease, including infertility and tumors dependent on gonadal hormones. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying information processing in the gonadotrope will facilitate the development of rational therapies that target the GnRH system. Progress has accelerated in determining the connectivity map of gonadotrope signaling. Genomic studies have characterized the transcripts activated by GnRH and identified putative regulatory and logic circuits, and mathematical modeling approaches are beginning to probe the pattern-decoding function of modular components of the signaling network.

So far, studies have largely relied on biochemical assays of cell populations; however, the average responses measured in a population of cells might not accurately represent the response occurring within each individual cell [60–62]. Further studies are warranted into the genomic and signaling responses at the level of the single gonadotrope and into the sensitivity of these responses to the pattern of GnRH release from the hypothalamus. The convergence of quantitative global experimental techniques and theoretical biological approaches should identify the design principles underlying the connection between GnRH stimulation at the membrane and the biosynthetic response of the gonadotrope.
