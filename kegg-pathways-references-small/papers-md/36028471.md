Efferocytosis is defined as the clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) in physiological and pathological states and is performed by efferocytes, such as macrophages. Efferocytosis can lead to the resolution of inflammation and restore tissue homeostasis; however, the mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution are still not completely understood, and the effects of efferocytosis on other proresolving properties need to be explored and explained. In this review, the process of efferocytosis will be summarized briefly, and then these mechanisms and effects will be thoroughly discussed. In addition, the association between mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining resolution of inflammation and cardiovascular diseases will also be reviewed, as an understanding of this association may provide information on novel treatment targets.

### 1 | INTRODUCTION

In an adult human, billions of cells die and turnover every day. During this process, a large number of apoptotic cells (ACs) are produced and subsequently cleared by phagocytes, a process termed efferocytosis, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in physiology (Doran et al., 2020). In addition, a large number of cells also die in pathological conditions, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and appropriate efferocytosis is necessary. The failure of the process of efferocytosis leads to the accumulation of ACs, which in turn leads to the formation of a secondary necrotic core and the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thus contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and dampened restoration of repair (Elliott et al., 2017; Tajbakhsh et al., 2019).

Mechanistically, efferocytosis is distinct from classic forms of phagocytosis. Professional (macrophages, dendritic cells) and nonprofessional phagocytes recognize AC-expressed ligands via specialized

receptors and then engulf ACs, and a series of morphological and biological changes in phagocytes occurs (Boada-Romero et al., 2020). In response to AC engulfment and digestion, macrophages inhibit the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory mediators, accelerating inflammation resolution and finally promoting tissue repair, indicating the close link between efferocytosis and the resolution of inflammation (Yurdagul et al., 2020). Previous studies have illustrated the processes and mechanisms of AC recognition, uptake, engulfment and biological changes in efferocytosis (Boada-Romero et al., 2020; Elliott et al., 2017). However, the mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution, how the digestion of ACs promotes phagocytes to switch to the phenotype of resolution and their role in cardiovascular physiology and diseases remain incompletely understood. In this review, these areas in the cardiovascular system are the main focus, and the mechanism of efferocytosis is briefly described.

UTP) can be released by ACs through plasma membrane Pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels, inducing the migration of phagocytes. During apoptosis, caspases 3 and 7 cleave the C-terminal tail of Panx1, which opens the channel, leading to the release of nucleotides (Chekeni et al., 2010). After that, ATP and UTP can bind to several receptors, including ionotropic P2X receptors and metabotropic P2Y receptors, to exert chemotactic effects (Idzko et al., 2014). In addition, several other mediators (such as the dimer of ribosomal protein S19, endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II and human tyrosyl tRNA synthetase) can also induce phagocyte migration during apoptosis and this has been summarized in a previous review (Medina & Ravichandran, 2016).

After migration to ACs, efferocytes distinguish ACs from other healthy neighbouring cells depending on the presence of surface receptors that directly or indirectly interact with ‘eat-me’ signals expressed on the surface of ACs (Figure 1a). These ‘eat-me’ signals mainly include phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), calreticulin, intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM3) and glycosylation moieties (Doran et al., 2020) (Figure 1a). PtdSer is the most important ‘eat-me’ molecule. In healthy cells, PtdSer and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) are localized exclusively in the inner leaflet of plasma membranes, which are maintained through the action of flippases (ATP11A and 11C). When cells undergo apoptosis, caspase 3 inactivates flippases and activates XKR8-independent scramblase activity, which can rapidly transfer PtdSer from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet, resulting in the extracellular exposure of PtdSer (Suzuki et al., 2013). Then, PtdSer can bind phagocytes to induce efferocytosis directly through several receptors, including stabilins (such as stabilin1 and stabilin2), adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B1 (ADGRB1; also regarded as BAIl), T cell immunoglobulin mucin receptors (TIM, such as TIM1, TIM3 and TIM4), the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (He et al., 2011) and the CD300 family (CD300a and CD300b) (Boada-Romero et al., 2020; Figure 1a). In addition, phagocytes can also indirectly recognize PtdSer via several receptors and specific bridging molecules. For example, TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (TAMs, including TYRO3, AXL and MerTK) can recognize ACs through specific bridging ligands, including growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6) and protein S (Figure 1a). Binding analysis revealed that GAS6 can bind to all three receptors, while protein S only binds TYRO3 and MerTK, but not AXL (Vago et al., 2021). Integrins, as another indirect receptor, need milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) or its homologue developmental endothelial locus-1 (DEL-1) to bind PtdSer on ACs (Kourtzelis et al., 2019). In addition, the scavenger receptor CD36 can interact with oxidized PtdSer but not nonoxidized PtdSer, which promotes macrophage clearance of ACs (Greenberg et al., 2006). Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) can interact with PtdSer depending on the bridge molecule beta-2-glycoprotein 1 (β2-GP1) to facilitate the engulfment of ACs by macrophages (Maiti et al., 2008). Other ‘eat-me’ signals and related receptors have also been reported, such as LPC (immunoglobulin M as the receptor) (Kim et al., 2002), calreticulin (LRP-1, also known as CD91), ICAM-3 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 [LFA-1]) and complement proteins (Figure 1a).

2 | MECHANISMS OF EFFEROCYTOSIS

2.1 | Recognition of ACs

The process of efferocytosis involves several phases: AC recognition (finding and binding), AC engulfment (internalization) and AC degradation. First, ACs undergo membrane blebbing and release soluble signals into the milieu to induce rapid mobilization of efferocytes. These ‘find-me’ signals include chemokines (such as fractalkine, encoded by CX3C-chemokine ligand 1, CX3CL1; Truman et al., 2008), lipids (such as sphingosine 1-phosphate, S1P [Gude et al., 2008], and lysophosphatidylcholine, LPC [Lauber et al., 2003]) and nucleotides (such as ATP and UTP; Doran et al., 2020). During the early stage of apoptosis, fractalkine, a 90-kDa membrane-associated chemokine is processed to a 60-kDa form and then released in microparticles, driving macrophages to ACs by binding to the CX3C-chemokine receptor 1 (CX₃CR1) (Truman et al., 2008), although the precise mechanism for microparticle-associated fractalkine release remains unknown. LPC, as one of the first identified signals, can be synthesized from phosphatidylcholine via caspase-3-activated calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (Lauber et al., 2003) and recognizes the target G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) G2A (Peter et al., 2008). ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) may be responsible for LPC release (Peter et al., 2012), since RNAi-mediated knockdown of ABCA1 in ACs could abolish monocyte migration to the supernatant of ACs and ectopic expression of ABCA1 inversely increases migration (Peter et al., 2012). However, whether these changes are caused by the specific reduction in LPC remains unknown. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), which is located inside ACs and up-regulated during apoptosis, is important for the in-brain synthesis of S1P (Gude et al., 2008). In addition, the extracellular generation of S1P may be associated with SphK2, which can be secreted during apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. S1P mediated efferocyte chemotaxis involves several S1P receptors (S1P₁₋₅ receptors) (Medina & Ravichandran, 2016), and GPRs may also participate in the process. Nucleotides (ATP and

FIGURE 1 Recognition of apoptotic cells (ACs). Efferocytes recognize ACs depending on the presence of surface receptors that directly or indirectly interact with 'eat-me' signals expressed on the surface of ACs. (a) The correspondence between these 'eat-me' signals and the related receptors. These 'eat-me' signals include phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM 3) and calreticulin. PtdSer can directly bind to receptors including stabilins (stabilin 1 and stabilin 2), T cell immunoglobulin mucin receptors (TIM, such as TIM 1, TIM 3 and TIM 4), adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B1 (ADGRB1), the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and the CD300 family (CD300a and CD300b). The oxidized PtdSer, but not PtdSer, directly interacts with the scavenger receptor CD36. Efferocytes can also indirectly recognize PtdSer via several receptors and specific bridging molecules, including TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (TAMs, such as TYRO3, AXL and MerTK) (growth arrest-specific protein 6 [GAS 6] and protein S as the specific bridging molecules), integrins (such as αvβ3) (milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 [MFG-E8]) and developmental endothelial locus-1 (DEL-1) (as the specific bridging molecules). In addition, LPC, ICAM 3 and calreticulin can bind to immunoglobulin M (IgM), lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), respectively. (b) In addition to these 'eat-me' signals, ACs also express several 'don't-eat-me' signals, including class I MHC molecules (MCH-I), CD47, CD24, CD31 and CD46, which interact with related receptors located in efferocytes (except for CD46). MCH-I, CD47 and CD24 recognize leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor B1 (LILRB1), signal-regulatory-protein-α (SIRPα) and Siglec-10, respectively. In addition, homophilic interaction of CD31 on leukocytes and macrophages can prevent macrophage efferocytosis. CD46 is rapidly shed from the cell surface after apoptosis, then ACs gradually lose the capacity to inhibit efferocytosis by macrophages, but the mechanism remains unknown.

In addition to these 'eat-me' signals, there are several 'don't-eat-me' signals expressed on ACs (Figure 1b). CD47 and CD24 can bind the receptors signal-regulatory-protein-α (SIRPα) and Siglec-10 in macrophages, respectively (Barkal et al., 2019; Oldenborg et al., 2000), inhibiting the efferocytosis of ACs. Homophilic interaction of CD31 on leukocytes and macrophages can prevent engulfment during health and apoptosis (Poon et al., 2014). Other signals include CD46 and class I MHC molecules ([leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor B1](https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15939) [LILRB1] as the receptor) (Barkal et al., 2018; Elward et al., 2005). The existence of these 'don't-eat-me' signals can prevent efferocytosis, even if the 'eat-me' signals are present. The activity of efferocytosis is accompanied by a reduction in 'don't-eat-me' molecules and exposure to sufficient 'eat-me' signals, although many related mechanisms remain unknown.

2.2 | Engulfment of ACs

After recognizing ACs, phagocytes initiate actin remodelling in the membrane and form phagosomes through changes in the morphology of the membrane, which ultimately performs the engulfment. During this process, Rho family small GTPases, including Rho gene family member A (RhoA), Rac1 and CDC42, are closely linked to actin remodelling, and the activity of these Rho family small GTPases can be mediated by specific guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) (Ma et al., 2002; Ravichandran & Lorenz, 2007). Rac1 is increased during apoptosis and has a positive role in the engulfment of ACs. The activation of Rac1 depends on the complex of DOCK180 (a GEF) and the phagocytic regulatory protein engulfment and cell motility protein 1 (ELMO1), which is always the upstream molecule of DOCK180 (Figure 2a). First, ELMO1 can interact with the SH3 domain of DOCK180 to induce a conformational change in DOCK180, which allows access between DOCK180 and Rac1 (Ravichandran & Lorenz, 2007). Second, ELMO1, together with nucleotide-free Rac and DOCK180, can form a trimeric complex, which promotes the interaction between DOCK180 and Rac1 (Brugnera et al., 2002). Third, another GEF called Trio acts on RhoG to induce GTP loading, interacts with ELMO1 and transfers the complex of ELMO1 and DOCK180 to the membrane (Figure 2a) (Park et al., 2007). Then, the activation of Rac1 could directly localize the actin polymerization necessary to form the phagocytic cup by stimulating verprolin homology domain-containing protein 1 (WAVE1)-dependent activation of the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex, finally completing the engulfment of ACs (Evans et al., 2013). In addition, RhoA plays a negative role in the engulfment of ACs (Ravichandran & Lorenz, 2007), while CDC42 can activate actin reorganization and promote the engulfment of ACs (Cox et al., 1997).

Raymond et al. (2022) developed a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, CharON, to track emerging ACs and their efferocytic clearance by macrophages that were labelled with an mCherry marker.

**FIGURE 2** Engulfment and subsequent degradation of apoptotic cells (ACs). (a) The engulfment of ACs. Nucleotide-free RAC, together with engulfment and cell motility protein 1 (ELMO1) and DOCK180, forms a trimeric complex, which promotes the interaction between DOCK180 and Rac1, leading to the activation of Rac1. In addition, Trio can act on RHOG to induce RHOG-GTP production, which subsequent interacts with ELMO1, transfers the complex of ELMO1 and DOCK180 to the membrane and induces the activation of Rac1. Then, Rac1 can directly localize the actin polymerization necessary to form the phagocytic cup, finally completing the engulfment of AC corpses. Successive engulfment of AC corpses by macrophages leads to macrophage heterogeneity, illustrated by unequal corpse burden: no, low (1–3 corpses), medium (4–6 corpses) or high (≥7 corpses) burden. This heterogeneity maintains the capability of macrophages to continuously clear ACs in inflammatory environment, since macrophages with 0 or low burden are always available. (b) The canonical process in degradation of ACs. After engulfment, nascent phagosome undergoes early, late and lysosome-interacting stages in turn, finally completing the fusion of phagosome-lysosome and the degradation of ACs depending on the presence of acid-sensitive enzymes. During this process, Rab5-GTP and Rab7-GTP are the characteristics of early and late phagosomes, respectively. Rab7-GTP can also facilitate phagosome-lysosome fusion, in which tethering factors, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein (SNAP)-receptors (SNAREs) are also imperative. In addition, during this phagosome maturation process, acidification is gradually increased based on the multimeric protein complex vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) that mediates the influx of H⁺. (c) Degradation of ACs in the LC3-associated process. The binding to PtdSer receptors in phagocytes results in phagosome generation and recruits a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which comprises Beclin 1, Rubicon, UVRAG, VPS34 and VPS15, to phagosomes. The PI3K complex can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositides (PtdIns) to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which mediates the LC3 conjugation system (including ATG3, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, ATG12 and ATG16L) to complete the recruitment of LC3-II to phagosomes, promoting the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes and the effective degradation of ACs.

This study found that macrophage engulfment of ACs is unrestrained and not always synchronized with subsequent acidification/degradation. The rapid, successive engulfment of corpses by macrophages before the degradation of their existing or newly acquired corpse leads to macrophage heterogeneity, illustrated by unequal corpse burden: no, low (1–3 corpses), medium (4–6 corpses) or high (≥7 corpses) burden (Figure 2a). Therefore, macrophages with a lower burden are always available to clear ACs in an inflammatory environment (Raymond et al., 2022). In addition, macrophages burdened with multiple corpses still remain highly motile and phagocytic, indicating that engulfment and motility are not mutually exclusive. Together, macrophages in tissue have continuous and durable abilities to engulf ACs, contributing to the rapid resolution of inflammation. However, the associated mechanisms are still unknown.

### 2.3 Degradation of ACs

Following the entrapment of ACs, nascent efferosomes are transformed into effero-lysosomes that degrade ACs through a highly regulated canonical maturation pathway, including early, late and lysosome-interacting stages (Yin & Heit, 2021), finally contributing to the degradation of metabolic burden, lipid efflux and proresolving reprogramming. The canonical efferosome maturation process requires the recruitment of the Rab GTPases Rab5 and Rab7, which are similar to phagosomes. Rab5-GTP, the expression of which is characteristic of early phagosomes, is transiently (~30 min) located on the membrane of early phagosomes and is critical for phagosome development. Rab5-GTP, not Rab5-GDP, mediates the fusion between phagosomes and early endosomes and activates its effectors, such as early-endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and the vacuolar fusion proteins MON1A and MON1B (Yan et al., 2018) (Figure 2b).

After the hydrolysis of Rab5-GTP to Rab5-GDP and the subsequent dissociation of Rab5-GDP from the membrane, Rab7-GTP is acquired to induce the generation of late phagosomes, mediating the fusion of phagosomes with late endosomes and lysosomes (Figure 2b; Harrison et al., 2003). Late phagosomes generate a more acidic environment, as the influx of H⁺ is increased based on the multimeric protein complex vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) (Figure 2b; Kissing et al., 2015), multiple subunits of which are downstream molecules of Rab7. In addition, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) to assist in AC degradation, is also downstream of Rab7 (Nunes et al., 2013). Rab7 interacts with its effectors, including RAB7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1 (ORPL1), to bind the dynein-dynactin microtubule motor, mediating vesicular trafficking and moving phagosomes from the periphery towards the microtubule-organizing centre (Harrison et al., 2003; Johansson et al., 2005), thereby facilitating phagosome-lysosome fusion. Therefore, Rab7 plays a critical role in the maturation of phagosomes and the generation of phagolysosomes. The loss of Rab7 enhances the accumulation of apoptotic bodies in phagosomes in a *Caenorhabditis elegans* model of AC removal.

(Kinchen et al., 2008), and the impairment of Rab7 activation could contribute to an accumulation of apoptotic epithelial cells in a model of murine ulcerative colitis, aggravating inflammation and disease severity (Wu et al., 2021).

In addition to the Rab family and their effectors, tethering factors, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein (SNAP)-receptors (SNAREs) are also imperative during membrane fusion within the endomembrane system (Figure 2b; Lurick et al., 2018). Generally, the process of membrane fusion comprises (1) tethering; (2) SNARE assembly; (3) SNARE zippering and membrane fusion; and (4) SNARE disassembly and recycling (Yoon & Munson, 2018). After Rabs and tethering factors establish the fusion site, SNARE proteins, regarded as the core of phagosome-lysosome fusion, are recruited to assemble the SNARE complex, which directly mediates the fusion of adjacent membranes through a conformational change from a trans-SNARE complex to a cis-SNARE complex (Nguyen & Yates, 2021). Once membrane fusion is completed, the SNARE complex is disassembled by NSF and α-SNAP, and these SNARE proteins undergo proper recycling and relocalization (Vivona et al., 2013). After phagosome-lysosome fusion, the phagolysosome is further acidified through V-ATPase and ion transporters, which perform the degradation of these internalized contents depending on the presence of acid-sensitive enzymes. Therefore, the degradation of internalized ACs is a complex process that is precisely mediated. However, the complete breakdown process of efferosomes or phagosomes and how the internalized burden is ideally digested in phagolysosomes still need further investigation.

### 2.4 Degradation of ACs in the LC3-associated process

In addition to the canonical process, phagosomes can undergo degradation through a noncanonical pathway in favour of autophagy proteins, the microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) family. LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) (Figure 2c) is characterized by the conjugation of LC3 family proteins to phagosome membranes (Heckmann & Green, 2019). Unlike autophagy, which is mainly activated by nutrient status or intracellular stress sensing, LAP mainly responds to the engulfment of ACs, debris and pathogens (Asare et al., 2020). The binding to PtdSer receptors in phagocytes results in phagosome generation and recruits a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex (Figure 2c), which is different from autophagy and comprises Beclin 1, Rubicon, UVRAG, VPS34 and VPS15, to phagosomes (Heckmann & Green, 2019). Phosphatidylinositides (PtdIns) are phosphorylated by the complex to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which plays a critical role in LAP (Martinez et al., 2015). The production of PI3P can mediate ROS production, which is indispensable for NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2), LC3 lipidation and the recruitment of downstream autophagic proteins (Martinez et al., 2015). Both ROS and PI3P are required for the LC3-conjugation machinery, and the ablation of NOX2 in macrophages can reduce

ROS production and abolish LAP. However, exogenous ROS were found not to induce the translocation of LC3 to phagosomes in the absence of Rubicon, suggesting that the Rubicon-PI3P axis is required for LAP (Martinez et al., 2015).

After the assembly of the PI3K complex, the LC3 conjugation system, which includes ATG3, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, ATG12 and ATG16L, is subsequently generated (Figure 2c). Prior to conjugation, LC3 is cleaved to generate LC3-I and is subsequently transformed into LC3-II, which exposes the glycine residue required for lipidation in favour of ATG4 (Fernandez & Lopez-Otin, 2015). Then, the LC3 conjugation system completes the recruitment of LC3-II to phagosomes, promoting the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes. Previous studies have revealed that LAP can protect against hepatic and systemic inflammation during chronic liver injury in rodents and that the inhibition of the LAP process in human blood monocytes, including the inhibition of the PI3K complex and the blockade of the p22phox-Rubicon interaction, exacerbates inflammatory signatures (Wan et al., 2020). Similarly, in an animal model of chronic liver injury, the depletion of Rubicon in macrophages enhances inflammation and fibrosis in the liver (Wan et al., 2020). Since LC3 conjugation occurs after phagosomal sealing, LAP may not have a role in promoting membrane closure. In addition, current evidence suggests that LAP may not directly disturb the functional capacity of the lysosome because a direct lysosomal defect was not observed in LAP-disturbed cells and animal models, in which impaired phagosome maturation was observed (Heckmann et al., 2019). Therefore, the completed function of LAP components in phagosome degradation remains to be further investigated, which will provide a better understanding of phagocytosis and efferocytosis.

## EFFEROCTOSIS: A LINK TO THE RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION

In contrast to anti-inflammation, the resolution of inflammation is a critical proactive process that promotes host homeostasis restoration and protects against prolonged or excessive inflammation, which is a pivotal pathomechanism of inflammatory diseases. The resolution of inflammation can be characterized by the dampening of proinflammatory signalling, the clearance of proinflammatory mediators, the production of specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and other proresolving molecules, the activation of proresolving pathways, the modulation of macrophage phenotype and the regulation of T lymphocytes (Kourtzelis et al., 2020; Proto et al., 2018). SPMs can promote the resolution of inflammation by enhancing the ability of macrophage efferocytosis to target ACs, which is regarded as a critical mechanism in the process of inflammation resolution. Interestingly, the mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution, except for the clearance of ACs, may also be associated with the modulation of macrophage phenotype (Angsana et al., 2016) and the regulation of proresolving mediators and pathways (Snodgrass et al., 2021), and other proresolving pathways in different immune microenvironments or diseases. In the next section, the mechanisms

by which efferocytosis regulates other characteristics of inflammation resolution will be summarized and discussed.

### 3.1 Dampening proinflammatory signalling

In sepsis, a cytokine storm may be observed even though blood bacterial cultures are negative, suggesting that persistent activation of the immune system may be inescapable despite the removal of the inciting stimulus. Therefore, the dampening of proinflammatory signalling is necessary to switch off persistent inflammation to a certain extent.

For example, successful efferocytosis or co-culture with ACs always contributes to the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, such as **tumour necrosis factor α** (TNF-α), **interleukin-6** (IL-6) and **IL-1β**, in macrophages (Fox et al., 2015). A previous study revealed that in the dextran sulphate sodium model, the administration of ACs induced negative NF-κB and **NLRP3** inflammasome signalling, resulting in the inhibition of inflammation (Grau et al., 2015). In another study, apoptotic extracellular vesicles from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells alleviated *Porphyromonas gingivalis* lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation of macrophages, and the mechanism was determined by the AMPK/SIRT1/NF-κB pathway (Ye et al., 2022). In addition, apoptotic body-inspired PtdSer/membrane-coated nanoparticles, which are capable of inducing macrophage efferocytosis, could reduce TNF-α production in macrophages in vitro, which was correlated with a reduction in NF-κB activation (Kraynak et al., 2020). For inflammasomes, lysosomal acid lipase, a major acid hydrolase enzyme that breaks down fatty material within the lysosomal compartment of cells, plays an important role in resolving the constituents of ACs and maintaining effective efferocytosis, and the inhibition of lysosomal acid lipase coincidentally contributes to the defective efferocytic response and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes (Viaud et al., 2018), indicating that effective efferocytosis is necessary for the inhibition of activated inflammasomes. MerTk, as a critical positive effector of efferocytosis, can dampen the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by regulating autophagy (Du et al., 2021), further suggesting that efferocytosis could proactively dampen the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrate that efferocytosis promotes the resolution of inflammation partly by dampening proinflammatory pathways (such as NF-κB and inflammasomes) (showed in Figure 3a).

### 3.2 Targeting SPMs and related pathways

Literature reports have demonstrated that SPMs have a powerful ability to regulate efferocytosis and promote inflammation resolution in multiple inflammatory diseases, especially in immune diseases and cardiovascular diseases (Fredman & Spite, 2017; Godson et al., 2000). After the recognition, engulfment and lysosomal fusion of ACs, large amounts of components or metabolic cargo can be further processed in a safe and effective manner. In this process, metabolic cargo suppresses the inflammatory response, produces anti-inflammatory

FIGURE 3 The mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution: Dampening proinflammatory signalling, targeting specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and targeting other proresolving mediators. (a) Dampening proinflammatory signalling. Efferocytosis can reduce the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines through regulating NLRP3 inflammasome and AMPK/SIRT1/NF-κB pathways, respectively. (b) Targeting SPMs production. Efferocytosis activates the nuclear hormone receptor superfamilies (including liver X receptors [LXRs], retinoid X receptors and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors [PPARs]), contributing to the increasing of 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX-15) and production of SPMs. In addition, efferocytosis can promote SPM production through activating 12/15-LOX or mediating SERCA2/cytoplasmic ca²⁺/CaMKII/5-LOX translocation pathway. (c) Targeting other proresolving mediators. Efferocytosis-derived fatty acids are metabolized to produce IL-10 through mitochondrial β oxidation/NAD⁺/SIRT1/Pbx-10 pathway. Efferocytosis-derived oxysterols can be transformed to 25-hydroxycholesterol that activates LXRs to induce TGF-β production. During efferocytosis process, CD36/MEK promotes the activation of ERK1/2, but this is unfortunately insufficient owing to an ERK-DUSP4 negative feedback pathway that can exert a negative effect on ERK1/2 activation. AC-derived methionine is metabolized to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that can be used to induce DUSP4 methylation through DNA methyltransferase-3A (DNMT3A), leading to the reduce of DUSP4 and the enhancement of ERK1/2 activation that regulates the Ptgs2/COX2 pathway to induce PGE2 production and subsequent TGF-β biosynthesis. Efferocytosis may activate PPARγ to increase annexin A1 (AnxA1) and Arg-1 expression. Arg-1 can subsequently metabolize arginine to synthesize putrescine, increase Db1 mRNA stabilization and enhance Rac1 activation, leading to the acceleration of continual efferocytosis.

mediators and performs sustained efferocytosis, all of which contribute to the restoration of immune homeostasis (Doran et al., 2020). However, the association between the management of metabolic cargo and immunosuppressive effects is not completely understood. Previous studies suggested that the nuclear hormone receptor superfamilies (including liver X receptors (LXR), retinoid X receptors and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR)) that regulate the genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport played a critical role in mediating the association (Roszer, 2017; Snodgrass et al., 2021). For example, the uptake of apoptotic Jurkat T cells by macrophages activates the LXR and PPAR pathways and down-regulates the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) target genes (Mota et al., 2021). Macrophages deficient in LXRs are unable to clear apoptotic thymocytes, but LXR deficiency in macrophages does not affect their processes of recognition and engulfment (A-Gonzalez et al., 2009). In addition, the activation of LXRs or PPARs in mice is associated with the resolution of inflammation in several inflammatory diseases and conditions, such as lung inflammation, atherosclerosis and hypertensive nephropathy, due to the maintenance of effective efferocytosis in vivo (Che et al., 2021; Madenspacher et al., 2020).

Because of the important role of LXRs and PPARs in the transcriptional changes induced by efferocytosis, we speculated that efferocytosis may, in turn, contribute to SPM production through the LXR and PPAR pathways. Snodgrass et al. (2021) revealed that AC uptake by macrophages up-regulated LXR-dependent genes and that an agonist of LXR enhanced the cellular capacity to synthesize inflammation-suppressing SPM precursors, including 15-HETE, 17-HDHA and Resolvin D5, through arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15). The silencing of LXRα and LXRβ could reverse the enhancement of ALOX-15 expression induced by AC uptake. LXR agonists or the type 2 (Th2) cytokine IL-13. In primary rat astrocytes, an agonist of PPARβ (GW501516) strongly induced the production of proresolution substances and derivatives of DHA, such as 4-HDoHE, 11-HDoHE and 17-HDoHE (Chistyakov et al., 2020). In addition, GW501516 could decrease COX-derived oxylipins and the release of TNF-α (Chistyakov et al., 2020). Therefore, the transcription factors represented by LXRs and PPARs during the process of efferocytic digestion may be an interesting switch to accelerate the synthesis of SPMs, contributing to the restoration of homeostasis (showed in Figure 3b).

In addition, the activation of MerTk can promote SPM biosynthesis through a mechanism in which the cytoplasmic:nuclear ratio of 5-LOX is increased in cultured macrophages in vitro and in sterile inflammation in vivo, but these changes are diminished by the cleavage of MerTK through ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) (Cai et al., 2016). Similarly, cleavage-resistant MerTK, generated by a genetically engineered variant that protects against

cleavage, also increases the production of SPMs in the serum of mice and attenuates ischaemia/reperfusion-induced lung injury (Cai et al., 2016). The activation of MerTK promotes the expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), resulting in a decrease in the cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration and the suppression of **calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II** (CaMKII) activity. After that, it increases the cytoplasmic localization of 5-LOX (always as the nonphosphorylated form) and promotes the production of SPMs, including Resolvin and Lipoxin, by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2 (Cai et al., 2018). Protein S, another positive molecule for efferocytosis, was reported to be increased in macrophages during the resolution of inflammation, and selective knockout in the myeloid lineage resulted in damage to proresolving characteristics, including efferocytosis, the inhibition of **12/15-LOX** and a reduction in one SPM, **Resolvin D1**. Subsequently, these changes were reversed by the administration of exogenous protein S (Lumboso et al., 2018). Similarly, Del-1-mediated efferocytosis promotes LXR expression and contributes to the optional production of several SPMs, including Resolvin D1, **Resolvin E1** and **Lipoxin A4** (Kourtzelis et al., 2019). In addition, macrophage **COX2** was reported to modulate efferocytosis capacity and subsequent efferocytosis-dependent Lipoxin A4, facilitating macrophage intestinal epithelial repair capacity (Meriwether et al., 2022). Together, these results show that mediating 5-LOX, 15-LOX, 12/15-LOX, COX2 and pro-efferocytosis molecules (such as MerTK and protein S) may have a beneficial effect on SPM biosynthesis (showed in Figure 3b).

### 3.3 Targeting other proresolving mediators

In addition to SPMs, other proresolving or reparative mediators, such as **IL-10**, **transforming growth factor-β** (TGF-β), **arginase-1** (Arg-1) and **Annexin A1** (AnxA1), have also been studied in recent years. Previous studies have shown that IL-10, traditionally regarded as an anti-inflammatory factor, plays a positive role in macrophage efferocytosis and inflammation resolution in several inflammatory diseases. On the other hand, in murine peritoneal macrophages, the efferocytosis of ACs can increase the expression of IL-10 and reduce TNF-α and NO production (Song & Ma, 2019). Efferocytes deal with the metabolite load to induce the production of IL-10, and the mechanism may be independent of glycolysis yet determined by AC fatty acids. These fatty acids undergo mitochondrial β-oxidation, leading to increase of NAD⁺/NADPH, the subsequent activation of SIRT1/pre-B-cell leukaemia transcription factor-1 (Pbx-1) pathway and the final production of IL-10 (Zhang et al., 2019). In another study, the mechanism by which efferocytosis induces IL-10 production was associated with the engagement of the thrombospondin-1 structural repeat 2 domain, which provides a means by which ACs are recognized (Zhao et al., 2014). At present, although efferocytosis promoting IL-10 production has been clearly stated, the critical transformation pathways from AC

cargo to IL-10 still need to be elucidated, which may provide more novel ideas for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (showed in Figure 3c).

TGF-β is another important mediator in the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. A study reported that efferocytic macrophages could promote the secretion of the proresolving factor TGF-β in vitro and in vivo in a model of inflammatory bowel disease (Martin-Rodriguez et al., 2021). In addition, maintaining effective efferocytosis by blocking CD47, a key ‘don't eat me’ molecule, and preventing the cleavage of MerTK could restore the production of TGF-β, ultimately contributing to the attenuation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (Kojima et al., 2018) and myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury (DeBerge et al., 2017). In the face of metabolic load during the uptake of ACs, efferocytes metabolize oxysterols to produce 25-hydroxycholesterol via cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, and then 25-hydroxycholesterol activates LXR to induce the synthesis of TGF-β (Madenspacher et al., 2020). Mechanisms of efferocytosis-mediated TGF-β synthesis may also be associated with prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2/cyclooxygenase 2 (Ptgs2/COX2), which further results in the synthesis of **prostaglandin E2** (PGE2) (Ampomah et al., 2022). In detail, during the mechanistic process, CD36-induced is necessary for activation of ERK1/2, which is unfortunately insufficient owing to an ERK-DUSP4 negative feedback pathway that can exert a negative effect on ERK1/2 activation, whereas the subsequent AC engulfment and phagolysosomal degradation could metabolize methionine to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that could be used to induce DUSP4 methylation mediated by DNA methyltransferase-3A (DNMT3A), leading to reduced DUSP4 and the enhancement of activation of ERK1/2 and the subsequent Ptgs2/COX2/PGE2/TGF-β pathway. Then, PGE2 promotes the production of TGF-β (Ampomah et al., 2022). Therefore, TGF-β production is another outcome of metabolic load from ACs during efferocytosis (showed in Figure 3c).

For Arg-1, the efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils significantly promotes M2 macrophage polarization, as well as increased expression of Arg-1 and MerTK (Sakhno et al., 2021). Impairing efferocytosis through the depletion of protein S could result in decreased expression levels of Arg-1, 12/15LOX and Resolvin D1 (Lumboso et al., 2020). These results suggest that effective efferocytosis could observably promote Arg-1 expression. As described above in this review, efferocytosis can activate PPAR function. PPARγ, one subtype of PPAR, has been reported to subsequently increase the expression of target genes, including Arg-1 and CD36, which further enhances AC clearance and the regression of inflammation (Yoon et al., 2015). Compared with the initial efferocytosis, the sustainable capacity plays a more important role in the clearance of ACs, in which many regulatory mechanisms are involved. Yurdagul et al. (2020) reported that the metabolism of AC-derived arginine and ornithine to putrescine has a positive effect on the continual efferocytosis in macrophages, regulated by Arg-1 and ornithine decarboxylase. Then, putrescine enhances HuR-mediated stabilization of the mRNA encoding a GTP-exchange factor Dbl (gene name Mcf2), which can activate actin-regulating Rac1 to

facilitate subsequent rounds of AC internalization. Therefore, the initial AC uptake induces the production of Arg-1, which further promotes secondary and continual efferocytosis, leading to positive feedback (showed in Figure 3c).

Previous studies found that PGE2 could also be generated by effective efferocytosis (Dejani et al., 2018; Yurdagul et al., 2020). In zebrafish, after tailfin amputation, macrophage clearance of ACs contributes to the production of PGE2, which drives neutrophil removal via the promotion of reverse migration through EP4 receptors and results in the resolution of inflammation (Loynes et al., 2018). In addition, PGE2 is a positive upstream molecule of TGF-β, and as described above in this review, efferocytosis can mediate TGF-β via the Ptgs2/COX2 pathway (Ampomah et al., 2022). In summary, efferocytosis has a powerful ability to metabolize AC-debris and subsequently to produce PGE2 (showed in Figure 3c).

For AnxA1, Negreiros-Lima et al. (2020) showed that db-cAMP promoted efferocytosis of ACs by macrophages, accompanied by the increased expression of AnxA1 and CD36. In breast cancer, PPARγ could enhance AnxA1 expression in vivo and in vitro (Chen et al., 2017). Since PPARγ could be activated in macrophage efferocytosis, we inspected whether efferocytosis may promote AnxA1 production through activating PPARγ (Figure 3c). However, the direct evidence for efferocytosis enhancing AnxA1 expression is still absent. Interestingly, both apoptotic neutrophils and neutrophils in the environment of inflammation could release AnxA1, which subsequently activates the anti-inflammatory and proresolving ability of macrophages through the FPR2 receptor, including the inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 (Pupjalis et al., 2011), the increase of TGF-β and IL-10 (Rhys et al., 2018) and the enhancement of phagocytosis (Maderna et al., 2005; Scannell et al., 2007). Therefore, AC-derived AnxA1 can effectively promote inflammation resolution and efferocytosis may also contribute to the increase of AnxA1 expression, which is a positive cycle.

Taken together, these findings indicate that efferocytosis can promote the production of proresolving mediators, including TGF-β, IL-10, Arg-1, PGE2 and AnxA1, and the critical transcriptional and metabolic mechanisms may be of interest for the treatment of inflammation in the future.

### 3.4 Regulating macrophage phenotype

M2 reparative or proresolving macrophages have been reported to play a critical role in the resolution of inflammation, promoting efferocytosis and generating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Compared to M1 or proinflammatory macrophages, reparative macrophages show a better capability to phagocytize ACs. Effective macrophage efferocytosis can promote macrophage reparative properties in vitro and in vivo (Angsana et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). In macrophages in vitro, an apoptotic body-inspired nanoparticle coated in the PtdSer-supplemented cell plasma membrane was shown to promote macrophage polarization to the anti-inflammatory phenotype, accompanied by the regression of

proinflammatory TNF-α (Kraynak et al., 2020). The apoptotic vesicles generated by ACs retain the ability to stimulate macrophage efferocytosis and promote the transformation of macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype through calreticulin located in vesicles in T2 diabetic livers (Zheng et al., 2021).

As shown above, TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (AXL, MerTK, TYRO3) and their ligands (Protein S, GAS6) have a positive effect on macrophage engulfment of ACs, although other studies have also suggested an anti-inflammatory effect (van der Meer et al., 2014). In mice, a loss of AXL and MerTK significantly reduces macrophage efferocytosis of eryptotic erythrocytes and dampens alternative activation of reparative macrophages, resulting in worsened neurological recovery after experimental intracerebral haemorrhage (Chang et al., 2018). Similarly, the reduced GAS 6 expression by myeloid-related protein 8/14 can inhibit macrophage engulfment of apoptotic thymocytes and promote the polarization of macrophages to the M1 phenotype, and the transformation of macrophage phenotype may be determined by Toll-like receptor 4 and MAPK p38/NF-κB pathways (Li et al., 2021). TIM4, a TIM receptor, recognizes PtdSer to mediate the uptake of ACs by efferocytes. De Maeyer et al. (2020) found that the inhibition of MAPK P38 activity could rescue TIM-4 expression in elderly individuals and accelerate AC clearance, leading to the restoration of a reparative macrophage phenotype. In addition, increasing the binding capacity for apoptotic neutrophils through COX2 in macrophages could also promote a tissue repair macrophage phenotype in intestinal epithelial organoids (Meriwether et al., 2022).

After AC engulfment, AC DNA is hydrolyzed by phagolysosomal DNase2a to generate nucleotides that activate a DNA-PKcs/mTORC2/Rictor pathway to increase Myc, resulting in the proliferation of resolving macrophages. The efferocytosis-induced proliferation expands the pool of efferocytic macrophages and further amplifies this proresolving effect in vitro and in vivo, in studies including zymosan-induced peritonitis, dexamethasone-induced thymocyte apoptosis, and atherosclerosis (Gerlach et al., 2021). In addition, fatty acids derived from ACs promote IL-10 production and macrophage reprogramming to an anti-phenotype through the mitochondrial β-oxidation/coenzyme NAD⁺/SIRT1 pathway but not through glycolysis (Zhang et al., 2019). Pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2), a glycolytic enzyme regulating energy metabolism, plays a critical role in the macrophage inflammatory response since the depletion of PKM2 can up-regulate LRP-1 and enhance subsequent efferocytosis, which results in the inhibition of MCP-1, IL-1β and IL-12 (Doddapattar et al., 2022). This finding indicates that energy-mediated efferocytosis may have an adequate ability to regulate the macrophage phenotype. LXR receptors, the important transcription factors bridging AC cargo and metabolic products, are activated by Del-1 in efferocytosis, which contributes to the transformation of macrophages to the reparative phenotype, as well as the increase in SPM biosynthesis (Kourtzelis et al., 2019). The results of these studies indicate that efferocytosis mediates macrophage reprogramming to a reparative phenotype by felicitously metabolizing AC cargo (showed in Figure 4a).

(a) Regulating macrophage phenotype

(b) Targeting regulatory T (Treg) cell

FIGURE 4 The mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution: Regulating macrophage phenotype and targeting regulatory T (Treg) cells. (a) Apoptotic cell (AC)-derived DNA is hydrolyzed by phagolysosomal DNase2a to generate nucleotides, which activate the DNA-PKcs/mTORC2/Myc pathway to promote the proliferation of reparative macrophages, and MerTK-ERK1/2 is also necessary for this process. AC-derived fatty acids can promote the reparative macrophage phenotype through mitochondrial β oxidation/NAD+/SIRT1 pathway. The depletion of pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2) can increase the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) that subsequently promote macrophage efferocytosis, along with the inhibition of the proinflammatory macrophage phenotype. Engulfment of ACs by macrophages may also promote the reparative phenotype through activating liver X receptors (LXRs). (b) As described above, macrophage efferocytosis can induce the production of specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), IL-10 and TGF-β, which can subsequently promote Treg cell response. In addition, AC-derived bodies may also directly promote Treg cell response through the released molecules.

3.5 | Targeting regulatory T (Treg) cells

(Wang et al., 2021). Li et al. (2020) reported that Del-1 could promote Treg responses through the αvβ3/RUNX1/FOXP3 axis. In a hypertensive animal model, Del-1 promotes an αvβ3 integrin-dependent Treg response, contributing to the resolution of inflammation and the attenuation of hypertension-induced cardiovascular remodelling (Failer et al., 2022). These results suggested that Del-dependent efferocytosis may enhance the Treg cell response, through which the process of inflammation resolution is synergistically favoured. In addition, regulatory molecules mediating efferocytosis may also play a critical role in Treg cell response, possibly providing novel drug targets.

Usually, Treg cells play a critical role in dampening proinflammatory response and accelerating resolution of inflammation. As described above, efferocytosis induces the production of proresolving mediators, such as SPMs, TGF-β, IL-10 and Arg-1, which have been reported to promote Treg cell responses. In detail, TGF-β is an important stimulant of Treg cell differentiation (Kanamori et al., 2016), and IL-10 could promote human induced Treg cell response via STAT3 and Foxo1 (Hsu et al., 2015). In addition, several SPMs including Resolving D1, D2 and Maresin 1 could promote de novo generation of Foxp3+ Treg cells in vitro (Chiurchiu et al., 2016). Resolving D1 increases the percentage of Treg cells in vivo and enhances Treg cell differentiation in vitro, contributing to the improvement of ischaemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (Luan et al., 2020). Although T lymphocytes have little ability to phagocytize ACs, AC-derived bodies and proteins may play a key role in the enhancement of the Treg response. Nadkarni et al. (2016) found that apoptotic neutrophil-derived FOXO1 could be transferred to T cells, subsequently increase FOXP3 expression and expand Treg cells, contributing to the production of IL-10 and VEGF and the improvement of embryo development. Therefore, apoptotic neutrophils could regulate adaptive immunity and Treg differentiation through released particles and macrophage efferocytosis (showed in Figure 4b).

Del-1, as an important bridge molecule mediating efferocytosis, could exert its effect on T lymphocytes through the receptor intergrin

3.6 | Therapeutic potential

Firstly, proresolving molecules, including SPMs, IL-10, TGF-β, PGE2, Arg-1 and AnxA1, could be regarded as the promising therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases, since they all have powerful abilities to inhibit inflammation, accelerate inflammation resolution and mediate tissue repair. For example, Godson et al. (2000) and O'Sullivan et al. (2007) first reported the proresolving effect of Lipoxin A4 and found that Lipoxin A4 and its analogues display potent biological activities in inflammatory diseases. In an animal model of renal fibrosis, Lipoxin A4 and its analogues (benzo-Lipoxin A4) could inhibited TNF-α production and increase IL-10 expression, leading to the attenuation of fibrosis (Börgeson et al., 2011). In a model of diabetes-associated

Zhang et al.

atherosclerosis, Lipoxin A4 and its analogues could also mitigate atherosclerosis through antagonizing inflammatory responses (Brennan et al., 2018). For AnxA1, the administration of its mimetic peptide, Ac2-26, promoted the clearance of neutrophils, reprogrammed macrophage phenotype and inhibited inflammation, contributing to the attenuation of cardiac ischaemia injury (Qin et al., 2019).

Secondly, current drugs that can promote macrophage efferocytosis may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Liu et al. found that glucocorticoids enhanced the efferocytosis of ACs by macrophages, and this, along with the lack of proinflammatory cytokine release, suggested that glucocorticoids may have an ability to promote inflammation resolution through macrophage efferocytosis (Liu et al., 1999). In macrophages derived from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, glucocorticoids could promote the efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils but not affect bacterial phagocytosis, indicating the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids exert therapeutic benefit in COPD (Higham et al., 2020). AP214, a melanocortin (MC) receptor agonist, was reported to increase the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages via recognizing MC₃ receptors in vitro and to mitigate arthritis in vivo (Montero-Melendez et al., 2011). AP1189, a biased MC receptor agonist, could accelerate macrophage efferocytosis and inflammation resolution through MC₁ and MC₃ receptors, contributing to the improvement of peritonitis and experimental arthritis in animals (Montero-Melendez et al., 2015). These results indicated that the agonists targeting MC₁ and MC₃ receptors may have a potent ability to promote inflammation resolution and may be promising drugs in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], targeting the Mas Receptor, has recently emerged as a novel proresolving mediator. Zaidan et al. revealed that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis could reprogram macrophage phenotype and promote macrophage efferocytosis (Zaidan et al., 2022). In the experimental models of asthma (Magalhaes et al., 2018) and antigen-induced arthritis (Barroso et al., 2017), respectively, the proresolving effect of Ang-(1-7) contributed to the reduce of inflammation and improvement of tissue injury.

Thirdly, interventions targeting the critical molecules or pathways by which efferocytosis determines inflammation resolution may also provide therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases. For example, the activation of TAM receptors through providing exogenous GAS6 and protein S may exert a protective effect in acute lung injury (Kim et al., 2021) and allergic bronchial asthma, respectively (Asayama et al., 2020). The agonist targeting LXR could increase SPMs synthesis in macrophages (Snodgrass et al., 2021) and promote inflammation resolution in acute lung injury (Madenspacher et al., 2020). In addition, pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, attenuated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and protected mice from myocardial infarction (MI) injury (Shiomi et al., 2002). In summary, the mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution not only expound the complex interaction between efferocytosis and inflammation resolution but also provide numerous intervention targets for treatment in inflammatory diseases.

4 | EFFEROCTOSIS TRIGGERING THE RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES

In this section, the effects of efferocytosis on cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and myocardial injury and repair, will be summarized and discussed, especially regarding the mechanisms by which efferocytosis triggers the resolution of inflammation. Works mainly from the last 5 years will be discussed.

### 4.1 Atherosclerosis

As has been well documented in multiple studies, efferocytosis targeting ACs markedly protects against atherosclerosis in animal models (Doddapattar et al., 2022; Mueller et al., 2022). In LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr−/−) mice, MerTK-dependent efferocytosis could increase the production of SPMs and lead to smaller necrotic cores and thicker fibrous caps in plaques (Cai et al., 2017). In another study, a lack of CaMKIIγ in macrophages increased the expression of MerTK via the ATF6//LXRα signalling pathway and enhanced efferocytosis, which was demonstrated by the increase in the ratio of TUNEL⁺ ACs associated with macrophages: total ACs ratio (Doran et al., 2017). As summarized above, both LXR and PPAR are important transcription factors that sense cholesterol or fatty acids and can be activated by metabolic cargo during efferocytosis, resulting in the production of several SPMs (Chistyakov et al., 2020; Snodgrass et al., 2021). This biosynthesis of SPMs in turn promotes effective AC clearance and inflammation resolution, synergistically contributing to the regression of atherosclerosis. In recent years, Lipoxin A4 and Resolvin D1, D2 and E1 have been shown to exert effects on atherosclerosis (Arnardottir et al., 2021; Bardin et al., 2022; Brennan et al., 2018; Laguna-Fernandez et al., 2018).

Previous studies revealed that effective efferocytosis contributes to IL-10 synthesis in atherosclerotic plaques (Wang et al., 2018; Yurdagul et al., 2021). The enhancement of efferocytosis induced by the increase in foam cell apoptosis, along with the increase in MerTK expression, up-regulates the production of IL-10, and the mechanism may be associated with PPARγ and LXRα (Wang et al., 2018). During efferocytosis, macrophage ornithine decarboxylase promotes the synthesis of putrescine, which is able to up-regulate IL-10 expression via the MerTK-MAPK ERK1/2 pathway (Yurdagul et al., 2021). Interestingly, IL-10 can in turn promote macrophage efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis, illustrated by the enhancement of AC engulfment, and the mechanism is associated with the IL-10/Vav1/Rac1 pathway (Proto et al., 2018). Rac1 positively regulating AC engulfment has been discussed above. In addition, IL-10 can also accelerate the resolution of inflammation and exert a protective effect on atherosclerosis by mediating macrophage reprogramming (Han & Boisvert, 2015) (showed in Figure 5a).

As described above, Ampomah et al. (2022) reported that efferocytosis induces PGE2 production through the CD36/ERK/Ptgs2/COX2 pathway and that PGE2 could further induce TGF-β synthesis

FIGURE 5 The mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution: The association with atherosclerosis. In the lesion of atherosclerosis, the necrotic core comprises foam cells, apoptotic cells (ACs), debris and amount of phagocytic macrophages. Phagocytic macrophages perform the clearance of ACs, which leads to the suppression of inflammation and the improvement of atherosclerosis. (a) The depletion of pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2) promotes low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1)-dependent efferocytosis and inhibits the proinflammatory phenotype. Apoptotic cell (AC)-derived DNA is hydrolyzed by phagolysosomal DNase2a to generate nucleotides that promote the proliferation of reparative macrophages through the DNA-PKcs/mTORC2/Myc pathway, in which the MerTK/ERK1/2 pathway is also necessary. (b) In macrophages, lack of CaMKIIγ can increase the expression of MerTK via ATF6/LXRα pathway, and LXR activation can promote the production of specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) via regulating lipoxygenases (LOX). In addition, macrophage ornithine decarboxylase can promote the synthesis of putrescine to increase MerTK expression. Then, MerTK induces the production of IL-10 via activation ERK1/2. During the efferocytosis process, CD36/MEK promotes the activation of ERK1/2, but this is unfortunately insufficient owing to an ERK-DUSP4 negative feedback pathway. AC-derived methionine produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that can be used to induce DUSP4 methylation through DNA methyltransferase-3A (DNMT3A), leading to the reduction of DUSP4 and the enhancement of ERK1/2 activation that regulates the Ptgs2/COX2 pathway to induce PGE2 production and subsequent TGF-β biosynthesis.

through the EP₂/₄ receptors, contributing to the regression of atherosclerosis. In addition, the protective role of PGE2 and TGF-β in atherosclerosis has also been reported in several other studies, and the mechanisms are associated with anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties (Tajbakhsh et al., 2018; Weinstock et al., 2021). As summarized above, effective efferocytosis also up-regulates Arg-1 expression in macrophages, which is always accompanied by M2 polarization, although direct evidence in animal models of atherosclerosis has not been obtained. Arg-1 can metabolize AC-derived arginine and ornithine to produce putrescine, which positively regulates Dbl/Rac1-mediated second-AC internalization, leading to continuous efferocytosis (the increase in the ratio of ACs associated with Mac2⁺ macrophages : total ACs) and the regression of atherosclerosis (Yurdagul et al., 2020). In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect of Arg-1 also contributes to the attenuation of atherosclerosis (showed in Figure 5a).

Macrophages are the predominant cells performing efferocytosis in atherosclerosis, which can be regulated by SPMs, anti-inflammatory molecules, transcription factors, other immune cells and even metabolic processes. In macrophages, AC corpses undergo membrane recycling, cholesterol metabolism and efflux, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism (Doran et al., 2020).

These effective metabolic processes lead to immunological tolerance, along with macrophage reprogramming (such as to the reparative phenotype), proresolving mediator production and the felicitous regulation of adaptive immunity. In macrophages of patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, elevated PKM2, an enzyme regulating energy metabolism, has been reported. In *Ldlr*⁻/⁻ mice fed a high-fat Western diet for 14 weeks, myeloid cell-specific deletion of PKM2 resulted in the upregulation of LRP-1 and enhancement of macrophage efferocytosis, contributing to the regression of lesions in the whole aorta and aortic sinus (Doddapattar et al., 2022). As a consequence, the depletion of PKM2 inhibited the expression of MCP-1, IL-1β and IL-12, suggesting that the depletion of PKM2 dampens the macrophage proinflammatory phenotype (Doddapattar et al., 2022). As described above (Ampomah et al., 2022), AC-derived methionine is metabolized to methionine-derived SAM, which is used by DNMT3A to methylate Dusp4. The methylation of Dusp4 leads to the relief of the ERK-DUSP4 negative feedback pathway that lowers phospho-ERK, resulting in the enhancement of phospho-ERK and finally promoting the synthesis of TGF-β, which usually represents the reparative phenotype in macrophages (Ampomah et al., 2022). In addition, AC-derived nucleotides can be used to activate a DNA-PKcs/mTORC2/Rictor pathway, which up-regulates Myc to promote

proresolving macrophage proliferation, contributing to the regression of atherosclerosis (Gerlach et al., 2021). Therefore, the metabolic process after AC engulfment plays an important role in transforming macrophages to the reparative phenotype, and the deterministic molecular mechanisms may provide useful targets in the treatment of atherosclerosis (showed in Figure 5b).

In a previous study, myeloid cell-specific deletion of SIRPα, a receptor of the ‘don't eat me’ signal, promoted macrophage efferocytosis, inhibited cholesterol accumulation, facilitated lipid efflux and induced the M2 macrophage phenotype (Singla et al., 2021). In addition, blocking CD47, an important ‘don't eat me’ signal, could also enhance macrophage efferocytosis in atherosclerosis, in which LRP is necessary (Mueller et al., 2022). Upregulating CD47 via miR-149-5p mediated by IncRNA MI-associated transcripts could inversely dampen effective efferocytosis (Ye et al., 2019). CaMKIIγ is activated in plaque macrophages from humans and mice with advanced atherosclerosis and has been reported to inhibit MerTK expression. The silencing of CaMKIIγ by a siRNA nanoparticle platform targeting CaMKIIγ ultimately increases MerTK expression in macrophages, promotes the efferocytosis of ACs and leads to atherosclerosis regression (Tao et al., 2020). It may be interesting to modulate CD47, SIRPα, CaMKIIγ and other key molecules mediating the recognition, engulfment and degradation of ACs by neutralizing antibodies, miRNA and other methods in the treatment of atherosclerosis.

The efferocytosis inducing the Treg cell response has been discussed above. However, direct evidence of this mechanistic process is still absent in atherosclerosis. In atherosclerotic mice, the expansion of Treg cells improves efferocytosis (Proto et al., 2018), and the depletion induced by the CD25 antibody impaired effective efferocytosis (Sharma et al., 2020), indicating that Treg cells are important proresolving immune cells in the adaptive immune response. Enhancement of Treg differentiation through different manners may provide therapeutic effects in atherosclerosis.

In terms of knowledge of the association between mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution and atherosclerosis, we summarized a series of representative compounds or molecules that may exert an effect in atherosclerosis. Other than the proresolving mediators mentioned above, AnxA1 may also have regulated effect in atherosclerosis. Fredman et al. (2015) showed that administration of AnxA1-derived Ac2-26 could promote IL-10 production and attenuate atherosclerosis in mice. In addition, Ang-(1-7) as well as its mimic AVE0991, as the stimulation of macrophage efferocytosis, could also mitigate atherosclerosis through mediating plaque inflammation (Skiba et al., 2017). Since the tightly integrated metabolic rewiring in macrophages plays a critical role in the digestion of AC-debris and maintaining immune tolerance, this complicated process may provide novel ideas for treatment. As described above, the LXR and PPAR are important regulated receptors in this process. R211945, the agonist of the LXR, has been reported to reduce inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques of rabbit, contributing to the treatment of atherosclerosis (Vucic et al., 2012). Delivering a LXR agonist specifically through a sequential-targeting nanoplatform could

activate the LXR in macrophages, accelerate inflammation resolution, enhance plaque stability and reduce plaque size (Wang et al., 2022). In addition, the protective effect of PPAR agonists against atherosclerosis has also been summarized in a previous review (Ivanova et al., 2017). In addition, the enhancement of glutaminolysis could promote mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increase ATP production in macrophages, which is necessary for the effective efferocytosis of neutrophils by macrophages in atherosclerosis (Merlin et al., 2021), indicating that targeting glutaminase-1 or increasing energy supply in macrophages may be promising routes to attenuate atherosclerosis in patients.

In summary, the better understanding of the mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution in atherosclerosis may promote more novel ideas for treatment, such as proresolving mediators, drugs that accelerating efferocytosis and interventions targeting the critical molecules that promoting inflammation resolution.

### 4.2 Myocardial injury and repair

To clear dying cells and prevent secondary cytokine storms, efferocytosis is necessary for cardiac injury and repair after MI or ischaemia/reperfusion injury. For example, MerTK-dependent efferocytosis of apoptotic cardiomyocytes results in accelerated inflammation resolution and increased secretion of **vascular endothelial growth factor A** (VEGFA), improving cardiac repair after MI (Howangyin et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2013). The inactivation of macrophage mineralocorticoid receptors could improve cardiac remodelling by enhancing efferocytosis of infiltrated neutrophils after MI (Fraccarollo et al., 2019). In addition, both sustaining the expression of MerTK via secreted extracellular vesicles from cardiosphere-derived cells and increasing the number of reparatory Ly6C^low^MerTK^high^ macrophages via the blockage of alarin S100A9 could promote effective efferocytosis and positively impact cardiac recovery after MI (de Couto et al., 2019; Marinković et al., 2020) (showed in Figure 6).

A previous study showed that the co-incubation of ACs and macrophages increased oxygen consumption rate and IL-10 production in macrophages, and this process was determined by fatty acid oxidation, but not glycolysis (Zhang et al., 2019). In detail, AC-derived fatty acids promote IL-10 synthesis through mitochondrial β-oxidation and regular electron transport, which increases the ratio of NAD⁺/NADPH. Then, the enhanced NAD⁺ activates SIRT1 to promote Pbx-1 that binds to the AC response element of the IL-10 promoter, ultimately increasing IL-10 expression and improving cardiac repair after ischaemia/reperfusion injury (Zhang et al., 2019). Cardiac resident macrophages are characterized as CCR2⁻ and always manifest reparative properties (Hu et al., 2022). DeBerge et al. (2017) found that resident cardiac MHCII^low^CCR2⁻ macrophages express higher levels of MerTK and have a strong ability to phagocytize ACs, which was evaluated by the double labelled staining of mCherry⁺ ACs and CD11b⁺Ly6C^low^Ly6G⁻F4/80⁺

FIGURE 6 The mechanisms of efferocytosis in determining inflammation resolution: The association with myocardial injury and repair. Acute myocardial infarction (acute MI) or cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury can result in a large amount of apoptotic or necrotic cardiomyocytes and induce massive infiltration of neutrophils that usually undergo apoptosis during the phase of inflammation resolution. These apoptotic cells (ACs) are engulfed and digested by macrophages (defined as efferocytosis), leading to the accelerated resolution of inflammation. Macrophage engulfment of ACs or degrading of AC corpses in LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) can increase TGF-β, Arg-1 and VEGFA expressions, all of which promote inflammation resolution and contribute to the attenuation of cardiac injury post MI or ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Fatty acids derived from AC digestion undergo mitochondrial β-oxidation to activate SIRT1/Pbx1 pathway, inducing the production of IL-10 that exerts its proresolving or reparative effects on cardiac injury.

macrophages, promoting the secretion of reparative mediators (IL-10 and TGF-β) and contributing to the improvement of cardiac repair after MI (shown in Figure 6).

Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury induces a large number of stress-induced senescent cells (SISCs), and effective macrophage efferocytosis of these apoptotic SISCs can favour macrophage transformation to a reparative type (Lee et al., 2021). Similarly, engineered neutrophil apoptotic bodies that simulate natural neutrophil apoptosis can stimulate macrophages to produce IL-10, Arg-1 and TGF-β and to display an anti-inflammatory phenotype in vitro and improve cardiac function after MI in vivo (Bao et al., 2022). As described above, LC3-II-dependent phagosomes play a critical role in the degradation of AC corpses, and the dysfunction of this process can visibly dampen macrophage efferocytosis. In an animal study reported by Jia et al. (2022), specific *legumain* depletion in cardiac resident macrophages impaired the formation of LC3-II-dependent phagosomes around secondary-encountered apoptotic cardiomyocytes and led to diminished efferocytosis and enhanced CCR2⁺ macrophage infiltration, along with reduced IL-10 and TGF-β expression, indicating that effective efferocytosis is needed for maintaining a reparative phenotype and anti-inflammatory mediators (Figure 6). In addition, the macrophage reparative phenotype could also be promoted by proresolving mediators, such as SPMs, AnxA1 and Ang-(1-7). For example, Ferraro et al. (2019) showed that AnxA1 treatment could enhance macrophage reparative or proangiogenic phenotype and increase VEGFA production, contributing to the neovascularization and myocardial repair. Therefore, enhancing the engulfment and degradation of ACs (such as through LAP) through different methods or targeting IL-10, Arg-1, TGF-β, SPMs and AnxA1 will be beneficial for myocardial repair (Figure 6).

5 | CONCLUSIONS

Efferocytosis induces the rapid clearance of ACs and prevents secondary necrosis and proinflammatory factor release, leading to the resolution of inflammation and tissue immunological tolerance in multiple inflammatory diseases. In addition to this direct function, efferocytosis can also exert its proresolving effect by mediating several other proresolving mechanisms, such as dampening proinflammatory signalling, producing SPMs, inducing other proresolving molecules (including IL-10, Arg-1, TGF-β, PGE2 and AnxA1), modulating the macrophage phenotype and promoting the Treg cell response. During these processes, molecules participating in the recognition and engulfment of ACs, such as TIM receptors, TAM receptor tyrosine kinases and LRP, may play a critical role and are regarded as promising targets in treatment. During the degradation of ACs, AC-derived lipids, amino acids and nucleotides undergo tightly integrated metabolic rewiring, recognize nuclear receptors, regulate LOX, COX and Ca²⁺/CaMK pathways or participate in epigenetic modification, to promote proresolving reprogramming. However, the roles of these key mechanistic molecules are not completely understood. An understanding of these roles may provide novel ideas for drug research and development, especially in atherosclerosis and myocardial injury.
