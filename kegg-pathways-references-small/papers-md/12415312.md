# A positive look at double-negative thymocytes

Rod Ceredig and Ton Rolink

In some respects, our understanding of the cellular and molecular aspects of early T-cell differentiation is lagging behind that of B cells. Papers describing gene-knockout and reporter-transgenic mice in which thymocyte development is affected are often difficult to interpret. Progress in this field will be hampered unless a more detailed phenotypic and molecular analysis of progenitor thymocytes at the single-cell level is carried out.

The thymus is the primary lymphoid organ where T cells are generated¹. Anatomically, the thymus is divided into an outer cortex, where most of the differentiation takes place, and an inner medulla, where newly formed cells undergo final maturation before exiting and seeding peripheral lymphoid organs². Despite being an integral part of the haematopoietic system, the thymus does not contain self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells. In adults, the thymus is continually seeded from the bone marrow by small numbers of progenitor cells, which reach the thymus in the blood stream³ and enter at the cortex–medulla boundary⁴,⁵. To discover the identity of these bone-marrow-derived progenitors and how they are lineally related to their downstream intrathymic progeny remains one of the main challenges of developmental immunology. Despite the sophisticated molecular approaches that are used to study thymocyte development — including gene-knockout⁶, inducible-knockout⁷ and promoter-driven transgene reporter systems⁸ — analysis of the early intrathymic progenitor compartment remains relatively imprecise. This is in contrast

Figure 1 | Comparative scheme of early T- and B-cell development. In this scheme, cell development from less mature to more mature cells proceeds from left to right. For the T-cell scheme, the alternative nomenclature (double negative, DN) is included for comparison. Gene rearrangements are shown boxed in red and the cell-surface phenotype of each subpopulation is shown below it. Fluorescence intensity, as measured by flow cytometry on an arbitrary scale from negative (-) through low to very bright (+++), is indicated for each marker. BCR, B-cell receptor; D, diversity; DP, double positive; Ig, immunoglobulin; ISP, immature single positive; J, joining; RAG, recombination-activating gene; SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency; SP, single positive; TCR, T-cell receptor; V, variable.

to the B-cell lineage, for which extensive single-cell analyses of both gene transcription and immunoglobulin gene-rearrangement status, combined with clonal cell-culture systems, have contributed greatly to our detailed understanding of early B-cell development^{9,10}. FIGURE 1 shows a comparative scheme of early B- and T-cell development. It should be noted that, compared with B cells^9, no efficient culture system exists for growing immature thymocytes. In the bone marrow, where a block in B-cell development is only partial^11, changes in the size of individual progenitor compartments are often small, but nevertheless provide useful information^12. We would encourage a similar concerted approach to the analysis of early T-cell development.

**The double-negative subsets**

Using flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies specific for CD4 and CD8 antigens, a rapid consensus was achieved regarding models of thymocyte differentiation. On the basis of the expression of these two antigens,

thymocytes could be subdivided into several subpopulations: ~5% express neither CD4 nor CD8 (double-negative, DN cells); ~80% express both CD4 and CD8 (double-positive, DP cells); ~10% express only CD4 (CD4 single-positive, CD4SP cells); and ~5% express only CD8 (CD8SP cells)^{13}. These subpopulations appear sequentially during thymus ontogeny and DN cells differentiate *in vitro*^14; therefore, it seemed natural that the intrathymic progenitors would be found in the DN-cell population (see FIG. 2 for a scheme for the preparation of DN cells). Once the T-cell receptor (TCR) genes had been identified, their rearrangement was shown to occur during thymocyte development (reviewed in REF. 15). Functional T cells were found to express either an αβ or a γδ heterodimeric TCR, with both types of TCR being expressed at the cell surface in association with CD3. Using CD3-specific antibodies, DN thymocytes were found to be heterogeneous, containing CD3⁻ progenitors, as well as CD3⁺ ‘mature’ cells^16. The latter

contained a mixture of CD3⁺TCRαβ⁺NK1.1⁺ (REF. 17) and CD3ᵈᵘˡˡTCRαβ⁺NK1.1⁺ (natural killer T, NKT) cells^18. The term ‘triple negative’ (TN) was given to DN cells for which the CD3⁺ subpopulation either had been excluded or was absent^19.

Subsequently, a search began for markers to identify intrathymic T-cell progenitors. Two markers stood out — namely, **CD25** (REF. 20) and Pgp-1 (REF. 21), later known as **CD44** (FIG. 3). Given that most, but not all, CD25⁺ thymocytes are located in the outer cortex^20; expression of CD25 during embryonic development or thymocyte regeneration *in vivo* is transient^22; and expression of CD25 is lost rapidly on *in vitro* culture^23, it seemed probable that expression of CD25 was associated intimately with intrathymic progenitors. Now, we know that in the thymus, CD25 is not a unique marker of DN cells, but is also expressed weakly by CD25⁺CD4⁺ regulatory T cells that are generated intrathymically^24 and by pre-B2 cells that are found in the thymi of young mice^25.

Figure 2 | Preparation of double-negative thymocytes. This figure outlines a standard purification scheme using antibodies and complement to obtain double-negative (DN) thymocytes³⁵. Thymi are removed free of parathyamic lymph nodes; the latter are found lateral to the junction of internal mammary and internal jugular vessels, and in situations where thymus size is reduced, they can easily be removed in error. Cell suspensions are prepared in phenol-red-free culture medium without added serum, because phenol red increases background staining and serum proteins can inhibit complement activity. It is important to avoid centrifugation steps at this point as this results in cell clumping. In a 15-ml clear plastic centrifuge tube, 7 ml of cell suspension, containing 200 × 10⁶ cells, is mixed with 1 ml each of culture supernatant containing rat immunoglobulin M anti-mouse-CD4 monoclonal antibody (RL172.4; REF. 20) and rat IgM anti-mouse-CD8α monoclonal antibody (3.168.8.1; REF. 20). After a 10-minute incubation at 37°C, 1 ml of rabbit complement (Low-Tox, Cedarlane) is added and cells are incubated for a further 45 minutes at 37°C, taking care to gently mix the cell suspension thoroughly with a Pasteur pipette — this avoids cell clumping and a reduced yield of DN cells. The cell suspension is underlayered with 3 ml of pre-warmed Hypaque-Ficoll (specific gravity 1.077, Pharmacia) and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 20°C. The resulting viable cells are recovered at the interface and washed in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% fetal calf serum and azide). The level of recovery depends on several factors, but it never exceeds 50% of the initial DN-cell content of the cell suspension, as determined by flow cytometry. Depletion can be checked by restaining recovered cells with antibodies specific for different epitopes of CD8 (such as CD8β; clone 53-5.8) and CD4 (clone RM4-4).

Bob Hyman showed that CD44, an allelic marker (Ly24) with a wide tissue distribution, was expressed by a progenitor thymocyte subset that had TCRβ genes in the germ-line configuration²⁶, and that it was involved functionally in thymic colonization²¹. There are many isoforms of CD44, which are derived from a gene with at least ten variable exons that are differentially spliced to the ‘standard’ molecule²⁷. There is important variation between mouse strains in the expression of CD44 by peripheral T cells and thymocytes²⁸. Mice of the 129 strain express three times less CD44 on DN thymocytes than C57BL/6 mice, which makes studies of knockout mice on the mixed 129 × C57BL/6 background problematic. The intensity of CD44 expression on DN thymocytes varies over three logs of fluorescence, and more work is required to correlate the expression of CD44 variants with adult mouse DN subsets²⁹.

Using multi-colour flow-cytometric analysis of CD44 and CD25 expression, DN cells can be divided into subsets, and many groups have tackled the question of their interrelationships²²,³⁰,³¹ (reviewed in REFS 32,33). Using a collection of TCR- and recombination-activating gene (Rag)-knockout mice, Godfrey and Zlotnik confirmed the presence of four main subpopulations of DN cells and placed them in a differentiation scheme³⁴. The phenotypic progression from CD44⁺CD25⁻ (known as DN1) through CD44⁺CD25⁺ (DN2) to CD44⁻CD25⁺ (DN3) and, finally, CD44⁻CD25⁻ (DN4) cells, as proposed by these authors³⁵, was adopted rapidly and remains in widespread use today. In this scheme, DN1 cells are, nevertheless, heterogeneous. Progression of normal thymocytes beyond the DN3 stage requires the rearrangement of TCRβ genes and functional expression of a TCR complex on the cell surface. Later work, involving CD3ε-knockout³⁶ and pre-TCR α-chain (pTα)-knockout³⁷ mice, confirmed that for progression beyond the DN3 stage, a signalling-competent pre-TCR complex is required.

### Additional refinements

To refine the analysis of DN subsets and, in particular, to identify T-cell progenitors among DN1 cells, Godfrey *et al.* included the expression of **CD117** (c-kit, the receptor for stem-cell factor)¹⁹,³⁸,³⁹. However, the combined CD44/CD25/CD117 model has not been adopted routinely and, at best, DN cells are labelled as simply CD117⁺ or CD117⁻, although there are exceptions²⁵,⁴⁰. The level of expression of CD117 by DN thymocytes is very broad and, depending on staining strategy, spans two to three logs of fluorescence intensity, with a distinct subpopulation of brightly stained cells (FIG. 3, BOX 1 and TABLE 1). As originally defined³⁸, T-lineage cells in the DN1 and DN2 subsets are CD117⁺⁺ (bright), whereas DN3 cells gradually lose expression of CD117. Using a negative-depletion strategy, Wu *et al.* identified so-called CD4low cells, a DN1 subset with progenitor activity⁴¹. In fact, in the adult thymus, both CD117⁺⁺ pro-T1 and pro-T2 cells are CD4low, and neither type of cell is eliminated by anti-CD4 antibody plus complement-mediated depletion. CD117⁺⁺ DN1 and DN2, CD117⁺ DN3 and CD117⁻CD44⁻CD25⁻ DN4 cells are known as pro-T1, pro-T2, pre-T1 and pre-T2 cells, respectively, and to draw parallels with B-cell development, this is the terminology that we will use for the rest of this article.

#### Importance of CD117 expression level

Within the total pro-T1 cell population, other lineages, including dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells, express intermediate levels of CD117 (FIG. 3). In the bone marrow, haematopoietic stem cells⁴² and the recently described early lymphocyte progenitor (ELP) are both CD117⁺⁺ (REFS 42,43), but committed progenitors — including B220⁺/−AA4.1⁺ CD127⁺ common lymphocyte progenitors (CLPs)⁴⁴, CD19⁺B220⁺ heavy-chain diversity and joining region (Dₕ-Jₕ) un-rearranged pro-B cells¹⁰, and Dₕ-Jₕ rearranged and Vₕ (heavy-chain variable region) to DJₕ rearranging pre-B1 cells — express CD117 at intermediate levels¹⁰.

#### Common lymphocyte progenitors

Given the current interest in **Notch** and the possibility that CLPs colonize the thymus⁷, the intermediate level of expression of CD117 on bone-marrow CLPs⁴²,⁴³ becomes relevant. Recently, using a transgenic mouse system in which expression of green-fluorescent protein (**GFP**) is controlled by the **Rag1** promoter, analysis of the bone marrow has revealed the presence of so-called early lymphoid progenitors (ELPs)⁴³.

Some GFP⁺ ELPs were present in a fraction of CD117⁺⁺ bone-marrow cells and other GFP⁺ cells were present among the DN1 thymocytes. Clearly, additional investigations are required using this and other transgenic mouse lines. The role of Notch in lymphoid lineage choice has been discussed extensively. Notch has been implicated in αβ versus γδ, and CD4 versus CD8, lineage choice, the survival of DP thymocytes and perturbations of thymocyte selection. The effect of inducing Notch inactivation in the T-cell lineage depends crucially on the timing of such deletion. Deletion of Notch in the bone marrow or ectopic expression in the thymus of *lunatic fringe*, a modifier of Notch1 signalling, results in the accumulation of B cells in the thymus; thymic CLPs were not shown directly in these studies. Early deletion of Notch in thymocytes has little effect on T-cell development, whereas deletion at the pro-T2–pre-T1 transition inhibits VDJβ rearrangements and subsequent TCRαβ differentiation. The high level of expression of CD117 on thymic pro-T1 and pro-T2 cells corresponds to that on haematopoietic stem cells, and not that on CLPs. Phenotypically, pro-T1 thymocyte populations with an intermediate level of expression of CD117 (CD117<sup>int</sup>; see FIG.3) do not contain CLPs, and using a high plating-efficiency cell-culture system, B-cell progenitors cannot be grown from the adult thymus; pro- and pre-B cells can only be found in the thymus of young mice at ages when they are present in the circulation. New data indicate that culturing bone-marrow CLPs in interleukin-7 (IL-7) actually reduces their T-cell developmental potential. Taken together, these studies question whether the steady-state normal adult thymus is colonized by CLPs; few studies have unambiguously shown the presence of CLPs outside the bone marrow in adult mice, and Igarashi *et al.* conclude that, as yet, there is no direct evidence for the commitment of CLPs outside the bone marrow.

Other bipotent progenitors. Apart from CLPs, other bipotent cells in the thymus have been described. The issue of bipotent cells and how to assay for them *in vitro* has been reviewed recently. Indeed, of the different combinations of bipotent cells, the T/B bipotent cell was the only one not to have been detected *in vitro*. In the fetal thymus, NK/T bipotent cells have been described and the surrogate DX-5 marker do not label progenitor NKT cells, some of which are CD122⁺ (REF 54). Among the total DN1 cells, many NK1.1⁺ cells are also CD122⁺, CD127⁺ and CD117⁺, which makes it difficult to

separate NK/NKT progenitors from CD117⁺⁺ pro-T cells. T/macrophage progenitors have been described in both the fetal thymus and transgenic mice. Finally, bipotent T/DC progenitors have been described frequently. Recently, however, developmental dissociation of the T-cell and DC lineages has been found in growth-factor-deficient mice, which calls into question the existence of such cells at the clonal level. To resolve these issues, a more careful, clonal analysis of pro-T1 differentiation potential, using the multilineage progenitor assay, is required.

**PERSPECTIVES**

New markers for double-negative cells? Why are additional markers required for the identification of DN cells? Without consideration of CD117 expression, pro-T1 and pro-T2 cells are difficult to identify and quantify accurately. To identify pro-T1 cells, for example, most studies use a negative-selection strategy — that is, staining total thymocyte suspensions with a ‘cocktail’ of lineage-specific markers, followed by an analysis of CD44 and CD25 expression by ‘gated’ lineage-negative cells. The CD44 and CD25 distribution pattern of gated cells is then arbitrarily subdivided into

Reproduced, by permission of Oxford University Press, from REF. 25. For staining, 10⁶ purified DN cells are incubated in 200 μl of staining buffer containing saturating concentrations of CD25–FITC, CD117–PE and CD44–APC conjugates. After 30 minutes at 4°C, cells are centrifuged and resuspended in staining buffer containing propidium iodide (PI). Cells are analysed by flow cytometry, using samples stained with each reagent alone for compensation settings. Lymphoid cells are gated according to combinations of forward- and side-scatter signals, as well as negative staining for PI. Care must be taken in establishing lymphoid gates, and back-gating — that is, verification that fluorescent signals from cell subpopulations are all included in the lymphoid gate — should be used routinely. Cells with forward-scatter signals of lymphocytes, but relatively high side scatter, are obtained from thymocyte suspensions passed over Ficoll; these cells have a CD44⁺⁺CD25⁻ (DN1/pro-T1) phenotype, but are not T-lineage cells (not shown).

Box 1 | Some technical considerations

Flow cytometry is an ideal experimental approach for the study of thymocyte differentiation. Thymocyte suspensions are easily prepared and have very low autofluorescence and background staining. The number of cell-surface-bound fluorescent molecules that is necessary to generate a clear signal above background ${ }^{107}$ is in the order of $1 \times 10^{3}-5 \times 10^{3}$. Fluorescence detectors generate an integrated electronic signal that is proportional to the number of fluorescence photons emanating from the labelled cell; the absolute level of this signal is controlled by electronic amplification. For monomeric antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies, the final ratio of fluorochromes to cell-surface molecules depends on many parameters, including the number of staining steps, the nature of the fluorochrome and the fluorochrome to antibody ratio. Growth-factor receptors are expressed frequently at a level of 50–100 molecules per cell ${ }^{108}$, which is below the detection limit of flow cytometry. Cellular responsiveness to the ligand is a more sensitive readout of the expression of functional surface receptors. The opposite situation can apply when the receptor is multimeric. Double negative 3 (DN3) pre-T1 cells express CD25 (REF. 20), the $\alpha$-chain of the IL-2 receptor complex (IL-2R$\alpha$), but do not respond to IL-2 because other components of the IL-2-receptor signalling complex are not expressed in sufficient quantity ${ }^{20,23}$. Lack of responsiveness to cytokines can also be due to the absence of functional intracellular downstream signalling components.

Using directly conjugated anti-CD3 antibodies, pre-T1 cells were regarded as CD3 ${ }^{-}$. However, using indirect immunofluorescence, whereby primary unlabelled anti-CD3 antibodies are revealed with either labelled secondary antibodies ${ }^{109}$ or a triple-staining strategy ${ }^{110}$, some pre-T1 cells are positively stained, which indicates pre-TCR expression. Forward light scatter (FLS) signals from cells are proportional to cell size, and relative FLS signals can be used as a comparative measure of cell size. Finally, a combination of surface antigen density and relative cell size can influence the fluorescent signal that is obtained (TABLE 1). With constant surface antigen density, increasing the cell diameter by 50% increases both cell-surface area and fluorescent intensity by a factor of 2.25. Therefore, cells of similar size but differing in fluorescence intensity might belong to different lineages or differ in antigen biosynthesis. One example of this is the expression of the non-T-cell-specific antigen CD90 (Thy-1) by thymocytes. Expression starts at a low level on pro-T1 and large pro-T2 cells, increases to a high level on small and large double-positive cells, and becomes intermediate on medium-sized single-positive and peripheral T cells ${ }^{73}$. This reflects the complex tissue-specific regulation of the CD90 gene ${ }^{111}$. Such issues are also relevant to the expression of CD117 by bone-marrow progenitors, common lymphocyte progenitors and DN thymocyte subsets.

# IL-7 and pro-T cells

One marker with an expression level that is clearly different on CD117<sup>++</sup> pro-T1 and pro-T2 cells is **CD127**, the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (**IL-7R**) complex. By flow cytometry, only 12% of pro-T1 cells stain weakly for CD127, whereas 70% of pro-T2 cells are IL-7R<sup>+</sup>. Most CD127<sup>+</sup> DN1 thymocytes are NKT cells<sup>62</sup> or, as is the case in the bone marrow<sup>43</sup>, NK cells. Cell-culture experiments have indicated that pro-T1 cells require many cytokines for survival, whereas for pro-T2 cells, IL-7 alone is sufficient<sup>38</sup>. This difference in cytokine requirements was taken to indicate that pro-T1 cells are the progenitors of pro-T2 cells, although direct evidence for this is still lacking. The addition of IL-7 and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (**Flt3**) to either fetal thymus organ cultures (FTOCs) or stromal cells plus IL-7 cultures does not lead to the clonal expansion of pro-T cells (BOX 2). Using IL-7-knockout mice, it was shown that the **Bcl-2** protein content of pro-T1 cells, but not pro-T2 cells, is independent of IL-7 and of IL-7R signalling<sup>63</sup>. For pro-T1 cells, stem-cell factor (**SCF**, c-kit ligand) might be responsible for upregulating IL-7R expression and function<sup>64</sup>. In contrast to the effect of IL-7 on B cells, crossing an MHC-class-II-promoter-driven *IL-7* transgene, which is overexpressed in the thymic stroma<sup>65</sup>, into Rag-knockout, TCRβ.Rag-knockout or *CD3ε*-knockout mice does not lead to the clonal expansion of CD117<sup>++</sup> pro-T1 cells. For pro-T2 cells, expression of CD127 seems to correlate with αβ versus γδ lineage commitment<sup>66</sup>, and signals through the IL-7R seem to promote TCRγ rearrangements<sup>67</sup>. Taken together, these data imply that functional IL-7R might not be expressed on pro-T1 cells, a finding that challenges most models of early thymocyte development.

## Cell number

The calculation of progenitor-cell number is important in the context of either a partial block or a promotion of differentiation. Mice that have mutations in genes that affect B-cell development — for example, *Rag*<sup>6</sup> or **λ5** (REF. 11) — have alterations not only in cellular phenotype, but also in the number of cells in the various B-cell progenitor pools. In Rag-knockout mice, the number of bone-marrow CD117<sup>+</sup> pro-B cells is increased by about fourfold, which reflects a block in differentiation at the pro- to pre-B1 transition<sup>10</sup>. Similarly, in λ5-knockout mice, for which the block in B-cell differentiation is partial, there is an accumulation of pro- and/or pre-B1 cells and a relative depletion of downstream CD25<sup>+</sup> pre-B2 cells, CD25<sup>-</sup>IgM<sup>-</sup>

immature B cells and IgM<sup>+</sup> mature B-cell progeny<sup>10</sup>. Introduction of a prematurely expressed immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) transgene into normal or *Rag-* or λ5-mutant mice promotes B-cell development and depletes the progenitor pool<sup>68</sup>. Introduction of an IL-7-encoding transgene into these mutants then leads to a discernible increase in the number of bone-marrow pro- and/or pre-B1 cells and a marked increase in the number of pre-B2 cells<sup>12</sup>.

In situations of altered thymocyte differentiation, for example using prematurely expressed TCR transgenes<sup>34,69</sup>, the overall numbers of DN and DP cells have been reported and the percentage of cells in each DN subset is shown, but the details of possible effects on transition through the DN stages are often missing. When total thymocyte cellularity is reduced — for example, in Rag-knockout, *CD3ε*-knockout and *pTα*-knockout mice — the numbers of CD117<sup>++</sup> pro-T1 and pro-T2 cells are reduced by a factor of about 100 for Rag-knockout mice and 50 for *CD3ε*-knockout or *pTα*-knockout mice, without a concomitant increase in the number of thymic B cells<sup>25</sup>. The reduced number of progenitor thymocytes in Rag-knockout mice is in contrast to the effect of the same mutation on B-cell progenitors in the bone marrow. In Rag-knockout mice, most DN1 cells are NK cells, whereas in *CD3ε*-knockout and *pTα*-knockout mice, they are a mixture of NK cells, NKT cells<sup>39</sup> and, depending on the age of the mouse, B cells<sup>25</sup>.

On the basis of the progenitor thymocyte numbers given above, it might be that the size of the thymus dictates the number of niches that are available for progenitor-cell occupancy. This is unlike the situation in the bone marrow, where the absence of one lineage is generally compensated for by an increase in the number of cells that are unaffected by the mutation. The presence of mature cells in the thymus clearly has a trophic effect on the growth and function of both thymic stromal cells<sup>70</sup> and the thymic vascular bed<sup>71</sup>. Together, these effects could markedly alter the size and cellular composition of niches that can support the growth and differentiation of pro-T cells<sup>60</sup>. Information regarding the absolute numbers of pro-T1 and pro-T2 cells in the thymi of mutant mice might help to localize these thymic niches and identify their cellular and molecular composition.

### Cell entry

In the developing embryo, progenitor cells migrate through the extracellular matrix along a chemokine gradient towards the developing thymic anlage<sup>72</sup>, and once they have passed through the fibrous capsule, they begin to proliferate and differentiate. The descendants of these fetal progenitors undergo a semi-synchronous wave of development that can be studied either *in vivo*<sup>73</sup> or *in vitro* using FTOC<sup>74</sup>. FTOCs can be re-colonized as either ‘hanging drops’ or ‘reaggregated’ FTOCs<sup>75</sup> (BOX 2). In hanging drops, progenitors reach the thymus capsule by gravitational force and cell entry depends on integrin expression<sup>76</sup>. This assay measures the ability of cells to penetrate the lobes, as well as their subsequent differentiation. In reaggregated cultures<sup>75</sup>, progenitors are incorporated directly into suspensions of dissociated thymic stroma, which then reform thymic lobes that include the progenitors. Fetal lobes can be recolonized with either fetal or adult progenitors. Adult stroma performs relatively poorly in reaggregated FTOC, but the use of purified stromal cell progenitors might resolve this issue<sup>77</sup>.

For the adult thymus, the experimental system of choice has been bone-marrow chimaeras<sup>78</sup>, which are often criticised because of the possible effects of irradiation on perturbing progenitor-cell entry. Using this method, donor progenitors, often known as ‘pro-thymocytes’, can be either fetal or adult progenitors<sup>5</sup> or cloned B-cell lines from **Pax5**-deficient mice<sup>59</sup>. They enter the thymus through blood vessels at the cortex–medulla boundary<sup>4,5</sup>; later, donor cells appear in the outer cortex. The thymus can be seeded either directly by ‘pro-thymocytes’ in the donor bone-marrow cell suspension or indirectly by ‘pro-thymocytes’ that develop in haematopoietic colonies in the post-irradiation spleen<sup>79,80</sup>. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the two cohorts of donor cell in the recipient thymus are linearly related. Wu *et al.* have shown recently that in chimaeras, most of the bone-marrow-derived cells that enter the thymus initially and proliferate are not of the T-cell lineage<sup>81</sup>. Movement of progenitors from the cortex–medulla region to the outer cortex is thought to be driven by chemokines<sup>82</sup>. Differences between fetal and adult thymocyte development have been proposed. Results from mice that lack the transcription factors **Ikaros**<sup>83</sup> or **Tcf1** (REF. 84), and IL-7R-deleted mice<sup>85</sup>, as well as differences in the expression of **Pax5** between fetal-liver and adult CLPs<sup>86</sup> and the steroid-hormone sensitivity of fetal compared with adult progenitors<sup>87</sup>, tend to confirm this possibility<sup>88</sup>. The final maturation of SP thymocytes in the medulla is clearly much quicker in the fetal thymus than in the adult thymus<sup>2</sup>.

Using parabiosis, Goldshneider *et al.* showed recently that under steady-state conditions, the entry of progenitor cells into the

Box 2 | Experimental systems to study T-cell development

Fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC)
In this culture system<sup>74,75</sup>, T-cell differentiation can be studied *in vitro*. There are clear differences between cells derived from FTOC and the equivalent cells *in vivo*<sup>74</sup> — in particular, the relative enrichment for γδ T cells in FTOC. Fetal thymus lobes are removed from embryos of between 14 and 16 days gestation and cultured on cell-impermeable filters at a gas–liquid interface. The filters, on which 6–10 lobes are placed, can be either floated on culture medium or supported on gelatine foam bathed in medium. The gas concentration in the incubator can be varied; high oxygen concentrations favour αβ, rather than γδ, T-cell development. Care should be taken when using lobes from embryos before day 14 of gestation as progenitors are in the process of migrating into the thymus and are often inadvertently removed with the fibrous capsule<sup>72</sup>.

Reaggregated FTOC
Here<sup>75</sup>, thymus lobes are depleted of endogenous T-cell progenitors by treatment with deoxyguanosine, a chemical that blocks the nucleotide metabolism of T-cell progenitors specifically. The surviving stromal elements are then enzymatically dissociated to generate single-cell suspensions, to which functional progenitors are added. When centrifuged together, the resultant cell ‘slurry’ reaggregates and reforms thymus lobes, including the added progenitors. These are then returned to standard FTOC conditions. For ‘hanging-drop’ cultures, lobes depleted of endogenous progenitors are re-colonized by placing them intact in culture medium containing added progenitors in the wells of a Terasaki plate, which is then inverted. In this inverted configuration, progenitors fall by gravity onto the lobe, adhere to it, migrate in and then begin to differentiate.

Stromal cells plus IL-7 cultures
In this system<sup>9</sup>, confluent cultures of a bone-marrow-derived adherent stromal-cell clone are lethally irradiated and cell suspensions containing B-cell progenitors are added in culture medium that contains a saturating concentration of interleukin-7 (IL-7). This culture method has a high plating efficiency (approximately one cell in three) for B-cell progenitors. Although pro-T and pre-T cells do not grow in these cultures, this system can be used to grow B-cell and other progenitors from the thymus.

Bone-marrow chimaeras
In this experimental system, animals are created in which haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic elements are genotypically different. Host mice are given a dose of irradiation that is sufficient to destroy their own haematopoietic system and then reconstituted with bone-marrow cells from a genotypically different mouse strain as a source of donor haematopoietic stem cells. Generally, host and donor cells express different alleles of a cell-surface molecule for which specific monoclonal antibodies exist. Shortly after reconstitution, donor cells can be identified in the recipient thymus, and approximately four weeks later, mice are chimaeric, with all haematopoietic elements being derived from the donor. However, as described originally by Kadish and Basch<sup>78</sup>, the thymus is reconstituted initially by the host’s own ‘radio-resistant’ intrathymic progenitors.

Parabiosis
As an alternative to bone-marrow chimaeras, so-called ‘parabiotic’ mice can be generated. Here, the blood circulation of mice that have different genotypes is joined surgically through a flap of skin. Once the vascular connections are established, there is free exchange of circulating cells, including haematopoietic progenitors, between animals. However, this is not a stress-free experimental situation.

Two-photon real-time confocal microscopy
Using excitation with more than one laser and cells labelled with more than one fluorochrome, recent developments in confocal microscopy allow the analysis of live cells in culture. This system is ideally suited to study of the movement of cells in FTOC<sup>112</sup>.

thymus and their subsequent proliferation are two separate events<sup>89,90</sup>. The thymus allows progenitor entry intermittently, and cells that have entered begin to differentiate only when the previous progenitor cohort has been depleted. Progenitor entry, which might be regulated by the thymus, is cyclical with a periodicity of about 15 days. This has led to the idea of a thymus ‘gate’ that controls progenitor entry and subsequent differentiation. Taken together, the sporadic opening and closing of the thymus gate and the apparent lack of specificity for entry might complicate attempts to characterize progenitors. Studies of progenitor-cell movement in the thymus<sup>4</sup> will be aided greatly by two-photon real-time

on lineage choice^{101,102}. For lymphocytes, the rearrangement of V<sub>H</sub> or V<sub>β</sub> genes in cells with pre-existing DJ<sub>H</sub> or DJ<sub>β</sub> rearrangements marks the stage when commitment to the B- or T-cell lineage, respectively, becomes irreversible^{100}. T and B cells can contain DJ rearrangements, but never VDJ rearrangements, of receptor genes of the other lineage. All haematopoietic lineages can be derived from DJ<sub>H</sub>-rearranged Pax5-deficient pre-B1-cell clones^{59,103}. For T cells, progressive lineage commitment occurs as cells traverse the pro-T1 and pro-T2 stages, becoming irreversible at the pre-T1 stage.

### Concluding remarks

To help resolve some of the questions concerning thymocyte development, a more concerted effort needs to be made to analyse gene transcription and DNA rearrangements in single cells of the pro-T1, pro-T2 and pre-T1 subsets. In this context, some preliminary results have been reported, including limiting-dilution^{8} and single-cell^{104} PCR analysis of pTα gene expression by pro-T1, pro-T2 and pre-T1 cells^{105}. The frequency of cells that contain pTα transcripts increases by about 100-fold from pro-T1 to pre-T1 cells, but it never reaches 100% even at the pre-T1 stage^{105}. Because the pTα protein might be absent or in limited supply in some pre-T1 cells, it is unclear whether all pre-T1 cells with functional VDJβ rearrangements that express TCRβ proteins in their cytoplasm^{106} can express a pre-TCR complex at the cell surface. For pre-B1 cells, the equivalent stage in B-cell development, not all of the IgH proteins that are present in the cytoplasm are necessarily expressed at the cell surface^{10}. At this stage, IgH proteins are selected for their ability to pair with the pre-BCR components λ5 and Vpre-B. The possibility that there is TCRβ repertoire selection at the pre-T1 stage^{106} has not been explored fully. As discussed previously^{96}, this has important implications for any model of αβ versus γδ T-cell lineage commitment. To facilitate the molecular analysis of early thymocyte development and to make progress in the field, ‘designer’ transgenic mice, containing a non-functional or deleted TCRβ locus on one allele and a knocked-in TCRβ minilocus on the other allele, would be a useful addition. In this regard, T-cell biologists could take a leaf from the B-cell biologists’ handbook.
