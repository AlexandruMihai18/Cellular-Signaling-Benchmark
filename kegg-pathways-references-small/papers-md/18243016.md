### Abstract

The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by an immense number of bacteria that are in a constant dialog with our immune cells. One obvious question is how the mucosal immune system maintains a state of hypo-responsiveness toward the commensal bacteria and a state of readiness that allows efficient and prompt responses against pathogens. The answers have important implications for immunologists who seek to understand the fundamental aspects of bacteria–immune cell interactions in the steady-state condition and wish to elucidate the patho-physiologic mechanisms in immune dysregulations, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. An important adjustment of the immune system to bacterial colonization of the gut is the “constitutive” production of IgA by the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). In this review, we summarize the sites and mechanisms for IgA synthesis in mice. We emphasize the important role played by secretory IgAs in maintenance of an appropriate intestinal microbiota, which is required for local and systemic immune homeostasis.

### 1. Introduction

The gut is a site of extraordinary complex and dynamic interactions between a large variety of bacterial species and an extensive network of cells that includes the GALT. About \(10^{14}\) bacterial cells, at densities that range up to \(10^{12}\) organisms/ml intestinal content are separated from our internal milieu by a single layer of epithelial cells. Bacterial communities in the gut have a wide-ranging impact on host physiology and immunity [1]. They make essential contribution to nutrient metabolism, i.e. some bacteria metabolize dietary substances that are otherwise indigestible by the hosts [2,3]. In turn, bacteria take advantage of a protective and nutrient-rich environment. Indigenous bacteria also appear to compete with other microorganisms and thus to confer protection against colonization with potential pathogens. Besides these functions, and perhaps the most important is the role played by the gut microbiota in education of our immune system [4–6]. Multiple studies revealed that animals kept in sterile conditions (germ-free) have impaired mucosal epithelial barrier, disorganized lymphoid structures, immature immune cells (less numbers of B and T cells) and very low levels of isotype-switched immunoglobulins (Ig). Indeed, a conspicuous response of the gut immune system that follows the microbial colonization is the production of IgA. In humans, at least 80% of all plasma cells are located in the gut lamina propria (LP) and together they secrete more IgA than any other Ig isotypes combined [7].

The development of IgA B cells in the gut has been extensively studied, and although our understanding remains incomplete, there are few well defined concepts, that provide a solid working platform. It is generally accepted for example, that the IgA B cells are most efficiently generated in organized follicular structures such as Peyer’s patches (PPs) [8]. Generation of IgA in PPs depends on induction of a special microenvironment, called germinal centre (GC) that allows strong interactions between B cells, T cells and antigens trapped on stromal cells (SCs), and facilitate B cell proliferation, induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and subsequent class switch recombination (CSR) from IgM to IgA [9–13]. It is increasingly clear that gut IgA plasma cells are being generated also by complementary pathways, in either organized structures other than PPs (i.e. isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) present throughout the gut) or in non-organized tissues (i.e. LP of the small and large intestine) [13–17].

Many questions remain however. Are these alternative pathways functionally redundant or complementary to PPs? Where does IgA class switching take place? How are the B cells activated in the gut? What interactions regulate IgA switching in the gut? What is the role of intestinal IgA?

In this review we discuss recent studies that shed light on the sites, mechanisms and function of IgA in the gut. We discuss the contribution of gut microbiota to the development of GALT and emphasize the role of IgA in regulation of bacterial communities in the small intestine.

Recently, RORγt expressing cells with a surface phenotype similar to embryonic CD3⁻CD4⁺IL-7R⁺LTi cells (LTi-like cells) were observed in both CPs and ILFs of adult mice and both of these structures are absent in the RORγt-deficient mice [36]. It is thus clear from all these observations that ILFs formation requires multiple cell types such as RORγt⁺LTi-like cells, LTβR and TNFR-expressing SCs, as well as the presence of bacteria. However, the exact function of each type of cells and how bacteria influence their interactions and activation leading to organization of ILFs is not yet known.

## 2. Development of major sites for generation of gut IgA

The primary inductive sites for IgA responses in the gut include the organized lymphoid aggregates that are present in the wall of the small and large intestine. Some follicular structures are already present at birth, like PPs and B cell-less structures called cryptopatches (CPs) while others, such as ILFs develop only after colonization of the intestine with bacteria [14,18].

Formation of PPs requires multiple interactions between hematopoietic cells and stromal cells in a very precise time window during embryogenesis [19,20]. A recent study identified the tyrosine kinase receptor (RET) as a key regulator of PP organogenesis [21]. RET, known to be essential for the enteric nervous system formation, is apparently involved in initiating the events that lead to production of lymphotoxin (LT) β by hematopoietic cells and subsequent attraction of CD3⁻CD4⁺IL-7R⁺ cells, called lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells into the PP anlagen [22]. LTi cells are absolutely required for PP and LN formation. The development of LTi cells depends on the inhibitory HLH transcription factor Id2 and the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor RORγt, because lack of LTi cells and subsequent failure of PPs and LNs development were seen in Id2 and RORγt-deficient mice [23–25]. Survival of LTi cells however requires IL7R, and over-expression of IL7 results in increased number and size of PPs [26]. Upon stimulation through IL-7R, LTi cells express high levels of LTα1β2 and trigger the activation of SCs through the LTβR and the downstream NF-κB pathway through NIK, a kinase defective in alymphoplasia *aly/aly* mice [22,27,28]. Several feedback loops necessary for formation of PPs involve chemokines and adhesion molecules, such as CXCR5-CXCL13 and CXCR5-induced α4β1 integrin–VCAM-1 interactions [29].

Unlike PPs, ILFs develop only after birth. ILFs represent probably the most dynamic compartment in gut, because the number, size and cellular composition of ILFs are highly variable, depending on the bacterial load in the intestine (see later discussion). Such a high developmental plasticity strongly suggests that ILFs function as sensors of intestinal bacteria that may play an active role in the induction of local immune responses [30,31]. The formation of ILFs requires LTα1β2–LTβR interactions and TNFRI function, because LTα⁻/⁻, LTβ⁻/⁻, LTβR⁻/⁻, *aly/aly* and TNFRI-deficient mice do not develop ILFs [14,32–34]. CCR6 expression by B cells appears to be also required for development of ILFs [35].

## 3. Structures and microenvironments for generation of mucosal IgA

PPs consist of multiple B cell follicles built on a stromal scaffold and bridged together by clusters of T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) [37]. The epithelium that covers PPs contains M cells, special cells that are considered to be the major site of antigen entry to the mucosa [38,39]. Certainly, the vast majority of PPs lymphocytes are activated cells residing in GCs. In conventionally reared mice, GCs are continuously found in the PPs, and these structures contain a higher proportion of actively dividing IgA B cells than GCs from spleen or peripheral LNs, induced after immunization [4,8]. PP DCs are most likely responsible for initiating and directing the IgA immune responses that follows the antigen entry. Indeed, PP DCs induce preferential switching from IgM to IgA, partly through their secretion of IL6 and production of retinoic acid (RA) [40,41]. Not only that DCs participate to local IgA induction within PPs, but also PP DCs uploaded with bacteria and migrating into MLNs have been shown to direct preferential CSR to IgA in vitro [42]. However, we do not know if the induction of gut IgA and generation of PP GCs is a consequence of direct signals through TLRs on DCs or B cells [43,44] or other cells, such as SCs. Mucosal but not peripheral B cells are driven into GCs through the interaction of innate immune receptors with microbial antigens, independent of BCR specificity [45]. T cells are required for this reaction, and their recruitment also depends on innate immune mechanisms [45]. The recently discovered role of microRNAs in regulating the T cells differentiation and GC reaction together with direct observations using two-photon microscopy are likely to shed light on the mechanisms and dynamic cell interactions within the GCs [46–50].

Unlike PPs, ILFs are composed of a single cluster of B cells built on SCs, surrounded by a large number of dendritic cells (DCs), and few T cells interspersed between B cells. Although GCs and IgA B cells were also detected in the ILFs, it is still unclear if ILFs serve as inductive sites for pathogen-specific immune responses or if they are responsible for the induction of IgA against commensal bacteria [51,52]. The mechanisms of generation of IgA in ILFs are unknown. It is also not clear whether IgA B cells or IgA plasmablasts generated within the ILFs directly migrate to the LP or, they recirculate through the blood as described for IgA B cells induced in PPs (see later discussion).

4. IgA and IgM B cells migration to the gut LP

It is thought that IgA B cells or IgA plasmablasts migrate from the PPs to the draining MLNs and via the thoracic duct lymph and blood home back to the LP of the gut [53, 54]. The key receptor-ligand pair involved in traffic of IgA B cells is α4β7 integrin expressed by lymphocytes and MadCAM-1 addressin expressed by LP high endothelial venules (HEV) [55]. The preferential homing of IgA but not IgM or IgG B cells to the gut is explained by the high expression of CCR9. The CCR9 ligand is TECK/CCL25, a chemokine expressed in the small intestine, especially in epithelial crypts [56, 57]. Further migration into the LP of the villi may depend on CXCL12, as IgA B cells (as well as IgM and IgG cells) respond to CXCL12, and this chemokine is also expressed in the gut [56, 58, 59].

Not only IgA B cells but also some of the IgM B cells from the PPs also migrate to the LP. Similar to IgA B cells, IgM B cells that experienced the gut environment preferentially migrate to gut LP [60] (Fig. 1). Recent observations suggest that normal gut environment imprints gut-activated B cells with gut-seeking properties by gut DCs through their capacity to synthesize RA [41, 60].

However, multiple studies in genetically manipulated mice revealed that IgA plasma cells are generated in the absence of follicular organized structures, suggesting that some B cells directly migrate to the LP [36, 60–62]. A functional LTβR on LP stromal cells seems to be crucial for the presence of B cells in the gut LP. Indeed, LTα⁻/⁻, LTβR⁻/⁻ mice and aly/aly mice lack B cells in the LP and have extremely low to non-detectable levels of IgA intestinal secretions [60, 61]. Reconstitution of aly/aly with normal BM cells failed to restore the number of B cells and IgA

plasma cells in the gut, unless co-injected with NIK-sufficient gut SCs [60]. These facts, together with the observation that administration of LTβR antagonists after birth causes a marked decrease in the number of LP B cells and plasma cells, demonstrate the essential role of LTβR signaling for the presence of IgM B cells and IgA plasma cells in the small intestine [62]. The critical cells that provide LT and initiate LT-LTβR interactions in adult intestine remained unidentified. Functional characterization of SCs in the gut LP and the cross-talk between immune cells and SCs await further studies.

5. Recruitment of peritoneal B1 cells to gut LP

Another source of B cells that contributes to generation of intestinal IgA plasma cells is the peritoneal cavity, which harbors a special type of B cells, called B1 cells [63–65]. Peritoneal B1 cells express high levels of surface IgM and low levels of IgD, CD23 and B220. In addition to Mac-1, a significant fraction of peritoneal B1 cells expressing CD5, are known as B1a cells, while the remaining fraction constitutes B1b cells. Like marginal zone (MZ) B cells, B1 cells express high levels of integrins and CD9, a tetraspanin that associates with other surface molecules, like integrin β1 or α6, and regulates cell motility [66–68]. Although the number of B1 cells is relatively low compared with conventional peripheral B2 B cells, they have a significant contribution to low-affinity IgM antibodies that are present in serum of germ-free mice known as natural antibodies [69, 70]. Unlike the B1-derived natural IgMs, the production of IgA requires the presence of intestinal microbiota [71]. This indicates that the participation of B1 cells to gut IgAs is probably induced by antigenic stimulation. Indeed, germ-free

Fig. 1. Multiple pathways for migration of B cells and generation of IgA in gut. Schematic representation of gut, with organized follicular structures, such as Peyer’s patches (PP) and isolated lymphoid follicles (ILF) and diffuse tissues of lamina propria (LP). PPs are composed of a subepithelial dome rich in dendritic cells (DCs), T cells and B cell-follicles that contain germinal centers (GCs). In these structures, B cells undergo efficient class switch recombination (CSR) to IgA and somatic hypermutation (SHM) and acquire gut-seeking properties through enhanced expression of integrin α4β7 and CCR9 by the retinoic acid (RA) produced by DCs. Migration of both IgA and IgM B cells from the PPs into the intestinal villi takes place through the postcapillary venules (HEV) expressing MadCAM-1, requires CCR9-TECK interactions and is independent of NF-κB activation through LTβ-NIK of LP stromal cells (SCs). LTβR signalling through NIK on LP SCs is essential for their synthesis of CXCL13 and VCAM-1, which is most likely required for the recruitment of CXCR5 and integrin α4β1 expressing naïve B cells and peritoneal B1 cells into the gut. Once in the LP, after local activation and up-regulation of AID expression, these IgM B cells will switch and differentiate into IgA plasma cells in situ with the help of TGFβ and APRIL produced by SCs and DCs respectively. IgAs secreted into the intestinal lumen regulates both composition and appropriate segmental distribution of gut microbiota.

Fig. 2. Proposed model for the emigration of peritoneal B1 cells. B1 cells retention into the peritoneal cavity is most likely due to their high expression levels of integrins (i.e. α4β1) in association with tetraspanin CD9, which facilitates a stable attachment of B1 cells to the local matrix (i.e. VCAM-1). Signals through TLRs induced by bacteria or bacterial components induce detachment of B1 cells, through down-regulation of integrin-CD9 complexes. CD9 modulation and activation of G-protein coupled receptors by chemokines (such as CXCL13, CCL19) enhance motility of B1 cells through the extracellular matrix and facilitate their migration across the vascular endothelium.

mice accumulate significantly more numbers of B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity than mice kept in pathogen-free facilities but harboring diverse microbial communities [68]. Together, these observations suggest that a significant fraction of B1 cells are sensing the gut bacteria and are constantly induced to migrate out of the peritoneal cavity. Intestinal lesions induced by acute gut inflammation or direct stimulation of peritoneal B1 cells by TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or peptidoglycan (PG), induce a significant egress of B1 cells from the peritoneum and their re-localization to effector tissues, such as gut LP [68]. The molecular mechanism contributing to TLR-induced mobilization of B1 cells from the peritoneal cavity involves a coordinated down-regulation of integrins and tetraspanin CD9, and activation of G-protein coupled receptors [68,72]. Together, these changes allow detachment of cells from the local matrix and a high velocity movement in response to homeostatic chemokines (Fig. 2). Besides signals through TLR pathway, the chemotactic response of peritoneal B1 cells requires also a functional NIK, because peritoneal B1 cells from *aly/aly* mice, failed to generate IgA plasma cells even after transfer into RAG2−/− mice [73]. Recent observations suggest that peritoneal environment commits not only B1 cells but also splenic B cells with gut seeking properties, by up-regulation of integrin β7 as well as chemokine receptors such as CXCR5 and CXCR4 [74].

Unlike the IgA responses generated in the PPs, which require the help of T cells, IgA production by B1 cells seems to be T-cell independent [75]. This was shown in lethally irradiated T-cell-deficient mice, reconstituted with allotype-marked B1 cells together with host derived BM cells; most IgA plasma cells were derived from the peritoneal B1 cells.

6. IgA switching and generation of IgA plasma cells in the gut LP

Thus, there are multiple pathways for generation of IgA plasma cells in the intestine. Clearly, IgAs are generated in situ in the PPs. This is demonstrated by the presence of Ca germline transcripts and large amounts of AID, in IgM B cells located

may be sufficient to induce CSR independent of T cells, through a pathway that involves the engagement of BAFF receptors [86]. Human DCs were found to up-regulate BAFF and APRIL upon activation with LPS, IFNγ and IFNα, which can engage BCMA, BAFFR and TACI on the B cells [87]. In the presence of TGFβ, abundantly produced and probably also activated by SCs, these interactions induce preferential class switching to IgA, by enhancing the accessibility of the IgA locus and by up-regulating AID expression [13,87]. A recent study demonstrated that in response to stimulation by bacterial products such as LPS or flagellin, human epithelial cells also produce APRIL, thus leading to class switching from IgM or IgA1 to IgA2 in situ in the LP. Furthermore, activated epithelial cells by their secretion of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulate production of APRIL and IL10 by LP DCs thus augmenting local CSR. Collectively these observations indicate that the LP might be a site where T-cell independent IgA responses are triggered by intestinal bacteria.

### 7. Role of IgA in gut

The importance of IgA-mediated protection at mucosal surfaces is unquestionable. However, investigation of mice lacking IgA in their intestinal secretions, such as IgA⁻/⁻ mice, J chain⁻/⁻ or pIgR⁻/⁻ mice cast a doubt about the critical role of IgA for host protection. Under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, these mice appear healthy, although they have unusual phenotypes; more activated B cells in PPs (IgA⁻/⁻ mice) [88], impaired intestinal anti-toxin protection (J chain⁻/⁻ mice) [89] or elevated levels of serum IgG that reacts with gut bacteria [90] regardless of increased number of IgA plasma cells in the LP (pIgR⁻/⁻ mice) [91].

However, studies in AID-deficient mice, that secrete IgM into the intestinal lumen but lack IgAs, revealed that secretory IgAs play a critical role in regulation of gut bacterial communities in the small intestine [30].

The lack of somatically mutated IgAs in AID⁻/⁻ mice leads to an excessive anaerobic expansion in all segments of the small intestine and also activation of systemic B cells and induction of GCs [30]. Among the bacteria expanded, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), strict anaerobes that cannot be cultured, were identified as the dominant population strongly adherent to the epithelium of AID⁻/⁻ mice. The aberrant expansion of SFB is a common feature of gut IgA deficiency, and is seen also in RAG-2⁻/⁻ mice raised in SPF or germ-free SCID mice after SFB colonization [92,93]. SFB can penetrate epithelial cells and their antigens are most likely presented in situ in the epithelium and possibly in the LP [94,95]. Indeed, the continuous activation by these bacteria leads to an accumulation of lymphocytes in the intestinal villi of AID-deficient mice, which in time develops into hyperplasia of ILFs. An antibiotic treatment aiming at reducing the anaerobic bacteria or keeping the mice in germ-free conditions results in disappearance of ILF hyperplasia and recovery of normal states of B cells, namely reduction in numbers and also disappearance of systemically enlarged GCs [30,96]. Reconstitution of LP IgA production in AID⁻/⁻ mice or RAG2⁻/⁻ mice normalised the composition of gut flora and abolished the local and systemic activation of the immune system.

At least in vitro, dimeric IgA can neutralise LPS located inside the epithelial cells, and potentially prevent further pro-inflammatory responses [97].

Together these observations indicate that secretory IgAs together with epithelial cells play a critical role in regulating the composition of the microbial community in the gut and limit the acute local inflammation induced by proinflammatory pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as LPS [98–100].

## 8. Concluding remarks

Recent findings revealed new complexities of the regulation and biological importance of IgA generation in GALT. There is now strong evidence that mucosal IgA responses can be generated independent of PPs. Epithelial cells, DCs and SCs located in the gut are playing important roles for some of the non-canonical pathways for generation of mucosal IgAs. The overall functional consequence of IgA synthesis is to select and to maintain spatially diversified microbial communities in the gut. The absence of IgA homeostatic control results in deregulation of gut microbiota, which in turn causes activation of the whole body immune system. Further analyses of the interactions between immune cells, stromal cells and the bacterial populations in the gut are required to solve outstanding questions regarding the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for induction of immunity or tolerance in the intestinal mucosa. The challenge is to develop molecular and imaging tools, as well as experimental systems, including humanized mice to explore in vivo the complexity of host-bacterial interactions.
