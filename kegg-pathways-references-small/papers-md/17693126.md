Many of the biochemical conversions in plant steroid hormone biosynthesis are catalysed by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs or P450s). A recent paper by Toshiyuki Ohnishi et al. (2006) indicates the role of CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 in the synthesis of the most bioactive plant steroid hormone, brassinolide. These results highlight the need for refining the brassinolide biosynthesis pathway.

BR biosynthesis and cytochrome P450 enzymes

Guilt by association

Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are essential for normal plant development. Plants that are defective in BR synthesis have a characteristic dwarf phenotype and can be rescued to a wild-type phenotype when small amounts of BRs are applied exogenously. In the 1990s, dwarf mutants defective in cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s or CYPs) and α5-reductase were identified as being involved in BR synthesis. The mutants identified in Arabidopsis include: constitutive photomorphogenesis and dwarfism (cpd; defective in CYP90A1) [1], dwarf4 (dwf4; defective in CYP90B1) [2] and deetiolated2 (det2; defective in α5-reductase) [3], and in tomato: extreme dwarf (dx), which is a mutant of CYP85A1 [4,5]. The fact that the majority of these genes are P450s is not surprising, because the biosynthesis of BRs requires multiple oxidative reactions that are typically catalysed by P450s. In Arabidopsis, there are ~270 P450 sequences present in the genome; these sequences have been classified with the same CYP number when the predicted amino acid sequence identity is greater than 40% [6,7]. Phylogenetic analysis of known BR-associated P450 sequences and their most closely related sequences in Arabidopsis (Figure 1) indicated a group of P450s that might be involved in BR synthesis (guilt by association), that is, CYP90C1, CYP90D1 and CYP724A1.

New BRC-23 hydroxylases

Although the phylogenetic analysis suggested that CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 were involved in BR synthesis, mutants defective in the CYP90C1 gene only exhibited a weak dwarf phenotype and no phenotype was associated with a T-DNA insertion in CYP90D1 [8]. Lines that were homozygous for mutations in both of these genes generated a characteristic BR-dwarf phenotype, which was suggestive of CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 having redundant functions in BR synthesis. However, this earlier work did not provide conclusive evidence as to the exact role of these enzymes in BR synthesis [8]. The recent Plant Cell paper by Toshiyuki

Figure 1. Phylogenetic Tree of Arabidopsis P450s associated with BR synthesis and metabolism. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the MEGA 3.1 program [20] and CLUSTALW [21] sequence alignment of Arabidopsis CYP protein sequences obtained from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with the GenInfo Identifier (gi) number provided. The tree used the neighbour-joining method (Bootstrap value, 1000) and p-distance mode. Numbers at branch points represent the percentage of replicate trees in which the sequences clustered together in the bootstrap test. CYP734A1 and CYP72C4 are BR-metabolising P450s and CYP51G1 and CYP710A1 are involved in Arabidopsis sterol synthesis. All other CYPs are discussed in the main text.

Ohnishi *et al.* [9] has clarified the function of these P450s, which have been shown to be C-23 hydroxylases.

This advance in our understanding in the pathway has been made possible through Toshiyuki Ohnishi *et al.* carrying out the recombinant expression of BR biosynthesis enzymes and *in vitro* analysis of their biochemical activities [9]. Both CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 were able to convert a variety of substrates to their respective 23-hydroxylated form, including (22S,24R)-22-hydroxyergost-4-en-3-one, (22S,24R)-22-hydroxy-5α-ergostan-3-one and 3-epi-6-deoxocathasterone. Of interest was the poor conversion of two putative substrates (22S)-22-hydroxycampesterol and 6-deoxocathasterone. This suggested that a new preferred synthesis route leading to the production of brassinolide (BL) exists that shortcuts the need to synthesize certain intermediates in the pathway, for example, 6-deoxocathasterone and 6-deoxoteasterone.

### A new BR Synthesis pathway

Initially, the BR biosynthesis pathway was based on the analysis of endogenous BRs and conversion products of potential intermediates in *Catharanthus roseus* cell cultures. Mutants defective in BR synthesis provided novel tools to characterize further the pathway via both phenotypic rescue experiments and the analysis of endogenous BR levels. One of the first major revisions to the BL synthesis pathway was made after the discovery of many C-6-deoxo intermediates, which led to the idea of two major pathways, namely the early and the late C-6 oxidation pathways [10]. Subsequently, it was suggested that BL synthesis occurs via a 'metabolic grid' in which the order of oxidation at certain C atoms was somewhat arbitrary [11]. However, the analysis of endogenous BR intermediates and the new insights in enzyme activities as indicated in the paper by Toshiyuki Ohnishi *et al.* suggests a new route to BL. Figure 2 highlights a new putative pathway with notable differences in comparison to those previously reported.

A major change in the pathway has been the need to redefine the biochemical activity of CPD (CYP90A1), which was previously reported as a C-23 hydroxylase [1]. Toshiyuki Ohnishi *et al.* suggest that this enzyme is involved earlier than the C-23 hydroxylation step in the biosynthesis pathway. This might be expected as teasterone has been shown to rescue the *cpd* mutant phenotype [1], which indicates that CPD is not likely to catalyse the C-2 hydroxylation or C-3 isomerisation reactions that occur after the formation of 6-deoxoteasterone and teasterone. A possible reaction that CYP90A1 might catalyse is the oxidation at the C-3 position early in the pathway; however, this remains to be clarified.

The relocation of DET2 (which has 5α-reductase activity) in the pathway after the C-22 hydroxylation step is because of the recent discovery that CYP90B1 prefers to hydroxylate campesterol rather than campestanol [12].

### The future pathway

The analysis of endogenous BR levels in plants indicates that, in many cases, C-6-deoxo-BRs predominate, and that, in *Arabidopsis*, one key 6-deoxo compound: 6-deoxocathasterone, accumulates to relatively high levels. Further experimentation is therefore required to determine how CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 activities influence the levels of this compound and its significance in BR synthesis. Similarly, mutants defective in both CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 do not accumulate predicted precursors, which might have been expected, and implies that further careful analysis of these and other mutants will be required to refine the pathway further.

In addition to these experiments, there are still steps in BR synthesis that are not fully characterised, such as the C-2 hydroxylation and the isomerisation at the C-3 position. Further work therefore needs to be carried out to clarify whether these reactions are catalysed by P450 enzymes or by, for example, a dioxygenase or a flavin monooxygenase. Similarly, it will be important to see how universal the pathway is within a plant (i.e. in different tissues) and also between species. For example, it is known that CYP724P450s can catalyse C-22 BR hydroxylation in rice [13] and tomato [14]; however, how the CYP724P450 function maps onto the *Arabidopsis* BR synthesis pathway is yet to be defined.

To date, the focus of unravelling the synthetic route has been on BR analysis of extracts from vegetative tissues. The major route to the most bioactive steroid in any one tissue, however, might vary and more data are therefore required to discern whether different tissues and organs produce different BRs via modifications in the pathway. For example, it is known that tomato fruits contain large amounts of BL whereas in vegetative tissue castasterone predominates [15,16]. Another key area of future investigation will be the elucidation of whether metabolic channelling of substrates occurs between the biosynthetic enzymes as a complex with the NADPH P450 reductase in the endoplasmic reticulum. This can therefore make the pathway difficult to define.

Overall, the recent paper by Toshiyuki Ohnishi *et al.* highlights that it is an exciting time to be researching plant steroid hormone biosynthesis, and refinements in our understanding of the pathway will be eagerly awaited.

In their review of mitochondrial redox biology in plants, Graham Noctor *et al.* [1] discuss the role of stromules (stroma-filled plastid tubules [2,3]) in the transport of metabolites and proteins between cellular compartments. In contrast to their comment that no similar extensions have been described in mitochondria, we would like to draw attention to previous research showing that such protuberances are also common to both mitochondria and peroxisomes in plants (Figure 1) ([4–7]; and see movies by Professor Brian E.S. Gunning FRS available from <http://www.plantcellbiologyondvd.com>). Indeed, such membranous extensions have been reported to be emanating from mitochondria in chick spinal cord [8], from hydrogenosomes in trichomonad species [9] and from the apicoplasts of *Sarcocystis*, an apicomplexan parasite [10]. These membranous extensions are thus a feature common to endosymbiosis-derived organelles and peroxisomes.

Logan *et al.* reported that mitochondria, in a line expressing mitochondrial matrix-targeted GFP and homozygous for a T-DNA insertion in *DRP3A* (encoding an *Arabidopsis* dynamitin homologue), were larger in size and fewer in number per cell than in wild type, suggesting that *DRP3A* is involved in mitochondrial division [5,11]. An unexpected consequence of the disruption of *DRP3A* was the increased incidence of individual mitochondria displaying narrow protrusions, usually many micrometres in length, that we named ‘matrixules’ (following the name given to stromules). Matrixules are also observed in wild-type plants, and are similar in both appearance and behaviour to the tails formed during peroxisomal elongation as described by Cutler *et al.* [4]. Using random GFP:cDNA fusion proteins to visualize subcellular structures, Cutler and colleagues showed that peroxisomes can change from a spherical to an elongate morphology in a few seconds. This process begins with the production of a short tubular tail, which then rapidly expands to become longer than the original organelle (similar morphological changes in mitochondria have been recorded, (see Refs [5,7] and supplemental movies therein). Interestingly, *DRP3A* is involved in both mitochondrial and peroxisomal division in plants [5,12]. Mutations in this gene lead to peroxisomes with extended tails or ‘peroxules’ that, in root hairs, can reach over 50 μm in length [12]. One interpretation of these data is that matrixules and peroxules might be artefacts of defective organelle division.

However, given that (i) matrixules, peroxules and stromules are commonly found in wild-type plants, (ii) membranous protuberances are common to other endosym-
