# The Role of Efferocytosis in Atherosclerosis

---

**ABSTRACT:** The necrotic core has long been a hallmark of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Although apoptotic cells are cleared quickly in almost all other tissue beds, their removal appears to be significantly impaired in the diseased blood vessel. Emerging evidence indicates that this phenomenon is caused by a defect in efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic tissue is recognized for engulfment by phagocytic cells such as macrophages. Genetic and experimental data suggest that efferocytosis is impaired during atherogenesis caused by dysregulation of so-called eat me ligands, which govern the edibility of cells undergoing programmed cell death. The following is a summary of recent data indicating that efferocytosis is a major unappreciated driver of lesion expansion but also a reversible defect that can potentially be targeted as a means to prevent plaque progression.

**WHAT IS EFFEROCYTOSIS?**

Even in health, the human body turns over >1 million cells per second through a process known as programmed cell death or apoptosis. This process occurs for a variety of physiological reasons (eg, negative T cell selection) but is largely driven by the regular homeostatic turnover of aged and senescent cells. To remove these superfluous cells, the body engages in an evolutionarily conserved process known as programmed cell removal (PrCR) or efferocytosis. Efferocytosis is a term derived from Greek (meaning to carry the dead to the grave) and refers to the phagocytic engulfment of a cellular corpse. Both professional phagocytes (eg, macrophages) and nonprofessional (eg, neighboring) cells participate in efferocytosis.

Because the body must carefully ensure that only apoptotic cells are removed and there is no off-target clearance of healthy tissue, efferocytosis is a highly regulated process. Dozens of molecules have now been implicated in the cross-talk that occurs between a dying cell and a potential phagocyte, including (1) chemotactant find me ligands that recruit phagocytes to the area of cell death, (2) bridging molecules that play an opsonin-like role while linking phagocytes to their target cells, and (3) Cell-surface eat me ligands that physically engage and transactivate engulfment receptors on the phagocyte to initiate PrCR. It is important to note that these molecules are counterbalanced by so-called don't eat me ligands that are ubiquitously expressed on viable cells but rapidly downregulated during programmed cell death. Although these signaling pathways remain an area of intense research, it is clear that highly specific regulation of these apparently redundant eat me and don't eat me molecules ultimately determines whether a cell is viewed as inedible and thus ignored by a phagocytic cell or whether it will be marked for engulfment and clearance from the body.

EVIDENCE THAT EFFEROCYTOSIS IS IMPAIRED
IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS

An interesting aspect of efferocytosis is the speed and efficiency with which the process occurs.9,11 It has been estimated that under almost all conditions, cells undergoing apoptosis are recognized and targeted for clearance in a matter of minutes. Indeed, these cells are cleared so efficiently that it is nearly impossible to identify terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL)-positive apoptotic bodies (ABs) in any healthy tissue bed,12 including organs with high rates of cellular turnover, such as the thymus, tonsil, and bone marrow. In those rare instances when a pathologist is able to document an AB in healthy tissue, it is commonly in close proximity to a phagocytic cell. Such colocalization suggests that these apoptotic cells are in the process of being identified for clearance and likely would not have been observed had the tissue been sampled a few minutes later.

One of the few exceptions to this rule is within the atherosclerotic plaque. Unlike the rest of the body, free ABs (which are not in close proximity to macrophages or other professional phagocytes) are commonly observed in the growing lesion. Careful quantification of the numbers of free versus associated ABs led Martinet and colleagues13 to conclude that the capacity for efferocytosis is reduced ~20-fold in plaque compared with elsewhere in the body. Atheromas also contain far fewer phagocytes that have ingested multiple—as opposed to single—cellular corpses, again suggesting an impairment in efferocytosis.13 Although apoptosis is known to be increased during plaque formation, the capacity of the healthy phagocytes is normally so high that Tabas and colleagues6 concluded in their review that the problem is not the consequence of too much cell death but rather too little cell clearance.

HOW IMPAIRED EFFEROCYTOSIS MIGHT PROMOTE VASCULAR DISEASE

The accumulation of apoptotic and necrotic debris has long been associated with atherogenesis and plaque vulnerability.14–17 At its most simplistic level, expansion of the necrotic core can be viewed as contributing to plaque expansion, which in turn impinges on luminal flow, thus reducing coronary perfusion. However, impaired efferocytosis likely induces a number of other maladaptive changes beyond this mechanical impediment to blood flow. Many of these may be directly causal for atherosclerosis and plaque vulnerability.13

First, it is important to note that every time a phagocyte engulfs a dying cell it effectively doubles its intracellular content.18 Because mammalian cells have difficulty metabolizing cholesterol, efferocytes must initiate reverse cholesterol transport machinery to avoid the intracellular accumulation of the membrane-derived lipids they have just ingested. Normally, externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) present on the surface of apoptotic cells upregulates ABCA1 in macrophages, which promotes the efflux of cholesterol to ApoA1.18,19 It is interesting to note that necrotic cells (which also express PS) do not elicit a similar response,18 and defective efferocytosis signaling has now been shown to suppress critical reverse cholesterol transport pathways in vascular cells.19 The end result is the formation of foam cells, which are widely recognized as key drivers of atherosclerosis.

In addition to promoting salutary survival mechanisms that prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic cellular contents,20,21 physiological efferocytosis is also known to directly suppress inflammation. When a macrophage has successfully cleared a dying cell, beneficial factors such as Interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β are released, presumably to signal that no additional inflammatory cells need to be recruited to the site of injury.22 The opposite occurs when a phagocyte is unable to clear an AB, however, and nonresolving inflammation or autoimmunity may ensue.19,23,24 Thus, failed efferocytosis appears to trigger a molecular switch in phagocytic cells, converting them from champions of inflammation resolution to drivers of vascular inflammation.

A final point to consider is that the reason apoptosis is classically considered an immunologically silent form of cell death may be because dying cells are normally cleared before they have had the opportunity to undergo secondary necrosis.4,22 When efferocytosis is impaired, however, apoptotic bodies rapidly experience breakdown of their cell membranes, which leads to the release of previously sequestered intracellular contents into the interstitium.16 These factors, which include plaque destabilizing proteases,16 cytokines that promote plaque angiogenesis, and thrombogenic tissue factors,25 each could accelerate atherosclerosis and promote lesion vulnerability.

Taken together, defects in efferocytosis could theoretically affect much more than the physical growth of the interlesional necrotic core. They may also stimulate plaque inflammation (by release of chemokinetic cytokines), foam cell accumulation (by impaired reverse cholesterol transport), and plaque vulnerability (by atherothrombotic changes within the extracellular matrix). What has classically been viewed as a simple waste management issue may actually play a larger role in the vascular biology of atherosclerosis (Figure 1).

WHY IS EFFEROCYTOSIS IMPAIRED IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS?

It is not yet understood why efferocytosis is dysfunctional within the atherosclerotic plaque when it appears to be so highly preserved elsewhere throughout the healthy human body.13 Conceptually, the accumulation of apoptotic debris within the plaque must be caused by ≥1 of the following

**Figure 1. Impaired efferocytosis contributes to atherosclerosis.**  
Diseased and apoptotic cells in the growing atherosclerotic plaque are not recognized for efficient phagocytic clearance by lesional macrophages. Although the mechanisms that drive this pathology are still an area of active investigation, emerging data suggest that this defect may be due to impaired eat me (green) and don’t eat me (red) signaling that renders these cells inedible. As a result, foam cells accumulate to promote lesion expansion, and apoptotic tissue undergoes secondary necrosis to accelerate vascular inflammation and lesion instability.

problems as previously outlined by Thorp and Tabas<sup>6</sup>: (1) overwhelming apoptosis within the plaque, (2) impairment in the phagocytic capacity of lesional macrophages, or (3) reduced edibility of apoptotic vascular cells.

Although programmed cell death is certainly known to be increased during atherosclerosis,<sup>26</sup> experimental data suggest that the efferocytic system should have sufficient capacity to deal with this increase in apoptosis, at least initially.<sup>2,8</sup> For example, studies in which macrophage apoptosis is induced in the beginning stages of lesion formation have found that triggered cell death actually prevents plaque expansion and promotes lesion stabilization.<sup>27-29</sup> Similarly, forced smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis (accomplished by Bennett and colleagues<sup>30</sup> by cell-specific expression of the human diphtheria toxin receptor) has no deleterious effect in normal vessels and only becomes harmful when induced in the late stages of plaque development. Thus, investigators have concluded that overwhelming apoptosis is not the reason that uncleared cells accumulate in the diseased vessel wall, at least in the early stages of plaque development.

Conversely, several lines of evidence suggest that phagocytes may become less effective during atherogenesis. For example, macrophage skewing toward the proinflammatory M1 phenotype in the plaque may reduce the number of beneficial M2 macrophages, thus inducing a relative deficit of those macrophages known to have a high phagocytic capacity.<sup>31,32</sup> Additionally, reactive oxygen species such as peroxynitrite present in the plaque may impair the ability of macrophages to phagocytose ABs,<sup>13</sup> and dendritic cells are also known to have reduced efferocytic capacity as they mature.<sup>33,34</sup> Although lipid-laden foam cells have been shown to retain their phagocytic ability at least to some extent,<sup>13,35,36</sup> vascular SMCs, which are known to possess potent nonprofessional efferocytic capabilities,

lose this functionality when exposed to oxidized lipids.<sup>37</sup> Thus, it is highly likely that the number or ratio of competent efferocytes is reduced in or near the necrotic core either through direct loss (eg, apoptosis) or by the expansion of less effective phagocyte subpopulations (eg, M1 macrophages and foamy SMCs).

It is most important to note that diseased and dying vascular cells appear to become poor substrates, which are less appealing to phagocytic cells than apoptotic tissue elsewhere in the body. This outcome likely occurs for a number of reasons: (1) genetic changes in subjects predisposed to atherosclerotic disease, (2) inflammation-dependent modifications to efferocytosis signaling molecules within the plaque, and (3) the downstream sequelae of intralesional oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs).

First, studies investigating the heritable component of coronary artery disease have found that carriers of the top GWAS (genome-wide association study) risk allele<sup>38-40</sup> have reduced intraplaque expression of a key eat me ligand known as calreticulin (Calr).<sup>19</sup> As a result, these subjects develop larger lesions replete with diseased vascular cells that are presumably resistant to phagocytic clearance. The Calr axis is discussed in further detail later, but these data suggest that impaired efferocytosis may be the mechanism underlying the most important commonly inherited locus for atherosclerosis (the 9p21 locus) and may explain how these variants promote risk independently of all known traditional risk factors (eg, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking).<sup>41</sup>

Second, emerging evidence has now linked inflammatory signaling directly to intra-arterial defects in efferocytosis-related ligand expression (Figure 2). For example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a cytokine known to be causal for and upregulated in atherosclerosis, triggers expression of

a key don't eat me molecule known as Cluster of Differentiation 47 (CD47) on the surface of apoptotic vascular SMCs.⁴² Similarly, inflammation related to toll-like receptor signaling may suppress the expression of proefferocytic ligands such as MFG-E8,⁴³ and inactivating posttranslational modifications to other key eat me ligands such as MerTK and LRP1 are induced under inflammatory conditions,⁶,⁸,⁴⁴,⁴⁵ as discussed later. Because failed efferocytosis induces the secretion of TNF-α¹⁶ and TNF-α renders cells even more resistant to clearance, it is highly likely that an endless loop is active in the plaque, and this may explain why efferocytosis is so impaired during atherogenesis. These data directly support the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis.⁴⁶

Finally, the oxidized LDL present within the atherosclerotic plaque may also directly render apoptotic cells inedible.¹³ Oxidized LDL induces the generation of autoantibodies, which decorate and presumably mask oxidized eat me ligands on the surface of dying cells in the lesion.⁴⁷,⁴⁸ Oxidized LDL is also known to directly compete with ABs for scavenger receptors, making them less likely to be cleared through competitive inhibition.²³ Taken together, we are still learning why PrCR becomes defective during atherogenesis¹³ and with aging.⁴⁹ However, the problem appears to involve multiple pathways, including processes that impair the capacity of the phagocytes present in the plaque and factors

Experimental data suggest that prophagocytic signals (including calreticulin, milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor factor 8 [Mfg-e8], and Mer receptor tyrosine kinase [MerTK]) are reduced in atherosclerosis caused by inflammation, posttranslational modifications, and genetic variability. Exacerbating this loss of eat me signaling is a concomitant upregulation of the CD47-signal regulatory protein alpha don't eat me pathway, which furthers decreases the edibility of cells within the necrotic core. The end result is that apoptotic cells in the growing plaque become poor substrates for phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Such uncleared cells become secondarily necrotic and release additional proinflammatory stimuli, thus promoting a positive feedback loop.

that render diseased vascular cells less likely to be cleared. As with most other aspects of vascular biology, genetic and inflammatory factors appear to play central roles in the pathobiology of lesional efferocytosis and will likely emerge as areas of focus for future translational studies.

### PATHWAYS ALREADY SPECIFICALLY LINKED TO EFFEROCYTOSIS IN VASCULAR DISEASE

Several factors involved in PrCR have now been experimentally linked to apoptotic debris retention or necrotic core expansion in the growing atherosclerotic plaque (Table). These factors include the bridging molecule, complement C1q,^62^ the phagocyte receptor, transglutaminase 2,^63^ and potentially other eat me ligands, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and Fas.^65,67^ However, it is likely that some phagocytosis-related molecules have greater relevance to vascular disease than others, and emerging studies have identified a handful of efferocytosis pathways that appear to have a disproportionate impact on atherogenesis.

#### MFGE8

First among these molecules is the secreted glycoprotein, milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor (EGF) factor 8 (Mfge8, also known as lactadherin).^61^ Mfge8 functions as a bridging molecule that tethers the phagocyte to its target by simultaneously binding both αvβ3 integrin on the macrophage and externalized phosphatidylserine on the AB.^68^ Mallat and colleagues reported that Mfge8 is expressed in human vascular tissue but appears to be reduced in advanced plaque, particularly in lesions with a high burden of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. In animal models, atheroprone LDL receptor knockout mice (*ldlr*^−/−^) transplanted with *Mfge8*^−/−^ bone marrow developed systemic inflammation and advanced atherosclerotic plaques that had larger necrotic cores than control animals, although loss of Mfge8 did not directly increase the susceptibility of macrophages to apoptosis in vitro. It is important to note that Mfge8 may also bind directly to transglutaminase 2,^69^ another efferocytosis molecule previously linked to reverse cholesterol transport and plaque development.^63^ Taken together, these data suggest that Mfge8 produced by bone marrow-derived macrophages is necessary to maintain efferocytosis and prevent inflammation, and that loss of this factor may promote atherosclerosis.

#### MER RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE

The second efferocytic factor clearly linked to atherosclerosis is Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (*mertk*). This receptor is present on the surface of phagocytic cells and mediates engulfment of ABs by the critical bridging molecule Growth Arrest Specific 6.^70^ Mallat and colleagues^51^ previously reported that MERTK is present on macrophages (but not SMCs) in human atherosclerotic plaque, and that atheroprone *ldlr*^−/−^ mice transplanted with *mertk*^−/−^ bone marrow develop significantly larger lesions that have larger necrotic cores, more uncleared apoptotic cells, and increased inflammation relative to control animals. These findings were extended by Tabas and colleagues,^50^ who found that mice carrying a kinase-defective form of Mertk (*Mertk*^KD^) generated lesions with more TUNEL-positive cells and more plaque necrosis than control animals on the *apoe*^−/−^ background. Mertk is also required for the clearance of apoptotic cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, and its deficiency has been shown to promote cardiomyopathy in mouse models, extending its relevance to other cardiovascular disorders.^71^ It is interesting to note that the mertk receptor can be cleaved by metalloproteinases into an inactive soluble form, and this process leads to competitive inhibition of efferocytosis by providing a decoy receptor for Growth Arrest Specific 6.^44^ Because soluble mertk receptor shedding is enhanced by proinflammatory stimuli commonly observed in vascular disease,^44,72^ it is possible that this posttranslational modification may play a role in suppressing efferocytosis during atherogenesis.

#### CALR/LRP1 AND CD47

The final and perhaps most exciting PrCR pathway linked to atherosclerosis is that involving the prophagocytic Calr/Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1 (LRP1) axis and its counterbalancing "don't eat me" molecule CD47. Calr is a highly conserved chaperone protein that is now known to be upregulated and redistributed on the surface of cells undergoing programmed cell death.^10^ After physically associating with phosphatidylserine (the other key eat me ligand found on apoptotic cells), Calr transactivates LRP1 on the surface of adjacent phagocytic cells and induces engulfment. Emerging evidence suggests that Calr and LRP1 are critical mediators of efferocytosis, as supported by the fact that global knockout of either factor is embryonically lethal.^73,74^

Tissue-specific modulation of LRP1 has confirmed its central role in atherosclerosis. For example, *ldlr*^−/−^ mice lacking LRP1 in the SMC (*SM22Cre*^+^/*LRP1*^floxFlox^) develop dramatic, near-occlusive atherosclerotic lesions and aortic aneurysms.^52^ Similarly, a series of studies by Fazio and colleagues^53,54^ have confirmed that loss of LRP1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages impairs efferocytosis and promotes vascular inflammation, necrotic core accumulation, and lesion growth without having any impact on systemic lipid levels. The fact that loss of this efferocytosis receptor on either professional (eg, macrophages) or nonprofessional (eg, vascular SMCs) phagocytes was sufficient to significantly increase ath-

Erosclerosis highlights the importance of this pathway in vascular disease.

Although no studies have specifically investigated conditional or cell-specific knockout of Calr in murine atherosclerosis models, other evidence has confirmed a role for LRP1's proefferocytic ligand in the prevention of atherosclerosis. For example, carriers of the risk allele at the chromosome 9p21 GWAS locus have now been shown to have reduced intraplaque expression of Calr because of an inherited defect in TGFB signaling. 19, 39 Mice deficient in 1 of the top 9p21 candidate genes (Cdkn2b) have reduced Calr expression and develop markedly larger atherosclerotic plaques that have several features of lesion instability, including larger necrotic cores. 19 In vitro, apoptotic vascular SMCs deficient in Calr not only resist clearance by neighboring cells but also promote juxtacrine changes in cocultured macrophages, including a propensity to adopt a foam-cell phenotype, suppress reverse cholesterol transport, and secrete proatherosclerotic cytokines. It is interesting to note that these in vitro defects can be reversed with exogenous Calr peptide, suggesting that targeted reactivation of efferocytosis could prevent macrophage inflammation in atherosclerosis.

However, Calr is also expressed on some nonapoptotic cells, suggesting the existence of a counterbalancing mechanism that prevents the off-target clearance of healthy tissue. 10 Oldenburg and colleagues 1, 75 have now shown that the key don't eat me molecule CD47 fulfills this role by triggering anti-efferocytic signaling cascades downstream of the signal regulatory protein alpha receptor on phagocytic cells. During programmed cell death, CD47 is rapidly downregulated and redistributed away from Calr, thus allowing unopposed LRP1 activation and successful engulfment. 10 Paradoxically, CD47 is upregulated in atherosclerosis. 42 This surprising observation results from a TNF-α-dependent signaling cascade through nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, which blunts the fall in CD47 expression normally expected to occur during apoptosis. As a result, these apoptotic vascular cells are rendered inedible and presumably contribute to the growth of the necrotic core. Confirming the critical role of this pathway in atherogenesis, CD47-blocking antibodies were found to have a profound antiatherosclerotic effect in several mouse models, including the ability to prevent progression of established lesions, protect against plaque rupture, and induce regression of the necrotic core. 42 Taken together, the studies provide compelling evidence that perturbations in either proefferocytic Calr-LRP1 signaling or anti-phagocytic CD47-signal regulatory protein signaling is sufficient to cause atherosclerotic disease and prioritize these axes for additional investigation.

**OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRANSLATION**

Efferocytosis has tremendous potential as both a diagnostic and therapeutic target. For example, CD47 is

Kojima et al

upregulated in patients with plaque compared with no  
plaque and in subjects with symptomatic carotid disease  
(eg, those with transient ischemic attack or stroke) com-  
pared with those with an asymptomatic stenosis.⁴² Given  
the data that genetic variants may correlate with altera-  
tions in efferocytosis gene expression,¹⁹ a biomarker  
panel that combines genomic risk variants and expres-  
sion profiling⁷⁶ could have utility in diagnosing individuals  
at risk for clinical events caused by necrotic core expan-  
sion and plaque vulnerability.

Additionally, therapies that appear to specifically reacti-  
vate efferocytosis are already being tested in humans. In  
the oncology field, Weissman and colleagues⁷⁷,⁷⁸ have re-  
cently found that a major mechanism by which cancer cells  
evade the tumoricidal macrophage is by upregulating don't  
eat me molecules on their surface. Accordingly, developed  
humanized antibodies and decoy molecules interrupt  
these pathways and restore the phagocytosis of malignant  
cells.⁷⁹ Preliminary studies suggest that these therapies  
may have an acceptable toxicity profile in nonhuman pri-  
mates,⁸⁰ and phase I cancer studies are already underway  
(ClinicalTrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02678338). If  
these treatments are found to be safe and effective, then  
an unusual opportunity exists to leverage the experience  
of the immuno-oncology field and rapidly translate these  
treatments into the cardiovascular realm.

Further, diseases associated with impaired effero-  
cytosis seem particularly susceptible to combination  
therapies. In cancer models, antitumor antibodies such  
as rituximab synergize with proefferocytic therapies  
to dramatically accelerate tumor clearance.⁷⁹,⁸¹ Clear  
mechanistic justification exists to consider a similar ap-  
proach in cardiovascular disease, particularly given the  
link between vascular inflammation and the imbalance  
of efferocytosis ligand expression. As described earlier,  
levels of functional Mertk,⁷² LRP1,⁴⁵ and Mfge8⁴³ all ap-  
pear to be reduced under proinflammatory conditions.  
The hypothesis that anti-inflammatory therapies may  
restore proefferocytic signaling has specifically been  
tested in the case of CD47, which is now known to be  
directly downstream of TNF-α. Humans treated with  
the anti-TNF-α antibodies Infliximab or Etanercept have  
reduced in vivo expression of CD47, and mice treated  
with combination anti-TNF-α/anti-CD47 therapy display a  
modest incremental reduction in atherosclerosis over an-  
ti-CD47 alone.⁴² Given that patients treated with anti-TNF-  
α therapy for rheumatological conditions appear to be  
protected from myocardial infarction and other adverse  
cardiovascular outcomes,⁸² a strong rationale exists for  
combining directed anti-inflammatory and proefferocytic  
therapies in the treatment of atherosclerosis.

A final consideration is that proefferocytic therapies  
may provide an actionable opportunity for the often-men-  
tioned concept of precision cardiovascular medicine.⁸³  
Genetic studies pursuing the heritable component of  
cardiovascular disease have shown that the majority of  

genome-wide significant loci confer risk for myocardial  
infarction independently of all classical risk pathways,  
suggesting a novel mechanism of action not being ad-  
dressed by lipid lowering or antihypertensive thera-  
pies.³⁸,⁸⁴,⁸⁵ Given that the top GWAS locus is now known  
to be associated with a reduction in intravascular eat me  
ligand expression,¹⁹ it is highly likely that these individuals  
will particularly benefit from genotype-driven, proeffero-  
cytic therapy, similar to oncology patients who receive  
tailored chemotherapy directed against their personal  
cancer mutation. Although it is expected that all subjects  
with atherosclerosis will benefit from proefferocytic thera-  
pies, pharmacogenomic-based approaches could lead to  
outsized effects and even induce plaque regression.

**AREAS FOR FUTURE STUDY**

Although much has been learned about the role of effero-  
cytosis in atherosclerosis over the last decade, several  
aspects of this process have yet to be explored. A better  
understanding of the nuances surrounding these path-  
ways in health and disease should enhance our funda-  
mental understanding of vascular biology and facilitate  
the translation of these findings from bench to bedside.  
The first is the potential that proefferocytic therapies  
may have unanticipated drawbacks. For example, CD47-  
blocking antibodies are generally well tolerated but do  
induce erythrophagocytosis and anemia under some  
conditions.⁴²,⁷⁷ Although this toxicity can be ameliorat-  
ed with dose escalation or reduced-dose combination  
therapy approaches,⁴²,⁸⁰ other proefferocytic therapies  
may not be as specific for diseased tissue. Thus, the  
spatial and temporal changes in eat me and don't eat  
me ligands that must occur to render a cell susceptible  
to phagocytic clearance need to be defined. Likely, the  
ratio and physical colocalization of these molecules pro-  
vides an integrated signature that determines a cell's ed-  
ibility.¹⁰ Such information will explain how the body pro-  
tects against off-target clearance of healthy tissue and  
should inform the development of proefferocytic thera-  
pies that do not induce removal of viable cells. Along  
these lines, the local delivery of proefferocytic therapies  
(eg, with drug-eluting stent⁸⁶ or targeted nanoparticle  
technology⁸⁷) may prove highly effective and could have  
a superior safety profile.

Second, the link between cancer and cardiovascular  
disease requires further investigation.¹⁹,⁴² The recent  
finding that a common pathway may underlie growth  
of both tumors and atheromas raises questions about  
whether the clonal hypothesis of atherosclerosis needs  
to be revisited.⁸⁸ Cancer stem cells are now known to  
express high levels of CD47, and they may use this fac-  
tor to evade immune surveillance.⁸⁹,⁹⁰ Whether a similar  
process occurs on a preatherosclerotic clone could be  
investigated with advanced lineage-tracing modalities.  
Recent studies have suggested that far more plasticity

of vessel wall cells exists during atherogenesis than previously appreciated, 91, 92 and it may be that efferocytosis pathways are involved in such cell-fate decision making and expansion of a diseased subset of cells.

Third, the role of the vascular SMC in efferocytosis must be defined. Although many of the studies described earlier focus on macrophage phagocytosis, it is clear that other vascular cells also participate in efferocytosis during plaque development. Elegant in vivo lineage-tracing studies have now unequivocally confirmed that SMCs dedifferentiate and assume a macrophage-like phenotype during atherogenesis based on their ability to upregulate markers previously thought to be macrophage-specific, such as MAC-2. 91, 92 Although the physiological properties of these phenotypically modulated cells remains an area of intense investigation, in vitro studies suggest that these cells have reduced phagocytic capacity compared to bona fide bone marrow-derived macrophages. 93 Because careful quantification of advanced lesions from lineage-traced mice has shown that a significant percentage of lesional macrophages are actually of smooth muscle and not myeloid origin, 92 we must determine whether their efferocytic program is governed by pathways different from those reported in classical macrophages. If so, different therapies may be required to target specific components of the evolving lesion.

Finally, the intersection with related physiological pathways and vascular disorders should be pursued. For example, several classical cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, smoking and shear stress have been linked to efferocytosis. 94–96 Statins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists have been shown to enhance efferocytosis, and experimental data support the concept that enhancing blood flow or targeting of the angiotensin pathway could ameliorate defects in efferocytic signaling. 31, 95–97 Exciting new work exploring novel processes related to atherosclerosis, including necroptosis (programmed cell necrosis) 98 and autophagy, 99 has shown that these mechanisms may regulate efferocytosis and could also become viable theranostic targets. Although efferocytosis has been studied in postinfarct cardiomyopathy, 71 we do not yet know its role in other vascular diseases such as restenosis, pathological angiogenesis, or aneurysms. Given the simultaneous link to atherosclerosis, acute inflammation and clearance of apoptotic cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, proefferocytic therapies should be considered as a potential therapy for the early window after an acute coronary syndrome.

**CONCLUSIONS**

Although the preceding 50 years have been marked by major improvements in survival from cardiovascular disease, many of these trends have begun to plateau or

even worsen in recent years. 100 Some of these changes may be related to increases in obesity-related conditions such as diabetes mellitus, but others are likely caused by the diminishing returns being achieved with the addition of new drugs that target risk factors for which effective therapies already exist. The recent discovery that efferocytosis is impaired in vascular disease represents a major advance in our understanding of the root cause of atherosclerosis and why necrotic debris accumulates over time. The advent of proefferocytic therapies that allow for the removal of diseased and apoptotic cells could allow for an entirely new platform of treatment that specifically targets the necrotic core should these agents prove to be specific and safe in ongoing oncology trials.
