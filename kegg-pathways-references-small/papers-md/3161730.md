The physiological relevance of the ability of β-N-acetyllhexosaminidase A to liberate N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate from polymeric keratan sulfate was investigated. Upon intravenous injection into rats of [³⁵S]sulfate-labeled proteokeratan sulfate up to 25% of the radioactivity excreted with the urine were identified as N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate. Within 24 h, however, excretion of inorganic sulfate rose at the expense of the sulfated monosaccharide. Upon incubation *in vitro* of liver lysosomes from rats treated with proteokeratan sulfate, inorganic sulfate and minor amounts of sulfated monosaccharide were found in the incubation fluid. Cultured rat peritoneal macrophages ingested proteokeratan sulfate with a clearance rate of 6–9 μg × h⁻¹ × mg cell protein⁻¹ and degraded it rapidly. Inorganic sulfate but not N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate was delivered to the culture medium. During a chase period the amount of intracellular N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate fell, and a corresponding amount of sulfate could be found extracellularly. Significant amount of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate were only found in the culture medium when the cells were challenged with zymosan. These results suggest that N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate is a physiological intermediate during the degradation of keratan sulfate, but is usually hydrolyzed intralysosomally by N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase. Genetic deficiency of the sulfatase in humans therefore results in excessive excretion of the sulfated amino sugar but not of keratan sulfate.

Intralysosomal degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans is considered to be accomplished by endoglycosidases and by specific sulfatases and glycosidases acting sequentially on the non-reducing terminus of the polysaccharide chain inorganic sulfate and the constituent monosaccharides being the final degradation products (see [1] for review). As we have shown previously, keratan sulfate could represent an exception from this general pathway of glycosaminoglycan degradation. *In vitro* incubation of keratan-sulfate-derived oligosaccharides [2] and of polymeric keratan sulfate [3] with isoenzyme A of β-N-acetyllhexosaminidase resulted in the liberation of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate, thereby bypassing the action of an N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase at the oligomeric and polymeric level. It remained unknown whether this unusual pathway could operate *in vivo*, and if so what the metabolic fate of the sulfated monosaccharide would be. In contrast to N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase [4] N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase exhibits activity *in vitro* towards the sulfated monosaccharide [5]. The latter sulfatase, however, releases sulfate from keratan sulfate oligosaccharides only under the condition of complete inhibition of β-N-acetyllhexosaminidase A [6]. Even in Sandhoff fibroblasts which are deficient in β-N-acetyllhexosaminidase A and B [7], the residual enzyme activity was sufficient to exceed the activity of the normal sulfatase [2].

To get insight into the degradation *in vivo* of the N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate moiety of keratan sulfate we have prepared [³⁵S]sulfate-labeled proteokeratan sulfate and followed its degradation after intravenous administration into rats or after endocytosis by cultured macrophages.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

Na₂³⁵SO₄ (carrier-free) was purchased from Amersham-Buchler (Braunschweig, FRG) and zymosan from Sigma (Munich, FRG).

[³⁵S]Sulfate-labeled proteokeratan sulfate was obtained after incubation *in vitro* of bovine corneae exactly as described [8]. Its specific radioactivity was 0.046 μCi/μmol galactose. It had the following composition: hexosamine, 1.43 μmol/mg; galactose, 1.32 μmol/mg; sulfate, 1.44 μmol/kg. The glucuronic acid content, uncorrected for the interference by neutral sugars, was 0.05 μmol/ μmol galactose. A second proteokeratin sulfate preparation had a specific radioactivity of 0.051 μCi/μmol galactose and was of similar composition. N-Acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate was synthesized from the unsulfated compound as described [2].

### Metabolic fate of intravenously injected proteokeratan sulfate

Proteokeratan sulfate was administered intravenously to male Wistar rats (250–300 g) at a dose of 35 mg/kg body weight. Urine was collected continuously. The animals were killed at intervals ranging from 30 min to 24 h. Organs were rinsed with 0.15 M NaCl, blotted dry, minced, suspended in 4 vol. of 2 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mM NaCl and 3 mM NaN₃ and homogenized with an

Enzymes. N-Acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.14); N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.4); β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52); β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23).

Ultraturrax homogenizer (Janke und Kunkel, Freiburg, FRG). Aliquots of the homogenates were used for protein, hemoglobin, and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase determinations. Another aliquot was mixed with an equal volume of 5 M NaOH and heated before radioactivity determination.

### Intralysosomal degradation of proteokeratan sulfate

Crude liver lysosomes were prepared 30 min after intravenous injection of proteokeratan sulfate as described above. Tissue slices were suspended in 4 vol. of ice-cold 0.25 M saccharose and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer by 10 up-and-down strokes at 1500 rev./min. The homogenate was spun for 10 min at 1000 × g. A crude lysosomal preparation was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant for 20 min at 10000 × g. The pellet was suspended in 2 ml/g tissue of 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 M saccharose, 0.5 mM ATP, and 5 mM MgCl₂ [9]. An aliquot was incubated for up to 2 h at 37°C; a second aliquot was centrifuged as above. Supernatant and pellet were frozen separately.

At the end of the incubation lysosomes were pelleted as above. Lysosomes from 1 g of tissue were suspended in 1 ml of water, frozen and thawed 10 times and subjected to ultrasonication by applying four bursts of 25 W with a microtip-equipped apparatus. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation for 30 min at 20000 × g was used for further analyses. \[^{35}S\]Sulfate and N-acetylglucosamine 6-\[^{35}S\]sulfate were separated from \[^{35}S\]sulfate-labeled keratan sulfate by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose [2]. The former substances were desorbed with 0.3 M pyridine/acetic acid, pH 5.0, the polymer with 3 mM NaCl. Keratan-sulfate-containing fractions were dialyzed against water and lyophilized. \[^{35}S\]-Sulfate and N-acetylglucosamine 6-\[^{35}S\]sulfate were separated from each other by descending paper chromatography in butan-1-ol, acetic acid, 1 M NH₃ (2:3:1, by vol.) as described [3].

### Endocytosis of proteokeratan sulfate by macrophages

Macrophages were obtained by washing the peritoneal cavity of a rat with 15 ml 0.15 M NaCl. Cells from one animal were transferred after centrifugation to a 25-cm² Falcon plastic flask and fed with 5 ml Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium (as formulated in the catalogue of Gibco) containing 10% human serum. Cultures were used for endocytosis experiments after 7–9 days when the cells exhibited the typical appearance of macrophages. Cultures received 0.5 mg \[^{35}S\]sulfate-labeled proteokeratan sulfate in 2 ml of serum-free medium. After 24 h of incubation, medium was removed, the cell layer was washed three times with 5 ml Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution, and incubation continued for 4 h with serum-free medium or with medium containing 10% human serum and 10 μg zymosan/ml. At the end of the incubation cells were harvested by trypsinization. The cell pellet was homogenized in 200 μl of water by ultrasonication. Aliquots of medium and cell extract were mixed with 5 vol. of ethanol. After 4 h at room temperature ethanol-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was dried under reduced pressure and dissolved in water. The high salt concentration in the medium samples prevented the separation of \[^{35}S\]sulfate and N-acetylglucosamine 6-\[^{35}S\]sulfate by paper chromatography. Instead, separation was achieved on 1.5-ml Dowex 1X2 (200–400 mesh) columns prepared in Pasteur pipets. After sample application the columns were eluted stepwise with 4.5 ml each of water, 0.3 M, 0.4 M, and 2.0 M NaCl. Sulfate was found in the 0.3-M NaCl fractions, whereas the sulfated monosaccharide was desorbed with 0.4 M NaCl. Keratan sulfate was eluted with 2.0 M NaCl.

#### Quantification of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate excreted with the urine

15 ml of urine from a patient with N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase deficiency (patient 1, [10]) and from two healthy children of the same sex and similar age were lyophilized, dissolved in 1.5 ml of 0.3 M pyridine/acetic acid, pH 5.5, and chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G-50 fine (2 × 140 cm) equilibrated and eluted with the same buffer. Fractions exhibiting the elution volume of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate were pooled, lyophilized, and rechromatographed on a Sephadex G-10 column (3 × 41 cm) in 0.3 M pyridine/acetic acid, pH 5.5, to remove remaining salt. Appropriate fractions were again lyophilized, dissolved in water, and analyzed by the Morgan-Elson reaction. N-Acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate was separated from the unsulfated compound on Dowex 1X2 as described in the preceding paragraph.

#### Analytical methods

N-Acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate and N-acetylglucosamine [11], hexosamine [12], sulfate [13], uronic acids [14], galactose [15], protein [16], and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity [17], were measured as described. Radioactivity was determined in a Beckman LS 9000 liquid scintillation spectrometer using Instagel (Packard) as scintillation fluid.

### RESULTS

#### Degradation of proteokeratan \[^{35}S\]/sulfate in vivo

\[^{35}S\]-Sulfate-labeled proteokeratan sulfate was intravenously administered to a rat, and the urine was monitored for excretion of radioactivity (Fig. 1). A semilogarithmic plot of radioactivity in the body (difference between applied dose and radioactivity in the urine) versus time fits a straight line in-

indicating that the disappearance of radioactivity followed first-order kinetics for the first 24 h. A more detailed analysis of the excretion products (Fig. 2) revealed the following. Macromolecular keratan sulfate was the predominant excretion product within the first 45 min after sample application, but its relative amount became drastically reduced within the next few hours. No attempt was made to determine whether or not the excreted keratan sulfate was partially degraded. The time-dependent decrease in the excretion of keratan

sulfate was mirrored by a corresponding increase in the excretion of inorganic \({ }^{[35} S]\) sulfate. \(N\)-Acetylglycosamine 6-\({ }^{[35} S]\)-sulfate accounted for 25% of the excreted radioactivity shortly after proteokeratan sulfate application, thereafter its relative amount decreased. No sulfated monosaccharide was found in the last 6-h portion of the urine. These results suggest that intravenously administered proteokeratan sulfate can be degraded enzymatically yielding ultrafiltrable \(N\)-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate as an intermediate or an end product. However, the amount of sulfated amino sugar exceeded that of inorganic sulfate only during the first 45 min.

### Intralysosomal degradation of proteokeratan \({ }^{[35} S]\) sulfate

The liver appeared to be the main organ involved in the metabolism of intravenously injected proteokeratan sulfate. After administration of the radioactively labeled proteoglycan several organs were analyzed for the radioactivity taken up. Corrections were made for the radioactivity present in blood by determining the hemoglobin concentration in the homogenates and subtracting the radioactivity being present in the calculated amount of blood. It is shown in Table 1 that 30 min after intravenous administration of proteokeratan \({ }^{[35} S]\) sulfate the liver contains the highest total amount of radioactivity per gram of tissue among the organs analysed. 1 h, 2 h or 4 h after injection the absolute radioactivity per gram of tissue was less than after 30 min (result not shown). A crude lysosomal pellet was therefore prepared from the liver 30 min after application of the proteoglycan to investigate whether or not \(N\)-acetylglycosamine 6-sulfate is formed intralysosomally and is able to cross the lysosomal membrane.

During a 2 h period of incubation of crude liver lysosomes approximately one third of the keratan sulfate became degraded. Inorganic sulfate was the main degradation product transported to the incubation fluid (Table 2). There was a small increase in the total amount of \(N\)-acetylglycosamine 6-sulfate during the incubation period. In contrast to inorganic sulfate, the sulfated monosaccharide remained predominantly particle-associated.

### Uptake and degradation of proteokeratan \({ }^{[35} S]\) sulfate by cultured macrophages

Macrophages are known to release the content of the lysosomes under appropriate stimuli [17]. It seemed therefore possible that macrophages contribute significantly to the degradation of intravenously injected proteokeratan sulfate and provide a source of urinary \(N\)-acetylglycosamine 6-sulfate.

exhibit an abnormal metabolism of the sulfated amino sugar. In accordance with this assumption, crude urine from a patient with Sanfilippo disease type D contained approximately three times the amount of Morgan-Elson-positive material than the urine of healthy individuals (Table 4). Urine did not contain substances inhibitory for the chemical reaction. Upon purification by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography the excessive excretion of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate by the Sanfilippo D patient was verified. Sulfated amino sugars could not be detected in the urine of control persons.

DISCUSSION

It had been shown previously that N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate can be released from keratan sulfate *in vitro* upon incubation with β-N-acetyhexosaminidase A [2, 3]. The present paper demonstrates that this unusual enzyme activity can also be observed *in vivo* and in intact cells and organelles. N-Acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate was excreted with the urine after intravenous administration of proteokeratan sulfate. Furthermore, it was liberated during incubation *in vitro* of crude liver lysosomes preloaded with the polymer and it was a degradation product of endocytosed proteokeratan sulfate.

It is suggested that the formation of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate took place intralysosomally after endocytosis of the intravenously injected proteoglycan. Even shortly after sample application inorganic sulfate was released from the radioactively labeled polymer. However, the activities of keratan-sulfate-degrading sulfatases in serum is below the limit of detection, and incubation of proteokeratan \[^{35}S\]sulfate with serum did not result in the liberation of inorganic \[^{35}S\]sulfate (unpublished observation).

Keratan sulfate from bovine cornea which was used throughout this study has approximately 65% of its sulfate groups attached to the C-6 atom of N-acetylglucosamine; 35% are linked to the C-6 atom of galactose [20, 21]. As galactose-6-sulfate sulfatase exhibits only exo-sulfatase activity [3] one would expect a radioactivity ratio for N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate and inorganic sulfate of approximately 2:1 if the sulfated monosaccharide was not further hydrolysed. Such a ratio has been found only in the urine produced immediately after proteokeratan \[^{35}S\]sulfate administration. Thereafter the amount of inorganic sulfate exceeded that of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate. Formation of inorganic sulfate at the expense of the amount of the sulfated

Urinary excretion of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate in a patient with N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase deficiency

The results described in the preceding sections suggest that N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate may be a physiological intermediate of keratan sulfate degradation which is then further converted to the amino sugar and inorganic sulfate. Patients with Sanfilippo disease type D who are deficient in N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate sulfatase [19] should therefore

Pathway A (upper panel): (1) $N$-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate sulfatase (galactose-6-sulfate sulfatase); (2, 5) $\beta$-galactosidase; (3, 6) $N$-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase; (4, 7) $\beta-N$-acetylhexosaminidase. Pathway B (lower panel): (1) $N$-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (galactose-6-sulfate sulfatase) (2, 4) $\beta$-galactosidase; (3, 5) $\beta-N$-acetylhexosaminidase A

monosaccharide was found in macrophages during the course of keratan sulfate degradation. It therefore has to be concluded that the sulfated amino sugar is an appropriate substrate of lysosomal $N$-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase under conditions *in vivo*.

The cellular origin of the fairly high amounts of $N$-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate excreted with the urine of rats loaded with a high dose of proteokeratan sulfate and with the urine of an Sanfilippo D patient is ambiguous at present. Macrophages released $N$-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate only when appropriately stimulated. An increased rate of reverse endocytosis has been described in fibroblasts from patients with lysosomal storage disorders [22]. From crude liver lysosomes small amounts of the sulfated monosaccharide seemed to be able to escape the lysosomal compartment. Whether or not a transport mechanism through the plasma membrane exists remains to be determined.

From our results and those of Hopwood and Elliott [6] one can conclude that alternate pathways exist for the degradation of polymer-bound $N$-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate moieties present in keratan sulfate. The amino sugar could be desulfated at the polymeric level. $N$-acetylglucosamine would then be preferentially hydrolyzed by $\beta-N$-acetylhexosaminidase B [23]. Alternatively, $\beta-N$-acetylhexosaminidase A first liberates the sulfated monosaccharide before the action of the $N$-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase is required (Fig. 3). The contribution of both pathways could not be studied in detail because the low specific radioactivity of the proteokeratin sulfate prevented the performance of short-term experiments. The study on the time-dependent urinary excretion of sulfate and $N$-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate would suggest that the latter pathway is of greater importance. Sanfilippo D patients who have a mutant $N$-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase exhibit a faulty heparan sulfate degradation at the polymeric level [19] but also an abnormal keratan sulfate degradation at the monomeric level. Though they do not excrete excessive amounts of keratan sulfate [10], excessive amounts of $N$-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate have been found in the urine. This observation could possibly allow a genotype-specific diagnosis to be made without the determination of the activity of the deficient sulfatase.
