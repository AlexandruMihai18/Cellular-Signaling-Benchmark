## Summary

Benzoxazinoids are major compounds involved in chemical defence in grasses. These toxins are stored in the vacuole as glucosides. Two glucosyltransferases, BX8 and BX9, that catalyse this last step of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis have been isolated via functional cloning. No close relative of these maize genes was found among the known glucosyltransferases. The enzymes display a very high degree of substrate specificity. DIMBOA, the major benzoxazinoid in young maize, is the preferred substrate. Both genes are highly expressed in young maize seedlings, the developmental stage with the highest activity of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis. Bx8 is included in the cluster of DIMBOA biosynthesis genes located on the short arm of chromosome 4. Hence, the gene cluster comprises three different enzymatic functions and a complete set of genes for the biosynthesis of DIBOA glucoside. Bx9 mapped to chromosome 1. Expression of Bx8 and Bx9 in Arabidopsis corroborated the potency of the enzymes in detoxification of their substrates. This capacity might have implications for allelopathic interactions.

Keywords: glucosyltransferase, secondary metabolites, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, allelopathy, maize genes.

## Introduction

Benzoxazinoid acetal D-glucosides are abundant secondary metabolites found mainly in Gramineae, including the major agricultural crops maize, wheat and rye. While DIBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one) is predominant in rye, its 7-methoxyl derivative DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one) is the main benzoxazinoid in maize and wheat. The biosynthesis of the aglycone DIBOA has been elucidated in maize (Frey *et al.*, 1997). The last step of the biosynthetic pathway is the addition of a glucose moiety at the 2-position of DIBOA or DIMBOA. Glucosylation reduces the autotoxicity of benzoxazinoids as the glucosides have reduced chemical reactivity (Sicker *et al.*, 2000), and is possibly required for vacuolar transport. The benzoxazinoid glucosides are stored in the vacuole as inactive phytoanticipines (Osbourn, 1996) and the specific glucosidase is deposited in the maize chloroplast (Cicek and Esen, 1998). When pathogen or herbivore attack destroys the integrity of the cell organelles, glucoside and glucosidase are combined and the toxic aglycone is produced. In maize, the enzymatic release of DIMBOA after wounding is completed within 30 min. Due to their multi-functional phytotoxicity, the benzoxazinoid aglycones released following wounding are important factors in the general defence against microbial diseases and insects. Furthermore, it has been shown that benzoxazinoids are involved in allelopathic interactions (Barnes and Putnam, 1987; Sicker *et al.*, 2000). Cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates (Kahn *et al.*, 1997; Reay and Conn, 1974), volatile terpenoids and phenolics (Crouzet and Chassagne, 1999) are stabilized by glycosylation, and again glycosidases are employed to release the aglycone after cell damage. Glycosylation prior to transport to the vacuole is known to occur for anthocyanins (Hoshino and Tamura, 1994). Hence, glycosylation is an essential modification for a wide variety of secondary plant metabolites. However, most molecular information on glycosyltransferases is derived from anthocyanin biosynthesis. Glucosyltransferase activities of the benzoxazinoid pathway of maize (Bailey and Larson, 1989), rye, wheat and a wild barley species (Leighton *et al.*, 1994; Sue *et al.*, 2000) have been described only for crude extracts or partially purified enzymes. We have isolated via functional

cloning two glucosyltransferases of maize, BX8 and BX9. These enzymes exhibit an unique substrate specificity. BX8 and BX9 display 89% similarity to each other at the amino acid level but have no close relationship to any other known glucosyltransferase. Elevated tolerance against the allelopathic compounds DIBOA and DIMBOA is seen in Arabidopsis plants that express Bx8 and Bx9 as transgenes.

Results

Isolation of the glucosyltransferases BX8 and BX9

Two enzymatic activities that are capable of catalysing the addition of a glucose moiety at the 2-position of DIMBOA were identified by Bailey and Larson (1989). As a starting point for the isolation of these glucosyltransferases, the two initial purification steps were performed as described

![Figure 2](https://i.imgur.com/figure_2.png)

Figure 2 Genomic location and gene structure of Bx8 and Bx9.

Six genes of the DIMBOA biosynthetic pathway map within 6 cM on the short arm of chromosome 4. Bx8 is positioned in close proximity (< 1 cM) to Bx1 and Bx2. The relative position with respect to Bx1 and Bx2 is unknown. Bx9 maps to the short arm of chromosome 1. The two glucosyltransferase genes have a similar gene structure with one small intron at an equivalent position.

previously (Bailey and Larson, 1989). Two separate activity peaks were detected by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The enzyme activity recovered at 440 mM (NH4)₂SO₄ accepted DIMBOA and DIBOA equally well as substrates, whereas the second enzyme activity, eluting at 580 mM (NH4)₂SO₄, converted DIMBOA more actively to the respective glucoside than it did DIBOA. The enzyme activities of the first and second peak were termed BX8 and BX9, respectively, because these conversions represent the last steps in the benzoxazinoid biosynthesis pathway (Figure 1). BX9 enzyme activity was recovered in two sub-peaks, Bx9a and BX9b, by anion exchange chromatography. The fractions were indistinguishable with respect to enzyme parameters. BX8 enzyme activity was eluted in one peak. All three fractions were further purified by affinity chromatography with the dye Cibacron Blue 3GA. Enzyme activity was recovered using the substrate UDPG (uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose). This step yielded purification of about 50-fold. A second round of anion exchange chromatography was performed as a polishing step. This caused BX8 activity to split into two activity peaks, BX8a and BX8b. As in the case of BX9a/BX9b, both fractions had the same enzymatic characteristics. An overall enrichment of enzyme activity of 380-fold was achieved. On a Coomassie-stained gel, a major band of about 48 kDa was identified that coincided with the glucosidase activities. The BX8b and BX9a proteins were excised from the gel and subjected to peptide sequencing (Eckerskorn and Lottspeich, 1989). Degenerate primer sequences were derived from the peptide sequence data and used for PCR amplification in a maize seedling cDNA library (Frey et al., 1995). One primer combination based on BX8 peptide sequence information resulted in the amplification of a 539 bp DNA fragment that proved to be part of a plant glucosyltransferase gene, according to BLAST analysis. The PCR fragment was used as a probe for screening of the seedling cDNA library. Two different types of cDNA sequences were identified and sequencing revealed that

nd, not detectable. Enzyme assays were performed as described in Experimental procedures

These cDNAs encode the purified glucosyltransferase enzymes as the peptide sequences obtained from the isolated proteins fit the deduced amino acid sequences. A RACE experiment was performed to verify the isolation of full-size cDNAs. The resulting cDNAs encoded 459 amino acids for Bx8 and 464 amino acids for Bx9, values that are in good agreement with the protein gel analysis of the purified enzymes. Southern analysis did not reveal other maize genes with high homology to Bx8 or Bx9.

The genes have one small intron at a conserved position (Figure 2). Mapping data locate Bx8 in close proximity to Bx1 and Bx2 on the short arm of chromosome 4. No recombination event between these genes was observed in the recombinant inbred mapping population (Burr and Burr, 1991). The exact position of Bx8 relative to Bx1 and Bx2 is not known. Bx9 maps to chromosome 1S 144.

Enzymatic properties of recombinant BX8 and BX9

Both cDNAs were expressed in E. coli, purified and the steady-state kinetic constants determined for the substrates DIBOA, DIMBOA and UDPG (Table 1). The recombinant proteins showed the same substrate specificity as the purified enzymes from the maize seedlings. While BX8 exhibited about the same $k_{\mathrm{cat}} / K_{\mathrm{m}}$ value for all three substrates, BX9 had a higher $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ value for DIBOA. Both enzymes glucosylated HBOA (2-hydroxy-2H-1, 4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one), the intermediate of the DIMBOA biosynthetic pathway, with low efficiency (Table 2). The benzoxazinoid

HMBOA (2-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1, 4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one) is accepted by BX9 and to some extent by BX8. Neither enzyme accepted indole acetic acid or quercitin as substrate.

Gene expression pattern of the Bx8 and Bx9 genes

It has been shown (Frey et al., 1995) that the genes Bx2-Bx5 for DIMBOA biosynthesis display a transient, seedling-specific expression pattern. The highest steady-state RNA levels were observed in shoot tissue 3-7 days after imbibition. The same pattern was observed for the first gene of DIMBOA biosynthesis, Bx1 (Figure 3a). Bx8 and Bx9 transcript levels were highest in young seedlings up to 4 days after imbibition. In contrast to the other Bx genes, neither Bx8 nor Bx9 showed preferred expression in the shoot. This difference in root and shoot steady-state mRNA values was reflected at the protein level. As the antibodies against BX8 and BX9 cross-react, the two proteins could not be discriminated. Western analysis (Figure 3b) demonstrated that the glucosyltransferases were present in similar amounts in root and shoot tissue. In contrast, no BX1 protein was detectable in the root of older seedlings (after day 4). The observed decrease in transcript levels in older seedlings was not mirrored by a decrease at the protein level.

Bx8 and Bx9 have no close relative among the known plant glucosyltransferase genes

The cDNAs of Bx8 and Bx9 are 88% homologous and the encoded proteins share 78% identity and 89% similarity. Both proteins display the PSPG box consensus sequence of plant glucosyltransferases involved in secondary metabolism (Hughes and Hughes, 1994). Within the PSPG box, the benzoxazinoid glucosyltransferases were 89% identical. In BX9, an asparagine is found instead of a conserved cysteine at position 20 of the PSPG box. BX8 and BX9 have highest homology to a putative Arabidopsis thaliana glucosyltransferase (AC073395) with unknown function, displaying 61 and 60% similarity and 34 and 33% identity, respectively. In the phylogenetic dendrogram (Figure 4), the two maize enzymes constitute a branch of

concentrations of 0.1–2.0 mM to wild-type and homozygous transgenic plants. After 4 days of incubation, the Bx8 and Bx9 transgenics were green and well-developed at all concentrations. Only a minor reduction of the root system and insignificant browning of the leaf tissue was observed at 2.0 mM benzoxazinoid concentration compared with the untreated control. In contrast, reduced growth and browning or bleaching of tissue were observed for wild-type Arabidopsis at a benzoxazinoid concentration of 0.5 mM. Concentrations of 2.0 mM were lethal for the wild-type plantlets. These results demonstrate that exogenously applied DIBOA and DIMBOA can be taken up by plants and exert toxic effects. Glucosylation of the benzoxazinoids catalysed by BX8 and BX9 was sufficient to reduce the deleterious effects of the aglycone and to confer tolerance on the transgenic plants. Although BX9 has a \(K_m\) value for DIBOA that is about 20 times higher than that for DIMBOA, both benzoxazinoids are tolerated equally well by transgenics carrying the Bx9 gene. Hence, in this context, BX9 enzyme function is sufficient to overcome both DIBOA and DIMBOA phytotoxicity.

**Discussion**

Glucosyltransferases constitute a large gene family in plants. A conserved stretch of about 40 amino acids named the PDGP motif was identified as the characteristic signature of plant glucosyltransferases (Hughes and Hughes, 1994). It has been postulated that this motif is involved in nucleotide-diphosphate-sugar binding (Vogt and Jones, 2000). A BLAST search of the complete *Arabidopsis* genome for this motif yielded 56 putative members of the glucosyltransferase gene family. Sequence-based identification and isolation of putative glucosyltransferases have been reported; for example, the PDGP motif has been used recently in a PCR approach to isolate sinapate glucosyltransferases from *Brassica napus* (Milkowski *et al.*, 2000a). However, it has also been shown that assignment of glucosyltransferase enzyme functions based on sequence similarity can be misleading (Milkowski *et al.*, 2000b). Unequivocal assignment of enzyme function to a given protein sequence therefore requires enzymatic testing. For this reason, the number of glucosyltransferase genes with known sequence and proven *in vivo* function is still limited.

**BX8 and BX9 expression in transgenic plants reduces the phytotoxicity of DIBOA and DIMBOA**

Transgenic *Arabidopsis* plants expressing Bx8 and Bx9 were generated and the glucosyltransferase activity was assayed in crude extracts from these plants. All individual transformants tested (nine for Bx8 and three for Bx9), but not the wild-type control plants, had DIMBOA glucosyltransferase activity (data not shown). Single-copy T-DNA integration transformants were identified by Southern analysis and homozygous progeny plants were isolated for single-copy Bx8 and Bx9 transformants. These homozygous plants were tested for tolerance to DIMBOA and DIBOA (Figure 5). The benzoxazinoids were applied at

**Purification of the glucosyltransferases BX8 and BX9**

Enzyme activity-based cloning led to the isolation of two maize glucosyltransferases, BX8 and BX9. The most powerful step in the purification scheme proved to be affinity chromatography on a dye column (Cibacron Blue 3GA™) that probably mimics the substrate UDP-glucose. The potency of dye columns has been shown in isolation

Glucosyltransferases of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis 637

BX8 and BX9 constitute a distinct branch in the phylogenetic dendrogram (Figure 4). This indicates that Bx8 and Bx9 have evolved independently from cluster I, II and III enzymes. DIMBOA, the end-product of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in maize, is the preferred substrate for both enzymes (Table 2). In comparison, DIBOA is converted about half as efficiently by BX8 and at a significantly lower rate by BX9. The enzymatic constants of BX8 for DIBOA and DIMBOA correspond well with the glucosyltransferase activities in extracts from rye (*Secale cereale*) and *Hordeum lechleri*, a wild variety of barley. Interestingly, DIMBOA is efficiently converted by these enzymes although these species contain only DIBOA (Leighton et al., 1994). Therefore, BX8 might represent the original benzoxazinoid glucosyltransferase function in the Gramineae. In contrast, BX9, which clearly discriminates between DIMBOA and DIBOA, could have evolved more recently in maize. It will be interesting to compare the glucosyltransferases of the two DIMBOA-producing Gramineae, maize and wheat. Two glucosyltransferase activities have been characterized in wheat (Sue et al., 2000), but the sequences are not yet available. Both wheat enzyme activities showed similar substrate specificity, and it has yet to be determined whether they represent modifications of the same enzyme.

Glucosylation of HBOA, an intermediate of the benzoxazinoid biosynthesis (Figure 1), by BX8 and BX9 is negligible. Its 7-methoxy derivative, HMBOA, however, is glucosylated by BX9 with moderate efficiency (Table 2). The presence of a 7-methoxy-group seems to be a critical feature in substrate recognition by BX9. HMBOA is present only in trace amounts in maize, therefore its glucosylation might have no relevance *in vivo*. BX8 and BX9 display about the same degree of homology to each other as the anthocyanin-specific glucosyltransferases BZ1 of maize (Fedoroff et al., 1984) and barley (Wise et al., 1990) do to each other. It is not clear which part in the enzyme structure of BX8 and BX9 causes the observed difference in their substrate specificity. However, the data on BX8 and BX9 demonstrate that the notion that glucosyltransferases of secondary metabolism are quite unspecific regio-specific or regio-selective enzymes can not be generalized.

**Gene structure and chromosomal location of Bx8 and Bx9**

Limited information is available about the structure of glucosyltransferase genes and their location in the genome. Data are now available for the maize glucosyltransferases Bx8, Bx9 and Bz1. All three possess a single small intron at a similar position. The results for Bx8 and Bx9 show that glucosyltransferase genes with comparable functions are not necessarily found in tandem although data from the Arabidopsis genome analysis (Arabidopsis

**Figure 5 Reduction of phytotoxicity of benzoxazinoids by Bx8 and BX9 expression.**

Seedlings of Arabidopsis lines homozygous for the transgenes 35S::Bx8 or 35S::Bx9 and wild-type Arabidopsis were grown in different concentrations of DIMBOA and DIBOA for 4 days. Stunting and bleaching of the wild-type plantlets were obvious at concentrations of 0.5 mM and higher, while the transgenics expressing the glucosyltransferases BX8 and BX9 were unaffected at concentrations below 2.0 mM and only slightly affected at 2.0 mM concentration. Wild-type plants were completely bleached or necrotic at this concentration of benzoxazinoids.

Genome Initiative, 2000) revealed such arrangements. Interestingly, Bx8 is intimately linked to the cluster of benzoxazinone biosynthetic genes. If Bx8 represents the ancestral version of benzoxazinoid glucosyltransferase in maize, as can be speculated based on its enzymatic properties (see above), it is possible that the formation of a 'biosynthetic cluster' (Figure 2) represented by the genes Bx1–Bx5 and Bx8 is an ancient feature. This kind of organization is unusual for plants but is often found for secondary metabolic genes of fungi, especially for the biosynthesis of toxins. Characteristically, a detoxification gene is included in the cluster (e.g. Bechthold *et al.*, 1995). In the case of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, this gene function is fulfilled by the glucosyltransferase Bx8. As the Bx genes are all located within a 6 cM region, the Bx

cluster will frequently be transferred as a functional unit to the next generation. It is presently unclear whether this genetic co-segregation of all genes required for benzoxazinoid glucoside biosynthesis is of any advantage for maize.

**Implications of glucosyltransferase expression on allelopathy of benzoxazinones**

Allelopathy and defence are closely related functions of phytotoxins. The allelopathic potential of the defence compounds DIBOA and DIMBOA has been studied in various plant–plant interactions (Sicker *et al.*, 2000). The release of these benzoxazinoids into the environment via root exudation was demonstrated for rye (Perez and Ormeno-

Nunez, 1993) and the weed *Agropyron repens*, another member of the grass family (Friebe *et al.*, 1995). Benzoxazinoids were identified as first-order reaction allelochemicals (Barnes and Putnam, 1987) that drastically reduce the biomass of dicot weeds (Putnam and De Frank, 1983).

Arabidopsis plants were used to assay this interaction and to mimic the effect of glucosyltransferase activity on exogenously applied DIMBOA and DIBOA. The results (Figure 5) demonstrate both the allelopathic capacity of DIBOA and DIMBOA and the potency of BX8 and BX9 in reducing the phytotoxicity of these chemicals. The presence of benzoxazinoids reduces the growth of wild-type Arabidopsis at concentrations that had proven to be effective in natural plant communities (0.1 mM) (Sicker *et al.*, 2000). Almost no toxic effect is seen with the transgenic plants expressing *Bx8* and *Bx9* driven by the constitutive 35S CaMV promoter. Hence, glucosylation is sufficient to detoxify DIBOA and DIMBOA to a level that is tolerable for the plant. It is not known whether the benzoxazinoid glucosides are then stored in Arabidopsis vacuoles, or whether an unidentified degradation mechanism exists. The findings demonstrate that no glucosyltransferase activity is present in wild-type Arabidopsis that is able to glucosylate DIBOA or DIMBOA efficiently enough to reduce their phytotoxicity.

The DIBOA biosynthetic genes *Bx1–Bx5* and their gene products are expressed at a higher level in the shoot than in the root (Figure 3 and Frey *et al.*, 1995). In contrast, expression of *Bx8* and *Bx9* is similar in both tissues. As a result, there is a relative excess of glucosyltransferase activity in root tissue. Perhaps this indicates that *Bx8* and *Bx9* serve a second function in roots in addition to the detoxification of endogenously produced benzoxazinoids; for example, they might be required for glucosylation of exogenous DIBOA and DIMBOA that is delivered through exudates of neighbouring plants.

In nature, not only DIBOA and DIMBOA but also the decomposition products MBOA and benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one act as allelochemicals. It is well documented that detoxification of these compounds also occurs via glucosylation. In this case, N-glucosides or 6-O-glucosides are produced. The relevant glucosyltransferase activities have been found in benzoxazinoid-producing grasses and in weeds of their community (Schulz and Wieland, 1999).

### Experimental procedures

#### Materials and molecular biology methods
All chemicals used were pro analysis or HPLC grade. Plasmid Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene) was used as a cloning vector. Sequences were isolated from libraries described by Frey *et al.* (1995). The genomic sequence of *Bx8* was isolated from the TAMU Bac library of Maize line B73, *Bam*HI-digested DNA cloned in the Belo Bac 11 vector (Santos *et al.*, unpublished data). Sequencing was by primer walking on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer. The 5′ end of the transcripts was determined using the 5′–3′ RACE kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DMSO at a final concentration of 5% was included in the first-strand cDNA transcription mix.

#### Plant material
Protein purification was performed with the hybrid maize line LG11 (Limagrain, Chappes, France). Whole seedlings were utilized for protein preparation. For all *Arabidopsis thaliana* experiments, the ecotype Columbia was used.

#### Mapping
Data were generated by Southern analysis, using the 5′ end of the cDNA of *Bx8* and the complete cDNA of *Bx9* as a probe. A unique RFLP was revealed for the CM37xT232 recombinant inbred mapping population.

#### Purification of standards
DIMBOA was isolated as described previously (Hartenstein *et al.*, 1992). DIMBOA-glucoside was isolated from etiolated maize seedlings and DIBOA and HBOA were isolated from etiolated rye seedlings (Bailey and Larson, 1989); these were further purified by HPLC using a Merck LiChroCART RP-18 column (10 × 250 mm). For elution, 9% HOAc and 10% methanol in H₂O (v/v) was used. DIBOA-glucoside was isolated from etiolated rye seedlings that were crushed in liquid nitrogen and acetone added. The extract was filtered using filter paper vacuum-dried and extracted five times with *n*-butanol. The butanol fractions were pooled and vacuum-dried. The dry pellet was resuspended in methanol and separated on HPLC.

#### Enzyme assays
Glucosylation of DIMBOA, DIBOA, HMBOA and HBOA was assayed as described previously (Bailey and Larson, 1989; Folch *et al.*, 1957). Michaelis–Menten constants (*K*ₘ) were determined from Lineweaver–Burk plots. UDPG was used as the glucose donor, with either DIBOA or DIMBOA as acceptor substrate. Acceptor substrate levels were determined with 2000 μM UDPG, and the concentration of the acceptor ranged from 50 to 1200 μM. For measurement of the *K*ₘ for UDPG, 700 μM DIMBOA was used and UDPG concentration varied from 50 to 1200 μM.

When the different benzoxazinoids were assayed (Table 2), a concentration of 500 μM for each tested aglycone was used. The quercitin glucosylation assay and indole-3-acetic acid glucosylation assay were as described previously (Gerats *et al.*, 1984; Jackson *et al.*, 2001).

#### Enzyme extraction and purification
All purification procedures were carried out at 4°C. The crude fraction and ammonium sulphate fraction were prepared as described previously (Bailey and Larson, 1989). The ammonium sulphate precipitate was re-suspended in buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 5 mM dithioerythritol). Four volumes of buffer B (1 M

NH₄SO₄ in buffer A) were added prior to hydrophobic interaction chromatography with butyl-Sepharose FF (XK 26 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, bed volume 50 ml, flow rate 60 ml h⁻¹) equilibrated in buffer B. After washing with buffer B, proteins were eluted with a gradient of 1–0 M NH₄SO₄ in buffer A (20 column volumes). The two enzyme activity peaks were separated and precipitated individually with ammonium sulphate. NAP-25™ columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A were used to desalt the re-dissolved pellets before anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q™ 6 ml column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, flow rate 40 ml h⁻¹) equilibrated in buffer A. Elution was with 0–500 mM KCl in buffer A in 20 column volumes. Three enzyme activity peaks, BX9a at 160 mM KCl, BX9b at 180 mM KCl and BX8 at 130 mM KCl, were recovered and individually concentrated and desalted as described above. For affinity chromatography, Cibacron Blue 3GA™ cross-linked onto 4% beaded agarose (Sigma, 1 × 5 cm column, flow rate 15–20 ml h⁻¹) was equilibrated in buffer A. The three enzyme activities were applied individually and recovered by elution with 15 ml of 30 mM UDP-glucose in buffer A. The enzyme activity peaks were directly applied to a MiniQ PE™ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A. Elution was with 20 column volumes of 0–500 mM KCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 30 ml h⁻¹. Four distinct enzyme activity peaks were isolated. BX8a and BX8b were eluted at 110 and 120 mM KCl, respectively. The enzymatic activities represent two pairs (BX8a, BX8b and BX9a, BX9b) with respect to substrate preferences. These peaks coincide with the major protein band of about 48 kDa after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The BX8b and BX9a enzyme activity peaks were used to isolate the protein for peptide sequencing.

### Determination of peptide sequences

The sample was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, and the 48 kDa band was excised. Cleavage in gel was performed essentially according to the method described by Eckerskorn and Lottspeich (1989). After extensive washing in water, the gel pieces were lyophilised and resoaked with buffer containing endoproteinase LysC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting peptide fragments were eluted with formic acid/acetone/trile/water (5/50/45). Peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Microcart 150-1 Purospher C18 5 μm column (Merck). Eluents in the HPLC were solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% trifluorooctanoic acid in acetonitrile). The gradient was developed from 0 to 60% B in 60 min at a flow rate of 60 μl min⁻¹. Eluted peptides were detected at 206 nm, collected manually and sequenced in an amino acid sequencer 492 A (PE-Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

### Transcript analysis

For the determination of transcript quantities by real-time PCR experiments, gene-specific primers were designed.

Defined quantities of the cloned cDNAs were used as standards for quantification on the LightCycler instrument with the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (Frey *et al.*, 2000). RNA was isolated with NucleoSpin RNA Plant (Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. The quality of the RNA was checked on denaturing agarose gels. Single-strand template cDNA was synthesized using 0.5 μg of RNA and the TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents kit (Perkin Elmer) by priming with random hexamers as described by the supplier. As an internal standard for RNA quantification, the GAP C gene transcript was used for normalization; a mean value of 0.06 ± 0.025 pg specific GAP C mRNA per 10 ng total RNA was determined. The PCR products were checked for homogeneity and absence of intron sequences by agarose gel electrophoresis.

### Western analysis

Etiolated seedlings were ground with 0.3 g g⁻¹ fresh weight Polyklar AT (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) under liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was transferred into extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins (50 μg total maize protein or 50 ng purified His-tagged BX8) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the recommendations of the supplier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunostaining, the rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for BX1 and BX8/BX9 were used. The blot was stained with anti-rabbit antibodies linked with Cy5 fluorescent dye (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fluorescent signal was analysed using a Storm 860 imager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified recombinant protein was used as reference.

### Generation and analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis plants

Arabidopsis plants were transformed as described previously (Clough and Bent, 1998). The binary vector pGPTV-BarB was used for cloning of 35S CaMV-cDNA fusions (Becker *et al.*, 1992) and electroporated into Agrobacterium GV3101 MP (Koncz and Schell, 1986). Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized, vernalized for 3 days at 4°C and then grown for 7 days at 18°C under a 24 h light period in Heraeus HPS 2000 plant chambers on ½ MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962). Individual plantlets were then transferred to liquid ½ MS medium, containing 0–2.0 mM of DIMBOA or DIBOA in microtitre plates. These plates were incubated on a shaker at 150 rpm at the same conditions as above. The medium was changed every 24 h as DIBOA and DIMBOA are unstable in aqueous solution and yield benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one and 6-methoxybenzoxazolin-2(3H)-one. Photographs were taken after 4 days of incubation in the microtitre plates.

### Heterologous expression in E. coli

The BX8 and BX9 proteins were expressed in E. coli by inserting the cDNA into a modified pET3a (Rosenberg *et al.*, 1987) (BX8) or pET28a vector (BX9) (Novagen); the enzymes were purified by means of a C-terminal (pET3a) or N-terminal (pET28a) six histidine residue tag (Qiagen Ni-NTA purification system) and used for enzyme assay as described above. Purified enzyme was used for the immunization of rabbits (Eurogentech, Belgium)
