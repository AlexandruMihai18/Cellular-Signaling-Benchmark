2-Acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (2-acyl-GPE) acyltransferase and acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) synthetase are thought to be dual catalytic activities of a single inner membrane enzyme. A filter disc replica print method for the detection of acyl-ACP synthetase activity by colony fluorography was used to screen a mutagenized population of cells for acyl-ACP synthetase mutants (*aas*). All *aas* mutants lacked both acyl-ACP synthetase and 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase activities *in vitro*. There was no detectable acyl-CoA-independent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into phosphatidylethanolamine or the major outer membrane lipoprotein in *aas* mutants. Exogenous lysophospholipid uptake and acylation was also lacking in *aas* mutants. Lipoprotein acylation by phospholipids synthesized by the *de novo* biosynthetic pathway was not affected in *aas* mutants showing that this gene product was not directly involved in lipoprotein biogenesis. The *aas* mutants had an altered membrane phospholipid composition and accumulated both 2-acyl-GPE and acylphosphatidylglycerol. Acylphosphatidylglycerol accumulation was due to the transacylase activity of lysophospholipase L2 (the *pldB* gene product) since *aas pldb* double mutants accumulated 2-acyl-GPE, but not acylphosphatidylglycerol. The *aas* allele was mapped to 61 min of the *Escherichia coli* chromosome, and the deduced gene order in this region was *thyA-aas-lysA*. The biochemical, physiological, and genetic analyses of *aas* mutants support the conclusion that 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase and acyl-ACP synthetase are two activities of the same protein and confirm that this enzyme system participates in membrane phospholipid turnover and governs the acyl-CoA independent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids and lysophospholipids into the membrane.

Membrane lipoprotein to form a thioether linkage (1) or to the abundant periplasmic glucose polymers known as membrane-derived oligosaccharides (2). The diacylglycerol remaining in the membrane is phosphorylated by diacylglycerol kinase to yield phosphatidic acid which then re-enters the mainstream of the *E. coli* phospholipid biosynthetic pathway (3). Acyl moieties at the 1-position of PtdEtn¹ are also metabolically active, and this process is related to the transacylation reactions that occur during the maturation of the bacterial lipoproteins (4). The resulting 2-acyl-GPE is then recycled to PtdEtn by 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase (4–6). This inner-membrane enzyme transfers fatty acids to the 1-position either from an acyl-ACP derivative or from nonesterified fatty acids in the presence of ATP and Mg²⁺ (5, 6). Acyltransferase activity is blocked by monospecific ACP antibodies indicating that ACP is required for the ATP-dependent acylation of 2-acyl-GPE (5). 2-Acyl-GPE acyltransferase/acyl-ACP synthetase was solubilized and purified from *E. coli* inner membranes (7). The biochemical data support the concept that both enzymatic reactions are catalyzed by a heterodimer composed of a membrane-bound acyltransferase subunit and ACP (7). The physiological function of 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase is to regenerate PtdEtn from 2-acyl-GPE formed by transacylation reactions or phospholipase A₁ action. 2-Acyl-GPE acyltransferase is also thought to be required for the acyl-CoA-independent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids (8) and 2-acyl-lysophospholipids into the cell membrane (9). The goal of the present work was to isolate mutants lacking 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase and acyl-ACP synthetase activity to corroborate the conclusion that 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase/acyl-ACP synthetase are dual catalytic activities of the same protein complex, and to confirm the physiological role of the acyltransferase/synthetase in fatty acid and lysophospholipid uptake, and in maintaining membrane phospholipid composition.

ries, bacterial PtdEtn and phospholipid standards. ACP was purified by the method of Rock and Cronan (10). 2-Acyl-GPE was prepared by digestion of *E. coli* PtdEtn with *R. arraihizus* lipase as described by Homma and Nojima (11). 2-Acyl-GPE and 2-acyl-GPC concentrations were determined using the method of Stewart (12) and using *E. coli* PtdEtn as a standard. All other biochemicals and solvents were reagent grade or better.

**Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions**—All strains used in this work were derivatives of *E. coli* K-12 and are listed in Table I. Minimal growth medium consisted of M9 minimal salts (17), 0.4% glycerol, 0.2% casein hydrolysate, and 0.001% thiamine. Rich broth or agar was composed of 10 g/liter tryptone, 1 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, and 15 g/liter agar. The *fadD* allele in strains LCH22, LCH29, LCH30, and LCH31 was introduced by transduction with P1vir phage grown on strain DC451 (*fadD zae-2::Tn10*) and the *fadE* defect was introduced into strains LCH40 and LCH41 by transduction with P1vir phage propagated on strain DC405 (*fadE zaf-2::Tn10*). The *recA* lesion was introduced into strains LCH22, LCH31, LCH40, and LCH41 by removing the transposable element (18, 19) followed by transduction with P1vir phage grown on strain SJ169 (*recA srl::Tn10*). The F'(*lacIq*) factor was introduced into strains LCH22, LCH31, LCH40, and LCH41 by mating with strain JA211 (F'(*lacIq*)) and selection of the progeny on lactose minimal plates. The final step in strain construction was transformation with recombinant plasmids. The pKEN126 plasmid contained a tandem duplication of *lppP-lacP0-lpp-bla* sequences and expressed the major outer membrane lipoprotein (20). The pJG310 plasmid had a single copy of *lppP-lacP0-lpp-bla* sequences and expressed lipoprotein-β-lactamase fusion protein (21). In both cases, lipoprotein gene expression was regulated by the *lacUV5* promoter-operator region, and expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG to the growth medium (4, 20, 21). Strain LCH66 (*aas-1 pldB12*) was constructed by transduction of strain LK29 with P1vir propagated on strain LCH61. Tetracycline-resistant recombinants were selected and screened for defective acyl-ACP synthetase activity by the colony autoradiography method. The cell density was measured using a Klett-Summerson colorimeter calibrated by determining the number of colony forming units per milliliter as a function of the colorimeter readings.

**Isolation of Acyl-ACP Synthetase Mutants**—A log-phase culture of strain UB1005 (5 × 10⁸ cells/ml) grown in glycerol minimal medium was mutagenized with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (5 μg per ml of cell suspension) for 1 h at 37 °C as outlined by Miller (17). Surviving single cell clones were grown on rich agar at 30 °C. About 94% of the cells were killed and 3% of the survivors had a Lac⁻ phenotype. The replica printing method described by Raetz (22) was used to isolate acyl-ACP synthetase mutants with a few modifications. After the mutagenized cells were transferred to a Whatman number 42 filter disc, they were permeabilized with a solution of 25% sucrose in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mg/ml lysozyme, and 10 mM EDTA. The replica print was then placed on a dry paper towel to remove excess liquid, transferred to another Petri dish, and rapidly frozen/thawed twice with liquid nitrogen. A 1-ml reaction mixture containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM ATP, 100 mM MgCl₂, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μM [³H]palmitic acid (specific activity 60 Ci/mmol) and 2% Triton X-100 was then applied to the replica print. After incubation at 42 °C for 1 h, the replica print was washed twice in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (3:6:1, v/v) to remove unreacted [³H]palmitic acid and to precipitate [³H]palmitoyl-ACP. The washed replica print was dried, sprayed with EN³HANCE, and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C. Following fluorography, the replica print was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to localize the colonies. Candidate mutants defective in acyl-ACP synthetase were identified by comparison of the blue-stained replica print with the corresponding fluorogram. Colonies were then purified and grown in rich medium at 30 °C and cell extracts prepared for the direct determination of acyl-ACP synthetase activity *in vitro*. Approximately 40,000 colonies were screened by autoradiography and two strains (LCH1 (*aas-1*) and LCH2 (*aas-2*)) that did not possess detectable acyl-ACP synthetase activity in cell lysates were found, and strain LCH1 was selected for further study. Although the screening was performed to potentially isolate temperature-sensitive mutants, strains with temperature-sensitive acyl-ACP synthetase activity were not found. Both LCH1 and

LCH2 lacked acyl-ACP synthetase activity at 30 and 42 °C.

**Acyl-ACP Synthetase and 2-Acyl-GPE Acyltransferase Assays—**  
Membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation of bacterial cell lysates as described previously (7). The standard acyl-ACP synthetase assay (23) contained 5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl₂, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 M LiCl, 60 μM [³H]palmitic acid, 15 μM ACP, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the indicated amount of membrane protein in a final volume of 40 μl. At the end of 10 min at 37 °C, 30 μl of the assay mixture was withdrawn and deposited on a Whatman 3MM filter disc and washed with two changes of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (3:6:1, v/v) to remove unreacted fatty acid. The filter papers were dried and counted in 3 ml of ACS scintillation solution to determine the amount of [³H]palmitoyl-ACP formed.

The standard 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase assay contained 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM [³H]palmitic acid, 100 μM 2-acyl-GPE, 10 μM ACP, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the indicated amount of membrane protein in a final volume of 40 μl (5). Incubations were terminated after 10 min at 37 °C by adding 0.2 ml of ethanol. The mixture was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and the sample applied to the preabsorbant layer of a Silica Gel G plate. The plate was then developed with chloroform/methanol/ acetic acid (85:15:10, v/v), the PtdEtn area was located with the Bioscan imaging detector, and the amount of [³H]PtdEtn formed was determined by scraping the Silica Gel from the plate and scintillation counting.

**Incorporation of Exogenous Fatty Acids and Lysophospholipids—**  
Strains were grown to the mid-logarithmic phase (approximately 5 × 10⁸ cells/ml) in glycerol minimal medium containing 0.5% Brij-58 and labeled with 25 μCi/ml of [³H]palmitic acid. Culture samples (1 ml) were placed on ice, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed with ice-cold unlabeled medium. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24) and were separated on Silica Gel G thin-layer chromatography plates developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (55:20:5, v/v). The location of radioactivity on the thin-layer plate was determined with the Bioscan imaging detector. The labeled phospholipids were identified by their migration with standards and then scraped from the plate and counted in 3 ml of scintillation fluid. The same experimental approach was used to assess the ability of strains to incorporate exogenous lysophospholipids except that 100 μM 2-acyl-GPC was added to the culture at the same time as the [³H]- palmitate.

**Phospholipid Composition—** The phospholipid composition of *aas* mutants was determined by steady-state [³²P]orthophosphate labeling as described by Nishijima and Raetz (25). Strains UB1005 and LCH1 (*aas-1*) were continuously labeled with 50 μCi/ml of [³²P] for five generations of logarithmic growth at 37 °C in rich medium. Cells were harvested, and the phospholipids were extracted (24) and analyzed by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel G layers developed first with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) followed by chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10). Phospholipids were visualized by autoradiography, and the radioactive areas were scraped from the plate and counted in 3 ml of scintillation solution. Phospholipids were identified by comparison with standards.

**Lipoprotein Acylation—** Strains LCH22, LCH31, LCH40, LCH41, SJ126, and SJ127 were grown in glycerol minimal medium containing 0.5% Brij-58 to a density of 3.2 × 10⁸ cells/ml. The cultures were labeled with 25 μCi/ml of [³H]palmitic acid for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, extracted, and the phospholipid labeling pattern determined as described above. Lipoprotein acylation was determined by boiling the cell pellets for 3 min in SDS-gel electrophoresis sample buffer and separating the acylated proteins on a 15% acrylamide/0.4% bisacrylamide gel prepared in 0.375 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 0.1% SDS and 7.55 M urea according to Tian *et al.* (26). Fluorography was performed as described (4).

**Genetic Analysis—** The *aas* allele was first localized to a region of the chromosome by mating strain LCH1 (*aas-1*) with the collection of Hfr::Tn10 mapping strains (14). Tet⁺ exconjugants were selected on rich agar containing 10 μg/ml of tetracycline hydrochloride and either nalidixic acid or streptomycin to counterselect against the Hfr. The exconjugants were scored for acyl-ACP synthetase activity by replica printing. Plλr-mediated transduction of *aas* with other markers in the 60–65 min region located *aas* near 61 min. Significant cotransduction between *aas*, *argA*, *thyA*, and *lysA* was found, and these markers were used to refine the map location. The location of *aas* with respect to *thyA* was determined from a three-factor cross.

Cotransduction frequencies were converted to map distance using the formula of Wu (27).

### RESULTS

#### Isolation of Acyl-ACP Synthetase Mutants—  
A colony autoradiography method was developed to screen a mutagenized population of strain UB1005 for the presence of acyl-ACP synthetase activity. Acyl-ACP formation (a dark colony) was completely dependent on ATP and the addition of exogenous ACP to the assay mixture increased the intensity of colony labeling. However, there was sufficient endogenous ACP present to produce adequate colony labeling for routine screening. Two strains, LCH1 (*aas-1*) and LCH2 (*ass-2*), identified by this procedure had identical biochemical and physiological properties although strain LCH1 (*aas-1*) was used for most of the experiments in this report. Strain LCH1 did not have a growth phenotype under any of the standard laboratory culture conditions we employed. Filter disc screening of mutant colonies and assays of cell extracts were performed at 30 and 42 °C in order to recognize temperature-sensitive mutations in acyl-ACP synthetase; however, extracts from strains LCH1 and LCH2 lacked acyl-ACP synthetase activity at both 30 and 42 °C, and no temperature-sensitive mutants were found.

#### Biochemical Characterization of Strain LCH1—  
Membranes were isolated from strains UB1005 and LCH1 (*aas-1*) and the specific activities of 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase and acyl-ACP synthetase were compared. Membranes from strain UB1005 had acyltransferase activity of 0.21 nmol/min/mg and synthetase activity of 20 pmol/min/mg. In contrast, Strain LCH1 (*aas-1*) had <0.01 nmol/min/mg of acyltransferase activity and <0.1 pmol/min/mg of synthetase activity. The same results were obtained with strain LCH2 (*aas-2*) (not presented). The acyltransferase/synthetase was postulated to be responsible for the uptake and incorporation of fatty acids into PtdEtn in strains (*fadD*) lacking acyl-CoA synthetase activity (8). In a control experiment, strain LCH29 (*fadD*) incorporated exogenous [³H]palmitate exclusively into PtdEtn as anticipated (8). In contrast, strain LCH30 (*aas-1 fadD*) did not incorporate exogenous [³H]palmitate into PtdEtn (Fig. 1) or any other phospholipid class (not shown) illustrating that *aas* mutants lacked the acyl-CoA-independent pathway.

![Figure 1](https://i.imgur.com/yourimage.png)

**FIG. 1.** Strain LCH30 (*aas-1 fadD*) was unable to incorporate exogenous palmitic acid into PtdEtn. Strains LCH29 (*fadD*) and LCH30 (*fadD aas-1*) were grown in glycerol-minimal medium to a density of 3.2 × 10⁸ cells/ml. [³H]Palmitic acid (25 μCi/ml) was added, and at the indicated times cells were harvested, extracted, and the amount of [³H]PtdEtn formed determined by thin-layer chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.”
### 2-Acyl-GPE Acyltransferase/Acyl-ACP Synthetase Mutants

A second physiological process ascribed to this enzyme system was the uptake and acylation of exogenous 2-acyl-lysophospholipids (9). This parameter was measured in *aas* mutants using exogenous 2-acyl-GPC as the lysophospholipid and \[^3H\]-palmitic acid (9). 2-Acyl-GPC uptake and acylation was easily detected in *fadD* mutants, but was absent in *aas fadD* double mutants (Table II). Phosphatidylcholine formation was also blocked in strain LCH1 (*aas-1*) which was capable of assimilating large amounts of exogenous fatty acid for phospholipid synthesis via the acyl-CoA-dependent (*fadD*) pathway (Table II), showing that the ACP-dependent acyltransferase/synthetase was the only mechanism for the uptake and acylation of 2-acyl-lysophospholipids in *E. coli*. These data illustrate that the *aas* mutation results in the concomitant loss of both 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase and acyl-ACP synthetase activities *in vitro* and blocks the acyl-CoA-independent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids and lysophospholipids into the membrane *in vivo*.

#### Alterations in Phospholipid Composition Due to the *aas* Mutation
The presence of the *aas* mutants did not cause a major change in the amounts of the major phospholipid species, but two minor phospholipid components accumulated in *aas* mutants. First, lysophosphatidylethanolamine content increased (Fig. 2) as was anticipated since this phospholipid is a substrate for the acyltransferase/synthetase. However, the largest difference between wild type and *aas* mutants was the accumulation of another phospholipid identified as acyl-PtdGro (Fig. 2). Acyl-PtdGro is formed by the action of lysophospholipase L₂ which transfers the fatty acid from the 2-acyl-GPE to the headgroup glycerol of PtdGro (28, 29). Hydrolysis of 2-acyl-GPE to fatty acid and GPE is a second reaction catalyzed by lysophospholipase L₂ (28). To confirm the identity of the phospholipid that accumulates in *aas* mutants, we examined the phospholipid composition of *pldB* mutants that lack lysophospholipase L₂ activity (see Fig. 5). Strain LK29 (*pldB12*) did not contain detectable levels of acyl-PtdGro. Strain LCH66 (*aas-1 pldb12*) possessed elevated levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, but did not accumulate acyl-PtdGro (Fig. 3).

#### Protein Acylation in *aas* Mutants
In strains (*fadD*) lacking acyl-CoA synthetase activity, exogenous fatty acids were transported into the cell, esterified to PtdEtn, and then transferred to the amino terminus of lipoprotein (4, 5, 8). To clarify the role of *aas* in these steps, protein acylation by exogenous \[^3H\]palmitate was examined in *aas* mutants carrying either the pKEN126 or pJG310 expression vectors (Fig. 4). In the control strains, SJ126 (*fadD* pKEN126) and SJ127 (*fadD* pJG310), fatty acids were incorporated into PtdEtn and efficiently transferred to both the lipoprotein (Lpp) and the lipoprotein-β-lactamase (Lpp-bla) fusion protein. In contrast, strains LCH31 (*aas fadD* pKEN126) and LCH22 (*aas fadD* pJG310) failed to incorporate exogenous \[^3H\]palmitate into either phospholipids or lipoproteins. Strains LCH40 (*aas fadE* pKEN126) and LCH41 (*aas fadE* pJG310) were capable of uptake and esterification of exogenous fatty acids by the acyl-CoA-dependent pathway, and in these two strains both phospholipids and lipoproteins were labeled by exogenous \[^3H\] palmitate. These data show that the acyltransferase/synthetase was required for incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into PtdEtn, but this enzyme system was not involved in the transacylation of fatty acids from PtdEtn to the lipoproteins.

#### Genetic Location of *aas* on the Bacterial Chromosome
The replica print method was used to localize the *aas* gene on the *E. coli* chromosome. Strain LCH1 was mated with a series of Hfr::Tn10 strains (14), and Tet^R^ recombinants were selected and assayed for acyl-ACP synthetase activity. These experiments localized the *aas* gene between 60 and 65 min of the chromosome. Next, a series of P1vir-mediated transduction experiments was employed using selectable markers in this region of the chromosome, and the gene was localized to 61 min (Fig. 5). To confirm the gene order in this region, a three-point transduction experiment was performed by infecting strain LCH1 (*aas-1*) with P1vir phage grown on strain LCH47 (argA::Tn10 thyA). Tet^R^ recombinants (242) were selected and scored for *thyA* on plates and *aas* using the colony fluorography method. The results were: *thyA⁻ aas⁺*, 19; *thyA⁻ aas⁻*, 25; *thyA⁺ aas⁺*, 8; and *thyA⁺ aas⁻*, 190; confirming the gene order as argA-thyA-aas. We did not find a recombinant that was defective in acyl-ACP synthetase but not 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase or vice versa supporting the concept that a single gene encodes both activities.

**Dual catalytic activities of the same protein.** The first step in the acyltransferase catalytic cycle is the ATP-dependent ligation of a fatty acid to an enzyme-bound ACP subunit (Fig. 6). ACP is not covalently attached to the acyltransferase but is dissociated by high ionic strength conditions accounting for

**FIG. 6. Physiological role of 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase/acyl-ACP synthetase in membrane phospholipid turnover and uptake.** Exogenous fatty acids are first converted to acyl-CoA derivatives and then incorporated into PtdEtn by the de novo biosynthetic pathway. In *fadD* mutants, acyl-CoA formation is blocked revealing a mechanism for the incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into PtdEtn via the 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase/acyl-ACP synthetase pathway. This pathway allows for the incorporation of exogenous 2-acyl-lysophospholipids into the membrane. Lysophospholipid acylation is blocked in *aas* mutants showing that there is no comparable acyl-CoA-dependent pathway for lysophospholipid incorporation into the membrane. Double mutants (*aas fadD*) do not incorporate fatty acids into any phospholipid species.

The acyl-ACP synthetase activity (7). The acyl-ACP intermediate is then transferred to 2-acyl-GPE to form PtdEtn and regenerate enzyme-bound ACP. Both enzyme activities copurify and are associated with a single protein species (7). The *aas* mutants were selected solely on the basis of defective acyl-ACP synthetase activity; however, the mutants obtained lacked both acyltransferase and synthetase activities in vitro. The *aas* allele behaves as a single genetic locus in P1vir-mediated transductions and is located at min 61 of the chromosome (Fig. 5). Cloning and DNA sequencing of the *aas* locus will be the next step in verifying that a single structural gene encodes both activities.

Physiological analysis of *aas* mutants confirms the role of 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase/acyl-ACP synthetase in membrane phospholipid metabolism. First, this enzyme system is responsible for the uptake and incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into the 1-position of PtdEtn (Fig. 6). There is no detectable phospholipid synthesis from exogenous fatty acids in *aas fadD* double mutants (Fig. 1), illustrating that the acyl-CoA synthetase (*fadD*) and acyl-ACP synthetase (*aas*) are components of the only two pathways for the uptake and incorporation of extracellular fatty acids in *E. coli*. Second, the inability of *aas fadD* and *aas* mutants to acylate exogenous

lysophospholipids (Table II) shows that the acyltransferase/synthetase pathway is the only route for the esterification of extracellular lysophospholipids. Third, the fact that acyl-GPE and acyl-PtdGro accumulate in *aas* mutants (Figs. 2 and 3) indicates that the resynthesis of PtdEtn is the primary metabolic fate of 2-acyl-GPE. The possibility that the acyltransferase may also be directly involved in transferring fatty acids to the amino terminus of the lipoprotein is ruled out by our experiments (Fig. 4). Although lipoprotein acylation by exogenous fatty acids is blocked in *aas fadD* double mutants, lipoprotein acylation does occur in *aas* mutants via the acyl-CoA synthetase (*fadD*)-dependent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into PtdEtn which are then transferred to the lipoprotein (Fig. 4).

The *aas* mutation does not have a major effect on membrane phospholipid composition, but the minor alterations observed point to the function of the acyltransferase/synthetase system and lysophospholipase L₂ in membrane phospholipid metabolism (Fig. 7). 2-Acyl-GPE acyltransferase appears to be the most economical mechanism for scavenging 2-acyl-GPE generated from phospholipid turnover, and the accumulation of acyl-GPE in *aas* mutants indicates that the acyltransferase/synthetase is the most active pathway under normal growth conditions. However, *E. coli* inner membranes also contain a specific phospholipase that either degrades 2-acyl-lysophospholipids to fatty acid and GPE or catalyzes the transfer of fatty acids to PtdGro to form acyl-PtdGro (15, 28, 29). This route for the catabolism of 2-acyl-GPE provides an alternate mechanism to prevent 2-acyl-GPE from accumulating. The observation that acyl-PtdGro accumulates in *aas* mutants demonstrates that the lysophospholipase L₂ pathway is significant in the absence of acyltransferase/synthetase activity. Blocking the lysophospholipase L₂ route in *pldB* mutants does not lead to a large increase in acyl-GPE accumulation (Fig. 3) indicating that there are other enzymes that catabolize 2-acyl-GPE. A membrane-associated transacylase activity has been characterized that converts two 2-acyl-GPEs to PtdEtn and GPE (11), and there is a second lysophospholipase located in the soluble fraction (30). Both of these activities are distinct from the *pldB* gene product (14), and the role of these enzymes in controlling 2-acyl-GPE levels is not clear. Although lyso-phospholipids are potent detergents and would be expected to disrupt membrane structure if present in high concentrations, the lack of a growth phenotype in *aas* mutants illustrates that there are multiple mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of lysophospholipids and that the elevated levels of acyl-GPE observed in these strains are not deleterious.

**FIG. 7. Alternate metabolic fates for 2-acyl-GPE.** 2-Acyl-GPE arises from the action of phospholipase A₁ (the *pldA* gene product) or from the transfer of fatty acids from the 1 position of PtdEtn to lipoprotein (4). 2-Acyl-GPE can be converted to PtdEtn via acylation by 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase/acyl-ACP synthetase (the *aas* gene product) or can be either hydrolyzed to fatty acid plus GPE or the acyl moiety transferred to the headgroup of PtdGro by the action of lysophospholipase L₂ (the *pldB* gene product).
