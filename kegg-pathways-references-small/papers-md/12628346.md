It has recently become clear that lysosomes have more complex functions than simply being the end-point on a degradative pathway. Similarly, it is now emerging that there are interesting functions for the limiting membranes around these organelles and their associated proteins. Although it has been known for several decades that the lysosomal membrane contains several highly N-glycosylated proteins, including the lysosome-associated membrane proteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 and lysosomal integral membrane protein-2/lysosomal membrane glycoprotein-85 (LIMP-2/LGP 85), specific functions of these proteins have only recently begun to be recognized. Although the normal functions of LAMP-1 can be substituted by the structurally related LAMP-2, LAMP-2 itself has more specific tasks. Knock-out of LAMP-2 in mice has revealed roles for LAMP-2 in lysosomal enzyme targeting, autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. LAMP-2 deficiency in humans leads to Danon disease, a fatal cardiomyopathy and myopathy. Furthermore, there is evidence that LAMP-2 functions in chaperone-mediated autophagy. LIMP-2/LGP 85 also seems to have specific functions in maintaining endosomal transport and lysosomal biogenesis. The pivotal function of lysosomal membrane proteins is also highlighted by the recent identification of disease-causing mutations in cystine and sialic acid transporter proteins, leading to nephropathic cystinosis and Salla disease.

Since the discovery of the lysosomal compartment by de Duve [1], much has been learned about the function of lysosomes in health and disease. Lysosomes represent the final destination for many endocytic, autophagic and secretory molecules targeted for destruction or recycling. Accordingly, numerous functions, including the turnover of cellular proteins, downregulation of surface receptors, release of endocytosed nutrients, inactivation of pathogenic organisms, repair of the plasma membrane and loading of processed antigens onto MHC class II molecules, are thought to depend on normal lysosomal function [2]. The physiological importance of lysosomes is further highlighted by a number of diseases resulting from defects in lysosomal biogenesis and normal degradative capacity [3]. Lysosomes can be morphologically very heterogeneous owing to their numerous cellular functions and variations

in content. Specifically, lysosomes are defined as hydrolase-rich, acidic organelles that lack both the cation-dependent (46 kDa) and cation-independent (300 kDa) mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs). These receptors bind newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes in the trans Golgi network (TGN) and transport them to early and late endosomes where the enzymes are dissociated from the receptors as a result of the acidic pH in these organelles. MPRs can then recycle back to the TGN. The endocytic pathway also delivers substrates from the cell surface to the lysosomal compartment for degradation [4].

One crucial role of the membrane enclosing late endosomes and lysosomes is to separate the potent luminal acid hydrolases from other cellular constituents and so protect them from unwanted degradation. The unique constitution of the lysosomal membrane was recognized some 20 years ago. In addition to containing cholesterol and having a characteristic phospholipid composition [5], it was reported to be extremely rich in carbohydrate [6]. Furthermore, certain lysosomal membrane proteins must mediate the essential functions of this organelle. For example, the acidification of the lysosomal lumen by a proton pump, as well as translocation of amino acids, fatty acids and carbohydrates resulting from hydrolytic degradation and of nutrients liberated by specific lysosomal hydrolases (vitamin B₁₂ and cholesterol), have all been attributed to integral proteins of the lysosomal membrane. In addition, lysosomal membrane proteins are thought to be involved in lysosomal homotypic fusion as well as in fusion with other membrane organelles, including endosomes, phagosomes and the plasma membrane [7].

In the early 1980s, two abundant glycoproteins of high molecular mass were described biochemically [8]. However, a more thorough understanding of the protein composition was achieved after the production of mono- and polyclonal antibodies directed against purified lysosomal membranes [9,10]. These studies revealed highly glycosylated integral proteins, in the 90–120- and 30–85-kDa ranges, that were enriched in late endosomes and/or lysosomes. These proteins were designated lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs), lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (LPGs) and lysosomal integral membrane proteins (LIMPs) (Table 1).

It has been proposed that LAMPs and LIMPs are tightly packed and represent more than 50% of the total

The role of specific proteins in the transport of metabolites across the lysosomal membrane has been particularly well demonstrated by intralysosomal accumulation of digestion products in certain lysosomal storage diseases. Amino acids are translocated across the lysosomal membrane by a number of transporters. However, only cystinosin, the cystine transporter, has so far been identified and cloned. The gene encoding cystinosin (CTNS) is mutated in patients with the lysosomal storage disease cystinosis, which primarily affects kidney function [17, 18]. Cystinosin comprises 367 amino acids and spans the membrane seven times (Fig. 1). The large N-terminal portion is highly glycosylated and resides in the lysosomal lumen. The smaller C-terminal cytosolic domain contains a lysosomal targeting signal. Interestingly, there is an additional targeting signal in one of the cytosolic loops [19]. The existence of other lysosomal amino acid transporters is supported by the partially successful treatment of cystinosis patients with cysteamine, an aminothiol. This drug enters the lysosomal compartment through a specific, but as yet unidentified, transporter and reacts with the stored cystine to form a mixed disulphide that is subsequently able to leave the lysosome through an intact lysine transporter [17]. Monosaccharide transport through the lysosomal membrane has also been described. A monosaccharide transporter has been identified and linked to another lysosomal storage disease, known as sialic acid storage disease or Salla disease [20]. Patients with Salla disease possess a mutated gene (AST) that encodes sialin. Wild-type sialin has 12 transmembrane domains and lacks a signal peptide and a lysosomal targeting sequence (Fig. 1). It is therefore likely that this transporter is not exclusively located in the lysosomal membrane. Apart from cystinosin and sialin, the existence of many other lysosomal membrane transporters involved in the transport of amino acids, mono- and oligosaccharides [6, 21]

and oligopeptides [22] has been demonstrated by specific uptake experiments, although the exact nature of these transporters is unknown.

Another lysosomal transporter protein, designated LAPTM4α, with tandemly arranged tyrosine-based lysosomal sorting signals, traverses the membrane four times and is possibly involved in mediating the transport of nucleotides [23]. Recently, two putative adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCA2 and ABCB9, were cloned and, after transfection, were shown to be localized in the lysosomal membrane [24, 25]. Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2 (NRAMP2), which is a divalent metal transporter, is an integral membrane glycoprotein with 12 transmembrane domains localized in late endosomes and lysosomes. NRAMP2 functions as an endosomal iron transporter in the transferrin cycle [26].

The protein NPC-1, with 13 transmembrane domains and a suggested lysosome-targeting motif, has received particular attention since mutations in the respective NPC gene result in another lysosomal storage disease, known as Niemann–Pick type-C syndrome. The pathological accumulation of cholesterol in fibroblasts of patients with this disorder is apparently due to a failure in the mechanism responsible for the redistribution of cholesterol taken up by endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein [27].

CLN3 is another integral lysosomal membrane protein with multiple transmembrane domains which is associated with a human disease. Mutations in CLN3 have been identified in patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or Batten disease [28]. Co-localization with a synaptic vesicle marker suggests that CLN3 might be involved in synaptic vesicle transport [29]. It is thought to function as a proton sensor because human CLN3 can complement the CLN3-deficient yeast strain btn-1Δ in which the vacuolar pH is decreased in the early phase of growth [30]. Distinct types of NCL diseases are caused by mutations in CLN5, CLN6 and CLN8, which encode novel transmembrane proteins [31].

Endolyn, like LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, is a highly glycosylated lysosomal and endosomal membrane protein of 78 kDa that resembles sialomucin-like proteins and exhibits structural similarities to cytokine and growth factor family members [32]. The abundance of endolyn in the lysosomal membrane and its classification as a minor or major component of the lysosomal membrane are unclear.

The 70-kDa lysosomal apyrase-like protein (LALP70), which is almost identical to a Golgi UDPase, is an integral membrane protein located in a subfraction of lysosomal/autophagic vacuoles [33]. LALP70 might participate in the metabolism of tri- and diphosphate nucleotides, which are sequestered from the cytoplasm during autophagocytosis. The lysosomal membrane enzyme acetyl-CoA:α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase catalyses the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA in the cytosol to terminal α-linked glucosamine residues of heparan sulphate in the lysosomal matrix [34]. This enzyme is associated with detergent-resistant membrane microdomains, or rafts, of the lysosomal membrane [35]. A genetic deficiency of this membrane-bound enzyme leads to the severe lysosomal storage disease Sanfilippo disease type C (MPS IIIC), in which non-digested heparan sulphate and heparin are stored in the lysosomes.

Another well-defined constituent of the lysosomal membrane is the precursor of lysosomal acid phosphatase

After arrival in the lysosome, the luminal domain of LAP, which contains the active site of the enzyme, is slowly released into the lysosomal matrix by proteolytic processing [36]. LAP shares overlapping functions with the luminal lysosomal phosphatase TRAP. Both proteins are possibly involved in the dephosphorylation of osteopontin, a major organic component of the bone matrix [37].

Localization and trafficking of the major LGPs

At steady-state, LAMPs and LIMP-2/LGP 85 are mainly localized in the limiting membranes of lysosomes and late endosomes (Fig. 2) [7]. Small amounts are also found in early endosomal membranes [38] and the plasma membrane [39,40]. LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 are also present on the limiting membrane of late autophagic vacuoles [41,42]. Cell-surface expression of LAMP-1 and/or LAMP-2 was increased during the activation of platelets and peripheral blood monocytes, as well as in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and in highly metastatic tumour cells [7,43,44]. In addition to their localization in the lysosomal limiting membrane, LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 are also found in the lysosomal/ endosomal lumen; this has been detected by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 2) and by biochemical methods [45,46]. It has been suggested that the luminal LAMP molecules are soluble, but it is also possible that they are associated with the internal membranes of lysosomes or endosomes (Fig. 2). In contrast to LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, LIMP-1 is predominantly localized on the internal membranes of endosomes and lysosomes [47]. LAMP-2 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing, which generates three isoforms with different transmembrane and cytosolic domains (LAMP-2a, -2b and -2c). These isoforms have slightly different subcellular locations. LAMP-2c has a predominantly lysosomal localization, whereas higher levels of LAMP-2a and LAMP-2b are present at the cell surface [48]. LAMPs and LIMPs are not static components of the lysosomal membrane; they are in dynamic equilibrium between lysosomes, endosomes and the plasma membrane [49,50].

Newly synthesized LAMPs and LIMPs are transported from the TGN to endosomes/lysosomes mainly via an intracellular route without appearing at the cell surface [7]. LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 molecules in the TGN are packed into vesicles that are distinct from clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) containing MPR and AP-1 adaptors [51], although some LAMP-1 may also be sorted into AP-1 CCVs [52]. The lysosomal targeting depends on either a tyrosine-based (LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LIMP-1) or a di-leucine-based (LIMP-2/LGP 85) sorting signal in the cytoplasmic tail (Refs [36,53,54] and references therein). LAMP-1, LIMP-2/LGP 85 and LIMP-1/CD 63 are targeted from the TGN to lysosomes via an intracellular route [55] that is dependent on the AP-3 adaptor complex [54,56]. Reduced levels of AP-3 in fibroblasts of patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and AP-3 deficiency in fibroblasts from two naturally occurring mouse mutants caused increased cell surface expression of LAMP-1, LAMP-2 and LIMP-1/CD 63, further supporting the proposed role of AP-3 in lysosomal protein targeting [57,58].

At least one other molecule (cytomegalovirus gp 48/MHC class I receptor complex) tagged with di-leucine-based sorting signals required sequentially both AP-1 and AP-3 for efficient lysosomal targeting [59]. However, LAMP-1 was directed to lysosomes without appearing at the cell surface in cells deficient in functional AP-1A adaptor complexes, indicating that AP-1A is not necessary for direct intracellular targeting of LAMP-1 [60].

LIMP-1/CD 63 belongs to the so-called tetraspanins. In addition to localization in late endosomes and lysosomes, it is also present in the secretory granules of certain haemopoietic cells (Ref. [61] and references therein). This molecule may have roles in cell activation and the fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane.

Functions of major lysosomal membrane proteins

Before the publication of recent results demonstrating specific functions, it was assumed that the main role of LGPs was to protect the membrane from degradation by lysosomal hydrolases. This function was attributed to the heavy glycosylation of these proteins [4,7]. The inner surface of the lysosomal limiting membrane is indeed lined with a layer of carbohydrate, generating a continuous glycocalyx [62]. In accordance with this hypothesis, depletion of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides from lysosomal membrane proteins by feeding endoglycosidase H to cultured cells resulted in rapid degradation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 [63]. However, LIMP-2/LGP 85 was relatively stable in the same cells, indicating that asparagine-linked oligosaccharides are not necessary for the stability of all lysosomal membrane proteins.

Recently, LAMP-2 was proposed to be the receptor for the selective uptake and degradation of cytosolic proteins by lysosomes [64]. The cytosolic substrate proteins taken up contain a pentapeptide motif related to KFERQ [65]. The pathway was shown to be activated in confluent lung fibroblast and Chinese hamster ovary cell cultures by serum withdrawal and in rat liver by prolonged starvation (reviewed in Ref. [66]). An analysis by site-directed mutagenesis showed that four positively charged amino acids present in the cytoplasmic tail of LAMP-2a were required for the binding of substrate proteins [67]. In addition to LAMP-2a, the 70-kDa heat-shock cognate protein Hsc 73 was involved. Further chaperones might also be required for the transport, including the heat-shock proteins Hsp 90 and Hsp 40 [68]. During import into the lysosomal lumen, the substrate proteins are unfolded [69]. Contrary to the proposed receptor function of LAMP-2 in chaperone-mediated autophagy, preliminary results with LAMP-2-deficient confluent mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed that lysosomal proteolysis after prolonged serum withdrawal was unchanged compared with control cells (E. Knecht, unpublished). Although it is possible that chaperone-mediated uptake of proteins to lysosomes is not operative in these cells, it is also feasible that LAMP-2 may not be the sole receptor in this pathway.

Mice deficient in LAMP-1 or LAMP-2 were generated to study the functions of these proteins *in vivo*. LAMP-1-deficient mice were viable and fertile. Apart from a mild regional activation of astroglia and an altered immunoreactivity to cathepsin D in the brain, all tissues of these

http://ticb.trends.com
mice were normal [70]. Although LAMP-1 is an abundant protein component of the lysosomal membrane, the properties of lysosomes from LAMP-1-deficient cells, including enzyme activities, luminal pH, osmotic stability, density, morphology, subcellular distribution and lysosomal enzyme processing, were similar to those of control cells. Upregulation of LAMP-2 protein was observed in kidney, spleen and heart of LAMP-1-deficient mice, whereas LIMP-2/LGP85 levels were unaffected. This upregulation was also evident in tissues lacking only one LAMP-1 allele, which suggests a coupling in the regulation between LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 levels. Messenger RNA levels and the half-life of LAMP-2 were not altered in the LAMP-1 knockout tissues, indicating that the upregulation was due to increased protein synthesis. Taken together, these results suggest that elevated levels of LAMP-2 compensated for the LAMP-1 deficiency.

In contrast to the relatively mild phenotype in LAMP-1 knockout mice, a deficiency of LAMP-2 caused severe symptoms; 50% of the mice died at the age of 20–40 days post partum, and both the early-dying and surviving mice were smaller than the wild-type animals [41]. Electron microscopy revealed a massive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in numerous tissues, including liver, muscle and heart. Both skeletal and cardiac muscle cells showed an accumulation of vacuoles filled with polymorphic contents, some of which could be identified as partially degraded cytoplasmic components, pointing to an autophagic origin. As a likely result of these lysosomal abnormalities, the contractile function of heart muscle was reduced to less than half of that in the controls, and the heart weight/body weight ratio was increased. The physiological importance of LAMP-2 is supported by the finding that LAMP-2 deficiency is the primary defect in Danon disease [71], a lysosomal glycogen storage disease with normal acid maltase activity [72]. Danon disease is characterized by fatal cardiomyopathy, variable mental retardation and mild skeletal myopathy. An accumulation of vacuoles containing cytoplasmic debris within skeletal and cardiac muscle is a diagnostic feature of this disease. This vacuolar myopathy is similar to that found in LAMP-2-deficient mice. All these results imply the importance of an autophagic pathway in the normal function of muscle cells.

A cell-culture system was used to investigate why autophagic vacuoles accumulate in LAMP-2-deficient cells. Their accumulation was preserved in hepatocytes isolated from LAMP-2 knockout mice. In addition, degradation of

long-lived proteins, which mainly occurs via autophagy in hepatocytes, was reduced compared with control cells [41]. Quantitative electron microscopy indicated that the half-life of autophagic vacuoles was prolonged [42], suggesting that retarded consumption rather than increased formation of autophagic vacuoles was the cause of their accumulation. Nevertheless, fusion of vesicles from the endocytic pathway with the autophagic vacuoles as well as the delivery of LAMP-1 into them was apparently normal. The pH of the autophagic vacuoles was also essentially normal, pointing to the correct delivery of the vacuolar proton pump. Investigations on lysosomal biogenesis in LAMP-2-deficient hepatocytes revealed elevated secretion of a subset of lysosomal enzymes, as well as impaired processing of cathepsin D. Further, the steady-state level and half-life of the 46-kDa MPR were severely reduced, with a shift in the localization of MPR from the TGN to autophagic vacuoles. The proportion of 46-kDa MPR found in endosome-associated vesicles and tubules, which are thought to represent an intervening compartment in the recycling from endosomes to the TGN, was reduced in LAMP-2-deficient hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings [42] suggest that LAMP-2 deficiency either directly or indirectly leads to impaired recycling of 46-kDa MPR from endosomes to the TGN, which in turn could explain the partial mistargeting of a subset of lysosomal enzymes. Autophagic vacuoles may therefore accumulate due to impaired capacity for lysosomal degradation.

What is the mechanism of impaired MPR 46 recycling from late endosomes to the TGN in LAMP-2-deficient cells? One possibility is that LAMP-2 is necessary for the sorting of MPR 46 inside endosomes, either directly, or indirectly by stabilizing the factors required for sorting. It is possible that LAMP-2 could participate in chaperone-mediated transport of cytosolic factors that promote sorting from the cytoplasm to the endosomal lumen [64]. Another possibility is that LAMP-2 is needed to prevent transport of MPR 46 from endosomes to lysosomes, thus increasing the probability that the receptor will have sufficient time to reach the endosomal subcompartment that is destined for recycling to the TGN (Fig. 3). Further studies are needed to identify interacting proteins and define the functions of LAMP-2 at the molecular level.

It should be noted that, although autophagic vacuoles accumulate in many tissues of LAMP-2-deficient mice, others, including brain and fibroblasts, do not show this accumulation. It is possible that the structurally related LAMP-1 might compensate in part for the loss of LAMP-2 in these tissues. This hypothesis is supported by the phenotype of mice deficient for both LAMP-1 and LAMP-2. Whereas single knockout mice were fertile and viable—although LAMP-2-deficient mice showed increased postnatal mortality—the loss of both LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 led to embryonic lethality and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in almost all embryonic tissues [75]. This also questions the proposed unique role of LAMP-2 in chaperone-mediated autophagy [64].

LIMP-2/LGP 85 may also have specific roles in lysosome/endosome biogenesis (Fig. 3). Very recently, overexpression of LIMP-2/LGP 85, but not of LAMP-1 or LAMP-2, was shown to result in the accumulation of

large swollen vacuoles possessing both endosomal and lysosomal characteristics [73]. These vacuoles accumulated cholesterol. A subset of them was positive for LAMP-2 and the endosomal lipid LBPA, and another subset contained the early endosomal proteins EEA1 and transferrin receptor. This suggests that some of the LIMP-2/LGP 85 vacuoles correspond to early endosomes and others to late endosomes. On electron microscopy, the large vacuoles appeared electron-lucent with only occasional luminal membranes, suggesting that invagination of internal vesicles might be impaired. A fluid-phase endocytic marker, prefed and chased to lysosomes before overexpression of LIMP-2/LGP 85, was not found in the LIMP-2/LGP 85-induced vacuoles, suggesting that they were not initially derived from lysosomes. A subset of the LIMP-2/LGP 85-induced vacuoles was accessible to endocytic tracers, but traffic from early endosome-like vacuoles to late endosome-like vacuoles, as well as recycling back to the plasma membrane, was retarded. Interestingly, co-expression of dominant-negative Rab5b with LIMP-2/LGP 85 totally impaired the formation of the large swollen vacuoles, indicating that Rab5 function was necessary for their appearance. All these results [73] suggest that LIMP-2/LGP 85 might control the balance between vesicle invagination versus vesicle budding from the limiting membrane of endosomal compartments and thus play a role in the biogenesis and maintenance of endosomes and lysosomes. Interestingly, LIMP-2/LGP 85-induced late endosome/lysosome-like vacuoles resemble the swollen vacuoles seen in cells treated with the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, or expressing a mutant of phosphoinositide 3-phosphate 5-kinase (PI3P 5-kinase). Thus, it is possible that overexpression of LIMP-2/LGP 85 might cause dispersal of the budding machinery, which might be due to impaired recruitment of a cytoplasmic factor involved in vesicular fission and/or fusion, such as PI 3-kinase and/or PI3P 5-kinase.

The crucial role of LIMP-2/LGP 85 in lysosomal biogenesis is also supported by the phenotype of LIMP-2/LGP 85-deficient mice. A deficiency of LIMP-2/LGP 85 led to the development of an obstruction of the ureteric pelvic junction, deafness and peripheral neuropathy. The cellular pathology in the affected tissues can be partially explained by impaired membrane transport processes in the endocytic pathway [75].

### Concluding remarks

Although the major lysosomal membrane proteins have been known for some time, we are only just beginning to unravel their functions. Clearly, they are more than structural components simply involved in maintaining the stability and integrity of the lysosomal limiting membrane. Mutations in mouse and man have revealed more dynamic and unexpected roles of these proteins in lysosomal biogenesis and lysosomal/endosomal function (Fig. 3). Subcellular proteomic analyses will most likely uncover many hitherto unknown integral components of the lysosomal membrane and yield further information about how normal lysosomal membrane transport, stability and function are maintained.

The open arrow indicates chaperone-mediated transport from the cytoplasm into lysosomes, proposed to be mediated by LAMP-2. LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 might also play a role in sorting MPR46 in late endosomes, and/or recycling MPR46 from late endosomes to the trans Golgi network. This might explain the observed accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in different LAMP-deficient cell types. LIMP-2/LGP85 might be involved in the regulation of trafficking from early endosomes to the plasma membrane and late endosomes. For further details see text. LAMP, lysosome-associated membrane protein; LIMP, lysosomal integral membrane protein; LGP, lysosomal membrane glycoprotein; MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; EE, early endosome; LE, late endosome; Lys, lysosome; Avi, early autophagic vacuole; Avd, late autophagic vacuole; TGN, trans Golgi network.
