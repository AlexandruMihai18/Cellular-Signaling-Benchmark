### Abstract

Eukaryotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have evolved to transduce environmental and developmental signals into adaptive and programmed responses. MAPK cascades relay and amplify signals via three types of reversibly phosphorylated kinases leading to the phosphorylation of substrate proteins, whose altered activities mediate a wide array of responses, including changes in gene expression. Cascades may share kinase components, but their signaling specificity is maintained by spatiotemporal constraints and dynamic protein-protein interactions and by mechanisms that include crossinhibition, feedback control, and scaffolding. Plant MAPK cascades regulate numerous processes, including stress and hormonal responses, innate immunity, and developmental programs. Genetic analyses have uncovered several predominant MAPK components shared by several of these processes including the *Arabidopsis thaliana* MAPKs MPK3, 4, and 6 and MAP2Ks MKK1, 2, 4, and 5. Future work needs to focus on identifying substrates of MAPKs, and on understanding how specificity is achieved among MAPK signaling pathways.

also called MKKs or MEKs) that in turn activate MAPKs. MAPKs then target various effector proteins in the cytoplasm or nucleus, which include other kinases, enzymes, or transcription factors (71). More specifically, MAP3Ks are serine or threonine kinases that phosphorylate MAP2Ks at a conserved S/T-X<sub>3-5</sub>-S/T motif, and MAP2Ks phosphorylate MAPKs on threonine and tyrosine residues at a conserved T-X-Y motif (29). The deactivation and regulation of MAPK activity are mediated by tyrosine and serine/threonine-specific phosphatases (86, 131). The formation and integrity of a specific MAPK cascade can be mediated by scaffold proteins, shared docking domains, and adaptor or anchoring proteins (7, 133, 144).

The first reports of plant MAPKs in 1993 identified MsERK1 in alfalfa (42) and D5 kinase in pea (128). During that year, MAPKs were cloned from *Arabidopsis thaliana* (thale cress; 97) and tobacco (145) as well. A seminal work that assigned a function in ethylene signaling to a specific Raf-like kinase, CTR1, was also published (72). This study was an early example of the power of genetic screens in *A. thaliana*. These discoveries were guided by studies of MAPK cascades in yeast and metazoans. At that time, four MAPK pathways were charted in mammalian cells: two extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) modules and two other pathways that involve the MAPKs c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38/Hog (29, 119).

Four MAPK cascades have also been analyzed in yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) extensively: the Fus3/Kss1 mating-pheromone pathway, the Slt2 or Mpk1 cell-wall integrity cascade, the Hog1 high-osmolarity pathway, and a fourth cascade that is part of the filamentation-invasive pathway in response to growth on low-nitrogen media (31). Some of these yeast cascades share key components, but the cascades are tuned to work independently with the help of the scaffolding proteins Ste5 and Pbs2. The mechanisms by which such specificity is maintained to reduce erroneous crosstalk are discussed below.

**INTRODUCTION**

Eukaryotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; also called MPKs) cascades transduce environmental and developmental cues into intracellular responses. In a general model, stimulated plasma membrane receptors activate MAP kinase kinases (MAP3Ks; also called MAPKKKs or MEKKs) or MAP kinase kinases (MAP4Ks; 37). Sequential phosphorylations ensue as MAP3Ks activate downstream MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks;

KINASE ACTIVITIES

The activity of kinases is commonly assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of preferred substrate proteins that contain canonical serine-proline or threonine-proline phosphorylation sites (14). Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a preferred substrate in phosphorylation reactions that is used in vitro or by running the kinase(s) into a polyacrylamide-MBP matrix in an in-gel kinase assay. The amount of radio-labeled ATP quantified in replicated experiments is a measure of the phosphotransfer activity of the kinase. The specificity of such assays can be ensured by including an initial immunoprecipitation-purification of a kinase of interest (116).

Specific chemical inhibitors can target MAPK signaling components. The widely used compounds PD098059 and U0126 can be used to block MAP2K activation. Such inhibition takes place without competing for ATP- or MAPK-binding sites and by stabilizing low-activity forms of MAP2K (46). Compounds such as SB203580, PD169316, and SB202190 are inhibitors of MAPKs (35, 51). Site-directed mutagenesis can also replace specific residues in the ATP-binding pocket to hinder the catalytic activity of MAPK components. Kinase-inactive versions of MAP3Ks and MAP2Ks can be made by substituting a conserved lysine residue for methionine in the ATP-binding domain (5, 130). This approach is similar to the substitution of a lysine to arginine in the phosphotransfer site of MAPKs to produce a catalytically inactive MPK that still binds ATP. Functional studies of MAPKs also substitute threonine and tyrosine with alanine and phenylalanine in the TxY phosphorylation site or a T-loop that yields a nonphosphorylatable, inactive kinase. An inducible inhibition system is also available in which specific mutations alter the conformation of the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase so that it can only accept cell-permeable inhibitors, such as C3–1′-naphtyl (NaPP1) or C3–1′-naphthylmethyl (NMPP1) derivatives of the Src tyrosine kinase family inhibitor PP1 (15). This technique allows specific, inducible inactivation of the engineered kinase and has been applied in a study of *A. thaliana* MAPK4 (19). In some cases, constitutively active versions of MAP3Ks or MAP2Ks can be obtained by removing their regulatory domains (5). However, the results of such studies should be interpreted carefully because the regulatory domain may account for the specificity of protein interactions required for the in vivo integrity of a kinase cascade (29). An alternative approach involves replacing phosphorylation site residues in the kinase activation loop with activated, phosphomimetic MAP3Ks or MAP2Ks (88). Site-directed mutagenesis in the *Drosophila* MAPK rolled, and in the yeast Fus3 and Hog1 MAPKs has produced gain-of-function versions that activate multiple downstream pathways simultaneously (18, 21). However, determining which residues to mutate is not trivial, and the expression of constitutively active MAPKs may be deleterious to eukaryotic cells (33).

Other techniques to detect specific phosphorylation are also used. The differential migration of phosphatase-treated and untreated proteins can be detected by immunoblotting in polyacrylamide gels modified with a Mn²⁺-Phos-tag, which binds to and slows the migration of phosphorylated proteins (74). Other phosphoproteomic approaches have enabled the high-throughput identification of potential MAPK substrates in *A. thaliana* (47, 113). In addition, separating complex samples of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins by isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting has supported phosphoproteomic analyses and promises to support MAPK substrate studies (3).

### KINASE PROPERTIES AND EVOLUTION

The sequences of putative MAPK components from several plant species are available from genome sequencing projects. The genome sequence of *A. thaliana* permitted the identification of approximately 60 MAP3Ks, 10 MAP2Ks, and 20 MAPKs (53). Homologs of these *A. thaliana* kinases have been identified

in other species (53, 55). Given the increase in genome sequences, a challenge involves the correct identification and annotation of such kinases using signature motifs to include them in appropriate kinase families. Highly conserved MAPK motifs can be compiled from the alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, the moss *Physcomitrella patens*, the lycopod *Selaginella moellendorffii*, and in seed plants that include *A. thaliana* (thale cress), *Oryza sativa* (rice), *Vitis vinifera* (grape), *Sorghum bicolor* (sorghum), and *Populus trichocarpa* (poplar). The consensus of MAPK signature motif sequences are illustrated (Figure 1) based on a ClustalW alignment of all curated sequences of putative plant MAP3Ks, MAP2Ks, and MAPKs in Genbank (34, 138).

**MAP3Ks**

MAP3Ks (also known as MAPKKKs and MEKKs) constitute a diverse family of kinases

divided into two large subfamilies. MEKK-like subfamily members are similar to mammalian MEKK1 and to yeast STE11 and BCK1, whereas RAF-like kinases are more similar to mammalian RAF1 (53). Sister clades such as ZIK and MLK-like kinases are mentioned in MAP3K phylogenetic analyses, although these proteins have not been shown to phosphorylate MAP2Ks in plants (28). We found 8 to 10 annotated algal MAP3Ks in *Chlamydomonas* and *Volvox*, and between 40 and 60 gene models for *Sorghum* and *Populus*.

MEKK-like kinases feature a conserved catalytic domain. *A. thaliana* has 10 members in this group, whereas early land plants such as *Physcomitrella* and *Selaginella* have 6 to 8 homologs. Most *A. thaliana*, *Brassica*, and tobacco MEKK-like proteins seem to participate in canonical MAP kinase cascades that activate downstream MAP2Ks. In contrast, within this group, MEKK-like members called MAP3Kε1 and ε2 have not been proved to act in MAPK cascades and are similar to CDC proteins of fission yeast (28).

Two of the best-studied *A. thaliana* RAF-like MAP3Ks, CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE 1 (CTR1) and ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1 (EDR1), which are known to participate in ethylene-mediated signaling and defense responses (49, 50, 60, 72), have close homologs in *Physcomitrella* and *Selaginella*. However, neither CTR1 nor EDR1 have been confirmed to participate in a canonical MAPK cascade, and thus the biochemical functions of these proteins remain uncertain. Moreover, a phylogenetic study proposed that angiosperm RAF-like proteins could be more similar to animal MLKs than animal RAF-like kinases, which suggests that they phosphorylate non-MKK substrates similar to animal MLKs. This analysis also showed that features of CTR1 and EDR1 make them unique to plant lineages (135).

Previous phylogenetic analyses of plant kinase families have discussed their duplication and divergence from animal and yeast ancestral genes (28). Our own, unpublished informatic survey of recently annotated plant kinases indicates the expansion of different lineages in parallel with increasing complexity and rearrangements from algal to dicot and monocot genomes. A continued increase in genome sequences requires the proper annotation of putative kinases to enable their systematic functional characterization.

**MAP2Ks**

MAP2Ks (also known as MEKs and MKKs) fall into four groups (A-D), which are described for *A. thaliana* and rice (54). Group A includes *A. thaliana* MKK1 and MKK2 that act upstream of the MAPK MPK4 (62). MKK2 is also implicated in responses to cold and salinity, and both MKK1 and MKK2 mediate innate immunity responses (93, 114, 137). In the same group, MKK6 activated downstream MPK13 (90). We need to test whether algal and early land plant homologs in group A interact and form cascades that respond to abiotic and biotic stresses together with group B MAPKs, as noted below in *A. thaliana*.

Group B MKKs include *A. thaliana* MKK3, which has corresponding homologs in rice, *Selaginella*, *Physcomitrella*, and *Chlamydomonas*. Kinases in this group are distinguished by a nuclear transfer factor (NTF) domain (54). NTF domains prototypically function to enhance the nuclear import of cargo proteins (129), which indicates that plant MAP2Ks with NTF domains are involved in cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking. In addition, MKK3 participates in cascades that are elicited by pathogens and are dependent on jasmonic acid (JA) signaling (40, 132). It would be interesting to test the colocalization of MKK3 and putative downstream MAPKs and to study the mechanisms of activation of JA-responsive MAPK modules at the subcellular level.

Group C, which includes MKK4 and MKK5, and group D, with the remaining MKKs 7–10 from *A. thaliana*, seem to be related to a small group of two *Physcomitrella* and two *Selaginella* MKKs. In general, all plant phyla appear to use a more limited number of MKKs compared to other MAPK components, and our

survey only uncovered a single MKK each for the algae *Chlamydomonas* and *Volvox*. This indicates that the same MAP2K may function in several different MAPK modules. Genetic analyses in *A. thaliana* indicate that closely related pairs of plant MAP2Ks have similar functions (Figure 2). For example, MKK1 and MKK2 are proposed to activate the MAPK MPK4 (115), whereas MKK4 and MKK5 act upstream of MPK3 and MPK6, apparently in a redundant manner (5). The mechanism(s) that enables the specificity of these interactions remains unknown, as discussed below.

**MAPKs**

Plants MAPKs (also called MPKs) have TDY or TEY phosphorylation motifs in their activation loops, similar to animal ERK kinases. Thus far, we have not found an annotated plant MAPK with a TGY, similar to animal p38 and yeast Hog1, or a TPY, similar to JNK MAPKs (53). Notably, in our survey, we included kinases related to *A. thaliana* male germ cell-associated kinase (MAK; 101), which contains a TxY domain and consensus MAPK-related sequences in its catalytic domain. The *Chlamydomonas* CrLF4 homolog of *A. thaliana* MAK regulates flagellar length and phosphorylates the MAPK substrate MBP in vitro (11). The CrLF4 homolog from *Caenorhabditis elegans* may have similar functions in cilia length and morphology due to its effects on cilial kinesin motors (22). In line with the roles of kinesins in flagellar, ciliary, and spindle body functions, plant

MAKs may function in meiotic cell division and maturation of male germ cells (127). Within this kinase subfamily, MAK has a TY motif that is characteristic of CDC2/CDK2 family cell-cycle regulators, although plant MAK proteins also have a TxY, similar to MAPKs (96). However, functional studies that place MAK proteins in a MAPK module are required to demonstrate that MAK kinases are a separate branch of the MAPK family.

A. thaliana MPKs have been divided into four groups (A–D; 53). TEY MAPKs constitute groups A, B, and C; whereas group D contains TDY MAPKs. Group A includes *A. thaliana* MPK3 and MPK6, and their orthologs that have been studied in tobacco, *Medicago sativa* (alfalfa), rice, and poplar. These MAPKs are involved in developmental processes and are activated in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (73, 125, 151). There are no apparent direct homologs in group A from the early land plants *Selaginella* and *Physcomitrella*. MAPKs in group B are related to *A. thaliana* MPK4, which is implicated in pathogen defense and abiotic stress responses (4, 19, 41, 111, 114). A characteristic of most group D MAPKs is a C-terminal common docking domain that may act as a docking site for MAP2Ks (148). From our survey of annotated MAPKs, plant MAPKs may be derived from ERK-related lineages and early land plants likely adapted to new environments with a set of 8 to 10 MAPKs. The current sequence annotation is 8 MAPKs each for the algae *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* and *Volvox carteri* and 10 MPKs each for *Physcomitrella* and *Selaginella*.

A comparative review of monocot and eudicot MAPKs (54) suggested the need for a unified nomenclature to distinguish orthologs and paralogs in *A. thaliana*, rice, and poplar. Twenty-one MAPK gene models were identified for poplar, close to the twenty known from *A. thaliana*, whereas rice appears to have only fifteen MAPKs with more numerous splicing variants. Transcriptional studies suggest that such variants are the products of recent genomic duplications, which can show striking differential expression at the tissue and organ

levels. This suggests a rapid evolution of specialized functions among plant MAPKs (54).

### SIGNALING IN PLANT IMMUNITY

Innate immune systems in plants include two defensive layers against microbial pathogens (67). The first layer is comprised of transmembrane receptors, called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate defense responses that include the reprogramming of host gene expression and the production of antimicrobial compounds. This defense layer is referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Examples of PAMPs are the bacterial elicitors flagellin (flg22), harpin, and lipopolysaccharides, and the fungal molecules chitin and ergosterol. A recent review details the known mechanisms of PTI, as well as the cellular responses downstream of PRRs (17). To circumvent PTI, pathogens may deliver effector proteins into host cells to suppress the activities of PTI signaling components. Plants have countered this by evolving mechanisms to detect microbial effectors via immune receptors, called resistance (R) proteins, that trigger forms of localized host cell death called the hypersensitive response (HR). This defense layer is referred to as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Multiple studies support central roles for MAPK cascades in pathogen defenses in *A. thaliana*, parsley, tobacco, rice, and tomato (26, 38, 50, 151).

#### PAMP-Triggered Immunity

One of the best-characterized plant PRRs, the *A. thaliana* flg22 receptor FLS2, is a highly conserved leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK). Recent studies have shown that elicited FLS2 complexes with BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE (BAK1) trigger MAPK signaling cascades (32). Earlier investigations of the downstream responses to the flg22 elicitor in protoplasts and leaves determined that the constitutively active

catalytic domain of MEKK1 (ΔMEKK1, from
which the putative N-terminal regulatory
domain was removed) activated MKK4 and
MKK5 as part of a cascade that activates MPK3
and MPK6 (5). In contrast, genetic studies
have proposed an MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4
cascade. Evidence for this cascade comes from
the interactions between these proteins in
yeast and in vitro (62) and from the related
phenotypes of loss-of-function *mekk1* and
*mpk4* mutants and the *mkk1 mkk2* double
mutant (61, 114, 130). This cascade negatively
regulates a set of defense responses because the
loss of function of either MEKK1 or MPK4
prompts the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA)
and the expression of pathogenesis-related
(PR) genes. Thus, loss of this MAPK module
produces paranoid, dwarfed plants, such as the
*A. thaliana* single *mekk1*, *mpk4*, and double
*mkk1 mkk2* (61, 111, 114, 130). Despite the
crucial role of the MEKK1 in SA-mediated im-
mune responses and its putative involvement in
the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
homeostasis (104), MEKK1 may not interact
with FLS2/BAK1 directly. We need to identify
putative signaling intermediates that are
upstream of such MAP3Ks to link membrane
and cell wall receptors to MAPK cascades.

Downstream targets of the MEKK1-
MKK1/2-MPK4 cascade have been described
(4, 114). These studies have led to a pro-
posed mechanism by which MPK4, activated
in response to the flg22 peptide of flagellin
and probably other PAMPs, controls gene ex-
pression and defense responses such as the
synthesis of the antibacterial phytoalexin ca-
malexin. A complex that includes MPK4, its nu-
clear substrate MAP KINASE SUBSTRATE 1
(MKS1), and the transcription factor WRKY33
regulated the expression of the camalexin
biosynthetic enzyme PHYTOALEXIN DE-
FICIENT 3 (PAD3). Transcriptome profiling
and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
showed that, upon pathogen inoculation or
flg22 treatment, WRKY33 is released from
a complex with MPK4, MKS1, or both, and
then binds to and activates the transcription of

the PAD3 promoter. This mechanism does not
follow the canonical mode of action of other
ERK-like kinases, but it concurs with genetic
evidence, which indicates that MPK4 is a nega-
tive regulator of defense responses. Such regu-
lation is accomplished via the release of a down-
stream MAPK effector protein, in this case the
transcription factor WRKY33, in response to
the activation of the MAPK MPK4.

MPK3 and MPK6 are also activated when
*A. thaliana* seedlings are treated with flg22 but
independently of MEKK1 (61, 130). Constitu-
tively active forms of MKK4 and MKK5 ac-
tivate MPK3 and MPK6, which leads to the
transcriptional activation of *flg22-INDUCED
RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1(FRK1)* and tran-
scription factors *WRKY22* and *WRKY29* (5).
Hence, a parallel cascade seems to be acti-
vated downstream of PAMP perception, which
includes MKK4/5-MPK3/6 (Figure 2). The
interplay between the positive regulation of de-
fense responses via MPK3/6 and the negative
regulation via MPK4 likely enables the tight
control of defense responses to promote or re-
strict growth and make appropriate death versus
survival decisions.

**Effector-Triggered Immunity**

Evidence that ETI and *R* gene signaling
involves MAPK cascades came from studies
in tobacco and tomato initially. The activation
of wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK) and
salicylic acid–induced protein kinase (SIPK)
is caused by an inoculation with tobacco
mosaic virus (TMV) in plants that express the
N-resistance gene (150). These MAPKs are
also activated in the presence of the fungal
Avr9 effector in tobacco cells that expresses
the Cf-9 resistance gene (118). Separate
studies have implicated the tomato MAP3K
MAPKKKa in the Pto-mediated HR response.
The silencing of MAPKKKa inhibits HR in
resistant tomato plants, and the overexpression
of this MAP3K promotes the development
of HR lesions (38). Furthermore, two MAPK
modules, MEK1-NTF6 and MEK2-SIPK,
were proposed to participate downstream of  
the Pto resistance gene (44). However, we need  
evidence for direct protein interactions and the  
identification of MAPK target substrates to  
understand how these MAPK modules mediate  
AvrPto-Pto responses.  

Pathogens override plant defense responses  
with a mechanism that suppresses MAPK acti-  
vation with pathogen effectors (17). For exam-  
ple, bacterial pathogens of plants and animals  
employ the HopAI1 effector, whose unique  
phosphothreonine lyase activity dephosphory-  
lates MAPKs (84). MPK3 and MPK6 were inac-  
tivated by HopAI1, which led to the suppression  
of PAMP-induced genes and callose deposition  
that is normally triggered to reinforce host cell  
walls (58). Another early response suppressed  
by HopAI1 is the accumulation of H₂O₂ as part  
of the oxidative burst. We do not know whether  
the phosphothreonine lyase activity of HopAI1  
is specific to MPK3 and 6, or whether HopAI1  
can also inactivate MPK4. This MAPK is also  
activated upon flagellin elicitation, and MPK4  
is involved in the regulation of the oxidative  
burst and callose deposition (109).  

Recurring reports on the prevalence of  
A. thaliana MPKs 3, 4, and 6 in response to  
pathogens have overshadowed the roles of the  
remaining 17 MAPKs. Nonetheless, recent  
studies on MKK3 unveiled new interactions  
with the group C MPKs 1, 2, 7, and 14. Studies  
with mutant plants and protoplast expression  
analyses found that MKK3 interacts with these  
four MPKs (40). In particular, MPK7 was a  
preferential substrate of MKK3 in the presence  
of H₂O₂, and the MKK3-MPK7 module  
positively regulated PR1 expression, albeit in-  
dependently of flg22 elicitation. *mkk3* mutant  
lines were more susceptible to *Pseudomonas*  
*syringae* (DC3000), and bacteria grew more  
slowly in plants that overexpress MKK3. MKK3  
and MPK7 mRNAs accumulated upon bacterial  
infection, and global analysis of gene expression  
in the *mkk3* mutant supported the involvement  
of these kinases in pathogen responses. Al-  
though this evidence links the MKK3-MPK7  
module to defense signaling, it functions  

independently of PAMP induction. This  
module may be part of a secondary response  
promoted by the oxidative burst, which is not  
an exclusive phenomenon during pathogen  
attack. To support this idea, other studies have  
described the expression of these two MAPK  
signaling components during senescence and  
JA-mediated developmental processes (132).  

An ingenious example of an opportunistic  
interaction between bacteria and plants that  
involves MAPK components is a hitch-hiking  
mechanism used by *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*,  
the causative agent of crown gall blight. Bac-  
terial invasion triggers the activation of MPKs  
3, 4, and 6. A substrate of MPK3, the bZIP  
transcription factor VirE1-Interacting Protein  
1 (VIP1), then translocates to the nucleus.  
*Agrobacterium* therefore uses the itinerant VIP1  
protein to shuttle its transfer DNA (T-DNA)  
into the host nucleus (39). This mechanism  
also involves the upregulation of the PR1  
gene, but we do not know if this is a direct or  
indirect effect of VIP1. We should investigate  
how *Agrobacterium* attenuates innate immune  
responses because *Agrobacterium* invasion  
results in the activation of several defense-  
related MAPKs without eliciting a resistance to  
*Agrobacterium* transformation or colonization.  

### ABIOTIC STRESS RESPONSES  

In some ways, analyses of plant responses to abi-  
otic stresses are simpler than studies of biotic or  
host-pathogen responses because it is relatively  
simple to apply an abiotic stress. Nonetheless,  
abiotic studies are often less mechanistically re-  
vealing because they lack the tools provided  
by an understanding of the genetics of the bi-  
otic stressor or pathogen. In addition, although  
responses to abiotic stresses such as heat ver-  
sus cold or drought versus salinity are related,  
their mechanistic relationships to more general  
metabolic fluxes, which include redox poten-  
tials, reactive oxygen species, and calcium lev-  
els, can be difficult to disentangle (117). These  
strengths and caveats are apparent in studies  
that implicate MAPK cascades in regulating  
responses to environmental cues posed by abiotic stresses.

# Water, Salt, Cold, and Osmotic Stress

Stressor-specific induction of MAPK genes and increased MAPK kinase activity have been detected when plants are subjected to touch, cold, salinity, genotoxic agents, UV irradiation, ozone, and oxidative stress (98). An *A. thaliana* cascade that responds to salt, drought, and cold may include the components MEKK1, MKK2, MPK4, and/or MPK6 (137). Initially, this work showed that whereas *mkk2* mutants had reduced tolerance to salinity, transgenic lines that overexpress MKK2 exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt and cold. Directed yeast two hybrids indicated that the catalytic domain of MEKK1 (ΔMEKK1), from which the presumed N-terminal regulatory domain had been removed, interacted with and activated MKK2 in vitro (62). Further, two hybrid experiments (137) showed that MKK2 interacts strongly with MPK4 and MPK6 and weakly with MPK5. The co-expression of MKK2 and N-terminally truncated ΔMEKK1 led to the activation of MPK4 and MPK6, which confirms that deregulated MEKK1 can activate MPK4 and MPK6. Nevertheless, the removal of the MEKK1 regulatory domain may have compromised the specificity of its interaction(s) with MKK2 and other MAP2Ks. For example, two close homologs of MEKK1, MEKK2, and MEKK3 share 85% identity in their catalytic domains (53). Therefore, more rigorous data are needed to demonstrate that MEKK1 is the specific MAP3K upstream of the MPK4 and/or MPK6 cascade(s) in response to cold and salt. Future studies should also assess if the activation of MPK4 and/or MPK6 is a response to dehydration or osmotic stress caused by elevated salinity and cold.

# Ozone and Reactive Oxygen Species

Exposure to harmful levels of ozone elicits MAP kinase cascades in tobacco. Ozone treatment also triggers the accumulation of H₂O₂, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals that ultimately cause an oxidative burst in cells (120). Furthermore, responses to ozone are comparable to those caused by the application of H₂O₂, or of a superoxide-generating system that is known to strongly activate the MAPK SIPK in cell cultures and in tobacco plants. Interestingly, such MAPK activation appears to be mediated by Ca²⁺ signaling because Ca²⁺ channel blockers can inhibit ozone- or H₂O₂-mediated SIPK activation. In *A. thaliana*, MPK3 and MPK6 (SIPK orthologs) are activated by ozone treatments, and plants that lack these kinases are hypersensitive to ozone (95). These findings indicate that ROS homeostasis is regulated via several signaling pathways.

Plants also overcome oxidative stress with the production of scavenger enzymes such as catalases, which decompose H₂O₂. For example, *A. thaliana* CAT1 is regulated by ABA, and Xing et al. (153) found that the MAP2K inhibitor PD98059 hindered ABA-mediated CAT1 expression. In addition, the *A. thaliana* *mkk1* and *mpk6* mutants were altered in their responses to ABA and desiccation stress. These results, together with the lack of ABA-mediated activation of MPK6 in *mkk1* mutants, suggested that MKK1-MPK6 regulate H₂O₂ metabolism through CAT1 (146). The closely related CAT2 enzyme accumulates in green tissues preferentially, and its levels decrease at the onset of senescence. In contrast with CAT1, CAT2 expression seems to be regulated by MEKK1 and MPK4 (112), which are involved in plant defense and SA accumulation, as described above.

The MEKK1-MPK4 cascade is also an essential component in ROS metabolism (104). The *mekk1* mutant showed an accumulation of H₂O₂ detected by DAB staining, and this mutant dies at early developmental stages. MEKK1 is activated in the presence of H₂O₂ in protoplasts, and MEKK1 may be specifically required for the activation of MPK4 by H₂O₂. Consistent with this, *mpk4* mutants also accumulate H₂O₂, suggesting that MPK4 may induce or stabilize CAT2 activity. Interestingly, levels of MEKK1 protein increase in response to H₂O₂ (104), which may indicate that MEKK1-MPK4 are part of a feedback loop that regulates

Abiotic stressors cause the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells. MAPK cascades respond to the resulting oxidative burst and may regulate ROS accumulation. Such activation of MAPK components may be mediated by hormone-related pathways. The kinase modules depicted are supported by biochemical and in planta analyses in *A. thaliana*.

and responds to ROS levels. In addition, other MAP3Ks are activated in *A. thaliana* protoplasts by H₂O₂ that include ANP1, which may cause the downstream activation of MPK3 and MPK6 (76). These findings imply that multiple MAPK modules mediate oxidative stress responses and that MAP kinase cascades are not only induced by ROS but may also regulate ROS levels by affecting catalase activity, as illustrated in Figure 3.

Notably, ROS homeostasis is a convergence point that indicates plant stress status because oxidative stress is a common response to biotic and abiotic stress. A recent review compiled ROS-mediated MAPK signaling literature (112). The continued examination of available *A. thaliana* mutants and other in planta studies of stress-specific protein interactions will help dissect the roles of MAPK modules. An important issue that has emerged in this field is how cellular redox status determines cell growth and differentiation and, thus, development. As discussed below, MAPK signaling appears to play major roles in these processes.

### SIGNALING IN PLANT DEVELOPMENT

Cellular differentiation and developmental processes in plants, similar to those of other eukaryotes, may be seen as architectural additions built on the foundations of the cell cycle. MAPK cascades from yeasts to mammals are involved in integrating stress-response and cell-cycle checkpoint pathways (110), and they regulate simple forms of yeast cell differentiation in the switch from normal to invasive growth (31). Metazoan MAPK cascades also affect patterning by homeotic regulator proteins (70). Nonetheless, the relative importance of cell-cycle regulation in plant development (63) is consistent with elegant studies that implicate MAPK cascades in the regulation of the cell cycle and differentiation.

### Cytokinesis and Cell Differentiation

The specific activation of plant MAPKs is coordinated with specific stages during cell division. For example, alfalfa MMK3 and tobacco

Ntf6 localize to the plane of cell division and become activated during mitosis (16, 24). In animals, MAPKs regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins or MAPs (134, 140). Sasabe et al. made similar observations in tobacco BY2 cells recently (122). This work showed that the MAPK NRK1/Ntf6 phosphorylated the microtubule-associated protein NtMAP65-1a, which facilitates its disassembly from the phragmoplast and thereby allows the formation of the cell plate. MAPK cascade components upstream of NRK1 have also been identified: the MAP2K NQK1/MEK2 and upstream MAP3K NPK1 (25, 106).

The expression of *NPK1* and of the *A. thaliana* orthologs *ANP1*, *2*, and *3* is high in tissues that are rich in dividing cells (105), and functional genomic studies of the *anpA. thaliana* mutants indicated redundant functions for these related MAP3Ks (78). Although *A. thaliana* plants that lack all ANP proteins are inviable, double *anp2 anp3* mutants are stunted with defective cytokinesis, double *anp1 anp3* mutants have defects in floral organs but reach normal size, and *anp1 anp2* mutants appear to have wild-type growth. Notably, microscopy of *anp2 anp3* mutants detected the presence of cell wall stubs, which implies that misregulation of this MAPK cascade precludes proper phragmoplast assembly and disassembly, similar to tobacco cells that are defective in the NPK1 pathway. Furthermore, the kinesin-like proteins (KLP) HINKEL/NACK1 and TETRASPORE/NACK2 interact and activate the NPK1 cascade, which indicates that these kinases play roles in the regulation of cytokinesis (64).

*A. thaliana yoda* MAP3K mutants exhibit abnormal early embryo development and fail to differentiate an extraembryonic suspensor owing to a faulty asymmetric cell division (9). Surviving plants become severely dwarfed with compact leaves and are sterile. Recent analysis of the same mutants revealed that a lack of YODA (YDA) protein also compromises stomatal cell specification (10). Thus, loss-of-function *yda* mutants accumulate

many stomata, whereas plants that express an N-terminal deleted YDA (∆N-YDA) lack guard cells. Evidence was provided subsequently that the MAP2Ks MKK4/5 and the MAPKs MPK3/6 function downstream of YODA (143). The embryo lethality of double mutants (either *mkk4 mkk5* or *mpk3 mpk6*) was overcome using systems to obtain partially rescued *mpk3⁻/⁻mpk6⁻/⁻* plants by a dexamethasone-inducible system or by combining *MKK4-* and *MKK5-RNAi* plants (143). In both cases, the resulting seedlings presented only clustered stomatal patterning, which indicates that the coordinated cell fate specification of stomata versus pavement cells was disrupted. Significantly, plants that express constitutively active (phosphomimetic) *MKK4* or *MKK5* failed to exhibit stomatal differentiation similar to plants that express ∆N-YDA. Additional epistasis analyses supported the YODA-MKK4/5-MPK3/MPK6 cascade as a regulator of asymmetric cell division that provides cell fate specification in stomata.

More recently, a target of MPK3 and MPK6 in the YODA cascade(s) was found; the bHLH transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH) which contains a MAPK phosphorylation domain (79). Loss-of-function *spch* mutants are unable to produce stomata, and genetic analysis showed that *spch* is epistatic to *yda* (87). In agreement with these data, MAPK phosphorylation on multiple sites of a SPCH domain may quantitatively target this transcription factor for degradation. However, there is also one SPCH residue targeted by MPK6 that may act as a positive regulator of SPCH activity and stability when phosphorylated. Such a complex regulatory domain in SPCH implies the ability to fine tune responses according to input signals for the multifunctional YODA-MKK4/5-MPK3/6 cascade(s). The leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RLK) ERECTA (ER) and TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) are upstream candidates to activate this cascade because they are known to negatively regulate stomatal promoting factors (79). Furthermore, an IRAK/Pelle-like kinase encoded by a paternal mRNA called Short Suspensor has recently been shown
to activate the YODA pathway in zygotes (9).

Positive regulators of stomatal lineage may function downstream of this MAPK cascade and include the bHLH transcription factors MUTE and FAMA that are related to SPCH (68, 107). Furthermore, the ICE1 SCREAM1/SCREAM2 bHLH-LZ complex binds these bHLH factors to regulate progression toward stomatal cell specification (68). Clearly, as more downstream effectors of MAPK cascades are identified, we can begin to understand how the perception of environmental stresses determines intracellular responses in plant development.

MPK3 and MPK6 also perform roles in ovule development in a dosage-dependent manner (142). Moreover, loss-of-function and kinase-inactive versions of MPK6 have demonstrated its roles in floral organ and embryo development independently of MPK3 (23). Because they are implicated in many signaling functions, it will be critical for future investigations of MPK3 and 6 to sort out how signaling specificity is achieved.

**Senescence**

An important developmental pathway in plants is senescence, which involves the orderly breakdown of cellular constituents in aging leaves for export to other regions of the plant. The *A. thaliana* MAP3K MEKK1 may be involved in the regulation of senescence, in part by direct transcriptional regulation of key transcription factors. A yeast-one-hybrid screen baited with promoter sequences of the senescence-induced WRKY53 transcription factor identified MEKK1 (94). In vitro experiments confirmed that MEKK1 binds a specific region in the WRKY53 promoter and can phosphorylate the WRKY53 protein. Protoplast expression determined that the WRKY53 promoter region bound by MEKK1 is important for the H₂O₂-mediated induction of WRKY53 mRNA. Transient expression analysis and bimolecular fluorescence complementation provided further evidence of the MEKK1-WRKY53 interaction. These remarkable findings plead for analyses to determine the specificity of this MEKK1-WRKY53 interaction in planta, and epistatic analysis should be conducted with *mekk1* and *wrky53* mutants. In addition, the interaction of these proteins could be demonstrated in nuclear extracts from tissues in which senescence is developmentally triggered or induced by H₂O₂ treatment.

Other work indicates that *A. thaliana* MKK9-MPK6 are also involved in leaf senescence (153). MKK9 can interact with and phosphorylate MPK6 in vitro and in protoplasts, and *mpk6* or *mkk9* mutations cause delayed senescence in detached leaves. In addition, the overexpression of *MKK9* causes precocious senescence and the accumulation of senescence-related marker genes that can be partially suppressed by an *mpk6* mutation. Nevertheless, the activation of MKK9 is also prompted by wounding and oxidizing agents. Therefore, evidence to support a specific role for an MKK9-MPK6 cascade in senescence comes mainly from their loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes. A cascade that involves MKK9-MPK3/6 also participates in ethylene signaling (153), which broadens the reach of this cascade to other processes related to senescence.

**MAPK CASCADES AND HORMONES**

Plant hormones mediate stress responses and developmental pathways together with other signaling molecules (52, 121). Nonetheless, there are few, if any, examples of precise functions, partners, or effectors of MAPK cascade components in signal transduction elicited by a phytohormone receptor directly. In contrast, several examples discussed below implicate kinases in hormone signaling, in mediating synergistic or antagonistic effects between different hormones, and in the regulation of phytohormone synthesis.

**Ethylene**

Ethylene is a key regulator of plant cell stress status. The RAF-like MAP3K CTR1 is
involved in ethylene signaling and can interact with the ETR1 ethylene receptor (60, 72). Downstream positive regulators of ethylene signaling include ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2) and the EIN3 transcription factor (2, 30). The application of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) causes the activation of MPK3 and 6, and EIN3 seems to interact with MPK6. A recent model added MKK9 to such a pathway (148). This work mainly used protoplasts and phosphorylation mutants to ascertain that EIN3 integrity can be modulated via different phosphorylation sites. In the presence of ethylene, CTR1 activity is blocked, and MKK9-MPK3/6 are active and phosphorylate EIN3 to stabilize it. In contrast, a lack of ethylene prompts CTR1 to block MKK9 activity, and other MAPKs are free to phosphorylate EIN3 on a site that promotes EIN3 degradation. Although elegant, this model would benefit from studies that demonstrate direct in planta interactions between CTR1 and MKK9 or MKK9 and MPK6/3.

An independent study (147) demonstrated that MKK9 autophosphorylates in vitro and provided support for a functional MKK9-MPK6/3 module. This study also compared measurements of ethylene gas and the antimicrobial phytoalexin camalexin in *mkk9*, and in plants that express constitutively active and kinase inactive MKK9 forms, to demonstrate that MKK9 is involved in the synthesis of ethylene and camalexin. Additional complexity within the ethylene signaling network comes from the important evidence that ethylene synthesis requires activation and stabilization of the MPK6 substrates ACC synthases 2 and 6 (ACS2/6; 85). A recent report (12) supports these findings and proposes other modes of MPK6 regulation via release of ethylene-related transcription factors in the nucleus. This work also shows that ethylene production is downstream of MPK6 as a rapid response to flg22. Several kinases are activated by PAMPs, but it is difficult to disentangle primary from secondary activation events. Thus, our understanding of the functions of specific kinases in hormone signaling in terms

of cause versus effect remains quite limited (43).

## Auxin and ABA

Researchers discovered the connections between hormonal effects and MAPK signaling with transient expression analyses in maize protoplasts. These experiments showed that the expression of the tobacco MAP3K NPK1 was sufficient to repress GH3 and ER7 auxin-responsive promoter systems (77). NPK1 expression also stimulated the activation of a MAPK cascade in mesophyll protoplasts. In addition, the expression of the MAPK-specific phosphatase MKP1 halted the repression of the auxin response reporter systems. Interestingly, the overexpression of the NPK1 kinase domain in tobacco resulted in embryo lethality in most cases, although a few surviving plants had increased expression of the NPK1 construct but reduced levels of the truncated protein.

As noted above, *A. thaliana* has three NPK1 orthologs, the ANP MAP3Ks. ANP1 is activated by H₂O₂ in protoplasts, and constitutively active ΔN-ANP1 activated MPK3 and MPK6 (76). The activation of this cascade negatively regulates early auxin responses, which confirms the previous findings in maize protoplasts. Transgenic tobacco with ectopic expression of the constitutively active form of NPK1 grows as wild type and was more resistant to salt, cold, and heat exposure than wild type. An explanation for these phenotypes is that the constitutive activation of ANP1 promotes oxidative stress and consequent expression of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) detoxifying enzymes and heat shock protein (HSP) chaperones in preparation for further stress. These results suggest that ANP1 antagonizes auxin's promotion of cell-cycle progression and growth pathways as a stress-protective mechanism.

Researchers used an *A. thaliana* root system to evaluate the effects of auxin on MAPK activation (99). Using natural and synthetic auxins (IAA, NAA, and 2,4-D), MAPK activation was rapid with a 5-min peak. The application of noncompetitive and competitive inhibitors
of MAP2K phosphorylation (U0126 and PD098059) hindered the expression of auxin-inducible reporter constructs, which confirmed the activation of an auxin-responsive MAPK cascade in roots. In addition, pretreatment with the competitive inhibitor (PD098059) indicated that another MAPK cascade functioned to negatively regulate auxin-related responses independently of auxin treatment (99).

A recent study found that *A. thaliana* MPK12 interacts with the MPK phosphatase INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC RESPONSE 5 (IBR5) directly (81). *ibr5* mutants exhibit faulty responses to auxin and ABA, whereas the reduction of *MPK12* expression results in increased auxin sensitivity in root growth inhibition assays. Furthermore, the silencing of *MPK12* in the *ibr5* background rescues the reduced *ibr5* auxin sensitivity partially but does not modify its ABA-related phenotype. Despite the specificity of the MPK12-IBR5 kinase-phosphatase interaction, they may only function together in specific physiological contexts. MPK12 and IBR5 colocalize in nuclei in young tissues, but MPK12 appears to accumulate alone in guard cells of mature plants predominantly. Notably, these studies implicate a novel negative regulator (MPK12) of auxin signaling that is different from the usual suspects (MPK3 or MPK6) in the MAPK landscape.

Genetic studies implicate *A. thaliana* MKK7 in polar auxin transport (PAT). Activation-tagged *bud1* mutants have increased *MKK7* expression, as well as fewer lateral roots and modified gravitropic responses, among other defective auxin transport phenotypes (36). Tracer assays with labeled IAA revealed defective auxin transport, which implicates MKK7 as a negative regulator of PAT. Intriguingly, MKK7 and its close homolog MKK9 belong to the MAP2K group D, whose members carry an aspartic acid residue in one of the conserved phosphorylation sites. This suggests that these kinases can autoactivate (26). More recently, *bud1* mutant overexpression of MKK7 resulted in the overexpression of SA-responsive PR genes and exhibited constitutive defense responses, similar to those in plants with systemic

acquired resistance (SAR; 152). In addition, the enhanced expression of MKK7 was elicited by avirulent *Pseudomonas* in vascular tissues specifically, which implicates MKK7 in systemic signaling.

### Salicylic and Jasmonic Acids

The role of salicylic acid (SA) as a defense signal molecule is widely recognized. More than a decade ago, researchers showed that SA induces the transient activation of MAPKs in tobacco suspension cells, a finding that coined the term SA-induced protein kinase (SIPK; 149). Later experiments with *A. thaliana* roots confirmed that MAPK phosphorylation is directly correlated with SA application (99). The *A. thaliana* ortholog of SIPK is MPK6, which together with wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK) or its *A. thaliana* ortholog MPK3, appears to balance the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) or SA in response to mechanical or herbivore-induced wounding (125). The enhanced expression of WIPK results in increased JA, although contrasting results suggest that the activation of WIPK and SIPK, either via constitutively active tobacco MEK2 or diterpenoid treatment, does not result in JA overproduction (65, 126). One explanation is that, in addition to WIPK and SIPK, other MAPK cascades are involved in regulating JA or SA biosynthesis and responses.

MPK6, but not MPK4, is specifically activated by JA (132). Microarray analysis also implicated MKK3 in JA signaling, and transgenics that express an inducible or constitutively active MKK3 revealed specific activation of MPK6 in response to JA. This MKK3/MPK6 module was proposed to negatively regulate the *MYC2/JASMONATE INSENSITIVE1* gene and to positively regulate the *LOX2, VSP1*, and *PDF1.2* disease response genes. However, another study has reported that this model could not be confirmed in planta. Instead, this work proposed that MKK3 would interact and activate MAPKs in phylogenetic group C, which includes MPKs 1, 2, 14, and notably MPK7 in response to H₂O₂ (40). In turn, MPK1 and MPK2 are activated by ABA and H₂O₂, andtheir activation is also a late JA and wounding response (108). In addition, colocalization in vascular tissues implies that these MAPKs act in the vasculature specifically (40). Although this may link them to systemic responses, further study is needed to determine the precise roles of these kinases in vascular cells.

As noted above, mutants in the MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4 cascade accumulate SA and result in dwarfed plants that can be partially rescued by the expression of the bacterial salicylate hydroxylase *nahG* that converts SA into catechol (111, 130). Genetic and biochemical studies of these cascade components indicate that MPK4 modulates JA- and ethylene-related responses (19, 111). In other hormone pairs, the mutual effects of SA and JA signaling may depend on their relative concentrations. Lower concentrations appear to incite synergistic effects, which become antagonistic at higher dosage differences, similar to *mekk1* or *mpk4* mutants with increased SA and the reduced expression of JA-inducible marker genes such as *PDF1.2* (19, 61). Thus, the MEKK1-MPK4 module is currently considered a switch to balance SA/JA hormone signaling.

As our knowledge of the functions of MKKs accumulates, we need to study the genetic interactions among available MAP2K mutants, especially between autoactive *mkk9* and *mkk7*, and between *mkk4* and *mkk5* that share some of the same MAPK substrates. As seen above, modes of hormone signaling modulation are emerging and MAPK modules are recognized as nodal points in many instances. Further efforts should include systematic observations of MAPK signaling regulation at the organ and tissue level in specific environmental or developmental contexts.

### SIGNAL SPECIFICITY

Many examples of functionally overlapping components in MAPK signaling modules have been noted in preceding sections of this review (Table 1). For example, some studies document the interactions of several *A. thaliana* MAP2Ks

(MKK2 and MKK9) with the MAPKs MPK3 and MPK6 (5, 113, 132, 153). The points of signal convergence may be MAP2Ks in some cases because of their abilities to activate more than one MAPK (26) and because there are fewer MAP2Ks than MAP3Ks or MAPKs in the major model *A. thaliana*. Although sharing components may enable cells to integrate various signals, such integration must limit erroneous cross-activation and subsequent loss of specificity (89, 102). In general, specificity can be maintained by the dynamics of protein-protein interactions and by spatio-temporal restraints, which include cell type specificity and subcellular compartmentation.

#### Kinase Interactions and Scaffolds

Docking domains are major determinants of the specificity of interactions between MAP2Ks and MAPKs (7, 8, 100). For example, a study of yeast Fus3 and Hog1 MAPK chimeras with combinations of core and surface structural motifs confirmed the importance of docking domains in specific interactions. This work also revealed that few changes are required in the surface residues that differentiate paralog MAPKs to generate a new interaction and function. This may explain the evolutionary expansion of MAPK families as the kinases find new partners and acquire new specificities (100). The selectivity of docking interactions has been investigated by the mutation of a regulatory motif near the N-termini of MAP2Ks called the D-site (7, 8). These data indicate that there is flexibility in the MAP2K’s D-site-mediated recognition of substrates and that MAP2K catalytic domains share part of this task. To illustrate the relevance of D-site directed inhibition to block MAPK signaling, protease cleavage of MAP2K D-sites is used by the Anthrax-causing *Bacillus* to hinder the human immune response (6). D-sites can also be predicted as they have a known consensus sequence but there are no published data on their function in plants.

As noted in the first section, three yeast MAPK pathways share components while

maintaining their specificity. Three mechanisms to achieve specificity and fidelity are known: cross-inhibition, feedback control, and scaffolding (154). An example of cross-inhibition is the mutual inhibition between hyperosmotic and pheromone pathways, a mechanism that relies on direct or indirect interactions between the MAPKs Fus3 and Hog1. Interestingly, individual yeast cells in a population that receive both stimuli (hyperosmotic and pheromone) simultaneously would respond independently with the activation of either cascade in a switch-like mode. The response of a single cell probably relates to its condition and history and to the signal threshold (89). An example of feedback control is the regulation of the Sho1 membrane-bound receptor that activates the MAP3K Ste11 in the Hog1 cascade. Sho1 can be phosphorylated by Hog1, which inactivates Sho1 in a negative feedback loop that attenuates Hog1 signaling (154).

Scaffold proteins bring MAPK components together to enhance specificity and accelerate their activation and reaction rates. For example, yeast Ste5 interacts with an upstream G-protein and with all three components of the MAPK cascade. Ste5 is also a dynamic component because it enhances the activation of other components. For example, Ste5 promotes Fus3 MAPK autophosphorylation to down-regulate the pathway signal allosterically (13).

Scaffolding proteins in animal MAPK cascades also regulate the spatio-temporal interactions of the same kinases in different cascades (20). In plants, a putative scaffolding function was revealed for alfalfa oxidative stress activated MAP triple kinase (OMTK1), which interacts in protoplasts with the MAPK MMK3 in response to H₂O₂ (103). A. thaliana MEKK1 may also act as a scaffold because of its ability to bind to MKK2 and downstream MPK4 (130). Furthermore, a kinase-inactive version of MEKK1 rescued the mekk1 mutant phenotype, which indicates that MEKK1 has kinase activity-independent functions. This may be unsurprising because the mammalian MAP3K MEKK1 can interact with JNK/SAPK or with ERK2, MEK1, and the Raf-1MAP3K to assemble ERK2 complexes (69). As discussed above, A. thaliana MEKK1 is involved in cascades with MPKs 3, 4, and 6. Further analyses of MEKK1 scaffold functions should provide an understanding of what this single MAP3K does in these cascades and how their specificity is maintained.

MAPK signaling components may assume different tasks that depend on their subcellular localization. Yeast and animal scaffold and adaptor proteins bring or tether MAPK modules to distinct locations in cells, which may vary with different types of stimuli (56). MAPKs are also often activated in the cytoplasm and then translocate to the nucleus where they

interact with substrates. Examples of differential subcellular localization of MAPK components have been reported in plants. The transient expression of constitutively active forms of MAP2Ks in *A. thaliana* protoplasts demonstrated that MKK9 is preferentially found in the nucleus where it activates MPK3 and MPK6, whereas MKK4 was seen in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it may activate MPK6 (148). MEKK1 also relocates to the nucleus to interact with the senescence-related transcription factor WRKY53 directly (94). The MAP3Ks ANPs and NPK1 are recruited to the midplate during cytokinesis (16, 106). Interestingly, these *A. thaliana* and tobacco MAP3Ks possess putative bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) in their carboxyl-terminal regions, and this NPK1 NLS is responsible for its nuclear localization during interphase (64).

Comprehensive studies that integrate predictions of MAPK-targeting motifs and microscopic localization studies could define the cell and subcellular localizations of MAPK components more accurately. Information on predicted and experimental subcellular localization is available in the SUBA database (57), and data on 96 transcriptional variants of *A. thaliana* MAPK components are summarized in Table 2. However, experimental data remains scarce. Techniques from mammalian systems could also be applied in plant cell cultures or protoplasts. For example, subcellular extracts from cell cultures have been used to profile organellar proteins and identify differential phosphorylation profiles of MAPKs in cytoplasmic versus nuclear fractions (1).

Bioinformatic efforts to organize and mine information from microarray experiments include a recent gene expression atlas for approximately 114 MAPK cascade components (91). Some of the results indicate the regulation of MAPK signaling through gene dosage and transcriptional control and also support the function of recognized MAPK cascades based on coexpression data and clustering analyses. This study also unveiled new putative MAPK modules that can be explored genetically and biochemically.

### Phosphatases

MAPK specificity can also be modulated via protein phosphatases. There are two main groups of phosphatases: the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and the serine-threonine phosphatases. Two classes of enzymes in the first group, the tyrosine-specific phosphatases (PTPs) and dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs), regulate the intensity and duration of signals through MAPK modules (86). In plants, threonine phosphorylation is necessary for the activation of *A. thaliana* MPK4, and its inactivation is mediated by PTP1 (59). The DSP MKP1 is a negative regulator of MAPKs in response to UV exposure and genotoxic stress, and *mkp1* mutants are more resistant to increased salinity in vegetative tissues (139). MKP2 was shown to inactivate MPK3 and MPK6, and silencing MKP2 rendered plants hypersensitive to oxidative stress (80). A specific interaction between *A. thaliana* MPK18 and the dual-specificity phosphatase PROPYZAMIDE HYPERSENSITIVE 1(PHS1) suggests that both act together in microtubule stabilization (141). To illustrate how these phosphatases mediate signaling with other pathways, MKP1 homologs in *A. thaliana*, tobacco, and rice bind calmodulin (CaM) to enhance the activity of these phosphatases in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner (83).

PP2C phosphatases are a subtype in the group of serine/threonine phosphatases. A putative MAPK interaction motif (KIM) is found in the N-terminal domains of some PP2Cs, and these KIMs recognize and inactivate MAPKs in other eukaryotic PTPs (123). In vitro data suggests that membrane lipids that are produced in response to wounding inhibit the MP2C PP2C, which permits the activation of MAPKs (45). MP2C preferentially inactivates the alfalfa stress-induced MAPK SIMK in a negative feedback loop in the wound signaling pathway (92). Similarly, the *A. thaliana* homolog AP2C1 inactivated MPK4 and MPK6 to regulate JA levels upon wounding, and AP2C1 may also modulate the action of these two MAPKs because AP2C1 affinity for MPK6 is enhanced after

wounding (124). Nonetheless, functional information on plant MAPK phosphatases remains limited, and more effort is needed to understand these crucial regulators. We note that the relative paucity of literature on protein phosphatases may be related to the fact that specific phosphatase assays require properly phospho-labeled substrates, whereas kinase assays generate them.

**PERSPECTIVES AND NEWER APPROACHES**

MAP kinase modules have evolved in eukaryotes as efficient modulators in signaling pathways. Basic biochemical assays and yeast mutants inspired early investigations of plant MAPK signaling that allowed the identification of homologous protein kinases. The onslaught of genomic sequences has permitted studies of the evolution of MAP kinase-mediated signaling cascades. During the past decade, functional genomics of *A. thaliana* insertion mutants has advanced our knowledge of the in vivo functions of MAPK cascade components (summarized in Table 3).

The global profiling of mutants and wild-type plants at different developmental stages after exposure to stresses is currently generating useful information. Deep sequencing and global transcriptome profiling also increase the resolution with which we can follow metabolic and physiological processes from the perspective of gene expression. Database mining is revealing candidate interaction partners and signaling modules based on co-expression. Such bioinformatic studies will help assign novel functions for differentially expressed kinases at the tissue and developmental levels (91). These putative interactions must be assessed by biochemical assays that measure strength and specificity. Some efforts have begun to confirm the predicted interactions between *A. thaliana* MAP2Ks and MAPKs (82).

Combined biochemical and genetic studies have revealed different mechanisms that *A. thaliana* MAPK modules use to transduce signals into gene expression (48). A greater enrichment of putative downstream MAPK signaling effectors and targets can be attained by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Chip-on-chip, and Chip-seq techniques in comparative studies with available mutants (114). In addition, phosphoproteomic analyses continue to confirm MAPK target proteins and propose candidate substrates (113). These studies should help us elucidate the mechanisms of feedback control used by the same signaling cascades and interactions with other cellular pathways.

As noted in the previous section on specificity, we need to characterize scaffolds and docking sites in regulatory domains. Tools used in other eukaryotes, which include specific inhibitors and systematic mutations of docking domains or phosphorylation sites, have revealed how the same components are shared by different cascades without compromising specificity. Versions of plant MAPK components, especially kinase inactives or phosphomimetics, allow the dissection of kinase activity-dependent versus structural roles of MAPK proteins. However, more emphasis should be given to constructing versions with their proper regulatory domains (15, 111, 130).

different cell types that depend on seedling growth conditions (111) (Figure 4). We should explore the mechanisms by which environmental and other cues directly affect localization of MAPKs in cells and tissues. Such approaches might help to explain the related multitasking of *A. thaliana* MPK3 and MPK6. For example, a recent yeast study used a parallel microfluidic system with high-throughput imaging to examine the dynamics of the MAPK pheromone pathway under various genetic and environmental perturbations (136).

Other modes of regulation of MAPK signaling components remain of interest. For example, studies of the proteasome-mediated degradation of the MAP3K MEKK1 indicate that levels of this protein are tightly regulated (104), as is its expression (61). In addition, transcriptional profiling revealed that MPK3 and MPK6 are differentially regulated, because the accumulation of MPK3 mRNA is tightly regulated whereas MPK6 appears to be constitutively expressed (10, 91). To complement such profiling, computational and experimental studies on putative MAPK-related targets will identify to what extent the transcriptional responses that are regulated by MAPK components are mediated by miRNAs and/or epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional control.

**SUMMARY POINTS**

1. MAPK cascades orchestrate eukaryotic signaling with the sequential, reversible phosphorylation of three types of component protein kinases: MAP3K, MAP2K, and MAPK.
2. Early studies of plant MAPK components were inspired by seminal work in yeast and mammals.
3. Families of plant MAPK components have expanded during evolution, and different combinations of components accomplish particular functions.
4. Plants MAPKs are activated by biotic and abiotic stimuli that translate into developmental and growth responses. Such processes are interconnected to other signaling molecules, such as hormones and reactive oxygen species.
5. Genetic analyses in the model plant *A. thaliana* have unveiled predominant MAPK cascades that serve as hubs to generate a primed response to environmental cues. Recent studies have uncovered additional modules that accomplish specialized functions.

6. Few MAPK substrates and downstream targets are known in plants. Two fairly well-dissected cascades regulate stomatal cell determination and disease responses in *A. thaliana*.

7. The formation and function of MAPK cascades are mediated by protein phosphatases and by protein-protein interactions that include scaffolding proteins. Relatively little is known about the functions of these important components.
