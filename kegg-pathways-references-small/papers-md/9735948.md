# Cellular mechanisms of cerebellar LTD

Hervé Daniel, Carole Levenes and Francis Crépel

In the past decade there have been advances in understanding the cellular mechanisms of the long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission at parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum. This review first summarizes current views on mechanisms involved in LTD induction, from activation of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, of ionotropic (AMPA) and metabotropic (mGluR1) glutamate receptors, to stimulation of protein kinase C and nitric oxide formation. Second, we will focus on recent findings that

in synaptic strength. Rather, its role might be to allow a recruitment of additional synapses within the pool of those exhibiting LTD following co-activation of PFs and CFs, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of this process.

### Recent findings

#### Role of $Ca^{2+}$ release from internal stores
Although $Ca^{2+}$ has been shown to play a crucial role in cerebellar LTD, the physiological significance of $Ca^{2+}$ release from internal stores is still a matter of debate. PC dend
Box I. Glutamatergic receptors involved in LTD induction

There is wide agreement that induction of cerebellar LTD requires the activation of two groups of glutamatergic receptors: ionotropic AMPA receptors and G-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors (mGluRs).

Consistent with previous *in vivo* observations<sup>a</sup>, the involvement of AMPA receptors has been demonstrated in whole-cell clamped Purkinje cells (PCs) in acute slices, as application of CNQX, a selective antagonist of this group of receptors, prevents induction of LTD of parallel fiber (PF)-mediated responses
Box 2. Involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) activation and nitric oxide (NO) formation in LTD

It is now well accepted that both PKC activation and NO formation are required cellular events leading to cerebellar LTD. In acute slices and in cultures, direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters induces LTD of the responsiveness of Purkinje cells (PCs) to exogenously applied glutamate (Glu) or quisqualate, whereas inactive analogs are without any effect ${ }^{a,b}$. Moreover in acute cerebellar slices, the potent protein kinase inhibitor, polymixin B
kinase (PKG), thereby allowing phosphorylation of its specific endogenous substrate 'G-substrate', which is a potent inhibitor of phosphatases³⁸. In keeping with this hypothesis, LTD is induced in acute slices by bath application of the protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A (Ref. 39). Finally, the conjunctive PF stimulation and depolarization required for LTD induction can be replaced by photolytic releases of NO and Ca²⁺ inside PCs, suggesting that NO release is sufficient to replace PF stimulation⁴⁰. In addition, this study with caged compounds showed that only a <1
clearly in cultured PCs that the establishment of a late phase of cerebellar LTD (beginning 30–45 min after the induction protocol) requires postsynaptic protein synthesis, as applications of transcription or translation inhibitors, immediately, but not 30 minutes after the induction protocol, attenuate this late phase⁴⁹.

Moreover, experimental protocols known to induce LTD also trigger the expression of the immediate-early genes, c-fos and jun-B, suggesting that the expression of these genes might help to establish cerebellar long-term plasticity⁵⁰,⁵¹.
