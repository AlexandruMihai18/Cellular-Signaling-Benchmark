### Summary

Enteric bacterial pathogens commonly use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to successfully infect intestinal epithelial cells and survive and proliferate in the host. Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic *Escherichia coli* (EPEC; EHEC) colonize the human intestinal mucosa, form characteristic histological lesions on the infected epithelium and require the T3SS for full virulence. T3SS effectors injected into host cells subvert cellular pathways to execute a variety of functions within infected host cells. The EPEC and EHEC effectors that subvert innate immune pathways – specifically those involved in phagocytosis, host cell survival, apoptotic cell death and inflammatory signalling – are all required to cause disease. These processes are reviewed within, with a focus on recent work that has provided insights into the functions and host cell targets of these effectors.

### Introduction

The intestinal epithelium is a crucial component of immune defence, providing a physical barrier between the body and the outside environment (Kato *et al.*, 2014). The innate immune response represents the first active line of defence against enteric pathogens, and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) coordinate this response to combat incoming pathogenic microorganisms (Mogensen, 2009). Once activated, the innate immune response mediates the control of invading pathogens, the induction of programmed cell death in infected host cells, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory compounds that recruit immune cells to sites of infection (Mogensen, 2009; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010).

Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic *Escherichia coli* (EPEC; EHEC) are Gram-negative, attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens that infect human IECs (Croxen *et al.*, 2013). Like many other enteric pathogens, they utilize a syringe-like type III secretion system (T3SS) to translocate effector proteins into host cells, which facilitate bacterial colonization, survival and immune evasion in infected hosts (Deng *et al.*, 2004; Croxen *et al.*, 2013). These effectors target host cellular signalling pathways, including those involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements, vesicle trafficking and cell survival (Croxen *et al.*, 2013). T3SS and its effectors are essential components of the A/E pathogen infection strategy, and are crucial for infection by EPEC/EHEC, the mouse pathogen *Citrobacter rodentium* and rabbit enteropathogenic *E. coli* (CR; REPEC) (Deng *et al.*, 2004).

EPEC and EHEC are able to overcome host innate immune defences via the action of T3SS-secreted effectors, which empower EPEC/EHEC to block phagocytosis and manipulate both inflammatory and cell survival pathways (Table 1). This review focuses on effectors that impact these innate immune pathways, defining host cellular targets, providing mechanistic details and describing the outcomes of effector activity. A broad overview of enteric pathogenic *E. coli* and the diseases they cause can be found elsewhere (Croxen *et al.*, 2013).

(DCs) and macrophages, use receptor-mediated interactions to recognize, internalize and degrade foreign particles and invading bacteria. In *cis*-phagocytosis, internalization is triggered by direct recognition of bacterial components, such as scavenger receptor A-mediated recognition of bacterial surface lipopolysaccharide (Peiser *et al.*, 2000). Alternatively, in *trans*-phagocytosis, bacteria are detected indirectly following opsonization with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or the complement component iC3b, which are recognized by the Fcγ and CR3 complement receptors, respectively, on phagocytic cell surfaces (Anderson *et al.*, 1990; Ross *et al.*, 1992). *Cis-* and *trans*-phagocytosis both proceed through receptor-mediated activation of intracellular signalling pathways, pseudopod extension by actin rearrangement and membrane expansion, and bacterial internalization into phagosomes (Freeman and Grinstein, 2014). Phagosome contents are subsequently degraded, destroying internalized pathogens and providing antigens with which to prime the adaptive immune system (Freeman and Grinstein, 2014).

Pathogens that are able to delay or inhibit phagocytosis have a distinct fitness advantage. Goosney *et al.* (1999) were the first to demonstrate that EPEC inhibits *cis*-phagocytosis in a T3SS-dependent, effector-mediated manner in macrophage-like RAW264.7 and J774A.1 cells. Celli *et al.* (2001) later reported that EPEC blocks *trans*-phagocytosis in a T3SS-dependent manner. Following these discoveries, four EPEC/EHEC effectors have been characterized as inhibitors of phagocytosis (Fig. 1).

EspB is a component of the T3SS translocon pore, although it also localizes to phagocytic cups in infected phagocytes and inhibits *cis*-phagocytosis (Izumi *et al.*, 2007). EspB binds to and inhibits members of the myosin superfamily, which are responsible for facilitating pseudopod extension and phagosome closure during the phagocytic process (Swanson *et al.*, 1999; Izumi *et al.*, 2007). EspB–myosin interactions are mediated by an internal myosin-binding region in EspB, which is required to prevent internalization of EPEC/EHEC by macrophages (Izumi *et al.*, 2007).

Another effector that suppresses *cis*-phagocytosis in infected phagocytes is EspF, which inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent F-actin cytoskeletal rearrangements required for phagocytosis (Celli *et al.*, 2001; Quitard *et al.*, 2006). Both the N-terminal and proline-rich repeat regions of EspF have been shown to be essential for its anti-phagocytic activity (Quitard *et al.*, 2006; Tahoun *et al.*, 2011). Proline-rich repeats share extensive homology with WASP-related proteins, which also regulate actin dynamics, indicating a potential actin regulatory role for these repeats in EspF-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis (Peralta-Ramírez *et al.*, 2008). In EPEC, EHEC and REPEC, the EspF proline-rich repeat regions have conserved sequences and positions, although the number of repeat regions varies in each pathogen and impacts the ability of EspF to inhibit phagocytosis accordingly (Peralta-Ramírez *et al.*, 2008; Tahoun *et al.*, 2011). In contrast to its anti-phagocytic role in professional phagocytes, EspF is implicated in mediating invasion into infected epithelial cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Alto *et al.*, 2007; Weflen *et al.*, 2010). Although EspF-mediated invasion of IECs does not constitute direct inhibition of innate immune function, it is a counterintuitive example of immune evasion given the role of EspF in the inhibition of phagocytosis.

Fig. 1. Modulation of phagocytosis and inflammation in phagocytes. EPEC/EHEC effectors (shown in red) inhibit phagocytosis by professional phagocytes by disrupting signalling events and inhibiting cytoskeletal reorganization. In EPEC and EHEC, EspB and EspF prevent *cis*-phagocytosis. To inhibit internalization, EspB binds myosin, preventing myosin–actin interaction, while EspF inhibits phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated F-actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. EspJ inhibits *trans*-phagocytosis, preventing internalization induced by either Fcγ or CR3 receptor activation by their respective opsonins, IgG and iC3b. EspH inhibits both *cis* and *trans*-phagocytosis by inhibiting RhoGEF activation of Rho GTPases, which facilitate actin reorganization required for phagocytosis. EspT is a bacterial RhoGEF that activates Rac1, an inducer of inflammatory signalling.

In contrast to EspF and EspB, EspJ inhibits *trans*-phagocytosis of both IgG- and iC3b-opsonized particles by infected phagocytic cells (Dahan et al., 2005; Marchès et al., 2008). IgG- and iC3b-mediated *trans*-phagocytosis each proceed through distinct mechanisms that are mediated by different host cell factors, although both processes require local actin polymerization and membrane expansion to facilitate internalization (Allen and Aderem, 1996; Caron and Hall, 1998). Because EspJ localizes diffusely to the cytoplasm and these *trans*-phagocytic pathways exhibit limited similarity, this suggests that EspJ exerts its effects on shared upstream mediators of *trans*-phagocytosis rather than locally, at the phagocytic cup (Marchès et al., 2008; Kurushima et al., 2010). However, further work is required to determine the host cell targets of EspJ and the mechanism by which it exerts its anti-phagocytic activity.

Unlike the other effectors that inhibit phagocytosis, EspH targets the regulators of actin reorganization that drive phagocytosis, thereby preventing infected phagocytes from performing either *cis-* or *trans*-phagocytosis (Dong et al., 2010). EspH binds mammalian Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and competitively inhibits their interactions with Rho GTPases, which regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Dong et al., 2010). Therefore, EspH indirectly inhibits Rho GTPase activation, preventing the actin reorganization that drives both *cis-* and *trans*-phagocytosis (Caron and Hall, 1998; Dong et al., 2010).

### Modulation of inflammatory signalling pathways

IECs have complex roles in the regulation of inflammation, as they maintain intestinal homeostasis in healthy conditions, but are important activators of mucosal inflammation and immune signalling during bacterial infection (Kagnoff and Eckmann, 1997; Peterson and Artis, 2014). IECs sense and respond to the presence of bacterial stimuli on both their apical and basolateral surfaces through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Peterson and Artis, 2014). In healthy individuals, the PRR-mediated detection of bacterial stimuli on the apical surfaces of IECs induces tolerogenic immune signals, preventing aberrant inflammatory activation against the commensal bacteria populating the gut lumen (Peterson and Artis, 2014). However, reports have shown that PRR-mediated detection of bacterial products on IEC basolateral surfaces results in the activation of inflammatory signalling pathways, as the activation of basolateral PRRs indicates intestinal barrier disruption or the presence invading bacterial pathogens (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010; Peterson and Artis, 2014).

The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are pro-inflammatory signalling pathways downstream of PRR activation that regulate the production and secretion of inflammatory mediators (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). A large proportion of EPEC/EHEC effectors have been shown to target the NF-κB pathway; therefore, this pathway and the associated effectors will be the primary focus of this section, while MAPK-associated effectors will be briefly described (Shaulian and Karin, 2001).

The NF-κB pathway plays a complex role in IECs as it can induce either pro- or anti-inflammatory signalling depending on the context of pathway activation (Peterson and Artis, 2014). In the context of EPEC/EHEC infection, the NF-κB pathway acts as an essential inflammatory signalling cascade that regulates the production of interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6; IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and induces intestinal inflammation to mediate host defence (Neurath et al., 1998). ‘NF-κB’ refers to transcription factor complexes formed by homo- and heterodimers of Rel homology proteins, such as p65 and p50, and non-Rel subunits (Hatada et al., 2000; Wan et al., 2007). Rel subunits are held in inactive states in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells by members of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) family of proteins (Hatada et al., 2000). Following host cell detection of foreign antigens by PRRs, or of inflammatory cytokines by TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), a cascade of phosphorylation and ubiquitination events is initiated, leading to the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates IκB, targeting it for degradation (Hatada et al., 2000). IκB degradation frees p65/p50, allowing them to translocate to the nucleus, where they serve as transcriptional activators of genes encoding cytokines involved in the innate immune response, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α (Pahl, 1999; Hatada et al., 2000).

EPEC/EHEC effectors antagonize the MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways and inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators throughout the course of infection. These T3SS effectors can be divided into three groups: those that directly impact the activity of MAPK or NF-κB signalling pathways and those that affect the composition of NF-κB transcription factor complexes (Fig. 2).

#### Effectors that target NF-κB signalling

EspT mimics the function of mammalian RhoGEFs to directly activate Rac1, a Rho GTPase regulator of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways (Arbibe et al., 2000; Raymond et al., 2011). EspT RhoGEF activity through Rac1 results in increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β in infected macrophages and increased expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in CR-infected C57BL/6 mice

Subversion of Host Immunity by Pathogenic E. coli 5

Fig. 2. NF-κB inhibition in intestinal epithelial cells. EPEC/EHEC effectors (shown in red) inhibit NF-κB activation by targeting components of the signalling cascade or preventing nuclear translocation of NF-κB complex components. Tir enhances the association of inhibitory SHP1 and SHP2 with TRAF6. NleE methylates TAB2/3, inhibiting TAK1 activation. NleB glycosylates GAPDH, preventing its activation of TRAF2. NleH1 inhibits the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complex subunit, RPS3. NleH2 promotes RPS3 nuclear translocation. NleC proteolytically cleaves the p65 subunit of NF-κB. NleC also cleaves p300, an acetyltransferase that promotes p65 activity. Abbreviations: SHP, Src-homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator.

(Arbibe et al., 2000; Raymond et al., 2011). However, EspT does not stimulate inflammatory cytokine production in infected IECs, indicating that this pro-inflammatory activity is cell type specific (Arbibe et al., 2000; Raymond et al., 2011). Furthermore, EspT is absent in EHEC and is only present in a minority of EPEC strains, indicating that despite its pro-inflammatory activity, EspT is unlikely to play a substantial role in human infection (Arbeloa et al., 2009; Raymond et al., 2011).

Tir is the first effector translocated into host cells during EPEC/EHEC infection and, along with intimin, it is essential for pedestal formation and intimate attachment to the host cell (Kenny et al., 1997; Mills et al., 2013). Tir has also been implicated in the suppression of NF-κB activation via several proposed mechanisms, although Tir-mediated NF-κB repression remains controversial. Ruchaud-Sparagano et al. (2011) showed that ectopically expressed Tir interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2 and targets it for proteasome-independent loss, thus inhibiting TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Infection studies in IECs have shown a far less dramatic effect of Tir on NF-κB-mediated IL-8 secretion but have supported a role for Tir in TRAF2 depletion (Ruchaud-Sparagano et al., 2011).

Similarly, Yan et al. (2012; 2013) demonstrated that ectopically expressed Tir interacts with the regulatory protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 in macrophages, enhancing their inhibitory associations with TRAF6 and thereby preventing downstream NF-κB activation. Tir interactions with SHP1/2 are mediated through its tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, which are also essential for pedestal formation during EPEC infection (Yan et al., 2012;

zation of IκB in infected host cells prevents p65 nuclear translocation, and downstream NF-κB activity, including expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 (Nadler *et al.*, 2010; Newton *et al.*, 2010). More recently, Zhang *et al.* (2012) found that NleE possesses S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activity and specifically methylates TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding proteins 2 and 3 (TAB2; TAB3), preventing the TAB2/3 ubiquitin chain-sensing activity required to activate TAK1, a mediator of NF-κB signalling upstream of IκB. This work strongly suggests that NleE-specific methylation of TAB2/3 results in the stabilization of IκB, inhibiting downstream NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine production.

NleE has also been shown to impact inflammatory signalling in EPEC-infected DCs. DCs are crucial mediators of immune surveillance and regularly sample the intestinal lumen from beneath the epithelium, functioning as monitors for evidence of enteric pathogens. EPEC-infected DCs secrete lower levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α as a result of NleE-mediated inhibition (Vossenkämper *et al.*, 2010). NleE activity was also implicated in the reduced expression of T cell co-stimulatory molecules on EPEC-infected DCs, indicating that in addition to suppressing inflammatory signalling, NleE compromises DC-mediated activation of the adaptive immune response in the infected epithelium (Vossenkämper *et al.*, 2010).

In combination with NleE, NleB contributes to the suppression of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Nadler *et al.*, 2010). Neither NleB1 nor NleB2 have been shown to have a substantial impact on NF-κB signalling or IL-8 production, although ectopically expressed NleB1 inhibits IκB degradation, preventing p65 nuclear translocation and IL-8 production (Newton *et al.*, 2010; Li *et al.*, 2013; Pearson *et al.*, 2013). In contrast to NleE, NleB1 only suppresses NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α stimulation and likely has a minor role in NF-κB suppression under physiological conditions (Newton *et al.*, 2010).

NleB1 and NleB2 are glycosyltransferases that specifically modify host cell targets with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) (Gao *et al.*, 2013; Li *et al.*, 2013; Pearson *et al.*, 2013). Gao *et al.* (2013) conducted infection studies that showed that NleB1 glycosylates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a mediator of the TRAF2-dependent pro-inflammatory signalling cascade downstream of TNFR1. They demonstrated that glycosylation severely reduced the ability of GAPDH to bind to and activate TRAF2, and proposed GAPDH glycosylation as the mechanism by which NleB1 impairs downstream TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation (Gao *et al.*, 2013). However, NleB-mediated glycosylation of GAPDH is controversial. Two reports have independently demonstrated that NleB1 targets and specifically glycosylates the death domains (DDs) of proteins involved in death receptor signalling, although neither found GAPDH to be a target of NleB1 glycosylation (Gao *et al.*, 2013; Li *et al.*, 2013; Pearson *et al.*, 2013). These conflicting results indicate that further work is required to clarify the mechanism behind NleB-mediated suppression of NF-κB.

### Effectors that target NF-κB complex components

NleH1, NleH2 and NleC directly affect the composition of the NF-κB complex. NleH1 and NleH2 bind to ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a non-Rel homology subunit of NF-κB complexes that confers regulatory specificity over NF-κB-mediated gene expression (Wan *et al.*, 2007; Gao *et al.*, 2009). NleH1 is a serine/threonine kinase that inhibits RPS3 nuclear translocation in a kinase-dependent manner, although RPS3 is not a substrate of NleH1 phosphorylation (Gao *et al.*, 2009). NleH1–RPS3 interactions prevent IKK-dependent phosphorylation of RPS3, which is required for RPS3 activation and nuclear translocation (Wan *et al.*, 2011). However, NleH1 phosphorylates v-Crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene-like protein, an IKKβ interacting protein, and this interaction is proposed to facilitate the recruitment of NleH1 to IKKβ–RPS3 complexes, where NleH1 exerts its inhibitory function (Pham *et al.*, 2013; Halavaty *et al.*, 2014). In contrast to NleH1, NleH2 appears to moderately increase the nuclear abundance of active RPS3, potentially increasing activation of RPS3-dependent, NF-κB-regulated genes (Pham *et al.*, 2012). Furthermore, NleH2 can homodimerize or form heterodimers with NleH1 and the relative proportions of these effectors impact NF-κB activity; higher levels of NleH1 suppress NF-κB activity and higher levels of NleH2 increase NF-κB activity (Pham *et al.*, 2012). Overall, NleH1 modulation of RPS3 nuclear abundance attenuates the expression of a subset of NF-κB target genes, demonstrating a precise and specific inhibition of NF-κB targets in contrast to the global inhibition of NF-κB targets displayed by other effectors, including NleC and NleE (Gao *et al.*, 2009).

NleH1 and NleH2 have also been shown to inhibit the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκB (Royan *et al.*, 2010). Royan *et al.* showed that ectopically expressed NleH1 and NleH2 prevented IκB ubiquitination and degradation in a kinase-dependent manner, although later studies were unable to reproduce these results, indicating that they may have been an artefact of ectopic overexpression (Gao *et al.*, 2009; Royan *et al.*, 2010; Wan *et al.*, 2011; Pham *et al.*, 2012).

NleC is a zinc metalloprotease; its protease activity is required to suppress inflammation and minimize intestinal pathology in CR-infected mice (Baruch *et al.*, 2011). NleC localizes to the cytoplasm beneath infecting bacteria as well as to the nucleus of infected cells, although it lacks a

canonical nuclear localization signal and is too large for passive nuclear entry (Yen *et al.*, 2010; Baruch *et al.*, 2011). NleC directly cleaves p65 within the region required for DNA binding, within its N-terminal Rel homology domain (Yen *et al.*, 2010; Baruch *et al.*, 2011; Mühlen *et al.*, 2011). Furthermore, NleC-mediated proteolysis of p65 occurs late in infection and results in proteasome-independent degradation of p65, suppressed NF-κB activation, and impaired secretion of IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α (Yen *et al.*, 2010; Baruch *et al.*, 2011; Mühlen *et al.*, 2011; Pearson *et al.*, 2011). In addition to free p65, NleC is capable of cleaving IκB-bound p65; however, this requires NleC overexpression, indicating that free p65 is the primary target (Yen *et al.*, 2010; Baruch *et al.*, 2011; Mühlen *et al.*, 2011; Pearson *et al.*, 2011). Furthermore, NleC was also reported to target other NF-κB complex components, p50 and c-Rel, for proteasome-independent degradation (Mühlen *et al.*, 2011; Turco and Sousa, 2014). Partial structures of EPEC NleC<sub>(19–287)</sub> and NleC<sub>(23–293)</sub> indicate that NleC uses electronegative residues to mimic the phosphate backbone of the major groove of DNA, facilitating its interactions with transcription factors (Li *et al.*, 2014; Turco and Sousa, 2014). Additionally, a full-length structure for CR NleC has been solved and is publicly available on the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics protein data bank, PDB ID: 4O2I (Chang *et al.*, 2014).

Finally, NleC interacts with and facilitates the degradation of p300, a histone acetyltransferase that localizes to the nucleus and enhances the activity of p65 (Chen *et al.*, 2001; Shames *et al.*, 2011b). Shames *et al.* (2011b) showed that p300 depletion correlated with suppressed NF-κB-mediated IL-8 production, suggesting that NleC-mediated p300 loss contributes to IL-8 suppression. Collectively, these results indicate that NleC broadly neutralizes NF-κB pathway activation and acts in concert with NleB and NleE to reduce the abundance of active p65 in infected cells, minimizing host inflammatory signaling and inhibiting secretion of inflammatory cytokines (Baruch *et al.*, 2011; Pearson *et al.*, 2011).

Several other EPEC/EHEC effectors may be potential inhibitors of IL-8 secretion. EspG, NleA and NleF inhibit vesicle transport in infected epithelial cells, impairing the general secretory pathway, which is required to facilitate the secretion of inflammatory mediators such as IL-8 (Selyunin *et al.*, 2011; 2014; Dong *et al.*, 2012; Thanabalasuriar *et al.*, 2012).

### Effectors that target MAPK signalling

As previously noted, the greater proportion of EPEC/EHEC effectors have been described as modulators of NF-κB signalling, although NleD, NleH2 and NleC have been implicated in the regulation of MAPK signalling. NleD is a zinc metalloprotease that directly cleaves the MAPK signalling pathway components p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in EPEC-infected epithelial cells (Marchés *et al.*, 2005; Baruch *et al.*, 2011). NleD cleaves JNK within its activation loop, preventing its downstream activation of c-Jun, a subunit of the AP-1 transcription factor (Shaulian and Karin, 2001; Baruch *et al.*, 2011). AP-1 is a transcriptional activator of pro-inflammatory cytokine production; therefore, its suppression is implicated in decreased cytokine production (Shaulian and Karin, 2001; Baruch *et al.*, 2011). Furthermore, NleD has been implicated in the suppression of IL-8 secretion, although NleD knockout strains display no secretion defect, indicating that it plays a minor role (Baruch *et al.*, 2011). Apart from RPS3-related roles, NleH2 is also implicated in the regulation of MAPK activity, as ectopically expressed NleH2 enhances AP-1-dependent transcription in epithelial cells (Gao *et al.*, 2009). Finally, in addition to NF-κB related functions, NleC has been shown to inhibit phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at the pedestal beneath infecting bacteria, resulting in suppressed MAPK activity and decreased IL-8 secretion (Sham *et al.*, 2011). Further investigation is required to determine the extent of the suppressive effects of EPEC/EHEC effectors on MAPK signalling.

### Regulation of host cell survival

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that can proceed through two pathways: an extrinsic, receptor-mediated pathway and an intrinsic, mitochondria-mediated pathway (Rudel *et al.*, 2010). These pathways both lead to the activation of caspases, which irreversibly cleave essential cellular proteins, committing cells to death. However, EPEC-infected tissues do not display late apoptotic markers such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation, suggesting some ability to antagonize host apoptosis during infection (Crane *et al.*, 2001). Several EPEC T3SS effectors interfere with host apoptotic pathways and cell cycle progression, inhibiting cell death (Fig. 3).

---

### Effectors promoting cell death

EPEC and EHEC pathogens encode a subset of effectors that promote cell death, including EspF, Map and Cif. EspF is an EPEC/EHEC T3SS effector that is associated with several phenotypes including epithelial barrier disruption, increased intrinsic apoptotic cell death and caspase-dependent loss of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) (McNamara *et al.*, 2001; Nougayrède and Donnenberg, 2004; Roxas *et al.*, 2014). EspF contains a canonical N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, which allows EspF import into the mitochondrial matrix by the host machinery (Nougayrède and Donnenberg, 2004).

Fig. 3. Modulation of cell survival.

EPEC/EHEC effectors (shown in red) target both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathways to promote host cell survival. NleD and NleB inhibit mediators of extrinsic apoptosis downstream of death receptor signalling. NleD proteolytically cleaves JNK. NleB1 glycosylates death receptor adaptor proteins TRADD and FADD, inhibiting their recruitment to death-inducing signalling complexes. NleH1, NleH2, EspT, EspM2 and EspZ inhibit intrinsic apoptosis. NleH1 and NleH2 enhance BI-1 inhibition of Bax-mediated mitochondrial permeabilization. EspT and EspM2 inhibit EspH-mediated caspase-3 activation. EspZ inhibits depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and prevents over-secretion of effectors into infected host cells. EspF, Map and Cif promote cell death. Map and EspF both induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization. EspF also inhibits the activity of Abcf2, an inhibitor of caspase-3 activation. Cif promotes caspase-3 activation after prolonged infection. Abbreviations: BI-1, Bax inhibitor 1; Cyt c, cytochrome c; Abcf2, ATP-binding cassette sub-family F member 2.

Within mitochondria, EspF destabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), leading to cytochrome c release, caspase activation and downstream intrinsic apoptosis (Crane et al., 2001; Nougayrède and Donnenberg, 2004; Nagai et al., 2005). EspF also interacts with a cytoplasmic ABC transporter superfamily member Abcf2, which has no confirmed function, although it appears to inhibit caspase activation in IECs (Nougayrède et al., 2007). EspF facilitates Abcf2 degradation in EPEC-infected cells, potentially resulting in increased activation of caspases-3 and -9 and promoting intrinsic apoptotic cell death (Nougayrède et al., 2007).

Like EspF, the mitochondria-associated protein (Map) effector localizes to mitochondria of infected epithelial cells using an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (Kenny and Jepson, 2000; Nagai et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2006). Map subsequently disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential, causes cytochrome c release and triggers intrinsic apoptosis (Kenny and Jepson, 2000; Kenny et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2006; Papatheodorou et al., 2006). Map is also associated with dramatic morphological changes in mitochondria, suggesting mechanistic differences between Map and EspF activities (Ma et al., 2006; Papatheodorou et al., 2006).

In contrast to EspF and Map, cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) has no known impact on mitochondrial function, but was found to halt cell cycle progression in infected epithelial cells. The stage at which Cif causes cell cycle arrest is debated; reports have suggested that arrest occurs at G2/M, G1/S or both G2 and G1 transitions (Marchès et al., 2003; Taieb et al., 2006; Hsu et al., 2008; Samba-Louaka et al., 2008; Morikawa et al., 2010).

Extensive investigations have determined the structure of Cif and the mechanism by which it induces cell cycle arrest, including its deamidase catalytic site and a ubiquitin-like host target (Hsu et al., 2008; Samba-Louaka et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2010; Morikawa et al., 2010). Following prolonged infection and cell cycle arrest, Cif induces delayed apoptosis in infected cells as indicated by the accumulation of activated caspase-3 and increased caspase activation at 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection (Samba-Louaka et al., 2009). Cif-induced cell cycle arrest and delayed apoptosis have not been definitively linked, although Cif deamidase activity is required to mediate both phenotypes (Samba-Louaka et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2010; Morikawa et al., 2010).

### Effectors inhibiting cell death

#### Extrinsic apoptosis
The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is activated upon recognition of extracellular danger signals by cell surface death receptors. Death receptor engagement triggers the recruitment of intracellular DD-containing adaptor proteins, which function in downstream signalling complexes. For example, soluble TNF-α binds to the death receptor TNFR1, triggering the recruitment of cytoplasmic TNFR1-associated DD protein (TRADD). Similarly, Fas ligand binds to Fas, recruiting Fas-associated DD protein (FADD). TRADD and FADD function in downstream signalling complexes that activate caspase-8, which is subsequently released to the cytosol, where it proteolytically activates downstream executioner caspases, promoting apoptotic cell death (Micheau and Tschopp, 2003; Strasser et al., 2009).

Along with its role in inflammation, NleD-mediated cleavage of JNK inhibits extrinsic apoptosis in infected epithelial cells (Marchés *et al.*, 2005; Baruch *et al.*, 2011). JNK is activated downstream of TLR, TNFR or IL-1R death receptor stimulation; active JNK phosphorylates and activates the AP-1 transcription factor subunit c-Jun, which mediates cell survival and apoptosis (Shaulian and Karin, 2001). However, during EPEC infection, NleD cleaves JNK within the activation loop, preventing downstream activation of c-Jun and suppressing extrinsic apoptosis (Baruch *et al.*, 2011).

As mentioned earlier, NleB1 and NleB2 are glycosyltransferases that modulate inflammatory and survival signalling during EPEC and EHEC infection (Gao *et al.*, 2013; Li *et al.*, 2013; Pearson *et al.*, 2013). NleB1 specifically GlcNAcylates conserved arginine residues within the DDs of adaptor proteins FADD, TRADD and RIPK1 (Li *et al.*, 2013; Pearson *et al.*, 2013). Although serine/threonine GlcNAcylation is a common post-translational modification affecting cell signalling, arginine modification is an unprecedented GlcNAcylation event (Golks and Guerini, 2008; Li *et al.*, 2013). NleB1-mediated GlcNAcylation events prevented all DD-dependent homo- or heterotypic interactions required for recruitment to the TNFR1 death receptor, interrupting pro-apoptotic death receptor signalling within infected host cells (Li *et al.*, 2013; Pearson *et al.*, 2013). NleB1 interruptions in death receptor signalling downstream of Fas and TNFR1 resulted in reduced activation of caspase-8, indicating suppressed extrinsic apoptotic signalling (Pearson *et al.*, 2013). Although NleB1 potently glycosylated target proteins, NleB2 displayed marginal glycosyltransferase activity and was insufficient to mediate anti-apoptotic effects alone (Li *et al.*, 2013; Pearson *et al.*, 2013).

Intrinsic apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by a variety of intracellular stresses and commonly results in the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of cytochrome *c* into the cytosol (Rudel *et al.*, 2010). Cytosolic cytochrome *c* drives the formation of the apoptosome, a signalling complex that activates caspase-9, the initiator caspase for intrinsic apoptosis (Li *et al.*, 1997). Caspase-9 activates downstream executioner caspases, including caspases-3 and -7, which facilitate cell death (Rudel *et al.*, 2010).

NleH1 and NleH2 inhibit caspase-dependent apoptosis in infected host cells, reducing levels of active caspase-3 and thereby preventing cell death (Hemrajani *et al.*, 2010). NleH1 interacts with Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) in a kinase-independent manner, promoting BI-1 anti-apoptotic inhibition of Bax (Hemrajani *et al.*, 2010; Robinson *et al.*, 2010). BI-1 prevents Bax-mediated mitochondrial permeabilization, inhibiting cytochrome *c* release and the apoptotic protease-activating factor 1-mediated apoptotic cascade (Li *et al.*, 1997; Elmore, 2007). Furthermore, NleH1 prevents intrinsic apoptosis triggered by potent pro-apoptotic compounds, including staurosporine (STS) and *Clostridium difficile* toxin B, indicating that NleH1 possesses substantial anti-apoptotic activity (Matarrese *et al.*, 2007; Hemrajani *et al.*, 2010; Robinson *et al.*, 2010).

EspH is a global inhibitor of mammalian RhoGEFs that contributes to caspase-3 activation and the induction of intrinsic apoptosis in infected epithelial cells (Wong *et al.*, 2012). Wong *et al.* (2012) showed that EspH is a potent activator of caspase-3 and inducer of intrinsic apoptosis when overexpressed but plays a smaller role at physiologically relevant levels. Furthermore, EspT and EspM2 are bacterial RhoGEF mimics that are unaffected by EspH inhibition and act to inhibit EspH-induced intrinsic apoptosis (Wong *et al.*, 2012). Epithelial cells transfected with *espT* or *espM2* were able to suppress EspH- and STS-induced caspase-3 activation and promote cell survival in a manner dependent upon their RhoGEF activity (Wong *et al.*, 2012).

EspZ inhibits intrinsic apoptosis and promotes host survival via several proposed mechanisms, ultimately resulting in the inhibition of caspase activation in infected IECs. First, EspZ was shown to facilitate focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated pro-survival signalling through an interaction with the CD98 transmembrane glycoprotein in HeLa cells (Feral *et al.*, 2005; Shames *et al.*, 2010). However, later studies in IEC lines demonstrated that EspZ-associated FAK activation did not contribute to cell survival, indicating that FAK-mediated pro-survival effects were an artefact of the HeLa cell model (Roxas *et al.*, 2012).

Second, EspZ also localizes to mitochondria and stabilizes ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> during infection (Shames *et al.*, 2011a; Roxas *et al.*, 2012). EspZ activity counters the cytotoxic effects of Map and EspF within mitochondria and prevents the release of cytochrome *c*; the activation of caspases-9, -3 and -7; and the induction of intrinsic apoptosis (Shames *et al.*, 2011a; Roxas *et al.*, 2012). Shames *et al.* (2011a) demonstrated that EspZ interacts with the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane 17b (Tim17b), the voltage-gating component of the mitochondrial complex that imports proteins into the mitochondrial matrix (Bömer *et al.*, 1996). Shames *et al.* (2011a) suggested that the EspZ–Tim17b interaction stabilizes ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> during infection and prevents the initiation of intrinsic apoptosis by cytochrome *c* release from dysfunctional mitochondria (Chacinska *et al.*, 2009). Shames *et al.* (2011a) showed that RNAi-mediated knockout of Tim17b resulted in decreased survival of EPEC-infected cells, supporting the proposed EspZ–

Tim17b mechanism. However, other reports have shown that Tim17b ablation results in decreased cell survival, suggesting that these results cannot definitively support the EspZ–Tim17b mechanism and that further investigation is required (Garabedian et al., 2011; Sinha et al., 2014).

EspZ also localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane at the site of bacterial attachment and was shown to interact with EspD, a component of the T3SS translocon pore (Creasey et al., 2003). A third model proposes that EspZ prevents cell death by acting as a negative regulator of T3SS effector translocation into infected cells (Mills et al., 2008; Berger et al., 2012). Berger et al. (2012) demonstrated that EPEC were unable to translocate effectors into HeLa cells that had been stably transfected with espZ prior to infection, suggesting that EspZ mediates type III secretion auto-inhibition from within infected cells. Furthermore, the addition of a chemical inhibitor of type III secretion to EPEC ΔespZ-infected cells was able to prevent cell death in a fashion similar to wild-type EPEC-infected cells (Berger et al., 2012). Given EspZ localization to the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane beneath infecting bacteria, it may perform this function locally (Kanack et al., 2005). However, effector auto-inhibition may have been an artefact of ectopic espZ over-expression; therefore, investigation with physiologically relevant levels of EspZ is required to validate this mechanism.

Early studies demonstrated that EGFR signalling pathways are activated in EPEC-infected cells and are known to promote host cell survival (Roxas et al., 2007). Recent work has shown that both EspZ and EspF regulate EGFR stability in infected IECs, potentially resulting in the modulation of host cell survival (Roxas et al., 2014). EspF stimulates caspase-mediated loss of EGFR in infected cells, whereas EspZ opposes caspase activation and protects EGFR, thus promoting host survival (Roxas et al., 2014). Although EspF and EspZ both influence caspase-3, -7 and -9 activation, EspZ is delivered into host cells early in infection (Nougayrède and Donnenberg, 2004; Mills et al., 2008; Shames et al., 2011a; Roxas et al., 2012). Early EspZ delivery was proposed to delay EGFR loss until after the bacterial colony is established, providing ample time for growth prior to EspF-induced host cell death (Roxas et al., 2014).

A general apoptosis inhibitor. NleF directly inhibits caspases involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, including caspases-4, -8 and -9 (Echtenkamp et al., 2008; Blasche et al., 2013). nleF-transfected IECs are able to resist cell death from chemical inducers of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, although in the context of infection NleF cannot independently inhibit apoptosis due to its low abundance (Echtenkamp et al., 2008; Blasche

et al., 2013). Blasche et al. (2013) co-crystallized NleF and caspase-9 and showed that the C-terminal residues of NleF directly block the caspase-9 active site, inhibiting its proteolytic activity.

### Concluding remarks

Several recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the mechanisms by which EPEC and EHEC subvert the innate immune response. Recent determinations of effector structures and the identification of host effector targets have contributed significantly, providing context and clarifying mechanisms of action. Crystal structures have provided insight into how effectors interact with host targets, as demonstrated by the example of NleC use of DNA mimicry to bind NF-κB transcription factors. Researchers have also attributed novel functions to known effectors, such as EspZ and EspF moderation of EGFR degradation, providing insight into the complex roles that many effectors play within infected cells.

The EPEC/EHEC effector repertoires exhibit a variety of partially overlapping or antagonistic activities in infected host cells. At a glance, these redundant or opposing functions may seem dispensable. However, strains lacking many of these effectors exhibit substantial virulence defects, indicating that, despite redundancy and antagonism, many effectors play substantial roles in pathogenesis and transmission (Wickham et al., 2007).

Effector functions may appear redundant when examining outcomes such as NF-κB activity or cytokine secretion; however, potentially redundant effectors inhibit innate immune pathways at multiple sequential points. These provide layers of inhibition, such that if the suppressive activity of any one effector is superseded, downstream inhibitors prevent pathway activation. NleB, NleE and NleC provide one example, as each inhibits NF-κB activation at distinct steps, although initial observations may indicate that these have redundant functions. The combined effects of such effectors exert a greater and more enduring influence over innate immune suppression.

Antagonistic effectors are more difficult to reconcile as part of an efficient infection strategy. A likely explanation for this antagonism lies in the sequential nature of effector translocation. Mills et al. (2008) showed that the pro-survival effector EspZ is translocated earlier in infection, whereas the pro-apoptotic EspF follows later. Although both are essential effectors, the translocation order indicates that EspZ is able to act first, preventing cell death before EspF can trigger mitochondrial dysfunction (Wickham et al., 2007). EspZ allows for EPEC/EHEC to

infect the host cell until the eventual induction of apoptosis by EspF and effectors with similar functions. Whether host cell death is beneficial to the pathogen or not, the induction of apoptosis is advantageous, as the alternative necrotic death triggers a more dramatic inflammatory response. Antagonistic effectors may provide EPEC/EHEC with a more precise level of control and regulation over host processes, allowing these pathogens to efficiently exploit host cells.

The significance of any given effector in the context of EPEC/EHEC infection depends on the prevalence of the effector in bacterial strains and the magnitude of its effects within the infected host. Effectors encoded in the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, such as Map, EspF and EspZ, are very common in EPEC and EHEC isolates, which is not surprising as the LEE also encodes the T3SS complex, which is essential for virulence (Creuzburg *et al.*, 2011; Croxen *et al.*, 2013). The prevalence of non-LEE encoded effectors is more varied. NleC appears frequently among EPEC strains, whereas NleE, NleB and Cif appear in approximately half of EPEC isolates, while NleD is in fewer than half (Arbeloa *et al.*, 2009; Creuzburg *et al.*, 2011; Salvador *et al.*, 2014). With regard to effector activity, NleC, NleE, EspF and EspZ each mediate characteristic phenotypes during infection and play substantial roles in virulence, whereas NleF and NleD play contributory roles, but are not essential for virulence (Wickham *et al.*, 2007; Baruch *et al.*, 2011; Blasche *et al.*, 2013). The combination of the magnitude of innate immune suppression mediated by a given effector and its prevalence in EPEC/EHEC populations dictates the overall impact of an effector during infection.

Collectively, EPEC and EHEC are complex pathogens that use a T3SS effector-mediated approach to efficiently infect human tissues. These effectors form non-mutually exclusive functional groups and together they exert intricate control over host innate immune function. Despite their interconnected roles in innate immune processes, these effectors have been studied and described in isolation, which makes the development of a holistic model of effector function more challenging. However, by combining what is known about effectors and the pathways in which these effectors function, it is clear that EPEC and EHEC target and subvert host innate immune pathways by the collective action of their effector repertoires.
