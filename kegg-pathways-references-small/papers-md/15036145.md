**Salmonella redirects phagosomal maturation**

John H Brumell¹ and Sergio Grinstein²

Following invasion of host cells, *Salmonella* occupies an intracellular vacuole that superficially resembles a phagosome. However, unlike *bona fide* phagosomes that undergo a maturation process to become microbicidal phago-lysosomes, *Salmonella* avoid killing by arresting and diverting the maturation program of the invasion vacuole. As a result of this re-routing, the bacteria generate a protected niche where they survive and replicate.

**Introduction**

*Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium (*S.* Typhimurium) is a remarkably versatile pathogen, with the ability to infect multiple hosts and cause different diseases [1]. In humans, it is a leading cause of gastroenteritis (food poisoning) and in mice it causes a systemic disease resembling typhoid fever. During infection, *S.* Typhimurium can invade and proliferate within both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells of its host. After invasion, the bacteria reside in a membrane-bound compartment known as the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole (SCV). Through the course of infection, *S.* Typhimurium is thought to occupy this intracellular niche, and is thereby protected from cell-impermeant antibiotics [2]. The molecular mechanisms used by *S.* Typhimurium to survive and replicate within host cells are the subject of intense investigation and have been discussed comprehensively in other reviews [3*,4].

---

In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the SCV and how the bacteria redirect the fate of this compartment away from the normal phagosome maturation pathway. We overview the molecular events that are known to direct the normal maturation of phagosomes, highlight the steps that are altered by *Salmonella* and consider the bacterial effectors that may be responsible for these effects.

**Maturation of the Salmonella-containing vacuole**

Immediately after formation, the SCV undergoes a maturation process that includes transient interactions with early endosomes [5], followed by the acquisition of a subset of late endosomal markers [6] and an enrichment in cholesterol [7]. During this process, fusion of the SCV with lysosomes is thought to be avoided [8]. Delivery of the NADPH oxidase [9] and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) [10] to the SCV is also inhibited by *S.* Typhimurium, thereby minimizing exposure of the bacteria to harmful reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. After a lag period of 3–4 h, the SCV begins to elongate into tubular structures called *Salmonella*-induced filaments (Sifs) [6], an event that coincides with the initiation of bacterial replication.

---

Type III secretion systems (TTSS) play a major role in the biogenesis and maintenance of the SCV. These structures have been described as ‘molecular syringes’ and are thought to insert directly into host cell membranes to act as a delivery tube for bacterial proteins [11]. These proteins, called effectors, induce alterations of the host cell machinery that are essential for disease progression. *S.* Typhimurium has two TTSS, encoded on separate *Salmonella* pathogenicity islands (SPI) on the bacterial chromosome. The bacteria initiate ruffling of the host cell membrane at the site of contact. This ruffling response occurs as a result of rearrangement of the host cell actin cytoskeleton, initiated by the actions of at least five SPI-1 effectors [12]. After invasion, the SPI-1 TTSS directs the maturation of the SCV and is required for replication of *S.* Typhimurium in epithelial cells [13]. The SPI-2-encoded TTSS is expressed only after entry of the bacteria into host cells and mediates translocation of a distinct set of effectors across the SCV, which alter maturation of the SCV and promote intracellular replication.

---

**The bacterial point of view**

By analyzing an increasing number of subcellular markers, the composition of the SCV membrane is slowly being inferred. Addressing the composition of the SCV lumen also presents a formidable challenge, one that was
recently tackled with great success by Hinton and colleagues [14**] by analyzing the response of the bacteria to the luminal milieu. Using a novel method to extract bacterial RNA from infected cells, they used microarray technology to provide a global transcriptional profile of S. Typhimurium during infection of murine macrophages. When replicating in the SCV, the bacteria were found to alter the transcription of 919 genes compared to growth in cell culture medium, equating to 20% of their genome! By analyzing the expression of known genes, the authors deduced a comprehensive view of the environmental conditions faced by S. Typhimurium in the SCV. Their study suggests the SCV is acidic, with some degree of oxidative stress, low in phosphate and magnesium but high in potassium and oxygen. Surprisingly, their analysis also indicates that the SCV does not limit the availability of amino acids or iron. Of the 919 genes that were altered, 408 are of unknown function and will be important candidates for future study. It will also be of interest to determine if the SCV environment is the same in other cell types, as the composition of the SCV membrane is different in various cell types [15].

### Phagosomal maturation as a model of SCV progression

Immediately after formation, the SCV is virtually indistinguishable from phagosomes, the enclosures where non-invasive microorganisms are trapped by macrophages. To better understand the determinants of the fate of the SCV it is therefore instructive to review the progressive remodeling that the phagosomal vacuole undergoes after formation. Such changes in the composition of the vacuolar membrane and contents, collectively known as ‘maturation’, enable normal phagosomes to destroy invading microorganisms.

The first indicator of phagosomal maturation is the acquisition of Rab5, a small GTPase thought to direct vesicular traffic in the early steps of the endocytic pathway (see Figure 1). Rab5 is abruptly recruited to the phagosomal membrane shortly after sealing and resides there only briefly (1–2 min) [16]. The determinants of Rab5 recruitment and activation remain unknown, but a role for the exchange factors RIN and Rabex is conceivable. Rab5 is believed to direct the association and/or stimulation of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the enzyme responsible for the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). The importance of this lipid to phagosomal maturation is best illustrated by the effects of wortmannin, a potent PI3K inhibitor. Treatment with wortmannin blocks phago-lysosome formation, arresting maturation at an early stage, which resembles that attained by S. Typhimurium vacuoles [17,18].

The effects of PI3P are mediated, at least in part, by an early endosome-associated protein EEA1, a protein found also on endosomes where it is thought to bridge vesicles, facilitating their fusion. EEA1 is anchored to the membrane via interaction of its FYVE (Fab-1, YGL023, Vps27 and EEA1) domain with phagosomal PI3P and also by binding directly to Rab5. The precise mode of action of EEA1 is unclear, but injection of blocking antibodies to this bridging protein profoundly inhibited phagosomal maturation [17]. Despite the prominent role of EEA1, other PI3P-binding proteins are also likely to contribute to maturation. One such protein, Hrs, plays a central role in the formation of multi-vesicular bodies in the endocytic pathway [19] and was also recently detected to associate with phagosomes in a PI3P-dependent manner (Vieira et al., unpublished data). Moreover, silencing the Hrs gene with siRNA (short interfering RNA) led to a striking arrest of phagosomal maturation, resembling that caused by wortmannin. Thus, it is likely that multiple PI3P-binding molecules contribute to the maturation sequence.

Like EEA1, Hrs possesses multiple active domains and attaches to phagosomes via at least two separate sites. Hrs can interact with ubiquitylated proteins via its ubiquitin interaction motif domain and such modified proteins are most likely to exist on the vacuolar membrane, as phagocytic receptors were recently reported to trigger ubiquitylation [20]. As suggested for endosomes [19], interaction of Hrs with ubiquitylated substrates of phagosomes is likely to drive the inward budding of vesicles by an elaborate process involving the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) protein complexes. Consistent with this notion, phagosomes stain brightly with antibodies to lyso-bisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), a hallmark of multi-vesicular bodies that are characteristic of late endosomes. The late phagosomal stage is also identified by the acquisition of lysosomal glycoproteins. Although LAMP1 and LAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane proteins) are resident proteins of late endosomes, it is noteworthy that they don’t overlap entirely with the LBPA compartment and that the acquisition of the two types of markers by phagosomes can be partially dissociated under some conditions, such as upon inhibition of PI3K [17].

The transition between a Rab5- and EEA1-associated early phagosome and a late phagosome that contains LBPA is marked by the acquisition of Rab7, another GTPase that is important in phago-lysosome generation. The action of Rab5 is thought to be required for the subsequent recruitment of Rab7, although the details of this sequence are obscure. PI3K is unlikely to be essential, as a sizable fraction of Rab7 is acquired by wortmannin-treated phagosomes [21]. Active Rab7, in turn, attracts Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) to phagosomes. RILP is the only known effector of Rab7 and it operates by bridging the Rab7-bearing membrane with the dynein motor complex [22]. The latter uses ATP to propel the Rab7/RILP-bearing vesicles along microtubules in the centripetal direction, towards the centriole.

Current Opinion in Microbiology

Salmonella redirects phagosomal maturation. Schematic model of the normal phagosome maturation pathway (left) and the SCV maturation pathway (right). At early and intermediate stages of maturation, the SCV superficially resembles conventional phagosomes. However, after acquisition of Rab7 and RILP the SCV is redirected away from the phagosomal maturation pathway and does not fuse with lysosomes. Several hours after invasion, the SPI-2-encoded type III secretion system mediates delivery of SifA and other effectors into host cells, promoting the fusion of endosomal compartments with the SCV to form Salmonella-induced filaments (Sifs). Recent evidence suggests that maturation of the SCV may include interactions with the endoplasmic reticulum and trans-Golgi network.

Because lysosomes also tend to accumulate in a juxta-nuclear location, the physical translocation of incoming phagosomes to the center of the cells facilitates the collision and fusion of the two organelles. In fact, RILP was observed to pull tubular extensions from large phagosomes that extend towards the center of the cell, where

they can merge with lysosomes before the arrival of the main body of the phagosome [23].

The gradual transition from a nascent, plasma membrane-like phagosome to a phago-lysosome is accompanied by the progressive enrichment in vacuolar-type (V) ATPases. These proton pumps drive the gradual acidification of the phagosomal lumen from the initial extracellular-like pH of ~7.4 to values as low as 4.5. Remarkably, the acidification is not solely a consequence, but also an essential determinant of the maturation process. It is well established that by dissipating the luminal acidification, weak bases, protonophores and inhibitors of the V-ATPase can arrest maturation, although the underlying mechanism remains mysterious.

The sequence of events detailed above constitutes the conventional view of phagosomal maturation. A recent and exciting new concept was introduced last year by Desjardins and colleagues [24**]. These authors provided evidence that during the earliest stages of its formation, the phagosome merges with the endoplasmic reticulum, which ostensibly becomes a major constituent of the vacuolar membrane. The extent of this contribution and its significance to phago-lysosome development remain to be established.

### Aberrant maturation of Salmonella-containing vacuoles

There is general consensus that the early stages of SCV maturation resemble those seen in *bona fide* phagosomes. The early SCV acquires Rab5 (see Figure 2), which appears to be functional inasmuch as it promotes the association of EEA1 and the accumulation of PI3P (see Figure 2) [25]. Unlike phagosomes, however, SCV were reported to undergo repeated cycles of PI3P formation and depletion [26]. Neither the mechanism nor the significance of these oscillations has been clarified.

At least in epithelial cells, it is clear that the early SCV proceeds to a second maturation stage that resembles the intermediate phase of phagosomal maturation. Specifically, Rab5 and EEA1 rapidly dissociate from the SCV, being replaced by Rab7 (Figure 2; see [27] for dissenting view), which in turn begets LAMP1/2 [28]. Despite the acquisition of Rab7 and LAMP, this stage of SCV maturation is not equivalent to either the late endosome or late phagosome. In particular, it is interesting that LBPA, the quintessential marker of late endosomes, does not accumulate on SCV at this stage [7]. Accordingly, this intermediate stage of SCV maturation seems to segregate itself from the canonical endocytic pathway and fails to merge with pre-lysosomes and lysosomes. This is indicated by the absence of mannose-6-phosphate receptors [29] and of processed cathepsins from the SCV [30].

Because maturation is a complex, multifactorial process, the bacteria could conceivably intervene at multiple sites to induce arrest. As suggested for mycobacteria, they might interfere with the luminal acidification that is required for normal maturation. However, neither V-ATPase acquisition nor the ensuing acidification appear to be impaired in the case of *Salmonella*. On the contrary, the occurrence of SCV acidification is perceived by the bacteria as a signal for induction of additional virulence genes. In addition, two of the main determinants of phago-lysosome formation, Rab7 and PI3P, are present also in the SCV (see Figure 2). It therefore appears that the maturation arrest occurs downstream of these events. The activation of Rab7 and its ability to interact with effectors is not initially impaired. We recently found that RILP associates with the SCV during the first hours

Early stages of maturation of the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to either Rab5, two tandem FYVE domains from EEA1 or Rab7. Cells were then infected with S. Typhimurium for either 5 min (Rab5 and 2-FYVE) or 30 min (Rab7) before fixation and immunostaining of the bacteria. As shown, Rab5 and 2-FYVE (a probe for PI3P) bind to early SCV, before recruitment of Rab7. These results indicate that early trafficking of the SCV superficially resembles maturation of normal phagosomes.

following invasion (R Harrison *et al.*, unpublished data). Therefore, other components of the fusion machinery must be disabled by the bacteria. It remains to be defined if other Rab isoforms are involved in maturation and are affected by *S.* Typhimurium, or whether SNARE proteins (soluble *N*-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) responsible for docking and fusion are targeted.

Bacterial factors that block SCV fusion with lysosomes include the *phoP/Q* two component regulatory system [31]. The *phoP/Q* regulon controls expression of over 40 genes in *S.* Typhimurium [32]. These genes control many important virulence traits, including the ability to resist antimicrobial peptides and the control of alterations to lipopolysaccharide. The *phoP/Q*-modulated genes that control fusion of the SCV with lysosomes remain to be identified.

In addition to mediating invasion, the SPI-1 TTSS might also play a role in blocking fusion of SCV with lysosomes. Internalization of a non-invasive SPI-1 TTSS mutant via expression of the *Yersinia* invasin protein (which binds β1 integrins, inducing host cells to internalize bacteria) leads to an increased association of mannose-6-phosphate receptors with the SCV, compared with wild type bacteria [13]. Importantly, this SPI-1 TTSS mutant was unable to replicate in HeLa cells, even when co-internalized into cells with wild-type bacteria [13]. Thus, effectors of the SPI-1 TTSS play an essential role in the formation of a replicative niche for *S.* Typhimurium and cannot act in trans to complement for SPI-1 TTSS mutants.

Effectors of the SPI-2 TTSS are also likely to have a role in blocking lysosome fusion with the SCV independently of SPI-1 effectors, although this involvement remains somewhat unclear. The SPI-2-encoded protein SpiC was reported to be translocated into the host cell cytosol by the SPI-2 TTSS and to exert a potent inhibition on the fusion of a variety of intracellular membranes [33]. Two host-cell targets of SpiC have recently been identified. One of these, TassC, binds to the SCV only in *spiC* deficient mutants [34]. The function of TassC is not known, but its homology to the NIPSNAP family of proteins suggests a possible role in vesicle transport. Hook3, another potential SpiC target, is related to the *Drosophila* Hook protein [35]. Hook is required to prevent early fusion of multi-vesicular bodies with the lysosomal compartment [36].

### Salmonella-induced filament formation

Several hours after infection, the SCV undergoes a remarkable transformation that involves extensive fusion of endosomal compartments with the SCV. Fusion of these compartments with the SCV is dependent on Rab7 [7] and requires bacterial delivery of SifA into host cells by the SPI-2 TTSS [37–39]. Fusion results in the formation of long (up to 40 μm) tubular extensions of the SCV known as *Salmonella*-induced filaments (Sifs), which colocalize with and depend upon microtubules for their formation and stability [6,38].

Deletion of the *sifA* gene in *S.* Typhimurium blocks Sif formation [40] and leads to instability of the SCV, causing release of the bacteria into the cytosol of infected cells [37]. The fate of *S.* Typhimurium in the cytosol is dependent on the type of cell infected; the bacteria die in the cytosol of macrophages but replicate rapidly in the cytosol of epithelial cells [41–43]. The factor(s) that restrict bacterial growth in the cytosol of macrophages remain unknown. Release of *sifA* mutants from the SCV is mediated by SseJ, another SPI-2 effector predicted to have acyltransferase/lipase activity [44]. Thus, SifA and SseJ modulate stability of the SCV by complementary biochemical activities [44].

The nature of the endocytic compartments that fuse with the SCV is unclear, but they appear to contain partially processed cathepsin D and to be enriched in cholesterol [7]. Interestingly, LBPA is observed on or near the surface of Sifs, but remains in punctate structures and does not distribute uniformly along the tubules in the same manner as LAMP-1 [7]. Thus, multi-vesicular bodies may dock onto Sifs without fusing.

Because Rab7 is seemingly active during the first few hours of infection, it is remarkable that the SCV fails to merge with lysosomes and also that it extends centrifugally into Sifs at later times. The latter is unexpected, to the extent that the Rab7 effector RILP promotes the centripetal displacement of membranes, propelled by dynein. We therefore sought to establish if Rab7 remains active and associated with RILP at the later stages of infection. Remarkably, although Rab7 remains associated with the Sifs and is apparently active, it fails to bind RILP, accounting for the ability of the filamentous vacuoles to extend to the cell periphery. Additional experiments suggest that the dissociation of Rab7 from RILP requires the bacterial effector SifA, which is instrumental in Sif formation. Indeed, preliminary observations suggest that SifA may directly interact with active Rab7, possibly displacing RILP (R Harrison *et al.*, unpublished data).

Transfection of SifA alone into HeLa cells results in the formation of Sif-like tubular filaments containing LAMP-1, suggesting that this protein is sufficient to promote endosome fusion in infected cells [45,46]. Recent studies by Kuhle and Hensel, however, demonstrate that other SPI-2 effectors play a role in Sif formation [47]. Deletion of *sseF* and *sseG* blocked Sif formation at an intermediate stage; membrane extensions of the SCV containing the SPI-2 effector SseJ were observed, but these extensions (called pseudo-Sifs) did not contain LAMP-1 [47]. Deletion of *sopD2*, a SPI-2 effector that binds to late endocytic
compartments in host cells [48] also led to the formation
of pseudo-Sifs while blocking Sif formation in infected
HeLa cells (Jiang *et al.*, submitted). The nature of
pseudo-Sifs remains unknown, although these findings
indicate that Sif formation is more complex than previously appreciated. Furthermore, the demonstration that
at least four SPI-2 effectors contribute to Sif formation
underlines the importance of this mysterious phenotype.

### Interactions with the biosynthetic pathway

Two recent reports suggest an involvement of the biosynthetic pathway in maturation of the SCV. Knodler and
Steele-Mortimer [3*] observed that, as found in phagosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum appears to be a component of the early SCV. This tantalizing observation
raises the possibility that a merger with the endoplasmic
reticulum may contribute to the atypical maturation
profile of the SCV. Also, Salcedo and Holden [49**] have
reported that the SCV becomes surrounded by membranes of the trans-Golgi network at late times (>4 h)
post-infection. Surprisingly, this process was dependent
on the SPI-2 TTSS effector SseG, which was directed to
the Golgi complex [49**]. Together, these findings suggest that the fate of the SCV is dependent on interactions
with both the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways.

### Conclusions

When considered collectively, the findings summarized
in this review suggest that the SCV maturation arrest and
diversion induced by *S.* Typhimurium during the critical
first few hours after invasion cannot be readily explained
by interference with any of the known events of the
fusogenic sequence. Two avenues present themselves
to resolve the evasion mechanism in the future. One is the
piecemeal analysis of the mode of action of individual *S.*
Typhimurium effectors, perhaps by transfection or micro-
injection into host cells *in vitro*. The other is to complete
the characterization of the maturation sequence of normal
phagosomes to then identify the step(s) affected by the
bacteria. A more realistic scenario is that the definitive
answer will come from the parallel development of these
two approaches.
