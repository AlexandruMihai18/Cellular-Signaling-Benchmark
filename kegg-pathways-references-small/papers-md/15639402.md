## MALIGANT GLIOMA: CLINICAL BACKGROUND AND TREATMENT

Although the overall incidence of primary malignant brain tumours, 6.6 per 100,000<sup>1</sup> is relatively low compared to other tumours, with a median survival time of less than 2 years, they are nonetheless among the most lethal forms of cancer.<sup>2,3</sup> Additionally, the fact that little is known about the etiology of malignant brain tumours as well as the paucity of identifiable risk factors in the disease makes their prevention and treatment especially challenging. Understanding the basic biology and tumorigenesis involved in the formation of malignant brain tumours is thus of paramount importance in developing new therapeutic options in their treatment.

Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the leading cause of death among primary malignant brain tumours.<sup>4</sup> Currently there are no treatment standards for the management of GBM, and therapies vary considerably across centers. The role of surgical resection and its effect on survival remain controversial—even after 75 years of experience in the treatment of malignant gliomas.<sup>5</sup> Neurosurgeons vary in their opinions and practice patterns, and the management of GBM ranges from biopsy to total resection, followed by radiation in all cases and adjuvant chemotherapy in some cases. For many neurosurgeons, surgical resection of high-grade gliomas remains the mainstay of treatment. On the other hand, given the highly aggressive nature, high rate of recurrence, and infiltrative nature of GBM, radical resection of GBM is advocated only by some surgeons. Nonetheless, the fact remains that despite numerous retrospective studies and a few prospective studies on the topic, surgical resection of GBMs has not been shown to significantly correlate with survival.<sup>5–7</sup>

Despite the varying treatment practices, it is well known that surgery and radiation treatment are superior to surgery alone,<sup>8</sup> with the former survival time being 32 weeks vs. 14 weeks. This study was paramount in establishing treatment guidelines that recommended that all patients should be treated with XRT regardless of whether or not they had a gross total resection, partial resection, biopsy or no surgical resection at all of their tumour. However, no prospective data exists investigating whether surgical resection and radiation/chemotherapy versus biopsy and radiation/chemotherapy prolongs survival in GBM. Recently Sawaya et al. reported a 13-month median survival times for GBM patients undergoing surgery or biopsy.<sup>9</sup> The randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing BCNU chemotherapy versus radiotherapy, as adjuvant treatment for GBM,<sup>8</sup> was paramount in setting treatment guidelines for the role of post-operative XRT in the treatment of malignant gliomas. However, similar standards have yet to be established for the role of surgical resection in the treatment of high-grade gliomas.

Because of the limited availability and success of the current treatment of GBM, the elucidation of the molecular pathways involved in gliomagenesis has become a foremost priority over the past several years with the goal of developing biological therapies. Recent technological advancements, including the development of sophisticated, high-throughput genetic screening mechanisms, has facilitated the discovery of several pathways involved in glioma and brain tumor formation. The aim of this review, is thus both to provide an overview of the key cell signaling pathways involved in gliomagenesis as well as to introduce some potential molecular-targeted therapies for the treatment of GBM.

## PATHWAYS TO GLIOMA FORMATION

Low-grade astrocytomas (WHO Grade II) display a marked propensity to infiltrate into surrounding normal brain tissue, often preventing a complete surgical resection of the affected region. Standard therapeutic regimens of chemotherapy and radiation have yielded generally unsatisfactory results. The impetus for new therapeutic strategies has been driven by the ever-increasing knowledge base concerning the genetics of glioma progression. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO Grade IV astrocytoma) is commonly subdivided on the basis of clinical presentation into either primary/de novo GBM or secondary GBM. Primary GBM presents as high grade GBM in the absence of clinically detectable earlier lower grade lesions, whilst secondary GBM develops progressively from lower grade astrocytoma over a clinical course of generally 5–10 years.<sup>10,11</sup> The distinction in the clinical course of the presentation of these tumours is also mirrored in the genetic lesions that correlate with the developmental stages of astrocytoma development. In spite of the documented differences in particular genetic abnormalities associated with primary or secondary glioblastoma, these differences can all be grouped into genetic abnormalities that affect two fundamental cellular processes, that of signal transduction and control of the cell cycle (Table 1).

## Deregulated Signalling

Two key components of growth factor signalling pathways, the growth factors themselves and/or their cognate receptors are often overexpressed or mutated in gliomas (Fig. 1). The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A and B, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), and insulin like-growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are commonly found associated with gliomas and thought to provide an autocrine and/or paracrine boost to tumour growth.<sup>12–18</sup> The corresponding receptors EGFR, PDGFR-α/-β and IGFR are often associated with these tumours, with amplification and/or mutation of EGFR linked with primary GBM and overexpression of PDGFR-α is linked with progression of secondary GBM. Activation of the receptors leads to propagation of the stimulus down three main intracellular protein cascades, the RAS/

RAF/MAPK(ERK) pathway, the PI3K/AKT pathway and the PLC-γ/PKC pathway. These pathways influence a diverse array of vital cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, shape, movement, cell death and metabolism. Key downstream effectors of these pathways are also commonly mutated or deregulated in GBM. Loss of function of the tumour suppressor protein PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10) is commonly associated with primary GBM but rarely with secondary GBM. PTEN dephosphorylates the key lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3, a PI3K product) and hence serves to deactivate signalling emanating via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Analysis of GBM tissue microarrays has recently revealed that loss of PTEN is highly correlated with activation of AKT, which in turn is highly correlated with activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein. mTOR is an important effector of AKT signalling which controls the translation of specific mRNAs required for cell proliferation and transformation. Other important signalling mediators such as STAT family transcription factors which have a role in EGFR and PDGFR signalling have also been

Fig. 1 Pathways involved in GBM formation. Although primary and secondary GBMs are histologically indistinguishable, it is well-accepted that distinct molecular aberrations and pathways lead to the formation of primary (de novo) versus secondary GBMs. Primary GBMs are thought to arise in a de novo manner, without any cancerous precursor lesion. Amplification of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is thought to be critical event in the molecular etiology of primary GBMs. Secondary GBMs, on the other hand, are thought to arise as a result of the malignant transformation of lower grade gliomas, with overexpression of PDGF, FGF2, and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM.

implicated in glioma development. STAT3α hyperactivation has been reported in a significant percentage of gliomas and medulloblastomas.²⁵

# LOSS OF CELL CYCLE CONTROL

There are two key regulatory pathways whose activity guards cells from unchecked progression through the cell cycle (Fig. 2). The two principal proteins of these pathways are the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and p53. Phosphorylation of RB by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 or 6-cyclin D1 complex leads to transcription of genes necessary for cell cycle progression past the G1 restriction point. Similarly, p53 guards cells from inappropriate progression through cell cycle checkpoints in G1 and G2 and can also commit cells to apoptosis. Two tumor suppressor proteins surprisingly encoded by the same genetic locus, p16INK4A and p14ARF, in turn, separately control activity of these pathways. p16INK4A blocks RB phosphorylation by inhibiting the CDK4/6-cyclin D1 complex, hence preventing transcription of genes necessary to progress through the G1 restriction point. P14ARF, on the other hand, prevents MDM2-related degradation of p53, ensuring that p53 is present to inhibit uncontrolled progression through the cell cycle (see Fig. 3).

Interestingly, genomic abnormalities/mutations in distinct genes associated with these pathways cluster with the subtype of GBM. *De novo* or primary GBMs are associated with abnormalities in the INK4a-ARF locus²⁶–²⁸ thereby preventing appropriate expression of the two tumor suppressor proteins p16INK4A and p14ARF. Loss of this locus is often found associated with activating mutations and/or amplification in the EGFR locus and clinically these tumors usually present in older patients, are highly malignant and are generally diploid.²⁹–³³

**Fig. 2** Key signaling pathways downstream of growth factor receptors. Activation of the receptor by growth factor binding initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and activation of the small GTPase, Ras. PI3K activates AKT leading to activation of the mTOR kinase resulting in cell survival and inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins. Protein kinase C (PKC) activity can induce both cell migration and mitosis, whilst activation of MAPK(ERK 1/2) induces transcription of genes vital for proliferation. The PTEN tumor suppressor protein negatively regulates AKT activation and is commonly mutated in primary GBMs along with mutations in the growth factor receptor EGFR.

**Fig. 3** Regulatory control of the cell cycle. The events at both the G₁ and G₂ checkpoints are highlighted. Molecules depicted in red are known or putative tumor suppressor proteins, those in green are positive for growth and known or potential oncogenes. The two proteins derived from the INK4a-ARF locus, p16INK4A and p14ARF control the cell cycle inhibitory activity of the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and p53. p16INK4A prevents Rb phosphorylation by inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 or 6-cyclin D1 complex, releasing the E2F transcription factor which drives transcription of genes necessary for cell cycle progression. p14ARF protects p53 from mdm2-mediated degradation enabling p53 to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the stimuli. The INK4a-ARF locus is inactivated in 60% of GBMs, with p53 mutations common in the remaining 40% of GBMs.

Intriguingly, the clinically distinct secondary GBMs have lesions in different effector genes of the same cell cycle pathways. These tumors usually have normal INK4a-ARF loci but have an amplified CDK4 locus or have a non-functional RB gene and frequently also possess an amplified mdm2 locus or a mutated p53 gene. Clinically these tumors have an earlier onset of presentation, are not as aggressive and are rather aneuploid than diploid.³⁴–³⁶,³⁷ Consequently, in high-grade gliomas both cell-cycle regulatory pathways are disrupted, regardless of the developmental path of glioma formation. However, disruptions at distinct levels of these pathways segregate with the two distinct types of GBM. Whether these distinctions at the molecular level are contributory factors in the pathological development of these tumors is still to be ascertained.

## EXPERIMENTAL MODELS OF GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME

Analysis of primary GBM tissue samples has now documented a wealth of signature genetic changes associated with gliomas arising from the two pathological variants of GBM. The fundamental question as to whether these abnormalities are causative of the underlying lesions or merely associated with the overall genetic instability prevalent in neoplasms has only recently begun to be addressed.

The modern techniques of introducing defined genetic abnormalities in a temporally and spatially controlled manner in the mouse have enabled, for the first time, some of these fundamental issues to be addressed. Two issues though, temper the enthusiasm with which these models can address the etiological basis of

glioblastoma formation. One is the heterogeneous histological profile of GBM and secondly that the histopathological hallmarks of human GBM, namely, infiltrative growth, highly angiogenic, necrosis, nuclear atypia, nuclear polymorphism and high mitotic index<sup>10</sup> may not be so readily applicable in mouse models.

As has been already noted<sup>38</sup> some mouse models designed to mimic astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma formation, exhibit many of the features associated with more malignant gliomas, such as infiltrative growth, necrosis and angiogenic cell proliferation.<sup>38</sup> To date though, two mouse models have been generated whose neoplastic lesions exhibit many of the accepted criteria for true GBM. The first such model was based on the restricted delivery of mutant and hyperactive alleles of K-Ras and Akt to neuroglial precursor cells.<sup>39</sup>

Ras and Akt are two key signal amplifying proteins, functioning at the apex of a major cellular proliferative pathway the Ras/Raf/MAPK(ERK) cascade and an important cell survival pathway, the growth factor receptor-PI3K cascade, respectively. Both these pathways are constitutively activated in a large subset of primary gliomas.<sup>20,31,40</sup> Forced expression of either oncogene alone was not sufficient to induce tumour formation. Similarly, no tumours were induced by the combination of both oncogenes when expression was restricted to GFAP-expressing astrocytes.<sup>39</sup> These results have demonstrated the importance of activation of complimentary signaling cascades in GBM tumour formation and have underlined the susceptibility of certain progenitor cell types to be, as it were, predisposed to glioma transformation.

With respect to the utility of this model for the testing of prospective targeted therapies for GBM, it seems salient to keep in mind that activated Ras or AKT mutations have not been detected in the vast majority of primary GBM tissue samples or cell lines that have been analysed.<sup>41,42</sup> Rather it would appear that the glioma relevant activation points of the Ras/Raf/MAPK(ERK) pathway is via mutation or amplification of RTKs, such as the EGFR, and of the growth factor receptor-PI3K pathway by loss of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene. One may speculate that a combination of activated EGFR and PTEN loss in nestin expressing neuroglial progenitor cells would lead to unequivocal glioma formation in the mouse and provide a pre-clinically more relevant model for the testing of targeted therapies against primary GBM.

A similar reservation can be leveled at the second model developed to induce brain tumour formation in the mouse. Breeding of mice with targeted deletion of the p53 gene with mice with loss of the neurofibromatosis 1 gene, *Nf1*. Cis-heterozygotes were developed which eventually led to the development of astrocytomas and glioblastomas of varying frequency.<sup>43</sup> However, the combination of the loss of both of these genes has not been found in either primary or secondary human glioblastomas.<sup>44</sup> Hence the utility of this model for the preclinical testing of targeted therapeutics appears to be limited.

repertoire of signal transducing proteins than the wild type receptor, contributing to the development and/or maintenance of the malignant phenotype.<sup>48,49</sup> Given that enhanced signalling emanating from the mutant receptor may well contribute to the disease state, inhibitors specifically targeted to reduce the kinase activity of the EGFR would be an appropriate starting point for a rationally designed treatment regimen. Trials using such compounds are well underway and some early results have already been reported. Clinical responses have been reported in about 20% of patients with malignant glioma in a trial of OSI-774 (Tarceva) a small molecule antagonist of the kinase catalytic domain of EGFR. A phase II trial of the efficacy of the drug in an expanded treatment group is currently underway. It is to be hoped that a detailed analysis of the tumours samples of both responsive and non-responsive patients with respect to EGFR activation status will be undertaken to enable assessment of the potential real efficacy of the drug.

### TARGETED THERAPIES: mTOR INHIBITORS

The serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is now being actively investigated as a target of therapeutic intervention for human cancer. Low concentrations of rapamycin, a bacterially derived natural product, can arrest cell cycling at the G1 checkpoint. The mechanism involves specific inhibition of the kinase phosphorylation activity of mTOR. The relevance for GBM and primary glioblastoma in particular, is that activation of the growth factor receptor-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway appears to be the major signaling input controlling activation of mTOR. Diverse cancer cell types in culture undergo G1 arrest when exposed to nanomolar concentrations of rapamycin, the same concentration observed to inhibit mTOR activity in cells.<sup>50</sup> Even though aberrant forms of mTOR have not been found in any human cancer samples, preclinical observations suggest that tumours having abnormalities in the growth factor receptor-PI3K/ AKT pathway are in fact dependent on mTOR. PTEN null tumours are sensitive to mTOR inhibition in human and mouse tumour models.<sup>51–54</sup> Similarly the transforming effect of oncogenic AKT but not Myc or Ras can be reversed by mTOR inhibitors.<sup>55</sup> Tumour formation in *in vivo* conditional PTEN knockout or transgenic AKT mouse models is sensitive to mTOR inhibitors.<sup>50,56</sup>

It would now appear an attractive proposition to molecularly stratify primary GBM patients exhibiting activated EGFR signalling as well as PTEN loss for combination mTOR and EGFR inhibitor therapy. The combination therapy would appear doubly attractive as perturbations in the PTEN pathway can alter the cellular response to inhibitors of the EGFR pathway.<sup>57,58</sup>

### CONCLUSION

Despite the challenges and controversy associated with the treatment of GBM, recent technological advances have led to the elucidation of several important cell signaling pathways involved in the molecular pathogenesis of GBM and brain tumors in general. Identifying such pathways, along with the advent and widespread utilization of high-throughput molecular screening techniques, such as DNA microarray chip analysis, means the potential for new molecular and gene-targeted therapies for GBM is promising.

### PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION IN SIGNALLING PATHWAYS

In approximately 40% to 60% of primary GBM cases, mutations in the EGFR gene, generally in the context of gene amplification, occur.<sup>18,40,45–47</sup> Mutations in the EGFR gene itself tend to cluster in the extracellular region of the RTK gene that prevent binding of the ligand to the mutant receptor. Three main clusters of deletions have been mapped associated with glioblastoma; deletions of amino acids 6–273, present in 70% of all EGFR mutations, truncation at amino acid 958 (15%) and deletion of amino acids 521–603 (15%). In spite of the heterogeneity of the recorded mutations a constitutively activated EGFR kinase activity results. It is also been suggested that these mutant EGFR proteins can activate an expanded
