The mammalian circadian timing system is composed of almost as many individual clocks as there are cells. These countless oscillators have to be synchronized by a central pacemaker to coordinate temporal physiology and behavior. Recently, there has been some progress in understanding the relationship and communication mechanisms between central and peripheral clocks.

Imagine being startled in your sleep by a ravenous desire for food in the middle of the night. Imagine feeling hyperactive when you only wish to relax after dinner—or falling asleep during an important conference (OK, bad example...). How are the functions of all of our organs synchronized to achieve coordinated circadian physiology and behavior? Answers to this fascinating question may soon be within reach. There has been a profound change in the way we look at circadian rhythms following the revelation that circadian clocks tick in almost all metazoan cell types (Reppert and Weaver, 2002), similar to the situation reported for plants some time ago (Golden and Strayer, 2001). We therefore have to abandon the classical view of a unique circadian pacemaker orchestrating all overt rhythms in physiology and behavior. Instead, this master clock—which in mammals resides in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)—must synchronize countless peripheral oscillators to ensure temporally coordinated physiology. Moreover, the peripheral oscillators may be connected among themselves and may even communicate back to the SCN.

One feature that has remained immutable since life appeared on Earth is the rotation of the earth around its own axis—although the period length of the photoperiod has shortened somewhat since then. Circadian clocks allow their owners to anticipate daily events (e.g., food availability and predator pressure for animals, sun rise for plants) rather than just reacting to them. However, as circadian pacemakers can measure time only approximately, their phase has to be adjusted every day in order to stay in synchrony with geophysical time. Not surprisingly, light is the dominant entraining cue for all circadian timekeepers, encompassing those in unicellular organisms all the way to those in mammals. In some animals, such as *Drosophila* and zebrafish, even peripheral oscillators can be entrained directly by light-dark cycles (Giebultowicz, 2001; Whitmore et al., 2000). Obviously, this simple scenario is only possible in organisms in which at least some photons reach all internal organs. The evolution of larger and thus opaque organisms necessitated the development of different, nonphotic (in addition to photic) entrainment pathways. In mammals, this was accomplished by a highly specialized master pacemaker in the SCN, which receives photic input from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract and conveys this timing information to the entire organism via direct and indirect signaling pathways (see Figure 1).

So what are the molecular timing cues by which the SCN synchronizes the countless clocks in peripheral cell types? The search for these effector molecules has just started, and it will perhaps reveal novel components of our endocrine system. Here we want to highlight some current issues related to this topic and provide some food for thought. A number of excellent recent review articles are available for a comprehensive description of physiological and molecular aspects of the circadian clock (see, for example, Reppert and Weaver, 2002).

## Many Levels of Timekeeping

Numerous studies in recent years have revealed that the genes driving molecular oscillations differ between different kingdoms, perhaps suggesting multiple independent origins of circadian clock evolution. However, an essential functional hallmark is widespread: the genetic elements that constitute the rhythm-generating mechanism appear to be organized in autoregulatory feedback loops in all organisms examined (Reppert and Weaver, 2002). How this mechanism has evolved several times independently remains a puzzle, but it is possible that it originated very early in evolution, when most cells were light sensitive. The existence of light-sensitive cellular oscillators in many peripheral organs of *Drosophila* and zebrafish may still be a relic of this early evolution (Giebultowicz, 2001; Whitmore et al., 2000). In fact, light-responsive circadian clocks are operative not only in isolated organ cultures of these animals, but in the case of zebrafish, even in immortalized cell lines (Pando et al., 2001). Peripheral mammalian cell types also contain functional circadian oscillators, but these do not respond to light-dark cycles. Rather, the mammalian circadian oscillators are sensitive to a variety of chemical cues or to temperature cycles (Balsalobre et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2002). The identification of daily oscillators in cells kept ex vivo suggests that peripheral tissue clocks can manifest a remarkable independence from so-called master clocks, in particular in animals with light-entrainable peripheral oscillators. For example, in *Drosophila*, the daily fluctuations in the sensitivity of olfaction can be recorded in chemosensory cells of severed antennae kept in organ culture. Furthermore, Malpighian tubes (which are part of the excretory system of *Drosophila*) retain their phase of circadian gene expression when transplanted into a host that was light-entrained to an opposite phase prior to transplantation.

Figure 1. Phase Setting of Central and Peripheral Circadian Clocks in Nocturnal Rodents

SCN neurons receive light information directly from retina cells via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). This photic entrainment corrects the phase of the SCN oscillator every day to ensure synchronization of circadian with geophysical time. The SCN synchronizes peripheral clocks in organs such as liver, heart, and kidney via direct and indirect routes. Indirect synchronization is accomplished by controlling daily activity-rest cycles and, as a consequence, feeding time. Feeding (or starving) cycles are dominant Zeitgebers for many, if not most, peripheral clocks. Food metabolites, such as glucose, and hormones related to feeding and starvation are probably the feeding-dependent entrainment cues. Activity cycles also influence body temperature rhythms, which in turn can participate in the phase entrainment of peripheral clocks. Direct entrainment may employ cyclically secreted hormones and perhaps neuronal signals conveyed to peripheral clocks via the peripheral nervous system. Body temperature rhythms, which are controlled in part by the SCN, may also contribute to the synchronization of peripheral clocks.

Activity rhythms can feed back on the SCN by modifying period length and phase. As indicated in the model, light can directly suppress activity in nocturnal rodents and thereby generate cyclic locomotor activity even in clockless animals, provided that these are kept in LD cycles.

Thus, when these transplanted flies are kept in constant darkness, *timeless* and *period* transcription oscillate with opposite phases in the grafted and host tissues (Giebultowicz, 2001). In animals, where peripheral clocks cannot be entrained by photic cues, the phase entrainment of circadian clocks may involve both cell-to-cell communication within a specific tissue (at least in some tissues) and tissue-to-tissue communication within an organism (see below).

In addition to the circadian timers, cells contain at least one additional well-known oscillator: the cell cycle clock. Interestingly, feedback loops also constitute an essential device for a number of molecular components of the cell cycle machinery. The generation time of many mammalian cells is roughly a day. Is this similarity between the period lengths of circadian rhythms and cell cycle clocks just fortuitous, or does it suggest an evolutionary link between the two? While in the unicellular flagellate algae *Euglena gracilis*, the cell division cycle is clearly controlled by the circadian clock (Mohabir and Edmunds, 1998), such a scenario has not yet been established for mammalian cells. Nevertheless, recent findings suggest that a relationship between these two types of cycles does exist. Mice deficient in the essential clock gene *mPer2* are cancer prone and display a deregulated temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, and Mdm-2 (Fu et al., 2002). These mice display salivary gland hyperplasia, and a large fraction of them develop lymphomas. The development of lymphomas in *mPer2* mutant mice is further exacerbated after irradiation with γ-rays. The discovery that an essential clock gene is associated with proliferation control is in keeping with previous observations on the circadian synchronization of rapidly proliferating tissues. The use of these findings

in chronopharmacology is likely to be significant for chemotherapy in cancer patients, as the efficacy and/or toxicity of the antiproliferative drugs may depend on the circadian timing of treatment. While it appears that the molecular circuitries of circadian and cell cycle clocks have evolved in a similar, occasionally overlapping fashion, it should be emphasized that in some organisms, proliferation and circadian timing are completely uncoupled. In cyanobacteria, for instance, the cell division time is only a fraction (about 6 hr) of the period length of circadian rhythms. Hence, under constant light or constant dark conditions, the daughter cells have to keep track of the circadian time of their mother cells after cell division (Kondo and Ishiura, 2000).

A third cellular clock, generating ultradian oscillations, may also tick in many mammalian cell types. The activity of this novel oscillator can be monitored by recording the temporal accumulation of the transcriptional repressor HES-1. Both Hes-1 mRNA and HES-1 protein cycle with a period length of about two hours and decay with very short half-lives of about 20 min. Similar to the circadian oscillator, the Hes-1 oscillator can be activated in tissue culture cells by a serum shock. HES-1 appears to establish a negative autoregulatory loop by periodically repressing the transcription of its own gene (Hirata et al., 2002), similar to the mechanism observed for some components of the circadian clock. It is not yet clear whether the Hes-1 clock is active in cells of adult animals, but cyclic Hes-1 expression is associated with the somite clock, which determines the timing of segmentation during early embryogenesis (see Hirata et al., 2002, and references therein).

**The Food and Time Connection**

Similar to what has been observed in *Drosophila* and zebrafish, mammalian peripheral tissues can maintain
circadian gene expression for a few days when kept ex vivo. In fact, the phase of peripheral oscillators can be completely uncoupled from the SCN master pacemaker, even in intact animals (Damiola et al., 2000; Stokkan et al., 2001). For example, in nocturnal rodents (rats and mice) fed for a week or so exclusively during daytime, the phase of circadian gene expression becomes completely inverted in tissues such as liver, kidney, heart, and pancreas. However, feeding time does not influence the phase of the SCN master clock (Damiola et al., 2000; Stokkan et al., 2001), irrespective of whether the animals subjected to restricted feeding are kept in LD (light-dark cycles) or in DD (constant darkness). Although the phase adaptation of peripheral organs to daytime feeding is slow, the phase reversal is almost immediate in animals switched back from daytime to nighttime feeding. This difference in the kinetics of phase adaptation can be explained by glucocorticoid hormone signaling. In the absence of the glucocorticoid receptor or of glucocorticoid hormones (corticosterones in rodents), the phases of peripheral oscillators adapt very quickly to the daytime feeding regimens. Hence, the rhythmic secretion of corticosterone appears to inhibit the uncoupling of peripheral clocks from the central pacemaker (Le Minh et al., 2001).

Although feeding time has been established as a dominant Zeitgeber (timing cue) for the oscillators in several peripheral tissues, the mechanisms by which feeding synchronizes these clocks are still poorly understood. In fact, it is not yet clear whether rhythmic feeding or rhythmic fasting imposes the phase on peripheral oscillators; both could potentially play a role. Conceivably, the food-dependent synchronization of peripheral clocks may involve the redox-sensing properties of CLOCK and NPAS2, two transcription factors of the rhythm-generating molecular feedback loops. In vitro, the binding of these two proteins to their DNA cognate sequences (so-called E boxes) is strictly dependent on the ratio of reduced to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides [NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+] (Rutter et al., 2001). The balance of this ratio is influenced by energy metabolism. Furthermore, according to a recent study, glucose can suppress Per1 and Per2 gene expression and thereby induce circadian oscillator function in starved tissue culture cells (Hirota et al., 2002). Daily oscillations in glucose uptake and utilization may therefore participate in food-dependent synchronization of peripheral oscillators, conceivably via the redox mechanism mentioned above. Hormones related to feeding, such as glucagon, insulin, and glucocorticoids, are also likely candidates for use in phase setting of peripheral clocks. Indeed, given the multitude of signaling pathways inducing circadian rhythms in tissue culture cells, it is likely that a variety of different pathways are also used in vivo to synchronize peripheral clocks. Finally, entrainment by chemical cues may be reinforced by body temperature rhythms. Indeed, natural body temperature cycles recorded by telemetry in mice can sustain circadian oscillations in gene expression for a few days. Moreover, temperature cycles of environmental temperature—hot during the night and cold during the day—that are opposite to the natural rhythm can shift the phases of circadian oscillators in peripheral mouse tissues. Again, the phase of the SCN master clock is not influenced by changes in ambient temperature rhythms (Brown et al.,

2002). The direct and indirect pathways by which the central SCN pacemaker may entrain peripheral circadian clocks in mammals are illustrated in Figure 1.

**The SCN: The Orchestra’s Conductor?**

In SCN lesioned rodents, circadian gene expression ceases in peripheral tissues (Reppert and Weaver, 2002). Hence, humoral and, perhaps, neuronal signals emitted from the SCN are required for long-term maintenance of circadian gene expression in the periphery of intact animal. Implants of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice with different genotypes (Pando et al., 2002) may prove a powerful tool in the identification of SCN-controlled signaling pathways. Using this approach, it was possible to demonstrate that under normal physiological conditions, the SCN is able to rescue or compensate for genetic defects affecting the period of peripheral clocks. Thus, peripheral clocks are subordinate to the dominance exerted by the central clock and can adjust both phase and period length according to the rhythm imposed by the SCN. Interestingly, feeding time acts as a strong Zeitgeber for circadian gene expression in MEF implants, similar to normal host tissues. The MEF implant approach will enable studies using cells carrying targeted mutations in genes encoding various components of particular signaling cascades, such as the ones involving MAP kinases or the transcription factor CREB (to mention just two examples).

The first convincing evidence for diffusible phase-entraining signals emanating from the SCN was obtained in grafting experiments in which the donor SCN tissue was encapsulated into porous plastic prior to implantation (Silver et al., 1996). In these assays, locomotor activity was used as a readout for the influence of the implanted SCN on the circadian output system. More recently, two strong candidates for such diffusible factors have been identified: TGFα and prokineticin 2 (PK2) (Kramer et al., 2001; Cheng et al., 2002). Both of these polypeptides are produced and secreted in a circadian fashion by SCN neurons. Moreover, TGFα and PK2 dramatically suppress locomotor activity in hamsters and rats, respectively, when infused into the third ventricle of the brain. These properties make TGFα and PK2 excellent candidates for diffusible signals by which the SCN imposes rest-activity cycles. The cyclic secretion of these two polypeptides may not only affect hypothalamic regions in the proximity of the SCN, but may also act through tissues distal from the SCN. For example, PK2 receptors are not only scattered throughout the brain, but are also found in gastrointestinal muscle cells. The EGF receptor, which is involved in TGFα signaling, displays an even wider spatial expression pattern. It will be interesting to examine whether these two signaling proteins are capable of affecting circadian gene expression in tissue culture systems.

In conclusion, the hierarchically dominant position of the SCN is impressive, but limited. We like to think of it as an orchestra’s conductor, using a large repertoire of gestures to set the timing of individual musicians in playing their instruments. However, the success of the symphony not only depends on the signs given by the director, but also on the capacity of the individual musicians to play their parts.

**Conclusions**

The remarkable progress that the field of circadian biology has witnessed in the past few years should not blind
us. The identification of some essential clock genes and the discovery of peripheral oscillators have significantly advanced our understanding, but our picture of the circadian timing system is far from being complete. Our attempts to establish an inventory of clock components have just started, and we expect that numerous important clock genes still await identification. Moreover, as pointed out here, we still need to couple clock protein expression to specific signal transduction cascades and to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which these pathways influence circadian gene expression and overt rhythms in physiology and behavior. These endeavors will necessitate the use of the most advanced tools in genetics, genomics, proteomics, physiology, and behavior. Indeed, one of the major attractions of the field lies in its multidisciplinarity. We thus anticipate that future attempts toward the elucidation of the circadian timing system will not only bring us many additional and exciting surprises, but will also reward us with immense fun.
