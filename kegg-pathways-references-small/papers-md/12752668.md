## Summary

A main pathway used by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells to eliminate pathogenic cells is via exocytosis of granule components in the direction of the target cell, delivering a lethal hit of cytolytic molecules. Amongst these, granzyme B and perforin have been shown to induce CTL-mediated target cell DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. Once released from the CTL, granzyme B binds its receptor, the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor, and is endocytosed but remains arrested in endocytic vesicles until released by perforin. Once in the cytosol, granzyme B targets caspase-3 directly or indirectly through the mitochondria, initiating the caspase cascade to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. Caspase activity is required for apoptosis to occur; however, in the absence of caspase activity, granzyme B can still initiate mitochondrial events via the cleavage of Bid. Recent work shows that granzyme B-mediated release of apoptotic factors from the mitochondria is essential for the full activation of caspase-3. Thus, granzyme B acts at multiple points to initiate the death of the offending cell. Studies of the granzyme B death receptor and internal signaling pathways may lead to critical advances in cell transplantation and cancer therapy.

## Introduction

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are one of the major cytotoxic effector cells of the immune system. They destroy virus-infected and malignantly transformed cells before widespread viral infection or cancer can ensue. However, CTL activity can also be harmful to the individual in cases of autoimmune disease, graft rejection, and graft-versus-host disease. Therefore, it is important to understand how CTLs destroy their targets and how this activity can be controlled. Knowledge in this area will help promote the development of new therapeutics for fighting diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, cancer, and diabetes.

Two main mechanisms of CTL-mediated target cell lysis have been extensively studied: receptor- and granule-mediated. The principal receptor pathway that has been described in CTLs involves the Fas-Fas ligand system. Fas ligand (FasL) on activated CTLs engages the Fas receptor on target cells, causing them to undergo apoptotic cell death. However, this system is thought to be more important in the control the CTL immune response, although it can mediate

target cell lysis under certain conditions. The major mechanism for CTL-mediated destruction of target cells involves the delivery of cytolytic effector molecules. These proteins, including perforin and granzymes, are stored in the cytoplasmic granules of CTLs and are released during CTL-mediated target cell lysis. The main CTL granule component implicated in rapid DNA fragmentation, a hallmark feature of apoptosis, is granzyme B. There has been a tremendous increase in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CTL killing that has come from experiments performed by numerous laboratories, and these studies have recently been reviewed (1–3). This review summarizes the contributions made by our research group to the understanding of granzyme B-mediated apoptosis.

### A role for granzyme B in CTL-mediated cytotoxicity

CTLs have been described to form conjugates with target cells and deliver a 'lethal hit' of cytolytic molecules, resulting in target cell lysis (4). These cytolytic molecules were found to be stored in the cytoplasmic granules of the CTL. One of the first CTL granule components to be identified was perforin or cytolysin (5). It was demonstrated that perforin polymerized and inserted itself into the target cell membrane, forming pores through which small ions and solutes could pass. The result is the destruction of normal cellular gradients and ultimately the osmotic lysis of the target cell (Fig. 1). Indeed, knocking out the perforin gene in mice showed an absolute requirement for this molecule in granule-mediated killing (6). Importantly, however, CTLs were shown to induce apoptosis or DNA fragmentation in their target cells, whereas perforin alone could only cause membrane damage (7). This finding led to the hypothesis that there must be some other granule component of the CTL that passes through the pores formed by perforin, resulting in DNA fragmentation and cell death (8).

Our laboratory focused on identifying genes that were specific to the CTL that may be involved in its effector function (9). We were able to identify these CTL-specific genes by reasoning that function-related mRNAs would not be expressed in other T-cell subsets or in inactivated T lymphocytes. A cDNA library generated from the CTL-cell line MTL 2.8.2 was screened with probes synthesized from the mRNA of killer cells, helper cells, and thymocytes. After extensive analysis, two CTL-specific genes, B10 and C11, were identified that encoded proteins that belonged to a new family of serine proteases. C11 in particular was found to encode cytotoxic cell proteinase I (CCPI), now known as granzyme B. The expression of CCPI correlated closely with the induction of CTL cytotoxicity (10). Subsequently, CCPI was localized to the cytoplasmic granules of the CTL, making it a prime candidate molecule involved in CTL-mediated target cell lysis (11). A key discovery came from Greenberg's laboratory, which showed that granzyme B and perforin induced rapid DNA fragmentation in target cells (12). In addition, transfection of the rat basophilic cell line (RBL) with perforin and granzyme B rendered the RBL capable of cytolytic activity (13). Granzyme B knockout cells further confirmed a role for granzyme B in the rapid induction of DNA fragmentation observed in target cell lysis (14). From these findings, it appeared that both the granule components, perforin and granzyme B were required in order to mediate CTL killing. In the revised model of CTL killing, polymerization and insertion of perforin in the target cell membrane formed pores through which granzyme B could pass and activate substrates, culminating in DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1).

(B) Later, it was discovered that perforin alone was not enough to mediate all of the features of CTL-mediated killing; however, in combination with granzyme B, it could lead to apoptosis.

**Intracellular substrates for granzyme B**

Caspase-dependent pathway to cell death (caspase-3)

It was known that granzyme B played a key role in CTL-mediated target cell DNA fragmentation and subsequent cell death; however, target cell substrates for granzyme B were still unknown. Using comparative molecular modeling and mutagenesis analysis, we were able to show that granzyme B cleaved after aspartic acid residues (15). At the time, this specificity was unique amongst eukaryotic serine proteases, and the only other known eukaryotic protease with this substrate specificity was interleukin-1β-converting enzyme
(ICE, caspase-1). ICE was the first of a family of cysteine proteases defined by their structural features as well as by their cleavage after aspartic acid residues.

The structural similarities between ICE and ced-3, found in the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* to be critical in the developmental programmed cell death of the worm, hinted at a role for ICE in mammalian cell death (16–18). The ICE/ced-3 cysteine proteases are now collectively referred to as caspases and have been shown to be involved in DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell death (19). These caspases were also shown to be synthesized as inactive precursors that required cleavage at aspartate residues to produce two subunits, which together formed the active protease (20). The fact that caspases required cleavage at aspartate residues made them excellent potential substrates for granzyme B. The first such caspase studied, ICE or caspase-1, was found not to be cleaved by granzyme B, indicating that others were more important for the induction of apoptosis than ICE itself (21). Indeed, we discovered that granzyme B cleaved and activated CPP32 (Apopain), now commonly referred to as caspase-3 (22). We used lysates from the CTL line MTL 2.8.2 and showed that granzyme B, not granzyme A, cleaved and activated CPP32. The physiologic relevance of these results was then confirmed when we discovered that CPP32 was cleaved in vivo in cells under attack by CTLs. Further studies with granzyme B knockout mice showed conclusively that caspase-3 is cleaved and activated by granzyme B (23). Subsequently, caspase-6, -7, -8, -9, and -10 were also shown to be substrates for granzyme B in vitro (24–29), but caspase-3 is believed to be the most important caspase substrate in vivo (23, 30).

Caspase-3 was initially found to be responsible for the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and then described as a major effector of apoptosis (31). At the time of this discovery, it was proposed that the cleavage of PARP by granzyme B-activated caspase-3 (CPP32) during CTL-mediated apoptosis could lead to the inhibition of DNA repair and other events related to cell death. More recently, it has been shown that gelsolin, involved in the maintenance of the cytoskeleton, and the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) are also substrates for caspase-3, resulting in cytoskeletal changes and DNA fragmentation, respectively, that are hallmark features of apoptosis (Fig. 2A) (32, 33).

Studies on the Fas/FasL pathway of CTL-mediated target cell lysis showed that when FasL engages Fas on the target cell, caspase-8 is recruited to the Fas complex, resulting in the cleavage and activation of the enzyme (34, 35). Many other caspases, including caspase-3, have been shown to be substrates for caspase-8, and the possibility existed that

caspase-3 could be directly cleaved by granzyme B or indirectly through the activation of caspase-8 (36). We were able to show that the cleavage of caspase-3 during granule-mediated cell death was insensitive to caspase inhibitors, suggesting that caspase-3 can be directly cleaved by granzyme B (30). However, we also observed that caspase inhibition decreased DNA fragmentation but not membrane damage, indicating that there were probably other substrates for granzyme B.

Caspase-independent pathway to cell death (Bid and the mitochondria)

While granzyme B was known to initiate apoptosis via caspase-3, in recent years there has been evidence showing that granule-dependent killing can occur through caspase-independent means (37, 38). Some of the key features of granule-mediated apoptosis that have been described include the following: DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, and the loss of inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (∆Ψm), resulting in the release of cytochrome c (20). Using caspase inhibitors, our group observed an inhibition of granzyme B-mediated DNA fragmentation, PS externalization, and reactive oxygen species production (39). However, caspase inhibition was unable to prevent granzyme B-mediated ∆Ψm collapse and cytochrome c release, resulting in cell death by necrosis rather than apoptosis. We hypothesized that the evolution of multiple pathways in granzyme-mediated death developed to combat pathogens, such as viruses that express anti-apoptotic proteins. Thus, CTLs could still kill these infected cells via the necrotic pathway. It has been suggested that if caspases are active, granzyme B-mediated mitochondrial release of cytochrome c would lead to the formation of the apoptosome complex containing cytochrome c, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1, and pro-caspase-9. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), this apoptosome is able to create active caspase-9, which activates caspase-3, thus amplifying the caspase cascade (Fig. 2C) (20).

Subsequently, we demonstrated that granzyme B cleaved Bid resulting in a 14-kDa granzyme B-truncated product (gtBid) that translocated to the mitochondria (40). gtBid then recruits the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bax, to the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the release of cytochrome c (Fig. 2B) (41). Granzyme B-activated caspase-8 has also been shown to cleave Bid, resulting in a truncated product (tBid) that can also translocate to the mitochondria and result in cytochrome c release (42). However, granzyme B-mediated ∆Ψm

(A) Granzyme B can directly cleave pro-caspase-3, resulting in an active caspase-3. Once active, caspase-3 can cleave poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) and caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), leading to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis.

(B) Granzyme B can also directly cleave Bid, resulting in a truncated protein gtBid that along with Bax is translocated to the mitochondria. This translocation of gtBid and Bax results in the release of cytochrome c, and in the absence of caspase activity, it can lead to a necrotic form of cell death.

(C) Alternatively, in the presence of caspase activity, cytochrome c joins with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) and pro-caspase-9 to form the apoptosome. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), the apoptosome is able to create active caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3, thus linking the mitochondrial pathway to the caspase pathway and amplifying the caspase cascade, resulting in apoptosis.

collapse and cytochrome c release occur in the absence of caspase activity, indicating that granzyme B can act directly on Bid (39). At this point, it was known that granzyme B could initiate both the caspase-dependent (caspase-3) and -independent (Bid) pathways to cell death, but what remained to be determined was the relative importance of the two pathways. According to this model, granzyme B should be able to activate caspase-3 and thus initiate apoptosis independently of mitochondria. Surprisingly, we discovered that this was not the case. Jurkat cells that express Bcl-2 were protected from granzyme B-mediated destruction (43). A small percentage of these cells treated with granzyme B did eventually undergo apoptosis, however, without the release of cytochrome c. This finding indicated that granzyme B could circumvent the necessity, although inefficiently, for mitochondrial cytochrome c release by directly cleaving caspases and/or directly cleaving ICAD (44, 45).

It has been shown for death receptor-mediated apoptosis that some cell types are prone to death by a type I or type II pathway (46). In type I cells, activation of caspase-8 leads to the direct activation of caspase-3. This pathway is mitochondrial independent and is not inhibited by Bcl-2. However, in type II cells, activation of caspase-8 is not enough to result in the activation of caspase-3, and therefore caspase-8 must go on to initiate the mitochondrial pathway through the cleavage of Bid. A similar difference may occur in granule-mediated apoptosis. Whether or not granzyme B-mediated apoptosis goes through a mitochondrial or a more direct pathway to caspase-3 cleavage may also depend on the amount of granzyme B that is delivered from the CTL. However, we believe that the pathway involves proteins, other than cytochrome c, essential for apoptosis that are released from the mitochondria in a Bcl-2-inhibitable fashion. For example, mitochondrial release of SMAC/Diablo [second mitochondrial activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) binding protein with low isoelectric point (pI)] may also contribute to the induction of apoptosis by repressing the IAPs (47, 48). Our recent results reveal that caspase-3 is cleaved by granzyme B in Bcl-transfected cells, but full activation is attenuated. A similar blockade can be duplicated in vitro by supplementing a cell-free extract with X-linked IAP (XIAP) or in vivo through infection with an XIAP-adenovirus. Full caspase activation is only achieved in the presence of SMAC (unpublished data). Thus, once granzyme B is present in the cytoplasm, it can mediate the cleavage of caspase-3 to yield p20 and p10. However, full activation does not occur, because the self-catalytic activity of caspase-3 is inhibited by IAPs. This blockade is removed once SMAC or Omi is released from the mitochondria (Fig. 3). From these findings, it is apparent that granzyme B cleavage of Bid is critically important in the pathway. This key event results in the recruitment of Bid and Bax to the mitochondrial membrane and the release of important regulators of apoptosis such as cytochrome c, SMAC/Diablo, apoptosis inducing factor, and Omi (49, 50).

Once released into the cytoplasm, granzyme B directly cleaves Bid to form tBid that is translocated, along with Bax, to the mitochondrial membrane. This translocation of Bid and Bax to the mitochondria results in the release of second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC), which is able to disable X-linked IAP (XIAP), a caspase inhibitor, making pro-caspase-3 accessible to granzyme B cleavage and activation.

A receptor for granzyme B

For many years the accepted model for granzyme B entry into the target cell involved the polymerization of perforin, in the presence of calcium, and its insertion in the target cell membrane. This model was believed to form a channel or pore through which granzyme B could pass, gaining entry to the target cell cytoplasm and internal substrates (Fig. 4). The model has endured, despite the lack of experimental evidence that a macromolecular molecule such as granzyme B can pass through such a structure. Recent evidence that granzyme B enters the target cell independent of perforin has brought the traditional polyperforin pore model into question (51, 52). Our laboratory used confocal microscopy to demonstrate that fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated granzyme B entered the cell in the absence of perforin (52). The FITC-granzyme B passed through early endosomes (rab5-positive) and then accumulated within a novel compartment. However, granzyme B remained sequestered, and no apoptosis occurred until either perforin or replication-incompetent adenovirus was added. Adenovirus is known as a virus that can escape endosomes to reach the cytosol. Microinjection of granzyme B directly into the cytoplasm of target cells resulted in apoptosis, without the requirement of a second endosomolytic agent. These results suggest that granzyme B is able to enter the cell in the absence of perforin; however, perforin or some other endosomolytic agent is required to release granzyme B from the endosome. Once free in the cytoplasm, the enzyme can cleave key substrates and initiate the apoptotic program.

These results together with the finding that granzyme B could bind to the cell surface in a saturable manner suggested the existence of a receptor for granzyme B. This receptor could presumably bind granzyme B and facilitate its entry into the cell as well as aid in trafficking granzyme B to endocytic vesicles. A vital clue to the identity of the receptor came when we noted that despite identical enzymatic activities, granule-purified granzyme B was biologically active while recombinant granzyme B was not. This finding led to the hypothesis that there must be a post-translational modification of granzyme B that was required for biological activity. We discovered that dephosphorylation of the granule-purified granzyme B led to the loss of its biological activity, and this phosphorylation appeared to be on carbohydrate residues. Indeed, granzyme B was known to be post-translationally modified with mannose-6-phosphate, and this modification serves as a signal for targeting newly synthesized granzymes to the dense granules (53). We hypothesized that granzyme B interacts with the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) via its mannose 6-phosphorylated (M6P) residues and is taken up into the cell where it can mediate apoptosis upon release from endocytic vesicles. Both the cation-independent (CI) and the cation-dependent (CD) forms of the MPR bind granzymes. They are predominantly found within cells but are also known to cycle to the cell surface, where they bind M6P proteins. However, only the CI-MPR is thought to be effective in internalizing proteins. It is known for its role in binding and internalization of insulin growth factor-II but also binds acid hydrolases, the precursor form of transforming growth factor-β (pTGF-β), leukemia inhibitory factor and the herpes simplex virus (54–57).

In order to test our hypothesis that the MPR was the death receptor for granzyme B, we performed experiments using L-cells that were either MPR deficient (MPR⁻) or which over-expressed the two forms of the MPR (CI-MPR⁺ and CD-MPR⁺) (58). By using fluorescently labeled, granule-purified granzyme B and flow cytometry analysis, we found that granzyme B bound negligibly to cells deficient in the MPR but well to cells overexpressing both forms of the MPR (both CI- and CD-MPR). However, only the CI-MPR-positive cells were effective in internalizing granzyme B, and with the addition of adenovirus, apoptosis resulted. Granzyme B binding, uptake, and subsequent apoptosis were all blocked upon the addition of M6P or soluble CI-MPR, or after pretreatment of

granzyne B with phosphatases. These findings demonstrated that granzyme B interacts with the CI-MPR on the cell surface of target cells via its M6P residues, resulting in internalization and, upon the addition of adenovirus, apoptosis (Fig. 4). Our data showed excellent DNA fragmentation, a hallmark feature of apoptosis, in the CI-MPR-positive cells but not in the MPR-negative cells. However, both cell types did show extensive membrane damage, a feature of necrotic cell death. We conclude that CI-MPR is necessary for granzyme B binding, internalization, and apoptosis; however, in vitro, perforin can still mediate membrane damage in the absence of the granzyme B death receptor.

To understand the significance of these findings in vivo, we transplanted these L-cells into an allogeneic mouse model to look at rejection. We found that MPR-negative cells survived despite CD4/CD8 T-cell infiltration but that regular L-cells and CI-MPR-positive cells were rejected. These findings indicate that the granzyme B–CI-MPR pathway to apoptosis predominates over the perforin membranolytic pathway to necrosis in in vivo models of graft rejection. In addition, the physiological significance of the CI-MPR as the receptor for granzyme B has been questioned, because the enzyme is exocytosed as a complex with proteoglycans. However, our recent data suggests that this macromolecular form of granzyme B is preferentially endocytosed through this pathway (unpublished data).

The discovery that the CI-MPR is a death receptor for granzyme B opens new doors for the development of therapeutics, aimed at preventing graft destruction by blocking the granzyme B–CI-MPR interaction. However, nature may have beaten us to it, as the

CI-MPR has been characterized as a tumor suppressor in a wide variety of cancers. Our results suggest that the absence or downregulation of this receptor may serve to protect the tumor cells from attack by CTL. With no receptor for granzyme B, there would be no entry of the enzyme into the cytoplasm, and thus, the tumors would survive. Thus, therapeutic downregulation of the receptor may well be immunosuppressive and of benefit in the treatment of autoimmune disorders.

### Concluding remarks

This project began as a study of gene activation during CTL activation but led to the discovery of a key effector molecule in killing granzyme B. Research on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis has provided us with detailed information of the molecules involved and the control of their activities. It is clear that granzyme B is such a potent killer because it can activate a number of these apoptotic pathways. Thus, even faced with a virus that can block one route to death, the action of granzyme B is not thwarted, as it finds an alternate route to destroy the pathogenic cell. From a therapeutic perspective, this molecular knowledge is important and suggests that in order to develop immunosuppressive drugs, the multifaceted nature of granzyme B must be controlled. This control could be achieved through an inhibitor of enzymatic activity, but the discovery of the receptor-mediated route of entry suggests alternatives. Perhaps the lessons we are now learning from the immune-evasion strategies used by ‘successful’ pathogens will suggest how to arrest this natural born killer.
