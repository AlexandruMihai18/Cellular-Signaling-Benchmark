**ABSTRACT**

The primary roles of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid (CA) protein are to encapsidate and protect the viral RNA genome. It is becoming increasing apparent that HIV-1 CA is a multifunctional protein that acts early during infection to coordinate uncoating, reverse transcription, nuclear import of the pre-integration complex and integration of double stranded viral DNA into the host genome. Additionally, numerous recent studies indicate that CA is playing a crucial function in HIV-1 immune evasion. Here we summarize the current knowledge on HIV-1 CA and its interactions with the host cell to promote infection. The fact that CA engages in a number of different protein-protein interactions with the host makes it an interesting target for the development of new potent antiviral agents.

**1. Introduction**

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 is a member of the retrovirus family and is the causative agent of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV-1 infection causes cell-mediated immune deficiency through the progressive loss and dysregulation of CD4+ T lymphocytes. In the mid-1990s, the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) significantly extended the lives of many patients (reviewed in [Camacho and Teofilo, 2011; Shen and Siliciano, 2008]) and although not a cure, the administration of different combinations of antiretroviral drugs has truly changed a universally fatal disease into a potentially chronic one.

The HIV-1 life cycle begins with attachment and fusion of the viral envelope to the cell membrane of a susceptible host (reviewed in [Wilen et al., 2012]), whereby the capsid disassembles to release the viral genome and accessory proteins into the cytoplasm. The HIV-1 single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome is converted into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which is transported into the nucleus and integrated into the host chromosome. The integrated provirus encodes the structural proteins Gag, Pol and Env, which are common to all retroviruses. Independent of any other viral protein, the polyprotein Gag is transported to the plasma membrane and assembles to produce particles that are morphologically indistinguishable from immature virions ([Bell and Lever, 2013]). The products of the pol gene include the viral protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). The env gene produces a precursor for the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. Additionally, HIV-1 carries six regulatory and accessory genes being tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr and vpu, which are unique to HIV-1 and play important roles in viral replication and the development of AIDS. Late stages of virus assembly occur at the plasma membrane, where the virion acquires its host-derived lipid envelope leading to virus budding into the extracellular space (reviewed in [Bieniasz, 2009; Meng and Lever, 2013; Sundquist and Krausslich, 2012]).

The Gag polyprotein multimerizes on dimeric, positive-strand viral RNA genomes and directs assembly, budding and maturation ([Bell and Lever, 2013]). Gag is a modular protein which is proteolytically cleaved by PR into 6 domains that plays specific roles during the HIV-1 life cycle. Of these six, three are conserved folded domains being the N-terminus matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC). During the late phase of virus replication, the myristylated MA domain anchors Gag to specific membrane microdomains and promotes assembly at the plasma membrane ([Bouamr et al., 2003]). The highly basic stretch of residues in the NC domain is responsible for recruiting the HIV-1 genome and serves as a scaffold for Gag multimerization ([Burniston et al., 1999; Cimarelli et al., 2000; Khorchid et al., 2002]). Two small spacer regions, p2 and p1, flank the NC domain ([Briggs et al., 2009]). Finally, the C-terminal p6 domain of Gag recruits endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) – I and III machineries

that facilitate budding and release of newly synthesized particles (reviewed in Meng and Lever, 2013; Morita and Sundquist, 2004). HIV-1 particle budding induces maturation, whereby Gag is cleaved by the viral PR, resulting in NC proteins that condense onto the viral ssRNA, the formation of a conical core around the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by CA proteins, and MA proteins that remain attached to the host-derived lipid bilayer.

Approximately 1500 CA subunits (24 kDa) form the HIV-1 capsid (Ganser et al., 1999), which provides structural stability to the virion that protects the enclosed viral ssRNA genomes. The asymmetric architecture of the fullerene-shaped cone is the result of 12 pentamers and approximately 200 hexamers (Ganser et al., 1999; Pornillos et al., 2011). X-ray crystallography and multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicate that CA is composed of a C-terminal domain (CTD) comprising four α-helices (Du et al., 2011; Gamble et al., 1997) and a N-terminal domain (NTD) comprising seven α-helices and one β-hairpin (Gitti et al., 1996; Momany et al., 1996), which are connected by a flexible linker (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2011). Several structures of isolated CTD and NTD exist (Byeon et al., 2009; Gamble et al., 1997; Gitti et al., 1996; Worthylake et al., 1999) and structural information regarding the full-length CA protein is limited due to large-scale interdomain motion between the two domains (Deshmukh et al., 2013; Du et al., 2011; Monaco-Malbet et al., 2000; Shin et al., 2011). Recently, Zhao et al., reported the complete atomic HIV-1 capsid model by cryo-electron tomography (Zhao et al., 2013). Individual CA monomers spontaneously self-assemble into sheets with a natural cylindrical (Byeon et al., 2009; Ganser et al., 1999; Gross et al., 1997; Li et al., 2000) or conical (Briggs et al., 2003; Ganser et al., 1999) curvature and are used to as a model to study the hexagonal lattice of the capsid core. Recent structural studies of these tubular assemblies define the NTD and CTD protein interfaces through which the CA subunits interact to form the HIV-1 capsid (Bayro et al., 2014; Byeon et al., 2009; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2007; Li et al., 2000; Pornillos et al., 2009, 2011). These intermolecular interfaces include the hexameric ring formed by the NTD–NTD interface (Pornillos et al., 2009, 2011); the interface formed between CTDs, which connects adjacent hexameric rings (Byeon et al., 2009; Gamble et al., 1997; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2007; Worthylake et al., 1999); and the hexamer stabilizing NTD–CTD intersubunit interface (Pornillos et al., 2009). Over the course of an infection, CA mutations that naturally arise at these interface sites have a negative impact on viral fitness with the most profound effects being at the NTD–NTD interface (Manocheewa et al., 2013).

In this review, we attempt to present a unifying picture of CA throughout HIV-1 replication. We delve into the emerging roles that HIV-1 CA plays throughout the virus life cycle and examine the various host cell co-factors that interact with HIV-1 CA to inhibit downstream processes and initiate innate immunity or to promote HIV-1 infectivity.

Different target cells demonstrate variable kinetics of CA protein loss and reverse transcription (Arfi et al., 2009), however, genetic evidence indicates that HIV-1 uncoating can occur as early as 30 min post-infection (Hulme et al., 2011; Perez-Caballero et al., 2005). This timing is consistent with an elegant experiment in which “click” chemistry (Jao and Salic, 2008) of incoming HIV-1 RNA and fluorescent confocal microscopy demonstrate a rapid and progressive loss of CA from the core post-infection and diffusion of RTC components throughout the cytoplasm (Xu et al., 2013). Although the precise timing of uncoating and reverse transcription remains elusive, it appears that the two processes impact on each other and may be occurring in parallel (Arfi et al., 2009; Hulme et al., 2011). Clearly uncoating is not a spontaneous process and many recent studies highlighting host cellular factors that assist in disassembly of the CA core to facilitate optimal HIV-1 reverse transcription (Fig. 1) (Ambrose and Aiken, 2014; Auewarakul et al., 2005; Fassati, 2012; Hilditch and Towers, 2014; Warrilow et al., 2008).

### 2.1. Pin1

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation often play important roles in modulating protein activity and protein-protein interactions. Several reports provide evidence that the CA protein is predominantly phosphorylated at serine residues (Mervis et al., 1988; Veronese et al., 1988). Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that specifically binds phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motifs and catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bond. Pin1 knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) or mutation at CA residues Ser16A/Pro17A impairs HIV-1 infectivity at the reverse transcription step and results in an accumulation of CA cores in the cytoplasm (Misumi et al., 2010). Moreover, Pin1 interacts with the CA core through the phosphorylated Ser16-Pro17 residues (Cartier et al., 1999; Misumi et al., 2010), which are modified specifically by virion-associated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) (Dochi et al., 2014). Suppression of ERK2 packaging results in reduced phosphorylation of CA residue Ser16, which translates to a blockade in reverse transcription and an attenuation of HIV-1 replication (Dochi et al., 2014). The authors hypothesize that CA phosphorylation acts a molecular switch to promote Pin1-dependent uncoating (Fig. 1) (Dochi et al., 2014; Misumi et al., 2010).

### 2.2. PDZD8

The PDZ-domain-containing protein 8 (PDZD8) is a newly identified host factor contributing to HIV-1 post-entry events (Guth and Sodroski, 2014). This host protein was identified using in vitro assembled HIV-1 CA-NC complexes, which produce cylindrical tubes with a hexameric lattice that mimics the viral capsid (Ganser et al., 1999; Li et al., 2000). The CA-NC complexes act as a substrate for cytoplasmic lysate components and reveal PDZD8 as possessing capsid-stabilizing properties (Fig. 1) (Guth and Sodroski, 2014). The cellular role of PDZD8 is poorly defined but has been proposed to be involved in regulating microtubule stability (Henning et al., 2011) and previously identified as an HIV-1 co-factor of unknown function (Henning et al., 2010). Depletion of PDZD8 adversely affects HIV-1 capsids by accelerating disassembly and blocking HIV-1 infection at a step before reverse transcription, suggesting that PDZD8 is exerting an effect on HIV-1 uncoating (Guth and Sodroski, 2014; Henning et al., 2010). Initial results indicate that the capsid stabilizing effect of PDZD8 may extend to a broad range of species, including other retroviruses (murine leukaemia virus, simian immunodeficiency virus) (Guth and Sodroski, 2014).

## 2. The role of CA in post-entry events

Once the viral core enters the cytoplasm it undergoes a controlled disassembly process from the viral RNP complex, termed uncoating. This restructuring process results in the formation the reverse transcription complex (RTC) and initiates reverse transcription. The CA subunit interactions confer an intrinsic stability to the HIV-1 capsid as demonstrated by mutagenesis studies at the NTD–NTD and CTD–CTD intersubunit interfaces (Byeon et al., 2009; Forshey et al., 2002; Wacharapornin et al., 2007; Yang and Aiken, 2007; Yufenyuy and Aiken, 2013). For example, the CA mutations E128A/R132A strengthen the capsid core and reduce the efficiency of reverse transcription (Forshey et al., 2002).

Fig. 1. HIV-1 CA is necessary for post-entry events. Some host cell factors (CypA, Pin1 and PDZD8) interact with HIV-1 WT CA (blue dots) to promote timely capsid uncoating and initiation of reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome, while perturbation of the uncoating process by CPSF6 (mislocalization to the cytoplasm) or TRIM5a induces premature capsid disassembly and a block in HIV-1 replication. Nucleocytoplasmic transport factors, TNPO3, Nup358 and Nup153 facilitate nuclear import of the PIC and integration of proviral DNA into host chromosomes. By contrast, the antiviral activity of MxB acts to inhibit HIV-1 infection at the level of nuclear entry or integration.

2.3. Cyclophilin A

Nearly two decades ago, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, cyclophilin A (CypA) was described as a modulator of HIV-1 uncoating (Braaten et al., 1996). Importantly, polymorphisms in the cypA gene can be associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 and may alter disease progression (An et al., 2007; Rits et al., 2008). The CypA-CA interaction occurs in the context of the CA hexamers that make up the mature HIV-1 core, specifically on the exposed, proline-rich loop of the CA protein (residues Gly89 and Pro90) (Fig. 1) (Colgan et al., 1996; Franke et al., 1994; Gamble et al., 1996; Luban et al., 1993). CypA is efficiently incorporated into virions at a molar ratio of 1:10 CypA-CA (Bosco et al., 2002). Blocking the packaging of CypA during virion assembly or treatment with the competitive inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) leads to a reduction in HIV-1 infectivity and a block in replication at a post-entry step, after membrane fusion but before initiation of reverse transcription (Braaten et al., 1997; Dorfman et al., 1997; Franke et al., 1994; Luban et al., 1993; Thali et al., 1994). Although target cell CypA is unable to overcome the lack of virion-associated CypA, it is known that the cell-associated CypA modulates HIV-1 CA disassembly (Hatziiioannou et al., 2005; Li et al., 2009; Shah et al., 2013; Yin et al., 1998a; Ylinen et al., 2009). However, the correct timing of uncoating also relies on CypA-CA binding to stabilize the capsid and to promote HIV-1 infection in certain cell types (Hatziiioannou et al., 2005; Li et al., 2009). Rasaiyaah et al. propose that the HIV-1 capsid is stabilized by CypA-CA, which suppresses premature viral cDNA synthesis to avoid immune detection (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013), as discussed below.

The exact mechanism by which CypA promotes uncoating and reverse transcription is still under intense investigation. It is proposed that CypA catalyzes the isomerization of the Gly89-Pro90 bond, which potentially changes the conformation of the proline-rich loop and destabilizes the capsid core (Bosco et al., 2002; Lammers et al., 2010). Alternatively, CypA-CA binding may cause steric hindrance between the CA hexamers and result in minor dislocations that ultimately tip the scale towards capsid disassembly when the ratio of CypA to CA is close to 1:1 (Gamble et al., 1996). This model or a combination of the two may prove to be the most physiologically relevant by facilitating progressive uncoating as opposed to a one-step event (Fassati, 2012).

In an effort to characterize the mechanism of HIV-1 regulation by CypA, De Iaco et al. report an exhaustive comparison of 27 different cell lines and clearly demonstrate that the CypA-CA interaction is necessary for reverse transcription (De Iaco and Luban, 2014). The HIV-1 A92E CA mutant (Aberham et al., 1996), is defective for HIV-1 replication and can be rescued by inhibition of the CypA-CA interaction (Hatziiioannou et al., 2005; Sokolskaja et al., 2004; Song and Aiken, 2007; Yin et al., 1998b). Interestingly, the A92E mutant demonstrates highly variable nuclear entry restriction by CsA in all the tested cell lines, which cannot be correlated to the endogenous expression of CypA (De Iaco and Luban, 2014). This finding implicates the requirement for a yet unknown, cell-type specific, differentially expressed CypA-dependent restriction factor (De Iaco and Luban, 2014; Hatziiioannou et al., 2005; Song and Aiken, 2007).

2.4. CPSF6

Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor-6 (CPSF6) is a nuclear protein that is capable of inhibiting HIV-1 infection when it is aberrantly localized in the cytoplasm or upon overexpression of a smaller cytoplasmic fragment composed of amino acids 1–358 (Hori et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2010). Additionally, CPSF6 mutants lacking a nuclear localization signal (NLS) are able to block reverse transcription (Hori et al., 2013; Rasaiyaah et al., 2013). It appears that CPSF6 plays a role at the level of uncoating, which requires the CPSF6 CA-binding domain to interact with the incoming viral core in order to restrict virus replication via core stabilization (Fig. 1) (De Iaco et al., 2013; Fricke et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2012; Price et al., 2012). Strikingly, depletion or overexpression of CPSF6 has no effect on HIV-1 replication in cell lines (Fricke et al., 2013; Hori et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2010). CPSF6 appears to influence the route of HIV-1 nuclear entry, as demonstrated by the HIV-1 CPSF6-binding mutant (CA N74D) being incapable of replicating in primary macrophages (Ambrose et al., 2012). In agreement, a recent work from Henning et al. illustrates that depletion of CPSF6 or mutations in the CPSF6-binding pocket enhances replication of cell cycle-dependent CA mutants that are unable to infect non-dividing cells (Henning et al., 2014). Moreover, the physiological relevance of endogenous CPSF6

Please cite this article in press as: Le Sage, V., et al., Roles of HIV-1 capsid in viral replication and immune evasion. Virus Res. (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.010

is observed by the positive correlation between the sensitivity of CPSF6-mediated restriction and effective suppression of viral loads of early cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape variants in HLA-B27+ individuals ([Henning et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20131952)).

Henning et al. describe an opposing, CA-dependent role for CPSF6 that benefits HIV-1 replication *in vivo*. The selective pressure exerted by the inhibitory effect of CPSF6 on naturally occurring HIV-1 variants seems to produce mutant viruses that maintain CPSF6 binding yet are still able to escape from its restrictive activity ([Henning et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20131952)). This study illustrates that the unknown benefit of maintaining CPSF6 binding appears to outweigh the cost associated with any inhibition of HIV-1 replication *in vivo*.

### 2.5. TRIM5α

TRIM5α is a member of the large family of TRIM proteins and is characterized by its TRIpartite Motif (TRIM), which consists of a RING, B-box and coiled-coil (RBCC) domains as well as a C-terminal PRYSPRY domain (also known as B30.2 domain) ([Nisole et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029)). TRIM5α is expressed in all tissues throughout the human body and is upregulated by interferon (IFN) ([Asaoka et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2005.03.029)).

TRIM5α of the rhesus monkey (rhTRIM5α) causes a profound block in HIV-1 replication before reverse transcription of viral ssRNA and targets the virus for proteosomal degradation ([Danielson et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.01.010); [Stremlau et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02723)), whereas human TRIM5α (hTRIM5α) strongly blocks N-tropic murine leukaemia virus (MLV) and only weakly restricts HIV-1 ([Perron et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2004.05.010); [Yap et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2004.05.010)). The PRYSPRY domain is responsible for binding CA NTD ([Nakayama et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029); [Perez-Caballero et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029); [Stremlau et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029); [Yap et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029)) in the context of the mature viral capsid core following virus entry to promote its rapid and premature disassembly ([Sebastian and Luban, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029); [Stremlau et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029)). TRIM5α forms hexagonal arrays that likely act as a pattern recognition molecule, as suggested by high-resolution structural studies mapping the PRYSPRY-CA binding sites ([Diaz-Griffero, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.02.029); [Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.02.029)) and indicate a low affinity interaction that may require the high avidity binding of TRIM5α hexagonal arrays to reach a physiological affinity ([Biris et al., 2013, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)). The proposed model suggests that the PRYSPRY domains are positioned to make contact with the epitopes of neighbouring CA hexamers in the capsid lattice ([Biris et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Yang et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.02.029)). In support of this model, single amino acid changes within the PRYSPRY domain that restore CA binding enhance the restriction activity of hTRIM5α ([Li et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.029); [Pham et al., 2010, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.02.029); [Stremlau et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029); [Yap et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029)). The host–pathogen antagonist interaction is likely the driving force behind the high variability of the PRYSPRY domain in primates making the interaction between the PRYSPRY domain and CA one of the major determinants of host tropism of HIV-1 and other retroviruses ([Ohkura et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.029); [Song et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029); [Stremlau et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029)).

Recent studies implicate the TRIM5α RING domain ([Li et al., 2013b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Lienlaf et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.02.029); [Roa et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.02.029)) and the TRIM5α linker 2 region ([Nakayama et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)) as well as two rhTRIM5α SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) located in the PRYSPRY domain as contributing to HIV-1 restriction ([Brandariz-Nunez et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Lukic et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)). Additionally, Pawlica et al. demonstrate that TRIM5α antiviral activity is dependent on microtubule-mediated transport as pharmacological disruption of the microtubule network or depletion of the dynein heavy chain decreases the ability of TRIM5α to restrict retroviral targets ([Pawlica et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.02.029)). Disassembly of microtubules counteracts the destabilizing effects of TRIM5α on the capsid core by altering the localization and dynamics of TRIM5α, which results in increased stability of intact capsid cores and rescues viral infectivity ([Pawlica et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.02.029)). The ability of TRIM5α to recognize and bind the viral CA is not only important to eliminate

the virus but may help to promote an antiviral state within the cell to protect from further infection ([Pertel et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.02.029)).

#### 2.6. MxB

The IFN-inducible myovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are dynamin-like GTPases of vertebrates. Humans encode two Mx genes, *mx1* and *mx2*, which encode the MxA and MxB proteins, respectively (reviewed in [Haller and Kochs, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.02.029)). MxB was originally thought to solely be involved in regulating cellular activities ([King et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2004.02.029); [Melen et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.1996.02.029); [Pavlovic et al., 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.1990.02.029)) but three recent studies implicate MxB as having potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 infection ([Goujon et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Kane et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Liu et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)). Overexpression of MxB inhibits HIV-1 replication, whereas silencing of MxB decreases the IFN-induced inhibition of HIV-1 infection ([Goujon et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Kane et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Liu et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)). The HIV-1 replication step at which MxB acts is somewhat controversial. In two studies, real-time PCR demonstrates that MxB decreases the amount of 2-LTR circles indicating that MxB acts at the level of nuclear import or impacts on DNA stability (Fig. 1) ([Goujon et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Kane et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)). In contrast, Liu et al. conclude that MxB impairs proviral DNA integration, as no difference in 2-LTR circles is observed (Fig. 1) ([Liu et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)).

Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that CA mutants unable to interact with CypA or CPSF6 are less sensitive to MxB inhibition, suggesting that CA is a specific target of MxB ([Goujon et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Kane et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029); [Liu et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)). The function of MxB appears to be linked to CypA, as depletion of CypA or disruption of the CypA-CA interaction terminates the antiviral activity of MxB ([Liu et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)). Similar to the mechanism of action of the restriction factor TRIM5α, it is thought that CypA binding may alter the conformation of CA thus making it more accessible to MxB binding.

The exact mechanism of MxB inhibition is still under investigation but the authors have proposed several models. Firstly, MxB might target incoming HIV-1 particles by directly binding to CA protein within the RTC-PIC (pre-integration complex) in a CypA-dependent manner and consequently inhibit nuclear import. Secondly, MxB is known to cause a generalized perturbation of nucleocytoplasmic transport ([King et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2004.02.029)) and consequently might impose a blockade on specific nuclear import pathways used by HIV-1 or affect the localization of other cellular proteins required to interact with CA. Thirdly, MxB might also act after nuclear entry and primarily affect proviral stability and integration.

### 3. Nuclear import and integration

The nuclear envelope (NE) segregates the host chromosome from the cell cytoplasm during interphase and acts as a formidable barrier against retrovirus integration of the reverse transcribed dsDNA genome (reviewed in [Le Sage and Mouland, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.029)). Nuclear pore complexes (NPC) are multiprotein channels that decorate the NE and regulate selective nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of macromolecules ([Wente and Rout, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.02.029)). The NPC facilitates communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm by allowing passive diffusion of molecules smaller than 5 nm through the pore, while macromolecules greater than 40 kDa require active transport ([Kramer et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2007.02.029); [Mohr et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.02.029); [Paine et al., 1975](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.1975.02.029); [Pante and Kann, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2002.02.029)). Gammaretroviruses, such as MLV, are unable to infect non-dividing cells and depend on cell division to dissolve the NE during mitosis to gain access to the nucleus ([Lewis and Emerman, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.1994.02.029); [Roe et al., 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.1993.02.029)). HIV-1 and other lentiviruses do not require breakdown of the nuclear membrane and instead are able to hijack the cellular transport machinery to cross the intact NE through the NPC of non-dividing cells ([Fassati, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.029); [Katz et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.029); [Yamashita and Emerman, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.029)). By facilitating its own genomic

nuclear import, HIV-1 is able to infect important reservoirs such as tissue macrophages ([Le Douce et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.07.008)) and resting or partially activated CD4+ T cells ([Pace et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.010); [Vatakis et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2010.06.008)). Swapping HIV-1 CA with MLV CA impairs HIV-1’s ability to infect non-dividing cells ([Yamashita and Emerman, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2004.08.021)). It is interesting to note that lentivirus and gammaretrovirus CA proteins differ in that lentivirus contain a highly conserved extra loop between helices 4 and 5 of its NTD called the CypA-binding loop. The presence of this loop has been implicated in the ability of lentiviruses to infect non-dividing cells ([Bichel et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010)).

The PIC is a large complex that is composed of viral cDNA as well as viral and some host proteins. A diameter spanning 56 nm requires the PIC be actively imported into the nucleus, which is facilitated by nuclear localization signals (NLSs) on PIC-associated proteins ([Jayappa et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.010); [Miller et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(97)80002-8)). Biochemical studies initially indicated that the CA protein is completely shed from the RTC upon uncoating ([Bukrinsky et al., 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(93)90285-8); [Farnet and Haseltine, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(91)90285-8); [Fassati and Goff, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00528-2); [Karageorgos et al., 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(93)90286-9); [Miller et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(97)80002-8)) and instead implicates several NLS-containing viral proteins including IN ([Ao et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2005.01.010), [2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.01.010); [Depienne et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(01)00528-2); [Gallay et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(97)80002-8); [Hearps and Jans, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2006.01.010); [Jayappa et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)), MA ([Bukrinsky et al., 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(93)90285-8)), Vpr ([Di Marzio et al., 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(95)80002-8); [Heinzinger et al., 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(94)80002-8); [Jacquot et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.01.010); [Jenkins et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(98)80002-8); [Le Rouzic et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(02)80002-8); [Subbramanian et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(98)80002-8); [Yao et al., 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(95)80002-8)) and the HIV-1 DNA flap ([Ao et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2004.01.010); [Arhel et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2006.01.010); [Zennou et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(00)80002-8)) in PIC import. However, current evidence strongly suggests that the viral CA protein is actually the major determinant in HIV-1 nuclear import ([Dismuke and Aiken, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2006.01.010); [Yamashita and Emerman, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2004.08.021); [Yamashita et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.01.010)).

Following uncoating, the HIV-1 RTC engages several cellular factors involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport including importin 7 (also known as imp7) ([Fassati et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)80002-8); [Zaitseva et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.010)) transportin-3 (TNPO3), Nup358 (also known as RanBP2) and Nup153 ([Brass et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.010); [Bushman et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.010); [König et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.010)). Depletion of TNPO3, Nup358 or Nup153 decreases HIV-1 infectivity, which is dependent upon CA as mutation of HIV-1 CA allows the virus to escape restriction ([Christ et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.010); [Krishnan et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2010.01.010); [Lee et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2010.01.010); [Logue et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010); [Matreyek and Engelman, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010); [Schaller et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)). CA is able to interact with TNPO3, Nup358 and Nup153 ([Di Nunzio et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.010), [2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010); [Schaller et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010); [Valle-Casuso et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.010); [Zhou et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)), however binding of these host protein to CA does not perfectly correlate with HIV-1 dependence on these host factors ([Diaz-Griffero, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.010)), suggesting the involvement of an upstream CA-binding molecule. It has been proposed that CPSF6 may be one such host factor as it appears to dictate the nuclear entry pathway ([Price et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.010)). In vivo, HIV-1 mutants that escape from CPSF6-mediated restriction and retain CPSF6 binding are strongly correlated with recovery of utilization of TNPO3, Nup358 and Nup153 ([Henning et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.01.010)). Lending support to the idea that CPSF6 is involved in defining the nuclear entry pathway, disruption of the CPSF6-CA interaction produces proviruses that integrate into the host genome randomly as opposed to being specifically targeted ([Schaller et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)).

### 3.1. TNPO3

Exchange of material between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is a highly selective process that is regulated by soluble transport receptors called karyopherins (importins or exportins). The directionality of cargo transport is determined by the concentration gradient of Ran/GTP (high in the nucleus and low in the cytoplasm), where in the nucleus Ran/GTP binds to and causes disassembly of the importin-cargo complex to allow the newly formed importin-Ran/GTP complex to be recycled back out into the cytoplasm through the NPC ([Kopito and Elbaum, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.01.010)). Conversely, exportins bind nuclear export signal (NES)-containing cargo and Ran/GTP in the nucleus to dissociate in the cytoplasm upon interconversion of Ran/GTP to Ran/GDP.

The human β-karyopherin TNPO3 is important for nuclear import of NLS-containing cargo. TNPO3 and HIV-1 IN directly interact (Fig. 1) ([Christ et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.010)), however the biological relevance of this interaction remains questionable as genetic evidence strongly indicates that TNPO3 and CA play a functional role in HIV-1 replication ([De Iaco and Luban, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010); [De Iaco et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010); [Krishnan et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2010.01.010); [Valle-Casuso et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.010); [Zhou et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)). Unexpectedly, the interaction between TNPO3 and CA protein was enhanced in the presence of Ran/GTP and cellular fractionation indicates that the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic CA was significantly higher in TNPO3 knockdown cells as compared to control cells, suggesting that CA may be an export cargo for TNPO3 ([Zhou et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)). HIV-1 mutants in which CA remains associated with the RTC/PIC or host cell depletion of TNPO3 results in an aberrant pattern of HIV-1 integration ([Dismuke and Aiken, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2006.01.010); [Fricke et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010); [Ocwieja et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010); [Zhou et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)). Taken together, Zhou et al. propose a model whereby TNPO3 promotes HIV-1 infection by removing any CA proteins that remain bound to the PIC after nuclear entry to promote integration ([Zhou et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)).

HIV-1 subverts the nucleocytoplasmic transport process in order to relocalize host proteins that facilitate virus replication. For example, the nuclear proteins heterogeneous nuclear RNP A1 (hnRNP A1) is sequestered in the cytoplasm to positively regulate HIV-1 internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated viral RNA translation ([Monette et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.010)) while hnRNP A2/B1 expression has an important accessory role to play with Rev in promoting nuclear RNA retention and nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport ([Gordon et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010)). Potent HIV-1 infection also necessitates the transport factor TNPO3 to properly localize the host antiviral factor, CPSF6 to the nucleus ([De Iaco et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010); [Maertens et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.01.010)). TNPO3 mutants that fail to interact with CPSF6 correlate with the inability of HIV-1 to replicate ([Maertens et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.01.010)). The requirement for CPSF6 expression under TNPO3 depletion conditions to block HIV-1 replication, suggests that the observed effects of TNPO3 knockdown may be in part due to the mislocalization of CPSF6, which engages and stabilizes the capsid core to adversely affect virus replication ([De Iaco et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010); [Maertens et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.01.010); [Price et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.010)).

#### 3.2. Nup358

The initial steps of core uncoating are tied to reverse transcription ([Hulme et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)), yet the precise location and mechanism of CA protein disassembly remains controversial. Nup358 is one of the cytoplasmic filaments and contains a C-terminal CypA homology domain. Microscopy data suggest that CA-containing PICs or intact HIV-1 capsid cores dock at the NPC ([Arhel et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.01.010)), with subsequent direct evidence showing that the flexible, filamentous nature of Nup358 binds HIV-1 CA through its CypA domain and is responsible for the perinuclear localization of CA early during infection ([Di Nunzio et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.010); [Lin et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010); [Schaller et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.010)). Nup358 extends a great distance into the cytoplasm, which may facilitate recruitment and tethering of the reverse transcribing virion to the NPC or play a significant role in docking of the PIC to facilitate interactions with nuclear transport machinery during the uncoating process. The mechanism by which Nup358 may influence the timing of uncoating is unknown, however, recent evidence indicates that the CypA homology domain of Nup358 possesses isomerase activity albeit less active than CypA ([Lin et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010)). Measuring the interconversion between the cis and trans isomers of HIV-1 CA by NMR ZZ-exchange spectroscopy indicates that Nup358 catalyzes a more rapid isomerization than CypA ([Bichel et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010)). Since CA isomerization may act as a trigger for viral uncoating ([Bosco et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00002-8); [Gitti et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(96)80002-8)), it is tempting to hypothesize that Nup358

Please cite this article in press as: Le Sage, V., et al., Roles of HIV-1 capsid in viral replication and immune evasion. Virus Res. (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.010

stimulates uncoating by accelerating the rate of CA isomerization at the NPC in order to promote and synchronize nuclear entry.

Nup358 depletion impairs HIV-1 infectivity ([Brass et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07246); [König et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07245); [Lee et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09272); [Meehan et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2810); [Ocwieja et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2005); [Schaller et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2006); [Zhang et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.1784)), which can be rescued by expression of the N-terminal 1340 amino acids (PheGly-repeats) of Nup358 ([Meehan et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2810)). In immortalized CD4+ T cells, acute depletion of Nup358 causes a decrease in HIV-1 replication, however, once the cells adapt, HIV-1 infection is no longer impaired, which suggests that the disruption in cellular homeostasis is the cause of the effects on HIV-1 as opposed to Nup358 being a co-factor for viral replication ([Meehan et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2810)).

### 3.3. Nup153

Nup153 is anchored to the nuclear rim of the NPC by its N-terminal domain ([Enarson et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81766-0)), and its PheGly (FG)-repeat domain extend ~200 nm into the nucleus ([Fahrenkrog et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00667-3)). The FG-repeats are natively unfolded and highly flexible ([Lim et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2006.02.036)) thus allow Nup153 to play a large role in nucleocytoplasmic transport ([Bastos et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(96)90130-5); [Shah and Forbes, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81766-0); [Ullman et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81766-0)). Lentiviral CA proteins, including HIV-1, directly bind to the FG motif of Nup153 ([Matreyek et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)), perhaps promoting nuclear import of the partially uncoated PIC (Fig. 1). Furthermore, Nup153 plays a direct role in targeting the transcriptionally active regions of the chromosome for HIV-1 integration, as depletion of Nup153 significantly influences the distribution sites of HIV-1 integration ([Koh et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)).

## 4. Innate immune viral sensing

Following viral infection, the host cell responds by mounting an innate antiviral response to create an inhospitable environment for viral replication by inducing the expression of IFN and subsequently IFN-stimulated genes, known as ISGs (reviewed in [Valiente-Echeverria et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.02.011)). Viral nucleic acids can be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or cytosolic nucleic acid sensors, which detect DNA or RNA to trigger antiviral IFN responses (reviewed in [McCartney and Colonna, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2009.01.006)). The TLRs that recognize nucleic acids (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9) are located in endosomes of antigen-presenting cells and recognize nucleic acids derived from internalized viruses or infected apoptotic cells. Some nucleic acid sensors specialize in sensing RNA, such as the Retinoic acid Inducible Gene I (RIG-I) ([Yoneyama et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02494)), Melanoma Differentiation Antigen 5 (MDA5) ([Kang et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01017)), protein kinase R (PKR) ([Meurs et al., 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(90)90336-X)) and 2′,5′ oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1) ([Malathi et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.02.008)). The RNA sensors, RIG-I and MDA5, stimulate IRF3 and NF-κB through the adaptor MAVS (also termed Cardif, Visa or IPS1) to produce IFN and inflammatory cytokines (reviewed in [Kato et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.044)). While other sensors preferentially detect DNA, including Interferon Gamma-Inducible Protein 16 (IFI16) ([Unterholzner et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.1863)), DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) ([Takaoka et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05878)), DDX41 ([Zhang et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2005)), LRRFIP1, AIM2 ([Hornung et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.1784) 2009), cGAMP synthase (cGAS) ([Sun et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) ([Ferguson et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). DNA sensors (DAI, IFI16, DDX41, DNA-PK and cGAS) interact directly with dsDNA and recruit the stimulator of IFN genes (STING) protein to induce the expression of IFN-β through activation of IRF3 ([Unterholzner, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). Unlike typical nucleic acids sensors that recognize either RNA or DNA, the promiscuous nucleic acid sensor LRRFIP1 is capable of binding both to induce IFN-β expression via the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin ([Yang et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)).

## 5. Host sensing of HIV-1

Two copies of the ssRNA HIV-1 genome are introduced into the cell cytoplasm after infection and subsequently reverse transcribed into dsDNA. The high error rate of RT causes the generation of nonproductive dsDNA and short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides that, together with the HIV-1 ssRNA, can potentially trigger cell-intrinsic DNA or RNA sensors. Depletion of CD4T cells and chronic inflammation are two hallmarks of the progression of an HIV-1 infection towards AIDS. Although the cause of the CD4T cell loss remains unknown, recent data indicate that viral integration induces killing of activated primary CD4 lymphocytes ([Cooper et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). However, it is interesting to note that 95% of the CD4T cells found in human lymphoid tissues are non-permissive to an HIV-1 infection ([Eckstein et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500); [Moore et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). The resulting abortive infection causes an accumulation of incomplete DNA reverse transcripts, which are recognized by the host DNA sensor IFI16 ([Doitsh et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500); [Lee, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500); [Monroe et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). Doitsh et al. demonstrate that these quiescent “bystander” CD4T cells undergo cell death via caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis following infection by HIV-1 ([Doitsh et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that induces inflammation as a consequence of dying cells releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines ([Fink and Cookson, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500); [Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). The innate immune response initiated by IFI16 upon detection of the incomplete HIV-1 transcripts establishes a chronic state of inflammation. A vicious cycle of dying cells releases inflammatory signals, which then attracts more cells into the infected lymphoid tissue to die and subsequently produce more inflammation ([Biancotto et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)).

In response to an infection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (DNA virus), the DNA sensor cGAS is capable of recognizing the viral genome and induces an IFN response through the activation of STING and IRF3 ([Keating et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500); [Sun et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). Remarkably, HIV-1 infection of macrophages and lymphocytes does not induce antiviral IFN responses ([Yan et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). Instead it appears that the endoplasmic reticulum resident and SET complex associated DNase, TREX1, degrades viral DNA generated during HIV-1 infection in order to prevent triggering of intrinsic DNA sensors (Fig. 2) ([Chowdhury et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). Ablation of TREX1 expression results in DNA accumulation and the induction of IFN responses that inhibit HIV-1 infection at multiple levels via STING, TBK1 and IRF3-signalling pathways ([Yan et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)), indicating that HIV-1 subverts the DNase activity of TREX1 to purge cytoplasmic retroviral DNA and avoid triggering DNA sensors and the IFN-dependent innate response.

## 6. The role of CA in innate immune sensing

Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for coordinating the innate immune response. HIV-1 replication is restricted in DCs ([Granelli-Piperno et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500); [Manel et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)) by SAMHD1 ([Hrecka et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500); [Laguette et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)), whereas HIV-2 and SIV from macaques (SIVmac) are able to counteract this restriction factor through the viral protein Vpx to productively infect DCs ([Manel et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)). Moreover, when HIV-1 is complemented with the Vpx protein, DCs become readily infected ([Goujon et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2500)).

Several studies show that CA is involved in masking the viral DNA from host sensors upon entry into the cell. It has been proposed that the interaction of CypA with CA induces a CA conformational change that alters viral uncoating and therefore affects the ability of intracellular sensors to detect the viral nucleic acid, which in this case acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). New evidence by Manel et al. indicates that, late in infection, an interaction between newly synthesized Gag proteins (within the CA domain) and CypA induces a type I IFN response that activates

Fig. 2. Host sensing of HIV-1. The viral cDNA from HIV-1 CA mutants (red dots) with altered binding affinity for CypA, CPSF6 and Nup358 is detected by the DNA sensor cGAS to synthesize the second messenger cGAMP to trigger the STING pathway and leads to the production of type I IFN. Aside from cDNA, the process of reverse transcription produces unwanted DNA by products that can potentially activate DNA sensors, which is prevented by the host DNase, TREX1 through degradation of these nonproductive DNA products. Alternatively, proinflammatory signalling can be stimulates via the TAK1/TAB2/TAB3 complex pathway upon interaction between TRIM5α and the HIV-1 CA lattice.

T-cells. The authors show that in DCs the Gag-CypA interaction activates both STAT1 and IRF3 IFN-inducing pathways and the production of IFN-β (Fig. 3), these downstream events are specifically abrogated by treatment with CsA or by infecting target cells with the CypA-CA HIV-1 binding mutant G89V ([Manel et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.021)). Furthermore, productively HIV-infected DCs are able to cause HIV-1-specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II restricted T cell activation and proliferation, indicating that innate stimulation of DCs by HIV-1 can induce adaptive immunity in neighbouring T cells ([Manel et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.021)). This is the first report of an interaction between HIV-1 Gag (or CA) and CypA playing a role in inducing the host innate antiviral response and constitutes an important discovery of a cell-intrinsic recognition mechanism of retroviruses ([Manel et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.021)).

In an effort to characterize the step at which DCs are able to detect HIV-1, Lahaye et al. exploited mutations in CA with altered affinity for CypA (HIVac) and several anti-HIV drugs that block reverse transcription, nuclear entry, or integration ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). The authors conclude that HIV-2 is sensed in the cytosol before nuclear entry and integration and that synthesis of viral cDNA is required ([Lahaye et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.03.021)). Furthermore, mutation of the HIV-2 CA that enhance CypA binding (HIVac-2/P86HA) do not affect host sensing. In contrast, HIV-1 cDNA only could be sensed in DCs before integration and when equivalent HIV-2 CA mutation were introduced in the HIV-1 CA (HIVac-1), demonstrating that CA structure is important in determining where sensing occurs. Genetic targeting of known DNA sensors DDX41, IF116, and cGAS clearly demonstrate that DCs utilize cGAS as a sensor of HIV-1 and HIV-2 ([Lahaye et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.03.021)).

Fig. 3. Involvement of CA in late HIV-1 replication events.

HIV-1 replication induced stress (ROS and cleavage of translation factors), which results in global inhibition of protein synthesis and assembly of stress granules. However, HIV-1 Gag is sufficient to prevent stress granule assembly. The Gag-CypA interaction activates both STAT1 and IRF3 IFN-inducing pathways and the production of IFN-β. Finally, the Gag polyprotein directs assembly at the plasma membrane, budding and maturation.

2013). Consistent with these results, Gao et al. (2013) showed that cGAS recognizes reverse-transcribed HIV-1 DNA in a human monocytic cell line and triggers a signalling cascade that ultimately leads to the production of type I IFN and other cytokines involved in host antiviral immune responses (Fig. 2).

The CA-specific restriction factor TRIM5α is emerging as a multifunctional protein that also plays a role in CA sensing. Pertel et al. show that the interaction between TRIM5α and hexameric CA lattice stimulates AP-1 and NF-κB signalling via the TAK1/TAB2/TAB3 complex (also known as MAP3K7) pathway (Fig. 2) (Pertel et al., 2011). The authors demonstrate that the HIV-1 CA lattice enhances TRIM5α E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which activates TAK1 and inflammatory gene induction. This work is the first example of TRIM5α being characterized as a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) that recognizes the retrovirus CA and elicits proinflammatory signalling pathways (Pertel et al., 2011).

HIV-1 replication in primary human macrophages occurs without induction of innate immunity as the result of HIV-1 CA co-opting of the host factors CPSF6, Nup358 and CypA to regulate the timing of viral DNA synthesis and to mask HIV-1 replication by shielding the dsDNA from the host DNA sensors (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013). This group also showed that replication incompetent HIV-1 CA mutants N74D and P90A, which do not interact with CPSF6 and Nup358 or CypA (Ambrose et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2010), respectively, induce the production of high levels of type I IFN in infected cells (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013), implicating the role of CA and its interacting partners in preventing the detection of viral DNA by host sensors in macrophages. Using a combination of RT and IN mutants, the authors identified the reverse-transcribed viral DNA as the PAMP that is recognized by the host PRR (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013). Moreover, depletion of CPSF6 or inhibition of CypA recruitment to CA using CsA or a non-immunosuppressive analogue of CsA

(SmBz-CsA) allows the detection of HIV-1 by innate sensors and triggers the induction of IFN (Fig. 2) (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013). This data demonstrates the importance of CA and its interacting host factors in evasion of innate antiviral responses in macrophages.

Taken together these studies highlight the role of CA in host sensing either through direct recognition of the Gag protein or CA by the cyclophilins, CPSF6 or TRIM5α or alternatively, by acting as a PAMP for the host innate immune response.

## 7. Other mechanisms of immune evasion elicited by HIV-1 CA

Viral infections attempt to minimize many cellular processes that induce stress responses by global inhibition of protein synthesis and subsequently by the assembly of stress granules (SGs). SGs are translationally silent RNP complexes (consisting of untranslated mRNAs and proteins) mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation (Kedersha et al., 2002), cleavage of eIF4G protein or inhibition of eIF4E helicase (Mazroui et al., 2006). Following HIV-1 infection, several events potentially lead to SG assembly. First, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by viral proteins Nef (Acheampong et al., 2009), Tat (Norman et al., 2007) and RT (Isaguliants et al., 2013) and second, the cleavage of translation factors mediated by HIV-1 PR (Castello et al., 2009) (Fig. 3). Abrahamyan et al. showed that HIV-1 inhibits SGs during oxidative stress in favour of the assembly of Staufen1-containing HIV-1-dependent RNPs (Abrahamyan et al., 2010; Lloyd, 2012; Valiente-Echeverria et al., 2012). More recently, our group demonstrated that the NTD CA of Gag is sufficient to prevent SG assembly via an interaction with the host eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2)(Fig. 3). Moreover, both the G89A CypA CA binding mutant and CsA treatment relieve the block to SG assembly (Valiente-Echeverria et al., 2014, in press). Whereas Manel et al. show that the interaction between CypA and newly synthesized HIV-1 Gag is essential for the innate response to HIV-1 in monocyte-derived DCs (Manel et al., 2010), our observations further indicate that this interaction might be also important for maintaining the SG blockade.

## 8. Conclusions

The CA protein has many roles in the early steps of HIV-1 replication and seems to provide a functional link between uncoating, nuclear import and integration (Dismuke and Aiken, 2006; Yamashita and Emerman, 2009; Yamashita et al., 2007). It also interacts with a growing number of host cell factors making these interesting avenues for future research. Importantly, many viruses, including HIV-1, counter host innate immune responses using a variety of strategies. It will be important to show whether the strategies involving CA described above this mechanism plays a role in control of HIV-1 infection in humans.

Standard HIV-1 drug treatments are plagued by the emergence of viral resistance with the most prominent source of mutations in HIV-1 arising from the process of reverse transcription, which is inherently error prone due to the lack of proofreading activity of reverse transcriptase (Ji and Loeb, 1992). Worldwide, approximately 90% of HIV-1 isolates are non-B subtypes (Hemelaar et al., 2011) with amino acid sequences differing up to 30% between subtypes (Gaschen et al., 2002). A large scale analysis of over 10,000 full-length gag sequences illustrates the sequence diversity that exists among the major HIV-1 subtypes (Li et al., 2013a). The highest level of conservation in Gag is observed in CA, specifically at the NTD–NTD and NTD–CTD interaction interfaces (Li et al., 2013a), which are crucial for the stabilization of the capsid lattice. Being that the CA protein plays multiple, necessary roles throughout the HIV-1 life cycle it is under strong pressure to conserve function. In agreement, examination of a library of single amino acid substitution CA mutants by Rihn et al. revealed that HIV-1 CA is a genetically fragile protein as 70% of mutations producing replication-defective viruses (Rihn et al., 2013).

The need for new classes of HIV-1 inhibitors has never been greater with the increasing development of antiretroviral drugs resistance making the CA protein an interesting and unexploited drug target as it functions throughout HIV-1 replication (Adamson and Freed, 2010). Recently, a number of small molecule inhibitors of CA have been discovered and are potential therapeutics as they engage multiple binding sites on CA to induce conformational changes and/or alter protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Klumpp and Crepin, 2014). The first small molecule to block CA function was the compound CAP-1, which inhibits HIV-1 replication in cell culture (Tang et al., 2003) upon CAP-1 binding within a hydrophobic pocket of the CA-NTD (Kelly et al., 2007). Subsequently, researchers at Pfizer identified a series of compounds (PF-74) that engage a second binding site on the CA-NTD without inducing a conformational change in the NTD, as demonstrated by crystallography (Blair et al., 2010). By contrast to CAP-1, which inhibits virus assembly, PF-74 accelerates the rate at which CA forms multimers *in vitro* and leads to a defect in both the viral uncoating process and the formation of infectious particles (Blair et al., 2010). PF-74 acts by destabilizing the HIV-1 capsid to induce premature uncoating *via* a mechanism that involves CypA-CA interaction (Shi et al., 2011). Another family of small molecules, pyrrolopyrazolone (BI-1/BI-2) also affect the uncoating step but differ from PF-74 in that they exert a stabilizing effect on the HIV-1 capsid (Lamorte et al., 2013). BI-1 and BI-2 bind to the CA-NTD in a binding site that overlaps the location in which CPSF-6 binds and acts by accelerating CA-NC tube assembly and blocking CA-NC dissociation, *in vitro* (Lamorte et al., 2013). The gyrase inhibitor coumermycin A1 (C-A1) is another interesting example of an antibiotic that inhibits HIV-1 replication at two different steps of the life cycle through interactions with two different targets thereby potentially making viral resistance less likely (Vozzolo et al., 2010). In addition to binding Hsp90 and adversely affecting HIV-1 gene expression, C-A1 blocks DNA integration mediated through an interaction with CA (Vozzolo et al., 2010). Optimal antiretroviral activity appears to necessitate CypA as suggested by the CA mutant P90A being less sensitive to C-A1 than the wild-type virus and the partial antagonistic effect of CsA (Vozzolo et al., 2010).

A further understanding of the molecular mechanisms on how HIV-1 evades the innate antiviral response will be important for ongoing HIV-1 vaccine development and the design of new antiretroviral drugs.
