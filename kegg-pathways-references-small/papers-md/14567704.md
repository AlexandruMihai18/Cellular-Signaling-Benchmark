ABSTRACT: While most of the proteins required for the biosynthesis of thiamin pyrophosphate have been known for more than a decade, the reconstitution of this biosynthesis in a defined biochemical system has been difficult due to the novelty of the chemistry involved. Here we demonstrate the first successful enzymatic synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamin from glycine, cysteine, and deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate using overexpressed *Bacillus subtilis* ThiF, ThiS, ThiO, ThiG, and a NifS-like protein. This has facilitated the identification of the biochemical function of each of the proteins involved: ThiF catalyzes the adenylation of ThiS; NifS catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from cysteine to the acyl adenylate of ThiS; ThiO catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to the corresponding imine; and ThiG catalyzes the formation of the thiazole phosphate ring. The complex oxidative cyclization reaction involved in the biosynthesis of the thiamin thiazole has been greatly simplified by replacing ThiF, ThiS, ThiO, and NifS with defined biosynthetic intermediates in a reaction where ThiG is the only required enzyme.

Thiamin pyrophosphate is an essential cofactor in all living systems where it functions to stabilize the acyl carbanion synthon (*I*). The biosynthesis of this cofactor in *Escherichia coli* is outlined in Figure 1. The 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP)¹ is formed from 5-aminomimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) in a reaction involving a complex, poorly understood rearrangement; the 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl) thiazole phosphate (Thz-P) is formed from tyrosine, l-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP), and cysteine; the thiazole and the pyrimidine are then coupled to give thiamin monophosphate (TMP), and a final phosphorylation gives thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP), the biologically active form of the cofactor (2–5).

The formation of the thiazole moiety of thiamin is complex and requires six gene products: ThiS, ThiF, ThiG, ThiH (6), IscS (7), and ThiI (8, 9). The early steps in the sulfur incorporation chemistry have been worked out, and a novel acyl disulfide intermediate, covalently linking ThiF and ThiS, has been identified (10). However, despite the identification of an advanced intermediate, we have not been successful in reconstituting the thiazole biosynthesis using the *E. coli* proteins, possibly due to problems overexpressing and isolating active ThiH, a putative iron sulfur cluster containing protein. This analysis was recently supported by the isolation of ThiH under anaerobic conditions (11).

In contrast to *E. coli*, *Bacillus subtilis* and many other bacteria do not use tyrosine or ThiH for the thiazole biosynthesis. Rather, these bacteria use glycine and ThiO, a stable flavoenzyme previously identified as a glycine oxidase (12–14). In this paper, we describe the successful reconstitution of thiazole biosynthesis in a defined biochemical system containing ThiO, ThiF, ThiS, ThiG, and a cysteine desulfurase, and the identification of the function of each of these proteins.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

[^35S^-]-cysteine (20–150 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences, [1,2-^13C^-]-glycine was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (99% purity), and [1,2-^14C^-]-glycine (101 mCi/ mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Thz-P, HMP, DXP, and [1-^13C^-]-DXP were synthesized as previously described (15–17).

**Cloning of *B. subtilis* Thiazole Biosynthesis Genes.** Standard methods were used for DNA restriction endonuclease digestion, ligation, and transformation (18). Plasmid DNA was purified with the Wizard Plus SV DNA miniprep kit (Promega). DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified with the QiaQuick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). The plasmid pET-16b was obtained from Novagen. *E. coli* strain DH5α was used as a recipient for transformation during plasmid construction and for plasmid propagation and storage. A Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR system 2400 and Platinum *Pfx* DNA polymerase (Gibco Life Technologies) were used for PCR. *B. subtilis* CU1065 genomic DNA was used as the template for PCR. Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing were carried out at the Cornell University Bioresource Center. Table 1 shows the plasmids constructed and used in this study.

Overexpression of Proteins. E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the overexpression plasmid was grown in LB media containing ampicillin (50 $\mu$g/mL media) with shaking at 37 °C until its OD$_{600}$ reached 0.5, at which point isopropyl-$\beta$-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 500 $\mu$M, and growth was continued for another 8 h at 25 °C. For the co-purification of ThiO, ThiSG, and ThiF, cultures containing pCLK811, pCLK820, and pCLK431 were prepared in 100, 200, and 100 mL of LB media, respectively, mixed, and harvested together. Cultures for HMP-P kinase (ThiD) and $B$. subtilis NifS-like proteins (NifS, NifZ, YrvO, and CSD) were prepared in 1 L of LB media. Thiamin phosphate synthase (17) was purified as previously described.

Purification of Proteins. The cells prepared above were resuspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer (10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH$_2$PO$_4$, pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication (Heat Systems Ultrasonics model W-385 sonicator, 2 s cycle, 50% duty, 4 min). All proteins used in this study were purified using Ni–NTA resin following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). After elution of the sample, protein solutions were desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0).

Biosynthesis of Thz-P and Its Coupling with HMP-PP. A typical reaction mixture contained 100 $\mu$L of co-purified proteins (ThiOSGF, NifS, 160 $\mu$g), 10 mM glycine, 1 mM cysteine, 100 $\mu$M DXP, 1 mM HMP, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl$_2$, 10 $\mu$g of ThiD, 10 $\mu$g of ThiE, 20 $\mu$g of NifS and 50 $\mu$M PLP. The reaction mixtures were diluted to 150 $\mu$L with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), incubated at 25 °C for 1 h, and quenched with 150 $\mu$L of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid.

In other reaction mixtures, NifS/PLP and cysteine were replaced by 1 mM Na$_2$S and 1 mM DTT. The reaction mixture using only ThiG for thiazole formation contained 100 $\mu$L of ThiG (60 $\mu$g), 10 mM glyoxylate, 10 mM ammonium chloride, 1 mM Na$_2$S, 1 mM DTT, 100 $\mu$M DXP, 1 mM HMP, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl$_2$, 10 $\mu$g of ThiD, and 10 $\mu$g of ThiE and was diluted to 150 $\mu$L with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8).

Thiochrome Derivatization. Potassium acetate (50 $\mu$L of 4 M) was added to 100 $\mu$L of the quenched reaction mixture prepared above, followed by addition of 50 $\mu$L of potassium ferricyanide (30–40 mg/mL in 7 M NaOH). After 1 min, the reaction mixture was neutralized by the addition of 58 $\mu$L of 6 M HCl.

Detection of Thiochrome Phosphate by HPLC. Thiochrome phosphate was analyzed by HPLC (Hewlett-Packard) and detected by fluorescence (excitation at 365 nm and emission at 450 nm). A total of 100 $\mu$L of the thiochrome reaction mixture was injected onto a C$_{18}$ column (Supelco, Supelcosil, LC-18-T 15 cm × 4.6 mm, 3 $\mu$m) and eluted using the following gradient: solvent A is water, solvent B is 0.1 M potassium phosphate, 4 mM tetrabutylammonium

hydrogen sulfate (pH 6.6), solvent C is MeOH, 0–3 min 10% B, 5% C, 3–20 min 5% B, 10% C, 20–24 min 5% B, 40% C, and for the column wash the following gradients were applied 24–26 min 40% B, 5% C, 26–29 min 40% B, 5% C and 29–40 min 10% B and 5% C. The flow rate was 1 mL/min. Commercial thiamin, thiamin monophosphate, and thiamin pyrophosphate were oxidized to the corresponding thiochromes and used as references eluting at 18, 20, and 22 min, respectively.

**Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment.** Biosynthesized thiochrome phosphate was purified by HPLC as described above. The eluted sample was lyophilized, redissolved in 500 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 10.0), and treated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma; 10 units for 12 h at 25 °C). The resulting reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC for thiochrome as described above.

**Analysis of Thz-P Formation by TLC/Autoradiography.** 10 mM Na₂S, 200 μM DXP, and [1,2-¹⁴C]-glycine (6.5 mM, 0.05 mCi) were incubated with ThiO (24 μg) and ThiG (20 μg) for 2 h in 100 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reaction mixture was then applied to a TLC plate by repeated spotting with air-drying between applications. Thz-P (100 mM) was co-spotted allowing the visualization of Thz-P by UV (254 nm). After the final sample application, the TLC plate was dried and developed in a TLC chamber using 9:1:3 N-propanol/ethyl acetate/water. After the solvent had migrated ~7 cm, the TLC plate was removed, dried, and exposed for 3 days to Kodak biomax MS autoradiography film using an intensifier screen (Kodak biomax transcreen LE). The autoradiogram was developed in Kodak GBX developer, stopped, and fixed using GBX fixing solution.

**TLC Purification and MS Analysis of Thz-P Biosynthesized from [1,2-¹³C]-Glycine and [1-¹³C]-DXP.** Sample preparation and TLC development were as described above except that [1,2-¹³C]-glycine and [1-¹³C]-DXP were used. Nonlabeled Thz-P was spotted on each side of the reaction mixture for subsequent localization of [¹³C]-Thz-P on the TLC plate. After development, the silica gel between the two reference spots was excised and transferred to an Amicon centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa membrane). The silica was then washed twice with 0.5 mL of MeOH/water (1:1), and the washings were partially evaporated before lyophilization. The resulting residue was dissolved in 20 μL of MeOH/water (1:1) and analyzed by ESI-MS (Negative ion mode, Esquire-LC 00146, 120 μL/h).

**Preparation of ThiS, ThiS-COAMP, and ThiS-COSH.** ThiSG and ThiF were separately purified from 400 mL cultures of the corresponding overexpression strains. For the preparation of ThiS-COAMP, a reaction mixture containing 150 μg of co-purified ThiSG, 50 μg of ThiF, 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM MgCl₂ in 100 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. For the preparation of ThiS-COSH, a reaction mixture containing 150 μg of co-purified ThiSG, 50 μg of ThiF, 20 μg of NifS, 50 μM PLP, 1 mM cysteine, 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM MgCl₂ in 100 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C.

**Characterization of ThiS, ThiS-COAMP, and ThiS-COSH by ESI-FTMS.** All samples prepared as described above were desalted by loading onto a reverse-phase peptide trap (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). The trap was washed with 2 mL of 98:1:1 (H₂O/MeOH/HOAc), and eluted

with 80 μL of 26:70:4 (H₂O/MeOH/HOAc). The solutions were electrosprayed at 1–50 nL/min with a nanospray emitter. Mass spectra were acquired on a 6 T modified Finnigan FTMS described previously (19). For MS/MS spectra, specific ions were isolated using stored waveform inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) (20), followed by sustained off-resonance collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) (21). Assignment of the fragment masses and compositions were made with the computer program THRASH (22). After each mass value, the mass difference (in units of 1.00235 Da) between the most abundant isotopic peak and the monoisotopic peak is denoted in italics.

**B. subtilis Cysteine Desulfurases as Sulfur Donors.** 2 mM [³⁵S]-cysteine (20–100 μCi), 4 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl₂, and ThiSGF (180 μg) were preincubated for 10 min before adding 3 μL of NifS (4.5 μg), NifZ (6.0 μg), CSD (10.2 μg), or YrvO (10.8 μg) to give a total volume of 50 μL (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8). After 30 min, the small molecules were removed by desalting (BIO-RAD biospin 6, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02% sodium azide) directly into a microcentrifuge tube containing 50 μL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. A total of 20 μL of each reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%). The developed gel was washed thoroughly with water and dried in vacuo between gel drying film (Promega) using a BIO-RAD gel dryer (model 583). The dried gel was exposed to biomax MR (Kodak) autoradiography film for 3 h to 3 days, developed using Kodak GBX developer and replenisher, washed with distilled water, fixed using Kodak GBX fixer and replenisher, and again thoroughly washed with distilled water before drying. The resulting autoradiogram was analyzed by densitometry (Epson expression 1600 with the software U-scan IT-gel version 3.1) and/or scanned and analyzed using NIH image 1.62 freeware. The resulting intensities were used to calculate the relative efficiencies in intensity units/μmol of enzyme and the largest value was normalized to 100%.

**Kinetics of Sulfur Transfer from Cysteine to ThiS.** 2 mM [³⁵S]-cysteine (80–600 μCi), 4 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl₂, and ThiSGF (720 μg) were preincubated for 10 min before adding 30 μL of YrvO (108 μg) in 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8 (total volume 200 μL). Aliquots of the reaction mixture (20 μL) were quenched after 1, 7, 16, 38, 60, 96, 125, and 151 min by gel filtration (BIO-RAD biospin 6 in 10 mM

A total of 20 μL of each of the resulting samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%). The gel was developed and its autoradiogram was prepared as described above. The resulting autoradiogram was analyzed by densitometry. The resulting intensities were imported into Sigmaplot and fitted to an exponential function.

ThiS-COSH Is the Thiazole Sulfur Source. 2 mM [³⁵S]-cysteine (20–150 μCi), 4 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl₂, and ThiSGF (180 μg) were preincubated for 10 min before adding NifS (6.2 μg) or YrvO (11.1 μg) in 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8 (total volume 50 μL). After 1 h, the assay mixture was gel filtered (BIO-RAD biospin 6 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02% sodium azide) into a microcentrifuge tube

containing 20 μL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. A total of 20 μL of this was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography as described above to demonstrate successful formation of ThiS thiocarboxylate. The remaining sample (30 μL) was diluted to 120 μL with 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.7. A total of 30 μL of this sample (716000 CPM), was preincubated (20 min) with 3.6 mM HMP, 4 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl₂, ThiD (60 μg), ThiE (12 μg), 8 mM glycine, 200 μM DXP, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of ThiG/ThiO (co-purified, 150 μg) to bring the total volume to 123 μL. Two control reactions were prepared in a similar fashion; one did not contain DXP, the other did not contain glycine. After 2.5 h at RT, 24 nmol thiamin-phosphate was added as carrier, and the reactions were quenched with 126 μL 10% TCA, and centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was centrifuged through a 10 kDa membrane and stored at −20 °C until use. Potassium acetate (25 μL, 4 M) and potassium ferricyanide (25 μL, 30 mg/mL in 7 M NaOH) were added to a 50 μL aliquot of this sample. After 1 min, the reaction was neutralized by the addition of 28 μL of 6 M HCl (pH must be 6.5–7.5). A total of 100 μL of the resulting solution was analyzed by HPLC (Detection: absorbance at 205, 254 nm, fluorescence excitation at 365 nm and emission at 450 nm, as well as in-line scintillation counting using a Packard flow scintillation analyzer 500TR

series.) The elution conditions were identical to those described above with a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min.

**Reforming of ThiS from ThiS-COSH.** ThiS-COSH was formed by incubating 2.5 mL of ThiSGF (5 mg/mL, freshly purified from 0.5 L of a ThiF overexpression culture and 1.0 L of a ThiSG overexpression culture) and 100 μL of purified ThiO (12 mg/mL) with cysteine (2 mM), ATP (4 mM), MgCl₂ (8 mM), and YrvO (0.5 mg). After ~95% conversion (determined by ESI-FTMS analysis, 1–5 h), the proteins were desalted (Amersham PD-10 desalting column in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). DXP (200 μM) or glycine (8 mM) was added to 500 μL of this sample and the conversion of ThiS-COSH to ThiS was monitored by ESI-FTMS analysis of the corresponding molecular ions.

**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

**Overexpression of B. subtilis ThiO, ThiSG, ThiG, and ThiF.** These were all overexpressed as soluble proteins in *E. coli* and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. ThiG was copurified with His-tagged ThiS for most reaction

**FIGURE 7:** Formation of the ThiS-COS-S-ThiF complex in *E. coli.*

mixtures. The His-tags did not interfere with the activity (unpublished results).

**Assay for Thiazole Phosphate.** The assay strategy involved the enzymatic conversion of the thiazole phosphate (4) to thiamin phosphate (9), followed by oxidative cyclization to thiochrome phosphate (10), which can be readily analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detection (Figure 3). A similar assay protocol has been previously used to detect low levels of thiazole biosynthesis in spinach chloroplast (23).

**Reconstitution of Thz-P Biosynthesis using Purified B. subtilis ThiO, ThiF, ThiSG, and NifS.** Glycine, DXP, and cysteine were incubated with purified ThiO, ThiSG, ThiF, and NifS, and the reaction mixture was analyzed for thiazole phosphate using the thiochrome assay (Figure 4A). We observed 1–5% conversion based on 100 μM DXP after 2 h. The level of thiazole phosphate synthesis dropped to near background levels when cysteine, DXP, or glycine was omitted (Figure 4B). The thiazole observed for experiments 2, 3, and 4 in Figure 4B may be due to protein bound intermediates or products.

**Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment of the Biosynthesized Thiochrome Phosphate.** To confirm the HPLC identification of thiochrome phosphate derived from biosynthesized thiazole phosphate, the putative thiochrome phosphate was dephosphorylated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. The resulting product comigrated with authentic thiochrome by HPLC analysis.

**Confirmation of Glycine and DXP as Thiazole Phosphate Precursors.** When the reconstitution reaction was run in the presence of [1,2-\[^{14}\]C]-glycine and analyzed by TLC followed by autoradiography, the radioactivity comigrated with unlabeled Thz-P, which was visualized by UV (Figure 5A). In addition, when the reaction was run using [1,2-\[^{13}\]C]-glycine and [1-\[^{13}\]C]-DXP, analysis of the resulting thiazole-phosphate by ESI-MS demonstrated the production of Thz-P with an extra two mass units (Figure 5B). These results confirm that DXP and glycine are the precursors to the thiazole and demonstrate that we are observing de novo Thz-P biosynthesis in our reconstitution system. Glycine has been previously identified as a thiazole precursor in an in vivo labeling study (24).

**Formation of ThiS-COSH using the B. subtilis cysteine desulfurases.** Four cysteine desulfurases have been identified in *B. subtilis*: NifS (IscS ortholog), YrvO, NifZ, and CSD. Of these, NifS has been associated with nicotinamide biosynthesis and is an essential gene (25). CSD may be involved in iron sulfur cluster assembly, as it is adjacent to *yurV*, an IscU homologue. YrvO is localized adjacent to tRNA (5-methylamino)methyl-2-thiouridylate methyltransferase, and NifZ is adjacent to ThiI. All four cysteine desulfurases were analyzed for their efficiency in catalyzing the transfer of sulfur from cysteine to ThiS using SDS-PAGE and densitometry of the resulting autoradiogram (Figure 6A). These enzymes were also analyzed for their

ability to form Thz-P using the thiochrome assay. NifZ was the most efficient sulfur transferase for ThiS-COSH formation, followed by NifS, YrvO, and CSD. YrvO, in our current reconstitution system, catalyzed the transfer of the sulfur from cysteine to ThiS at a rate of 0.027 min⁻¹ (Figure 6B). NifZ was also the most efficient in forming thiazole-phosphate, but in both cases the differences are minimal (data not shown). Therefore, *B. subtilis* NifS, YrvO, NifZ, and CSD are all competent sulfur donors for the formation of ThiS-thiocarboxylate in vitro.

separately from ThiF to avoid the in vivo formation of ThiS-COSH; ESI-FTMS analysis of this sample confirmed its absence (Figure 8A). When ThiS was incubated with ThiF and ATP, the formation of ThiS-COAMP was observed by ESI-FTMS (Figure 8B). For the biosynthesis of ThiS-COSH, ThiS was incubated with ThiF, ATP, cysteine, and NifS. ESI-FTMS analysis of this reaction mixture demonstrated the formation of ThiS-COSH (Figure 8E,F) that is both NifS and cysteine dependent (Figure 8C,D).

**Thiazole Phosphate Biosynthesis using ThiS-COSH as the Sulfur Source.** To confirm that ThiS-COSH is the sulfur source for Thz-P biosynthesis, we prepared [³⁵S]-ThiS thiocarboxylate using [³⁵S]-cysteine. The SDS-PAGE analysis of this reaction mixture verified the incorporation of the radioactivity from cysteine into ThiS (inset, Figure 9).

The radiolabeled ThiS-COSH was then desalted to remove the small molecules and used for thiazole phosphate biosynthesis. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture demonstrated the formation of radiolabeled Thz-P (Figure 9, bottom panel, 9–15% conversion). To provide additional support for this, we trapped the sulfur on ThiS thiocarboxylate as the ThiS-cysteine acyl disulfide (16, Figure 10) by reacting ThiS thiocarboxylate with cystine (1 mM, 1 h). Under these conditions, the rate of thiazole formation decreased by a factor of 8 and the acyl persulfide could be detected by ESI-FTMS. This is the first direct demonstration that ThiS thiocarboxylate is the Thz-P sulfur source.

**Replacement of ThiS-COSH with Na₂S.** Since ThiS-COSH functions as a sulfide carrier, one can potentially regard this modified peptide as a source of sulfide. We therefore sought to determine if we could replace it with free sulfide in our reaction mixture. When 1 mM sulfide was used to replace NifS, ATP, cysteine, ThiS, and ThiF, we observed efficient formation of thiazole phosphate.

dependence of this reaction on sulfide concentration is shown in Figure 11. In addition, Na₂S was able to replace NifS and cysteine in the biosynthesis of ThiS thiocarboxylate; the ESI-FTMS spectrum of this reaction mixture is shown in Figure 11B. These experiments suggest that ThiS—COSH is simply a sophisticated source of sulfide, facilitating the transfer of sulfur from cysteine to an unidentified precursor to the thiazole phosphate.

The Hydrolysis of ThiS—COSH is DXP Dependent. We considered two possible mechanisms for the regeneration of ThiS from ThiS—COSH during thiazole formation (Figure 12). In the first mechanism, addition of ThiS—COSH to the glycine imine would give 17. Hydrolysis of this intermediate or of an analogue of this intermediate would give ThiS (11). Alternatively, ThiS—COSH could add to DXP to give 18, which could undergo hydrolysis to regenerate ThiS (11). The first mechanism predicts that ThiS regeneration will be dependent on the glycine imine, while the second proposal predicts that the regeneration of ThiS will be dependent on DXP.

To differentiate between these proposals, the conversion of ThiS—COSH to ThiS (in the presence of ThiG, ThiF, and ThiO) was monitored by ESI-FTMS after the addition of glycine or DXP. We observed that ThiS was reformed from ThiS—COSH after the addition of 200 μM DXP (60% conversion in 1 h, 100% conversion in 6 h), while 8 mM glycine had no effect. The hydrolysis of ThiS—COSH was >2000 times faster in the presence of DXP than in its absence (5% hydrolysis after 7 days).

ThiG Alone Can Catalyze the Formation of Thiazole Phosphate. We have previously demonstrated that ThiO is essential for thiazole phosphate biosynthesis (12) and catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to the glycine imine (12–14). This imine is unstable in aqueous buffer and is in equilibrium with glyoxylate and ammonia. This observation, combined with the demonstration here that cysteine, NifS, ThiF, and ThiS can be replaced with sulfide raises the possibility of a dramatic simplification of thiazole phosphate biosynthesis in which four of the five required proteins could be replaced with identified intermediates. To test this, a reaction mixture containing sulfide, ammonia, DXP, glyoxylate, and ThiG was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C and analyzed for thiazole phosphate production using the thiochrome assay. Thiazole phosphate is produced in approximately 70% of the yield found for the full system. The time course for this reaction is shown in Figure 13B and suggests that ThiG is the thiazole synthase.

### SUMMARY

Here we demonstrate the first successful reconstitution of the thiazole moiety of thiamin in a defined biochemical system. This has enabled us to identify a biochemical function for each of the proteins involved: ThiF catalyzes the adenylation of ThiS, a cysteine desulfurase catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from cysteine to the acyl adenylate of ThiS, ThiO catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to the corresponding imine, and ThiG catalyzes the formation of the thiazole phosphate ring (Figure 14). We have been able to greatly simplify the thiazole phosphate formation, replacing ThiF, ThiS, ThiO, and NifS with defined biosynthetic intermediates in a reaction where ThiG is the only required enzyme. Mechanistic and structural studies to determine how ThiG catalyzes the complex process of thiazole phosphate formation are in progress.
