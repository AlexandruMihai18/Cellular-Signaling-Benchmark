**INTRODUCTION:** Adjuvants are immunostimulatory substances that are added to vaccines to boost the immune response. Until recently, the only adjuvants available for clinical use were aluminum salts, either alone (alum) or in proprietary mixtures, and oil-in-water emulsions containing squalene, which have relatively low potency and substantial side effects, respectively. Natural surfactants (saponins) have been used as adjuvants in veterinary medicine for almost a century. The first saponin adjuvant, AS01, has recently been approved for use in the human shingles vaccine Shingrix and the malaria vaccine Mosquirix. It is also a promising adjuvant candidate for a tuberculosis vaccine. AS01 is a liposome-based formula that contains monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin known as QS-21, which act synergistically to induce strong antibody and helper T cell responses.

QS-21 is one of >100 structurally related QS saponins produced by the Chilean soapbark tree (*Quillaja saponaria*). These include QS-7 and QS-17, which, together with QS-21, are included in the Novovax NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine. Because of their chemical complexity, the only current commercial source of QS saponins is the bark of the soapbark tree. The increasing demand for these highly valuable molecules has led to growing interest in the possibility of developing environmentally sustainable, “free-from-tree” strategies to access these compounds in other ways.

**RATIONALE:** The biosynthetic pathway for QS saponins is not known. Elucidation of the genes and enzymes from the soapbark tree comprising the “instruction manual” for making QS saponins would provide insights into how these molecules are biosynthesized and diversified. It would also pave the way for new routes to access and engineer natural and new-to-nature immunostimulants.

**RESULTS:** We first sequenced the genome of the soapbark tree. Then, using genome mining and combinatorial transient expression in *Nicotiana benthamiana*, a wild relative of tobacco, we identified a total of 16 enzymes that together enable the production of advanced QS pathway intermediates that represent a bridgehead for adjuvant bioengineering. We also discovered a further three enzymes needed to make QS-7, a saponin with comparable adjuvant properties to QS-21 and low toxicity that is present in low abundance in *Q. saponaria* bark extract. Our work opens up the possibility of producing QS-7 and other related QS molecules in a heterologous expression system.

**CONCLUSION:** We have elucidated the pathway for the biosynthesis of advanced QS intermediates. Using our transient plant expression system, we were able to purify all of the intermediates at preparative scale, showing the power of this platform for rapid access to these molecules. We further demonstrate the production of the vaccine adjuvant QS-7. A number of plant natural products, including QS saponins and foxglove cardiac glycosides, have a D-fucose moiety, but the biosynthetic pathway to this sugar in plants was not previously known. In the present work, a route to D-fucosylation was discovered in which D-fucose is formed in situ from a 4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose attached to the saponin scaffold rather than being synthesized before transfer. Although the levels of QS-7 produced in *N. benthamiana* were low, they were comparable to those found in many tissues of *Q. saponaria*, with the exception of bark, which is about threefold higher. The availability of the complete gene sets for the biosynthesis of the heptasaccharide triterpene glycoside bridgehead QS saponins and QS-7 now present an opportunity for future endeavors to optimize production in heterologous expression systems with the ultimate aim of attaining commercial-scale yields. The availability of the complete genome sequence of *Q. saponaria*, coupled with our powerful and rapid transient expression platform, open up opportunities to access QS-21 and a diverse array of other saponins. This provides the potential to ultimately generate designer saponins with optimal immunostimulatory activity and low toxicity using metabolic engineering approaches.

The Chilean soapbark tree (*Quillaja saponaria*) produces soap-like molecules called QS saponins that are important vaccine adjuvants. These highly valuable compounds are sourced by extraction from the bark, and their biosynthetic pathway is unknown. Here, we sequenced the *Q. saponaria* genome. Through genome mining and combinatorial expression in tobacco, we identified 16 pathway enzymes that together enable the production of advanced QS pathway intermediates that represent a bridgehead for adjuvant bioengineering. We further identified the enzymes needed to make QS-7, a saponin with excellent therapeutic properties and low toxicity that is present in low abundance in *Q. saponaria* bark extract. Our results enable the production of *Q. saponaria* vaccine adjuvants in tobacco and open the way for new routes to access and engineer natural and new-to-nature immunostimulants.

Vaccination is a huge success story in the fight against infectious diseases. Vaccines frequently require an adjuvant component (an immunostimulant) to enhance the immune response to the antigen. However, to date, only a few adjuvants have been licensed for human use. Triterpene glycosides (saponins) from the Chilean soapbark tree (*Quillaja saponaria*) have proven to be highly effective adjuvants because of their ability to elicit both antibody and cellular immune responses (1). These saponins are collectively known as QS saponins. The QS-21 fraction, comprising isomeric forms of a complex triterpene saponin, is an immune potentiator used in the adjuvant AS01. AS01 has been licensed for use in two human vaccines: the GSK vaccines Shingrix and Mosquirix, for shingles and malaria, respectively. A mixture of QS saponins, including QS-21, QS-17, and QS-7, is also included in Matrix-M, a combination adjuvant used in the NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine produced by Novavax (2). QS-17 is a glycosylated derivative of QS-21. QS-7 has the same core structure as QS-21, but the two saponins differ in the nature of their modifications at the C-28 position. QS-7 has a simple acetyl group instead of the long (C-18) acyl chain present in QS-21, and there are also differences in the C-28 sugar moieties (Fig. 1A). Because of their chemical complexity, the only current commercial source of these saponins is the bark of the soapbark tree itself. However, these key immunogenic saponins represent only a portion of >100 structurally related molecules produced by *Q. saponaria* (3), so they require extensive purification. This issue is further exacerbated by variations in saponin content and composition between individual trees caused by environmental and genetic factors (4–6). Although a number of saponin biosynthetic enzymes have been characterized in recent years from taxonomically diverse plant species [e.g., (7–10)], much remains to be learned about the enzymes that generate the enormous structural diversity of saponins. Indeed, QS-21 has a total of seven different types of glycosidic moieties, including unusual sugars such as D-fucose, D-apiose, and L-arabinofuranose, for which the cognate enzymes are not yet known. Understanding the biosynthetic pathways for QS saponins will therefore provide new insights into how these molecules are made and diversified. It will further open up opportunities to produce saponins optimized for their immunostimulatory properties and low toxicity in heterologous hosts for use in the vaccines of the future.

At the time of starting this work, transcriptome data derived from *Q. saponaria* leaves were available through the 1000 Plants (1KP) Project (12). We obtained saplings of *Q. saponaria* from a UK nursery [John Innes Centre (JIC) accession no. S10; hereafter referred to as *Q. saponaria* S10] and verified the presence of QS-21 in the leaves, consistent with previous reports (13) (fig. S1). A BLAST search against the 1KP data was conducted using a characterized β-amyrin synthase (GgbAS1; GenBank accession no. AB037203) from licorice (*Glycyrrhiza glabra*) as a query (14). This revealed a single full-length candidate with 88% amino acid sequence identity to GgbAS1. We used gene-specific primers (data S1) to clone the corresponding sequence from cDNA prepared from the leaves of *Q. saponaria* S10. We then investigated the function of this candidate by *Agrobacterium*-mediated transient expression in the leaves of *Nicotiana benthamiana*. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of leaf extracts revealed a peak with the same retention time and mass spectrum as an authentic β-amyrin standard (2), confirming that this enzyme (hereafter referred to as QsbAS1) is indeed a β-amyrin synthase (fig. S2).

We next considered candidates for oxidation of β-amyrin (2). Most known triterpene oxidases are members of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) superfamily (8). Of these, the CYP716 family is commonly associated with triterpene biosynthesis and includes enzymes known to perform C-28 and C-16α oxidation (8, 15). A BLAST search of the 1KP *Q. saponaria* transcriptome dataset was performed using a known C-28 oxidase from *Medicago truncatula* (CYP716A12; GenBank accession no. FN995112) (16), a saponin-producing species that, like *Q. saponaria*, belongs to the Fabales order. From this, the two highest scoring hits were selected for further investigation. Transient expression of the first of these, CYP716A224, with QsbAS1 in *N. benthamiana* resulted in near total conversion of β-amyrin (2) to oleanolic acid (3) (fig. S3). The second enzyme, CYP716A297, showed very little activity toward β-amyrin. However coexpression of both CYP716A224 and CYP716A297 in combination with QsbAS1 resulted in the formation of a new product that we identified as echinocystic acid (4) using an authentic standard (fig. S3). These two CYPs are therefore able to oxidize two (C-28 and C-16α) of the three positions that are oxidized in QA (5) (Fig. 1C). In searching for the final oxidase, we compiled a list of all CYP sequences in the 1KP *Q. saponaria* transcriptome dataset that appeared to be full length (*n* = 35). After eliminating enzymes that were closely related to known CYPs associated with primary metabolism, we were left with 26 candidates, of which 17 were successfully cloned and transiently expressed in *N. benthamiana* (data S2).

Fig. 1. Reconstitution of the steps to QA. (A) QS-7 and QS-21 share a core structure (shown in black) consisting of the triterpene scaffold QA; a branched trisaccharide at C-3 featuring D-glucuronic acid (D-GlcA), D-galactose (D-Gal), and D-xylose (D-Xyl); and a linear tetrasaccharide at C-28 featuring D-fucose (D-fuc), L-rhamnose (L-Rha), D-Xyl, and D-apiose (D-Api). This core structure is common to about one third of all reported QS saponins. It should be noted that QS-21 variants also exist with L-rhamnose in place of D-Xyl at C-3 (*) and D-Xyl in place of D-Api at C-28 (**). QS-17 is a glycosylated derivative of QS-21. Both have a D-glucose (D-Glc) attached to the L-Rha of the C-28 sugar chain (as shared with QS-7), whereas QS-17 also has an additional L-Rha attached to the L-arabinofuranose (L-Araf) of the C-18 acyl chain.

The combination of all four enzymes resulted in the production of the QS scaffold, QA (*m/z* = 485) (5). Top, extract from control leaves that are not expressing the C-23 oxidase. (C) Biosynthetic route to QA: QsbAS1, β-amyrin synthase; CYP716A224, C-28 oxidase; CYP716A297, C16α oxidase; and CYP714E52, C-23 oxidase. The structure of QA was confirmed by NMR (fig. S4). Note that CYP714E52 was also found to be active on oleanolic acid. The resulting product is anticipated to be the C-23 aldehyde of oleanolic acid (gypsogenin) (fig. S46).

this approach, a single candidate, CYP714E52, was identified, which, when coexpressed with QsbAS1, CYP716A224, and CYP716A297, resulted in the production of QA (5) in *N. benthamiana* (Fig. 1B). We then performed large-scale transient expression by vacuum agro-infiltration of 209 plants, purified ~30 mg of this product, and confirmed its structure as QA (5) by ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectroscopy (fig. S4 and Fig. 1C). A phylogenetic tree showing the relatedness of the three CYPs required for QA biosynthesis to other previously characterized triterpene modifying CYPs from plants is shown in fig. S5.

**Generation of a pseudochromosome-level genome assembly for *Q. saponaria***

Genes for plant-specialized metabolic pathways are commonly coexpressed and may also be physically colocalized or “clustered” within the genome (17). Coexpression analysis requires the availability of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data for multiple different tissues and/or treatments, whereas discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters is dependent on the availability of a genome assembly, neither of which was available for *Q. saponaria*. To facilitate discovery of the saponin biosynthetic steps downstream of QA, we therefore generated de novo transcriptome and genome sequence resources for *Q. saponaria* S10. RNA-seq data were generated for six different tissues, primordia, expanding leaves, mature leaves,

old leaves, green stems, and roots, using Illumina HiSeq4000. QS-21 was present in all tissues examined (fig. S1). The estimated genome size of *Q. saponaria* based on flow cytometry was 411 Mbp (18). PacBio long-read sequencing and Hi-C (high-throughput/ resolution chromosome conformation capture) were used to generate a chromosome-scale assembly (table S1, fig. S6, and materials and methods). The draft genome was annotated by RNA-seq read alignment, filtering, gene model generation, and selection of final gene models (table S1, fig. S7, and materials and methods). Karyotype analysis revealed 28 chromosomes, consistent with a haploid chromosome number of 14 (Fig. 2A). The 14 scaffolds therefore represent the 14 chromosomes of *Q. saponaria* S10. Synteny analysis provided evidence for a whole-genome duplication event in *Q. saponaria* S10 (Fig. 2B), consistent with hypothesized polyploidy events observed across members of the Fabales (19).

Investigation of the expression profiles of the characterized QA biosynthesis genes in different *Q. saponaria* tissues revealed that these genes are highly coexpressed (Fig. 2C), with the highest absolute expression in leaf primordia and the lowest in old leaves (Fig. 2C and fig. S8), suggesting that it may be possible to identify further candidate downstream QS pathway genes on the basis of coexpression using these genes as bait.

We next mined the *Q. saponaria* genome assembly using plantiSMASH, an algorithm designed to predict biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in plant genomes (20). plantiSMASH predicted a total of 51 candidate clusters, of which 34 were assigned to the “saccharide” and/or “terpene” classes (fig. S9 and data S3) and so may be relevant to triterpene glycoside (i.e., saponin) biosynthesis. The four QA biosynthetic genes, *QsbAS1*, *CYP714E52*, *CYP716A224*, and *CYP716A297*, are not physically clustered with each other. However, the gene encoding one of the CYPs required for QA biosynthesis (*CYP716A297*) is located adjacent to a saccharide biosynthetic gene cluster (cluster 45) that includes genes predicted to encode sugar

transferases and other enzymes with potential functions in specialized metabolism (Fig. 2D). Some of these genes have similar expression profiles to CYP716A297, potentially suggesting a functional association (Fig. 2D).

**Addition of the C-3 sugar chain**

Having discovered the biosynthetic steps to QA(5) (Fig. 1C), we next focused on identifying the enzymes required for the addition of sugars at the C-3 and C-28 positions of the QA scaffold. The enzymes typically responsible for glycosylation of plant natural products belong to glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) family (21, 22). GT1 enzymes use uridine diphosphate (UDP)-activated sugar donors to transfer sugar units onto small molecules, so they are referred to as UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs). We therefore mined the *Q. saponaria* genome annotation to find all predicted full-length (>410 amino acids) UGT genes by searching with InterPro code IPR002213. This yielded a total of 166 predicted UGT genes, which were then prioritized on the basis of their strength of coexpression with *QsbASI* [Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) cutoff of 0.7] and their absolute gene expression levels in primordia [transcripts per million (TPM) >1600], resulting in a shortlist of 20 UGT genes (table S2). The two most highly coexpressed UGTs, *Qs0321930* and *Qs0321920* (PCC 0.987 and 0.985, respectively), were colocalized in the BGC shown in Fig. 2D, along with a third coexpressed UGT gene, *Qs0321940* (PCC 0.956). This cluster also contains a gene for another class of carbohydrate-active enzyme, *Qs0321900*, which is predicted to encode a cellulose synthase-like (CSL) protein. *Qs0321900* is not coexpressed with *QsbASI* (PCC –0.59), although it is expressed at moderate levels in primordial tissue. Another unlinked but closely related predicted CSL gene, *Qs0000870*, is very highly coexpressed with *QsbASI* (PCC 0.992), suggestive of a role in the QS pathway. We cloned all 20 UGT candidates and both CSL genes to evaluate their functions.

Coexpression of each of the UGT and CSL genes with the four QA pathway genes was performed by transient expression in *N. benthamiana* and modification of QA(5) monitored by untargeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). No conversion of QA(5) was observed when the UGT candidates were coexpressed. However, when either of the two CSL genes was coexpressed with the QA pathway genes, LC-MS analysis of leaf extracts revealed a peak with a mass corresponding to QA plus D-glucuronic acid and a concomitant reduction in QA(5) levels (Fig. 3A). We then scaled up our transient plant expression experiments. After vacuum infiltration of 104 *N. benthamiana* plants coexpressing the QA pathway genes with *CSLI*, we were able to purify 9.5 mg of product (data S4). We also obtained 2.1 mg of

the product of coexpression of the QA pathway genes with *CSL2* (from 80 *N. benthamiana* plants) (data S4). ¹H NMR analysis revealed that the spectra for the two products were identical (fig. S10). Extensive 2D NMR analysis (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY) confirmed that both products were 3-O-{β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-QA (6; hereafter abbreviated as QA-Mono) (tables S3 and S4).

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that *CSL1* and *CSL2* belong to the CSL-M subfamily, so they are hereafter referred to as *CSLM1* and *CSLM2* (fig. S11). Although CSL proteins have not traditionally been regarded as small-molecule glycosyltransferases, two other examples have recently been reported from other plant species (9, 23). The strong coexpression of *CSLM2* with *QsbASI* suggests that *CSLM2* may be primarily responsible for QA-Mono (6) biosynthesis in *Q. saponaria*.

We next screened our suite of cloned UGT candidates for the ability to glycosylate QA-Mono (6). Coexpression of *Qs0123860* (ranked third in table S2 based on coexpression with *QsbASI*) with the QA pathway genes and *CSLM1* resulted in a new product with the mass of QA-GlcA plus a hexose (Fig. 3B). After scale-up by vacuum infiltration of 104 *N. benthamiana* plants, 7.3 mg of this product was purified and its structure determined to be 3-O-{β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-QA (7; hereafter abbreviated as QA-Di) by NMR (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY) (table S5 and data S4). Thus, *Qs0123860* (UGT73CU3) encodes a QA-3-O-glucuronoside-β-1,2-galactosyltransferase capable of adding the second sugar to the C-3 position of *Q. saponaria* saponins.

Another round of coexpression experiments led to the identification of two UGTs that were able to further glycosylate QA-Di (7). One of these, *Qs0283870*, generated a product with a mass consistent with addition of a pentose, whereas the product of the second, *Qs0283850*, had a mass consistent with addition of a deoxyhexose (Fig. 3B). It is known that saponins from *Q. saponaria* show variation in the terminal sugar of the C-3 oligosaccharide chain and that either D-xylose or L-rhamnose can occur at this position (3, 5, 24). After large-scale vacuum infiltration, the two products were purified and their structures determined by extensive 2D NMR as 3-O-{β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→3)-[β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-QA (8; hereafter abbreviated as QA-TriX) (21.6 mg purified) and 3-O-{α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)-[β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-QA (9; hereafter abbreviated as QA-TriR) (43.3 mg purified), respectively (tables S6 and S7 and data S4). Thus, *Qs0283870* (UGT73CX1) encodes a xylosyltransferase and *Qs0283850* (UGT73CX2) a rhamnosyltransferase. These genes are ranked sixth and 13th, respectively, in table S2 on the basis of their coexpression with *QsbASI*. Phylogenetic analysis revealed

that all three UGTs, UGT73CU3, UGT73CX1, and UGT73CX2, belong to subgroup D of the GT1 family (fig. S12). This subgroup includes several other enzymes that are known to glycosylate triterpenes from both monocots and dicots (21). In summary, *CSLM1/2*, together with the three UGT enzymes characterized here, collectively enable the conversion of QA(5) to either QA-TriX (8) or QA-TriR (9) (Fig. 3C).

**Addition of the C-28 sugar chain**

QS-7, QS-21, and QS-17 share a common core consisting of the QA scaffold, the C-3 sugar chain, and a tetrasaccharide moiety at C-28 consisting of D-fucose, L-rhamnose, D-xylose, and D-apiose (Fig. 1A). These molecules differ in the nature of the other sugar and acyl groups attached to the C-28 sugar chain. A survey of the structures of saponins reported from *Q. saponaria* indicated that C-3 glycosylation is likely to precede the modifications at the C-28 position (fig. S13). Our results thus far were consistent with this hypothesis. Having successfully reconstituted the pathway for addition of the C-3 trisaccharide chain, we next turned our attention to elucidating the steps needed for glycosylation at C-28. The sugar that is linked directly to the QA scaffold at this position is D-fucose, which is attached through an ester linkage. The UGT gene *Qs0321930* (*UGT74BX1*) shows the highest level of coexpression with *QsbASI* (PCC 0.987) (table S2) and is located in biosynthetic gene cluster 45 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, *Qs0321930* is the only gene on the UGT candidate list that is predicted to encode a member of subgroup L of the GT1 family (fig. S12), a subgroup known to contain ester-forming UGTs (21). Indeed, transient expression of *Qs0321930*, together with the previously identified *Q. saponaria* saponin biosynthesis genes (the four QA genes, *CSLM2*, *UGT73CU3*, and *UGT73CX1*, producing 8), resulted in formation of small amounts of a new product with a mass consistent with addition of a deoxyhexose, which we anticipated to be the C-28 fucoside of 8 (10; hereafter abbreviated as QA-TriX-F) (fig. S14). UDP-α-D-fucose has been suggested to be limiting in *N. benthamiana*, which could account for the low abundance of the new product (9). Nevertheless, screening of additional UGT candidates against the putative QA-TriX-F (10) resulted in the identification of a UGT in subgroup A capable of adding a further deoxyhexose, with a mass consistent with addition of L-rhamnose as the second sugar in the C-28 sugar chain, to form QA-TriX-FR (12) (fig. S14). The activity of this putative rhamnosyltransferase, *UGT91AR1*, was dependent on the presence of D-fucose. The gene encoding it, *Qs0321920*, has the second-highest level of coexpression with *QsbASI* (PCC 0.985; table S2) and is located in biosynthetic gene cluster 45 adjacent to the putative fucosyltransferase gene (*UGT74BX1*), with which it

Fig. 4. Addition of the C-28 sugar chain. (A) LC-MS EIC of *N. benthamiana* leaf extracts after transient expression of the gene set for production of QA-TriX-F (10). Only low amounts of 10 accumulate in *N. benthamiana* (top). However, coexpression of the short-chain dehydrogenase encoded by Qs0321910 results in marked increases in the yield of this product (bottom), as well as increases in further downstream products (fig. S15). (B) Identification of the terminal xylosyl- and apiosyltransferases required for synthesis of the linear tetrasaccharide at C-28. The gene set for production of QA-TriX-FRX (14) was transiently coexpressed in *N. benthamiana* (top). Further coexpression of either Qs0234130 (middle) or Qs0234140 (bottom) resulted in the appearance of new products with identical masses (consistent with addition of pentoses) and slight differences in retention times. Large-scale infiltration, purification, and NMR analysis of the products using the QA-TriR-FRX (15) scaffold determined that Qs0234130 is the terminal xylosyltransferase, whereas Qs0234140 is the terminal apiosyltransferase (tables S9 and S10). (C) Summary of the biosynthetic pathway for the C-28 tetrasaccharide chain. The structures of compounds 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 were all confirmed by NMR after large-scale infiltration and purification (tables S8 to S12).

shares only ~30% amino acid sequence identity. A further round of screening identified another subgroup A UGT encoded by Qs0234120 (UGT91AQI) that appeared to modify QA-TriR-FR by addition of a pentose, suggesting that this may be the C-28 xylosyltransferase producing QA-TriX-FRX (14) (fig. S14).

In contrast to the QA C-3 glycosides, only trace amounts of the three putative C-28 glycosides were observed, with large quantities of unconverted precursor QA-TriX (8) remaining (fig. S14). It was apparent that the poor conversion from the QA-TriX (8) product to QA-TriX-F (10) was likely to represent a substantial bottleneck, impeding further pathway elucidation and structural verification of the products. Biosynthetic gene cluster 45 also harbors two predicted short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) genes. One of these, Qs0321910, is located immediately adjacent to the UGT91ARI gene and has a similar expression pattern to the QS enzymes characterized so far (coexpression with QsbASI, PCC 0.871) (Fig. 2D). Most of the known sugar nucleotide-interconverting enzymes are members of the SDR superfamily (25, 26). Transient coexpression of this SDR enzyme with the gene set for QA-TriX-F (10) biosynthesis resulted in substantial increases in the levels of the QA-TriX-F (10) product, suggesting that the SDR has a role in D-fucosylation, potentially by converting an endogenous UDP-sugar substrate in *N. benthamiana* to UDP-D-fucose, thereby furnishing enhanced FucT activity (Fig. 4A). Further, coexpression of the additional C-28 sugar transferases, including UGT91ARI and UGT91AQI, demonstrated that the amounts of the relevant products [QA-TriX-FR (12) and QA-TriX-FRX (14), respectively] were likewise substantially increased in the presence of the Qs0321910 SDR (fig. S15).

We next exploited the new SDR to perform large-scale transient expression experiments in *N. benthamiana* to purify the new UGT products. During the previous purifications of the C-3 QA trisaccharide products, we obtained approximately twofold higher yields of the the C-3 rhamnose [QA-TriR (9)] compared with the C-3 xylose version [QA-TriX (8)] (data S4). We therefore opted to generate and purify the putative C-28 glycosides on the basis of the QA-TriR (9) scaffold. After infiltration of 100 to 200 *N. benthamiana* plants, the products were purified and their identities confirmed by extensive 1D and 2D NMR analysis as follows: UGT74BX1 product (3-O-{α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)-[β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-28-O-{β-D-fucopyranosyl ester}-QA) (11) (hereafter abbreviated as QA-TriR-F) (1 mg purified); UGT91AR1 product (3-O-{α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)}-[β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-28-O-{β-D-fucopyranosyl xester}-QA) (13) (hereafter abbreviated as QA-TriR-FR) (43.9 mg purified); and the UGT91AQI product (3-O-{α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)}-[β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-28-O-{β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-fucopyranosyl ester}-QA) (15) (hereafter abbreviated as QA-TriR-FRX) (3.1 mg purified) (tables S8 to S10 and data S4). The terminal sugar in the linear tetrasaccharide at C-28 in saponins such as QS-21 can be either D-xylose or D-apiose (Fig. 1A). Having identified the enzymes that add the first three sugars in the C-28 sugar chain, we performed a final round of screening to identify the sugar transferases that add these sugars. This led to the identification of two further functional UGTs that each generated a product consistent with QA-TriX-FRX plus a pentose, but with slightly different retention times (Fig. 4B). The genes encoding these enzymes, Qs0234130 and Qs0234140 (ranked 14th and 18th, respectively, in table S2), were both located in the chromosome 7 biosynthetic gene cluster 31 with the previously characterized C-28 xylosyltransferase UGT91AQI (data S3). This region is syntenic to the chromosome 11 biosynthetic gene cluster 45, suggesting that the two clusters may share a common evolutionary origin and may have arisen as a consequence of genome duplication (fig. S16). We also found that a predicted UDP-D-apiose/UDP-D-xylose synthase gene, Qs0088320, was highly expressed in *Q. saponaria* leaf primordia. This gene was not physically clustered with the previously characterized saponin biosynthesis genes but showed strong coexpression with them (coexpression with QsbASI, PCC 0.943). Transient expression of this putative UDP-apiose/UDP-xylose synthase (QsAXS) with either Qs0234130 or Qs0234140 resulted in a marked increase (~11-fold) in the amount of the Qs0234140 product generated (fig. S17).

We next performed large-scale transient expression in *N. benthamiana* and purified each of the two new UGT products using the QA-TriR-FRX scaffold (15). Their structures were determined by extensive 1D and 2D NMR as (3-O-{α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)}-[β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-28-O-{β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-fucopyranosyl ester}-QA) (17) (Qs0234140; 13.2 mg purified) (hereafter abbreviated as QA-TriR-FRXX) and (3-O-{α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)}-[β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid}-28-O-{β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-fucopyranosyl ester}-QA) (19) (Qs0234130; 13.2 mg purified) (hereafter abbreviated as QA-TriR-FRXA) (tables S11 and S12 and data S4). Thus, Qs0234130 (UGT73CY3) encodes the terminal xylosyltransferase, and Qs0234140 (UGT73CY2) encodes the terminal C-28 apiosyltransferase (Fig. 4C). The importance of QsAXS in boosting the Qs0234140 product suggests that UDP-α-D-apiose may be lacking in *N. benthamiana*. The fully characterized pathway up to this point is shown in Fig. 5. About one third of characterized QS saponins are derived from these scaffolds (24), making this an important branch point for saponin diversification.

**Mechanism for D-fucosylation**

Given the importance of the SDR encoded by Qs0321910 for enhancing D-fucosylation and subsequent addition of the sugar chain at C-28, we sought to further understand the function of this enzyme. We hypothesized that this enzyme would be responsible for the production of UDP-D-fucose. Despite the fact that plant sugar biosynthetic pathways are generally well characterized, the biosynthetic route to D-fucose in plants is unknown. In bacteria, dTDP-D-glucose is converted to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose by a dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase. The 4-keto group of this intermediate is then reduced by dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose reductase to form dTDP-D-fucose (Fig. 6A) (27). The first of these steps is shared with dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis, and indeed it is known that plants synthesize the analogous UDP-L-rhamnose from UDP-D-glucose through UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose (28). Because UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose would be expected to be present in plant cells as part of UDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis, we hypothesized that the Qs0321910 SDR may function as a 4-ketoreductase. Furthermore,

phylogenetic analysis of this SDR revealed that it is a member of the SDR114C family (fig. S18), as previously defined by Moummou *et al.* (29). Several members of this family have been shown to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols in alkaloid and terpenoid biosynthesis (29–32),

consistent with our proposal that the Qs0321910 SDR may perform C-4 reduction of UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose to form UDP-D-fucose.

To test this hypothesis, we purified the Qs0321910 SDR for functional analysis in vitro (fig. S19). The anticipated UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-

D-glucose substrate is not commercially available. Therefore, to generate this compound from UDP-D-glucose, we cloned and purified a characterized UDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase from the *Acanthocystis turfacaea* chlorella virus 1 (ATCV-1 UGD, GenBank accession no. YP_001427025.1)

(A) Biosynthesis of D-fucose in bacteria. dTDP-D-glucose is converted in a two-step process to dTDP-D-fucose through dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose. (B) In vitro production of QA-TriR-F (11) from QA-TriR and UDP-D-glucose. Top, QA-TriR (9) incubated with UDP-D-glucose and UGT74BX1 only. The addition of ATCV-1 UGD (which converts UDP-D-glucose to UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-glucose) resulted in new products anticipated to be QA-TriR-4K6DG (**) and its hydrate (*) (second from top). No conversion of QA-TriR was observed with the addition of the SDR alone (third from top). However, the combination of ATCV-1 UGD and SDR resulted in total conversion of QA-TriR (9) to QA-TriR-F (11). Mass spectra for the QA-TriR-4K6DG (***) and its hydrate (*) are shown in fig. S47. (C) The SDR reduces the QA-TriR-4K6DG product to form QA-TriR-F (11). QA-TriR was incubated with UDP-D-glucose in the presence of ATCV-1 UGD and UGT74BX1, resulting in the formation of QA-TriR-4K6DG (**) and its hydrate (*). This enzyme mixture was inactivated by boiling before addition of the SDR. LC-MS analysis of the reaction at 0 min (top), 60 min (middle), and 180 min (bottom) revealed the formation of QA-TriR-F with consumption of QA-TriR-4K6DG (**) and its hydrate (*), demonstrating that the SDR reduces the 4-keto-6-deoxy-glucose attached to QA-TriR to form the D-fucose in QA-TriR-F (11).

(33) (fig. S19). We also purified the *Q. saponaria* UGT74BX1 (fig. S19). In a single reaction, we combined UDP-ᴅ-glucose with the purified QA-TriR (9) product and the Qs0321910SDR, ATCV-1 UGD, and UGT74BX1 enzymes. Subsequent LC-MS analysis confirmed the conversion of QA-TriR to a new product consistent with the addition of 4-keto-6-deoxy-ᴅ-glucose, forming QA-TriR-4K6DG. We next heat inactivated the ATCV-1 UGD/UGT74BX1 enzyme mixture before adding the Qs0321910SDR. Subsequent LC-MS analysis revealed the conversion of the putative QA-TriR-4K6DG to a new product identified as QA-TriR-F (Fig. 6C). Our results indicate that the SDR encoded by Qs0321910SDR does not operate at the sugar nucleotide level, but rather reduces 4-keto-6-deoxy-ᴅ-glucose to ᴅ-fucose after transfer to the QA-TriR backbone (Fig. 6D). We therefore named this SDR QsFucSyn.

### Three further steps for production of QS-7

The enzymes discovered up until this point allowed us to make the advanced saponin pathway heptasaccharide intermediates 16, 17, 18, and 19 (Fig. 5). We next searched for the steps needed to make QS-7 (Fig. 1A). Three additional modifications to the C-28 sugar chain are needed to convert 18 into QS-7, specifically the addition of two sugars, L-rhamnose and D-glucose, and an acetyl group (Fig. 7). During our screen for the terminal C-28 glycosyltransferases, we detected putative glucosyltransferase activity for Qs0321940 (UGT9IAP1), and coexpression with the enzyme set for 18 resulted in a product anticipated to be the glucoside of 18 (fig. S23). The gene encoding this enzyme is located within the chromosome 11 biosynthetic gene cluster 45 (Fig. 2D) and is coexpressed with the known QS genes (ranked seventh in table S2; coexpression with QsbASI PCC 0.956). Qs0321940 may therefore encode a glucosyltransferase implicated in QS-7 biosynthesis (fig. S23). Two more steps would then be required to achieve biosynthesis of QS-7, namely the addition of an L-rhamnose and an acetyl group at the C-3 and C-4 positions of D-fucose, respectively. On the basis of the structures of known saponins from *Q. saponaria*, acetylation appears to precede rhamnosylation (fig. S24) (24). We shortlisted 10 candidate *Q. saponaria* BAHD acyltransferase genes on the basis of their levels of coexpression with QsbASI (PCC ≥ 0.9, TPM ≥ 1600) (table S13), successfully cloned and screened seven for activity toward the full heptasaccharide scaffold 18, and identified a single enzyme (encoded by Qs0206480, PCC 0.900) that generated a product with a mass consistent with addition of an acetyl group (fig. S25). Qs0206480 (QsACT1) is located on chromosome 13 and is not clustered with any of the previously characterized genes. We next screened the remaining unassigned UGT candidates for their ability to modify this putative acetylated substrate and identified two enzymes that gave products that likely corresponded to the addition of either L-rhamnose or D-glucose encoded by Qs0023500 (UGT73B44,

ranked 17th in table S2) or Qs0213660 (UGT73B43, ranked 20th in table S2), respectively (fig. S26). These two UGTs belong to subgroup D of the UGT1 family and share 72% amino acid sequence identity. The genes encoding them are not located in predicted biosynthetic gene clusters. Coexpression of these two enzymes, together with the gene set for 18, did not result in a product featuring both sugars, suggesting that the UGTs compete for the same position (fig. S26). Indeed, saponins featuring either L-rhamnose or D-glucose at the C-3 position of fucose have been isolated from *Q. saponaria* (24, 34, 35), with QS-7 featuring L-rhamnose. This therefore strongly suggested that Qs0023500 rhamnosyltransferase is the last outstanding step for QS-7 biosynthesis. We therefore coexpressed the gene set for 18 with the newly discovered candidate glucosyltransferase (Qs0321940), acetyltransferase (Qs0206480), and rhamnosyltransferase (Qs0023500) genes. Subsequent LC-MS analysis revealed a small peak with the same retention time and mass as a QS-7 standard (Fig. 7). Quantification of the QS-7 levels in *N. benthamiana* (7.9 μg/g dry leaf weight) revealed them to be comparable to those found in many tissues of *Q. saponaria*, with the exception of bark, which was about threefold higher (fig. S27). After large-scale infiltration of 410 *N. benthamiana* plants and fractionation by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (see the materials and methods) ~11 mg of semipuré (3 to 5%) QS-7 was obtained. Subsequent 1D and 2D NMR analysis enabled us to assign the structure of this compound as QS-7 (20) on the basis of comparison with published data (34) (figs. S28 to S43). Furthermore, our recorded ¹H NMR spectrum showed complete superimposition with the chemical shifts of a pure QS-7 standard under identical conditions (figs. S44 and S45). Together, these results demonstrate the successful elucidation of the QS-7 pathway and its reconstitution in a heterologous host.

### Conclusion

We report the characterization of a total of 14 *Q. saponaria* enzymes that enable the biosynthesis of the advanced heptasaccharide triterpene glycoside intermediates 16, 17, 18, and 19. We further identify two other enzymes required for efficient glycosylation with the rare sugars D-fucose and D-apiose. A biosynthetic pathway for D-fucose had not previously been characterized despite the widespread occurrence of this sugar in the plant kingdom (21). We initially expected the glycosyltransferase UGT74BX1 to add D-fucose to QA-TriR (9) (Fig. 5), but we and others found no evidence of this sugar nucleotide in representative dicot plants (36). Here, we provide evidence for a different route to D-fucosylation in which UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose serves as the sugar donor for UGT74BX1, with the 4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose

Fig. 7. Production of QS-7. Gene set for production of the core heptasaccharide QA-TriX-FRXA (18) was transiently coexpressed in *N. benthamiana*, along with the Qs0206480, Qs032140, and Qs0206480 genes. LC-MS of *N. benthamiana* leaf extracts revealed a peak with the exact mass and retention time of an authentic moiety attached at the C-28 position of the saponin scaffold then being subsequently reduced in situ to yield D-fucose. This discovery raises broader questions about the origin of D-fucose moieties found in other plant natural products [e.g., foxglove cardiac glycosides (37)].

Using our transient plant expression platform, we have been able to purify all of the QS pathway intermediates from QA to QA-TriR-FRXA in milligram quantities (in some cases tens of milligrams), demonstrating the power of transient plant expression for rapid access to these molecules. We further demonstrate the production of the vaccine adjuvant QS-7 (20). QS-7, unlike QS-21, has negligible toxicity toward animal cells (I). However, despite its promise as an adjuvant, supply of this saponin is limited by its low abundance in *Q. saponaria* bark extracts. Although the levels of QS-7 in *N. benthamiana* were also low, our work opens up for the first time the possibility of producing QS-7 and other related QS molecules in a heterologous expression system. Clearly, optimization of the biosynthetic process with the aim of attaining commercial-scale production levels is beyond the scope of the current work, but our results now make this a very attractive ambition. The availability of the complete genome sequence and comprehensive transcriptome resources for *Q. saponaria* opens up opportunities to use this “instruction manual” to access QS-21 and a diverse array of other QS saponins. Collectively, these advances will enable investigation of the poorly understood relationship between QS saponin structure and adjuvant activity, and ultimately the generation of designer saponins with optimal immunostimulatory activity and low toxicity through metabolic engineering approaches.

**Methods summary**

Detailed materials and methods can be found in the supplementary materials.

**Q. saponaria plant material and saponin quantification**

A *Q. saponaria* sapling (~1m tall) was obtained from Burncoose Nurseries (Cornwall, UK) and maintained in a glasshouse (24°C, 16 hours light). We gave this plant JIC accession no. S10. Extracts (80% methanol) of freeze-dried tissues (young, mature, and old leaves, primordium, green stem, bark, and root, with four biological replicates) were analyzed using a Thermo Scientific QExactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass spectrometer HPLC, and saponin content determined relative to standard curves generated using purified QS-7 and QS-21 samples obtained from Desert King (San Diego, CA, USA).

**Generation of sequence resources for Q. saponaria**

Genes for the biosynthesis of QA were identified by mining the assembled 1KP transcriptome derived from *Q. saponaria* leaves (downloaded from https://www.onekp.com/public_data.html) for candidate oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) and CYP sequences using BLASTP. For discovery of the remaining QS pathway genes, we generated de novo transcriptome data for six different *Q. saponaria* tissues using Illumina HiSeq 4000 PE150 and a draft genome assembly using PacBio Sequel sequencing. A Hi-C library was prepared using the Phase Genomics Plant Hi-C 2.0 Kit (Seattle, WA) and sequenced with Illumina PE75. The draft contig assembly was scaffolded into 14 pseudomolecules using Phase Genomics Proximo software. After RNA-seq-guided genome annotation, the completeness of the gene space was assessed by BUSCO analysis (38).

**Cloning and transient expression**

Oligonucleotide primers were designed on the basis of predicted gene sequences and flanked with attB sites for Gateway cloning (data S1). RNA extracted from primordia and young leaves

was used for cDNA synthesis. RNA isolation was performed using a Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini kit with the modified protocol according to (39). Candidate sequences were amplified, cloned into pDONR207 using BP clonase (ThermoFisher), and sequenced (Eurofins) before being introduced into the binary expression vector pEAQ-HT-DEST1 (40) for transient expression in *N. benthamiana*. For ease of performing infiltrations, in some cases, multiple genes were incorporated into a single binary vector using Golden Gate cloning (41, 42). For screening of candidate genes, agro-infiltrations were performed at a small scale using a needleless syringe (43, 44). For purification of compounds, large-scale vacuum infiltrations were performed as described previously (44). Leaf material was harvested 5 days after infiltration and frozen at –80°C before lyophilization for 24 to 72 hours. All experiments included coexpression of the truncated feedback-insensitive mevalonate pathway enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (tHMGR) to boost triterpene yield (44).

### Metabolite analysis

Standards were obtained from the following sources: oleanolic acid was from Merck; echinocystic acid and QA were from Extrasynthese; and QS-7 and QS-21 were from Desert King. The internal standards coprostanol (GC-MS) and digitoxin (LC-MS) were obtained from Merck. Leaf extracts were analyzed by GC-MS or LC-MS depending on the polarity of the compounds under investigation. Full details of the methods used for metabolite analysis, scale-up and purification of compounds for structural determination by NMR, investigation of QsFucSyn activity, and sugar nucleotide analysis are provided in the full materials and methods in the supplementary materials.
