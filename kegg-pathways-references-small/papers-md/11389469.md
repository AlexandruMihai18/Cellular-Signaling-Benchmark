# LIVING DANGEROUSLY: HOW HELICOBACTER PYLORI SURVIVES IN THE HUMAN STOMACH

**Cesare Montecucco and Rino Rappuoli**

Helicobacter pylori was already present in the stomach of primitive humans as they left Africa and spread through the world. Today, it still chronically infects more than 50% of the human population, causing, in some cases, severe diseases such as peptic ulcers and stomach cancer. To succeed in these long-term associations, *H. pylori* has developed a unique set of virulence factors, which allow survival in a unique and hostile ecological niche—the human stomach.

Helicobacter pylori is a GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIUM, specialized in the colonization of the human stomach¹, a unique ecological niche characterized by very acidic pH—a condition lethal for most microbes. *H. pylori* is so well adapted to this unfriendly environment that, after the first infection, which usually occurs early in life, it establishes a life-long chronic infection². The selection of a niche with no competition and the ability to establish a chronic infection make *H. pylori* one of the most successful human bacterial parasites, which colonizes more than half of the human population³.

The comparison of *H. pylori* isolated from patients of different ethnic origin and geographical locations indicates that their nucleotide sequences segregate similarly to those of humans. This suggests that this bacterium was already present in the stomach of humans when they left Africa to colonize the world, and co-evolved with them since then⁴. Hence, it is likely that primitive humans suffered from stomach aches, although the first written reports were made by ancient Greek doctors and gastric ulcers were first described⁵ in 1586.

Most infected people are asymptomatic, with moderate inflammation detectable only by biopsy and histology. However, an important minority of them (15–20%) during their life develop severe gastroduodenal pathologies, including stomach and duodenal ulcers, ADENOCARCINOMAS and stomach LYMPHOMAS. The different outcomes of the infection are believed to be substantially influenced by an excessive or inappropriate reaction of the host, by bacterial polymorphisms and by environmental factors⁶.

The successful life-lasting colonization of the human stomach by *H. pylori* is achieved through a combination of factors, which address the different challenges presented by the harsh environment (FIG. 1). *H. pylori* synthesizes a urease to buffer the pH of its immediate surroundings within the stomach. Its helicoidal shape and the action of flagella allow it to cross the thick layer of MUCUS lining the stomach. *H. pylori* then binds to LEWIS ANTIGENS present on host gastric cells, and it secretes factors that attract and stimulate inflammatory cells, as well as the multifunctional toxin VacA. Last, the presence of the cag pathogenicity island, a 40-kb DNA that encodes a type IV secretion system, seems to be necessary for optimal fitness of the bacterium and the appearance of pathogenic traits (BOX 1).

### Buffering the pH
To colonize the gastrointestinal tract, a bacterium has to survive in the acid lumen of the stomach⁷. *H. pylori* dedicates several genes to the biosynthesis of a cytosolic urease, a Ni²⁺-containing enzyme⁸,⁹, which hydrolyses urea into NH₃ and CO₂ (FIG. 2). The biosynthesis of urease is governed by a seven-gene cluster, including the genes encoding the UreA (26.5 kDa) and UreB (60.3 kDa) subunits of the urease and the accessory proteins that are

responsible for Ni²⁺ uptake and insertion into the active site of the apo-enzyme²⁹. Urease is a dodecamer of six UreA and six UreB subunits, arranged as a double ring of 13-nm diameter¹⁰. The amount of urease produced by the bacterium varies with culture conditions and may reach as much as 10% of total bacterial protein¹¹.

Urea is taken up by *H. pylori* through a proton-gated channel¹², and its hydrolysis by urease generates ammonia that buffers the cytosol and periplasm, and creates a neutral layer around the bacterial surface (FIG. 2). In vitro, dead *H. pylori* cells release urease, which binds strongly to the surface of living cells¹³, and such a mode of 'surface expression' might also operate in vivo as urease is found on the surface of *H. pylori* present in human biopsies¹⁴.

The essential role of urease as a virulence factor is shown by the fact that urease-defective *H. pylori* mutants cannot colonize the stomach¹⁵. However, urea is toxic to the bacterium at neutral pH because an unfavorable alkaline environment is generated¹⁶. Therefore, the urea channel is regulated positively by protons, opening at acidic pH values to allow more urea in to buffer cytosolic and surface pH, and closing at neutral pH to avoid over-alkalinization.

*H. pylori* urease might cause damage to the host cells through the production of ammonia, an agent known to be toxic by itself and/or in conjunction with neutrophil metabolites on cultured cells and on stomach tissue preparations¹⁷⁻¹⁹. Membrane-permeant weak bases cause various cell alterations, including swelling of intracellular acidic compartments, alterations of vesicular membrane transport, depression of protein synthesis and ATP production, and cell-cycle arrest. Ammonia can also react with intermediates released by the activity of neutrophil myeloperoxidase to form carcinogenic agents that might participate in the *H. pylori*-associated development of stomach adenocarcinoma¹⁸. However, ammonia is toxic at high doses, and the concentration dependence of the toxic effects varies considerably with cell type and culture conditions; therefore, it is not immediately evident how toxic the quantities of ammonia are that *H. pylori* produces in vivo. Moreover, circulation of extracellular fluids should lead to a rapid dilution of the produced ammonia with a marked concentration gradient from the bacterial surface to the medium that surrounds host cells.

The role of urease in the pathogenesis of *H. pylori*-associated diseases is not limited to colonization as ammonia produced by the urease enters the *H. pylori* nitrogen metabolism and is eventually incorporated into proteins²⁰. Urease might also help to recruit neutrophils and monocytes in the inflamed mucosa and to activate production of proinflammatory cytokines²¹. Moreover, urease is one of the main antigens recognized by the human immune response to *H. pylori*²², although the extent and the nature of this immune response after infection are not fully clear²³.

**Figure 1 | Schematic representation of the stomach mucosa colonized by Helicobacter pylori**, showing the main virulence factors involved in colonization and disease. During infection, the bacterium enters the gastric lumen where the urease allows survival in the acidic environment (red indicates a strongly acidic environment, yellow indicates a mildly acidic one) by producing ammonia molecules that buffer cytosolic and periplasmic pH as well as the surface layer around the bacterium (light blue). The flagella propel the helicoidal bacterium into the mucus layer and allow it to reach the apical domain of gastric epithelial cells, to which it sticks using specialized adhesins. *H. pylori* then injects the cagA protein into the host cells by a type IV secretion system and releases other toxic factors such as *H. pylori* neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) and VacA. VacA induces alterations of tight junctions and the formation of large vacuoles. Vacuoles are evident in cells in culture and in the stomach epithelial cells of human and mouse biopsies, although they are not apparent in gerbils. The neutrophil-activating protein HP-NAP crosses the epithelial lining and recruits neutrophils and monocytes, which extravasate and cause tissue damage by releasing reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). Injected Cag proteins cause alteration of the cytoskeleton, pedestal formation, and signal the nucleus to release proinflammatory lymphokines, which amplify the inflammatory reaction with recruitment of lymphocytes and further induce the release of ROIs. The combined toxic activity of VacA and of ROIs leads to tissue damage that is enhanced by loosening of the protective mucus layer and acid permeation.

### Swimming through the mucus
Although well equipped to survive in strong acid, *H. pylori* is not an acidophile and needs to leave the lumen, also to avoid discharge in the intestine. With its polar-sheathed flagella, *H. pylori* is a good swimmer and reaches the thick mucus layer that covers and protects the epithelial lining of the stomach mucosa. Here, propelled by its flagella, the helicoidal-shaped bacterium travels across the viscous mucus film like a screw into a cork; non-motile mutants cannot colonize the stomach mucosa is guided by chemotactic factors, which include urea and bicarbonate ions²⁴,²⁵.

The mucus film is produced by mucous cells that secrete granules containing highly glycosylated proteins²⁶. The secreted glycoproteins, together with an

www.nature.com/reviews/molcellbio  ### Box 1 | A speculative model of the evolution and transmission of *Helicobacter pylori*

Clinical isolates of *H. pylori* are classified as *cag⁺* or *cag⁻*, *vacA⁺* or *vacA⁻*, *babA⁺* or *babA⁻*, depending on whether they have functional genes coding for the cag PAI, VacA and BabA, respectively. Whereas most *babA⁻* isolates have a defective gene, and *vacA⁻* are actually defective in either gene or toxin expression, in most instances *cag⁺* organisms have a complete deletion of the 40 kb of DNA. In fact, the island is excised with low frequency from the chromosome of *cag⁺* strains generating *cag⁻* strains. A model, which might explain the evolution and transmission of *H. pylori*, assumes that *cag⁺*, *vacA⁺*, *babA⁺ H. pylori* strains represent a 'fitness peak', and that inactivation of any of these functions decreases bacterial fitness (see the figure). As a consequence, during the many years the bacterium lives in the stomach of each individual, it continuously generates *cag⁻* or *vacA⁻* or *babA⁻*. The defective derivatives multiply, and in some instances may also outgrow wild-type (wt) bacteria, and therefore both *cag⁺* and *cag⁻* can be isolated from the same individual. However, these defective derivatives cannot take over in the long term and therefore they represent dead branches of the evolutionary tree. In conclusion, only the wild-type bacteria are efficient in long-term colonization and in person-to-person transmission and therefore they are those that govern *H. pylori* evolution.

### Establishing contact

*H. pylori* adheres strongly to gastric cells, and binding is probably mediated by several proteins and glycolipids. BabA, an outer membrane protein of *H. pylori*, binds to the Lewis B-type antigen of human cells [30,31]. Another *H. pylori* protein (HpaA, HP0410) binds sialylated glycojugates [32,33] and the genome of *H. pylori* harbours a gene (HP0492) encoding a closely related protein that could have a similar function [34,35]. Another *H. pylori* lectin binds the sialic residues of laminin [36]. Additional bacterial proteins [37–39] and glycolipids [40] promote the adhesion of *H. pylori* to the gastric epithelium of the host. Cell adhesion is an essential step in *H. pylori* colonization, but one that is very difficult to dissect at the molecular level. Because several copies of putative binding molecules are present on the *H. pylori* cell surface, and electron microscopy reveals extensive areas of adhesion to the host cells, it is difficult to distinguish the relative role of each type of adhesion. In fact, when many ligands are present on the same particle, even single weak binding interactions become relevant to the establishment of a very strong overall interaction, owing to their combined action. So, it is likely that *H. pylori* mutants defective in single genes will never be in the condition to reveal the real contribution of the single binding component because they will adhere with unaltered strength, owing to the presence of the other ligands [33].

*H. pylori* binding to the apical plasma membrane of the tightly sealed, polarized epithelial monolayers is not without consequences for the host cells. The contact with the bacterium is intimate and almost irreversible,

The degree of mucosal damage correlates with neutrophil infiltration \({}^{1,2,43-45}\). *H. pylori* does not invade the epithelial layer, and its components and metabolites have to permeate the epithelial barrier to induce the chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory cells. The identification and dissection of the activities of several *H. pylori* molecules that might be implicated in such a phenomenon is under way.

A 150-kDa protein oligomer composed of identical 15-kDa subunits — *H. pylori* neutrophil-activating protein, or **HP-NAP** — was shown to promote the adhesion of human neutrophils to ENDOTHELIAL CELLS and the production of reactive oxygen radicals \({}^{46,47}\). Purified recombinant HP-NAP, free of LPS, is chemotactic for human neutrophils and monocytes, indicating that it might have a role in the accumulation of these cells at the site of infection \({}^{48}\). HP-NAP is a powerful stimulant of the production of reactive oxygen radicals \({}^{48}\) and acts through a cascade of intracellular activation events, which is completely prevented by pertussis toxin: it includes the increase of cytosolic Ca²⁺ and the phosphorylation of proteins, leading to the assembly of functional NADPH oxidase on the neutrophil plasma membrane \({}^{48}\) (FIG. 3). These features indicate that HP-NAP acts in a CHEMOKINE-like fashion and that its receptor is a seven-transmembrane-spanning type of receptor. HP-NAP also alters the coagulative-FIBRINOLYSIS balance of human monocytes, by increasing the expression of TISSUE FACTOR and of the inhibitor of fibrinolysis PAI-II (REF. 49). This effect occurs at tenfold lower concentrations than those inducing burst and chemotaxis, and it might hamper tissue repair, which requires fibrinolysis.

The nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for HP-NAP is highly conserved among different *H. pylori* isolates, and orthologue genes are present in many bacteria. The atomic structure of HP-NAP reveals a four-helix bundle protein, which oligomerizes to a form a dodecamer with a central iron-containing cavity (G. Zanotti and C.M., unpublished observations). The function of HP-NAP is not known, but we would like to propose that it might be to induce a state of mild to moderate inflammation. This pro-inflammatory activity is further supported by a set of cytokines.

### Box 2 | Bacterial secretion systems

The concept that pathogenic bacteria alter host cells through bacterial toxins, which may diffuse at a distance in the host, is well established. A more recent realization is that many Gram-negative bacteria elaborate alternative systems that directly inject bacterial molecules into adhering cells. A first group of such molecular syringes derives from duplication and re-elaboration through evolution of flagella (type III secretion systems). The second type of molecular syringe (type IV secretion systems) derives from the evolution of conjugative pili, and comprises the cag system (FIG. 5). Both flagella and pili consist of a basal body spanning the inner membrane, the periplasmic space, and the outer membrane, and an external filamentous portion, which may extend at considerable distances out of the bacterial surface. This latter part is an extended helicoidal oligomer of small repeating units, with an axial cavity that can transport the monomers to be added to the tip of the growing filament, as well as proteins and other bacterial molecules into the cytosol of higher eukaryotes. A list of the bacteria known to produce type III and IV secretion systems is listed in TABLE 1. Despite their similar structural architecture, no apparent similarity is evident between the sequences of the protein components of the two families of secretion systems, whereas homology exists among members of the same family. In addition, type IV secretion systems are likely to have a larger inner diameter than type III secretion systems as they can transport protein oligomers (the pentameric pertussis toxin of *Bordetella pertussis*) and protein-DNA complexes (Ti plasmid T-DNA of *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*).

www.nature.com/reviews/molcellbio  ### Figure 3 | Scheme of the intracellular events involved in the HP-NAP activation of human leukocytes

**Helicobacter pylori** neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) binds to a specific receptor, which is coupled to a pertussis toxin (PT-tox)-sensitive trimeric G protein. Binding triggers the entry of calcium through plasma-membrane channels and through the activation of channels located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which are opened by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate Ins(1,4,5)P₃, produced by activated phospholipase C (PLC). The activated HP-NAP receptor also stimulates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIBK) activity, which is inhibited by wortmannin. The rise in the cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration and the activity of PIBK leads to the activation of renaturable kinases that phosphorylate the cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes (p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox), causing their migration to the plasma membrane. Together with the Rac-1 and Rac-2 GTPases, they activate the oxidase activity with production of superoxide anions and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs).

(interleukin-8 (IL-8), GRO, epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78, RANTES, metaphase chromosome protein 1) produced by the stomach mucosa infected by *H. pylori* [50, 51]. The tissue degradation that follows the recruitment and the activation of inflammatory cells would generally not be too harmful to the host, but would strongly promote the production and release of nutrients that are necessary for bacterial growth. Therefore, we speculate that HP-NAP was originally an iron-binding/iron-regulated protein (as HP-NAP-like molecules might still be in other bacteria), and that HP-NAP has later evolved to function as a leukocyte activator. On the host side, human neutrophils might have 'learned' to recognize some of these highly conserved dodecameric iron-binding components as hallmarks of bacteria, similarly to LPS.

#### Causing damage

Vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) is a 95-kDa protein of *H. pylori* that induces the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in cultured cells [52]. Not only is it an important antigen in the human immune response to *H. pylori* [23], but also it is an important virulence factor of *H. pylori*, which confers a strong competitive advantage to wild-type strains with respect to VacA-defective mutants in the colonization of the stomach [53].

VacA is secreted in a two-step process involving an amino-terminal 33-amino-acid signal peptide, which directs secretion from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, and a 45-kDa carboxy-terminal autotransporter, which directs export across the outer membrane. The secreted protein is structured in two distinct parts. First, it has an amino-terminal 37-kDa region, predicted to be rich in β-pleated sheets. This region begins with a 32-residue hydrophobic segment with a propensity to insert into membranes [54], and ends with a protease-sensitive segment. Indeed, part of the VacA toxin released into the medium is nicked at this point [55]. Second, the following 58-kDa part is predicted to consist of two domains, separated by a flexible segment of variable length: the first domain is highly conserved, whereas the second one is genetically considerably diverse [56]. Part of VacA is released in the medium, but 40–60% of the mature VacA remains associated to the outer membrane of *H. pylori*. Apart from strain-dependent sequence variations in the signal sequence of VacA, which influence the amount of VacA released,

VOLUME 2 | JUNE 2001 | 461### Image Description

The image is a scientific illustration titled "Figure 4 | Current model of the cellular alterations induced by VacA cytotoxin." It consists of two parts, labeled **a** and **b**, which describe the structure and mechanism of action of the VacA toxin.

#### Part a:
- **Description**: The toxin is depicted as an oligomer.
- **Structure**: A hexameric structure is shown, indicating that the toxin forms a hexamer when it binds to the plasma membrane.

#### Part b:
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Binding and Insertion**: The VacA toxin binds to the apical portion of epithelial cells and inserts into the plasma membrane, forming a hexameric anion-selective channel of low conductance.
  - **Channel Function**: These channels release bicarbonate and organic anions from the cell cytosol to support bacterial growth.
  - **Endocytosis**: The toxin channels are slowly endocytosed and eventually reach late endosomal compartments, increasing their permeability to anions with enhancement of the electrogenic vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) proton pump.
  - **Vacuole Formation**: In the presence of weak bases, including ammonia generated by Helicobacter pylori urease, osmotically active acidotropic ions accumulate in the endosomes, leading to water influx and vesicle swelling, essential for vacuole formation.
  - **Effect on Tight Junctions**: An unidentified mechanism alters tight junctions, increasing paracellular permeability to provide iron, nickel, and other nutrients essential for H. pylori growth from the underlying mucosa.

### Text Content

#### Main Text

**Membrane of Cells**
- The VacA toxin forms anion-specific channels of low conductance in the plasma membrane of cells. The electrophysiological properties of these channels are similar to those of the hexameric channels that VacA forms in planar lipid bilayers after low-pH activation.

**Oligomerization and Activation**
- The secreted VacA toxin has a strong tendency to oligomerize into rosettes. The oligomeric form of VacA has little vacuolating activity but is activated by short exposure to acidic or alkaline media. Remarkably, it is not denatured at pH 1.5 and shows unusual resistance to pepsin digestion. Low pH dissociates the VacA oligomer into monomers, exposing hydrophobic patches on the surface, which mediate its insertion into biological membranes.

**Epithelial Monolayers and TER**
- Polarized epithelial monolayers develop TRANS-EPITHELIAL RESISTANCE (TER) by sealing the cell borders of adjacent cells through TIGHT JUNCTIONS and other intercellular structures. The measurable TER correlates with the degree of cell sealing. Acid-activated VacA added apically to epithelial monolayers grown on filters induces a rapid drop of TER with a concomitant increase in paracellular permeability to small organic molecules and to Fe³⁺ and Ni²⁺. H. pylori grown on the APICAL SURFACE of the epithelial cells causes the same increase in permeability, whereas VacA-defective H. pylori strains do not. These results indicate that one function of VacA might be to increase the supply of essential nutrients necessary for growth of H. pylori from the underlying tissue. This TER effect of VacA could be mediated through specific interactions with the recently identified cytosolic protein VIP54.

**VacA Activity and Endocytosis**
- VacA activity is blocked by cytochalasin D and by dominant-negative mutants of proteins involved in endocytosis, indicating that plasma-membrane-inserted VacA is endocytosed through an ATP- and actin-dependent mechanism. At least part of VacA is internalized through non-clathrin-coated structures and reaches early and then late endosomes, where the VacA channel is expected to preserve its functions at low pH.

**Vacuole Formation**
- VacA-induced vacuoles are acidic because their limiting membrane contains the vacuolar-type ATPase proton pump (v-ATPase), the operation of which is essential for vacuole formation. Accordingly, vacuoles are promoted by the accumulation of membrane-permeable weak bases that are trapped by protonation in their lumen. These vacuoles contain membrane protein markers of late endosomes and lysosomes, and their formation requires active Rab7, a small GTPase involved in controlling membrane transport through late endosomal compartments. This indicates that vacuole biogenesis is a specific process taking place at the level of late endosomes, and not a generalized swelling of flattened and tubular compartments due to cell damage. Negative-staining electron microscopy of biopsies of stomach mucosa from H. pylori-infected patients and of VacA-treated HeLa cells shows vacuoles largely devoid of the large array of internal membranes and multivesicular bodies characteristic of late endosomes/lysosomes. Therefore, VacA induces an extensive rearrangement of the internal membrane system.

#### Definitions

- **TRANS-EPITHELIAL RESISTANCE (TER)**: Electric resistance across epithelial sheets, measured across the apical-basolateral axis of the cell.
- **TIGHT JUNCTION**: A belt-like region of adhesion between adjacent epithelial or endothelial cells. Tight junctions regulate paracellular flux and contribute to the maintenance of cell polarity by stopping molecules from diffusing within the plane of the membrane.
- **APICAL SURFACE**: Surface of an epithelial or endothelial cell that faces the lumen of a cavity or tube, or the outside of the organism.

- **Description**: The toxin is an oligomer.
- **Structure**: A hexameric structure is shown, indicating that the toxin forms a hexamer when it binds to the plasma membrane.

## Part b
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Binding and Insertion**: The VacA toxin binds to the apical portion of epithelial cells and inserts into the plasma membrane, forming a hexameric anion-selective channel of low conductance.
  - **Channel Function**: These channels release bicarbonate and organic anions from the cell cytosol to support bacterial growth.
  - **Endocytosis**: The toxin channels are slowly endocytosed and eventually reach late endosomal compartments, increasing their permeability to anions with enhancement of the electrogenic vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) proton pump.
  - **Vacuole Formation**: In the presence of weak bases, including ammonia generated by Helicobacter pylori urease, osmotically active acidotropic ions accumulate in the endosomes, leading to water influx and vesicle swelling, essential for vacuole formation.
  - **Effect on Tight Junctions**: An unidentified mechanism alters tight junctions, increasing paracellular permeability to provide iron, nickel, and other nutrients essential for H. pylori growth from the underlying mucosa.

### Main Text

**Membrane of Cells**
- The VacA toxin forms anion-specific channels of low conductance in the plasma membrane of cells. The electrophysiological properties of these channels are similar to those of the hexameric channels that VacA forms in planar lipid bilayers after low-pH activation.

**Oligomerization and Activation**
- The secreted VacA toxin has a strong tendency to oligomerize into rosettes. The oligomeric form of VacA has little vacuolating activity but is activated by short exposure to acidic or alkaline media. Remarkably, it is not denatured at pH 1.5 and shows unusual resistance to pepsin digestion. Low pH dissociates the VacA oligomer into monomers, exposing hydrophobic patches on the surface, which mediate its insertion into biological membranes.

**Epithelial Monolayers and TER**
- Polarized epithelial monolayers develop TRANS-EPITHELIAL RESISTANCE (TER) by sealing the cell borders of adjacent cells through TIGHT JUNCTIONS and other intercellular structures. The measurable TER correlates with the degree of cell sealing. Acid-activated VacA added apically to epithelial monolayers grown on filters induces a rapid drop of TER with a concomitant increase in paracellular permeability to small organic molecules and to Fe³⁺ and Ni²⁺. H. pylori grown on the APICAL SURFACE of the epithelial cells causes the same increase in permeability, whereas VacA-defective H. pylori strains do not. These results indicate that one function of VacA might be to increase the supply of essential nutrients necessary for growth of H. pylori from the underlying tissue. This TER effect of VacA could be mediated through specific interactions with the recently identified cytosolic protein VIP54.

**VacA Activity and Endocytosis**
- VacA activity is blocked by cytochalasin D and by dominant-negative mutants of proteins involved in endocytosis, indicating that plasma-membrane-inserted VacA is endocytosed through an ATP- and actin-dependent mechanism. At least part of VacA is internalized through non-clathrin-coated structures and reaches early and then late endosomes, where the VacA channel is expected to preserve its functions at low pH.

**Vacuole Formation**
- VacA-induced vacuoles are acidic because their limiting membrane contains the vacuolar-type ATPase proton pump (v-ATPase), the operation of which is essential for vacuole formation. Accordingly, vacuoles are promoted by the accumulation of membrane-permeable weak bases that are trapped by protonation in their lumen. These vacuoles contain membrane protein markers of late endosomes and lysosomes, and their formation requires active Rab7, a small GTPase involved in controlling membrane transport through late endosomal compartments. This indicates that vacuole biogenesis is a specific process taking place at the level of late endosomes, and not a generalized swelling of flattened and tubular compartments due to cell damage. Negative-staining electron microscopy of biopsies of stomach mucosa from H. pylori-infected patients and of VacA-treated HeLa cells shows vacuoles largely devoid of the large array of internal membranes and multivesicular bodies characteristic of late endosomes/lysosomes. Therefore, VacA induces an extensive rearrangement of the internal membrane system.

### Definitions

- **TRANS-EPITHELIAL RESISTANCE (TER)**: Electric resistance across epithelial sheets, measured across the apical-basolateral axis of the cell.
- **TIGHT JUNCTION**: A belt-like region of adhesion between adjacent epithelial or endothelial cells. Tight junctions regulate paracellular flux and contribute to the maintenance of cell polarity by stopping molecules from diffusing within the plane of the membrane.
- **APICAL SURFACE**: Surface of an epithelial or endothelial cell that faces the lumen of a cavity or tube, or the outside of the organism.

to pathogenesis and to *H. pylori* survival. It causes a marked decrease of the proteolytic activity in the endocytic pathway, including antigen proteolysis in the antigen-processing compartment of ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS (APC) that is needed to generate peptide epitopes<sup>80</sup>. Consequently, VacA inhibits the stimulation of T-cell clones, specific for epitopes generated in the antigen-processing compartment<sup>80</sup>. The relevance of this effect *in vivo* remains to be established but there is evidence that *H. pylori* does depress the local immune response because VacA-specific CD4+ T CELLS are found at a low frequency in the stomach mucosa of *H. pylori*-infected subjects<sup>81</sup> and persistent *H. pylori* infection down-modulates specific CD8+ CYTOTOXIC T CELL response, prolonging viral infection<sup>82</sup>. The inhibition of local antigen processing by VacA could be part of a strategy of survival for *H. pylori* that could significantly contribute to its chronic infection of the human stomach.

Vacuolation of late endosomal compartments also brings about an extensive alteration of protein transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to late endosomes<sup>83</sup>. Lysosomal acid hydrolases are made in the endoplasmic reticulum as pre-pro-enzymes and reach late endosomes and lysosomes, where the pre- and pro-segments are removed and the hydrolase domains are activated. In VacA-intoxicated cells, pre-pro-acid hydrolases are instead released into the extracellular medium<sup>83</sup>. If the same transport alteration takes place in the epithelial lining of the stomach, the secreted hydrolases can be converted in the apical domain into active enzymes that can loosen the meshwork and thickness of the mucin film with consequent increased permeability to ions and nutrients to support *H. pylori* growth.

### Reaching optimal fitness

*H. pylori* isolates are classified as *cag*<sup>+</sup> and *cag*<sup>-</sup>, depending on the presence of a chromosome pathogenicity island (PAI) of 40 kb, containing ~30 genes, termed cag PAI<sup>84</sup>. PAIs are characterized by a different nucleotide composition with respect to the host bacterial genome; they are flanked by TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS and are usually acquired by HORIZONTAL TRANSFER<sup>85</sup>. Pathogenicity islands seem to increase the fitness of bacteria in a given environment by providing them with environment-specific functions. The cag PAI provides *H. pylori* with at least two unique properties: an increased transmission probability and the transformation of what would be an almost COMMENSAL into a potential pathogen (BOX 1). The role of the cag PAI in pathogenesis is shown by the fact that in Mongolian gerbils *cag*<sup>-</sup> bacteria cause only mild asymptomatic inflammation of the stomach, whereas *cag*<sup>+</sup> organisms cause severe inflammation, gastric ulcers and gastric tumours<sup>86</sup> (TABLE 2). These data are consistent with many epidemiological studies reporting that, in humans, severe gastric diseases are always associated with infection by *cag*<sup>+</sup> strains<sup>87-89</sup>. A major pathogenic event contributed by the cag PAI is the induction of host cells to release pro-inflammatory chemokines<sup>50,51</sup>.

*Values show the frequency (%) of animals with disease when infected with isogenic strains of *Helicobacter pylori*.

The data, which are obtained from experimental infections of Mongolian gerbils, correlate well with epidemiological observations, showing that the presence of the cag pathogenicity island correlates with increased virulence and disease severity in humans.

### An important but unexplored observation about CagA is its high immunogenicity, as judged by the prevalence of antibodies against CagA and by the frequency of CagA-specific T cells in the gastric mucosa of *H. pylori*-infected patients. It is possible that CagA is handled by host cells as a cytosolic viral protein and enters the **MHC class I** antigen presentation pathway.

---

### Fighting the enemy

Urease, CagA, VacA, and HP-NAP, in addition to being important determinants of *H. pylori* stomach colonization and pathogenicity, are also major antigens in the human immune response to *H. pylori* infection. During the past ten years, these antigens have been used in many animal studies and each of them was found to induce an immune response that could protect animals from infection (prophylactic vaccines) and eradicate an already existing infection (therapeutic vaccines). Vaccines to be tested in humans were then developed from one or more of the above antigens expressed in *Escherichia coli*. Both oral or systemic immunization were considered. To render the vaccine effective, oral immunization requires the use of mucosal adjuvants, such as the cholera toxin or the *E. coli* heat-labile enterotoxins (LT). However, these are used only in animal models because of their toxicity. Recently, several non-toxic derivatives, which can be safely used in humans, were developed, with LTK63 and LTR72 being the most promising ones. An intriguing question that derives from animal experiments concerns the possible mechanism of protection of *H. pylori* vaccines. In γ-globulin-deficient mice, immune protection was achieved in the total absence of antibodies and was mediated by CD4⁺ T cells.

If the continuing clinical studies for the human vaccine are successful, we might soon witness the elimination of a pathogen that has been living in humans for more than 150,000 years.

### Injecting the host

About a dozen genes of the cag PAI code for the building blocks of a secretion apparatus—a type IV secretion system—that delivers bacterial proteins directly into the cytosol of host cells. Cytotoxin-associated gene A (*cagA*), a 128–145-kDa protein that becomes phosphorylated in the cytosol of host cells, is the only protein known so far to be injected by *H. pylori* into host cells. This is the first evidence of a functional secretion apparatus in *H. pylori*, previously inferred only from sequence comparisons. It is likely that other *H. pylori* proteins are delivered in a similar way, as the intact type IV secretion system, but not CagA, is required to induce the secretion of IL-8 from gastric epithelial cells, although it cannot be excluded that the mere insertion of the *H. pylori* type IV needle into the host plasma membrane is sufficient to activate endogenous signals (FIG. 5). The factors responsible for this effect have not been identified, but the activation of the nuclear transcription factors NF-κB and AP1, and of the cytosolic phospholipase A₂ after the stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the p21-activated kinase has been documented.

CagA injected by *H. pylori* is tyrosine-phosphorylated and may bind Src homology region 2 domain (SH2)-containing proteins, forming a signalling complex that promotes the reorganization of cortical actin, and, possibly, of some membrane components of the apical membrane. The signalling events triggered by phosphorylated CagA are still to be unravelled. However, the actin polymerization and the formation of pedestals formed shortly after bacterial adhesion are believed to be due to CagA injection.

The demonstration that virulent *H. pylori* contain a 40-kb foreign DNA (called pathogenicity island or PAI) coding for a type IV secretion system represented a milestone in the understanding of *H. pylori* pathogenesis and provided an explanation for the presence of the *cagA* gene only in a subset of strains.
