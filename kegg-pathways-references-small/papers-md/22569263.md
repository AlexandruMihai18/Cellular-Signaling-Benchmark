## ABSTRACT

Crocin is an apocarotenoid glycosyl ester accumulating in fruits of *Gardenia jasminoides* and used as a food coloring and nutraceutical. For the first time, the two glucosyltransferases UGT75L6 and UGT94E5 that sequentially mediate the final glucosylation steps in crocin biosynthesis in *G. jasminoides* have been identified and functionally characterized. UGT75L6 preferentially glucosylates the carboxyl group of crocetin yielding crocetin glucosyl esters, while UGT94E5 glucosylates the 6′ hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety of crocetin glucosyl esters. The expression pattern of neither UGT75L6 nor UGT94E5 correlated with the pattern of crocin accumulation in *G. jasminoides*.

## 1. Introduction

Crocin is a digentiobiosyl ester of crocetin, an apocarotenoid aglycone, and is present [1] in saffron (stigmas of *Crocus sativus*) as a yellow pigment together with a series of crocetin glucosyl esters (Fig. 1). Crocetin glucosyl esters have been used as a water-soluble food coloring and have attracted attention as nutraceuticals owing to their pharmacological benefits [2,3]. The first step specific to crocin biosynthesis is the position-specific cleavage of zeaxanthin to yield crocetin dialdehyde [4]. Crocetin dialdehyde is then oxidized to crocetin. Sequential glucosylation of crocetin leads to a final product, crocin (crocetin-di-(β-gentiobiosyl)-ester; crocin-1) as shown in Fig. 1.

Among the enzymes participating in crocin biosynthesis, a cDNA clone (CsZCD) encoding zeaxanthin 7,8 (7′,8′)-cleavage dioxygenase was isolated from *C. sativus* [5]. As for the enzymes catalyzing glucose conjugation of crocetin, their activity was first detected in a cell-free extract prepared from callus tissues of *C. sativus* [6]. Subsequently, a glucosyltransferase, catalyzing the ester bond formation between the carboxyl residues of crocetin and the glucosyl moiety of UDP-glucose, was partially purified from cultured *C. sativus* cells [7] and a cDNA clone (UGTCs2) encoding a crocetin glucosyltransferase was isolated from saffron [8]. However, the recombinant UGTCs2 produced unnatural products with more than 9 glucose molecules attached to crocetin, suggesting that UGTCs2 is not involved in crocin biosynthesis in planta. *Gardenia jasminoides* accumulates crocetin glucosyl esters, mostly crocin, in its fruits [1]. In the present investigation, we used homology-based cloning to isolate and identify UGT75L6 and UGT94E5 as apocarotenoid glucosyltransferases involved in the sequential glucosylation of crocetin to crocin in *G. jasminoides*. Our finding not only sheds light on novel glucosyltransferases responsible for crocin biosynthesis, but may lead to metabolic engineering of this commercially important plant pigment.

culture and Technology. Crocetin was prepared by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of crocin obtained from San-Ei Gen F.F.I., Inc. (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals were of commercial reagent-grade quality.

### 2.3. Biotransformation of crocetin

Crocetin (3.0 μmol) was dissolved in DMSO and added to cell suspension cultures of *G. jasminoides* through membrane filters. Cells were collected by vacuum filtration at an appropriate time, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C until use. Extraction and HPLC analysis of the biotransformation product is described in the [Supplementary Material](#).

### 2.4. Isolation and identification of glucosylation products of crocetin

To identify the glucosylation products, the methanol extracts were concentrated to dryness in vacuo. These extracts were separated by DIAION HP20 (Mitsubishi Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) and Sephadex LH20 (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) column chromatographies and the products obtained were further purified by preparative HPLC. The isolated products were analyzed by ¹H-

NMR spectroscopy using a JNM α-500 spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The LC-MS analyses were carried out using a QUATTRO Premier XE mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).

### 2.5. PCR cloning and heterologous expression of glycosyltransferase cDNAs

Full-length cDNA clones encoding glycosyltransferases, their heterologous expression, and purification of the N-terminal fusion proteins with a His₆ tag were described in the previous paper [9]. A C-terminal fusion protein was obtained by subcloning an open reading frame (ORF) of a cDNA clone into the pET22b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) and an *Escherichia coli* strain, Rosetta-gami2 (Novagen), was used as the expression host. Protein content in the enzyme preparations was estimated using the Bradford method [10].

### 2.6. Enzyme assay

Glucosyltransferase activities toward crocetin and crocetin glucosyl-esters were screened as described in the [Supplementary Material](#).

## 2.7. Analysis of gene expression by RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and organs of *G. jasminoides* using an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and a Fruit-mate (Takara, Shiga, Japan). First-strand cDNAs for RT-PCR were synthesized from 0.5 μg total RNA using SuperScript III RNase H⁻ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Gene-specific primer sets used for RT-PCR are shown in Supplementary Table S1. The specific annealing of each primer set to the target cDNA was confirmed by PCR using cDNA clones GjUGT1–GjUGT15 as templates. The 60S acidic ribosomal protein P0C primer pair was used as an internal control. Signal intensity was analyzed using the Image J software ([http://vsb.info.nih.gov/ij](http://vsb.info.nih.gov/ij)).

## 2.8. Quantitative determination of crocetin glucosides

Plant tissues of *G. jasminoides* were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, and the powdered tissues (0.5 g) were sonicated in 1 ml of 70% (v/v) methanol for leaves, stems, and flowers, or 70% (v/v) ethanol for fruits. The extracts were subjected to HPLC analysis by the same procedure as described in Section 2.3.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Crocetin glucosylation by cultured *G. jasminoides* cells

Crocetin was added to cell suspension cultures of *G. jasminoides* to a final concentration of 0.1 mM at 4 days after cell inoculation, and the cells were cultured for an additional 8 h. At least four potentially glycosylated products (CG1–CG4) were detected when the methanol extract of *G. jasminoides* cells supplemented with crocetin was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 2). All the products yielded crocetin when digested with almond β-glucosidase.

These products were purified by column chromatography and finally isolated by preparative HPLC. The ¹H-NMR spectra of CG1 and CG2 were completely identical to those of crocetin-di-(β-gentiobiosyl)-ester (crocin-1) and crocetin-(β-glucosyl)-(β-gentiobiosyl)-ester (crocin-2), respectively [1]. The ¹H-NMR data are shown in Supplementary Table S2. In the LC–ESI-MS analysis, the peaks corresponding to CG3 and CG4 exhibited the same dominant ions at m/z 675 (crocetin + glucose × 2 + Na). Based on their dominant ions in MS and retention times in HPLC, CG3 and CG4 were tentatively identified as crocetin-di-(β-glucosyl)-ester (crocin-3), and crocetin-mono-(β-gentiobiosyl)-ester (crocin-4), respectively, because the polarity of crocin-3 is higher than that of crocin-4.

### 3.2. Identification of UDP-glucose:crocetin glucosyltransferase

In addition to 13 full-length cDNAs (GjUGT1–GjUGT13) of family 1 plant secondary product glucosyltransferases (PSPGs) described previously [9], we obtained two additional PSPG cDNAs (GjUGT14 and GjUGT15) by homology-based cloning from cultured *G. jasminoides* cells.

ORFs of the 15 cDNAs were expressed in *E. coli* as N-terminal fusion proteins with His₆ tags. The crude enzyme extracts corresponding to GjUGT1–GjUGT14 were used for the glucosyl transfer assay using crocetin as a glucose acceptor substrate in the presence of UDP-glucose. The crude enzyme containing the recombinant GjUGT1 or GjUGT14 converted crocetin to two more polar metabolites (Fig. 3). The ¹H-NMR spectrum of the major product CG5 isolated by preparative HPLC was completely identical to that of crocetin-mono-(β-glucosyl)-ester (crocin-5) described previously [1]. The ¹H-NMR data are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The minor product was presumably identified as crocin-3 because the UV-visible spectrum and the retention time were identical with those of CG3. Neither the other recombinant proteins nor the crude enzyme preparation from *E. coli* harboring the control vector produced glucosylation products from crocetin.

The GjUGT1 cDNA contains an ORF corresponding to a protein (UGT75L6) of 474 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 53.0 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of GjUGT14 is 99% identical with that of GjUGT1. UGT75L6 shares the highest (69%) amino acid identity with NtGT2 from *Nicotiana tabacum* [11] and UGT73A10 from *Lycium barbarum* [12], but exhibits only 33% identity with UGTs2 reported as a crocetin glucosyltransferase in *C. sativus* [8].

### 3.3. Functional characterization of UGT75L6

To investigate the catalytic function of UGT75L6, we tried to purify the N-terminal His₆-tagged protein of UGT75L6 by nickel affinity chromatography. However, UGT75L6 could not be purified in any condition because of the low expression level. We also tried to create and purify C-terminal His₆-tagged UGT75L6 using a pET22b vector and the *E. coli* strain Rosetta-gami2. Although the expression level of UGT75L6 was increased compared with that of the N-terminal tagged protein, purification was yet unsuccessful. Therefore, we used the crude enzyme preparation containing the C-terminal-tagged UGT75L6 for further investigation. The glucosyl-acceptor specificity of UGT75L6 was examined using various substrates shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. HPLC analysis revealed

**Fig. 2.** HPLC profiles of biotransformation products of crocetin from cultured *G. jasminoides* cells. Crocetin was added to cell suspension cultures of *G. jasminoides* and incubated for 8 h. A methanol extract of the collected cells was subjected to HPLC separation. CG1, CG2, CG3, and CG4 are glucosylation products and identified as crocin-1, crocin-2, crocin-3, and crocin-4, respectively.

**Fig. 3.** Glucosylation of crocetin by GjUGT14 (UGT75L6). Crocetin was incubated with GjUGT14 in the presence of UDP-glucose for 5 min (A) and 30 min (B), and the assay mixture was subjected to HPLC analysis. CG5 was identified as crocin-5.

the formation of a product with higher water solubility than the substrate when 4-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, or ferulic acid was used as the acceptor substrate. The UV-visible spectra and retention times of the products were identical to those of authentic samples of glucosyl esters of the corresponding phenolic carboxylic acid (data not shown). No products corresponding to their O-glucosides were detected from any of the substrates. No activity was detected when indole-3-acetic acid, bixin, or norbixin was used as the glucosyl acceptor.

Kinetic parameters of UGT75L6 for acceptor substrates using UDP-glucose as a sugar-donor substrate were determined. The apparent \( K_m \) value for crocetin was \( 0.46 \pm 0.19 \) mM (mean ± standard deviation from triplicate measurements). The apparent \( K_m \) values for phenolic carboxylic acids (\( 1.5 \pm 0.38 \) mM for 4-coumaric acid, \( 2.5 \pm 0.80 \) mM for caffeic acid, and \( 1.7 \pm 0.22 \) mM for ferulic acid) were at least threefold higher than that for crocetin. UGT75L6 (GjUGT1) exhibited the highest specific activity toward crocetin, followed by 4-coumaric acid (26% of crocetin), ferulic acid (17%), and caffeic acid (13%).

### 3.4. Identification of UDP-glucose: crocetin glucosyl ester glucosyltransferase

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of 15 PSPGs isolated from G. jasminoides indicated that GjUGT9 and GjUGT15 belong to Group A (Fig. 4). Since PSPGs in this group catalyze sugar chain elongation of flavonoid glycosides or anthocyanins [13], we predicted that GjUGT9 and/or GjUGT15 exhibit glucosyltransferase activity toward crocetin glucosyl esters.

We examined the catalytic activity of GjUGT9 and GjUGT15 toward crocetin glucosyl esters produced by UGT75L6 (Fig. 5). When recombinant GjUGT9 was added to the reaction mixture, the peaks corresponding to crocetin glucosyl esters decreased rapidly. Products whose UV spectra and retention times were identical to those of crocetin gentiobiosyl esters (crocin-1, crocin-2, and crocin-4) increased in a time-dependent manner, and crocin-1 accumulated as the sole product after prolonged incubation. No further elongation of glucose residues was observed. This conversion of crocetin glucosyl esters to crocetin gentiobiosyl esters was not observed when the recombinant GjUGT15 was added to the reaction mixture.

The GjUGT9 cDNA encodes a protein (UGT94E5) of 444 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 49.8 kDa. The amino acid sequence of UGT94E5 shares 54% identity with a quercetin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase from Catharanthus roseus [14].

#### 3.5. Functional characterization of UGT94E5

Kinetic parameters of UGT94E5 for crocetin glucosyl esters using UDP-glucose as the sugar-donor substrate were determined using the affinity-purified protein (Table 1). The apparent \( K_m \) values for crocin-5 (crocetin monoglucosyl ester) and crocin-3 (croce-tin diglucosyl ester) were 0.072 and 0.023 mM, respectively. The \( k_{cat}/K_m \) ratio for crocin-3 was sixfold higher than that for crocin-5. We also tested the glucosylation activity of UGT94E5 on various naturally occurring glucosides such as flavonoid glucosides and coumarin glucosides as well as unnatural glucosides such as curcumin glucosides and 4-nitrophenyl glucoside. The chemical structures of these compounds are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Except that weak glucosylation activity toward curcumin glucosides was detected by HPLC analysis, none of these compounds served as substrates for UGT94E5.

#### 3.6. Expression of the UGT75L6 and UGT94E6 gene in G. jasminoides

To compare the expression levels of UGT75L6 and UGT94E5 among various G. jasminoides tissues, we examined the mRNA lev-

Subsequently, recombinant UGT94E5 was added to the reaction mixture which was further incubated for 15 min (B), and 60 min (C). The reaction was terminated by adding methanol and glucosylation products were analyzed by HPLC.

els of GjUGT1, GjUGT14, and GjUGT9 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6A and B). mRNA expression of the three PSPGs was detected in all the organs of G. jasminoides. The expression level of GjUGT1 was highest in the cultured cells and lowest in the stem, whereas that of GjUGT14 was lowest in the cultured cells.

Crocetin glucosyl ester contents in G. jasminoides fruits at various developmental stages were quantitatively determined (Fig. 6C). Apocarotenoid content gradually increased in parallel with fruit development. Crocin-1 was the predominant crocetin glucosyl ester in G. jasminoides fruits irrespective of the developmental stage. There was no significant correlation between the mRNA levels of the three PSPGs and the pigment accumulation during fruit development. Crocetin glucosyl esters were detected in neither flowers, leaves, nor stems.

4. Discussion

Glycosyltransferases constitute an enzyme superfamily responsible for attaching sugar moieties to a wide array of acceptor substrates including carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and secondary metabolites [15,16]. Plant secondary metabolite glycosyltransfer-

Fruits, leaves, and stems were collected from a single G. jasminoides plant on the same day, powdered in liquid nitrogen, and used for mRNA preparation and HPLC analysis of crocetin glucosyl esters. The fruits were classified into six maturation stages based on their red coloration. Each box and bar represent an average value with standard deviation from triplicate measurements.

consistent with the previous finding that many PSPGs belonging to Group L catalyze the regioselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids [18]. The \(K_{\mathrm{m}}\) value of UGT85A24 for crocetin (0.46 mM) is in the same range of the \(K_{\mathrm{m}}\) values of other glucosyltransferases belonging to Group L such as indole-3-acetic acid glucosyltransferase of Arabidopsis (0.24 mM) and cinnamic acid glucosyltransferase from strawberry (0.36 mM) [19,20]. UGT75L6 shares only 35% identity with C. sativus UGTs2, which produces unnatural crocetin glucosyl esters with at least 9 glucose residues. This suggests that

the PSPGs responsible for the glucosylation of crocetin during crocin biosynthesis in saffron remain unidentified, though no similar sequence was found using UGT75L6 sequence as a query against the EST database constructed from saffron [21].

UGT94E5 is a new member of sugar-sugar glycosyltransferases and catalyzes the β1 → 6 glucosylation of the sugar moiety of crocetin glucosyl esters. Among naturally occurring glucoside substrates, UGT94E5 specifically catalyzed glucosyl chain elongation toward crocetin glucosyl esters. The kinetic analysis exhibited that

crocin-3 is a more preferable glucose accepting substrate of UGT94E5 than crocin-5. Crocin-2 was also efficiently converted to crocin-1 by UGT94E5 although the kinetic parameters could not be determined because of the limited supply of the substrate (data not shown). To our interest, the activity of UGT94E5 was inhibited by crocin-5 above 0.2 mM while such substrate inhibition was not observed for crocin-3. All these results may indicate that most of crocin-5 is converted not to crocin-4 but to crocin-3 which is then rapidly glucosylated to the final product crocin-1.

Although UGT75L6 and UGT94E5 were isolated from cell suspension cultures of G. jasminoides, RT-PCR experiments clearly showed that both genes are expressed in various organs of intact G. jasminoides plants. Their expression levels vary somewhat among organs but are not correlated with the accumulation of crocin pigment, suggesting that these are not rate-limiting enzymes in crocin biosynthesis in the plants. Availability of the apocarotenoid substrate (crocetin or crocetin dialdehyde) of the glucosyltransferases may limit crocin biosynthesis in planta. In fact, zeaxanthin cleavage dioxygenase (CsZCD) is expressed specifically in stigma of C. sativus [5].

The present investigation unambiguously demonstrated that crocetin is sequentially glucosylated to crocin in fruits of G. jasminoides by two distinct UGTs. It is interesting to note that the WoLF PSORT algorithm [22] predicted that UGT75L6 is most likely localized in the chloroplast and UGT94E5 in the cytoplasm. Because mature fruits have no chloroplasts, chromoplasts are the most likely location of UGT75L6 in developing G. jasminoides fruits. Recently, CsCCD4, an isoform of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase most closely related to the previously isolated CsZCD from C. sativus, was found to be targeted to the plastoglobules of plastids in saffron [23]. We assumed that crocetin is formed from zeaxanthin and converted to crocetin glucosyl esters by UGT75L6 in chromoplasts, the esters are then glucosylated to gentiobiosyl esters (mostly crocin-1) in the cytoplasm by UGT94E5, and these product esters are finally accumulated in vacuoles. Cellular localization of these PSPGs awaits further investigation.

Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases with various substrate and regioselectivities have been isolated from a wide array of higher plants including C. sativus [24]. We have recently isolated a cDNA clone encoding crocetin dialdehyde dehydrogenase from G. jasminoides (unpublished results). The isolation and identification of UGT75L6 and UGT94E5 as crocetin glucosyltransferases that we have described will contribute not only to our basic understanding of the crocin biosynthesis pathway but also, in combination with carotenoid dioxygenases and apocarotenoid dialdehyde dehydrogenase, will open the way for the production of structurally modified apocarotenoid glucosyl esters of high pharmacological and commercial value.
