### Introduction

Ceramides are the lipid backbones of sphingomyelin,¹² ceramide phosphoinositides,³ and other glycosphingolipids.⁴⁵ They are composed of a long-chain (sphingoid) base with an amide-linked fatty acid. Sphingosine (*trans*-4-sphingenine) is the major long-chain base of most sphingolipids, but lesser amounts of other chain length homologs, dihydrosphingosines (sphinganines), and 4-hydroxysphinganines (phytosphinganines) are also found.⁶ The term sphingosine is sometimes used to refer to the entire class of long-chain bases, although this is not preferred. The amide-linked fatty acids of ceramides typically have alkyl chain lengths from 16 to 24 carbon atoms (unbranched); only small percentages are branched or monounsaturated, but *α*-hydroxy fatty acids are common in some sphingolipid subclasses.⁶ An overall scheme for ceramide biosynthesis is shown in Fig. 1,⁷⁸ and assays for each of the three reasonably well-characterized enzymes of this pathway are given in this chapter (each enzyme is named according to the recommended name, followed by common and systematic names and number assigned by the Enzyme Commission). It should be borne in mind, however, that other routes for ceramide biosynthesis are also possible, as none of these enzymes have been purified to homogeneity.

#### Ceramide Biosynthesis Pathway

**Fig. 1. Ceramide biosynthesis.** The most likely pathway for ceramide biosynthesis *de novo* is shown. The initial condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase, followed by NADPH-dependent reduction of the 3-keto group by 3-ketosphinganine reductase and addition of the amide-linked fatty acid by ceramide synthase(s). The formation of the 4-trans double bond has not been demonstrated directly, but it appears to occur after the synthesis of dihydroceramides.

### Chemical Reactions and Enzymes

   - **Enzyme:** Serine Palmitoyltransferase (3-Ketosphinganine Synthase)
   - **EC Number:** EC 2.3.1.50

$^{14}$C-labeled serine into chloroform-soluble products in an assay cocktail that contains EDTA or EGTA to inhibit phosphatidylserine synthesis. This assay can be conducted with microsomes ${}^{12,13}$ or cells in culture, ${}^{14,15}$ and it has been modified to allow assays of single colonies of cells. ${}^{16}$

The assay contains 0.1 $M$ HEPES buffer (pH 8.0 at $37^{\circ}$), 5 $mM$ dithiothreitol (DTT), 2.5 $mM$ EDTA (pH adjusted to neutrality before use), 50 $\mu M$ pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, 0.2 $mM$ palmitoyl-CoA, 1 $mM$ $^{3} \mathrm{H}-$ or $^{14} \mathrm{C}$-labeled L-serine (specific activity 10–30 mCi/mmol), and the enzyme source (e.g., 50–150 $\mu g$ of microsomal protein) for a total volume of 0.1 ml in 13 × 100 mm screw-capped test tubes. The reaction is initiated by adding palmitoyl-CoA (to minimize depletion of this substrate by active fatty acyl-CoA hydrolases) and, after incubation at $37^{\circ}$ for 10 min, is terminated with 1.5 ml of chloroform–methanol (1:2, v/v).

To extract the products, approximately 25 $\mu g$ of sphinganine (which is as effective as the actual product, 3-ketosphinganine) is added as carrier, and 1 ml of chloroform and 2 ml of 0.5 $N$ $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ are added. The tubes are mixed, centrifuged for several minutes in a tabletop centrifuge, and the aqueous layer is removed by aspiration. The lower phase is washed twice with 2 ml of water, then 0.8 ml of the chloroform layer (representing approximately half of the total product formed) is transferred to scintillation vials. The solvent is evaporated, 4 ml of a standard scintillation cocktail is added, and the samples are counted.

To correct for chloroform-soluble contaminants in the radiolabeled serine, additional incubation tubes are prepared with all of these components except palmitoyl-CoA. Most commercial preparations of [$^{3} \mathrm{H}$]serine contain such contaminants, but they can be removed with a small ion-exchange column. ${}^{12}$

Other factors to consider in optimizing the assay conditions are (1) linearity with time and enzyme amount, which is particularly important since high levels of fatty acyl-CoA hydrolases can deplete the cosubstrate; (2) a check of the optimal palmitoyl-CoA concentration, since this substrate can be depleted under some conditions but can also be inhibitory at high levels; and (3) form of the radiolabel, because it is preferable to conduct the assay with either L-[3-$^{14} \mathrm{C}$]- or L-[3-$^{2} \mathrm{H}$]serine (rather than

uniformly labeled serine, which is less expensive) since the α-hydrogen is lost in the course of the reaction [17] and, hence, the specific activity of the product can be calculated with greater certainty.

Other ways of detecting the products of this enzyme are to resolve the products by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel plates developed with chloroform–methanol–2 N NH₄OH (40:10:1, v/v) [9, 10, 12]; or, to trap the ¹⁴CO₂ liberated from [1-carboxyl-¹⁴C]serine or uniformly labeled [¹⁴C]serine. [12, 18] For this, the assay is conducted in tubes with a septum stopper fitted with a cup (Kontes, Vineland, NJ, K-882320-000), and at the end of the assay 0.1 ml of Protosol is added to the cup to trap the ¹⁴CO₂ and 1% perchloric acid is added to the assay solution. After 1 hr of gentle shaking, the cup is removed and the radioactivity determined by scintillation counting.

**Substrate Specificity.** Depending on the system studied, serine palmitoyltransferase has been reported to have an apparent *K*ₘ for L-serine of 0.1 to 1 mM. [12, 18] No other amino acids have been reported to substitute for L-serine as substrate; however, a number of amino acid analogs are inhibitors of this enzyme. Cycloserine [19] and β-haloalanines [20] irreversibly inactivate serine palmitoyltransferase by “suicide” inhibition, as predicted by the proposed mechanism for this enzyme. [17]

Serine palmitoyltransferase has a high degree of specificity for palmitoyl-CoA; it best utilizes linear, saturated fatty acyl-CoA’s of 16 ± 1 carbon atoms, [12, 18] which corresponds to the prevalence of 18-carbon sphingosine bases (i.e., with 16 carbons from palmitic acid and 2 from serine) in most cellular sphingolipids. [5] α-Fluoropalmitic acid has been reported to inhibit long-chain base synthesis; however, this is thought to be due to inhibition of palmitoyl-CoA formation. [21]

Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate can be resolved from serine palmitoyltransferase by dialyzing the enzyme against cysteine to form the thiazolidine. The apparent *K*ₘ for pyridoxal 5′-phosphate in reconstituting the apoenzyme thus prepared is approximately 1 μM. [12]

**Sequence.** This enzyme has only been purified (>100-fold) from *Bacteroides melaninogenicus*. [22] However, the gene for serine palmitoyltransferase has recently been cloned from yeast. [23] There is a high degree of

homology with δ-aminolevulinate synthase, a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes a condensation reaction between glycine and succinyl-CoA that is similar to that of serine palmitoyltransferase.

**Regulation.** Relatively little is known about the regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase. Its activity correlates with the relative level of sphingolipid synthesis by tissues, [13,20,24] and addition of long-chain bases as part of the sphingolipids of lipoproteins [25,26] or short-chain analogs of sphingosine [27] reduce flux through the pathway. In the latter case, this appears to be due to down-regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase. [28]

### 3-Dehydrosphinganine Reductase (3-Ketosphinganine Reductase) [D-erythro-dihydrosphingosine : NADP⁺ 3-Oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.102]

The next reaction of ceramide biosynthesis is the reduction of 3-ketosphinganine to sphinganine by an NADPH-dependent reductase found in microsomes. [29,30]

#### Assay.
Incubation mixtures contain 50 μM 3-[4,5-³H]ketosphinganine (prepared as described below), 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 1 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM thioglycol (or DTT), 250 μM NADPH (or an NADPH-regenerating system as described in Ref. 12 and 28), and varying amounts of protein (e.g., 50–150 μg of microsomal protein) for a total volume of 0.1 ml in 13 × 100 mm screw-capped test tubes. 3-[³H]Ketosphinganine is added either in a small amount of Triton X-100 [for a final concentration of less than 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in the assay] or by transfer of the substrate to the assay test tube in an organic solvent, evaporation of the solvent under a stream of N₂, and immediate addition of the rest of the assay components, followed by thorough mixing and/or sonication.

The reaction is initiated by adding the NADPH and, after incubation at 37°C for 10 min, is terminated with 1.5 ml of chloroform–methanol (1:2, v/v), and 25 μg of carrier sphinganine is added. The products are extracted as described for serine palmitoyltransferase, and the final lipid extract is applied to silica gel TLC plates (silica gel H, Brinkmann, Westbury, NY).

The plates are developed in chloroform–methanol–2 N NH₄OH (40:10:1, v/v), and the region corresponding to [³H]sphinganine can be established by scanning the chromatoplate, by fluorography, or by lightly spraying the plate with ninhydrin (0.1% in ethanol) and heating the plate to visualize the bluish purple spot from the sphinganine carrier. In this system, typical \( R_f \) values relative to the solvent front are 0.7 for 3-ketosphinganine, 0.45 for sphingosine, and 0.35 for sphinganine. The appropriate regions of the chromatoplate are scraped into scintillation vials, 0.2 ml of water and 4 ml of a detergent-based aqueous counting cocktail are added, and the amount of radiolabel is determined with the appropriate corrections for quenching.

The activity of 3-ketosphinganine reductase can also be estimated by a two-step assay involving incubation of microsomes first with radiolabeled serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine, then with NADPH or an NADPH-regenerating system.¹²

**Substrate Specificity.** Studies with an 84-fold purified preparation of the reductase from beef liver microsomes³¹ found that only the B-hydrogen from NADPH is transferred to 3-ketosphinganine; earlier studies had shown that NADH is not an effective reductant. Only the D-isomer of 3-ketosphinganine is reduced, but both C₁₈- and C₂₀-3-ketosphinganines were reduced.

**Regulation.** 3-Dehydrosphinganine reductase appears to be much more active than the first enzyme of this pathway because none of the keto intermediate is found when microsomes are incubated with serine, palmitoyl-CoA, and NADPH¹²,³² or when intact cells are incubated with [¹⁴C]serine.³³

### Sphingosine/Sphinganine Acyltransferase [(Dihydro) ceramide Synthase]
[Acyl-CoA : Sphingosine N-Acyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.24]

The next step of ceramide synthesis appears to be the addition of a long-chain fatty acid to sphinganine (earlier texts had indicated that sphinganine is converted to sphingosine first; however, this reaction has not been shown directly).⁸ (Dihydro) ceramide synthesis can be assayed with either [³H]sphingosine or [³H]sphinganine, and it is thought to involve both CoA-dependent³⁰,³⁴⁻³⁶ and CoA-independent¹¹,³⁷,³⁸ enzymes. There is

also some evidence for ceramide synthesis by reversal of ceramidase,^{39,40} but this is thought to be of limited biological significance.^{41} An assay for the CoA-dependent enzyme(s) that is prevalent in brain and liver microsomes follows.

**Assay.** Incubation mixtures contain 1 μM [3- or 4,5-³H]sphinganine or [³H]sphingosine prepared as described below or produced as a custom synthesis by a commercial supplier (we have obtained [³H]sphingosine from New England Nuclear, Boston, MA), 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM DTT, 100 μM stearoyl-CoA, and varying amounts of protein (e.g., 50–100 μg of microsomal protein) for a total volume of 0.1 ml in 13 × 100 mm screw-capped test tubes. The ³H-labeled long-chain base (which has been dissolved in ethanol) is added first, the organic solvent is removed under a stream of N₂, and the remainder of the assay components are added as soon as possible and followed by thorough mixing and/or sonication. If higher concentrations of [³H]sphinganine are desired, the sphinganine can be solubilized with celite^{34} or by sonication with phosphatidylcholine.

The reaction is initiated by adding stearoyl-CoA and, after incubation at 37°C for 10 min, is terminated with 1.5 ml of chloroform–methanol (1:2, v/v), and 25 μg of carrier ceramide (bovine brain or another commercial source) is added. The products are extracted as described for serine palmitoyltransferase, and the final lipid extract is applied to silica gel TLC plates (silica gel H, Brinkmann). The plates are developed in diethyl ether–methanol (99:1, v/v), and the region corresponding to [³H]ceramide can be established by radiometric scanning of the chromatoplate, by fluorography, or by visualization of the carrier lipid with iodine vapor. In this system, the long-chain bases remain at the origin and ceramides migrate with *R*~f~ values of 0.25 to 0.35 relative to the solvent front. The ceramide-containing region of the chromatoplate is scraped into scintillation vials, 4 ml of either a toluene-based or a detergent-based aqueous counting cocktail is added, and the amount of radiolabel is determined with the appropriate corrections for quenching.

Because some decomposition of the radiolabeled long-chain bases occurs during handling (mainly during drying of the sample in the test tube, see discussion below), a zero-time control should be included. To assess any contribution from endogenous fatty acyl-CoA's or by a CoA-independent pathway, other assay tubes should omit stearoyl-CoA.

Substrate Specificity. Sphinganine and sphingosine, as well as all four long-chain base stereoisomers, can be N-acylated by ceramide synthase(s).<sup>11,30,34,35,42</sup> Various fatty acyl-CoA's are also utilized, but not equally in different tissues, which has led to the hypothesis that there may be more than one enzyme involved.<sup>11</sup> When analyzing this enzyme in a new system, it would appear prudent to test different fatty acyl-CoA's.

Inhibitors. Recent studies with rat liver microsomes and hepatocytes have found that the acylation of sphingosine is potently inhibited *in vitro* and in intact hepatocytes by fumonisins B₁ and B₂, mycotoxins produced by *Fusarium moniliforme*.<sup>43</sup>

Regulation. Ceramide synthesis apparently occurs very fast *in vivo* since very low amounts of free long-chain bases occur as intermediates in sphingolipid biosynthesis.<sup>8</sup> This may be advantageous since sphingosine and other long-chain bases are very bioactive compounds that inhibit protein kinase C, activate the epithelial growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase, and affect diverse other systems in cells.<sup>44,45</sup> Free long-chain bases can be cytotoxic<sup>42,46</sup> or mitogenic<sup>47</sup> to cells at very low concentrations. Recent work indicates that ceramides, themselves, may be mediators of the action of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃,<sup>48</sup> tumor necrosis factor, and γ-interferon<sup>49</sup> in HL-60 cells. Hence, the formation and turnover of this compound would be expected to be under careful regulation.

### Formation of Other Long-Chain Bases

The step at which the 4-hydroxyl group of phytosphingosine is added is not known, although it is thought to occur after the formation of sphinganine.<sup>49,50</sup> The biosynthetic pathways for other long-chain bases (e.g., with branching or unsaturation along the alkyl side chain)<sup>5</sup> have not been elucidated.

General Methods and Considerations in Analyzing  
Ceramide Biosynthesis  

**Preparation of Radiolabeled Substrates.** There are several relatively straightforward routes for the synthesis of radiolabeled long-chain bases as substrates for these enzymes. One is to begin with ceramide or a more complex sphingolipid (or the N-acetyl derivative of sphingosine or sphinganine), oxidize the 3-hydroxyl group using CrO₃, and reduce the ketone with sodium borotritide.⁵¹ The free long-chain base can be recovered by hydrolysis⁵²,⁵³ and purified by TLC.⁵⁴ The drawbacks to this method are that the radiolabeled product will be racemic at carbon 3 (although the stereoisomers can be resolved)⁵⁴ and a substantial portion of the free long-chain base may be lost during hydrolysis of the N-acyl derivatives (e.g., by replacement of the 3-hydroxyl with methanol), but this can be minimized by various approaches.⁴,⁵²  

The second procedure is to reduce the 4,5-trans double bond of sphingosine with sodium borotritide and palladium chloride or acetate⁵⁵ (this radiolabeled sphinganine can be converted to 3-ketosphinganine as described above).⁵¹ The limitation of this method is that it forms only sphinganines; furthermore, protection of the amino group also requires subsequent hydrolysis and its attendant problems.  

**Comments on Stability of Long-Chain Bases.** Sphingosine and other long-chain sphingoid bases, especially the tritiated forms, are unstable in dilute solution and when allowed to dry on glass surfaces. Hence, they should be examined periodically for purity and repurified as needed. In our experience the major contaminants formed from ³H-labeled long-chain bases are nonpolar and are easily removed by applying the sample (in chloroform) to a small silica gel column (prepared in Pasteur pipettes) and eluting with increasing percentages of methanol in chloroform.  

**Studies of Ceramide Biosynthesis by Cultured Cells.** Ceramide synthesis can also be followed *in vitro* or with intact cells using radiolabeled serine, palmitic acid, or long-chain bases as the substrates of the enzymes. However, particular care must be taken to establish the cellular-specific activity of the precursors (i.e., serine or palmitic acid) since they are made *de novo* and dilute the added radiolabel.⁵⁵ On the other hand, addition of free long-chain bases to cells is also complicated by the potent effects of these compounds on cells.⁴⁴–⁴⁶,⁵⁶

Analysis of Long-Chain Bases by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. The free long-chain bases of tissue extracts or cells in culture can be analyzed relatively easily and with high sensitivity by reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<sup>57,58</sup> First, the lipids are extracted using standard procedures, then interfering glycerolipids are removed by base treatment, and the free long-chain bases are derivatized with *o*-phthalaldehyde (OPA).

To extract the long-chain bases, the sample is homogenized with ice-cold buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), and an aliquot (1–20 mg of tissue, or 1–10 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) in 0.1–0.3 ml is transferred to 13 × 100 mm screw-cap (standard borosilicate tubes with Teflon caps) test tubes. After adding 1.5 ml of chloroform–methanol (1:2, v/v), an internal standard is added (such as 50–400 pmol of eicosasphinganine), and 1 ml each of chloroform and water are added. The two phases are separated by centrifugation; the upper phase is discarded, and the chloroform phase washed twice with water, drained through a small column containing anhydrous sodium sulfate (granular), and dried under reduced pressure.

To remove the glycerolipids, the extracts are resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M KOH in methanol–chloroform (2:1, v/v) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. After the samples have cooled to room temperature, 1 ml each of chloroform and water are added, and the free long-chain bases are recovered in the chloroform phase, which is washed several times with water, dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure.

The *o*-phthalaldehyde derivatives are prepared by dissolving the sample in 50 μl of methanol and adding 50 μl of the OPA reagent, which is prepared by mixing 99 ml of 3% (w/v) boric acid in water (pH adjusted to 10.5 with KOH) and 1 ml of ethanol containing 50 mg of OPA and 50 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol. After incubation for at least 5 min at room temperature, 250–500 μl of methanol–5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) (90:10, v/v) is added, and the samples are centrifuged briefly in a microcentrifuge to clarify. Aliquots are injected onto a Waters (Milford, MA) Radial Pak C<sub>18</sub> column (5 μm, Type 8NVC185 with a C<sub>18</sub> guard column) and eluted with methanol–5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The OPA derivative is detected with a fluorometric detector with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm (or with a 418-nm cutoff filter).

of compound (i.e., phytosphingosines elute first, followed by sphingosines, then sphinganines) and the alkyl chain length. The recovery of the long-chain bases is highly reproducible and can be improved by using C₂₀-sphinganine as an internal standard.

Several other methods are available for the quantitation of long-chain bases by the formation of colorimetric or fluorescent derivatives (as cited in Ref. 57). These procedures are generally less sensitive and can yield incorrect values when the samples contain other lipids with reactive amino groups (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylserine).

[52] Use of N-([1-¹⁴C]Hexanoyl)-D-erythro-sphingolipids to Assay Sphingolipid Metabolism

By ANTHONY H. FUTERMAN and RICHARD E. PAGANO

### Introduction

Previous studies from our laboratory have utilized a series of fluorescent phospholipid and sphingolipid analogs to study the metabolism and intracellular translocation of lipids in cultured cells.¹ In this approach, one of the naturally occurring fatty acids of a lipid is replaced by a short-chain fluorescent fatty acid, N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)aminohexanoic acid (C₆-NBD-fatty acid). The resulting fluorescent lipids exhibit high rates of spontaneous transfer between membranes *in vitro*, and this property permits integration of the molecules into cellular membranes from exogenous sources. The distribution of the fluorescent lipid analogs within living cells can be studied by high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and correlated with biochemical investigations of their metabolism. In the case of the C₆-NBD-sphingolipids, various studies have documented the physical properties, metabolism, and intracellular transport of these analogs.²⁻¹⁴
