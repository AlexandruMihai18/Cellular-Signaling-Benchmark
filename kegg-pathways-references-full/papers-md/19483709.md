# Targeting innate immunity protein kinase signalling in inflammation

**Matthias Gaestel**, **Alexey Kotlyarov** and **Michael Kracht**

Abstract | Inflammation is an evolutionarily conserved host reaction that is initiated in response to trauma, tissue damage and infection. It leads to changes in tissue homeostasis and blood flow, immune-cell activation and migration, and secretion of cytokines and mediators in a spatio-temporally coordinated manner. Progress in understanding of the mechanisms of the inflammatory response has identified various protein kinases that act as essential signalling components and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets. This article summarizes advances in the identification and validation of such targets, and discusses key issues for the development of small-molecule kinase inhibitors as a new generation of oral anti-inflammatory drugs, including feedback loops, inhibitor specificity and combination therapy.

Acute inflammation is typically downregulated after removal of pathogens and cellular debris. However, in several disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus erythematoses, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma, a chronic inflammatory state is maintained, leading to local and systemic deleterious effects on host cells and tissues. Abnormalities associated with inflammation are also observed in atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, ischaemic heart and brain diseases, and cancer.

Chronic inflammation is commonly treated by a number of approaches. Traditional treatments include fast-acting symptomatic drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, slow-acting disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as low-dose methotrexate, and cytostatic drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and high-dose methotrexate. More recently, immunosuppressants, such as calcineurin inhibitors, and biologics that specifically target inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) have been introduced on the basis of increased understanding of the molecular pathology of several chronic inflammatory disorders¹ (BOX 1). However, although such biologics have provided major treatment advances, they are expensive to produce and must be administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Furthermore, between one- and two-thirds of patients respond poorly, initial beneficial effects can deteriorate, and in many cases disease recurs once treatment ceases. There is therefore an urgent need for additional, orally available drugs against chronic inflammation.

Because various cell types and signalling mechanisms are involved in the inflammatory response (BOX 2), there are several major and minor control points and numerous potential drug targets². Among these are protein kinases; these key signalling components are members of a well-characterized human enzyme family and can be targeted by small-molecule inhibitors³. A better understanding of the (sometimes ambivalent or unexpected) roles of essential protein kinases in acute and chronic inflammation has been provided by their constitutive deletion (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2)⁴), conditional deletion (p38α⁵⁻⁸, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1; also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7))⁹,¹⁰ and inhibitor of κB kinase-β (IKKβ)¹¹) or combined deletion (MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 and 3 (MK2–MK3)¹² and ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 5 and 4 (also known as nuclear mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) and MSK2)¹³) and their replacement with inactive forms (IRAK4 (REF. 14) and IKKα¹⁵) in mice.

In parallel, the development of a range of small-molecule inhibitors of these protein kinases, which are now being profiled in kinome-wide screens¹⁶⁻¹⁸ and tested in experimental animal models of inflammation before entering the clinic, has exploded during recent years¹⁹⁻²⁶. Provided that the right protein kinase is chosen as the target and that the specificity, efficacy and bioavailability of the small-molecule inhibitor are sufficiently high, it now seems realistic that a protein kinase inhibitor will pave the way for a new generation of oral drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammation. The purpose of this

Box 1 | Anti-cytokine therapy of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases

The beneficial effects of anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1) drugs (such as the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (Kineret; Amgen/Biovitrum) or the IL-1 trap rilonacept (Arcalyst; Regeneron)) or anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs (such as infliximab (Remicade; Johnson & Johnson), adalimumab (Humira; Abbott), etanercept (Enbrel; Amgen/Wyeth) and certolizumab pegol (Cimzia; UCB Pharmaceuticals)) demonstrate the causal role of these inflammatory cytokines in disease. However, continuous treatment is required. In addition, some patients may be unresponsive, treatment may become ineffective, or cytokines other than IL-1 or TNF may become dominant as diseases progress<sup>137</sup>. In a small number of patients, anti-TNF therapy can even provoke lupus erythematosus-like or other autoimmune-disease-like symptoms<sup>138</sup>. As an alternative, orally available protein kinase inhibitors that block IL-1 and TNF activity downstream of their receptors are in clinical testing. Autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases for which specific anti-cytokine treatment has proved effective are described below.

**Autoinflammatory diseases**

Anti-IL-1 drugs are effective against autoinflammatory diseases, whereas anti-TNF drugs are not. The dominant cytokine involved in this group is IL-1β, and the secondary one is IL-6. The dominant cell type involved is the macrophage, followed by T cells and then B cells. Examples of diseases for which anti-IL-1 drugs have been shown to be effective are listed below. The main symptoms of rare febrile syndromes associated with the disease are included in brackets.

- Familial Mediterranean fever (fever, abdominal pain, polyserositis, amyloidosis and erysipeloid)<sup>137</sup>
- Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (cold-induced urticaria, fever and arthralgia)<sup>137</sup>
- Muckle–Wells syndrome (deafness, urticaria, fever, chills and arthritis)<sup>137</sup>
- Neonatal-onset multi-inflammatory disease (fever, mental retardation and arthropathy)<sup>137</sup>
- Hyper-immunoglobulin D syndrome (fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia and increased serum immunoglobulin D levels)<sup>139</sup>
- Juvenile Still’s disease, also known as systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and adult Still’s disease (high fever, fatigue, skin rash, muscle pain, severe joint pain and joint damage)<sup>140</sup>
- Urate crystal arthritis, also known as gout<sup>137</sup>
- Type 2 diabetes<sup>137</sup>

**Autoimmune diseases**

Anti-TNF drugs are most effective against this group of diseases, although anti-IL-1 drugs and some other biologicals, such as anti-CD20 (for example, rituximab (Rituxan/MabThera; Biogen Idec/Genentech/Roche)), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4–immunoglobulin (abatacept (Orencia; Bristol–MyersSquibb)) and anti-IL-23 (Ustekinumab (Stelara; Centocor Ortho/Janssen–Cilag)), can also be beneficial. The dominant cytokine involved in such diseases is TNF; secondary cytokines include IL-1β, type I interferons<sup>140</sup>, IL-17, IL-23 and interferon-γ<sup>137</sup>. The dominant cell type involved is the T cell, followed by the macrophage; the secondary cell type is the B cell. Examples of diseases for which these drugs have been shown to be effective include: rheumatoid arthritis<sup>141</sup>; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis<sup>142</sup>; ankylosing spondylitis<sup>143</sup>; Crohn’s disease<sup>144</sup>; psoriasis<sup>145</sup>; necrotizing vasculitis<sup>146</sup>.

Review is to support kinase target identification and inhibitor validation by analysing both the recent progress made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of kinase signalling in inflammation and the latest efforts in kinase inhibitor development and profiling.

Major signalling pathways in inflammation

Canonical pathways of innate immunity. There are several fully established (canonical) innate immune signalling pathways, which are highly complex in terms of their components and layers of post-translational modifications but rely on only a few major principles of signal transduction,

Box 2 | Cell types involved in inflammation

Injurious stimuli (danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)) activate cells of the innate immune system and those of surrounding tissues. Innate immune cells are the main source of proinflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)), which ‘sound the alarm’ locally as well as systemically to recruit leukocytes (listed in the blue box in the figure) to the sites of damage (tissue cells listed in the beige boxes). Leukocyte migration involves the release of preformed vasoactive factors (histamines and prostaglandins, in particular PGE₂) and the secretion of chemokines. Antigens (Ag) generated during inflammatory reactions can aggravate, perpetuate or reinstate inflammation by activating T cells and B cells as part of the adaptive immune response. Antibodies (Ab) alone or in conjunction with activated complement (C*) can also activate the release of further inflammatory mediators. Normally, the inflammatory reaction is rapid, owing to activation of numerous positive feedback loops, and transient, owing to subsequent activation of negative regulatory mechanisms between and within all cells involved. Deregulation at any step results in chronic activation and chronic inflammation. All cells shown in the figure use conserved protein kinase signalling systems to control inflammatory reactions by altering gene expression patterns. These kinases represent attractive targets by which to modulate inflammatory reactions in several cell types simultaneously and independently of specific cell surface receptors. IFNγ, interferon-γ.

and the TEC kinase family member Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) feed directly into MAPK kinase (MKK, or MAP2K)-independent and MKK-dependent activation of p38α, respectively, which are central components of the canonical pathways described above⁴³,⁴⁴. BTK also interferes with the canonical pathways through its contribution to NF-κB activation by phosphorylation and transactivation of p65 (REF. 43). Finally, it has been observed that inhibition of C-KIT (also known as mast-stem cell growth factor receptor (SCFR)) using imatinib (Glivec/Gleevec; Novartis) can inhibit inflammation by reducing histamine production through increased apoptosis of mast cells⁴⁵ and that imatinib abrogates several signalling pathways in macrophages and fibroblasts⁴⁶.

The lipid kinases phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-γ and PI3Kδ are phosphotransferases structurally related to protein kinases. Both can be targeted by small-molecule inhibitors with similar efficiency and show remarkable involvement in the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the sites of inflammation — an essential process for oxidative burst — as well as in the mast cell degranulation that is necessary for histamine release (reviewed in REF. 47). Although these protein kinase-related enzymes are emerging targets for the treatment of inflammation, they are not covered further in this Review.

Complex regulation of IL-1 and TNF biosynthesis.
Protein kinases not only participate in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and cytokine signalling, but are also the key players in regulating cytokine biosynthesis. This is illustrated here for two of the master cytokines in inflammation, IL-1 and TNF. Effective production of IL-1 (FIG. 3a) requires three signals. The first is activation of the IKKβ-, p38α- or casein kinase 2 (CK2)-dependent signalling pathways by TLRs, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-like helicases or other stimuli to induce rapid IL-1 mRNA synthesis⁴⁸⁻⁵⁰. The second is inflammasome activation to induce pro-IL-1 cleavage⁵¹, and the third is activation of nucleotide P2X₇ receptors by ATP⁵² released from damaged cells, to trigger exocytosis of mature IL-1 by an unconventional protein secretion pathway⁵³. This triple control ensures that IL-1 is released only when a pathogenic challenge is associated with local damage. Release of IL-1 is rapid and several steps in this pathway are controlled by reversible protein phosphorylation events. There is emerging evidence that many environmental or stressful stimuli that induce inflammation — including ultraviolet radiation⁵⁴, urea⁵⁵ or silica crystals⁵⁶ — use parts of the kinase network that trigger IL-1 release. Recent evidence also shows that the same IKKβ-dependent pathway that induces IL-1β mRNA also controls negative regulators of IL-1 processing. Inhibition of IKKβ can therefore result in increased IL-1β secretion and unwanted severe systemic inflammation⁵⁷. This has been observed in models of myeloid-specific IKKβ deletion and LPS challenge⁵⁰, and intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury⁵⁰. IKKβ also has a role in TNF-mediated apoptosis⁵⁸, mast cell-mediated degranulation and cytokine synthesis⁵⁹.

Figure 1 | Protein kinases and protein kinase-containing signalling complexes involved in the canonical inflammatory response. Signal transduction is mediated by pro-inflammatory receptors. Inflammation is initiated by the recognition of danger or damage signals (danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)) at the cell surface and is then perpetuated by endogenous cytokines (tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1)), which bind to their cognate receptors. Spontaneous release of TNF or IL-1 can also activate inflammation. TNF receptors (TNFRs), IL-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) lack enzymatic activity. Ligand-induced receptor dimerization or trimerization triggers the recruitment of receptor-specific adaptor proteins (TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88), MYD88 adaptor-like protein (MAL)–Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon (IFN)-β (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), reviewed in REF. 153) that recruit receptor-proximal protein kinases (shown in blue). Non-degradative ubiquitination provides versatile and transiently assembled docking surfaces for the formation of cytosolic multiprotein complexes. An emerging picture is that these complexes have not a static but a modular, flexible composition (as indicated by the yellow shading). In most cases they contain at least one adaptor (shown in red), one ubiquitin ligase (shown in orange) and one upstream protein kinase (shown in blue) with the capability to activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Collectively, activation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene expression by the signalling modules shown here results in expression and release of secondary inflammatory mediators that regulate all symptoms of inflammation, such as acute phase protein synthesis (for example, by IL-6), chemotaxis (for example, by the chemokines IL-8 and CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)), vasodilation (for example, by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)), pain (for example, by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)), and tissue breakdown (for example, by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)).

Figure 2 | Protein kinases and protein kinase-containing signalling complexes involved in the non-canonical inflammatory response. Non-canonical signalling in inflammation by apparently secondary and cell type-specific functions of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases is mainly involved in adaptive immune responses, which also feed into the innate inflammatory kinase network. Glycoprotein 130 (gp130)-containing receptor- and type I interferon (IFN) receptor (IFNR)-associated Janus kinases (JAK1–3) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) can modulate inflammatory cytokine production both positively³⁹ and negatively³⁸, probably through different signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling modules. TEC kinase family members, such as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and bone marrow tyrosine kinase in chromosome X (BMX), interfere with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation⁴³ and interleukin 6 (IL-6) production, respectively. ZAP70 can activate p38α⁹⁶. The normally T cell receptor (TCR)-regulated non-receptor tyrosine kinases lymphocyte cell-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and tyrosine protein kinase spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) further stimulate inflammatory cytokine production²²,⁴², whereas receptor tyrosine kinases, such as RON⁴⁰ and the three members of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MER) receptor (TAMR) family⁴¹, are pleiotropic inhibitors of the innate immune response. Finally, the receptor tyrosine kinase C-KIT (also known as mast-stem cell growth factor receptor (SCFR)) is essential for mast cell survival and histamine production⁴⁵. Activation of inflammatory protein kinases is usually transient because it is shut off at all levels of signalling by various negative signalling molecules (reviewed in REFS 154, 155), including several protein kinases that are apparently involved in negative feedback loops (see also FIGS 3, 5). COX2, cyclooxygenase 2; IKK, inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase; MK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; NO, nitric oxide; TIR domain, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.

The efficient biosynthesis of the other master cytokine, TNF, is also tightly controlled by the joint action of various protein kinases (FIG. 3b). Transcriptional activation of the TNF gene requires NF-κB⁶⁰, JNK-controlled activator protein 1 (AP1)⁶¹ activity and other factors. In addition, there is complex post-transcriptional regulation of TNF biosynthesis by protein kinases at the levels of mRNA nuclear export, stability and translation, and, after synthesis, at the level of shedding of TNF protein from the cell membrane. Nuclear export of the TNF transcript is regulated by the TPL2 (tumour progression locus 2; also known as MAP3K8)–MEK–ERK1/2 pathway⁶². The prominent adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′ non-translated region of the TNF mRNA are essential for regulation of mRNA stability and translation, and their deletion leads to severe chronic inflammation in mice owing to loss of TNF mRNA destabilization and translational silencing⁶³. The deletion of AREs in TNF mRNA causes non-responsiveness to regulation by the p38α–MK2/3 signalling pathway⁶³,⁶⁴, suggesting that this pathway targets ARE-binding proteins and regulates their action. Indeed, several ARE-binding proteins, such as tristetraproline (TTP), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (HNRNP) A0, HNRNP A1 and K-homology-type splicing regulatory protein, have been identified as direct substrates of p38α, MK2 and MAPK-interacting

serine–threonine protein kinase 1 (reviewed in REF. 65). There is considerable recent evidence that shedding of TNF from the membrane is regulated by ERK1 and ERK2 (REF. 66).

**Target validation by kinase knockouts in mice**

Gene targeting in mice is an important approach to elucidate the physiological role of a specific protein kinase: to validate it as a target for drug development, to understand the mechanism of drug action, and to predict possible side effects. However, interpretation of gene knockouts may be impeded by embryonic-lethal phenotypes or by compensatory effects of related kinases. Furthermore, whether the knockout phenotype is caused by ablation of the specific catalytic activity of a protein kinase or by loss or alteration of a scaffolding function should be considered. Increased availability of conditional knockouts^{8,9,11} and knock-ins of catalytically inactive kinases^{14,15} are helping to overcome these disadvantages.

Not surprisingly, genetic deletion of most protein kinases in the pathways described above results in modulation of innate immunity in mice. Many of the core kinases have been explored in mouse models of inflammatory disease (see Supplementary information S2 (box)) by genetic ablation. Conventional and conditional mouse knockouts are shown in TABLE 1 and TABLE 2, respectively, and the results reflect the complex regulation of the signalling networks involved. Deletion of IRAK2, IRAK4, TPL2 and MK2–MK3 clearly reduces LPS-induced cytokine production and confers resistance against endotoxic or septic shock, whereas deletion of other protein kinases, such as MKK3, MKK6 or JNK2, has milder effects. Remarkably, ablation of IKKα or both MSK1 and MSK2 decreases cytokine production and increases susceptibility to septic shock. As expected, reduced cytokine production leads to disadvantages in infection models for mice deficient in IRAK1, IRAK4 and MK2, and clear aggravation in models of rheumatoid arthritis has been shown for mice deficient in MKK3, MKK6 and MK2. The conventional knockouts for TAK1, p38α, IKKβ and MEKK3 are embryonic-lethal, and cells from MKK3–MKK6 double-knockout animals exhibit defects in growth arrest and increased tumorigenic potential. Conditional deletion of TAK1 and p38α leads to lethality and lung pathology, respectively. Cell type-specific deletion of TAK1, p38α and IKKβ has adverse and beneficial effects. These results can be summarized in two ways: first, there is not an ideal target consisting of a central kinase, but rather many kinases that seem to be of equal importance; and second, an increasing number of kinases are being found to also participate in feedback regulation and termination of inflammatory responses, meaning that their inhibition results in aggravation of inflammation.

As described above, genetic ablation of protein kinases that are involved in the regulation of cytokine production, such as TAK1, often has dramatic consequences. Severe intestinal inflammation in enterocyte-restricted TAK1 knockout is caused by massive apoptotic death of these cells, which is partially TNF-dependent. This phenomenon can, of course, be explained by the proposed

deregulation of ‘controlled inflammation’, which may enhance the sensitivity of TAK1-deficient cells to TNF-elicited apoptosis^{10}. However, recent conditional-knockout studies showed that TAK1 also mediates general survival signals, predominantly for haematopoietic stem cells and liver cells^{9}. Interruption of basal signalling during development could result in early elimination of distinct cell types, also leading to tissue damage and uncontrolled inflammation directly after birth or later in the adult animal. Separate functions of a protein kinase in development and acute inflammation could therefore restrict the information obtained from knockout models. In this context, more attention should be applied to the manipulation of the dynamic range of protein kinase signalling, which is important for the control of cellular outcomes^{67}.

**Small-molecule inhibitors**

Most small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors bind to the ATP pocket within the small lobe of the protein kinase. However, the mode of action of such compounds varies from orthosteric, ATP-competitive inhibition to allosteric inhibitory mechanisms and is often a mixture of both (see FIG. 4 for recent examples relevant to inflammation). Furthermore, small-molecule inhibitors can bind to the protein kinase and lock it in a unique inactive conformation, can target the various amino acid residues within the ATP binding site and can extend their targeting to neighbouring, less conserved pockets or single exposed residues^{68}. The growing number of three-dimensional structures available for protein kinase catalytic domain-inhibitor complexes (for example, 46 different three-dimensional structures for p38α–inhibitor complexes are available on the Protein Data Bank) and kinome-wide screens will finally make it possible to carefully and iteratively design potent and specific protein kinase inhibitors by structure-based lead optimization and kinome-wide testing (BOX 3).

Increased potency will be achieved mainly by iterative design, extending the interaction surface between the protein kinase and inhibitor molecule, a process that could also increase selectivity. However, selectivity of protein kinase inhibitors has to be determined empirically and may differ *in vitro* and *in vivo*. *In vitro* selectivity can be determined by testing concentration-dependent inhibition against a panel of purified native or recombinant catalytic kinase domains that form a representative subset of the human kinome (such panels contain ~70–80 protein kinases)^{17} or by competitive binding assays to human kinase expression libraries containing more than 50% of the human kinome^{16}. So far, 65 existing small-molecule inhibitors have been tested in the inhibition panel^{17} and 38 in the binding panel^{16}.

Another approach, which enables the determination of protein kinase-binding profiles of small-molecule inhibitors under more physiological conditions, is based on the binding of native protein kinases to immobilized, broad-selectivity inhibitors added to cell lysates in the presence of specific competitive inhibitors. Subsequent pull-down assays on bound protein kinases and their identification by mass spectroscopy was shown to allow profiling of specificity against ~200 protein kinases and ~600 other

Figure 3 | Regulation of IL-1β and TNF biosynthesis by protein kinase signalling pathways. a | Sensors of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (namely the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-like helicases (RLHs)), extracellular stress (such as urea, asbestos, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation), as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β and interferon (IFN)-γ), stimulate biosynthesis of IL-1β, the major secreted form of IL-1. These stimuli activate the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), casein kinase 2 (CK2) and Ca²⁺ signalling pathways, alone or in combination, that cooperatively induce IL-1β mRNA synthesis and protein processing. A unique IL-1 promoter chromatin structure prepares monocytes or macrophages (the major source of IL-1) for rapid IL-1 production post-stimulation, and IL-1β mRNA is produced within 1 hour⁴⁸. Transcriptional regulation involves inducible as well as constitutive binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), phosphorylated transcription factor PU.1, phosphorylated IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), phosphorylated p65 subunit of NF-κB, c-Jun homodimers, C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β) and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) to the proximal IL-1β promoter and to a distal regulatory region⁴⁸. The proximal promoter seems to be in a poised, nucleosome-free conformation, allowing rapid access of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in response to activated signalling pathways⁴⁸. Neighbouring H3 histones are phosphorylated at S10 and hypo-methylated, whereas histone acetylation is constitutive¹⁵⁶. CK2 phosphorylates DNA-bound PU.1 at S148 in response to the PAMP stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which facilitates recruitment of Pol II¹⁵⁷. The flavenoid apigenin inhibits IL-1β synthesis¹⁵⁸, CK2 activity⁴⁸ and the phosphorylation of nuclear p65 at S276 (REF. 48) and S536 (REF. 158). The arrangement of the transcription factors is schematic and does not reflect their natural position. After synthesis, IL-1β mRNA is stabilized by the TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (also known as MAPK kinase 7 (MAP3K7))–MKK3/6 (MAPK kinase 3/6)–p38α–MK2/3 (MAPK-activated protein kinase 2/3) pathway through adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AREs)¹⁵⁹ and mRNA-binding proteins, a process that can be inhibited by p38α MAPK inhibitors (such as SB203580)¹⁵⁹. The 31 kDa IL-1β precursor (pro-IL-1β) is cleaved by caspase 1 or other proteases (proteinase 3 (PR3), cathepsin G (CATG) and neutrophil elastase (NE)) to generate the mature secreted 17 kDa IL-1β form. Inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase-β (IKKβ) controls not only the synthesis of pro-IL-1β in macrophages but also the expression of various cell type-specific proteinase inhibitors (serpins, plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2), caspase 1 inhibitor iceberg (also known as caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 18 (CARD18) and BCL-Xₗ) that inhibit pro-IL-1β processing in macrophages or neutrophils⁵⁰. Therefore, deletion of IKKβ or inhibition with an ATP-competitive inhibitor (ML120B) enhances IL-1β secretion and septic shock syndromes⁵⁰. IL-1β secretion requires activation of the inflammasome¹⁶⁰, a macromolecular complex that generates activated caspase 1 in response to the same stimuli that induce IL-1β mRNA⁴⁹,⁵³. IL-1 secretion also requires ATP-activated P2X₇ receptors and subsequent K⁺ efflux and Ca²⁺ influx for exocytosis¹⁶¹. At present, it is not clear whether these events and inflammasome activation are also directly regulated by protein kinases. b | DAMPs, PAMPs, extracellular stress (UV radiation) and pro-inflammatory cytokines also stimulate tumour necrosis factor (TNF) biosynthesis, which is controlled by protein kinases at both the transcriptional level and at various post-transcriptional levels. Transcriptional activation of the TNF gene is mainly due to transactivation by the p65 subunit of NF-κB⁶⁰ and activating protein (AP)-1 (REF. 61), which are regulated by IKKβ and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), respectively. Post-transcriptional regulation of TNF biosynthesis at the level of mRNA nuclear export is regulated by the IKKβ-induced p105–TPL2 (tumour progression locus 2; also known as MAP3K8)–MEK1/2 (MAPK–ERK kinase 1/2; also known as MAP2K1/2)–ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; also known as MAPK3/1) pathway, which contributes to phosphorylation of ARE-binding proteins, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) A1, through MAPK signal-integrating kinase 1 (MNK1; also known as MKNK1)⁶². TNF mRNA stability and translation of pro-TNF are increased as a result of complex regulation and phosphorylation of the mRNA of ARE-binding proteins by the TAK1–MKK3/6–p38α–MK2/3 signalling module¹⁶², which leads to inactivation of the ARE-binding and mRNA-destabilizing protein tristetraproline (TTP), and also by the ERK–MNK1 (MAPK-interacting serine–threonine protein kinase 1) module. Finally, shedding of TNF from the membrane-inserted trimeric pro-TNF complex seems to be regulated by ERK1/2 through direct phosphorylation of TNF-converting enzyme (TACE)⁶⁶.

purine-binding proteins from any cell type¹⁸. Results indicate that there is some propensity of the inhibitors to bind to multiple targets¹⁶,¹⁸, and only one monospecific inhibitor has been identified so far: rapamycin, which uses a mechanism dependent on the peptidylproline cis–trans-isomerase FK506-binding protein to target the protein kinase mTOR¹⁷. However, although not completely monospecific, some small-molecule inhibitors are highly selective¹⁸ even under stringent in vitro conditions using ATP concentrations below the Michaelis constant (Kₘ) value of the kinase tested¹⁷.

Taking into account that the in vivo selectivity of these molecules can be further modified by cell type-specific differences in their uptake and stability, by their subcellular accumulation in a compartment where the potential target is localized, by differences in the in vivo concentrations of the various targeted kinases and by allosteric interactions of the target kinase with other molecules (see REF. 18 and below), achieving specificity seems to be a realistic goal. Moreover, monospecificity of an inhibitor may not necessarily be required in cases in which different targets influence a complex signalling network in the same direction (see below). However, with the development of tailor-made inhibitors, the identification of suitable targets for a specific disease becomes increasingly important.

Animal models. Although there are ~65 million years of divergent evolution between mice and humans, and despite mouse models of inflammation not completely or causally representing human diseases (see Supplementary information S2 (box)), the use of small-molecule inhibitors in mouse models provides at least an *in vivo* proof of concept for the anti-inflammatory action of the small-molecule compounds. As shown in TABLE 3, many orally available small-molecule inhibitors have been analysed in mouse or rat models of acute and chronic inflammation, in which they attenuated symptoms. In many if not all cases, the inhibitors used are not monospecific and so the concept of them eliciting a positive effect through a specific protein kinase is speculative. Only in cases in which structurally unrelated small-molecule inhibitors for the same protein kinase target were investigated in parallel in the same experimental system can the role of a specific protein kinase be further substantiated. So far, this has been performed in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) models for p38α<sup>23,69–71</sup> and IKKβ<sup>72,73</sup>. The clear reduction of CIA by administration of p38α and IKKβ inhibitors contrasts with the ambivalent effects seen in the conditional-knockout mice, indicating that cross-inhibition of structurally related protein kinases is probable.

Clinical trials. Several protein kinase inhibitors that have proved safe and effective in animal models have now entered clinical trials (TABLE 4). The title of a previous review on p38α inhibitors, “Many are made, but

few are chosen<sup>74</sup>, so far seems to be accurate. Although different approaches were undertaken to further investigate structure–activity variations of existing p38α inhibitors<sup>69</sup> and to find novel chemotypes for such inhibitors<sup>75,76</sup>, adverse and non-tolerable side effects have been observed in clinical Phase I and Phase II studies for existing p38α inhibitors. Increased liver enzymes in serum, such as those reported for VX-745 and BIRB 796 (REFS 77,78), indicated liver toxicity. In addition, skin rash and undisclosed central nervous system toxicity were observed<sup>74</sup> and led to discontinuation of clinical studies for VX-745. A second-generation p38α inhibitor, VX-702, proved ineffective in a Phase II study for rheumatoid arthritis, showing only short-term effects and a modest ACR 20 response compared with substantial placebo effects<sup>79</sup>. Because liver toxicity has been observed for various potent but structurally unrelated p38α inhibitors, this side effect could arise from an on-target effect<sup>80</sup>. This idea is supported by the recent demonstration that hepatocyte-specific ablation of p38α leads to excessive activation of JNKs in the liver after *in vivo* challenge with LPS and that, in the absence of IKKβ, ablation of p38α in mice causes LPS-induced liver failure<sup>5</sup>. Furthermore, pathway toxicology reveals many mechanistic links between p38α and both liver toxicity and skin disorders, making it questionable whether a therapeutic window for these inhibitors exists<sup>80</sup>. However, the search for novel chemotypes of p38α inhibitors is being continued by different pharmaceutical companies<sup>69,75,76</sup> and the liver toxicity should not preclude the development and testing of topical p38α inhibitors that might be beneficial in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis.

So far, results for inhibitors of JAKs and SYK have been encouraging. Phase II clinical studies have recently been reported for pan-JAK and SYK inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis<sup>81–83</sup> and psoriasis<sup>84</sup>. A significant improvement in symptoms was reported for both inhibitors (TABLE 4). However, further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of action of these inhibitors at the systemic level — including effects on B lymphocytes and cells bearing Fcγ-activating receptors, as well as T helper and effector cells — to establish whether the observed effects are due to inhibition of innate or adaptive immunity.

**Long-term treatment and the risk of cancer.** Because therapy of chronic inflammation requires long-term administration of an inhibitor, adverse long-term effects, such as increased tumorigenicity, should also be taken into account. Several inflammatory target kinases have roles in tumour suppression: for example, targeted inactivation of JNK1 (also known as MAPK8) leads to decreased initiation and promotion of gastric carcinogenesis<sup>85</sup>, Jnk1-knockout mice spontaneously develop intestinal tumours and JNK1 expression is downregulated in human colon carcinomas<sup>86</sup>. Because p38α is involved in cell cycle checkpoint control<sup>87</sup> and p53-dependent apoptosis<sup>88</sup>, a role for p38α as a tumour suppressor has also been proposed<sup>89</sup>. The recent finding that targeted inactivation of p38α in adult mice leads to an immature and hyperproliferative lung epithelium that is highly sensitized to tumorigenesis induced by the Kras mutation G12V underlines this role<sup>8</sup>. Furthermore, as judged by conditional deletion in mice, p38α negatively regulates cell proliferation by antagonizing the JNK–c-Jun pathway in several cell types and its deletion therefore results in the development of liver cancer<sup>90</sup>. In agreement with this observation, inhibition of p38α by SB202190 and SB203580 increased JNK activity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells<sup>91</sup> and many human cell types<sup>92</sup>. Therefore, because long-term therapy is required to treat chronic inflammation, global inhibition of JNK1 and p38α by orally applied kinase inhibitors will probably be excluded as a suitable strategy. However,

more sophisticated inhibition by compartment-specific inhibitors might still be possible in the future. Moreover, the development of cancer is a slow process. So, the available p38α and JNK inhibitors (even in combination) might still prove useful for short-term suppression of life-threatening inflammation. They might also have tolerable adverse effects in the long term if administered at low doses. Both of these possibilities resemble today’s approaches to tackling the serious side effects of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid treatment.

Future approaches and strategies

Where to go from p38α: upstream or downstream? The adverse effects of p38α inhibitors can be mechanistically explained, at least in part (FIG. 5). First, a feedback loop from p38α to TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein 1) through direct phosphorylation of inhibitory serine 423 and threonine 431 in TAB1 (REF. 93) explains the increased activation of the TAB–TAK1 complex and JNKs in the absence of p38α catalytic activity⁵. In addition, in the absence of p38α, MKK6 mRNA and protein levels are increased⁹⁴. Second,

Box 3 | The human kinome

Within the human genome, 518 putative protein kinase genes have been identified. Overall, these code for 478 typical protein kinases that have at least one (and 13 that have two) catalytic kinase domain with 11 conserved subdomains, and for an additional 40 atypical kinases with identity or similarity to proteins reported to have biochemical kinase activity but lacking sequence similarity to the typical protein kinases<sup>147</sup>. Together with 106 protein kinase pseudogenes, this forms the protein kinase complement of the human genome, designated the kinome. The human kinome can be divided into 9 broad groups, ~134 families and 196 subfamilies. The evolutionary relatedness of the 491 typical catalytic domains is often represented in a phylogenetic dendrogram (see part **a** of the figure). A projection of protein kinase inhibitor binding to selected catalytic domains in the dendrogram, symbolized by red circles of increasing diameter for increasing affinity, is an elegant way to symbolize the specificity of inhibitors (see part **b** for the nonspecific inhibitor staurosporine and part **c** for the p38 inhibitor BIRB-796)<sup>16</sup>. Recently, a kinome-wide expression-ready human cDNA library, representing 480 catalytic domains and providing catalytically inactive controls, has become available<sup>148</sup>. The mouse kinome has orthologues for 510 human protein kinases<sup>149</sup>, qualifying the mouse as a genetic model organism for analysis of human protein kinase function.

the existence of both pro- and anti-inflammatory targets downstream of p38α probably contributes to the pleiotropic effects observed: although MK2 and MK3 have pro-inflammatory actions owing to post-transcriptional stimulation of cytokine mRNA stability and translation<sup>12</sup>, recent findings show that p38α also phosphorylates and activates MSK1 and MSK2, which limit the LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages by transcriptional activation of anti-inflammatory genes such as those encoding IL-10 and protein phosphatase dual specificity 1 (DUSP1)<sup>13</sup>. Therefore, from these mechanistic observations, it seems that p38α is not a suitable target for anti-inflammatory therapy.

Are other components in this pathway suitable targets? Inhibition of upstream activators such as MKK3 and MKK6 would also paralyse the p38α–TAB1 feedback loop and so should also lead to increased JNK activation (FIG. 5). Furthermore, different mechanisms of MKK-independent activation of p38α have been described, such as a TAB1-dependent auto-activation of p38α<sup>95</sup> and a T cell-specific activation of p38α by ZAP70, leading to eventual activation of p38α even in the absence of MKK3 and MKK6 (REF. 96). Nevertheless, MKK3 and MKK6 deficiency have been shown to suppress passive arthritis in the K/BxN mouse model<sup>97,98</sup> but leave LPS-induced production of cytokines such as IL-6 almost unchanged. Therefore, the inhibition of MKK3 or MKK6 could be an elegant way to suppress arthritis while leaving host defence mechanisms intact. However, further work is needed to fully understand the recently described complementary differences in signal-specific activation of MKK3 and MKK6 in synoviocytes — in which IL-1-induced cytokine expression requires MKK3, whereas TNF and LPS responses require MKK6 (REF. 99) — and their functional consequences. In addition, owing to the increased tumorigenicity of MKK3–MKK6 double-deficient cells<sup>100</sup>, small-molecule inhibitors that are specific for only one of these targets should be favoured.

Targeting pro-inflammatory signalling components downstream of p38α, such as MK2 and MK3, will leave the p38α–TAB1 feedback control and the anti-inflammatory effects of downstream targets of p38α, such as MSK1 and MSK2, intact and, theoretically, should be the strategy of choice (FIG. 5). This strategy also works practically, because it has been shown that mice lacking MK2, or both MK2 and MK3, are viable but exhibit a dramatic reduction of LPS-induced TNF production<sup>12</sup>. This reduction is probably not due to the reduced p38α levels observed in these animals, because reintroduction of a catalytically inactive MK2 into MK2-deficient macrophages could rescue the p38α level but not LPS-induced TNF production<sup>101</sup>. Although MK2-deficient mice display reduced pathology in CIA<sup>102</sup>, they show increased susceptibility in a model of massive *Listeria* infection<sup>103</sup>. MK2 has been shown to be involved in cell cycle checkpoint control in cells lacking the tumour suppressor protein p53 (REF. 104). Consequently, depletion of MK2 in p53-deficient cells leads to mitotic catastrophe after treatment with cancerostatic agents, such as cisplatin or doxorubicin, and to pronounced regression of tumours *in vivo*<sup>105</sup>. Interestingly, MK2 also seems to

have a role in chemically induced skin carcinogenesis, because numbers of DMBA/TPA (7,12-dimethylbez(a) anthracine/phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate)-induced papillomas were markedly reduced in MK2-deficient mice (L. Iversen and M. G., unpublished observations). So, in contrast to p38α and JNK1, inhibition of MK2 could have both an anti-inflammatory and a tumour-suppressive effect. Many MK2- and MK3-specific inhibitors of various chemical classes have been synthesized and are under investigation in the animal models described<sup>24,106–108</sup>.

An alternative strategy: targeting kinase docking. There is compelling evidence to suggest that protein kinases are targeted to their activators, substrates and inactivators (for example, phosphatases) by specialized protein interaction domains (BOX 4). In the NF-κB and JNK signalling pathways, some of these docking domains have been fused to cell-permeable peptide sequences and applied in animal models of disease, including inflammation. The initial data suggest that specific targeting of protein interaction domains is effective and surprisingly safe *in vivo*. Therefore, this approach might provide a practical alternative to the blockade of the ATP-binding pocket (as discussed above), and may be a more tolerable way of targeting specific cellular functions of multi-functional kinases such as IKKβ or JNK.

One example is the disruption of the IKK–NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) interaction within the NF-κB pathway: mapping of the IKK–NEMO interaction domains facilitated identification of a small stretch of 11 amino acids in IKKβ that is essential for binding to NEMO<sup>109</sup>. This NEMO-binding domain (NBD) was fused to the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the antennapedia homeodomain protein to generate synthetic cell-permeable peptides. The wild-type NBD peptide, but not a mutant version, disrupted the interaction of IKK–NEMO *in vitro*, and also suppressed the formation of IKK–NEMO complexes that were isolated from cells incubated with the peptide. In addition, the NBD peptide inhibited TNF-induced activation of endogenous IKK, nuclear translocation of NF-κB and NF-κB reporter-gene activity. Topical or intraperitoneal application of the NBD peptide inhibited acute inflammation in mice, such as PMA (phorbol 12-myrisate 13-acetate)-induced ear oedema or zymosan-induced peritonitis<sup>109</sup>. In a follow-up study, the same group showed that application of the NBD peptide daily and intraperitoneally over a period of more than 20 days suppressed inflammation, osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in murine CIA<sup>110</sup>, a finding that was confirmed independently using a trans-acting activator of transcription (TAT) peptide–NBD peptide<sup>111</sup>. Importantly, daily application of the peptide for more than 30 days showed no obvious systemic toxicity<sup>110</sup>. In addition, cells isolated from mice transgenic for an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene that had been treated systemically with LPS showed that the NBD peptide specifically inhibited LPS-induced, but not basal, NF-κB activity *in vivo*, potentially explaining its low toxicity<sup>110,112</sup>. Several independent studies have shown that the NBD cell-permeable peptides blocked maturation of dendritic cells, the expression of inducible cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in the brain, carrageenan-induced paw oedema and LPS-induced neutrophil activation (reviewed in REF. 113).

locally, it also suppressed synovial inflammation in a rat adjuvant arthritis model as well as TNF-induced IL-6 production in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue ex vivo<sup>114</sup>.

A second example of protein interaction domain targeting is the disruption of the JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) and c-Jun docking sites in the JNK signaling pathway: JIP1 is a scaffold required for assembly of JNK pathway components, and was initially discovered as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of JNK, presumably because its ectopic (over)expression sequesters the JNK signaling module<sup>115</sup>. JIP1 is also known as islet-brain 1 (IB1), as it is found in pancreatic β-cells and is associated with diabetes<sup>116</sup>. As with JIP1 overexpression or JIP-deletion mutants<sup>117</sup>, a cell-permeable peptide composed of the JNK-interaction domain of JIP1 and of the PTD of the HIV protein TAT inhibited JNK activation *in vitro* and *in vivo* and prevented IL-1β-induced apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells, thereby providing the first demonstration of a novel type of JNK inhibition<sup>118</sup>. Destruction of insulin-secreting β-cells in the pancreas results from IL-1-mediated JNK activation and subsequent apoptosis, and this can be inhibited by the JIP1 peptide or by JIP1 antisense RNA<sup>118</sup>. Applied *in vivo*, the JIP1 peptide improved insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in diabetic mice<sup>119</sup>. These data suggest that JNK inhibition is beneficial for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The JNK pathway also has a role in inner ear hair-cell apoptosis and hearing loss<sup>120</sup> and a number of recent studies have shown beneficial effects of JIP1-derived peptides in aminoglycoside- and trauma-induced hearing loss.

Interestingly, the JIP1 peptide distorts the ATP binding site of JNK, which suggests that binding of scaffolds, activators or substrates to JNK is an additional determinant of the affinity of ATP-competitive inhibitors such as SP600125<sup>121</sup> (FIG. 4f,g). It is thus likely that the specificity and potency of protein kinase inhibitors deduced from cell-based assays might actually be quite different, not only from their *in vitro* properties, but also from their properties in a diseased cell where a specific interaction partner of the protein kinase is missing or overexpressed. This observation might be exploited by simultaneous delivery of the JIP1 peptide to weaken or strengthen the specificity of JNK inhibitors such as SP600125. Very recently, JNK1-substrate docking interactions have also been successfully targeted with JIP1 peptide-mimicking small molecules such as 4-(2,3-dihydrobenzol[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-5-(5-nitrothiazol-2-ylthio)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ol (BI-78D3)<sup>122</sup>.

Understanding feedback loops. As discussed in this Review, kinase pathways are interconnected. In particular, the presence of negative and positive feedback loops is not restricted to the TAK1–TAB1–p38α pathway, as shown in some detail in FIG. 5. Rather, there is also crosstalk between NF-κB and MAPK pathways<sup>123</sup>. Suppression of the NF-κB pathway at the level of IKK or NF-κB subunits leads to sustained activation of JNK due to decreased expression of NF-κB-induced JNK inhibitory proteins<sup>124,125</sup>. Likewise, MK2 provides a negative feedback for NF-κB signaling<sup>126</sup> and, as outlined above, IKKβ can be both a negative or a positive regulator of inflammatory pathways. It is thus fair to assume that, as with the numerous extracellular cytokine loops, feedback mechanisms within the kinase

Figure 5 | Where to go from p38α — kinase networks and feedback control. To select targets in a specific signalling pathway, it will be necessary to understand the complete network of signalling interactions. In this scheme, some consequences predicted from recent observations of interfering with upstream or downstream kinases within the p38α network are shown. **a** | The wild-type (WT) situation. p38α is transiently activated by TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1; also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase 7)–TAB2/3 (TAK1-binding protein 2/3)-mediated phosphorylation of MKK3 (MAPK kinase 3) and MKK6. TAK1 also activates c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) via MKK4/7 and inhibitors of kB kinase (IKKs, not shown). JNKs stimulate activator protein 1 (AP1)-type heterodimeric c-Jun-containing transcriptional activators. MKK3/6-independent activation of p38α may occur through TAB1-dependent auto-activation<sup>95</sup> and through phosphorylation by ZAP70 (REF. 96). Active p38α controls inflammatory gene transcription and mRNA stability and translation by phosphorylating and activating MAPK-activated protein kinase 2/3 (MK2/3, responsible for fast post-transcriptional control<sup>64</sup>) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 5/4 (also known as nuclear mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1–2 (MSK1/2), responsible for slow transcriptional repression<sup>13</sup>). MK2/3 and MSK1/2 may have opposing net effects on steady-state levels of mRNA. p38α also phosphorylates transcription factors (including activating transcription factor 2, myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C and cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein 1) responsible for fast stimulation of transcription (not shown). p38α-mediated phosphorylation of TAB1 inhibits TAK1 and shuts off signalling<sup>28,93</sup>. **b** | p38α inhibition or knockout. Failure of negative regulation of TAK1 leads to prolonged JNK activation and is likely to increase inflammatory gene expression in conjunction with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signals<sup>5,93</sup>. **c** | MKK3/6 inhibition or knockout. Allosteric activation of p38α by interaction with TAB1 may still lead to some p38α activation<sup>95</sup>, although at a reduced level. This is reflected by decreased but not abolished inflammatory gene expression<sup>97,98</sup>, which might be prolonged owing to reduced transcriptional feedback inhibition through MSK1/2 (REF. 13). **d** | MK2/3 inhibition or knockout. Activation of p38α and negative feedback mediated by TAB1 is normal. MK2/MK3-mediated mRNA stabilization is absent, so inflammatory gene expression is transient and weak<sup>12,162</sup>.

REVIEWS

**Box 4 | Kinase docking**

Specific protein–protein interactions contribute to the specificity and efficiency of signalling within the different mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and are achieved by scaffolding proteins and docking domains<sup>150</sup>. MAPK kinases (MKKs or MAP2Ks) often contain a domain of versatile docking (DVD)<sup>151</sup> for binding to their activator kinase MAP3K and a docking (D) site (also known as a kinase-interaction motif, KIM) for interacting with the MAPK, which is activated by the MAP2K. MAPKs have a common docking (CD) motif, which enables them to bind to both their activating MAP2Ks and their D site-containing substrates, such as MAPK-activated protein kinases (MKs) and transcription factors<sup>150</sup>. In addition, some substrates of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) family of MAPKs, such as some immediate early genes, contain a docking site for ERK (DEF) motif that specifically binds to the catalytic domain<sup>152</sup>.

Tailor-made personal therapies. The possibility that inflammation could be the result of gene-based distinct alterations in protein kinase signalling activities in different patients cannot be excluded. So, for a causal therapy, patient protein kinase activity profiling could be necessary. This could be achieved by phosphoprotein antibody array analysis of intracellular kinase substrates of cells and tissues that are relevant to the pathology. This analysis would have to be complemented by characterization of the genes corresponding to protein kinases with increased activity to understand the activating mutations and assess the ability of existing small molecules to inhibit the mutant protein. Identification of specifically increased protein kinase activities and underlying molecular mechanisms could then help in the selection of an appropriate, patient-specific small-molecule inhibitor therapy. In this regard, it is interesting to note that there have been some clinical cases in which the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with imatinib in patients who also have rheumatoid arthritis leads to improvement not only in the leukaemia but also of the rheumatoid arthritis<sup>135,136</sup>. Taking into account the low number of such reports compared with the approximately 1% of patients undergoing treatment for CML who are statistically likely to have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, this indicates that there may be patient-specific pathway alterations that can be efficiently targeted by small molecules in some patients but not in others.

### Concluding remarks

The future therapeutic use of orally and topically available small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors in chronic inflammation seems realistic. Inhibition of several potential target kinases — such as protein kinases of innate immunity, including IRAKs, MK2, MK3, TPL2 and MEKK3, as well as protein kinases mainly involved in adaptive immunity, such as JAKs and SYK — is effective and has so far not been connected with adverse effects. Inhibitors against JAKs and SYK will be further tested in the clinic, but specific and potent small-molecule inhibitors against innate immunity kinase targets will soon be available as a result of iterative design using three-dimensional structures and kinome-wide screens. Alternative strategies for inhibiting protein kinase docking are promising and should be further developed, not only with peptides but also with small molecules. Some of the small-molecule inhibitors of the potential target kinases in innate immunity may fail to reach the clinic, but will at least provide new insight into the regulation of inflammatory signalling networks in innate immunity. Others will be successful in animal models of inflammation as a proof of concept and become small-molecule drug candidates that will hopefully pass further clinical trials for various forms of chronic inflammation. However, in contrast to oncology, where some small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors have made it into the clinic in record time, the way for such molecules in inflammation will be more difficult, because evidence of higher efficacy compared with available treatments, fewer side effects and superior toxicity profiles are required for any new drug used for the long-term treatment of non-malignant chronic diseases.
