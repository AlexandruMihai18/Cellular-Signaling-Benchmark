**Abstract**

Mastitis induces release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and has been linked with reduced reproductive performance. To further elucidate the role and mechanism of action of TNFα on ovarian cells, the effect of TNFα on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-induced steroidogenesis and IGF-I binding sites in granulosa and thecal cells as well as the hormonal regulation of TNFα receptors were evaluated. Granulosa and thecal cells were obtained from small (1–5 mm) and large (≥8 mm) bovine ovarian follicles, respectively, and cultured for 3–4 days. During the last 2 days of culture, cells were treated with various hormones and steroid production and specific binding of ¹²⁵I-IGF-I and ¹²⁵I-TNFα was determined. Two-day treatment with 30 ng/ml of TNFα decreased (*P* < 0.05) IGF-I-induced estradiol production by granulosa cells and IGF-I-induced androstenedione production by thecal cells. Two-day treatment with 10 and 30 ng/ml of TNFα decreased (*P* < 0.05) specific binding of ¹²⁵I-IGF-I to thecal cells, but had no effect on specific binding of ¹²⁵I-IGF-I to granulosa cells, or on specific binding of ¹²⁵I-IGF-II to thecal cells. TNFα did not compete for ¹²⁵I-IGF-I binding to granulosa or thecal cells whereas unlabeled IGF-I suppressed ¹²⁵I-IGF-I binding. Insulin inhibited (*P* < 0.10) whereas FSH had no effect on the number of specific ¹²⁵I-TNFα binding sites in granulosa cells. In contrast, LH increased (*P* < 0.10) whereas insulin had no effect on specific ¹²⁵I-TNFα binding sites in thecal cells. These results suggest that IGF-I and TNFα receptors in granulosa and thecal cells are regulated by hormones differentially.

# 1. Introduction

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a cytokine produced by activated macrophages (Beutler and Cerami, 1988; Gruss, 1996; Rink and Kirchner, 1996), and in cattle systemic levels of TNFα increase acutely after exogenous endotoxin treatment (Kenison et al., 1990; Peel et al., 1990; Elsasser et al., 1994; Sartin et al., 1998) and after coliform mastitis (Nakajima et al., 1997; Hoeben et al., 2000). A recent study indicates that episodes of clinical mastitis during early lactation inhibit reproductive performance of dairy cattle (Barker et al., 1998). It has been hypothesized that infection-induced increases in TNFα levels may cause ovarian pathology such as ovarian cysts because TNFα directly inhibits granulosa and thecal cell steroidogenesis in cattle (Spicer and Alpizar, 1994; Spicer, 1998) and in other species (Spicer et al., 1995; Norman and Brannstrom, 1996; Terranova, 1997). In bovine ovaries, TNFα is localized in corpora lutea, in layers of granulosa cells lining the antrum of follicles, and throughout the membrana granulosa of atretic follicles (Roby and Terranova, 1989). Alone, TNFα has little effect on ovarian steroidogenesis but in the presence of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) or insulin, TNFα has dramatic inhibitory effects on steroidogenesis (Spicer, 1998). How TNFα accomplishes its inhibitory effect on steroidogenesis is not completely understood. Moreover, granulosa and thecal cells contain TNFα receptors (Veldhuis et al., 1991; Naz et al., 1997; Spicer, 1998) but what hormones, if any, regulate ovarian cell TNFα receptors is unknown. Ovarian dispersates from TNFα receptor type-I knockout mice do not exhibit the typical inhibitory response to TNFα, demonstrating that TNFα receptors are needed for the TNFα-induced inhibition of steroidogenesis (Roby et al., 1999). Therefore, we set out first to compare the dose-response of IGF-I on granulosa cell aromatase activity and thecal cell androstenedione production in the absence and presence of TNFα, and then to determine if the inhibitory effect of TNFα was due to either (1) a reduction in the number of IGF-I binding sites or (2) direct competition for IGF-I binding sites on bovine thecal cells. In addition, we evaluated whether gonadotropins and/or insulin could influence the number of TNFα receptors in ovarian cells in vitro.

# 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Hormones and reagents

Recombinant human IGF-I obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); ovine FSH (F1913, FSH activity 15 × NIH-FSH-S1 U/mg) and bovine LH (L1914, LH activity 2.0 × NIH-LH-S1 U/mg) obtained from Scripps Laboratories (LaJolla, CA); insulin (bovine, 25.7 U/mg), trypsin, pronase E, collagenase, hyaluronidase, DNase, and fetal calf serum (FCS) obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO); testosterone obtained from Steraloids (Wilton, NH); recombinant bovine IGF-II obtained from Monsanto Co. (St. Louis, MO); and recombinant bovine TNFα obtained from CIBA-GEIGY (Basle, Switzerland) were used.

## 2.2. Cell culture

Ovaries of beef and dairy cattle obtained at slaughter from a nearby abattoir were brought to the laboratory on ice and processed as previously described for obtaining granulosa

cells from small (1–5 mm) follicles (Langhout et al., 1991) and thecal cells from large (≥8 mm) follicles (Stewart et al., 1995). Small follicle granulosa cells were used because they respond to hormone treatment more explicitly than large follicle granulosa cells (Raja et al., 1995; Spicer and Stewart, 1996b; Spicer and Francisco, 1997). Medium was a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium and Ham’s F12 containing gentamicin, glutamine and sodium bicarbonate. Approximately \(2 \times 10^5\) viable cells were seeded in each plastic multiwell containing 1 ml of medium. Viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method and averaged \(54.2 \pm 5.2\%\) for granulosa cells and \(91.2 \pm 1.5\%\) for thecal cells. Cultures were kept at \(38.5^\circ\)C in a 95% air, 5% CO₂ atmosphere, and medium was changed every 24 h. Cells were maintained in the presence of 10% FCS for the first 2 days of culture, washed twice and treated for an additional 2 days with various doses (0, 3, 10 or 30 ng/ml) of recombinant bovine TNFα, LH (0 or 30 ng/ml), and/or IGF-I (0, 3, 10, 30 or 100 ng/ml) in serum-free medium for experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4. Doses of TNFα were selected based on previous studies that indicated blood plasma TNFα concentrations reached 3–100 ng/ml in cattle after endotoxin challenge (Kenison et al., 1990; Peel et al., 1990; Elsasser et al., 1994; Steiger et al., 1999; Hoeben et al., 2000). Doses of LH and IGF-I were selected based on previous studies (Spicer et al., 1993; Stewart et al., 1995; Spicer and Stewart, 1996a). For experiments 3 and 4, cells were maintained in 10% FCS for a total of 3 days. At the end of the culture period, \({}^{125}\)I-IGF-I and -II binding assays were conducted as previously described (Spicer et al., 1994; Spicer and Stewart, 1996a); number of specific \({}^{125}\)I-IGF-I (experiment 2) or IGF-II (experiment 3) binding sites were determined by saturation analysis since these receptors exhibit a single class of high affinity binding sites (Spicer et al., 1994). For experiment 5, cells were maintained in 10% FCS for 2 days, washed and treated for an additional 2 days with either 0 or 100 ng/ml of insulin and 50 ng/ml of FSH (for granulosa cells) or 100 ng/ml of LH (for thecal cells). At the end of the treatment period, \({}^{125}\)I-TNFα binding assays were conducted as previously described (Spicer, 1998); number of specific \({}^{125}\)I-TNFα binding sites (experiment 5) were determined by saturation analysis since these receptors exhibit a single class of high affinity binding sites (Spicer, 1998). In parallel cultures for experiments 2, 3 and 4, number of cells were determined using a Coulter counter as previously described (Langhout et al., 1991; Stewart et al., 1995). For experiment 1, number of cells were determined in the same wells in which the media was collected; these cell numbers were used to calculate steroid production on a pg per \(10^5\) cell basis.

IGF-I, -II, and TNFα were iodinated using chloramine-T methods as previously described (Spicer et al., 1994; Kenison et al., 1990), and the binding assays conducted as previously described for \({}^{125}\)I-IGF-I (Spicer et al., 1994) and \({}^{125}\)I-TNFα (Spicer, 1998). Briefly, the \({}^{125}\)I-IGF-I and -II and \({}^{125}\)I-TNFα assays were conducted directly in the culture wells with an assay volume of 400 μl. Incubation was for 16 h at \(4^\circ\)C for \({}^{125}\)I-IGF-I and -II (Spicer et al., 1994) and for 4 h at \(25^\circ\)C for \({}^{125}\)I-TNFα (Spicer, 1998). For saturation analysis used in experiments 2, 3 and 5, non-specific binding was determined by co-incubating each of the \({}^{125}\)I-labeled hormones with 500 ng per well of their respective unlabeled hormones.

### 2.3. Statistical analyses

Experimental data are presented as means ± S.E. of measurement from replicated experiments. Each experiment was replicated at two or more times, and within each

experiment, treatments were applied in triplicate culture wells. Each experiment was conducted on a separate pool of cells obtained from 10 to 50 ovaries (average 34 ± 7 ovaries) for granulosa cells, and 5–10 follicles from four to eight cows for thecal cells. The main effects and their interactions on the variables measured were assessed by general linear models procedure of SAS (SAS, 1999). Specific differences among treatments were tested using Fisher's protected least-significant difference procedure (Ott, 1977). Significance was declared at \( P < 0.05 \) unless noted otherwise. Binding of \({}^{125}\)I-IGF-I and -II and \({}^{125}\)I-TNFα to granulosa and thecal cells was expressed as dpm per \( 10^5 \) cells.

Granulosa and thecal cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 10% FCS, and then cells were washed and incubated with 60,000 dpm of \({ }^{125}\)I-IGF-I in the absence or presence of 0, 10 or 100 ng per well of TNFα (open bars) or IGF-I (hatched bars). Values are means of three separate experiments and are expressed as a percentage of control (total) \({ }^{125}\)I-IGF-I binding which averaged 380 and 1800 dpm per \(10^5\) cells for granulosa and thecal cells, respectively. (*) Mean differs (\(P < 0.05\)) from control (0 ng per well), nd = 10 ng per well of IGF-I was not determined.

## 3. Results

The objective of experiment 1A was to evaluate the effect of TNFα on IGF-I-induced estradiol production by granulosa cells. Two-day treatment of granulosa cells with 30 and 100 ng/ml of IGF-I in the absence of TNFα increased (\(P < 0.001\)) estradiol production by 1.6- and 3.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A). At 30 ng/ml, TNFα completely blocked (\(P < 0.001\)) the stimulatory effect of 30 and 100 ng/ml of IGF-I on estradiol production by granulosa cells (Fig. 1A). Number of granulosa cells were not affected (\(P > 0.10\)) by TNFα but were increased (\(P < 0.05\)) by IGF-I by 3.1- to 5.6-fold (Table 1).

The objective of experiment 1B was to evaluate the effect of TNFα on IGF-I-induced androstenedione production by thecal cells. Two-day treatment of thecal cells with 3–100 ng/ml of IGF-I in the absence of TNFα increased (\(P < 0.001\)) androstenedione production by 1.6- to 4.9-fold above controls (Fig. 1B). TNFα reduced (\(P < 0.05\)) the dose-dependent stimulatory effect of IGF-I on androstenedione production such that the ED\(_{50}\) for IGF-I increased from 25 ng/ml in the absence of TNFα to 60 ng/ml in the presence of TNFα. Number of thecal cells were also affected by both IGF-I (\(P < 0.05\)) and TNFα (\(P < 0.05\)).

Fig. 4. Effect of 2-day treatment of gonadotropins and bovine insulin on specific ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}-\mathrm{TNF} \alpha$ binding sites in bovine granulosa (panel A) and thecal (panel B) cells (experiment 5). After the 2-day treatment, cells were washed and then incubated with 125,000 dpm of ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}-\mathrm{TNF} \alpha$. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 500 ng per well of unlabeled recombinant bovine TNF $\alpha$. Values are means $\pm$ S.E. of three separate experiments for each panel. (*) Mean differs $(P<0.10)$ from control.

At $100 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{ml}$, IGF-I increased $(P<0.05)$ thecal cell numbers by $55 \%$ in the absence of TNF $\alpha$ and by $22 \%$ in the presence of TNF $\alpha$ (Table 1).

The objective of experiment 2 was to evaluate the effect of TNF $\alpha$ on number of IGF-I receptors in granulosa and thecal cells. Two-day treatment of granulosa cells with 3, 10 or $30 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{ml}$ of TNF $\alpha$ had no effect $(P>0.10)$ on specific binding of ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}-\mathrm{IGF}-\mathrm{I}$ (Fig. 2A) or on granulosa cell numbers (data not shown). In contrast, dose of TNF $\alpha$ affected $(P<0.05)$ thecal cell IGF-I binding. Specifically, treatment of thecal cells with $3 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{ml}$ of TNF $\alpha$ had no effect $(P>0.10)$ on specific binding of ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}-\mathrm{IGF}-\mathrm{I}$ to thecal cells (Fig. 2B). However, 10 and $30 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{ml}$ of TNF $\alpha$ decreased $(P<0.05)$ specific binding of ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}-\mathrm{IGF}-\mathrm{I}$ to thecal cells by 20 and $25 \%\), respectively (Fig. 2B). Thecal cell numbers averaged $2.25 \pm 0.09 \times 10^{5}$ cells per well and were not influenced $(P>0.10)$ by dose of TNF $\alpha$.

The objective of experiment 3 was to evaluate the effect of TNF $\alpha$ on number of IGF-II receptors in thecal cells. Two-day treatment of thecal cells with $30 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{ml}$ of TNF $\alpha$ had no effect $(P>0.10)$ on specific binding of ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}-\mathrm{IGF}-\mathrm{II}$, which averaged 20,997 and $20,186 \pm 1776 \mathrm{dpm}$ per $10^{5}$ cells in control and TNF $\alpha$-treated thecal cells, respectively $(n=2$ experiments). Also, cell numbers were not affected $(P>0.10)$ by TNF $\alpha$ and averaged $0.78 \pm 0.15 \times 10^{5}$ cells per well.
The objective of experiment 4 was to determine if TNFα could compete for IGF-I binding on granulosa or thecal cells. At 10 and 100 ng per well, TNFα did not inhibit binding of ${}^{125}$I-IGF-I to granulosa or thecal cells, whereas 10 and/or 100 ng per well of IGF-I inhibited ($P < 0.05$) binding of ${}^{125}$I-IGF-I to both granulosa and thecal cells (Fig. 3).

The objective of experiment 5A was to determine if FSH, insulin or both influence number of TNFα receptors in granulosa cells. FSH had no effect ($P > 0.10$) on the number of specific ${}^{125}$I-TNFα binding sites in granulosa cells (Fig. 4A). However, insulin tended to inhibit ($P < 0.10$) the number of specific ${}^{125}$I-TNFα binding sites (Fig. 4A). Granulosa cell numbers averaged $0.26 \pm 0.05$, $0.60 \pm 0.15$, $0.16 \pm 0.02$ and $0.76 \pm 0.17 \times 10^5$ cells per well in control, FSH plus insulin, FSH, and insulin-treated cultures, respectively; insulin treatment increased ($P < 0.05$) granulosa cell numbers whereas FSH was without effect ($P > 0.10$).

The objective of experiment 5B was to determine if LH, insulin or both influenced number of TNFα receptors in thecal cells. In thecal cells, insulin had no effect on the number of specific ${}^{125}$I-TNFα binding sites, whereas LH tended to increase ($P < 0.10$) the number of specific ${}^{125}$I-TNFα binding sites in the absence (but not presence) of insulin (Fig. 4B). Thecal cell numbers averaged $1.66 \pm 0.09$, $2.30 \pm 0.06$, $2.34 \pm 0.06$ and $1.70 \pm 0.09 \times 10^5$ cells per well in control, LH plus insulin, insulin and LH-treated cultures, respectively; insulin treatment increased ($P < 0.05$) thecal cell numbers whereas LH was without effect ($P > 0.10$).

## 4. Discussion

Previous studies have shown that TNFα inhibits gonadotropin, insulin- and/or IGF-I-induced steroid production by granulosa and thecal cells in cattle (Spicer and Alpizar, 1994; Acosta et al., 1998; Spicer, 1998), rats (Adashi et al., 1990; Andreani et al., 1991; Zachow et al., 1993), pigs (Veldhuis et al., 1991; Tekpetey et al., 1993; Urban et al., 1996), and humans (Montgomery Rice et al., 1999). Results of the present experiments indicate that the inhibitory effect of TNFα on IGF-I-induced estradiol production (Spicer, 1998) is not due to TNFα affecting the number of IGF-I receptors or due to TNFα competing for IGF-I binding to its receptor in granulosa cells. Similarly, in sertoli cells, the male homologue to the granulosa cell in the female, TNFα had no effect on the number of IGF-I receptors or the amount of IGF-I receptor mRNA (Besset et al., 1996). However, results of the present study indicate that in thecal cells, TNFα may directly decrease the number of IGF-I binding sites but that TNFα cannot compete for IGF-I binding sites on thecal cells (Fig. 5). This is likely a decrease in the number of “functional” IGF-I receptors since TNFα increased the ED${}_{50}$ of IGF-I-stimulated bovine thecal cell androstenedione production in the present study. The inhibitory effect of TNFα on number of IGF-I binding sites in thecal cells was specific since TNFα had no effect on number of thecal cell IGF-II binding sites in the present study. Thus, the inhibitory effect of TNFα on IGF-I-induced thecal steroidogenesis may involve a decrease in the number of IGF-I receptors. Because the TNFα-induced decrease in IGF-I receptor number is much smaller (i.e. 20–25% decrease) than the TNFα-induced decrease in androstenedione production (i.e. ≥50% decrease) previously reported (Spicer, 1998) and observed in the present study, the inhibitory effect of TNFα on steroidogenesis may not be solely due to a TNFα effect on IGF-I receptor number (Fig. 5). The fact that

Dashed line with an encircled –, indicates inhibitory effects; solid-line with an encircled +, indicates stimulatory effects. Panel A: IGF-I, insulin and FSH are all stimulatory (solid line) to aromatase activity (estradiol production). TNFα inhibits (dashed line) IGF-I- and insulin-induced aromatase activity, while insulin inhibits TNFα receptor synthesis. Panel B: IGF-I, insulin and LH are all stimulatory (solid line) to 17,20-lyase activity (androstenedione production). TNFα inhibits (dashed line) IGF-I- and insulin-induced androstenedione production as well as IGF-I receptor synthesis. LH increases TNFα receptor synthesis while insulin blocks this LH-induced increase in TNFα receptor synthesis.

TNFα inhibits IGF-I-induced estradiol production by bovine granulosa cells (Spicer, 1998) but has no effect on number of granulosa cell IGF-I receptors supports this notion. Other studies have indicated that TNFα can directly decrease steroidogenic enzyme activity and protein kinase activity in rat thecal cells (Andreani et al., 1991; Zachow et al., 1993) as well as rat and pig granulosa cells (Adashi et al., 1990; Veldhuis et al., 1991; Santana et al., 1995; Urban et al., 1996). In human granulosa cells, TNFα inhibits the ability of exogenous cAMP to increase estradiol secretion (Montgomery Rice et al., 1999). Additional studies will be required to determine if these mechanisms are operative in bovine granulosa or thecal cells.

In agreement with previous studies, IGF-I increased whereas TNFα and gonadotropins had little or no effect on number of bovine granulosa (Spicer et al., 1993; Spicer and Alpizar, 1994; Spicer and Chamberlain, 1998) and thecal (Stewart et al., 1995; Spicer, 1998; Spicer
and Chamberlain, 1998) cells in the present study. It is likely that the increases in cell numbers in the present studies are due to mainly increased cell proliferation because (1) cell numbers in control cultures do not decrease after 24 h of exposure to serum-free medium if allowed to plate in 10% FCS for 2 days (Langhout et al., 1991; Stewart et al., 1995); (2) cell viability is greater than 94% and does not differ between control and TNFα-, leptin-, IL-2-, or insulin-treated cultures after 24 h of treatment (Spicer and Alpizar, 1994; Raja et al., 1995; Spicer and Francisco, 1998); and (3) compared with control cultures, insulin- and IGF-I-treated cultures exhibit increased cell numbers between days 0 and 2 of treatment (Langhout et al., 1991; Stewart et al., 1995). In control cultures, thecal cell numbers decrease less than 20% between days 1 and 2 of treatment (i.e. days 3 and 4 of culture) after 10% FCS medium is changed to serum-free medium on day 2 of culture (Spicer and Stewart, 1996a). Previous studies with rat thecal (Andreani et al., 1991) and granulosa (Emoto and Baird, 1988) cells, and bovine granulosa cells (Brunswig-Spickenheier and Mukhopadhyay, 1993; Spicer and Alpizar, 1994) show no effect of TNFα on cell viability. Similarly, bovine luteal cells did not undergo apoptosis when treated with 100 ng/ml of TNFα (Friedman et al., 2000). Consistent with the lack of effect of TNFα on granulosa cell numbers in the present study, Vickers et al. (2000) reported that TNFα has no effect on Fas ligand, the latter of which triggers apoptosis in bovine granulosa cells. Also, it is unlikely that the granulosa or thecal cells luteinized with time in culture in the present study. First, progesterone production remains constant or does not increase with time in culture using this culture paradigm (Langhout et al., 1991; Stewart et al., 1995; Spicer and Stewart, 1996a). Secondly, the morphology of the granulosa and thecal cells retain a fibroblastic appearance (Spicer, unpublished observations). Third, aromatase activity of granulosa cells remains responsive to FSH, IGF-I and insulin, and their responses increase between days 3 and 4 of culture (Spicer et al., 1993; Spicer and Chamberlain, 1998). Similarly, androstenedione production by thecal cells remains responsive to LH, insulin and IGF-I, and their responses increase between days 1 and 4 of culture (Stewart et al., 1995).

Results of the present study show, for the first time, that TNFα receptor number in bovine granulosa and thecal cells are hormonally regulated (Fig. 4). Previous studies have shown that bovine granulosa and thecal cells (Spicer, 1998) and luteal cells (Sakumoto et al., 2000) have high affinity, specific TNFα binding sites. Thus, TNFα likely inhibits ovarian cell steroidogenesis via signal transduction from its own receptor. In the present study, FSH had no effect on TNFα receptors in granulosa cells whereas LH increased TNFα receptors in thecal cells (Fig. 5). The former finding is in agreement with Veldhuis et al. (1991) who found no effect of FSH on the number of TNFα receptors in porcine granulosa cells. In cultured porcine Sertoli cells, FSH increased the number of TNFα binding sites and TNFα receptor mRNA (Mauduit et al., 1996). Thus, hormonal regulation of TNFα receptors may also differ between FSH-responsive Sertoli cells and granulosa cells. Similarly, estradiol stimulates TNFα receptor mRNA in human endometrial carcinoma cells (Ininns et al., 1992) whereas estradiol has no effect on TNFα receptors in porcine Sertoli cells (Mauduit et al., 1996). Previously, a membrane-permeable protein kinase A activator, dibutyric-cAMP, increased specific binding of \[^{125}\]I-TNFα in promyelocytes, histiocytes, thymoma cells and macrophages (Scheurich et al., 1989). Other activators of protein kinase A signal transduction pathways were also found to enhance TNFα receptor expression in
this same study (Scheurich et al., 1989). Whether LH-induced cAMP and protein kinase A signal transduction in thecal cells are involved in the increase in TNFα receptors observed in the present study will require further elucidation. Insulin alone reduced TNFα receptors in granulosa cells but had no effect on TNFα receptors in thecal cells of the present study, further suggesting that TNFα receptors are differentially regulated in granulosa and thecal cells of cattle. However, insulin blocked the stimulatory effect of LH on TNFα receptor number in thecal cells of the present study. Previously, insulin alone had no effect on TNFα receptor number in cultured porcine granulosa cells (Veldhuis et al., 1991). These differences in cellular responses may depend on the interplay between the intracellular cascade mechanisms (e.g. protein kinase C and cAMP pathways) that may co-exist within a particular cell type. Such differences exist between small and medium follicle granulosa cells in pigs (Hylka et al., 1989). The protein kinase C activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), reduces the number of TNFα receptors in a variety of cell types including human fibroblasts and HeLa cells (Holtmann and Wallach, 1987). This latter finding is consistent with the inhibitory effect of insulin on TNFα receptors in granulosa cells observed in the present study since insulin is known to activate protein kinase C activity (Peluso et al., 1995; Reks et al., 1998). Collectively, results of the present and previous studies indicate that the hormonal regulation of TNFα receptors varies dramatically among cell types.

In summary, TNFα decreases IGF-I receptors in thecal cells but not granulosa cells. Insulin decreases TNFα receptors in granulosa cells but not thecal cells. LH increases TNFα receptor in thecal cells whereas FSH is without effect in granulosa cells. In conclusion, the interaction among TNFα, IGF-I, insulin and gonadotropins differ between granulosa and thecal cells in spite of the fact that TNFα inhibits steroidogenesis in both cell types (Fig. 5). Further studies will be required to identify the specific mechanism of action of TNFα within bovine granulosa and thecal cells.
