### ABSTRACT

![Chemical Structures](https://i.imgur.com/chemical_structures.png)

Neocarzinostatin (1) biosynthesis is proposed to involve a vicinal diol intermediate. It is reported that NcsF2, one of two epoxide hydrolases encoded by the NCS gene cluster, catalyzes regiospecific addition of H₂O to C-2 of both (*R*)- and (*S*)-styrene oxides to afford (*R*)- and (*S*)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediols, respectively, supporting its proposed role in 1 biosynthesis. (*R*)-1-Phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (87% yield and 99% ee) was obtained from (*±*)-styrene oxide hydrolysis by cocatalysis using NcsF2 and SgcF, the complementary epoxide hydrolase from the C-1027 biosynthetic pathway.

Neocarzinostatin (NCS) is an enediyne antitumor antibiotic produced by *Streptomyces carzinostaticus* ATCC 15944 as a chromoprotein complex consisting of an apoprotein and the NCS chromophore (1).$^{1}$ Characterization of the NCS biosynthetic gene cluster from *S.* *carzinostaticus* led to a proposed convergent biosynthetic pathway in which the peripheral moieties are appended to an enediyne core vicinal diol intermediate to afford 1 (Figure 1A).$^{2}$ The presumed (*S*)-vicinal diol is thought to arise from hydrolysis of an epoxide intermediate by one of two putative epoxide hydrolase (EH) enzymes encoded by the NCS gene cluster, NcsF1 or NcsF2.$^{2}$ A similar convergent logic has been proposed for the C-1027 (2) biosynthetic pathway in *Streptomyces globisporus* (Figure 1B),$^{3}$ from which an EH, SgcF, has been characterized using styrene oxide as a substrate mimic.$^{4}$ SgcF was shown to catalyze an

Figure 1. Proposed biosynthetic pathways featuring (A) an NcsF2-catalyzed formation of an $(S)$-vicinal diol intermediate from an $(S)$-enediyne core epoxide precursor for NCS (1) and (B) an SgcF-catalyzed formation of an $(R)$-vicinal diol intermediate from an $(S)$-enediyne core epoxide precursor for C-1027 (2). The vicinal diol moieties in 1 and 2 concerned in this study are shaded.

enantiocovergent process ${ }^{5}$ in which $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ attacks primarily at C-2 for $(R)$-styrene oxide and at the more hindered C-1 for $(S)$-styrene oxide (Figure 2A). ${ }^{4}$ Consequently, the major product is always the $(R)$-vicinal diol, but the 37-fold higher specificity of SgcF for $(S)$-styrene oxide implicates an $(S)$-epoxide enediyne intermediate in C-1027 biosynthesis, consistent with the proposed pathway (Figure 1B). ${ }^{3,4}$ Here, we report that NcsF2, but not NcsF1, efficiently hydrolyzes styrene oxide. In contrast to SgcF, NcsF2 is regiospecific for C-2 such that hydrolysis of $(R)$- and $(S)$-styrene oxides yield $(R)$- and $(S)$-vicinal diol products, respectively (Figure 2B). Although hydrolysis of an $(S)$-epoxide enediyne intermediate would afford the expected $(S)$-vicinal diol (Figure 1A), the 44-fold preference of NcsF2 for $(R)$-styrene oxide is inconsistent with our biosynthetic proposal ${ }^{2}$ and may be an artifact of using styrene oxide as a substrate mimic. By exploiting the complementary activities of NcsF2 and SgcF, we finally demonstrated the preparation of $(R)$-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol from racemic styrene oxide with excellent chemical yield and enantiomeric excess (Figure 2C).

We have previously predicted two genes, $n c s F 1$ and $n c s F 2$, within the NCS biosynthetic gene cluster, to encode EHs on the basis of bioinformatics analysis. ${ }^{2}$ We first cloned, overproduced in $E$. coli, and purified both NcsF1 and NcsF2 to homogeneity (Figure S1, Supporting Information). ${ }^{6}$ The EH activity of both enzymes toward racemic styrene oxide was then analyzed using HPLC. ${ }^{4,6}$ Incubation of NcsF2 (50 $\mu \mathrm{M}$ ) with 2 mM styrene oxide produced a single peak corresponding to 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, and in contrast, NcsF1 produced only a very minor peak, indicating a dramatically less efficient enzyme (Figure 3). Careful inspection of the selected EH protein sequences reveals that, in contrast to SgcF and NcsF2, NcsF1 may lack key amino acid residues conserved among EHs (Figure S2, Supporting Information). First, the acid residue of the nucleophile-His-acid catalytic triad has been replaced by Ala (Asp174-His361-Ala334) at its usual position after strand $\beta 7$, but some EHs are known to harbor this residue after strand $\beta 6 .{ }^{7}$ Second, the two canonical EH Tyr residues that activate the epoxide oxygen, one of which is absolutely conserved, ${ }^{7}$ are missing in NcsF1 (Pro234 and His303), although we note that the adjacent Tyr304 may function equivalently. Thus, although NcsF1 is 53% and 59% identical to SgcF and NcsF2, respectively, its unusual sequence and relatively inefficient hydrolysis of styrene oxide suggest an alternative function for this enzyme in 1 biosynthesis, perhaps for hydrolysis of the internal epoxide of the NCS enediyne core precursor (Figure 1A).

The observed activity of NcsF2 prompted further characterization of the enzyme. We then determined the steady-state kinetic parameters of NcsF2 toward $(R)$- and $(S)$-styrene oxides using a spectrophotometric assay ${ }^{6,8}$ to continuously monitor the formation of 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol. The Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to plots of initial velocity versus substrate concentration (Figure 4) to yield $k_{\text {cat }}=133 \pm 4 \min ^{-1}, K_{\mathrm{M}}=0.5 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{mM}$, and $k_{\text {cat }} / K_{\mathrm{M}}=266 \min ^{-1} \mathrm{mM}^{-1}$ for $(R)$-styrene oxide and $k_{\text {cat }}=31 \pm 2 \min ^{-1}, K_{\mathrm{M}}=5.0 \pm 0.6 \mathrm{mM}$, and $k_{\text {cat }} / K_{\mathrm{M}}=6 \min ^{-1} \mathrm{mM}^{-1}$ for $(S)$-styrene oxide, respectively. Thus, NcsF2 is 44-fold more specific for $(R)$-

together should generate (R)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol in high enantiomeric excess (Figure 2C). Indeed, we carried out the reaction with a 3.5:1 ratio of SgcF/NcsF2 with 14 mM styrene oxide and observed (R)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol in 87% yield with 99% ee (Figure 5B).<sup>6</sup> Such systems employing complementary enzymes have previously been used to generate enantiomerically enriched products.<sup>9</sup> For example, a potato EH and an engineered EH from *Agrobacterium radiobacter* AD1 together transformed racemic styrene oxide to (R)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol with 98% ee after complete conversion.<sup>9a</sup> Interestingly, these cases resulted from deliberate efforts involving screening many enzymes to obtain a suitable biocatalytic process. In contrast, our results arose fortuitously from studies of enediyne biosynthesis and highlight the biocatalytic potential available to be harnessed from our ever-expanding knowledge of natural product biosynthetic machineries.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the NcsF2 enzyme is active as an epoxide hydrolase toward styrene oxide, an activity consistent with its proposed function in hydrolyzing a terminal epoxide enediyne intermediate. We further showed that NcsF2 regiospecifically adds H₂O to the less hindered C-2 position of styrene oxide such that the stereochemistry is retained in the vicinal diol product. Surprisingly, the enantioselectivity of NcsF2 for (R)-styrene oxide to (S)-styrene oxide (*E* = 44) is inconsistent with preferential production of an (S)-vicinal diol biosynthetic intermediate, as would be expected on the basis of the structure of 1. However, NcsF2 remains our best candidate for this function, and its unexpected selectivity may reflect the inadequacy of styrene oxide as a substrate mimic. Moreover, the natural enediyne core epoxide precursor is likely a single enantiomer, in which case regioselective hydrolysis of an (S)-epoxide enediyne intermediate would produce the expected (S)-vicinal diol stereochemistry (Figure 1A).
