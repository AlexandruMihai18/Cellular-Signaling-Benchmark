### 1 Introduction

3-Amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA)-derived natural products are a sizeable group of secondary metabolites produced mostly by Actinomycetes. They fall, so far, into three structural classes: the great majority represents the family of ansamycins, in which AHBA has served as a starter for a polyketide assembly ultimately resulting in a macrocyclic lactam. A second class is the mitomycins, in which AHBA has been combined with an amino-sugar moiety to give unique tricyclic structures. And a third class, represented so far only by the saliniketals, may be called “degraded ansamycins”. AHBA-derived natural products exhibit a number of biological and pharmacological activities, such as antibacterial (rifamycin (1–2), streptovaricin (3), naph-thomycin (4), rubradirin (5)), anticancer (saliniketals (6–7), ansamitocins (8), mitomycins (9), ansatrienins (10), geldana-mycin (11)), lipoygenase inhibitory (tetrapetalone (12–13)), and antioxidant (Q-1047 (14)) activities (Fig. 1). In most of the compounds derived from it, AHBA gives rise to a structural moiety originally called a mC7N unit, a six-membered carbocycle, usually aromatic or quinoid, carrying an extra carbon and a nitrogen atom. These AHBA-derived mC7N units were identified not only as an important structural component of mitomycins, but also as the starter unit of naphthalenic and benzenic ansamycins. As revealed by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors and by genetic approaches, AHBA is biosynthesized by the unique amino-shikimate biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 2). In three reactions paralleling the normal shikimate pathway, the imine of erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) is converted into 5-deoxy-5-amino-dehydroshikimic acid, which is then aromatized to AHBA by the pyridoxal phosphate-enzyme, AHBA synthase. The origin of the imine of E4P was traced to the biosynthesis of kanosamine, which then undergoes phosphorylation, isomerisation and cleavage by transketolase. The biosynthesis of AHBA has recently been reviewed.

The biosynthetic genes for AHBA were first identified as part of the rifamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Most of the products encoded by these genes are consistent with the proposed AHBA biosynthetic pathway, such as aminoDAHP synthase (RifH), aminoDHQ synthase (RifG), aminoDHQ dehydratase (RifJ), AHBA synthase (RifK), and those putatively responsible for the early steps of iminoE4P biosynthesis, including oxidoreductase (RifL), phosphatase (RifM) and kinase (RifN) (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, AHBA synthase^{19,20} apparently catalyses both the transamination of UDP-3-keto-D-glucose at an early stage of the pathway and the final aromatization of aminoDHS to AHBA.^{15} The alignments of known AHBA synthases involved in ansamycin and mitomycin biosynthesis display high homologies among them.^{15} Thus, PCR-based screening with primers for the amplification of conserved regions of the AHBA synthase genes provides a valuable tool for mining potential producers for new AHBA-derived natural products.^{21–23}

Ansamycins are the predominant class of AHBA-derived natural products. They display extensive biological and pharmaceutical activities, and are used as antibiotics, anticancer agents, and enzyme inhibitors.^{24,25} Ansamycins are characterized by a macrocyclic lactam structure, in which an aliphatic ansa chain forms a bridge between two non-adjacent positions of a benzenic or naphthalenic chromophore.^{26} Rifamycins were the first group of ansamycins isolated from a microorganism,^ {25,27} and display a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.^{14,24} Since then, numerous other ansamycins and their derivatives have been found in different Actinomycetes and also in plants and mosses. On the basis of their chromophores, ansamycins are typically classified into naphthalenic and benzenic types.^{25} Their biosynthesis follows the logic of type I modular polyketide synthases (PKS), involving loading of the AHBA starter unit onto the first module followed by multiple steps of chain extension on subsequent modules of the PKS.^{25} Several reviews have been published on the discovery, classification, and biosynthesis of ansamycins.^{12,15,25} However, their great structural and biological diversity prompts continuing efforts to study the biosynthesis of ansamycins. To date, the biosynthetic gene clusters of nine ansamycins have been cloned and sequenced, and the biosynthetic mechanisms they encode are being investigated in depth.^{28–36}

Mitomycins have broad antitumor activities^{37–39} and have their biosynthetic origin in AHBA.^{14} The difference in their structures resides mainly in the patterns of methoxy- and amino-substituents attached to the mitosane skeleton.^{40,41} Mitomycin C (9) is widely used as a clinically important anticancer agent.^{42} The hydroquinone FR-900482 and related members display similar or even better antitumor activity.^{43}

AHBA-derived metabolites continue to fascinate both basic and applied scientists, by virtue of their complex biosynthetic and biochemical pathways as well as their pharmacological potential. This review describes the present state of knowledge of

## 2 Biosynthesis of naphthalenic ansamycins

The class of naphthalenic ansamycins contains the rifamycins,²⁸ the related compounds, streptovaricins,⁴⁴,⁴⁵ rubradirins,⁴,⁴⁶–⁴⁸ naphthomycins,³,⁴⁹,⁵⁰ hygrocins,⁵¹ and the recently described ansalactam A (16),⁵² chaxamycins,⁵³ and divergolides.⁵⁴ Their structural features include not only 1,4-naphthoquinone, but also 1,4-hydroxynaphthalene chromophores.²⁵ The biosynthesis of naphthalenic ansamycins has been investigated intensively by classical precursor feeding experiments as well as genetic and biochemical approaches. Feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors established that the m-C7N units are derived from AHBA,¹³,⁵⁵ and the aliphatic ansa chains are assembled from acetate, propionate, or isobutyrate extender units.⁵⁶

### 2.1 Biosynthesis of rifamycins and related compounds

A large number of derivatives of rifamycins have been prepared chemically and several, such as rifampicin, rifabutin and rifapentine, play a significant clinical role in the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy and AIDS-associated mycobacterial infections.⁵⁷–⁵⁹ Rifamycin-related ansamycins include kanglemycin

The rifamycin PKS consists of five proteins (Fig. 4). RifA contains a loading module at the amino terminus, which was identified as an adenylation (A)/thiolation (T) didomain. ${}^{16}$ Although the A domain was originally proposed to be an acyl-

The *rif* is the biosynthetic gene cluster of rifamycin from *Am. mediterranei* S699, *sare* is the biosynthetic gene cluster of saliniketal from *S. arenicola* CNS-205, *rub* is the biosynthetic gene cluster of rubradirin from *S. achromogenes* var. *rubadiris*, and *nat* is the biosynthetic gene cluster of rubradirin from *Streptomyces* sp. CS.

ring structure takes place on the nascent polyketide catalyzed by Rif-Orf19.⁵⁰ The *rif* cluster also contains several candidate genes for the post-PKS modifications, regulation, and transport. By gene inactivation analysis, *rif-orf5* was identified to be involved in the cleavage of the carbon chain of rifamycin W (26) and formation of the ketal structure. Similarly, *rif-orf4*, *rif-orf14*, and *rif-orf20* were proven to be responsible for the quinone reduction, 27-O-methylation, and 25-O-acetylation, respectively (Fig. 5B).²⁸,⁶⁹

The genome project of the rifamycin SV (2) producer, *Amycolatopsis mediterranei* U32, was completed in 2010, generating the first genome sequence of the genus *Amycolatopsis*.⁷⁰ The circular chromosome consists of 10.20 mega-base pairs with 9228 protein-encoding genes, and is one of the largest prokaryotic genomes ever sequenced. Twenty-six biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in the genome, putatively encoding the biosynthesis of polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, hybrid polyketide–nonribosomal peptides, and terpenoids. Interestingly, the *rif* cluster and four other clusters are located in the core region, and the other 21 biosynthesis gene clusters lie in the non-core region. Comparison between the biosynthetic gene cluster for rifamycin SV (2) from *Am. mediterranei* U32 and that for rifamycin B (1) from *Am. mediterranei* S699 disclosed a single-nucleotide variation within the congener of the cytochrome P450 gene *rif16*. The variation caused a missense R84W replacement, which abolished the function of the congener gene and the conversion of

rifamycin SV(2) to B(1). Moreover, the conversion of rifamycin  
SV(2) to B(1) was regained by introducing a *rif16* gene cloned  
from S699 into the U32 strain. However, whether the conversion  
is catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 enzyme Rif16 alone or  
together with other unidentified proteins still needs to be  
determined.⁷⁰  

### 2.2 Biosynthesis of saliniketals

Saliniketal A (6) and B (7) were originally obtained from the  
fermentation broth of the obligate marine Actinomycetes *Salinispora arenicola* CNS-205. Their antitumor activity is believed  
to be due to inhibition of the induction of ornithine decarboxylase, which plays an important role in the chemoprevention of  
cancer.⁵ Their unique structural features and promising biological activity stimulated extensive efforts towards their total  
synthesis.⁷¹  

The biosynthesis of saliniketals was originally proposed to  
involve assembly by a PKS from an unusual three-carbon starter  
unit and two acetate and five propionate extender units.⁵ It was  
noted that the structure and stereochemistry of the saliniketals  
corresponded exactly to that of the ansa chain of rifamycins, also  
produced by the organism, but rifamycin was considered unlikely  
to be the biosynthetic source of the saliniketals.⁵ Subsequent  
studies demonstrated the presence of *rif* biosynthetic genes in the  
saliniketal producer (Fig. 4).²⁹ Targeted inactivation of the  
AHBA synthase gene followed by supplementation of the  
mutant with \[^{15}N\] AHBA established that the primary amide  
nitrogen in saliniketals was derived from AHBA. This result and  
the detection of saliniketal in the rifamycin producer *Am. mediterranei* suggested a common origin of the two types of  
compounds and prompted the isolation of a saliniketal-rifamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from *S. arenicola*.⁵³ Systematic in vivo mutagenesis studies complemented by feeding experiments  
with \[U-\^{13}C₃\] propionate identified the gene *sare_1259* in *Sa. arenicola* CNS-205, corresponding to *orf5* in *Am. mediterranei*  
S699, as the key switch point. It encodes a cytochrome P450  
protein, which can catalyse oxidations of an early rifamycin  
structure at two alternate positions. This determines the fate of  
further conversion either to the saliniketals or to the more  
advanced rifamycins.⁵³ Chemical complementations of the  
AHBA synthase gene mutant with rifamycin macrocyclic intermediates established that 34a-deoxyrifamycin W (27) is the  
immediate precursor of the saliniketals. Based on these results,  
a logical biosynthetic pathway to the saliniketals was proposed  
(Fig. 6).⁷² The kind of novel and multifunctional P450 enzymes  
as *Sare_1259* may serve as a useful biochemical tools in generating structural diversity by chemoenzymatic or synthetic  
biology approaches.

trideoxy-3-C-4-O-dimethyl-3-C-nitro-D-xylo-hexose) (Fig. 7A).⁷³  
All these unusual moieties are critical for the antibacterial  
activity of rubradirins.⁷⁴,⁷⁵  

Although feeding experiments have not been carried out,  
a 105.6 kb DNA region of the *S. achromogenes var. rubadiris*  
chromosome, containing the complete rubadirin biosynthetic  
gene cluster, has been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the  
DNA sequence revealed 58 open reading frames putatively  
coding for the biosynthesis of a type I PKS, AHBA, AMC,  
DHDP, D-rubranitrose, transport and regulation (Fig. 4).³⁰,⁷⁶  
Seven putative AHBA biosynthetic genes are scattered in three  
different regions within the cluster. Two large ORFs, *rubA* and  
*rubB*, encoding a loading module and six extension modules for  
the biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone, are separated by  
approximately 37 kb. Using AHBA as the starter unit, RubA and  
RubB are proposed to catalyse the chain extension by four  
methylmalonyl-CoAs and two malonyl-CoAs. RubF shows high  
homology with amide synthases, such as RifF, and is proposed to  
catalyze the release of the polyketide and formation of the  
macrolactam. The C-terminal part of the dual functional RubCl  
is homologous to NovH, adenylating tyrosine in novobiocin  
biosynthesis, whereas the N-terminal part of RubCl, homologous to NovL, is an amide synthase catalyzing the connection of  
the AMC and DHDP moieties.³⁰,⁷⁷ Together with the RubCl,  
homologs of NovI and NovJ in novobiocin biosynthesis, are  
involved in the biosynthesis of the AMC moiety and the amide  
bond formation (Fig. 7B).³⁰,⁷⁷ The proteins encoded by *rubN1-N8* accord well with the biosynthesis of the D-rubranitrose moiety  
from glucose-1-phosphate. The latter is activated to the thymidyl  
diphosphate (TDP) derivative by TDP-D-glucose synthase  
(RubN1), followed by dehydration by 4,6-dehydratase (RubN2)  
to give TDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose.⁷⁸ Subsequently, TDP-3-amino-2,6-dideoxyglucose is formed via dehydration at C2–C3  
by a 2,3-dehydratase (RubN3),⁷⁹ 4-ketoreduction by RubN6,  
and transamination at C-3 by RubN4.⁸⁰ Furthermore, a 3-C-methyltransferase (RubN5) and an O-methyltransferase  
(RubN7), respectively, catalyzed the methylation at C-3 and of  
the OH group on C-4.³⁰ RubN8 is a flavin-dependent mono-oxygenase and putatively responsible for the formation of the  
hydroxylaminosugar, which probably converts to TDP-D-rubranitrose through the nitroso intermediate (Fig. 7C).⁸¹ The glycosyltransferase RubG1 or RubG2 then attaches the TDP-D-rubranitrose to the aglycone.³⁰  

At the most upstream region of the gene cluster resides an  
ABC transporter, RubT1, which is supposed to bind and  
promote the efflux of rubadirin from bacterial cells and to  
achieve the resistance.⁸² Additionally, *rubR1* and *rubR3*, along  
with *rubRg1-Rg3* within the gene cluster, were proposed to work  
together to regulate rubadirin biosynthesis.⁸²  

### 2.3 Biosynthesis of rubadirins

Rubadirins were originally isolated from *Streptomyces achromogenes var. rubadiris* and inhibit many Gram-positive  
bacteria, including the obstinate strains of *Staphylococcus aureus*.⁴,⁴⁶,⁴⁷ The structures of rubadirins (5, 31) consist of  
four covalently linked distinct moieties, including rubransarol  
(29, 30), 3-amino-4-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (AMC),  
3,4-dihydroxydipicolinate (DHDP), and D-rubranitrose (2,3,6-  

### 2.4 Biosynthesis of naphthomycins

Naphthomycins have the longest aliphatic ansa carbon chain in  
the ansamycin family, and are mainly isolated from *Streptomyces*. Naphthomycin A (4) was isolated as a yellow pigment  
from *S. collinus* Tü105, and its structure and absolute configuration was determined by X-ray analysis and chemical degradation.³,⁴⁹,⁵⁰ The diversity of naphthomycin structures (4, 32–42)  
results mainly from the different substitutions on C-30, which

include hydroxy-, methoxy-, chloro-, and alkylthio- modifications (Fig. 8).³³ Naphthomycins show antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor activities, different from the antibacterial rifamycins and streptovaricins.

The biosynthetic origins of the carbon skeleton of both the naphthoquinoid nucleus and the macrocyclic ansa chain of naphthomycin A (4) and actamycin (38) were investigated by feeding $^{13}$C-labeled precursors followed by $^{13}$C-NMR analysis of the products.⁸⁴⁻⁸⁶ AHBA was shown to be the precursor the naphthoquinoid nucleus, and the polyketide backbone is assembled from seven propionate and six acetate extender units (Fig. 8). Identification of a portion of the putative naphthomycin C biosynthetic gene cluster of *S.* collinus Tü1892 has been reported.⁸¹ Seven genes *napC–I* were proposed to participate in AHBA formation, and an amide synthase gene *napAI*, probably for the formation of the ansa macrolactam, was located at the downstream end of an incomplete PKS. Moreover, a halogenase

NapB might be responsible for the halogenations leading to naphthomycins B (39) and H (33), although no halogenated compound was discovered in *S.* collinus Tü1892.⁸⁷

Recently, we have cloned and sequenced the naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from *Streptomyces* CS, an endophyte from *Maytenus hookeri*, and confirmed its involvement in naphthomycin biosynthesis through deletion of a 7.2 kb region.⁸⁸ Thirty-two genes were identified in the 106 kb cluster, including eight genes for AHBA synthesis, five polyketide synthase genes, and genes putatively involved in modification, regulation, transport and resistance (Fig. 4). Among thirteen chain extension modules, 2 ketoreductase (KR) and 6 dehydratase (DH) domains were found to be redundant. Interestingly, redundancy of reductive domains seems to be quite prevalent in naphthalenic ansamycin clusters, including those for rifamycin and rubradirin biosynthesis.¹⁶,³⁰ Gene *natF* encodes an amide synthase, with a high homology to RifF and RubF, which is responsible for the

chain-release of the fully extended polyketide chain and formation of the naphthomycin macrolactam.³²,⁶⁹ Gene *nat2* is highly homologous to *rif-orf19*, a monooxygenase probably involved in the formation of the naphthalene ring. The inactivation of *nat2* completely abolished naphthomycin productivity, suggesting its involvement early in the polyketide assembly process. The tailoring gene *nat1* encodes a flavin-dependent halogenase, and exhibits 73% amino acid identity to halogenase Asm12 from the ansamitocin biosynthetic gene cluster of *Actinosynnema pretiosum* (Fig. 9).³¹ Remarkably, the naphthomycin production could be restored by complementation of a *nat1* mutant with cloned *asm12*, and the *asm12* mutant was complemented by cloned *nat1* to restore ansamitocin production. However, attempts at *in vitro* chlorination with recombinant Nat1 and Asm12 purified from *E. coli* have so far been unsuccessful.³¹

In addition, the streptovaricin complex also displays potent activity against RNA tumor viruses.⁹¹,⁹²

Streptovaricin biosynthesis has only been studied by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled putative precursors.⁹³,⁹⁴ The incorporation of \[^{14}C\]AHBA, albeit in low efficiency, clearly proved that the aromatic chromophore of streptovaricins was derived from AHBA.⁹³,⁹⁴ Furthermore, \[^{14}C\]methionine was efficiently incorporated into the C-methyl groups at C-3 of the naphthalenic chromophore, and the methylenedioxy, and methoxy carbons (Fig. 10). This C-methylation on the naphthoquinone chromophore is apparently unique in ansamycin biosynthesis, and a putative gene encoding the

### 2.5 Biosynthesis of other naphthalenic ansamycins

#### 2.5.1 Streptovaricins. Streptovaricins were first isolated in 1957 and share an almost identical structural skeleton with protorifamycins.⁴⁴,⁴⁵ It is noteworthy that streptovaricins (3, 45–49) feature a methyl group at the C-3 position of the naphthoquinone chromophore (Fig. 10). Streptovaricins have been found to have a broad antibacterial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.⁴⁴,⁴⁵,⁸⁹,⁹⁰ The degree of bacterial inhibition is different among individual members of the streptovaricins. Streptovaricin A (3) and G (49) are the most active compounds.

2.5.2 Ansalactam A. Ansalactam A (16) is a new member of naphthalenic ansamycin and isolated from the marine *Strepto- myces* sp. strain CHN-189. The unique structural feature of ansalactam A is characterized by a γ-lactam residue with an aliphatic side chain, in which the AHBA-derived amino group is involved, and it was spiro attached to the naphthalenic backbone (Fig. 1). Additionally, the C22-C27 aliphatic side chain of the lactam also represents a novel polyketide biosynthetic building block. The biosynthetic origin of ansalactam A (16) was first determined by the PCR amplification with a pair of degenerate AHBA synthase-specific primers and the genomic DNA of strain CHN-189, whose product was classified to the clad of AHBA synthases involved in naphthalenic ansamycin biosynthesis (16). Subsequently, incorporation experiments with ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$-labeled propionate and acetate further demonstrated that the polyketide carbon skeleton of ansalactam A (16) is assembled from six methylmalonates, a malonate, and a possible novel 2-isobutyrylmalonate.

The biosynthetic paradigm of 2-isobutyrylmalonate was initially investigated with the successful incorporation of ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$-labeled acetate and isobutyrate, which probably forms the diketide intermediate (E)-4-methyl-2-pentenyl-CoA. Further synthesis and successful incorporation of ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$-labeled (E)-4-methyl-2-pentenoic acid established the route from acetate and isobutyrate to (E)-4-methyl-2-pentenoic acid, and suggested a further conversion to the novel extender unit 2-isobutyrylmalonyl-CoA catalyzed by a crotonyl-CoA reductase/carboxylase (CCR). ${ }^{52}$

2.5.3 Divergolides. Divergolides (17, 18) are produced by a *Streptomyces* endophyte of a mangrove tree and display antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. Their structures were elucidated through extensive NMR spectroscopic and X-ray approaches. Interestingly, the structures of divergolides and hygrocins display unprecedented plasticity of the ansa chain with the hybrid of macrolide and macrolactam (Fig. 1). The biosynthetic pattern of divergolides was speculated, although the efforts of isotope-labeled experiments were unsuccessful due to a low yield of these compounds in the producer. Similarly with the ansalactam A (16), the novel isobutyrylmalonate building block also participates in the AHBA-primed PKS backbone assembly of divergolides. The polyketide ring of four divergolide members was proposed to be originated from one biosynthetic pattern, which is disrupted by a Baeyer–Villigerase and followed with the formation of macrolide. Additionally, the reactive intermediate of divergolides putatively undergoes a spontaneous “in-built diversification” to result in the production of different derivatives. ${ }^{54}$

3 Biosynthesis of benzenic ansamycins

Benzenic ansamycins include ansamitocins/maytansine, ${ }^{6}$ geldanamycin, ${ }^{95}$ herbimycins, ${ }^{96}$ macbecins, ${ }^{36}$ ansatrienins, ${ }^{8,97}$ cytotrienins, ${ }^{98}$ tetrapetalones ${ }^{99,100}$ and cebulactams. ${ }^{101}$ The characteristic of their structures is a 1,4-benzquinone or a 1,4-hydrobenzoquinone chromophore. ${ }^{25}$ Similar to naphthalenic ansamycins, AHBA is the source of the chromophores, and the polyketide ansa chains are assembled with acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, or unusual “glycolate” extender units, as demonstrated by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors.

3.1 Biosynthesis of ansamitocins/maytansines

Maytansine (53) and its analogs were first isolated from higher plants and mosses as extremely potent antitumor agents. ${ }^{6}$ *Actinosynnema pretiosum* ATCC 31565 was the first known microbial producer of the related ansamitocins (8, 50–58). ${ }^{6}$ Moreover, a series of novel $N$-glycosylated ansamitocins (65), with a $\beta-D$ -glucosyl substituent instead of the methyl group linked to the macrolactam amide nitrogen, were isolated from cultures of *Ac. pretiosum* ATCC 31565 on solid ISP2 medium. ${ }^{102,103}$ Recent screening for natural products to cope with agricultural fungal diseases led to the discovery of the polar ansacarbamitocins (54–58) from *Amycolatopsis* CP 2808 (Fig. 11). ${ }^{104}$

Ansamitocins and maytansines, often referred to as maytansinoids, represent a class of antitumor agents of extraordinary potency. ${ }^{6,64,105}$ They have considerable potential as “warheads” in immunoconjugates with tumor-specific antibodies and considerable research is underway towards their clinical

development.¹⁰⁶,¹⁰⁷ Immunoconjugates of maytansine (53) exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties with high antigen-specific cytotoxicity and low side-effects.¹⁰⁸ The biological activity, structure-activity relationships, and the mechanism of action of ansamitocins have been summarized in previous reviews.¹⁰⁵,¹⁰⁹,¹¹⁰ Extensive investigations have also been carried out on the biosynthesis of ansamitocins in *Ac. pretiosum* ATCC 31565, and have been reviewed (Fig. 12, Fig. 13).⁶⁴,¹⁰⁵

The unusual “glycolate” unit in the backbone of the ansamitocin polyketide arises from 2-methoxymalonyl-ACP, which is formed from 1,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate as a precursor by the action of the products of the *asm13–17* subcluster.¹¹¹,¹¹² As proposed, the Asm16 protein initiates the biosynthesis by activating and tethering 1,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate to the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl arm of the ACP Asm14, followed by methylation of 2-OH by the methyltransferase Asm17. Stepwise oxidations of C-3 catalyzed by Asm13 and Asm15 then generate the 2-methoxymalonyl-ACP extender unit (Fig. 13A).¹¹³,¹¹⁴

The early steps of polyketide assembly were probed by feeding experiments with chemically synthesized diketide, triketide and tetraketide intermediates to an AHBA synthase mutant. According to the results, the cryptic stereochemistry of the intermediate diketide is *R*¹¹⁵ and the subsequent double bond migration was proven to occur during processing of the nascent polyketide on module 3 of the PKS (Fig. 13A).¹¹⁶ In other work, proansamitocin (59) was successfully synthesized,⁹⁸ and new ansamitocin derivatives were obtained by mutasynthesis, complementing the AHBA (−) mutant with 3-aminobenzoic acid analogs carrying F, Cl, or Br at the C-4 position.¹¹⁷,¹¹⁸ Furthermore, the synthesis of seco-proansamitocin, the probable substrate for the amide synthase Asm9, and its bioconversion into ansamitocins by the AHBA (−) mutant have been reported.¹¹⁹

The product of the gene *asm25* is responsible for the unique amide N-glycosylation as shown by gene inactivation and complementation. Further biochemical characterization of Asm25 revealed that UDP-glucose is the sugar donor and N-desmethylan samitocins is the acceptor. The glycosylation at the amide nitrogen appears to be an alternative step to the methylation catalyzed by the N-methyltransferase Asm10. Asm25 also exhibits considerable promiscuity and can transfer glucose from UDP-glucose to a broad range of aglycones, generating N-glucosylated derivatives of ansamycins and other compounds. Therefore, Asm25 and Asm10 compete for the same substrate and are considered to catalyze alternate final steps in the post-PKS modifications of ansamitocins (Fig. 13B).¹²⁰

Asm10 is similar to some S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent O-methyltransfrases and classified into the leucine carboxyl methyltransferases superfamily.¹²⁰ Through gene inactivation and complementation, *asm10* was proven to be responsible for the N-methylation of ansamitocins. Asm10 also shows broad substrate flexibility toward other N-desmethyl ansamycins and synthetic indolin-2-ones. By site-specific mutagenesis, Asp154 and Leu155 of Asm10 were shown to be essential for catalysis, possibly through the binding of SAM.¹²¹ Another methyltransferase gene, *asm7*, was previously shown by gene inactivation to be responsible for the methylation of the hydroxyl group at C-20.¹²²

Various transcriptional regulatory genes have been identified within the *asm* gene cluster.¹²³ Gene *asm2* encodes a TetR type transcriptional regulatory protein, the inactivation of which resulted in an increased ansamitocin yield.¹²⁴ However, overexpression of *asm2* in *Ac. pretiosum* unexpectedly caused an increase in ansamitocin production, as reported by a different research group.¹²⁵ Overexpression of another gene, *asm39*, encoding a regulatory

protein with a histidine kinase-like ATPase C-terminal domain, also led to increased ansamitocin production.¹²⁶

The occurrence of such typical bacterial metabolites as the maytansinoids in specific higher plants and mosses raises the question of whether these compounds are synthesized by the plant tissues or by plant-associated microorganisms. This issue was addressed by work that showed considerable variation in the presence or absence of maytansinoids in individual plants of a maytansinoid-containing species and absence of maytansinoids from cell cultures and greenhouse-grown plants. The DNA of maytansinoid-containing plants did not contain an AHBA synthase gene, but such a gene was clearly present in the DNA of the mixture of organisms cultured from the rhizosphere of such plants. Thus it is most likely that the plant maytansinoids are produced not by the plant but by a plant-associated microorganism.¹²⁷

### 3.2 Biosynthesis of geldanamycins, herbimycins, and macbecins

Geldanamycin (11), the first benzoquinoid ansamycin isolated, is produced by *S. hygroscopicus*.⁹⁵ It has strong antitumor activity against various cancer cell lines and also possesses modest activity against Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, malaria, protozoa, and parasites.¹²⁸ The herbimycins (66–68) and macbecins (69, 70) have similar structures with small variations in substitution patterns, and similar biological activities. According
to feeding experiments with labeled precursors, the three $O$-methyl groups of geldanamycin (11) are derived from methionine and the two “glycolate” units come from glycerate or glycolate (Fig. 14A). ${ }^{129-131}$

The biosynthetic gene cluster for geldanamycin (11) was first cloned and characterized from *S. hygroscopicus* NRRL 3602. It contains 23 ORFs and spans an 85 kb DNA region (Fig. 12). ${ }^{33,34}$ The PKS genes, $gdmA1-A3$, encode one loading module and 6 extension modules. The C-terminus of GdmA3 is immediately followed by an amide synthase gene $gdmF$. Five genes, $gdmH, I$, $J, K, G$ are expected to code for the synthesis of the 2-methoxymalonyl-ACP extender units. Four tailoring genes are involved in the conversion of progeldanamycin (71) (or its 4,5-dihydro form) into geldanamycin (11). The products of $gdmL$, $gdmM, gdmN$, and $gdmP$ are likely to perform C-17 hydroxylation, C-21 oxidation, C-7 $O$-carbamoylation, and C-4–C-5 dehydrogenation, respectively. Other genes were identified for possible regulation, resistance or transport (Fig. 12). ${ }^{34}$ The geldanamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was also cloned from *S. hygroscopicus* 17997, and the inactivation of one of the two AHBA synthase genes abolished geldanamycin (11) biosynthesis. ${ }^{132,133}$ The herbimycin and macbecin biosynthetic gene clusters were also cloned from *S. hygroscopicus* AM3672 and *Ac.*

pretiosum ATCC 31280, respectively (Fig. 12). ${ }^{36,96}$ These three biosynthetic gene clusters for geldanamycin, herbimycin, and macbecin, especially their PKS portions, show a very similar organization (Fig. 12).

The post-PKS modifications of geldanamycin (11) were further defined in *S. hygroscopicus* JCM 4427 by gene inactivation and bioconversion experiments. ${ }^{134,135}$ The carbamoyltransferase gene $gel8$ was disrupted and resulted in the accumulation of descarbamoylated compounds without the $cis$ double bond between C-4 and C-5. This result not only verified that $gel8$ encodes a carbamoyltransferase active in geldanamycin (11) biosynthesis, but also suggested that the enoylreductase domain of PKS module 6 is functional and progeldanamycin (71) does not bear a double bond at the C-4/C-5 position. This experiment further indicated that C-17 hydroxylation, 17-$O$-methylation, and C-21 oxidation occur prior to the carbamoylation reaction. ${ }^{135}$ The formation of the C-4/C-5 double bond was established as the last modification reaction, based on the bioconversion of descarbamoyl-4,5-dihydrogeldanamycin (73) to geldanamycin (11) in a mutant lacking the PKS genes (Fig. 14B). ${ }^{135}$ The functions of all the tailoring genes and the order of post-PKS modifications were characterized by gene inactivation experiments and some minor components from the

corresponding mutants were isolated.¹³⁴,¹³⁶,¹³⁷ In a mutant defective in AHBA synthesis, geldanamycin derivatives were obtained by mutasynthesis feeding various AHBA analogs, some of which show promising anticancer activities.¹³⁸–¹⁴⁰

There are five putative regulatory genes (gel14, gel17, gel19, orf10, and orf11) in the geldanamycin biosynthetic gene cluster in *S. hygroscopicus* JCM 4427. The LAL-family genes gel14 and gel17, and the TetR-family gene gel19 are positively required for geldanamycin (11) biosynthesis in a cascade manner. Inactivation of any of these genes caused a loss of geldanamycin (11) productivity.¹⁴¹,¹⁴²

3.3 Biosynthesis of ansatrienins/mycotrienins

The redox pair ansatrienin A (10)/ansatrienin B (75) produced by *S. collinus* are identical to the mycotrienin I (10)/mycotrienin II (75) pair identified from the fermentation broth of *S. risbieriensis*.⁸,⁹⁷ Their unique structures are characterized with three conjugated double bonds in the 21-membered macrolactam ring, and a cyclohexanecarboxylic moiety (CHC) attached via a D-alanine residue to the macrocycle (Fig. 15A).⁸,¹⁴³ They exhibit potent activity against fungi and yeasts, as well as cytotoxicity and limited antibacterial activity. Labeled AHBA was specifically and efficiently incorporated into the aromatic

chromophore.¹⁴⁴ Feeding experiments also identified the biological origin of alanine was D-alanine, rather than L-alanine, and the single O-methyl group was derived from methionine.¹⁴⁴,¹⁴⁵ In addition, the CHC moiety was identified to originate stereospecifically from shikimic acid¹³¹ (Fig. 15A).

The 20 kb DNA region of the ansatrienin biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned from *S. collinus* by a reversed genetic approach with the AHBA synthase gene *rifK* and the enoyl-CoA reductase gene *chcA* as probes. Besides *chcA*, the incomplete gene cluster also contains a peptide synthase gene *ansC*, a subcluster of seven genes proposed to be responsible for AHBA biosynthesis (*ansA*, *B*, *E*, *F*, *G*, *H*, *I*), and four other genes, *ansJ*, *K*, *L*, *M*, possibly related to CHC biosynthesis. In addition, the 5′ end of a polyketide synthase gene contained an acyl-ACP ligase domain.⁸⁷,¹⁴⁶

During the biosynthesis of the CHC moiety, CoA-activated shikimic acid was proposed to undergo dehydration, double bond reduction, and isomerization reactions catalyzed by a series of enzymes (Fig. 15C).¹²,¹⁴⁴,¹⁴⁷,¹⁴⁸ First, the NADPH-dependent enoyl-CoA reductase (ChcA) was characterized after activity-based purification from the cell-free extract of *S. collinus*. Purified ChcA could catalyze the three α,β-double bond reductions required for the formation of CHC, including the final reductive conversion of 1-cyclohexenylcarbonyl-CoA to cyclohexanycarbonyl-CoA.¹⁴⁹,¹⁵⁰ The 2-cyclohexenylcarbonyl-CoA isomerase (ChcB) catalyzed the penultimate step to isomerize 2-cyclohexenylcarbonyl-CoA to 1-cyclohexenylcarbonyl-CoA. The active ChcB protein exhibited broad substrate specificity and catalyzes double bond isomerization of both cyclic and acyclic substrates.¹⁵¹ Furthermore, when the putative CHC biosynthetic gene cassette was introduced into the *bkd* mutant of *S. avermitilis*, the producer of avermectins, the analog doramectin with a CHC moiety was accumulated in the engineered strain without addition of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid.¹⁵²

Recently, the completed biosynthetic gene cluster of ansatrienin A (10) and related trienomycin A (76), trienomycin B (77) and thiozinotrienomycin E (78) was cloned with a transcriptome-based mining strategy from *S. flavescens* DSM 9954. The 90-kb contiguous DNA region of the *myc* gene cluster harbors 32 ORFs, containing all genes required for the biosynthesis of AHBA (*mycB1–B7*), polyketide backbone (*mycD1–D5*), and CHC moiety (*mycA1–A4*) (Fig. 12). Gene *mycE* encodes an amide synthase responsible for the PKS lactamization, and four genes *mycF1–F4*, respectively, encode *N*-acetyltransferase, monooxygenase, *O*-methyltransferase, and esterase for post-PKS modifications. Moreover, one modular NRPS gene (*mycC*) is proposed to be responsible for the incorporation of alanine at C-11, followed by the attachment of the CHC moiety to the amino group of the alanine (Fig. 15B).³⁵

### 3.4 Biosynthesis of cytatrienins

Similar to the ansatrienins, the cytatrienins (79–82) were also isolated as a redox pair from a *Streptomyces* species. The ansa macrocyclic lactam of cytatrienin is assembled in a manner consistent with that of ansatrienin, but the side chain substituent is a unique 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid moiety (ACC) (Fig. 16A).⁹⁸,¹⁵² Cytatrienins exhibits potent apoptosis-inducing activity in human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells.¹⁵³,¹⁵⁴ Feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors demonstrated that the building blocks of the macrocycle and the single *O*-methyl group of cytatrienin were identical to those of ansatrienin. However, the aminocyclopropylcarbonyl moiety was found to be derived from the aminobutyryl moiety of L-methionine, rather than acetate or propionate (Fig. 16A).¹⁵⁵

Four adjacent genes, *cytCl–C4*, were cloned from the cytatrienin producer with a halogenase gene as the probe. *CytCl* is a free-standing adenylation enzyme involved in the activation

and tethering of L-valine or L-aminobutyric acid to the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the carrier protein CytC2. The tethered residues were halogenated by a nonheme iron halogenase CytC3 to afford both γ-chloro- and γ,γ-dichloroaminobutryl-S-CytC2. CytC4 is a thioesterase and catalyzed the release of the halogenated products from the carrier protein (Fig. 16B).<sup>156</sup> It is unclear, however, whether this reaction sequence is involved in cyclotrienin biosynthesis; no candidate gene for cyclopropane ring closure has been found in the organism.<sup>141</sup>

### 3.5 Biosynthesis of tetrapetalones

Tetrapetalone A (12) was first obtained as a novel lipoxygenase inhibitor from the culture filtrate of *Streptomyces* sp. USF-4727.<sup>10,157</sup> Further investigations on this strain led to the discovery of tetrapetalones B (13), C (83), and D (84). They share similar characteristic tetracyclic skeletons and β-D-rhodinosyl moieties (Fig. 17).<sup>100</sup> Recently, a new radical scavenger, ansaetherone (85), with similar structural features was also isolated from the same strain.<sup>158</sup> The unique tetracyclic core of the tetrapetalones has stimulated the considerable efforts towards their total synthesis.<sup>159</sup>

The biosynthesis of the tetrapetalones has so far only been studied by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors.<sup>146</sup> The feeding experiments indicated that the ansamacro-cyclic aglycon of the tetrapetalones is assembled on a polyketide synthase (PKS) using AHBA as the starter unit, followed by the incorporation of three propionate and one butyrate extender units. The deoxysugar moiety is derived from glucose as shown by incorporation of [1-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose (Fig. 17). The acetoxy groups of tetrapetalones B and D were shown to be derived from acetate. Furthermore, chemical oxidation with H₂O₂ of tetrapetalones A (12) and B (13) gave tetrapetalones C (83) and D (84), respectively. Based on these results it was proposed that hydroxylation and acetylation of tetrapetalone A (12) generates tetrapetalone B (13), and further oxidation of A (12) and B (13) produces tetrapetalones C (83) and D (84), respectively.<sup>160</sup> Clearly, more genetic and biochemical investigations are required to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of the biosynthesis of these tetracyclic ansamycins.

### 4 Biosynthesis of mitomycins and FR-900482

Mitomycins (9, 86–93) and FR-900482 (94, 95) have similar structures, and were identified from cultures of *Streptomyces* species. They represent a family of antitumor agents of extraordinary potency.<sup>37,39,42,161–163</sup> Based on the nature and stereochemistry of the side chains at C-9, mitomycins are classified into mitomycin A, B and G types (Fig. 18A).<sup>39</sup> However, only two members were found of the FR-900482 antibiotic type. The aromatic rings of the mitomycins are quinones, whereas those in FR-900482 are phenols (Fig. 18A). Coupled with their strong utility for cancer treatment, the novel compact skeleton of the mitomycins and FR-900482 has stimulated a great deal of work on their total synthesis. The biosynthesis of these antibiotics was initially studied by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors,<sup>164,165</sup> followed by genetic and biochemical approaches mostly on the mitomycins.

#### 4.1 Biosynthesis of mitomycins

Mitomycins A (86) and B (88) were discovered in cultures of *S. caespitosus* in 1956. Many of their analogues were obtained from different *Streptomyces* strains in subsequent studies.<sup>37,39,41,42</sup> The most active anticancer agent is mitomycin C (9), which was launched as an anticancer drug in Japan.<sup>39</sup> The antimicrobial and antitumor activities of the mitomycins result from their alkylation of DNA. The other important mechanism of action for mitomycins is the cleavage of DNA strands by superoxide and hydroxyl radicals generated under aerobic conditions.<sup>38,39</sup> AHBA was identified as the specific precursor of the mitomycin aromatic chromophore, including the attached methyl group, which arises from the AHBA carboxyl group.<sup>14</sup> Other precursors, such as D-glucosamine,<sup>165,166</sup> L-citrulline,<sup>165,166</sup> and methionine,<sup>164,167</sup> were also efficiently incorporated into mitomycins (Fig. 18A).

Cloning and sequencing of the mitomycin C (9) gene cluster from *S. lavendulae* NRRL 2564 revealed 47 genes in a 55 kb DNA region.<sup>168</sup> Seven putative AHBA biosynthesis genes, *mitA*, *G*, *J*, *P*, *S*, *T* and *mmcF*, are scattered throughout the gene cluster. However, no aDAHP synthase gene was found in this region (Fig. 18B). The glycosyltransferase MitB, CoA ligase MitE, and the putative C–C bond forming MitR, were proposed to be responsible for the formation of the mitosane skeleton (Fig. 18C). The inactivation of any or all these three genes abolished or severely reduced mitomycin production, but the homologies of these three genes shed little light on the mechanism of this interesting transformation. There are three SAM-dependent methyltransferase genes in this cluster. MitM could effectively perform the N-methylation of the aziridine nitrogen,<sup>31</sup> and the O-methyltransferase MmcR catalyzed the 7-O-methylation of the aromatic ring.<sup>40,168</sup> MitN probably methylates the C-9a side chain of mitomycin C.<sup>168,169</sup> The products of four reductase genes (*mitH*, *K*, *mmCI* and *J*) and a SAM-independent methyltransferase gene (*mmcE*) were

proposed to be involved in the reduction of the C-6 carboxyl to a methyl, although the mechanism of this process remains unknown. Two putative hydroxylases encoded by *mmcN* and *mmcT* may catalyze the hydroxylations at C-5, 7 and 9a of the mitosane skeleton. The gene product of *mmcS* is homologous to O-carbamoylation enzymes and is presumably responsible for the carbamoylation of the C-10 hydroxyl group (Fig. 18C).¹⁶⁸ Recently, potential intermediates of mitomycin biosynthesis have been synthesized chemically.¹⁷⁰,¹⁷¹ However, investigations of the mitomycin assembly mechanism with these synthesized intermediates have not yet been reported.

### 4.2 Biosynthesis of FR-900482

Antibiotic FR-900482 (94) and the related FR-66979 (95) were identified from cultures of *S. sandaensis* No. 6897 in a screening program for antitumor compounds.¹⁶²,¹⁶³ They not only exhibit close structural similarity to the mitomycins, but also display significant biological activity against a variety of tumor cells. Comparative evaluation of the hematological toxicity in mice revealed that FR-900482 (94) was superior to mitomycin C (9) both in efficacy and safety.¹⁶¹,¹⁷² FR-900482 (94) with its aziridine and a carbamoylated hydroxymethyl moieties resembles mitomycins, suggesting a common biosynthetic pathway, and the efficient incorporation of isotope-labeled AHBA and D-glucosamine into FR-900482 supports this notion (Fig. 18A).¹⁷³

## 5 Summary and perspectives

Although usually represented by its best-known members, such as rifamycin, maytansine, and mitomycin, the family of AHBA-derived natural products actually consists of more than 200 compounds that have been isolated and described in the literature. Besides different AHBA-derived chromophores, the compounds of this family display a rich structural diversity, including various ring sizes, other unique structural moieties and extensive structural modifications. The biosynthesis of many of these molecules was originally investigated by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled AHBA and other putative precursors. Insights into their biosynthesis accelerated rapidly with the development of molecular biology and genetic techniques. Using the AHBA synthase gene or degenerate primers for it as probes, more than 10 gene clusters for the biosynthesis of AHBA-derived compounds have been cloned and sequenced. The availability of this genetic information not only clearly shows the conservation of AHBA biosynthesis genes (Fig. 19A), but also represents the basis of structural diversity. *In vivo* gene inactivation experiments and complementation of the resulting mutants together with *in vitro* biochemical characterization of heterologously expressed biosynthetic enzymes deciphered the functions of individual genes and the overall biosynthetic machinery, while also generating many new derivatives and analogs.

Notably, AHBA synthases from naphthalenic and benzenic ansamycin gene clusters exhibit characteristic differences and
