In budding yeast, the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) is a signaling pathway known to drive cells out of mitosis and promote the faithful division of cells. The MEN triggers inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1), the master regulator of mitosis, and the onset of cytokinesis after segregation of the daughter nuclei. The current model of the MEN suggests that MEN activity is restricted to late anaphase and coordinated with proper alignment of the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) with the division axis. However, recent evidence suggests that MEN activity may function earlier in mitosis, prompting re-evaluation of the current model. Here we attempt to integrate this recent progress into the current view of mitotic exit.

Mitotic exit in budding yeast

The division of the cell involves its transient but profound reorganization to ensure the coordinated distribution of cellular material between the daughter cells. On completion, mitotic structures disassemble, mitotic regulators are inactivated, and interphase is reinstated. This process, termed mitotic exit, starts with the inactivation of Cdk1, the master regulator of mitosis, and the dephosphorylation of its substrates. As a consequence, the mitotic spindle breaks down, cytokinesis occurs, chromosomes decondense, and interphase functions resume. Importantly, faithful cell division requires tight coordination of mitotic exit with chromosome segregation. Although little is known about how mitotic exit is controlled in most systems, budding yeast is an exception. In this organism, a dedicated pathway—the MEN—triggers Cdk1 inactivation and the onset of cytokinesis on segregation of the daughter nuclei.

The MEN (reviewed in [1,2]) is a signaling pathway driven by the GTPase Tem1, which signals through the Hippo-related kinase Cdc15 (Figure 1A) [3–7]. Cdc15 activates two LATS-related MEN kinases, Dbf2 and Dbf20, which work in concert with the coactivator Mob1 to release the phosphatase Cdc14 from the nucleolus, from where it redistributes throughout the cell [4,7–12]. Cdc14 then antagonizes and inactivates Cdk1 by dephosphorylating its targets, promoting cyclin destruction and mediating the accumulation of the Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 [13,14]. In parallel, the Dbf2 kinase phosphorylates components of the cytokinesis machinery, such as the F-BAR protein Hof1, thereby promoting cytokinesis onset [15]. Thus, activation of the MEN and Cdc14 promotes Cdk1 inactivation and cell cleavage concomitantly.

It is widely accepted that MEN activity is coordinated with proper mitotic progression. This concept stems from the observation that mitotic exit does not occur if the mitotic spindle is misaligned with respect to the division axis of the cell [16–23]. These arrested cells lack MEN activity, thereby preventing the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. However, inactivation of a Tem1 inhibitor, the bipartite GTPase-activating protein (GAP) comprising the proteins Bub2 and Bfa1, bypasses this telophase arrest. As a consequence, cells with a mispositioned spindle and lacking either Bub2 or Bfa1 divide into binucleate mother cells and anucleate daughters [16–19,21,22]. Thus, MEN regulation ensures the coordination of mitotic exit with proper anaphase completion.

In the past few years, numerous studies have added to our knowledge about mitotic exit and the MEN, challenging some of the classical views. In this review, we discuss this recent progress and try to integrate these observations with current knowledge to provide a more comprehensive view of mitotic exit.

Regulation of MEN activity

A large body of work has established that the MEN signals the proper positioning of the SPBs, the yeast equivalent of centrosomes, with respect to the dividing cell. SPBs are embedded in the nuclear envelope and face the cytoplasm with their outer plaque, from which they nucleate astral microtubules (reviewed in [24]). At the SPBs, the MEN proteins interact with the centriolin-related factor Nud1 [25,26]. Throughout mitosis, Tem1, Bfa1, and Bub2 localize to SPBs and most strongly to the SPB directed toward the bud [17,21,27]. In late anaphase, most of the Bub2 and Bfa1 pools gather on the SPB in the bud, while Tem1 is released from their inhibition, thereby promoting activation of Cdc15 and Dbf2/20 and mitotic exit.

Thus, one interpretation of these data is that Tem1, and hence the MEN, is kept inactive by Bub2 and Bfa1 as long as no SPB has entered the bud, after which Tem1 is released from inhibition and triggers mitotic exit (reviewed in [1]). However, several studies in different model organisms suggest that it is not that simple. First, numerous

observations indicate that Tem1 activation is not sufficient to promote mitotic exit. Studies in yeast indicate that in the absence of Tem1, as well as in cells with mispositioned spindles, overexpression of Cdc15 is able to rescue MEN function in the sense that it promotes mitotic exit. However, these cells exited mitosis with wild type timing despite a continuous excess of Cdc15 [28], suggesting that the timing of mitotic exit does not depend solely on Tem1 or MEN activity. Accordingly, fusion of Cdc15 to the SPB leads to premature activation of the MEN, as measured by Dbf2 kinase activity, but does not lead to premature mitotic exit prior to anaphase completion [28]. Similarly, covalent tethering of Tem1 to the SPB promotes its activation and increases Cdc15 levels at the spindle poles, but does not promote premature mitotic exit either [29]. Therefore, Tem1 and MEN activation is required but not sufficient for triggering mitotic exit. As a consequence, the MEN might be active earlier in mitosis, but not yet trigger mitotic exit.

**Unexpected functions for the MEN in metaphase**

Although the current models propose that MEN activation occurs exclusively during exit from mitosis, recent studies suggest that the MEN is active early in mitosis, therefore challenging our current view. Because these insights were obtained from various model organisms, the timing and mechanism of MEN activation may be conserved. We discuss these findings below.

Recent evidence in budding yeast suggests that the MEN plays an important role in spindle asymmetry, the specification of SPB identity, and spindle positioning during metaphase (Figure 1B) [30, 31]. In wild type cells, the bud inherits the old SPB in nearly all cell divisions through the action of the spindle positioning factor Kar9, which localizes to the aster emanating from the old SPB and orients it toward the bud. However, disruption of Nud1, Tem1, Cdc15, Dbf2, or Dbf20 function in metaphase cells perturbs this bias. On MEN inactivation, Kar9 fails to localize to only one aster in early mitosis and no longer accumulates with a preference for the old SPB. Consequently, inheritance of old and new SPBs between the mother cell and bud in the subsequent anaphase is randomized. Although the function of the MEN in SPB specification and Kar9 asymmetry does not involve Cdc14 activation, direct phosphorylation of Kar9 by Dbf2 and Dbf20 is required in metaphase. Furthermore, reciprocal temperature-shift experiments confirm that the MEN promotes Kar9 asymmetry before anaphase onset. Collectively, these findings suggest that the MEN functions in the specification of SPB fate, spindle orientation, and Kar9 regulation as early as metaphase.

Furthermore, data on the nuclear export of specific mRNAs also suggests that the MEN kinase Dbf2 is active in early mitosis (Figure 1C). Indeed, Dbf2 promotes cell cycle progression at the G2/M transition by phosphorylating the arginine methyltransferase Hmt1 at position S9 to ensure its oligomerization and activation [32]. Hmt1 in turn promotes nuclear export of CLB2 mRNA and the synthesis and accumulation of the mitotic cyclin Clb2. Consequently, both the phospho-ablating mutation, S9A, of Hmt1 and inactivation of Dbf2 lead to similar defects in

cell cycle progression; that is, a delay in the accumulation of the Clb2 protein, spindle assembly, and anaphase onset. Whether this role of Dbf2 depends on other MEN proteins is unknown, but Dbf2 controls both Cdk1 activation in early mitosis via CLB2 mRNA export [33] and Cdk1 inactivation in late mitosis via Cdc14 release. This indicates that at a minimum the downstream MEN kinase Dbf2 is active throughout mitosis, even if its activity levels increase with mitotic progression [7].

Studies performed in other organisms promote similar views. The filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii, a relative of budding yeast, expresses orthologs of all MEN components and the set-up of the pathway appears similar [34]. However, MEN inactivation affects metaphase progression but not mitotic exit, demonstrating that MEN functions during metaphase in this filamentous fungus (Figure 1D), perhaps for the regulation of cyclin synthesis as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, two studies on fission yeast indicate that the Septation Initiation Network (SIN) pathway, the equivalent of the MEN, also functions before anaphase (Figure 1E). Similar to the MEN, SIN activity is low during early mitosis and reaches its maximum in late mitosis, when it promotes septum deposition (reviewed in [1, 35]). However, SIN signaling also controls the function of the annilin-related protein Mid1 at mitosis onset and proper assembly of the contractile actomyosin ring [36]. In addition, the Dbf2/20 homolog Sid2 promotes mitotic commitment by directly activating the NIMA-related kinase Fin1, although independently of the other known SIN components [37]. Finally, recent studies propose activities for the two mammalian Dbf2 homologs LATS1 and NDR1, as well as the Cdc15 homolog MST2 in G2 and metaphase. When HeLa cells are exposed to DNA damage, LATS1 downregulates the activity of PLK1 in G2 and triggers the DNA damage checkpoint [38]. In turn, MST2 and NDR1 are required for proper chromosome alignment during metaphase in HeLa cells (Figure 1F) [39]. These studies suggest that the activity of MEN components in cell cycle stages other than late mitosis is conserved throughout many eukaryotes. Together, these observations raise the question of when and how the MEN is activated and how the timing of mitotic exit is controlled.

**Defining which SPB carries MEN activity**

Nud1 and the MEN distinguish the two SPBs from each other in early yeast mitosis [30, 31], suggesting that these proteins must be differentially active between the old and new SPBs. However, we have no direct information to tell which of the two SPBs harbors MEN activity; therefore, we consider two possible models below.

Based on several studies, the first model suggests that MEN activity rises first on the old, daughter-bound SPB in late anaphase, thereby ensuring progression toward mitotic exit (Figure 2A) (reviewed in [1, 40]). In support of this view, mitotic exit is promoted by the entry of the old SPB into the bud [41], where Tem1 accumulates preferentially [17, 21, 27]. Moreover, the bud-residing protein Lte1 promotes mitotic exit [17], whereas the mother-residing factor Kin4 inhibits mitotic exit, as long as the mitotic spindle is mispositioned [42, 43]. Therefore, Lte1 and Kin4 appear to create an activating zone in the bud and an inhibitory zone

Figure 2. Two alternative models for how spindle orientation and mitotic exit are coordinated with one another. (A) This model suggests that Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) activity is stronger on the old, bud-directed spindle pole body (SPB). As long as the mitotic spindle is misaligned, the mother-residing protein Kin4 activates Bfa1/Bub2 on both SPBs and prevents Tem1 activity. On spindle alignment and elongation, the old SPB enters the bud and Tem1 on that pole escapes the inhibitory action of Kin4. In addition, the bud cortical protein Lte1 promotes Tem1 activity on the old SPB by antagonizing Kin4. In late anaphase, Cdc5-dependent amplification leads to strong MEN activity on both poles, which reaches into the nucleus and brings about mitotic exit. (B) This model is based on the assumption of stronger MEN activity on the new, mother-bound SPB. In early metaphase, before spindle alignment occurs, the Bfa1/Bub2 complex is released from the SPBs into the cytoplasm by the action of Kin4. In the cytoplasm, Bfa1/Bub2 inhibits the GTPase Tem1 and prevents premature mitotic exit, yet allowing Tem1 to form a local activity gradient in the vicinity of the SPBs, sufficient for its pre-anaphase roles. As the spindle aligns with the mother-bud axis, the old SPB approaches the bud and is liberated from the influence of Kin4, which is antagonized by Lte1, and Bfa1/Bub2 accumulates on that pole. This titrates Bfa1/Bub2 away from the cytoplasm and allows a further increase in Tem1 activity on the new SPB. This process continues during anaphase, leading to strong asymmetries of Bfa1/Bub2 and Tem1 on opposing poles. In late anaphase, Cdc5-dependent amplification of MEN activity leads to mitotic exit.

in the mother cell [41]. Accordingly, this model suggests that MEN proteins function on the bud-directed SPB, whereas the MEN is active on both SPBs only in late anaphase, as suggested by visualization of Mob1 (Figure 2) [44]. A first limitation of this model is that it is based on the presumption that localization is equivalent to function. However, if this were true, the same model would also assume, for example, that Cdc14 is active in the nucleolus, although it is accepted that its accumulation there mediates its repression.

This first model cannot reconcile several observations. For example, the GAP of Tem1 (Bfa1/Bub2) also localizes more strongly to the old SPB [21] and both mathematical modeling and fluorescence measurements indicate that most of the Tem1 on that SPB is bound to its GAP and thus likely to be inactive [45]. Unlike in the former study above [41], entry of the SPB into the bud was not strictly required for mitotic exit in cells expressing a non-cleavable cohesin (Scc1-RRDD) [46]. Although expression of this mutant resulted in failure to elongate the spindle and keep both SPBs in the mother cell, these cells still underwent mitotic exit on time [47] or after a modest delay [48]. In addition, Lte1 is not essential for mitotic exit under normal growth conditions, suggesting that Lte1 may not be the only factor responsible for MEN activation [49]. Finally, the MEN kinases Dbf2 and Dbf20 directly phosphorylate Kar9 to control its asymmetric distribution in metaphase. Although this could suggest that Dbf2 promotes Kar9 recruitment to microtubules on the aster of the old SPB, phosphorylation appears to displace Kar9 from microtubules rather than promote its recruitment to asters. This argues against the MEN being active on the old SPB during metaphase [30,31].

This last observation favors an alternative model in which the MEN is first activated on the new, mother-bound SPB first, early in mitosis (Figure 2B). In metaphase cells, where Bfa1 and Bub2 are mainly in the cytoplasm, activation of Tem1 on the new SPB would support the formation of a short gradient of MEN activity around that pole, facilitate Kar9 displacement from the microtubules of

the corresponding aster, and as a consequence promote the specific orientation of the old SPB toward the bud [30, 31]. The following lines of evidence support this model. The Bfa1/Bub2 complex localizes more strongly to the old SPB and, because of its higher dynamics, weakly accumulates on the new SPB [50]. Recent modeling studies suggest that a fraction of Tem1, which was required for mitotic exit, binds to SPBs independently of Bfa1 and Bub2 [45]. Together, this suggests that Tem1 is activated at the SPB, as demonstrated by [29], and that Bub2 and Bfa1 locally counteract this activity. Therefore, in this model Tem1 activation would probably occur on the SPB where the Tem1/GAP ratio is most favorable for Tem1; that is, on the new SPB that is directed toward the mother cell [45]. This interpretation also reconciles results indicating that the asymmetry of Bub2/Bfa1—through its removal from the new SPB—is required for mitotic exit in genetic backgrounds sensitized for MEN activity [51, 52].

In addition, this model is in agreement with the data on Kin4 and Lte1 function. These proteins control the dynamics of Bub2/Bfa1 interaction with SPBs, determining the proportion of its soluble fraction and their accumulation on the old SPB. Studies indicate that Lte1 restricts the localization of Bfa1 to the daughter-bound SPB [53] by preventing Kin4 from accumulating on that same pole [54, 55]. On the mother-bound SPB, Kin4 phosphorylates Bfa1 [56], accelerating the detachment of Bfa1 and Bub2 from the SPB [57]. This in turn allows them to utilize their GAP function on Tem1, most probably in the cytoplasm [45, 56]. Furthermore, release of Bub2/Bfa1 from SPBs by Kin4 in cells with mispositioned spindles leads to inhibition of the MEN and mitotic exit (Figure 2B) [57]. This dissociation promotes high GAP activity toward Tem1 in the cytoplasm as long as both SPBs reside in the mother cell. However, as soon as one SPB enters the bud and is freed from Kin4 influence, Bub2 and Bfa1 start to accumulate strongly on that pole, due to the influence of Lte1 [53]. We speculate that this leads to the titration of Bub2 and Bfa1 away from the cytoplasm and away from the new SPB in the mother cell, allowing further activation of Tem1 and subsequent spreading of MEN throughout the cell. Supporting this view, Bub2 and Bfa1 reach very high levels on the SPB in the bud during mitosis, at the cost of the cytoplasmic pool [45]. Thus, Kin4 might activate Bfa1/Bub2 in cells with mispositioned spindles by promoting its redistribution throughout the cell and contribute to the rapid activation of Tem1 in properly positioned spindles by facilitating the capture of most of the Bfa1/Bub2 complex on the SPB in the bud. This last statement predicts a possibly subtle mitotic exit phenotype in cells lacking Kin4. However, we predict this effect to be modest, because Bfa1 dynamics are slower but not abolished in kin4Δ mutant cells [57]. In population-based assays, no mitotic exit delay has been observed for kin4Δ mutant cells, and monitoring cell cycle progression in single cells might be required to fully test this prediction.

The model proposed here is also in agreement with the observation that tethering Tem1 to SPBs promotes its activation and makes it insensitive to inhibition during spindle mispositioning [29]. Indeed, in the model we propose, inactivation of Tem1 by Bfa1/Bub2 requires that Tem1 is free to exchange between the SPB and the cytoplasm to meet its GAP. This process is no longer possible when Tem1 is tethered to the SPB. The effect of Tem1 tethering would be expected to be particularly strong in cells with mispositioned spindles, where Kin4 promotes the displacement of Bfa1 and Bub2 from SPBs, explaining why tethering of Tem1 to SPBs efficiently bypasses the telophase arrests of such cells [29].

Another aspect of MEN activity is that it is linked to the proper positioning of the spindle, but how can this occur if the MEN is involved in spindle asymmetry and positioning in the first place? Because the MEN is required for the positioning of the spindle and spindle positioning in turn is required for the MEN’s function in mitotic exit, the MEN and spindle positioning may promote each other to form an auto-amplification loop. Indeed, cortical polarity and spindle position promote the asymmetry of Bub2 and Bfa1 on spindle poles by biasing their localization toward the SPB closest to the bud [50, 57]. The contribution of the cortex to Kar9 asymmetry [58] may also influence this loop. Thus, a correctly aligned spindle can augment Bub2/Bfa1 asymmetry, which could enhance MEN activity and Kar9 asymmetry, thereby locking the spindle in the aligned position. Here, Kar9 asymmetry, spindle positioning, and MEN activity emerge as a large positive-feedback loop to ensure that MEN activity is highest, and the cell competent for mitotic exit only when the spindle is correctly positioned and locked. The fact that Nud1 phosphorylation is not observed in metaphase cells [44] may appear to contradict the hypothesis that Tem1 and the MEN are active at that time. However, our model predicts that MEN activity remains low until late metaphase, possibly explaining the difficulty to pick up phosphorylation on the SPBs at this stage. Furthermore, we still know little about the contribution of phosphatases in controlling MEN output [59].

Reconciling the roles of the MEN before and after anaphase

If the MEN is already active before anaphase, how do cells prevent premature mitotic exit until anaphase completion? Several converging mechanisms may ensure that the ultimate consequence of MEN activation, namely Cdc14 release and mitotic exit, is restrained until late anaphase. Evidence shows that Dbf2 kinase activity is just at or below detection level by classical biochemical methods in metaphase-arrested cells, but high in late anaphase cells [7, 28]. Thus, a limited amount of MEN activity may be sufficient to regulate spindle orientation and mRNA stability in metaphase, but insufficient to promote mitotic exit (Figure 3A). Furthermore, certain regulators of mitotic exit, such as Lte1 and Kin4, have no effect on spindle positioning in metaphase [30]. Thus, these proteins might specifically control the increase in MEN activity observed during anaphase, which may be required for mitotic exit. In addition, the role of Cdc5 in Cdc15 recruitment to SPBs and activation of Dbf2/Mob1 may serve to amplify MEN activity on both SPBs specifically during late anaphase rather than truly initiating MEN activation (Figure 2) [28, 44]. Therefore, the separation between MEN function

Supporting this idea, Cdc14 plays little or no role in the context of spindle orientation during metaphase [30], suggesting that MEN activity might be unable to promote Cdc14 release from the nucleolus as long as Cdk1 activity is high. To provide further support that high Cdk1 activity prevents MEN function and Cdc14 activation, the Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) pathway and activity of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) are both required for progression toward mitotic exit [48,61,62]. Two studies showed that Cdc14 is released from the nucleolus in a MEN-dependent manner in the presence of non-degradable cyclin Clb2 [63,64], suggesting that mitotic exit can be induced in the presence of high Cdk1 activity. However, the expression of the mitotic inhibitor Sic1 is likely to ensure a transient reduction of Cdk1 activity in these cells. Furthermore, under these conditions, Cdc14 release from the nucleolus exhibits an oscillatory behavior and the period of these oscillations depends on the level of Clb2 protein in these cells: high Clb2 levels promote rapid reentry of Cdc14 into the nucleus. Thus, Cdk1 appears to counteract the effect of the MEN on Cdc14 release. Furthermore, the idea that Cdk1 inhibits MEN-dependent release of Cdc14 could explain why cells with a hyperactivated MEN, owing to Cdc15 fusion to the SPB, do not prematurely exit mitosis, despite prematurely reaching high Dbf2 kinase activity [28]. Also, when Tem1 is fused to the SPB, inactivation of Clb2 results in increased cell toxicity [29], possibly due to premature mitotic exit. Therefore, reduced Cdk1 activity at anaphase onset may be required for MEN-dependent release of Cdc14 and progression toward mitotic exit.

Collectively, it seems probable that the temporal separation between early and late MEN function is achieved through spatial regulation (Figure 3C). Events leading to Cdc14 release occur in the nucleus, whereas most pre-anaphase functions reported for both the MEN and the homologous SIN pathway occur in the cytoplasm [30,31,33,36,37]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that some regulation of MEN output could be required for the entry of Dbf2 into the nucleus and that preventing MEN proteins from reaching their nuclear targets may avert mitotic exit. For example, the entry of Dbf2 into the nucleolus might be inefficient overall, which would explain the need for high Dbf2 activity for Cdc14 release. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Dbf2-Mob1 by Cdk1 might inhibit their entry into the nucleus until their dephosphorylation in anaphase.

For all these models, the involvement of Cdk1 in the control of the MEN appears to be crucial. Cdc15, Dbf2, and Mob1 were all identified as potential substrates of Cdk1 [60,65–68] and full activation of the MEN requires the dephosphorylation of Cdc15 and Mob1 [60,65]. At least for Cdc15, phosphorylation by Cdk1 correlates with the asymmetric distribution of the protein between the SPBs [67]. In addition, studies on the homologous SIN in fission yeast suggest a role for Cdk1 in the control of SIN protein localization and activity [69]. Together, these studies indicate that regulation of MEN and SIN activity and their asymmetry depends on Cdk1. Thus, Cdk1 is a promising candidate for bridging the early and late functions of the MEN.

Concluding remarks

Although recent progress has yielded important insights into the mechanisms regulating mitotic exit, more questions than answers have been revealed. Little is known about where and when Tem1 and the MEN are active, but recent progress suggests that MEN activity is not restricted to late anaphase. These novel insights allow us to move toward a more integrated and complete view of the regulation of mitotic exit and discuss models and ideas that were previously not evident.

Many questions regarding MEN activation appear to converge on the SPB component Nud1. This centriolin-related protein is classically regarded as a scaffolding factor. However, evidence indicates that this scaffold forms a central platform to integrate several signals that control MEN function and other processes. Nud1 controls the timely recruitment of Cdc15 and Mob1 to SPBs, as a trigger for mitotic exit [28,44]. The effect of Nud1 inactivation on spindle orientation and SPB inheritance is more severe than the effect of MEN inactivation [30]. In addition, if Nud1 plays a central role in SPB specification, it must be able to distinguish between the new and old SPB, but how this differentiation is achieved remains unknown. It may be possible that during metaphase, when Bub2 and Bfa1 are most active and spread throughout the cytoplasm, the GTPase Tem1 is active only near its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which would then be expected to be on the new SPB. Nud1 may be an excellent candidate to fulfill this function, provided that it is somehow counteracted on the old SPB; for example, through Bub2 and Bfa1 binding. Later, when Bub2 and Bfa1 have been sequestered during anaphase, the high intrinsic exchange activity of Tem1 [51,70] might become sufficient to be GEF independent. Therefore, dissecting Nud1 function and regulation in more detail will be crucial in future investigations.

These discussions underline the fact that no methods are available to probe the activity of Tem1, Cdc15, and Dbf2/20 *in situ*, and therefore all the ideas we have about where and when these molecules are active are products of speculation. It will be essential to develop functional imaging methods to fill this gap and to stabilize the ground for future discussions and progress.

Lastly, what we learn about Nud1 and MEN regulation is likely to reveal how similar processes may be regulated by Nud1/centriolin and the Hippo pathway in other eukaryotes and particularly in stem cells, which segregate their centrosomes in a non-random manner similar to yeast [71–73]. Therefore, MEN studies may provide insight beyond mitotic exit and may reveal new understandings about self-renewal, cellular patterning [74], cell proliferation, and organogenesis.
