Abstract

The cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway is one of the major players in the regulatory activity of growth and hormonal secretion in adrenocortical cells. Although its role in the pathogenesis of adrenocortical hyperplasia associated with Cushing's syndrome has been clarified, a clear involvement of the cAMP signaling pathway and of one of its major downstream effectors, the protein kinase A (PKA), in sporadic adrenocortical adenomas remained elusive until recently. During the last year, a report by our group and three additional independent groups showed that somatic mutations of PRKACA, the gene coding for the catalytic subunit α of protein kinase A (PKA), are a common genetic alteration in patients with Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal adenomas, occurring in 35-65% of the patients. In vitro studies revealed that those mutations are able to disrupt the association between catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA, leading to a cAMP-independent activity of the enzyme. Despite somatic PRKACA mutations are a common finding in patients with clinical manifest Cushing's syndrome, the pathogenesis of adrenocortical adenomas associated with subclinical hypercortisolism seems to rely on a different molecular background. In this review, the role of cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in regulation of adrenocortical cell function and its alterations in cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenomas will be summarized, with particular focus on recent developments.

Introduction

The cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in regulation of metabolism, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in endocrine tissues. A major effector of cAMP is protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates a number of substrates, including cytosolic and nuclear targets, most notably transcription factors of the CREB/ATF family². Activation of the cAMP pathway causes both increased function and replication of several endocrine cells, including those of the adrenal cortex². Thus, alterations of this pathway have been found in different endocrine diseases. Loss-of-function mutations are responsible for syndromes of hormone resistance like pseudohypoparathyroidism³ or TSH resistance⁴. Conversely, mutations leading to constitutive activation of this pathway lead to tumor development and hormone excess, as in the case of thyroid adenomas or GH- secreting pituitary adenomas⁵⁻⁷.

Under normal condition, adrenocortical cells are under the tight control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which signals via the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) located in high abundance on the surface of adrenocortical cells. Activation of the MC2R, which is coupled to the stimulatory Gs protein, leads to an increase of the intracellular concentration of cAMP and activation of PKA, ultimately stimulating glucocorticoid production. Whereas the role of ACTH in stimulating the proliferation of adrenocortical cells remains a matter of investigation, in vitro data, animal models and, most importantly, a number of human genetic defects clearly demonstrates the central role of the cAMP/PKA pathway in the pathophysiology of adrenal hyperplasia and hypercortisolism. In contrast to familial forms of adrenal Cushing's syndrome, the pathogenesis of the much more frequent cases of sporadic, unilateral

73 cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas had remained largely obscure. Recently, we and three
74 additional independent groups have identified a high frequency (35-65%) of somatic
75 mutations affecting the catalytic alpha subunit of PKA (PRKACA) in cortisol-secreting adrenal
76 adenomas<sup>8-11</sup>. In this review, we provide an overview on the role of cAMP/PKA in the control
77 of adrenocortical cell function and its alterations in Cushing's syndrome, with a particular
78 focus on recent developments.

80 Clinical spectrum of adrenal Cushing's syndrome
81 Endogenous hypercortisolism associated with unilateral adrenocortical adenomas is the
82 most common form of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome, occurring in almost one third
83 of patients with overt Cushing's syndrome<sup>12</sup>. The clinical picture of patients with Cushing's
84 syndrome is characterized by severe comorbidities and adverse events, due to the effect of
85 the excessive cortisol production. Given that the glucocorticoid receptor is widespread
86 expressed among almost all tissues, the effects of cortisol hypersecretion inevitably involve
87 many organ systems. The classic clinical picture of a patient affected by Cushing's syndrome
88 is characterized by easy bruising, facial plethora, proximal muscle weakness, striae rubrae,
89 and hirsutism (Table 1)<sup>13</sup>. In addition, hypertension is a very common feature of the
90 syndrome, occurring in 80% of the patients, and is characterized by drug-resistance in up to
91 17% of cases and by loss of nocturnal dipping<sup>14-16</sup>. Alterations of glucose and lipid
92 metabolism are also common findings in patients with Cushing's syndrome. All those co-
93 morbidities, together with the typical hypercoagulable state due to alterations of clotting
94 factors<sup>17</sup>, severely impair the cardiovascular profile of patients with Cushing's syndrome,
95 leading to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality, if left untreated<sup>18,</sup>
96 <sup>19</sup>. Considering that the cardio-metabolic impairment in those patients is often associated

with increased rate of severe infectious complications²⁰, increased incidence of osteoporotic

fractures, and psychiatric disorders²¹, it is clear that patients with Cushing's syndrome are

characterized by a life-threatening disease that requires a precise causative diagnosis and a

rapid therapeutic strategy. A comprehensive review on the complications of Cushing's

syndrome and their treatment has been recently published elsewhere¹⁹ and is beyond the

scope of this review.

The term subclinical hypercortisolism has been commonly used in the last years to define a

condition of hypercortisolism, detected by hormonal alterations of the HPA axis, in patients

without a clear phenotype recalling that of Cushing's syndrome. By definition, subclinical

hypercortisolism is diagnosed in patients with incidentally-discovered adrenal tumors.

Therefore, in the last years, subclinical hypercortisolism has been used for patients who fulfil

the criteria neither for Cushing's syndrome nor for non-secreting tumors. In the last decades,

the study of subclinical hypercortisolism is gaining more interest because of the increasing

number of cases reported in a non-negligible subset of patients with adrenal incidentalomas

(up to 30%)²², which are discovered in a relatively large number of subjects (up to 4% in

radiological series)²³.

The clinical picture of patients with subclinical hypercortisolism is characterized by several

co-morbidities, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia (Table 1), but also by

clinically relevant outcomes, mainly osteoporotic vertebral fractures, cardiovascular diseases

and related mortality. Several cross-sectional studies have highlighted that glucocorticoid-

induced osteoporosis (GIO) and its related complications indeed occur also in patients with

subclinical hypercortisolism²⁴-²⁹. Moreover, three recent retrospective studies showed also a

role for mild cortisol hypersecretion in the development of cardiovascular diseases in

patients with subclinical hypercortisolism³⁰, ³¹. Indeed, the incidence of cardiovascular

diseases was higher in those patients with respect to their non-secreting counterpart and
the increase in cortisol levels over time was independently associated with the risk of
cardiovascular events. Similarly, the survival rate was lower in patients with subclinical
hypercortisolism, when compared to non-secreting adrenocortical adenomas<sup>31</sup> and to the
general population<sup>32</sup>, due to an increased cardiovascular mortality and infectious
complications.
In summary, while the clinical spectrum of adrenal-dependent hypersecretion of cortisol is
wide, it has become quite clear that in most instances adrenal hypercortisolism represents a
relevant clinical problem.

Role of cAMP/PKA signaling in adrenocortical cells

The second messenger cAMP and its effector PKA are key regulators of virtually all cellular
functions, such as growth and differentiation, and mediate the effects of several hormones
and neurotransmitters that signal via GPCRs. The discovery of this pathway represented
fundamental milestones in cell biology, which culminated with the assignment of three
Nobel prizes: the first in 1971 to Earl Sutherland for the discovery of cAMP, the second in
1992 to Edmond Fischer and Edwin Krebs for the discovery of PKA and the third in 1994 to
Alfred Gilman and Martin Rodbell for the discovery of G proteins<sup>33</sup>.
PKA is a prototypical serine/threonine kinase and a primary example of allosteric
regulation<sup>34</sup>. The PKA holoenzyme in its inactive form is a tetramer consisting of a dimer of
two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits<sup>34</sup>. There are three known isoforms of C
subunits (Ca, CB, Cy) and four of R subunits (RIa, RIβ, RIIa, RIIβ), each coded by a separate
gene<sup>34</sup>. In addition to the C subunits, also the human protein kinase X (PrKX) can associate
with the R subunits of PKA<sup>35</sup>. The regulatory subunits form homo- or heterodimers via the

docking and dimerization (D/D) domain<sup>34, 36</sup>. This domain is also responsible for the binding  
of A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which tether different PKA isoforms to specific  
subcellular structures<sup>34</sup>. In the inactive holoenzyme an inhibitory sequence derived from each  
R subunit occupies the active site cleft of the corresponding C subunit, behaving as a  
tethered substrate or pseudo-substrate and thus precluding the access of PKA substrates<sup>34</sup>.  
Upon binding of two cAMP molecules to each R subunit, the C subunits are released from  
the holoenzyme and can phosphorylate their targets localized in the cytosol as well as in the  
nucleus<sup>37</sup>. In adrenocortical cells, this leads to an acute stimulation of glucocorticoid  
synthesis as well as to a later, transcriptional induction of steroidogenic enzymes and genes  
involved in cell replication<sup>38, 39</sup> (Figure 1).  

Genetic defect associated with adrenal Cushing's syndrome  

A number of genetic defects in the cAMP/PKA pathway have been associated with adrenal  
diseases<sup>40</sup>. The first defect was identified in patients affected by the McCune-Albright  
syndrome, characterized by bone fibrous dysplasia, café au-lait skin spots and  
hypersecretion from different endocrine glands. These patients were found to carry mosaic,  
activating mutations in the gene coding for the Gα<sub>s</sub> protein (GNAS)<sup>41</sup>. A minor fraction of  
McCune-Albright patients develop Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal hyperplasia<sup>42</sup>. A  
second genetic defect involves the gene coding for the RIα subunit of PKA (PRKAR1A).  
PRKAR1A mutations are responsible for Carney complex, another multiple endocrine  
neoplasia syndrome, characterized by the presence of primary pigmented nodular  
adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), cutaneous and neuronal tumors, cardiac myxomas, as well  
as characteristic pigmented lesions of the skin and mucosae<sup>43</sup>. These mutations cause a  
reduced expression of the RIα subunits or impair its association with C subunits, thus leading

to constitutive PKA activation⁴⁴. More recently, inactivating mutations in the genes coding  
for two phosphodiesterases (PDE8 and PDE11A), which are responsible for the degradation  
of cAMP, have been shown to predispose to the development of adrenal hyperplasia⁴⁵-⁴⁸.  
Considering the importance of the impairment of the cAMP/PKA pathway in the  
development of adrenal hyperplasia associated with cortisol hypersecretion, the study of  
those alterations have been extended also to sporadic adrenocortical tumors. Indeed,  
somatic mutations of GNAS⁹⁻¹¹, PRKAR1A⁴⁹ and PDE8B⁴⁷ have been found also in sporadic  
adrenocortical adenomas associated with cortisol hypersecretion. However, those mutations  
were able to explain only a small number of cases and the molecular pathogenesis of these  
tumors, which represent a relevant cause of Cushing's syndrome, had remained until  
recently largely obscure.  

PRKACA mutations  

With the aim of identifying the underlying genetic alterations, our groups recently  
performed whole exome sequencing in sporadic cortisol-secreting adrenocortical  
adenomas⁸. We found two mutations in the gene coding for the Ca subunit of PKA (PRKACA)  
in about 30% of the tumors⁸. All mutated adenomas were associated with overt Cushing's  
syndrome⁸. The more frequent of the two mutations (p.Leu206Arg) resulted in the  
substitution of a leucine residue at position 206 with arginine; the second mutation  
(Leu199_Cys200insTrp) caused insertion of a tryptophan residue between the amino acid  
199 and 200⁸. Functional experiments revealed that both mutations caused constitutive PKA  
activation (i.e. PKA activation in the absence of cAMP), thus providing a molecular  
explanation for the development of cortisol-secreting adrenocortical adenomas⁸. These  
findings were confirmed by three independent studies by other groups, as summarized in  

Table 2<sup>9-11</sup>. In a subsequent targeted analysis of the PRKACA gene, we have identified two novel mutations (p.Cys200_Gly201insVal in three adenomas and p.Ser213Arg + p.Leu212_Lys214insIle-Ile-Leu-Arg in one)<sup>50</sup>.

All the mutations found in cortisol-secreting adrenocortical adenomas involve amino acids that reside on the surface of the C subunit and are located at the interface with the R subunit<sup>8</sup>. By analyzing the solved X-ray crystal structure of the mouse RIIB-Ca-holoenzyme<sup>37</sup>, we predicted that both originally identified mutations might interfere with the association with the R subunit, thus rendering the Ca subunit constitutively active<sup>8, 50, 51</sup>.

Indeed, Leu206 is part of the active site cleft of the Ca subunit and participates in forming a hydrophobic pocket<sup>8, 51</sup>. This hydrophobic pocket is responsible for substrate binding and recognition as well as for the interaction with the inhibitory sequence of the R subunit. Therefore, we predicted that the substitution of Leu206 with a bulky and positively charged amino acid such as arginine would lead to steric hindrance between the side chain of this amino acid and residues Val115 and Tyr228 of the regulatory subunit<sup>8, 51</sup> (Figure 2). This prediction has been very well confirmed by a recent X-ray structure of the Leu206Arg mutant<sup>52</sup>.

Similarly, residues Leu199 and Cys200 are located next to Thr198, which is part of the so-called “activation loop” and is phosphorylated during the synthesis of the Ca subunit<sup>8, 34, 51</sup>. This region of the C subunit is oriented parallel to the inhibitory sequence of the R subunit. Importantly, residues Gly201 and Leu199 are involved in main-chain hydrogen bonding interactions with residues Val115 and Ala117 of the R subunit. Thus, we predicted that an insertion of an additional amino acid at this position might also interfere with the interaction between the R and C subunits<sup>8, 51</sup>.

Finally, although the two subsequently identified mutations do not affect amino acids that directly interact with the R subunit, it is likely that they might also indirectly interfere with the formation of a stable PKA holoenzyme. The first of these mutations (p.Cys200_Gly201insVal) involves a region that is oriented in parallel to the inhibitory loop of the R subunit. The insertion of a valine residue at this position likely results in a bulging out of this area, which might hamper the binding of the R subunit. Similarly, Leu212 is located on the surface of the Ca subunit in a region that protrudes like a “tip” into the R subunit. The insertion of several residues at this position as in the case of the second mutation (p.Ser213Arg+p.Leu212_Lys214insIle-Ile-Leu-Arg) likely leads to an enlargement of this tip, thus also possibly impairing the association between C and R subunits.

### Mechanism of PKA activation by PRKACA mutations

Although several studies have found activating PRKACA mutations—above all the Leu206Arg variant—with a similarly high frequency in cortisol-secreting adrenocortical adenomas, different mechanisms of action have been hypothesized for these mutations. Thus, we have performed a detailed functional characterization of both PRKACA mutations (p.Leu206Arg and Leu199_Cys200insTrp) identified in our initial study. In vitro experiments, including co-immunoprecipitation assays, chromatography and real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, revealed that both mutations largely abolished the association with the R subunits. This was associated with high PKA activity irrespective of the cAMP concentration. In spite of this, the maximal PKA activity of both mutants did not differ from that of the wild-type Ca subunit. Importantly, by performing FRET experiments in living cells transfected with fluorescently labeled C and R subunits, we could demonstrate that both mutations were interfering with the formation of

a stable PKA holoenzyme and caused loss of regulation by cAMP also in intact cells<sup>51</sup>. These

findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the constitutive activation of PKA caused by

PRKACA mutations, and thus for the development of cortisol-secreting adrenocortical

adenomas in the presence of these mutations.

Genotype-phenotype correlation and interrelation between subclinical hypercortisolism

and overt Cushing's syndrome

Notably, based on the so far published patient cohorts the presence of PRKACA mutations is

clearly associated with a clinical phenotype of overt Cushing's syndrome<sup>8-11</sup>. Moreover, even

in the subgroup of patients with Cushing's syndrome, carriers of PRKACA mutations were

found to be affected by a more severe endocrine phenotype with higher cortisol secretion at

midnight, following dexamethasone suppression or in 24h urinary collections<sup>8</sup>. On the

contrary, while PRKACA mutations in adrenal adenomas associated with subclinical

hypercortisolism cannot be excluded, they seem to be extremely uncommon.

Studies investigating the natural history of subclinical hypercortisolism published in the last

16 years provide evidence of a low conversion rate towards clinically evident Cushing's

syndrome. A summary of the main studies analyzing the natural history of subclinical

hypercortisolism and its evolution towards overt Cushing's syndrome is provided in Table 3.

This concept raises the hypothesis that the clinical correlates observed in those patients can

be mainly related to the time of exposure to mild hypercortisolism. Although those results

could be biased by the variability in the clinical recognition of the features of the syndrome

among different physicians, it is clear that subclinical hypercortisolism has a slow evolution

in terms of cortisol hypersecretion.

263 Taken together, these clinical observations together with recent findings on the molecular
264 fingerprint of adrenal adenomas support the hypothesis that subclinical hypercortisolism
265 and overt Cushing's syndrome associated with adrenocortical adenomas could in fact
266 represent two distinct pathological entities. It is tempting to speculate that genetic
267 alterations directly causing cortisol hypersecretion—such as PRKACA mutations—result in a
268 severe phenotype, thus leading to timely clinical recognition and tumor removal. In contrast,
269 genetic—or epigenetic—events that lead to mild hormonal excess are found only
270 incidentally or after prolonged clinical courses and only rarely acquire secondary hits that
271 result in overt clinical symptoms.

272 
273 Conclusion
274 The recent application of high-throughput genetic analyses is unravelling the molecular
275 pathogenesis of sporadic cortisol-secreting adrenocortical adenomas, which was until
276 recently largely obscure. Recent studies identified PRKACA mutations as major genetic
277 alterations responsible for the development of these tumors. These data confirm the key
278 role of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in stimulating both the function and the
279 proliferation of adrenocortical cells. They provide insights into the evolution of adrenal
280 hormonal autonomy and may provide the basis for novel approaches to the diagnosis and
281 therapy of adrenal Cushing's syndrome.

510 full-length tetrameric RIIB(2):Ca(2) holoenzyme (Protein Data Bank entry 3TNP). Left, wild-
511 type. Right, predicted structure of the Leu206Arg mutant. Substitution of Leu 206 with a
512 bulky and positively charged Arg residue is predicted to result in steric hindrance with the
513 inhibitory sequence (*) of the R subunit and thus to interfere with the formation of a stable
514 holoenzyme.

### Cushing's syndrome

#### Specific signs
- Easy bruising
- Facial plethora
- Proximal myopathy
- Striae (red-purple, >1 cm wide)
- In children – weight gain with reduced growth velocity

#### Symptoms
- Weight gain, changes in appetite
- Depression, mood changes
- Reduced concentration and memory
- Insomnia, fatigue
- Decreased libido
- Oligomenorrhea
- Recurrent infections

#### Less discriminatory signs and symptoms
- Facial fullness, central obesity
- Buffalo hump, supraclavicular fullness, acne and hirsutism
- Thin skin, poor wound healing
- Peripheral edema

### Subclinical hypercortisolism
