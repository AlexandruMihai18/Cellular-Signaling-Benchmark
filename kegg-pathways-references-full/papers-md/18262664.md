Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) constitute a heterogeneous family of ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission in neurons. They have also been found on non-neuronal cells such as bronchial epithelium and keratinocytes, underscoring the idea that they have functions well beyond neurotransmission. Components of cigarette smoke, including nicotine and NNK [4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone], are agonists of nAChRs. Given the association of tobacco use with several diseases, the non-neuronal nAChR signaling pathway has considerable implications for cancer and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown that α7 is the main nAChR subunit that mediates the proliferative effects of nicotine in cancer cells. As a result, α7 nAChR might be a valuable molecular target for therapy of cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma. Future studies involving the design of nAChR antagonists with improved selectivity might identify novel strategies for the treatment of tobacco-related cancers. Here we review the cellular roles of non-neuronal nAChRs, including regulation of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration, invasion and secretion.

Introduction

Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are prototypic ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission [1]. Neuronal nAChRs are pentameric proteins comprising either combinations of two different types of subunit (α and β) or five copies of the same α subunit symmetrically arranged around a central ion pore [2]. Nine different types of α subunit (α2–α10) and three kinds of β subunits (β2–β4) have been cloned and characterized. The physiological ligand of nAChRs is acetylcholine; however, tobacco components such as nicotine and NNK [4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone] are known to be high affinity agonists of nAChRs [3–5]. Binding of ligands such as acetylcholine, nicotine or NNK induces a conformational change in the receptor that opens the ion channel to transmit signals at neuromuscular junctions in the central and peripheral nervous systems [1]. Charged amino acids line the channel pore and select the ions that pass through the channel [2].

Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of nAChRs on non-neuronal cells both inside and outside the nervous system [6,7]. Historically, the first study involving the proliferative effects of nAChRs reported the effects of nicotine and NNK in lung cancer cell lines [8]. Subsequently, it was found that nicotine stimulates a serotonergic loop in human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [9]. The anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine were first observed in a few SCLC cell lines and were found to be mediated by nicotine-induced release of serotonin [10]. Cigarette smoking is known to be the chief risk factor in lung, pancreatic, colon, gastric and bladder cancers [11,12], suggesting that agents such as nicotine and NNK might function in a receptor-dependent manner and might contribute to the pathophysiology of these diseases [13]. Recent studies have shown that nAChRs can accelerate cell proliferation, tumor invasion and angiogenesis, in addition to conferring resistance against apoptosis [14–18]. As a result, the nicotinic cholinergic signaling network in tumor cells represents a novel molecular target for the therapy of tobacco-related cancers [19].

Here we chronicle the differential distribution of nAChR subunits in normal and cancer cells. The proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of nAChRs in different types of human cancer and the underlying signaling events mediating the pathophysiological effects of nicotine are then highlighted. Lastly, we address the feasibility of α7 nAChR as an emerging target for cancer therapy.

Expression of nAChRs in non-neuronal cells

There is considerable evidence for the expression of nAChR in non-neuronal cells in the nervous system (Box 1), and the reader is referred to several excellent reviews on this subject [1,5,7].

In terms of the expression of nAChRs in non-neuronal cells outside the nervous system, human, mouse and rat normal bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells express various nAChR subunits, as shown by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and immunoblotting (Table 1) [16,20,21]. Immunohistochemical staining, flow cytometry and subcellular fractionation experiments indicate that non-neuronal nAChRs are localized on the membrane of bronchial epithelium and endothelial cells. It must be noted, however, that most of the antibodies used in such studies crossreact with several types of nAChR subunits. Data from many laboratories have demonstrated

Box 1. Expression of non-neuronal cells within the nervous system

There is considerable evidence for the expression of nAChR in non-neuronal cells within the nervous system [56,57], as summarized in Table I. Endothelial nAChRs are involved in regulating ion transport and tight junction function [56,57]. In humans astrocytes, expression of the α7 subunit is downregulated in smokers [58] and upregulated in individuals with Alzheimer's disease [59], leading to the intriguing possibility that nAChRs are involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

Microglia express α7 nAChR [60]: stimulation of α7 nAChR promotes anti-inflammatory pathways and blunts the response of microglia to lipopolysaccharide [60], suggesting that nAChRs have a role in controlling localized brain inflammation. nAChRs are expressed on O2A oligodendrocyte precursors, but are not detectable after the cells are induced to differentiate, suggesting that nAChR expression is developmentally controlled in these cells [7]. Although the physiological functions of nAChRs in O2A oligodendrocyte precursors remain to be fully understood, the emerging data seem to suggest that activation of nAChRs might control migration, survival and differentiation in these cells [7].

that acetylcholine is synthesized by bronchial epithelium, endothelial cells, mesothelial cells, alimentary tract cells, and immune cells among others. These cells have also been found to possess choline acetyltransferase activity [1]. In addition, radioligand binding assays (using radiolabeled cholinergic ligands) and patch-clamp experiments have confirmed the functional properties of ion channels gated by nicotinic ligands. The expression of nAChRs in normal cells is summarized in Table 1 [22,23].

It seems that there is a differential pattern of nAChR expression among non-SCLC (NSCLC) tumors from affected individuals, adjacent matched normal lung tissue and established NSCLC cell lines [24]. Comparison of the expression of nAChR subunits between tumor and matched normal tissue revealed a significant upregulation of the β4 subunit and a concomitant decrease in α4 levels [24]. In addition, NSCLC tumors from nonsmokers have been found to show higher expression of the α6β3 receptor, as compared with those from smokers, in a gender-adjusted manner [24]. In that study, the presence of nAChR subunits was analyzed by RT-PCR and microarray analysis. α7nAChR has been detected in pleural mesothelioma biopsies from affected individuals by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis [19]. The subcellular localization of α7nAChR was not confirmed by immunostaining, and no experiments were done to characterize the functional properties of these nAChRs. Further studies are required to assess whether the nAChRs subunits detected on human NSCLC tumor samples from affected individuals are functional and possess the properties of ion channels gated by nicotinic ligands.

Previous studies have shown that lung cancer cell lines also express diverse nAChR subunits (Table 2) [15,16,24]. Robust levels of α7nAChR have been detected in human mesothelioma and colon carcinoma cells [19,25]. An important point is that the nAChRs expressed on most of the cancer cell lines have not been functionally characterized, unlike the nAChRs expressed on normal cells. Future studies will need to define the functional properties of nAChR subunits expressed on cancer cell lines and human tumors; this point is especially important because nAChR-based therapeutic strategies are being considered for lung cancers and mesotheliomas.

Nicotine can induce angiogenesis and atherogenesis by binding to nAChRs on endothelial and smooth muscle cells [12]. In addition, nAChR subunits have been detected in muscle tissue, placenta, and cells of the immune system such as thymus, lymphocytes, mast cells and macrophages (for excellent reviews, see [1,7,12,13]). The emerging picture is that non-neuronal nAChRs play a vital role in

TRENDS in Pharmacological Sciences

Figure 1. Highly simplified diagram of selected nAChR proliferative signaling pathways in cells. (a) Quiescent cells lack an association among $\beta$-arrestin, Src and nAChRs. Rb is hypophosphorylated and associated with E2F transcription factors on proliferative promoters. (b) Binding of nicotine to nAChRs induces the formation of an oligomeric complex, involving $\beta$-arrestin, Src and nAChRs, that facilitates the activation of Src. This activation triggers the MAP kinase pathway and induces binding between Rb and Raf-1, and multimeric complexes containing E2F, Rb and Raf-1 occupy proliferative promoters. Sustained mitogenic signaling leads to the dissociation of Raf-1 and Rb, leaving free E2F1 on proliferative promoters, leading to S-phase entry. An alternate mitogenic pathway by nAChR involves an increase in Ca$^{2+}$ influx on nicotine binding, which causes activation of ERK and MEKK1. Subsequently, MEKK1 causes activation of NF-$\kappa$B, which propels cells toward S-phase entry. Abbreviation: $\alpha$-BT, $\alpha$-bungarotoxin; Hex, hexamethonium.

EGFR by CAM kinase II [6,32]. Nicotine has been also found to upregulate the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) in gastric carcinoma cells by stimulating the expression of COX-2. This stimulation of COX-2 triggers tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis through activation of VEGFR-2, which subsequently modulates matrix metalloprotease activity (MMP2 and MMP9) and the expression of plasminogen activators [33]. These results are the first to document a role for MMPs and plasminogen activators in the nAChR signaling pathway.

A study involving the effects of nicotine on cellular phosphatases found that nicotine can promote the inhibitory phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in A549 cells [34]. Loss of PP1 function by phosphorylation decreases levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27$^{Kip1}$, which in turn facilitates cell cycle progression [34]. Nicotine has also been found to enhance the growth of NSCLC cells by inducing the expression of fibronectin and $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin in an $\alpha$7-dependent manner; the fibronectin-inducing effects of $\alpha$7 nAChR are mediated by activation of the ERK and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways [35]. It is interesting to note that upregulation of fibronectin is one of the hallmarks of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Acquisition of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is known to be a key event for the eventual metastasis of tumors; thus, it is tempting to speculate that nicotine can cause this transition and facilitate metastasis in NSCLC.

Nicotine has been shown to stimulate Ca$^{2+}$ influx in SCLC cells, keratinocytes and mesotheliomas. Binding of nicotine to $\alpha$7 nAChRs results in membrane depolarization, the activation of voltage-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels and the release of serotonin [9,10,32]. Future studies are needed to address the important issue of whether the nicotine-induced influx of Ca$^{2+}$ is itself mitogenic in SCLC cells, or whether the nicotine-induced release of serotonin and subsequent activation of the 5-HT1 serotonin receptor are responsible for the proliferative effects of nicotine in SCLC. Most likely, both of these processes occur 'in parallel' or 'in series' or in a combined manner in these cells.

Other pathways underlying nAChR-induced cell proliferation include activation of NF-$\kappa$B, Src, the 5-lipoxygenase pathway [36], Akt, HIF-1$\alpha$ [37,38] and COX-2 [19,26,33]. In mesothelioma cells, binding of nicotine to $\alpha$7 nAChR causes a Ca$^{2+}$ influx that activates the kinases MEKK-1, ERK1/2 and p90$^{RSK}$. Subsequently, MEKK1 activates complexes of the transcription factor NF-$\kappa$B that induce entry into S phase [19]. Nicotine can also activate the MAP kinase pathway and increase levels of Raf-1, ERK1/2 and MEK1 in a $\alpha$7-nAChR-dependent manner [16,19,39]. Long-term treatment of mouse lung epithelial

Review

cells with nicotine has been found to induce S-phase entry through the upregulation of cyclin D1 [40]. Similarly, studies in A549 NSCLC cells have shown that nicotine can induce cell proliferation, through α7 nAChR, in a manner analogous to growth factors (Figure 1). Treatment of A549 cells with 1 μM nicotine (the mean plasma concentration of nicotine in smokers) was found to cause physical interaction of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) with the signaling kinase Raf-1 [16]. This Rb–Raf-1 interaction has been shown to be an important early event in mediating cell proliferation. Furthermore, nicotine has been found to cause the inactivation of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (downstream to the Rb–Raf-1 binding), followed by the dissociation of E2F1 from Rb, thereby facilitating cell growth. Nicotine also promotes binding of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 on proliferative promoters, causing their transcription and entry into S phase [16].

Lastly, the signaling kinase Src has a pivotal role in nAChR signaling in the neuromuscular junction. In NSCLC and colon cancer cells, activation of Src has been found to be indispensable for nAChR-mediated cell proliferation and angiogenesis [14,16]. nAChRs, however, are ion channel receptors and do not have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. This point raises an important question about how Src is activated during nAChR signaling. It has been found that the scaffolding protein β-arrestin-1 binds to Src and activates Src on nicotine stimulation of A549 cells; the oligomeric complex of β-arrestin-1, Src and nAChR is vital for the proliferative effects of nicotine [16].

### Signaling pathways induced by tobacco nitrosamines

The nitrosamines present in tobacco, namely NNK, DEN (N-nitrosodiethyamine) and NNN (N′-nitrosonornicotine), can bind to nAChRs with high affinity. NNK has been found to be a high-affinity agonist for α7 nAChRs, whereas NNN binds to epabidine-sensitive nAChRs. DEN has been shown to bind to both types of nAChR with lower affinity [41,42].

Long-term exposure to NNK has been found to induce lung tumors in A/J mice [4]. NNK and NNN can also cause malignant transformation of immortalized Het-1A oral epithelial cells through the upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the oncoprotein Bcl-2 [43]. In addition, NNK and NNN stimulate distinct signaling pathways in BEP2D bronchial epithelial cells by means of α7 nAChR [44], whereas NNK causes activation of the transcription factors GATA-3, NF-κB and STAT-1, NNN predominantly activates GATA-3 and STAT-1 [44]. Moreover, NNK has been found to promote Ca²⁺ influx, to release serotonin and to activate both protein kinase C (PKC) and the MAP kinase pathway to stimulate the proliferation of SCLC cells [42,45].

### Nicotine-induced angiogenesis

Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, is a crucial process for tumor growth and metastatic dissemination [46]. Nicotine has been shown to induce both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis [12,20]. In addition, hypoxia and ischemia have been shown to upregulate and sensitize α7 nAChR in endothelial cells [20]. The nicotinic receptors play a fundamental part in signaling networks involving tumor angiogenesis, the immune system and the cardiovascular system. Owing to space constraints, however, we cannot provide an overview of nAChR function in these systems here (for excellent reviews, see Refs [12,47]).

Overall, recent data on the nAChR-induced proliferative pathways highlight the pivotal role played by these receptors in regulating multiple cellular cascades in non-neuronal cells.

#### nAChR and survival pathways

Nicotine has been shown to confer resistance against apoptosis induced by extracellular stress stimuli such as opioids, UV radiation, Ca²⁺ ionophores, neurotoxins, oxidative stress and anticancer drugs. Nicotine has been shown to protect SCLC, NSCLC, breast cancer, oral cancer, and head and neck cancer cells against the apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs [15,18,31]. Nicotine can also confer resistance to apoptosis on normal cells such as NHBE cells, airway epithelial cells, endothelial cells, human gingival fibroblasts and renal epithelial cells [31]. Nicotine has been found to confer protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis in rat models [31]. In addition, nicotine suppresses apoptosis in the ventromedial and lateral oculomotor complex of chick embryos [31].

**Figure 2.** Model summarizing some of the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways underlying nAChRs. Nicotine binds to nAChRs (or β-adrenergic receptors?) and causes phosphorylation of Bad and Bax, thereby inactivating them and preventing cell death. Nicotine can also induce phosphorylation and activation of Bcl-2, promoting cell survival. In NSCLC cells, nicotine has been shown to induce XIAP and survivin to confer resistance to apoptosis against chemotherapeutic drugs. The Akt pathway, PKC, PKA and the MAP kinase pathway play a vital part in mediating these signaling cascades.

Review

Several groups have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-apoptotic activity of nicotine (Figure 2). Nicotine has been shown to regulate the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic proteins. It can protect H82 SCLC cells against cisplatin-induced apoptosis by inducing the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser70, causing its activation by the phospholipase C pathway [31,48]. The apoptotic activity of nicotine is mediated by α3- and α4-containing nAChRs in NHBE cells and involves activation of the Akt pathway [21]. Furthermore, the data show that nicotine can induce site-specific phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473. Nicotine has also been shown to cause phosphorylation of downstream Akt substrates such as mTOR, FKHR, elf-4, GSK3β, tuberin and S6K [21].

Other pathways underlying the anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine include activation of PKC, PKA and NFκB, and downregulation of the tumor suppressor p53 [31,49]. Nicotine induces multisite phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, thereby causing its inactivation and preventing cell death. Nicotine-induced phosphorylation of Bad (at Ser112, Ser136 and Ser155) is mediated by the PKC, PKA, MEK and PI3K signaling pathways [17]. Most interestingly, Jin *et al.* [17] have shown that nicotine-induced phosphorylation is mediated by β-adrenergic receptors. Their study was the first to report that the anti-apoptotic effect of nicotine is mediated by β-adrenergic receptors; however, the concentration of the β-adrenergic antagonist propanalol used was higher than the level usually applied to block the receptor [17,31]. It has been demonstrated that nicotine can induce phosphorylation of Bax at Ser184 (through PKCζ), thereby inactivating Bax and suppressing cell death [49,50].

The role of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) in the anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine has been studied in NSCLC cell lines. Nicotine can protect A549 NSCLC cells against apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs through the upregulation of XIAP and survivin in an α3-nAChR-dependent manner [15]. Controversy exists about the specific nAChR subunit responsible for the anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine. Data from some laboratories have implicated the dihydro-β-erythroidine-sensitive α3 or α4 receptors in the survival effects of nicotine [15,21]; this finding implies that the proliferative effects (mediated by α7nAChR) and pro-survival effects (mediated by α3 or α4 nAChR) of nicotine are mediated by two distinct classes of receptors. By contrast, α7nAChR and the β-adrenergic receptor have been found to mediate the anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine in some cell lines [19,51,52]. Such discrepancies can be partially explained by the somewhat pleiotropic nature of nAChR subunit inhibitors. It is also possible that the anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine are mediated by different nAChR subunits in a tissue-specific manner. These possibilities underscore the need for further rigorous studies to fine-map accurately the nAChR subunits responsible for the anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine in non-neuronal cells.

Previous studies have shown that nicotine can abrogate opioid-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines by ablating the downregulation of PKC induced by opioids. An intriguing recent finding is that nicotine can manifest simultaneous genotoxic and anti-apoptotic effects in gingival fibroblasts through nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species [31].

Owing to space considerations, we cannot describe the anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine on immune cells and endothelial cells. Of interest, however, considerable research shows that nicotine can induce apoptosis in some cells under specific conditions [31]. These studies have been described in detail elsewhere (for excellent reviews, see Refs [6,31,41]).

The identification of functional nAChRs in bronchi, blood vessels and oral epithelium raises the possibility that these receptors mediate some of the toxic effects associated with tobacco use. Several convergent studies have speculated that tobacco toxicity in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems might be facilitated or even triggered by binding of nicotine to nAChRs on target cells [30,53]. The α3β2 nAChR mediates tobacco toxicity through the p21, Bcl-2, NF-κB and STAT-1 pathways [54]. By contrast, α7nAChR mediates the toxic effects of tobacco in oral keratinocytes through activation of the MAP kinase and JAK/STAT pathways [55]. Gene expression profiling has been done to compare and contrast the genes regulated by environmental tobacco smoke and those regulated by pure nicotine in human oral keratinocytes [53]. This study found that both nicotine and environmental tobacco smoke produce a several-fold increase in the levels and transcriptional activity of the survival factor NF-κB in an α7-nAChR-dependent manner [53].

Concluding remarks and future perspectives

Smoking constitutes a key risk factor for diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. In particular, smoking is associated with 90% of SCLC and 60% of NSCLC cases. Nicotine, the principal active component of cigarettes, has been found to act through nAChRs on non-neuronal cells to facilitate tumor growth and survival. Clinical studies have shown that individuals with lung cancer who quit smoking before chemotherapy show a better response than those who continue to smoke throughout chemotherapy. The mitogenic and pro-survival effects of nAChRs possibly provide a molecular mechanism for these observations. From the standpoint of both novel growth factor signaling and the established role of tobacco use in diseases, nAChR signaling in non-neuronal cells has huge implications for cell fate and survival. Research in nAChR signaling networks will be especially relevant to individuals exposed to nicotine supplements such as patches and gums.

Future studies will need to define both the function of different nAChR subtypes in non-neuronal cells and the downstream signaling pathways that underlie the proliferative and anti-apoptotic activities of nicotine. The issue of whether agents such as nicotine and NNK act through nAChRs or β-adrenergic receptors or both, and whether this process is controlled in a cell-specific manner needs to be addressed in a rigorous manner, especially in relation to drug discovery because α7nAChR is emerging as a viable drug target in oncology. The potential side-effects of nAChR-based drug therapy on the brain and central nervous system remain, however, to be accurately ascertained. The development of specific, potent nAChR analogs will shed light on nAChR signaling pathways

and will facilitate the design of new anticancer drugs for
the therapy of tobacco-related cancers.

Free journals for developing countries

The WHO and six medical journal publishers have launched the Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative, which enables nearly 70 of the world’s poorest countries to gain free access to biomedical literature through the internet.

The science publishers, Blackwell, Elsevier, Harcourt Worldwide STM group, Wolters Kluwer International Health and Science, Springer-Verlag and John Wiley, were approached by the WHO and the British Medical Journal in 2001. Initially, more than 1500 journals were made available for free or at significantly reduced prices to universities, medical schools, and research and public institutions in developing countries. In 2002, 22 additional publishers joined, and more than 2000 journals are now available. Currently more than 70 publishers are participating in the program.

Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former director-general of the WHO, said that this initiative was “perhaps the biggest step ever taken towards reducing the health information gap between rich and poor countries”.
