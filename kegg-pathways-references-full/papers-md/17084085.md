Epac1 and Epac2 are cAMP-dependent guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors for the small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2, and are known to be important mediators of cAMP signaling. The recent determination of the crystal structure of Epac2 has indicated a mechanism for the activation of the multi-domain Epac proteins. In addition, these proteins have been implicated in various cellular processes such as integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cell–cell junction formation, the control of insulin secretion and neurotransmitter release. In most of these processes, cAMP signaling through protein kinase A (PKA) is also involved, stressing the interconnectivity between Epac- and PKA-mediated signaling.

The discovery of Epac

Hormonal stimulation of many heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors frequently results in the activation of adenylate cyclase and a subsequent increase in cAMP levels. cAMP is a second messenger that has roles in many physiological processes ranging from the regulation of heart rhythm, uptake of water in gut and kidney to memory. Initially, all effects of cAMP were attributed to the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) but two other targets – cAMP-regulated ion channels and Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) – are now known to be involved in mediating cAMP responses. The variants of Epac, Epac1 and Epac2, were discovered during a database search for proteins that could explain the insensitivity of cAMP-induced activation of the small GTPase Rap1 to inhibitors of PKA [1,2]. The same proteins were identified independently as cAMP guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF)-I (Epac1) and cAMPGEFII (Epac2) in a screen for brain-specific genes with second-messenger-binding motifs [3]. Both Epac proteins are GEFs for the small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2. Rap1 has been implicated in the control of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cadherin-mediated cell-junction formation [4,5]. However, in part through the development of a cAMP analog that can selectively activate Epac, several additional functions of Epac have recently been uncovered. Here, I review the mechanism by which cAMP activates Epac1 and Epac2 based on the recently solved crystal structure of Epac2. Furthermore, I highlight recent findings regarding the function of Epac proteins that have led to the appreciation that they are important mediators of cAMP signaling, frequently interconnected with cAMP signaling through PKA.

The structure of Epac proteins

Epac1 and Epac2 are multi-domain proteins that consist of an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic region; Epac2 has an additional N-terminal cyclic-nucleotide-binding (CNB) domain (Figure 1a). Initial studies revealed that a separated catalytic domain of Epac is fully active, indicating that the regulatory domain is auto-inhibitory. This auto-inhibition is repressed by binding of cAMP (Figure 1b). Recently, the full-length structure of Epac2 in the absence of cAMP was determined by X-ray crystallography [6,7]. This revealed a compact structure with the regulatory region covering the catalytic region (Figure 2a). From a comparison with the previously determined structure of Sos (a GEF for the small GTPase Ras) in complex with Ras [8], the binding site of Epac for its Rap ligand is predicted (Figure 2b). In the closed conformation, this predicted binding site is completely covered by the regulatory region, indicating that the inhibition could be by steric hindrance. The features responsible for this closed conformation are the ‘switchboard’ (a pseudo β-sheet between the regulatory and catalytic region) and the ‘ionic latch’ [an ionic interaction between the second CNB domain and the CDC25-homology domain (HD)] (Figure 2c). The structure of an Epac in the presence of cAMP has not yet been determined. However, mutational analysis and comparison with structures from PKA and ion channels suggest a model whereby occupation of the cAMP-binding pocket results in a conformational change that disrupts the ionic latch followed by a reorientation of the second CNB domain towards the switchboard region, enabling the binding of Rap (Figure 2b).

Although the first CNB domain of Epac2 covers the predicted entry site for Rap in the absence of cAMP, its function is still undetermined. This domain does bind cAMP, but with low affinity compared with the second CNB domain. Furthermore, its deletion affects neither auto-inhibition nor the binding of cAMP to the second CNB domain, suggesting that this first CNB domain might not be directly involved in the regulation of Epac2 [2]. The second CNB domain of Epac2 is similar to the single CNB domain of Epac1. The affinity of cAMP for the isolated CNB domain of Epac1 is in the low micromolar range, but the concentration required for half maximal activation (AC₅₀) of Epac1 in vitro is ten times higher than the concentration required for half maximal binding to the isolated cAMP

(a) Domain structure of Epac1 and Epac2, indicating the regulatory region with the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain(s) (CNB) and the catalytic region with the CDC25-homology domain (CDC25HD) responsible for the guanine-nucleotide-exchange activity. The Desheveled-Egl-10-Pleckstrin (DEP) domain is involved in membrane localization, the Ras exchange motif (REM) stabilizes the catalytic helix of CDC25HD and the Ras-association (RA) domain is a protein-interaction motif. The question mark in Epac1 is a region with homology to the RA domain in Epac2 with unknown function.

domain of Epac1 [9]. This indicates that the activation of Epac requires binding energy. Importantly, the AC₅₀ for Epac is higher than the AC₅₀ for PKA [10], implying that PKA is activated at a lower concentration of cAMP than Epac. Indeed, cAMP sensors based on PKA are more sensitive than sensors based on Epac [11]. A difference in cAMP concentration for activation is also observed in vivo where, for instance, the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-induced ERK activation by forskolin, a PKA-mediated event, occurs at a much lower concentration than the activation of Rap1 [12]. This conclusion was recently challenged by results showing that the binding affinity of cAMP for PKA and Epac are similar and, thus, that PKA and Epac should respond similarly to elevated levels of cAMP [13]. However, in vivo support for this observation is currently lacking.

The regulatory domain of Epac also contains a Dishevelled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin (DEP) domain. Deletion of this domain in Epac1 does not affect the regulation of Epac by cAMP, but does result in a more cytosolic localization [2,11]. This suggests that the DEP domain is involved in the localization, most likely through interaction with either a lipid or a membrane protein. The Ras-exchange motif (REM) domain in the catalytic region of Epac is conserved in almost all mammalian GEFs with a CDC25-HD. In Sos, this region is not required for in vitro catalysis but for the stabilization of the catalytic helix [8]. It could be that the REM domain has additional functions,

The two gray spheres indicate the position of the cAMP-binding pocket. The two interaction points of the regulatory region and the catalytic region, the ionic latch and the switchboard, are also indicated. The ionic latch is the ionic interaction between the N-terminal helix bundle of the second CNB domain and the CDC25-HD domain; the switchboard is a pseudo β-sheet connecting the regulatory region with the catalytic region. It is proposed that, upon cAMP binding, the regulatory domain reorientates as indicated by the red arrow to result in the interaction of bound cAMP with a solvent-exposed histidine in the switchboard region [6]. The structure in (c) is rotated relative to that in (a) to indicate the position of the switchboard and ionic latch more clearly.

for instance, by binding to other (regulatory) proteins [14]. For Epac, it is involved in making the connection between the regulatory region and the catalytic region, and is part of the switchboard region (Figure 2c). Between the REM and CDC25-HD domains is a domain with a ubiquitin fold. For Epac2, it has clear features of Ras-association (RA) domains, which are found in several Ras-interacting proteins. Indeed, Epac2 has been found to interact with GTP-bound Ras and, as a consequence, recruits to the plasma membrane [15]. Although the domain is conserved in Epac1, no interaction partner has been identified thus far. It should be noted that the CNB domain of Epac1 can also serve as a protein-interaction domain: it was found to interact with the microtubule-associated protein 1B-light chain 1 [16]. The entire N-terminal region of Epac1 might also serve as a protein-interaction domain because it has been reported that this region directs Epac1 to mitochondria [17].

### 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP as a tool to activate Epac

In the past, the discovery and analysis of cAMP-mediated events has been greatly facilitated by specific drugs that enhance the level of cAMP, particularly forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Commonly, a phosphodies- terase (PDE) inhibitor such as IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) is added to further enhance cAMP levels. An additional approach is the use of cell-permeable cAMP analogs such as 8 Br–cAMP or dibutyryl cAMP. However, when Epac was discovered, protein-specific analogs able to discriminate between the various cAMP targets were needed. A glutamate that interacts with the 2′OH group of the ribose and is essential for high-affinity binding of cAMP to PKA is conserved in all PKAs and ion channels but is not present in Epac1 and Epac2 [18,19]. This prompted investigation into how essential this 2′OH is for Epac binding, and the result is that, in particular, 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP (also known as 007) is a very efficient and highly selective agonist for Epac proteins [18] (Figure 3). Apart from being an Epac-specific ligand, 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP has other characteristics that are unique for Epac1: its AC<sub>50</sub> for Epac1 activation is more than ten times that of cAMP. In addition, the maximal *in vitro* activity of Epac1 in the presence of 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP is threefold that of cAMP [9]. Thus, *in vitro*, 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP functions as a ‘super-activator’ of Epac1. Apparently, 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP drives an equilibrium between the cyclic-nucleotide-bound inactive Epac and cyclic-nucleotide-bound active Epac towards the active conformation. Whether 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP results in a higher level of active Epac *in vivo* compared with cAMP is currently unclear. For instance, using an Epac-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe, the 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP-induced activity is not obviously higher than the forskolin-induced activity [11]. Based on the structure of the cAMP-binding pocket it is predicted that 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP also activates Epac2. Indeed, when 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP is used in cells that express Epac2 specifically, it induces activation of Rap1 [20].

In a similar series of experiments, activators selective for PKA were also developed. This resulted in the discovery of N6-benzoyl–cAMP (6-Bnz–cAMP; Figure 3) as a compound that preferentially activates PKA [21]. Thus, a set of tools is now available to discriminate between Epac and PKA effects. Currently, no pharmacological inhibitors of the Epac proteins are available.

#### The multiple biological functions of Epac

The major catalytic function of both Epac1 and Epac2 is guanine-nucleotide exchange of Rap1 and Rap2 (Figure 4). Originally, Rap1 was identified as a revertant of oncogenic Ras-induced cell transformation but, recently, its role in

**Figure 4.** Interconnectivity between the Epac- and PKA-signaling pathway. After stimulation of a receptor (R) that couples to a stimulatory G protein (Gs), adenylate cyclase (AC) is activated, resulting in the synthesis of cAMP. Both Epac and PKA are activated and both are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, cell-junction formation, secretion and ion channels. Epac proteins function, at least in part, through the activation of Rap proteins. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) degrades cAMP and thus inhibits the signaling pathway. Furthermore, Rap proteins are positively regulated by additional guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and are negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).

integrin-mediated cell adhesion and E-cadherin-mediated
cell-junction formation has received most attention. Rap1
is activated by a large variety of extracellular stimuli, in
part, mediated by the common second messengers calcium,
diacylglycerol and cAMP. Several GEFs for Rap1 have
been identified, including both Epac proteins. In addition,
several Rap-specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)
have been identified that can inactivate Rap1. Down-
stream from Rap1, a variety of effectors have been identi-
fied, most notably scaffold proteins such as AF6 [22], RapL
[23,24], Riam [24], Krit [25], the RacGEFs Vav2 and Tiam1
[26], and Arap3, a RhoGAP and ArfGAP [27]. These effec-
tors have been implicated in the control of cell adhesion
(Riam, RapL), cell–cell junction formation (AF6) and actin
remodeling (for a more detailed discussion, see Ref. [5]).
However, Rap1 and Rap2 might not mediate all effects of
cAMP–Epac. For instance, it has been reported that Epac1
also activates R-ras – a Ras-like small GTPase implicated
in the control of integrin-mediated cell adhesion – in HEK-
293 cells [28]. The sub-sections that follow describe the
current understanding of the roles of the Epac proteins in
the various cellular processes with which they have been
associated.

**Epac in the control of cell adhesion and cell–cell junction
formation**

Because of the role of Rap1 in integrin-mediated cell
adhesion and E-cadherin-mediated cell–cell junction for-
mation, it was anticipated that, in cells that express Epac,
cAMP-induced regulation of these two processes could be
mediated by Epac. Indeed, in Ovcar3 cells, adhesion is
induced by cAMP independent of PKA, and stimulation of
Epac1 activity by 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP treatment results
in increased β1-integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin-
coated dishes [29]. The results of this treatment with 8-
pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP mimic the effects of stimulation of the
β-adrenergic receptor by isoproterenol. Both effects are
abolished by inhibition of Rap [29]. 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP
also increases adhesion of red-blood cells from patients
with sickle cell anemia. However, this adhesion is
mediated by a non-integrin Ig superfamily receptor rather
than by the β1-integrin also expressed in these cells [30].
Whether this effect is mediated by Rap1 is currently
unclear.

The effect of Epac on cell–cell junctions has been
observed most clearly in endothelial cells where junctions
are highly dynamic structures that enable the regulation of
endothelial integrity and permeability. Various stimuli,
including prostaglandins that elevate the level of cAMP,
inhibit cell permeability. This effect is mediated by both
PKA and Epac. Indeed, 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP treatment
has been shown to result in decreased cell permeability due
to junction maturation [31–34]. Importantly, this effect is
completely abolished by RapGAP (which inhibits Rap1)
[32] and by small interfering RNA (siRNA) that inhibit
Epac1 expression [34]. Further studies have revealed that
this Epac effect is probably mediated by the regulation of
vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. Indeed, RapGAP
expression inhibits adhesion of endothelial cells to VE-
cadherin coated plates [32], and inhibition of cell perme-
ability by 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP is lost in VE-cadherin null

cells [34]. In endothelial cells, 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP also
affects the actin cytoskeleton by causing an increase in
cortical actin, possibly mediated by the downregulation of
Rho [31,32]. Interestingly, this effect on the actin cytoske-
leton is also observed in single cells that do not form
junctions [34].

**Epac in insulin secretion**

Peptide hormones released from the gastrointestinal tract
in response to nutrient ingestion (incretins), such as glu-
cagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1), modulate glucose-induced
insulin secretion through cAMP (Figure 5). Inhibition of
Epac2 expression with antisense oligonucleotides or inhi-
bition of Epac2 using a putative dominant negative mutant
of Epac2 (a mutant that is deficient in cAMP binding and
works by competing for an essential Epac2 anchoring site)
inhibits cAMP and GLP1-induced increase in insulin secre-
tion [35]. This finding gave the first indication that Epac, in
this case Epac2, is involved in cAMP-induced modulation
of insulin secretion. This role has since been confirmed
using both cell lines and primary cultures of β-cells,
showing that 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP can enhance glu-
cose-dependent insulin secretion [36,37]. Currently, three
different effects of Epac have been described. First, Epac
might regulate the priming of vesicles, resulting in an
increase in the readily releasable pool of vesicles [35].
Indeed, Epac2 has been found to interact with Rim2, a
Rab3-interacting protein that is involved in docking vesi-
cles to the plasma membrane, and the Rim2-related pro-
tein Piccolo. Furthermore, a dominant negative mutant of
Rim2 or Rim2 antisense oligonucleotides inhibits cAMP-
induced insulin secretion [35,38,39]. This model was
further refined by the observation that the cAMP-induced
PKA-independent effect is completely inhibited in cells
that lack SUR1 [37]. SUR1 is a subunit of the ATP-sensi-
tive K⁺ (K⁺-ATP) channel but, in addition, is supposed to
have an independent role in the exocytosis machinery [37].
Interestingly, Epac2 was found in a yeast two-hybrid
screen using SUR1 as bait [35], which led to the proposal
that a Epac2–SUR1–Rim2 functions in the exocytosis
machinery, perhaps, in part, by regulating chloride chan-
nels [37,40]. Second, Epac2 controls ryanodine-sensitive
calcium channels that are involved in calcium-induced
calcium release from internal stores. This was concluded
from the observation that 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP-induced
release of calcium is inhibited both by ryanodine and a
cAMP-binding mutant of Epac2 [36]. Third, 8-pCPT-
2′OMe–cAMP, but not N6-Bnz–cAMP, inhibits K⁺-ATP
channels [20], perhaps through the reported interaction
of Epac2 with SUR1 [35]. Importantly, a role for Rap
proteins has not been established for any of these pro-
cesses. (For more detailed reviews on this topic see Refs
[40,41].)

**Epac in exocytosis**

cAMP is a known modulator of stimulus-evoked
neurotransmitter release, for example, by stimulating
the recruitment of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic
membrane or the potentiation of exocytosis. Although
PKA is a major player in this process, Epac is also involved
[42–44]. Indeed, both in the giant synapse of the Calyx of

Figure 5. Proposed functions of Epac2 in the regulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Glucose induces the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) by a series of events including the transport of glucose into the cell by the GLUT2 transporter and the subsequent inhibition of ATP-sensitive K⁺ channels. Primed vesicles are triggered by calcium to fuse with the plasma membrane to release insulin, followed by the recruitment of vesicles from the reserve pool to the readily releasable pool (RRP) for more sustained release. Peptide hormones released from the gastrointestinal tract in response to nutrient ingestion (incretins), such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), modulate this process through Epac and PKA by modulating the release of calcium from internal stores. Epac might have at least three different functions in β-cells: (i) cAMP-induced calcium release from internal stores is mediated by Epac through the regulation of ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels (RyR), a process that requires extracellular calcium; (ii) the regulation of vesicle fusion and docking, which might involve Rim2 and Piccolo (two related proteins that associate with Epac and are involved in the secretory process); and (iii) the inhibition of K⁺-ATP channels, which might be mediated by the association of Epac2 to Sur1 (a subunit of K⁺-ATP channels). PKA is also involved in these processes, for instance, by the modulation of the inositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (IP₃)-regulated calcium channels (IP₃R). (For more extensive discussions see Refs [40,41].)

Held (a complex of nerve terminals in the brainstem that supports sound localization) and in crayfish neuromuscular junctions, neurotransmitter release is potentiated by 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP either alone or together with calcium [42–44]. Moreover, in melanotrophs, Epac2 mediates the release of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the neuroendocrine cells of the pituitary gland. In particular, the fusion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles is stimulated by 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP [45].

**Epac in cardiomyocytes**

In neonatal cardiomyocytes, Epac1 inhibits the ERK5 pathway by a mechanism involving Rap1 [46]. This process occurs in a multi-protein complex centered around the 250 kDa muscle-specific A-kinase anchoring protein (mAKAP; Figure 6). A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) bind PKA constitutively and are responsible for the spatial control of cAMP signaling. In this context, the two cAMP-target proteins cooperate in the negative control of cAMP levels: PKA by direct phosphorylation and activation of PDE4D3, and Epac by inhibition of ERK5, which phosphorylates and inactivates PDE4D3 [46]. Because PKA has a higher affinity for cAMP than Epac, Epac might only take effect at higher cAMP levels. One of the biological functions of this mAKAP complex is the control of cytokine-induced, ERK5-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. Indeed, LIF-induced increase in cell size requires mAKAP and ERK5 and is inhibited by 8-pCPT-2′OMe–cAMP [46]. However, it should be noted that hypertrophy, when monitored differently (i.e.

Figure 6. Interconnectivity of PKA and Epac in a cardiomyocyte feedback loop. Cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), activate the ERK5 kinase, which phosphorylates and inactivates phosphodiesterase 4D3 (PDE4D3). This is part of a complex with the muscle-specific A-kinase anchoring protein (mAKAP) and its inactivation leads to a local rise cAMP level, which, in turn, activates PKA and Epac1 in the complex. The activated PKA phosphorylates and activates PDE4D3, which causes the level of cAMP to fall again. The activated Epac1 inhibits ERK5, probably via Rap, and therefore prevents continued inactivation of PDE4D3 by ERK5. This then results in reduced cAMP levels, thus closing the loop. Hence, Epac1 mediates negative feedback of ERK5 [46].

involved in the coordinated contraction of heart muscle cells. cAMP regulates both the accumulation of connexons and the gating. Using both 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP and N6-Bnz-cAMP, it was found that Epac predominantly stimulates the accumulation of connexons, whereas PKA regulates gating. Importantly, 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP also regulates the recruitment of N-cadherin to adherens junctions. Because gap-junction formation is dependent on adherens junctions, the 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP effect on Gap junctions might be indirect [48].

**Other effects of Epac**

Several additional effects of Epac have been described. In the kidney, Epac1 is specifically expressed in the brush-border of proximal tubule cells and, together with PKA, negatively regulates the apically located Na⁺-K⁺ ATPase NHE3 [49]. Epac is also expressed in principal cells of the distal tubules and mediates arginine vasopressin-induced water resorption by stimulation of the translocation of aquaporin 2 to the apical side of the cells [50]. In sperm, Epac is involved in the acrosome reaction [51] and, in rat hepatocytes, Epac modulates glucagon-induced regulation of chloride channels [52]. In nociceptor sensory neurons, which convert mechanical stimuli into pain sensation, stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor sensitizes the response by a process that includes Epac-mediated activation and translocation of protein kinase Cε [53]. In Cos cells expressing the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor, the release of soluble N-terminal ectodomain of the amyloid precursor protein sAPPα is induced by stimulation with 5-HT. This effect is mediated by Epac, Rap1 and the small GTPase Rac, and involves the activation of α-secretases [54,55]. In HEK-293 cells, Epac activates phospholipase Cε specifically through the activation of Rap2b, resulting in Ins(1,4,5)P₃-mediated release of calcium from internal stores [56]. Interestingly, in the same cells, Epac regulates phospholipase D through R-ras [28]. Finally, Epac has been implicated in the control of ERK and protein kinase B in a variety of cell systems. For example, 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP was found to strongly potentiate PKB activation by insulin in muscle cells [57].

**Concluding remarks and future prospects**

Over the past two years, Epac has emerged as an important target of cAMP in a variety of processes, most notably the control of cell adhesion and cell–cell junction formation, exocytosis and the regulation of various ion channels. In most cases, the involvement of Epac has been demonstrated by the insensitivity of the cAMP response to inhibitors of PKA and the capacity to mimic the cAMP response with the Epac-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP. Indeed, to date, 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP seems to be selective for Epac but, as for all pharmacological compounds, side effects cannot be excluded. Additional proof might come from the use of siRNA, which can also be used to discriminate between Epac1 and Epac2. The cAMP-Epac response is frequently intrinsically linked to the cAMP-PKA response. For instance, both Epac and PKA mediate cAMP-induced tightening of cell-cell junctions and enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion. This dual control might enhance the dynamic range of

cAMP signaling: PKA is activated at lower concentrations of cAMP than Epac. A striking example of this interconnectivity is reported for cardiomyocytes, in which PKA and Epac are present in the same multi-protein complex and coordinate a negative feedback loop [46] (Figure 6). This result also indicates that the spatial localization of Epac is a crucial determinant of its function and it is anticipated that, like for PKA, the multiple functions of Epac as, for instance, observed in pancreatic β-cells and in cardiomyocytes, will depend on the localization of Epac.

Epac proteins are GEFs for Rap1 and Rap2, and thus might have a key role in all the responses of cAMP-Epac signaling. This is particularly evident in the control of cell adhesion and cell-junction formation. The involvement of the two Rap proteins is less clear for the function of Epac in insulin secretion or ion-channel regulation and a role for Epac independent of its catalytic activity cannot be excluded. In these latter systems, however, the role of Rap proteins has not yet been addressed rigorously. The challenges ahead are the deciphering of the molecular details of the Epac responses. This will not be simple because most biological effects are most obvious in primary cells or primary-cell cultures and also because the responses are diverse and usually not robust. Thus, it is anticipated that investigating Epac as a mediator of cAMP signaling will keep researchers busy for a while, in the same way that cAMP does a full 50 years after its discovery.
