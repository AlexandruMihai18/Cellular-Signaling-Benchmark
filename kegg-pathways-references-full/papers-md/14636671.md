Abstract

Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are synthesized from arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases, function primarily as autocrine and paracrine effectors in the cardiovascular system and kidney. They modulate ion transport and gene expression, producing vasorelaxation as well as anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effects. EETs are incorporated into the $sn$-2 position of phospholipids and are rapidly mobilized when a cell is treated with a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ionophore, suggesting that they may play a role in phospholipid-mediated signal transduction processes. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) converts EETs to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), and inhibition of sEH is a potential approach for enhancing the biological activity of EETs. EETs also undergo chain-elongation and β-oxidation, and the accumulation of partial β-oxidation products increases when sEH is inhibited. Some functional effects of EETs occur through activation of either the guanine nucleotide binding protein Gas or the Src signal transduction pathways, suggesting that EETs act by binding to membrane receptors. However, other evidence indicates that the modulation of gene expression occurs through an intracellular action of EETs. Because of the diversity of biochemical and functional responses produced by EETs, it is doubtful that a single mechanism or signal transduction pathway can account for all of their actions.

1. Introduction

Three classes of eicosanoid biomediators are synthesized from arachidonic acid; the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 (CYP) products [1]. The CYP class is subdivided into two groups; the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) formed by CYP epoxygenases, primarily the CYP2C and 2J isoforms in humans, and the arachidonic acid derivatives that are hydroxylated at or near the ω-terminus by CYP ω-oxidases, primarily the CYP 4A and 4F isoforms in humans [2,3]. As shown in Fig. 1, CYP epoxygenases produce four EET regioisomers from arachidonic acid; 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET.

Each CYP epoxygenase isozyme produces all four EET regioisomers, but one or two usually are the predominant products. For example, 14,15-EET accounts for 41% of the EETs produced by rat heart CYP 2J3 [4], and 11,12-EET accounts for 58% of the EETs produced by rat kidney CYP 2J23 [5]. These two regioisomers are the predominant EETs produced by many different cells and tissues: for example, they account for 67–80% of the total EETs produced by five purified and reconstituted rat CYP epoxygenases [2]. Each regioisomer consists of a mixture of R,S- and S,R-enantiomers. As a further complication, the enantiofacial selectivity is different for each CYP epoxygenase, and the same isozyme can have a different selectivity for epoxidation at each of the arachidonic acid double bonds [2].

The various types of functional effects produced by EETs are listed in Table 1. EETs are important modulators of cardiovascular function, and they produce these effects by acting primarily on the vasculature and in the kidney [6–8]. They are synthesized in blood vessels by CYP epoxygenases contained in endothelial cells [9], and they produce vasodilation in a number of vascular beds by activating the smooth muscle large conductance Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels (BKCa) [10]. This hyperpolarizes the smooth muscle and produces vasorelaxation, lowering blood pressure [6,8,11]. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that EETs may function as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF) [12], particularly in the coronary circulation [13]. Furthermore, effects of EETs on smooth muscle migration [14], prostaglandin (PG) E₂

production [15], Ca²⁺ influx [16] and aromatase activity [17] have been observed. In the endothelium, EETs inhibit cytokine-induced inflammatory responses [18,19], increase Ca²⁺ entry [20,21], enhance fibrinolysis [22], and stimulate tube formation [23]. Functional effects also occur in other tissues [24–32]. In addition, EET binding to intact cell membranes and to recombinant fatty acid binding protein (FABP) has been observed [31,32].

EETs are enzymatically hydrated to the corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) by epoxide hydrolases [33,34]. This reaction is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows the conversion of 14,15-EET to 14,15-DHET. DHETs were initially thought to be inactivation products of EETs, but several recent studies indicate that, like EETs, they produce vasodilation and activate smooth muscle BKCa channels [35–38]. There are two major epoxide hydrolase isozymes in mammalian tissues; soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) contained primarily in the cytosol [33,34], and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) bound to intracellular membranes [39]. sEH is the main isozyme that acts on the EETs.

Two recent findings in the cardiovascular system have heightened interest in EETs. One is that 11,12-EET appears to be a strong candidate for EDHF in the coronary circulation [13]. The other is that disruption of the sEH gene [40] or inhibition of sEH by N,N′-dicyclohexylurea (DCU), a

This review will focus on the metabolism and biochemical mechanisms of action of EETs. The reader is referred to other recent reviews for in-depth coverage of EET chemistry, physiology and pharmacology [2,3,6–8,11,43,44].

## 2. EET content of tissue and plasma lipids

Animal and human tissue lipids contain EETs. Rat liver phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) contain 70, 85 and 106 μmol EET/mol phospholipid, respectively [45]. These phosphoglycerides contain 8,9-, 11,12- and 14,15-EET, and all of the EETs are esterified at the sn-2 position of the glycerol moiety. Rabbit kidney contains 8,9- and 14,15-EET [46], and human kidney cortex contains 8,9-, 11,12- and 14,15-EET [47]. The enantiomeric structures of the 11,12- and 14,15-EET present in the human kidney are similar to those of the EETs produced by the major human CYP epoxygenases [47], leading to the conclusion that the EETs in tissue lipids are enzymatic products [45,48]. This may not always be the case, however, because the amount of EETs esterified in phospholipids of human red blood cells increases considerably following incubation with t-butyl hydroperoxide. Therefore, the EETs contained in tissue phospholipids also can arise from lipid peroxidation [49].

Rat plasma contains 10.2±0.4 ng/ml EET [48]. The molar ratio of 8,9-, 11,12- and 14,15-EET in the plasma is 2.8:1:3.4, and more than 90% of the EET is contained in lipoprotein phospholipids. The highest concentration is present in low-density lipoproteins, followed by the high- and very low-density lipoproteins. While it is generally assumed that EETs are produced in the tissues where they act, their presence in plasma suggests that they also may be supplied to at least some tissues by the circulation.

## 3. Major pathways of EET metabolism

Most of the detailed information about EET metabolism has been obtained from incubations of cultured mammalian cells with chemically synthesized [1-¹⁴C]EETs or [5,6,8,9,11,12,14, 15-³H]EETs [50,51]. These studies have been done with murine mastocytoma cells [52], porcine and human endothelial cells [50,53,54], porcine arterial smooth muscle cells [15,35,55–57], human skin fibroblasts (HSF) [58] and rat cerebral astrocytes [59].

### 3.1. Incorporation into cells

All of the cell types that so far have been tested rapidly take up radiolabelled EETs when they are added to the culture medium as free fatty acids. It is not known whether the EETs passively diffuse through the cell membrane or require a membrane transporter to enter the cell. The amount taken up by most cells reaches a maximum within 20–60 min. 14,15-EET uptake increases linearly with increasing concentrations up to 5 μM in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) and up to 20 μM in porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (PASMC) [51,55], indicating that the capacity of vascular cells to take up EETs is relatively large. The $K_{\text{m}}$ for 14,15-EET uptake by murine mastocytoma cells is 1.1 μM, and the $V_{\text{max}}$ is 36 pmol/min × 10⁷ cells [52]. Albumin reduces the uptake of 14,15-EET [52], most likely because it binds the EET and reduces the effective concentration available for uptake. After a 2 h incubation with 2.5 μM EET, the comparative uptake by PAEC is 5,6-EET > 8,9-EET = 11,12-EET > 14,15-EET. The uptakes of 5,6- and 14,15-EET are 40 and 75% less, respectively, than the uptake of arachidonic acid [51]. The comparative uptake by PASMC is 8,9- > 11,12- > 14,15-EET [55]. Similarly, astrocytes take up more 8,9-EET than 14,15-EET [59].

### 3.2. Binding to FABP

All of the EET regioisomers bind to cytosolic FABP [32]. Most of the studies have been done with the heart isoform (H-FABP), but liver FABP (L-FABP) and intestinal FABP (I-FABP) also bind EETs. The $K_{\text{d}}$ for binding to H-FABP is between 0.4 and 1.7 μM, and the relative values are 5,6-EET = 11,12-EET < 8,9-EET < 14,15-EET. These $K_{\text{d}}$ values for EET binding are 7–30 times higher than the $K_{\text{d}}$ for arachidonic acid binding, whereas the $K_{\text{d}}$ values for the EETs are 10–40 times lower than those for DHET binding. The relatively weak binding of DHETs may explain why most of the DHET that is formed by cells is released into the extracellular fluid.

These findings suggest that FABP may act as an intracellular transport protein for EETs and target them to specific organelles or enzymes. Such a function would be consistent with the effects of FABPs on the intracellular trafficking and utilization of fatty acids [60,61]. However, whether EETs actually bind to FABP in an intact cell has not yet been determined.

### 3.3. Distribution in cell lipids

When EETs are taken up by PAEC and PASMC, they are incorporated primarily into phospholipids and to a small extent in glycerolipids [51,55]. PC incorporates the largest amount of EETs in these vascular cells [51,57], whereas PE incorporates the largest amount in mastocytoma

cells [52]. As compared with other EETs, a relatively large fraction of the 14,15-EET taken up by PAEC and astrocytes is incorporated into PI [51,59], and a protein kinase C signaling mechanism modulates the incorporation of 14,15-EET in the astrocytes [59]. Studies with acyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthase inhibitors indicate that most of the EET incorporated into phospholipids occurs through a CoA-dependent mechanism [35,59].

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of cell lipids that were radiolabeled with EET indicates that most of the incorporated radioactivity remains as EET [51,54,55,58]. However, a small amount of the EET is elongated to a 22-carbon product, which is recovered from the cell lipids along with very small amounts of radiolabeled DHET and several unidentified radiolabeled compounds [51,53,56]. Although much less extracellular DHET than EET ordinarily is taken up [52], bovine aortic endothelial cells can incorporate small amounts of 8,9-, 11,12- and 14,15-DHET into phospholipids [62]. These DHETs are incorporated mainly into PC.

Treatment of the radiolabeled phospholipids with phospholipase A₂ indicates that 80% of the 14,15-EET incorporated into PI by astrocytes is present in the sn-2 position of the glycerol moiety [59]. This is consistent with the finding that endogenous EETs contained in rat liver phospholipids are present in the sn-2 position [45]. Likewise, almost all of the 14,15-EET incorporated into PI and PC by PAEC, and into PI by PASMC, is contained in the sn-1 position [63]. By contrast, 70% of the 14,15-EET incorporated into PC by PASMC is present in the sn-2 position. This may explain why more 14,15-EET was retained in PASMC than PAEC when these cells were exposed to a Ca²⁺ ionophore [63].

The main phospholipid molecular species that contain EETs in the murine mastocytoma cells are 16:0/EET in PC, 18:0/EET in PI, and 16:1, 18:0 and 18:2/EET in PE [52]. In addition, alkyl ether and plasmalogen species that contain EETs are present in the PC and PE fractions.

### 3.3.1. Structural effects of EET incorporation into phospholipids

It has been suggested that the presence of phospholipids containing EET in the membrane lipid bilayer may affect the physical properties of the membrane and the function of proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer [2]. However, even if a relatively large amount of EET is present, the number of EET acyl chains would be quite small as compared to fatty acyl chains. Therefore, if such structural effects occur, they most likely are localized to only a few lipid domains and affect only the proteins that interact with these domains. Another possibility is that cellular signal transduction systems may be perturbed when EETs are present in membrane phospholipids. This most likely would involve phospholipase-dependent signaling processes that hydrolyze either PI or PC, the phospholipids that ordinarily incorporate the largest amounts of EET.

### 3.3.2. Elimination of EETs from cell lipids

Murine mastocytoma cells eliminate newly incorporated [³H] 14,15-EET under basal conditions with a half-life of 34.9 ± 7 h [52]. The rate of release from the phospholipids is PC > PI > PE. In comparative studies, the mastocytoma cells were found to eliminate newly incorporated EET much faster than arachidonic acid. One possibility is that phospholipids containing esterified EETs are better substrates for phospholipases than those containing arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position. It is also possible that phospholipids containing the EETs are localized to membrane domains that are more readily accessible to activated phospholipases. Another possibility is that

phospholipids containing the EETs may be excluded from incorporation into membranes and are instead targeted to phospholipases for degradation.

The retention of EETs in vascular cells is much less than in the neoplastic mastocytoma cells. PAEC eliminate about 60% of the newly incorporated [1-¹⁴C]14,15-EET in 4 h under basal conditions. The release is largely from PC and PI [51]. Likewise, PASMC labeled with [³H]11,12-EET eliminate 35% of the uptake in 4 h under basal conditions [56]. Thus, EETs are retained for only a relatively short period of time following their incorporation into vascular cell lipids.

### 3.4. Conversion to DHETs

As shown in Fig. 2, the main pathway of EET metabolism in many cells is conversion to DHET by epoxide hydrolases, primarily sEH [33,34,44]. PAEC and PASMC convert all of the EET regioisomers tested to DHETs [51,55], whereas rat astrocytes convert 14,15-EET but not 8,9-EET to DHET [59]. The conversion of 14,15-EET to DHET begins rapidly; for example, [³H]14,15-DHET formation can be detected in PASMC cultures after only 3 min of exposure to [³H]14,15-EET [57]. In PAEC and PASMC cultures, DHET production is not saturated even if the 14,15-EET concentration is as high as 5–10 μM [51,55]. Almost all of the EET that is eliminated from the cell lipids of PAEC and PASMC under basal conditions is recovered in the medium as DHET [51,56].

#### 3.4.1. Function of DHETs

DHETs are generally thought to be inactivation products of EETs [8,44]. Consistent with this view, DHETs have diminished activity in many systems as compared with the four corresponding EETs. These include relaxation of the preglomerular vasculature [64], cyclooxygenase inhibition in PASMC [15], Ca²⁺ uptake by PASMC [16], inhibition of the rat myocardial Na⁺ channel [24], activation of the myocardial ATP-sensitive K⁺ (Kₐₜₚ) channel [25], stimulation of ADP-ribosylation [29], and relaxation of the bovine coronary artery [65]. On the other hand, DHETs produce functional effects in several other systems. For example, DHETs inhibit the hydroosmotic action of arginine vasopressin in the kidney [66], produce relaxation to a similar extent as the corresponding EETs in porcine coronary rings preconstricted with the thromboxane mimetic U-46619 [35,56,57], dilate canine coronary arterioles preconstricted with endothelin [67], and activate the BKCa channel of rat coronary artery myocytes [37]. Thus, DHETs function as biomediators in some systems and are not merely EET inactivation products in all cases.

### 3.5. Proposed mechanism for cellular EET metabolism

Fig. 3 illustrates a proposed scheme for EET metabolism based on the currently available data. According to this hypothesis, FABP physically binds unesterified EET in the cytosol and regulates its delivery to target proteins and enzymes. Some of the EET is incorporated into phospholipids through a CoA-dependent process and is then slowly eliminated from the phospholipids by phospholipase-mediated hydrolysis under basal conditions. Some of the unesterified EET is converted to DHET, and most of the DHET is released into the extracellular fluid. Although not shown in Fig. 3, studies in PAEC, PASMC and porcine coronary artery endothelial cells (PCEC)

clearly indicate that very small amounts of DHET are retained intracellularly and can be incorporated into cell phospholipids [51, 53, 56, 62].

# 4. Additional pathways of EET metabolism

Besides the major pathways illustrated in Fig. 3, EETs can undergo a number of other metabolic conversions. These additional reactions, which include partial β-oxidation, chain-elongation, oxidation by the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and CYP ω-oxidase enzymes, and conjugation with glutathione are illustrated schematically in Fig. 4.

## 4.1. β-Oxidation of EETs

The production of radiolabeled β-oxidation products initially was observed during incubation of \[^3^H\]11,12-EET with HSF [58]. Fig. 5 illustrates the radiolabeled products detected in the culture medium by reverse-phase HPLC. As opposed to the other cells and tissues that had been studied previously, the HSF converted only a relatively small amount of the \[^3^H\]11,12-EET to DHET. The majority of the radioactivity was detected in three additional products designated in the chromatogram as I, II and III.

Fig. 6 shows the negative ion chemical ionization mass spectra of the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives of the three metabolites produced by the HSF from 11,12-EET and, for comparison, a similar mass spectrum of 11,12-EET (Fig. 6A). The metabolites are partial β-oxidation products of 11,12-EET: I, 9,10-epoxy-Δ^6,12^-18:2 (Fig. 6B); II, 7,8-epoxy-Δ^4,10^-16:2 (Fig. 6C); III, 5,6-epoxy-Δ^8^-14:1 (Fig. 6D).

In both cases, the main products that accumulate are the 16-carbon metabolites that contain a Δ\(^4\)-cis-double bond. Additional studies with mitochondrial and peroxisomal HSF mutants indicated that these products are formed by peroxisomal β-oxidation [58]. A radiolabeled metabolite

with the HPLC properties of a 16-carbon product also was formed by the HSF from \[^{3}\]H]8,9-EET, but this product has not yet been positively identified.

Human coronary endothelial cells (HCEC), which convert relatively small amounts of EETs to DHETs, also produce partial β-oxidation products from \[^{3}\]H]11,12- and \[^{3}\]H]14,15-EET [54]. Formation of 14,15-DHET and 10,11-epoxy-16:2 is time- and concentration-dependent. The estimated \(K_{\text{m}}\) and \(V_{\text{max}}\) values are 2.2 μM and 1.4 pmol/min for the formation of 14,15-DHET, and 1.08 μM and 1.04 pmol/min for 10,11-epoxy-16:2 [54]. Likewise, human coronary artery smooth muscle cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells produce 10,11-epoxy-16:2 from \[^{3}\]H]14,15-EET [54]. By contrast, PCEC, which rapidly convert \[^{3}\]H]14,15-EET to DHET under basal conditions, produce substantial amounts of chain-shortened EET metabolites only when sEH is inhibited [53,68]. Based on these observations, partial β-oxidation appears to be an alternative pathway for EET catabolism under ordinary conditions and is prominent only when the sEH activity is inherently low or is inhibited.

### 4.1.1. Function of EET β-oxidation products

10,11-Epoxy-16:2, the 14,15-EET β-oxidation product that accumulates in the extracellular fluid, relaxes porcine and human coronary microvessels contracted with endothelin [54]. It also reduces tumor necrosis factor-α-induced interleukin-8 release from HCEC [54]. The potency of 10,11-epoxy-16:2 in these assays is similar to that of 14,15-EET. By contrast, 10,11-epoxy-16:2 produced much less relaxation than 14,15-EET in bovine coronary artery rings contracted with U-46619, and the 18- and 14-carbon metabolites also exhibited very little vasoactivity in this system [65]. Because of these conflicting observations, more work is needed to determine whether the partial β-oxidation products of 11,12- and 14,15-EET have functional effects in the various tissues that synthesize or are exposed to these EETs.

### 4.1.2. β-Oxidation of 11,12-DHET

11,12-DHET also can undergo partial β-oxidation in PASMC. The 16-carbon intermediate, 7,8-dihydroxy-Δ^4,10^-16:2, is the main product that accumulates in the extracellular fluid. This 11,12-DHET metabolite relaxes porcine coronary artery rings contracted with U46619 when it is added in concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 μM [56].

### 4.2. Chain-elongation products

PCEC convert 14,15-EET to a 22-carbon chain-elongation product, 16,17-epoxy-Δ^7,10,13^-22:3 [53]. Although most of the 16,17-epoxy-Δ^7,10,13^-22:3 is retained in the cell lipids, a small amount is released into the extracellular fluid under some conditions. Based on HPLC retention times, similar chain-elongated products appear to be formed by PASMC from 14,15- 11,12- and 8,9-EET [55,56]. Chemically synthesized 22-carbon EET derivatives dilate constricted canine and porcine coronary microvessels with potencies comparable to that of EETs [69], indicating that these products have vasoactive properties. 16,17-Dihydroxy-22:3, the elongation product of 14,15-DHET, also has been detected in the cell lipid extract following incubation of PCEC with 14,15-EET.

When PCEC incubated with \[^{3}\]H]14,15-EET are treated with DCU to selectively inhibit sEH, a small amount of radiolabeled 14,15-epoxy-Δ^8,11^-20:2 is detected in the cell lipids [53]. The
mechanism through which this dienoic 20-carbon epoxide is formed has not been determined, but a likely possibility is that it is a chain-elongation product of either the 12,13-epoxy-Δ⁶,9-18:2 or 10,11-epoxy-Δ⁴,7-16:2 that are formed from 14,15-EET by PCEC when sEH is inhibited.

### 4.3. Fatty acid epoxide derivatives

A number of fatty acid epoxide derivatives are formed. Some of these compounds are produced directly from EETs by cyclooxygenase, CYP ω-oxidase or glutathione S-transferase. Others are formed by rearrangements of 12-or 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE), the lipoxygenase products formed from arachidonic acid by 12-and 15-lipoxygenase, respectively. The different types of fatty acid epoxide derivatives are listed in Table 2

#### 4.3.1. Metabolism of EETs by cyclooxygenase

Following the identification of 5,6-epoxy-PGE₁ and its endoperoxide precursors, it became apparent that 5,6-EET was a potential substrate for cyclooxygenase metabolism in the vasculature [70,71]. Interest in this biochemical pathway emanated from in vivo physiology studies showing that among the EET regioisomers, 5,6-EET is the most potent in producing dilation of the isolated,

perfused rabbit kidney, and it is the only isomer whose activity is blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibitors [72]. Subsequently, the isolated, perfused rabbit kidney was found to convert 5,6-EET to the cyclooxygenase metabolites 5-hydroxy-PGI₁ and 5,6-epoxy-PGE₁ [73]. Moreover, 5,6-epoxy-PGE₁ is equipotent to 5,6-EET as a vasodilator, whereas 5-hydroxy-PGI₁ is devoid of vasodilator activity.

8,9-EET also undergoes cyclooxygenase-mediated conversion to 11- and 15-hydroxylation products; because of the location of the epoxide group, cyclization of 8,9-EET does not occur and it does not form PG endoperoxide compounds [74]. The vasoconstriction produced by 8,9-EET in the rat kidney is abolished by indomethacin, raising the possibility that the hydroxylated metabolites of 8,9-EET formed by cyclooxygenase are biologically active [75]. These and other early studies emphasize the potential importance of cyclooxygenase as a pathway of vascular EET metabolism in vitro and in vivo.

Subsequent studies demonstrated a role for cyclooxygenase metabolism in 5,6-EET-mediated dilation in the intact pulmonary circulation [76]. More recently, all four EET regioisomers were found to constrict isolated rabbit pulmonary arteries [77]. Interestingly, cyclooxygenase inhibition blocks responses not only to 5,6-EET, but also to 14,15-EET. Cyclooxygenase metabolites of EETs were not detected in this study, indicating that the EETs most likely stimulated the release of arachidonate, which in turn was metabolized to vasoconstrictor products by cyclooxygenase.

### 4.3.2. Formation of epoxy-derivatives by lipoxygenase

Metabolism of arachidonate by 12-lipoxygenase yields an unstable hydroperoxy intermediate that can be converted to hydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acids (referred to as hepoxilins) [78]. As the name suggests, these compounds contain both hydroxyl and epoxide functional groups. There are two hepoxilins, 8-hydroxy- and 10-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (8-OH- and 10-OH-11,12-EET). Hepoxilin A3, the 8-hydroxy-isomer, potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion in rat pancreatic islets [79]. Hydrolysis of the epoxide group leads to formation of trihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acids (referred to as trioxilins). 15-Lipoxygenase can also produce similar arachidonic acid metabolites. Little is known about the vascular production of these hydroxyepoxy- and trihydroxy-compounds, which are structurally similar to CYP-derived EETs and DHETs, respectively.

One or more products of lipoxygenase metabolism that is distinct from 12-HETE or 15-HETE produce arachidonic acid-induced dilation of the rabbit aorta [80]. Additional biochemical studies using arachidonic acid as a substrate showed that in the presence of 15-lipoxygenase, aortic homogenates produced 11-hydroxy-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11-OH-14,15-EET), 15-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (15-OH-11,12-EET), and their corresponding trihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (THETA) derivatives, 11,14,15-THETA and 11,12,15-THETA [81]. Aortic microsomes also produce these THETA derivatives from 15-HPETE, the product formed by 15-lipoxygenase from arachidonic acid.

Microsomal formation of the epoxide metabolites is blocked by the CYP inhibitor miconazole. These results were interpreted to suggest that a CYP enzyme is responsible for conversion of 15-HPETE to 11-OH-14,15-EET and 15-OH-11,12-EET. This enzymatic reaction appears to involve a microsomal CYP enzyme that does not require NADPH as a co-factor, analogous to the CYP activity of thromboxane synthase [82]. Alternatively, the hydroxy-EET derivatives potentially could be formed through the coordinated activities of a CYP epoxygenase and a lipoxygenase.

The enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of the epoxide groups was not identified. Nevertheless, epoxide hydrolysis of the hydroxy-EET derivatives appears to be biologically important because THETAs produce relaxation of rabbit aorta [81]. The extent to which hydroxy-EET derivatives and THETAs are formed and modulate reactivity in other blood vessels remains to be determined.

### 4.3.3. Metabolism of EETs by cytochrome P450 ω-oxidase

ω-Hydroxylation of arachidonic acid yields 20-HETE, a compound that has received considerable attention due to its potent biological activity [2,8]. In some vascular beds, 20-HETE appears to act as an EET antagonist and plays an important role as an endogenous vasoconstrictor [7,8]. 11,12-EET can be converted to 20-hydroxy-11,12-EET by renal cortical microsomes, suggesting that EETs also are potential substrates for CYP ω-oxidases in vivo [83]. A detailed analysis of this pathway was recently reported [84]. All four EET regioisomers are converted to their corresponding terminal (ω) and subterminal (ω-1) hydroxy metabolites by incubation with purified rat CYP4A ω-hydroxylases. Considerable specificity occurs with regard to ω-hydroxylation of the EETs. The rate of conversion depends on the location of the epoxide group and its position relative to the carboxylate moiety. Surprisingly, the rate of ω-hydroxylation of 8,9-EET and 11,12-EET exceeds that of arachidonic and lauric acids. Studies with rat liver microsomes indicate that CYP4A1 and CYP4A2 are the predominant enzymes responsible for ω-and ω-1-hydroxylation of EETs. Notably, the 20-hydroxy metabolites of 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET bind with high affinity and transactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) [84], suggesting that these ω-hydroxy compounds may play an important role in regulating fatty acid metabolism.

### 4.3.4. Metabolism of EET by glutathione S-transferases

Cytosolic glutathione S-transferases conjugate EETs with glutathione, a major cellular antioxidant, in a 1:1 ratio [85]. 14,15-EET is a better substrate than 11,12-, 8,9-, or 5,6-EET for this reaction. The \(K_m\) for 14,15-EET-glutathione formation by the purified transferase is about 10 μM, while the \(V_{max}\) ranges from 25 to 60 nmol/min/mg [86]. Although conjugation with glutathione almost certainly alters the biological activity of the EET, the functional significance of this process has not yet been investigated.

## 5. Stimulated release of EET from cells

Much more EET is released into the culture medium when cells are incubated with a \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) ionophore than under basal conditions. For example, mastocytoma cells loaded with radiolabeled 14,15-EET released 50% of the EET into the extracellular fluid in 15 min when they were incubated with A23187, a \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) ionophore [52]. Likewise, PCEC incubated with A23187 released 10-times more \({ }^{[3]}\) H]14,15-EET than under basal conditions [35,63]. Because most of the intracellular EET is present in phospholipids, the EET release almost certainly is due to the \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) dependent activation of a phospholipase. The type of phospholipase has not been determined, but the fact that the EETs are present primarily in the sn-2 position suggests that it probably is a phospholipase A₂.

Incubation of labeled cells with ionophore A23187 typically is performed for 20–30 min in order to obtain a sufficient amount of released radioactivity for HPLC analysis. Under these conditions, about two-thirds of the radioactivity released into the culture medium by \[^{3}H\]14,15-EET-labeled PCEC is recovered as DHET [35]. If DCU is added to selectively inhibit sEH, however, virtually all of the radioactivity released into the medium remains as EET [53]. This difference is illustrated by the HPLC analysis in Fig. 7, which shows the distribution of the radioactivity released into the medium by cells labeled with \[^{3}H\]14,15-EET in the absence (Fig. 7A) and presence (Fig. 7B) of sEH inhibition with DCU. Our interpretation of these findings is that in cells labeled with \[^{3}H\]14,15-EET, phospholipase activation initially results in release

of EET from the cells. The EET is then gradually converted to DHET, presumably due to reuptake and hydration by sEH, and the DHET is subsequently released from the cells.

### 5.1. EET-mediated vascular relaxation

EETs released from the endothelium activate BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels, causing hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle and vasodilation [6,8,10–13]. The current paradigm, illustrated in Fig. 8, is that phospholipase activation hydrolyzes arachidonic acid contained in endothelial phospholipids, and the arachidonic acid is subsequently converted to EET by an endothelial CYP epoxygenase [8]. The EET either produces autocrine effects on endothelial function or is released and acts as a paracrine mediator on adjacent cells like vascular smooth muscle.

An alternative to this mechanism is suggested by the finding that the vasodilator response to bradykinin is potentiated in porcine coronary artery rings pretreated with EET [35]. Potentiation of bradykinin-induced relaxation is blocked by triacsin C, an acyl CoA synthase inhibitor that reduces EET incorporation into endothelial phospholipids. This suggests that the effect of pretreatment of the rings with EET is exerted on the endothelium, a conclusion that is supported by the observation that endothelium-independent relaxation is not potentiated in the pretreated rings. Taken together, these results suggest that pretreatment with EET increases the EET content of endothelial phospholipids and thereby produces a larger EET release in response to bradykinin. Because of the increased release of EET, the relaxation response of the smooth muscle is augmented. Fig. 9 illustrates this alternative mechanism in which EETs are taken up from the

Fig. 8. Mechanism for EET-mediated vasodilation in which the EET is produced from arachidonic acid when the endothelium is activated. According to this paradigm, EET is synthesized by endothelial CYP epoxygenases from the arachidonic acid that is hydrolyzed from endothelial phospholipids as a result of phospholipase activation. The EET is released from the endothelium and activates the smooth muscle BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel, causing hyperpolarization and vascular relaxation.

extracellular fluid by the endothelium, either from the EET contained in the plasma or by reuptake of EET released from the endothelium. Following temporary storage in phospholipids, the EET subsequently is released when a stimulus activates the endothelial phospholipase.

## 6. ω-3 Fatty acid analogues of EET

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5ω-3), the ω-3 fatty acid analogue of arachidonic acid, can be converted to a 17,18-epoxy-derivative by vascular smooth muscle cells [87]. This apparently occurs through the action of either the CYP 4A1 or 4A3 that is expressed in these cells. The 17,18-epoxy-derivative of EPA produces greater activation of the rat cerebral artery BKCa channel than 11,12-EET. Likewise, epoxides synthesized chemically by incubation of EPA with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid [88], called epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQ), potently dilate canine and porcine microvessels [69]. Vicinal diols derived from EEQs are detected in the urine of humans who ingest ω-3 fatty acid supplements [89]. Taken together, these results suggest that the epoxy-derivatives of EPA, like those produced from arachidonic acid, may function as hyperpolarizing factors, especially when the diet is enriched in ω-3 fatty acids [69,87].

Five epoxy-derivatives of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6ω-3), called epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDP), have been synthesized chemically [90]. The EDPs dilate porcine coronary arterioles contracted with endothelin. Patch-clamp studies in the inside-out configuration indicate that the

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 9. Alternative mechanism for EET-mediated vasodilation in which preformed EET is released from endothelial phospholipids when the endothelium is activated. The difference in this hypothetical scheme is that preformed EET, obtained either from the plasma or by recapture of EET released previously from the endothelium, is incorporated and stored in endothelial phospholipids. The stored EET is released when the endothelial phospholipase is activated.

13,14-epoxy-EDP regioisomer is 1000-fold more effective than EETs in activating the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel of myocytes from rat small coronary arteries, making it the most potent BK<sub>Ca</sub> activator so far reported. It is not known, however, if docosahexaenoic acid is converted to 13,14-epoxy-EDP or any of the other EDP regioisomers under physiological conditions.

# 7. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)

Epoxide hydrolases (EC 3.3.2.3) are a group of enzymes that convert the epoxide group of chemical compounds to corresponding diols by the addition of water. The main epoxide hydro-lases have been classified based on the structure of their substrates and their cellular localization. They are cholesterol 5,6-oxide hydrolase, hepoxilin A<sub>3</sub> hydrolase, leukotriene A<sub>4</sub> hydrolase, sEH (formerly referred to as cytosolic EH), and mEH [91,92]. sEH is the primary enzyme responsible for the conversion of EETs to the corresponding DHETs (see Fig. 2). Because of the potential importance of this enzyme as a therapeutic target, this section will focus on the properties and function of sEH.

## 7.1. Distribution of sEH in mammalian tissues

sEH activity is widely distributed in mammalian tissues. Those containing high sEH activity include liver, kidney, intestine, and vascular tissue. Low levels of sEH are found in testes, lung, brain and spleen [42,51,55,93]. Although sEH is predominately located in the cytosol, sEH enzymatic activity and protein are also present in the peroxisomes [94–96]. The sEH from liver and kidney of different species, including human, has been purified [97–102]. Native rat liver sEH has a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa, consisting of two 61-kDa subunits [99]. Human liver sEH has been cloned and expressed in a baculovirus system. The 2101 base clone predicts a 554-residue protein [M(r) = 62,640] that contains an apparently weak peroxisomal targeting signal, Ser-Lys-Met, at the carboxyl terminus [100]. The predicted amino acid sequence of the human enzyme is very similar to that of mouse sEH [102].

## 7.2. Molecular biology of sEH

The genes encoding mEH and sEH are EPHX1 and EPHX2, respectively. Both EPHX1 and EPHX2 have been cloned and characterized [100,103]. EPHX2 is located in chromosomal region 8p21-p12 [104]. It is approximately 45 kb in length and consists of 19 exons with lengths from 27 to 265 bp. The translated parts of the exons of EPHX2 correspond to 555 amino acid residues [105], one residue more than predicted by the cDNA expressed in the insect cell system [100]. Genetic polymorphisms of human sEH have been identified. Eight variant cDNA loci from 25 human livers have been detected. The coding region contains five silent single nucleotide polymorphisms and two variant loci resulting in altered protein sequences [Arg<sup>287</sup> → Gln<sup>287</sup> (exon 8); Arg<sup>403</sup> → Arg<sup>403–404</sup>(exon 13)]. Although the two variant alleles retain catalytic activity, the allele containing the Arg insertion results in extremely low sEH enzymatic activity [106]. Thirty-six single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in the EPHX2 gene in Japanese individuals, as well as one insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 5′ flanking region [107]. These variants of the
sEH gene may explain previously reported differences in sEH activity among these individuals [108]. Although increased levels of DHETs are found in the urine of pregnancy-induced hypertensive women [109], it is not clear whether sEH gene variants are correlated with these or other clinical-pathological conditions.

### 7.3. Regulation of sEH expression

The expression of sEH is up-regulated by activation of PPARα in rodent species. sEH mRNA levels in mouse liver were increased 8-fold by clofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug that produces peroxisomal proliferation. Increases in sEH mRNA levels are also produced in kidney and heart by clofibrate [93]. In addition, dietary exposure to other peroxisomal proliferating agents, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2-ethylhexanoic acid, increase sEH activity in mouse liver [110,111]. Testosterone administration also augments sEH activity in mouse kidney and liver, and testosterone and clofibrate may have additive effects on sEH in these tissues [112].

### 7.4. Enzymatic mechanism

Epoxide hydrolases are members of the α/β hydrolase fold family. These enzymes hydrolyze their substrates in a two-step reaction involving the formation and hydrolysis of a covalent acyl- or alkyl-enzyme intermediate [113–115]. Similar to other α/β hydrolase fold enzymes, the Asp³³³ and His⁵²³ residues that are required for the catalytic activity of sEH are conserved in all epoxide hydrolases. No activity was detectable after the replacement of Asp³³³ by Ser, and mutation of His⁵²³ to Gln produced greater than 99% loss of sEH specific activity [102]. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that Asp⁴⁹⁵ also is required for activity of sEH, and it appears that Asp³³³, Asp⁴⁹⁵ and His⁵²³ form the catalytic triad [115]. Furthermore, the crystal structure of mouse sEH suggests that Tyr³⁸¹ and Tyr⁴⁶⁵ can act as acid catalysts, activating the epoxide ring and facilitating the formation of a covalent intermediate between the epoxide and the enzyme. Mutational analyses confirm that both Tyr³⁸¹ and Tyr⁴⁶⁵ are required for full catalytic activity of sEH [116].

### 7.5. sEH and lipid phosphate phosphatase activity

The mammalian sEH is a homodimer, and each subunit contains carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains (Fig. 10). The active site for epoxide hydrolysis is located in the carboxyl-terminal domain; the structure of this domain is similar to that of haloalkane dehalogenase and shares the

| N-terminal | C-terminal |
|------------|------------|
| Phosphatase activity | sEH activity |

Fig. 10. Bifunctional domains of sEH.$\alpha / \beta$ hydrolase fold. A vestigial active site is found in the N-terminal domain similar to that of another enzyme of halocarbon metabolism, haloacid dehalogenase. The amino-terminal domain of sEH appears to play a critical structural role by stabilizing the dimer in a distinctive conformation [117]. Furthermore, the amino-terminal domain of sEH has been shown recently to have phosphatase activity [118].

Phosphorylated hydroxy lipids are excellent substrates for the human sEH, particularly the monophosphate of dihydroxy stearic acid [119]. Rat sEH hydrolyzes 4-nitrophenyl phosphate with a rate constant of $0.8 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of $0.24 \, \mathrm{mM}$. If the carboxyl-terminal domain is deleted from human sEH, the amino-terminal domain still remains active as a phosphatase. This suggests that both catalytic sites act independently [118].

### 7.6. Metabolism of EETs by sEH

The conversion of EET to the corresponding DHET by sEH is regioselective. 14,15-EET is the preferred substrate as compared with 11,12- and 8,9-EET. Formation of 14,15- and 8,9-DHET by sEH is also stereoselective (4:1 and 7:3 ratio of antipodes, respectively), but hydration of 11,12-EET is not enantioselective. Regioselective and/or enantioselective oxirane water addition occurs during formation of asymmetric 14,15-, and 8,9-DHET, and 14(R),15(S)-, 11(S),12(R)-, and 8(S),9(R)-EET are metabolized at substantially higher rates than their antipodes. Conversion of EETs to methyl esters decreases the rates of epoxide hydration, and catalytic hydrogenation of EETs also reduces the rates of hydration [33,34].

### 7.7. sEH inhibitors

Substituted chalcone oxides and trans-3-phenylglycidols are two classes of structurally similar (both are epoxides), potent, and selective sEH inhibitors [120,121]. Fig. 11 (top) shows the structure of a chalcone oxide. A representative inhibitor of this class is 4-phenylchalcone oxide, which has a half-inhibitory concentration ($\mathrm{IC}_{50}$) of $64 \, \mathrm{nM}$ for mouse sEH [120]. Inhibition of sEH by substituted chalcone oxides occurs through electronic stabilization of the covalent enzyme–inhibitor intermediate [122]. Substituted chalcone oxides are poor substrates, and their inhibitory effects on sEH are transient. These compounds are also relatively unstable, particularly in the presence of glutathione [122].

trans-3-Phenylglycidol derivatives are enantioselective, slow binding inhibitors of sEH. $(2S,3S)$-3-(4-Nitrophenyl)glycidol is the most potent of the 3-phenylglycidol series, and the $(2S,3S)$-enantiomer is about 750-fold more effective as an inhibitor than the $(2R,3R)$-enantiomer [121]. However, even $(2S,3S)$-3-(4-nitrophenyl)glycidol has an $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ of $1.6 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$, which is less potent than 4-phenylchalcone oxide.

A new class of potent, selective and stable sEH inhibitors that are derivatives of urea and carbamates recently has been described [41]. DCU is a representative compound of this class (Fig. 11, middle). The $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ of DCU is $0.09$ and $0.16 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$ for mouse and human sEH, respectively [41]. DCU is poorly soluble in $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and this limits its potential usefulness. A series of urea-derived sEH inhibitors that have equivalent or greater potency than DCU and also have increased $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ solubility has been developed [123]. For example, $N$-cyclohexyl-$N'$-dodecylurea, in which a hydrocarbon chain replaces one of the cyclohexyl groups of DCU, increases the potency of sEH
inhibition 8- to 16-fold (IC₅₀ of 0.01 and 0.011 μM for mouse and human sEH, respectively) [123]. Addition of a carboxylic acid group to the end of the hydrocarbon chain of N-cyclohexyl-N'-dodecylurea further increases H₂O solubility without reducing the potency of sEH inhibition (Fig. 11, bottom).

Several metals ions also inhibit epoxide hydrolase activity. Cd²⁺ and Cu²⁺ inhibit sEH, while Hg²⁺ and Zn²⁺ inhibit mEH. The IC₅₀ for Cd²⁺ and Cu²⁺ is approximately 20 μM. Zn²⁺ is a competitive inhibitor of mEH, while Cd²⁺ and Cu²⁺ are noncompetitive inhibitors of mouse and human sEH [124].

It should be noted that the effect of sEH inhibitors is species specific. For example, N-cyclohexyl-N'-dodecylurea and N-cyclohexyl-N'-dodecanoylurea produce 10-fold more potent inhibition of mouse sEH than human sEH [123]. The effect of DCU on mouse sEH is also twice as potent as on human sEH [41]. Table 3 summarizes the potency and species specificity of representative sEH inhibitors.

A mechanism for the action of the alkylurea inhibitors has been proposed [125]. According to this mechanism, the urea carbonyl oxygen forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of Tyr³⁸¹ and Tyr⁴⁶⁵ of sEH. The urea carbonyl oxygen also interacts with Gln³⁸², which may stabilize the partial negative charge on the epoxide oxygen. The carboxylate side chain of Asp³³³ accepts a hydrogen bond from one of the urea NH-groups in each enzyme-inhibitor complex.

### 7.8. Potential applications of sEH inhibitors

sEH inhibitors have a number of beneficial actions that are likely to be useful in treating diseases that affect the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

#### 7.8.1. Cardiovascular system

Recent observations suggest that inhibition of sEH could be a novel approach for the treatment of hypertension. Although CYP2J expression and EET formation are increased in the kidney of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) [126], sEH expression and, consequently EET hydrolysis, are also increased. Inhibition of EET hydrolysis with the selective sEH inhibitor DCU reverses the hypertensive phenotype in the SHR [42], presumably by maintaining a high level of EET in renal tissue. Renal expression of sEH also is increased in rats made hypertensive by the infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II), and the sEH inhibitor N-cyclohexyl-N'-dodecyl urea decreases arterial blood pressure in this hypertension model presumably by raising the EET level [127]. Likewise, targeted disruption of sEH gene in male mice lowers systolic blood pressure [40]. Although four single nucleotide polymorphisms in the EPHX2 gene have been detected in SHR and three produce amino acid substitutions in sEH, these sequence variations do not appear to contribute to the elevated blood pressure level in the SHR [128].

The mechanism through which a sEH inhibitor lowers blood pressure probably involves three factors, as is illustrated in Fig. 12. One is that EETs, but not DHETs, produce vasodilation in the renal circulation [129, 64]. The enhanced renal microvascular reactivity to Ang II that occurs in hypertension is ameliorated by an analog of 11,12-EET [130], suggesting that an increase in endogenous EET would have a similar effect. Administration of a sEH inhibitor decreases the hydrolysis of EETs and, therefore, maintains a higher endogenous EET level. This reduces renal vasoconstriction and thereby decreases renin-Ang II-aldosterone-dependent hypertension. A second factor is that sEH inhibition increases the incorporation of EETs into phospholipids, leading to greater EET mobilization when the cell is stimulated. The increased release of EET potentiates the vasorelaxant response [35, 53, 68]. The third factor is that when sEH is inhibited, increased

amounts of EET are converted to chain-shortened epoxy fatty acids through β-oxidation. Epoxy-16:2, the main chain-shortened epoxy fatty acid that accumulates in the medium under these conditions [53], causes potent vasodilation [54].

In addition to regulating blood pressure, the sEH inhibitor DCU inhibits human vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. This effect of DCU is associated with a decrease in the level of cyclin D1, a cell cycle regulatory protein that activates the cyclin-dependent kinases. EETs mimic the proliferation suppressive activity of DCU [131]. However, there is no direct evidence as to whether the inhibitory effect of DCU on smooth muscle proliferation is due to inhibition of EET hydrolysis or to an unrelated action.

### 7.8.2. Respiratory system

Linoleic acid can be converted to leukotoxin, a linoleic acid epoxide produced by CYP in leukocytes [132, 133]. Similar to EETs, leukotoxin is converted to leukotoxin-diol by sEH [134]. This is illustrated in Fig. 13. Leukotoxin has been associated with multiple organ failure and the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Early studies found that the cytotoxic effects of leukotoxin occur only in the presence of epoxide hydrolase [135], and this observation was recently confirmed in vivo in a study showing that inhibition of sEH by 4-phenylchalcone oxide decreased leukotoxin-induced mortality [136]. The cytotoxic effects of leukotoxin-diol include mitochondrial dysfunction, eosinophilic exudates, alveolar edema, and hemorrhage [135–139]. These observations indicate that the conversion of leukotoxin to leukotoxin-diol by sEH is the process responsible for the

cytotoxic actions. Therefore, inhibition of sEH has a potentially beneficial effect for the treatment of leukotoxin-induced adult respiratory distress syndrome.

## 8. Biochemical response to EETs: mechanisms of action

Considerable progress has been made during the last two decades in determining the functional effects and metabolism of EETs [2,7,8,11,44]. In contrast, much less is known about the biochemical mechanisms through which EETs produce their responses. Because the physiological actions vary widely, depending upon the EET regioisomer and the specific cell type (see Table 1), a single biochemical response mechanism probably does not exist. Prostaglandins and thromboxanes act through a family of structurally similar plasma membrane receptors linked to specific biochemical cascades [140]. The potency and functional effects of EETs suggest that they also might act through a similar membrane receptor mechanism, and the presence of EET-receptor isoforms could account for the variety of biochemical responses and regioisomeric specificities. Although evidence for EET membrane receptors coupled to specific signaling cascades is growing

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

[11, 141], the possibility that EETs mediate some of their actions on cells by having a direct effect on intracellular mechanisms cannot be excluded.

### 8.1. The case for EET receptors

The earliest indication for the presence of an EET receptor was the finding that EETs are specifically bound to the plasma membrane of human U937 transformed monocytes [141]. Specific, high-affinity binding sites for 14,15-EET were detected with a \( K_{\mathrm{d}} \) of 13.8 nM. The binding of 14(R),15(S)-EET was displaced more effectively by 14(R),15(S)-EET than 14(S),15(R)-EET, indicating stereospecificity. Consistent with this finding, functional stereospecificity is being observed with increasing frequency as EET stereoisomers become more readily available [142–144]. Similar results were obtained with guinea pig mononuclear cells [145]. The binding of 14(R),15(S)-EET to the U937 and guinea pig mononuclear cells was disrupted by mild protease treatment [141], providing further evidence that a membrane protein binds the EET. Additional data suggested that in both cases, the putative receptor was linked to a cyclic AMP and protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway that subsequently down-regulates the receptor [141, 145].

Although these results are compelling, they remain open to question for several reasons. A receptor has not been purified or cloned from either of these cells. Furthermore, 14(R),15(S)-EET binding to the guinea pig mononuclear cells is about 20-times weaker than to U937 cells, suggesting that the binding proteins may be different in each case. Cell membranes contain fatty acid transporters [146], and the possibility that one of these proteins rather than a selective EET receptor might be responsible for the binding cannot be excluded. Another problem is that the data regarding linkage to the cyclic AMP and PKA signal transduction pathway is based on addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and inhibitors and, therefore, is indirect. Finally, recent studies have shown that ω-hydroxylated 11,12- and 14,15-EET derivatives formed from the corresponding EETs in the microsomes activate PPARα [84], suggesting that EET-induced regulation of gene expression occurs through an intracellular mechanism. While an intracellular mechanism is a reasonable hypothesis for EET-mediated gene expression, it seems less likely for processes like EET-stimulated ion fluxes that occur at the plasma membrane [6, 10, 16, 20, 21, 24, 25]. Therefore, efforts to obtain additional evidence for a plasma membrane EET receptor are continuing.

A recent approach utilized incubation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with 14,15-EET attached to silica beads through a sulfanilamide linkage [17]. The EET-sulfanilamide derivative is stable, and the attachment to the silica bead restricts the EET to the exterior surface of the cell. Data obtained with this tethered EET preparation demonstrated that a biological response could occur through 14,15-EET association with the plasma membrane. The 14,15-EET-bead complex inhibited aromatase activity to the same extent as 14,15-EET and the 14,15-EET-sulfanilamide derivative. Because the EET in the bead complex was restricted to the cell surface, the inhibitory effect could not be due to EET entry into the cells.

Additional results indicate that EETs stimulate cyclic AMP production by adenylyl cyclase in guinea pig cerebral microvascular cells and mammalian heart cells [147, 148], or by receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase cascades in cultured renal epithelial cells (LLCPKc14) and human endothelial cells [27, 149]. These biochemical responses are processes that are generally associatedwith ligands binding to plasma membrane receptors. When considered together with the binding data and tethered EET data [17,31,141,145], these findings provide strong circumstantial evidence for the existence of plasma membrane EET receptors.

### 8.2. EETs and ion transport

The involvement of EETs in ion homeostasis was first demonstrated by their ability to release $^{45} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from aortic smooth muscle microsomes [150]. All of the EET regioisomers were found subsequently to produce a transient increase in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration in porcine aortic smooth muscle cells by stimulating $\mathrm{Ca}$ influx through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels [16]. Likewise, both 5,6-EET and 11,12-EET increase $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry into guinea pig ventricular myocytes [151]. EETs also stimulate the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores in glomerular mesangial cells [152]. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ mobilization from intracellular stores or influx from the extracellular fluid has been shown repeatedly to either precede or occur concurrently with EET-stimulated biological responses [16,151–155], indicating that an increase in the cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration may be a central component of the cellular response to EETs. As opposed to these findings, 11,12-EET was found to decrease the open probability of porcine L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer [152]. Inhibition also occurred when phosphatidylcholine that contains 11,12-EET in the sn-2 position was added to the lipid bilayer, suggesting that the inhibitory effect probably resulted from either direct contact between the EET and the channel or perturbation of the lipid domain surrounding the channel. These disparate results suggest that the effect of EETs on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels may depend on the functional state of the cell [44].

EETs activate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ transport, and this is the basis for their action as an EDHF [6,7,10,12,13]. They increase the open state probability of the BK$_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel [156], causing hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle and vasorelaxation. Activation of the channel may be triggered by an EET-mediated increase in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores or opening of membrane $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in close proximity to the BK$_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel (calcium sparks) can increase the localized $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration to as high as $30 \mu \mathrm{M}$, an amount sufficient to activate the BK$_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel [157]. However, activation also occurs when EET is added to either a cell-attached or cell-free patch clamp, where the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration is held constant [10,12]. Therefore, BK$_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel activation by EET is not dependent on opening of a membrane $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel or an increase in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration. These patch clamp results suggest that EETs have the potential to activate the BK$_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel through direct interaction with a channel protein or an associated membrane protein, or by interacting with the membrane lipid domains that surround the channels. It remains to be determined whether a calcium spark, physical interaction with the channel, or physical interaction with an associated membrane protein is the process that mediates EET-induced activation of BK$_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels under physiological conditions.

Investigation of the effect of EETs on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ movement across the plasma membrane has not been extensive. While $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$ exchange is stimulated by EETs in rat glomerular mesangial cells by approximately 40–60%, presumably as a pH balancing response [154], the open state probability of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels is reduced in rat ventricular myocardium by as much as 70% by $5 \mu \mathrm{M}$ EET [24]. The inhibition is similar to that produced by local anesthetics such as lidocaine. In neither case is there enough evidence presented to permit speculation as to a mechanism by which EETs affect $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ movements.

8.3. EET signaling and G-proteins

A membrane-associated protein that appears to be involved in EET-mediated activation of BKCa channels is the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) Gas [158]. EETs activate the Gas subunit of a heterotrimeric G-protein by ADP-ribosylation [159]. In general, when G-proteins participate in transduction of extracellular signals, they are coupled with a plasma membrane receptor to initiate a signal cascade [160]. The class of receptors that typically function with G-proteins are the G-protein coupled receptors that have seven transmembrane domains [160]. By analogy, the involvement of Gas in activation of the BKCa channel suggests that EETs initiate a signal cascade by binding to a G-protein coupled receptor in some types of cells [159]. A similar mechanism linked to a signal cascade involving cyclic AMP and PKA was proposed to explain the down regulation of EET binding to human U937 and guinea pig mononuclear cells [141,145], and it is consistent with the mechanism of action of other prostanoids [161,162]. The increase in tissue plasminogen activator expression in cultured endothelial cells produced by 11,12-EET also is associated with activation of Gas and the production of cyclic AMP [22], providing further support for this type of mechanism.

Fig. 14 illustrates this hypothetical model for EET-mediated functional responses through activation of Gas. As an extension of this mechanism, we suggest that activation of PKA may be a branch point in transduction of the EET signal. We propose that one branch reaches the nucleus and mediates EET-dependent effects on gene expression, and the other activates the BKCa channel by phosphorylation of a serine residue of the channel α-subunit [163].

8.4. EET signaling through tyrosine kinase-linked cascades

A tyrosine kinase cascade also may mediate EET-stimulated biological responses. Tyrosine kinase activity in porcine aortic endothelial cell lysates increased as much as 3-fold within a few minutes after addition of as little as 100 nM 11,12-EET [164]. An important implication of these results is that the EET-induced increase in tyrosine kinase activity does not require changes in Ca²⁺ concentration or K⁺ channel activation. However, these findings do not indicate whether the tyrosine kinase that was activated was soluble or membrane associated.

Additional studies indicated that both 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in cultured LLCPKcl4 cells. Phosphorylation of proteins of several different molecular sizes occurred in the intact cell [27,149], including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, the src homologous and collagen-like protein (SHC), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and ERK2. c-Src activity also was increased up to 3-fold within 1–3 min after addition of either 14,15-EET or the EET derivative, 14,15-EET-sulfonamide, to the culture medium. It is likely that this entire series of protein phosphorylations, which describes a typical tyrosine kinase-signaling cascade, is mediated by the activation of the EGF receptor [165].

No evidence has been presented so far to show that EET is bound to or even closely associated with the EGF receptor [27,149,166], and it is possible that the activation of this pathway occurs through activation of a metalloproteinase [167]. Metalloproteinases cleave an endogenous membrane protein, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and thereby release EGF-like growth factor, a ligand that binds to the EGF receptor [167]. The activation of the EGF receptor
(self-phosphorylating) attracts several scaffolding proteins and c-src. Once bound to the receptor, c-src, which also is a tyrosine kinase, initiates a signal transduction pathway that proceeds through mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the ERKs. Although it is now clear that EETs rapidly increase HB-EGF release from the cell membranes by metalloproteinase activity, no data are yet available to indicate how EETs affect metalloproteinase activity. This series of EET-initiated events is linked to enhanced proliferation in renal epithelial cells and endothelial cells, and it also produces a three-fold increase in angiogenesis of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells [27,149,166,167]. Fig. 15 illustrates a proposed EET-mediated signaling cascade that involves a tyrosine kinase and src.

There is little evidence for a direct connection between a tyrosine kinase cascade and other important cellular responses to EETs such as ion transport. Although a close association between tyrosine phosphorylation of two cytoskeletal proteins and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uptake has been demonstrated in endothelial cells [168,169], the conclusion that the stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity by EETs is a separate response from EET stimulated ion movements is supported by reports that EETs activate BK$_{\text {Ca }}$ channels in membrane patches. These patches lack the protein associations that occur in intact cells. The scaffolding proteins and other signaling proteins that are subsequently phosphorylated in a tyrosine kinase signal cascade are contained in the cytosol before they

Thus, the tyrosine kinase-dependent EET pathway seems to be separate from the mechanism that controls ion movements in EET-stimulated cells. Even so, there are at least a few reports showing that EET-mediated EGF signaling can be linked through PI and protein kinase C activation to an increase in intracellular free Ca²⁺, a frequent response to EETs [16, 148, 152, 165, 170–174].

### 8.5. EET and cytokine-mediated inflammation

EETs also function as anti-inflammatory mediators through autocrine effects on endothelial cells [18, 19]. In particular, addition of 11,12-EET or overexpression of CYP2J2 decreases cytokine-induced endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression, reducing leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall [18]. Nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) is a key component responsible for cytokine-mediated inflammation. NF-κB is inactive when bound to IκB, an inhibitory protein that is degraded by IκB kinase [175]. EETs inhibit IκB kinase, preventing degradation of IκB. This maintains NF-κB in the inactive state and inhibits NF-κB-mediated gene transcription [19]. In addition, EETs induce polymorphonuclear leukocyte aggregation, and this also decreases leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [176].

Inhibitors of CYP epoxygenases augment lipopolysaccharide- and interleukin-1β-induced fever in rat and mouse models [177, 178], suggesting a role for EETs or their metabolites in the control of temperature homeostasis. Furthermore, administration of EETs attenuates fever induced by lipopolysaccharide- and interleukin-1β [179, 180]. The antipyretic effect may occur because 8,9-and 14,15-EET reduce the production of PGE₂ [15], an endogenous pyrogen that contributes to cytokine-induced fever.

### 8.6. Conclusions regarding EET signaling mechanisms

Because EETs elicit multifunctional responses that are distributed across a wide variety of tissues, they probably act through more than one biochemical mechanism. Evidence is growing for a plasma membrane EET receptor or family of receptors that mediate some of the functional responses. It is possible that a signaling cascade initiated by a putative receptor, through branching and complex interactions with other signaling pathways, could produce many of the functions attributed to EETs. However, EETs are incorporated into cell phospholipids, and metabolites that are generated intracellularly from EETs interact with nuclear receptors to regulate gene expression. Therefore, an intracellular mechanism of action probably also exists, and it is doubtful that a single mechanism or signal transduction pathway will be able to account for the diversity of functional responses that are produced by EETs.
