**Abstract** The biosynthesis of steroid hormones requires the coordinated expression of the enzymes that comprise the pathways via which specific hormones are synthesized. These pathways and their associated enzymes are typically subject to regulation consisting of trophic hormone stimuli and feedback mechanisms. Very few tissues contribute substantially to *de novo* steroidogenesis, primarily the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the placenta. Both the embryonic origins and the signaling mechanisms for the adrenals and gonads are similar, and steroid synthesis in these two glands are the major focus of this review. We will further describe peripheral steroid metabolism and the regulation of steroid hormone potency in target tissues. In addition, we will briefly discuss the congenital adrenal hyperplasias to illustrate the principles developed in the initial sections. Finally, we will discuss some recent developments in steroidogenesis, focusing on cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency and the alternate or “backdoor” pathway to dihydrotestosterone. We will conclude with a description of aberrant signaling mechanisms observed in adrenal tumors as a further example of how these pathways can be disturbed in pathologic states.

## 1 The adrenals and gonads as sources of steroids

The adrenal glands function to protect the individual from stress and to maintain body fluid and electrolyte balance. The adrenal gland is made of the cortex (90% of the adrenal, originating from mesoderm) and the medulla (10% of the adrenal, originating from neural crest, Fig. 1). The three functional zones that comprise the adrenal cortex each make characteristic steroids, and this zone-specific synthesis parallels their distinct expression of steroidogenic enzymes. The outer zone, the zona glomerulosa, makes 21-carbon mineralcorticoids (aldosterone) to help regulate salt and water balance. The zona fasciculata, the middle zone of the adrenal cortex, makes cortisol, which regulates carbohydrate metabolism and vascular response to catecholamines. Finally, the inner zone, zona reticularis, makes 19-carbon androgen precursors such as dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate (DHEA[S]). The neuroendocrine cells that make up the medulla synthesize and secrete catecholamines.

The testis and ovaries have little capacity to synthesize aldosterone or cortisol. Instead, steroid metabolism is focused on making androgens and estrogens, while the corpus luteum of the ovary produces progesterone. The testis efficiently completes the biosynthesis of testosterone and exports this potent androgen, whereas the ovaries synthesize primarily androstenedione and convert this 19-carbon steroid into 18-carbon estrogens, as well as variable amounts of testosterone. Steroidogenesis in the ovary is also compartmentalized in a cell-specific manner, with the theca cells primarily producing androstenedione and the granulosa cells completing the synthesis of estradiol. In both the adrenals and gonads, trophic hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] or luteinizing hormone [LH]) mobilize cholesterol into the steroidogenic pathways in bursts or pulses. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is critical in promoting granulosa cell

may relate to autoimmunity, infection, or even perhaps a genetic mutation of key enzymes in the steroidogenic pathways (Fig. 2).

The process of steroidogenesis always begins with cholesterol. After lipoprotein-bound cholesterol enters a cell, it is stored in cytoplasmic vacuoles and loaded into the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). When ACTH is released from the pituitary gland and binds to its receptor (melanocortin receptor type 2, MC2R) on adrenal cells, cholesterol is mobilized and made available for steroid synthesis. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) [1, 2] is involved in transferring cholesterol from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) where the cholesterol side chain enzyme system (CYP11A1) resides and steroidogenesis begins with the cleavage of cholesterol to pregnenolone. In the adrenal cortex, cytochrome P450 enzymes have zone-specific expression, which is important for catalyzing specific reactions of steroid precursors in the steroidogenic pathway (Fig. 2). For example, aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) catalyzes several reactions to make aldosterone from 11-deoxycorticosterone in the zona glomerulosa. On the other hand, 11-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), which is located in the zona fasciculata, catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. CYP17A1 (17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) an important enzyme that 17-hydroxylates pregnenolone and progesterone in the zona fasciculata and cleaves 17-hydroxyprogrenolone to DHEA in the zona reticularis. CYP17A1 also converts pregnenolone to 19-carbon steroids, primarily via DHEA, in the gonads. The enzymes 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase type 2 (3βHSD2) and 21-hydro-

The entire process of steroid hormone production, action,
and metabolism can be dissected into five basic components.
These components include: (1) cholesterol conversion to preg-
nenolone, (2) pregnenolone metabolism into various inter-
mediates and active steroid hormones, (3) peripheral organ
metabolism of hormone precursors and/or hormones, (4)
specific metabolic effects at the target tissue, (5) degradative
or inconsequential metabolism of steroids. In the following
section, each of these basic components of steroidogenesis
will be discussed in greater detail.

1. Cholesterol conversion to pregnenolone. Cholesterol is
a 27-carbon sterol that is cleaved to 21-carbon pregnen-
olone, the first steroid product common to all steroido-
genesis. This initial step is tightly regulated and allows
rapid production of steroids in response to stimuli. Only
certain cells in the human are able to convert cholesterol
into pregnenolone. These cells include testicular Leydig
cells, placental trophoblast cells, ovarian theca cells, and
corpus luteum cells, and of course the adrenal cortex cells,
as well as certain neuronal cells in the brain.
2. Pregnenolone metabolism into various intermediates
and active steroid hormones. The enzymes present in a
given steroidogenic cell determines which steroids are
made from pregnenolone in that cell. Consequently, the
adrenal zona glomerulosa converts pregnenolone into
aldosterone, but the ovarian theca cells lack the
“machinery” to make aldosterone and instead produce
mostly androstenedione.
3. Peripheral organ metabolism of hormone precursors
and/or hormones. Although few organs are able to make
steroids from cholesterol, many are able to transform
circulating steroids derived from other sources. For
example, adrenal DHEAS is converted into testosterone
in peripheral tissues, and this route is normally the major
source of testosterone in young women. The skin and
liver also have a large capacity to further metabolize
steroids.
4. Specific metabolic effects at the target tissue. Hormones may potentially become more potent or activated
in target tissue. A well-known example is how
testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
in the prostate gland.
5. Unknown or inconsequential metabolism of steroids.
Only a small fraction of the active steroid hormones
synthesized in the adrenals and gonads are excreted
unchanged by the kidneys. Steroids are extensively
metabolized, primarily by the liver, by many trans-
formations that generally reduce their activities, including
5β-reduction and 6-hydroxylations of 21- and 19-carbon
steroids and the 4-hydroxylation of estrogens.

## 3 Steroidogenic enzymes

A general principle in steroidogenesis is that reactions are functionally unidirectional because most reactions are irre-
versible, and the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reactions,
while reversible, predominantly proceed in one direction. The
cytochromes P450 are enzymes whose chemistry is limited to
hydroxylation reactions and occasionally carbon-carbon bond
cleavage reactions [3]. All cytochrome P450 reactions use
molecular oxygen and electrons from NADPH to perform
reactions of the basic form:

$\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{NADPH}+\mathrm{H}+\longrightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$

Cytochromes P450 can be described as type I and type II
enzymes. Type I enzymes reside in the mitochondria and use
adrenodoxin with adrenodoxin reductase as their electron
transfer system to move electrons from NADPH to their heme
prosthetic group. Adrenodoxin reductase is a flavoenzyme
that oxidizes NADPH and transfers these electrons to
adrenodoxin, a small iron-sulfur protein, which then deposits
its electrons in the P450. In humans, type I P450 enzymes
include CYP11A1 (P450scc), CYP11B1 (P450c11β), CYP11B2
(P450c11AS), and other enzymes involved in vitamin D
and bile acid metabolism. In contrast to type I enzymes,
type II enzymes comprise the majority of cytochromes
P450 and are located in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum
[4]. Type II P450s use cytochrome P450-oxidoreductase
(POR), which contains two flavins, to both oxidize NADPH
and reduce the P450 directly. Steroidogenic type II enzymes
include CYP17A1 (P450c17), CYP21A2 (P450c21), and
CYP19A1 (aromatase, P450aro).

The other major class of enzymes in steroidogenesis in-
cludes hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) and reduc-
tases. In general, the HSDs exist in one or more isoforms
which regulate the proportions of a given ketosteroid and its
cognate hydroxysteroid in a given cell or in plasma, and this
simple redox reaction profoundly alters the potency of that
steroid [5]. These HSD isoforms are encoded by separate
genes with tissue-specific expression tailored to the function
of the enzyme in that location. Functionally, oxidative HSDs
use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) as a cofactor
to convert hydroxysteroids to ketosteroids, whereas reduc-
tive HSDs use NADPH to reduce ketosteroids to hydrox-
ysteroids. HSDs can also be classified via a structural
scheme into two large families, the short chain oxidoreduc-
tases (SCOR) [6] or aldo-keto reductases (AKR) [7]. The
SCOR enzymes have a beta-alpha-beta or Rossman fold as
noted for glyceralde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [8], where
several parallel beta strands stretch across the center of the
molecule with alpha helices to both sides. The AKR en-
zymes have a triosephosphate isomerase or TIM-barrel motif
where eight oblique but parallel beta strands form the centerof a “barrel” with alpha helices draped along the outside [9]. Both the SCOR and AKR enzymes have tyrosine and lysine residues involved in proton transfer steps during catalysis.

# 4 Acute regulation of steroidogenesis

Within minutes after ACTH stimulates the adrenal gland, steroid hormone production is observed. While it was known that ACTH promotes adrenal gland survival through trophic effects and maintains steroidogenic capacity, the mechanism of this acute effect was a mystery for decades. Evidence for mediation by a labile protein derived from experiments using cycloheximide to block this acute response to ACTH [10]. Although CYP11A1, the rate-limiting enzyme of steroidogenesis, is induced by ACTH, the time course is much too slow to account for the acute effects of ACTH [11]. Over the last decade, the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) was discovered and shown to be a key protein for moving cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM [1]. StAR is a 37 kDa protein that is cleaved into a 30 kDa protein upon entering the mitochondria [12]. When mouse StAR is overexpressed in MA-10 Leydig cells, the basal steroidogenic rate increases [1]. StAR is able to move hundreds of cholesterol molecules before becoming inactivated and thus appears to serve a transfer or catalytic role [13]. StAR also contains a START domain shared by several other proteins in this family, and this hydrophobic beta-sheet pocket stoichiometrically binds one molecule of cholesterol [14] and may be part of the mechanism for cholesterol mobilization. Steroidogenesis can occur even in the absence of StAR but at about 10% of the StAR-induced rate, which accounts for steroidogenic ability of other organs such as the placenta and brain that lack StAR [15]. Finally, mutations in StAR almost completely eliminate steroid production by the adrenals and gonads in a condition called congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (see below) [16], and $star^{-/-}$ mice show a very similar phenotype [17]. The signal for StAR activation in the gonads and inner zones of the adrenal cortex is cAMP, whereas StAR in the zona glomerulosa is activated by potassium and the calcium/CAM-kinase cascade. The exact mechanisms of StAR action, the forms of StAR that mediate cholesterol transport, and the roles of StAR phosphorylation and degradation have been studied intensively but remain unresolved.

# 5 Chronic regulation of steroidogenesis

ACTH induces adrenal cell hypertrophy by stimulating cAMP generation, which in turn promotes the production of basic fibroblast growth factor [18], epidermal growth factor [19], and IGF-II [20]. In parallel, ACTH increases the transcription of genes that encode steroidogenic enzymes and proteins involved in electron transfer via activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). The episodic bursts of ACTH, however, are not sufficient for continued steroid production. The diversity of steroid production derived from cAMP-stimulated gene transcription requires the involvement of other factors, including multiple transcription factors such as GATA4 and GATA6 (so named for the GATA motif to which this family binds), specific transcription factors 1 and 3 (SP-1, SP-3), and steroidogenic factor (SF-1). SF-1 is an orphan nuclear receptor that is central to the coordination of steroidogenic enzyme expression [21]. Disruption of SF-1 in mice results in abnormal development of the adrenals, gonads, and the hypothalamus [22], and partial deficiencies of SF-1 are associated with gonadal dysgenesis with or without adrenal insufficiency [23].

# 6 Congenital adrenal hyperplasias

The congenital adrenal hyperplasias (CAHs) are important clinical examples that illustrate fundamental principles of steroidogenesis. All of these disorders impair cortisol biosynthesis, which lowers feedback inhibition and thus increases adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) secretion. It is useful to think of these disorders as those that affect adrenal steroids only (21- and 11-hydroxylase deficiencies) or those that affect both the adrenals and gonads. The following descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive reviews of these diseases and their management but rather examples to illustrate the concepts developed above. The disorders will be described approximately in parallel to the pathway of cortisol biosynthesis at the level of detail necessary to develop the concepts which these disorders illustrate.

## 6.1 Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia: StAR and CYP11A1 deficiencies

Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LCAH) is the most severe form of CAH. The disease is so named because the adrenals of affected individuals are filled with massive accumulation of lipids, which consists primarily of cholesterol esters [24]. Production of all steroids from the adrenal and gonads is severely reduced, which suggested that the disease results from dysfunction of the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1. Curiously, the placentas of LCAH fetuses make progesterone, despite the fetal origin of the steroidogenic trophoblast cells. Furthermore, following the cloning of the CYP11A1 gene, patients with LCAH were not found to harbor mutations in this gene [25]. In addition, girls with LCAH that survive into adolescence can experience partial pubertal development [26]. Thus the adrenalsand gonads of these patients appear to have the potential to make steroids but simply cannot get the process started.

The answer to this mystery came with the discovery of the StAR protein, which mobilizes cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM. Indeed, shortly after the cloning of the human STAR gene, patients with LCAH were found to have mutations in the StAR protein [27]. Since the placenta does not express StAR, placental steroidogenesis is intact and independent of StAR. In addition, about 10% of pregnenolone production is independent of StAR, which leads to a trace of steroidogenesis early in the disease. In the ovary, very little steroid synthesis normally occurs in fetal life and childhood, and this production increases substantially at puberty. In LCAH, girls often feminize partially at puberty with detectable circulating estradiol, but estrogen production ceases after a few months to years. These phenomena lead to a “two-hit” model of LCAH pathogenesis [27]. At the onset of steroid production, StAR deficiency severely but incompletely blunts pregnenolone synthesis. As the steroidogenic cell compensates under high trophic hormone stimulation, it accumulates cholesterol esters. This accumulation of lipid somehow worsens the dysfunction of the cell and eventually leads to its demise, possibly by lipotoxicity or global organelar dysfunction.

More recently, cases of atypical LCAH have been discovered who lack mutations in the StAR protein. Some of these patients have been shown to have heterozygous [28] or homozygous incomplete [29] deficiencies of CYP11A1. In these patients, steroid production is generally higher than those with StAR mutations, but still grossly abnormal. No human beings with complete deficiency of CYP11A1 have been described, possibly because the placental would be unable to make progesterone during gestation, which might be incompatible with term pregnancy. As illustrated here, LCAH has taught us much about the control of steroid production, the physiology of the adrenals and gonads, and the function of the StAR protein.

### 6.2 17-Hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency: CYP17A1 deficiency

Deficiencies of CYP17A1 can alter the synthesis of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. The exact manifestations depend on the severity and the relative impairment of the hydroxylase and lyase activities [30]. The clinical presentation of classic, severe 17-hydroxylase deficiency (17OHD) is sexual infantilism with hypokalemic hypertension. This constellation of features derives first from the inability to 17-hydroxylase progesterone and pregnenolone, which eliminates the synthesis of both cortisol and 17-hydroxypregnenolone, the latter being a critical intermediate in 19-carbon steroid synthesis. Loss of cortisol relieves feedback inhibition on the pituitary and raises ACTH production. Consequently, precursors prior to the block in cortisol synthesis accumulate, and these include corticosterone (B) and 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) [31]. DOC is a potent mineralocorticoid, which expands plasma volume, causes kaluresis and hypertension, and suppresses plasma renin activity as well as aldosterone synthesis. B is both a mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid, and high circulating B substitutes for cortisol as it does in rodents, whose adrenals do not express cyp17a1. Patients with 17OHD, ironically, make neither aldosterone nor cortisol yet have severe hypertension and do not suffer adrenal crisis due to high production of DOC and B. Both genotypic males and females show sexual infantilism and lack of androgen-dependent body hair growth. Genotypic females have a small uterus and ovaries that may enlarge and become polycystic, and genotypic males have intra-abdominal or inguinal testes and a blind vaginal pouch similar to what is seen in androgen insensitivity syndrome. In Brazil, 17OHD appears to be the second most common cause of CAH due to two founder mutations [32].

The spectrum of 17OHD is complex due to variable phenotypes associated with incomplete disorders. Partial disorders tend to have less severe hypertension and hypokalemia and some development of secondary sexual characteristics, particularly in genetic females. In addition, point mutations that selectively disrupt 17,20-lyase activity have been described, causing isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency (ILD). These ILD mutations tend to interfere more with electron transfer [33] but can impair substrate binding [34]. ILD patients present with pubertal failure without hypokalemic hypertension. Most cases described are males, although this may represent a selection bias as females are less severely affected and lack genital ambiguity [35].

#### 6.3 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase deficiency: 3β-HSD2 (HSD3B2) deficiency

The clinical entity of 3βHSD deficiency was defined almost 50 years ago by Bongiovanni [36]. The molecular definition of this disorder 30 years later revealed that the human genome contains two 3βHSD enzymes: the type 1 enzyme expressed in the placenta, skin, liver, and other peripheral tissues [37], and the type 2 enzyme expressed in the adrenals and gonads [38]-which is mutated in 3βHSD deficiency [39]. A characteristic feature of 3βHSD deficiency is the paradoxical finding that both male and female infants are born with ambiguous genitalia for very different reasons. In the males, lack of testicular 3βHSD2 prevents intrauterine testosterone synthesis. In the females, lack of adrenal 3βHSD2 prevents cortisol synthesis, raises ACTH, and drives excess adrenal DHEAS production. This DHEAS is converted to testosterone in peripheral tissues because these tissues contain 3βHSD1, which is normal in these children. The moderate testosterone excess causessome clitoromegaly at birth but little labioscrotal fusion [40]. As the child grows, androgen excess becomes more of a problem with hirsutism and menstrual irregularity, probably because of greater adrenal DHEAS production coupled to greater capacity to metabolize DHEAS to testosterone. The existence of a partial or “late onset” form of the disease was suspected in hirsute women with high serum DHEAS, but the gene for 3βHSD2 is normal in these patients [41], suggesting a functional rather than genetic disorder.

6.4 21-Hydroxylase deficiency: CYP21A2 deficiency

Although the prevalence varies in certain ethnic groups, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) is by far the most common cause of CAH, with an incidence of about 1:14,000 live births [42]. The hallmark of 21OHD is adrenal androgen excess with variable deficiency of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids [43]. This phenotype derives from the need for 21-hydroxylase for both aldosterone and cortisol biosynthesis coupled with the accumulation of cortisol precursors such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), which are metabolized to androgens. The disease exists in a spectrum of severity from the most severe “classic” forms to the “nonclassic” forms, which correlate with the impairment of enzyme activity [44]. The most severe classic form of 21OHD is the “salt wasting” variety, in which females are born with ambiguous genitalia from prenatal androgen excess, and all newborns are vulnerable to salt wasting crisis and hypotension in the first few weeks after birth because aldosterone synthesis is severely impaired. Like the classic salt wasting CAH patients, females with “simple virilizing” 21OHD have ambiguous genitalia; however, their aldosterone synthesis is partially preserved and sufficient to prevent salt wasting crises. Nonclassical 21OHD is much more common than the classical disease, having an incidence of up to 1:100 in general Caucasian population and as much as 1:27 in the Ashkenazi Jews [43]. The nonclassical CAH patients secrete aldosterone and cortisol normally, and affected females do not have ambiguous genitalia. Females are generally asymptomatic but may present in adolescence with hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities; males are rarely ascertained.

The high prevalence of 21OHD and the limited number of mutations found in most affected patients derives from the molecular genetics of the 21-hydroxylase locus (Table 1). The CYP21A2 gene is located in the highly recombinogenic HLA locus on chromosome 6p21.1 adjacent to the genes for the fourth component of complement [45]. This locus contains a pseudogene, CYP21A1, within a duplicated region of about 30 kilobases. Most of the mutations in CYP21A2 causing 21OHD are caused by gene conversion events [46], where a portion of CYP21A1 is somehow transferred to CYP21A2, which renders this gene incapable of transcription and/or

enzymatically inactive. Patients with a given mutation generally show a consistent phenotype (Table 1), although the intron 2 splicing mutation has variable severity even within kindreds. Most cases of nonclassical 21OHD have the mild V281L mutation [47].

6.5 11-Hydroxylase deficiency: CYP11B1 deficiency

Deficiency of 11-hydroxylase (11OHD) combines the mineralocorticoid excess seen in 17OHD and the androgen excess found in 21OHD [48]. This disorder interrupts the final step of cortisol biosynthesis and releases feedback inhibition as in other forms of CAH. Cortisol precursors accumulate, including 11-deoxycortisol and DOC, the latter causing hypertension and hypokalemia as in 17OHD. Unlike 17OHD, however, the pathways to androgens are intact, and these precursors are metabolized to androgens.

6.6 P450-oxidoreductase deficiency or Antley-Bixler syndrome: POR deficiency

The form of CAH most recently described was originally thought to be a combination of 17OHD and 21OHD due to the accumulation of characteristic steroids for both disorders, B and 17OHP, respectively [49]. This disorder poses a confusing array of biochemical and phenotypic features that thwarted molecular definition for many years [50]. Both males and females are born with intersex phenotypes as in 3βHSD deficiency, but postnatal girls show nearly absent testosterone synthesis. Many children are born with craniofacial deformities and peripheral synostoses that carry several eponyms such as Antley–Bixler syndrome, which resembles disorders of cholesterol biosynthesis such as Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome. Mothers carrying affected fetuses virilize late in pregnancy as seen in aromatase (CYP19A1) deficiency.

SW Salt wasting, SV simple virilizing, NC nonclassicalThe molecular basis of this disorder was elucidated in 2003 and found to be incomplete loss of POR activity [51]. Since POR is the essential electron donor for all type II cytochromes P450, these mutations result in severe but incomplete loss of the activities of CYP17A1, CYP21A2, CYP19A1- which explains the disordered steroidogenesis. The skeletal malformations probably derive from impaired activity of CYP51A1 (lanosterol demethylase), which disrupts cholesterol synthesis *in utero* and probably interferes with hedgehog transcription factor signaling and body patterning during development. Some other intriguing biochemical features of POR deficiency are discussed below.

### 7 The alternate or “backdoor” pathway to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)

DHT is the androgen that plays a key role in formation of male external genitalia. During male genital development, 5α-reductase type 2, found in human male prostate and skin, converts testis-derived testosterone from the circulation into the more potent androgen DHT. On the other hand, the testis of the tammar wallaby synthesizes 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (androstenediol or Adiol), rather than testosterone, as the precursor to DHT [52]. The key feature of this alternate pathway to DHT is the presence of 5α-reductase (probably 5α-reductase type 1) in the steroidogenic tissue, which allows 21-carbon steroids such as 17OHP to be 5α-reduced.

When 17OHP is 5α- and 3α-reduced, the product is 5α-pregnane-3α,17α-diol-20-one (Pdiol), which is an excellent substrate for the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A1, yielding the 5α-reduced androgen androsterone. Androsterone is reduced to Adiol by 17βHSD3, which is secreted by the testis and oxidized by 3αHSDs in the target tissues [53]. This pathway is also called the “backdoor pathway” since DHT is the ultimate product without testosterone being an intermediate [54], whereas the classical pathways feature testosterone as the proximal intermediate to DHT (Fig. 3).

The human steroidogenic enzymes are able to catalyze all of the steps in the backdoor pathway, and Pdiol is the best substrate yet identified for the 17,20-lyase activity of human CYP17A1 [55]. It is unlikely that the backdoor pathway is involved in the formation of the male external genitalia during normal human development because mutations in 5α-reductase type 2 are sufficient to cause severe male pseudohermaphroditism [56]. In contrast, it is likely that the backdoor pathway contributes to DHT synthesis in androgen excess disorders, particularly those in which 17OHP accumulates. Examples of where the backdoor pathway is likely to have clinical significance are discussed below.

Fig. 3 Backdoor or alternate pathway to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) illustrated by dashed arrow with characteristic enzymes and intermediatesthe luteal phase, high progesterone synthesis is accompanied by abundant ovarian secretion of its 5α-reduced product 5α-pregnane-3,20-dione. Based on studies of women from families with 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency, the ovarian 5α-reductase is the type 1 enzyme [57]. When the ovaries are stimulated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone or analog, circulating 17OHP concentrations rise, and this rise is disproportionately high in women with androgen excess due to PCOS [58]. This high 17OHP has been interpreted to reflect a relative deficiency of 17,20-lyase activity in the PCOS ovary, which is counterintuitive for an androgen excess state. An alternate explanation is that the high intra-ovarian 17OHP in PCOS allows DHT production via the backdoor pathway and may significantly contribute to the ovarian hyperandrogenemia. This alternate route to DHT in the ovary may explain why some women have hirsutism out of proportion to their plasma testosterone values.

### 7.2 21OHD and 3βHSD deficiency

As noted earlier, the virilization of females with 21OHD and 3βHSD deficiency is presumed to relate to the overproduction of DHEAS, which is peripherally converted into testosterone. However, DHEAS production is comparable in both these forms of CAH, yet only newborns with 21OHD are severely virilized, and the peripheral pathways to testosterone are unimpaired in both disorders. Inspection of the disordered steroidogenesis in patients with 21OHD shows high intra-adrenal 17OHP accumulation as a distinguishing feature from 3βHSD deficiency. This 17OHP might be converted to DHT via the backdoor pathway if 5α-reductase is present, and this DHT could virilize a female fetus (Fig. 3). On the other hand, patients with 3βHSD deficiency overproduce DHEAS like 21OHD patients; however, these patients are not able to utilize the backdoor pathway since they cannot make 17OHP. The female fetuses with 3βHSD deficiency virilize but only slightly because DHEAS is converted into testosterone and thence DHT in the peripheral tissues such as the liver or skin, suggesting that this route to DHT is an inefficient means for female virilization.

### 7.3 Antley-Bixler syndrome with disordered steroidogenesis (POR deficiency)

Among the many puzzles of POR deficiency is how the mothers can virilize and the girls can be born with genital virilization when their postnatal testosterone synthesis is nearly absent. These features are also seen in aromatase (CYP19A1) deficiency, and CYP19A1 also uses POR as an electron donor. However, aromatase deficiency results in maternal and fetal masculinization due to the accumulation of aromatase substrates androstenedione and testosterone, which

are both very low in POR deficiency. In POR deficiency, the partial deficiencies in the activities of CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 allow intra-adrenal 17OHP to accumulate as in 21OHD patients. Because the POR deficiency is partial and because Pdiol is such a good substrate for human CYP17A1, it is plausible that this high 17OHP can be converted to DHT via Pdiol and the backdoor pathway [59]. Consistent with this model, elevated urinary Pdiol and androsterone excretion is seen in mothers carrying children with PORD [60, 61].

## 8 Molecular mechanisms in adrenal tumors

In addition to CAH, another clinical problem that illustrates pathologic mechanisms to disturb steroid biosynthesis is functional tumors of the adrenal gland. This section will focus on two aspects of hormone production by adrenal tumors: the up-regulation of important transcription factors and the expression of ectopic G-protein coupled receptors.

As expected, CYP11B1 is highly expressed in cortisol producing adenomas (CPAs) and CYP11B2 levels are elevated in aldosterone producing adenomas (APAs) [62]. Since transcription factors drive expression for enzymes, expression profiles for transcription factors have been evaluated. It has been shown that the expression of SF-1, DAX-1 (Dosage sensitive sex reversal–Adrenal hypoplasia congenita gene on the X-chromosome, gene 1), NURR1 (Nur-related factor-1), NGFIB (Nerve Growth Factor Inducible factor IB), and GATA-4 are increased in APAs whereas increased expression of DAX-1 and GATA-6 are noted in CPAs (Table 2). In human H295R adrenocortical cells, co-expression of NURR1 and NGFIB increased expression of CYP11B2 but not CYP11B1, consistent with a selective action on aldosterone synthesis [63]. Based on these data, NURR1 and NGFIB-in conjunction with SF-1 and other transcription factors—appear to be important for CYP11B2 expression in APAs.

The induction of these transcription factors, which drive the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, is normally regulated by signal transduction cascades, primarily initiated by G-protein coupled receptors (Fig. 4). Under normal circumstances, ACTH activates MC2R, which then acti-

vates adenylyl cyclase and increases cAMP production. The cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates various transcription factors. Several papers by Lacroix et al. have described that aberrant expression of G-protein coupled receptors are involved in the secretion of cortisol from CPAs that are not regulated by ACTH (64, 67). These receptors have been best documented in ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH), which accounts for approximately 10–15% of adrenal Cushing syndrome cases.

In cases of AIMAH, cortisol production has been linked to inappropriate sensitivity to various hormones, including gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), luteinizing hormone (LH), angiotensin II, serotonin (5HT), and vasopressin (Table 3). These hormones bind to their cognate receptors on the adrenal cells and mimic the cellular events that occur with MC2R stimulation [64]. These receptors can be ectopic or eutopic and typically not mutated but rather expressed in an abundance that overwhelms the normally dominant action of ACTH on MC2R. A good example is the GIP receptor, which causes increased plasma cortisol following a meal [65] in patients with adenomas or AIMAH expressing the GIP receptor. Ectopic β-adrenergic receptors driving steroidogenesis have been found in four patients with AIMAH [66]. However, it is sometimes difficult to tell if these abnormal receptors are the major mechanism driving the hormone production.

A second well-described example is the LH receptor, which is normally found in the human zona reticularis, but is also associated with aberrant adrenal function [67]. When the human LH receptor is expressed in bovine adrenocortical cells, which are later implanted into adrenalectomized immunodeficient mice, the mice have elevated and gonadotropin-responsive plasma cortisol, decreased ACTH, hyperglycemia, muscle atrophy, and thin skin [68]. The cortisol secretion in these animals is stimulated by hCG injections,

demonstrating that expression of the LH receptor is sufficient to confer gonadotropin-mediated steroid production from adrenal cells. CPAs and AIMAH with ectopic LH receptor expression are associated with postmenopausal ACTH-independent hypercortisolism, when LH is chronically elevated. Ectopic expression of the LH receptor on APAs has also been demonstrated, and co-expression of the LH receptor in NCI-H295 cells confers LH-responsive increases in CYP11B2 expression [63].

The presence of functional aberrant hormone receptors on adrenal tumors provides a potential for targeted pharmacotherapy.

ological therapy. For example, blocking postprandial release of GIP with octreotide leads to improvement in hypercortisolism, but the drawback is that the somatostatin receptors become desensitized [64]. Blocking the β-adrenergic receptor with propranolol has been shown to help patients with catecholamine-dependent hypercortisolism [66]. Suppression of LH with leuprolide acetate controls steroid secretion and might avoid adrenalectomy in patients with LH/CG-dependent AIMAH [69], and this treatment is particularly well-suited for postmenopausal women in whom this disorder is most common.

Finally, autonomous cortisol production is found in primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), which is often seen in the Carney complex [70]. Most PPNAD patients have mutations in the protein kinase A regulatory subunit type IA (PRKAR1A) on chromosome 17q22-24 [71], which accentuates cAMP stimulation and causes unbridled cell growth and cortisol production. Other familial cases of PPNAD and Carney complex are associated with a locus on chromosome 2p16, but the gene responsible has not yet been identified. Elucidation of this other molecular defect causing PPNAD might help to understand autonomy in other adrenal adenomas and in AIMAH. For example, some cases of AIMAH occur in Gardner's syndrome or Familial Adenomatous Polyposis [72] in which mutations in the APC gene cause activation of the Wnt pathway. It is possible that similar abnormal signaling mechanisms contribute to disordered steroidogenesis in other adrenal neoplasms.

## 9 Conclusions

Although steroid biosynthesis has been studied for decades, new disorders and alternate pathways continue to emerge. The CAH disorders, particular LCAH and POR deficiency, have written and now rewritten many paradigms for steroid biosynthesis and continue to unearth many secrets of human physiology.

## 10 Key unanswered questions

We believe that the key unanswered questions of steroid biosynthesis include:

1) the role(s) of the alternate (backdoor) pathway to DHT in human physiology and disease;

2) the participation of milder forms of CAH and PCOS in common disorders such as hypertension and obesity;

3) the genes responsible for variable presentations and progression of CAH;

4) the molecular mechanisms responsible for adrenal tumorigenesis and autonomy.
