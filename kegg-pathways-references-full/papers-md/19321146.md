auditory stimuli were bound into
a unitary construct.

Taken together, these recent studies
are providing important insights into
the neurobiological bases of specific
reading disabilities, and are converging
on a multisensory model that better
links auditory processing deficits with
the visual functions that mediate
reading. This knowledge provides
a better conceptual framework for
understanding reading disabilities,
and holds great promise for the
development of more effective
remediation strategies for the
treatment of those suffering from these
often debilitating disabilities.

# Innate Immunity: Cytoplasmic DNA Sensing by the AIM2 Inflammasome

Cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA triggers cell death and secretion of the pro-
inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in macrophages. Recent reports now describe the
mechanism underlying this observation. Upon sensing of DNA, the HIN-200
family member AIM2 triggers the assembly of the inflammasome, culminating
in caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation and pyroptotic cell death.

The innate immune system recognizes
pathogens through an extensive array
of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
that detect invariant microbial motifs
called pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs). DNA is one such
PAMP that is highly immunostimulatory
when internalized or delivered into the
cytoplasm of cells [1,2]. Prokaryotic,
viral and non-microbial DNA triggers
a number of innate immune pathways
that result in the secretion of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, in particular
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the induction of
anti-viral type I interferons (IFNα/β) [2]
and cell death in susceptible cells, such
as macrophages [3].

Many years of intense research
have only begun to explain the
immunostimulatory effects of DNA. The
first clue came with the discovery of the
membrane-bound Toll-like receptor
(TLR) family of PRRs. Upon recognition
of PAMPs, TLR pathways trigger
profound changes in gene regulation,
including the induction of many
pro-inflammatory cytokines downstream
of NFκB, mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) kinases, and IFN regulatory
factors (IRFs). Our understanding of
the immunostimulatory properties of
foreign DNA was advanced
significantly by the identification of
TLR9, which specifically recognizes
 unmethylated CpG sequences that are
present in prokaryotic DNA but
suppressed in mammalian DNA [4]. The
analysis of TLR9-deficient mice
revealed the existence of alternative
DNA-sensing pathways, including
those regulating IL-1β maturation
and IRF-3-dependent type I IFN
expression [2,5]. Furthermore, while
TLR9 recognizes foreign DNA in
endo-lysosomal compartments [6],
DNA delivered to the cytoplasm
triggers a TLR-independent innate
immune response that includes the
secretion of IFNβ and IL-1β from
macrophages [2,5,7]. By comparison,
IFNβ is not induced in response to the
TLR9 ligand, Cpg DNA, in
macrophages [8].
The hunt for the cytoplasmic DNA
sensor(s) then began in earnest. The
first DNA sensor identified was DAI
(also known as DLM-1/ZBP1),
which was shown to trigger a robust
TBK-1/IRF-3-dependent type I IFN
response. Subsequent reports
suggested, however, that
DAI-independent mechanisms also
operate [9,10]. A recent report from
our group implicated the
‘inflammasome’ pathway in the
sensing of cytoplasmic DNA, leading
to caspase-1 activation and IL-1β
maturation [5].

Figure 1. Model for activation of the AIM2 inflammasome by cytosolic DNA.  

AIM2 binds to cytoplasmic dsDNA of viral, bacterial or mammalian origin via its HIN domain and oligomerizes upon interaction with dsDNA in a length-dependent manner. In doing so, AIM2 provides binding sites for the adaptor ASC, through homotypic pyrin domain (PYD) interactions. ASC clustering then allows pro-caspase-1 recruitment, via CARD-CARD interactions, and caspase-1 activation. Activated caspase-1 triggers IL-1β processing and secretion in cells primed by inflammatory stimuli to express pro-IL-1β. If prolonged, caspase-1 activation eventually leads to pyroptotic cell death. In addition, cytosolic DNA elicits the induction of the anti-viral cytokine IFNβ, through pathways that are currently unclear but may involve DAI. Signaling by autocrine/paracrine IFNβ can regulate the AIM2 inflammasome, as it induces expression of both AIM2 and the AIM2 inflammasome antagonist p202.  

Although TLR signaling induces the  
expression of IL-1β and IL-18, these  
proteins are synthesized as inactive  
precursor proteins that require a  
second signal for caspase-1-mediated  
processing and secretion of the active  
cytokine in most cell types [11]. Some  
members of the nucleotide-binding  
domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR)  
family of proteins, of which the best  
characterized is NALP3, form  
intracellular caspase-1-activating  
platforms ('inflammasomes') that  
function in concert with other pathways,  
such as TLR signaling, to regulate  

the maturation of pro-inflammatory  
cytokines, such as IL-1β. Caspase-1  
activation can also trigger pyroptosis,  
a form of pro-inflammatory cell death  
distinct from the immunologically silent  
apoptosis mediated by apoptotic  
caspases such as caspase-3. The  
importance of inflammasomes in  
regulating inflammatory processes is  
highlighted by strong links between  
mutations in single NLRs and human  
inflammatory diseases (reviewed  
in [12]).  

NALP3 senses both pathogen-  
associated and host-derived  

molecules (e.g. bacterial  
peptidoglycan, ATP, monosodium  
urate crystals); the exact molecular  
interactions associated with these  
events are currently unclear but it  
seems likely that this occurs through an  
indirect mechanism. Upon recognition  
of these cellular 'danger' signals,  
NALP3 is thought to oligomerize and  
recruit the adaptor proteins Cardinal  
and ASC, the latter via homotypic pyrin  
domain interactions. The clustered  
caspase recruitment domains (CARDs)  
of ASC and Cardinal in turn permit the  
binding and activation of the  

inflammatory caspase-1, resulting in the molecular complex referred to as the NALP3 inflammasome. Activated caspase-1 cleaves IL-1β and IL-18 into their bioactive forms and triggers their secretion. Our recent study indicated that, in addition to the known inflammasome stimulators, the NALP3 inflammasome was activated by adenovirus in a DNA-dependent manner [5]. Subsequent investigation revealed that an uncharacterized inflammasome, dependent on ASC but not NALP3, was activated by transfected cytosolic DNA [7].

Four new reports [13–16] now posit the HIN-200 family member AIM2 as the elusive sensor of cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), providing new insight into innate viral defense systems. The results suggest that AIM2 binds directly to cytoplasmic DNA and triggers the assembly of an AIM2 inflammasome resulting in caspase-1 activation and, in cells expressing pro-IL-1β, the maturation of IL-1β (Figure 1). The requirements of cytoplasmic DNA for IFNβ induction and DNA-dependent cell death are quite permissive: the only necessity is that DNA must be double-stranded and it was found that immunogenicity increases with DNA length [16]. The source and sequence of cytoplasmic dsDNA appear to be unimportant for inflammasome activation, as viral, bacterial, mammalian and synthetic dsDNA could all activate caspase-1 [14,15].

In vitro assays suggested that AIM2 interacts directly with dsDNA through its carboxy-terminal HIN domain [14,15], and preferentially binds dsDNA rather than single-stranded DNA [13]. Incubation with dsDNA induced AIM2 oligomerization [14]. Cyttoplasmic dsDNA sensing did not seem to be a general feature of the human HIN-200 family, as the other family members, IFIX, IFI16 and MNDA, appeared to be constitutively nuclear [14,15]. Of the HIN-200 family, only AIM2 co-localized in cytoplasmic ASC speckles when overexpressed cytoplasmically in 293T cells (nuclear localization sequences were deleted for proteins with native nuclear expression) [15], and only the AIM2 pyrin domain interacted with the pyrin domain of ASC in immunoprecipitation studies and in vitro pull-down assays [13–15]. AIM2 inflammasome activation by cytosolic dsDNA or the dsDNA vaccinia virus culminated in the

processing of caspase-1 and, in the case of pro-IL-1β-expressing cells, processing and release of IL-1β [14,15]. Both caspase-1 activation and IL-1β processing/ release were dependent on AIM2 and ASC, but not NALP3 or other human HIN-200 family members [13–16].

Although other HIN-200 family members did not appear to be able to trigger inflammasome formation, Roberts et al. [16] reported that the mouse HIN-200 protein p202 negatively regulates the AIM2 inflammasome, because RNA interference-mediated knockdown of p202 enhanced DNA-induced caspase-1 and caspase-3 activation [16]. This group demonstrated that p202 binds specifically to dsDNA in a sequence-independent but length-dependent manner, similar to AIM2. p202 contains two HIN domains but no pyrin domain; it is the only HIN-200 family member to lack a pyrin domain and, therefore, to have no potential to interact with ASC. The authors suggest that p202 antagonizes the AIM2 inflammasome by sequestering dsDNA and by interfering with AIM2–ASC interactions, and thus the ability to form an inflammasome. The relevance of this mechanism to humans is currently unclear, as p202 has no known ortholog in humans, and a human HIN-200 protein lacking a pyrin domain has yet to be described.

In addition to activating the inflammatory and pyroptotic caspase, caspase-1, cytoplasmic dsDNA also triggered the activation of the apoptotic executioner, caspase-3, in an AIM2-dependent fashion [16]. DNA-dependent cell death was dependent on AIM2, ASC and caspase-1 [14,15]. In keeping with this, Fernandes-Alnemri et al. [14] suggest that DNA-dependent cell death displays the hallmarks of pyroptosis. The question of whether other caspases, such as caspase-3, can contribute to DNA-dependent cell death is currently unresolved.

Interestingly, although the AIM2 inflammasome was critical for caspase-1 activation and cell death, it appeared to be completely dispensable for IFNβ induction in response to cytoplasmic dsDNA. Knockout of either ASC or caspase-1 or knockdown of AIM2 failed to block, and actually potentiated, IFNβ induction [15]. This effect is believed to be a consequence of increased cell viability as opposed to signaling or crosstalk between type I IFN and inflammasome pathways.

The physiological situations in which the AIM2 inflammasome pathway might be engaged and its relative place among the other pathogen- or danger-recognition systems remain unclear. The AIM2 inflammasome is suggested to be an additional line of defense against dsDNA viruses that have escaped into the cytosol after circumventing other pathways of innate immunity, such as the detection of viral dsDNA by TLR9 during phagocytosis and the recognition of virus-induced phagosomal/lysosomal stress by the NALP3 inflammasome [14]. In combination with the DNA sensors that lead to IRF-3 activation, this provides a substantial layer of defense against pathogens that do not enter the cell via endosomes or phagosomes, or manage to escape these pathways. It has also been suggested that retrotransposons or self DNA may be recognized by cytoplasmic DNA sensors [16]. The circumstances in which this may occur and their biological significance will require further study.

In all, these recent reports detailing the sensing of cytoplasmic dsDNA by AIM2 have uncovered some novel aspects of inflammasome biology. They provide the first demonstration of inflammasome assembly by a protein outside of the NLR family and document the first example of a direct interaction between an inflammasome sensor and its ligand. In addition, these reports shed some light on the possible mechanism that drives the inflammatory response against self DNA in patients with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Both AIM2 and p202 fall within susceptibility loci for SLE in humans and mice, and p202 is differentially expressed between lupus-susceptible and lupus-resistant mice [16]. Further research is required to clarify the involvement of the HIN-200 family in this disease.

Plant Development: PIF4 Integrates Diverse Environmental Signals

Flexible adaptation to environmental changes is essential for plants. Recent studies suggest that a group of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors play a central role in the crosstalk between environmental cues and hormone signalling.

Doris Lucyshyn and Philip A. Wigge*

Since plants are sessile, they must be able to sense changes and adapt their development to the environment. Development continues throughout the life-cycle of the plant, providing a rich system to study how biological systems perceive multiple environmental cues and integrate this information to control development. Light and temperature are two particularly important environmental cues for plant growth and vary enormously on both a day-to-day and a seasonal basis. In two recent issues of *Current Biology*, Koini et al. [1] and Casson et al. [2] have shown that an emerging player in plant responses to the environment, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF4), has a key role in modulating developmental responses to both light and temperature.

The PIF family of transcription factors has already been shown to be crucial for mediating certain effects of light on plant development. Plants use light not just as an energy source but, in combination with ambient temperature, day length and light quality, also to provide seasonal cues. An important measure of light quality is the ratio of red to far-red light (R:FR), since increased amounts of FR indicate shading. In *Arabidopsis*, an exquisitely sensitive and complex pathway relays signals from sensor proteins called phytochromes to control gene expression. Red light triggers a conformational change in phytochromes, leading to their activation. The activated phytochromes, in turn, direct the degradation of PIFs, with accompanying effects on the genes regulated by these transcription factors (reviewed in [3]). PIFs have been shown to be important in a range of developmental processes, such as seed germination, seedling development, hypocotyl elongation and shade avoidance, that are strongly influenced by environmental conditions. Light has been shown to regulate these processes through the modulation of PIF stability, but it is becoming clear that, in addition to light, PIFs are also regulated by other factors. On the transcriptional level, PIF4 and PIF5 are regulated by the circadian clock. The coinciding regulation of PIFs at the transcript and protein level by the clock and light quality, respectively, ensures that plant growth takes place in the early hours before sunrise, providing optimal conditions for growth [4,5]. However, as alluded to above, the R:FR ratio is not the only important factor regulating PIF function. It was established last year that PIFs are also regulated by the gibberellin-signalling pathway via DELLA proteins. DELLA proteins, which are growth-repressing transcriptional regulators, were shown to interact with the DNA-binding domains of PIF3 and PIF4, thereby preventing their transcriptional activity and resulting in growth restraint [4,6].

In an exciting new study, Koini et al. [1] add temperature to the group of factors that regulate PIF4 activity. The authors were aiming to find out if there is a connection between shade avoidance and high temperature responses, as these stresses lead to very similar phenotypes. Surprisingly, they found that a single gene, *PIF4*, is mainly responsible for hypocotyl and
