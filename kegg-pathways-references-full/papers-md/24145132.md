**ABSTRACT**

The hypothalamus integrates endogenous and exogenous inputs to control the pituitary-gonadal axis. The ultimate hypothalamic influence on reproductive activity is mediated through timely secretion of GnRH in the portal blood, which modulates the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary. In this context neurons expressing the RF-amide neuropeptide kisspeptin present required features to fulfill the role of the long sought-after hypothalamic integrative centre governing the stimulation of GnRH neurons. Here we focus on the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by kisspeptin through its cognate receptor KISS1R and on the potential role of proteins interacting with this receptor. We then review evidence implicating both kisspeptin and RFRP 3—another RF-amide neuropeptide—in the temporal orchestration of both the pre-ovulatory LH surge in female rodents and the organization of seasonal breeding in photoperiodic species.

**1. Introduction**

The gene KiSS1, encoding kisspeptin (Kp), was originally described as a metastasis suppressor gene capable of reducing metastatic potential of malignant melanoma (Lee et al., 1996). The KiSS1 gene product is translated into a 145 amino acids residue precursor that is further cleaved into a 54 residue peptide, originally called metastatin or Kp54. Additional cleavage of metastatin leads to the production of shorter peptides, namely Kp16, Kp14, Kp13, and Kp10 based on their amino acid length. All these peptides have been detected in the brain and are considered endogenous neuropeptides. Initially it was suggested that the KiSS1 gene protein products would most likely not be secreted but rather act intracellularly (Lee et al., 1996). However, further studies revealed a secretory signaling sequence and raised the possibility that KiSS1 could interact with a membrane receptor. This receptor was identified by three research teams in 2001 and called it KISS1R (also known as GPR54, AXOR12, hOT7T175orHH8 (Kotani et al., 2001; Muir

et al., 2001; Ohtaki et al., 2001). KISS1R is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Based on sequence homology and functional similarity (Kirby et al., 2010) it has been included in the class A of GPCRs. More precisely, due to the overall 45% identity it shares with galanin receptors, KISS1R belongs to the A5 subfamily (Lee et al., 1999).

Soon after receptor deorphanization it was discovered that hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in humans is associated with loss-of-function mutations in KISS1R (de Roux et al., 2003; Seminara et al., 2003). This finding established a clear link between Kp and reproduction and indicated that Kp acts as a major stimulator of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonal axis. This breakthrough led to an outburst of research, which collectively revealed the central role played by the KiSS1/KISS1R system in most, if not all, aspects of reproductive physiology, ranging from the initiation of puberty to the induction of ovulation.

In mammals two main neuronal populations expressing Kp have been identified. The most prominent population is located in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), where Kp is coexpressed with dynorphin and neurokinin B. The second Kp population has a more variable neuroanatomical distribution depending on the species. In rodents it is localized in the rostral periventricular region (including the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, AVPV) of the hypothalamus and it is sexually dimorphic, with females having far more neurons than males. Conversely, in sheep and primates, this population is mainly located within the preoptic area making difficult to extrapolate neuroanatomical and physiological data obtained in rodent to primate. Both populations make direct synaptic contacts with GnRH neurons and/or their terminals in the median eminence (Colledge, 2009; Pinilla et al., 2012). The action of Kp on GnRH neurons leads to GnRH secretion, which then triggers an increased release of LH and, to a lesser extent, of FSH too. Several excellent reviews have already been published on the roles of the Kp system on several aspects of reproduction and provide a general overview of the subject (e.g. (Roa et al., 2011; Goodman and Lehman, 2012; Pinilla et al., 2012; Simonneaux et al., 2012). In the present review we will first summarize what is known regarding the second messenger pathways triggered by KISS1R activation. We shall then examine how the association of KISS1R with intracellular partners might modulate Kp signaling. Finally, we will review the literature regarding the pathways and mechanisms which link Kp to the timing of the pre-ovulatory GnRH/LH surge in female rodents on one hand, and the photoperiodic control of seasonal reproduction on the other hand.

information on the intracellular signaling was derived from studies performed either in cell lines (HEK293, CHO, B16-B16, COS-7, NIH-3T3, MDA-MB-435S, NPA) transfected with the receptor (Kotani et al., 2001; Muir et al., 2001; Ohtaki et al., 2001; Stafford et al., 2002; Becker et al., 2005; Stathatos et al., 2005) or in immortalized cell lines natively expressing the receptor (GT1-7, Human thyroid carcinoma ARO, AsPC-1, PANC-1) (Masui et al., 2004; Stathatos et al., 2005; Babwah et al., 2012). These studies demonstrated that aside from Ca²⁺ mobilization other intracellular events are associated with KISS1R activation by Kp. In particular, the pathways leading to MAPK phosphorylation and activation of β-arrestin appear important. Stimulation of the MAPK pathway by Kp could take different routes: ERK1/2 stimulation, stimulation of focal adhesion kinase, p38 kinase phosphorylation and PI3K/Akt activation (Kotani et al., 2001; Ohtaki et al., 2001; Becker et al., 2005; Stathatos et al., 2005; Castellano et al., 2006). The activation of kinases has been suggested to underpin various Kp functions such as hormone secretion, suppression of metastasis, modulation of proliferation and apoptosis. It is important to note the existence of significant differences in the capacity to activate the different MAPK pathways depending on cell lines, which suggests an important role of the cellular environment in shaping Kp action. On the other hand, it should be also mentioned that the Kp concentrations used in the different studies are quite variable, ranging from doses as low as 10 nM up to doses as high as 1 μM; caution is therefore required when comparing the effects obtained in the various studies. Notwithstanding these potential limitations it seems reasonable to assume that activation of the ERK1/2 pathway following Kp stimulation probably constitutes a common intracellular signaling pathway, likely shared by most cells expressing the KISS1R.

MAPK phosphorylation could be mediated by Gq-dependent and Gq-independent pathways. Both pathways are reportedly involved in the response to Kp, but investigation on their respective contribution remains limited. Interestingly, knocking down β-arrestin-2 prevented ERK1/2 pathway activation, which suggests coupling of the β-arrestin to the ERK pathway (Pampillo et al., 2009). Indeed, data from experiments using heterologous expression of KISS1R in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines derived from distinct mouse strains genetically invalidated for β-arrestin-1, β-arrestin-2, both β-arrestin-1 and -2 combined with Gq/11 knock-out suggest that the Gq and β-arrestins pathways are simultaneously activated by Kp10 (Szereszewski et al., 2010). Further investigations are warranted to yield a clear picture of how KISS1R stimulation impacts the interplay between Gq signaling and β-arrestin-dependent activation of the ERK cascade.

Reports from in vivo studies suggest that Kp response could decline after continuous stimulation (Messenger et al., 2005; Seminara et al., 2006; Jayasena et al., 2010). This decline in the response is not readily attributable to intracellular depletion of GnRH (Messenger et al., 2005; Seminara et al., 2006), which implies some degree of receptor desensitization and/or internalization. In this respect β-arrestins, which are known to be involved in GPCRs homologous desensitization, appear well-suited to play a role. Indeed, there is evidence that Kp10 induces the recruitment of β-arrestins to the membrane (Pampillo et al., 2009). Following β-arrestins recruitment to the membrane, KISS1R and β-arrestins are found to colocalize in internalized vesicles suggesting the participation of β-arrestins in KISS1R internalization (Pampillo et al., 2009).

Interestingly, stimulation of KISS1R by Kp triggers a long-lasting cell depolarization (Han et al., 2005; Dumalska et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Kroll et al., 2011; Zhang and Spergel, 2012). A rapid recycling of the receptor to the plasma membrane would ensure the persistent presence at the cell surface of non-desensitized receptors capable of sustaining a long-lasting response to stimulation. Actually, the

One component involved in the Kp-induced depolarization is the closure of inwardly rectifying \(K^{+}\left(K_{\mathrm{ir}}\right)\) channels. The inhibition of this \(K^{+}\)current results in a depolarizing action. The precise nature of the \(K^{+}\)channels involved in generating this current is unknown. However, since this current is sensitive to barium, 4-aminopyridine and tetramethylammonium it is likely that several types of \(K_{\mathrm{ir}}\) channels are implicated (Liu et al., 2008; Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008, 2009). Another potential Kp action to modulate \(K^{+}\)conductance is through the control of GABA\(_{\mathrm{B}}\) receptor activity. GABA\(_{\mathrm{B}}\) are G protein-coupled receptors and their activation produces neuronal hyperpolarization by increasing membrane \(K^{+}\)conductance. Application of Kp abrogates the outward current and associated membrane hyperpolarization elicited by the selective GABA\(_{\mathrm{B}}\) agonist baclofen through heterologous desensitization. The mechanism responsible for blunting GABA\(_{\mathrm{B}}\)-dependent \(K^{+}\)channels opening would be a combination of intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) increase and PIP2 hydrolysis (Zhang et al., 2009). These two events could be closely related because Gq stimulation induces PLC activation, leading to PIP2 hydrolysis and generation of DAG and IP3. IP3 in turn triggers the release of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) from intracellular stores thereby increasing overall intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) concentration (Liu et al., 2008). In support of this model, Kp10-induced increase of GnRH secretion from hypothalamic explants of juvenile female rats is blocked by the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 (Castellano et al., 2006). Also thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{ATPase}\), completely blocks Kp10-induced GnRH secretion suggesting that \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release from intracellular stores is an important component of Kp10 signaling leading to GnRH neuron activation (Castellano et al., 2006). However, the importance of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release from intracellular stores in mediating Kp effect is controversial. In GnRH neurons located within the MSDB the persistence of depolarization in the presence of intracellular BAPTA suggests a depolarization mechanism independent from intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) stores (Dumalska et al., 2008). The fact that the response to Kp is preserved in the presence of intracellular 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB, an inhibitor of IP3-mediated \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release from intracellular stores) is in line with this contention (Zhang et al., 2008).

A second component elicited by Kp in GnRH neurons is the opening of non-selective cation channels. This opening is concomitant with the inhibition of \(K^{+}\)channels and would contribute to membrane depolarization by increasing the intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) concentration (Liu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhang and Spergel, 2012). The nature of the non-selective cation channels involved in this effect has been investigated by pharmacological inhibition (Zhang et al., 2008; Constantin et al., 2009; Kroll et al., 2011; Zhang and Spergel, 2012). The blockade of Kp action by various inhibitors (2-APB, SKF96365, \(\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}\), flufenamic acid and BTP2) of transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) indicates that multiple members of this family of channels are involved in Kp response (Zhang et al., 2008; Zhang and Spergel, 2012). This is corroborated by data from single cell gene expression analysis showing the presence in GnRH neurons of transcripts for TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6 and TRPC7 (Zhang et al., 2008). Finally, there are also data suggesting that the closure of \(K_{\mathrm{ir}}\) and opening of TRPC would induce a depolarization sufficient to open voltage gated \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) channels. The opening of voltage gated \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) channels would further stimulate \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release from intracellular stores by activating ryanodine receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum (Zhang and Spergel, 2012).

Overall, ignoring inconsistencies regarding its precise origin – either an influx from the extracellular compartment through membrane channels and/or release from intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) store – it is clear that an increase of intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) concentration is an essential component in the response of GnRH neurons to Kp stimulation.

**Ca²⁺ imaging analysis of mouse nasal placode explants containing GnRH neurons revealed that a large population of Kp-responsive GnRH neurons (75%) becomes unresponsive to Kp in the presence of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, (Constantin et al., 2009)). On the other hand, in this preparation about 20% of GnRH neurons still respond to Kp10 in the presence of TTX, but the response itself is delayed and the slope reduced, which suggests that the fast component of the response of these cells is indeed TTX-sensitive. Conversely, electrophysiological studies of GnRH neurons from GnRH-GFP transgenic mice reveal a lack of effect of TTX upon Kp action (Liu et al., 2008; Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). Therefore the contribution of sodium channels to Kp-induced depolarization, if any, warrants further investigation.**

Kp is considered the best candidate to mediate both positive and negative feedback action of estrogen. Apart from having a direct influence on Kp neurons, it has been suggested that estrogen could also modulate Kp effect on GnRH neurons indirectly (Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008). Kp increases the frequency of GABAergic (mediated by GABAA ionotropic receptor) and glutamatergic post-synaptic currents in an estradiol-dependent manner as demonstrated in ovariectomized mice receiving either a empty or an estradiol-filled implant (Pielecka-Fortuna and Moenter, 2010). Estradiol therefore enables a Kp-mediated increase in GABAA and glutamate transmission to GnRH neurons through a pre-synaptic mechanism.

Collectively, these results make it possible to sketch a picture of the intracellular mechanisms likely regulating GnRH neuron activation by Kp (Fig. 1). However, as stated before, a note of caution is required since multiple factors such as age, gender, sex steroids or heterogeneity of the GnRH population, might influence the intracellular pathways involved in the response of GnRH neurons to Kp. It should also be kept in mind that most of these data were gathered in rodents and the conclusions may therefore not apply to other mammals.

Finally, it has recently been shown that Kp also acts as an agonist on two receptors, namely GPR147 (also named NPFF1) and GPR74 (also named NPFF2), which bind other members of the RFamide peptide family. Of particular interest is the potential effect of Kp on GPR147. GPR147 is a Gi coupled receptor and its stimulation leads to a decrease of cAMP with a general inhibitory effect on cell activity. In a CHO cell line transfected with GPR147, Kp10 and Kp54 were able to reduce the forskolin-induced increase of intracellular cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner (Oishi et al., 2011). Considering that KISS1R is expressed in the vast majority of GnRH neurons and that the presence or functional activity of GPR147 has been reported in a sizable population of GnRH neurons (Kriegsfeld et al., 2006; Ducret et al., 2010; Rizwan et al., 2012; Ubuka et al., 2012) it is likely that these two receptors co-exist in at least a subpopulation of GnRH neurons. No studies have yet been specifically designed to address how simultaneous stimulation of these two receptors by Kp may affect GnRH secretion. Results obtained using explants of the mediobasal hypothalamus of KISS1R KO mice tend to suggest that Kp mostly acts through KISS1R (d'Anglemont de Tassigny et al., 2008). However, these experiments were designed to measure an increase of GnRH secretion and a possible effect of Kp acting through GPR147 to decrease GnRH secretion could have been overlooked. This finding adds further complexity to the possible cellular mechanisms responsible for Kp action and future studies are necessary to shed more light on the importance, if any, of GPR147-mediated action of Kp on GnRH neurons.

### 4. KISS1R and its interacting proteins

In the last ten years a growing body of evidence has pointed to the importance of GPCR interacting proteins in the overall function

![Figure 1](attachment://image.png)

**Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the intracellular signaling cascade activated by Kp in rodent GnRH neurons. The binding of Kp to KISS1R triggers Gq/11 activation that stimulates the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of PIP2 into DAG and IP3. DAG recruits and activates PKC that initiates the kinase cascade leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation. IP3, by interacting with its cognate receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum, induces the release of Ca²⁺ from the intracellular store. The rise of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration has a stimulatory effect on PKC and an inhibitory effect on K⁺ current. The inhibitory effect on K⁺ current could be twofold: direct on Kir and indirect by heterologous desensitization of GABAB receptor. An additional effect of the increase of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, combined with the increase in DAG, is the opening of TRPC. Cations flowing in through TRPC further depolarize the membrane leading to opening of VGCC. This additional increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration stimulates RyR-mediated release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular store. A contribution of Na⁺ TTX to Kp-induced cell depolarization is possible but remain controversial. Data used to draw this scheme were gathered using rodent models. Results were obtained by applying different experimental techniques (electrophysiology on identified GnRH neurons, GnRH release from hypothalamic explant, Ca²⁺ imaging).

of GPCRs. These protein could influence spatial and temporal regulation of expression, trafficking, ligand binding, and signaling (Milligan and White, 2001; Hall and Lefkowitz, 2002; Kreienkamp, 2002; Bockaert et al., 2004; Romero et al., 2011). Recent methodological advances make possible the identification of protein complexes that interact directly or indirectly with the receptor of interest (Daulat et al., 2009, 2013). For the KISS1R also, in addition to heterotrimeric G protein, many accessory interacting proteins have been identified.

### 4.1. GRK2 and β-arrestins-1 and -2

Important proteins associated with KISS1R are the GPCR serine/threonine kinase (GRK) 2 and β-arrestins-1 and -2. These proteins were shown to regulate KISS1R signaling in HEK293 cells as well as in breast cancer derived MDA MB-231 cells (Pampillo et al., 2009). In these cellular models, KISS1R is constitutively associated with GRK2 and β-arrestins-1 and -2. This association is mediated by sequences in the second intracellular loop and the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. The competition of GRK2 with Gαq/11 for the binding site on the second intracellular loop could represent a potential way for desensitizing KISS1R-Gαq/11 intracellular signaling through a phosphorylation independent mechanism. Such an effect could be associated to the potential inhibitory effect of GRK2 on Gαq/11 activation of phospholipase Cβ (Carman et al., 1999).

### 4.2. Other KISS-1R partners

In contrast with many GPCRs (Romero et al., 2011), KISS1R contains neither PDZ domain nor PDZ-interacting motifs. Conversely, the C-terminal part of KISS1R contains sequences related to SH3 binding motifs, suggesting that signaling proteins bearing an SH3 domain may physically associate with this portion of KISS1R (Evans et al., 2008). Indeed, the C-terminus of KISS1R interacts with the catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase PP2A (Evans et al., 2008). Curiously, analyses of PP2A subunits show the presence of the PP2A-B regulatory subunit with PP2A-C but not with the PP2A-A scaffolding subunit, usually associated to the PP2A-C (Janssens et al., 2005). The association of an active Ser/Thr protein phosphatase with the KISS1R could participate in regulation of the activity of the receptor itself or in the functionality of members of its signaling cascade.

The use of a tandem affinity purification strategy in HEK-293 cells transfected with the KISS1R allowed the isolation of KISS1R protein complexes and the identification of several novel interacting proteins (Wacker et al., 2008). In this study, the authors showed that the L148S mutation in the second intracellular loop of human KISS1R, known to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in humans (Seminara et al., 2003), does not modify the protein interactome of KISS1R, but directly impairs G-protein activation by inhibiting the dissociation of the Gβγ subunits. Hence, the function of the newly identified interacting proteins in modulating KISS1R signaling remains to be elucidated.

### 4.3. KISS1R hetero-oligomerization

The hetero-oligomerization of GnRHR and KISS1R has been observed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in a heterologous expression system (HEK-293 cells). An increase in BRET signal was observed after stimulation with Kp-10 or a GnRH agonist (Quaynor et al., 2007). Considering that the majority of GnRH neurons in rodents express KISS1R mRNA (Irwig et al., 2004; Messager et al., 2005; Herbison et al., 2010) but also GnRHR mRNA (Quaynor et al., 2007) these two receptors could therefore theoretically interact in a native system. Similar to other GPCRs in which hetero-oligomerization affects binding and/or signaling properties (Milligan, 2009; O’Dowd et al., 2011), the formation of GnRHR-KISS1R hetero-oligomers may alter signaling properties in response to Kp or GnRH and contribute to the integration of the regulation of the GnRH neuronal activity (Quaynor et al., 2007). Although evidence for heterodimerization of KISS1R with any other receptor is still scarce there is at least a precedent since KISS1R appears to transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through a direct interaction (Zajac et al., 2011).

In conclusion, KISS1R has several partners which could be envisioned as an endogenous toolkit to modulate Kp signaling and participate in the dynamic regulation of KISS1R, but our understanding of their roles is at present very incomplete. The major hurdle in probing the physiological role of KISS1R partners is that protein-protein interactions are very often dynamic and transient processes and are therefore extremely difficult to study in any native system.

## 5. Kisspeptin in the timing of daily and seasonal reproduction

### 5.1. Circadian gating of the GnRH/LH surge in female rodents

Female rodents do not display random timing of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge which triggers ovulation. The preovulatory surge always precedes the onset of the daily activity bout and is tightly coordinated with estrus behavior to ensure maximal reproductive success. This remarkable adaptive feature has been demonstrated by classical work in rats (Everett and Sawyer, 1950; Legan et al., 1975; Legan and Karsch, 1975) and hamsters (Norman et al., 1973), which collectively showed that the coincidence between high levels of circulating estradiol – attained on the day of proestrus – and a specific daily neural signal is required to time the pre-ovulatory GnRH surge. This interactive phenomenon is unmasked in estradiol-replaced ovariectomized females, which then exhibit a daily surge in LH due to constantly high levels of estradiol (Legan and Karsch, 1975).

Extensive lesion/grafing experiments led to the unambiguous identification of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus as the main circadian clock in mammals, regulating most daily rhythms including the control of the LH surge (Swann and Turek, 1985; Lucas et al., 1999; Meyer-Bernstein et al., 1999; Kalsbeek et al., 2010). The GnRH neuron is unlikely to be the site at which the positive feedback effect of estradiol operates since it does not express the estrogen nuclear receptor ERα, the crucial subtype involved in triggering the GnRH surge (Wintermantel et al., 2006). The SCN themselves do not express significant levels of ERα receptors (Karatsoreos and Silver, 2007; Vida et al., 2008). Although the SCN sends direct VIP-ergic projections onto GnRH neurons (Van der Beek et al., 1997), these seem dispensable to the proper timing of the surge (Christian and Moenter, 2010; Williams and Kriegsfeld, 2012). In contrast, there is clear in vivo (Palm et al., 1999, 2001; Kalsbeek et al., 2010) and ex vivo (Funabashi et al., 2000) evidence that rhythmic arginine vasopressin (AVP) release by projections arising from the dorso-medial part of the SCN play a prominent role in the control of various daily rhythms, including the occurrence of the GnRH surge (Kalsbeek et al., 2010). The Avp gene is a bona fide target of the SCN molecular clock (Jin et al., 1999) and as such displays marked circadian oscillation in mRNA and protein levels in multiple species with peak levels during the mid to late afternoon (Dardente et al., 2004). Furthermore, efferent AVP-containing projections from the SCN mostly target nearby hypothalamic nuclei including the AVPV (Abrahamson and Moore, 2001) and there is clear evidence that the AVPV is the primary site of estradiol positive feed-back in rodents (Wintermantel et al., 2006; Herbison, 2008; Clarkson and Herbison, 2009; Christian and Moenter, 2010).

account the facts that Kp neurons of the AVPV express ERα, are activated by estrogen, show marked sexual dimorphism in their numbers and project to GnRH neurons, they appear well positioned to be the missing link between the circadian clock of the SCN and GnRH neurons of the POA.

Recent data from mice and Syrian hamsters provide strong support for such a model: a large proportion of AVPV Kp neurons indeed receive input from the AVP-containing part of the SCN (Vida et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2011; Smarr et al., 2012), Kiss1 expression is rhythmic with highest mRNA levels observed concomitantly with the time of maximal AVP output from the SCN (Robertson et al., 2009; Smarr et al., 2012), the transcriptional rhythm of the Kiss1 gene is blunted in OVX animals which do not exhibit a surge (Robertson et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2011) and, finally, Kp neurons are rhythmically activated, as assessed by FOS ICC, with time of maximal activation matching the time of the GnRH surge (Adachi et al., 2007; Robertson et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2011). To summarize (also see Fig. 2), it appears that the SCN exerts both direct (through VIP efferences) and indirect (through AVP efferences and Kp) control over GnRH neurons to achieve proper timing of the GnRH surge (de la Iglesia and Schwartz, 2006; Clarkson and Herbison, 2009; Christian and Moenter, 2010; Khan and Kauffman, 2012; Simonneaux et al., 2012; Williams and Kriegsfeld, 2012).

Even though the SCN undoubtedly plays a major role, it is now established that circadian clocks are indeed present in virtually every central and peripheral tissue and that every single cell might indeed be an autonomous and self-sustained circadian oscillator. In less than two decades, our understanding of the role of the SCN has evolved from that of the “one and only circadian clock”, imparting rhythmicity throughout the body to that of the “synchronizing leader of a pack of distributed oscillators”. This has far-reaching consequences as it implies that individual tissues play an active role in the control of local circadian physiology and are potentially able to respond differently to various cues at different times of the day (i.e.

circadian gating). Indeed, the ongoing process of engineering genetically modified murine strains with selective ablation of the circadian clock in a given tissue (e.g. liver, retina, pancreas, adrenal gland) has already provided full support to this notion (Dibner et al., 2010; Welsh et al., 2010; Lowrey and Takahashi, 2011; Mohawk et al., 2012). In this respect, the HPG axis is no exception since conclusive evidence for the presence and rhythmic expression of clock genes has been provided for the GnRH neurons themselves (Chappell et al., 2009), the adenohypophysis (Bonnefont, 2010) and various parts of the female reproductive tract, including the ovary (Sellix and Menaker, 2010). There is also evidence that the clock-controlled gene Dbp (Xu et al., 2011) and several over clock components (Smarr et al., 2013) are expressed in the AVPV and may control the rhythmic expression of Kiss1.

The presence of such “local” clocks may help explain why AVP injection directly within the POA of the rat stimulates an LH surge in the evening but not in the morning (Palm et al., 2001; Smarr et al., 2013). Likewise, Williams et al. (2011) found that icv injection of AVP during the evening, but not early in the day, was able to activate GnRH neurons. On the other hand, since AVP-mediated activation of Kp neurons was similar at both time points, these data are compatible with a mechanism of circadian gating of the response to AVP at the level of the GnRH neuron but not at the level of the Kp neurons.

However, definitive evidence that a physiologically relevant clock exists at the level of Kp neurons of the AVPV or within GnRH neurons themselves is still lacking. The availability of a mouse strain carrying a floxed allele of the crucial circadian clock component Bmal1 (Lamia et al., 2008) and GnRH-Cre or Kiss-Cre (Cravo et al., 2011) recombinase-driver mouse lines should make it possible to directly address this question. Such a strategy has indeed recently been used to specifically knock-out the circadian clock of the gonadotropes (Chu et al., 2013) and demonstrated that this clock is not required for the proper timing of the LH surge.

**Fig. 2. Schematic summary of the circadian control of the pre-ovulatory GnRH surge in rodents.** The circadian clock located within the hypothalamic SCN receives photic information and temporally coordinates the release of VIP directly onto GnRH neurons and that of AVP onto Kp neurons located in the AVPV. Upon combined stimulation by AVP from the SCN and E2 the latter release Kp onto GnRH neurons to trigger the pre-ovulatory surge of GnRH/LH. Concomitantly, the inhibitory effect exerted by RFRP3 released by Rfrp-expressing neurons of the DMH relaxes, which facilitates Kp stimulation. Note that Kp cells within the MBH do not seem to play a major role and are therefore indicated in light gray and broken lines.

The reproductive phenotype of mouse strains systemically inactivated for individual clock genes ranges from normal to sterile; there is a certain degree of genetic redundancy within the molecular clock and knocking-out simultaneously paralogous genes predictably worsens the phenotype (Boden and Kennaway, 2006; Boden et al., 2010; Yu and Weaver, 2011). Finally, direct interaction between the molecular circadian clock circuitry and estrogen signaling is also possible since the ERα was found to dimerize with the protein products of the canonical circadian clock genes Clock (Li et al., 2012) and Per2 (Gery et al., 2007), although the latter finding could not be replicated by others (Schmutz et al., 2010). Altogether, these data demonstrate that circadian clocks not only within the SCN, but most likely also elsewhere along the HPG axis are important to properly time reproduction.

On another note, in spite of the fact that GnRH neurons do express KISS1R, evidence gathered in the goat suggests that the number of direct contacts between Kp efferents and GnRH neurons is rather limited (Matsuyama et al., 2011; Pinilla et al., 2012). Akin to repeated observations that only a small fraction of GnRH neurons (10% or less) is sufficient to maintain reproductive activity (e.g. (Mayer and Boehm, 2011), it is nevertheless plausible that such a low occurrence of contacts might still prove sufficient for the control of GnRH by Kp. Alternatively, this observation may indicate that “relay cells” exist between Kp efferents and GnRH neurons. If true, such cells would be well placed to “invert” the Kp signal, i.e. turning it from excitatory to inhibitory. This may perhaps help explain why diurnal and nocturnal rodents exhibit an opposite phasing of GnRH neurons activation and GnRH surge (Mahoney et al., 2004) in spite of having an identical phasing of their SCN clock and AVP output (Dardente et al., 2004; Challet, 2007). Alternatively, the difference might be found at the level of the AVPV: if AVP efferents were to connect excitatory instead of inhibitory neurons, then Kp neurons might be differentially activated between diurnal and nocturnal rodents. This is exactly what occurs for the control of the daily corticosterone rhythm (Kalsbeek et al., 2008). Indeed, at least in the mouse, the difference may lie at the level of Kp cells themselves since two distinct Kp populations have been identified within the AVPV, which co-express either Glu or GABA (Cravo et al., 2011; Kallo et al., 2012). In this species, and in stark contrast to the case of the goat mentioned above (Matsuyama et al., 2011), there is evidence that a large proportion of GnRH neurons receive direct input from Kp neurons (Kallo et al., 2012).

Although there are significant species-differences regarding its exact role, the neuropeptide RFRP3, produced by neurons located in the DMH and VMH, has emerged as a potential negative modulator of the gonadotropic axis, potentially counterbalancing the stimulatory effect of Kp (Khan and Kauffman, 2012; Simonneaux and Ancel, 2012; Tsutsui et al., 2012; Williams and Kriegsfeld, 2012). The neuropeptide RFRP3 is able to reduce the activation of both GnRH neurons and unidentified neurons of the AVPV at the time of the pre-ovulatory GnRH surge in rats (Anderson et al., 2009) and the relative number and activity of neurons expressing the Rfrp precursor in the Syrian hamster were lowest at the time of the GnRH surge. These findings suggest that a timely coordination between enhanced Kp stimulatory inputs and reduced RFRP3 inhibitory inputs may be at play to yield the GnRH surge (Gibson et al., 2008). Data in sheep appear broadly consistent with this model (Smith et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 2012). Finally, although the SCN do indeed project to the DMH (e.g. (Abrahamson and Moore, 2001) it remains to be determined if direct connections with Rfrp-expressing neurons exist. Conversely, projections from Rfrp-expressing neurons onto the VIP-containing part of the SCN have recently been demonstrated (Acosta-Galvan et al., 2011).

Finally, what is known regarding the mechanisms and neural sites responsible for the control of the pre-ovulatory GnRH surge

in rodents may not be transposable to other species. For instance in sheep, although there are data supporting a rodent-like mechanism (Hoffman et al., 2011) with a preponderant role for the POA (neuroanatomically similar to the rodent rostral peri-ventricular region), most data are consistent with a combined contribution from the ventromedial hypothalamus/ARC region and the POA (Moenter et al., 1993; Merkley et al., 2012) or even from the ventromedial hypothalamus/ARC region alone (Carty et al., 1998, 2010). However, because these studies relied on the use of different protocols, technical approaches and biological markers, a direct comparison might be inadequate and probably explains part of the discrepancies. Taken together, the evidence nevertheless suggests overt differences between rodent and sheep models in the control of the pre-ovulatory GnRH surge. Likewise, the evidence for a circadian control of the GnRH surge in the ovine is at best scarce (Fabre-Nys et al., 1984; Christian and Moenter, 2010) and estradiol-replaced ovariectomized ewes do not display a daily GnRH surge (Karsch and Foster, 1975). The putative selective advantage such a precise timing would confer to a large grazing ruminant is not readily obvious and may explain, at least in part, why sheep do not appear to possess such a circadian gating of the LH surge.

### 5.2. Seasonal control of reproduction

Most species inhabiting at temperate latitudes exhibit recurrent annual cycles in physiology primarily driven by the photoperiod. This allows species such as hamsters or sheep to precisely time reproduction so that offspring are born when environmental conditions are most favorable for their survival. As a consequence of differing gestational durations, sheep breed from late summer until early winter (i.e. sheep are short-day breeders) while hamsters breed during spring and summer (i.e. hamsters are long-day breeders). The neuroendocrine mechanisms mediating the seasonal swings in the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins or prolactin require the pineal gland hormone melatonin and, due to a direct control by the SCN, the duration of melatonin secretion is proportional to the length of the night. Melatonin therefore provides its target tissues with both a circadian and a seasonal message (Goldman, 2001). Although the pivotal role of melatonin in seasonal reproduction had been disclosed long ago, the pathways and mechanisms linking it to changes in GnRH secretion have remained quite elusive until recently.

As the most potent GnRH secretagogue ever discovered, it seemed plausible that Kp could be implicated in seasonal reproduction. The first evidence that KiSS1 is indeed a melatonin-controlled gene involved in seasonal reproduction was obtained in the male Syrian hamster (Revel et al., 2006). Kp levels in the ARC are (i) higher in long photoperiod (LP) – sexually active – animals than in short photoperiod (SP) animals but (ii) similar in LP and SP-refractory animals, which show a spontaneous reactivation of the reproductive axis upon prolonged SP exposure, (iii) pinealectomy prevents the SP-induced decrease in Kp expression and (iv) Kp infusion to SP Syrian hamster is sufficient to reactivate the gonadal axis (Revel et al., 2006; Ansel et al., 2011). Further work revealed that Kp levels in the ARC and AVPV are diminished under SP in both sexes (Ansel et al., 2010). Importantly, data using pinealectomized animals or melatonin injection protocols support the notion that the photoperiodic message carried by melatonin impacts specifically Kp neurons of the ARC, leading to changes in the sex steroid milieu that are in turn responsible for the photoperiodic changes observed in the AVPV (Ansel et al., 2010).

Data in sheep, a short-day breeder, are also consistent with a role for the ARC population of Kp neurons in the seasonal control of the reproductive axis: Kp levels in the ARC are higher under SP (breeding season) than under LP (Smith et al., 2007, 2008; Wagner et al., 2008) while no photoperiodic variation is found in

the POA (Smith et al., 2008). Similar to what was reported for the Syrian hamster, an infusion of Kp during anoestrus reactivates the gonadal axis and triggers ovulation provided it lasts long enough (Caryat et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2009). Again, similar to rodents, sex steroids exert negative feedback onto Kp neurons of the ARC but the photoperiodic control over Kp in this region is largely independent of sex steroids (Smith and Clarke, 2010; Simonneaux et al., 2012; Smith, 2012). Collectively, data in the Syrian hamster and sheep are consistent with a role for Kp neurons of the ARC in the control of seasonal reproduction but also demonstrate that the same melatonin message can lead to opposite reproductive states in different species.

Data from another long-day breeding rodent, the Siberian hamster, appear at first glance difficult to reconcile with the aforementioned model. In this species, levels of Kp in the ARC are unexpectedly higher under SP than under LP in males (Greives et al., 2007; Simonneaux et al., 2009) and females (Mason et al., 2007). The number of detectable Kp neurons in the AVPV is much higher under LP than under SP and manipulation of testosterone levels suggest that the positive effect of testosterone is especially potent in the Siberian hamster (Greives et al., 2008). Finally, Kp injection induces LH secretion in both LP and SP animals of both genders (Greives et al., 2007, 2011). Thus there are both similarities and differences between species of hamsters. However, considering that the effect of sex steroids is “super-imposed” on that of photoperiod in the ARC, varying degrees of sensitivity to their feedback may help explain the observed differences (Simonneaux et al., 2012).

It seems important to mention that RFRP3 may also help explain part of the discrepancies in the literature. *Rfrp* is also a melatonin-driven gene which displays much higher mRNA levels under LP than SP in both Siberian and Syrian hamsters (Revel et al., 2008). In sheep, in spite of rather constant mRNA levels (less than 20% higher under LP than SP) (Dardente et al., 2008) it has been found that the number of RFRP3 inputs onto GnRH neurons varies with season in a manner consistent with its proposed role as an inhibitor of the gonadotropic axis (Clarke et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2008). In a very recent twist, two studies in the Syrian (Ancel et al., 2012) and Siberian hamsters (Ubuka et al., 2012) showed that RFRP3 can indeed be either stimulatory or inhibitory depending on when it is applied. Considering that chronic icv infusion of RFRP3 in the presence of persisting photoinhibitory conditions is accompanied by an increase in the number of detectable Kp cells in the ARC it has further been proposed that the stimulatory effect of RFRP3 may be explained by an effect on Kp cells (Ancel et al., 2012). Considering that the cognate RFRP3 receptor, GPR147, is coupled to a Gi protein, such an effect is most likely indirect. Clearly, more work is required to understand how these two populations interact, if they actually do (Khan and Kauffman, 2012; Simonneaux and Ancel, 2012; Smith, 2012; Tsutsui et al., 2012; Williams and Kriegsfeld, 2012).

How do we connect photoperiodic changes in melatonin secretion and photoperiodic changes in Kiss1 expression within the ARC? The ARC in itself is not a target for melatonin since it does not express the high-affinity MT1 melatonin receptor, which is crucial for the seasonal response (Dardente, 2007; Li et al., 2011). Although there are species-specific sites of MT1 expression within the medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH), such as the dorso-medial hypothalamus (DMH) in the Syrian hamster (Weaver et al., 1989; Maywood et al., 1996) or the pre-mammillary hypothalamus in

Fig. 3. Schematic summary of the seasonal control of the gonadotropic axis in mammals. The circadian clock located within the hypothalamic SCN receives photoperiodic information and controls the production of melatonin whose pattern reflects the duration of the dark period. The duration of the melatonin signal is decoded through a circadian-based mechanism present in the thyrotropic cells of the PT, which leads to heightened TSH output under long days. TSH then acts through its Gs-coupled TSH receptor located on tanycytes (not mentioned here for clarity) which line the basal aspect of the third ventricle to induce transcription of the cAMP responsive Dio2 gene. This leads to enhanced production of DIO2 and a local increase of T3 concentration within the MBH. Populations of Kp neurons within the ARC and Rfrp-producing neurons within the DMH both show photoperiod-dependent control of their expression (albeit with species-differences, see text), which indicates that the long-day increase in T3 eventually impinges on them to govern GnRH release and seasonal reproduction. Question marks indicate that sites (Kp neurons and/or Rfrp neurons and/or GnRH terminals of the ME) and mechanisms (transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional and/or plasticity) of action of T3 remain to be clarified in mammals. Note that Kp cells within the AVPV do not seem to play a major role and are therefore indicated in light gray and broken lines. Also note that potential (i) interactions between RFRP3 cells of the DMH and Kp cells of the ARC and (ii) effect of melatonin at the level of the RFRP3 cells of the DMH are not indicated for the sake of clarity.

the sheep (Malpaux et al., 2001), the only structure displaying consistently high expression of the MT1 receptor in all mammals studied to date is the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary. There is indeed compelling evidence for the implication of this endocrine tissue in the seasonal control of prolactin (Dardente, 2007; Dupre, 2011) and gonadotropins (Dardente, 2012). The photoperiodic control of gonadotropins has been known to depend on thyroid hormone signaling for decades but no mechanism was forthcoming. Recent data gathered in quail, hamsters and sheep have led to the identification of a cascade of events which link melatonin input to the PT to the seasonal control of thyroid hormone signaling within the MBH (Hazlerigg and Loudon, 2008; Dardente, 2012; Hazlerigg, 2012; Ikegami and Yoshimura, 2012; Simonneaux et al., 2012).

Melatonin acts within the PT to reset a circadian oscillator, which is responsible for the seasonal control of thyrotropin (TSH) output through an external coincidence model that involves the clock-controlled genes Tef and Eya3 (Dardente et al., 2010). A long photoperiod activates production of TSH, which then acts on its receptors within the MBH – particularly on tanycytes lining the third ventricle – to trigger cAMP increase and subsequent transcriptional activation of the iodothyronine deiodinase Type II (Dio2) gene. The product of this gene, the enzyme Deiodinase 2 converts thyroxine (T4) to 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3) and therefore activates thyroid hormone signaling within the MBH under long days (Hanon et al., 2008, 2010, Nakao et al., 2008). In a striking parallel, the opposite photoperiodic control (i.e. increased levels under SP compared to LP) is exerted over Dio3, a deiodinase responsible for the inactivation of T3. Such a dual control of Dio2/Dio3 predicts a very tight control of T3 levels within the MBH (Nakao et al., 2008; Saenz de Miera et al., 2013). Finally, recent data gathered in both Siberian and Syrian hamsters show that intracerebroventricular injection of TSH in sexually quiescent hamsters is sufficient to mimic the long day effect as it drives appropriate changes in the expression of Kiss1 and Rfrp and further leads to reactivation of the gonads (Klosen et al., 2013).

To conclude, these data unequivocally implicate the PT as a crucial component of the photoperiodic control of reproduction (see Figs. 3 and 4). However, several key questions remain unanswered. First of all, how do we connect changes in thyroid hormone production within the MBH to the seasonal changes in Kiss1 and Rfrp expression? Several, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms of T3 action are possible: a direct action onto Kp cells, an indirect effect through cells ultimately impinging on Kp cells or a plasticity-mediated effect at the level of the GnRH terminals within the ME, as demonstrated in the quail (Yamamura et al., 2006). Second, since the PT-dependent mechanism described above systematically leads to an increase in T3 under LP, how can it lead to a species-specific increase (Syrian hamster) or decrease (sheep and Siberian hamster) in Kiss1 expression? A role for different levels of sex steroid feed-back has been proposed but further data are required to substantiate this assertion. Third, how are the Kp and Rfrp systems connected and what is the exact nature of their cross-talk, if any? In this respect, a role for other hypothalamic nuclei is possible. In particular, melatonin receptors within the DMH of the Syrian hamster, where Rfrp-expressing neurons are also located, may help explain the prominent seasonal variation of Rfrp expression in this species. However, worthy of note is the fact that the Siberian hamster also displays marked seasonal variations of Rfrp expression (Revel et al., 2008) even though the presence of melatonin receptors in the DMH of this species is not conspicuous (Weaver et al., 1989).

### 6. Conclusion

Within a decade our understanding of the hypothalamic control of reproduction has matured considerably. The identification of the RF-amide neuropeptide Kp as a higher-order point of control of GnRH neurons has provided decisive insights into previously unanswerable questions. Kp appears implicated in virtually all facets of reproduction, from the initiation of puberty to the daily and seasonal control of reproduction. Such a discovery has obvious potential applications in human medicine for the treatment of a broad array of reproductive defects and pathologies. The development of alternative methods for the control of reproduction in farm animals is also expected. The engineering of new agonists and antagonists of KISS1R signaling therefore holds great promises and represents a major endeavor. A much more thorough picture of the desensitization mechanisms, protein interactome and intracellular signaling pathways of KISS1R is yet to be obtained before such a goal can be reached. The recent discovery of another RF-amide peptide, RFRP3, which appears to act either as an inhibitor or an activator of the gondotropic axis depending on the species and the physiological status of the individual, will also require renewed attention. Data are certainly compatible with the view that Kp and RFRP3 systems somehow overlap and jointly act to govern reproduction. The exact nature and extent of this possible interplay await clarification. Furthermore, aside from its role within the hypothalamus, Kiss and Kiss1r expression has been reported in other parts of the brain and also in peripheral tissues, including the gonads (this indeed also applies to Rfrp and its receptor); the potential roles of Kp (and RFRP3) in these tissues remain enigmatic. Great strides in our understanding of the neuroendocrine control of reproduction have been made over the last decade; we can almost certainly forecast at least another decade of excitement and unexpected discoveries.
