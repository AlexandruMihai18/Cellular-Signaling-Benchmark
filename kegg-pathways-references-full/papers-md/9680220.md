Summary

The majority of characterized bacterial dipeptide permeases (Dpp) are membrane-associated complexes of five proteins belonging to the ABC-transporter family. They have been found to be involved in the uptake of essential amino acids, haem production, chemotaxis and sporulation. A 5.8 kb genomic DNA fragment of the serotype M49 group A streptococcal (GAS) strain CS101 was sequenced and found to contain five putative GAS Dpp genes (dppA to dppE). Deduced amino acid sequences exhibited 17–54% similarity to corresponding ABC-transporter sequences. The operon organization of the five genes was confirmed by transcriptional analysis, and a shorter, more abundant, dppA-only transcript was detected similar to that found in the GAS oligopeptide permease (Opp) system. Insertional inactivation was used to create serotype M2 and M49 strains that did not express the dppD and dppE ATPase genes or nearly the entire operon. In feeding experiments with di- to hexapeptides, the wild-type strain grew with each peptide tested. The dpp mutants were unable to grow on dipeptides, whereas hexapeptides did not sustain the growth of opp mutants. Expression of the dpp operon was induced approximately fourfold in late exponential growth phase. In addition, a striking increase in the dppA to dppA–E ratio from 5:1 to more than 20:1 occurred during late exponential growth phase in complex medium. Growth in chemically defined medium (CDM) supplemented with various dipeptides specifically induced the expression of dpp and reduced both the dppA to dppA–E and oppA to oppA–F mRNA ratios. Expression of the virulence factor SpeB (major cysteine protease) was reduced eightfold in dpp mutants, whereas dpp expression was decreased about fourfold in a Mga virulence regulator mutant. Taken together, these data indicate a correlation between levels of intracellular essential amino acids and the regulation of virulence factor expression.

## Introduction

Dipeptide uptake transporters have been described in a few Gram-negative (Elliot, 1993; Verkamp, 1993) and Gram-positive (Mathiopoulos et al., 1991; Hagting et al., 1994; Foucaud et al., 1995; Nakajima et al., 1997) bacteria. Unlike oligopeptide permeases (Opps), the dipeptide transporters are structurally and functionally diverse. Some dipeptide transporters, such as the dipeptide permeases (Dpps) of Escherichia coli (Abouhamad and Manson, 1994) and Bacillus subtilis (Mathiopoulos et al., 1991), belong to the ABC-transporter family (Higgins, 1995). Based on structural and sequence similarities to five-protein Opp complexes, such Dpp systems comprise complexes of four or five potentially membrane-associated proteins in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms respectively. DppA exhibits strong structural homology to the substrate-binding OppA proteins, which are periplasmic proteins in Gram-negative bacteria and membrane-associated lipoproteins in Gram-positive bacteria. DppB and DppC are transmembrane proteins that are proposed to be involved in the transport of substrates across the cytoplasmic membrane. DppD and DppE are probably inner membrane-associated ATPases that provide energy for uptake of the substrates. The genes encoding the permease complex are organized as an operon, with the dppA gene located either upstream or downstream of the dppB to dppE genes, which are encoded in a block.

Other dipeptide transport systems are represented by the lactococcal DtpP system, which is uncharacterized on a genetic level (Foucaud et al., 1995), or by single proteins such as the DtpT proteins of Lactococcus lactis (Hagting et al., 1994) and Lactobacillus helveticus (Nakajima et al., 1997). Dipeptide permeases transport a wide variety of L-amino acid-containing dipeptides and some tripeptides (Abouhamad et al., 1991; Olson et al., 1991). The lactococcal transporters accept di- and tripeptides with similar efficiencies.

Besides providing a bacterial cell with dipeptides as a source of essential amino acids or nitrogen and energy, Dpp has been shown to be involved in the *E. coli* haem synthesis by facilitating uptake of the 5-aminolaevulinic acid precursor molecule (Elliot, 1993; Verkamp *et al.*, 1993), in peptide-directed chemotaxis of *E. coli* (Manson *et al.*, 1986) and induction of sporulation of *B. subtilis* (Mathiopoulos *et al.*, 1991; Slack *et al.*, 1993). So far, no influence on virulence factor expression has been observed for any characterized Dpp complex.

In *E. coli*, Dpp expression was demonstrated to be linked to growth, with a two-step increase in expression in early and late logarithmic growth phase (Abouhamad and Manson, 1994), and negatively affected by the global regulatory leucine-responsive protein Lrp in *Bradyrhizobium* (King and O’Brian, 1997). Also, in *B. subtilis*, Dpp was found to be maximally expressed as cells enter the stationary phase and repressed by the presence of glucose and various amino acids in the growth medium (Mathiopoulos *et al.*, 1991; Slack *et al.*, 1993). The proteins responsible for Dpp repression were identified as the AbrB and CodY regulators, which bind to the *dppA* promoter region and interact with the –35 and –10 boxes and the *dpp* operon transcription start site (Slack *et al.*, 1993; 1995; Serror and Sonenshein, 1996a). The CodY regulatory factor integrates Dpp repression with repression of genetic competence and the histidine utilization (*hut*) operon (Serror and Sonenshein, 1996b; Fisher *et al.*, 1996).

Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS) are important human pathogens expressing a variety of cell surface and secreted virulence factors. Among the secreted factors, the secreted cysteine protease SpeB is one of the major secreted proteins in terms of concentrations found in culture supernatants and plays a prominent role in promoting tissue invasiveness (Shanley *et al.*, 1996; Lukomski *et al.*, 1997). Tissue invasiveness could be a direct effect of SpeB on the human matrix protein fibronectin (Kapur *et al.*, 1993) or an indirect effect resulting from human matrix metalloprotease activation (Burns *et al.*, 1996). SpeB expression was found to be dependent on the global positive regulator Mga (Podbielski *et al.*, 1996a) and a functional Opp operon (Podbielski *et al.*, 1996b). On the basis of this Mga regulation, the *speB* gene is regarded as a member of the *vir* regulon. The *vir* regulon consists of a number of co-regulated *mga*-dependent virulence genes located either clustered together with the *mga* gene (core *vir* regulon) or at separate sites in the chromosome (Podbielski *et al.*, 1996a).

When examining GAS genomic fragments adjacent to the core *vir* regulon (Podbielski *et al.*, 1996a), a sequence that demonstrated similarity to other *opp* and *dpp* operons was detected. After examination of the transcriptional organization of this genomic locus, isogenic mutants were created in the ATPase genes to determine whether this

operon represented a potentially silent *opp* operon like the *B. subtilis app* operon (Koide and Hoch, 1994) or whether it encoded the dipeptide permease of GAS. Growth of the *dpp* mutants in various peptide-containing media provided evidence that the identified operon was, in fact, a dipeptide transporter that could supply the cell with essential amino acids. The activity of a predicted transcriptional attenuator between *dppA* and *dppB* was evidenced by the presence of a predominant *dppA*-only band upon Northern blot analysis of *dpp* transcription. Regulation of *dpp* was found at the level of operon induction as well as regulation of transcriptional attenuator activity. The transcription of *dpp* was found to be increased in late exponential growth phase and by growth of the cells on dipeptides in chemically defined medium. The ratio of *dppA* to *dppA–E* was highest in complex medium in late exponential growth phase, lower in chemically defined medium and the lowest in chemically defined medium with a single dipeptide amino acid source. Expression of *dpp* was also affected by the global virulence factor regulator, Mga. In turn, Dpp positively influenced cysteine protease SpeB expression, while having no effect on Opp expression. Taken together, these data support the concept of a link between nutritional pathways and the expression of virulence factors.

### Results

#### Sequence analysis of the GAS *dpp* locus

A chromosomal fragment of about 5.8 kb located approximately 4 kb downstream of the ORFX in the core *vir* regulon of GAS serotype M49 strain CS101 (Podbielski *et al.*, 1996a) was sequenced using a Lambda ZAP-Express genomic library and a genome walking sequencing strategy. The resulting sequence was analysed for open reading frames (ORFs) and signature sequences. Five predicted ORFs with diverse levels of homology to oligopeptide and dipeptide permease operons from GAS, other streptococci, *L. lactis*, *B. subtilis* and *E. coli* (Table 1) were identified. As in other *opp* and *dpp* operons, the putative *dppA* to *dppE* genes appeared to be arranged in a typical five-gene operon structure (Fig. 1).

Whereas the *oppD* and *oppF* ATPase-encoding sequences in *opp* operons share the highest homology between bacterial species, in the *dpp* operon, the transmembrane proteins *dppB* and *dppC* have the greatest homology. Overall sequence homologies did not differ significantly regardless of whether the compared sequences were derived from *opp* or *dpp* operons or whether they were derived from closely related Gram-positive strains or more distantly related Gram-negative sequences (Table 1).

The deduced amino acid sequences predicted proteins of 542 (DppA), 325 (DppB), 274 (DppC), 267 (DppD) and 208 (DppE) residues. Each sequence was 89–175 residues

The GAS DppA to DppE sequences were compared with the Dpp and Opp sequences of other bacteria. The percentage of identical amino acids and the percentage of identical plus similar amino acids (in brackets) were calculated using the PCGENE PALIGN program for pairwise alignments. The sources of the other sequences are shown in the right column.

smaller than the corresponding GAS Opp sequences (Podbielski et al., 1996b). The putative DppA was found to have an N-terminal leader peptide followed by a cysteine residue, as is typical of Gram-positive extracellular lipoproteins. The proteins DppB and DppC were predicted to have six and five transmembrane domains respectively. Both DppD and DppE contained a G A/Q SG S/C GK T/S signature sequence for ATPases of ABC transporters. As in the GAS opp operon, the dppB to dppE genes were either directly adjacent or overlapped by a few nucleotides,

The direction of transcription of the dppA to dppE genes is indicated by arrow direction. The inverted repeats between dppA and dppB and downstream of dppE, which form the putative transcriptional attenuator (ta) and transcriptional terminator (tt) sites, are indicated by the shaded boxes. The downstream genomic region is not drawn to scale, and the direction of transcription is indicated by the arrows. The region encompassing orfX, orf2, orf3 and 'lipo*' is a newly identified region. The encoded gene products, including a putative lipoprotein (lipo*), are currently under investigation. The core vir regulon region starts upstream of mga and ends at orfX. The virulence genes contained in the core vir regulon vary between M serotypes (Podbielski et al., 1995). In serotype M49, used in these studies, the entire vir regulon is approximately 9kb, and the genes are transcribed in the same orientation as mga. '//' indicates that the chromosomal location of the speB relative to this region is unknown.

whereas there was a non-coding stretch of 113 nucleotides between *dppA* and *dppB* (Fig. 1). Within this non-coding region, there is a 53 nucleotide region that is predicted to form a single complex stem–loop structure (87.7 kJ mol⁻¹) owing to the presence of several short inverted repeats (3–4 bp) separated from each other by a few basepairs. The predicted stem–loop is followed by a run of six U nucleotides, which could function as a Rho-independent transcriptional attenuator structure for *dppA* transcription. About 50 bp downstream of the putative *dppE* gene, there are two 16 bp boxes, which could form an additional stem–loop structure (86.2 kJ mol⁻¹), followed by a run of 10 U nucleotides that could serve as the Rho-independent transcriptional terminator of the entire *dpp* operon (Fig. 1). Approximately 50 bp upstream of *dppA*, a potential promoter was identified including the sequences for –35 and –10 boxes separated by 17 bp. The putative –10 box also exhibited some homology to the GAS *opp* –10 box and pneumococcal extended 10 boxes, which can support transcription in the absence of functional –35 boxes (Sabelnikov et al., 1995). In the 790 bp upstream of *dppA*, no additional ORFs larger than 40 codons were identified on either strand, and the sequence had no significant homology to any sequences in NCBI GenBank, as determined by BLASTX searching. Downstream of *dppE* and on the opposite strand, there is an operon that encodes a lipoprotein gene (A. Podbielski, unpublished data), followed by the core *vir* regulon (Fig. 1; Podbielski et al., 1996a).

The *dpp* operon was found in two other GAS M serotypes. Comparison of our sequence with the serotype M1 genome sequence in the 11 August, 1997 update of the University of Oklahoma Streptococcal Genome Sequencing Project (Roe et al., 1997) revealed a highly conserved (>99% identity) locus in the M1 sequence. Using primers (Table 2) directed to the potential *dppA*, *dppC* and *dppE* genes of a serotype M2 strain, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification products obtained were indistinguishable in size from the corresponding M49-derived products (data not shown). This suggests that a highly conserved *dpp* operon may be present in GAS.

### Transcriptional analysis of the GAS *dpp* operon

In order to confirm the operon structure of the GAS *dpp* genes and to gain information necessary for mutagenesis, *dpp* operon transcripts were analysed by Northern blotting. Probes directed to the *dppA* and *dppE* genes were used to detect specific transcripts in RNA preparations from late logarithmic cultures of M49 serotype strains grown in a rich complex medium (Todd–Hewitt yeast extract). With each probe, a faint 5.2 kb band was detected, which corresponded in size to the predicted polycistronic five-gene transcript starting at the putative promoter and ending at the transcriptional terminator ('tt' in Fig. 1; Fig. 2). An additional strong 1.9 kb band detected only with the *dppA* probe corresponded in size to a *dppA* message beginning at the same promoter as the polycistronic *dpp* transcript but ending at the stem–loop structure in the non-coding region between the *dppA* and *dppB* genes ('ta' in Fig. 1; Fig. 2). Based on serial dilution experiments, the *dppA*-specific transcript was >20-fold more abundant than the polycistronic *dpp* mRNA when cells were grown in complex medium (data not shown). No differences in the *dpp* transcription between RNA prepared from serotype M49 and M2 GAS strains was detected (data not shown).

#### Generation of GAS *dpp* and *opp* operon mutants

Different *opp* and *dpp* mutants were created to characterize the biological function of the *dpp* operon as well as to determine the inter-relationship of *dpp* and *opp* operon expression. Using pFW11-based insertion mutagenesis, the *dppA* and *dppD* genes of serotype M2 and M49 strains were disrupted. As a consequence, the only transcript detectable in the *dppA* mutants was truncated in the middle of *dppA* (data not shown). In the *dppD* mutants, the *dppA* mRNA was unaffected, but the polycistronic message was truncated to a size corresponding to transcription termination at the 5′ end of *dppD* (data not shown). A *dppE*-specific probe did not reveal any detectable transcripts with any *dpp* mutant (data not shown). A similar mutation was created by inserting a recombinant pSF152 plasmid into the *oppA* gene of a M49 serotype strain. Transcription analysis of the *oppA* mutants revealed the presence of a truncated

Oligonucleotides were used to PCR amplify GAS genomic fragments for cloning into insertion vectors pSF152 (A) or pFW11 (B) and as probes for Northern blot hybridization (C). Primer pairs oppAins FOR/REV, dppAins FOR/REV and dppDins FOR/REV were 5′ extended with *BamHI/HindIII* sites to facilitate forced cloning of the resulting PCR products. The nucleotide position numbers refer to the GAS *opp* sequence (Podbielski et al., 1996b) or to the GAS *dpp* sequence as submitted to GenBank.

free amino acid sources. To determine whether the GAS can also use peptides as essential amino acid sources and to assess the peptide size exclusion limits of the transporters, serotype M49 wild-type and *dpp* and *opp* mutant strains were grown in different formulations of a chemically defined medium (CDM; van de Rijn and Kessler, 1980). As determined by optical density, all strains tested exhibited approximately identical growth rates and reached similar culture densities when incubated overnight in complete CDM (data not shown). CDM deficient in the essential amino acids valine and isoleucine was prepared (deficient CDM; dCDM). The two amino acids were then supplemented in the form of free amino acids or isoleucine and valine containing di-, tri-, tetra- or hexapeptides (Fig. 3). The di-, tri-, tetra- and hexapeptides supported growth of both wild-type strains as well as that of an isogenic serotype M49 *speB* mutant, which was used to monitor peptide degradation by the predominant GAS cysteine protease, SpeB. Irrespective of the insertion location in the *dpp* operon, none of the *dpp* mutants grew in CDM containing valine/isoleucine dipeptides, but they did grow in CDM containing tri-, tetra- and hexapeptides. Conversely, the *opp* mutants grew in CDM supplemented with valine/isoleucine di-, tri- and tetrapeptides but not with the corresponding hexapeptides. As opposed to the *dppD* mutants incubated with a dipeptide amino acid source, *oppD* mutants exhibited weak growth in CDM plus hexapeptides after a prolonged incubation of 2–3 days. This result suggests that the OppD and OppF ATPase function can be complemented to some extent by other intracellular ATPases, while it did not appear to be feasible to compensate DppD and DppE ATPase function. Conversely, the delayed growth on hexapeptides could represent a gradual breakdown of the oligopeptides into Dpp-transportable dipeptides. In complex medium, where free amino acids and oligopeptides of various sizes are readily available, the growth rate of all isogenic mutants remained unaffected.

Specific messages were detected by Northern hybridization with DIG-labelled probes representing internal fragments of the *dppA* and *dppE* coding sequences. By comparison with the molecular weight markers, whose size is given beside each band, the size of the lower band was estimated to be approximately 1.9 kb, while the upper band was approximately 5.2 kb.

Incubation of the remaining culture was continued until the culture reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of between 0.8 and 0.9, and then total RNA from approximately 10<sup>10</sup> total cells was isolated. Dilutions of total RNA from the two ODs were separated by formaldehyde-MOPS agarose gel electrophoresis, and the amount in μg is indicated below each lane. Uniform loading of the gel was confirmed after electrophoresis by visual inspection of the ethidium bromide-stained RNA gel. The dot-blot begins with 2 μg of total RNA per dot, and the total RNA per dot in μg is given above each lane. Permease mRNAs were detected by Northern blotting with a DIG-labelled *oppA* or *dppA* internal probe (indicated below each gel). Results are representative of three individual experiments. Identical results were obtained regardless of whether the overnight culture was diluted 1:10 or 1:100 before regrowth.

Regulation of the *dpp* operon

It has been reported for *B. subtilis* that maximal expression of the *dpp* operon occurs in late logarithmic growth phase. To compare levels of *dpp* and *opp* transcription, total RNA was prepared from approximately 10<sup>10</sup> bacteria in either early or late exponential growth. The relative amount of specific transcript present per μg of total RNA was assessed by

two methods. Total *dpp* transcript per μg of total RNA was determined by dot-blotting of RNA dilutions followed by hybridization with a *dppA*-specific probe. To distinguish *dppA*-only transcripts and full-length operon transcripts, Northern blotting was performed on serial dilutions of total RNA.

In contrast to *opp* (Podbielski et al., 1996b), transcription of *dpp* per μg total RNA was increased approximately four- to eightfold (Fig. 4). This increase in total transcription was easier to visualize during dot-blot experiments because, in late exponential phase, the ratio of binding protein transcript to full-length operon transcripts was increased, resulting in a significantly stronger *dppA* or *oppA* band (Fig. 4). For *dppA*, this ratio appeared to shift from approximately 2:1 to >20:1 and can be clearly seen by comparing blots from Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, keeping in mind the blot from Fig. 2 contains 60 μg of total RNA, whereas the dilution series in Fig. 4 begins with 10 μg total RNA. The ratio of *oppA* to *oppA-F* also appeared to be increased, although the effect was not as dramatic as for the *dpp* operon.

Both the Dpp and the Opp complex were able to transport peptides containing essential amino acids for sustaining growth in amino acid-deficient CDM. Therefore, it could be proposed that, in complex medium, where both di- and oligopeptide transport can be used for scavenging essential amino acids, mutation in one transporter may be compensated for by increased expression of the remaining permease. Using Northern blot hybridization, *opp* and *dpp* mutants were screened for increased transcription of the remaining transporter by comparing specific transcript levels per μg of total RNA between mutants and wild-type strains grown in complex medium (Fig. 5). No detectable increase in *opp* expression was noted in the *dpp* mutant, and no detectable increases in *dpp* expression were found in the *opp* mutant.

During studies on cells grown in CDM, it was noted that the overall *dpp* operon transcription rate was increased when cells were grown in CDM (Fig. 6A), and the ratio of *dppA* to *dppA-E* transcript was significantly reduced in late exponential growth phase (compare Figs 2 and 4). Addition of dipeptides (IV, YI, YV and YG) induced the expression of the *dpp* operon but not the *opp* operon (Fig. 6; data not shown for YI, YV and YG). The addition of the single dipeptide sources also further reduced the ratio of *dppA* to *dppA-E* as well as reducing the ratio of *oppA* to *oppA-F* (Fig. 6).

Co-regulation of *dpp* and virulence factors

GAS *opp* expression in a global positive virulence factor regulator (Mga) insertion mutant was reduced approximately two- to fourfold compared with an isogenic wild-type control (Podbielski et al., 1996a). *dpp* expression in

this mutant was measured by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 7). Resembling the situation for $opp$ expression, it was found that $dpp$ mRNA was decreased by about four- to eightfold per $\mu \mathrm{g}$ of total RNA in the $mga$ mutant.

Group A streptococcal dipeptide permease 1329

It has been shown that the high-level expression of the major exoprotease, the cysteine protease SpeB, partially depended on a functional Opp complex (Podbielski et al., 1996b). In contrast, the expression of PrtP exoprotease in lactococci was reciprocally correlated with the presence of a functional Opp complex and independent of the presence of the DptT di-tripeptide permease (Juillard et al., 1995; Kunji et al., 1995). To assess the influence of Dpp function on GAS SpeB expression, the serotype M49 wild-type and an isogenic $dppA-E$ mutant strain were grown in complex THY medium to late logarithmic phase. SpeB expression was measured by quantitative Northern blot hybridization using serially diluted total RNA from the three strains. When the intensities of the $SpeB$ transcript-specific bands were compared, the $dpp$ mutants were found to contain eightfold less $speB$ mRNA per $\mu \mathrm{g}$ of total RNA than the wild-type strain (Fig. 7).

### Discussion

Bacterial dipeptide permeases are involved in nutritional pathways and associated processes such as chemotaxis and sporulation. However, the importance of such protein complexes as direct or indirect virulence factor regulators in pathogenic bacteria remains unknown. The present investigation had two major objectives: first, to characterize a potential dipeptide permease of GAS, and second, to examine its transcriptional regulation and its possible involvement in both nutrition and virulence.

A 5.8 kb genomic fragment lying downstream of and on the opposite strand from the GAS core $vir$ regulon of GAS, which co-ordinates the expression of several crucial virulence factors, was completely sequenced. When compared with sequences in the genetic databases, this fragment had the most significant identity with the five-gene $dpp$ operons. Consistent with its potential role as a peptide permease, insertion mutants constructed in this operon did not grow in a chemically defined medium in which the only source of the essential amino acids was dipeptides. These findings

Total cellular RNA was isolated from GAS serotype M49 wild type (M49wt), $dppA-dppE$ (M49dppAE) and $oppA-oppF$ (M49oppAF) isogenic mutants in late logarithmic growth phase. Dilutions of isolated RNA were separated by MOPS-formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis (lanes 1 and 4 contain $10 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of total RNA; lanes 2 and 6, $5 \mu \mathrm{g}$; lanes 3 and 7, $2.5 \mu \mathrm{g}$; lanes 4 and 8, $1.3 \mu \mathrm{g}$). Uniform loading of the gel was confirmed after electrophoresis by visual inspection of the ethidium bromide-stained RNA. Specific products were detected by Northern blotting with DIG-labelled, PCR-generated $dppA$ and $oppA$ internal probes. Blots containing RNA from M49dppAE were hybridized with the $oppA$ probe, and blots containing RNA from M49oppAF were hybridized with the $dpp$ probe. The results shown are representative of those from at least two independent RNA isolations.

probably originates from the single *dpp* operon promoter and is terminated by the attenuator/terminator site in the non-coding region between *dppA* and *dppB*. As already proposed by Abouhamad and Manson (1994) and Podbielski *et al.* (1996b), the relative overexpression of freely diffusible lipoprotein substrate-binding proteins to the rest of the transport machinery may allow for more efficient sequestration of substrate for uptake by the cell. The individual mechanisms for accomplishing this disproportionate gene expression vary between transport systems and bacterial species. In GAS, for both the *opp* and *dpp* operons, this is achieved by introducing an intraoperon transcription attenuator, although the effect is more pronounced for Dpp (>20-fold excess of *dppA* versus approximately fivefold excess of *oppA*). In *E. coli*, the *dppA–dppB* intergenic region does not appear to contain a transcriptional attenuator but instead a proposed mRNA-stabilizing RIP element downstream, which contributes to the relative abundance of the shorter message (Kashiwagi *et al.*, 1990; Abouhamad and Manson, 1994). In other streptococci and enterococci, additional substrate-binding proteins are encoded by separate monocistronically transcribed genes (Alloing *et al.*, 1994; Jenkinson *et al.*, 1996; Leonard *et al.*, 1996) and, in lactococci, *oppA* is transcribed from an additional promoter (Tynkkynen *et al.*, 1993).

The size of substrates transported by Dpp and Opp systems varies between species and is less stringent in Gram-negative bacteria than in Gram-positive bacteria (Gibson *et al.*, 1984; Hiles *et al.*, 1987; Abouhamad *et al.*, 1991; Abouhamad and Manson, 1994; Mathiopoulos *et al.*, 1991; Tynkkynen *et al.*, 1993; Jenkinson *et al.*, 1996). In the present study, two peptide ABC transporters were directly compared for their substrate size selectivity. As GAS are auxotrophic for 13 of 20 amino acids (Davies *et al.*, 1965), feeding experiments were performed by supplementing CDM depleted for the essential amino acids Ile and Val with Ile-Val-containing peptides of various sizes. The GAS Dpp was the only transporter for dipeptides, while the Opp complex was solely responsible for the uptake of hexapeptides. The uptake of tri- and tetrapeptides was observed in both *opp* and *dpp* mutants. The upper size limit for nutritionally effective oligopeptides could be influenced differentially by the presence of exoproteases produced by GAS. In the case of the di- to hexapeptides, an isogenic mutant of SpeB, the major and yet only characterized GAS exoprotease, had the same peptide feeding profile. Therefore, the growth of the *dpp* and *opp* mutants on tri- and tetrapeptides suggests that both *dpp* and *opp* can transport 3- and 4-mers or the presence of a third, unidentified transporter.

The results obtained with CDM clearly demonstrate that essential amino acids can be obtained from the transport of free amino acids, di- and hexapeptides. In GAS, the two peptide transport systems exhibit clearly different

Fig. 6. Effect of growth medium on the expression of the *dpp* operon. Dot-bLOTS containing twofold dilutions of total RNA isolated from late exponential growth phase cells grown in THY or CDM were probed with a DIG-labelled internal *dppA* probe. The amount of total RNA contained is indicated above each dot. The results are representative of those from at least two independent RNA isolations. GAS serotype M49 cells were grown in CDM, CDM depleted for I and V (dCDM) supplemented with 1 mg ml⁻¹ dipeptide (IV). Total RNA was isolated from late logarithmic growth phase cultures. Dilutions of total RNA were subjected to MOPS-formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis, and specific products were detected by Northern blotting. For the gel hybridized with the *dppA* internal probe, lanes 1 and 4 contain 10 μg of total RNA; lanes 2 and 6, 5 μg; lanes 3 and 7, 2.5 μg; lanes 4 and 8, 1.3 μg. For the gel hybridized with the *oppA* internal probe, lanes 1 and 4 contain 10 μg of total RNA, lanes 2 and 5, 5 μg, lanes 3 and 6, 1.3 μg. Uniform loading was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of the agarose gel. DIG-labelled *dppA* and *oppA* internal probes were generated by PCR, and binding was visualized by CSPD. The results are representative of those from at least two independent RNA isolations.

are consistent with those obtained for *B. subtilis* and *E. coli* in which Pro-Gly or Pro-Leu and 5-aminolaevulinic acid, respectively, could be obtained through Dpp (Mathiopoulos *et al.*, 1991; Abouhamad and Manson, 1994).

The predicted five-gene operon structure of *dpp* was confirmed by Northern blotting. As for the GAS *opp* (Podbielski *et al.*, 1996b) and *E. coli opp* and *dpp* (Abouhamad and Manson, 1994), a second shorter mRNA was detected. This mRNA was found to encode only the *dppA* gene and was at least 20 times more abundant than the full-length transcript. The almost complete loss of the full-length *dppA* mRNA in *dppA* mutants suggests that this transcript

oligopeptides most of the time. Based on the normal growth rate of both Dpp and Opp mutants in complex medium, the function of only one system is sufficient to sustain full viability. RNA measurements from *opp* and *dpp* mutants grown in complex medium did not show increased transcription of the compensating permease, suggesting that there is no cross-regulation between the systems or the cells could obtain all essential nutrients from the transport of free amino acids and the function of only one system without the need to increase its transcription.

Like other Gram-positive bacteria (Mathiopoulos *et al.*, 1991), the expression of the *dpp* was at the highest levels per μg of total RNA in late exponential growth phase. Growth phase significantly affected the *dppA* to *dppA–E* ratio, such that, in late exponential growth phase in complex medium, the ratio went from approximately 2:1 to more than 20:1.

However, the overall pattern of *dpp* expression and the *dppA* to *dppA–E* mRNA ratio was affected in a more complex pattern by the types of medium used for growth studies. In a rich medium such as THY that contains free amino acids, dipeptides and oligopeptides, the overall transcription of the *dpp* operon was the lowest (eightfold lower) and the *dppA* to *dppA–E* ratio was the highest (>20:1). The repression of *dpp* transcription in a rich growth medium has also been noted for *E. coli* grown in the presence of casamino acids (Olson *et al.*, 1991). Intermediate levels of total transcription and the *dppA* to *dppA–E* ratio were found in cells grown in CDM containing only free amino acids. In CDM with dipeptides as the only source of essential amino acids, the transcription rates of *dpp* were the highest and the ratio of *dppA* to *dppA–E* was the lowest. Dipeptide addition specifically increased overall *dpp* transcription and not *opp*. However, dipeptides slightly reduced the *oppA* to *oppA–F* ratio, suggesting a more global regulatory mechanism at the transcriptional attenuator. As the ratio of *dppA* to *dppA–E* was affected in addition to the overall transcription rate, a dual regulatory mechanism is suggested where both promoter activity and transcriptional

Total cellular RNA was isolated from the GAS serotype M49 wild type (M49wt), *dppA–dppE* (M49dppAE) and *mga* (M49mga) isogenic mutants in late logarithmic growth phase. Dilutions of total RNA were subjected to MOPS-formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. For the *speB* probe, total RNA loaded was 10 μg, lanes 1 and 5; 5 μg, lanes 2 and 6; 2.5 μg, lanes 3 and 7 and 1.3 μg lanes 4 and 8. For the *dppA* probe, total RNA loaded was 40 mg, lanes 1 and 5; 20 μg, lanes 2 and 6; 10 μg, lanes 3 and 7 and 5 μg lanes 4 and 8. Uniform loading of the gels was confirmed by visual inspection of ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels before transfer to the membranes (inset panel). Specific products in the corresponding gels were detected by Northern blotting. DIG-labelled *dppA* and *oppA* internal probes were generated by PCR, and binding was visualized by CSPD. The results are representative of those obtained from at least two independent RNA isolations.

attenuator activity are regulated to provide the cell with maximal uptake efficiency of dipeptides when needed for cell survival.

A link between dipeptide permeases and virulence factor expression was also found in these studies. The positive transcriptional regulator, Mga, increased the expression of *dpp* by four- to eightfold, similar to its previously reported effect on *opp* (Podbielski *et al.*, 1996b). As the production of virulence factors requires amino acids, the upregulation of peptide transporters by a global virulence regulator is logical. The relationship between Mga and *dpp* expression is anticipated to be an indirect one, as strictly Mga-dependent genes were found not to be expressed in the absence of Mga (Podbielski *et al.*, 1995; Kihlberg *et al.*, 1996), and there is no typical Mga-binding site (Mclver *et al.*, 1995) adjacent to the *dpp* promoter.

The cysteine protease SpeB may form the connection between Mga and the permeases. SpeB processes GAS surface proteins (Berge and Björck, 1995) and may provide the cell with peptides. Transcription of the cysteine protease gene *speB* is positively regulated by Mga, Opp and Dpp (this study; Podbielski *et al.*, 1996b,c). A scenario can be envisioned in which increases in Mga lead to increases in *speB* transcription. SpeB then increases peptide concentrations for the cells, hence inducing *opp* and *dpp* transcription. The transport of peptides through Opp and Dpp in turn then further upregulates SpeB production.

As SpeB contributes extensively to the virulence of specific GAS isolates (Shanley *et al.*, 1996; Lukomski *et al.*, 1997), it remains to be determined whether the potential regulatory influence of Dpp on SpeB expression is sufficient to affect virulence. However, the present study provides enough data to make an association between the nutritionally important Dpp transporter and an important GAS virulence factor plausible and worth investigating further.

### Experimental procedures

#### Bacterial strains and culture conditions

GAS serotype M49 strain CS 101 was provided by P. Cleary, Minneapolis, USA. GAS serotype M2 strain T2/44 RB4/119 was obtained from D. Johnson, Minneapolis, USA. The GAS serotype M2 and M49 OppD gene insertion (*oppDF*) mutants were constructed previously by Podbielski *et al.* (1996b) and a serotype M49 *speB* insertion mutant by Lukomski *et al.* (1997). *E. coli* strain DH5α was used as Gram-negative host for manipulations of plasmids pFW11 and pSF152.

*E. coli* DH5α isolates transformed with pSF152 or pFW11 derivatives were grown at 37°C in ambient air on disk sensitivity testing agar (Unipath) supplemented with 100 mg l⁻¹ ampicillin or spectinomycin respectively.

GAS strains were cultured in Todd–Hewitt (TH) broth and on TH agar (Unipath), both supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract, or in chemically defined medium (CDM; van de Rijn and Kessler, 1980). Growth rates were determined by monitoring optical density at 600 nm of aliquots removed hourly from a growing culture. All GAS strains were grown at 37°C, under a 5% CO₂/20% O₂ atmosphere. GAS mutant strains were maintained in medium containing 60 mg l⁻¹ spectinomycin.

#### Peptide feeding experiments

For measurements of peptide uptake ('peptide feeding' experiments), CDM was prepared without the essential amino acids valine and isoleucine. Di-, tri- and oligopeptides were added at a final concentration of 1 mg ml⁻¹. The peptides [H-Ile-Val-OH (2-mer), H-Val-Trp-Ile-OH (3-mer), H-Ile-Trp-Val-Asn-OH (4-mer) and H-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-OH (6-mer)] were purchased from Bachem (Germany).

#### Vectors

Plasmids pSF152 (Tao *et al.*, 1992) and pFW11 (Podbielski *et al.*, 1996b) were used for insertion mutagenesis experiments according to the protocol of Podbielski *et al.* (1996c). Construction of the serotype M49 GAS genomic library in phage Lambda ZAP Express (Stratagene) is described by Podbielski *et al.* (1996b).

#### DNA techniques

Chromosomal GAS DNA was prepared according to the method of Martin *et al.* (1990). Plasmid DNA preparations, genetic manipulations and other conventional DNA techniques were performed as described by Ausubel *et al.* (1990). Transformation of GAS strains by electroporation was carried out according to the protocol of Caparon and Scott (1991).

Sequencing of GAS genomic DNA using the serotype M49 GAS Lambda library followed the protocol of Podbielski *et al.* (1996b). Oligonucleotides used for sequencing and PCR (Table 1) were designed with the aid of the computer program OLIGO 5.0 (National Biosciences), synthesized on an OLIGO 1000 DNA synthesizer (Beckman), and desalted through NAP5 columns (Pharmacia). The parameters for the PCR assays, direct labelling of PCR products with DIG-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim), analysis of PCR products and direct sequencing of PCR products were as described previously (Podbielski *et al.*, 1995).

DNA sequences were compiled and analysed with PCGENE 6.8 (IntelliGenetics). Sequence comparisons were performed using the BLAST programs and the databases of the GenBank Data Library as well as the Streptococcal Genome Sequencing Project of the University of Oklahoma (Roe *et al.*, 1997).

#### RNA preparation and analysis

Cells used for standard RNA preparations from serotype M49 GAS strains were prepared by overnight growth in the appropriate medium at 37°C 5% CO₂ for 12–14 h followed by 1:2 dilution in fresh medium and incubation for an additional 90 min. To determine growth phase-dependent expression, RNA overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 or 1:100 and grown to OD₆₀₀ values of 0.2–0.3 or 0.8–0.9, which corresponded to early and late logarithmic growth phases respectively.

RNA was prepared from approximately \(10^{10}\) cells at each OD, such that cells at OD 0.3 were harvested from a larger culture volume. RNA preparation was performed according to the method of Shaw and Clewell (1985). Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and Northern blot hybridizations with Dig-dUTP-labelled probes were performed as described previously (Podbielski *et al.*, 1995).

**DNA mutagenesis experiments**

Insertional inactivation of the *oppA* or *dppA* and *dppD* genes was performed using recombinant pSF152 or pFW11 vectors, respectively, according to the strategy and specific methods described in Podbielski *et al.* (1996c). PCR was performed on serotype M49 genomic template with the following primer pairs for each gene: *oppA*, oppAins FOR/REV; *dppA*, dppAins FOR/REV; *dppC*, dppDins FOR/REV. The resulting products contained an N-terminal portion of *oppA* and *dppA* or a C-terminal portion of *dppC*. The PCR products were cloned into pSF152 and pFW11 via the *BamHI* and *HindIII* sites of the single pSF152 multiple cloning site and the multiple cloning site 1 of pFW11. The recombinant plasmids were inserted by specific, single, cross-over events into the genomes of the M2 and M49 serotype strains. The location of the insertions was confirmed by Southern blot hybridizations using the target sequences as probes (Table 3) for comparison of *BamHI*- EcoRI- and Spel-digested genomic DNA from wild-type strains and corresponding *opp* or *dpp* mutant strains (data not shown).

**Nucleotide sequence accession number**

The sequence of the 5.8 kb region encoding the *dpp* operon has been submitted to GenBank Data Library and was assigned the accession number U78768.
