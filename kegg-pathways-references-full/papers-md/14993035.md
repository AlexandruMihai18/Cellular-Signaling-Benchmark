**ABSTRACT:** Estrogen rapidly alters the excitability of hypothalamic neurons that are involved in regulating numerous homeostatic functions including reproduction, stress responses, feeding, and motivated behaviors. Neurosecretory neurons, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and dopamine neurons, and local circuitry neurons, such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons, are among those involved. We have identified membrane-initiated, rapid-signaling pathways through which 17β-estradiol (E₂) alters synaptic responses in these neurons using whole-cell patch recording in hypothalamic slices from ovariectomized female guinea pigs. E₂ rapidly uncouples μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors from G-protein–gated inwardly rectifying K⁺ (GIRK) channels in POMC and dopamine neurons as manifested by a reduction in the potency of μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists to activate these channels. These effects are mimicked by the selective E₂ receptor modulators raloxifene and 4OH-tamoxifen, the membrane impermeable E₂-bovine serum albumin (BSA), but not by 17α-estradiol. Furthermore, the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 antagonizes these rapid effects of E₂. Inhibitors of phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A block the actions of E₂, indicating that the E₂ receptor is G-protein–coupled to activation of this cascade. Conversely, estrogen enhances the efficacy of α₁-adrenergic receptor agonists to inhibit apamin-sensitive small-conductance, Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ (SK) currents in preoptic GABAergic neurons; it does so in both a rapid and sustained fashion. Finally, we observed a direct, steroid-induced hyperpolarization of GnRH neurons. These findings indicate that E₂ can modulate K⁺ channels in hypothalamic (POMC, dopamine, GABA, GnRH) neurons that are involved in regulating numerous homeostatic functions through multiple intracellular signaling pathways.

KELLY et al.: MODULATION OF GPCR SIGNALING BY E₂

INTRODUCTION

It is becoming increasingly evident that the gonadal steroid hormone estrogen (17β-estradiol, E₂) imparts a multifaceted influence over synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. Not only can E₂ alter synaptic responses via genomic mechanisms, but a wealth of information indicates that the steroid can also modulate cell-to-cell communication much more rapidly (for review see Ref. 1). These synaptic alterations are brought about via changes in the cellular responsiveness to the activation of various receptor systems (both G protein-coupled and ionotropic) to their respective first messengers. For example, E₂ can modulate the cellular responsiveness to ionotropic glutamate (both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA) receptor activation.²⁻⁴ In addition, it can alter the linkage of G protein-coupled receptor systems such as opioid (both μ and κ), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ₐ and dopamine D₂ receptors to their respective effector systems. Furthermore, it now appears that the steroid can function as a first messenger by activating an estrogen receptor that couples directly to K⁺ and Ca²⁺ channels by way of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.¹⁰,¹¹ These fundamentally distinct signaling pathways give rise to a coordinated regulation by estrogen of complex physiological processes such as reproduction, stress responses, feeding and cognition. We will focus on the estrogenic modulation of K⁺ channel activity in hypothalamic neurons involved in many of these physiological processes.

ESTROGEN MODULATION OF G-PROTEIN-COUPLED INWARDLY RECTIFYING K⁺ (GIRK) CHANNELS

One of the principal actions of estrogen is to regulate the output of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the mediobasal hypothalamus and hence the reproductive cycle. Although we demonstrated direct actions of estrogen to inhibit GnRH neuronal activity more than 15 years ago,¹⁰,¹² it has been only recently that estrogen receptors have been demonstrated in GnRH neurons.¹³⁻¹⁵ In fact, estrogen responsiveness has been conferred to neurons closely juxtaposed to the GnRH cells.¹⁶⁻²¹ Indeed, hypothalamic POMC and GABAergic neurons, both of which provide a prominent synaptic input onto GnRH neurons, express estrogen receptors and concentrate radiolabeled estradiol.²²⁻²⁴ Opioid peptides and GABAergic ligands both serve to inhibit GnRH output²⁵⁻²⁷ and thus luteinizing hormone (LH) release²⁸⁻³⁰ from the anterior pituitary. While presynaptic interactions between opioid and GABAergic nerve terminals may help regulate this process,³¹,³² it is clear that both μ-opioid and GABAₐ receptor agonists affect a direct, postsynaptic inhibition of GnRH neurons.¹⁰

Studies using *in vitro* slice preparation have revealed that μ-opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of GnRH neurons arises from the activation of a member of the G-protein-gated, inwardly rectifying K⁺ channel subfamily known as GIRK1–4 (Kir3.1–3.4).¹⁰,³³,³⁴ This elicits a robust hyperpolarization in current clamp, or outward current in voltage clamp. POMC and dopamine neurons are exquisitely responsive to μ-opioid receptor activation.³⁵,³⁶ Acute E₂ exposure for no longer than 20 min results in a decreased potency of μ-opioid and GABAₐ receptor agonists to activate GIRKs in POMC and dopamine neurons.³⁷,³⁸ The negative modulatory effect

of estrogen (i.e., reduced potency of μ-opioid receptor and GABA<sub>B</sub> agonists in POMC and dopamine neurons) persists at least 24 h following systemic steroid administration.<sup>6</sup>

μ-Opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors serve as autoreceptors in their respective POMC and hypothalamic GABAergic neurons.<sup>35,39,40</sup> The fact that estrogen uncouples these autoreceptors from their GIRK channel implies that the steroid decreases the auto-inhibition of these cells, thereby increasing the release of these inhibitory neurotransmitters. Indeed, estrogen rapidly increases extracellular GABA concentrations in the preoptic area as measured by push/pull perfusion and microdialysis.<sup>41,42</sup> Coupled with the attenuated GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated autoinhibition of these GABAergic neurons, it stands to reason that estrogen would dramatically increase the firing rate of these neurons during negative feedback. Given that both POMC and hypothalamic GABAergic neurons synapse onto a number of neurosecretory neurons,<sup>43–46</sup> the collective modulation by estrogen of K<sup>+</sup> channel activity in these cells would greatly enhance the inhibitory tonus impinging on these neurons.

# CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF ESTROGEN ACTIVATION OF PROTEIN KINASES

What is the underlying cause of this estrogen-induced decrease in the responsiveness of POMC and dopamine neurons to the μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated activation of GIRK channels? One insight comes from studies that have examined μ-opioid receptor desensitization and opiate tolerance, both of which are associated with a refractoriness to μ-opioid receptor agonists, have implicated intracellular protein kinase pathways in these phenomena.<sup>47–50</sup> Indeed, we have shown that protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors block the maintenance of cellular tolerance to μ-opioid receptor agonists after chronic morphine treatment that is observed in hypothalamic neurosecretory cells.<sup>51</sup> In addition, E<sub>2</sub> has been shown to rapidly stimulate PKA activity in peripheral (e.g., uterine) tissue, as well as to stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element binding protein (CREB) and c-fos expression.<sup>52–56</sup> Furthermore, PKA activators such as Sp-cAMP and forskolin mimic the effect of E<sub>2</sub> on the potency of the μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists.<sup>38,57</sup> In the presence of nonselective protein kinase inhibitors (e.g., staurosporine) or selective PKA inhibitors such as Rp-cAMP and KT5720, the effects of E<sub>2</sub> on the potency of the μ-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO or the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen are blocked. This demonstrates that the modulation by E<sub>2</sub> of the μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor coupling to GIRK channels is due to increased PKA activity. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, which are involved in learning and memory, estrogen activates a similar pathway to potentiate kainate currents.<sup>3</sup> Also, we know that multiple monoamine pathways activate PKA to inhibit small conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channel activity in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons,<sup>58</sup> and recently we have found that E<sub>2</sub> rapidly inhibits the SK current in the same neurons, probably via the same mechanism.<sup>59</sup>

There is considerable evidence for cross talk between various intracellular protein kinase pathways such as protein kinase C (PKC) and PKA in regulating effector systems.<sup>60</sup> PKA activators such as Sp-cAMP and forskolin and PKC activators such as phorbol esters mimic the effect of chronic morphine treatment in desensitizing the

FIGURE 1. Schematic overview representing the short-term versus long-term estrogen-mediated modulation of G-protein-coupled receptors via a membrane-associated estrogen receptor in hypothalamic neurons. Short term: E₂ activates a membrane-associated ER that is Gαq-coupled to activation of phospholipase C that catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) to inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Calcium is released from intracellular stores (endoplasmic reticulum) by IP₃, and DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). Through phosphorylation, adenyl cyclase (AC) activity is upregulated by PKC. The generation of cAMP activates PKA, which can rapidly uncouple μ-opioid (μ) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors from their effector system through phosphorylation of a downstream effector molecule (e.g., the inwardly rectifying K⁺ channel, or GIRK). In addition, the β-adrenergic (β) receptor is Gαs-coupled to activation of a adenyl cyclase-PKA pathway that inhibits the small conductance, Ca²⁺-dependent K⁺ channel (SK), and this inhibition is potentiated by E₂ in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. On the other hand, the α₁-adrenergic receptor is Gαq-coupled to the phosphatidylinositol pathway to activate PKC and PKA to phosphorylate the SK channel and inhibit its activity; this inhibition is potentiated by E₂ in hypothalamic neurons. ER-mediated modulation of kinase pathways either reduces the capacity of neuromodulators such as β-endorphin (β-End) and GABA to inhibit hypothalamic neuronal excitability, or augments the ability of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE) to increase neuronal excitability. Finally, in GnRH neurons, ER is Gαi-coupled to activation of GIRK channels. Long term: Rapid ER-mediated activation of PKA can lead to phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB), which can then alter gene transcription through its interaction with the cAMP responsive element (CRE). Also, activation of PKC can stimulate the MAP kinase pathway (Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2) to cause further gene activation. Therefore, the “short-term” and “long-term” effects of E₂ are not mutually exclusive because the PKC-PKA pathway can also alter gene expression in an estrogen-response element-independent fashion.
$\mu$-opioid receptor mediated responses. ${ }^{47,51}$ In addition, PKC activators potentiate $\beta$-adrenergic receptor agonist stimulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in the preoptic area. ${ }^{61}$ We have examined the involvement of PKC using selective inhibitors of PKC to block the effects of $E_{2}$ on the GABA $_{\mathrm{B}}$ response. ${ }^{62}$ First, treatment of neurons with bisindolylmaleimide, which is an inhibitor of PKC that does not distinguish between conventional, atypical, and novel isoforms of PKC, eliminates all of the effects of $E_{2}$. Similar effects are seen with calphostin C, which is selective for the conventional and novel isoforms of PKC, on the $E_{2}$-induced decrease in DAMGO potency. ${ }^{63}$ However, Gö6976, a selective inhibitor of conventional PKC isoforms is ineffective. In addition, when neurons are perfused internally with the rapid $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelator BAPTA, the inhibition by $E_{2}$ is still observed. Since conventional isoforms of PKC are unlikely to be active with this level of calcium buffering, this result further supports a role for a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-independent, PKC isoform (novel or atypical) in the estrogen-mediated effect. Finally, a selective PKC $\delta$ inhibitor, rottlerin, can fully block the effects of $E_{2}$ to inhibit the GABA $_{\mathrm{B}}$ response, indicating that the novel PKC isoforms are involved in $E_{2}$ signaling.

Activation of PKC appears to be upstream from PKA based on the fact that forskolin can overcome the inhibition by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide. In addition, we believe that the $E_{2}$ receptor is Gq coupled because if we internally perfused neurons with a peptide that mimics the C terminal binding site of Gq, ${ }^{64}$ the response to $E_{2}$ is significantly attenuated. If cells are dialyzed with the same concentration of a nonsense peptide of equal size, the response to $E_{2}$ is not affected. ${ }^{38}$ Finally, Gq stimulates phospholipase C, and we have found that selective inhibitors of phospholipase C (i.e., U-73122) block the ability of $E_{2}$ to reduce the GABA $_{\mathrm{B}}$ response in hypothalamic (dopamine, POMC) neurons.

Recent studies have shown that $E_{2}$ rapidly activates the MAP kinase pathway in primary cortical neuronal cultures and in cerebral cortical explant cultures. ${ }^{65-67}$ However, inhibition of MAP kinase with inhibitors such as PD98059 does not prevent the $E_{2}$ modulation of the baclofen response. Therefore, the $E_{2}$-mediated inhibition of the GABA $_{\mathrm{B}}$ (and $\mu-$ opioid) response appears to be mediated via a plasma membrane receptor that is G$\alpha_{\mathrm{q}}$ coupled to activation of phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A (FIG. 1).

# ESTROGEN MODULATION OF SMALL CONDUCTANCE, CA${}^{2+}$-ACTIVATED K${}^{+}$ (SK) CHANNELS

In addition to the inwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels, hypothalamic neurons also express small-conductance, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ (SK) channels that are sensitive to antagonism by the peptidergic, honeybee toxin apamin. ${ }^{68,69}$ These currents underlie the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that is observed at the tail end of the action potential or a prolonged depolarizing stimulus. ${ }^{69,70}$ In the preoptic area, we have found that the SK currents in GABAergic neurons are inhibited by $\beta$- and $\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic receptor activation. ${ }^{71}$ Of particular interest is that the $\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of the SK current in these GABAergic neurons is markedly potentiated by a transient exposure to estrogen. This estrogen-induced enhancement of the coupling of $\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic receptors to their effector SK channels lasts at least 24 h following systemic steroid administration, but most importantly these effects are
manifested within 20 min following $E_{2}$, as measured in an *in vitro* slice preparation. The potentiation of the $\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of the SK current in preoptic GABA neurons would facilitate the excitation caused by ascending noradrenergic input onto these cells. ${ }^{24}$ In the hippocampus, $E_{2}$ rapidly augments the $\beta$-adrenergic inhibition of SK channel activity in CA1 neurons. ${ }^{72}$ Although the mechanism(s) by which $E_{2}$ augments the $\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic inhibition of the SK current in the hypothalamus, as well as the $\beta$-adrenergic inhibition of the SK current in the hippocampus, is probably via a similar cascade as described above (FIG. 1), the pathway needs to be elucidated.

# ESTROGEN MODULATES DIRECTLY ION CHANNEL ACTIVITY THROUGH A G-PROTEIN LINKAGE

It has been known for some time that iontophoretically applied estrogen to preoptic area neurons alters their excitability primarily by inhibiting their firing rate. ${ }^{73}$ This inhibition is associated with a membrane hyperpolarization due to the opening of a K${}^{+}$ channel that has also been observed in the amygdala and arcuate nucleus. ${ }^{10,74,75}$ This latter region contains GnRH neurons that are particularly responsive to this estrogenic inhibition. ${ }^{10}$

Estrogen also rapidly inhibits voltage-gated Ca${}^{2+}$ channels in medium spiny GABAergic neurons of the basal ganglia, an area that is involved in fine motor control. This effect of estrogen is mediated via a G protein. ${ }^{11}$ Interestingly, the estrogen-induced augmentation of kainate currents in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells also involves an intervening G protein. ${ }^{3}$ Thus, estrogen apparently is capable of relatively direct modulation of ion channel activity through a G protein, as well as more subtle modulation of G-protein-coupled receptor/K${}^{+}$ channel coupling.

# PHARMACOLOGICAL PROFILE OF THE RAPID ESTROGEN RESPONSE RECEPTOR

Earlier studies showed that the $E_{2}$ receptor mediating the rapid effects of $E_{2}$ in POMC neurons was highly selective. ${ }^{57}$ The stereoisomer 17$\alpha$-estradiol could not mimic the actions of $E_{2}$ nor could the nonsteroidal agonist diethylstilbestrol. However, these actions of $E_{2}$ could be antagonized by the anti-estrogen ICI 164,384 with a $K_{i}$ of 0.3 nM. Recently, we have further characterized the binding site for $E_{2}$ using a number of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). ${ }^{38}$ As previously described, we have found that $E_{2}$ rapidly attenuates the outward K${}^{+}$ current induced by the GABA${}_{B}$ receptor agonist baclofen. The inhibitory effect of $E_{2}$ on the baclofen response are mimicked by the SERM raloxifene, but not by 17$\alpha$-estradiol; and as expected from our earlier results, the response is antagonized by ICI 182,780. Furthermore, the membrane-impermeable conjugate $E_{2}$-BSA mimicked the actions of $E_{2}$. Therefore, collectively the results would indicate that $E_{2}$ binds to a G-protein-coupled (plasma membrane) receptor to activate a phospholipase C–protein kinase C–protein kinase A pathway to desensitize the $\mu$-opioid and GABA${}_{B}$ responses in POMC and dopamine neurons. Further evidence for a membrane receptor for $E_{2}$ has been provided by the recent studies of Toran-Allerand and colleagues, ${ }^{76}$ who have

shown both anatomical (electron microscopy) and biochemical (binding) evidence for plasma membrane estrogen receptor distinct from ERα and ERβ

# SIGNIFICANCE

Estrogen modulates the excitability of a number of neurons that are involved in the control of homeostasis, including reproduction, stress responses, feeding, and motivated behaviors. Recently, we have gained some insight into the cellular mechanisms by which estrogen exerts its effects on these neurons. First, estrogen negatively modulates the coupling of the μ-opioid and/or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to their effector K<sup>+</sup> channel in β-endorphin, dopamine, and GABAergic neurons. This uncoupling requires the activation of a hierarchical, intracellular phosphorylation cascade involving phospholipase C, PKC, and PKA pathways (FIG. 1). These pathways also appear to be involved in the estrogen-induced augmentation of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic inhibition of SK channel activity. It is known that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the μ-opioid receptor hinders its association with G<sub>i/o</sub>.<sup>77,78</sup> However, it remains to be seen whether the μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are the phosphorylation substrate that render them less prone to couple to its GIRK channel. More likely targets include G<sub>i/o</sub> subunits, GIRK channels, or protein regulators of G-protein–signaling that are common to both receptors. Future studies will endeavor to elucidate how the phosphorylation affects this uncoupling in POMC neurons.

Finally, estrogen itself can hyperpolarize and thereby inhibit some neurons like GnRH neurons by activating a K<sup>+</sup> channel. While it has long been thought that GnRH neurons do not contain estrogen receptors,<sup>17–19</sup> recent evidence indicates that these neurons express the β isoform of the estrogen receptor.<sup>13–15,21</sup> It is therefore conceivable that estrogen could interact with a membrane-associated receptor to effect a hyperpolarization of GnRH neurons by way of a G protein. Thus, there are multiple cellular mechanisms through which estrogen can exert rapid physiologic actions on hypothalamic neurons (FIG. 1).
