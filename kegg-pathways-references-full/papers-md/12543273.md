## Abstract

A large body of evidence supports a major role for the serotonin 5-HT₄ receptor in learning and memory and it is suggested that 5-HT₄ agonists may be beneficial for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The 5-HT₄ receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. In this communication we show that a neuronal isoform of the human 5-HT₄ receptor, h5-HT₄(g) regulates the metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP695). This process is observed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably coexpressing the neuronal h5-HT₄(g) receptor isoform as well as the human APP695. The 5-HT₄ agonists strongly stimulate the release of the non-amyloidogenic soluble amyloid precursor protein sAPPα as detected by immunoblot. Prucalopride was more potent than serotonin (5-HT) with regard to enhanced of sAPPα secretion. This process was blocked by a selective 5-HT₄ antagonist, GR113808. Furthermore, 5-HT₄ ligands enhance sAPPα secretion via cAMP-dependent and PKA-independent signalling pathways indicating there are alternative pathways by which the h5-HT₄ receptor via cAMP regulates APP metabolism. Because the α-cleavage event may preclude the formation of amyloidogenic peptides, and secreted sAPPα has putative neuroprotective and enhancing-memory properties, our present data suggest the 5-HT₄ receptor as a novel target for the treatment of AD.

## 1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent progressive neurological disorder in the aged population and affects millions of people in the world. The main clinical features of this disease are cognitive decline and mental retardation which are a consequence of a massive neuronal loss in several regions of the brain. Postmortem histopathological studies of AD patients typically show two pathological hallmarks, i.e. the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles ([Dickson, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1007/s004010050639)). Senile plaques are mainly composed of a 40-42 amino acid peptide called amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and most evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ is a key event in the pathogenesis of AD ([for review see Selkoe, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1038/16954)). Aβ derives from a larger transmembrane glycoprotein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the action of β-and γ-secretases. Aβ can be directly neurotoxic via oxidative stress and can induce lipid peroxidation in cultured primary neurons with hydrogen peroxide as a mediator ([Behl et al., 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(94)90545-4); [Nunan and Small, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-0102(00)00060-5)).

α-secretase pathway splits APP within Aβ domain producing a large amino-terminal non-amyloidogenic soluble APP (sAPPα), which is secreted in the extracellular medium and has neurotrophic activities (Mattson et al., 1993; Schubert and Behl, 1993; Mattson, 1997). In addition, sAPPα stimulates neurite outgrowth, regulates neuronal excitability and has potent memory-enhancing effects (Furukawa et al., 1996; Meziane et al., 1998).

The brain of AD patients is also characterised by a dramatic loss of cholinergic neurons in central regions involved in cognitive functions. Besides cholinergic deficit, loss of additional neurotransmitters has been reported in AD and there is increasing evidence that a deficit in serotonergic neurotransmission may play a role in cognitive impairment in AD (Meltzer et al., 1998). Since neuronal activity may be involved in the regulation of APP metabolism, deregulation of neuronal signalling involving, for instance 5-HT may lead to abnormal APP processing and Aβ overproduction. It is therefore crucial to determine the regulatory mechanisms of APP metabolism by neurotransmitter receptors.

### 2. Involvement of the serotonin 5-Ht₄ receptor in cognitive processes

Among the long list of 5-HT receptor subtypes, the 5-HT₄ receptor has gained a lot of attention for its physiological effects on the brain (for review, Barnes and Sharp, 1999). Indeed, with the availability of selective 5-HT₄ ligands, radioligand binding and autoradiography studies have been performed in the brain of such species as the rat, pig and human (Grossman et al., 1993; Waeber et al., 1993; Bonaventure et al., 2000). A consistent cross-species finding is the relatively high expression of the 5-HT₄ receptor in the limbic system, particularly in the septo-hippocampal formation which suggests a role for this receptor in learning and memory (Eglen et al., 1995). Accordingly, post-mortem brains of AD patients display a reduction in the number of 5-HT₄ receptor binding sites in the hippocampal region (Reynolds et al., 1995).

There are now numerous reports indicating that activation of the 5-HT₄ receptor facilitates cognitive performance in animal models of learning and memory (Fontana et al., 1997; Letty et al., 1997; Marchetti-Gauthier et al., 1997; Terry et al., 1998; Barnes and Sharp, 1999). Most of these studies have used the 5-HT₄ compounds BIMU-1 and BIMU-8 (Eglen et al., 1995), which show activity in an olfactory discrimination task (Marchetti-Gauthier et al., 1997), a social memory task (Letty et al., 1997) and in reversing scopolamine-induced amnesia in a mouse passive avoidance task (Galeotti et al., 1998). In addition, when applied intracerebroventricularly, these agonists facilitated the release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the rat hippocampus frontal cortex (Consolo et al., 1994; Matsumoto et al., 2001). This response was reduced by co-administration of the selective 5-HT₄ antagonist, GR113808 (Consolo et al., 1994). More selective 5-HT₄ agonist such as RS67333 have been shown to improve learning in the Morris water maze test (Lelong et al., 2001). Recently, the role of 5-HT₄ receptors in the neuronal mechanism of memory enhancement and the cognitive process was clearly demonstrated with the selective 5-HT₄ agonist, SC 53116 which increased the spike amplitude in the hippocampal CA1 neurons, the tetanus-induced long term potentiation and the concentration dependent release of ACh (Matsumoto et al., 2001). The effects of SC 53116 was blocked by the selective 5-HT₄ receptor antagonists GR113808 (Matsumoto et al., 2001). A final set of evidence supporting a major role for the 5-HT₄ receptor in learning and memory comes from a recent study showing that a 5-HT₄ agonist, SL65.0155 has potent and robust cognitive enhancing activity (Moser et al., 2002). This 5-HT₄ agonist displays almost no gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects and can act synergistically with the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine (Moser et al., 2002). Therefore, this 5-HT₄ compound not only offers the prospect of improved efficacy and reduced side effects but may also be useful as additive for AD patients already receiving cholinesterase inhibitors. Taken together, these data show that the 5-HT₄ receptor may be a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of AD.

### 3. Molecular identity of the human serotonin 5-Ht₄ receptor

To better understand the pathological implication of the 5-HT₄ receptor in human disorders, considerable efforts have been made to elucidate its nucleic acid sequence. Initially, the molecular identity of the 5-HT₄ receptor was determined in the rat where two C-terminal splice variants were isolated by PCR from brain tissues and named 5-HT₄ₛ and 5-HT₄ₗ for the short and long isoforms, respectively (Gerald et al., 1995). Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed from the sequence of the rat 5-HT₄ cDNA and a PCR-based strategy Blondel et al. (1997) isolated and cloned the human 5-HT₄ receptor which they named h5-HT₄(a). The deduced amino acid sequence of the h5-HT₄(a) receptor isoform displays a 93% identity with the short form of the 5-HT₄ receptor isolated from rat brain (Blondel et al., 1997; Claeyesen et al., 1997; Van den Wyngaert et al., 1997). More recently, additional C-terminal variants of the human 5-HT₄ receptor have been identified and named h5-HT₄(b), h5-HT₄(c), h5-HT₄(d), h5-HT₄(e), h5-HT₄(f), h5-HT₄(g) and h5-HT₄(n) (Blondel et al., 1998; Claeyesen et al., 1999; Mialet et al., 2000a; Bender et al., 2000; Vilaró et al., 2002). Most of the h5-HT₄ receptor isoforms are also found in rodent species (Claeyesen et al., 1999). All the h5-HT₄ receptor isoforms are derived from an alternative splicing of a common gene and belong to the seven transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled family of

receptors (GPCR) (Bender et al., 2000). They have an identical amino acid sequence up to the splicing site at Leu<sup>358</sup> whereas the sequence of the C-terminal tail is specific for each 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor isoform (Fig. 1).

Tissue distribution studies revealed that most of h5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor isoforms are expressed throughout the brain (Blondel et al., 1998; Medhurst et al., 2001). However, using the quantitative technique of TaqMan real time RT-PCR, high expression levels of h5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor mRNA were observed in the hippocampus providing additional evidence for their role in memory (Medhurst et al., 2001). The h5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors are also present at the periphery especially in the gastrointestinal tract where they are implicated in the contraction or the relaxation of the smooth muscle (Blondel et al., 1998) and in the atria where they are suggested to be involved in atrial arrhythmia (Kaumann, 1994; Rahme et al., 1999).

No major difference in the binding properties of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> ligands between the different h5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor isoforms has been reported. Indeed, the pharmacological binding profile determined in competition studies using the radiolabelled specific antagonist [³H] GR 113808 as radioligand revealed the same rank order of affinity of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> ligands for recombinant h5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors transfected in mammalian CHO and COS-7 cells (Blondel et al., 1998; Mialet et al., 2000a,b). All the recombinant h5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor variants couple to a second messenger system since they stimulate adenylyl cyclase and raise intracellular cAMP levels

(Blondel et al., 1998; Claeysen et al., 1999; Bender et al., 2000; Mialet et al., 2000a; Vilaró et al., 2002). However, the efficacy and the potency of a given 5-HT<sub>4</sub> ligand depend strongly on the variant considered (Mialet et al., 2000a,b). For instance, we have recently shown that the h5-HT<sub>4(d)</sub> receptor isoform was more potent than the h5-HT<sub>4(g)</sub> receptor in its ability to increase cAMP production in response to agonists (Mialet et al., 2000a,b) indicating that C-terminal tails of h5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors may influence their functional properties and confer a functional specificity to each isoform. At present an important challenge is to understand the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of the large number of h5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor splice variants. As a first attempt to associate a cellular function to the recently cloned neuronal h5-HT<sub>4(g)</sub> receptor isoform, we investigated its influence on APP processing.

4. The human serotonin 5-Ht<sub>4</sub> receptor and the amyloid precursor processing

An important observation towards the understanding of the pharmacological regulation of APP metabolism comes from the fact that GPCRs through a complex network of second messengers may regulate the α cleavage of APP (for review see Racchi and Govoni, 1999). Early work (Nitsch et al., 1992) showed that the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M3 receptor subtypes stably transfected into HEK cells

increased extracellular release of sAPPα with a concomitant reduction in the levels of Aβ (Hung et al., 1993; Wolf et al., 1995). This demonstration that stimulation of muscarinic receptors coupled to phosphoinositide turnover increases sAPPα release was the first indication that APP ectodomain shedding is a receptor-regulated process. Since then, several studies have analysed the effects of various other neurotransmitters and the signalling mechanisms that govern proteolytic cleavage of APP. These include phospholipase C-coupled receptors such as metabotropic glutamate receptors and some membrane receptors which are positively linked to adenylate cyclase (Lee et al., 1995; Lezoualc'h et al., 2000). Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of corticotropin releasing hormone receptor is accompanied by an increased release of sAPPα (Lezoualc'h et al., 2000).

Because strong evidence supports beneficial effects of 5-HT₄ agonists in memory and learning, we investigated the potential involvement of the 5-HT₄ receptor in APP processing.

### 4.1. 5-HT₄ ligands regulate sAPPα secretion in the CHO cell line coexpressing human APP695 and the h5-HT₄(g) receptor

To analyse the effect of 5-HT₄ ligands on APP metabolism, we used a CHO cell line which stably expresses a neuronal isoform of the h5-HT₄ receptor, the 5-HT₄(g) receptor. Note that this 5-HT₄ receptor isoform was previously called 5-HT₄(e) receptor (Claeyssen et al., 1999; Mialet et al., 2000a). This CHO cell line displayed a typical 5-HT₄ binding and functional pharmacological profiles as previously determined in binding studies and adenylyl cyclase assays (Mialet et al., 2000a). The recombinant 5-HT₄(g) receptor was expressed at a density 347 ± 7 fmol mg⁻¹ (Mialet et al., 2000a) which is a similar value to those found in human brain (Waeber et al., 1993). However, one major drawback in the use of non-neuronal rodent cell lines is the relative low level of APP. In addition, the hamster β-amyloid peptide differs by three amino acids from the human form and consequently this excludes the use of the human specific antibodies to discriminate between α- and β-cleavage of rodent APP. Therefore, we stably transfected a major isoform of the human neuronal APP, APP695 (Kang and Müller-Hill, 1990) in CHO cell line expressing the 5-HT₄(g) receptor. Positive clones were selected with hygromycin (500 μg ml⁻¹) and neomycin (1 mg ml⁻¹). The regulation of human APP metabolism by 5-HT₄ ligands was then investigated.

The sAPPα was detected exactly as previously described (Robert et al., 2001) using the antibody 6E10 which is specific for the α-secretase cleaved form of human APP (Kim et al., 1990) and do not cross react with rodent APP. To block the activity of endogenous 5-HT₁B receptors, CHO cells were preincubated for

A, B: Representative immunoblots showing the effects of increasing concentrations of 5-HT (A) and prucalopride (B) on the cellular release of sAPPα in CHO cells stably coexpressing the h5-HT₄(g) receptor and human APP695. After incubating the cells with the indicated concentrations of ligands for 30 min, secreted sAPPα was measured by Western blot using the monoclonal antibody 6E10. A 110 kDa molecular weight marker is indicated at the right. C: Representative immunoblot showing the blocking effect of the selective 5-HT₄ antagonist, GR113808, on 5-HT and prucalopride-induced sAPPα release. CHO cells were preincubated with with 1 μM concentration of GR113808 10 min prior to treatment with 5-HT₄ ligands. After an additional 30 min period, sAPPα was detected in the culture medium Immunoblots were performed as in A and B. CT, untreated control cells. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.

30 min with 1 μM of a specific antagonist of this 5-HT receptor subtype, GR127935. Serotonergic agonists were then added for an additional 15 min. When CHO cell clones were treated with increasing concentrations of 5-HT for 30 min, extracellular sAPPα release was enhanced compared to untreated control cells (Fig. 2A). Identical results were obtained with other cellular clones coexpressing APP695 and the 5-HT₄(g) receptor. These data suggest that secreted sAPP is produced by non-amyloidogenic α-cleavage. Next the effect of the highly selective 5-HT₄ agonist (Briejer et al., 2001), prucalopride on APP metabolism was investigated. Fig. 2B shows a representative gel depicting an increase in sAPPα secretion with increasing concentrations of prucalopride after 30 min of application. Prucalopride appeared to be more potent than 5-HT to induce sAPPα since it was effective at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 2). As expected, the potent selective 5-HT₄ antagonist, GR113808 (1 μM), blocked the cellular release of sAPPα induced by 5-HT (1 μM) and prucalopride (1 μM) (Fig. 2C) indicating that the effects

A: Representative immunoblots showing the effects of the PKA inhibitor, H89, on basal and prucalopride-induced secretion of sAPPα. H89 (10 μM) was preincubated 10 min before the 30 min treatment with 1 μM prucalopride. Immunoblots were performed with the monoclonal antibody 6E10. B: The 5-HT₄ receptor activates via the heterotrimeric Gs protein, the adenylyl cyclase (AC). The subsequent rise in cAMP production increases sAPPα release. The stimulatory effect of the h5-HT₄ receptor on sAPPα release is mimicked by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, and 8-Bromo-cAMP, a membrane permeant cAMP analogue. Inhibition of PKA by H89 fails to inhibit 5-HT₄ agonists-induced increase in secreted sAPPα. On the contrary, inhibition of PKA by H89 potentiated the 5-HT-induced increase in secreted sAPPα as demonstrated by Robert et al. (2001).

of 5-HT on secreted sAPPα is specifically mediated by the h5-HT₄(g) receptor. The present data are consistent with our previous finding showing that the recombinant h5-HT₄(g) receptor stimulates the release of endogenous sAPPα in CHO cells (Robert et al., 2001) and extend them to the regulation of human APP.

In principle, α-cleavage of APP within the Aβ sequence precludes the formation of the amyloid peptides derived from the sequential action of β- and γ-secretases. In a previous study, we did not observe any concomitant decrease in the total level of human Aβ upon stimulation of the 5-HT₄(g) receptor in CHO cells transiently transfected with the human APP695 (Robert et al., 2001). Our data contrast with several reports showing that pharmacological manipulation of APP metabolism can enhance sAPPα release and reduce Aβ production as shown for steroid hormones (Gouras et al., 2000). The reasons for these apparent discrepancies in the above-mentioned findings are manifold. One possible explanation is the fact that total level of extracellular Aβ was measured in our study and therefore we cannot exclude that 5-HT may differentially influence Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 levels (Robert et al., 2001). Also, levels of amyloid peptides in our cellular system may be too low to detect by immunoprecipitation any subtle differences in the amount of Aβ. The use of our cellular model stably expressing the h5-HT₄ receptor and human APP695 should allow us to circumvent this problem.

### 4.2. Analysis of the signalling pathways involved in the h5-HT₄(g) receptor induced-sAPPα secretion

The h5-HT₄ receptor isoforms are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase production and consequently they increase cAMP production. Using the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and the membrane permeant 8-Bromo-cAMP, we have recently shown that both drugs mimic the effects of 5-HT on APP metabolism in CHO cells (Robert et al., 2001) (Fig. 3). These data are in accordance with previous studies showing that activation of other membrane receptors which are positively coupled to the cAMP signalling pathway can induce the release of sAPPα in different cellular systems (Marambaud et al., 1996; Lezoualc'h et al., 2000).

Three members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, ADAM9, ADAM10 and ADAM17/TACE (tumour necrosis factor-α converting enzyme) have been characterised as putative mediators of the α-cleavage (Mills and Reiner, 1999; Racchi and Govoni, 1999). For example, TACE is the principal endogenous mediator of constitutive sAPPα release from HEK-293 cells (Slack et al., 2001) and also appears to be involved in PKC-regulated APP cleavage in CHO cells

(Jolly-Tornetta and Wolf, 2000). So far we still don't know whether the effects of the 5-HT₄ receptor on APP metabolism is directly linked to an increase in the activity of the α-secretases or an effect on cellular trafficking of APP. It is possible that activation of the 5-HT₄(g) receptor targets more APP to cellular compartments involved in α-secretase processing and therefore enhances encounter of the proteases and APP. Further studies on the identification of the α-secretases involved in this process and their potential regulation by the h5-HT₄ receptor should allow us to answer this question.

In most cellular systems, PKA has been considered to be essential in mediating the many physiological effects triggered by the second messenger cAMP. Surprisingly, here we show that PKA is not linked to APP metabolism (Robert et al., 2001) since a pharmacological inhibitor of PKA, H89 failed to inhibit the stimulating effect of prucalopride on sAPPα release (Fig. 3A). This result is in accordance with our previous finding showing that stimulation of the 5-HT₄(g) receptor with 1 μM 5-HT strongly enhanced basal sAPPα in the presence of 10 μM H89 (Robert et al., 2001). Interestingly, we noticed that blocking PKA appeared to boost the effect of 5-HT on sAPPα secretion indicating that PKA exerts a negative regulation on 5-HT-induced increase in secreted sAPPα via PKA (Lezoualc'h et al., 2000). Our data suggest that there are alternative pathways by which the 5-HT₄ receptor via cAMP regulates cell function. Interestingly, several cAMP binding proteins other than PKA have been characterised. This includes nucleotide-gated cation channels (Zufall et al., 1997) and some nucleotide exchange factors (cAMP-GEFs) which regulate the activity of the small G protein of the Ras family (De Rooij et al., 1998; Kawasaki et al., 1998). Current experiments are under way to determine the signalling pathways involved in this cellular process involving the h5-HT₄ receptor and APP processing.
