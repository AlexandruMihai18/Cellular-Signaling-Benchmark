# REGULATION OF PLASMA-CELL DEVELOPMENT

**Miriam Shapiro-Shelef and Kathryn Calame**

Abstract | Plasma cells are the terminally differentiated, non-dividing effector cells of the B-cell lineage. They are cellular factories devoted to the task of synthesizing and secreting thousands of molecules of clonospecific antibody each second. To respond to microbial pathogens with the necessary specificity and rapidity, B cells are exquisitely regulated with respect to both development in the bone marrow and activation in the periphery. This review focuses on the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, including the different subsets of B cells that become plasma cells, the mechanism of regulation of this transition, the transcription factors that control each developmental stage and the characteristics of long-lived plasma cells.

Plasma cells, the sole producers of antibody, are crucial for an effective immune response, yet they can cause severe pathology in autoimmunity and multiple myeloma. So, activation of mature B cells, secretion of antibody and survival of plasma cells need to be tightly controlled.

**PLASMA CELLS**  
Non-dividing, terminally differentiated, immunoglobulin-secreting cells of the B-cell lineage.

**MARGINAL ZONE**  
A region at the border of the white pulp of the spleen.

The transmembrane form of the μ immunoglobulin heavy chain. μS denotes the alternative form, which is secreted.

**When and where do plasma cells develop?**

**Antigen-independent B-cell development.** B cells develop from haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (FIG. 1). Early development and commitment to the B-cell lineage depend on several transcription factors, including early B-cell factor, PU.1, E2A and paired box protein 5 (**PAX5**)¹. Successful rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene segments in pro-B cells leads to precursor (pre)-B cells, which express **μM** (the transmembrane form of the μ IgH); in the pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR), **μM** provides the first crucial check-point for B-cell development, which then allows the clonal expansion and rearrangement of immunoglobulin light-chain (IgL) gene segments. The presence of surface IgM is required to pass the second check-point, which then allows negative selection to occur (in which tolerance mechanisms delete, anergize or edit autoreactive clones)²⁻⁴. Naive B220⁺IgM⁺ B cells that survive negative selection then exit the marrow. The time point during ontogeny and development when the specialized B1-cell subset (BOX 1) diverges from conventional B2 cells remains controversial.

B cells continue their development in the spleen, where they pass through transitional stages T1 and T2 and are subjected to a further round of negative selection before becoming fully mature⁵. A small proportion of transitional B cells home to the splenic marginal zone and remain there as naive non-circulating marginal-zone B cells⁶. However, most B cells in the T2 stage mature into naive long-lived follicular B cells, which continue circulating to the follicles in the spleen, to the lymph nodes and to the bone marrow until they either die or encounter cognate antigen and undergo further maturation. B-cell development has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. This review focuses on the final, antigen-dependent stages of B-cell development, which lead to the formation of **PLASMA CELLS**, and emphasizes transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.

**Early plasma-cell response.** After antigen encounter, plasma cells can develop from naive **MARGINAL-ZONE** B cells and follicular B cells, from activated germinal-centre B cells and from memory B cells (FIG. 2). Which B-cell subset(s) becomes terminally differentiated depends on the nature of the antigen, its dose and form, and the location of the encounter. The earliest antibody response to some pathogens is provided by pre-existing ‘natural’ antibodies that are secreted by B1 cells (BOX 1).

The first B cells to respond to a foreign antigen by differentiating into plasma cells are marginal-zone B cells⁶,⁷.

from the marginal zone to the bridging channels and the red pulp of the spleen, where they undergo a burst of proliferation. This occurs concomitantly with differentiation to form foci of plasmablasts⁷, which secrete immunoglobulin but continue to proliferate.

A crucial property of marginal-zone B cells is their inherent ability to respond rapidly to antigen. They have a lower threshold for antigen activation than follicular B cells and, when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), proliferate to a greater extent⁹. The molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the increased responsiveness of marginal-zone B cells are not fully understood, but expression of increased levels of cell-surface molecules — such as CD21 (also known as complement receptor 2), CD1d (an MHC-class-I-like molecule that presents lipid antigens), CD38 (also known as ADP-ribosyl cyclase) and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 — is likely to facilitate antigen capture and T-cell co-stimulation⁹,¹⁰. In addition, differences in the levels of transcriptional regulators and signal-transduction molecules are likely to be important.

Circulating mature follicular B cells that both encounter antigen and receive help from T cells also respond rapidly (albeit more slowly than marginal-zone B cells), undergoing proliferation and plasmacytic differentiation to form extrafollicular foci of plasmablasts and plasma cells. Two days after immunization with a T-cell-dependent antigen, foci are observed along the periphery of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath. These foci expand until day 8 after immunization and then diminish¹¹. Plasma cells formed by either marginal-zone or follicular B cells in this early extrafollicular response do not have SOMATICALLY MUTATED immunoglobulin genes and are short-lived, undergoing apoptosis *in situ*¹². However, these cells provide a rapid initial response to pathogens.

Post-germinal-centre response. When follicular B cells both encounter antigen and receive T-cell help, a second developmental possibility is the establishment of a germinal centre¹³,¹⁴. Germinal centres are specialized areas

Figure 1 | **Antigen-independent development of B cells.** B cells develop from pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow, where full commitment to the B-cell lineage requires the transcription factor paired box protein 5 (PAX5). Naive B cells that exit the bone marrow continue to undergo maturation in the spleen to form long-lived naive follicular B cells and, to a lesser extent, naive marginal-zone B cells.

Mice that lack marginal-zone B cells are susceptible to bacterial infections⁸, underscoring the importance of marginal-zone B cells for mounting an immune response to bacteria. Consistent with this, marginal-zone B cells have a repertoire that is skewed towards recognition of T-CELL-INDEPENDENT TYPE 2 (TI-2) ANTIGENS, although some of these cells recognize T-cell-dependent antigens and therefore present antigen and provide co-stimulation to T cells. The location of naive marginal-zone B cells, which do not circulate, facilitates early encounter with blood-borne antigens. Within a few hours of immunization with a TI-2 antigen, marginal-zone B cells move

T-CELL-INDEPENDENT TYPE 2 ANTIGENS (TI-2 antigens). Antigens that contain multiple identical epitopes, which crosslink B-cell receptors.

SOMATICALLY MUTATED Immunoglobulin genes that have undergone somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM is a unique mutation mechanism that is targeted to the variable regions of rearranged immunoglobulin gene segments. Combined with selection for B cells that produce high-affinity antibody, SHM leads to affinity maturation of B cells in the germinal centre.

ANTIBODY-SECRETING CELLS (ASCs). Denotes both proliferating plasmablasts and non-proliferating plasma cells. The term is used when both cell types might be present.

Box 1 | **B1 cells**

B1 cells are mainly found in the peritoneal and pleural cavities and the gut lamina propria. They give rise to ANTIBODY-SECRETING CELLS (ASCs), but they differ from conventional B cells (B2 cells) in several interesting ways¹¹⁵. They have a unique cell-surface phenotype, including expression of CD5 (by the B1a but not the B1b subset) and CD11b (in the peritoneal and pleural cavities). B1-cell progenitors are abundant in the fetal liver, but are absent in the adult bone marrow¹¹⁶. B1 cells have a unique self-renewing capacity and express a B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire that is skewed towards recognition of T-cell-independent type 2 (TI-2) antigens. They are responsible for the production of ‘natural’ IgM, which forms in response to self-antigens but often recognizes bacterial antigens and provides the first line of defence by antibodies against such pathogens. The spleen is required for the generation and maintenance of B1a cells¹¹⁷. When B1 cells become activated in the pleural or peritoneal cavities, they migrate to the spleen or gut, lose expression of CD5 (which negatively regulates signalling through the BCR) and become antibody-secreting plasma cells¹¹⁸,¹¹⁹.

Transcription of CD5 is controlled by a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-dependent enhancer, and development of B1a cells in both the peritoneal cavity and the spleen requires NFATc1 but is independent of NFATc2 (REF. 120). B1 cells have constitutively activated STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)¹²¹, whereas in B2 cells, STAT3 is activated only in response to signalling through cytokine receptors or Toll-like receptors. B1 cells that become ASCs use part of the same gene-expression programme as B2 cells to secrete antibody, because although B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) is not required for the formation of B1 cells, it is required for the ability of these cells to secrete antibody (D. Savitsky and K.C., unpublished observations).

in the follicle where B cells undergo rounds of proliferation, which is accompanied by affinity maturation and CLASS-SWITCH RECOMBINATION (CSR) of immunoglobulin. Antigen-specific T helper cells and FOLLICULAR DENDRITIC CELLS (FDCs) are important for the germinal-centre response¹⁵. Interactions between CD40 ligand (CD40L)–CD40 and inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS)–ICOS ligand — which are present at the cell surface of T and B cells, respectively — are important, as are cytokines expressed by T cells¹⁶. T helper cells present in the germinal centre have unique properties, including high-level expression of CXC-chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13)¹⁷ and the adaptor protein SAP (signalling lymphocyte-activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein), which is required for providing help¹⁸. FDCs sequester antigen in the germinal centre, and complement receptors (CD21 and CD35) expressed by FDCs are crucial for this function¹⁹. The germinal-centre response peaks between day 10 and day 14 after immunization and then diminishes. Plasma cells and memory B cells, which mainly have somatically mutated, high-affinity

BCRs and express switched immunoglobulin isotypes, exit the germinal centre.

Memory-cell response. Post-germinal-centre memory B cells retain high-affinity BCR at their cell surface, do not secrete antibody and (at least one subset) can persist independently of antigenic stimulation when gene targeting is used to change the specificity of the BCR²⁰,²¹. Memory B cells have the intrinsic ability to respond more rapidly than naive B cells, and they show a proliferative burst on secondary encounter with antigen²². Complement receptors expressed by stromal cells are required for this rapid recall response¹⁹. Stimulation of human memory B cells ex vivo shows that bystander T-cell signals and CPG-CONTAINING OLIGODEOXYNUCLEOTIDES can suffice to stimulate the differentiation of memory B cells, indicating a way to replenish and/or maintain memory and plasma cells in the absence of further exposure to antigen²³.

A unique subset of BCR⁺CD79b⁺B220⁻syndecan 1 (SDC1)⁻ cells in the bone marrow was shown by adoptive transfer to be ‘pre-plasma’ memory cells; these cells differentiate into plasma cells on secondary encounter with antigen more readily than do the B220⁺ memory subset in the spleen²⁴. However, this pre-plasma memory-cell subset is controversial because another research group has suggested that they are non-B cells that capture BCRs using cell-surface Fc receptors²⁵. BCR⁺B220low SDC1⁺CD44⁺ bone-marrow cells that differentiate into plasma cells independent of antigen have also been described²⁶. The relationship between these two bone-marrow cell populations is unresolved at present. The common requirement for B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) in the formation of plasma cells and pre-plasma memory cells led us to speculate that post-germinal-centre cells might develop through a single pathway that leads from memory B cells to plasma cells²⁷. The alternative possibility is that memory B cells and plasma cells are two separate fates of the B cells that leave the germinal centre.

Relationships between cell division and plasma-cell differentiation. Before differentiation into plasma cells, activated B cells undergo a strong proliferative burst. Studies using a division-tracking dye to assess cell divisions of B cells stimulated in vitro showed that, at each cell division, there was a probability of commitment to the plasmacytic fate, and this probability was increased in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) or IL-5 (REFS 28,29). Clearly, the clonal expansion of cells that are committed to a plasma-cell fate amplifies the selected antibody response, but these studies indicate that proliferation might be a mechanistic requirement for plasmacytic differentiation. Because replication provides an opportunity for epigenetic remodelling, it will be interesting to study unactivated B cells and examine the chromatin structures of the genes that are crucial for plasma cells. Ultimately, proliferation ceases and non-dividing plasma cells are formed, but it is interesting that BLIMP1 expression and immunoglobulin secretion precede the cessation of the cell cycle.

Figure 2 | Formation of plasma cells. Antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) formed from B1 cells secrete natural antibody in the absence of external antigen, and they also secrete IgA in the gut, in response to pathogens. On encounter with foreign antigen (indicated by week 1 in figure), naive marginal-zone B cells differentiate into plasma cells, and subsequently, naive follicular B cells also differentiate into plasma cells. Most of the extrafollicular plasma cells that are formed in this early response are short-lived. Some activated follicular B cells form a germinal centre. Post-germinal-centre plasma cells might progress through a memory B-cell stage in the primary response or might develop directly from germinal-centre B cells (for further details, see main text). Plasma cells that result from a germinal-centre reaction might become long-lived if they find survival niches, which are mainly located in the bone marrow. CSR, class-switch recombination.

Regulation of late B-cell development

Gene-expression programmes of antigen-activated B cells are considerably different from those of plasma cells. Different combinations of transcriptional regulators (BOX 2) are required to maintain these B-cell- and plasma-cell-specific programmes (TABLES 1,2). Interestingly, many of the stage-specific transcription factors repress those factors that are required for the alternative developmental state, thereby establishing mutually exclusive gene-expression programmes (FIG.3).

Activated and germinal-centre B cells. PAX5 is required to establish and maintain B-cell identity until the plasma-cell stage<sup>30</sup>; however, Pax5 transcription must be repressed to allow plasma-cell differentiation<sup>31</sup>. PAX5 activates target genes that are important for B cells, including Igα, CD19 and B-cell linker (BLNK)<sup>32</sup> (FIG.4). The activation by PAX5 of ACTIVATION-INDUCED CYTIDINE DEAMINASE (AID) is important in germinal-centre B cells<sup>33</sup>. In addition, the PAX5-dependent repression of expression of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1)<sup>34</sup>, the IgH, the IgL and the immunoglobulin joining (J) chain<sup>35–37</sup> provides a mechanism for how PAX5 blocks plasma-cell development and why it must be repressed in plasma cells. However, loss of PAX5 is not sufficient to trigger BLIMP1 expression or plasma-cell formation<sup>32</sup> (TABLE 2).

Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) also inhibits plasma-cell development. It is crucial for maintaining mature B cells in a resting state; in its absence, expression of BLIMP1 is induced, and plasma cells form spontaneously<sup>38</sup>. This activity depends on repression of interferon-regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) expression (possibly in an indirect manner). IRF4 expression is induced in the absence of MITF, and reducing IRF4 expression using antisense Irf4 blocks the spontaneous development of plasma cells. It will be interesting to learn whether, as well as being expressed by resting B cells, MITF is also expressed by germinal-centre B cells.

**Box 2 | Who’s who in the cast: the transcription factors**

**BACH2**

BACH2 is a member of the BACH family of transcription factors, which contain BTB (Broad-complex, tramtrack and bric a brac), CNC (cap’n’collar) and bZip (basic leucine zipper) domains. It heterodimerizes with small MAF proteins and then binds MAF-recognition elements. The heterodimer of MAFK and BACH2 represses the immunoglobulin heavy-chain 3′ enhancer. BACH2 is only expressed by haematopoietic cells and neurons; it is abundant in early B cells, and its expression is shut-down in plasma cells<sup>63</sup>.

**BCL-6**

BCL-6 (B-cell lymphoma-6) was first described as a proto-oncogene that was translocated and deregulated in B-cell lymphoma<sup>122</sup>. It is a six-zinc-finger-containing transcriptional repressor that also contains a BTB domain, which is required for its repressor activity<sup>123</sup>.

**BLIMP1**

BLIMP1 (B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1) is a five-zinc-finger-containing protein that was first identified as a repressor of the human interferon-β (IFN-β) promoter<sup>124</sup> and was subsequently identified as an induced transcript when BCL-1 lymphoma cells differentiate into antibody-secreting cells after cytokine treatment<sup>49</sup>. BLIMP1 associates with proteins encoded by Groucho-related genes (GRGs)<sup>111</sup>, histone deacetylases<sup>112</sup> and the G9A histone methyltransferase<sup>113</sup>, and its consensus recognition site is similar to that of interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and IRF2 (REF. 125).

**IRF4**

IRF4 (interferon-regulatory factor 4) is a lymphocyte-specific member of the IRF family. It was first identified as a PU.1-interacting protein that heterodimerized with PU.1 to activate transcription of target genes<sup>59</sup>. By heterodimerizing with different partners, IRF4 binds different sequences and can either activate or repress transcription<sup>126</sup>.

**MITF**

MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) is encoded by the microphthalmia locus, which is essential for melanocyte development in mice. MITF is a member of the bZipHLH (basic leucine zipper helix–loop–helix) family, and it can heterodimerize with other family members — TFEB (transcription factor EB), TFE3 and TFEC — to form a transcriptional activator<sup>127</sup>.

**MTA3**

MTA3 (metastasis-associated 1 family, member 3) was identified in mammary epithelial cells as an oestrogen-dependent component of the Mi-2–NURD (nucleosome remodelling and disruption) co-repressor complex that regulates growth and differentiation<sup>128</sup>.

**PAX5**

PAX5 (paired box protein 5) was first identified as a mammalian homologue of the sea urchin protein TSAP and was originally known as BSAP (B-cell-lineage-specific activator protein). It was subsequently shown to be encoded by the Pax5 gene<sup>129</sup>. PAX5 binds DNA by a bipartite paired domain and can function as either a transcriptional activator or repressor<sup>30</sup>.

**XBP1**

XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1) was first identified as a bZip transcriptional activator that binds the HLA-DR promoter<sup>130</sup>. It is ubiquitously expressed but is present at increased levels in plasma cells.

*As terminal differentiation progresses, the levels of transcription factors that are important for B-cell functions decrease, whereas those that are important for plasma-cell functions increase. Minus and plus signs are not quantitative. †Although mRNA that encodes B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) is present in naive B cells, high levels of BCL-6 protein are found only at the germinal-centre stage. §BACH2 (BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine-zipper transcription factor 2) is expressed by follicular B cells, and *Bach2*–/– mice are deficient in mature B cells; however, the relative expression levels of BACH2 in naive, activated and germinal-centre B cells are not clear. So, for BACH2, two B-cell stages are labelled ND (not determined). BLIMP1, B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1; IRF4, interferon-regulatory factor 4; MITF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; MTA3, metastasis-associated 1 family, member 3; PAX5, paired box protein 5; XBP1, X-box-binding protein 1.

B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) is present at high levels in germinal-centre B cells³⁹ and is required for germinal-centre formation⁴⁰. A crucial function of BCL-6 is to repress BLIMP1 expression (FIGS 3,4), thereby allowing the germinal-centre reaction to continue for a sufficient duration before differentiation into plasma cells occurs⁴¹,⁴². *Bcl-6*⁻/⁻ mice produce more plasma cells in a T-cell-dependent immune response than control mice, and LPS-treated *Bcl-6*⁻/⁻ B cells secrete higher levels of immunoglobulin than control cells⁴³. BCL-6 represses BLIMP1 expression by ‘interfering’ with AP1 transcriptional activators⁴⁴ and by binding a site in intron 5 of *Prdm1* (positive-regulatory-domain-containing 1), the gene that encodes BLIMP1 (REF.43). It has also been suggested that BCL-6 blocks the binding of SIGNAL TRANSDUCER AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 3 (STAT3) and thereby prevents STAT3-dependent induction of BLIMP1 expression⁴⁵. However, BCL-6 and STAT3 do not compete for binding at the BCL-6-binding site in intron 5 of *Prdm1* (REF.43). BCL-6 also represses p53 expression⁴⁶, which modulates DNA-damage responses in germinal-centre B cells.

Metastasis-associated 1 family, member 3 (MTA3) interacts directly with BCL-6 to mediate the repressive activity of BCL-6 (REF.47). When MTA3 expression is reduced using short hairpin RNA in B-cell lines, BCL-6 levels are maintained, but expression of BLIMP1 and SDC1 is induced, indicating a crucial role for MTA3 in preventing differentiation into plasma cells⁴⁷. When MTA3 and BCL-6 are overexpressed by plasma-cell lines, the levels of BLIMP1, XBP1, SDC1 and cytoplasmic IgL (κ) are reduced, whereas BLNK, SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase), CD19 and the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) are re-expressed⁴⁷. So, MTA3, together with BCL-6, has a crucial role in preventing plasmacytic differentiation, and when levels of these two regulators are artificially increased, the plasma-cell programme can be reversed.

BACH2 (BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine-zipper transcription factor 2) was recently shown to be required in mature and germinal-centre B cells⁴⁸. B cells from *Bach2*⁻/⁻ mice do not form germinal centres or upregulate the expression of AID; their immunoglobulin genes also do not undergo somatic hypermutation, affinity maturation or CSR⁴⁸. LPS-stimulated *Bach2*⁻/⁻ B cells express BLIMP1 and XBP1 at higher levels than normal B cells, indicating that BACH2 represses development into plasma cells⁴⁸, although it is not known whether plasma cells form spontaneously in the absence of BACH2.

Plasma cells. The transcriptional repressor BLIMP1 is sufficient, when ectopically expressed by B cells at the appropriate developmental stage, to drive differentiation into plasma cells⁴⁹. BLIMP1 is expressed by splenic and bone-marrow plasma cells⁵⁰,⁵¹ and is required for plasma-cell formation and immunoglobulin secretion²⁷. BLIMP1 initiates cascades of gene regulation (FIG.4), leading to cessation of the cell cycle (by direct repression of genes such as *MYC*⁵²), repression of genes that are required for the identity of mature and germinal-centre B cells (including genes that regulate signalling through the BCR, T-cell–B-cell interactions, CSR and somatic hypermutation) and induction of the immunoglobulin secretory programme⁵³,⁵⁴. BLIMP1 represses the expression of two transcription factors that are required for germinal-centre reactions — BCL-6 (REF.53) and PAX5 (REF.31) — thereby ensuring that, after plasma-cell development is induced, B cells cannot return to an earlier developmental stage (FIG.3). Repression of PAX5 expression is important not only for inhibiting B-cell functions but also for allowing plasma-cell development by derepressing expression of the IgH, the IgL, the J chain and XBP1 (REFS 27,34). BLIMP1 is also responsible for the induction of expression of many genes in the plasma-cell programme, such as IRF4 (REFS 51,55) and genes that are involved in immunoglobulin secretion⁵⁴.

XBP1 was the first transcription factor that was shown to be uniquely required for plasmacytic differentiation⁵⁶. XBP1 acts downstream of BLIMP1 and seems to be the proximal regulator of the secretory phenotype in plasma cells (discussed later).

IRF4 is a transcriptional activator that seems to function early in plasma-cell development because, in addition to being required for plasma-cell formation, it is required for the initial proliferative burst of activated B cells<sup>57</sup>, which does not require BLIMP1 (REF. 27) or XBP1 (REF. 56). However, our current information about IRF4 is contradictory. For example, some studies indicate that IRF4 acts downstream of BLIMP1 (REFS 51,55). Consistent with this, IRF4 is expressed by plasma cells and by a small proportion of germinal-centre cells that also express BLIMP1 (REFS 50,58). Although the role of IRF4 in plasma cells has not been extensively studied, IRF4 might induce high-level transcription of immunoglobulin genes, because it has been shown to bind enhancers in the IgL κ- and λ-loci<sup>59,60</sup>. However, because it is required for the proliferation of activated B cells, IRF4 could be involved in ‘licensing’ a B cell for plasma-cell development by inducing the proliferation required for terminal differentiation. Such a model is appealing because loss of MITF leads to spontaneous formation of plasma cells and induction of IRF4 expression<sup>38</sup>.

Transition to the plasma-cell stage. Cells develop double negative-feedback mechanisms to ensure that different developmental states are maintained in a mutually exclusive manner (FIG. 3). That there is an irreversible plasma-cell programme is reasonable because plasma cells never revert to B cells *in vivo*. But, how is it that B cells overcome the repressive mechanisms that block plasma-cell development and can then progress to become plasma cells? Signals that cause changes in transcription-factor expression provide important clues to this largely unanswered question (TABLE 1).

Reduction of BCL-6 levels might be important for relieving the repression of BLIMP1 expression. Signals that cause differentiation into plasma cells *in vitro*, including immunoglobulin-specific antibodies, CD40L and polyclonal activators, all lead to decreased levels of BCL-6 mRNA in B cells<sup>61</sup>. Also, crosslinking of the BCR induces phosphorylation of BCL-6 by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and subsequent proteosome-dependent degradation of BCL-6 protein<sup>62</sup>. It will be important to determine which signal(s) *in vivo* is crucial for decreasing BCL-6 levels.

Other regulators of the germinal-centre stage are also present at decreased levels in plasma cells: MTA3 is not found in plasmacytoma lines<sup>47</sup>; BACH2 levels are decreased in plasma cells<sup>48,63</sup>; and Mitf mRNA levels fall on stimulation with LPS, IL-5, or IgM- or CD40-specific antibodies<sup>38</sup>. So, the levels of all of the transcription factors that are known to enforce a B-cell programme and repress differentiation into plasma cells decrease on plasmacytic differentiation. However, the signals and mechanisms that are responsible for their regulation are not understood and present an important challenge for future studies.

In addition to relief from repression, plasma-cell factors such as BLIMP1 might require activating signals for induction of their expression. Antigen-mediated signalling through the BCR can result in B-cell proliferation, death or differentiation, and the strength of signal and the presence of varying supplementary signals affect the outcome. Signals from the BCR lead to degradation of BCL-6 (REF. 62), but there is no evidence of induction of BLIMP1 expression. In fact, IgM-specific antibodies inhibit the induction of BLIMP1 expression and the

Figure 3 | Transcriptional repression enforces mutually exclusive B-cell and plasma-cell gene-expression programmes. Several transcription factors — BCL-6 (B-cell lymphoma 6), MTA3 (metastasis-associated 1 family, member 3), MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) and PAX5 (paired box protein 5) — repress plasmacytic development by repressing BLIMP1 (B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1), XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1) and IRF4 (interferon-regulatory factor 4). In plasma cells, BLIMP1 represses B-cell gene-expression programmes. This mutual repression prevents the unelicited formation of plasma cells in the germinal centre and prevents the reversion of plasma cells to a B-cell stage. BCR, B-cell receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor.

BCL-6, MTA3, PAX5 and MITF also regulate the expression of genes that are required for B-cell and germinal-centre functions, which are outlined in the pink box. BLIMP1, XBP1 and IRF4 induce the expression of genes that are required for plasma cells, which are outlined in the blue box.

located upstream of the transcription start sites in *Prdm1* (the gene encoding BLIMP1), and 3T3 cells (murine fibroblasts) that lack the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB fail to induce expression of BLIMP1 in response to Sendai virus, which is consistent with TLR-dependent induction of BLIMP1 expression through NF-κB activation (C. Tunyaplin and K.C., unpublished observations).

Cytokines have an important role in plasma-cell development. In cell lines, the combination of IL-2 and IL-5 (REF. 49), or IL-6 alone⁶⁹, is sufficient to induce production of mRNA encoding BLIMP1. IL-6 also induces XBP1 expression by multiple myeloma cells⁷⁰, but this could be secondary to induction of BLIMP1 expression. In human centrococyte cultures, IL-10, in conjunction with other mediators, induces production of mRNA encoding BLIMP1 (T. Kuo, Y. Choi and K.C., unpublished observations). IL-21 strongly induces BLIMP1 expression, and in the presence of IgM-specific antibodies, it increases the number of plasma cells⁷¹. Interestingly, IL-21 induces the expression of both BLIMP1 and BCL-6, indicating that it might function at a unique point in late B-cell differentiation. Although multiple downstream pathways are activated by cytokines, STATs have an important role, and there is evidence that STAT3 induces transcription of the gene encoding BLIMP1 (REFS 45,72).

### Regulation of immunoglobulin secretion

BLIMP1 and XBP1 are required for immunoglobulin secretion, and their individual roles have been identified⁵⁴ (FIG. 5). BLIMP1 derepresses the transcription of IgH, IgL and the J chain by repression of PAX5 expression³¹,³⁵,³⁷,⁷³. It also induces expression of IRF4 (REFS 51,55) and OBF1 (octamer-binding transcription factor (OCT)-binding factor 1)⁵³,⁵⁴. IRF4 activates the IgL κ- and λ-loci enhancers, and OBF1 activates a 3′ enhancer of IgH⁷⁴ and a subset of IgL κ-locus promoters⁷⁵. In addition, the switch to expression of mRNA that encodes the secreted form of the μ IgH (μS) requires BLIMP1 (REF. 27). This developmentally regulated switch depends on differential polyadenylation, splicing and polymerase pausing⁷⁶–⁷⁹. There is no evidence that proteins that were previously reported to regulate μS production depend on BLIMP1; however, expression of the transcription elongation factor ELL2 (elongation factor, RNA polymerase II, 2) is induced by BLIMP1⁵⁴,⁵⁵, indicating that it could be important for switching from generation of μM to μS.

An unfolded-protein response (UPR) increases the ability of the endoplasmic reticulum to fold and translocate proteins, decreases the synthesis of proteins, and causes the arrest of the cell cycle and apoptosis⁸⁰,⁸¹. Although some UPR activities (such as endoplasmic reticulum expansion) are associated with plasmacytic differentiation, others (such as decreased protein synthesis) are not. So, it has been suggested that plasma cells use a ‘physiological’ UPR, in contrast to a stress-induced UPR⁵⁴,⁸². The UPR in plasma cells involves processing of mRNA that encodes XBP1 by INOSITOL-REQUIRING 1α (IRE1α; a protein kinase that has endoribonuclease activity)⁸³ to encode a more stable, active protein.

differentiation into plasma cells of mouse splenic B cells in the presence of LPS⁶⁴. In the presence of CD40-specific antibodies, IL-4 and IL-5, multivalent BCR signalling drives plasma-cell formation much more efficiently than standard immunoglobulin-specific antibodies⁶⁵. Furthermore, the addition of IL-2 and IL-5 can overcome the effects of IgM-specific antibodies to drive induction of BLIMP1 expression⁶⁴. So, to induce BLIMP1 expression, a strong signal from the BCR or help from cytokine-producing cells during signalling through the BCR might be required. The cytokines could be derived from dendritic cells or T cells, including (possibly) a newly recognized subset of Ly6C⁺ T helper cells⁶⁶.

In the absence of BCR ligation, the TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4 (TLR4) ligand LPS is sufficient to induce the expression of BLIMP1 by mouse splenic B cells and their development into plasma cells³¹,⁵³,⁵⁴,⁶⁴. Also, treatment of human centrococytes or CD20⁺CD38⁻ memory cells with CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides, which signal through TLR9, induces expression of mRNA encoding BLIMP1 and differentiation into plasma cells (T. Kuo, Y. Choi and K.C., unpublished observations), although this might depend on the IL-10 secretion that is induced by this treatment⁶⁷. TLRs signal through activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK)⁶⁸. Interestingly, NF-κB-binding sites are

TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR (TLR). Member of a family of receptors that is homologous to *Drosophila melanogaster* Toll. TLRs recognize different molecular patterns that are present in pathogens.

INOSITOL-REQUIRING 1α (IRE1α). An integral membrane protein that is resident in the endoplasmic reticulum and has kinase and endoribonuclease activity. It is activated in the unfolded-protein response and processes mRNA that encodes X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1).

Increased IgH expression is required to activate IRE1α-dependent processing of Xbp1 mRNA<sup>84</sup>. XBP1 is crucial for the plasma-cell secretory programme<sup>54</sup>, and expression of mRNA that encodes XBP1 is induced by ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 6 (ATF6)<sup>-85</sup>, IL-4- (REF. 84) and BLIMP1-dependent repression of PAX5 expression<sup>27</sup>. In B-cell lines and splenic B cells, XBP1 induces the expression of genes that are involved in targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, folding of proteins, degradation of misfolded proteins, glycosylation of proteins, trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi, trafficking in the endosomal pathway, and targeting of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane<sup>54</sup>. Additionally, XBP1 increases the mass and function of mitochondria, the size of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the overall size of the cell<sup>54</sup>. XBP1 induces expression of p58<sup>IPK</sup>, which can inhibit PERK (RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase), a UPR component that is associated with cessation of protein translation but does not induce apoptosis-associated expression of CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein; also known as DDIT3), reinforcing the idea that the plasma-cell UPR is specialized.

Although, after LPS treatment of murine lymphoma cells, CHOP expression is not induced together with the other proteins involved in the UPR<sup>82</sup>, and although ectopic XBP1 does not induce CHOP expression<sup>54</sup>, BLIMP1 induces CHOP expression when it is over-expressed by lymphoma lines<sup>53,55</sup>. So, either the induction of CHOP expression is not physiological, or BLIMP1 might regulate genes that are involved in the UPR in an XBP1-independent manner. Indeed, because endoplasmic-reticulum chaperones and folding enzymes are expressed before immunoglobulin accumulates to the highest levels<sup>86</sup>, additional levels of regulation might be present.

ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION
FACTOR 6
(ATF6). A basic leucine-zipper transcription factor that, when activated by cleavage, initiates expression of genes that are involved in the unfolded-protein response.

Long-lived plasma cells

Antibodies specific for viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus persist after viral clearance. However, in the blood, the half-life of antibodies is short<sup>87</sup>; therefore, this indicates the continuous presence of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Plasma cells mainly disappear from the spleen within 2 weeks of infection, but they are present in the bone marrow for up to 1 year, indicating that the bone marrow is the site of long-term antibody production<sup>88</sup>. Bone-marrow plasma cells persist in the absence of DNA synthesis<sup>89</sup>, and *in vivo* depletion of memory B cells and adoptive transfer of virus-specific plasma cells show that a substantial proportion of plasma cells survive and continue to secrete antibody for more than 1 year in the absence of detectable memory B cells<sup>90</sup>. So, although there is evidence that some long-term immunity is derived from continuous differentiation of memory B cells (discussed above), at least some persistent antibodies are derived from long-lived plasma cells, independent of memory B cells and antigen<sup>91</sup>. Although there is evidence that some long-lived plasma cells are present in the spleen<sup>92</sup>, it is generally agreed that the bone marrow is the primary site of long-lived plasma cells (FIG. 6).

Long-lived plasma cells are interesting for several reasons. First, from the perspective of fundamental lymphocyte biology, it is important to understand the mechanisms that are responsible for prolonged survival of bone-marrow plasma cells. In short-term cultures, after B cells differentiate into plasma cells, they stop dividing and die within a few days. This pro-apoptotic tendency of plasma cells is underscored by the fact that

BLIMP1 represses expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein A1 (also known as BCL-2A1) and induces expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such as growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) and CHOP<sup>53,93</sup>. Is the reversal of this pro-apoptotic tendency solely a consequence of survival signals derived from the bone marrow, or does it involve differentiative changes in long-lived plasma cells? Second, understanding regulation of the survival mechanism could be important for designing vaccines. Last, autoantibodies are pathogenic in various autoimmune diseases, and in cases in which long-lived plasma cells provide a considerable source of pathogenic autoantibodies, these cells are not effectively eliminated by existing treatments that target dividing cells or CD20<sup>+</sup> cells<sup>94,95</sup>. A recent study of mice prone to developing systemic lupus erythematosus showed that 40% of autoantibody-secreting plasma cells were long-lived and were not eliminated by treatment with antiproliferative drugs<sup>96</sup>. So, it is important to learn whether or how long-lived plasma cells might be forced to die or to cease antibody secretion.

Which plasma cells migrate to the bone marrow and why? Antibodies produced by ASCs present in the bone marrow are of high affinity. Furthermore, disruption of the germinal-centre reaction with a CD40-specific antibody showed that selection in the germinal centre was required to generate high-affinity ASCs in the bone marrow — although (by a yet-to-be-determined mechanism) affinity maturation continues after cessation of the germinal-centre reaction<sup>97</sup>. Although long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow seem to be derived from post-germinal-centre plasma cells, one report provides evidence that long-lived plasma cells in the spleen can also be derived from the early extrafollicular response<sup>92</sup>.

Chemokine receptors, integrins and carbohydrates that bind selectins are important in determining the ability of developing plasma cells to exit germinal centres and migrate to the bone marrow, the mucosa or sites of inflammation<sup>98</sup>. Reduced expression of CXC chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) and CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) causes plasma cells to have decreased responsiveness to the B-cell-zone and T-cell-zone chemokines CXCL13, CC-chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19) and CCL21 (REF. 99). So, reduction of CXCR5 levels allows post-germinal-centre cells to exit from the follicles, whereas CXCR5 is not important for early extrafollicular plasma-cell formation<sup>100</sup>. Expression of CXCR4 is crucial for plasma-cell homing to the splenic red pulp, lymph-node medullary cords and bone marrow, all regions where the ligand CXCL12 is expressed<sup>99</sup>. Both mouse and human plasmablasts that migrate to the bone marrow express CXCR3, which binds CXCL9 (REFS 101,102); furthermore, CXCR6 and its ligand CXCL16 are also important chemokine receptors for plasma-cell homing<sup>98</sup>. Plasma cells that home to the bone marrow express α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, which binds vascular cell-adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) at the cell surface of bone-marrow epithelial cells, whereas α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-integrin at the surface of IgA-producing plasma cells from the gut facilitates retention at mucosal sites by binding

Figure 5 | Gene expression in immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells is regulated by BLIMP1 and XBP1. Induction of B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) expression in developing plasma cells leads to decreased expression of paired box protein 5 (PAX5) and increased expression of immunoglobulin. These two events are required for the expression of mRNA that encodes X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and for the activation of the endoribonuclease inositol-requiring 1α (IRE1α), which processes *Xbp1* mRNA to yield mRNA that encodes a different carboxyl terminus and a more active and stable protein. XBP1 then induces the expression of many genes that are involved in the secretory pathway, which generates a physiological unfolded-protein response. The unfolded-protein response allows the continuous production and secretion of high levels of antibody by plasma cells.

mucosal vascular addressin cell-adhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1) at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells⁹⁸. Endothelial-cell selectin (E-selectin) at the surface of bone-marrow epithelial cells is also involved in the retention of plasma cells in the bone marrow by binding polysaccharide at the plasma-cell surface¹⁰³.

Microarray analyses showed that BLIMP1 represses expression of CXCR5 (REF. 53) and induces expression of CXCR4 and α₄-integrin⁵⁵. These changes would cause plasma cells to leave follicles and migrate either to the bone marrow or to mucosal sites. It will be important to understand the regulatory pathways that induce the expression of α₄β₇-integrin versus α₄β₁-integrin and the expression of other homing and/or adhesion molecules by plasma cells that are formed at different sites and express different immunoglobulin isotypes⁹⁸.

**Figure 6 | Long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow.** Post-germinal-centre plasma cells, which express somatically mutated, class-switched immunoglobulin, lose expression of CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5), facilitating their exit from the germinal centre. These cells then increase their expression of CXCR4, which helps them to home to the bone marrow, where stromal cells produce high amounts of CXC-chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12). Endothelial-cell selectin (E-selectin) and vascular cell-adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) expressed at the surface of bone-marrow stromal cells are important for the retention of plasma cells in the bone marrow, through association with polysaccharides and integrins expressed at the surface of the plasma cells. Plasma cells induce the stromal cells to produce interleukin-6 (IL-6). B-cell-activating factor (BAFF), probably produced by macrophages or dendritic cells, activates the receptor B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and, together with IL-6, provides crucial survival signals to the plasma cells.

Survival niches for plasma cells in the bone marrow. The results of adoptive-transfer experiments and the observation that the number of plasma cells in the bone marrow reaches a plateau with age indicate that there are survival niches for plasma cells¹⁰⁴. Furthermore, the generation of new plasmablasts after immunization mobilizes the existing plasma cells to migrate to the blood, presumably from bone-marrow niches¹⁰². Long-lived plasma cells have also been found in the spleens of mice⁹² and humans¹⁰⁵, and survival niches seem to also exist (albeit in lower numbers) in the spleen. In the bone marrow, stromal cells do not secrete IL-6 until they come into contact with plasma cells¹⁰⁶. IL-6, in conjunction with B-cell-activating factor (BAFF; also known as BLYS)¹⁰⁷, IL-5, CXCL12, tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) and CD44 ligands¹⁰⁸, provides crucial survival signals to these plasma cells¹⁰⁶. In the bone marrow, BAFF mediates its effects by binding the receptor B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and *Bcma*⁻/⁻ mice have impaired survival of bone-marrow plasma cells¹⁰⁷. An important task for the future is to learn more about the bone-marrow stromal cells that provide these survival niches for plasma cells.

Regulation of long-lived plasma cells by transcriptional mechanisms. Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger-containing transcriptional regulators, is required in a B-cell-intrinsic manner for the appearance of high-affinity plasma cells in the bone marrow¹⁰⁹. In *Aiolos*⁻/⁻ mice, memory B cells of high affinity were formed and gave rise to short-lived plasma cells, but these did not appear in the bone marrow. BLIMP1, XBP1 and BCL-6 are expressed normally in *Aiolos*⁻/⁻ mice; furthermore, no differences in chemokine-receptor mRNA expression were found. So, the crucial target gene(s) that is affected is unidentified at present, but it might encode a protein that is required for migration to, or retention in, the bone marrow or for the response to survival signals. Further analysis of these mice should provide important insight into long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow.

Continued expression of appropriate transcription factors is required to maintain plasma cells. BCL-6 and MTA3 can reverse the plasma-cell phenotype when they are ectopically expressed by transformed human plasma-cell lines⁴⁷. Although the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood, the levels of mRNA that encode BLIMP1 and XBP1 were reduced. It will be interesting to learn whether PAX5 expression was also derepressed, as indicated by induction of BLNK expression and repression of XBP1 expression⁴⁷. It is intriguing that, although plasma cells are terminally differentiated, this state can be reversed under special conditions.

Alterations in the levels of other transcription factors, however, cause the death of plasma cells. Proteasome inhibitors suppress the activity of IRE1α, thereby impairing generation of active, processed XBP1 (REF. 110). These inhibitors cause myeloma cells to undergo apoptosis, owing to endoplasmic-reticulum stress, presumably resulting from lack of XBP1 and

subsequent failure to maintain the secretory programme<sup>110</sup>. In these cells, it is probable that BLIMP1 expression continues and that PAX5 and BCL-6 are not expressed, in contrast to the situation when BCL-6 and MTA3 expression is forced. Recently, we have observed that continued expression of BLIMP1 is required for maintenance of long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow, although in this case, it is not known whether the cells die or dedifferentiate (M.S.S. and K.C., unpublished observations).

The loss of bone-marrow plasma cells after BLIMP1 removal and the reversal of the plasma-cell phenotype when BCL-6 and MTA3 expression is forced in plasma-cell lines<sup>47</sup> have interesting mechanistic implications. BLIMP1 associates with GRG (Groucho-related gene) protein<sup>111</sup>, histone deacetylases<sup>112</sup> and G9A histone methyltransferase<sup>113</sup>, all proteins that covalently modify histones. BCL-6 also associates with histone-deacetylase complexes. A continued requirement for BLIMP1 in plasma cells and the observation that increasing the level of BCL-6 and MTA3 and reducing the level of BLIMP1 reverses the plasma-cell phenotype<sup>47</sup> indicate that BLIMP1-dependent epigenetic changes in BLIMP1 target genes are not permanently maintained, despite the concept that histone methylation is a relatively stable modification.

It is intriguing, but not understood at present, how or why changes in different transcription factors cause the dedifferentiation or death of plasma cells. However, the studies discussed here emphasize that maintenance of the plasma-cell fate requires continued expression of BLIMP1 and XBP1 and continued lack of PAX5, BCL-6 and MTA3. This knowledge is likely to provide targets for developing drugs that can block the functions of long-lived plasma cells in autoimmunity.

### Concluding remarks

Progress towards identifying and characterizing the crucial transcriptional regulators of plasmacytic development has been rapid and sustained in recent years. It is now understood that (not surprisingly) plasmacytic development involves more components and is more complex than originally proposed in early models involving only a few transcription factors. Our current understanding of regulatory networks provides a strong basis for further investigation, which will probably allow us to identify additional components and interesting feedback mechanisms.

Considerably less is understood about the mechanisms, especially in the germinal centre, that determine late B-cell development and how such mechanisms regulate the abundance or activity of known transcriptional regulators. Our understanding of the mutually exclusive B-cell and plasma-cell gene-expression programmes (FIGS 3,4) is largely derived from analysis of cells in one developmental stage or the other, but it does not reveal how transitions occur between these stages. Although early extrafollicular plasma cells form rapidly, post-germinal-centre plasma cells might pass through a memory and pre-plasma memory stage before becoming plasma cells<sup>27</sup>. In both cases (extrafollicular and post-germinal-centre), a proliferative plasmablast stage precedes differentiation into plasma cells. It seems probable that combinations of signals mediated by antigen and cytokines and delivered through TLRs and TNF receptors instruct the terminal differentiation of B cells and that they do so by changing the concentration and/or activity of transcription factors. Different signal combinations could lead to multiple intermediate stages at which the relative activities of key regulators vary, thereby leading to differential effects on various target genes. This could alter the timing or nature of the ultimate developmental outcome. For example, although secretion of immunoglobulin and cessation of the cell cycle are both induced by BLIMP1 (REFS 52,53,114), the secretory phenotype is acquired before the cessation of the cell cycle<sup>28,29</sup>. So, BLIMP1 target genes that are involved in immunoglobulin secretion might respond to lower levels of BLIMP1 than those genes involved in cessation of the cell cycle. Cessation of the cell cycle might require both higher levels of BLIMP1, as found in bone-marrow plasma cells<sup>51</sup>, and reduced mitogenic signals. Understanding the signals and transcriptional programmes that determine terminal B-cell fates is an important challenge for the future.

A particularly intriguing recent finding is that, when the levels of important transcriptional regulators (such as BCL-6 and MTA3, BLIMP1 or XBP1) are altered, plasma-cell function is lost, either through dedifferentiation or apoptosis of these cells. This has important implications for drug design strategies that aim to ablate long-lived plasma cells in patients with autoimmune disease. It is also interesting in the more general sense of learning the extent to which gene-expression programmes might be stable or dynamic in cells that are terminally differentiated, and it alters our idea of terminal differentiation as an irreversible state.
