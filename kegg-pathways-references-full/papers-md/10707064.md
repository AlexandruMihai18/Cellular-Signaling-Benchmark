# Exploitation of cellular signaling and regulatory pathways by human cytomegalovirus

Elizabeth A. Fortunato, Anita K. McElroy, Veronica Sanchez and Deborah H. Spector

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is one of the largest members of the herpesvirus family. However, unlike herpes simplex virus, the growth cycle of HCMV is relatively slow; although viral DNA synthesis begins in the nucleus at 16–24 hours post infection (hpi), no virus is released until 72–96 hpi (Ref. 1). Viral gene expression
DNA) can also penetrate the cell membrane, and could therefore contribute to this initial signal transduction cascade.

Subsequent effects on the host that do require viral and cellular gene expression include increases in cAMP and cGMP levels (6–12 hpi) and increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations, which begin ~48 hpi. Viewed individually, most of the increases in signaling molecule levels appear rather insignificant (generally two- or threefold above mock infection levels). However, the importance of these events for the establishment of a productive infection is highlighted by the fact that pre-incubation of cells with papaverine, a
intricate G-protein-coupled cascade, summarized in Fig. 1 (Ref. 8). The primary support for this hypothesis is the observation that NF-κB sequence-specific binding and ROI generation are prevented by pretreatment of vascular (V) SMCs with pertussis toxin, which blocks a subset of G-protein-coupled signaling. However, analysis of some of the steps between the two endpoints in the proposed pathway shows at most twofold stimulation in infected cells, indicating the need for additional pathways or protein interactions by which ROIs can be generated. This is further suggested by a recent paper in which Speir *
the surface of cells late in infection<sup>31</sup>. Subsequent G-protein signaling and ERK2 activation lead to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which could be important for late viral events. Thus, there appears to be a need for kinase modification at all stages of HCMV infection. Coupling the inhibition of phosphatase activity<sup>27</sup> with the stimulation of kinase activity at multiple points in the infection has the potential to provide the virus with a potent means of prolonging the function of the various cellular and viral effectors described in this review.

cyclin, is almost undetectable, whereas the steady-state concentration of cyclin B, the mitotic cyclin, is markedly increased early in infection. If one couples the temporal dysregulation of these important cyclins with the fact that cyclin A-associated kinase activity is necessary for initiation of cellular DNA synthesis, it is not surprising that G0-infected cells arrest without replicating their DNA.

The regulation of cyclins A and E by HCMV occurs at the RNA level²⁵. Cyclin E transcription is normally regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors. In a classic model of E2F-mediated regulation, a

genes bind the MHC class I heavy chains and transport them in a retrograde fashion from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteasome. The US3 glycoprotein acts to prevent the transport of the assembled MHC class I complexes from the ER to the golgi. Another protein, US6, inhibits peptide translocation into the ER by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). In addition, HCMV encodes an MHC class I homolog, UL18, that has been implicated in inhibiting natural killer (NK
Hirsch and Shenk controlled for this variable by using purified virus, Bodaghi and colleagues did not, and therefore their observed mRNA levels might represent a balance between induction and inhibition. However, both studies are complicated by the fact that MCP-1 mRNA levels present in uninfected cells appear to be variable, making it difficult to establish a true baseline.

HCMV also modulates a number of cellular factors involved in inflammatory and immunological reactions. In fact, the regulation of these factors might be particularly relevant to vascular injury and cardiac allograft rejection associated with HCMV infection.
