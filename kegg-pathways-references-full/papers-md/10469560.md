A mitotic checkpoint arrests cell cycle progression in response to spindle damage. It now appears that this checkpoint has two separate arms, one that prevents anaphase and a second that prevents cytokinesis and DNA re-replication.

In recent years, considerable attention has focussed on understanding how anaphase and cytokinesis are regulated to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. Progress in this field has resulted from a true synergy between classical cell biology and yeast genetics. Elegant cytological analysis of mammalian cells has identified a surveillance mechanism able to detect kinetochores that are not correctly attached to the spindle and delay anaphase accordingly [1]. Genetic analysis in yeast has identified some of the molecules involved in this surveillance mechanism: the *MAD* and *BUB* genes are required to arrest cell cycle progression in response to spindle damage [2]. Vertebrate homologues of yeast Mad1, Mad2, Bub1 and Bub3 have been shown to localise to kinetochores during mitosis and are believed to be involved in a single checkpoint pathway that delays anaphase in response to unattached kinetochores. Bub2 was assumed to be part of this single checkpoint pathway as well [2], although two often overlooked observations suggested that this might not be the case [3,4]. Four recent papers [5–8] have now shown that Bub2 is in fact part of a separate pathway that regulates cytokinesis, the exit from mitosis and continued cell cycle progression, and operates in parallel with the pathway that delays anaphase.

The onset of anaphase and the exit from mitosis are mediated by the degradation of several key proteins. These proteins are targeted for degradation by an E3 ubiquitin ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) [9]. The APC covalently adds a ubiquitin side chain to its substrate, and this side chain is then recognised by the proteasome as a signal for proteolysis. Thus, by irreversibly inactivating its target proteins, the APC drives progression through mitosis. To ensure the correct temporal order of mitotic events, the APC must be tightly regulated. This regulation is mediated by two related but distinct targeting proteins called Cdc20 and Cdh1 [9]. When activated by Cdc20, the APC targets the anaphase inhibitor Pds1 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Figure 1). Once Pds1 has been degraded, sister chromatid separation occurs and chromosome segregation takes place. In contrast, when activated by Cdh1, the APC targets the mitotic cyclin Clb2 for degradation, thereby driving cytokinesis and the exit from mitosis.

Cdc20 is the downstream target of the kinetochore attachment checkpoint [9] and is regulated by Mad2. By binding and inhibiting Cdc20, Mad2 prevents it from activating the APC and thereby protects Pds1 from degradation and inhibits anaphase. In the absence of Mad2, cells cannot protect Pds1 from degradation following spindle damage and hence undergo a premature anaphase. However, cells lacking Mad2 are competent to block cytokinesis and DNA re-replication in response to spindle damage [5], despite Pds1 being prematurely degraded. This indicates that there is a Mad2-independent mechanism which can inhibit cell cycle progression. Furthermore, in the absence of Bub2, Pds1 degradation is still inhibited following spindle damage, suggesting that Bub2 is not part of the pathway that regulates Cdc20.

If Mad2 and Bub2 are components of separate pathways that regulate cell cycle progression following spindle damage, deletion of both genes should have an additive effect. Reassuringly, the four recent papers [5–8] have now shown this to be so: in response to spindle damage, *mad2 bub2* double mutants exit mitosis prematurely and replicate their DNA with similar kinetics to wild-type cells with undamaged spindles. These observations provide concrete evidence for two separate arms to the mitotic checkpoint: a Mad2-dependent arm which inhibits Pds1 degradation mediated by APC-Cdc20 and thereby prevents anaphase; and a Bub2-dependent arm which protects Clb2 from degradation mediated by APC-Cdh1, thereby preventing cytokinesis and continued cell cycle progression.

How then does Bub2 protect Clb2 from degradation? The answer to this question has come from the analysis of several budding yeast genes that encode a group of late mitotic regulators termed the ‘mitotic exit network’. Mutations affecting components of this network result in telophase arrest, indicating that the network is required to exit mitosis but not to initiate anaphase [10]. Components of the mitotic exit network include Cdc14, Cdc15, Cdc5, Mob1, Dbf2 and Tem1. The protein phosphatase Cdc14 has recently been shown to trigger mitotic exit by activating both Sic1, a Cdk1 inhibitor, and APC-Cdh1 [11]. Significantly, in a *cdc14 mad2 bub2* triple mutant, DNA re-replication is inhibited in response to spindle damage,

indicating that Cdc14 is a cell cycle effector of the Bub2 checkpoint signal [5]. Analysis of the Dbf2 protein kinase also suggests that the mitotic exit network is a downstream target of Bub2. Following spindle damage, Dbf2 activity is repressed and Bub2, but not Mad2 or Bub3, is required for this repression [6].

A mechanism to account for how Bub2 regulates the mitotic exit network has come from studies on the fission yeast homologue of Bub2, termed Cdc16, which is required both for regulating septation during a normal cell cycle and for checkpoint arrest in response to spindle damage. Cdc16 functions with a partner, Byr4, and together they form a two-component GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that regulates the GTPase Spg1 [12]. When bound to GTP, Spg1 recruits the Cdc7 protein kinase and generates a signal that induces septation [13]. Thus, by maintaining Spg1 in the GDP-bound form, the GAP activity of Cdc16–Byr4 inhibits signaling mediated by Cdc7 and prevents septation. The budding yeast homologue of Spg1 is the mitotic exit network component Tem1. Overexpression of TEM1 in a Mad2-deficient strain results in complete abrogation of the mitotic checkpoint, consistent with the notion that the Tem1 GTPase is a target of the Bub2 signal [5]. A budding yeast homologue of Byr4 has also been identified. Whereas byr4 budding yeast mutants display a moderate checkpoint defect, byr4 mad2 double mutants completely lack mitotic checkpoint function [5, 7], consistent with Byr4 having a role in the Bub2 checkpoint pathway in budding yeast.

If Bub2 is not part of the Mad2-dependent pathway that responds to unattached kinetochores, what aspect of a damaged spindle does Bub2 respond to? Cytological analysis suggests that the Bub2 checkpoint pathway might be involved in monitoring or co-ordinating events at the spindle poles. In fission yeast, Cdc16, Byr4, Spg1 and Cdc7 have all been shown to localise to the spindle poles during mitosis [13]. Consistent with these observations, Bub2 and Byr4 also localise to spindle poles in budding yeast [7, 8].

A model which can incorporate these recent observations describing how the Bub2 checkpoint pathway contributes to cell cycle arrest in response to spindle damage is outlined in Figure 1. The presence of unattached kinetochores activates the Mad2-dependent pathway that protects Pds1 from APC-Cdc20-targeted degradation, and thus inhibits anaphase. In response to distinct events, conceivably at the spindle pole, the Bub2-dependent pathway prevents activation of the mitotic exit network by maintaining the Tem1 GTPase in the GDP-bound form. As a result, Cdc14 remains sequestered in the nucleolus [14, 15], and APC-Cdh1 and Sic1 are not activated. Consequently, Cdk1 remains active and the exit from mitosis, cytokinesis and DNA re-replication are inhibited.

A model showing how spindle damage results in cell cycle arrest in budding yeast. In response to unattached kinetochores, a Mad2-dependent pathway inhibits anaphase by protecting Pds1 from degradation mediated by APC-Cdc20. The response to unattached kinetochores also requires Bub1, Bub3, Mad1 and Mad3 proteins. Distinct events, conceivably at the spindle pole, activate a Bub2-dependent pathway that maintains Tem1 in the GDP-bound form. Consequently, components of the mitotic exit network such as Cdc15, Cdc5 and Dbf2 are not activated, and hence Cdc14 remains inactive. Clb2 is therefore protected from degradation mediated by APC-Cdh1, and Sic1 is inactive. Cdk1 activity is therefore sustained, which prevents cytokinesis and DNA re-replication.

Although this model may be a useful framework with which to consider how the mitotic checkpoint operates, it is clearly an oversimplification. For example, components of the mitotic exit network have other roles in addition to activating Cdc14 ([6, 10, 14] and references therein). In addition, in the absence of Bub2, Cdk1 inactivation is still inhibited following spindle damage [5]. This inhibition depends on Pds1, suggesting that Pds1 must somehow be able to regulate the Bub2-dependent pathway to inhibit both Cdh1 and Sic1. The dependency of Clb2 degradation may serve to ensure that cytokinesis is not initiated before anaphase. However, the

mechanism by which Pds1 protects Clb2 from proteolysis remains unclear.

Another unresolved issue concerns the role of the Mps1 protein kinase. Overexpression of Mps1 results in mitotic arrest, which depends on all the Bub and Mad proteins, suggesting that Mps1 acts at the top of both arms of the checkpoint [5,6,8,16]. However, Mps1 is required for arrest mediated by a dominantly acting *BUB1* allele [17], which would imply that Mps1 is downstream of Bub1. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that Mps1 physically interacts with the mitotic exit network component Mob1 [18], indicating that perhaps Mps1 acts downstream of Bub2. One possible explanation to account for these rather confusing observations is that overexpression of Mps1 might somehow affect spindle pole structure independently of its checkpoint function, thereby activating both arms of the checkpoint as a secondary rather than primary effect.

It is also unclear what role the mitotic checkpoint pathways have in co-ordinating events during a normal mitosis. In human cells, disruption of the mitotic checkpoint accelerates the completion of mitosis [19,20]. In budding yeast, however, loss of Pds1, Bub2 or Mad2 does not result in a detectable acceleration of mitotic progression [5,8]. Although this suggests that sister chromatid separation may be inhibited by a second, Pds1-independent mechanism, it is also possible that, under normal conditions, it takes less time to align all the chromosomes on the spindle than it does to activate the machinery required to separate the sister chromatids. How the Bub2 checkpoint signal is switched off during a normal mitosis remains to be determined. One possibility is that activation of Lte1, a putative guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the Tem1 GTPase [21], reverses the Bub2 inhibitory signal and thus activates the mitotic exit network. In this case, a dependency of Lte1 activation upon anaphase could provide a means to co-ordinate the onset of cytokinesis with successful chromosome segregation.

The kinetochore attachment checkpoint is conserved from yeast to man [2]. This newly identified arm of the mitotic checkpoint appears to be conserved in both budding and fission yeast, but there are some differences. For example, the Bub2 homologue Cdc16 is required to regulate septation every cell cycle in fission yeast and hence deletion of *CDC16* is lethal. In contrast, *BUB2* is a non-essential gene in budding yeast. Whether the Bub2-dependent checkpoint mechanism is conserved in human cells remains to be seen. However, in light of recent observations that implicate mitotic checkpoint control in tumour suppression [22], it is unlikely to be long before we find out.
