### Abstract

Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters including P-glycoprotein (Pgp/ABCB1), multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs/ABCC) as well as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) function as ATP-dependent drug efflux transporters, which form a unique defense network against multiple chemotherapeutic drugs and cellular toxins. Among antitumor agents is the important group of folic acid antimetabolites known as antifolates. Antifolates such as methotrexate (MTX), pemetrexed and raltitrexed exert their cytotoxic activity via potent inhibition of folate-dependent enzymes essential for purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and thereby block DNA replication. Overexpression of MRPs and BCRP confers resistance upon malignant cells to various hydrophilic and lipophilic antifolates. Apart from their central role in mediating resistance to antifolates and other anticancer drugs, MRPs and BCRP have been recently shown to transport naturally occurring reduced folates. This was inferred from various complementary systems as follows: (a) Cell-free systems including ATP-dependent uptake of radiolabeled folate/MTX into purified inside-out membrane vesicles from stable transfectants and/or cells overexpressing these transporters, (b) Decreased accumulation of radiolabeled folate/MTX in cultured tumor cells overexpressing these transporters, as well as (c) In vivo rodent models such as Eisi hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR) that hereditarily lack MRP2 in their canalicular membrane and thereby display a bile that is highly deficient in various reduced folate cofactors and MTX, when compared with wild type Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats. In all cases, these folate/antifolate transporters functioned as high capacity, low affinity ATP-driven exporters. While the mechanism of cellular retention of (anti)folates is mediated via (anti)folylpolyglutamylation, certain efflux transporters including MRP5 (ABCC5) and BCRP were shown to transport both mono-, di- as well as triglutamate derivatives of MTX and folic acid. Furthermore, overexpression of MRPs and BCRP has been shown to result in decreased cellular folate pools, whereas loss of ABC transporter expression brought about a significant expansion in the intracellular reduced folate pool. The latter finding has important implications to antifolate-based chemotherapy as an augmented cellular folate pool results in a significant level of resistance to certain antifolates. Hence, the aims of the present review are: (a) To summarize and discuss the cumulative evidence supporting a functional role for various multidrug resistance efflux transporters of the ABC superfamily which mediate resistance to hydrophilic and lipophilic antifolates, (b) To describe and evaluate the recent data suggesting a role for these efflux transporters in regulation of cellular folate homeostasis under folate replete and deplete conditions. Furthermore, novel developments and future perspectives regarding the identification of novel antifolate target proteins and mechanisms of action, as well as rationally designed emerging drug combinations containing antifolates along with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being discussed.

1. Introduction

1.1. History of antifolate efflux

The efflux of folate cofactors (Fig. 1) and folic acid antagonists known as antifolates (Fig. 2) in cultured malignant cells has been long recognized (Hakala, 1965; Goldman, 1969; Dembo et al., 1984; Assaraf and Schimke, 1987). In detailed kinetic studies initiated more than 2 decades ago by Henderson and Zevely (1984) it was shown that mammalian cells including murine L1210 and human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells as well as erythrocytes contain several ATP-driven multispecific organic anion transporters (MOAT) and/or glutathione (GSH)-conjugate (i.e. GS-X) pumps (Henderson et al., 1986; Saxena and Henderson, 1996a,b). It was found that these efflux transporters are able to transport (i.e. efflux) various organic compounds including the antifolate methotrexate (MTX). This initial dissection, which discerned between the multiple MTX efflux routes has been achieved through the utilization of an assortment of transport inhibitors (Henderson et al., 1986; Sirotnak and O'Leary, 1991). Shortly thereafter, by comparing wild-type Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats and mutant Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBRs), whose canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT/MRP2/ABCC2) is absent from the canalicular membrane as a consequence of heredity, it was shown that MTX is transported into the bile (Masuda et al., 1997). Using canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV) from wild type SD rats an ATP-dependent transport of L-MTX with a Km of ~0.3 mM was identified. Moreover, L-MTX competitively inhibited the ATP-driven transport of a classical substrate of cMOAT, \[^{3}\]H]2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (DNP-SG), with an L-MTX inhibition constant that was comparable with its own Km. Consistently, increased uptake

of MTX was directly demonstrated in membrane vesicles isolated from GLC4/ADR cells, which overexpress MRP1 (ABCC1) (Heijn et al., 1997). Subsequent key studies by Hooijberg et al. (1999) and Kool et al. (1999) have conclusively demonstrated that MRP1, MRP2 (ABCC2) and MRP3 (ABCC3) are able to transport and thereby mediate a high level of resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates including MTX.

The molecular identification of the multiple efflux pathways initially studied by Henderson and colleagues has not been addressed thereby resulting in a growing confusion as to the specific identity of these efflux transporters (Henderson et al., 1986; Saxena and Henderson, 1996a,b). However, this field of ATP-driven drug efflux transporters (Danø, 1973) recently received a renewed interest after several studies reported on the molecular cloning of various genes of the MRP family (Cole et al., 1992; Dean and Allikmets, 2001; reviewed in Borst and Oude Elferink, 2002; Kruh and Belinsky, 2003; Deeley et al., 2006).

The demonstration that MRP1, MRP2 and MRP3 are involved in MTX efflux raised the intriguing possibility that these efflux transporters may also have the facility to transport naturally occurring tetrahydrofolate (THF) cofactors (Fig. 1) and thereby may potentially play a physiological role in regulation of cellular folate homeostasis (Assaraf and Goldman, 1997). Indeed, early studies have shown the loss of function of an ATP-driven folic acid/MTX efflux pump in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that are highly resistant to pyrimethamine, a lipophilic antifolate inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (Fig. 3; Assaraf and Goldman, 1997; Jansen et al., 1999). Importantly, the loss of this ATP-dependent folate efflux function resulted in a 3-fold expansion in the cellular THF pool, thereby allowing these cells to bypass and overcome the folate-depleting effects exerted by

DHFR inhibitors; indeed, these cells displayed a 1000-fold resistance to the lipophilic antifolate pyrimethamine (Assaraf and Slotky, 1993). Consistent with these results was the key finding that naturally occurring THF coenzymes including tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-CH₃-THF), 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-CHO-THF) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5-CH₂-THF) are endogenous transport substrates for MRP2 in vitro and are secreted into the bile in wild type SD rats in vivo (Kusuhara et al., 1998). In this study, the ATP-dependent transport of the primary circulatory reduced folate 5-CH₃-THF showed a Km of 121 μM in CMV isolated from wild type SD rats. Remarkably, in the model of EHBR, rats that are hereditarily deficient in MRP2 function, the transport of these reduced folate derivatives into the bile was severely impaired or completely absent.

Hence, the primary goals of this review are to summarize and discuss the existing evidence for the mediation of antifolate resistance by MRPs and BCRP. Moreover, the cumulative data supporting a possible role for the regulation of intracellular folate pool and folate homeostasis by MRPs and BCRP are also presented and evaluated.

### 1.2. Cellular folate metabolism: de novo biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate

Unlike bacteria and plants, mammalian cells lack the ability to synthesize their own reduced folate derivatives (Fig. 1) and therefore must obtain them from exogenous sources (i.e. from the diet). Reduced folate coenzymes are essential B-complex vitamins. The most common and well-known vitamin in this group is folic acid, an oxidized stable folate form. Folic acid and reduced folates are comprised of a pteridine ring structure, a p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and a glutamate residue. Reduced folate cofactors act as donors and acceptors of one-carbon units in a series of interconnected metabolic pathways involving de novo biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate, amino acids including methionine, serine and glycine, catabolism of histidine and formic acid, as well as methyl group metabolism including CpG island DNA methylation (Fig. 3; Stokstad, 1990). Reduced folate derivatives including 10-CHO-THF contribute one-carbon units in two key de novo biosynthetic transformylase reactions. The first one involves the generation of the imidazole ring of purines through the enzyme glycineamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARTF), whereas the second reaction mediated by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICARTF) results in the formation of the purine intermediate inosinic acid (Fig. 3). The latter also known as inosine monophosphate (IMP) serves as a regulated branch point intermediate for the formation of the purine nucleotides AMP and GMP. Moreover, another important THF coenzyme is 5,10-CH₂-THF which serves as a cofactor for the key enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) which extracts a methyl group from 5,10-CH₂-THF and attaches it to dUMP thereby resulting in the formation of dTMP. Hence, these folate-dependent enzymes provide the cells with both purine and thymine nucleotides essential for DNA replication. Dihydrofolate acid (DHF), the resultant byproduct of this biosynthetic reaction is efficiently recycled to THF via an NADPH-dependent reduction catalyzed by the important enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). THF cofactors

are then interconverted enzymatically to the abovementioned various one-carbon donors (Fig. 1) thereby forming a cyclic system.

### 1.3. Antifolate anticancer drugs: disruption of folate metabolism

Recognition of the central role that folic acid metabolism plays in the *de novo* biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and DNA replication paved the way for the introduction of folic acid antagonists, the first class of antimetabolite anticancer drugs (Farber et al., 1948; Gorlick et al., 1996; Purcell and Ettinger, 2003). Nearly 60 years ago, this class of hydrophilic antifolates entered the clinics for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Specifically, aminopterin (4-amino-folic acid), a homologue of the widely used anticancer drug MTX (4-amino-10-methylfolic acid), achieved remarkable remissions in childhood ALL (Farber et al., 1948). MTX and other antifolates (Fig. 2) are integral components of different chemotherapeutic regimens currently used for the treatment of various human malignancies. These include ALL, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, choriocarcinoma and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (Walling, 2006).

Antifolates inhibit key enzymes in folate metabolism (Figs. 2 and 3). Aminopterin and MTX are potent inhibitors of DHFR, a key enzyme in folate metabolism. The pharmacologic activity of MTX as an efficacious cytotoxic agent is highly attributable to its extremely potent and almost irreversible inhibition of DHFR (Ki = 5 pM; Johnson et al., 1997). Inhibition of the catalytic activity of DHFR or one of other key enzymes in folic acid metabolism leads to the disruption of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, thereby resulting in cessation of DNA replication and cell death. Over the recent decades, second and third generation novel antifolates were synthesized; these include more potent inhibitors of DHFR such as PT523 and some of its derivatives which inhibit DHFR with a 15-fold greater affinity (Ki = 0.35 pM; Rosowsky et al., 2000). Furthermore, DHFR inhibitors like edatrexate (10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin) have been rationally synthesized which display unique properties such as much better transport via the reduced folate carrier (RFC) and increased polyglutamylation leading to augmented cellular accumulation and retention (Sirotknak et al., 1984; Schornagel et al., 1995). Rationally-designed, novel generation antifolates also include potent TS inhibitors such as raltitrexed (Tomudex; ZD1694) (Jackman et al., 1991) that has been approved for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (Cocconi et al., 1998) as well as pemetrexed (Alimta; LY231514) (Shih et al., 1997) that was registered in both the USA and Europe for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (Vogelzang et al., 2003) and non-small cell lung cancer (Hanna et al., 2004). Additionally, novel antifolates have been synthesized that are currently undergoing clinical evaluation as antitumor agents including the lipophilic antifolates nolatrexed (Thymitaq; AG337) (Pivot et al., 2001), neutrexin (trimetrexate) (Matin et al., 2005) and piritrexim (BW301U (Huie et al., 2005), the polyglutamatable hydrophilic TS inhibitor OSI-7904(L) (GW1843) (Duch et al., 1993) as well as the non-polyglutamatable TS inhibitor plevitrexed (BGC9331; ZD9331) (Jackman et al., 1997). Antifolates including raltitrexed, pemetrexed, OSI-7904(L) and plevitrexed were rationally designed to be efficiently taken up by the RFC, the primary transport system of reduced folates and antifolates (Fig. 4; see discussion in the next section). Whereas others, including the lipid-soluble antifolates nolatrexed and neutrexin were designed to enter cells by diffusion, thereby bypassing drug resistance phenomena associated with impaired drug uptake due to qualitative (i.e. inactivating mutations) and quantitative (i.e. down-regulation) alterations in the RFC (Jansen et al., 1998; Drori et al., 2000; Rothem et al., 2002). Other non-polyglutamtable hydrophilic antifolates including plevitrexed and PT523 were designed to overcome antifolate-resistance phenomena associated with impaired antifolate polyglutamylation due to decreased activity of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), the enzyme responsible for polyglutamyl conjugation of both THF cofactors and antifolates (Liani et al., 2003). Recently, a novel hydrophilic antifolate BGC945 has been synthesized that is on the one hand a potent inhibitor of TS (Ki = 1.2 nM) and on the other hand is an excellent substrate of folate receptor α (FR α; Fig. 4), a high affinity folate uptake route, but a very poor substrate for the RFC (Gibbs et al., 2005). As such, this antifolate can selectively target human malignancies such as ovarian cancers that highly overexpress FRα thereby avoiding cytotoxic side effects to most normal tissues that ubiqui-

tously express the RFC but not FRα. Validation of GARTF as an anticancer drug target came in the 1980s with the discovery of the first selective and potent inhibitor (Ki = 65 nM) lometrexol (5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid (DDATHF)) (Taylor et al., 1985). Recently, a more potent analogue of lometrexol, 10-(trifluoroacetyl)-5,10-dideazacyclic-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid has been synthesized that proved to be a tight binder of GARTF with a remarkable inhibition constant (Ki = 15 nM) and cytotoxic activity against human leukemia cells (Zhang et al., 2003). Recently, a computerized hybrid functional Petri nets (HFPN) modeling of folate metabolism under physiological conditions and antifolate inhibitory conditions has been achieved (Assaraf et al., 2006). This HFPN-based simulation offers an inexpensive, user-friendly and reliable means of pre-clinical evaluation of the inhibitory profiles of various antifolates. Hence, various key enzymes in folate metabolism have been successfully targeted thereby proving excellent determinants for the cytotoxic activity of different antifolates several of which are currently used in the combination chemotherapeutic treatment of various human cancers (Walling, 2006).

### 2. Routes for (anti)folate uptake, efflux and retention: their impact on antifolate resistance

The primary reduced folate derivative in the blood is 5-methyl-THF (Fig. 1). Cellular uptake of reduced folate derivatives including 5-methyl-THF as well as various hydrophilic antifolates proceeds at least via three independent transport routes:

(a) The most dominant pathway for the transport of (anti)folates into mammalian cells is the RFC (SLC19A1) (reviewed in Matherly and Goldman, 2003; Zhao and Goldman, 2003) (Fig. 4). RFC is a ~85 kDa membrane glycoprotein with 12 transmembrane segments (Ferguson and Flintoff, 1999; Liu and Matherly, 2002). RFC is a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters (MFS) (Saier et al., 1999). Within this very large superfamily is the solute carrier (SLC) family of facilitative carriers to which RFC belongs. The SLC family currently contains ~300 genes that have been classified in 43 sub-families (http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/). RFC mediates the transmembrane flows of folates and antifolates which are divalent anionic compounds (Figs. 1 and 2, respectively) that would otherwise diffuse very poorly through the lipid bilayer of biomembranes. RFC is devoid of an ATP-binding site, and thus free energy from ATP hydrolysis, is not utilized to drive substrate translocation. Rather, RFC which is a facilitative carrier achieves the uphill transport of folates and antifolates by binding and exchanging other organic phosphates including thiamine mono- and pyrophosphate (Zhao et al., 2002). Hence, the RFC-mediated downhill efflux of these organic phosphates (e.g. thiamine mono- and pyrophosphate) that are synthesized and retained in the cytoplasm is coupled to the uphill transport of folates and antifolates into the cells. In contrast to ABC transporters, RFC lacks a nucleotide binding fold (NBF) (i.e. ATP-binding site), and is therefore considered a low-capacity transporter. As such, the net efflux of organic phosphates via the RFC would be minimal when compared to the rate of the biosynthesis of these organic phosphates (Goldman, 1971).

(b) The second albeit more minor route of folate uptake is the low pH folate transporter that has been recently cloned (I.D. Goldman, personal communication). This transport system which functions optimally at acidic pH (5.5) takes up both oxidized (e.g. folic acid) and reduced folates as well as various hydrophilic antifolates such as MTX (Sierra et al., 1997; Sierra and Goldman, 1989; Assaraf et al., 1998). This transporter has a high relevance for the mechanism of folate and antifolate absorption in the small intestine that displays folate transport at acidic pH (5.5) but none at physiological pH (7.4).

(c) The third route involves folate receptors (FR) that are a family of high-affinity folate-binding membrane glycoproteins encoded by three distinct genes known as FRα, FRβ and FRγ (Elnakat and Ratnam, 2004, 2006). FRα and FRβ are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, whereas FRγ is a secreted protein which contains no GPI anchor. FRα exhibits a very high affinity for folic acid (Kd = 0.1 nM) but relatively lower affinity for MTX (Kd > 100 nM). The uptake of folates and antifolates via FRs occurs via a classical mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis. In contrast to the RFC that is relatively ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, FRα exhibits a restricted pattern of tissue expression.

#### 2.1. Cellular retention of (anti)folates: the key role of polyglutamylation

The primary circulatory 5-CH₃-THF is present at the monoglutamate form. However, once taken up into cells, 5-CH₃-THF, other reduced folates as well as antifolates including MTX undergo polyglutamylation, a unique metabolism aimed at increasing their cellular retention. The most dominant metabolic route for the intracellular retention of reduced folate cofactors and hydrophilic antifolates is polyglutamation (Baugh et al., 1973; McBurney and Whitmore, 1974; Moran et al., 1976; Moran, 1999). The enzyme FPGS which exists in both the cytosol and mitochondria (McGuire et al., 2000) catalyzes the sequential addition, one at a time, of multiple equivalents of glutamic acid to the γ-carboxyl group of THF cofactors and antifolates (Fig. 4). Thus, FPGS activity results in four acquired characteristics for folates and antifolates. First, polyglutamate conjugation renders folates and antifolates polyanions which can no longer traverse lipid bilayers. Second, most of the polyglutamyl derivatives of reduced folates and antifolates have an increased affinity

for THF-dependent enzymes in folate metabolism (Schirch and Strong, 1989). For example, polyglutamate derivatives of MTX efficiently block the catalytic activities of both TS and AICARTF (Allegra et al., 1985, 1987; Baggott et al., 1986). Furthermore, pentaglutamate derivatives of pemetrexed block both the enzymatic activities of TS and GARTF with inhibition constants that are approximately two orders of magnitude more potent than the parent monoglutamate drug (Shih et al., 1997). Likewise, tetraglutamate conjugates of raltitrexed are 65-fold more potent inhibitors of TS than the parent drug (Jackman et al., 1991). Third, long-chain (*n* > 3) polyglutamate derivatives of reduced folates and antifolates are no longer substrates of transport systems including influx transporters (e.g. RFC) (Matherly and Goldman, 2003) as well as efflux transporters such as MRPs (Zeng et al., 2001; Wielinga et al., 2005) and BCRP (Volk and Schneider, 2003). Consequently, polyglutamate derivatives of reduced folates and hydrophilic antifolates are efficiently retained within cells. In the case of antifolates, a consequence of increased intracellular sequestration is augmentation of their pharmacological activity through sustained inhibition of folate-dependent enzymes. Fourth, polyglutamylation allows the accumulation of folylpolyglutamates in the mitochondria, a process essential for glycine biosynthesis (Lin et al., 1993).

### 2.2. The MRP (ABCC) family of multidrug resistance efflux transporters

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) genes represent the largest and mostly expressed superfamily of transporters currently comprising 49 members in humans (Dean and Allikmets, 2001). These transmembrane transporters utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate their substrates across biological membranes. Within this large superfamily is the important family of multidrug resistance proteins (MRP), that together with the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR/ABCC7) and the sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1/ABCC8 and SUR2/ABCC9) comprise the 13 members of the human ABCC sub-family (reviewed in Deeley et al., 2006). Members of the ABCC family of proteins share conserved structural characteristics in their ATP-binding domain or nucleotide binding folds (NBFs) that distinguish them from other ABC proteins. These MRP homologues can be further classified into two sub-classes “long” (MRP1, –2, –3, –6, and –7) and “short” MRPs (MRP4, –5, –8, –9, and –10). The short MRPs have a typical ABC transporter structure with two hydrophobic polytopic membrane spanning domains (MSD₁ and MSD₂) and two hydrophilic NBFs that are localized in the cytosol; whereas, the long MRPs have an additional NH₂-terminal MSD (i.e. MSD₀). The long MRPs typically contain 17 hydrophobic transmembrane segments, whereas the short MRPs contain only 12 transmembrane segments. The MSDs of various MDR transporters have been identified as the substrate-binding sites particularly in studies using affinity probes as well as site-directed mutagenesis of certain MSDs (Loo and Clarke, 1994;

Hafkemeyer et al., 1998). The founding member of the MRP family is MRP1, first cloned in the laboratory of Cole and Deeley (Cole et al., 1992). MRP1 is an integral 190 kDa *N*-glycosylated membrane protein. Collectively, members of the MRP family confer multidrug resistance (MDR) to various hydrophobic or hydrophilic cytotoxic agents by serving as potent ATP-driven drug extrusion pumps. Among the various drug substrates of MRPs are natural product drugs and their conjugated metabolites including Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, camptothecins, taxenes, antifolates, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, peptide-based cytotoxins, platinum compounds and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Cools et al., 2005; Szakacs et al., 2006).

#### 2.3. Antifolate resistance mediated by MRPs

As mentioned above, the first direct evidence that certain members of the MRP family may be able to transport the hydrophilic antifolate MTX was provided by Masuda and colleagues (1997) who demonstrated that MTX is transported into the bile in wild type rats but not in rats hereditarily deficient in MRP2 function (i.e. EHBR). Furthermore, using CMV isolated from wild type rats Masuda et al. (1997) found an ATP-dependent transport of L-MTX with a *K*ₘ of ~0.3 mM. Moreover, L-MTX competitively inhibited the ATP-driven transport of radiolabeled 2,4-DNP-SG, a classical substrate of MRP2, with an L-MTX inhibition constant that was comparable with its own *K*ₘ. Independently, increased uptake of MTX was directly demonstrated in membrane vesicles isolated from GLC4/ADR cells which overexpress MRP1 (Heijn et al., 1997). Based on these early studies suggesting that MRP1 and MRP2 have the facility to bind and transport MTX, subsequent detailed kinetic studies with isolated membrane vesicles from transfected cells over-expressing MRP1 through MRP5 have definitively shown that all these MRPs transport MTX in an ATP-dependent manner with a typical *K*ₘ value in the millimolar range (Table 1). Certain amino acids residing in transmembrane helices of MRP1 and MRP2 have been implicated in the binding and/or translocation of MTX; specifically, substitution of a highly conserved tryptophan residue at position 1254 in the last transmembrane segment (TM17) of MRP2 resulted in the complete loss of MTX transport as well as in the disruption of the transport of leukotriene C4 and estradiol glucuronide (Ito et al., 2001a). Similar results were obtained with MRP1 after substitution of Trp1254 (Ito et al., 2001b).

Although MRPs are low affinity MTX transporters they proved to be high-capacity exporters with an average *V*ₘₐₓ value in the range of ~1 μmol/min/mg protein (Table 1). Hence, whereas the low affinity of the various MRPs for MTX may argue against a clinical relevance in chemotherapeutic regimens containing antifolates, one should bear in mind that during the chemotherapeutic treatment of certain human malignancies including osteosarcoma and ALL, as high as

lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate (neutrexin; TMQ), a lipid-soluble analogue of MTX (Hooijberg et al., 1999). Hence, unlike P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) which transports trimetrexate and confers a substantial level of resistance to this drug (Assaraf et al., 1989a,b), trimetrexate does not appear to serve as a transport substrate for these MRPs.

Several reports failed to detect any significant resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates including MTX after a continuous (72 h) drug exposure, whereas after 1–4 h of drug exposure a high-level resistance was observed (Hooijberg et al., 1999; Wijnholds et al., 2000; Wielinga et al., 2005). As discussed later in this review, this finding strongly suggested that this is an antifolate polyglutamylation-based phenomenon. Specifically, the larger the extent of antifolate polyglutamylation and the longer the polyglutamate chain, the poorer MRP-mediated antifolate efflux and antifolate resistance. Clearly, during the 1–4 h antifolate pulse exposure, no substantial antifolate polyglutamylation occurs (Spinella et al., 1996), thereby allowing for an efficient MRP-dependent drug efflux and consequent antifolate resistance. In this respect, there is ample evidence that MRP1 through MRP4 extrude MTX only at its monoglutamate form, whereas di- or longer chain polyglutamates are not transported at all. However, unlike MRP1 through MRP4, MRP5 has recently been shown to efflux MTX di-glutamates with Km and Vmax values comparable to those of MTX monoglumatates (Wielinga et al., 2005). Consequently, whereas MRP1 overexpression could confer only 3-fold resistance to raltitrexed after 4 h drug exposure (Hooijberg et al., 1999), MRP5 overexpression conferred as high as ~1700-fold resistance to this drug. The efflux of antifolate diglutamates may contribute to this ability of MRP5

to confer high-level drug resistance when compared to other MRPs.

### 2.4. The BCRP (ABCG2) multidrug resistance efflux transporter

The well-established concept of MDR (Borst and Oude Elferink, 2002; Kruh and Belinsky, 2003; Deeley et al., 2006) mediated by a single efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Riordan and Ling, 1979), was first revised after the identification of MRP1 (Cole et al., 1992). This consequently led to the discovery of the entire MRP/ABCC family of MDR efflux transporters (Deeley et al., 2006). This concept was revisited one additional time upon the molecular cloning of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2). The BCRP/ABCG2 gene was first cloned by the lab of Ross and associates (Doyle et al., 1998) from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that were stepwise selected to doxorubicin (Adr) in the continuous presence of a Pgp transport inhibitor, verapamil (Vp). This drug-resistant cell line (termed MCF-7/AdrVp) exhibited an ATP-dependent reduction in the intracellular accumulation of anthracyclines although no evidence of Pgp and MRP1 overexpression was present. In parallel, identical BCRP cDNAs were cloned from human placenta (termed ABCP) (Allikmets et al., 1999) as well as from a human colon carcinoma cell line highly resistant to mitoxantrone (the BCRP thereby termed MXR) (Miyake et al., 1999). Phylogenetic analysis of BCRP as compared to other ABC transporters revealed that the human ABCG2 gene is closely related to ABCG1, a human orthologue of the Drosophila white

gene (Croop et al., 1997). Thus, BCRP is currently classified as a member of the small ABCG sub-family of transporter proteins currently comprised of five members including ABCG1, ABCG2, ABCG4, ABCG5 and ABCG8. As an orthologue of the *Drosophila* white gene, ABCG2 belongs to the ABCG subfamily of the *Drosophila* transporters white, brown and scarlet which heterodimerize, and transport guanine and tryptophan thereby playing a key role in the uptake of eye pigment in this fly (Ewart and Howells, 1998; Sullivan and Sullivan, 1975; Sullivan et al., 1979, 1980).

Unlike other ABC transporters, members of the ABCG subfamily are “half-transporters” with a single hydrophobic MSD and two cytosolic NBFs. Hence, members of the ABCG subfamily including ABCG2 must first dimerize (Polgar et al., 2004, 2006) in order to become transport proficient. In fact, this feature is well supported by the closely related ABCG1 eye pigment orthologues of *Drosophila* that heterodimerize in order to become functionally active in the import of eye pigments. Another feature of the ABCG subfamily of transporters is that they have their ATP-binding domain (i.e. NBF) located close towards the NH₂-terminus of the polypeptide chain. Currently several lines of experimental evidence exist which support the function of ABCG2 as a homodimer. First, co-introduction of both a wild type as well as a catalytically null mutant ABCG2 cDNA bearing a K86M mutation in the consensus Walker A motif in the NBF resulted in a negative-dominant effect thereby abolishing ABCG2 function (Ozvegy et al., 2001, 2002). Second, transfected cells co-expressing both a Myc-tagged ABCG2 (MycBCRP) as well as an hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ABCG2 (HA-ABCG2) were used to probe for homodimerization (Kage et al., 2002). The resultant 140-kDa ABCG2 complex was heat-stable but dissociated into ~70 kDa ABCG2 with the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol. Furthermore, this ~140 kDa ABCG2 complex could be co-immunoprecipitated with both anti-Myc antibody and anti-HA antibody. These results clearly indicate that ABCG2 forms a homodimer, bridged and stabilized by disulfide bonds.

It is well established that ABCG2 functions as a high capacity multiple drug efflux transporter. This 72 kDa membrane glycoprotein exports a spectrum of large hydrophobic substrates, both positively and negatively charged molecules including various cytotoxic agents. Among these ABCG2 substrates are anticancer drugs including anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone and doxorubicin, epipodophyllotoxins, irinotecan (SN-38) and topotecan, bisantrene, imatinib, flavopiridol, antifolates (e.g. MTX) and their di- and tri-glutamate conjugates as well as the nucleoside analogues lamivudine and zidovudine (reviewed in Krishnamurthy and Schuetz, 2006). In addition, ABCG2 also recognizes different toxic compounds present in normal food including the dietary carcinogen PhIP and the chlorophyll derivative pheophorbide a and porphyrins. ABCG2 was also shown to extrude fluorescent substrates including Hoechst 33342, lysotracker, rhodamine 123 and novel receptor-targeted agents such as

imatinib and gefitinib (Özvegy-Lacka et al., 2005; Morgillo and Lee, 2005).

### 2.5. Antifolate resistance mediated by BCRP (ABCG2)

The first indication that BCRP may be able to transport the hydrophilic antifolate MTX was provided by Volk et al. (2000) who showed that mitoxantrone-resistant MCF-7/MX cells with marked BCRP overexpression were cross-resistant to MTX. This MTX resistance was associated with enhanced ATP-dependent drug efflux and was reversible upon treatment with the BCRP efflux inhibitor GF120918. In a follow-up paper these authors have further demonstrated that MTX resistance correlated favorably with BCRP levels in MDR cell lines with BCRP overexpression (Volk et al., 2002). Indeed, detailed kinetic studies with isolated membrane vesicles from BCRP overexpressing cell lines (Volk and Schneider, 2003) or HEK293/ABCG2 transfected cells (Chen et al., 2003b) revealed that like MRP1 through MRP5, BCRP is also a low affinity (Km = 0.7–1.3 mM) yet high capacity (Vmax = 0.7–2.4 pmol/min/mg protein) ATP-driven MTX efflux transporter (Table 1). This ATP-dependent transport of radiolabeled MTX was inhibited by the specific BCRP transport inhibitor fumitremorgin C. Subsequent studies confirmed and extended these results thereby revealing that HEK293/ABCG2 transfected cells displayed 12–43-fold resistance to other polyglutamatable hydrophilic antifolates including raltitrexed and OSI-7904(l) upon a 4 h exposure (Shafran et al., 2005; Table 3). In contrast, no substantial resistance to these antifolates was observed upon 72 h exposure. In this respect, one important characteristic distinguishing BCRP from other MRPs (excluding MRP5) is that the former is a transporter of both MTX monoglutamates as well as di- and triglutamate conjugates of MTX (Volk and Schneider, 2003; Chen et al., 2003b) (Fig. 4). As discussed above, antifolate polyglutamylation is the dominant metabolism that mediates cellular retention of naturally occurring reduced folate cofactors as well as polyglutamatable hydrophilic antifolates (McCloskey et al., 1991; Pizzorno et al., 1998; Liani et al., 2003). Therefore, antifolate polyglutamylation is an important determinant of the pharmacological activity (i.e. cytotoxicity) of antifolates. As such, overexpression of BCRP, which has the facility to extrude mono-, di-, and triglutamate derivatives of MTX should therefore interfere with antifolate polyglutamylation. Indeed, recently it was shown that introduction of ABCG2 cDNA into HEK293 cells results in a markedly diminished formation of MTX polyglutamate derivatives both after 4 h and 24 h of incubation with 1 μM MTX; for example, the triglutamate and pentaglutamate derivatives of MTX after 24 h were depressed by ~60 and 80%, respectively, relative to parental HEK293 cells (Shafran et al., 2005). Consistently, using mitoxantrone-selected MCF-7/MX breast cancer cells with BCRP overexpression it was found that the proportion of the long-chain polyglutamates of MTX (MTX-Glu₃₋₆) relative to the total amount of drug after 24 h of incubation
with 2 μM MTX was significantly reduced from 50% in parental MCF-7 cells to 30% in the MCF-7/MX cells ([Rhee and Schneider, 2005]). Moreover, when fumitremorgin C was added in order to block BCRP transport activity, the proportion of long-chain MTX polyglutamates in MCF-7/MX cells increased to levels that were substantially higher than those in parental MCF-7 cells; specifically, the proportion of the long-chain polyglutamates of MTX more than doubled when compared to the absence of this efflux inhibitor. Based on these results it is reasonable to suggest that efflux of the monoglutamate (or even the di- and triglutamate) of MTX occurring at the early stages of incubation with this drug (i.e. before FPGS converts them to long-chain polyglutamates) leads to a significant cellular depletion of these FPGS substrates. This results in a marked decrease in the formation of long-chain MTX polyglutamate conjugates (e.g. MTX-Glu₅) that are no longer transport substrates for BCRP. Hence, efflux of mono- (and perhaps also di- and triglutamate derivatives) of MTX are likely to have an indirect negative impact on MTX polyglutamylation, as reflected in the depletion of long-chain MTX polyglutamates ([Fig. 4]). However, one should bear in mind that at least one report has recently shown that no MTX-Glu₂ and MTX-Glu₃ congeners were found in the growth medium of BCRP overexpressing MCF-7/MR cells ([Rhee and Schneider, 2005]). Hence, MTX-Glu₂ and MTX-Glu₃ transport occurs *in vitro* via BCRP using a cell-free system of inside-out vesicles from BCRP overexpressing cells ([Volk et al., 2003]; [Chen et al., 2003b]). To date however, this has not apparently been observed in viable cells. One possible explanation is that at the extremely high levels of folic acid present in the growth medium (i.e. 2.3 μM being ~100-fold higher than the physiological folate level) along with the intracellular low levels of MTX-Glu₂ and MTX-Glu₃, BCRP may be efficiently competed out by the abundant folic acid in the cytosol. Clearly, further detailed studies are necessary to address this yet unresolved issue.

During the development of a rhodamine 123-based flow cytometric assay for the detection of BCRP efflux activity, a disparity was noted in the outward transport of this chromophore in BCRP-overexpressing tumor cell lines ([Honjo et al., 2001]). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the BCRP cDNAs isolated from these cell lines identified two acquired mutations, Gly482 and Thr482; these mutations substituted the wild type Arg482. Introduction of the mutant Gly482- and Thr482 BCRP genes into drug-sensitive HEK293 cells resulted in an altered BCRP transport substrate specificity and drastic shifts in the cross-resistance profiles ([Robey et al., 2003]). This included a much higher level of resistance to the anthracyclines doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin and mitoxantrone. Moreover, the Gly482 mutation conferred upon HEK293 cell transfectants an extremely high level of resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates upon 4 h drug exposure ([Table 3]); for example, these cells were 6250-fold resistant to raltitrexed, thereby being 500-fold more resistant to this antifolate than transfectants equally overexpressing the wild type Arg482 ABCG2 ([Shafran et al., 2005]).

Consistent with the impaired formation of MTX polyglutamates, the Gly482 transfectants displayed an up to 85% loss in the formation of the MTX-Glu₄ derivative, relative to parental HEK293 cells. In independent studies, HEK293 transfectant cells overexpressing the Arg482 BCRP showed no or only a low level of resistance to lipophilic antifolate inhibitors of DHFR and TS including thymitaq and neutrexin ([Bram et al., 2006]). In contrast, transfectant cells overexpressing the mutant Gly482 or Thr482 BCRP displayed more than 106-fold resistance to these lipid-soluble antifolates. Furthermore, sensitivity to these lipophilic antifolates was restored with Ko143, a potent and specific BCRP transport inhibitor. Based on the high membrane partitioning of these lipophilic antifolates along with the large confinement of BCRP to the plasma membrane it was proposed that the mutant Gly482 and Thr482 BCRP may possibly recognize and extrude lipophilic antifolates from the lipid bilayer even before they traversed the plasma membrane. Taken *in toto*, these results suggest that the Gly482 and the Thr482 BCRP genotypes are dominant gain of function mutations that appear to render them better transporters of certain anticancer drugs including anthracyclines as well as hydrophilic and lipophilic antifolates. To date, however, it still remains to be determined whether the mutant Gly482 BCRP is kinetically a more efficient transporter when comparing the Km and Vmax constants particularly for the monoglutamate forms of MTX and other hydrophilic antifolates as well as lipid-soluble antifolates.

One noteworthy point is that whereas overexpression of the mutant Gly482 BCRP resulted in extremely high levels of antifolate resistance, this was associated with only a modest 2-fold decrease in the monoglutamate levels of cellular MTX ([Shafran et al., 2005]). Although this may seem a discrepancy, it could be easily reconciled when considering the following data. It has been previously shown that a significant fraction of intracellular MTX is tightly bound to its high affinity target enzyme DHFR (Kd = 5 pM). Hence, the limited amount of intracellular-free MTX ([Zhao et al., 1997]) is either available for efflux via BCRP and/or for binding to FPGS thereby resulting in polyglutamylation. Since the affinity of human FPGS for MTX (Km = 40–70 μM; [Chen et al., 1996; Sanghani and Moran, 2000; Liani et al., 2003]) is at least 10-fold higher than that of Arg 482 BCRP for this antifolate (Km = 0.7–1.3 mM; [Table 1]), the pool of free MTX must be even further minute when considering the DHFR mediated entrapment of this antifolate. Given this minimal pool of free MTX, it is not surprising at all that the decrease in the accumulation of MTX monoglutamates after 4 h of incubation with 1 μM MTX was only 2-fold in both BCRP-transfected HEK293 cells ([Shafran et al., 2005]) and in MRP1, MRP2 ([Hooijberg et al., 1999]) and MRP3 overexpressing 2008 cell transductants ([Kool et al., 1999]). These results suggest that the intracellular levels of long-chain polyglutamate derivatives of MTX are a much more reliable predictive parameter of MTX resistance induced by BCRP overexpression rather than the mere total cellular levels of MTX.
3. Folate efflux via MRPs and BCRP: impact on cellular folate pools and folate homeostasis

As mentioned above, following the original establishment of a linkage between MTX transport by cMOAT (MRP2) in hyperbilirubinemic rats hereditarily lacking MRP2 expression (Masuda et al., 1997), reduced folate cofactors including THF, 5-CH₃-THF, 5,10-CH₂-THF and 5-CHO-THF (leucovorin) have subsequently been found to be transport substrates for this efflux transporter (Kusuhara et al., 1998). Further detailed kinetic studies with isolated inside-out membrane vesicles from transfected cells overexpressing MRP3 and MRP5 have shown that these MRPs transport folic acid and leucovorin in an ATP-dependent manner with Km values in the millimolar range (Km = 0.6–2 mM; Table 1) (Zeng et al., 2001). Notably, inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from MRP4 overexpressing cells displayed an apparently higher transport affinity for folic acid (Km = 0.17 mM) and leucovorin (Km = 0.64 mM) than MRP3 and MRP5 (Chen et al., 2002). This is consistent with the relatively high affinity of this efflux transporter for MTX (Km = 0.22 mM) (Chen et al., 2002). Furthermore, consistent with the transport of MTX by MRP1 through MRP5, folic acid transport by MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5 also occurred with a Vmax of 0.7–1.7 nmol/mg protein/min. Hence, as with MTX transport, folic acid and leucovorin transport via MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5 is a low-affinity, high-capacity ATP-dependent translocation. As to folate transport via BCRP, the only available report was that using inside-out vesicles from HEK293/ABCG2 transfected cells, an ATP-dependent transport of radiolabeled folic acid could be detected at an approximate rate of 87 pmol/mg protein/min (Chen et al., 2003b). In contrast, inside-out vesicles isolated from HEK293/Gly482 ABCG2 cells overexpressing the mutant Gly482 BCRP failed to transport folic acid.

While there is ample evidence that MTX transport occurs via MRP1 through MRP5, no parallel detailed kinetic studies were reported for the transport of folate cofactors by MRP1, MRP2 and BCRP. However, several lines of evidence lend support to the role of various MRPs and BCRP in the modulation of the intracellular levels of folates as well as on folate homeostasis:

(a) Striking adaptive responses occurred in CCRF-CEM-7A leukemia T-cells (Assaraf et al., 2003) established to grow in sub-nanomolar concentrations of leucovorin after gradual deprivation of this THF cofactor from the growth medium (Jansen et al., 1990); MRP1 expression was nearly completely lost (Assaraf et al., 2003) along with a dramatic overexpression of the RFC (Jansen et al., 1990). Hence, since like their parental cells, CCRF-CEM-7A cells lack MRP2, MRP3 and BCRP, express low levels of MRP4 and MRP5 and in addition essentially lack the expression of MRP1, the folate efflux capability has been lost in these cells. Indeed, CCRF-CEM-7A cells showed a 5-fold fall in the folic acid efflux rate constant relative to parental CCRF-CEM cells.

Furthermore, blocking folate efflux activity in parental CCRF-CEM cells by probenecid recapitulated this 5-fold decrease in folic acid efflux. Consequently, CCRF-CEM-7A cells acquired a highly augmented reduced folate influx via the overexpressed RFC which could not be counteracted by MRP1 as the latter was lost in these cells. This resulted in a highly expanded cellular folate pool; the net cellular pools of folic acid and leucovorin after 30 min accumulation with these radiolabeled folates were respectively 15- and 26-fold higher than in parental cells (Assaraf et al., 2003). This was clearly reflected in the dramatic decreases in both folic acid and leucovorin growth requirements.

(b) Shifting the growth medium of CCRF-CEM-7A cells from 0.25 nM (folate-deplete) to 5 nM leucovorin (folate-replete) resulted in a complete restoration of parental MRP1 levels (Assaraf et al., 2003). Consistently, loss of MRP1 expression was also noted in RFC-defective cell lines (CEM/MTX-LF and CEM/GW-70LF) grown under low folic acid concentrations (2–5 nM folic acid); remarkably, MRP1 expression was fully restored upon growth of these cell lines under folate replete conditions (2.3 μM folic acid) (Assaraf et al., 2003). These results support the conclusion that subtle changes in extracellular folate concentrations readily modulate MRP1 levels.

(c) Consistent with these results was the finding that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) PyrR¹⁰⁰ cells (Assaraf and Slotky, 1993) exposed to a gradual deprivation of folates via step-wise selection to the lipophilic antifolate pyrimethamine displayed a complete loss of MRP1 and a marked decrease in MRP5 (Stark et al., 2003). These cells also showed a 4-fold increase in the activity of a low pH folate transporter activity (Assaraf et al., 1998) (Fig. 4). In the absence of MRP1 and MRP5 along with the lack of a significant expression of other MRPs, these cells exhibited a 5-fold decrease in the efflux of both folic acid and cholic acid (Assaraf and Goldman, 1997; Stark et al., 2003). Therefore, PyrR¹⁰⁰ cells, which lost folic acid efflux but acquired a significant increase in folate influx activity, achieved a free intracellular pool of folic acid that was 17-fold higher than that of parental CHO AA8 cells (Assaraf and Goldman, 1997). Consequently, this resulted in a 14-fold decreased folic acid and leucovorin growth requirements; strikingly, PyrR¹⁰⁰ cells could grow in a medium containing as low as 100 pM leucovorin as the sole folate source. These experiments demonstrate the functional role that down-regulation of MRP1 may have on cellular folate homeostasis and adaptation to conditions of folate deficiency.

(d) As with cells overexpressing MRP1, exposure of mitoxantrone-resistant human breast cancer MCF-7/MR cells with 55-fold BCRP overexpression to long-term (3.5 months) gradual deprivation of folic acid resulted in a nearly complete loss of BCRP expression along with 5-fold down-regulation of MRP1 levels (Ifergan et al., 2004). Additionally, another important adaptive

response to long-term folate deprivation aimed at preserving cellular folates included a significant increase in FPGS activity. The loss of BCRP and MRP1 expression along with the increased FPGS activity resulted in an increased cellular folate accumulation as well as 28-fold increased sensitivity to MTX.

(e) Short-term (2 weeks) exposure of MCF-7/MR cells to folate-free medium followed by an adaptation (1 week) in low folic acid (1 nM)-containing medium resulted in consistent adaptive responses aimed at preserving cellular folate pools (Ifergan et al., 2005). First, while BCRP was predominantly located at the plasma membrane in parental MCF-7 cells, ~90% of BCRP was confined to the cytoplasmic compartment (endoplasmic reticulum) in folate-deprived cells. Second, these cells also displayed a 3-fold decrease in BCRP and MRP1 levels thereby resulting in a ~5-fold increase in folic acid accumulation.

(f) Introduction of human cDNAs encoding for MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 into human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells grown in folate replete medium (i.e. containing 2.3 μM folic acid) resulted in a 32–38% decrease in the intracellular folate pools (Hooijberg et al., 2003). Consequently, when MRP1 or MRP3 overexpressing cells were challenged under folate-deplete conditions with a short exposure (4 h) to folic acid or leucovorin, a markedly increased folate growth requirement was observed. Moreover, folic acid growth stimulation was dramatically decreased when during the 4 h exposure, metabolism into polyglutamatable (i.e. retainable) DHF was blocked by the DHFR inhibitor trimetrexate. In order to retain growth under such conditions, cells overexpressing MRP1 required 42-fold more folic acid than their parental 2008 cells. These results lend support to the notion that overexpression of MRP1 and MRP3 can influence cellular folate homeostasis particularly when cellular retention by folate polyglutamylation is attenuated.

(g) Loss of MRP1 activity as determined by the decrease in daunorubicin efflux was noted upon pulse exposure of MRP1-overexpressing 2008/MRP1 cells to folate-free medium (Hooijberg et al., 2004); this however, was not associated with decreased MRP1 protein levels. Consistently, replenishment of 48 h folate-deprived cells with 2.5 μM leucovorin for as short as 6 h resulted in a rapid resumption of MRP1-dependent daunorubicin efflux activity. This restoration of MRP1 efflux activity occurred in the absence of alterations in MRP1 protein levels. Hence, it was suggested that abrupt increases in the cellular pool of reduced folates as the one occurring after the rapid uptake of leucovorin via the RFC, could possibly lead to post-translational modifications of MRP1 that in turn modulate its efflux activity without affecting MRP1 protein levels (Hooijberg et al., 2004). Indeed, earlier studies described a possible role for the cyclic phosphorylation (and dephosphorylation) of MRP1 in the maintenance

of its anthracycline efflux activity (Ma et al., 1995). These authors consistently showed that treatment of MRP1-overexpressing HL60/ADR cells with the protein serine kinase inhibitors H-7 and staurosporine resulted in the complete blockade of MRP1 serine phosphorylation. In turn, loss of MRP1 phosphorylation brought about a major decrease in MRP1 drug efflux activity and a marked increase in drug accumulation. These results were recently supported by other studies demonstrating that blocking phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) activity with LY294002 in colon carcinoma cells with MRP1 overexpression resulted in a marked increase in doxorubicin accumulation and cytotoxicity (Abdul-Ghani et al., 2006). This drug reversal effect could be recapitulated by the MRP1 efflux inhibitor MK571. Clearly however, whether cellular folate status plays a role in MRP1 phosphorylation is presently unclear. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the signaling pathway(s) that possibly link(s) cellular folate status to putative post-translational modifications of MRP1 resulting in modulation of its efflux activity.

4. Expansion of cellular reduced folate pool and its impact on antifolate sensitivity

Studies from several laboratories have clearly demonstrated that alterations in the intracellular THF cofactor pool modulate the cytotoxic activity of certain antifolates (Nimec and Galiven, 1983; Johnson et al., 1988; Assaraf and Goldman, 1997; Jansen et al., 1998, 1999; van der Wilt et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2001). Specifically, decreased intracellular reduced folate pools after growth of tumor cell lines in low folic acid concentrations resulted in a markedly increased antifolate sensitivity, when compared to cells grown under higher folic acid concentrations (Jansen et al., 1998). Inversely, expansion of the intracellular folate pool resulted in a markedly decreased sensitivity to various antifolates; this increased drug resistance was prominent for antifolates that rely on polyglutamylation for their pharmacological activity (Assaraf and Goldman, 1997; Tse and Moran, 1998; Jansen et al., 1999). The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are as follows: First, upon suppression of DHFR activity by antifolates like MTX and PT523, THF cofactors are oxidized to DHF. As such, expansion in the intracellular THF pool will necessarily result in a marked accumulation of DHF, given that DHFR is continuously inhibited. DHF, the natural high affinity substrate of DHFR, will then efficiently compete with the inhibitory antifolate at the level of this enzyme. The consequently decreased inhibition of DHFR will bring about a suppression of the cytotoxic activity of the antifolate thereby resulting in antifolate resistance. Clearly, the more potent DHFR inhibition by the specific antifolate, the lesser the impact of the expansion of intracellular folate pool on antifolate resistance. Second, the augmented intracellular THF cofactor pool strongly decreases the extent of
formation of antifolate polyglutamates. This occurs due to a competition of both DHF and THF cofactors with the polyglutamatable antifolate at the level of FPGS. Hence, expansion of intracellular folate pools, either due to the loss of expression and function of folate efflux pumps (Assaraf and Goldman, 1997; Assaraf et al., 2003), or increased influx of folic acid due to mutations in the RFC which highly increase its affinity for folic acid (Tse and Moran, 1998; Jansen et al., 1998; Drori et al., 2000), results in resistance to antifolates, particularly to those that require polyglutamylation for their cytotoxic activity. Consistently, antifolates such as PT523, which most potently inhibit DHFR and cannot undergo polyglutamylation (due to the lack of a glutamate moiety), retained their cytotoxic activity even when the intracellular folate pool is markedly expanded. In contrast, increased cellular THF cofactor pools markedly decreased trimetrexate activity (Zhao et al., 2001; Assaraf and Slotky, 1993); inasmuch as trimetrexate does not undergo polyglutamylation, this finding is in accord with the relatively poorer affinity of trimetrexate for DHFR when compared to that of the parent drug MTX (Jackson et al., 1984) or other potent DHFR inhibitors like PT523. ZD9331, a potent TS inhibitor and a nonpolyglutamatable inhibitor also retained its original cytotoxic activity in cells with an expanded folate pool; this is consistent with the lack of competition between this antifolate and 5,10-CH₂-THF at the level of the target enzyme TS (Jackman et al., 1997).

In a dedicated study, the impact of the intracellular folate pool size on the cytotoxic activity of multiple antifolates was systematically explored in murine L1210 leukemia cells grown in different concentrations of leucovorin as the sole folate source (Zhao et al., 2001). The cellular folate pool increased in proportion to the rise in the extracellular concentration of leucovorin. As the THF cofactor pool size increased, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀) for the polyglutamatable antifolates lometrexol, pemetrexed and raltitrexed markedly increased. This appeared to result from a significant suppression of the formation of antifolate polyglutamates. The lower the affinity of the antifolate monoglutamate for the target enzyme and FPGS, the higher the adverse effect of the expanded folate pool on the pharmacological activity of the antifolate.

## 5. Novel developments and future perspectives

Antifolates including MTX have long been known for their potent anticancer activity via antagonism of folate metabolism, thereby resulting in inhibition of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis (Stokstad, 1990; Walling, 2006). Surprisingly however, it was recently demonstrated that MTX targets Ras signaling via inhibition of a specific methyltransferase known as isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) (Winter-Vann et al., 2003). MTX is known to increase homocysteine (Refsum et al., 1989), a compound associated with an elevated risk of heart disease, Alzheimer disease (Molloy and Scott, 2001) and neural tube defects (Rosenquist et al., 1996). A potential mechanism for the detrimental effects of homocysteine is cellular hypomethylation due to an increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine (Yi et al., 2000), an inhibitor of methyltransferases including ICMT. Among the substrates of the latter enzyme is the monomeric G protein Ras, a key component of various signaling pathways that regulates cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Since carboxyl methylation of Ras is crucial for proper plasma membrane targeting and function (Bergo et al., 2000), disruption of this post-translational modification will necessarily result in the loss of Ras activity and Ras-dependent signaling. Indeed, MTX treatment of DKOB8 human colon cancer cells resulted in a 90% loss of Ras methylation (Winter-Vann et al., 2003). This severe hypomethylation was accompanied by a mislocalization of Ras to the cytosol as well as a marked decrease in the activation of p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and AKT. Consistently, cells lacking ICMT were highly resistant to MTX. Moreover, stable expression of myristoylated H-Ras, which does not require carboxyl methylation for membrane targeting and function, conferred MTX resistance. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that inhibition of ICMT is a critical component of the cytotoxic effect exerted by MTX, thereby expanding our understanding of the mechanisms of action of antifolates. These studies have important implications for the future development of novel rationally based chemotherapeutic combinations that contain folate antimetabolites. For example, targeting ICMT by potent small molecule inhibitors along with co-treatment with MTX (or other antifolates) may prove a highly synergistic chemotherapeutic combination. Furthermore, targeting key kinases involved in Ras-dependent signal transduction (Blum and Kloog, 2005) resulting in cell growth and cellular proliferation such as MAPK and AKT along with the co-administration of MTX may also prove a synergistic antitumor combination. This latter strategy gains support from several recent *in vivo* studies. First, co-treatment of human lung and prostate cancer xenografts in mice with a combination of the MTX homologue, edatrexate, along with the potent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor ZD1839 (Iressa), resulted in a complete regression of these tumors (Sirotinak et al., 2000). Hence, with synergistic drug combinations such as Iressa and edatrexate, EGFR expression levels need not to be high in order to achieve a potent cytotoxic effect. Second, the effect of Iressa monotherapy was highly cytostatic in nude mice bearing established human colon cancer xenografts expressing EGFR along with its autocrine growth factor, transforming growth factor α (TGFα); at the end of this single agent treatment, the tumors resumed the growth rate of untreated controls (Ciardiello et al., 2000). In contrast, the combined treatment of these tumor-bearing mice with both Iressa and the potent TS inhibitor raltitrexed resulted in a tumor growth arrest with a markedly prolonged survival in all mice. Thus, recent evidence strongly suggeststhat combination anticancer therapy with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors, which are usually cytostatic, along with conventional chemotherapeutic agents including antifolates, which are established cytotoxic drugs, provides an improved treatment strategy. Third, in a recent study, the successful design, synthesis and evaluation of a potent inhibitor of both RTKs as well as DHFR has been recently achieved in a single molecule with a novel 2,4-diamino-5-substituted furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine structure (Gangjee et al., 2005). This remarkable inhibitor had a key added value in that it potently blocked angiogenesis on top of its direct antitumor activity. Clearly, further detailed clinical studies in cancer patients are warranted in order to determine the antitumor efficacy of these rationally designed novel drug combinations.
