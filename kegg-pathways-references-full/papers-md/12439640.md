# The β-Adrenergic Receptors

Gerd Wallukat¹

## Background:
The β-adrenergic receptors of the myocardium play an important role in the regulation of heart function. The β-adrenergic receptors belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors. Three subtypes have been distinguished (β₁-, β₂-, and β₃-adrenoceptors). The receptors consist of seven membrane-spanning domains, three intra-and three extracellular loops, one extracellular N-terminal domain, and one intracellular C-terminal tail.

## Pathophysiology:
Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors by catecholamines is realized via the β-adrenoceptor-adenylylcase-protein kinase A cascade. The second messenger is the cyclic AMP (cAMP). Stimulation of the cascade caused an accumulation of the second messenger cAMP and activated via the cAMP the cAMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) The PKA phosphorylated, beside other cell proteins, the β-adrenergic receptors. A phosphorylation of the β-adrenergic receptors caused – with exception of the β₃-adrenoceptor – an uncoupling and desensitisation of the receptors. Phosphorylation via the G-protein receptor kinase (GRK or βARK) also caused uncoupling and reduced the β-adrenergic responsiveness. The uncoupling of the receptor is the prerequisite for receptor internalisation. In the process of internalisation the receptor shifted from the sarcolemma membrane into cytosolic compartments. Chronic β-adrenergic stimulation caused a down-regulation of the receptors. During this process of desensitisation the expression of the receptor on mRNA and protein level is reduced.

### Changing of the Receptors in the Failing Heart:
In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy the β-adrenergic responsiveness of the myocard is diminished. It was shown that in these patients the expression of the β₁-adrenergic receptor is reduced on the mRNA and protein level. In these patients the expression of the inhibitory G-protein Gᵢ is increased. Furthermore, the expression of the G-protein receptor kinase is elevated. This kinase induces the uncoupling of the β-adrenergic receptors. These alterations of the β-adrenoceptor signal cascade may be induced by an elevated catecholamine release or by agonist-like autoantibodies directed against the β₁-adrenergic receptor found in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Both, permanent stimulation with catecholamines and chronic treatment with agonistic anti-β₁-adrenoceptor autoantibodies cause a reduction of the expression of the β₁-adrenoceptor on mRNA and protein level in “in vitro” experiments. Moreover, an over-expression of the β₁-adrenoceptor, the stimulatory Gₛ protein, and the protein kinase A induce detrimental alterations of the cardiac function and morphology in transgenic animals. These animals developed heart failure accompanied by an increased mortality rate.

## Die β-adrenergen Rezeptoren

### Charakterisierung:
Die β-adrenergen Rezeptoren des Herzens spielen in der Regulation der Herzfunktion eine entscheidende Rolle. Diese Rezeptoren gehören zur Familie der G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren und lassen sich in drei Subtypen (β₁-, β₂- und β₃-Adrenozepor) unterteilen. Die Rezeptoren bestehen aus sieben Domänen, welche die Zellmembran durchspannen, aus jeweils drei intra- und extrazellulären Schleifen, einem extrazellulären N-Terminus und einem intrazellulären C-Terminus.

### Pathophysiologie:
Bei einer Stimulierung dieser Rezeptoren durch Katecholamine wird das Signal über die β-Adrenozep-

adrenergen Ansprechbarkeit. Die Entkopplung des Rezeptors durch Phosphorylierung ist die Voraussetzung für die Rezeptorinternalisierung. In diesem Prozess wird der Rezeptor von der sarkolemmalen Membran in innere Kompartiments der Myozyten transloziert und so einer möglichen Stimulation entzogen. Bei einer chronischen adrenergen Stimulation werden die β-adrenergen Rezeptoren „downreguliert“. Bei dieser Art der Desensibilisierung ist die Expression der Rezeptoren auf mRNA- und Proteinebene reduziert.

Veränderungen bei dilatativer Kardiomyopathie: Bei Patienten mit dilatativer Kardiomyopathie (DCM) wurde eine verminderte β-adrenerge Ansprechbarkeit des Herzens beobachtet. In diesen Patienten konnte eine β1-Adrenozeptor-spezifische Reduktion der mRNA und des Rezeptorproteins nachgewiesen werden. Die Expression und die Aktivität des inhibitorischen G-Proteins Gi ist in diesen Patienten erhöht.

### Introduction

G-protein-coupled receptors are involved in the response to different neuro- and autocrine transmitters. They mediate the signal of the transmitter into the cell. In the regulation of the cardiovascular function the adrenergic receptors play an important role. Ahlquist [1] was the first to differentiate the adrenergic receptors pharmacologically into α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Several years later the adrenoceptors were distinguished using adrenergic agonists and antagonists into α1-, α2-, β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor subtypes [2, 3]. At present three different β-adrenoceptor subtypes have been identified using pharmacological methods and through cloning of the receptors. These are the β1-, β2-, and β3-adrenergic receptors [4]. During the past years it has been shown pharmacologically that a fourth β-adrenoceptor may exist [5].

In the human heart the β1-adrenoceptor is the predominate receptor [6]. The β1/β2 ratio is 70–80%: 30–20% in the ventricle. In the human atrium the ratio is 60–70%: 40–30% [6]. Both the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors are Gs-protein-coupled and stimulation of the receptors causes an elevation of the second messenger cyclic AMP. The β1- and β2-adrenoceptor are involved in positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the myocardium induced by endogenous catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline [7, 8]. However, noradrenaline acts on β-adrenoceptors more via the β1-than via the β2-adrenoceptor subtype.

### Characterization of the β-Adrenergic Receptors

The β-adrenoceptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. They are characterized by seven transmembrane spanning domains forming a pocket in which the agonists and competitive antagonists find their binding sites. In mutagenic analysis it was shown that the Asp113 in the third transmembrane region, the Ser165 in the fourth transmembrane region and the Ser204 and Ser207 in the fifth transmembrane domain interact with the β-adrenergic agonists [9–11]. Moreover, the G-protein-coupled receptors contain three extracellular and intracellular loops. The first and second extracellular loop are coupled via a disulfide bridge and play an important role in the development of receptor conformation [12–14]. The receptor molecule also includes an extracellular N-terminal domain and a cytosolic C-terminal tail. The latter contains the phosphorylation sites of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). The phosphorylation site of PKA is localized on the third intracellular loop of the receptor [15]. Increased phosphorylation of the β-adrenergic receptors is believed to play an important role in the agonist-promoted uncoupling which leads to rapid desensitization and later to the downregulation of the receptor. Therefore the phosphorylation of the receptor is an effective mechanism to modulate the responsiveness of the β-adrenoceptor-mediated signal transduction cascade.

### Agonist-Induced Desensitization

The process of receptor desensitization involves several mechanisms that may be divided into acute responses (uncoupling) and chronic responses (internalization and downregulation). This phenomenon has been almost exclusively investigated for the β2-adrenoceptor. However, the mechanisms can probably be extrapolated to other G-protein-coupled receptors regulated by phosphorylation [16]. Uncoupling of the β-adrenoceptor from the Gsα-protein prevents signaling to adenylyl cyclase. After binding of the agonist the receptor is phosphorylated on its cytosolic domains by protein kinases (Figure 1). This agonist-induced desensitization is initiated within seconds to minutes. Two types of kinases have been reported to alter receptor function. Both the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (β-ARK1 or GRK2) and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A have been implicated in the process of phosphorylation. The specific desensitization of the β-adrenergic receptors (homologous desensitization) is mediated via the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (β-ARK1 or GRK2) [17, 18]. The β-ARK1, a serine/threonine kinase, is a member of the family of G-protein-coupled protein kinases (GRKs) and is expressed in the mammalian heart [19]. β-ARK1 phosphorylates agonist-occupied receptors in the C-terminal tail and allow binding of the cytosolic protein α-arrestin to the receptor. The β-arrestin binding prevents the coupling of the G-protein Gsα to the adenylyl cyclase and blocks the signal transduction [18]. Beside phosphorylation of the β-adrenergic receptors by GRKs the receptors are also phosphorylated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A. This kinase phosphorylates other proteins also and not exclusively the β-adrenoceptors. Therefore the PKA-mediated desensitization is described as heterologous desensitization [18].

#### Receptor Sequestration and Internalization

After the phosphorylation the uncoupled receptors are removed from the sarcolemma membrane into internal compartments. During this process the β-adrenoceptor translocates from the plasma membrane to a vesicle fraction. From this vesicle fraction the receptor can be recycled to the plasma membrane when it is dephosphorylated [20]. The shift of the receptor is also termed sequestration or internalization and it has been shown that this mechanism occurs even in the absence of phosphorylation [21]. However, a variety of recent studies suggest that GRK2 is involved in β-adrenoceptor se-

**Figure 1. Scheme of the signal transduction induced by β-adrenergic agonists. β-adrenergic stimulation by catecholamines activates the adenylyl cyclase via the Gs-protein resulting in an elevated generation of the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cAMP activates the protein kinase A (PKA) which is able to phosphorylate different cell proteins. The phosphorylation of the L-type Ca²⁺ channel of the sarcolemma increases the Ca²⁺ influx and causes a Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The phospholamban (PLB) regulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ pump SERCA 2a. Un-phosphorylated PLB inhibits the SERCA activity. After the phosphorylation of PLB by the PKA this inhibition is abolished and the SERCA-mediated Ca²⁺ transport from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is elevated. The phosphorylation of the β-adrenergic receptor by the PKA induces the uncoupling and desensitization of the receptor. Such uncoupling of the receptor is also mediated via phosphorylation with the G-protein receptor kinase (GRK or β-ARK). This kinase is only activated when the receptor is occupied by agonists. Proteins of the signal cascade that are detrimental when overexpressed in transgenic animal models are shaded.**

Das cAMP aktiviert die Proteinkinase A (PKA), die neben anderen Proteinen auch den L-Typ-Ca²⁺-Kanal phosphoryliert. Die Phosphorylierung des L-Typ-Ca²⁺-Kanals erhöht den Ca²⁺-Einstrom in die Zelle und verursacht eine Ca²⁺-vermittelte Ca²⁺-Freisetzung aus dem sarkoplastischen Retikulum.

Nach der Phosphorylierung des PLB durch die PKA wird diese Hemmung aufgehoben, und der SERCA-vermittelte Ca²⁺-Transport vom Zytosol in das sarkoplastische Retikulum ist erhöht. Eine PKA-vermittelte Phosphorylierung des β-adrenergen Rezeptors führt zu einer Entkopplung und Desensitisierung des Rezeptors. Diese Desensitisierung wird auch über die G-Protein-Rezeptorkinase (GRK bzw. β-ARK) realisiert. Diese Kinase wird aktiviert, wenn der Rezeptor durch Agonisten stimuliert wurde.

questration. It was shown by Ruiz-Gomes & Mayor [22] that overexpression of GRK2 increases the rate and extent of β2-receptor internalization.

Prolonged exposure of the β-adrenoceptor to adrenergic agonists leads to the downregulation of the receptor. Downregulation is defined as a decline in the total number of receptors caused by chronic application of receptor agonists [23]. Downregulation develops more slowly than uncoupling, taking hours to days.

A final step which is directly related to downregulation of β-adrenoceptors is the cAMP-dependent destabilization of the receptor mRNA decreasing synthesis and degradation of the receptor molecule [24]. For instance, the treatment of 3T3-Li fibroblasts with agonists induces downregulation of β2-adrenoceptor mRNA [25], possibly by increasing the level of a RNA-binding protein that reduces the stability of β2-adrenoceptor mRNA [26]. Such downregulation was also observed by Podlowski et al [27] who treated cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes for 72 hours with the β1/β2-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline or with agonistic autoantibodies directed against the β1-adrenoceptor. In cardiomyocytes pretreated with isoprenaline the expression of both the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor was reduced on the mRNA and protein levels. However, the β1-adrenoceptor antibodies diminished subtype specifically only the expression of the β1-adrenergic receptor.

Both processes, internalization and downregulation, contribute to a reduction in the total number of β-adrenoceptors in the plasma membrane.

### β-Adrenergic Receptors in Cardiomyocytes Differentiated from Embryonic Stem Cells

Embryonic stem cells are continuously growing cells of embryonic origin. They were first isolated from mouse blastocysts. These cells proliferate in an undifferentiated state in culture and they are able to differentiate into every tissue type. Pluripotent embryonic stem cells are also able to differentiate into spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes.

Cardiomyocytes are stimulated by different transmitters and hormones via G-protein-coupled receptors. Similar data were obtained using cardiomyocytes differentiated from embryonic stem cells. Cardiomyocytes derived from mouse stem cells respond to stimulation with the β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline with an increase in beating rate. This positive chronotropic effect was abolished by β-adrenergic antagonists. Pharmacological measurements imply that these cells express α1-, β1-

and β2-adrenergic and the muscarinic M2 receptor. Moreover, the cells also express the enzyme adenyl cyclase and phosphodiesterases involved in the generation and degradation of the second messenger cAMP, respectively [28, 29]. Recently, it was demonstrated that cardiomyocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells also express adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. After the application of isoprenaline these cells respond with an increase in beating rate [30]. From this observation it can be assumed that cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem cells, like cardiomyocytes in vivo, express β1-and β2-adrenergic receptors.

#### β-Adrenoceptor in the Failing Heart

Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of left ventricular dysfunction accompanied by impairment of targets of the β1-adrenoceptor signal cascade. This disturbed β-adrenoceptor function may be based on an elevated sympathetic tone observed in patients with heart failure. In these patients the tissue concentration of norepinephrine is diminished and the plasma concentration elevated, providing evidence of sympathetic stimulation [31, 32]. Such an increase in plasma catecholamines may result in downregulation of the β-adrenoceptors and in the depression of the β-adrenoceptor-mediated signal transduction axis [6, 33]. Moreover, prolonged adrenergic stimulation may induce metabolic and electrophysiological disturbances in the myocardium, resulting in tachyarrhythmia and sudden death [34]. Moreover, it seems that such chronic adrenergic stimulation causes alterations of the expression and activity of the components of the β-adrenoceptor-mediated signal transduction cascade. In dilated cardiomyopathy, there is a substantial decrease in β1-adrenoceptor expression on the mRNA and protein levels [35, 36] accompanied by reduced β-adrenergic responsiveness of the cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the inhibitory G-protein Gi is upregulated in activity and amount (although not in all studies). In contrast, the functional activity of the stimulatory G-protein Gs is unchanged [37, 38]. This is also true for the adenyl cyclase activity. The β-ARK (GRK2) which specifically phosphorylates G-protein-coupled receptors and which decreases the β-adrenergic responsiveness is also upregulated [35]. The activity of the PKA which is involved in receptor desensitization is not altered. In summary, chronic activation of the cardiac β1-adrenoceptor signal cascade contributes to the progression of cardiac dysfunction and the development of heart failure in animal models and in humans.

### Autoantibodies against the β1-Adrenoceptor in Heart Failure

Many diseases beside the classical autoimmune diseases are accompanied by the induction of antibodies against extra- and intracellular epitopes of patient tissue. For instance, in the sera of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy antibodies were found that recognize sarcolemmal, myofibrillar, and mitochondrial structures on the cardiac myocytes [39]. Some of these antibodies also recognize epitopes of G-protein-coupled receptors. Fu et al [40] have shown that patients with dilated cardiomyopathy develop antibodies against the muscarinic M2 acetylcholine receptor. Autoantibodies against the β1-adrenergic receptor were described in this disease by several groups [41–44]. These anti-β1-adrenoceptor antibodies exert functional effects in cultured spontaneously beating rat cardiomyocytes. In this “bioassay” anti-β1-adrenoceptor antibodies caused positive chronotropic effects which were abolished by the β1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist bisoprolol. In contrast to classical β-adrenergic agonists recognizing their binding sites in a pocket formed by the seven membrane spanning domains, the antibodies find their epitopes on the first or second extracellular loop of the receptor [14]. Peptides corresponding to the first or second extracellular loop are able to neutralize β1-adrenoceptor antibody effects and were also used for affinity purification. The antibodies are immunoglobulins of the IgG type. Although the antibodies bind to epitopes on the extracellular domains and not to the agonist-binding site of the receptor they are able to activate the β-adrenoceptor-mediated signal transduction cascade. The antibodies activate the adenylyl cyclase via the β-adrenoceptor and increase the second messenger cAMP moderately [45, 46].

Moreover, the antibodies also activate the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A [45, 47]. The mechanism by which the β1-adrenoceptor antibody acts is thus probably by stabilizing the active conformation of the receptor, similar to what was found for monoclonal antibodies against the β2-adrenoceptor and the muscarinic M2 receptor [48–50].

As mentioned above, chronic stimulation with adrenergic agonists causes desensitization and downregulation of β-adrenoceptors and of the β-adrenoceptor-mediated signal transduction cascade. By comparison, the agonistic effect of the β1-adrenoceptor antibodies was characterized by persistence at full strength, contrasting sharply with the deteriorating chronotropic response of isoprenaline. When cultured rat cardiomyocytes were treated with β1-adrenoceptor antibodies, a long-lasting positive chronotropic effect was observed [14]. This effect was not influenced by a washing procedure. However, the long-lasting effect (> 6 hours) was completely abolished when the stimulated cardiomyocytes were treated with β-adrenergic antagonists. A similar effect was observed when β1-adrenoceptor antibody-stimulated cells were treated with the agonist isoprenaline. Under these conditions isoprenaline did not develop its full chronotropic response and in the presence of the antibody isoprenaline was unable to desensitize the β1-adrenoceptor-mediated response [43]. These findings demonstrate that isoprenaline-mediated desensitization did not occur in the joint presence of autoantibodies and isoprenaline.

It is widely accepted that a chronic adrenergic overdrive, existing in many patients with heart failure, could play a harmful role in this disease [51]. Activation of the myocardium by elevated levels of circulating catecholamines in combination with autoantibodies against the β1-adrenoceptor can be expected to lead to a situation in which, independent of the circadian rhythm, a permanently exaggerated adrenergic overdrive could be the consequence. Such a permanent stimulation could modulate the Ca²⁺ homeostasis of cardiomyocytes resulting in metabolic and electrophysiological disturbances which are responsible for tachyarrhythmia and sudden death.

However, in neonatal cardiomyocytes treated longer-term (72 hours) the antibodies were able to decrease subtype-specifically the expression of β1-adrenoceptor on the mRNA and protein levels [27]. This downregulation of the receptor was accompanied by a diminished response of the cardiomyocytes to stimulation with isoprenaline. The downregulation of the receptor was prevented when the antibody pretreatment was done in the presence of β-adrenergic antagonists.

In C6-glioma cells, expressing both the β1- and β2-adrenoceptor, long-term treatment (72 hours) with isoprenaline or the β1-adrenoceptor antibody leads to a significant reduction of the isoprenaline-induced accumulation of the second messenger cyclic AMP (unpublished data). These effects were β-adrenoceptor-mediated because the cyclic AMP reduction was abolished by the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol.

In addition to their chronotropic effects in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes the β1-adrenoceptor antibodies prolong the potential action duration and activate

Wallukat G. The β-Adrenergic Receptors

the L-type Ca²⁺ channel of single adult rat cardiomyocytes [52]. These effects are prevented by β-adrenergic antagonists. In such rat cardiomyocytes the antibodies prolong also the Ca²⁺ transient (unpublished data). A reduced transfer of Ca²⁺ into sarcoplasmic reticulum resulting in a prolonged Ca²⁺ transient was also observed in myocytes prepared from mice hearts overexpressing the β1-adrenoceptor and in cardiomyocytes from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [53, 54].

The observation by Christ et al [52] may demonstrate that the agonist-like anti-β1-adrenoceptor antibodies modulate the Ca²⁺ homeostasis in such a way as to cause Ca²⁺ overload and heart failure by chronic treatment. Therefore it is feasible that the anti-β1-adrenoceptor antibodies may play a role in the development and maintenance of arrhythmias and heart failure.

### Overexpression of Components of the β-Adrenoceptors Signal Transduction Axis Causes Heart Failure

Chronic heart failure is characterized by abnormalities in β1-adrenoceptor signal transduction. It was demonstrated that heart failure is also inducible in animal models by overexpression of components of the β-adrenoceptors signal transduction cascade. Transgenic mice overexpressing the β1-adrenoceptor develop, with aging, heart failure similar to that observed in dilated cardiomyopathy in humans [55]. The young transgenic animals initially exhibit increased cardiac contractility. This cardiac overstimulation may induce pronounced hypertrophy of the myocytes accompanied by cardiac fibrosis. In aging the animals developed a failing heart with functional and histological deficits similar to those observed in human dilated cardiomyopathy. In these transgenic animals the calculated ejection fraction was markedly reduced to 21%. These animals died at the age of 14 months. Furthermore, the transfer of Ca²⁺ from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum was significantly prolonged [53]. Such changes of Ca²⁺ transient have also been described for myocytes prepared from the human failing heart [54].

Similar alterations of heart function and size were observed in the hearts of transgenic mice overexpressing the stimulatory G-protein Gₛα[56]. In these hearts β-adrenergic receptor stimulation caused an elevated chronotropic and inotropic response. However, with aging, the animals develop heart disease comparable to dilated cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyocytes are hypertrophied, the ventricles are dilated and the left

ventricular function is diminished. Furthermore, the rate of apoptosis and the generation of fibrotic material is increased resulting in a reduction of survival [57]. The treatment of these transgenic animals with the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol prevents cardiac dilation and depressed left ventricular function. The β-blocker treatment also prevents hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes and the development of fibrosis. Moreover, under this treatment the survival rate of the transgenic mice is enhanced [58].

Recently, it was shown by Antos et al [59] that an overexpression of the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase A also resulted in a phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy [60].

From these observations it can be assumed that an adrenergic overdrive induced by elevated catecholamine release and agonistic β1-adrenoceptor antibodies or an activation of targets of the β-adrenoceptor signal cascade (β1-adrenoceptor, Gₛα, PKA) by overexpression may induce cardiac alterations like those found in heart failure in animal models (see Figure 1). Similar processes were observed in humans through increased catecholamines and possibly through agonistic β1-adrenoceptor antibodies.
