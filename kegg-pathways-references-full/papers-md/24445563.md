Herpesvirus-encoded GPCRs:  
neglected players in inflammatory  
and proliferative diseases?

Henry F. Vischer, Marco Siderius, Rob Leurs and Martine J. Smit

Abstract | Herpesviruses encode membrane-associated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)  
in their viral genomes that are structurally similar to chemokine receptors. These GPCRs  
hijack GPCR-mediated cellular signalling networks of the host for survival, replication and  
pathogenesis. In particular the herpesvirus-encoded chemokine receptors ORF74, BILF1  
and US28, which are present at inflammatory sites and tumour cells, provide important  
virus-specific targets for directed therapies. Given the high druggability of GPCRs in  
general, these viral GPCRs can be considered promising antiviral drug targets.

Latent infections  
A phase of the viral infection  
cycle in which viral material  
(such as the genome, proteins  
or RNA) is maintained in the  
infected host cell without  
stimulation of the production  
and dissemination of new viral  
particles.

Herpesviruses  
A family of double-stranded  
DNA viruses that consists of  
three subfamilies; α-, β- and  
γ-herpesviridae. Herpesviruses  
establish lifelong infections in  
their host and require host  
cells for their replication.

Virions  
Viral particles consisting of  
DNA or RNA surrounded by  
a protein shell that are the  
infective forms of a virus.

Herpesviruses are widespread pathogens that establish  
latent infections, which are generally asymptomatic, by using host cells for their own survival and  
propagation¹. However, infections caused by herpesviruses  
can also cause and/or accelerate chronic inflammatory  
diseases and tumorigenesis²⁻⁴ (TABLE 1). In particular  
primary infection with a herpesvirus or reactivation of  
a latent herpesvirus infection in immunocompromised  
individuals, such as patients with AIDS or recipients  
of organ transplants, can cause severe morbidity and  
mortality⁵,⁶.

Chemokine receptors, like GPCRs in general, are  
highly druggable targets. Indeed, both small-molecule  
inhibitors and biologics are on the market or in clinical  
trials. Marketed therapeutics include the CCR5  
antagonist maraviroc (Selzentry/Celsentri; Pfizer) for  
the treatment of HIV infection; the CCR4 antagonist  
plerixafor (Mozobil; Sanofi) for stem cell mobilization;  
and the CCR4-specific monoclonal antibody mogamulizumab (Poteligeo; Kyowa Hakko Kirin) for the  
treatment of adult T cell leukaemia¹⁰,¹¹. Numerous  
small-molecule compounds and biologics targeting  
chemokine receptors are in clinical trials for a wide  
range of indications; for example, inflammatory bowel  
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma  
and cancer¹⁰,¹¹.

Herpesviruses use multiple strategies to hijack  
infected host cells, establish latent infection and evade  
antiviral immune responses in order to ultimately allow  
the production and subsequent dissemination of infectious  
virions. One of these strategies is the presence of  
genes that encode important regulatory proteins, such  
as cytokines, chemokines and membrane-associated G  
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; BOX 1) in the viral  
genome. The genomes of human herpesvirus 4 (HHV4;  
also known as Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)), HHV5 (also  
known as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)), HHV6,  
HHV7 and HHV8 (also known as Kaposi’s sarcoma-  
associated herpesvirus (KSHV)) each encode at least  
one viral GPCR (vGPCR). The sequences of vGPCRs  
are most similar to chemokine receptors¹. In humans,  
chemokine receptors have a key role in the coordination  
of the immune system by directing leukocytes to  
lymphoid tissues and sites of inflammation⁷. In addition,  
chemokines and their receptors are involved in organogenesis and angiogenesis, as well as in the growth, survival  
and metastasis of tumours⁸,⁹.

Some of the vGPCRs encoded by herpesviruses have  
been identified to interact with human chemokines  
include ORF74 (encoded by KSHV); US28 (encoded  
by HCMV); U12 (encoded by HHV6 and HHV7); and  
U51 (encoded by HHV6 and HHV7). Orphan vGPCRs  
that have no endogenous ligands identified as yet include  
BILF1 (encoded by EBV), and UL33, US27 and UL78  
(encoded by HCMV) . The capacity of several vGPCRs  
to promiscuously interact with human chemokines suggests  
that human herpesviruses use this host immune  
guidance system for survival and dissemination. In contrast to human chemokine receptors, which are ligand  
activated and predominantly couple to Gaᵢ₀ proteins,  
several vGPCRs — namely ORF74, US28, UL33, U51  
and BILF1 — signal independently of ligand activation  
(that is, they are constitutively active) and can couple to  
several G proteins¹².

Activating mutations in several human GPCRs are linked to human pathologies, which suggest that the constitutive signalling of vGPCRs is of major importance<sup>13</sup>. Indeed, constitutive activity of ORF74 is causally related to the initiation and progression of Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions, and constitutive signalling of US28 is essential for its oncomodulatory efficacy. The expression of chemokines in many inflammatory conditions may enhance vGPCR signalling, exacerbating the neoplastic phenotypes. Thus vGPCRs seem to be promising targets in human inflammatory and proliferative diseases, which we will discuss in more detail in this Review. A particular focus will be on ORF74, BILF1 and US28, as these vGPCRs have been detected in samples taken from patients. The most compelling epidemiological and biological evidence of the oncogenic role of herpesviruses are for KSHV and EBV, and so we will first discuss the potential contribution of their respective vGPCRs in the pathologies associated with herpesviruses.

### The KSHV-encoded GPCR ORF74

KSHV is one of the few human herpesviruses that has been characterized as the aetiological agent in the onset and development of proliferative diseases, including primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease<sup>14,15</sup> (TABLE 1). The classic form of Kaposi’s sarcoma (which predominantly occurs in elderly men in the Mediterranean region) rarely results in severe pathology<sup>14</sup>, and instead KSHV-mediated pathology is generally associated with reduced immunocompetence. This could imply that a switch from the latent to the replicative phase in the viral lifecycle is instrumental for the development of the disease. Indeed, inhibition of the KSHV lytic cycle using antiviral drugs caused regression of Kaposi’s sarcoma in patients<sup>16</sup>. The pathogenesis of Kaposi’s sarcoma involves inflammatory and angiogenic factors, and is characterized by extravasated erythrocytes, oedema, infiltration of lymphomononuclear cells and proliferating spindle cells<sup>17</sup>.

Antagonist

Box 1 | G protein-coupled receptors

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of ~900 membrane-associated proteins that respond to many endogenous ligands (for example, ions, lipids, biogenic amines, peptides and glycoproteins) and exogenous ligands (for example, odorants, taste stimuli, photons and drugs)⁶⁶ (see the figure; a). Binding of a specific agonist to the extracellular site of the GPCR stabilizes the seven transmembrane domains and the intracellular domains into an active conformation, which allows the subsequent coupling and activation of the heterotrimeric G protein to the intracellular site¹⁸⁶ (b). There are four main classes of heterotrimeric G proteins — Gaₛ, Gaᵢ/₁₁, Gaᵢ/ₒ and Ga₁₂/₁₃ — that transmit signals from GPCRs to distinct intracellular effector enzymes (such as adenyl cyclase and phospholipase C), resulting in the activation of unique signalling pathways (c, h).

Some GPCRs are associated with at least some level of basal signalling in the absence of agonists. This constitutive GPCR signalling (d) can be important for normal physiological function, as revealed by the pathologies that can result from activating mutations within GPCRs or herpesvirus-encoded GPCRs¹³. Constitutive GPCR signalling is inhibited by inverse agonists, which stabilize the inactive conformation of the GPCR upon binding and so decrease signalling levels below that of basal signalling (h).

Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of activated GPCRs by one of the four ubiquitously expressed GPCR kinases (GRK2, GRK3, GRK5 and GRK6) promotes the recruitment of cytosolic β-arrestin (e). Bound β-arrestin inhibits G protein-mediated signalling by sterically hindering coupling of heterotrimeric G proteins and by recruiting proteins that are part of the endocytosis machinery to internalize the GPCR (f). In addition, β-arrestin can act as a scaffold for signalling mediators to initiate G protein-independent signalling¹⁸⁶. GPCRs can influence the function of other GPCRs through direct physical interactions (such as heteromerization) and/or downstream crosstalk¹⁸⁷ (c). Approximately ~40% of the currently prescribed therapeutics act on GPCRs, mostly as antagonists.

The KSHV vGPCR ORF74 is a homologue of the human chemokine receptor CXCR2, and is detectable in Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions¹⁸⁻²¹. ORF74 expression mediates the onset of the Kaposi’s sarcoma phenotype in diverse in vitro and in vivo model systems²²⁻²⁶. Although ORF74 is constitutively active, it is also activated by a number of human CXC chemokines (TABLE 2). Hence, both constitutive and chemokine-induced ORF74-mediated functions may be used by the virus to promote its survival and replication (FIG. 1a), while the host immune system also uses ORF74-mediated functions to keep viral survival and replication under control.

**Diseases related to ORF74 expression**

As ORF74 is an early lytic gene²⁷,²⁸, its involvement in proliferation in Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions seemed a contradictory finding. In addition, ORF74 is only expressed in a small subset of cells in Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions from patient specimens and animal models²⁴,²⁹. A mechanism in which paracrine factors controlled by ORF74-induced signalling could be instrumental in Kaposi’s sarcoma formation (FIG. 1c,d) has been established. Indeed, exposure to paracrine factors stimulated the transformation of cells

expressing KSHV latent oncogenes such as Cyclin and Flip³⁰. This was despite the narrow window of ORF74 expression that coincided with the KSHV-mediated shutdown of host cell gene expression³¹.

The expression and activity of ORF74 is tightly controlled during the normal KSHV replicative infection cycle by ORF50 (also known as RTA)³² (FIG. 1a,b). ORF74 signalling is involved in the regulation of viral gene-expression patterns, including that of ORF50, resulting in a positive feed-forward loop that stimulates the lytic phase of the KSHV replicative cycle³³ (FIG. 1b). This activity of ORF74 requires binding of CXCL1, which initiates ORF74-mediated signalling through a switch in G-protein coupling³⁴. The angiostatic human chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL12, which act as inverse agonists on ORF74 (REFS 35,36) may provide alternative ways to control the proliferative, pro-angiogenic signalling exerted by ORF74 in KSHV-infected tissue. Viral control of constitutive ORF74 activation is mediated by vCCL2 (REF. 37). Therefore, host cell and viral mechanisms are in place to control the proliferative potential of ORF74.

The development of Kaposi’s sarcoma may be the result of the host losing control over ORF74 activity.

Indeed, loss of immunocompetence, HIV infection resulting in untimely expression of ORF74 are triggers that initiate Kaposi’s sarcoma pathology<sup>38</sup>. The aggressiveness of the Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions in HIV-infected patients is attributed to the presence of HIV-encoded Tat protein, which was shown to mediate increased ORF74 expression<sup>39</sup> (FIG. 1c). Moreover, increased ORF74 activation may arise in an inflamed environment as a result of increased levels of agonists such as CXCL2 and CXCL8. Taken together, the ORF74-triggered onset of Kaposi’s sarcoma pathology may arise when constitutive activity of ORF74 is not kept in check as a consequence of environmental factors (such as co-infection with HIV or pro-inflammatory signals).

### ORF74 signalling in Kaposi’s sarcoma

The ORF74-induced onset of Kaposi’s sarcoma involves stimulation of a complex network of signalling pathways that involve the autocrine and paracrine activation of proliferative, pro-inflammatory and angiogenic pathways (FIG. 1 b). Constitutive activation of Ga<sub>q</sub>-mediated signalling triggers the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which ultimately activates the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) transcriptional regulator<sup>40–42</sup>. The excreted VEGF then initiates an autocrine stimulatory feed-forward loop by stimulating AKT<sup>43</sup>.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A growth factor that acts through its cognate receptor to stimulate the formation of new blood vessels, which provide tissues and tumours with nutrients and oxygen.

Furthermore, by coupling to Ga<sub>12/13</sub> proteins, ORF74 activity induces the expression of haem oxygenase 1 (HMOX1)<sup>44</sup>. Eventually, the activity of HMOX1 will enhance VEGF production in cells that express ORF74. In KSHV-infected cells, viral latency is prolonged by the ORF74-mediated activation of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)–prostaglandin E (PGE)–prostaglandin receptor axis<sup>45</sup>. Furthermore, inhibition of COX2 using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NS398 and celecoxib) reduced the excretion of inflammatory factors and reduced anchorage-independent colony formation in vFLIP-expressing cells. Therefore, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Kaposi’s sarcoma<sup>46</sup>.

ORF74 also activates transcriptional regulators such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)<sup>47,48</sup>, which is involved in the onset of the Kaposi’s sarcoma phenotype, including the development of spindle cell-like morphology and the paracrine stimulation of T-cell and monocyte chemotaxis<sup>49</sup>. The importance of ORF74-stimulated NF-κB activation was further underscored by the NF-κB transcriptional signature in ORF74-expressing endothelial cells<sup>50</sup>. NF-κB signalling can also be regulated by viral microRNAs, which could represent an alternative means of viral regulation of the latent to lytic switch (as shown in KSHV-infected cells)<sup>51</sup>.
The small GTPase RAC1 has an important role in neovascularization in Kaposi’s sarcoma and is a key mediator of ORF74-induced paracrine neoplasia^{47,52}. RAC1-mediated activation of NF-κB, AP1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) leads to the production of many pro-angiogenic and inflammatory factors, growth factors and adhesion molecules such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), CXCL8, CCL5, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and E-selectin^{53–56}. Hence, RAC1 and its downstream effectors may represent therapeutic targets for the treatment of Kaposi’s sarcoma.

As well as exploiting the expression and secretion of host factors to induce paracrine effects in Kaposi’s sarcoma development, ORF74 is reported to act in concert with a viral homologue of IL-6 to mediate expression of the pro-angiogenic factor angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2)^{57}. The effects mediated by the viral homologue of IL-6 involved activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, as a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) and a c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125) prevented ANGPT2 expression^{57}. Interestingly, use of anthrax lethal toxin, which targets components of the MAPK pathway, diminished the proliferation of and VEGF production in ORF74-expressing murine endothelial cells, further underlining the potential of therapeutically intervening in MAPK signalling in Kaposi’s sarcoma^{58}.

### ORF74-induced activation of the AKT–mTOR axis

The importance of paracrine activation of a proliferative, pro-angiogenic feed-forward loop was demonstrated in a study in which VEGF production by a subset of ORF74-expressing cells was shown to enhance VEGF production in bystander cells in an AKT-, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)- and HIF1α-dependent manner^{59} (FIG. 1d). As well as VEGF induction, mTOR was activated and both the development of Kaposi’s sarcoma and production of VEGF were sensitive to treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.

The mechanism by which ORF74 mediates activation of mTOR probably involves activation of kinases such as AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and inhibitor of NF-κB kinase-β (IKKβ), which phosphorylate tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 (proteins that are upstream of mTOR), resulting in loss of inhibition of mTOR^{60}. This then results in rapamycin-sensitive production of VEGF, through the activation of the transcriptional regulators HIF1α and HIF2α^{59}. Interestingly, as IKKβ mediates NF-κB activation, the release of inflammatory cytokines may be subject to positive feed-forward regulation that enhances the paracrine stimulation of mTOR activity. Blocking HIF1α activation with digoxin impairs excessive VEGF production in tumour allografts and may represent a way to pharmacologically intervene in the development of Kaposi’s sarcoma^{59}.

The above-mentioned studies have contributed substantially to knowledge of the potential role of ORF74 in KSHV-associated pathologies. Some of these observations need to be confirmed in virus-infected cells, as other viral factors may modulate KSHV pathology.

### ORF74 signalling in other diseases

The pathology of primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease^{61} originates from KSHV-infected B cells, with primary effusion lymphoma often occurring in patients who are co-infected with other lymphotropic viruses such as HIV or EBV^{18,62}. The study of the development of KSHV-mediated pathology in primary effusion lymphoma has been facilitated by lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients with this disease. Unexpectedly, the expression of ORF74 in such a cell line resulted in cell cycle arrest^{61}. An explanation for this finding could be ORF74 stalling progression of the KSHV lytic cycle, allowing the build-up of paracrine factors to mediate oncogenic transformation. However, it should be noted that overexpression of ORF74 may contribute to the observed effects in these experiments. Furthermore, other factors may modulate ORF74-mediated responses in virus-infected cells.

Although cell lines derived from primary effusion lymphoma cells and ORF74-expressing endothelial cells have different cellular backgrounds, they share some common signalling pathways but also show some cell-type dependent differences^{33}. For example, activation of NF-κB in a primary effusion lymphoma-derived cell does not seem to depend on pathways involving Ga~i~ signalling but rather a Ga~q~-protein kinase C (PKC)-based mechanism^{63}. This suggests that alternative therapeutic strategies might be needed for primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease compared to Kaposi’s sarcoma.

### Inhibiting ORF74

In summary, the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced Kaposi’s sarcoma involves a highly complex pattern of ORF74-controlled autocrine signalling and paracrine signalling events that stimulate prolonged viral latency, host cell proliferation and enhanced angiogenesis (FIG. 1). Transgenic mice expressing mutant receptors deficient in constitutive signalling, chemokine binding or chemokine-induced signalling had reduced incidence of tumours^{64}. Hence, the use of chemokines, modified chemokines or chemokine-derived peptides that have inverse agonistic and/or antagonistic properties may be new ways to interfere with ORF74-induced pathogenesis. However, no low-molecular-mass compounds have yet been reported that act as inverse agonists and/or antagonists on ORF74. As ORF74 binds multiple CXC ligands, the next step could be to evaluate known CXC chemokine receptor small-molecule antagonists to see whether they can modulate ORF74 function. In addition, homology models of ORF74 based on the crystal structures of GPCRs (for example, CXCR4)^{65} may allow virtual screening approaches to aid the identification of new chemical scaffolds for ORF74 (REF. 66).

Moreover, compounds targeting the pathways that are activated by ORF74, such as COX2, AKT or mTOR, may be clinically relevant for the treatment of KSHV pathology. However, targeting individual pathways in general has proven to have insufficient therapeutic potential to cure several cancers, and so combination therapies seem to be the key to successful anticancer

Figure 1 | Role of ORF74 in the KSHV infection cycle and onset of Kaposi’s sarcoma.  
a | Infection with Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) results in latent infections in which constitutive activity of the KSHV-encoded G protein-coupled receptor ORF74 is kept at a low level through various mechanisms (for example, ORF74 is expressed as bicistronic mRNA or through the activity of inverse agonistic or partial inverse agonistic chemokines such as CXCL10, CXCL12 and viral CCL2 (vCCL2)). Other KSHV latent proteins (for example FLIP and LANA1) are also in place to control the inflammatory responses of the host to the infection.  
b | When the KSHV life cycle shifts into the lytic phase, ORF74 activity is stimulated by CXCL1 and CXCL3. The control of ORF74 activity by host (CXCL10 and CXCL12) and viral (CCL2) factors is lowered and therefore constitutive activity of ORF74 is enhanced. Moreover, the viral lytic transcriptional activator ORF50 (also known as RTA) engages in a positive feed-forward loop that enhances ORF74 expression. As a result, ORF74 promiscuously activates several G proteins, resulting in the activation of transcriptional regulators hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), AP1, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). The activation of this set of transcriptional regulators triggers the synthesis and excretion of paracrine factors (that is, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)) to attract potential new host cells for the new KSHV viruses that disseminate at the end of the lytic phase.  
c | Untimely stimulation of constitutive and ligand-induced (CXCL1) activity of ORF74 or enhanced ORF74 expression (through the action of the HIV Tat protein) triggers activation of several G protein-activated signalling pathways (such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT, p38, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase-β (IKKβ) and external-regulated kinase (ERK); see also TABLE 1), which results in the activation of transcription factors, notably of NF-κB (inducing the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)) and HIF1α. The resulting excretion of autocrine and paracrine factors (such as VEGF, IL-6 and PGE2) mediates the proliferative and pro-angiogenic responses that are characteristic for Kaposi’s sarcoma.  
d | ORF74-induced increases in the levels of paracrine factors stimulates proliferative, pro-angiogenic signalling in bystander cells. This is mediated through endogenous effector systems that involve the activation of RAC1, PI3K, AKT, ERK, IKKβ and p38. Signalling through these pathways converges onto activation of the tuberous sclerosis (TSC)–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)–HIF1α and NF-κB pathways, resulting in a feed-forward overproduction of proliferative, pro-angiogenic factors (notably VEGF) that are typical of Kaposi’s sarcoma pathology. PTGER, prostaglandin E2 receptor.

expression of basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF) in a B-cell-specific manner that is comparable to BATF expression by activated Notch. BATF is an AP1-like transcriptional regulator that negatively regulates onset of EBV lytic cycle, and LMP1 and LMP2A activate NF-κB signalling to transform EBV-infected B cells into lymphoblastoid cells<sup>71</sup>. Furthermore, the EBV encoded vGPCR BILF1 constitutively activates cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-mediated and NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activity<sup>72,73</sup>. By acting in concert with the above-mentioned latency factors, BILF1 mediates EBV-induced lymphogenesis.

**Evasion of chemokine-induced cell responses.** BILF1 forms heteromers with all human chemokine receptors that are normally expressed on B lymphocytes<sup>74</sup>. This action could enable BILF1 to evade chemokine-mediated immune responses. For example, BILF1 inhibited chemokine-induced CXCR4 signalling by constitutively scavenging a shared pool of G proteins that are required for high-affinity binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 (REF. 75).

**Evasion of translational repression by protein kinase R.** Viruses produce double-stranded RNA, which stimulates the activation of protein kinase R (PKR; also known as EIF2AK2) in infected host cells. Activated PKR subsequently inhibits the synthesis of viral protein and induces cellular apoptosis to reduce viral dissemination<sup>76</sup>. Viruses have evolved several strategies to evade the cellular PKR response, including the expression of viral decoy double-stranded RNA that binds to but does not activate PKR, as well as virally encoded double-stranded RNA-binding proteins<sup>77</sup>.

Interestingly, transfection of BILF1 into a fibroblast-like cell line and into EBV-positive Burkitt’s lymphoma cells constitutively inhibited the activation of PKR<sup>72</sup>. By contrast, the constitutively active rat CMVs-encoded GPCR R33 was unable to repress the activity of PKR when expressed in fibroblast-like cells, which suggests that repression of PKR is not a common feature of herpesvirus-encoded vGPCRs. BILF1 is expressed as an early lytic cycle gene<sup>72,78</sup>, and together with EBV-encoded small double-stranded RNAs and the lytic-phase post-translational regulator protein SM<sup>79,80</sup>, it might facilitate viral replication by preventing PKR-mediated shutdown of translational machinery and apoptosis.

**Evasion of antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complexes.** EBV causes life-long infection in humans by residing in long-lived memory B lymphocytes in a translationally silent form to avoid immune recognition by CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. Once the virus transforms from the latent form to the growth-competent form and replicates, viral proteins that are expressed can be processed and presented at the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, thereby making infected cells susceptible to recognition and elimination by cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes<sup>81</sup>. Indeed, iatrogenic immunosuppression in organ transplant patients increased the incidence of EBV-associated pathologies, which could be reversed by infusion of

therapy. For example, the limitations of targeting a single pathway (that is, mTOR) in an animal model of Kaposi’s sarcoma may be overcome by targeting a second target (for example, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K))<sup>67</sup>. Moreover, as ORF74-induced signalling pathways differ in endothelial cells compared to B cells, therapies targeting components of the signalling pathways may differ for treatment of Kaposi’s sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease. Currently, there are no approved therapies for KSHV-induced Kaposi’s sarcoma.

**The EBV-encoded GPCR BILF1**  
EBV is associated with several lymphoproliferative pathologies such as infectious mononucleosis and Burkitt’s lymphoma. Infection with EBV usually occurs through contact with oral secretions that cause infectious mononucleosis. Life-long persistence of EBV infection is mediated through resting memory B cells. Different stages of latent EBV can be discriminated by the differing expression of several latent genes (EBNA1 to EBNA6, LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B)<sup>68</sup>. The proteins encoded by these genes mediate the level of viral infection and the oncogenic potential of viral infection. EBNA1 protects infected cells against apoptosis<sup>69</sup>, EBNA2 stimulates the

virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes<sup>82</sup>. Moreover, cells infected with a recombinant EBV strain in which the BILF1 gene was deleted resulted in increased recognition by EBV-lytic antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes<sup>83</sup>.

The effect of loss of BILF1 on EBV-infected cells illustrates the importance of this vGPCR in helping EBV evade viral antigen presentation<sup>83</sup>. BILF1 modulates levels of MHC class I molecules through a physical interaction that accelerates their internalization and lysosomal degradation<sup>84</sup>. This increased endocytosis of BILF1–MHC class I complexes depended on a specific lysine residue (K3.50) in the G protein-signalling motif on the boundary of transmembrane 3 and intracellular loop 2 of BILF1 (BOX 1), whereas subsequent degradation of these complexes depended on the carboxyl terminus of BILF1 (REFS 78,83). Interestingly, BILF1 also reduces the presentation of *de novo* synthesized MHC class I molecules at the cell surface, through a mechanism that does not involve the G protein-signalling motif or the C-terminal tail of the receptor<sup>83</sup>. Moreover, BILF1 cooperates with two other EBV lytic genes (namely BGLF5 and BNLF2A) to perturb the antigen-processing pathway in host cells to evade elimination<sup>85,86</sup>.

**Oncomodulatory role for EBV-encoded BILF1.** BILF1 transcripts were detected in EBV-positive Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines<sup>2,72</sup>, and this vGPCR has potential transforming capabilities in a mouse xenograft tumour model<sup>87</sup>. So far, no endogenous ligand has been identified for BILF1, and so the ligand-induced effects on signalling remain unknown. However, a mutant form of BILF1 that was uncoupled from its G protein reduced tumour formation in a mouse model, indicating the importance of constitutive activity and the need for inverse agonists that target this vGPCR<sup>87</sup>. BILF1 has low sequence similarity (<15%) with other GPCRs and so will not benefit from the recent advances in structure-based virtual screening approaches to identify inverse agonists. However, measurement of intracellular cAMP levels in high-throughput screening assays could be used to identify inverse agonists that inhibit constitutive BILF1 signalling.

So far, no studies of BILF1-targeting compounds have been reported. Considering the multifaceted nature of EBV pathology, targeting BILF1 by inverse agonists could be a new therapeutic strategy. There are no current treatments for latent (disease-causing) infections.

HCMV-encoded vGPCRs

In contrast to the oncogenic γ-herpesviruses KSHV and EBV, HCMV is considered to be an oncomodulator rather than a neoplasia-causing agent. Although controversies have been reported, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that HCMV is involved in malignancies and vascular diseases<sup>88</sup>.

Of the four HCMV-encoded vGPCRs that have been described (US27, US28, UL33 and UL78)<sup>89</sup>, US28 is the best characterized. US28 binds CC and CX3C chemokines<sup>90–92</sup>, can be constitutively active and promiscuously couples to G proteins *in vitro* and in HCMV-infected cells<sup>12,93,94</sup>. Through ligand-dependent

and constitutive activity, US28 can reprogramme host cellular signalling towards that associated with proliferative responses (TABLE 2). The other HCMV-encoded receptors UL33, US27 and UL78 do not bind chemokines; UL33 is constitutively active<sup>95</sup>, whereas UL78 does not seem to modulate intracellular signalling in the cell types that have so far been analysed. However, US27 was recently shown to enhance cell proliferation and alter gene expression when expressed in HEK293 cells<sup>96</sup>. Further experiments are needed to explore whether US27 activates proliferative signalling in HCMV-infected cells. Moreover, US27 and UL78 can modulate the function of other vGPCRs and host GPCRs by forming heterodimeric GPCR complexes<sup>97,98</sup> (BOX 1).

**Role of vGPCRs in tissue tropism and viral dissemination in the host.** The differences in the number and characteristics of vGPCRs that are encoded by distinct CMV species, as well as the restricted range of hosts that CMV species infect are substantial hurdles to the development of appropriate animal models in which to study the role of HCMV-encoded vGPCRs in viral infection and associated diseases. US28 and US27 are only encoded by primate CMVs and not by mouse or rat CMVs. By contrast, UL33 and UL78 are conserved across all CMV species, but have different cellular localizations, signalling and chemokine binding profiles<sup>95,99,100</sup>. Nevertheless, gene deletion studies in which the open-reading frame from the virus that encodes the vGPCR is deleted and/or substituted by the HCMV-encoded GPCR orthologues have provided important insights into the role of vGPCRs in tissue tropism and viral dissemination, and *in vivo* disease model systems<sup>101,102</sup>.

US27, US28, UL33 and UL78 are present on the viral envelope<sup>92,103–107</sup>, but viral replication does not depend on their expression. However, vGPCRs on the viral envelope may facilitate infection. For example, the interaction between CX3CL1 on the host cell membrane and US28 on the viral envelope has been proposed to facilitate HCMV infection of target cells<sup>92,106</sup>. Deletion of the gene encoding US27 from HCMV showed that this receptor acts at a late stage of the HCMV replication cycle to support the release of virions from infected cells<sup>108</sup>. Disruption of the genes encoding UL33 and UL78 orthologues in rat CMV (R33 and R78, respectively) and mouse CMV (M33 and M78, respectively) indicated that these vGPCRs are important in virulence *in vivo*. Mutant rat CMV or mouse CMV that lacked the UL33 orthologues were not able to persist and replicate in the salivary glands — the major site of persistent CMV replication and shedding for horizontal transmission to other hosts<sup>109</sup> — of infected rats and mice, respectively<sup>110,111</sup>. In mice, viral dissemination depended on the presence and constitutive activity of M33 (REF. 112). Moreover, M33 attenuates the clearance of mouse CMV from mouse spleen (but not pancreas, liver and lungs)<sup>113</sup>, whereas R33 was dispensable for viral spread to rat spleen, kidney, lungs, heart and pancreas<sup>110</sup>.

Infection of immunocompromised rats or rats undergoing organ transplantation with rat CMV that lacked R33 resulted in lower mortality as well as less

severe transplant-induced vascular sclerosis and chronic allograft rejection^{109,110,114}. Although these studies suggest that inhibition of constitutive M33 and R33 activity by inverse agonists reduces viral dissemination, UL33 might be a less promising therapeutic target as it has lower levels of constitutive activity and was unable to compensate for the deletion of M33 in mutant mouse CMV^{111,112}. Interestingly, M33 mediates the migration of mouse CMV-infected cells towards mouse CCL5 (REF. 100), which might be blocked by specific antagonists. However, UL33 and R33 are unable to interact with human and rat CCL5, respectively^{95,99}.

Infection of normal and immunocompromised mice with mouse CMV that lacked the M78 receptor had reduced mortality and viral spread to spleen, liver and salivary glands, which was related to decreased replication in cultured permissive cells^{115}. Similar *in vitro* and *in vivo* phenotypes were observed for the R78 deletion mutant of rat CMV^{116,117}. Interestingly, HCMV-encoded UL78 is required for viral entry in epithelial cells but not for viral replication in permissive fibroblasts or *ex vivo* renal artery organ cultures^{118,119}. Hence, UL78 might have different properties with respect to tissue tropism or viral replication compared to M78 and R78. This might be related to the ability of UL78 and UL33 to form heteromeric complexes with US28 and inhibit constitutive US28-mediated NF-κB activation^{120} (BOX 1).

**Immune evasion by chemokine scavenging and receptor hijacking.** US28 binds many human CC and CX3C chemokines^{90–92,106,121,122} (TABLE 2). In contrast to most human GPCRs, US28 is predominantly localized in perinuclear endosomes as a consequence of ligand-independent phosphorylation of its C-terminus by GPCR kinases and continuous internalization from the cell surface^{104,123–125}. Indeed, HCMV-infected cells effectively reduced extracellular chemokine levels through US28-dependent internalization^{126–128}, which might be an immune-evading mechanism to avoid attraction of and subsequent clearance by leukocytes. Small-molecule compounds that inhibit CCL5 binding to US28 could prevent chemokine scavenging by US28, thereby allowing effective recruitment of leukocytes to HCMV-infected cells. Such small-molecule compounds have been identified, but have yet to be tested^{129–132}.

As, previously mentioned, vGPCRs can modulate host chemokine receptor function by forming heteromeric complexes. For example, UL33 and UL78 can form heteromers with human CCR5 and CXCR4, resulting in the translocation of CCR5 to the cell surface, translocation of CXCR4 to intracellular sites and impaired cell chemotaxis towards CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokines^{97}. Translocation of host chemokine receptors was also observed in monocytes infected with several clinical and laboratory strains of HCMV^{133}, which resulted in a reduced chemokine-driven migration of monocytes. Infection with ultraviolet-inactivated HCMV showed similar translocation of host chemokine receptors, indicating that transcription of viral genes was not required to induce these effects. This suggests that vGPCRs expressed on the viral envelope might indeed be involved in chemokine receptor translocation^{98}.

---

As a result of heteromerization between UL33 or UL78 and CCR5 or CXCR4, HIV entry into cells by these two chemokine receptors was impaired^{97}. Although HCMV-infected cells are indeed less susceptible to HIV infection, they promote infection of HCMV-negative bystander cells with HIV through paracrine mechanisms^{134}. Therefore, HCMV-encoded vGPCRs evade the actions of chemokine-regulated immune cells through the targeting of chemokines and chemokine receptors.

**US28 in proliferative pathologies**

**Oncomodulatory role of HCMV.** HCMV infection is associated with various malignancies, including colon and prostate cancer and different forms of brain cancer, namely glioblastoma^{135–138}, medulloblastoma^{139} and neuroblastoma^{140}. It has not been proved that HCMV is oncogenic, but it is suggested to have an oncomodulatory role; that is, HCMV can increase the malignant potential of tumour cells^{88}. HCMV infects many cell types, which is dependent on the expression of cellular receptors such as integrins, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)^{141–143}. The upregulation of these receptors in different types of malignancies may therefore favour infection of the neoplastic cells^{144}. HCMV infection of host cells, fibroblasts and tumour cells alters the expression of many genes that regulate cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, cell adhesion and gene-encoding transcription factors^{145,146}. Interestingly, there are decreased levels of modulation of some of these genes in cells infected with mutant strains of HCMV that are devoid of vGPCRs or cells targeted with small interfering (siRNA) against vGPCRs (see below).

**Constitutive activation of proliferative and angiogenic signalling by US28.** HCMV infection that is associated with the expression of vGPCRs induces cellular responses that provide a growth advantage for neoplastic cells and could exacerbate the progression of cancer. Ectopic expression of US28 in mice induces a pro-angiogenic and transformed phenotype through upregulation of VEGF^{147}. Cells that express a mutant form of US28 that was uncoupled from G proteins (US28-R3.50A; also known as US28-R^{129}A) and cells infected with a HCMV mutant strain devoid of US28 have impaired activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and reduced proliferation, indicating that the constitutive activity of US28 is crucial for this effect^{136,147,148}.

Tumour formation that is mediated by US28 involves the action of COX2, which is known to be upregulated in inflammatory diseases and cancer^{148,149}. Indeed, treatment of mice expressing US28 xenograft tumours with the selective COX2 inhibitor celecoxib delayed tumour onset and reduced growth, which was mediated by the repression of US28-induced angiogenic activity^{148}. It was shown that US28 directly activates NF-κB, which drives the expression of COX2. The subsequent elevated levels of prostaglandins activate their cognate receptors to induce production of VEGF in infected fibroblasts^{148} (FIG. 2a,b). Indeed, US28-dependent increases of COX2 are already apparent early after HCMV infection^{148}. This

Figure 2 | US28-mediated signalling and cellular responses that result in a proliferative, pro-angiogenic and migratory phenotype. a | Infection of cells with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which is initiated by the virus binding to entry receptors such as integrins or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), results in the expression of the viral G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) US28 that constitutively activates several G protein-mediated (predominantly Ga<sub>q</sub>) signalling pathways, which activate transcriptional regulators such as nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), T-cell factor (TCF)-lymphoid enhancing factor (LEF) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). US28 activity can be further modulated through the action of several chemokines (such as CX3CL1, CCL2 and CCL5). Activation of the transcriptional regulators stimulates proliferation (through the activation of cyclin D1), inflammation (through the activation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and angiogenesis (through the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)). US28 also activates β-catenin signalling in a ligand-dependent manner (via Ga<sub>12/13</sub> and Ga<sub>q</sub> proteins) as well as in a ligand-independent manner (which involves RHO-GEFs). Both these pathways converge at RHOA–RHO kinase (ROCK), resulting in the increased transcriptional activation of TCF–LEF<sup>166</sup>. US28-induced excretion of cytokines and growth factors from the host cell act on their cognate receptors to induce autocrine cellular responses. b | The excreted cytokines and growth factor enhance the cellular responses of neighbouring cells. US28-induced secretion of prostaglandins activate their cognate receptors to induce production of VEGF. Notably, IL-6 can activate the IL-6 receptor and stimulate the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)–STAT3 axis in bystander cells through a positive feed-forward loop. In this way, US28-mediated signalling, together with other HCMV-encoded factors (including other viral GPCRs), may create the inflammatory, pro-angiogenic environment to stimulate HCMV-mediate oncomodulation. c | The chemokine ligand CCL5 enhances the activity of US28 through the activation of Ga<sub>12</sub> proteins<sup>173</sup> to stimulate smooth muscle cell migration. Agonist-induced US28 activity results in SRC-mediated formation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) complexes. This results in the detachment of cells, which is mediated by the integrin–talin paxillin complex<sup>172</sup> and cytoskeletal rearrangements by RHO-, RAC- and/or cell division cycle 42 (CDC42)-mediated signals. In addition, the activation of different transcription factors that alter gene expression patterns to stimulate cellular migration. PTGER, prostaglandin E2 receptor.

which is associated with the activation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and an increased activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling pathway<sup>146,154</sup> (FIG. 2a,b). Targeting the IL-6–STAT3 axis with inhibitors (for example, IL-6-neutralizing antibodies, an inhibitor of the IL-6 receptor, short hairpin RNA targeting IL-6 or a STAT3 inhibitor) effectively inhibited US28-induced proliferative signalling and VEGF secretion in cells that expressed US28 and in bystander cells<sup>154</sup>. In HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of US28 inhibited VEGF production and glioma cell-mediated angiogenesis<sup>146</sup>. The observed activation of the STAT3–IL-6 axis by US28 is of particular interest, as gliomas and some cancer stem cells require IL-6 and STAT3 for tumour growth and survival<sup>155</sup>.

The transcriptional activation of IL-6 by STAT3 creates a positive feed-forward loop, whereby the initial activation of IL-6 can then activate neighbouring cells in a paracrine manner, propagating the response. Indeed, such paracrine and autocrine loops have been described in cancer cells<sup>156,157</sup>. Enhanced IL-6 production on HCMV infection has also been reported in endothelial cells<sup>158</sup> — which are sites of HCMV persistence — suggesting that US28 may accelerate the progression of glioblastoma through paracrine signalling.

If the expression or function of the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3; a negative regulator of STAT3) is lost or altered owing to mutations or to promoter hypermethylation, the positive feed-forward loop may be maintained and the disease state is aggravated (FIG. 2a,b). Patients with glioblastoma have increased levels of IL-6 and phosphorylated STAT3 (REF. 154) and loss of SOCS3 expression, which are all associated with decreased patient survival<sup>159</sup>. This further underlines the importance of the IL-6–STAT3 axis in glioblastoma.

US28 induces an invasive phenotype. US28 and phosphorylated STAT3 are colocalized in the vascular niche of glioblastoma tumours<sup>154</sup>. US28 also colocalizes with VEGF, COX2 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which suggests that multiple US28-driven signalling pathways contribute to the aggressiveness of primary glioblastoma cells<sup>146</sup>. Moreover, US28 induces an invasive and angiogenic phenotype in these cells<sup>146</sup>, which is reduced following knockdown of US28 with siRNA, thus confirming that US28 contributes to this phenotype. Addition of CCL5-specific antibodies also reduced the invasiveness of primary glioblastoma cells. As chemokines such as CCL5 and CCL2 are abundantly expressed in malignant gliomas<sup>160</sup>, ligand-dependent US28 signalling may contribute to the development of glioblastoma.

HCMV proteins have also been identified in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumour in children<sup>139</sup>. In medulloblastoma cells, HCMV infection induces the expression of COX2. In these cells, the addition of valganciclovir or celecoxib prevented HCMV replication, inhibited PGE2 production and reduced cell growth<sup>139</sup>. In vivo, valganciclovir or celecoxib also inhibited PGE2 production as well as reduced

might be sufficient to catalyse inflammatory processes, which may contribute to or enhance tumour formation<sup>148</sup>. Recent work demonstrated that US28 can signal at very low expression levels<sup>136</sup>, further demonstrating the potent effects that this receptor has on altering host cellular signalling.

**US28 in brain cancer.** Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults and children and is associated with a poor prognosis, with current treatments relying on surgery and chemotherapy. Since the first discovery of the high prevalence of HCMV DNA and proteins in glioblastoma<sup>135</sup>, the presence and role of HCMV in gliomas has been debated in the literature<sup>150</sup>. Yet, studies have shown that treatment with the anti-viral valganciclovir prolonged the survival of patients with glioblastoma<sup>151</sup>. Moreover, infection of genetically modified mice (p53<sup>-/+</sup>) with mouse CMV accelerated the progression of glioblastoma, underscoring the role of CMV in the pathology of glioblastoma<sup>152</sup>. Importantly, several studies have shown that US28 is expressed in glioblastoma specimens from patients<sup>138,146,150,153,154</sup>, further emphasizing a role for this vGPCR in glioblastoma.

**US28 activates the STAT3–IL-6 axis.** Fibroblasts that express US28, as well as glioblastoma cells and HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells, have increased levels of IL-6,

medulloblastoma growth<sup>139</sup>. US28 was expressed soon after infection in medulloblastoma cells and the increase in COX2 expression occurred in ultraviolet-treated HCMV infected cells. Together, these data suggest that US28 may be responsible for the early expression of COX2 in medulloblastoma<sup>92,106</sup>.

**US28 in colorectal cancer.** HCMV nucleic acids and proteins have been detected in neoplastic cells from human colorectal polyps and adenocarcinomas<sup>161,162</sup> and were colocalized with COX2 expression. As COX2 can promote angiogenesis and invasion of colon adenocarcinoma cells, HCMV-infected colon cancer cells might acquire an additional growth advantage through this mechanism.

As US28 can induce COX2 expression, it is anticipated that this receptor has a role in colorectal cancer. Transgenic mice that expressed US28 in intestinal epithelial cells and stem cells (LGR5<sup>+</sup> cells) had a hyperplastic intestinal epithelium and developed adenomas and adenocarcinomas at 40 weeks of age<sup>163</sup>. These mice also had a significantly higher tumour burden in a colitis-driven tumour model. Transgenic co-expression of the inflammatory chemokine CCL2, a chemokine that is expressed in many inflammatory conditions<sup>164</sup> including inflammatory bowel disease, exacerbated the neoplastic phenotype. This suggests that in US28- and colitis-driven cancer, CCL2 may directly enhance US28 signalling<sup>90</sup>. Alternatively, US28 may constitutively potentiate CCL2-induced CCR2 signalling; in a way that is similar to the observed US28-mediated potentiation of CCR1 and lysophosphatidic acid receptor signalling<sup>136,165</sup>.

**US28-induced activation of β-catenin.** US28 can modulate the WNT/Frizzled pathway, leading to accumulation of β-catenin through mechanisms that are cell-type dependent<sup>166</sup> (FIG. 2a,b). This increase in β-catenin activity was inhibited by a low-molecular-mass inverse agonist of US28 (REF. 166). As patients with prolonged inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer<sup>167</sup>, we speculate that these patients who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy may be prone to reactivation of HCMV, which could favour the development of dysplasia.

Moreover, transgenic mice that co-expressed US28 and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor rapidly developed (in 5 weeks) large caecal serrated polyps, which were associated with increased phosphorylation of EGFR and MAPK within the serrated epithelium<sup>168</sup>. Administration of pharmacological inhibitors of EGFR or MAPK to these mice reduced polyp development. Together, these data indicate that expression of US28, in addition with other oncogenic factors and activating mutations, could enhance tumour development.

**Role of US28 in vascular diseases**

HCMV infection is associated with the development of vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, restenosis following angioplasty and transplant vasculopathy associated with the development of chronic solid organ allograft rejection<sup>169,170</sup>.

**US28-induced cell mobilization.** HCMV typically infects cell types that are involved in vascular disease, including smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages<sup>171</sup>. Migration of these cells is a critical

event underlying vascular pathologies and is associated with inflammation that is partly caused by an increased expression of chemokines. Indeed, several studies showed that US28 directs cellular migration through binding of different chemokines via coupling to distinct G proteins in a cell-type specific manner^{172–174}. Smooth muscle cells infected with a mutant form of HCMV that lacked US28 had impaired migration^{175} (FIG. 2c). Hence, US28 may contribute to the acceleration of vascular disease through the CC chemokine-mediated migration of smooth muscle cells into the vessel intima and the CX3CL1-mediated infiltration and disposition of US28-expressing monocytes and macrophages into atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, inhibitors that target the chemokine-US28 interface might reduce HCMV-associated vascular pathologies; although this strategy has yet to be tested.

**Paracrine signalling.** It is also important to consider the ability of HCMV infection to alter the microenvironment during the development of vascular disease, by inducing secretion of cellular factors that act in a paracrine fashion to enhance, for example, angiogenic processes^{176}. This so-called ‘HCMV secretome’ from HCMV-infected endothelial cells and fibroblasts includes the release of cellular factors growth factors (for example, VEGF, transforming growth factor-β, PDGF and hepatocyte growth factor), chemokines, cytokines (for example, IL-5 and IL-6), and extracellular matrix-modifying enzymes (for example, matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) (FIG. 2a,b; not all excreted factors are shown). The secretome promotes angiogenesis *in vitro*, suggesting that these factors exacerbate the disease state^{176}. These observations are consistent with the finding that expression of US28 enhances the secretion of VEGF^{148}. Additional studies are needed to further delineate the contribution of vGPCRs in release of other paracrine factors in HCMV-associated pathologies.

**Inhibiting US28 activity**

Together, the studies described above support a role for US28 in virus-associated inflammatory and proliferative diseases. As US28 expression is observed in vascular tissue, targeting this vGPCR might decrease tumour vascularization and potentially have beneficial effects in vascular diseases^{169–171}. Thus, compounds that target US28 and inhibit chemokine binding and constitutive activity of US28 (that is, inverse agonists) might serve as attractive therapeutic agents. Indeed, during the past decade several low-molecular-mass compounds — based on various chemical scaffolds — that bind to US28 have been identified^{177}. Series of piperazinyldibenzothi-epins (FIG. 3a,b), cinchonine and cinchonidine derivatives (FIG. 3c), arylamines (FIG. 3d) and benzamides (FIG. 3e) were described to inhibit chemokine binding to US28 in patient applications^{177–180}. Although methiothepin (FIG. 3a), octoclothepin (FIG. 3b) and S(-)-IBZM (FIG. 3e) were reported to induce US28-mediated intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization^{179,180}, they also partially inhibited constitutive signalling by US28 (REF. 132).

**Allosteric ligand**

A ligand that binds to a receptor at a different site than an endogenous ligand to subsequently modulate receptor activity and/or binding of endogenous ligands.

Based on receptor similarity, the CCR1 antagonist 5-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl)-2,2-diphenylpentanenitrile (VUF2274) was identified as full inverse agonist for US28-mediated PLC activation^{129} (FIG. 3f). Mutational analysis of US28 showed that VUF2274 binds US28 within the seven-transmembrane pocket to act as an allosteric ligand to inhibit chemokine binding^{129}. Structure–activity relationship analysis showed that the 4-phenylpiperidine of VUF2274 is essential for affinity and its inverse agonist activity, whereas other substituents on this scaffold did not improve the micromolar potency to inhibit chemokine binding or constitutive US28 signalling^{129–132}. Dihydroisoquinolines and tetrahydroisoquinolines (FIG. 3g) were identified as US28 inverse agonists based on the structure of previously identified CXCR3 antagonists^{181}. Compounds based on flavonoids — which have many biological effects, including disruption of CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 and CXCR7 — may also act as US28 ligands, as a series of halogen-substituted flavonoids were recently shown to inhibit constitutive US28 signalling^{182} (FIG. 3h).

The low-molecular-mass compounds identified so far have micromolar or submicromolar potencies for inhibiting US28 activity, which prevents their *in vivo* testing in disease models. However, the increasing number of high-resolution X-ray structures of GPCRs, including chemokine receptors, will facilitate virtual-screening campaigns on US28 to identify new scaffolds^{66}.

**Conclusion**

The evidence for a role of vGPCRs in herpesvirus-associated inflammatory and proliferative diseases is increasing and can no longer be neglected. Their expression in patient specimens (which is correlated with disease severity) and their observed capacity to reprogramme and subvert cellular signalling through direct and indirect mechanisms further underscores their involvement in disease progression. However, to further validate vGPCRs as potential targets for therapeutic intervention, the continued development of relevant (transgenic) animal model systems of herpesvirus-associated diseases is necessary. In particular, the effects of vGPCRs should be confirmed in the presence of other viral gene products in virus-infected host cells. The strict host tropism of herpesviruses in combination with distinct vGPCR expression patterns, functional properties and lack of vGPCR orthologues complicates the use of *in vivo* virus infection models. However the use of recombinant murine viral strains in which vGPCRs are substituted by human vGPCR orthologues is a valuable tool in the exploration of the role of human vGPCRs in *in vivo* murine disease models^{101,102}. In addition, the use of herpesvirus-infected (patient-derived) cells in orthotopic xenograft animal models are relevant.

Chemokines with inverse agonistic properties, mutant vGPCRs, viral strains devoid of vGPCRs, siRNA approaches and low-molecular-mass molecules targeting the receptor or downstream signalling pathways have been valuable tools to modulate and study vGPCR activity. Most importantly, the presence of vGPCRs at inflammatory sites and tumour cells provide important

virus-specific targets for directed therapies. Moreover, targeting the constitutive activity of ORF74 has been shown to inhibit paracrine stimulation of bystander cells resulting in tumour regression<sup>30</sup>. As these paracrine signalling events occur in the absence of viral replication and has been reported for other vGPCRs as well<sup>146,154</sup>, vGPCRs are potential targets to therapeutically combat herpesvirus-associated tumours and inflammatory diseases.

Given the high druggability of GPCRs in general, these vGPCRs can be considered promising drug targets. Despite this, modulators of ORF74 and BILF1 have not yet been reported. Although some inverse agonists have been described for US28, some of these are derived from

chemokine receptor antagonists and so more selective and more potent modulators are required. The recent breakthroughs of the crystallization of GPCRs, and in particular the chemokine receptors CXCR4 (REF. 65) and CCR5 (REF. 183), may guide the identification of new modulators of ORF74 and US28 through virtual-screening approaches<sup>66</sup>. Moreover, biologics have proven to be highly selective therapeutics for the chemokine receptor system<sup>174,185</sup>, and so might also be identified for vGPCRs. Moving forward, structure-based virtual-screening approaches and use of antibody-based platforms might hold much promise for the identification of effective modulators for this intriguing class of vGPCRs.
