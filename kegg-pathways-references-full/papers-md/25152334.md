ABSTRACT

Tight junctions (TJ) regulate the paracellular passage of ions and molecules through the paracellular pathway and maintain plasma membrane polarity in epithelial and endothelial cells. Apart from these canonical functions, several proteins of the TJ have been found in recent years to regulate gene expression. This function is found in proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and TJs, and in integral TJ proteins. In this review, we will describe these proteins and their known mechanisms of gene regulation.

1. Introduction

Tight junctions (TJ) are cell-cell adhesion structures located at the uppermost portion of lateral membrane at the limit with the apical surface [1]. By transmission electron microscopy, the TJ is observed as a set of points where the outer leaflets of the membranes of adjacent cells appear to fuse, obstructing the passage through the paracellular pathway of electrodense markers like lanthanum or ruthenium red. By freeze-fracture, TJs are viewed as a network of strands that encircles the cells bellow the apical microvilli.

TJs are integrated by a complex group of molecules that include integral (e.g. occludin, tricellulin, claudins and JAMs) and adaptor proteins (e.g. ZOs, MAGIs, cingulin and paracingulin) [2]. The former establish cell to cell interactions that seal the intercellular space and are responsible for the paracellular ionic selectivity (e.g. claudins), while the latter function both as a bridge between the integral TJ proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, and as a cytoplasmic platform that concentrates a variety of cell signaling proteins at the TJ, including kinases, phosphatases, G proteins and transcription factors.

Besides the two canonical functions of TJ known as fence and gate, new roles for TJ proteins have been revealed concerning the

Fig. 1. ZO-1 sequesters the transcription factor ZONAB away from the nucleus blocking in consequence the transcription of molecules involved in cell proliferation. ZO-1 sequesters ZONAB at the cytoplasm and cell borders. Apg2 competes with ZONAB for binding to the SH3 domain of ZO-1. Heat shock stimulates ZO-1 recruitment of Apg2 to cell junctions and liberates ZONAB. Cytoplasmic ZONAB interacts with GEF-H1, travels to the nucleus, binds to the 3′ untranslated region of p21 mRNA and associates to promoters containing inverted CCAAT boxes. Hence ZONAB over-expression induces the transcription of genes that induce cell proliferation like CD1, CDK4 and PCNA and blocks the transcription of others that participate in epithelial differentiation like megalin, cubulin and ErbB-2. GTP bound RalA blocks ZONAB transcriptional activity by recruiting ZONAB to cell-cell junctions. Symplekin cooperates with ZONAB transcriptional activity.

regulation of cell proliferation and gene transcription. For this purpose, many of the adaptor proteins have nuclear localization (NLS) and exportation (NES) signals that allow them to shuttle between the nucleus and the plasma membrane.

Here we will describe the role played by different TJ proteins in the control of gene expression, and how their subcellular localization regulates gene transcription.

2. ZO-1

Zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) is a 225 kDa protein that belongs to the MAGUK (membrane associated guanilase kinase homologue) protein family. In silico analysis reveals that cZO-1 has 3 bipartite NLS and 5 NES [3,4], however their function and regulation has not been studied experimentally. ZO-1 is present at the nuclei of subconfluent epithelial cells in culture and in cells that border an inflicted wound, thus revealing that the nuclear localization of ZO-1 is favored in proliferating cells [4].

ZO-1 expression has an inverse relationship with cell proliferation. Thus in cancerous tissues the expression of ZO-1 is diminished, while in MDCK cells ZO-1 over-expression reduces cell proliferation [5].

The SH3 domain of ZO-1 interacts with the Y-box transcription factor ZONAB (ZO-1 associated nucleic acid binding protein) [6] and this interaction regulates gene expression inside and outside of the nucleus, the latter by cytoplasmic sequestration of the transcription factor. Hence the over-expression of ZO-1 reduces the nuclear pool of ZONAB [6]. The level of expression of ZONAB is as that of ZO-1, regulated by cell density albeit in an opposite direction: ZONAB content is high in sparse cultures and low in quiescent non-proliferating cells [6].

Small GTPases also down-regulate ZONAB transcriptional activity by sequestering ZONAB away from the nucleus. Thus, GTP bound RalA co-localizes with ZONAB at cell-cell junctions in an increasing manner as the cell culture become more dense [7]. This interaction relieves the transcriptional repression exerted on ZONAB regulated promoters.

ZONAB also interacts with the cell division kinase 4 (CDK4), and regulates the amount of CDK4 present at the nucleus. Thus, the over-expression of ZO-1 or the SH3 domain of ZO-1 reduces, through cytoplasmic sequestration, the nuclear content of ZONAB, that in turn reduces the nuclear pool of CDK4 and cyclin D1 (CD1) [5].

ZONAB also regulates the expression of cell cycle genes. Thus, ZONAB induces the up-regulation of CD1 and the proliferative cell

Fig. 2. At the nucleus ZO-2 localizes in speckles in association with PtdIns and different factors involved in gene transcription and mRNA processing. Entry of ZO-2 into the nucleus and localization in speckles is regulated by several NLS and the phosphorylation of SR repeats by the kinase SRPK. At the nucleus ZO-2 associates with lamin B1; PtdIns (4,5)P₂; the essential splicing protein SC-35; ZASP, a protein of nuclear speckles; SAF-B, a chromatin component that participates in the assembly of transcriptosome complexes and to several transcription factors including Jun, Fos, C/EBP and c-myc.

nuclear antigen (PCNA), whose genes contain an inverted CCAAT box sequence that functions as a ZONAB binding site [8].

The transcriptional activity of ZONAB is induced by its interaction with the Rho GTPase activator guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1 [9]. In addition, ZONAB is indirectly activated by Apg-2, a member of the Hsp110 family that competes with ZONAB for binding to the SH3 domain of ZO-1 [10]. Thus, heat shock stimulates the junctional recruitment of Apg-2 and in turn liberates ZONAB from ZO-1 sequestration at the junctions. Stress-induced ZONAB activation also leads to the up-regulation of p21 protein and mRNA [11]. p21 is a key component of the cellular stress response and, interestingly, its up-regulation is mediated by ZONAB binding to the 3′-untranslated region of the p21 mRNA, that results in mRNA stabilization and enhanced translation. This process is also activated by GEF-H1.

ZONAB represses cell differentiation. Hence during the polarization of proximal tubule epithelial cells, ZONAB levels decrease while the expression of ZONAB targets and apical differentiation markers megalin and cubulin increase [12]. In accordance, in the retinal pigment epithelium, the over-expression of ZONAB induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [13]. In addition, ZO-1 and ZONAB regulate the transcription of Erbb-2, a gene important for epithelial differentiation and morphogenesis. Thus, the activity of Erbb-2 promoter is inhibited by ZONAB over-expression in confluent cultures, and is activated by ZO-1 over-expression in sparse cells [6] (Fig. 1).

3. ZO-2

Zona occludens 2 (ZO-2) is a 160 kDa protein with several functional NLS and NES [14,15], some of which are regulated by phosphorylation [16] and O-N-acetylglucosylation [15]. In subconfluent cultures, newly synthesized ZO-2 travels to the nucleus before reaching the plasma membrane [16], whereas in confluent cultures the protein makes no stop over at the nucleus [15]. ZO-2 travels to the nucleus at late G1, and becomes diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm upon mitosis [17], thus explaining why in confluent cultures no ZO-2 is present at the nucleus, while in cells in proliferation ZO-2 concentrates at the nucleus [18].

At the nucleus ZO-2 localizes in nuclear speckles [18]. These interchromatin granule clusters accumulate high concentrations of pre-mRNA splicing factors and other molecules involved in mRNA production by RNA polymerase II, and play an important role in coordinating their supply for gene expression. In accordance, ZO-2 associates with several molecules present in nuclear speckles like the essential pre-mRNA splicing factor SC-35 [18]; ZASP, a novel ZO-2 associated speckle protein [19]; SAF-B, a chromatin component involved in the assembly of transcriptosome complexes [20]; and via its second PDZ domain to 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P₂] [21]. In addition, segment U2 of ZO-2 located between PDZ 1 and 2, contains 16 serine/arginine (S/R) repeats [18] which target pre-mRNA splicing factors to nuclear speckles [22], and a docking motif for the kinase SRPK that phosphorylates SR motifs. ZO-2 interacts

Fig. 3. ZO-2 blocks the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transformation. ZO-2 over-expression blocks the transcription of artificial reporters regulated by AP-1 sites, of CD1 by association through c-myc to an E-box and of Siamois, a target of the Wnt pathway regulated by β-catenin and the transcription factor TCF/LEF. The hydrodynamic transfection of ZO-2 to mice confirms that ZO-2 blocks the activation of the Wnt pathway. The forced expression of ZO-2 at the nuclei by the addition of exogenous NLS, promotes the transcription of pyruvate kinase M2-PK, whereas the KD of ZO-2 induces the transcription of metalloproteinase MT1.

with SRPK1 in the cytoplasm, and the activation of SRPK induced by treatment with EGF and mediated by AKT, provokes the phosphorylation of ZO-2 at serine residues, the importation of the protein to the nucleus and its accumulation in speckles [15].

ZO-2 also associates to proteins of the nuclear matrix like lamin B1 and actin [23]; and to the transcription factors Jun, Fos, and C/EBP [24] c-myc [25] and KyoT2 [26] (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the distribution of Jun, Fos and C/EBP is sensitive to cellular density. Thus, in sparse cultures these transcription factors are concentrated at the nucleus, while in confluent monolayers they are more abundant at the plasma membrane in association with ZO-2. These observations suggest that the sequestration of transcription factors away from the nucleus and at the TJ, might be a mechanism employed by ZO-2 for the down-regulation of gene transcription.

ZO-2 over-expression inhibits the transcription of reporter genes under the control of promoters with AP-1 sites [24] and CD1 transcription by interaction with the transcription factor c-myc [25] that recognizes the E-box region in CD1 promoter [25]. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) cooperates with ZO-2 and c-myc to repress CD1 transcription and the speckle protein ZASP, blocks the inhibitory activity of ZO-2 on CD1 promoter [19] (Fig. 3).

ZO-2 diminishes the level of CD1 protein [17] but in cells synchronized by serum starvation, ZO-2 over-expression exerts no effect on the amount of CD1 mRNA and instead inhibits CD1 translation and accelerates CD1 decay at the proteosome [17].

ZO-2 blocks the Wnt pathway since its over-expression represses the transcription of a reporter gene controlled by TCF/LEF binding sites and of Siamois promoter, and lowers the amount of

Axin-2 mRNA, whose gene is target of the Wnt route [17]. The hydrodynamic transfection of ZO-2 into mice, prevents podocyte’s injury mediated by the Wnt pathway in a model of adriamycin nephrosis [27] (Fig. 3).

The forced nuclear accumulation of an exogenous ZO-2 containing three NLS of SV40, leads epithelial and endothelial cells to an augmented proliferative activity and an increased expression of pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK) [28], an enzyme associated with cancer development [29]. These results conflict those obtained with ZO-2 over-expression, where an inhibition of cell proliferation was observed [17,25], and with the over-expression of SRPK1 that triggers nuclear accumulation of ZO-2 and inhibition of cell proliferation [15]. The answer to this puzzle might be that in the nuclear directed ZO-2 experiment no ZO-2 arrived at the plasma membrane, and in consequence an aberrant condition was reached with unstable cell–cell contacts that favored cell proliferation.

ZO-2 isoform C is 23 amino acids shorter at the amino terminus than isoform A [30]. In pancreatic adenocarcinomas [31] and bronchopulmonary carcinomas [32] isoform ZO-2A is absent or diminished, suggesting that the initial 23 amino acids of ZO-2A exert an anti tumorigenic effect. In lung tumor cells, ZO-2 silencing increases the invasive potential and up-regulates the expression of membrane type 1 metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) [32], favoring the idea of ZO-2 as a tumor suppressor that down-regulates the expression of pro-invasive genes (Fig. 3).

Another strategy employed by ZO-2 to inhibit tumor invasion is by shuttling to the nucleus proteins with pro-apoptotic function. In this regard it was observed that the transcriptional co-activator

Fig. 6. Cingulin silencing promotes the expression of claudin 2 and ZO-3 by the activation of RhoA and the transcription of GATA-4. Cingulin silencing (KD) activates the transcription of claudin-2 in a process that requires RhoA activation. In a similar way paracingulin silencing increases claudin-2 mRNA. In contrast, the double KD of cingulin and paracingulin blocked the expression of claudins 2 and 3 and ZO-3 and induced a decrease in the transcription of GATA-4 transcription factor. Cingulin KO mice over-express claudin-2 in kidney and duodenal cells and in mice embryo bodies cingulin KO diminishes the mRNA for JAM-B and induces the transcription of mRNA for GATA-4 and 6, HNF-4α, occludin and claudins 2, 6 and 7. mCl-2, Cl-2 mRNA; mCl-3, Cl-3 mRNA; mCl-6, Cl-6 mRNA; mCl-7, Cl-7 mRNA; mGATA-4, GATA-4 mRNA; mGATA-6, GATA-6 mRNA; mZO-3, ZO-3 mRNA; mJAM-B, JAM-B mRNA.

YAP2 (Yes kinase-associated protein 2) contains a PDZ binding motif at its carboxyl terminal end that is necessary for its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, the stabilization of the pro-apoptotic protein p73 and the promotion of apoptosis in cells grown in medium with 1% serum [33]. Interestingly, ZO-2 through its first PDZ domain forms a complex with YAP2 that facilitates these processes [34], revealing a novel way through which non-junctional ZO-2 exerts anti-tumorigenic activity.

### 4. MAGI-1

The MAGUK protein MAGI-1 is a target of viral oncoproteins with PDZ binding domains. Thus, protein E4-ORF1 of human adenovirus type 9 and protein E6 of high-risk human papillomaviruses, respectively sequester and target MAG1-1 for degradation [35], and MAGI-1 PDZ domains 1 and 5 are targets of the PDZ binding motif ESEV of NS1 protein from avian influenza A viruses [36]. siRNA depletion of MAGI-1, that mimics the disappearance of MAGI-1 from TJ, activates type I interferon (IFN) regulatory factor IRF3 and induces the activation of IFN-β promoter, thus suggesting that MAGI-1 regulates the innate immune response to viral infection [37] (Fig. 4).

### 5. Ubinuclein

Ubinuclein is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein of 160 kDa [38]. Ubinuclein is present at the nuclei of sparse epithelial cells and at the cell borders of confluent cultures where it interacts with the second PDZ domain of ZO-1 and with cingulin [39]. Upon over-expression, ubinuclein localizes at the nucleus and prevents epithelial cells in culture from entering cytokinesis, thus giving rise to multinucleated giant cells [40]. Ubinuclein belongs to the HUCA histone chaperone complex that regulates nucleosome assembly [41]. Ubinuclein interacts with the transcription factors c-Jun and EB1 and competes for their binding to AP-1 sites [38]. EB1 is a leucine zipper transcription factor, product of an early gene of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EB1 interaction with viral and cellular promoters reactivates latent EBV infection.

Hence, in proliferating cells, ubinuclein is nuclear and inhibits the activation of EB1 regulated promoters, while in confluent epithelia, ubinuclein is sequestered at TJs and cannot block the productive cycle of EBV (Fig. 5).

### 6. Symplekin

Symplekin, a 137 kDa component of the polyadenylation machinery that processes 3'-mRNA, is present at the cytoplasmic face of TJs [42]. Symplekin interacts with ZONAB and both cooperate to diminish the activity of ErbB-2 promoter. In addition, symplekin depletion correlates with a reduced transcription of ZONAB target gene CD1 [43] (Fig. 1). In the intestine, nuclear symplekin expression decreases from the proliferative to the differentiated compartment of colonic crypts. This is important since the down-regulation of symplekin/ZONAB complex induces the expression of the transcription factor AML1/Runx1, that increases the expression of KLF4, a transcription factor required for the differentiation of goblet cells in the colon [44]. In addition, in colon cancer cells, symplekin and ZONAB cooperate to down-regulate the expression of claudin-2 mRNA [45].

In hematopoietic cells, symplekin represses the transcription of the homeobox transcription factor HOXA9 by preventing the recruitment of the complex formed by the histone acetyltransferase MOZ and the histone methyltransferase MLL, onto HOXA9 [46].

### 7. Cingulin and paracingulin

Cingulin is a 140 kDa molecule, organized as a parallel homodimer of two subunits, with a globular head domain, a coiled-coil rod and a small globular tail [47]. Paracingulin/JACOP is the paralogue of cingulin [48]. Both cingulin and paracingulin associate to the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton [48,49]. Cingulin concentrates at TJs,

Fig. 7. Marvel proteins occludin and MarvelD3 regulate gene transcription. (a) The absence of occludin induces the transcription of β-catenin and of target genes of the Wnt pathway like c-myc. Instead, occludin over-expression in cancerous cell lines, induces apoptosis by promoting the transcription of caspase-3, bax and apaf-1 and through the inhibition of bcl-2 and survivin. Occludin induces premature senescence by up-regulating the expression of proteins p16INK4A, p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1. (b) MarvelD3 suppresses the JNK pathway by recruiting kinase MEKK1 to TJs. This leads to a diminished transcription of CD1.

and 6, and HNF-4α augmented [55] (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the double KD of cingulin and paracingulin in MDCK cells decreased instead of increased, the expression of ZO-3 and claudins 2 and 3, in a condition where Rho-A activity was high but the level of GATA-4 was reduced [60] (Fig. 6). Hence, suggesting that the Rho-A mediated up-regulation of claudin-2 triggered by cingulin and paracingulin requires a minimal level of expression of GATA-4, and that when both cingulin and paracingulin are absent, this level can no longer be maintained.

Other genes that show very significant up-regulation in EB cingulin KO are four hemoglobin isoforms and various proteins of the coagulation system and acute phase response signaling, while the biggest down-regulation was observed for the genes for NCAM1 and JAM-B, the Rho GTPase activating protein 6, and the PPAR and TGF-β signaling pathways [61].

Different claudins regulate gene expression (Table 1). However, no mechanisms for this process have been so far identified, and in the KO animals it is generally impossible to differentiate between primary and secondary responses like for example those due to altered permeability.

## 9. Marvel proteins

Occludin, tricellulin and marvelD3 are the TJ-associated marvel domain proteins. These proteins have four span transmembrane helices that form a Marvel domain, characteristic of proteins that participate in membrane apposition and fusion events and concentrate in cholesterol rich microdomains [64].

### 9.1. Occludin

Occludin is a 65 kDa protein whose over-expression enhances TER [65,66]. Instead the addition of synthetic peptides homologous to the extracellular loops of occludin [67], as well as the proteolytic cleavage of occludin by MMPs [68], increase paracellular permeability. Occludin KO mice display morphologically intact TJ and chronic inflammation in several epithelia [69], suggesting that the absence of occludin negatively impacts the stability of TJs and leads to the development of leaky epithelia prone to inflammation.

## 8. Claudins

Claudins are four-transmembrane domain proteins that constitute the major structural component of TJs (for review see [62]). Claudins form paracellular barriers and pores that determine the permeability properties of epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudins are expressed in a tissue specific manner and are differentially regulated in cancers of diverse tissue origin (for review see [63]).

Loss of occludin is associated with cancer development and epigenetic silencing by methylation promotes tumorigenic and metastatic properties in cancer cells [70]. The decreased expression of occludin at the TJ, triggered by the addition of occludin loop peptides, induces the transcription of β-catenin and of reporter genes controlled by promoters with TCF/LEF sites, and up-regulates the mRNA level of c-myc [71]. In correspondence, the over-expression of occludin in the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, induces the up-regulation of caspase family genes, and apoptosis inducing genes like apaf-1 and bax, and promotes the down-regulation of apoptosis-inhibitory genes such as bcl-2 and survivin [70]. In addition the forced expression of occludin in breast carcinoma cells induces premature senescence by the up-regulation of negative cell cycle regulators such as p16INK4A, p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 [72] (Fig. 7).

### 9.2. MarvelD3

MarvelD3 is a protein not essential for TJ formation [73] that instead regulates junctional signaling mechanisms. MarvelD3 suppresses the MEKK1-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway by recruiting the kinase MEKK1 to TJs. Since JNK phosphorylates a variety of transcription factors, the sequestration of MEKK1 at the TJ leads to the suppression of JNK-regulated transcriptional mechanisms (i.e. CD1) and a diminished cell proliferation and migration [74] (Fig. 7).

### 9.3. JAM-A

Junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) is a type I integral protein of the TJ of 36 kDa that has a single transmembrane domain, two immunoglobulin (Ig) like loops in the extracellular portion of the molecule and a small cytoplasmic tail that ends with a PDZ binding motif. JAM-A works as a landmark of the sites where TJs will be formed [75] and in accordance is recruited very early to sites of cell-cell contact (for review see [76]).

JAM-A silencing enhances the permeability of epithelial cell lines and JAM-A deficient mice have a leaky colonic epithelium, are more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis and present increased mucosal infiltration of leukocytes and altered levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, in the colonic mucosa of JAM-A KO mice and in colon cancer cell lines treated with a siRNA for JAM-A, an increased expression of claudins 10 and 15 is observed, by a yet undefined mechanism [77].

In summary we can say that TJ adaptor proteins regulate gene expression in a variety of ways: thus, ZO-1 sequesters transcription factors away from the nucleus; ZO-2 associates to transcription factors at the nucleus, blocking gene transcription; ubinuclein inhibits the association of transcription factors to gene promoters and cingulin and paracingulin promote gene transcription in a manner dependent on RhoA activation. Most of the sorting signals employed by the cytoplasmic TJ proteins, to move in and out of the nucleus have only been identified *in silico*, and experimental data are lacking in regard to their actual function and regulation by post translational modifications. In the case of the integral proteins of the TJ, it is observed that that their absence or over-expression changes gene expression, however the mechanisms employed for this regulation remain unknown.
