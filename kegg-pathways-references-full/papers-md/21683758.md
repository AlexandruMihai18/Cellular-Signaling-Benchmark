**ABSTRACT**

H₂O₂ generation by dual oxidase (DUOX) at the apex of thyroid cells is the limiting factor in the oxidation of iodide and the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Its characteristics have been investigated using different in vitro models, from the most physiological thyroid slices to the particulate fraction isolated from transfected DUOX expressing CHO cells. Comparison of the models shows that some positive controls are thyroid specific (TSH) or require the substructure of the in vivo cells (MβCD). Other controls apply to all intact cell models such as the stimulation of the PIP₂ phospholipase C pathway by ATP acting on purinergic receptors, the activation of the Gq protein downstream (NaF), or surrogates of the intracellular signals generated by this cascade (phorbol esters for protein kinase C, Ca²⁺ ionophore for Ca²⁺). Still, other controls, exerted by intracellular Ca²⁺ or its substitute Mn²⁺, the intracellular pH, or arachidonate bear directly on the enzyme. Iodide acts at the apical membrane of the cell through an oxidized form, presumably iodohexadecanal. Cooling of the cells to 22 °C blocks the activation of the PIP₂ phospholipase C cascade. All these effects are reversible. Their kinetics and concentration-effect characteristics have been defined in the four models. A general scheme of the thyroid signaling pathways regulating this metabolism is proposed. The probes characterized could be applied to other H₂O₂ producing cells and to pathological material.

**1. Introduction**

The thyroid gland is composed of follicles with thyrocytes surrounding a lumen. To synthesize thyroid hormones, thyrocytes take up iodide at their basal side and concentrate it into the lumen. They also secrete in this lumen the specialized protein thyroglobulin which serves as a store for the hormones. The first step in the synthesis of thyroid hormones is the oxidation of iodide by thyroperoxidase (TPO) and H₂O₂ and its binding to thyroglobulin tyrosines, to form iodotyrosines. The second step is the oxidative coupling of these iodotyrosines into iodothyronines, thyroxine and triiodothyronine, within thyroglobulin. The thyroid protein iodination and thyroid hormone synthesis system is constituted of H₂O₂ generating enzymes, the dual oxidases 1 and 2 (DUOXes) and an iodide and iodotyrosine oxidation enzyme, TPO. The essential role of the DUOXes is demonstrated by the inhibition of H₂O₂ generation by DUOX1 siRNAs in the rat PCCL3 thyroid cell line (Rigutto et al., 2007). While DUOXes are essentially controlled acutely with little effect of TSH on their expression (Milenkovic et al.,

against this H₂O₂ by selenium deficiency cause thyroid destruction and in human, myxoedematous cretinism (Contempre et al., 1995). The synthesis of H₂O₂ is catalyzed by the dual oxidases, DUOX1 and DUOX2, two thyrocyte apical transmembrane enzymes, using NADPH₂ as coenzyme. Among the NADPH oxidases (NOXes), DUOX1 and DUOX2 are the only ones directly generating H₂O₂ at the outside of the cell instead of producing O₂⁻, mostly inside the cell, as the other NOXes do. The DUOXes are composed of an extracellular NH₂ terminal, a first intracellular domain with two EF hand motifs which bind calcium, six transmembrane segments and a C-terminal intracellular tail containing a heme and the FAD and NADPH₂ binding domains (De Deken et al., 2000). Whereas the DUOXes, contrary to the other NOXes, do not seem to need associated cytosolic factors to be active, they require two transmembrane maturation factors (DUOXA1 for DUOX1, DUOXA2 for DUOX2) to reach the apical membrane, to acquire their active conformation and achieve their final glycosylation status (Grasberger and Refetoff, 2006).

In all species, H₂O₂ generation is stimulated by the two intracellular signals of the Gq-phospholipase C cascade, Ca²⁺ and diacylglycerol. In human and pigs, it is not stimulated by cyclic AMP. In these species, the TSH receptor-Gq-phospholipase C cascade is therefore the main regulatory control exerted (Song et al., 2010a). Iodide, through an iodinated derivative, presumably iodo-hexadecanal (IHDA), both stimulates in a first stage, and then inhibits H₂O₂ generation (Corvilain et al., 1988, 2000) in these species with increasing iodide concentrations.

Our group has studied the control of the two DUOXes at the biochemical level (Rigutto et al., 2009). While human DUOX1 is activated by cAMP through protein kinase A, DUOX2, as human and pig thyrocytes H₂O₂ generation, is not. DUOX2 is extremely sensitive to the activation by phorbol ester (TPA). Strangely, while congenital hypothyroidism due to DUOX2 inactivation has been observed several times, no such defect has been found for DUOX1 although both mRNAs are expressed in the human thyroid (albeit with a lower expression of DUOX1) (Pachucki et al., 2004). In other organs (e.g. aerial and digestive mucosae), DUOX1 or DUOX2 function similarly as defense mechanisms (Fischer, 2009).

In this work we study the regulation of H₂O₂ generation in the thyroid in a near physiological ex vivo model of thyroid slices with direct access to the H₂O₂ producing apical pole of the cell. To distinguish the characteristics conferred to these enzymes by the specialized structure and cell specific properties of the thyrocyte, we have compared this regulation in ex vivo pig and sheep thyroid slices, in a rat thyroid cell line PCCl3, and in CHO cells stably expressing each DUOX enzyme. We also define the experimental systems, the kinetic characteristics of the physiological and pharmacologic probes of the system and the metabolic requirements of H₂O₂ generation and disposal. For clarity and as they are closer to the physiological situation, figures mostly present data on slices.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Reagents

Phorbol myristate ester (TPA), homovanillic acid (HVA), horse radish peroxidase type II (HRP), ionomycin, forskolin, TSH, methyl-β-cyclodextrine, arachidonic acid and superoxide dismutase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Bornem, Belgium). Amplex Ultra Red and H₂O₂ were purchased from Invitrogen (Merelbeke, Belgium). Myeloperoxidase from human polymorphonuclear leukocyte was from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Human TPO was purified from Graves’ thyroid tissue by monoclonal antibody-assisted chromatography as previously reported (Czarnocka et al., 1985).

### 2.2. Cell culture

PCCl3 cells, a rat thyroid cell line, were grown in Coon’s modified Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with 5% decomplemented fetal bovine serum, bovine TSH (1 mU/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), insulin (1 μg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 μg/ml).

CHO cells were stably transfected with either HA-DUOX1/DUOX-A1-myc (CHOD1) or HA-DUOX2/DUOXA2-myc (CHOD2) as described elsewhere (Botteaux et al., 2009). These cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 IU/ml) streptomycin (100 μg/ml), fungizone (2.5 μg/ml) and sodium pyruvate (1 mM). Cells (5 × 10⁵ for PCCl3 cells and 3 × 10⁵ for CHOD1 or CHOD2 cells) were plated in 3.5 cm diameter dishes or wells, 2 days before the experiment.

COS-NIS cells are COS-7 cells transfected with the wild type human sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) cDNA. Stable cell lines were selected by resistance to geneticin, and one clone, COS-NIS 6 with a large capacity to accumulate iodide was selected (Pohlenz et al., 2000).

Pig and sheep thyroids were obtained at the local slaughterhouse. The fresh tissue was sliced at room temperature with a Stadie-Riggs microtome (Arthur Thomas, Philadelphia, PA). Slices (0.3 mm thick) of 50–100 mg wet weight were incubated in 2 ml incubation medium (Corvilain et al., 2000).

### 2.3. Generation of the cellular particulate fractions

Cells plated in 9 cm diameter dishes where rinsed twice with ice cold PBS and scraped into the same solution supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Vilvoorde, Belgium). After centrifuging at 200g for 10 min at 4 °C, the cell pellet was homogenized using a motor driven glass Teflon homogenizer in 2 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM) (pH 7.2) containing EGTA (1 mM), MgCl₂ (2 mM) and the cocktail of protease inhibitors. After centrifuging at 200,000g for 30 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM) (pH 7.2) containing MgCl₂ (2 mM), sucrose (250 mM) and the mixture of protease inhibitors. The suspension was homogenized once again (Ameziane-El-Hassani et al., 2005).

### 2.4. Measurement of the H₂O₂ production

#### 2.4.1. Tissue

Slices were preincubated 1 h in Krebs-Ringer Hepes (KRH) medium supplemented with 8 mM glucose and 0.5 g/l BSA and then transferred to fresh medium containing 0.1 mg/ml HRP, 440 μM HVA and the tested agonists. When H₂O₂ is produced by the tissue, the HVA is oxidized into a fluorescent dimer by the peroxidase. The fluorescence of the medium was measured at 315 and 425 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively (Benard and Brault, 1971). Generation of H₂O₂ was expressed as ng H₂O₂ produced by 100 mg of tissue during the length of the incubation (Corvilain et al., 1991).

#### 2.4.2. Cells

The day of the experiment, the cells were rinsed and preincubated 30 min in KRH medium. The medium was withdrawn and fresh medium containing HVA 440 μM, HRP 0.1 mg/ml, and the agent under study was added. H₂O₂ was measured as explained for tissues (Botteaux et al., 2009).

#### 2.4.3. Particulate fraction

Measurements of H₂O₂ generation by the particulate fraction were carried out as described by the group which has developed

this subject. Samples of the fraction were incubated at 30 °C in 100 μl of sodium phosphate 200 mM, pH 7.2, containing EGTA (1 mM), CaCl₂ (1.5 mM), MgCl₂ (200 μM), sucrose (25 mM), superoxide dismutase (40 U), HRP (25 mU) and Amplex Ultra Red (50 μM). The reaction was started by adding NADPH (100 μM). The Ca²⁺ dependence of H₂O₂ formation was assessed in parallel samples incubated without Ca²⁺ in the presence of 1 mM EGTA. The amount of H₂O₂ in each sample was measured by monitoring the increase in resorufin fluorescence (excitation, 544 nm; emission, 595 nm) during 1 h in a SpectraMax® M5 spectrofluorimeter from Molecular Devices. The activity of DUOXes was calculated using a standard curve ranging from 0.1 to 1 μM H₂O₂ (Amezi-ane-El-Hassani et al., 2005).

The standard curves were always done in a medium similar to the experimental incubation medium (pH, ionic composition, substrates, enzymes, pharmacologic agents, etc.).

### 2.5. Inositol phosphates measurements

#### 2.5.1. Tissue
Slices were preincubated for 4 h at 37 °C in KRH medium containing 40 μCi/ml [³H]-labeled inositol (specific activity 10–20 Ci/mmol, Amersham, Biosciences Benelux, Rosendaal, The Netherlands). Then, the slices were lightly dried on paper and transferred to fresh unlabeled incubation medium. After 15 min, the slices were transferred to a third medium containing LiCl 10 mM. After an additional 5 min, the test agents were added. The following 1 h incubation was stopped by rapid immersion of the slices in 3% ice cold perchloric acid (PCA). After homogenization and centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and prepared to isolate the [³H] inositol phosphates (IPs) by stepwise chromatography on a AG-1-X8 resin (formate form, 100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad, Watford, UK) (Berridge, 1983). The incorporation of [³H] inositol into the total phosphatidylinositides (PI) pool was estimated from the tissue pellet, dissolved in 1 M NaOH and counted as total PI. The amount of [³H] IPs formed was expressed as a percentage of the PI plus IPs pool (Graff et al., 1987).

#### 2.5.2. Cells
After 24 h culture, the medium was replaced by fresh culture medium containing 25 μCi/ml [³H] inositol for 24 h. The cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml KRH medium and preincubated 30 min in KRH medium containing 10 mM LiCl. The medium was then replaced by the same medium containing the agents under study. At the end of the test incubation (15 min for CHO transfected cells and 30 min for PCCl3 cells) the medium was withdrawn and 1 ml 3% cold PCA was added to the cell dishes kept on ice for at least 15 min. The PCA extract was removed carefully without scraping the cells, and processed for stepwise chromatography as the tissues. After 1 rinse, the cells were dissolved in 1 M NaOH and counted as total PI. Results are expressed as for tissue (Raspe et al., 1991).

### 2.6. Iodide organization (PB¹²⁵I)

Thyroid slices were preincubated 1 h in KRH medium, with 8 mM glucose and 0.5 g/l BSA, then transferred to fresh medium supplemented with KI 10 μM and ¹²⁵I (1 μCi/ml) for 30–90 min. Methimazole (0.1 mM) a blocker of iodide organization, added during preincubation and incubation, was used to estimate the background of the method. The slices were then homogenized in a methimazole solution (2 × 10⁻³ M). The proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and counted. Results were expressed as the ratio between trichloroacetic acid precipitable radioactivity and the total radioactivity in the slices, in percentage.

Iodide uptake was evaluated in tissue, by dividing the radioactivity in 100 mg tissue by the radioactivity in 100 μl medium. NaClO₄ 1 mM, a blocker of iodide transport, was used as a control. For cells, the iodide transport was estimated by dividing the radioactivity in the cells by the radioactivity measured in similar dishes incubated with NaClO₄. The uptake in the presence of NaClO₄ is considered as the background of the method (Deleu et al., 2000). This gives a ratio comparable for different preparations of cells independent of the number of cells.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Definition of the model

Thyroid slices have often been used for the study of H₂O₂ generation and iodide binding to proteins. However histological examination of the slices shows two types of structures: open follicles facing the incubation medium on both external faces of the slice and closed intact follicles containing thyroglobulin inside the slice (Neve and Dumont, 1970). The inside closed follicles, but not the open follicles, take up iodide and bind it to thyroglobulin as normal follicles in vivo. On the other hand, given the fact that thyroid cells are extremely well equipped to reduce H₂O₂, we presume that H₂O₂ produced in the closed follicles does not leak out. Thus thyroid slices contain one compartment in which the generated H₂O₂ feeds the normal iodination process as in vivo, and another which generates H₂O₂ in the incubation medium. Both compartments can be investigated separately in the same system, iodination by I¹²⁵ binding to proteins, and the H₂O₂ generation at the apex of the cell by trapping this H₂O₂ as oxidized HVA in the presence of excess HRP (Fig. 1).

Consistent with this concept, H₂O₂ generation by the slices is suppressed by excess medium catalase while iodide binding to thyroglobulin is not affected (Table 1). Similarly, the amount of H₂O₂ produced by very thin or thick pig and sheep thyroid slices of roughly the same size is identical and proportional to the surface but not to the weight of the slices, while iodide binding to protein is grossly proportional to their weight. The percentage of iodide taken up, which is incorporated into proteins, is the same in both types of slices (Table 2). With regard to H₂O₂ generation, the slices model with open follicles is therefore similar to the free open pig thyroid follicles studied by Bjorkman and Ekholm (1984) in which the H₂O₂ generation was demonstrated by cerium perhydroxide precipitation at the apical membrane.

Whereas 20 μM H₂O₂ is completely hydrolyzed by 10 IU/ml of catalase in 30 min in the absence of HRP, in the presence of 100 μg/ml HRP, 33 IU/ml of catalase only slightly decreased the H₂O₂ oxidation of HVA. Thus at the concentration of HRP and HVA generally used, H₂O₂ is more rapidly used in HVA oxidation reaction and thus trapped instead of being reduced by catalase: the H₂O₂ measurement in the slices medium therefore represents the real integral measure of H₂O₂ generation. Consistent with this, the measurement increases linearly with time (Fig. 2).

### 3.2. Control of H₂O₂ generation

#### 3.2.1. Effects of iodide on H₂O₂ generation
We have shown previously (Corvilain et al., 2000) that iodide enhances, after a 1 h preincubation, the generation of H₂O₂ in pig, dog and human thyroids. This effect makes physiological sense in conditions of highly variable iodide supply, as it activates the iodide oxidation system when iodide is present. At higher concentrations iodide inhibits H₂O₂ generation, which is known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect (Corvilain et al., 1988). The effects of iodide in the

For the point without HRP, the tissue was removed at the end of incubation and HVA 4.4 × 10⁻⁴ M and HRP 100 µg/ml were added for 20 min incubation. H₂O₂ is expressed in ng/100 mg tissue.
c After 1 h preincubation, the slices were incubated with radioiodide 1 h ± catalase. PBI (protein bound iodide) is expressed as a percentage of total (TCA precipitable radioactivity in % of total iodide radioactivity in the slices).

open follicles iodide would have a direct access to the system. In this case, iodide transport would no longer be necessary for XI generation, and perchlorate would no longer inhibit XI effect. Indeed in pig thyroid slices, the delayed stimulatory effect of iodide (10 µM) was inhibited by methimazole but not by perchlorate (Fig. 3). Such result also suggests that the presumed XI is not diluted in the medium but remains in the membrane to interact directly with DUOX.

### 3.2.2. Effect of physiological and pharmacological stimulants

In the thyroid of all the investigated species, H₂O₂ generation is stimulated by the Gq-phospholipase C cascade. It is also stimulated by the cAMP-PKA cascade in dog, rat and mouse but not in the other species including humans and pigs (Song et al., 2010a). TSH activates the Gq-PLC cascade in all species studied except dog (Song et al., 2010a). The activation of H₂O₂ generation involves both arms of the Gq cascade, the diacylglycerol-PKC, and the IP₃-Ca²⁺ pathways, as phorbol ester (TPA) and calcium ionophore (ionomycin) reproduce it. Since the ubiquitous purinergic receptors (P₂Y) activate the cascade in most cell types including human thyrocytes (Raspe et al., 1989), ATPγs was also used to probe the system. TPA, ionomycin and ATPγs did not enhance cAMP accumulation. Finally NaF had been proposed as a stimulator of H₂O₂ generation because it also activates the pentose phosphate pathway which feeds the NADPH substrate of DUOX (Dumont, 1971) and was shown to be active in this regard in human thyroid slices (Corvilain et al., 1994).

In the four experimental systems and for TSH in the two thyroid models (pig thyroid slices and the PCCl3 rat thyroid cell line), all these physiological and pharmacological agents enhanced H₂O₂ production. Table 3 gives a general summary of effects of physiological and pharmacological probes in the various models. TSH

5 μM), a direct probe of Gs-adenylyl cyclase, did not activate H₂O₂ generation in pig and human thyroid slices, nor in PCCL3 or CHOD2 cells but it did activate it in CHOD1 cells (Rigutto et al., 2007) and at 10 μM in PCCL3 cells.

ATPγs activated H₂O₂ production in pig slices with an EC50 of 10 μM, in PCCL3 cells with an EC50 of 20 μM, in CHOD1 cells with an EC50 of 2 μM, and in CHOD2 cells with an EC50 of 0.3 μM. In the latter cells, the much higher DUOX expression does not allow the cells to reach the real V_max of the enzyme. It also stimulates the whole cascade in human thyroid primary cultures (Raspe et al., 1989, 1991) and FRTL5 cells (Bjorkman and Ekholm, 1992).

TPA enhanced H₂O₂ generation in pig slices with an EC50 of 0.1 μM, in PCCL3 cells with an EC50 of 10 μM, and in CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells with EC50 of 2 μM and 10 nM, respectively. Similar effects have been observed in pig thyroid cells in culture and in FRTL5 cells (Bjorkman and Ekholm, 1992). As expected, the effect of TPA 5 μM but not that of ionomycin was 90% inhibited by the PKC inhibitor RO 318220 (5 μM) (not shown).

Ionomycin activated H₂O₂ production in pig slices with an EC50 of 0.1 μM, in PCCL3 cells with an EC50 of 0.08 μM and in CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells with EC50 of 0.5 and 0.08 μM, respectively.

NaF enhanced H₂O₂ generation in pig slices with an EC50 of 4 mM, in PCCL3 cells with an EC50 of 5 mM, and in CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells with EC50 of 6 mM. This effect was minimal at 2 mM and maximal at 10 mM. The effects of ionomycin and NaF were qualitatively similar in pig and human thyroid slices (not shown).

Similarly, TSH, ATP, ionomycin, TPA and increased pH 8 enhanced protein iodination in pig and human thyroid slices (not shown) as TSH, ionomycin and TPA do in other species (Song et al., 2010a).

Thus only the TSH response required thyroid cell specificity. The other probes, which test the activation of the Gq–PLC cascade and the direct effects of PKC and Ca²⁺ on the DUOXes (Rigutto et al., 2009), act in all models.

Interestingly, EGF (100 ng/ml) and calf serum (10%) enhanced H₂O₂ generation by pig thyroid slices by 16% (P < 0.05) and 36% (P < 0.05), respectively, while insulin 10 μg/ml had no effect (not shown). Such effects might reflect a spillover of H₂O₂ generated intracellularly by an activated NOX4 (Weyemi et al., 2010).

In pig thyroid slices, the kinetics of basal H₂O₂ generation were quasi linear for 2 h and the effects of ionomycin (1 μM), TPA (5 μM) and TSH (10 mU/ml) were constant from 30 to 120 min. The effect of NaF 10 mM reached its steady state only after 30 min (Fig. 2). Similar kinetics were obtained in PCCL3 and in CHOD1 cells in which the effects of ionomycin, TSH and ATPγs were constant for 2h while the full effect of NaF was delayed.

On the other hand when slices incubated with the stimulatory agent for one hour were reincubated without stimulant for various times up to 2 h, the rate of H₂O₂ generation remained steady for 1 h for NaF 10 mM, decreased over 1 h for TPA 5 μM, disappeared rapidly for ionomycin 1 μM and immediately for ATPγs and TSH. Similar results were obtained in PCCl3 cells. However in CHOD1 cells the TPA effect persisted for 30 min, and that of NaF for 15 min, while the effects of both ATPγs and ionomycin disappeared after cell washing. These results are compatible with an intracellular action of NaF and TPA, and the known extracellular action on receptors of TSH and ATPγs (Table 4). For comparison the half-life of cAMP after the cutoff of TSH stimulation by trypsin treatment is less than 10 min in dog thyroid slices (Van Sande et al., 1977).

### 3.2.3. Mechanism of NaF action

NaF has been used as an activator of the H₂O₂ generating system on the basis of its stimulatory effect of the pentose phosphate pathway (Dumont, 1971). Indeed it greatly activates this generation in the four experimental models used. However, its mechanism of action was unknown.

One hypothesis is that NaF could act directly or indirectly on the H₂O₂ generating system by inhibiting serine-threonine protein phosphatases. However inhibition of these phosphatases by okadaic acid 1 μM barely stimulated the generation of H₂O₂ in pig thyroid slices and inhibited it in CHOD1, CHOD2 and PCCl3 cells (not shown). A direct effect of NaF on DUOX in particulate preparations was not observed (0.1–10 mM) (not shown).

NaF also inhibits glycolysis and some depending functional variables of thyroid cells such as secretion (Willems et al., 1972). The transport of iodide, which also depends on glycolysis, was barely reduced at 4 mM and reduced by 50% at 10 mM (not shown).

NaF has often been used as a stimulant of the protein Gs (Gilman, 1987). The anion would fill the space of the 3rd phosphate of GTP in GDP and convert the inactive GDP into an active GDP-F form. It could play a similar role in Gq. Indeed in all four experimental models, pig slices, PCCl3, CHOD1 and CHOD2, NaF enhanced H₂O₂ and IP generation with similar concentration action relations. The first effective NaF concentration is 4 mM and a larger, often maximal, effect is obtained at 10 mM. Fluoride indeed raises steadily intracellular Ca²⁺ levels as well as inositol phosphates in dog thyroid cells (Graff et al., 1987; Raspe et al., 1986). Thus NaF is a good probe of the Gq-PLC pathway, presumably at the level of Gq.

### 3.3. Metabolic properties of the system

In thyroid acellular systems, DUOX, as a NADPH₂ dependent thyroid oxidase, uses NADPH₂ as a substrate, the resulting NADP⁺ being reduced by the pentose phosphate pathway. Similarly, it has been assumed that extracellular H₂O₂ leaking into the cell would be reduced by glutathione peroxidase, the oxidized GSSG being reduced by NADPH₂ and glutathione reductase, and the NADP⁺ by the pentose phosphate pathway. These two mechanisms could explain the important activation of the pathway by TSH (Dumont, 1971).

#### 3.3.1. Generation of H₂O₂

The generation of H₂O₂ by pig thyroid slices was measured in the presence and absence of glucose, after a preincubation of 1 h, during an incubation of 30–60 min. Without glucose, the spontaneous release of H₂O₂ was depressed by 50–80% while the activation by TSH, TPA, ionomycin and NaF was almost suppressed (Fig. 4). Similar effects, albeit weaker, were obtained with human thyroid slices (not shown). In both human and pig slices 1 mM glucose was sufficient for maximal H₂O₂ generation. In CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells basal H₂O₂ was increased from no glucose to glucose 0.4 mM, but little increased over 0.4 mM. However, the stimulatory effects of TPA, ionomycin, NaF and ATPγs were reduced without glucose. Clearly higher levels of stimulation required higher glucose concentrations to achieve a maximal effect. Glucose depletion did not reduce basal or ATPγs stimulated H₂O₂ generation by PCCl3 cells which raises the question of the source of NADPH₂ in these cells (not shown). Thus the reliance on extracellular glucose for H₂O₂ generation is important for physiological but less so, for model systems.

#### 3.3.2. O₂ requirements of DUOX

The two substrates of the DUOXes are NADPH₂ and O₂. All the experiments carried out on H₂O₂ generation are carried out in an atmosphere of air, i.e. at 20% oxygen. However the O₂ partial pressure in which the system operates in vivo may vary much. While in most tissues, including the thyroid, the partial pressure of O₂ would be between 4% and 10% of the atmosphere, DUOX1 in the airway is exposed to an atmosphere of air, i.e. 20% O₂, while DUOX2 in the anaerobic colon mucosa probably encounters much lower O₂ levels. It was therefore of interest to test the O₂ requirements of both isoenzymes. We tested H₂O₂ steady state generation under condition of 2% vs 20% O₂, adding HRP and HVA after an incubation period of 30 or 45 min, i.e. at a time when we could expect that the media were fully equilibrated with the atmosphere. Under these conditions, basal steady state H₂O₂ concentration in the medium was 22 ± 1 ng/dish in 2% O₂ and 43 ± 1 ng/dish in 20% O₂ for CHOD1 cells and 400 ± 5 vs 470 ± 20 ng/dish for CHOD2 cells. Interestingly the cells stimulated with TPA 5 μM, gave identical results at both O₂ concentrations: 104 ± 2 and 111 ± 3 ng/dish for CHOD1 cells, 1480 ± 25 and 1343 ± 30 ng/dish for CHOD2 cells.

Fig. 4. Effect of glucose deprived medium on H₂O₂ production by pig thyroid slices. The preincubation ± glucose lasted 1 h. The incubation ± glucose and the test agents lasted 1 h. Iono: ionomycin; KRH α glucose: KRH without glucose.

Similar results were obtained in six experiments while in two experiments there was no decrease in H₂O₂ generation for either CHOD1 or CHOD2 at 2% O₂. The effects of 2% O₂ were not observed at 4% O₂. Thus DUOX1 which is exposed in the trachea to high O₂ has a higher Km and lower affinity for O₂ than DUOX2 which is expressed in the colon while the V_max of the enzymes are similar at both O₂ concentrations.

### 3.3.3. Disposal of H₂O₂

When stimulated, the thyrocyte generates as much H₂O₂ per cell as an activated polynuclear leukocyte (Song et al., 2007). However, whereas an activated leukocyte survives a few hours, the adult human thyrocyte lives around 7 years (Coclet et al., 1989). The thyrocyte must therefore be well equipped to detoxify H₂O₂.

A first defense is certainly the consumption of H₂O₂ during the TPO oxidation of iodide. However, we showed previously (Corvilain et al., 1991) that H₂O₂ is generated at almost two orders of magnitude higher levels than the amounts used for iodide oxidation. A first hypothesis was therefore that TPO could, even in the absence of iodide substrate, degrade H₂O₂. Horse radish peroxidase has both peroxidase and catalase activities but while the first was maximal at 30 μM H₂O₂, the EC50 of the other was 600 μM (not shown). Purified human TPO (40 μg/ml) has a very slight catalase effect in the absence of iodide (25% H₂O₂ degraded in 90 min for a concentration of 10 μM H₂O₂). Human myeloperoxidase, in the same conditions, degraded 95% of the H₂O₂. The effect of TPO on H₂O₂ degradation is negligible when compared with the degradation in the presence of iodide (99%). A high degradation of H₂O₂ by pig TPO in the presence of iodide has been previously demonstrated (Magnusson and Taurog, 1983). Thus purified TPO has a negligible catalase-like activity.

In short incubations and even in the presence of low concentrations of HRP (to minimize the sequestering effect of HRP–HVA), methimazole 0.1 mM, a potent peroxidase inhibitor, did not increase the generation of H₂O₂ by pig thyroid slices. This suggests that in open follicles, when not functioning as a peroxidase, TPO had no significant catalase-like effect. Consumption of H₂O₂ by TPO in the presence of iodide or KSCN could be expected to decrease net H₂O₂ generation. However, acute decreasing effect (30 min) of KI 10 and 100 μM, or SCN⁻ 100 μM, as substrates of TPO in the presence of 10 μg/ml HRP (i.e., a non-sequestrating level of the enzyme) on H₂O₂ generation by pig thyroid slices were not significant (not shown). Their effect was obviously masked by the rapid free diffusion of H₂O₂ from the open follicles out of membrane TPO’s reach.

Peroxisomes, the repository of catalase, have been demonstrated in thyroid cells (Tice, 1974). NaN₃ is the most used inhibitor of catalase. It does not inhibit H₂O₂ generation by pig thyroid slices, CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells until a concentration of 1 mM. Its EC50 for catalase is 33 μM. The half-life of H₂O₂ added to pig thyroid slices is of 8 min in the presence of NaN₃ 33 μM and 2.5 min without it, i.e., an inhibition of 70%.

H₂O₂ degradation by pig or human thyroid slices was partially (20–30%) increased by the presence of glucose (8 mM) in the medium (Fig. 5). For pig thyroid slices, a preincubation of 4 h in the presence of BSO 200 μM, which depletes intracellular GSH (Driesens et al., 2009), did not enhance H₂O₂ generation. Thus, at high concentrations of H₂O₂, a large part of the H₂O₂ degradation by pig thyroid slices is carried out by cell catalase rather than by glutathione and the pentose phosphate pathway.

Degradation of added H₂O₂ by PCCl3 cells was slow (t½ = 7 min) and was only marginally slowed down by NaN₃ 33 μM. With CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells, the half-life was 12 min, marginally increased by glucose depletion but extended to 18 min by NaN₃ 100 μM. Thus, in all models, the major degradation pathway of a rather high concentration of exogenous H₂O₂ is catalase.

The incubation ± glucose, with H₂O₂ (2 × 10⁻⁵ M), and NaN₃ (33 μM) lasted 5, 10, or 30 min. The slices were then pulled out of the medium and HVA + HRP were added to assay the amount of H₂O₂ left undegraded. □: control; ■: NaN₃ 33 μM.

### 3.4. Physicochemical conditions of H₂O₂ generation

#### 3.4.1. Temperature and membrane fluidity

The DUOX enzymes are thyroid apical membrane proteins. They are incompletely glycosylated and inactive until they have reached this location. There are indications that the whole protein iodination apparatus, including DUOXes and TPO, are located in the membrane of microvillae and that these membranes contain rafts and caveolae. One might therefore wonder about the role of membrane structure on DUOX activity (Song et al., 2007). In a previous publication, we had shown in intact cells that some apical membrane functions such as macropinocytosis and protein iodination as well as activation of adenylate cyclase at the basal membrane by cholera toxin, which requires prior endocytosis, were obliterated at 22 °C while other functions such as iodide transport or TSH activation of adenylate cyclase via its receptor were not (Van Sande et al., 1979).

In COS-NIS and PCCl3 cells, iodide transport is not decreased at 21 °C (not shown). In acellular systems, the shift from 37 to 22 °C decreases H₂O₂ generation by 10% (not significant). Measurements of H₂O₂ generation by thyroid particulate fractions are routinely made at 20 °C (Michot et al., 1985) which bears against the hypothesis of an important direct effect of lower temperature on DUOXes themselves. In pig and dog thyroid slices, basal H₂O₂ generation on the whole was not greatly affected by the decrease in temperature (sometimes moderately increased or decreased). On the other hand, the stimulatory effects of TSH and TPA were greatly decreased and those of NaF were almost suppressed while the effects of ionomycin were decreased (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained for iodination. In pig slices, the TSH effect on cAMP accumulation was not modified (not shown). In PCCl3, CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells, the basal generation of H₂O₂ was decreased by 50%. As in the slices, the effect of NaF was suppressed while those of ionomycin and TPA were decreased. In PCCl3 cells, the effect of TSH and ATPγs were decreased while the effect of NaF was suppressed (not shown). Thus, lowering the temperature in thyroid cells did not greatly modify the basal activity of the H₂O₂ generating system but it greatly influenced its control. Indeed, IP generation in response to NaF was obliterated at 22 °C in PCCl3 cells. Consonant with this, in pig thyroid slices, the effects of TSH and ATPγs on H₂O₂ generation shut down immediately when the slices were brought to 22 °C (not shown). This suggests that stimulation of H₂O₂ generation requires the constant activation of the Gq-PLC cascade.

#### 3.4.2. Effects of membrane structure

Human and dog thyrocytes plasma membrane have been shown to contain lipid rafts or detergent-resistant membrane frag-

presence of EGTA 0.1 mM completely suppressed basal H₂O₂ generation, and H₂O₂ generation stimulated by TSH, fluoride, ionomycin and increased pH 8 (not shown). In pig thyroid slices, a preincubation and an incubation without Ca²⁺ are required to observe an almost complete inhibition (Fig. 8). This delay is compatible with the accepted model according to which the effect of Ca²⁺ bears on the intracellular EF hands of DUOX rather than on the extracellular part of the enzymes. A smaller but similar effect is observed in slices incubated 45 min in the absence of Ca²⁺ (Fig. 9). Thus in intact cells also, DUOX activity is strictly dependent on intracellular calcium. Interestingly, in CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells, Mn²⁺ (1.45 mM) alone, in the absence of Ca²⁺, had a stronger stimulatory effect than Ca²⁺ 1.45 mM on H₂O₂ generation, suggesting a direct effect on the enzyme (CHOD1: no Ca²⁺ 85 ± 10, Ca²⁺ 297 ± 10, Mn²⁺ 351 ± 8) (CHOD2: no Ca²⁺ 366 ± 7, Ca²⁺ 1277 ± 30, Mn²⁺ 1910 ± 14) (ng per dish).

### 3.4.4. Effect of CO₂ and pH

According to the accepted schemes of NOX-DUOX functioning, the generation of O₂⁻ at the outside of the membrane is linked to the oxidation of NADPH₂ and the release of one H⁺ inside the cell (Fischer, 2009). For DUOX, this would imply that the reaction should be decreased by intracellular acidification and enhanced by alcalinization. Indeed, raising the pH of the Hepes buffer in the incubation medium or incubation with bicarbonate buffer without CO₂ atmosphere, increases H₂O₂ generation in pig and sheep thyroid slices, in PCCl3, CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells.

### 3.4.3. Ionic requirements: calcium

DUOX enzymes contain two intracellular EF hands. In acellular particulate systems their activity is strictly dependent on the presence of Ca²⁺ (Deme et al., 1985). In the four experimental systems used, prolonged incubation (2 h) in the absence of Ca²⁺ and in the

After 1 h preincubation in normal KRH medium (Ca²⁺: 1.45 mM), the slices were incubated 45 min in a medium without added Ca²⁺, ± an agonist (TSH: 10 mU/ml; TPA: 5 μM; Arach.: arachidonic acid 50 μg/ml). Effect of fluoride and pH 8 studied in other experiments were also suppressed in the absence of Ca²⁺ (not shown).

![Figure 10](#fig-10)

Fig. 10. Effect of pH and CO₂ on H₂O₂ production by pig thyroid slices. The various media used are KRB medium at pH 7.4 under an atmosphere of 95% O₂–5% CO₂; KRH medium at pH 7.4 air atmosphere; KRB medium pH 8 air atmosphere and KRH medium pH 8 air atmosphere. These media were present during the 30 min preincubation and the 1 h incubation during which H₂O₂ produced was measured.

While CO₂ diffuses easily across membranes, HCO₃⁻ has to be pumped out (Cordat and Casey, 2009). In a 5% CO₂ atmosphere, always used with the NaHCO₃ buffer at pH 7.4, CO₂ which freely diffuses in the cell would acidify the intracellular pH contrary to extracellular NaHCO₃. It greatly decreases H₂O₂ generation whereas NaHCO₃ or Hepes at pH 8 enhance it (Fig. 10). For a similar extracellular pH, with NaHCO₃ buffer and 5% CO₂ atmosphere, the internal cell pH is markedly lower than with a Hepes buffer and air atmosphere (Kimelberg and Walz, 1988).

NH₄Cl, with NH₃ as the diffusing molecule, has a transient stimulatory effect on H₂O₂ generation by pig slices (156 ± 6 vs 112 ± 7 ng/100 mg). A similar enhancement by NH₄Cl of iodide binding to proteins in dog thyroid slices had been observed (Unger et al., 1985). In all the models, the effects of NaF, TPA and ionomycin and in thyroid cells (pig, PCCl3), the effects of TSH, were qualitatively conserved at pH 8 (not shown).

### 3.4.5. Effect of hyperosmolarity

Hyperosmolarity, whether caused by addition of sucrose (150, 250 mM) or NaCl (50–150 mM), maximally stimulated H₂O₂ generation in PCCl3 cells and pig slices (Fig. 11). No supplementary effect of the usual stimulants (TSH, TPA, ionomycin, …) was observed (not shown). The effect was abolished in a medium deprived of Ca²⁺ with EGTA 0.1 mM. No effect on IP generation was observed (not shown). The effect was reversible. Indeed, after a 45 min incubation in normal medium, basal H₂O₂ level was back to normal.

![Figure 11](#fig-11)

Particulate fractions were incubated with (▲ and ●) or without (△ and ○) arachidonic acid (50 μg/ml) and H₂O₂ production was recorded over 1 h.

#### 3.4.6. Effect of arachidonate

It has been reported that arachidonate directly stimulates some NOX enzymes (Seifert and Schultz, 1987). When tested on our models, arachidonate enhanced H₂O₂ generation in pig thyroid slices, PCCl3, CHOD1 but not CHOD2 cells (Fig. 6). This stimulatory effect was not inhibited by EGTA nor by cooling at 22 °C (Figs. 6 and 9). It therefore does not result from an activation of either the Gq–PLC cascade or a Ca²⁺ channel. This is compatible with a direct effect on the enzymes. Indeed arachidonate greatly stimulates the generation of H₂O₂ by the particulate fraction of CHOD1 cells while that of CHOD2 cells is slightly inhibited (Fig. 12).

4. Discussion

Specialized functional systems are studied in a variety of experimental models: from the more physiological to the purest and more simplified: in vivo in intact humans or animals, in vitro in organ slices, in cultured cells, in enzyme expressing cell lines and in subcellular or enzyme preparations (Dumont et al., 2002). The slice model has been defined operationally (Fig. 1) with open follicles providing a direct access to intact thyrocyte apical border and iodination taking place in the closed follicles, which at 20 μM iodide in the medium is limited by H₂O₂ generation. A perfect parallelism in kinetics and concentration effect curves of various stimulants on H₂O₂ generation, iodide organization and pentose phosphate pathway activity had been previously observed in dog thyroid slices (Corvilain et al., 1991).

Thyroid cell primary cultures on filters are an alternative model. The cells are polarized and have been used for the study of iodide transport (Nilsson et al., 1990) and thyroglobulin endocytosis (van den Hove et al., 2007). They are simpler and also close to the physiological in vivo model but they are reconstituted in vitro rather than kept in their original structure and they lack the internal more physiological control of iodination in closed follicles that the slices offer.

The mechanisms of the control of H₂O₂ generation have been studied using various in vitro experimental models. We shall discuss the implications of the results first for thyroid cell biology, then for the DUOX system itself. The results are synthesized in a general model (Fig. 13).

The properties of the slices have allowed to answer a first question: the location in the cell of the iodine derivative which exerts direct effects on the thyroid cells, such as the inhibition of TSH signal transduction pathways and in some species a direct activation of H₂O₂ generation. The latter effect links the generation of H₂O₂ to the supply of the substrate of the system, iodide. Most of the effects of iodide are inhibited by drugs that block its uptake (e.g. perchlorate) and by drugs that inhibit its oxidation by TPO (e.g. methimazole) which led to the concept that these effects are mediated by an intrafollicular oxidized derivative of iodide XI (Van Sande et al., 1975). A search for XI has demonstrated two iodinated lipids: iodohexadecanol and iodolactone (Panneels et al., 2009). The former regulates H₂O₂ generation and iodide oxidation in particulate preparations (Ohayon et al., 1994). The cellular location of XI is unknown. The demonstration here that one effect of XI, i.e. the activation of H₂O₂ generation in open follicles is inhibited by a thyroperoxidase inhibitor (methimazole) but not by perchlorate shows that in an open system, iodide does not need any more to penetrate the thyroid cell to generate XI, thus suggests that this generation takes place at the apical border of the cell. The persistence of the effect shows that the intermediate HDA is not diluted in the medium, i.e. that consonant with its lipid character (Panneels et al., 1994a,b), it remains in the membrane as suggested before (Van Sande et al., 1985). Indeed, no effect of the medium of slices incubated with iodide had been previously observed on fresh dog thyroid slices incubated in that medium + methimazole (Van Sande et al., 1985).

The presence and role of two DUOXes in the human thyroid remains mysterious as the only congenital defect of the system leading to hypothyroidism involves DUOX2 (Ris-Stalpers, 2006) and while DUOX1 but not DUOX2 is activated by the cAMP–PKA pathway (Rigutto et al., 2009), H₂O₂ generation by human and pig thyroid slices is not. This suggests a silencing of DUOX1 in pig as in human thyroid (Rigutto et al., 2009). Different tissues localizations of DUOX1 and DUOX2 could reflect different operational conditions and roles. While DUOX1 in tracheal mucosa is exposed to 20% O₂, DUOX2 in the intestinal mucosa must be exposed to much lower O₂ concentrations. This fits well with the lower efficiency of DUOX1 but not DUOX2 at 2% O₂. Certainly the expression of DUOX2 in the relatively poorly oxygenated fetal thyroid would make sense.

TSH and other thyroid activating agents have been shown long ago to activate the pentose phosphate pathway in the thyroid. As the activity of this pathway is regulated by the oxidation of its

product NADPH₂ and as the coenzyme of DUOXes is NADPH₂, it had been postulated that glucose metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway is regulated by the rate of NADPH₂ oxidation by the DUOXes (Dumont, 1971). If this hypothesis is correct, H₂O₂ generation should be dependent on the supply of glucose. Indeed, in pig and human thyroid slices H₂O₂ is decreased by 80% in the absence of glucose in the medium. This effect is lower in CHO and absent in PCCL3 cells, i.e. in non physiological models.

Protection of the cell and its DNA against H₂O₂ is crucial for the long term survival of the thyrocyte (7 years) (Coclet et al., 1989). Insufficiency of this protection has been proposed as the cause for the high prevalence of thyroid nodules (Krohn et al., 2007; Le- dent et al., 1997; Song et al., 2007). Intracellular H₂O₂ is reduced both by catalase and glutathione peroxidase. The latter pathway involves the oxidation of glutathione, itself reduced by the NADPH₂ generated by the pentose phosphate pathway. We had hypothesized (Dumont, 1971) that the latter pathway was predominant. High concentrations of H₂O₂ (0.2 mM) increase glucose oxidation by the pentose phosphate pathway in dog thyroid slices (Corvilain et al., 1991). However, at rather high levels of added H₂O₂ in pig and human slices, deprivation of glucose interfered much less with H₂O₂ disposal than the addition of NaN₃ a catalase inhibitor. The slow disposal of added H₂O₂ in cell lines is also mostly accounted for by catalase. Thus catalase represents the most efficient protector of the thyroid cell in the presence of high level of H₂O₂. Peroxisomes, which contain catalase, have indeed been demonstrated in thyroid cells (Tice, 1974). Previous work on pig thyroid cells in culture, arrived at the same conclusion but showed that at low levels of H₂O₂ the GSH peroxidase system plays the major role (Bjorkman and Ekholm, 1995). Defective GSH peroxidase explains the role of selenium deficiency in the thyroid destruction of endemic cretins (Contempre et al., 1995). Thus glucose metabolism may be important for defense against H₂O₂, but the fraction of this metabolism accounted for by disposal of H₂O₂ is much lower than the fraction used for its generation.

As in the absence of iodide, H₂O₂ has deleterious effects on cells, we postulated that TPO, which we know is associated to active DUOXes in the plasma membrane (Song et al., 2010b), might consume H₂O₂ even in the absence of iodide, i.e. have a catalase like effect. However purified TPO, contrary to myeloperoxidase, has no such effect. On the other hand, as expected, in the presence of iodide, TPO indeed consumed H₂O₂. Contrary to the NOX systems, the DUOX system in thyroid cells, as in transfected cells, generates H₂O₂ in the absence of any stimulating agent. While such a constitutive H₂O₂ generation might make physiological sense for mucosa keeping bacteria at bay (Botteaux et al., 2009), its role in thyroid follicles deprived of iodide is less evident. Of course the stimulation of the system by iodide in some species offers a partial response to that question. Contrary to our expectations we found no evidence that the system is protected by a catalase like activity of TPO, which only consumes H₂O₂ in the presence of iodide. Of course, in vivo, even in the absence of iodide in the diet, there is always supply of iodide from the recirculation of the iodide derived in the thyrocytes from deiodinated iodothyrosines released by thyroglobulin hydrolysis, and, from the recirculation of iodide released by thyroid hormone deiodination in other organs which is not lost in the urine.

The effects of extracellular signals on target cells reflect their mechanism of action and the differentiation characteristics of the target cells. In this work, we have compared the thyroid H₂O₂ generation in thyroid slices, in PCCL3 cells, the available thyroid cell line closest to physiology (Kimura et al., 2001), in DUOX1 and DUOX2 expressing CHO cells and in particulates prepared from thyroid tissue or CHO stably transfected cells. The first model conserves the tissue structure of the in vivo thyroid, the second has lost this structure but conserves to a large extent its thyrocyte differentiation, and the third has no thyroid character besides the expression of DUOX1 or DUOX2 at its plasma membrane. The comparison should allow to distinguish intrinsic properties of the enzyme vs properties conferred by thyroid differentiation and/or structure (Table 5). It defines (1) properties linked to the structure and polarity of the cells such as the mechanism of action of iodide and the raft dissolving effects of βMCD, (2) effects linked to cell differentiation such as the effect of TSH, (3) general effects on signal transduction such as those of ATPγs, fluoride, hyperosmolarity and cooling at 22 °C, and (4) presumably direct effects on the H₂O₂ generating system, the “thyroxosome”, such as the effects of pH, calcium, manganese and arachidonate (Table 3). The direct ubiquitous targets of the Gq–PLC cascade and its Ca²⁺ and diacylglycerol intracellular signals, are activated in all cell types by their respective agonists ATP, TPA and Ca²⁺ ionophore. In conclusion, with regard to the thyroid, the only specific properties of the physiologically structured thyrocytes in slices are the activation of H₂O₂ generation by MβCD and by iodide at the level of the apical membrane. The former suggests that DUOXes sequestered in the lipid rafts of this highly structured membrane, are inactive.

The pharmacological stimulants act with no significant delay and continuously over 2 h in all models. As shown before for TSH (Van Sande et al., 1977), after washing of the cells, the effect of extracellular stimulants, TSH and ATP, disappeared rapidly demonstrating immediate on/off signaling. On the other hand, the effect of TPA or ionomycin persisted for some time, consistent with their intracellular action (Table 4).

NaF activated H₂O₂ generation in all models. The effect was delayed and prolonged after washing of the cells, which suggests an intracellular action. In fact, NaF activated the Gq-phospholipase C cascade in all models and the concentration effect relations for intracellular IP and extracellular H₂O₂ generation were parallel. The effect is not a direct effect on DUOXes as it is not observed on the particulate enzyme. Thus fluoride is a useful intracellular activator of the whole Gq–PLC cascade. This ion has been used extensively in acellular systems to activate Gs and consequently adenylate cyclase (Gilman, 1987). Its effect has been ascribed to the filling in Gs-GDP of the hole of the third phosphate group of Gs-GTP. Presumably the same mechanism applies to Gq. NaF can therefore be a useful general extracellular activator of the Gq–PLC cascade.

Both DUOXes contain EF hands in their first intracellular loop. Moreover Ca²⁺ is required for the activity of the particulate enzyme (Deme et al., 1985). Similarly, in the four models, Ca²⁺ was shown to be absolutely required for enzyme activity and to modulate it up to maximal levels, whatever the stimulus applied. The length of time required to achieve maximal inhibition of H₂O₂ generation after Ca²⁺ suppression, was longer for slices, showing that intracellular and not extracellular Ca²⁺ was required. This delay probably depends on the level of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores in the different models. This general modulation by intracellular Ca²⁺ is therefore a general property of the DUOX system itself.

DUOXes are membranes enzymes and as such their activity might be dependent on membrane structure. We had previously shown that incubation at 22 °C inhibits several membrane parameters

eters in thyroid cells such as TSH induced endocytosis of thyroglobulin which was ascribed to membrane phase transition ([Van Sande et al., 1978]). In fact neither basal H₂O₂ generation in the four model cell models used, nor enzyme activity of the particulate enzymes were inhibited at 22 °C. On the other hand, cooling to 22 °C immediately and completely abolished stimulated H₂O₂ and IP generation in the four models and for all the extracellular stimuli used. The suppression of PLC cascade activation by NaF or hormones at 22 °C would rather bear on phospholipase C than on G protein activation as adenylate cyclase activation by TSH, cholera toxin and NaF in thyroid homogenate is not suppressed at 20 °C (Van Sande et al., 1979). Thus cooling at 22 °C is a useful and innocuous experimental tool to shut off the activation of the Gq–PLC cascade.

Methyl-β-cyclodextrin which traps membrane cholesterol and disrupts lipid rafts had a strong stimulatory effect on H₂O₂ generation by the structured normal thyrocytes of slices but not in the PCCL3, CHOD1 and CHOD2 cells. It has no stimulatory effect on IP generation. In caveolin KO mice disruption of caveolae in the thyrocyte apical membrane, also leads to higher H₂O₂ generation (Sénotou et al., 2009). This suggests that, as previously proposed, part of the apical membrane DUOXes in the thyrocyte are sequestered and inactivated in lipid rafts (Song et al., 2007).

The present concept of H₂O₂ generation by NOXes, whether inside secondary lysosome or out of the cell, involves the prior generation of O₂⁻ which is then converted to H₂O₂. This implies that the 2 hydrogens of NADPH₂ generate H⁺ inside the cells (and therefore acidification) and O₂⁻ outside (Segal, 2008). The DUOXes on the contrary directly generate H₂O₂. In fact only immature forms of DUOXes, either inside the cells (Ameziane-El-Hassani et al., 2005) or after reaching the plasma membrane with the wrong chaperone (e.g. DUOXA1 for DUOX2) generate O₂⁻ (Morand et al., 2009; Zamproni et al., 2008). There is therefore a question mark whether the electrical gradient generated by the NOXes also exist for the DUOXes. Indeed acidification of the intracellular medium, through CO₂ diffusion, or through extracellular pH, nearly abolishes H₂O₂ generation while alcalinization enhances it. This suggests that DUOXes indeed generate exterior O₂⁻ as an intermediate stage but immediately reduce it. This would explain why superoxide dismutase barely inhibits H₂O₂ generation in particulate systems or in slices (Virion et al., 1984). The extracellular NH₃ terminal of DUOXes, homologous to thyroperoxidase could play this dismutase role.

The action of intracellular H⁺ explains the effect of NH₄Cl, of high extracellular pH and the lower H₂O₂ generation in cells incubated with bicarbonate buffer and 5% CO₂ vs Hepes buffer at the same extracellular pH. This suggests that the thyroid cells, as leukocytes and macrophages, require a mechanism to neutralize the effect of DUOX activity on intracellular pH and that defects in this neutralization could give rise to iodination defects (Fischer, 2009). The effect of intracellular pH and of H⁺ generation in the cell, as in the case of the NOX systems, is exhibited in the four experimental models and would therefore be a property of the DUOXes themselves.

Arachidonate activates H₂O₂ generation in the four models. As it is not inhibited by EGTA, the effect does not result from activation of the Gq–PLC cascade. Arachidonate stimulates DUOX1 in particulates of CHOD1 cells. It could therefore be a direct probe of the DUOX1 enzyme itself, in models in which the enzyme is exposed, such as slices open follicles and cells in culture. This suggests that DUOX1, even if not necessary, is capable to contribute to thyroid H₂O₂ generation.

On the basis of the results presented in this article we propose a mechanistic scheme of the control of H₂O₂ generation and thyroid hormone synthesis by the thyrocyte that could be useful in interpreting the physiopathology of the organ and provide tools for

the investigation, in near physiological conditions, of the thyroid hormone synthesizing machinery (Fig. 13).

With regard to H₂O₂ generation, interesting pharmacological, not cell specific, tools allowing to reversibly modulate the signal transduction cascade controlling H₂O₂ generation have been demonstrated: some activating the Gq–PLC cascade directly (NaF) or through an ubiquitous receptor (ATP), one inhibiting it (cooling), some mimicking the downstream effects of this cascade (ionomycin, phorbol esters), some acting on the intracellular pH (alkaline pH, hyperosmolarity) and some acting presumably on the apical membrane (MβCD) or directly on the enzymes (arachidionate). It would be interesting to apply these tools and concepts to other tissues such as the aerial and digestive mucosae where the DUOXes operate, and even to other NOXes.
