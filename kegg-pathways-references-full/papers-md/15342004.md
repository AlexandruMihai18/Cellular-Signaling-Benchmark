The complement system in prion diseases

Neil A Mabbott

The complement system is an essential component of the innate immune system that aids the recognition and destruction of pathogens. Despite the potent cytolytic activity of this system, some pathogens have turned interactions with complement to their advantage. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, also seem to use the complement system to facilitate target cell infection in lymphoid tissues. TSEs are associated with the accumulation of disease-specific prion protein in the brain, which is accompanied by progressive neurodegeneration. Unregulated activation of complement can cause host tissue damage, as observed in some neurodegenerative disorders, and active complement components have been detected in the brains of hosts with TSEs. Whether complement inhibitors will be useful to treat TSEs remains to be determined.

Introduction

The complement system, comprising at least 30 soluble and cellular proteins, provides an innate immune defence mechanism against pathogenic microorganisms [1,2]. Various characteristic molecular patterns on pathogens including carbohydrates, lipids, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and nucleic acid, as well as immune complexes, activate the complement cascade via distinct routes (Figure 1). Once activated, complement can facilitate the opsonization of pathogens, lyse infected cells and induce pro-inflammatory responses, and in doing so it provides a bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune systems.

The liver is the main source of complement synthesis, but many cells including monocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, glial cells and neurons produce complement, presumably to provide an early defence against locally invasive pathogens. Inappropriate activation of the complement system can cause damage or pathological changes to host tissues. For example, complement contributes to the tissue injury observed in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, nephritis and multiple sclerosis. Many pathogens are not helpless against complement-mediated attack and can sabotage complement regulatory mechanisms to avoid clearance. Others have exploited interactions with complement to facilitate their attachment to or infection of host cells.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, are chronic neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and both wild and domestic animals. Most TSEs, including natural scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, chronic wasting disease in mule deer and elk, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, are likely to be acquired by peripheral exposure (e.g. orally or through skin lesions) to these agents. For example, the consumption of meat products contaminated with BSE is almost certainly responsible for the emergence of variant CJD in the UK population [3].

The host cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) is essential for replication of the TSE agent and accumulates as an abnormal, detergent insoluble, relatively proteinase-resistant isoform, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, in diseased tissues [4]. Although the precise nature of the infectious TSE agent is uncertain, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulates in diseased tissues together with infectivity. Soon after peripheral inoculation, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulates on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in the germinal centres of lymphoid tissues, before spreading to the CNS via peripheral nerves [5]. Once the TSE agent infects the CNS, the accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is accompanied by severe neurodegeneration and ultimately the death of the host.

Expression of several complement components is up-regulated during TSE and gradually the significance of their expression to disease pathogenesis is being determined. Here we highlight recent advances in two main aspects of disease: the localization of TSE agents to cells in lymphoid tissues (Figure 2), and the consequences of complement activation in the brain for neurodegeneration (Figure 3).

Activation of complement via the classical and alternative pathways. The classical activation pathway (left) is activated by binding of the C1q complex to either antibody-bound antigen or various polymeric antigens. Activated C1 then cleaves C4, releasing C4b and the anaphylatoxin C4a (not shown). Most of the C4b is hydrolysed, but some is deposited on the activating surface (e.g. an immune complex or microorganism). C2 is then cleaved, releasing the smaller C2b fragment (not shown), whereas the C2a fragment remains bound to C4b and forms the classical pathway C3 convertase (C4bC2). The alternative activation pathway (right) is independent of antibody and is dependent on the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 in tissue fluids to produce a molecule that is structurally and functionally similar to C3b, which binds factor B, releasing the smaller fragment Ba (not shown). Activating surfaces (e.g. the surfaces of microorganisms) stabilize C3b and facilitate its binding to factor B to form the alternative activation pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb). Each C3 convertase cleaves more C3 and results in the binding of many C3b molecules to the same surface. The ultimate goal of the complement cascade is the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) via the terminal pathway. Covalently bound C3b stimulates formation of the MAC, comprising complement components C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9, which disrupts and forms a pore in the phospholipid bilayer of the target cell to lyse it.

Complement and prion pathogenesis in lymphoid tissues

Role of FDCs in TSEs

After peripheral exposure to TSE agents, neuroinvasion is crucially dependent on FDCs because, in the absence of these cells, the accumulation of infectivity in lymphoid tissues is blocked, neuroinvasion is delayed and disease susceptibility is reduced [6–8]. Examination of lymphoid tissues from individuals with variant CJD [9], most sheep with natural scrapie [10], mule deer with chronic wasting disease [11] and rodents experimentally inoculated with

scrapie [12] shows that an early accumulation of disease-specific PrP<sup>Sc</sup> takes place on FDCs.

For susceptibility to infection by TSE agents, hosts must express PrP<sup>c</sup>, the cellular form of the prion protein [13]. FDCs seem to express high levels of this protein [12,14], which may help to explain why scrapie neuroinvasion is dependent on these cells. In comparison to FDCs, lymphocytes express much smaller amounts of PrP<sup>c</sup> [15], and neuroinvasion is not compromised in the absence of either T lymphocytes [16] or the expression

The complement system in prion diseases Mabbott 589

Abundant expression of PrP<sup>c</sup> by the capsule and trabeculae has been detected in the spleen [20•]. This pattern of PrP<sup>c</sup> expression is also evident in Rag-1-deficient mice [20•] that lack mature FDCs and, as a consequence, are refractory to peripheral scrapie infection [17]. Thus, trabeculocapsular expression of PrP<sup>c</sup> is insufficient to support propagation of scrapie. Clearly, FDCs possess characteristics in addition to PrP<sup>c</sup> that enable them to acquire TSE agents and to sustain infection.

FDCs characteristically trap and retain antigens, storing them in native form on the cell surface for long periods. These retained antigens are displayed to specific B lymphocytes to initiate an appropriate antibody response. Antigens are retained on FDCs in immune complexes comprising antigen, antibodies and/or complement components. These complexes bind to FDCs via complement receptors in naive mice, or also via antibody Fc receptors in immunized mice [21]. Infections by TSE agents do not seem to induce a specific antibody response to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, suggesting that it is unlikely that FDCs acquire TSE agents via antibodies. Indeed, deficiencies in circulating antibody (if B lymphocyte maturation is unaffected) or the Fc receptor I γ chain (Fc-γRI), Fc-γRII or Fc-γRIII do not affect TSE pathogenesis [22].

### Role of complement in TSEs

Complement component C3 is essential for the follicular localization of antigen [23]. In addition, an important role for C3 in the localization of TSE agents to FDCs has been proposed, because an absence of C3 or CD21/CD35 complement receptors around the time of inoculation impairs the accumulation of scrapie in the spleen and prolongs survival time [22,24]. The complement system can be activated via two distinct pathways that converge on complement component C3 (Figure 1). The classical pathway is initiated primarily by the interaction of C1q with antibody bound to antigen, but is also activated in an antibody-independent manner by the interaction of C1q with microbial polymeric components [1]. The lectin pathway is activated by the recognition of pathogen-derived carbohydrates through mannose-binding lectin and ficolins [2].

After the initial activation of the classical pathway, subsequent interactions of C1q with C4 and C2 are essential for the amplification and progression of this pathway. By contrast, the alternative pathway is independent of antibody and is initiated by the direct covalent binding of C3 to a diverse range of microbial polymeric substances, including zymosan, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and teichoic acid [1]. Factor B and factor D are necessary for progression of the alternative pathway. An absence of the any of these complement proteins causes a deficiency in the relevant activation pathway and impairs antigen localisation to FDCs.

Potential interactions between TSE agents and complement in lymphoid tissues. (a) After peripheral exposure, TSE agents activate and/or become opsonized by complement components C1q and activated C3. After opsonization, complexes of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and complement are delivered to the lymphoid germinal centres in either (b) a cell-free or (c) cell-associated manner by migratory complement-receptor (CR)-expressing cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages or lymphocytes. (d) Complement bound PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is then acquired by FDCs expressing CR1, CR2 and potentially also the C1q receptor. After localization on the FDC, replication of the TSE agent occurs in association with these long-lived PrP<sup>c</sup>-expressing cells. (e) Current data do not exclude the possibility that the cellular form of the prion protein, PrP<sup>c</sup>, may also function as a receptor for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> on the surface of FDCs.

of PrP<sup>c</sup> by B lymphocytes [12,17]. The ability of a particular cell type to support TSE agent replication is not related only to the magnitude of PrP<sup>c</sup> expressed, however, because some cells are unable to replicate scrapie even though they express large amounts of PrP<sup>c</sup> protein. This has been clearly demonstrated in studies using transgenic mice whose T lymphocytes [18] or B lymphocytes [19] have been engineered to overexpress PrP<sup>c</sup>. In both mouse models, overexpression of PrP<sup>c</sup> was insufficient to promote replication of scrapie by T or B lymphocytes.

Potential consequences of complement activation in the CNS during transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). (a) Neurons, local microglia and astrocytes produce complement components in response to infection by TSE agents. (b) C1q, C3b, C3c, C3d and C4 bind to extracellular PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposits. (c) Complement activation via the terminal pathway forms the membrane attack complex (MAC), which can lyse the infected neuron. (d) However, significant levels of the clusterin (an inhibitor of the MAC) and CD46 (an inhibitor of C3b deposition) are also expressed; these inhibitors might protect neurons from complement-mediated lysis during TSE. (e) Production of the chemotactic complement components C3a and C5a might induce the migration of microglia, astrocytes and lymphocytes into the site of infection.

Mice lacking Clq (Clqa<sup>-/-</sup> mice), which are deficient in the classical pathway [25], and double knockouts of factor B and C2 (H2-Bf/C2<sup>-/-</sup> mice), which are deficient in both the alternative and classical pathways [26], have been used to determine the involvement of the classical or alternative complement activation pathways in the localization of scrapie to FDCs after peripheral inoculation. These experiments have shown that the classical complement activation pathway is most likely to be involved in C3 activation during scrapie infection, because the early accumulation of scrapie in the spleen is reduced and survival time is significantly extended in both H2-Bf/ C2<sup>-/-</sup> and Clqa<sup>-/-</sup> mice [22,24]. However, disruption of the classical pathway in Clqa<sup>-/-</sup> mice has a more profound effect on pathogenesis than a deficiency in other downstream complement components [22,24], which suggests that Clq might mediate the direct uptake of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, perhaps by interacting directly with complement 1 [27] or the Clq receptor [28].

Taken together, these data suggest that TSE agents are opsonized by complement components including Clq and C3. This opsonization allows TSE agents to exploit the immune complex trapping properties of PrP<sup>c</sup> [12,14] and complement receptor expressing FDCs [11,22,24, 29–31], and to facilitate replication on these long-lived cells (Figure 2).

Many issues remain unresolved concerning the involvement of early complement components in TSE

pathogenesis in lymphoid tissues. For example, it is not known whether TSE agents and/or PrP<sup>S<sup>c</sup></sup> activate the complement system and become opsonized by complement molecules. Intriguingly, FDCs have been shown to synthesize C1q [32], suggesting that TSE agents could bind complement either at the exposure site or within the confines of the FDC itself. Identifying complement-binding motifs on PrP or other agent-associated molecules might identify targets for blocking complement-mediated opsonization.

Of course, FDCs are not the only cells in lymphoid tissues to express complement receptors. Thus, the role of complement in TSE may not be due only to interactions between TSE agents and FDCs. Complement might also facilitate the uptake of TSE agents by mobile cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells, which may be involved in the transportation of TSE agents to and from lymphoid tissues [33,34]. Further studies using mice with a mismatch in complement receptor expression between FDCs and bone-marrow derived cells are necessary to address this important issue.

An alternative hypothesis for the role of complement in TSE pathogenesis has been recently proposed [20]. After stimulation by passive immunization with preformed immune complexes or infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, a strong increase in FDC-associated expression of PrP<sup>c</sup> is observed in the spleen [20]. This upregulation does not occur in Clqa<sup>-/-</sup> mice, implying that the upregulation of PrP<sup>c</sup> on FDCs might be dependent on C1q. Lötscher *et al.* [20] have suggested that the C1q-mediated upregulation of PrP<sup>c</sup> expression on FDCs might increase host susceptibility to TSEs.

TSE agents are not the only pathogens to exploit the complement system to infect host cells [35]. For example, HIV opsonization with C3 enhances attachment and retention of virus particles via complement receptors on cells including FDCs and lymphocytes [36,37]; furthermore, attachment and invasion of macrophages by *Leishmania* parasites can occur via the C3 receptor [38].

### Complement and prion pathogenesis in the CNS

Glial cells and neurons can synthesize complement molecules in response to infection in the CNS. Activation of complement provides an essential innate immune defence mechanism, but its inappropriate or uncontrolled activation can cause neuropathological changes. For example, neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis are associated with chronic activation and synthesis of complement [39]. In both multiple sclerosis and its experimental rodent model, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, activation of complement is thought to play a pivotal role by recruiting inflammatory cells, increasing myelin phagocytosis by macrophages, and exerting cytotoxic effects on oligodendrocytes through deposition of the membrane attack complex (MAC). In rodents deficient in C3, factor B or C6, the pathology associated with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis is much milder [40,41].

Complement components C1q, C3b, C3c, C3d and C4 have been detected in amyloid plaques in the brains of individuals affected with sporadic CJD and Gerstmann–Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease [42]. In a separate study, active complement components C1q and C3b have been also observed in the brains of individuals affected with variant CJD, sporadic CJD, familial CJD and GSS disease [43]. Differential analysis of gene expression in the brains of rodents experimentally infected with either scrapie [44,45] or BSE [45] suggests that mRNA specific for C1q is similarly overexpressed in these diseases.

The ultimate goal of the complement system is the formation of the MAC, involving complement components C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9, via the terminal complement pathway. This complex forms a pore in the membrane of the target cell, leading to its lysis and cell death (*Figure 3*). The MAC has been also detected in association with neurons in the brains of individuals affected with TSE, where its presence correlated with the severity of the disease-specific neurodegeneration [43].

To avoid inappropriate activation of complement and damage to host tissues, the complement system is tightly regulated by various soluble or cell-associated inhibitors. Clusterin (also known as apolipoprotein J) is a soluble complement inhibitor that binds to the MAC and renders it inactive. Increased expression of clusterin has been observed in brains of individuals affected with TSE [46], cattle affected with BSE [47], and mice infected with the Fukuoka-1 strain of agent derived from a individual affect with GSS [46]. Analysis of data from experimentally infected rodents suggests that the expression of clusterin is induced by the deposition of pathological PrP [46]. Membrane cofactor protein (also known as CD46) is a transmembrane complement regulator that inhibits complement activation by regulating the deposition of C3b on targets. Increased expression of membrane cofactor protein in the brains of individuals affected with TSE has been also observed [43].

Taken together, data from both human and experimental rodent studies suggest that TSEs induce the expression of both early and terminal complement components in the brain, but the neuropathological consequences of this induction are unclear. TSE-associated neuropathy is not affected in mice deficient in Clqa, C2, C3 [22,24], or C5 (NA Mabbott, ME Bruce, unpublished) however, suggesting that neurodegeneration is not mediated by complement. Likewise, these data indicate
that complement is also unlikely to play a protective role in the CNS during infection by TSE agents.

Infection by TSE agents in the CNS is, however, accompanied by upregulated expression of some complement regulatory molecules or inhibitors, and thus it is possible that these complement inhibitors might protect neurons from complement-mediated lysis. Whether TSE neuropathology is exacerbated in the absence of these complement inhibitors, as is observed in other CNS diseases, is not known [48]. Migration of lymphocytes into the brains of TSE-affected mice has been described, but the significance of their presence is unknown [49]. Complement components such as C3a and C5a are highly chemotactic; thus, these molecules might contribute towards the migration of lymphocytes, astrocytes and microglia into areas of CNS pathology.

### Conclusions

TSE infection in the CNS is accompanied by a significant upregulation of both early and terminal complement components. Despite this activation, complement seems unlikely to be involved in neuropathology or neuroprotection, which suggests that TSEs induce sublytic levels of complement in the CNS. It is also plausible that the disease-induced expression of complement inhibitory molecules protects neurons from potential complement-mediated lysis.

After peripheral inoculation with TSE agents, early accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> takes place in lymphoid tissues in association with FDCs. In mice deficient in Clq, C2, C3 or complement receptors, this accumulation is reduced and survival time is extended, which suggests that complement opsonization localizes TSE agents to lymphoid tissues. At present, there are no practical options for therapeutic intervention in TSEs. Thus, manipulating the complement cascade, for example by blocking the opsonization of PrP or other TSE agents, might provide an opportunity for early intervention in peripherally acquired TSEs.
