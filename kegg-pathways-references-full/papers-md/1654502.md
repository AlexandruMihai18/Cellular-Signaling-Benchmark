### Summary.
The cluster of streptomycin (SM) production genes in *Streptomyces griseus* was further analysed by determining the nucleotide sequence of genes strFGHIK. The products of the strF and/or strG genes may be involved in the formation of N-methyl-L-glucosamine, and that of the strH gene in the first glycosylation step condensing streptidine-6-phosphate and dihydrostreptose. The putative StrI protein showed strong similarity to the amino-terminal NAD(P)-binding sites of many dehydrogenases, especially of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases. The product of the strK gene strongly resembles the alkaline phosphatase of *Escherichia coli*. It was shown that *S. griseus* excretes an enzyme that specifically cleaves both SM-6-phosphate and – more slowly – SM-3′-phosphate during the production phase for SM. The identity of this enzyme with the StrK protein was demonstrated by expression of the strK gene in *Streptomyces lividans* 66. Further evidence for an involvement of these genes in SM biosynthesis came from the fact that genes homologous to them were found in the equivalent gene cluster of the hydroxy-SM producer *Streptomyces glaucescens*; these, however, were in part differently organized. The ca. 5 kb DNA segment downstream of strI in *S. griseus* which contains the strK gene was found to be located in inverse orientation between the homologues of the aphD and strR genes in *S. glaucescens*.

**Key words:** Streptomycetes – Streptomycin – Antibiotic production – Phosphatases

### Introduction
Accumulating data have confirmed the earlier evidence for clustered organization of secondary metabolic genes in streptomycetes, e.g. those encoding the production of antibiotics (reviewed in Martin and Liras 1989; Seno

and Baltz 1989). It now can be regarded as a general rule that the full complement of genes needed for any particular biosynthetic pathway for a secondary metabolite is organized within a single cluster. Moreover, for gene clusters which specify the formation of chemically related end-products, at least some of the common genes are organized conservatively as has been shown for polyketides (Donadio et al. 1989), aminoglycosides of the streptomycin group (Mayer et al. 1988) or phosphinothricin (Thompson et al. 1987; Wohlleben et al. 1988). In those instances in which gene clusters for antibiotic production have been analysed in some detail, the clusters have been found to contain regulatory and resistance genes besides the structural genes for the biosynthetic enzymes (e.g. Hopwood et al. 1986; Distler et al. 1987a, 1990).

Among antibiotic production genes those required for resistance are the best studied and, frequently, more than one resistance gene for a given antibiotic exists in the producing organism (reviewed in Cundliffe 1989). Many or possibly most of the resistance enzymes encoded seem to belong to ancient protein families (Piepersberg et al. 1988, 1990). For example, all the known antibiotic phosphotransferases are related to eucaryotic protein kinases (Distler et al. 1987a; Heinz et al. 1988). This and other evidence could shed some light on the early evolution and function of secondary metabolism (Davies 1990; Piepersberg et al. 1990).

Formation and excretion of the aminoglycoside streptomycin (SM) and closely related compounds has been found in various species of the genera *Streptomyces* and *Streptoverticillium*. Recent findings indicate that at least some of the production genes are also present in soil mycobacteria (J.E. Davies, personal communication). Genes involved in SM production have been cloned and partially analysed from *Streptomyces griseus* and *Streptomyces glaucescens* (reviewed in Mansouri et al. 1989). In *S. griseus* the two SM resistance genes aphD and aphE encode SM-6- and SM-3′-phosphotransferases, respectively. Both biosynthetic and regulatory genes were found to be clustered on each side of the aphD gene.

Here, we extend this investigation by reporting the nucleotide sequence of part of this cluster from *S. griseus*, covering five putative genes, *strFGHIK*. Evidence is presented that these genes are engaged in SM formation and that the StrK protein represents an extracellular phosphatase specific for SM-phosphates.

### Materials and methods

#### Bacteria, plasmids, and growth conditions
*S. griseus* N2-3-11 (Grisebach 1978) and *Streptomyces lividans* 66 strain TK23 (from D.A. Hopwood) were grown on SMA (Distler et al. 1985) or tryptic soy broth (TSB; Hopwood et al. 1985). *Escherichia coli* K12 strains JM83 (*ara, rpsL, A* (*lac-proAB*), *lacZ* M15, φ80; Yanisch-Perron et al. 1985), NM538 (*supF, hsdR, trpR, lacY*) and NM539 (*supF, hsdR, lacY, P2 cox3*) (both Frischauf et al. 1983), BHB2688 (*recA, [λimm434, cIts2, red3, Eam4, Sam7]/λ*), and BHB2690 (*recA, [λimm434, cIts2, red3, Dam15, Sam7]/λ*) (both Arber et al. 1983) were cultured and selected as described by Maniatis et al. (1982) or in the original publications. Plasmid pIJ702 (Katz et al. 1983) was kindly provided by C. Thompson. The plasmids pJDM1 and pJDM40 have been described in previous publications (Distler and Piepersberg 1985; Distler et al. 1985). Plasmid pUC18 (Norrander et al. 1983) was obtained from A. Böck.

#### DNA isolation, manipulation, and transformation
Genomic and plasmid DNA was isolated from *S. griseus* N2-3-11 or from *S. lividans* 66 TK23 and *E. coli* as described by Hopwood et al. (1985) and Maniatis et al. (1982), respectively. Isolation and size fractionation of DNA fragments was carried out according to the protocols of Maniatis et al. (1982). *E. coli* and *S. lividans* 66 strains were transformed as described by Hopwood et al. (1985). Gel blot hybridization on Hybond N (Amersham, Braunschweig, FRG) and nick-translation of DNA were carried out according to the methods compiled in Maniatis et al. (1982) and Hopwood et al. (1985). Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase (from Pharmacia, Freiburg, or Gibco-BRL, Frankfurt, FRG), and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG) were used according to the recommendations of the manufacturers.

#### Preparation of a library of genomic DNA
Vector lambda EMBL3 was prepared from lysates obtained after propagation on *E. coli* NM538 in liquid media as described by Miller (1972). The 10–20 kb fraction of partially *MboI*-cleaved genomic DNA from *S. griseus* N2-3-11 was ligated to the vector digested with *BamHI + EcoRI* (to avoid self-annealing; Frischauf et al. 1983). In vitro packaging of ligated DNA mixtures and preparation of packaging extracts from *E. coli* strains BHB2688 and BHB2690 were carried out essentially as given by Hohn and Murray (1977). Recombinant phage clones were isolated on *E. coli* NM539 as a host. The DNA of recombinant EMBL3 phages was purified by the method given in Hopwood et al. (1985).

#### DNA sequencing
Restriction fragments from phage clone N6′-1 (cf. Fig. 1) were subcloned in pUC18. Further subcloning was performed using ExoIII (Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG) and ExoVII (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, FRG) to create deletions (Yanisch-Perron et al. 1985). Sequencing was carried out according to the dideoxy procedure (Sanger et al. 1977) for double-stranded DNA following the manufacturer's recommendations for the pUC sequencing kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG). The Klenow fragment of polymerase I (Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG) was used as the general enzyme for sequencing, but at incubation temperatures of 50°C. To analyze areas of compression resulting from the high G+C content of streptomycete DNA, polymerized fragments were treated with 1.5 M methoxyamine and 1 M sodium bisulfite (Ambartsumyan and Mazo 1980).

#### Assays for extracellular phosphatases
The activity of the phosphatase(s) specific for SM-6-phosphate and SM-3″-phosphate was determined as follows: mycelia of *S. griseus* were grown in 10 l volumes (Biostat E fermentor; Braun, Melsungen, FRG) in TSB (Oxoid, Hamburg, FRG). Enzyme assays contained in 100 μl volumes (or multiples thereof) 30 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl₂, 40 to 60 μM substrate, and variable quantities

of supernatants (or enzyme preparations). Incubation was at 30°C. Hydrolysis was measured by the phosphocellulose paper-binding assay (Haas and Dowding 1975) in 10 μl aliquots taken at various times from the above incubation mixtures. For analytical purposes, the phosphatase activity was measured directly in the supernatants of 10 ml cultures grown for 48 h in TSB medium, to which 15 μg/ml thiostrepton was added when plasmid-bearing strains were used.

SM-phosphates, labelled with [γ-³²P]ATP (Amershams, Braunschweig, FRG), were synthesized with the aminoglycoside phosphotransferases APH(6) and APH(3′) of *S. griseus*, encoded by plasmids pJDM40 and pJDM1, respectively, via previously described methods (Haas and Dowding 1975; Distler et al. 1985; Heinzel et al. 1988). After incubation, these were separated from adenine nucleotides by passage over Dowex 1X8 (Serva, Heidelberg, FRG) and yielded specific radioactivities in the range of 10 to 20 μCi/μmol. SM-phosphate-specific phosphatase was partially purified from culture supernatants of *S. griseus* N2-3-11 by 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by octyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Freiburg, FRG) column chromatography (the enzyme bound in the presence of 30% ammonium sulfate and was eluted with salt-free buffer).

### Computer-assisted analysis of nucleic acids and proteins

The algorithms for computer-assisted analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences were RBSA from D.J. Lipman and W.J. Wilbur (NIH, Bethesda, USA), MSEQ from S.D. Black and J.C. Glorioso (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA) and the PCGENE (Genofit, Heidelberg, FRG) PROSIS (Pharmacia, Freiburg, FRG), and FASTA (Pearson and Lipman 1988) software packages.

### Results

#### Extension of the cloned DNA segment in *S. griseus*

In order to clone further DNA extending the previously cloned segment represented by the inserts in plasmids pJDM40 and pJDM10, a library of DNA from *S. griseus* N2-3-11 was prepared in phage lambda EMBL3. Using the 0.69 kb *BamHI* (covering part of the *aphD* gene; Distler et al. 1987a) and 1.63 kb *BamHI-BglII* fragments of pJDM40 as probes (Fig. 1) screening by plaque hybridization yielded eight stable phage clones that gave positive signals. Restriction analysis proved that all inserts overlapped the same genomic region and revealed that their lengths were in the range of approximately 12 to 20 kb. Clones N3 and N6′-1 were chosen for further use (cf. Fig. 1A).

#### Determination and analysis of nucleotide sequences downstream of the *strB1* gene

The strategy for sequencing about 5.0 kb of DNA further downstream of the *strB1* gene (Distler et al. 1987b; Mayer et al. 1988) is outlined in Fig. 1B. The nucleotide sequence (Fig. 2) contained open reading frames for five proteins with calculated molecular weights of 31.7 kDa (*StrF*), 23.1 kDa (*StrG*), 42.9 kDa (*StrH*), 36.7 kDa (*StrI*), and 46.3 kDa (*StrK*), when the strict codon usage rules for streptomycetes (Bibb et al. 1984) were applied. These reading frames, provisionally designated with the gene symbols *strF* to *strK*, were all oriented in the same direction as the *strB1* gene and preceded by putative ribosome binding sites (Fig. 2). Because of their overlapping stop and start codons, the expression of the *strI* and *strK* genes may be subject to translational coupling.

##### Genes *strF* and *strG*

Either or both of the two genes *strF* and *strG* could encode an enzyme(s) involved in the biogenesis of the N-methyl-L-glucosamine moiety of SM, because the two reading frames fell into the 2.563 kb *BgIII-BamHI* fragment [nucleotide (nt) positions 1856 to 4419 in Fig. 2], which complemented a mutant blocked in this branch of the pathway (Kumada et al. 1986). Both the *strF* and the *strG* reading frames were highly conserved in the *S. glaucescens* cluster of *str* genes (G. Mayer and W. Piepersberg, unpublished observations). The possible gene products StrF and StrG, when compared with a bank of all available protein sequences of monosaccharide-metabolizing enzymes extracted from the SWISSPROT database (release 15), showed distant similarities to the amino- and carboxy-terminal segments, respectively, of both the *E. coli* and the murine glucose-6-phosphate isomerases (Pgi). With the Pgi from *E. coli* (Froman et al. 1989) the FASTA program revealed identities of 26.9% in a 26 amino acid (aa) region and of 50% in a 16 aa segment in the StrF and StrG proteins, respectively. For the murine Pgi (Gurney et al. 1986) these values were 44.4% in an 18 aa overlap and 22% in an 82 aa overlap, respectively. This could mean that the two genes arose from the separation of one original cistron into two reading frames, or vice versa. No significant similarities of the primary structures of the StrF and StrG proteins to other proteins in the database were found.

##### Genes *strH* and *strI*

According to mutant complementation data obtained by others (Ohnuki et al. 1985), a gene overlapping the single *BgII* site (nt position 4419 in Fig. 2) was postulated to encode an enzyme involved in the first glycosylation step using streptidine-6-phosphate and dTDP-dihydrostreptose as substrates. Therefore, available protein sequences of glycosyltransferases (which do not form a protein family on the basis of primary structure comparisons) were screened for similarities in their primary structures. A short sequence motif was found in StrH, which was similar (13 identical out of 39 aa) to a region in the alpha-glucosyltransferase of coliphage T4 (Gram and Rüger 1985). Further but weaker similarities were found with other known glycosyltransferases,

Fig. 2. Nucleotide sequence of the genes strFGHIK. Part of the sequence (preceding the BamHI site at position 2784) was taken from an earlier publication (Distler et al. 1987b). Putative protein sequences are given in the single letter code. Possible ribosome binding sites are overlined. Some recognition sites for restriction endonucleases are indicated. Two significant inverted repeat structures following the strG and strK reading frames, respectively, are indicated by arrows with broken lines.

which, however, did not overlap with the sequence motif mentioned above.

The putative protein StrI showed in its N-terminal section the conserved primary structure motifs found in the dinucleotide binding sites of many oxidoreductases (see examples in Fig. 3). The strongest similarity was found with the family of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDHs) of pro- and eucaryotic origin covering a stretch of about 80 aa (not shown). In this domain StrI was more similar to the GapA protein of E. coli than to the other known GAPDH enzyme from this organism (Branlant and Branlant 1985; Alefounder and Perham 1989). Also, the highly conserved residues in the NAD-binding alpha-beta-alpha fold of

Fig. 3. Conserved primary structure motif in the putative StrI protein. Primary structures of the dinucleotide binding sites of various known or presumed oxidoreductases (compiled in Wierenga and Hol 1983) are compared with the N-terminal sequence of the putative StrI protein. LDH, lactate dehydrogenase (pig); ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase (horse); GPD, glycerol aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (lobster); GR, glutathione reductase (human erythrocytes); PHBH, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Pseudomonas fluorescens); P21, protein p21 (human bladder); the dinucleotide coenzymes used are given in parentheses. Most highly conserved residues are marked: triangles, hydrophilic; dots, hydrophobic; vertical lines, obligate glycine residues; dashes, negatively charged residues. Secondary structure elements are given by: #, beta fold; *, alpha helix

GAPDH proteins were all present in this gene product. This justified the conclusion that the StrI protein should bind NAD+/NADH as a coenzyme. Therefore, StrI is likely to catalyse one of the numerous steps dependent on dehydrogenases or epimerases in the biosynthesis of all three hexose-derived moieties of SM.

The gene strK encodes an extracellular phosphatase

The last gene in the subcluster analysed, strK, clearly coded for an excreted phosphatase as was shown by the high degree of sequence similarity between its gene product and the alkaline phosphatase of E. coli (PhoA) (Fig. 4). The main differences between the putative StrK protein and PhoA were found only at the amino-terminus, and comprise the (putative) signal peptides. In particular, all portions of the mature PhoA protein known to be involved in catalytic functions or cofactor binding were conserved (cf. Fig. 4). The occurrence of this gene in the cluster of str genes suggested a specific function for the StrK protein as an SM-6-phosphate phosphatase, an activity already claimed to exist in S. griseus strains (Nimi et al. 1970).

To investigate this hypothesis fermentor cultures of S. griseus were tested for extracellular phosphatase activities at various stages and with varying substrates. A first screening for phosphatase activities revealed that an enzyme specific for SM-6-phosphate hydrolysis occurred in complete medium. A minor portion of this activity accumulated until 20 h after inoculation in a cell-bound fraction, which then decreased (not shown). Later a much higher activity was accumulated in the extracellular fraction (supernatant) (Fig. 5). This was in contrast to an earlier report (Nimi et al. 1970) where a similar activity was found only in osmotic shock extracts. Under fermentation conditions the activity appeared toward the end of the vegetative growth phase

Fig. 5. The SM-6-phosphatase activity of *Streptomyces griseus*. The time course of occurrence of hydrolase activity for SM-6-phosphate in culture supernatants (line broken by dots) is plotted relative to the growth curve (dry weight; full line) and change of pH (dashed line) in 10 l fermentations. The phosphatase activity is expressed as percentage hydrolysis after 30 min incubation of 40 μl supernatant in a 100 μl standard assay. For further details see Materials and methods. The accumulation of SM parallels the kinetics of phosphatase formation after onset at 25 h following inoculation (not shown).

**Fig. 7. Hybridization of the strK region of Streptomyces griseus against the str gene cluster of Streptomyces glaucescens.** The comparison between both clusters published by Mayer et al. (1988) was extended by using fragments a and b from *S. griseus* as probes in Southern hybridizations against DNA from *S. glaucescens* digested with EcoRI or BamHI, respectively. Hybridizing segments are indicated below a restriction map of the *S. glaucescens* DNA. Symbols: B, BamHI; Bg, BglII; E, EcoRI; P, PstI; S, SstI; sites in parentheses mean that only the relevant sites are shown. The str genes are identified by bold letters [A indicates the aphD gene; information on gene strB2 is from Mayer et al. (1988)]. The open arrows give an interpretation of the discovered rearrangement of the fragment covering the strK gene and stretches of DNA downstream thereof.

that at least two to three genes may be located downstream of strK that might also be members of the cluster. The partial sequence of the region upstream of the sph gene of *S. glaucescens*, which is equivalent to the aphD gene of *S. griseus* (Distler et al. 1987a), was also shown to contain an open reading frame in the opposite orientation, which was transcribed from a divergent promoter upstream of the sph promoter (Vögtli and Hütter 1987). A comparison of the derived polypeptide sequences confirmed that the gene product is largely homologous to the StrK protein, again with significant differences only in the signal peptide region (cf. Fig. 4).

### Discussion

Most of the SM production genes known so far (cf. Mansouri et al. 1989) cannot yet be assigned specific functions or associated with particular biosynthetic steps. This results mainly from three facts: (i) too few of the primary structures of general metabolic enzymes are available, especially those involved in sugar metabolism in procaryotes; (ii) too few, well characterized mutants that are blocked in single steps of the SM pathway are available in producing strains; and (iii) most of the steps and enzymes necessary for SM biogenesis are still

hypothetical or unknown. In this situation, which also holds for all other research on the genetics of secondary metabolic pathways, progress can result only from two approaches: firstly the gene-specific induction of mutations (e.g., by gene disruption) and their subsequent biochemical characterization and, secondly, from more rapidly accumulating sequence data from various organisms, especially streptomycetes, which is then available for comparative purposes. This is illustrated, for instance, by the recent finding that one of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of 6-deoxysugar side chains of avermectin in *Streptomyces avermitilis* is strongly homologous to the *strD* gene of *S. griseus* (D. MacNeil, personal communication), which putatively encodes a dTDP-glucose synthase catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of the streptose moiety (Distler et al., 1987b). Therefore, antibiotic production genes seem to be used in a modular fashion, i.e., being used at least in part in various combinations to form different pathways. These findings could not only largely facilitate the attribution of functions to more of the biosynthetic genes, but could provide natural protocols for the design of new hybrid pathways.

Four of the five genes identified downstream of the *strB1* gene of *S. griseus* N2-3-11 and reported herein are assigned to the set of genes engaged in SM biosynthesis (*str* genes) only by circumstantial or indirect evidence: (i) they are clustered with known production genes; (ii) some of the DNA covering this area complements mutations blocked in SM production; (iii) the evolutionary distance and the degree of conservation between the clusters of streptomycin production genes in *S. griseus* and *S. glaucescens*, which was found to be restricted to the coding regions only (Mayer et al., 1988, G. Mayer and W. Piepersberg, unpublished observations), suggests that all homologous genes in the equivalent regions are likely to be involved in SM biosynthesis.

lent genomic regions are *str* genes. This is further supported by the fact that the restriction patterns and the intercistronic sequences were found to be completely different (cf. Fig. 7) though the degree of reorganization within both sets of *str* genes was revealed to be very small. Therefore, we believe we are on safe grounds in designating the genes found so far as *str* genes. It can be predicted that we will find further *str* genes between the *sph* (*aphD*) and *strR'* genes of *S.* glaucescens, the equivalents of which are probably localized further downstream of the *strK* gene in *S.* griseus. Whether these then represent the left-hand end of the cluster is not yet known since the fragment identified as restoring antibiotic production in a (hydroxy-) SM-negative deletion mutant of *S.* glaucescens extends further to the left (in the orientation given in Fig. 6; Vögtli 1989).

The functions suggested for most of the putative Str proteins will have to be verified by biochemical data. Most intriguing at present are the products of the *strH*, *strI* and *strK* genes: a dihydrostreptosyl-glycosyltransferase, a dehydrogenase and an SM-phosphate phosphatase, respectively. The StrH protein, if it truly catalyses a glycosyl transfer would be the first enzyme of the group of rhamnose-like sugar transferases to become available for further investigation. Related genes could be more widely distributed in streptomycetes, since many different derivatives of dTDP-activated 6-deoxyhexose derivatives are transferred as side chains onto various different secondary metabolites such as macrolides, anthracyclines, polyenes, nucleoside and peptide antibiotics. The finding that use of an *strH*-specific gene probe results in either single or double hybridization signals in the genomic DNA in 15 out of 44 streptomycete strains tested (including *S.* lividans 66; 11 of the tested strains were known to produce secondary metabolites containing 6-deoxyhexoses), provides the first indication that this might be a realistic expectation (M. Stockmann and W. Piepersberg, unpublished observations). A very interesting application of such enzymes could be their use in biotransformation of various aglycones.

The *strK* gene and its product are similarly attractive for both basic and applied research. The occurrence of a specific SM-phosphate phosphatase in the culture supernatant during the production phase could mean that the phosphorylated form(s) of the antibiotic is also present in the extracellular fluid and is mainly cleaved there. Indirect evidence for this derives from the fact that no biologically active SM was detected in supernatants, when the pH in liquid cultures was adjusted to values below pH 7, i.e., conditions which inactivate the phosphatase. The signal peptides of the two putative StrK proteins in *S.* griseus and *S.* glaucescens are relatively dissimilar when compared with their presumed mature proteins (Fig. 4). The signal peptide of the PhoA precursor of *E.* coli differs even more. When 31 signal peptides from streptomycete extracellular proteins are compared (Table 1) several features can be deduced that characteristically distinguish them from those of excreted proteins in other bacterial genera (von Heijne 1986). (i) On the average they are longer than in other bacteria (24 to 56 residues, mean 35); (ii) in most of them the positively charged stretch at the N-terminus is also elongated and, in contrast to other bacterial signal peptides, shows a strong preference for arginine over lysine residues (100/7 in Table 1). This could be a reflection of the need to maximize the G+C content of the DNA since lysine codons are A-rich. (iii) The hydrophobic core peptides are enriched in alanine relative to leucine, valine, isoleucine, and aromatic amino acids (192 alanine/180 other hydrophobic residues). (iv) The proline concentration around the cleavage site is enhanced, though not in positions –2 to +1, and a proline residue preceding the (presumed) procession sites at a distance of 4 to 12 residues seems to be obligatory. A more extended and pronounced beta-turn structure could be necessary in streptomycetes around the cleavage site (Duffaud and Inouye 1988). Whether all this reflects the typical structural requirements for the streptomyces signal peptides and a specific design of the secretory pathway, will have to be investigated in more detail. The signal peptide of the *S.* griseus StrK precursor or the mature form might be useful in protein fusions for either heterologous expression or for molecular targeting studies similar to those carried out with the aid of the PhoA signal peptide of *E.* coli (Gierasch 1989).
