### Abstract

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Mutations in the tumour suppressor APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) genes occur early in the development of CRC and lead to the stabilization of the Wnt pathway component β-catenin and to the constitutive activation of Wnt signalling. Stabilizing mutations of β-catenin can also lead to its accumulation, qualifying β-catenin as a proto-oncogene. Here I will summarize the biochemical interactions occurring in Wnt signalling and describe how alterations in Wnt pathway components lead to CRC.

### Introduction

As proposed in the genetic model of colorectal tumorigenesis by Fearon and Vogelstein, sequential mutations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes lead to progression from single crypt lesions, to adenomatous polyps, to malignant cancer [1]. One of the earliest genetic lesions in colorectal cancer (CRC) is the mutation of the tumour suppressor gene APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) which has therefore been considered a gatekeeper in tumorigenesis of CRC [2]. Additional mutations, such as in the oncogene K-ras and the tumour suppressor gene p53, provide further growth advantage to the APC mutated cells and lead to progression to carcinomas. Much of what is known about the role of APC has been derived from studies on the hereditary CRC syndromes familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant inherited disease which develops as a consequence of germline mutations of APC. Patients inherit one mutated allele of APC and after loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type locus, develop hundreds of polyps in the colon, which at an early age transform into cancer. Importantly, sporadic CRCs also show a high (approx. 80%) frequency of APC mutations. Research over the last decade has shown that the main tumour-relevant consequence of APC mutations is the constitutive activation of the Wnt signalling pathway which will be the major topic of this review.

Wnt factors are secreted proteins that bind to Frizzled transmembrane receptors and to LRP (low-density lipoprotein-receptor-related proteins) co-receptors, and may act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion [3]. After binding of Wnts to Frizzled proteins, the cytoplasmic phosphoprotein, Dishevelled, becomes recruited to the plasma membrane, possibly by interaction with phospholipids and/or with Frizzleds [4–6]. This leads to activation of Dishevelled which can then interfere with degradation of the cytoplasmic protein β-catenin. As a result, an intracellular signalling cascade is initiated that leads to the stabilization of β-catenin, which enters the nucleus and forms complexes with high mobility group box transcription factors of the LEF (lymphoid enhancer factor)/TCF (T-cell factor) family (below referred to as TCF; [7–9]) (Figure 1). After binding to specific promoter elements, the TCF–β-catenin complexes activate target genes together with co-activators such as SWI/SNF and p300/CBP (cAMP-response-element-binding-protein) [10,11]. The nuclear import of β-catenin does not require a nuclear-localization signal and is independent of importins. Rather, nuclear transport of β-catenin depends on its binding to legless/Bcl-9 and pygopus co-factors which are essential for Wnt signalling [12–14]. Importantly, β-catenin can also interact with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins, for instance with E-cadherin in epithelial cells, and provides a link to the actin cytoskeleton via its binding to the vinculin-related protein α-catenin [15]. The association with E-cadherin protects β-catenin from degradation.

APC binds to β-catenin and induces its degradation in 26 S proteasomes, thereby acting as a strong negative regulator of the Wnt pathway [16]. APC is part of a β-catenin destruction complex, which also includes the scaffold proteins axin or conductin/axin2, casein kinase I (protein kinase CKI) and glycogen synthase kinase3β (GSK3β) [17–21]. The main function of this complex is to facilitate sequential phosphorylation of β-catenin by CKI and GSK3β at specific serine and threonine residues in its N-terminus [21,22]. Phosphorylated β-catenin is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin

E3 ligase β-TrCP and subsequently degraded in proteasomes [23,24]. The phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β is far more efficient in the presence of axin than in its absence, and overexpression of axin/conductin promotes the degradation of β-catenin [18,20]. Axin and conductin share an overall identity in amino acids of 45% and seem to have similar biochemical functions, but they differ in their regulation. Whereas axin is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and in the adult, conductin seems to be specifically expressed in tissues that are characterized by active Wnt signalling [25]. Recently, oscillating levels of conductin that could reflect activation/inhibition cycles of Wnt signalling, were associated with the formation of the presomitic mesoderm in the mouse [26]. Moreover, in contrast to axin, conductin is strongly up-regulated in colon, liver, and ovarian tumours [25,27,28]. The promoter of the conductin/axin2 gene contains functional TCF binding sites and biochemical experiments demonstrate that conductin is a direct target of the Wnt pathway that acts in a negative feedback mechanism ([25,28]; and M. Reichel and J. Behrens, unpublished work). Thus, axin seems to represent the constitutive component of the β-catenin destruction complex, while axin2/conductin is inducible. Conductin might be important to prevent an overshoot of the signalling, or act as a rapid switch-off as soon as Wnts are no longer present. Whether the up-regulation of axin2/conductin in tumours has a functional role remains to be determined. In the absence of wild-type APC or when β-catenin is mutated, both axin and conductin seem to be insufficient for blocking the accumulation of β-catenin, but they might be able to retain β-catenin in the cytoplasm to some extent and thus attenuate the signal [29].

The precise activation mechanism of Dishevelled, as well as its function in the stabilization of β-catenin, is not known but it appears that Dishevelled directly interferes with the β-catenin destruction complex [4]. In addition to Dishevelled, axin is also recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to LRP, which blocks function of the β-catenin destruction complex [30,31].

**Mutations of Wnt pathway components in cancer**

Mutations in components of the β-catenin destruction complex lead to aberrant stabilization of β-catenin and thus to constitutive, Wnt-independent activation of TCF/β-catenin signalling. Mutations of APC in CRC occur mostly in a mutation cluster region that is located approximately in the middle of the coding sequence. The mutations lead to frameshifts or stop codons, resulting in the generation of truncated APC proteins that lack several of the 20-amino-acid repeats that interact with β-catenin and all the SAMP interaction domains for axin/conductin [16]. It is thought that the resulting disturbance of the architecture of the β-catenin destruction complex is responsible for the stabilization of β-catenin. Moreover, truncated APC also lacks several nuclear export sequences (NES) thought to be important for an APC-mediated export of β-catenin from the nucleus [32]. In summary, APC mutations lead to accumulation of β-catenin and constitutive transcription of Wnt target genes in the absence of exogenous Wnt factors [33,34].

It is not clear why CRC cells retain the truncated APC versions, i.e. why cancer generating mutations do not completely abolish APC expression. Interestingly, a special form of attenuated FAP, in which patients develop much fewer polyps than in the classical FAP, is characterized by mutations that are more 5′ and consequently generate shorter APC proteins [35]. This indicates that the truncated APC retains some function that is required for robust tumorigenesis.

β-Catenin is mutated in up to 10% of all sporadic colon carcinoma by point mutations or in frame deletions of the serine and threonine residues that are phosphorylated by GSK3β [16]. These mutations result in stabilization of β-catenin and activation of Wnt signalling. β-Catenin and APC

**Figure 1 | Overview of the Wnt pathway**

Binding of Wnts to Frizzled receptors activates Dishevelled, which blocks the function of a complex assembled over the scaffold proteins axin or conductin. In the absence of Wnts (−Wnt) the axin/conductin complexes promote phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β (~P). Phosphorylated β-catenin becomes multi-ubiquitinated (Ub) and subsequently degraded in proteasomes. In the presence of Wnts or after mutations of APC, axin/conductin or β-catenin, phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin is blocked, which allows the nuclear transfer of β-catenin with the help of Bcl-9/pygopus factors and its association with TCF transcription factors (+Wnt or mutations). The TCF/β-catenin complexes bind to DNA and activate Wnt target genes.
mutations are mutually exclusive, possibly reflecting the fact that both components act in the same pathway. β-Catenin mutations are frequent in other tumour types than CRC, such as liver tumours, whereas APC mutations are more confined to CRC. Germline mutations of conductin/axin2 have also been described. The affected families show prevalence for the formation of oligodontia and colorectal neoplasias [36]. Mutations of conductin/axin2 occur in 25% of the micro-satellite-unstable colorectal tumours. Mutations of axin and conductin/axin2 genes have also been identified in various other tumour entities, such as medulloblastomas, endometrioid ovarian carcinomas, hepatomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (see [37] for a review). Animal models for tumour formation by Wnt signalling have been generated in the mouse. For instance, germline mutations of APC or expression of mutated β-catenin lead to the formation of intestinal adenomas which are mainly confined to the small intestine.

Although it appears that mutations of Wnt-pathway components suffice to generate constitutive activation of Wnt signalling in CRC, recent evidence suggests additional autocrine mechanisms involving stimulation of the pathway by secreted Wnt proteins [38,39]. Thus it was shown that colorectal cancer cells frequently express Wnts, and that the Wnt-pathway activity could be suppressed by treatment of the cells with SFRPs (secreted Frizzled related proteins), which interfere with Wnt receptor binding. Importantly, the genes for SFRPs are subject to inactivation by hypermethylation in the CRC cells, indicating an epigenetic mechanism that leads to a boost of the Wnt signal [38]. Autocrine Wnt stimulation has also been observed in other tumour cell types, in particular from breast and ovary. Over-expression of the extracellular inhibitor of Wnts, Dickkopf, leads to down-regulation of β-catenin levels and Wnt target gene expression, as well as reduced saturation densities of these cells [39]. Wnt signalling might also induce epigenetic changes through histone deacetylation. Expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) was shown to be suppressed by APC, and inhibition of HDAC2 with low-molecular-mass inhibitors reduced intestinal polyp formation in the APC-mutant min mice [40].

### Other functions of APC possibly involved in tumorigenesis

APC has been implicated in numerous other cellular processes, such as cell migration, chromosomal stability, cell cycle regulation, and cell adhesion, which could play a role in tumorigenesis. For instance, truncated, but not wild-type, APC activates the APC-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ASEF), which in turn activates the small G-protein Rac and thereby stimulates cell migration [41]. APC is also connected to microtubules, and it plays a role in the correct establishment of the mitotic spindle [42,43]. Disturbance of APC function by mutations could lead to chromosomal instability (CIN), which is a hallmark of the majority of CRC.

### Target genes and tumour biology of Wnt signalling

There is a long list of identified Wnt target genes, which shows that Wnts can regulate different cellular aspects. Several of the Wnt target genes have a potential role in CRC development. Among the classical targets are the regulators of cell cycle progression, *c-myc* and *cyclin D1*, whose promoters are directly activated by TCF-β-catenin complexes. Wnt signalling might also regulate cell proliferation by inducing expression of growth factors and their receptors, such as the c-met tyrosine kinase. Wnt signalling can prevent apoptosis by up-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins, such as the caspase inhibitor, survivin, and stimulate angiogenesis via up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor. Several proteases capable of degrading extracellular matrix, such as matrilysin/MMP7 and MMP-26, as well as cell adhesion molecules such as CD44 and NrCAM, are Wnt targets that could aid the tumour cells in invasion and metastasis ([37]; see http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html for an updated list of Wnt target genes).

Altogether, it appears that aberrant Wnt signalling, similar to other oncogenic signalling pathways, is not only important for the initial expansion of the transformed cell compartment, but also might be involved in tumour progression. However, the early dysplastic lesions that result from mutations of APC are by definition non-malignant and do not show any of the features of invasive cells, raising the question of how Wnt signalling can act differently at different stages of tumour progression. One possibility is that the intensity of Wnt signalling increases in the course of tumour progression. In line with this, the nuclear staining for β-catenin in colorectal carcinomas often shows a heterogeneous pattern with strong nuclear enrichment at the invasion front and mainly cytoplasmic and membrane staining in the central tumour area. This indicates that high levels of nuclear β-catenin in the tumour margins, as compared with the tumour centre, play a role in the transition to the invasive state of the tumour cells. The molecular basis for this differential distribution of β-catenin is not known, but it can be speculated that signals from the mesenchyme that surrounds the invasive tumour cells might super-activate the pathway by unknown ways [44]. Interestingly, a regulator of epithelial–mesenchymal transitions, Snail, which represses transcription of epithelial genes such as E-cadherin [45,46], is negatively regulated by GSK3β [47]. Moreover, activation of Wnt signalling can increase Snail levels leading to an epithelial–mesenchymal transition and loss of E-cadherin [48,49]. During hair follicle development it was also shown that Wnt signalling, together with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, represses E-cadherin expression [50]. Under these conditions the Wnt-induced loss of E-cadherin might lead to a release of β-catenin which could then super-activate the pathway. This might boost transcription of Wnt target genes involved in tumour invasion. Through these mechanisms the Wnt pathway may not only promote early stages of cancer development, but also regulate tumour progression.
