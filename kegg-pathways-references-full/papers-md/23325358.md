FOXOs: signalling integrators for homeostasis maintenance

Astrid Eijkelenboom and Boudewijn M. T. Burgering

Abstract | Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis and metabolism. In model organisms, FOXO activity also affects stem cell maintenance and lifespan as well as age-related diseases, such as cancer and diabetes. Multiple upstream pathways regulate FOXO activity through post-translational modifications and nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling of both FOXO and its regulators. The diversity of this upstream regulation and the downstream effects of FOXOs suggest that they function as homeostasis regulators to maintain tissue homeostasis over time and coordinate a response to environmental changes, including growth factor deprivation, metabolic stress (starvation) and oxidative stress.

**Homeostasis**  
The ability of an organism, or its constituent cells and organs, to establish and maintain an equilibrium that stabilizes its internal milieu and optimizes its ability to deal with moderate external changes.

**Dauer stage**  
An alternative developmental stage of nematode worms, including *Caenorhabditis elegans*, in which larva are adapted so that they can survive harsh conditions for an extended period of time.

The forkhead box O (FOXO) family of transcription factors regulates diverse gene expression programmes and affects many cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, cell survival and metabolism (reviewed in REF. 1). This conserved family consists of four members, FOXO1 (also known as FKHR), FOXO3 (also known as FKHRL1), FOXO4 (also known as AFX1) and FOXO6, and is a subclass of the forkhead family of transcription factors. FOXO2 was originally identified as a separate paralogue but is homologous to FOXO3, and FOXO5 is only expressed in *Danio rerio* (Foxo3b). Two evolutionarily conserved signalling pathways regulate FOXO activity: in the presence of growth factors, FOXOs are negatively regulated by the canonical insulin signalling pathway through PI3K and protein kinase B (PKB; also known as AKT and c-AKT); and FOXOs are activated in the presence of oxidative stress through Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling. In addition, several other signalling pathways modulate FOXO activity. All FOXOs bind to the same consensus sequence (that is, 5′-TTGTTTAC-3′) and hence can act redundantly. However, specific functions of particular FOXOs have been described, which in part can be ascribed to their tissue-specific expression (for example, FOXO6 expression is largely restricted to neural cells).

In humans, the genes encoding FOXOs were identified as part of chromosomal translocations that occur in acute myeloid leukaemia and rhabdomyosarcomas, suggesting a role for these genes in cancer (for a review, see REF. 2). In addition, the homologue of the genes encoding FOXOs in *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *daf-16*, was genetically linked to *daf-2*, which encodes an insulin type receptor, and shown to mediate the lifespan extension that results from *daf-2* loss. This has highlighted the role of the PI3K–PKB–FOXO signalling axis in lifespan (for a review, see REF. 3). Interestingly, whereas optimal PI3K–PKB–FOXO signalling ensures longer lifespan, deregulation of this pathway contributes to two major age-related diseases, namely cancer and diabetes, thereby positioning FOXOs at the crossroad of ageing and disease. The identification of redox signalling as a second major regulatory input for FOXOs is in agreement with the proposed role of cellular redox control in ageing and disease.

Irrespective of the nature and multitude of FOXO regulatory mechanisms, as well as the various gene expression programmes orchestrated by FOXOs, current understanding is now leading to a unifying hypothesis that FOXOs function in response to environmental changes to maintain homeostasis. Conditional deletion of *Foxo1*, *Foxo3* or *Foxo4* in adult mice induces only a modest neoplastic phenotype that is characterized mostly by increased lymphomagenesis⁴. Instead, FOXO function is mainly revealed under stress conditions, for example in a diabetic background. This notion is corroborated by the role of *C. elegans daf-16* in regulating entry into the Dauer stage under adverse conditions³. Taken together, this argues that the main, if not only, role of FOXOs is to act as homeostasis regulators, particularly in response to stress.

Here, we focus on recent developments in FOXO signalling, including emerging regulatory modes for FOXO activity and novel processes such as protein homeostasis and stem cell maintenance that are regulated by

Insulin and growth factors signal through insulin receptors, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and PI3K and activate phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and PKB. This activation is counteracted by PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue). Active PKB can inhibit FOXO transcriptional activity through phosphorylation at three conserved residues, resulting in cytoplasmic retention of FOXO. Through JNK signalling, oxidative stress induces FOXO nuclear translocation and thereby induces FOXO transcriptional activity. JNK inhibits insulin signalling at multiple levels, overruling growth factor-induced FOXO inhibition. FOXO activation results in cell cycle inhibition, an increase in oxidative stress resistance, induction of apoptosis and a shift in cellular metabolism away from anabolic processes towards catabolic metabolism¹. **b** | Aside from PKB and JNK, FOXOs are regulated by multiple players through several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, but also acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation, with different outcomes for FOXO activity.

these transcription factors (for an earlier review, see REF. 1). We describe the regulation of FOXOs through post-translational modifications (PTMs), nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of both FOXO and its regulators and the mechanisms by which FOXOs regulate transcription. Finally, we discuss that although the role of FOXOs is limited under normal conditions, the key role of FOXOs seems to be to integrate information from multiple upstream signals to enable an organism to maintain tissue homeostasis during stress.

### Upstream regulation of FOXO activity

#### Multiple pathways converge on FOXOs.
Generally, FOXOs are inactive when cells are growing under normal conditions, and this requires negative regulation by insulin and growth factor signalling. Insulin and growth factors act through PI3K to increase the levels of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). These lipids act as second messengers to recruit and activate phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and PKB. PI3K-induced lipid formation is counteracted by the lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue). Active PKB translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates FOXO at three conserved residues, resulting in increased binding of FOXO to the regulator 14-3-3 and cytoplasmic localization of both. The control of FOXO by PI3K–PKB signalling is evolutionarily conserved¹. Following cellular stress, notably when high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated, FOXOs translocate the opposite way into the nucleus and display increased transcriptional activity. This was initially shown to involve JNK-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO. Importantly, JNK regulation of FOXO is also evolutionarily conserved in *Drosophila melanogaster*, *C. elegans*¹ and *Hydra vulgaris*⁵. JNK inhibits insulin signalling at multiple levels by decreasing insulin receptor substrate (IRS) activity and by inducing the release of FOXO from 14-3-3, thereby overriding growth factor-induced FOXO inhibition⁶ (FIG. 1a). However, in addition to the well-established mechanisms of FOXO control described above, numerous other signalling events and other PTMs regulate FOXOs¹,⁷ (FIG. 1b). This increasing complexity has inevitably resulted in a shift from the notion that one PTM triggers one function, and we discuss below how a plethora of PTMs may influence FOXO function in different contexts.

Regulation by energy stress through AMPK. The prominent role of FOXO signalling in ageing and the hypothetical links between cellular redox signalling and ageing has led to a focus on how oxidative stress affects FOXOs. However, other modes of stress can regulate FOXO and many of these also provoke redox changes; it remains to be determined whether oxidative stress unifies the effects of these other stresses.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a central role in cellular energy homeostasis. Activated by a high AMP to ATP ratio, AMPK controls cell growth and energy expenditure by phosphorylating several substrates, including FOXOs (for a review, see REF. 8). AMPK phosphorylates FOXO3 on at least three Ser residues (Ser413, Ser588 and Ser626)<sup>9</sup>. Analysis of a FOXO mutant that is no longer regulated by AMPK indicates that AMPK may steer the transcriptional action of FOXO in a way that activates alternative energy sources and stress resistance. A similar pathway operates in *C. elegans* to confer lifespan extension under conditions of caloric restriction<sup>10</sup>, supporting its evolutionary conservation. AMPK activates FOXO without affecting its subcellular localization, and it is thus far the only signal that induces FOXO activation in the concomitant absence of growth factors or in the presence of additional stress that induces nuclear translocation of FOXO. It is possible that AMPK-mediated activation, when combined with other upstream cues, might also induce a different set of FOXO target genes<sup>9</sup>. Structural analysis of FOXO3 bound to CREB-binding protein and p300 (CBP–p300) suggested that AMPK-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3 at Ser256 increases its affinity for CBP and p300, which might explain the observed further induction of FOXO transcriptional activity<sup>11</sup>.

Genotoxic stress control by CDKs, ATM and MAPKs. FOXOs are phosphorylated and regulated by several kinases during the genotoxic stress response. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulators of cell cycle progression and, through phosphorylation, they control many essential cell cycle components. Both CDK1 and CDK2 phosphorylate the same Ser249 residue of FOXO1 *in vitro* and *in vivo*<sup>12,13</sup>, although the functional consequence of this is unclear. In neuronal cells, CDK1 activates FOXO1 function<sup>13</sup>, but in other cell types, CDK1 induces FOXO1 cytoplasmic localization and its inhibition<sup>14</sup>. CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser249 inhibits FOXO, and this is relieved when CDK2 is inhibited after DNA damage<sup>12</sup>. Thus, the DNA damage response is likely to activate FOXOs via CDKs<sup>15</sup>.

DNA damage also impinges directly on FOXO function through the regulation of other kinases. For example, a proteomic screen identified FOXO1 as a potential substrate for ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM Rad3-related (ATR) kinases<sup>16</sup>, although the consequences of this phosphorylation are unknown. Further studies suggested that FOXO3 indeed interacts with ATM but, surprisingly, this interaction regulated ATM activity rather than FOXO3 (REF. 17). FOXO3 also induces ATM expression in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)<sup>18</sup>, further supporting a functional connection between FOXO and ATM. In addition, DNA damage regulates MAPK family members, including the MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5; also known as PRAK), which phosphorylates and activates FOXO in response to damage<sup>19</sup>. However, whether this contributes to a DNA repair response is unclear. Thus, DNA damage can influence FOXO control in several ways, and the combination of these mechanisms probably determines the final outcome for FOXO function.

Beyond phosphorylation. FOXO regulation by cellular stress involves several other PTMs in addition to phosphorylation. The control of FOXOs by acetylation and ubiquitylation has been well-characterized (reviewed in REFS 1,7). In addition, co-regulators for histone acetyltransferases (HATs), including sirtuins (SIRTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), that regulate the levels of FOXO acetylation have since been identified. For example, SIRT-mediated deacetylation of FOXO can be inhibited by FOXO1 co-repressor (FCoR)<sup>20</sup> or stimulated by FHL2 (REF. 21).

Methylation and O-GlcNAcylation can also regulate FOXO activity. For example, FOXOs bind to both PRMT1 and PRMT6 (the Arg N-methyltransferases that transfer methyl groups to Arg residues in target proteins and histones<sup>22</sup>). PRMT1 methylates FOXO at Arg residues within the PKB consensus site, thereby inhibiting PKB-mediated phosphorylation<sup>23</sup>. The *C. elegans* homologue of PRMT1 also methylates DAF-16, and its deletion increases lifespan in a *daf-16*-dependent manner<sup>24</sup>. The Lys methyltransferase SET domain-containing protein 7 (SET9; also known as SETD7) was also shown to methylate FOXO3 but within the DNA-binding domain (DBD), thereby inhibiting FOXO3 function<sup>25</sup>. Similarly to phosphorylation, O-linked-β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) addition occurs on Ser and Thr residues of proteins, and this has led to the hypothesis that O-GlcNAc modifications could directly oppose phosphorylation. FOXOs are O-GlcNAcylated following increased oxidative stress, and this correlates with FOXO activation<sup>26,27</sup>. The mechanism of activation remains to be identified, however, as the O-GlcNAc-modified residues did not correspond to any known FOXO phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) co-activator 1α (PGC1α), an important metabolic FOXO co-regulator<sup>28</sup>, has been suggested to act as a recruitment factor and/or component of the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)<sup>29</sup>. This would be in agreement with the notion that O-GlcNAcylation serves as a nutrient-sensitive sugar modification (for a review, see REF. 30).

Direct regulation by Cys oxidation. In addition to stress-induced activity changes in upstream FOXO regulatory signalling pathways, as discussed above, FOXOs can directly sense the cellular redox status through reversible oxidation and reduction of amino acids, in particular Cys. Although reversible Cys oxidation occurs during normal signal transduction, progressive oxidation results in irreversible protein damage. Cys oxidation of FOXOs induces binding of CBP and p300 through Cys disulphide bonds and thereby regulates FOXO transcriptional

output<sup>31</sup>. This direct regulation of FOXO and FOXO regulators such as PTEN by cellular redox signalling suggests that FOXOs are important mediators in translating the cellular redox status into biological responses, ranging from cell proliferation to cell death<sup>32</sup> (for a review, see REF. 32).

**Consequences of PTMs for FOXO function.** The high number and large variety of PTMs that have been identified for transcription factors, including FOXOs, has led to the suggestion that combinatorial codes of PTMs exist to regulate transcription factor function. This code would be analogous to the epigenetic code, and it is thought that such a code might determine the binding of cofactors under various conditions to ensure an appropriate transcriptional response. Although an attractive hypothesis, currently there is little evidence for the existence of these codes. However, it should be noted that, apart from the DNA-binding domain, FOXOs (and many other transcription factors) are largely unstructured proteins, and aside from the CR3 domain, the rest of the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain of FOXOs is predicted to be intrinsically disordered<sup>11</sup>. Binding of structured proteins normally proceeds through a ‘key–lock’ mechanism, whereas binding of disordered domains, such as the C-terminal transactivation domain of FOXO, proceeds through an induced-fit model<sup>33–35</sup>. In this scenario, multiple modifications (for example, several phosphorylation events) are required to generate high-affinity binding, and loss of one phosphorylation site may be sufficient to weaken this interaction. Evidence for this has been obtained for other post-translationally modified proteins<sup>36</sup>. For example, binding of FOXO1 to the RAN GTPase requires a patch of multiple phosphorylated residues (between Ser319 and Ser329)<sup>37,38</sup>. Loss of any phosphorylation site within this region impairs RAN-mediated nuclear export of FOXO1. Thus, the many FOXO modifications may serve to mediate an induced-fit binding of FOXO to its regulators. Whether or not this represents a code remains to be determined.

Haploinsufficiency occurs when a diploid organism only has a single functional copy of a gene, and the single functional copy of the gene does not produce enough of a gene product, which leads to an abnormal or diseased state.

at least in the context of metabolic signalling. However, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation all occur on Lys residues and compete<sup>42</sup>, making it unclear what the analysis using mutant alleles of FOXO1 that cannot be acetylated actually measure.

Taken together, the concept of a PTM code (such as an acetylation code for target gene switching) probably does not fully explain the role of PTMs. This is further corroborated by the apparent lack of PTM target site conservation between the different FOXOs. For example, ubiquitylation displays no sequence specificity<sup>43</sup>, suggesting that ubiquitylation *per se* and not the precise Lys residue is required for regulating FOXO. The notion that the regulatory domain of FOXO is intrinsically disordered supports a conclusion that it is the modification rather than its sequence-specific localization that matters. Indeed, JNK phosphorylation sites have been determined for FOXO4, but these phosphorylation sites do not seem to be conserved. This could suggest that JNK is FOXO4-specific, and indeed JNK has been claimed to not regulate FOXO1 (REF. 44). However, JNK regulation towards FOXOs is strongly conserved through evolution, which makes it unlikely to be FOXO4 specific. This level of plasticity in signalling is unlikely to be compatible with the current definition of a code.

**miRNA-mediated control of FOXO activity.** In addition to FOXO control by enzymes that add and remove PTMs, a growing number of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been described to target FOXO expression. By comparing the expression of FOXO1 with that of miRNAs, it has been shown that miR-27a, miR-96 and miR-182 target FOXO1 in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line<sup>45</sup>, and miR-9, miR-27, miR-96, miR-153, miR-182, miR-183 and miR-186 regulate FOXO1 in endometrial cancer and related cell lines<sup>46</sup>. Other miRNAs that have been proposed to affect the genes encoding FOXOs are miR-139 (REF. 47), miR-486 (REF. 48), miR-155 (REFS 49,50) and miR-499-5p<sup>51</sup>. Interestingly, miR-96, miR-182 and miR-183 all regulate FOXO1, FOXO3 and possibly FOXO4. These miRNAs are part of a polycistronic miRNA cluster, suggesting this entire miRNA cluster targets genes that encode FOXOs. In addition, FOXOs also regulate the expression of several miRNAs, including miR-21 (REF. 52), miR-34 (REF. 19), miR-145 (REF. 53) and the miR-106b–miR-25 cluster<sup>54</sup>.

An increase in the expression of a miRNA would only partially reduce the expression of a FOXO target gene. This raises the question of whether reduced expression is sufficient to impair FOXO function. Increased tumorigenesis requires loss of both alleles of all three FOXOs, suggesting the genes encoding FOXOs are in this context not haploinsufficient and, therefore, a partial loss of FOXO expression will not result in phenotypic changes. This implies that the regulation of FOXO protein levels, for example through miRNAs, is possibly only relevant in the context of other processes or the regulation by other signals that impinge on FOXO. For example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease model that is characterized by increased oxidative stress<sup>55</sup>, shows concomitant induction of the miR-96–miR-182–miR-183 cluster and altered regulation of the

Figure 2 | Regulation of FOXO activity by controlled subcellular localization of FOXO and its regulators.

**a** | Stress and insulin signalling are major determinants of forkhead box O (FOXO) nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling. Oxidative stress induces FOXO nuclear localization, which correlates with Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation and monoubiquitylation (Ub). Protein kinase B (PKB)-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO within the nucleus induces cytoplasmic localization of FOXO, and this correlates with increased 14-3-3 binding (not shown). In addition, stress and growth factor signalling also regulate nuclear localization of FOXO regulators, including PKB and JNK, but also sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and MDM2; possible regulators of these translocation events are depicted. Within the nucleus, FOXO may shuttle to promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, which probably depends on FOXO acetylation. Deacetylation by SIRT1 makes FOXO available for monoubiquitylation, which competes with acetylation and therefore might also influence PML-body localization. MDM2 also shuttles between different nuclear compartments, notably the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. MDM2 also promotes polyubiquitylation of FOXO in the cytoplasm. DNA binding of FOXO does not result de facto in gene activation, but it requires additional factors that are also recruited in a dynamic manner (for example, histone deacetylases (HDACs) and β-catenin).

**b** | As both stress signalling and PI3K–PKB regulate the equilibrium between the different cellular locations of FOXO and its regulators, different conditions of redox and/or PI3K–PKB signalling may result in different combinations of regulators that are physically able to control FOXO. Three examples of the possible locations of several factors that can regulate FOXO activation in different combinations are depicted. Although not established yet, suggested outcomes of these different combinations are indicated below each example.

genes encoding FOXO⁵⁶. In addition, miR-155, which modulates protein expression of FOXO3 in T cells⁴⁹, is upregulated in T cells in mice with SLE. Together, this suggests that miRNA-dependent reduction in FOXO expression may be most relevant for regulating immune function in the context of this disease when oxidative stress is increased.

### Spatial control of FOXO and its co-regulators

Whereas it is well-appreciated that FOXOs themselves shuttle between the nucleus and the cytosol, several FOXO regulators also display dynamic localization and the mechanisms that regulate this are becoming clear in some cases (FIG. 2a). For example, SIRT1, which deacetylates FOXOs, also shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Interestingly, SIRT1 is retained in the cytoplasm if PI3K is inhibited, suggesting that SIRT1 nuclear localization requires active PI3K⁵⁷. As binding between FOXOs and SIRT1 is observed during oxidative stress, this could suggest that SIRT1 regulates FOXOs under conditions of acute oxidative stress only when active PI3K signalling also promotes its nuclear uptake. Other classes of HDACs that regulate FOXO acetylation, including class II HDAC4, HDAC5 and HDAC7,

of FOXO3 may also enhance CBP and p300 binding and FOXO3 acetylation ${ }^{11}$. This would suggest that AMPK maximizes acetylation of nuclear FOXOs. FOXOs and their regulators seem to also shuttle between different nuclear compartments. Oxidative stress induces binding of FOXO1 to promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein in an acetylation-dependent manner, and acetylated FOXO1 localizes to PML bodies ${ }^{60}$. PML has several possible functions, one of which is to act as a transcriptional co-activator ${ }^{61}$. Thus, by increasing FOXO acetylation, AMPK may induce the translocation of FOXOs to PML bodies and thereby activate FOXO-mediated transcription within these bodies or promote transcription by allowing the interaction of FOXO with the co-activator PML. AMPK may also enhance specific chromatin acetylation by facilitating FOXO-mediated recruitment of CBP and p300 to FOXO-binding sequences and may simultaneously prevent FOXO deacetylation by sequestering HDACs in the cytosol.

MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates FOXO through ubiquitylation ${ }^{62-64}$, also shuttles between the cytosol and subcompartments of the nucleus. Phosphorylation of MDM2 by PKB at Ser166 and Ser186 induces its nuclear translocation ${ }^{65-67}$. MDM2 can also be retained within the nucleolus by binding to CDKN2A (also known as p19 ${ }^{\mathrm{ARF}}$) ${ }^{68}$. In addition, MDM2 also binds to PML ${ }^{69}$ and thus may be retained in PML bodies following cellular stress ${ }^{70}$. However, PML binding may also localize MDM2 to the nucleolus independently of CDKN2A ${ }^{69}$. By contrast, various MAPKs including the stress-activated p38 and MK2 kinases may, directly or indirectly, relocalize MDM2 to the cytosol ${ }^{71}$.

MDM2 induces either mono- or polyubiquitylation of FOXO. Whereas monoubiquitylation is associated with FOXO nuclear localization and activation, polyubiquitylation results in its degradation and inhibition. The shuttling of MDM2 is therefore relevant to understanding how ubiquitylation regulates FOXO. Proteomic profiling of ubiquitylation sites and comparison to acetylation sites showed extensive overlap between the Lys residues that are targeted by these two modifications in general ${ }^{72}$ and for FOXO specifically ${ }^{42}$. However, the crosstalk between these two PTMs is significantly less frequent on sites that show increased ubiquitylation upon proteasome inhibition, suggesting that monoubiquitylation rather than polyubiquitylation competes with acetylation. Thus, monoubiquitylation probably blocks the interaction of FOXO with PML and its localization to PML bodies. MDM2 promotion of FOXO polyubiquitylation and degradation is ERK-dependent (in the case of FOXO3 (REF. 63)) or PKB-dependent (in the case of FOXO1 and FOXO3 (REF. 64)). Overall, FOXO inactivation occurs in experimental settings that initiate PKB activation and cytosolic localization of FOXO ${ }^{73}$. Because FOXO and MDM2 seem to shuttle in opposite directions during stress and growth factor signalling, this may suggest that both mono- and polyubiquitylation are decreased in normal cells, in agreement with relatively high FOXO protein stability under normal conditions. Depending on the level of stress and whether it is combined with a change in PI3K signalling, increased stress may result in increased FOXO mono- or polyubiquitylation. Inactive PKB itself is localized in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus after activation ${ }^{74}$. In agreement, FOXO is phosphorylated by PKB within the nucleus ${ }^{75,76}$, and 14-3-3, which binds FOXO after PKB phosphorylation, also translocates to the nucleus if it is not bound by cargo ${ }^{76}$. Although the mechanism of PKB shuttling is unclear, SIRT1-induced PKB deacetylation enhances its plasma membrane localization and probably its activation ${ }^{77}$. In agreement with the idea of antagonism between acetylation and ubiquitylation, PKB is also regulated by ubiquitylation. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) induce Lys63-linked ubiquitylation of PKB through the TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase ${ }^{78}$, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) has a similar effect through the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2 (REF. 79). Thus, FOXO and PKB are regulated by a common set of modifying enzymes (for example, SKP2 and SIRT1) and PTMs. Clearly, a detailed comparative and kinetic analysis will be required to fully comprehend how common modifiers such as SIRT1 regulate the PKB–FOXO interaction.

Finally, JNK phosphorylation of FOXO correlates with FOXO nuclear translocation ${ }^{80}$ but also with nuclear localization of another JNK target, $\beta$-catenin ${ }^{81}$, which is also a co-activator for FOXO transcriptional activity. JNK itself also undergoes cytoplasmic shuttling ${ }^{82}$, although the mechanism is unclear. Whether JNK phosphorylates FOXO and/or $\beta$-catenin in the cytosol or the nucleus therefore remains to be determined.

It is evident that, in addition to FOXOs, many regulators of FOXO are under spatio-temporal control. A clear picture has yet to emerge of the functional consequences that this regulation has and requires more detailed analysis. One possibility is that this spatio-temporal control might result in different combinations of FOXO regulators being present within a cellular compartment and thereby allow them to integrate upstream signalling pathways into a specific FOXO-mediated functional outcome (FIG. 2b).

## FOXO output in context

Nuclear localization of FOXO is itself indicative of, but not identical to, transcriptional activity ${ }^{83}$. FOXOs can bind to many sites within the genome as their consensus site is short ${ }^{84}$, but this binding does not necessarily result in gene activation. FOXOs can even regulate gene transcription without binding directly to DNA ${ }^{85}$. Thus, FOXO target genes are not necessarily regulated directly by FOXO, especially when expression changes are measured under steady-state conditions in knockout cells. Irrespective of this, it is clear that FOXOs regulate multiple and diverse processes (TABLE 1). Here, we briefly summarize our understanding as to how FOXO transcriptional programmes are specified in distinct physiological contexts.

(REFS 86,87), the FOXO transactivation domain (TAD) is fused to different DBDs, which highlights the potential of the TAD in regulating gene expression. The TAD of FOXO functions in a classic manner by recruiting HATs and HDACs. Chromatin opening has been suggested as an additional mechanism for FOXO1-mediated transcriptional regulation (for a review, see REF. 88). Binding of FOXO1 to the IGFBP1 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1) promoter disrupts histone–DNA contacts and opens condensed chromatin, possibly because the FOXO DBD resembles the globular domain of linker histones and thus competes with histones for DNA binding. Furthermore, the amino-terminal and C-terminal regions of FOXO1 mediate histone H3 and H4 binding, and the N terminus is required for chromatin opening89. By functioning as pioneer factors, FOXOs might open up condensed regions and thereby allow other transcription factors to bind. Recruitment of HDACs and HATs might also be involved in regulating these functions, as

**Pioneer factors**

Although the precise definition is still debated, pioneer factors are thought to be transcription factors that can initially bind regulatory sequences, allowing binding of other factors by opening compacted chromatin, ultimately enabling transcriptional activation.

a | The relationship between MYC and FOXO is characterized by extensive reciprocal cross-inhibition, in which FOXO and MYC inhibit each other's activity either directly or indirectly. This cross-inhibition results in different outcomes for energy consumption or proliferation. For example, whereas FOXO represses proliferation, MYC promotes this process.

b | The FOXO–β-catenin interaction provides crosstalk between WNT signalling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling. The presence of nuclear β-catenin, involved in T cell factor (TCF) target gene regulation, depends on the activity of canonical WNT signalling (left). FOXOs are activated in the presence of ROS, but a FOXO–β-catenin complex is only formed in the presence of active WNT signalling, with a concomitant shift from TCF to FOXO target gene activation (right).

c | Negative feedback signalling by FOXO is important for regulating the PI3K–protein kinase B (PKB) signalling pathway. Through transcriptional induction of PI3K–PKB pathway components and the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), FOXO activation induces a feedback on PKB-mediated FOXO inactivation, and this in turn possibly restrains FOXO activity.

In general, FOXO and MYC signalling act as reciprocal antagonists at various levels (for a review, see REF. 96) (FIG. 3a). This is also relevant during the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis 97,98. Hypoxia-induced binding of FOXO3 to the promoter of mitochondrial genes inversely correlates with MYC promoter binding, and siRNA-mediated depletion of FOXO3 results in increased MYC binding, suggesting that FOXO3 directly inhibits MYC binding 98. In addition, FOXO3 induces the upregulation of the MYC inhibitor MXI1 (REF. 99). Generally, MYC and FOXOs inhibit each other's activity both directly and indirectly and have opposing effects on processes such as proliferation and energy consumption. Reciprocal inhibition might therefore prevent the detrimental and futile simultaneous activation of both MYC and FOXO.

WNT signalling promotes β-catenin translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus where β-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator for members of the T cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors. However, β-catenin also interacts with other transcription factors, including FOXOs (reviewed in REF. 100). Increased oxidative stress induces β-catenin binding to FOXO 101 and regulates FOXO transcriptional activity. Importantly, this role of β-catenin is evolutionarily conserved, at least in C. elegans. The role of oxidative stress in WNT signalling is at present unclear (for a detailed discussion,

Box 1 | Different stages of stress signalling to FOXO and p53 determine the nature of their crosstalk

Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors and p53 activity are balanced by their shared regulators¹. We propose that the p53–FOXO interaction can be refined into a model of stress progression. Normally, nutrients are not limited, and cellular redox states fluctuate within a certain range that is non-detrimental and is required for cell function (see the figure, part a). This allows low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to regulate signalling. Under these conditions with moderate ‘noise’ fluctuations in redox flux, the activity of shared FOXO and p53 regulators ensures balanced and low activity of FOXO and p53. During short or moderate periods of acute metabolic stress, changes in cellular redox states among others due to food limitation occur. This requires metabolic adaptation to avoid oxidative stress and/or to maintain critical nutrient levels (see the figure, part b). FOXO-mediated gene regulation may restore metabolic robustness. If ROS levels rise and cause substantial but still manageable damage, this will activate FOXO but also other pathways such as p53 to induce repair and reduce ROS levels (see the figure, part c). Importantly, we consider FOXOs to be primarily responsible for the maintenance of metabolic stress and p53 to be primarily responsible for the genotoxic stress response. However, metabolic stress can ultimately also induce genotoxic stress and vice versa, providing overlap between FOXO and p53 function. If damage becomes permanent (which can also occur through other additional sources such as radiation), tumour-suppressive pathways, including senescence or apoptosis, will be engaged by either FOXO and/or p53 (see the figure, part d). How the interaction between p53 and FOXO may affect senescence is unknown. By contrast, FOXO may induce apoptosis in a p53-dependent or p53-independent pathway, although the relative contribution of these two pathways is not known; in tumour cells that lack p53 only FOXO-induced apoptosis occurs. Alternatively, p53-induced apoptosis can occur with concomitant repression of FOXO activity, and this may reduce survival signalling. In tumour cells, the status of deregulation of p53 and/or PI3K signalling will modulate apoptosis induction⁹³,⁹⁴, and the nature of the damage (that is, DNA or protein damage) may also be important for this.

stress, inducing crosstalk between insulin–FOXO and the WNT–β-catenin pathways. As nuclear presence of β-catenin requires canonical WNT signalling, the FOXO–β-catenin complex only forms in the presence of ROS combined with active WNT signalling and so provides a specific crosstalk between WNT signalling and ROS (FIG. 3b).

A conserved mechanism during FOXO signalling is downstream activation of the PI3K–PKB axis, which results in the inhibition of FOXO activity¹⁰⁹–¹¹¹. This negative feedback occurs through a FOXO-dependent transcriptional increase in PI3K–PKB pathway components, including the insulin receptor and IRS (for a review, see REF. 96). In addition, FOXO signalling triggers the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) towards PKB phosphorylation at Ser473, through upregulation of the genes encoding the mTORC2 components RICTOR (rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR) and SESN3 (sestrin 3) and downregulation of RAPTOR (regulatory associated protein of mTORC1)¹¹². Although these mechanisms all promote the inhibition of FOXO signalling, mere increased expression of PI3K pathway components is mostly insufficient to activate signalling unless ligands are present. Therefore, this upregulation probably instead allows a fast and/or increased response to the reappearance of growth factors after periods of starvation.

## FOXOs as homeostatic regulators

On the basis of individual target genes, the transcriptional output of FOXOs can be classified into effects on several cellular processes (TABLE 1). As FOXOs can integrate signalling from multiple upstream pathways that are sensitive to environmental changes, FOXOs could mainly function to respond to, and counteract, environmental changes. This homeostatic role could mediate the response to three main external changes: metabolic stress (starvation); oxidative stress; and growth factor deprivation (FIG. 4). Below, we discuss recent insights into the *in vivo* functions of FOXOs from genetic studies in *C. elegans*, *D. melanogaster* and mice, which suggest that FOXOs are involved in protein homeostasis as part of the metabolic stress response. The effects of FOXOs on stem cell maintenance, combined with the role of FOXOs in cell fate decisions discussed below, also indicate that FOXOs might contribute to tissue homeostasis more generally. In addition, studies of the immune system have revealed specialized and versatile functions for FOXOs.

REVIEW S

Gene expression profiling of Foxo1-deficient AGRP-expressing neurons (AGRP-neurons) reveals a pattern of transcriptional changes consistent with a state of ‘energy sufficiency’. This indicates that FOXO signalling would normally be activated only under starvation conditions to elicit an ‘energy deficiency’ response, influencing membrane potential and firing frequency of AGRP-neurons, possibly through upregulation of G-protein coupled receptor GPR17 (REF. 114).

The detrimental effects of uncontrolled FOXO activation on metabolism have been revealed by many genetic studies, including the role of hepatic FOXO1 in the diabetic phenotypes of insulin signalling-deficient knockout mice (for a review, see REF. 113). Balanced regulation of FOXOs, especially FOXO1, by upstream insulin–PI3K–PKB signalling, with activation of FOXO during fasting, was therefore believed to be essential for normal transcriptional control during a metabolic response. However, PKB has been proposed to mainly limit FOXO1 activity in hepatic cells, and neither seem to be required for normal hepatic glucose production. The hepatic actions of PKB instead are consistent with constraining FOXO1 activity within a small activity range during normal periods of fasting and feeding and only allowing full FOXO activity during prolonged starvation¹¹⁵. Initial studies in C. elegans also suggest that PKB (AKT-1 and AKT-2) primarily functions to antagonize DAF-16 (REF. 116).

FOXOs and protein homeostasis. Protein toxicity results from disrupted protein homeostasis. FOXOs are emerging as factors that protect against protein toxicity through effects on protein aggregation and degradation and also translation.

The pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease correlates with aberrant protein aggregation¹¹⁷. C. elegans models for Huntington’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease show that ageing determines disease onset¹¹⁸ and that *daf-16* expression ameliorates protein toxicity¹¹⁹. Interestingly, in a model for Alzheimer’s disease in which worms express the aggregation-prone Aβ1–42 peptide, *daf-16* expression induces the formation of high molecular weight aggregates and thereby lowers toxicity. Consistent with this, these worms show a *daf-16*-dependent increase in lifespan¹¹⁹. Furthermore, this function of *daf-16* can be uncoupled from its effect on lifespan, as late activation of DAF-16 during adulthood still protects against Aβ1–42-induced toxicity but has little effect on lifespan¹²⁰.

FOXOs have also been linked to protein degradation. In C. elegans germline deficient mutants, DAF-16 is required for the upregulation of the gene encoding the proteasome subunit RPN-6 and concomitant increased proteasome activity¹²¹. Aside from proteasomal degradation, lysosomal degradation through autophagy is a major pathway for clearing damaged proteins. Mitochondrial degradation in muscle also occurs through mitophagy. During starvation, muscle proteolysis through these mechanisms is induced, increasing the chances of survival by both supplementing other organs with amino acids and simultaneously

Figure 4 | FOXOs as homeostasis regulators. Forkhead box O (FOXO) function can be uncoupled from the regulation of individual genes. A more general view is obtained by considering the processes in which FOXOs have been implicated and the common themes in upstream regulation of these processes. Generally, FOXOs are regulated by and counteract external changes that disturb homeostasis, including metabolic stress (for example, starvation), oxidative stress and growth factor deprivation. Some FOXO-induced gene programmes such as cell cycle regulation are part of several homeostatic mechanisms, whereas other gene programmes are likely to underlie more specific responses such as mitophagy.

FOXOs and the metabolic stress response. To survive, organisms need to cope with changes in the availability of nutrients. Energy balance and glucose homeostasis are therefore delicately regulated processes, involving several organs that store, release and regulate crucial nutrients. FOXOs, particularly FOXO1, are highly expressed in the organs that control glucose homeostasis (that is, the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle). Consistent with the idea that FOXOs act as both a responder and regulator during this process, FOXOs are regulated in response to insulin signalling, glucagon and changes in intracellular energy, and they also control transcription during insulin signalling, glucose metabolism, lipid oxidation, mitochondrial activity and hormone production (for a review, see REF. 113). For example, FOXO1 is activated under starvation conditions or low glucose conditions to alter metabolism in a way that ensures glucose homeostasis. FOXO activation in the liver regulates the expression of PEPCK and G6PC, which promotes glucose release under starvation conditions¹¹³. FOXO1 also affects the fasting response through changes in the central nervous system, thereby influencing both behaviour and metabolism¹¹⁴.

reducing muscle strength and thus energy expenditure. As FOXOs are induced by both stress and starvation, it is not surprising that FOXOs activate both lysosomal and proteasomal protein degradation in muscle under various conditions<sup>122</sup>. FOXOs regulate transcription of several autophagy-related genes such as Gabarapll, Atg12, Bnip3 and Bcenl (beclin 1)<sup>122,123</sup>. Interestingly, FOXOs also regulate transcription of PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1 (PINK1), a kinase that regulates mitophagy<sup>124</sup>, suggesting that FOXOs regulate autophagy and mitophagy in parallel. In addition, FOXOs regulate the E3 ligases FBXO32 and TRIM63 (REF. 125), which control muscle atrophy following fasting or denervation<sup>126</sup>. As these ligases are muscle-specific mediators of proteasomal degradation and FOXOs do not seem to activate this mechanism in other cell systems or organs, FOXO-induced regulation of proteolysis could be muscle specific. FOXO activation also induces autophagy in other organs such as the liver<sup>127,128</sup>. In addition to direct regulation of autophagy genes, FOXOs can also inhibit mTORC1 (REF. 112), a major regulator of protein homeostasis, and this provides an alternative mechanism for FOXOs to regulate autophagy. In addition, cytoplasmic FOXO can directly bind and activate the autophagy regulator ATG7 independently of FOXO transcriptional activity<sup>129</sup>. This is unexpected, as under conditions that induce autophagy, such as nutrient stress, FOXOs are shuttled into the nucleus. Given that oncogenic activation of the PI3K pathway results in cytosolic FOXO, this could be one mechanism whereby FOXO can regulate autophagy specifically in tumour cells.

Studies of FOXO orthologues in model organisms have provided initial evidence that FOXOs regulate protein translation. In *D. melanogaster*, FOXO-induced expression of translation inhibitor 4EBP (translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein) globally inhibited translation<sup>130,131</sup>, and this was confirmed by studies in human cells and mice<sup>132</sup>. In *C. elegans*, altered translation upon heat shock in *daf-2* mutants mediated increased thermotolerance in a *daf-16*-dependent manner<sup>133</sup>. Therefore, under certain conditions DAF-16 can influence translation either globally or specifically.

FOXOs in stem cell maintenance. Tissue homeostasis is an established equilibrium that maintains cell mass by balancing cell removal and regeneration. Adult stem cells can provide this regenerative potential. During aging, tissue homeostasis becomes progressively disturbed, in part because the function of these stem cells becomes gradually impaired.

FOXOs have a crucial role in several types of adult stem cells. This seems to also be evolutionarily conserved, as *foxo* also regulates stem cell maintenance in *Hydra vulgaris*<sup>134</sup>. In the mouse haematopoietic system, FOXOs maintain self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)<sup>18,135,136</sup>. HSCs are considered to be quiescent stem cells, and so this role for FOXO is in agreement with their known control of G0 to G1 and G1 to S phase progression (through the control of transcriptional targets including RBL2 (retinoblastoma-like 2), CCNG2 (cyclin G2), CDKN1B, CDKN1C, CDKN1A and CCND2). In addition, FOXOs may protect HSCs from cell death and maintain their self-renewal capacity by mediating resistance to physiological oxidative stress through known downstream targets of FOXO, including SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2), CAT (catalase), ATM and CDKN2A. Indeed, whereas targeted deletion of FOXO in HSCs results in HSC exhaustion with concomitant increase in cellular ROS, treatment with an antioxidative agent could partially rescue this phenotype<sup>18,136</sup>. This role of FOXOs in maintaining the stem cell population over time also occurs in neural stem cells<sup>137,138</sup>. Importantly, a key mechanism by which FOXOs mediate self-renewal and stem cell maintenance seems to be through transcriptional regulation of cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress resistance.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells need to tightly balance their gene expression programme to prevent differentiation while maintaining pluripotency, which is executed by a gene network that is centred around the transcription factors OCT4 (also known as POUF51 and OCT3), SOX2 and NANOG<sup>139</sup>. Surprisingly, FOXO1 is necessary to maintain pluripotency and directly controls OCT4 and SOX2 expression<sup>140</sup>. How FOXO1 is specifically activated in these rapidly dividing cells and how the regulation of target genes is directed specifically towards the regulation of *OCT4*, *SOX2* and perhaps other pluripotency genes is unclear. The involvement of FOXOs in tissue stem cell maintenance and possibly the maintenance of multipotency also suggests that FOXOs control differentiation. Although loss of FOXO3 in HSCs does not alter their differentiation potential<sup>135</sup>, FOXO3-deficient neural stem cells from middle-aged mice were deficient in the generation of different neural lineages<sup>138</sup>.

#### General and specific functions in the immune system

FOXOs have been shown to link metabolism and the immune system in *D. melanogaster*. For example, starvation and insulin signalling trigger FOXO-mediated regulation of antimicrobial peptides, which are part of the innate immune response against pathogen infections<sup>141</sup>. The regulation of these peptides by FOXO seems to be evolutionarily conserved, but the role of FOXO in mammalian immune systems is more complex. Studies using conditional knockout mice showed that, in addition to their role in HSC homeostasis, FOXOs also have specialized functions in lymphocytes (for a review, see REF. 142).

The different cell populations within the immune system need to tightly regulate proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis to counteract an infectious agent while preventing ‘overkill’ which would result in an autoimmune response. As multiple specialized receptors, including B cell receptor and T cell receptor, CD28 and interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), signal through PI3K and PKB to inhibit FOXO, the established function of FOXOs *in vitro* was the induction of immune cell death upon growth factor removal<sup>143</sup>. As might be expected from their functions in other tissues, FOXOs

Box 2 | FOXOs: tumour suppressors or tumour promoters?

Many human tumours exhibit constitutive PI3K–protein kinase B (PKB) signalling, which indicates that forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are tumour suppressors. Indeed, depletion of all FOXOs in adult mice results in increased tumour formation (also reviewed in REF. 2), and FOXOs can inhibit tumorigenesis through senescence induction¹⁵³. However, FOXOs also maintain leukaemia-initiating cells¹⁵⁴,¹⁵⁵. FOXOs could therefore act to maintain these cancer stem cells, analogously to its role in adult stem cells (see the main text). In agreement with this, FOXOs can promote therapy resistance in some tumours, a trait that is thought to be mediated by cancer stem cells (including some cancers that are characterized by aberrant tyrosine kinase signalling)¹⁵⁶,¹⁵⁷. These apparently contradicting functions may be reconciled if the outcome of FOXO activity depends on the state of tumour progression. In cells that are continuously exposed to stress, FOXO activity prevents the establishment of permanently damaged cells by reducing stress levels, clearing damaged cells by senescence, apoptosis induction or possibly through inducing repair mechanisms (see the figure, part a). Because damaged cells can potentially progress to become tumour cells, these FOXO functions are tumour suppressive.

Enhanced constitutive PI3K–PKB signalling favours the establishment of damaged cells through the inhibition of FOXO function, but also by inhibiting apoptosis through other mechanisms. Thus, PI3K–PKB signalling prevents or counteracts the tumour suppressive function of FOXO.

Tumour progression intrinsically generates stress, which is self-inflicted from increased proliferative demand and/or reduced nutrient and/or oxygen supply (see the figure, part b). Oxidative stress can overrule negative regulation by PI3K–PKB to activate FOXO⁸⁰. This may allow FOXOs to induce mechanisms that withstand adverse conditions, namely a stem cell phenotype, or alternatively to escape from adverse conditions through metastasis, which may involve interaction with β-catenin¹⁵⁸,¹⁵⁹. Thus, in effect FOXOs can become part of the problem by acting as homeostatic regulators in tumour cells and by helping the tumour cell to withstand adverse conditions.

are also involved in the survival of naive T cells and the progression from pro-B cells to pre-B cells, probably through FOXO-induced expression of IL-7R¹⁴⁴,¹⁴⁵. Conditional deletions in specific lineages have, however, also revealed unexpected transcriptional functions in B cells and T cells. Such functions include the induction of recombination in B cells (involving the regulation of Rag1 (recombination activating gene 1) and Rag2 recombination genes)¹⁴⁶, homing of lymphocytes to peripheral lymph nodes (involving the regulation of L-selectin and C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expression)¹⁴⁵, differentiation of specialized regulatory T cells (involving the regulation of FOXP3 and interferon-γ (IFNγ) expression)¹⁴⁷⁻¹⁵⁰ and possibly the regulation of antiviral responses in macrophages (through interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) repression)¹⁵¹. Aside from upstream regulation of FOXO activity in immune cells by PI3K, the interaction between FOXOs and SMADs and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling¹⁵² could also be involved in these roles, as FOXO controls the responsiveness to TGFβ during regulatory T cell induction¹⁴⁸.

Conclusions and perspectives

It has become clear that FOXOs mainly function to maintain cellular and organismal homeostasis. Their biological role is therefore predominantly to respond to stress conditions rather than being an essential mediator of normal physiology. To control this homeostatic function, regulation of FOXO activity is accomplished through various PTMs and nuclear–cytoplasmic localization of both FOXO and its regulators. This ensures FOXO activation by metabolic and oxidative stress and by the absence of growth factors. FOXO-regulated processes, such as cell cycle regulation, scavenging of ROS and control of protein homeostasis, mediate the response to these environmental changes. The role of FOXOs in stem cell maintenance highlights their function in maintaining tissue homeostasis over time. In addition, several very specific downstream effects, for example the consequences of FOXO action in the immune system, have illustrated the diversity in FOXO-regulated gene programmes. These functions are probably elicited by cell type-specific upstream regulators and cofactors but also through crosstalk with other pathways.

In compliance with a role for FOXOs as homeostatic regulators that integrate information from multiple signalling pathways and respond to environmental changes, their importance comes mostly into focus under conditions that disturb this homeostasis. Importantly, if cells are forced out of equilibrium through irreversible conditions such as genetic changes that cause cancer, then in effect FOXOs become part of the problem. FOXOs will continue to function in tumour cells as homeostatic regulators and thereby aid tumour cells in withstanding adverse conditions (BOX 2). Homeostasis of tumour cells will have a profoundly different impact on an organism compared with homeostasis of normal adult stem cells. Whereas the former will limit lifespan, the latter will extend lifespan; but FOXOs are involved in the maintenance of both.

Homeostasis also implies a system that is constantly in flux. Therefore single time-point measurements or even end-point measurements do not allow simple conclusions as to whether FOXOs activate or inhibit certain processes. Indeed, FOXOs have been ascribed roles in opposing processes such as cell protection versus apoptosis. The same holds for JNK as an important FOXO regulator. Thus, it is important to analyse FOXO activity and function in a time series to understand when and where during homeostasis FOXOs are performing what function. Only with this detailed analysis of FOXOs will it be possible to understand why either loss or gain of function of PI3K–PKB signalling and their regulation of FOXO activity can result in diseases such as diabetes or cancer and also influence lifespan. As a pivotal regulatory hub in cancer, diabetes and lifespan, the PI3K–PKB–FOXO signalling axis is an attractive point for therapeutic intervention. But to intervene in such delicately balanced processes surely requires knowledge of all the details and that is still where the devil lies.
