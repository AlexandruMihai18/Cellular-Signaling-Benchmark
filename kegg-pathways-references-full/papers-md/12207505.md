3-Amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA, 2) is the precursor of the mC₇N units¹ found in mitomycin² and ansamycin³ antibiotics, such as rifamycin B⁴ and ansamitocin P-3.⁵ The biosynthesis of AHBA proceeds via a novel variant of the shikimate pathway (Scheme 1) which appears to branch off from the normal pathway at the stage of 3,4-dideoxy-4-amino-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (aminoDAHP, 1).⁶ Purification of the last enzyme in this sequence, AHBA synthase, which aromatizes 5-amino-5-deoxy-3-dehydroshikimic acid (aminoDHS) to AHBA, and cloning of the encoding gene, *rifK*, by reverse genetics⁷ set the stage for the cloning, sequencing, and analysis of the entire 95 kbp rifamycin (*rif*) biosynthetic gene cluster from *Amycolatopsis mediterranei* S699⁸ and subsequently of the mitomycin⁹ and ansamitocin (*asm*)¹⁰ biosynthetic genes from *Streptomyces lavendulae* and *Actinosynnema pretiosum*, respectively.

**Figure 1. Substrate specificity of RifN.**

A plausible candidate gene for the nitrogen introduction step has been found in the *rif* cluster, and circumstantial evidence¹¹,¹⁵ suggests that RifK may have a second function in the pathway, that of introducing the nitrogen into a precursor of aminoDAHP, in addition to its well-characterized role as the AHBA synthase.⁷,¹⁷

Recent work by Guo and Frost¹⁸ has shed new light on the issue by demonstrating that the aminosugar, 3-amino-3-deoxy-D-fructose 6-phosphate (aminoF6P, 5), can be converted into aminoDAHP (together with DAHP) or further into AHBA by the action of transketolase from *Escherichia coli*, with ribose 5-phosphate as acceptor, and the recombinant RifH protein or a cell-free extract of *A. mediterranei* plus phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Presumably, the transketolase converted 5 into the imino analogue of erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), which then partly served directly as a substrate for the RifH-catalyzed condensation with PEP to give aminoDAHP and partly underwent hydrolysis to E4P to produce DAHP. As a biosynthetic source of the aminoF6P, Guo and Frost¹⁸ proposed kanosamine (3-amino-3-deoxy-D-glucose, 3), a known secondary metabolite of *Streptomyces* and other bacteria.¹⁹ Since either kanosamine or its isomerization product would have to be phosphorylated to give aminoF6P, this suggests a possible role for the kinase encoded by *rifN*.

To examine its functional activity, RifN was overexpressed in *E. coli* as a His₆ fusion protein²⁰ and purified to near homogeneity on a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). The standard coupled assay for kinase activity was performed as described by Seno and Chater,²¹ measuring NADH consumption at 340 nm. Only kanosamine reacted specifically with RifN + ATP, while all other sugar derivatives examined (glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, glucosamine, and 3-amino-3-deoxy-D-fructose) gave no change in absorbance at 340 nm (Figure 1).

kanosamine was prepared on a preparative scale²² and identified by ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, and ESI-MS analyses²³ as kanosamine 6-phosphate (4). The ¹H NMR in D₂O showed two anomeric doublets at 4.57 and 5.12 ppm (*J* = 7.8 and 3.6 Hz, respectively) in a 1:1 ratio. ³¹P-coupled signals in the ¹³C NMR for C-6 (*J* = 3.6 Hz) and C-5 (*J* = 6.1 Hz) established the position of the phosphate group. *K*ₘ values of 1.9 and 0.39 mM, respectively, were determined for ATP and kanosamine, and *V*ₘₐₓ is 0.6 mmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ at 37 °C and pH 7.2. The enzyme is dependent on Mg²⁺, with Mn²⁺, Co²⁺, and Ni²⁺ able to substitute at 21, 30, and 18% relative efficiency, whereas Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, and Fe²⁺ are inhibitory.

The data identify RifN as a specific kanosamine 6-kinase, which together with the essential nature of the *rifN* gene¹¹ establishes kanosamine and its 6-phosphate as intermediates in AHBA formation. RifL and -M must function before RifN in the pathway, since a *rifN* mutant of *A. mediterranei* was able to complement both a *rifL* and a *rifM* mutant to restore rifamycin B production (data not shown). Keeping in mind the likely biosynthesis of kanosamine,²⁴ this allows us to propose a new pathway for aminoDAHP formation starting from UDP-glucose (Scheme 2). RifL and RifK jointly

convert UDP-glucose into UDP-kanosamine,²⁵ which is cleaved by RifM to kanosamine. Following the action of RifN, a “housekeeping” isomerase (no candidate gene for a dedicated enzyme has been found in the *rif* cluster⁸) must convert kanosamine 6-phosphate into aminoF6P. The conversion of the latter into the imine of-E4P may be catalyzed by Rif Orf15, which is homologous to transketolases⁸ and which may act in concert with the aminoDAHP synthase, RifH, to suppress hydrolysis of the imine. Work is underway to further test this hypothetical pathway.

(20) The *rifN* gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), introducing *Bgl*II and *Eco*RI restriction sites at the two ends, and cloned into the expression vector pRSET-B (Invitrogen) linked to a His₆ tag. The resulting plasmid, pRM74, was transformed into *E. coli* BL21(DE3)-pLysS. The transformants were grown at 37 °C in LBBS medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract; 1% NaCl; 2 M D-sorbitol; 2.5 mM betaine, pH 7.0) with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Protein synthesis was induced at OD₆₀₀ = 0.4 by adding isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.2 mM.

The enzymatic conversion was monitored by thin-layer chromatography, developing with either CHCl₃–methanol–ammonium hydroxide (10:7:3) or *n*-butanol–acetic acid–acetone–H₂O (140:100:33:80). The reaction mixture was passed through Centricon-10 centrifugal filter devices (Amicon) to remove the protein. The filtrate was lyophilized, and the resulting powder was dissolved in a minimum of water, applied to Dowex 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (65 mL, acetate form), and eluted with a linear gradient (0–2 M) of acetic acid. The fraction containing the product was lyophilized to give 4 as a white fluffy powder (yield 57%, 1:1 anomer mixture).

(25) Support for this notion comes from work by Guo and Frost reported in the accompanying communication²⁶ and from the following preliminary observations from our laboratory: (a) RifK and -L when coexpressed in *E. coli* form a complex which can be isolated on a Ni-NTA column when only RifL carries a His₆-tag. (b) The RifKL complex catalyzes NADH formation from NAD⁺ dependent on UDP-glucose, but not dTDP-glucose as substrate. (c) The rate of NADH formation increases when glutamine is added as nitrogen source, asparagine and NH₄⁺ were less effective, and glutamate and aspartate were inactive.
