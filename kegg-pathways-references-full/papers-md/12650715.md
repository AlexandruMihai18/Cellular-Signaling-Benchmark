mediobasal hypothalamus and hence the reproductive cycle. Although, we demonstrated direct actions of estrogen to inhibit GnRH neuronal activity over 15 years ago [9,11], it has been only recently that estrogen receptors have been demonstrated in GnRH neurons [12–14]. In fact, estrogen responsiveness has been conferred to neurons closely juxtaposed to the GnRH cells [15–19

selective [65]. The stereoisomer 17α-estradiol could not mimic the actions of E₂ nor could the non-steroidal agonist diethylstilbestrol. However, these actions of E₂ could be antagonized by the anti-estrogen ICI 164,384 with a \( K_i \) of 0.3 nM. Recently
