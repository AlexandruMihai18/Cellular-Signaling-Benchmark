The ability of the rat corpus luteum to respond to estrogen requires prolactin (PRL), which can stimulate the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER). This review will focus on the signaling mechanisms by which this occurs. Transcription of the genes encoding both ERα (Esr1) and ERβ (Esr2) is stimulated by PRL through the Jak2-Stat5 pathway and Stat5-response elements that are located in each of the Esr promoters. A single nucleotide difference between these two response elements is responsible for the observation that either Stat5a or Stat5b can stimulate Esr1 transcription, whereas only Stat5b can activate transcription of Esr2. The tyrosine kinase Jak2 is required for PRL activation of Esr1 promoter activity; however, additional pathways are involved in PRL-induced Stat5b phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. In addition to the corpus luteum, PRL-induced ER expression might provide a mechanism for fine-tuning the responsiveness of other target tissues, such as the decidua and mammary gland, to these two hormones.

In mammals, the corpus luteum is a transient ovarian endocrine gland with a finite life span and one major function—to produce progesterone—a hormone crucial for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Defects in luteal function resulting in diminished progesterone production have been associated with human infertility, abortion, and menstrual cycle abnormalities [1]. Formation of the corpus luteum is induced in each ovarian cycle following the ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, which is responsible not only for maturation of the oocyte and the process of ovulation but also for the transformation of the follicle into the corpus luteum [2]. Numerous morphological and biochemical changes occur within the cells of the luteinizing follicle after ovulation, which lead to a mature and functional corpus luteum, capable of producing sufficient progesterone to maintain pregnancy. These changes, in addition to the maintenance of luteal function, are under the complex regulation of luteotropic hormones. The crosstalk in signaling between two of these hormones, prolactin (PRL) and estrogen, in the corpus luteum will be the focus of this review.

In the rodent, PRL plays a unique role in both the rescue and continued function of the corpus luteum during pregnancy [3]. Initially, rescue of the corpus luteum is attributed to the twice-daily surges of pituitary PRL induced by mating or manipulation of the cervix. After implantation, the decidua produces a PRL-like luteotropic hormone, termed decidual luteotropin, which acts through the PRL receptor (PRL-R) to stimulate luteal function. The rat decidua can also produce PRL, as does the human and primate endometrium, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and throughout pregnancy [4–6]. By day 10 of pregnancy, the rat placenta secretes two PRL-like hormones—rat placental lactogen-I (rPL-I) from day 10 to 15, and rPL-II later in pregnancy—which can bind to the PRL-R and have luteotropic activity [7].

One of the major functions of PRL in the corpus luteum is to stimulate both estrogen receptor (ER) and LH receptor (LH-R) expression, thereby enabling the corpus luteum to remain responsive to these hormones (Fig. 1) [8]. LH-R expression is necessary to maintain endogenous androgen and estradiol production through the stimulation of P450C17 expression by LH during the first half of pregnancy [8]. The conversion of estrone to estradiol is mediated by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), an enzyme previously characterized as PRL-R-associated protein, which preferentially associates with the short form of the PRL-R in the corpus luteum [9,10]. Although PRL has not been shown to modulate 17β-HSD activity, it does lead to an increase in protein levels, particularly throughout the second half of pregnancy [9]. In addition, PRL prevents progesterone catabolism to an inactive steroid by totally silencing the enzyme 20α-HSD throughout pregnancy [11]. The importance of this gene regulation by PRL is evident because at the end of pregnancy, PRL-R levels drop, leading to an increase in the expression of 20α-HSD, a drastic decrease in serum progesterone levels and subsequent parturition [12].

The requirement for both estradiol and PRL to maintain corpus luteum function in the rat has been demonstrated in experiments in which hypophysectomy and hysterectomy were performed at various days of pregnancy [8]. When both the pituitary and uterus were removed, serum progesterone levels were drastically reduced. Administration of PRL partially restored progesterone production but administration of estradiol alone had no luteotropic effect. However, if both PRL and estradiol were administered, progesterone levels increased significantly over PRL treatment alone. Therefore, the ability of PRL to render the corpus luteum responsive to estradiol suggests that PRL can stimulate ER expression. In fact, in these same studies, it was shown that PRL could significantly

Fig. 1. PRL stimulates both estradiol production and action in the corpus luteum. PRL is necessary for maintaining luteal function by stimulating expression of the LH-R, in addition to ERα and ERβ, thereby enabling the corpus luteum to respond to these hormones with an increase in P₄ production. In addition, PRL downregulates 20α-HSD expression, thereby preventing catabolism of progesterone. The role of LH in luteal function is primarily to increase E₂ production through the upregulation of P450C17 and subsequent androstenedione production (A). PRAP/17β-HSD is a steroidogenic enzyme associated with the short form of the PRL-R and responsible for the conversion of E₁ to E₂ [3].

stimulate the number of estradiol-binding sites, whereas estradiol had no effect on the expression of its own receptor. More recently, it was shown that PRL is capable of stimulating mRNA encoding both ERα and ERβ in the rat corpus luteum and in primary granulosa cell cultures [13]. Taken together, these studies indicate that PRL and estradiol are capable of regulating luteal function synergistically; however, PRL is a prerequisite for estradiol action because it is necessary to induce sufficient ER expression so that the corpus luteum can respond to the luteotropic effects of estradiol.

Whether PRL was capable of stimulating expression of the rat genes encoding ERα (Esr1) or ERβ (Esr2) at the level of transcription, in addition to the signaling pathways involved, was recently investigated [14,15]. PRL can signal through multiple pathways; however, the Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)-Stat5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) pathway appears to be the major pathway by which PRL is capable of regulating gene transcription [16]. In the general Jak-Stat signaling paradigm, the PRL-R dimerizes upon ligand binding, causing activation of the tyrosine kinase, Jak2, which undergoes autophosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates the receptor on tyrosine residues. The phosphorylated tyrosines on the PRL-R and Jak2 become docking sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Stat transcription factors. Jak2 can thus phosphorylate and activate the recruited Stat proteins. The phosphotyrosine residues on the Stat proteins can serve as docking sites for the SH2 domain of another Stat protein, so that Stats can either homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus. By binding to cognate response elements located upstream of their responsive genes, Stat proteins can interact with the basal transcriptional machinery and thereby regulate transcription. Although PRL can activate Stat1 and Stat3, the major Stat activated by PRL is Stat5. Two forms of Stat5, Stat5a and Stat5b, have been shown to transduce PRL signaling. Both Stat5a and Stat5b recognize the same DNA-binding site, or GAS site (γ-interferon-activating sequence; TTCNNNGAA), and can mediate PRL-induced transcription [17]. Several isoforms of the PRL-R have been identified, including the long, intermediate and short forms, all of which have identical extracellular domains but varying intracellular domains [16]. In the rat corpus luteum both the long and short forms have been identified [12,18]. Although heterodimer formation between the long and short forms of the PRL-R has been demonstrated, only the long form of PRL-R is capable of inducing Stat5 phosphorylation and activity [16].

For the most part, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding ERs. Both the human and rat Esr1 promoters appear to be quite complex (see recent reviews on the human and rat ESR1 promoters [19,20]), whereas the regulatory regions have only recently been identified for the human and rat ESR2 genes [14,21,22]. Cloning of both the rat Esr1 and Esr2 promoters led to the identification of putative Stat5-response elements in each promoter [14]. A perfect consensus Stat5-response element (5′-TTCTAGGAA-3′) was located at -180bp in the Esr1 promoter region and a putative Stat5-response element (3′-TTCTGGTAA-5′) with one nucleotide difference (underlined) from the consensus sequence was located at -330bp in the Esr2 promoter region. With the use of transient transfection methods, both the Esr1 and Esr2 promoters were shown to be stimulated by PRL signaling and each of these Stat5-response

elements was shown to be required for induction by PRL, indicating that PRL can stimulate the expression of the *Esr1* and *Esr2* genes at the level of transcription.

Stat5 in PRL signaling to the *Esr* promoters

Although Stat5a and Stat5b are encoded by different genes, they have a high degree of similarity (>90%) at the protein level [23], and contain a single conserved tyrosine residue in the C-terminus (Y694 in Stat5a and Y699 in Stat5b), which becomes phosphorylated by Jak2 in response to PRL and is necessary for regulation of gene transcription. Both Stat5a and Stat5b also undergo serine phosphorylation in response to PRL and other cytokines (S725 in Stat5a and S730 in Stat5b), but the significance of this phosphorylation is not clear. A recent study suggests that growth hormone (GH)-induced Stat5 serine phosphorylation can modulate Stat5 transcriptional activity, but in a promoter-specific context [24]. Mutation of Stat5b S730 to alanine reduced transcriptional activity on the rat Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (*ntcp*) promoter, whereas the same mutation increased transcriptional activity in the promoter of the gene encoding β-casein, which is also Stat5 responsive. By contrast, mutation of the Stat5a S725 did not affect Stat5a transcriptional activity.

Several other key differences between Stat5a and Stat5b have been observed, particularly in the Stat5a and Stat5b-knockout mouse models. Without Stat5a, mammary gland maturation and function is impaired but male patterns of liver function appear to be disrupted when Stat5b is absent [23]. Also with the use of cells from Stat5a or Stat5b knockout mice, it was confirmed that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 preferentially signal through Stat5a, whereas interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-15 preferentially activate Stat5b [25–28]. Interestingly, the reproductive phenotype in these Stat5-knockout mice is not clear. In the single Stat5a or Stat5b knockouts, no reproductive defects were observed, whereas the double knockout was infertile [29]. However, in another Stat5b knockout, the ability to maintain pregnancy was reduced [30]. Administration of progesterone to these mice reversed the reproductive phenotype, suggesting that a luteal defect was present. A similar luteal phenotype was observed in the *Prlr*-knockout mouse [31], suggesting that PRL signaling through the PRL-R and Stat5b is essential for the maintenance of luteal function.

PRL signaling to the rat *Esr1* and *Esr2* gene promoters has provided additional evidence that there are subtle but important differences between Stat5a and Stat5b activity [14]. In COS cells, which express low levels of both Stat5 molecules, either Stat5a or Stat5b could mediate PRL stimulation of *Esr1*, whereas only Stat5b could mediate stimulation of *Esr2*. In support of this finding, endogenous *Esr1* mRNA expression was increased in primary granulosa cells transfected with either constitutively active (CA) Stat5a or Stat5b, whereas *Esr2* mRNA levels were stimulated only in the presence of CA Stat5b. Interestingly, either dominant negative (DN) Stat5a or Stat5b could block induction of either the *Esr1* or *Esr2* promoter in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which express high levels

of endogenous Stat5a and Stat5b. This suggests two possibilities: (1) that DN Stat5a might block PRL stimulation of ERβ through the formation of over-expressed DN Stat5a and endogenous wild-type Stat5b heterodimers; or (2) that overexpressed DN Stat5a could compete with endogenous Stat5b for Jak2 binding and activation. When the Stat5-response elements in each promoter were examined, mutation of a single nucleotide in the *Ers2* Stat5-response element, so that it resembled the consensus *Esr1* Stat5-response element, rendered *Esr2* responsive to Stat5a, suggesting that a single nucleotide could discriminate between Stat5a- and Stat5b-mediated transcription.

These results for the *Esr1* and *Esr2* promoters are intriguing because, in spite of the differences found in the Stat5a-and Stat5b-knockout animals, very few differences have been identified between Stat5a and Stat5b at the level of target gene activation. In one study, it was found that amino acid differences in the DNA-binding domains of Stat5a and Stat5b confers DNA-binding specificity [32]. However, another study found no specific differences between Stat5a and Stat5b preferred DNA-binding sites [33]. For several genes, one GAS site has not been sufficient for Stat5 binding or regulation of expression. Genes such as those encoding the GH-induced serine protease inhibitor, Spi2.1, the IL-2 receptor, α2 macroglobulin, and the immediate early gene cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (*CISH*) contain tandem GAS sites, which seem to act cooperatively in mediating Stat5 activity [34–37]. The presence of tandem GAS sites in numerous genes led to the investigation of Stat5 formation of tetramers. It has been shown that Stat5 forms stable tetramers through protein-protein interactions involving a tryptophan residue conserved in all Stats and a lysine residue in the Stat5 N-terminal domain [38]. Interestingly, only Stat5a but not Stat5b tetramers were shown to bind the multiple GAS sites in the promoter of the *CISH* gene [36]. In this same promoter, Stat5b preferentially bound as a dimer. In the *Esr1* and *Esr2* promoters, however, no tandem GAS sites have been identified, suggesting that this might not explain why Stat5a can induce *Esr1* expression but not *Esr2* expression. More recently, it was shown that epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation of squamous cell carcinoma cells was mediated by Stat5b and not Stat5a, and that low-density lipoprotein induction of p21(WAF) in endothelial cells is also mediated by Stat5b but not Stat5a [39,40]. However, whether these specific differences between Stat5a and Stat5b occur at the level of gene promoters remains to be investigated, as does the exact mechanism by which transcription of *Esr2* is activated only by Stat5b. It is most likely that flanking sequences of the *Esr2* promoter, perhaps in addition to stabilizing protein-protein interactions of other transcription factors, somehow exclude Stat5a binding or promote Stat5b binding to a lower affinity, non-consensus binding site.

Jak2 in PRL signaling through Stat5

It is well established that the PRL-R is associated with the tyrosine kinase Jak2 and activates Jak2 rapidly upon exposure to PRL [16]. Signaling through Jak2 has been

shown to be necessary for both PRL-induced proliferation
of Nb2 cells and regulation of gene transcription through
the transcription factor Stat5. Because PRL induction of
Esr1 and Esr2 transcription requires Stat5, it seemed
probable that PRL signaling also requires Jak2 tyrosine
kinase activity to regulate Esr expression. And indeed,
general tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a Jak2-specific inhibitor,
and a DN Jak2 were all found to prevent PRL-induced
ERα levels for both the endogenous gene expressed in
primary granulosa cells and the gene promoter in
transient transfection experiments [15]. However, a
unique difference between Jak2 activation of Stat5a and
Stat5b was observed (Fig. 2). The Jak2 inhibitor AG490
can prevent PRL-induced Stat5a tyrosine 695 phosphorylation,
nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity.
By contrast, it did not prevent Stat5b tyrosine Y699
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation or DNA binding
[15]. However, it could prevent Stat5b-induced transcriptional
activation of the Esr1 promoter. Only the combination
of AG490 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 prevented Stat5b tyrosine
phosphorylation [15].

These data suggest three novel aspects in PRL signaling
through the Jak–Stat pathway. First, it appears that
Stat5b tyrosine Y699 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation
and DNA binding can be separated from Stat5b
transcriptional activity. Whereas phosphorylation, translocation
and DNA binding are required for transcriptional
activity of Stat5b, they are not sufficient, indicating that
Jak2 activity is necessary in PRL signaling in some
capacity beyond merely inducing Stat5b tyrosine phosphorylation. A very recent and exciting finding suggests
that a specific coactivator called CPAP, a centrosomal
P4.1-associated protein, can interact with Stat5 and

stimulate Stat5 transcriptional activity and, furthermore,
that full CPAP activity might be mediated by Jak2 [41].
This could provide a possible explanation for why Jak2 is
required for PRL signaling to the Esr1 promoter in spite of
a Y699 phosphorylated Stat5b.

A second implication of these results is that PRL can
activate a second tyrosine kinase that can phosphorylate
Stat5b on Y699 without leading to Stat5b transcriptional
activity. Initially, this finding appeared to be similar to the
action of c-src tyrosine kinases, which can induce Stat5b
phosphorylation and DNA binding without increasing
Stat5b transcriptional activity [42]. However, this second
tyrosine kinase activated by PRL is not sensitive to the
c-src inhibitor PP2, but rather appears to be downstream
of PI3K, because only by inhibiting both Jak2 and PI3K
could Stat5b phosphorylation be prevented. One candidate
family of tyrosine kinases would be the Btk/Tec family, the
members of which are activated by PI3K and capable of
phosphorylating Stat1, 3 and 5 [43–45]. Whether these
kinases can be activated by PRL also remains to be
investigated. Whatever the identity of this second tyrosine
kinase, it seems to be incapable of activating Stat5b
transcriptional activity. This could also be explained by the
requirement of Jak2 activity to phosphorylate a coactivator of Stat5. It is possible that this second tyrosine
kinase can phosphorylate Stat5b, as can Jak2, but cannot
phosphorylate coactivators, thereby leading to Stat5b
phosphorylation and DNA binding without full transcriptional
activity.

A third implication is that there is a difference in the
mechanism by which PRL activates Stat5a and Stat5b. It
is apparent that other cytokines and growth factors can
work through different mechanisms to induce Stat5
phosphorylation. One good example is insulin, which can

Fig. 2. Effect of AG490 on PRL signal transduction. PRL stimulation of the Esr1 promoter requires an intact Stat5-response element, in addition to Jak2 activity. AG490 blocks
PRL-induced phosphorylation of Stat5a (indicated by red X). However, AG490 does not prevent Stat5b phosphorylation, nuclear translocation or DNA binding. This
suggests that PRL can activate a second tyrosine kinase, which is capable of phosphorylating Stat5b on the same Y699 residue, but Stat5b is transcriptionally active only
when Jak2 is active. One explanation might be that Jak2 activity is necessary to phosphorylate an additional molecule, such as a Stat5 coactivator, for Stat5b to activate
ERα transcription. Abbreviations: Esr1, gene encoding estrogen receptor α; Jak2, Janus kinase 2; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PRL, prolactin; PRL-R, prolactin receptor; RE, response element; Stat5, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5; TK, tyrosine kinase.

induce tyrosine phosphorylation of both Stat5a and Stat5b [46]. As was the case with PRL, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Stat5a but not Stat5b was prevented by AG490. One of the known pathways activated by insulin is PI3K, which suggests that PRL and insulin could be capable of inducing Stat5b phosphorylation through a novel mechanism that is specific for Stat5b and excludes Stat5a phosphorylation.

### Other PRL and estrogen target tissues

In addition to the corpus luteum, PRL and estrogen share numerous target tissues. Whether PRL is capable of stimulating ER expression and mediating a synergistic effect of these two hormones in these tissues remain open to further investigation. Mouse knockout models provide intriguing possibilities for additional sites of crosstalk between these two hormones [47]. For example, in both the *Esr1*- and *Prlr*-knockout mice, there are defects in maternal behavior, indicating the possibility of a common neural target for these hormones. Furthermore, both show defects in bone mineral density and adipogenesis. In addition, mammary gland development, differentiation and function are impaired in the *Esr1*-, the *Prlr*- and the *Stat5a*-knockout mice. Whether PRL can activate transcription of *Esr1* or *Esr2* in any of these tissues would be of interest. Early reports, which have yet to be further investigated, suggest that PRL can stimulate ER expression in some breast cancers and in liver [48–51]. In some breast cancer cell lines, PRL might be capable of stimulating cell proliferation under particular conditions, but this appears to be independent of ER expression, suggesting that PRL action is probably not mediated through an increase in ER expression [52]. However, the fact that tamoxifen (a selective ER modulator, and an ER antagonist, particularly in breast cancer) can prevent PRL action on breast cancer cells leaves room for speculation on other modes of crosstalk between the pathways.

One additional site of shared PRL and estrogen action, in which PRL regulation of ER expression has been examined, is the uterine decidua. In the human, ER expression increases in parallel with increased PRL production and correlates with decidual growth [53]. More recently, it was shown that both PRL and rPL are capable of stimulating *Esr1* and *Esr2* in the rat decidua of pseudopregnancy [54]. The mechanism of this regulation is currently being explored. However, its importance can be demonstrated in *Prlr*-knockout mice, which display a defect not only in luteal function, but also in decidual function. As mentioned above, administration of progesterone to *Prlr*-knockout mice can restore implantation and successful early pregnancy. However, loss of pregnancy still occurs by mid-pregnancy, suggesting a vital role for PRL in decidual function during later pregnancy. One possibility would be that the loss of PRL-R could lead to a decrease in uterine ER expression and insufficient decidual function to maintain pregnancy.

### Future directions

The ability of PRL to stimulate ER expression in the corpus luteum and in the decidua provides compelling evidence for an important physiological crosstalk between

these two hormones. Although it is apparent that the Jak2-Stat5 pathway is necessary for signal transduction from PRL to the *Esr1* and *Esr2* promoters, numerous questions remain. How does the *Esr2* promoter discriminate between Stat5a and Stat5b or, conversely, how do Stat5a and Stat5b discriminate between one nucleotide in the *Esr1* and *Esr2* promoters? What second tyrosine kinase is involved in PRL-induced Stat5b phosphorylation? Why does this kinase not phosphorylate Stat5a? In which other tissues does PRL signal to increase ER expression?

Of significant interest is the physiological importance of two ERs being regulated differently by PRL through Stat5a and Stat5b. There is evidence of a specific tissue distribution of Stat5a and Stat5b based on the identification of novel promoters for the *Stat5b* gene [55]. There is also evidence that ERβ might modulate estradiol signaling through ERα [56]. One could imagine that, based on the distribution of Stat5a and Stat5b in various tissues, PRL could modulate the levels of ERα and ERβ in those same tissues, thereby enabling a fine-tuning of tissue sensitivity to estrogen. Finally, the tissue and/or cell type-specific regulation of ER expression, not only by PRL but also by other transcription factors, remains a wide-open field and of great clinical importance, especially in the fields of breast cancer, infertility, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.
