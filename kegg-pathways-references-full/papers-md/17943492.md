□ While iron is an essential trace element required by nearly all living organisms, deficiencies or
excesses can lead to pathological conditions such as iron deficiency anemia or hemochromatosis,
respectively. A decade has passed since the discovery of the hemochromatosis gene, HFE, and our
understanding of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and iron metabolism in health and a variety of
diseases has progressed considerably. Although HFE-related hemochromatosis is the most widespread,
other forms of HH have subsequently been identified. These forms are not attributed to mutations in the
HFE gene but rather to mutations in genes involved in the transport, storage, and regulation of iron.
This review is an overview of cellular iron metabolism and regulation, describing the function of key
proteins involved in these processes, with particular emphasis on the liver's role in iron homeostasis,
as it is the main target of iron deposition in pathological iron overload. Current knowledge on their
roles in maintaining iron homeostasis and how their dysregulation leads to the pathogenesis of HH
are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Transition metals are widely distributed and can occur as complexes or more simply as ions in the biosphere. Many metals are known to be essential for life in trace amounts but when in excess cause toxicity. Iron is one such metal, and it is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust after oxygen, silicon, and aluminum. It is an essential trace element required by all organisms except for a few species of bacteria. The obvious importance of iron in biology has made it a subject of much interest, especially its role in health and disease.

An imbalance of body iron can lead to pathological conditions. The most common disorder of iron metabolism associated with iron depletion is iron deficiency anemia, which affects over 30% of the world's population and is especially prevalent in developing countries. Factors such as inadequate iron intake, blood loss, increased iron requirements, and reduced iron absorption contribute to the progression of iron deficiency. At the other extreme are iron overload disorders. The term hemochromatosis was first used to describe the pathology of tissue injury associated with excess

iron deposition, primarily in the liver. Since the discovery of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE),<sup>4</sup> our understanding of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and iron metabolism in general at the molecular level has progressed considerably. This can be attributed to the identification of many new proteins involved in iron transport and regulation, such as the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1),<sup>5</sup> hephestin,<sup>6</sup> transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2),<sup>7</sup> ferroportin (FPN),<sup>8–10</sup> hepcidin,<sup>11,12</sup> duodenal cytochrome b (DCYTB),<sup>13</sup> hemojuvelin (HJV)<sup>14</sup> and heme carrier protein 1 (HCPI).<sup>15</sup>

## II. IRON METABOLISM

### A. Function

Iron is important in numerous biological and cellular processes, including oxygen transport, electron transfer, and DNA synthesis.<sup>16</sup> It is a co-factor in many enzyme systems,<sup>17</sup> especially those containing heme. Although it can exist in various oxidation states, the +2 and +3 valence states are the most important in biological systems. The same high redox potential that enables iron to readily switch between the ferrous and ferric states also makes it potentially damaging to fatty acids, proteins, and nucleic acids in the cell.<sup>18,19</sup> Its high oxidative potential can result in the generation of highly reactive oxygen species via the Haber-Weiss-Fenton reaction. Hence, iron is usually bound with high affinity to specialized proteins, such as transferrin and ferritin, to abrogate the deleterious effects of free iron during oxidative stress. However, in iron overload disorders, such as HH and thalassemia, excess iron that remains unbound by proteins may be present and contribute to their pathogenesis.

### B. Distribution

The amount of iron in the body depends on age, gender, nutrition, and general state of health. There are limited iron stores in the newborn and these gradually increase with age until adulthood. In the healthy human male adult, there is between 35 and 45 mg iron per kg body mass.<sup>16</sup> Two-thirds of total body iron is incorporated into hemoglobin by erythroid cells, while the remaining third is stored in the liver or as myoglobin in muscle or is found in reticuloendothelial macrophages.<sup>16</sup> Only a small fraction circulates in the plasma bound to transferrin or is present in the cellular labile iron pool.<sup>20</sup> Iron levels in women are generally lower due to smaller muscle and liver mass and iron loss through menstruation. Depletion of iron stores may take several years and can occur because of pregnancy, malnutrition, or malabsorption of dietary iron as well as in clinical conditions that cause hemorrhage. As there is a limited capacity for humans to excrete iron, the amount of dietary iron absorbed is tightly regulated. Approximately 1 to 2 mg of iron enters and leaves the body each day.

The Regulation of Cellular Iron Metabolism

Gut Lumen                                      Enterocyte                                    Blood

![Diagram](#)

FIGURE 1 Iron absorption by the enterocyte. Non-heme iron in the intestinal lumen is reduced from Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ by the ferrireductase DCYTB and transported across the brush border via DMT1. Heme iron is taken up via HCP1, and the iron is released by heme oxygenase. In the enterocyte the iron from both sources enters a common transit pool and is either stored as ferritin or transferred across the basolateral membrane by FPN into the bloodstream, where it is oxidized by hephaestin and binds to circulating apotransferrin. Fe₂Tf, diferric-transferrin; all other abbreviations on page xxx.

## C. Iron Absorption

The main site of dietary iron absorption is the duodenum. Absorption is increased when body iron stores are inadequate and decreased when the body is iron-replete. Dietary iron occurs in two forms, heme iron from meat and non-heme iron from plant and dairy products. Heme iron is more efficiently absorbed than non-heme iron. However, only about 10% to 15% of daily iron intake comprises heme iron,²¹ most coming from non-heme sources. The process of iron absorption by the duodenal enterocyte is depicted in Figure 1.

Heme and non-heme iron pass from the intestinal lumen to the enterocyte across the brush border by different pathways.²² Once within the absorptive enterocytes, the iron from each source enters a common intracellular pool and is subsequently transferred across the basolateral surface of the enterocytes into the bloodstream by a common pathway.²³,²⁴ Heme iron is taken up into the enterocyte as the intact metalloporphyrin²⁵,²⁶ via a heme receptor on the brush border of intestinal cells,²⁷,²⁸ HCP1,¹⁵ which is found in distinct vesicles within the enterocyte and on the apical surface. After entering the enterocyte, heme is broken down by heme oxygenase into free iron and biliverdin.²⁹ The released iron then enters the low-molecular-weight pool and is transferred out of the enterocyte in the same manner as inorganic non-heme iron.³⁰ The cell surface receptor and major transport

facilitator for feline leukemic virus, subgroup C (FLVCR), has been shown  
to export cytoplasmic heme in human erythroid cells, ${}^{31}$ suggesting that intact heme may also be transported out of the enterocyte. As FLVCR is highly  
expressed in cell lines from hepatic and intestinal lineages, it may have a role  
in heme export in the liver and intestine.

Non-heme iron absorption by the duodenum occurs as a multi-step process. Inorganic iron occurs mainly in the ferric state in the gut lumen and  
is first reduced to the ferrous ion by a ferrireductase at the apical surface of  
the brush border. ${}^{32,33}$ The reductase property of DCYTB and its high expression at the apical surface of enterocytes ${}^{13}$ support its role as the duodenal  
ferrireductase. However, it has been shown that DCYTB is not essential for  
duodenal iron uptake. In $DCYTB$ knockout mice, the absence of DCYTB  
does not affect body iron stores, ${}^{34}$ suggesting the presence of other brush  
border ferrireductases. Members of the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate protein (STEAP) family of proteins ${}^{35}$ are possible candidates. Once reduced, uptake of iron is achieved by DMT1. ${}^{5,36,37}$ Iron is then  
either stored as ferritin in the enterocyte or transferred across the basolateral surface into the portal blood circulation by the iron exporter FPN. ${}^{8-10}$  
The released iron is oxidized to the ferric ion by hephaestin, a homolog of  
the serum ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (CP), and binds to circulating plasma  
transferrin. ${}^{6}$

### D. Iron Utilization and Recycling

Iron is required for many cellular processes, and by far the highest  
amount is required for erythropoiesis. The heme moiety of erythroid cells  
represents approximately 70% of total body iron. On average, 20 mg iron is  
required for the daily production of almost $2 \times 10^{11}$ red blood cells in the  
bone marrow. ${}^{38}$ Since dietary iron only accounts for up to 2 mg iron a day, the  
majority of iron required for erythropoiesis is recycled and derived from the  
phagocytosis of effete red blood cells, mainly by splenic reticuloendothelial  
macrophages. ${}^{39}$

In common with the process in enterocytes, the process in macrophages  
involves the degradation of heme by heme oxygenase. The freed iron is  
then exported from the macrophages by FPN ${}^{40}$ and binds to transferrin  
in the plasma. Iron from transferrin is taken up by erythroid precursors  
via transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) ${}^{41}$ and is incorporated into hemoglobin.  
Hemoglobin iron is carried in circulating red blood cells primarily for oxygen  
transport. After approximately 120 days, when they reach the end of their  
lifespan, red blood cells are phagocytosed by macrophages, and the cycle is  
repeated. The availability of iron determines the extent of heme synthesis  
in erythroid progenitor cells. When the rate of erythropoiesis is increased,  
dietary iron absorption is stimulated to meet the demand for more iron. ${}^{42,43}$  
However, under conditions of excessive blood loss, iron stores are depleted,

resulting in decreased erythropoiesis, which causes iron deficiency anemia. Evidence suggests that the regulation of erythropoiesis is mediated by the systemic regulator of iron metabolism, hepcidin (described in Section V). Also, high macrophage levels of FPN, which has been shown to act as a receptor for hepcidin, has affirmed hepcidin's role in erythropoiesis.

Muscle cells also require iron to produce myoglobin, which accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of total body iron. The mechanism of iron acquisition for myoglobin synthesis is not well understood. During pregnancy, the requirement for iron is also increased for tissue growth in both the mother and the fetus as well as blood volume expansion. TFR1 expression is high in the placenta, indicating a route of iron import by placental syncytiotrophoblasts, while FPN has been shown to be essential for the materno-fetus transfer of iron. ${}^{8,40}$

### E. Iron Storage

The liver, or more specifically the hepatocyte, is the main site of iron deposition and storage. When the body is iron-replete, macrophages of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow also store some of the iron recovered from the phagocytosis of senescent erythrocytes. Stored iron in hepatocytes and macrophages can be mobilized to meet erythropoietic and cellular demands when body iron levels are low. Most of the iron in the liver is incorporated into ferritin or hemosiderin (approximately 80%), while 5% is associated with transferrin, 2% with heme, and the remainder is found in the labile or transit iron pools. ${}^{45}$

When iron is delivered into cells, it enters an intermediate intracellular labile iron pool where it can be incorporated into ferritin or heme; associated with other non-heme iron protein complexes in the cytosol; or exchanged between the intracellular endosomal, lysosomal, and mitochondrial organelles. ${}^{46,47}$ The exact composition of the labile iron pool is unknown, but cytosolic low-molecular-weight iron complexes, such as citrate, ascorbate, nucleotides, amino acids, and pyrophosphates, have been reported. ${}^{48,49}$

Ferritin is a water-soluble molecule consisting of 24 subunits that forms a hollow sphere that houses up to 4,500 atoms of iron. ${}^{50,51}$ Each subunit is one of two isoforms, the heavy and light subunits with molecular weights of 21 kDa and 19 kDa, respectively. ${}^{52}$ The ratio of heavy-to-light subunits varies depending on cell type. The liver, spleen, and placenta contain ferritin with a higher proportion of light-to-heavy subunits, while ferritin in the heart, red blood cells, and monocytes consists mainly of the heavy subunits. ${}^{53,54}$ Ferritin synthesis is induced by high intracellular iron levels and repressed when iron is depleted. ${}^{55}$ This regulation is mediated through the iron-responsive element-iron regulatory protein (IRE-IRP) as described in Section V. Ferritin is also transcriptionally regulated by cytokines, such as interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$), ${}^{56}$ interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). ${}^{57}$

Ferritin takes up and releases iron from its inner core through hydrophilic channels found in the apoferritin shell, ${}^{51}$ depending on cellular requirements. Iron incorporation into the ferritin core is thought to involve the autoxidation of ferrous to ferric ion, initiated by the process of iron mineralization ${}^{58}$ and/or by the presence of an intracellular ferroxidase, ${}^{59}$ although the latter mechanism remains contentious. The process of ferritin iron release is poorly understood. Current knowledge suggests that the degradation of oxidized ferritin by the 20S proteasome ${}^{60}$ is a likely pathway for mobilizing iron from ferritin to supply cellular iron needs. Ferritin degradation by the proteasome occurs after FPN-mediated release of iron from ferritin in the cytosol. ${}^{61}$

In contrast, hemosiderin is a water-insoluble molecule present in lysosomes and is thought to be a by-product of ferritin degradation through incomplete lysosomal processing; ${}^{62,63}$ it is usually found in the spleen, bone marrow, and Kupffer cells. Both ferritin and hemosiderin are increased in HH and thalassemia. ${}^{54,64,65}$ Iron stored in hemosiderin is more inaccessible and less effective in producing free radicals than iron stored in ferritin, ${}^{66-68}$ suggesting its production has an advantageous and protective effect against oxidative damage in iron overload.

### F. Iron Excretion

As there is no precise mechanism for the excretion of iron, only a very small amount is excreted each day in the urine or feces. ${}^{69,70}$ Iron is also lost from the blood during menstruation, ${}^{71,72}$ while the loss of iron from desquamated skin cells and sweat is negligible. ${}^{73}$ Most of the iron in the body is recycled from senescent red blood cells by the reticuloendothelial cells in the spleen and the Kupffer cells in the liver. ${}^{70}$

### III. CELLULAR IRON TRANSPORT

Iron is present mainly in the ferric form in the biosphere and is virtually insoluble at a neutral pH. At pH 7.0, the solubility constants for iron (II) and iron (III) are $10^{-1} \mathrm{M}$ and $10^{-18} \mathrm{M}$, respectively. ${}^{74}$ Highly specialized and tightly regulated transport systems have evolved to overcome this limitation and move iron from the site of acquisition to the sites of iron utilization and storage in a non-toxic manner. Figures 1 and 2 depict the main iron transport pathways in the enterocyte and hepatocyte, respectively.

---

### A. Transferrin

In healthy individuals, most of the iron required for cellular processes is supplied by transferrin, the major plasma protein that transports iron between the sites of absorption, storage, and utilization. Transferrin is an 80 kDa

FIGURE 2 Iron transport in the hepatocyte. TBI is taken up by a high-affinity TFR1-mediated process and a low-affinity TFR2-mediated pathway. Diferric transferrin binds to TFR1 or TFR2 and is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endosome is acidified, causing release of iron, and Fe³⁺ is reduced by a ferrireductase, possibly STEAP3, to Fe²⁺. Iron is transported out of the endosome via DMT1 and joins the transit iron pool. Apotransferrin and its receptors are recycled to the cell surface. NTBI is reduced on the hepatocyte surface by a ferrireductase and transported into the cell via DMT1 or ZIP14. Iron within the transit iron pool can be stored as ferritin or released by FPN from the cell, where it is oxidized by ceruloplasmin and binds to circulating apotransferrin. Fe₂Tf, diferric-transferrin; all other abbreviations on page xxx.

glycoprotein synthesized mainly by the liver,⁷⁵ with small amounts synthesized by the brain, testis, and mammary gland.⁷⁶,⁷⁷ Transferrin is bilobal in structure and consists of a single polypeptide chain that is arranged to form the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule.⁷⁸,⁷⁹ Each lobe contains two domains, which are joined by a flexible hinge and contain a metal-binding site.⁸⁰ Both lobes bind iron reversibly and with high affinity⁸¹ and can also bind manganese, cobalt, copper, and cadmium with lower affinity.⁸²,⁸³ Iron is coordinated by tyrosine, aspartate, and histidine residues in each of the binding sites,⁷⁸,⁷⁹ with the synergistic binding of a carbonate or bicarbonate anion to arginine and threonine residues.⁸⁴

The stability of transferrin-bound iron (TBI) is influenced by the redox state of iron, the presence of carbonate anion, the conformation of the protein, and the pH of the milieu.⁷⁴,⁸⁵,⁸⁶ The iron-binding capacity of transferrin is pH-dependent; high-affinity binding occurs at pH 7.4, with an affinity constant of approximately 10²³ M⁻¹.⁸⁷ The affinity of transferrin for iron decreases as the pH drops, with virtually no binding below pH 4.5. Transferrin is present in the plasma as a mixture of apotransferrin (iron-free), monoferric transferrin (one atom of iron bound), and diferric transferrin
(two atoms of iron bound), depending on the plasma concentrations of iron and transferrin. Transferrin in human plasma is normally in the range of 22 to \(35 \mu M\) and is about 20% to 50% occupied by iron. The incomplete saturation of the binding sites of transferrin provides a safeguard against an acute increase in plasma iron levels that may occur in certain disease states. This is important in light of the toxicity of free iron. The fenestrated nature of liver sinusoids allows free passage of TBI to hepatocytes and other liver cells, allowing transferrin to function either as an iron donor or an iron acceptor, depending on body iron requirements.

### B. Transferrin Receptor 1 (TFR1)

TFR1 was identified as a specific receptor for cellular TBI uptake. The TFR1 gene contains 19 exons and 18 introns and spans over 32 kb. The coding region of the protein is located in exons 2 to 19. TFR1 is a homodimeric glycoprotein that consists of two identical 90 kDa subunits linked by disulfide bonds. Each subunit contains 61 amino acid residues that form the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain required for receptor endocytosis, followed by 28 residues that anchor the receptor to the plasma membrane, and finally, by 671 amino acid residues in the C-terminal ectodomain, which is important for transferrin binding and receptor dimerization.

The transferrin-TFR1 complex occurs in 2:2 stoichiometry, with each TFR1 homodimer and is capable of binding two molecules of transferrin and delivering four iron atoms to cells if both iron-binding sites of transferrin are occupied. The large ectodomain consists of smaller protease-like apical and helical domains; the N-lobe of transferrin lies between the TFR1 ectodomain and plasma membrane, while the C-lobe lies adjacent to the TFR1 helical domain. The TFR1-transferrin interaction is reversible and is dependent on pH and iron content of transferrin. The affinity constant of TFR1 is between \(10^7\) and \(10^9 M^{-1}\) for diferric transferrin and \(10^6 M^{-1}\) for monoferric transferrin. The affinity is about 2000-fold lower for apotransferrin than for diferric transferrin at the extracellular pH of 7.4. Conversely, the affinity of TFR1 for apotransferrin increases at the endosomal pH of 5.5, while that for diferric transferrin decreases.

TFR1 is expressed in most cells, the exception being mature erythrocytes. TFR1 expression is highest in developing erythrocytes, placental syncytiotrophoblasts, and rapidly proliferating cells and is regulated by the IRE-IRP regulatory system. Synthesis of TFR1 is promoted by low intracellular iron levels and inhibited by high iron levels. Nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide generated by oxidative stress also alter TFR1 expression by regulating IRP activity. Its expression is increased by the presence of transcription factors, such as the hypoxia-inducible factor and transforming-specific protein-1.
The Regulation of Cellular Iron Metabolism

1. TFR 1-Mediated Endocytosis

The almost ubiquitous expression of TFR1 suggests that the receptor-mediated endocytosis of TBI occurs in almost all cell types. The process of receptor-mediated endocytosis is initiated when TFR1 binds transferrin with high affinity at the cell surface. The TFR1-transferrin complex is clustered into clathrin-coated pits and endocytosed into vesicles. The endosomes are acidified by the entry of H⁺ via an ATP-dependent proton pump, causing the intravesicular pH to drop to about 5.5. This acidification process reduces the affinity of transferrin for iron, which is released from transferrin, exits the endosome via DMT1, and enters the cytosolic compartment, leaving apotransferrin in the vesicle still bound by TFR1 at low pH. The apotransferrin-TFR1 complex is recycled to the cell surface, and apotransferrin is released from TFR1, with the return to the physiological extracellular pH of 7.4. The released apotransferrin can then bind additional iron, the receptors are available to bind new diferric transferrin molecules, and the cycle is repeated. In reticulocytes, each cycle takes two to three min, while in hepatocytes, each cycle may take up to 15 min.

The acidification process is essential for iron release from transferrin within the endosome. The steps involved in the transport of the released iron from the endocytic vesicles are less certain. It is thought that iron(III) is reduced to iron(II) by a ferrireductase before it is transported across the endosomal membrane by DMT1. A possible candidate for this enzyme activity is STEAP3, which is present on the endosomal membrane of reticulocytes. STEAP3 mutant mice develop iron deficiency anemia as a consequence of defective endosomal ferrireductase activity. DMT1 is present in recycling endosomes and co-localizes with TFR1. In the Belgrade rat and microcytic anemic mice, a Gl85R mutation in DMT1 leads to impaired iron transport across the endosomal membrane and defective iron uptake by developing erythroid cells. These findings suggest that DMT1 is a major transporter of iron from endosomes.

Another factor affecting TBI uptake is the hemochromatosis protein HFE (discussed in Section V), which has been shown to associate with TFR1 in crypt enterocytes, placenta, and transfected cell lines and to compete with transferrin for binding to the receptor. How HFE affects TFR1-mediated endocytosis and whether it has a role in modulating TBI uptake by liver cells and duodenal crypt enterocytes remains to be ascertained.

C. Transferrin Receptor 2 (TFR2)

In 1999, a second human transferrin receptor, TFR2, was identified and characterized. TFR2 has two alternate spliced transcripts, the α and β forms. The TFR2-α gene contains 18 exons; its mRNA is 2.9 kb in length and encodes a 801 amino acid type 2 membrane-integrated glycoprotein that, like TFR1,

that TFR 2 cannot fully compensate for a decrease in TFR1 expression, possibly due to its restricted localization.

As with TFR1, the interaction between TFR2 and transferrin is pH-dependent. Both transferrin receptors bind diferric transferrin but not apotransferrin at pH 7.4, suggesting that TFR2 may also take up TBI by a receptor-mediated endocytic pathway. However, the affinity of this interaction is 25-to-30-fold lower than that of TFR1 for diferric transferrin. TFR2-mediated transferrin uptake is deposited in multivesicular bodies, suggesting that TFR2 promotes the intracellular deposition of transferrin. This finding awaits confirmation. While TFR1 associates with HFE, it is unclear if TFR2 and HFE interact. An initial study using soluble forms of the two proteins reported no detectable interaction of TFR2 with HFE. However, TFR2 was shown by immunohistochemistry to co-localize with HFE in duodenal crypt enterocytes. It was shown recently that the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated from mouse hepatocytes over-expressing HFE and TFR2, suggesting that an interaction between TFR2 and HFE is possible. An explanation for the conflicting findings is that in the initial study soluble, truncated proteins were used, which may have altered the binding characteristics and structural conformation required for TFR2-HFE interaction.

TFR2 promotes cell growth in iron-depleted conditions. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which do not express endogenous TFR1 and TFR2, showed increased transferrin binding and transferrin-mediated iron delivery when transfected with TFR2. As TFR2 is highly expressed in hepatocytes, it has been postulated that it may be involved in the TFR1-independent uptake of TBI, which has been well characterized in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. HeLa cells over-expressing exogenous TFR2 displayed a biphasic pattern of transferrin uptake, where uptake increased linearly beyond the transferrin concentration required to saturate TFR1, consistent with earlier studies performed in liver cells.

Liver TFR2 expression is up-regulated during embryonic development, while TFR1 expression is highest in embryonic liver, declining to low levels in adulthood, suggesting that TFR2 is regulated by cellular differentiation. In mice, hepatic TFR2 mRNA expression is unaltered by iron status. This is not surprising since, unlike TFR1, TFR2 mRNA does not contain an IRE in its untranslated region (UTR) to which IRPs can bind. In contrast, TFR2 protein expression is increased with iron loading and decreased with iron deficiency, implying that TFR2 is regulated post-translationally. TFR2 protein expression is regulated by diferric transferrin levels. TFR2 protein, but not mRNA expression by HepG2 cells, is up-regulated in a time-and dose-dependent fashion by diferric transferrin. However, apotransferrin or non-transferrin-bound iron had no effect on TFR2 protein expression. Both TFR1 and TFR2 expression are also regulated by stages of the cell cycle and cellular proliferation.
DMT1, also known as DCT1 and Nramp2, was identified in 1995 as a homologue of Nramp1, a protein that confers resistance to intracellular pathogens. Two years later, it was isolated from a rat duodenal cDNA library using an expression cloning system in Xenopus oocytes. The DMT1 gene contains 17 exons spanning over 36 kb. Although originally identified as having two mRNA splice variants, with one isoform containing an iron responsive element (IRE) in its 3'-UTR while the other isoform did not, two additional splice variants of Exon 1 have been reported. As the newer isoforms are not as well characterized, only the earlier isoforms will be described, and the term DMT1 will refer indiscriminately to both IRE and non-IRE isoforms. The presence of IRE isoforms suggests that DMT1 is regulated post-transcriptionally by intracellular iron levels via the IRE-IRP regulatory system. In hepatic Hep3B cells and intestinal Caco-2 cells, DMT1 mRNA expression was increased when cells were iron deficient and decreased when cellular iron levels were increased.

The DMT1 gene encodes a 561 amino acid (IRE isoform) or 568 amino acid (non-IRE isoform) protein with 10 to 12 putative membrane-spanning regions, an extracytoplasmic loop that forms potential glycosylation sites, and a highly conserved extracellular 20 amino acid motif. The two isoforms differ at the C-terminal end of the protein. Native DMT1 protein is approximately 65 kDa in size, but its expression in a variety of cells has been reported to be in the range of 90 to 100 kDa due to N-glycosylation of the protein. DMT1 protein is ubiquitously expressed, with highest expression in the duodenum, brain, kidney, and reticulocytes. It has also been detected in the liver.

Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that, as its name suggests, DMT1 transports a number of divalent metals, in particular iron, zinc, manganese, cobalt, cadmium, copper, nickel, and lead. Transport of the ferrous ion by DMT1 is proton-coupled, with highest activity occurring at low pH (pH ~ 6). This is consistent with the role of DMT1 as an iron transporter in endosomes and intestine, where the pH is about 5 to 6 and DMT1 activity would be optimal. At the subcellular level, DMT1 has been detected on the plasma membrane and also in recycling endosomes, co-localizing with transferrin, suggesting that DMT1 cycles between the endosomal membrane and the plasma membrane and may mediate iron uptake across both membranes. In CHO cells transfected with DMT1, iron is transported by DMT1 at the plasma membrane and is delivered into the labile iron pool. DMT1 also mediates iron uptake when it is over-expressed in HEK 293, Caco-2, and Hep3B cells. The role of DMT1 in iron acquisition has also been demonstrated in two rodent models with severe iron deficiency anemia. The G185R mutation in DMT1 in the microcytic anemic mouse and Belgrade rat is associated with a defect in iron uptake.

by intestinal cells and other tissues<sup>146, 147</sup> as well as impaired iron transport across the endosomal membrane during the transferrin cycle.<sup>115, 116</sup>

In iron overload disorders, such as HH, iron absorption is increased. It has been reported that patients with HFE-related HH have elevated DMT1 levels in the duodenal mucosa.<sup>148</sup> Sly and colleagues reported an up-regulation of DMT1 mRNA expression in their *HFE* knockout mouse model of HH.<sup>149, 150</sup> These results indicate that increased DMT1 expression leads to more iron being taken up from the intestinal lumen across the apical surface of duodenal enterocytes and may contribute to increased iron absorption and the development of iron overload. DMT1 mRNA and protein expression in hepatocytes are also increased in the *HFE* knockout mouse.<sup>151</sup> In rats with dietary iron overload, it has been shown that DMT1 protein expression is increased and directed to the plasma membrane of hepatocytes.<sup>143</sup>

### E. Ferroportin (FPN)

The transport protein that exports iron from cells has been identified and characterized. This protein was independently cloned in three laboratories using different techniques and called FPN, iron-regulated transporter 1 (IREG1), and metal transport protein 1 (MTP1). FPN was identified using a positional gene cloning strategy to study hypochromic anemia in zebrafish.<sup>9</sup> McKie and colleagues identified IREG1 by a subtractive cloning method using a duodenal cDNA library from hypotransferrinemic mice.<sup>10</sup> MTP1 was identified using IRP1 affinity chromatography to obtain IRE-containing mRNA sequences.<sup>8</sup> For the purpose of this review, the iron exporter will be referred to as FPN.

The FPN gene contains eight exons and spans 20 kb.<sup>8, 10</sup> FPN mRNA contains a functional IRE in its 5′-UTR region.<sup>8, 10</sup> It encodes a 570 amino acid protein of about 62 kDa and contains 9 or 10 putative transmembrane domains<sup>8–10</sup> with the N-terminus of the protein on the intracellular side of the membrane. FPN protein is highly conserved among species with 90% to 95% similarity between mouse, rat, and human sequences.<sup>8</sup>

Over-expression of FPN results in increased iron release and depletion of cellular iron from both the cytosolic compartment and ferritin stores.<sup>8–10</sup> The precise mechanism by which FPN mediates iron export is unclear. It is localized to the basolateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes in the villus and exports the iron taken up by the enterocyte from the intestinal lumen.<sup>8–10</sup> FPN expression is highest in macrophages of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow,<sup>8</sup> highlighting the role of these cells in the recycling of iron after hemoglobin degradation from effete erythrocytes. The cytoplasmic location of FPN in macrophages suggests that FPN traffics from an intracellular location to the plasma membrane to release iron.<sup>8</sup> In the liver, FPN is expressed in the cytoplasm of Kupffer cells and cell surface of hepatocytes lining the sinusoids. The presence of FPN in the basal surface of placental

syncytiotrophoblasts<sup>8</sup> that are bathed by the fetal circulation suggests that FPN transfers iron from the mother to the fetus. The cellular localization of FPN in the different tissues is consistent with its role as an iron exporter.

FPN translation is regulated by iron levels through the IRE in the 5'-UTR.<sup>152, 153</sup> However, the observation that both FPN mRNA and protein expression are up-regulated in the duodenum but repressed in the liver in iron deficient mice<sup>8</sup> suggests that other regulatory mechanisms may also be involved. Inflammatory stimuli such as nitric oxide<sup>152</sup> and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)<sup>154</sup> affect FPN levels by, respectively, increasing and decreasing both FPN mRNA and protein expression in macrophages. These effects are most likely mediated by both IRE-dependent post-transcriptional and inflammation-mediated transcriptional regulation of FPN.<sup>152</sup> FPN is also regulated post-translationally by hepcidin, which targets FPN protein and directs it intracellularly for degradation.<sup>155</sup>

Genetic studies in patients revealed that mutations in the *FPN* gene (*FPN*-related HH) lead to iron retention, especially in the reticuloendothelial macrophages,<sup>156–158</sup> reaffirming its role as an iron exporter. Selective deletion of *FPN* in mouse hepatocytes, duodenal enterocytes, and macrophages inhibited iron transport and led to the accumulation of iron in the cells.<sup>40</sup> These findings indicate that FPN is indispensable for cellular iron efflux.

### F. Ceruloplasmin (CP)

CP is a serum ferroxidase and contains over 95% of the copper present in plasma.<sup>159</sup> A role for CP in iron homeostasis has been supported by the observation that patients and animals with aceruloplasminemia present with hepatic iron overload.<sup>160–162</sup> The human *CP* gene has 20 exons and spans about 65 kb.<sup>163</sup> It encodes a 132 kDa glycoprotein containing 1046 amino acids.<sup>164, 165</sup> CP is synthesized predominantly by hepatocytes and undergoes N-linked glycosylation prior to secretion into the circulation.<sup>159</sup> CP expression has also been detected in the spleen, lung, testis, and brain.<sup>164–168</sup>

CP acts in conjunction with FPN to mediate iron release from hepatic cells, as depicted in Figure 2. The released iron is oxidized to the ferric form for sequestration by circulating transferrin. In the perfused dog liver, iron release is promoted by the presence of CP with subsequent conversion of ferrous ion to ferric ion, which is then bound by transferrin.<sup>169</sup> Iron accumulates in parenchymal and reticuloendothelial cells in aceruloplasminemic mice due to impaired iron export, which is reversed by the administration of CP.<sup>162</sup>

## IV. IRON AND THE LIVER

The iron absorbed by the duodenum invariably ends up in hepatocytes. When the body is starved of iron, the metal is mobilized from liver

stores to meet cellular iron needs. In contrast, the liver clears the plasma of excess iron under conditions of iron overload and stores it in ferritin and hemosiderin. However, excessive iron deposition in the liver can lead to organ damage. Thus, it is imperative to study the role of the liver and how liver iron metabolism is altered in the pathology of iron overload disorders such as HH. The increase in hepatic iron levels in HFE-related HH suggests that the rate of iron uptake exceeds that of iron export, leading to an overall net increase in uptake by hepatocytes. The mechanisms of hepatocyte iron transport are reviewed in this section and illustrated in Figure 2.

### A. Iron Uptake by Hepatocytes

It is well established that hepatocytes can acquire iron in the form of TBI and non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI). As already discussed, TBI is taken up by a high-affinity TFR1-mediated process. In contrast, the low-affinity TFR2-mediated TBI uptake by hepatocytes has not been well characterized. Under normal conditions, iron bound tightly to transferrin provides almost all of the iron required by cells. In a healthy individual, transferrin binding sites are only approximately 30% saturated. However, in pathological iron overload disorders, transferrin saturation increases and may reach 100%. This is usually accompanied by a rise in NTBI in the plasma. The liver is capable of clearing these low-molecular-weight iron complexes rapidly, which is important, as they are potentially very damaging. The mechanisms of TBI and NTBI acquisition by hepatocytes are described in more detail below.

#### 1. Uptake of Transferrin-Bound Iron

TBI taken up by the liver is directed mainly to hepatocytes. The presence of TFR1 in hepatocytes has been recognized since 1977. Hepatocytes take up TBI via TFR1-mediated endocytosis of the TFR1-TBI complex into vesicles. Iron is then released from transferrin in the endosome, and the iron-deficient transferrin is transported back to the cell surface. Each endocytic cycle lasts between 4 and 15 min in adult hepatocytes. The iron released is reduced to the ferrous form by a ferrireductase, possibly STEAP3, and may cross the endosomal membrane by DMT1. This high-affinity and low-capacity pathway saturates at low concentrations of TBI. Cytosolic iron is either stored as ferritin or incorporated into mitochondria for heme protein synthesis.

TFR1-mediated uptake of TBI is dependent on the level of TFR1 expression. This is high in fetal rat livers but decreases markedly by the early neonatal stage and is relatively low by adulthood. TBI uptake by hepatocytes is also dependent on the level of hepatic iron. Uptake is increased as a consequence of increased TFR1 expression in iron-deficient hepatocytes. Conversely, TFR1 expression is decreased by dietary iron loading, resulting in decreased iron uptake.
by hepatocytes is also regulated by HFE. The absence of HFE resulted in increased TBI uptake despite a decrease in TFR1 expression.¹⁷⁸ Inflammatory responses involving nitric oxide and IL-6 increase both liver TFR1 expression and iron uptake.¹⁷⁹, ¹⁸⁰ TBI uptake is increased in proliferating hepatoma cells compared with cells in the stationary phase and corresponds to an increase in TFR1 expression.¹³⁴ These observations suggest that TFR1 expression is influenced by the rate of cellular proliferation, stage of development, iron status, and inflammation.

In addition to TFR1-mediated TBI uptake, there is evidence for the presence of TFR1-independent uptake of TBI by hepatocytes and other cells. At least two TFR1-independent mechanisms for TBI uptake have been demonstrated. These mechanisms probably contribute most of the iron taken up by hepatocytes since plasma transferrin concentration is several orders of magnitude greater than that needed to saturate TFR1.¹³², ¹³³, ¹⁸¹ The first involves the binding of transferrin to low-affinity binding sites on the cell surface of hepatocytes followed by the endocytosis of TBI and intracellular release of iron and its subsequent transfer across the endosomal membrane by DMT1.¹⁷⁴, ¹⁸² Binding of transferrin to the plasma membrane is not saturable, even up to a concentration of 10 μM TBI.¹⁸² Kinetic experiments showed that, while transferrin uptake reaches a steady-state, iron continues to accumulate.¹⁷⁴ Like the TFR1-mediated pathway, TFR1-independent transferrin endocytosis and iron uptake are temperature and energy dependent. The addition of weak bases to the uptake system also decreases iron uptake by preventing the acidification of the endosomes, further supporting an endocytic mechanism. However, transferrin uptake is not affected. When extracellular transferrin concentration is increased, iron uptake by hepatoma cells saturates, indicating that iron delivery is a carrier-mediated process.¹³³, ¹⁸³

In the second process, iron is released from transferrin at the cell surface and transported across the cell membrane by an iron transporter. This pathway may involve a ferrireductase step, as demonstrated by studies using specific lipophilic ferrous chelators that inhibited iron uptake by hepatocytes,¹⁸⁴, ¹⁸⁵ suggesting that ferric ion is reduced to the ferrous form outside the cell before being taken up. This second pathway appears to transport NTBI as well as TBI by a common iron carrier-mediated step, as TBI uptake by hepatocytes and hepatoma cells is inhibited by NTBI,¹⁸³ and, similarly, NTBI uptake is inhibited by TBI.¹⁵¹, ¹⁸⁶, ¹⁸⁷ NTBI, however, does not compete with the uptake of TBI by the TFR1-mediated pathway nor by the TFR1-independent endocytic pathway but, instead, decreases uptake of iron dissociated from transferrin at the cell surface.¹⁸³

TBI appears to be also transported by the recently identified TFR2. Overexpression of TFR2 in CHO cells shows that TFR2 mediates TBI uptake, but the affinity of TFR2 for transferrin is up to 30-fold lower than that of TFR1 for transferrin.¹²⁷, ¹²⁸ Studies in HuH7 hepatoma cells¹³⁴ and HeLa
cells<sup>129</sup> suggest that the mechanisms of iron uptake by the TFR1-independent endocytic pathway and that involving TFR2 may be the same. Lee *et al.*<sup>134</sup> demonstrated the presence of a second saturable TBI pathway that reaches saturation at approximately 10 μM transferrin, indicating that there is at least one other type of transferrin-binding site besides TFR1. TBI uptake by this pathway is increased in proliferating cells compared with cells that were quiescent. Interestingly, TFR2 protein expression is also increased with cellular proliferation,<sup>134</sup> suggesting that TFR2 mediates this second saturable pathway of TBI uptake. It is possible that there is another TFR2 pathway where iron dissociates from transferrin at the cell surface and is transported by another carrier.

Cells can also take up TBI by fluid-phase endocytosis. This process is non-specific and takes up molecules from the fluid phase of the endocytic vesicles. They are usually directed to the lysosome and degraded or exocytosed out of the cell.<sup>188, 189</sup> This process accounts for less than 20% of the observed TBI uptake in hepatocytes.<sup>132, 181, 190</sup>

---

## 2. Uptake of Non-Transferrin-Bound Iron

The existence of NTBI was initially controversial but became more widely accepted as better detection techniques were established to quantitate it.<sup>191–193</sup> Plasma NTBI has been detected in patients with thalassemia, HH, and African iron overload.<sup>194, 195</sup> Humans and animals with atransferrinemia or hypotransferrinemia also develop parenchymal tissue iron loading,<sup>196, 197</sup> providing further evidence for the presence of transferrin-free iron compounds. In a healthy individual, NTBI levels are usually less than 1 μM, but in patients with iron overload, they increase markedly, up to 10 μM,<sup>193, 198</sup> although concentrations of over 20 μM have been reported.<sup>199, 200</sup>

Approximately 50% to 70% of NTBI in serum from HH patients occurs as iron citrate complexes.<sup>191</sup> Plasma NTBI is cleared extremely rapidly by the liver, with up to 75% of NTBI removed in the first pass<sup>201</sup> compared to 2% for TBI.<sup>202</sup> The half-life of NTBI in the circulation is less than 30 sec,<sup>203</sup> while that of TBI is 50 min.<sup>202</sup> Liver NTBI uptake is a saturable process that is inhibited by divalent metals, such as cobalt, zinc, and manganese.<sup>201, 204, 205</sup> It is temperature-dependent but neither energy-dependent nor sensitive to iron status.<sup>204</sup> Subsequent characterization of liver NTBI uptake has been performed in isolated rat hepatocytes<sup>206–211</sup> and hepatoma cells.<sup>212, 213</sup> The Michaelis constant for NTBI uptake is variable, depending on the iron ligand (citrate, ascorbate, or nitrilotriacetic acid) and cell culture systems used, and ranges from about 1 to 22 μM.<sup>206, 207, 212, 213</sup> Irrespective of the form of NTBI presented to cells, NTBI is taken up first by binding to the cell surface where iron dissociates from its ligand; the dissociation possibly involves cell surface reduction by a ferrireductase. Iron is then delivered into the cell by a transporter.<sup>208, 213</sup>
The identity of the NTBI transporter awaits confirmation. Several candidates have been postulated, including DMT1, Zrt-Irt-like protein 14 (ZIP14), and calcium channels. Evidence for the role of DMT1 in NTBI uptake is that ferric complexes are reduced to ferrous forms prior to being taken up by hepatic cells, implying the involvement of a ferrireductase. ${ }^{151,213}$ STEAP3 has been detected on the endosomal membrane in the transferrin cycle, ${ }^{113}$ but it is not known if STEAP3 also has a role as the ferrireductase at the cell membrane. Divalent metals such as zinc, manganese, cobalt, and nickel inhibit NTBI uptake by hepatocytes ${ }^{151,210}$ while zinc, cobalt, and cadmium inhibit uptake by hepatoma cells, ${ }^{212}$ suggesting that these metals and iron are transported by the same carrier. Furthermore, an increase in NTBI uptake by hepatocytes from the HFE knockout mouse is accompanied by an increase in DMT1 mRNA and protein expression. ${ }^{151}$

However, the presence of other NTBI transporters in hepatocytes cannot be ruled out, as the loss of DMT1 function does not completely abolish the accumulation of NTBI by the liver. ${ }^{214}$ Antagonists to L-type calcium channels inhibit iron loading by cardiomyocytes, implying their role in NTBI transport. ${ }^{215}$ Whether this mechanism operates in the liver is unknown. ZIP14, a member of the slc39A zinc transporter family, also mediates NTBI uptake by mouse hepatocytes. ${ }^{216}$ The relative contribution of these transporters to NTBI uptake is poorly understood, but it is likely that more than one of these transporters is involved.

NTBI uptake is inhibited by the iron chelators, desferrioxamine and deferiprone, ${ }^{217}$ suggesting that NTBI transport may be regulated by an intracellular chelatable iron pool. Hypoxia-induced stimulation of NTBI uptake has been reported in neonatal cardiomyocytes, ${ }^{218}$ implying that a hypoxia-inducible factor transcriptional regulatory pathway may also be involved. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the regulation of NTBI uptake await further investigation.

The presence of elevated serum NTBI in patients with iron overload has serious implications, as it is readily taken up by the liver. Plasma NTBI is increased in HH patients and in a murine model of HFE-related HH. ${ }^{151,191,192}$ An increase in NTBI uptake by hepatocytes from the murine model has also been demonstrated. ${ }^{151}$ How NTBI contributes to the pathogenesis of liver disease is not fully understood but it is likely to be a major contributor to hepatocyte iron loading.

## 3. Other Uptake Mechanisms

Apart from the uptake of TBI and NTBI by the mechanisms described above, hepatocytes can also accumulate iron from ferritin, ${ }^{219,220}$ heme-hemopexin ${ }^{221,222}$ and hemoglobin-haptoglobin ${ }^{111,223}$ by receptor-mediated processes. ${ }^{224}$
The Regulation of Cellular Iron Metabolism

B. Iron Release by Hepatocytes

Hepatocytes are an important site of iron storage and can release iron depending on body iron requirements. Compared to the relatively well-documented processes of iron uptake, little is known about the mechanisms of iron release by hepatocytes, which have a great capacity to take up iron but are limited in their capacity to release it. Only approximately 20% of iron taken up is released, even in the presence of exogenous chelators.²¹⁷,²²⁵,²²⁶ In the HFE knockout mouse, iron release by hepatocytes is unchanged despite an increase in NTBI uptake.²²⁶ Iron release by hepatocytes pre-labeled with diferric transferrin is dependent on temperature and is increased by the presence of serum, apotransferrin, citrate, and desferrioxamine.²²⁵,²²⁷,²²⁸ When the concentration of chelators, such as deferiprone and desferrioxamine, is increased, the amount of iron released by hepatocytes is similar, indicating that release is limited by the size of the intracellular chelatable iron pool.¹¹¹,²¹⁷ The rate of iron release is also inversely proportional to the levels of oxygen, suggesting that a ferric-ferrous reduction step is involved in the mechanism.²²⁸ Iron release by hepatocytes is also greater in cells pre-labeled for shorter incubation times compared to longer incubation times, indicating that iron is more readily mobilized from an intermediate labile iron pool than iron incorporated into ferritin.²²⁵,²²⁶,²²⁷

The molecular mechanisms of iron release in hepatocytes are poorly understood but are thought be mediated via FPN.⁸⁻¹⁰ FPN has been detected on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes.⁸ Selective silencing of the FPN gene in hepatocytes results in cellular iron retention.⁴⁰ In addition, FPN expression is strongly correlated with iron export in mouse hepatocytes.²²⁶ Iron released by hepatocytes is in the ferrous form and has to be oxidized to the ferric form before it can bind to circulating transferrin. The ferroxidase is thought to be CP, which accelerates iron release by hepatic cells.²²⁹ Hepatocyte iron release is impaired in aceruloplasminemic mice and results in the accumulation of iron in the liver.¹⁶² The precise functions of FPN and CP in the mediation of iron release from hepatocytes remain to be ascertained.

V. REGULATION OF IRON METABOLISM

As there is no regulated mechanism for iron excretion, a tight balance between the sites of iron absorption, uptake, transport, storage, and utilization is essential to maintain iron homeostasis. There are several ways that this is achieved. Expression of molecules involved in iron metabolism is regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally via feedback regulatory mechanisms in response to cellular iron status and other stimuli, such as hypoxia, nitric oxide, and oxidative stress. There can also be regulation by post-translational mechanisms involving subcellular targeting of protein

expression. Proteins involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis and those with a putative regulatory role are described below.

# A. Molecular Regulation of Iron Metabolism

## 1. Post-Transcriptional Regulation

Many proteins of iron metabolism are regulated post-transcriptionally by intracellular iron levels. This involves the cytoplasmic IRP binding to specific mRNA stem loop structures known as IRE. Iron storage and transport proteins have IREs in either the 5′-(ferritin, FPN) or 3′-(TFR1, DMT1) untranslated region (UTR) of their mRNA. Under conditions of iron depletion, IRP binds to IRE at the 3′-UTR of target gene mRNA and increases mRNA stability, causing an increase in both transcript and protein levels. In contrast, IRP binding to the IRE at the 5′-UTR of target gene mRNA decreases protein synthesis due to inhibition of translation. ${}^{103,104,230}$

Two homologous IRPs (IRP1 and IRP2) exist in the mammalian cytosol. IRP1 is identical to the cytoplasmic aconitase that catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate. Like the other aconitases, IRP1 contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster and has aconitase activity. ${}^{231}$ When iron levels are high, IRP1 binds Fe-S clusters, resulting in the loss of its RNA binding ability and the triggering of its aconitase activity. ${}^{232}$ Conversely, IRP1 lacking an Fe-S cluster and, hence, aconitase activity, is able to bind to IRE with high affinity under conditions of limiting iron. IRP2 shares over 60% identity with IRP1 but only functions as an RNA binding protein. There is no aconitase activity detectable in IRP2, ${}^{233}$ and there is no apparent binding of Fe-S clusters by IRP2, although it contains the equivalent cysteine residues required for [4Fe-4S] cluster formation. When cells are iron-deprived, IRP2 RNA binding activity results from de novo synthesis, ${}^{95}$ while in iron-replete cells, RNA binding activity is decreased due to iron-dependent proteasomal degradation of IRP2. ${}^{234}$

The regulation of TFR1 and ferritin by the IRE-IRP regulatory mechanism has been well characterized. In iron deficiency, both IRP1 and IRP2 bind to the IRE in the 3′-UTR of TFR1 mRNA or the 5′-UTR of ferritin mRNA. This stabilizes TFR1 mRNA and protects it from degradation, thus enhancing protein synthesis to increase TFR1 on the cell membrane to promote iron uptake. ${}^{235}$ In contrast, the translation of ferritin mRNA is inhibited, causing ferritin protein levels to decrease. However, when there is excess iron, IRPs fail to bind IRE, as their RNA-binding activity is lost. Translation of ferritin mRNA is stimulated and ferritin protein levels rise, while TFR1 mRNA and IRP2 are rapidly degraded. ${}^{103,104,234}$ Similarly, expression of the DMT1 mRNA splice variants, which have an IRE in their 3′-UTR, is increased when cells are iron-depleted and decreased when cells are iron-replete. ${}^{141}$ TFR2, unlike TFR1, has no IRE and is not regulated via the IRE-IRP pathway. ${}^{7}$

FPN mRNA contains a functional IRE in its 5′-UTR. ${}^{8,152,153}$ FPN protein expression in lung macrophages and epithelial cells is increased by iron

loading 236 and is higher in Kupffer cells from livers of iron-replete mice compared with iron-deficient mice.8 These results are consistent with the regulation of genes with a 5'-UTR IRE by the IRE-IRP regulatory pathway. In contrast, duodenal Fpn protein expression is increased in the duodenum of iron-deficient animals and lower in iron-replete mice, 8,10 suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms may be involved in intestinal cells. However, unlike ferritin, iron loading of hepatoma and intestinal cell lines and lung cells also increases FPNmRNA expression.8,153,236 This suggests the possibility of transcriptional regulation of FPNmRNA by iron levels, although other regulatory mechanisms cannot be ruled out.

The activities of IRP are also regulated by iron-independent mechanisms. Hypoxia inactivates IRP1 RNA-binding activity 237 and increases IRP1 aconitase activity by stabilizing the [4Fe-4S] cluster by post-transcriptional regulation. In contrast, hypoxia activates IRP2 238,239 by increasing IRP2 stability and inhibiting protein degradation. The RNA binding activity of IRP1 is stimulated by nitric oxide 235,240 and hydrogen peroxide.241,242 The loss in aconitase activity mediated by nitric oxide-induced activation of IRP1 is due to the disassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, while IRP1 activation induced by hydrogen peroxide is a result of not only the complete disassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster but also appears to involve other signaling pathways.241,242 In contrast, IRP2 is not activated by hydrogen peroxide.241 The reported effects of nitric oxide on IRP2 activity are conflicting; both activation and repression of IRP2 activity have been reported.242,243

## 2. Transcriptional Regulation

Transcriptional regulation of iron-related genes by iron status, cytokines, and hypoxia has been documented. The expression of DCYTB mRNA, which does not have an IRE sequence, is markedly increased in iron-deprived mice, 13 suggesting that it is regulated by iron status. Cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-1, and IL-6, alter H-ferritin, TFR1, hepcidin, and FPNmRNA expression.244–248 Under conditions of low oxygen tension, the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer of HIF-1α and HIF-1β, 249 is activated. HIF-1 binds to a hypoxia-responsive element on erythropoietin, 250 ultimately leading to an increased demand for iron required for erythropoiesis. Hypoxia has been shown to affect transferrin, TFR1, CP, FPN, DCYTB, and hepcidin (HAMP) gene expression.10,13,250–255

## 3. Post-Translational Regulation

Several mechanisms of post-translational regulation in iron metabolism have been described. FPN protein is post-translationally regulated by hepcidin, which induces the internalization and degradation of FPN, resulting in a decrease in cellular iron release.155 TFR2 protein is regulated by transferrin saturation, and the presence of diferric transferrin increases protein stability
and extends the half-life of TFR2 protein. ${ }^{136}$ High iron levels induce DMT1 internalization from the apical membrane of duodenal enterocytes to cytoplasmic vesicles, suggesting it is post-translationally regulated. ${ }^{256}$ Activation of protein kinase C is associated with the regulation of the endocytic cycle of TFR1. ${ }^{257,258}$ The phosphorylation of TFR1 by protein kinase C reduces cell surface expression of TFR1. ${ }^{259}$

Cellular iron homeostasis is achieved by the integration and coordination of a number of regulatory mechanisms of key molecules of iron metabolism. The discovery of new regulators of iron metabolism, HFE, hepcidin, and HJV, has revealed the complexities of maintaining iron homeostasis and, at the same time, has helped increase the overall understanding of iron metabolism. How these regulators interact with iron transporters at the sites of iron absorption, utilization, and storage to maintain iron balance will be described in more detail below.

### B. Regulatory Proteins of Iron Metabolism

#### 1. HFE

The $HFE$ gene was discovered in 1996 ${ }^{4}$ and belongs to the major histocompatibility complex 1 family. It is located on chromosome 6 and contains seven exons, encompassing approximately 12 kb of DNA. The $HFE$ gene encodes a 343 amino acid protein that consists of a 22 amino acid signal peptide, a large extracellular domain with a putative peptide-binding region ($\alpha 1$ and $\alpha 2$ domains) and immunoglobulin-like domain ($\alpha 3$ domain), a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic portion. ${ }^{4,260,261}$ The first six exons each encode a distinct region of the HFE protein. ${ }^{262}$ There are four cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges in the $\alpha 1$ and $\alpha 2$ peptide-binding domain, and these structures are highly conserved. ${ }^{260,263}$ Several mutations in the $HFE$ gene have been identified in HH, the most common being the C282Y and H63D mutations.

$HFE$ mRNA is ubiquitously expressed at relatively low levels in tissues. ${ }^{4}$ HFE protein is highly expressed by the crypt cells of the duodenum, where distribution is perinuclear. ${ }^{264,265}$ The pattern of intracellular distribution of HFE implies that it is present in recycling endosomes with TFR1 and that a TFR1-HFE interaction in duodenal crypt cells may be important in the regulation of dietary iron absorption. HFE transcript is also highly expressed by hepatocytes, ${ }^{266,267}$ bile duct epithelial, sinusoidal lining cells, and Kupffer cells. ${ }^{268}$ It is thought that HFE in hepatocytes and/or Kupffer cells may have a regulatory role in liver iron metabolism by sensing the level of body iron stores. HFE protein is expressed by placental syncytiotrophoblasts, ${ }^{119}$ tissue macrophages, and circulating monocytes. ${ }^{269}$ The presence of HFE in cells of the reticuloendothelial system suggests that HFE may modulate iron transport and storage in these cells. ${ }^{268,269}$$\beta 2$-microglobulin ($\beta 2 \mathrm{M}$) binds non-covalently to the $\alpha 3$ domain of HFE. This physical interaction is vital for the cell surface expression of HFE. ${ }^{260,261,265,270-272}$ The C282Y mutation in HFE disrupts the disulfide bridge in the $\alpha 3$ domain, preventing the interaction with $\beta 2 \mathrm{M}$ and hence its expression at the plasma membrane. ${ }^{270}$ The mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments and, as a result, fails to undergo late Golgi processing and is rapidly degraded. ${ }^{271}$ In contrast, the H63D mutation has little effect on HFE-$\beta 2 \mathrm{M}$ interaction and on the cell surface expression of HFE. ${ }^{270}$ In $\beta 2 \mathrm{m}$ knockout mice, the lack of $\beta 2 \mathrm{m}$ alters the expression and function of HFE, resulting in iron overload similar to that observed with HH. ${ }^{17,273}$

HFE complexes with TFR1 at the cell surface, implying a role for HFE in iron transport. The formation of the HFE-TFR1-diferric transferrin complex in a $1: 2: 1$ stoichiometry is essential for HFE endocytosis and regulation of iron homeostasis. ${ }^{121,274}$ HFE and transferrin compete for the same binding sites on TFR1, ${ }^{275}$ and both bind to TFR1 with high affinity at $1-5 \mathrm{nM} .{ }^{119,120,265,270,276}$ In the HFE knockout mouse, TFR1 expression by hepatocytes is decreased as a result of iron loading. Hepatocytes from wild-type mice fed an iron-supplemented diet also express less TFR1. However, iron uptake from transferrin by HFE knockout hepatocytes is not decreased despite a down-regulation of TFR1 expression in comparison with wild-type cells with similar iron levels, suggesting that TFR1-mediated iron uptake is regulated by HFE. ${ }^{178}$ HFE has been shown to interact with TFR1 in endocytic vesicles. ${ }^{277}$ Studies using soluble forms of HFE and TFR1 demonstrate that HFE may dissociate from TFR1 in the endocytic vesicle, although the effect this has on the fate of iron released from diferric transferrin is uncertain. ${ }^{276}$

In cell lines over-expressing HFE, the interaction between HFE and TFR1 reduces the apparent affinity of TFR1 for transferrin by 5 to 10-fold ${ }^{120,272,276}$ and decreases TBI uptake. ${ }^{278,279}$ This, in turn, increases intracellular IRP-binding activity ${ }^{278-280}$ and TFR1 expression ${ }^{272,280}$ but decreases ferritin levels, ${ }^{272,278-280}$ indicating that HFE over-expression reduces the labile iron pool. ${ }^{279}$ Most studies to date agree that over-expression of HFE confers an iron-deficient phenotype on cells. Whether this involves a reduction in iron uptake from transferrin without affecting TFR1 cycling ${ }^{279}$ or by either increasing TFR1-TBI endocytosis ${ }^{281}$ or decreasing exocytosis ${ }^{282}$ is unclear. The iron-deficient phenotype may ${ }^{283}$ or may not ${ }^{284}$ be prevented by over-expression of $\beta 2 \mathrm{M}$.

A role for HFE in cellular iron export has been proposed. Over-expression of wild-type HFE in macrophages from patients with HFE-related HH ${ }^{285,286}$ results in an inhibition of iron release and an increase in cellular iron levels. Similar findings have been demonstrated in colonic carcinoma cells. ${ }^{287}$ However, in mouse hepatocytes, the absence of Hfe does not affect iron release. ${ }^{226}$ These results suggest that HFE function may be cell type-dependent.
Until recently, HFE interaction with TFR2 had never been reported. Early studies were performed using soluble ectodomains of HFE and TFR2, and no interaction between the two proteins was observed. However, the co-localization of HFE and TFR2 was described in duodenal crypt enterocytes and, recently, a study by Goswami and Andrews demonstrated HFE-TFR2 interaction in CHO cells and in mouse hepatocytes.

### 2. Transferrin Receptor 2 (TFR2)

Although initially described as an iron transporter (see Section III), TFR2's role in the regulation of iron homeostasis soon emerged. The importance of TFR2 in the regulation of iron homeostasis is supported by findings that mutations in the *TFR2* gene cause an iron overload disorder known as TFR2-related HH. Mice with a mutation in the *TFR2* gene develop a similar phenotype to the human disease.

As mentioned earlier, TFR2 protein expression is regulated by diferric transferrin. Hepatocyte TFR2 protein expression is increased in a *HFE* knockout mouse model of HH with hepatic iron overload and increased serum transferrin saturation. In contrast, expression is decreased in hypotransferrinemic mice that also exhibit hepatic iron overload. This indicates that iron loading of the cells is not sufficient to elicit a response and that interaction of diferric transferrin with TFR2 is necessary to increase TFR2 protein expression.

Calzolari *et al.* recently demonstrated that TFR2 localizes in lipid raft domains on the exosomal cell membrane, suggesting that TFR2 has a role in signal transduction. In the presence of diferric transferrin, TFR2 activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in K562 erythroleukemic cells. The authors postulated that transferrin saturation or iron status is sensed by TFR2, which activates the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway to modulate hepcidin expression in hepatocytes. It is unclear if iron sensing by TFR2 requires an interaction of TFR2 with HFE.

### 3. Hepcidin*

Hepcidin is synthesized and secreted predominantly by hepatocytes and to a lesser extent by the kidneys. Hepcidin expression is regulated by iron, inflammation, and hypoxia. It has been hypothesized to be the stores regulator, a signaling molecule secreted by the liver that communicates with duodenal enterocytes and macrophages to alter iron transport, depending on the level of body iron stores. When liver hepcidin expression is high, iron absorption by the duodenum and iron export by macrophages is decreased

*Editor's note: Hepcidin refers to the protein and *HAMP* is the nomenclature for the gene.

The Regulation of Cellular Iron Metabolism

FIGURE 3 Regulatory pathways of iron metabolism. Hepcidin is secreted by the liver and binds to its receptor FPN to regulate iron release from enterocytes and macrophages and, possibly, hepatocytes. Hepcidin expression is regulated by several pathways, including [1] HFE signaling, [2] TFR2 signaling in response to diferric-transferrin, [3] HJV interaction with BMP/BMPRs inducing SMAD signaling, and [4] inflammatory stimuli inducing IL-6 signaling through its receptor and the STAT3 pathway. Fe₂Tf, diferric-transferrin; all other abbreviations on page xxx.

and vice versa. A schematic illustration of systemic iron regulation by hepcidin is shown in Figure 3.

The *HAMP* gene contains three exons and two introns. Its expression is restricted almost entirely to the liver, although low levels have been reported in the intestine, stomach, lungs, colon, heart, and kidneys.¹²,²⁹²,²⁹³ The *HAMP* gene encodes an 84 amino acid precursor protein that consists of a typical 24 amino acid targeting signal sequence at the N-terminal, a 35 amino acid central pro-region, and a 20, 22 or 25 amino acid C-terminal peptide.²⁹⁴,²⁹⁵ Protease cleavage generates active, cysteine-rich, C-terminal peptides of 20–25 residues.²⁹⁴ The eight cysteines present in these peptides form four disulfide bridges that impart a rigid and tight structure.²⁹⁴ It has recently been shown that the N-terminal sequence is necessary for normal hepcidin function.²⁹⁶

The precise role of hepcidin in iron metabolism is being actively investigated but remains incompletely understood. Hepcidin levels are normally elevated when hepatic iron loading occurs and reduced with iron deficiency.²⁹²,²⁹⁷ However, inappropriately low levels of liver hepcidin are

observed in patients and mouse models of HFE-related HH298–300 and TFR 2-related HH,301,302 demonstrating the lack of up-regulation of hepcidin despite increased liver iron stores. Hepcidin is also undetectable in HJV- or hepcidin-related HH.14,303–306 A decrease in the level of hepatic hepcidin promotes dietary iron absorption, which might explain in part why mutations in HFE and TFR 2 lead to iron overload. Similarly, iron absorption is inhibited by the administration of hepcidin in mice.307 When transgenic mice over-expressing hepcidin are crossed with *HFE* knockout mice, their offspring do not accumulate excess iron, indicating that the presence of hepcidin abrogates hepatic iron loading in the *HFE* knockout mice.308

The binding of hepcidin to FPN results in FPN internalization and degradation.155 The hepcidin-FPN interaction implies that when hepcidin levels are low, such as in iron-depleted states or in HH, FPN expression and iron release by macrophages and duodenal crypt cells are up-regulated. The reverse also holds true; that is, when hepcidin levels are high, FPN expression and iron release by these cells are down-regulated. Whether hepcidin acts on FPN in hepatocytes in an autocrine manner remains to be determined. In iron-deficient rodents, a reduction in hepcidin levels was accompanied by an increase in FPN levels in duodenal crypt enterocytes,297,309 while hepcidin decreased cell surface expression of FPN in macrophages.310 There is also evidence to suggest that hepcidin may act directly on mature villus enterocytes in the duodenum to modulate the expression of duodenal iron transporters. In rats with phenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis and anemia, hepatic hepcidin expression decreased after a lag of three days, which corresponded to an increase in duodenal expression of DMT1, DCYTB, and FPN. A subsequent increase in iron absorption was observed within 24 h in these animals.43 These delayed responses to increased erythropoiesis suggest that hepcidin acts directly on mature villus enterocytes rather than on the crypt-programming enterocytes.

Hepcidin has antimicrobial properties and disrupts microbial membranes11,12 at a range of 10 to 30 μM. Hepcidin expression is induced by inflammation and infection. *HAMP* mRNA expression is enhanced by LPS-induced inflammation,311,312 as well as by the inflammatory cytokines IL-6244,247,248 and IL-1.247 The acute phase response occurs independently from the effects of HFE, TFR 2, and β2M.244,313 This is supported by studies in TFR 2-mutant mice, where the administration of LPS or IL-6 stimulates hepcidin expression301 which suggests that HFE and TFR 2 are upstream of hepcidin in the regulation of iron homeostasis. In contrast, hepcidin expression is repressed by hypoxia.255,314 Hypoxia-induced repression of *HAMP* gene expression in rats resulted in increased luminal iron uptake and transfer into the circulation as well as increased numbers of red blood cells and hemoglobin levels,314 indicating that erythropoietic activity was increased. The above studies suggest that hepcidin has multifunctional roles in inflammation, iron metabolism, and erythropoiesis, adding support to
the possibility that hepcidin could be both the stores regulator and erythropoietic regulator (described below).

How HAMP gene expression responds to body iron stores is still unknown, but it is not regulated by the IRE-IRP pathway since there is no IRE in its transcript. The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α is highly expressed in the liver and seems to stimulate hepcidin expression, while the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-α represses hepcidin expression.³¹⁵ Inflammation-induced hepcidin expression requires the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) activation and the binding of STAT 3 to a STAT 3-binding motif in the hepcidin promoter.³¹⁶ Basal hepcidin expression is regulated through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and SMAD protein (see Glossary) signaling pathways.³¹⁷ When BMP binds to two Type I bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPR), association with two Type II BMPRs is induced. This activated phosphorylated signaling complex in turn phosphorylates SMAD1, 5, and 8, leading to the interaction with the common mediator SMAD4, which is translocated to the nucleus to activate transcription.³¹⁸,³¹⁹ Liver-specific silencing of SMAD4 prevents hepcidin synthesis, and iron loading ensues,³¹⁷ affirming the importance of the BMP/SMAD protein signaling pathway in the regulation of hepcidin synthesis. The stimulation of hepcidin by BMPs does not appear to involve HFE, TFR2, or IL-6³²⁰ but may involve HJV.³²¹

### 4. Hemojuvelin (HJV)

HJV is part of the repulsive guidance molecules (RGM) family. HJV gene mutations, like mutations in the HAMP gene, are linked to the pathogenesis of juvenile hemochromatosis.¹⁴ HJV spans over 4.2 kb and generates several alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms, the longest of which encodes a 426 amino acid peptide with homology to the RGM in retinal cells.¹⁴,³²² HJV has multiple protein motifs, which suggests that it could function as a membrane-bound receptor or be secreted as a polypeptide hormone.¹⁴,³²³,³²⁴

Although the precise function of HJV is still unknown, it appears to be linked with hepcidin expression. Low levels of urinary hepcidin have been reported in patients with HJV mutations, indicating that it has an inhibitory effect on hepcidin expression.¹⁴ Also, suppression of HJV mRNA expression using siRNA is accompanied by a decrease in HAMP mRNA expression in hepatoma cells, indicating that cellular HJV regulates hepcidin synthesis.³²³ HJV expression is regulated by inflammation but not erythropoiesis or iron.³²⁵

The expression of HJV is restricted to the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle and is similar to that of hepcidin, suggesting that HJV is another key player in the hepcidin regulatory pathway. HJV has recently been shown to be a co-receptor for BMP2 and enhances BMP signaling. BMP increases hepatocyte hepcidin expression, and mutations in HJV cause impaired BMP signaling.³²¹ HJV has also been shown to bind to neogenin, a high-affinity membrane receptor involved in cellular signaling,³²⁴ which is also expressed
in the liver.³²⁶ HJV-neogenin interaction induces iron uptake in cells over-
expressing HJV.³²⁴

Mouse models of HJV-related HH have been generated by targeted dis-
ruption of the *HJV* gene.³⁰⁵, 3⁰⁶ These animals load much earlier with iron
and to a greater extent than *HFE* knockout mice and bear the hallmarks
of the disease seen in patients. These animal models will be useful tools in
determining the importance of HJV in iron homeostasis.

## C. Regulation of Dietary Iron Absorption

### 1. Erythropoietic Regulator

Iron absorption is regulated by several mechanisms. One of these regu-
latory pathways is influenced by erythropoiesis and gives rise to the concept
of the *erythropoietic regulator*.³²⁷ The process is independent of total body iron
stores but is affected by the rate of red blood cell formation in the erythroid
marrow. The *erythropoietic regulator* has a greater potential to stimulate iron
absorption than the *stores regulator*.³²⁸ Stimulation of iron absorption by the
*erythropoietic regulator* occurs when there is a massive loss of iron through
hemorrhage or ineffective erythropoiesis, where immature erythrocytes are
destroyed in the bone marrow.³²⁹, 3³⁰ When there is a high demand for ery-
throid iron, over 20 mg iron per day may be absorbed by an individual with
iron deficiency anemia.³²⁷ The mechanism is still poorly understood but may
involve a soluble signal that can traverse the plasma from the bone marrow
to the duodenum.¹⁶

Recent studies postulate that hepcidin is the *erythropoietic regulator*. Hep-
atic *HAMP* gene expression decreases in response to anemia.²⁵⁵ Conse-
quently, hepcidin synthesis decreases and iron absorption is stimulated to
increase iron levels in the circulation to meet the demands of erythro-
poiesis. Another likely candidate for the *erythropoietic regulator* is the solu-
ble or serum TFR1 (sTFR1) that is derived from the erythroid marrow.³³¹
Soluble TFR1 levels increase during iron deficiency and diminish with iron
loading,³³² demonstrating a strong correlation between sTFR1 levels and iron
absorption.³³³

### 2. Mucosal Block

A second regulatory mechanism is termed *mucosal block*³³⁴ and occurs
when a large amount of dietary iron is ingested. High oral doses of iron re-
duce further absorption of ingested iron by the duodenum for several days,
and this process can take place even during systemic iron deficiency.³³⁰ The
expression of DMT1²⁹⁷, 3³⁵ and DCYTB²⁹⁷ are rapidly down-regulated, but
neither FPN nor hephestin are affected when a large dose of iron is admin-
istered to rats,²⁹⁷ indicating that the “block” on iron absorption occurs at
the apical surface of the enterocyte (iron uptake step) and not at the baso-
lateral surface (iron transfer into the bloodstream). The down-regulation of
DMT1 and DCYTB may possibly be due to a rise in intracellular iron in the enterocytes that is mirrored by an increase in ferritin levels.

### 3. Iron Sensing (Stores Regulator)

The last regulatory mechanism senses total body iron levels instead of the amount of dietary iron ingested and is mediated by a putative stores regulator.³²⁷, 336 Total body iron stores are approximately 1 g in the normal adult male. The stores regulator modulates how much dietary iron is absorbed by the duodenum according to body iron needs in a limited capacity (1 to 2 mg per day). Under normal physiological conditions, when the body is iron deficient, iron absorption increases by two to three fold³³⁷ until the threshold iron store level is reached. The converse occurs when there is too much iron in the body. There are currently two hypotheses on how iron homeostasis is maintained by the stores regulator. One involves the long-standing “crypt-programming model” and the other involves the more recent “liver hepcidin model.”³³⁸ Both these models appear to involve HFE and/or hepcidin.

#### a. Crypt-Programming Model.
In this model, the stores regulator is thought to act at the level of duodenal crypt enterocytes. The intracellular iron level in crypt enterocytes reflects body iron status, and the cells take up TBI via TFR1 and, possibly, TFR2 from the plasma. As these pre-programmed immature crypt cells mature and migrate to the villus, they express the “correct” level of iron transport proteins to absorb the required amount of dietary iron.³³⁹, 340

Brush-border iron uptake is stimulated by iron deficiency and repressed by iron overload,³⁴¹, 342 corresponding to changes in the expression of duodenal iron transporters. DMT1, FPN, and DCYTB expression are normally up-regulated in systemic iron deficiency and down-regulated when there is excess iron.⁵, 10, 13 However, in pathological conditions, such as HH, when total body iron level is elevated, they are inappropriately expressed, suggesting other iron regulatory proteins may be involved. A role for HFE has been postulated in the regulation of iron absorption. HFE interaction with TFR1 in the crypt cells suggests that it acts as a sensor of body iron stores by monitoring transferrin saturation. In HFE-related HH patients, crypt enterocytes have low ferritin levels.³⁴³, 344 The loss of functional HFE protein confers an iron-deficient phenotype on duodenal crypt cells, resulting in an up-regulation of DMT1, DCYTB, TFR1, and FPN expression in HH patients and *HFE* knock-out mice.¹⁵⁰, 345 Iron absorption is increased despite high body iron stores, suggesting a missensing of iron stores by the mutant HFE protein.³⁴⁶

#### b. Liver Hepcidin Model.
In contrast to the “crypt-programming” model, the “liver hepcidin” model postulates that the liver senses body iron stores. Current knowledge supports this as the more likely model. Decreased hepcidin levels reported in HH patients with mutations in *HFE* and *TFR2*²⁹⁹, 302 suggests that HFE and TFR2 are involved in the regulation of hepcidin
synthesis. This model proposes that the binding of diferric transferrin to TFR1-HFE and TFR2 in hepatocytes regulates hepcidin synthesis to reflect plasma transferrin saturation. Hepcidin secreted by hepatocytes, in turn, interacts with other cells, such as duodenal enterocytes and macrophages, to decrease iron export by altering FPN expression, ${ }^{155}$ as shown in Figure 3. In HFE-or TFR2-related HH, the loss of functional HFE or TFR2 that is accompanied by a decrease in hepcidin expression is hypothesized to stimulate FPN activity in macrophages and duodenal enterocytes to export more iron, thus raising plasma iron levels.

The exact mechanism by which HFE and TFR2 modify hepcidin expression is unknown. The interaction of HFE with TFR2 was recently demonstrated. This led the authors to hypothesize that when plasma diferric transferrin increases, HFE dissociates from TFR1 and binds to TFR2. The HFE-TFR2 complex then initiates the downstream signaling cascade that regulates hepcidin synthesis. The failure to detect elevated plasma transferrin saturation levels results in impaired hepcidin synthesis and a dysregulation of iron homeostasis. ${ }^{131}$ Recent studies suggest that TFR2 may activate the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, ${ }^{291}$ but whether this pathway modulates hepcidin synthesis and requires the interaction of TFR2 with HFE ${ }^{131}$ remains to be determined. Defective regulation of hepcidin in HJV-related HH ${ }^{14}$ suggests that HJV, like HFE and TFR2, may also be necessary for correct iron sensing by hepatocytes (Figure 3). Iron regulation of hepcidin expression is modulated by HJV through the SMAD4 protein signaling cascade involving BMP. ${ }^{321}$

VI. CONCLUSION

The process of iron homeostasis is complex, and since there is no apparent significant excretory pathway for iron, the amount of iron absorbed from mature duodenal enterocytes and that recycled by macrophages need to be tightly regulated. Both these processes are dysregulated in HH and lead to excessive iron deposition in the liver and, subsequently, other parenchymal cells. The identification of many key proteins of iron metabolism, especially hepcidin, has led to revolutionary advances in the field of iron metabolism. While the elucidation of their functions is far from complete, the assimilation of knowledge acquired through ongoing research in the laboratory as well as in the clinical setting will ensure a better understanding of HH and continual improvement in its diagnosis and management.
