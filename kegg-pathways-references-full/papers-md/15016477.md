Diurnal, circadian and photic regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in
Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in the resetting of the circadian clock by light exposure ([Golombek and Ralph, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1038/367525a0); [Fukushima et al

### 2.5. Determination of NOS activity

Animals were sacrificed by decapitation and their brains were quickly excised and placed in an ice-cold environment. NOS activity was determined by the method of Bredt and Snyder (19
3.2. Effect of light exposure on the phosphorylation  
of CaMKII  

We also tested the ability of light pulses to modify the  
phosphorylation state of CaMKII in the SCN. The effect  
of 5 min light pulses (300 lux) administered to animals kept  
under constant darkness (DD) at time points in which light  
has no effect on rhythms (CT 6

in the SCN which could be responsible for the changes in nNOS activity after KN-62 administration (Agostino et al., unpublished). In summary, in the present paper we have determined the existence of a cellular cross-talk between CaMKII and nNOS by both (i) Ser⁸⁴⁷ p–nNOS and (ii) KN-62 and KN-93

of the MAPK pathway (Watt and Storm, 2001; Yun et al., 1998). A recent study showed that CaMKII is able to phosphorylate the MAP kinase Erk in the SCN, whose activity also leads to photic phase shifts (Butcher et al., 2002). In principle, multiple signal transduction pathways might converge in the SCN to account
