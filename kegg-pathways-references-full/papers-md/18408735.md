T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in development: an updated view of their molecular identity and genetic programming

**Chen Dong**

Abstract | Following activation, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into different lineages of helper T (T<sub>H</sub>) cells that are characterized by distinct developmental regulation and biological functions. T<sub>H</sub>17 cells have recently been identified as a new lineage of effector T<sub>H</sub> cells, and they have been shown to be important in immune responses to infectious agents, as well as in various immune diseases. Over the past two to three years, there has been a rapid progress in our understanding of the differentiation programme of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. Here, I summarize our current knowledge of the unique gene expression, cytokine-mediated regulation and transcriptional programming of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, and provide my personal perspectives on the future studies that are required to elucidate this lineage in more detail.

---

CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) cells are important mediators in immune responses, acting to coordinate the other cellular components of the immune system. Approximately twenty years ago, two T<sub>H</sub>-cell subsets were described<sup>1</sup>, and since then, numerous studies have been carried out on the T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell subsets<sup>2,3</sup>. On the basis of these studies, we can now define T<sub>H</sub>-cell 'lineages' according to the following criteria: first, that naive T<sub>H</sub> cells differentiate independently into each lineage *in vitro* and *in vivo*; and second, that each lineage has a gene-expression signature that is distinct and heritable.

Until recently, T<sub>H</sub> cells were thought to be a binary system, consisting of T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells (TABLE 1). Although CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets — such as T helper 3 (T<sub>H</sub>3) cells<sup>4</sup>, T regulatory type 1 (T<sub>R</sub>1) cells<sup>5</sup>, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced regulatory T cells<sup>6</sup> and follicular helper T (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells<sup>7</sup> — have been described that can be derived from peripheral naive precursors, to date they have not fully met the above criteria to be defined as a separate lineage. However, interleukin-17 (IL-17)-expressing T cells, which are now widely known as T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, were proposed two years ago to be a third lineage of T<sub>H</sub> cells<sup>8,9</sup>. More and more evidence has emerged since then, in both mice and humans, to support this idea.

IL-17 (also known as IL-17A) produced by T<sub>H</sub> cells has been associated for many years with host defence against infectious agents and with autoimmune diseases. However, it was unclear how the production of IL-17 was regulated. In 2000, Infante-Duarte *et al.* noticed that T<sub>H</sub> cells that express IL-17 do not co-express interferon-γ (IFNγ) and vice versa<sup>10</sup>. Subsequent studies of mice deficient for inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) and IL-23 in models of autoimmune disease showed that although these two factors are not important for IFNγ expression, they are required for IL-17 expression, which indicates that IL-17 is regulated in a different manner from IFNγ<sup>11,12</sup>. Most importantly, Langrish *et al.* subsequently showed that IL-23 selectively induces the proliferation of *in vivo*-primed IL-17-expressing T<sub>H</sub> cells<sup>13</sup>. T cells that are induced to proliferate with IL-23 express a unique set of genes: they do not produce IFNγ or IL-4 but instead express the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) and IL-17F, which is another member of the IL-17 family and is most closely related to IL-17. Following this work, two groups independently showed that naive T cells can differentiate into IL-17-expressing T cells *in vitro* and *in vivo*, independently of T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell development<sup>14,15</sup>. T<sub>H</sub>17 cells are therefore proposed to be a separate lineage of T<sub>H</sub> cells, an hypothesis that is supported by recent work on their unique cytokine profile and transcriptional regulation.

T<sub>H</sub>17 cells are not only distinct from other T<sub>H</sub> cells in their gene expression and regulation, but also in terms of their biological function. T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, in particular through the production of IL-17 and IL-17F, are now generally found to be pro-inflammatory<sup>8,16,17</sup>. They have an important role in host defence against infection, by recruiting neutrophils and macrophages to infected tissues. Interestingly, human memory T<sub>H</sub>17

cells were found to react against antigens derived from Candida albicans, whereas memory T cells specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis had a $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 1$-cell phenotype${}^{18}$, which indicates that these two $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$-cell subsets have different functions in immune responses to infectious pathogens. $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells are also increasingly being recognized as key players in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases${}^{19,20}$.

Given their importance in immune responses and diseases, it is crucial to understand the regulation of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells. In this Review, I summarize our current knowledge of the unique gene-expression programme of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells and their developmental regulation by cytokines and transcription factors.

Products of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells and their function  
Although the hallmark of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells is the expression of IL-17, additional molecules have been identified by microarray analysis as being selectively expressed by $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells${}^{13,21}$. These studies not only further support the idea that $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells are a distinct T-cell subset, but also shed light on their unique regulation and function.

IL-17. IL-17 is the founding member of the IL-17 cytokine family, which consists of six cytokines — IL-17 (also known as IL-17A), IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-25 (also known as IL-17E) and IL-17F. IL-17 binds to and signals through IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), a member of the IL-17R family that is widely expressed by mesenchymal cells such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts${}^{22}$. Recently, it was reported that IL-17RA can also form a heterodimer with IL-17RC${}^{23}$, another member of the IL-17R family, which raises the possibility that there is an additional form(s) of IL-17 receptors with a different affinity for IL-17 and/or different signal-transduction pathways. IL-17 activates nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways${}^{24,25}$. It was first shown that the induction of IL-6 expression by IL-17 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts depends on tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)${}^{25}$. Recently, the adaptor protein ACT1 has been identified as an immediate and essential signalling component of IL-17RA${}^{26}$. ACT1 directly associates with the intracellular region of IL-17RA through homophilic interaction and is required for NF-$\kappa$B activation and the induction of expression of many pro-inflammatory genes by IL-17. ACT1-deficient mice were resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), as well as colitis induced by dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)${}^{27}$. However, it is not clear if resistance to DSS-induced colitis in ACT1-deficient mice was due to a lack of IL-17 signalling, as IL-17 blockade was previously reported to result in increased pathology induced by DSS${}^{28}$.

IL-17 expression has been associated with many inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and allograft rejection${}^{16,17}$ (TABLE 2). In vitro, expression of the genes encoding several chemokines, including CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL7, CCL20 and CXC-chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), as well as the genes encoding matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and MMP13, was significantly upregulated in mouse fibroblasts after treatment with IL-17 (REF. 15). Despite relatively weak induction of expression of these genes by IL-17 alone, together IL-17 and TNF show strong synergy in promoting pro-inflammatory gene expression${}^{29}$. Similarly in vivo, IL-17RA-deficient mice had impaired host defence against mycobacterial infection due to a significant decrease in the amount of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; also known as CSF3) and CXCL2 in the lungs${}^{30}$. Conversely, overexpressing IL-17 in the lungs resulted in the upregulation of chemokine expression and in tissue infiltration by leukocytes${}^{15}$. In adjuvant-induced models of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-17-deficient mice${}^{31}$, as well as mice administered an IL-17RA antagonist${}^{32}$, were resistant to disease onset. Recently, mice treated with a neutralizing IL-17-specific antibody and IL-17-deficient mice were also found to be resistant to the induction of EAE${}^{13,15,33}$. In addition, IL-17 was reported to promote germlinal-centre reactions in a mouse model of an SLE-like disease${}^{34}$.
Although IL-17 is widely regarded as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that targets non-haematopoietic cell types, studies of IL-17- or IL-17RA-deficient mice have indicated that IL-17 has additional biological functions. For example, IL-17-deficient mice have decreased antigen-specific T-cell activation and antibody production in models of autoimmune and allergic diseases ${ }^{31,35}$. Moreover, IL-17RA deficiency decreased the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 2$-cell response in a mouse model of asthma ${ }^{36}$. It is possible that these effects are due to aberrant tissue recruitment of myeloid cells in the innate immune response in the absence of IL-17 signalling, although additional cell targets of IL-17 might also exist. However, most studies on the targets of IL-17 have focused on non-immune cells and the direct effects of IL-17 on myeloid cells remain to be clarified.

$\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells are the best-characterized source of IL-17 during adaptive immune responses and perhaps during chronic inflammatory responses. However, other cells can also express IL-17, including CD8 + T cells in mice ${ }^{37}$ and in humans ${ }^{38}$, and invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells ${ }^{39}$. Another important source of IL-17, in particular during innate immune responses to infectious agents, is $\gamma \delta$ T cells ${ }^{40,41}$. In the future, it will be important to dissect the source, as well as the function, of IL-17 in different phases of the immune response.

**IL-17F.** The genes encoding IL-17 and IL-17F are localized in the same chromosomal region in mice and in humans. Considering their sequence similarity and proximity in the genome, IL-17 and IL-17F might have derived from a gene-duplication event. Although there is considerable knowledge about the function of IL-17, little is known about the regulation and function of IL-17F. IL-17F was first found to be expressed by $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells that were induced to proliferate with IL-23 (REF. 13), and IL-17F was subsequently shown to be produced by $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells *in vitro* ${ }^{9,42}$. IL-17F protein expression has not been thoroughly examined in relation to IL-17 expression. Limited data indicate that $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells that produce IL-17F but not IL-17 can occur following *in vitro* differentiation (C.D., unpublished observations). The nature and function of these IL-17F single-producer cells remain to be determined.

Natural killer T (NKT) cell  
A T cell that expresses both NK-cell receptors and an $\alpha \beta$-TCR. Some mouse NKT cells express an invariant TCR that uses the V $\alpha 14$ variable region of the TCR $\alpha$-chain and recognizes CD1d-associated antigen. NKT cells are characterized by cytolytic activity and the rapid production of cytokines, including IFN $\gamma$ and IL-4, and they might regulate the function of other T cells.

$\gamma \delta$ T cell  
A T cell that expresses a T-cell receptor consisting of a $\gamma$-chain and a $\delta$-chain. These T cells are present mainly in the intestinal epithelium as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Although the exact function of $\gamma \delta$ T cells (or IELs) is still unknown, it has been proposed that mucosal $\gamma \delta$ T cells are involved in innate immune responses by the mucosal immune system.

Similar to IL-17, IL-17F was reported to induce the expression of various cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules by human airway epithelial cells, vein endothelial cells and fibroblasts ${ }^{43}$, but IL-17F had significantly weaker activity than IL-17 (REFS 44,45). To analyse the function of IL-17F in airway inflammation, adenoviral infection ${ }^{46}$ or lipofectamine-mediated cytosolic delivery of a transgene ${ }^{47}$ was used to acutely overexpress IL-17F *in vivo*, and this resulted in the tissue recruitment of neutrophils. IL-17F was found in the airways of patients with allergic asthma after allergen challenge ${ }^{48}$. Interestingly, a mutation in the IL17F gene was shown to be associated with human asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ${ }^{43}$. The above studies indicate that there is an association between IL-17F expression and human asthma.

It is not clear why, given their similar function, IL-17 and IL-17F are co-expressed by similar T-cell subsets. Transgenic overexpression of IL-17F by lung epithelial cells resulted in a similar pro-inflammatory phenotype to that reported for IL-17 overexpression ${ }^{15}$ (C.D., unpublished observations). Furthermore, a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of IL-17 and IL-17F has been reported recently to be expressed by human and mouse $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells ${ }^{44,45}$, adding another layer of complexity to our understanding of the function of IL-17-family members.

The receptor for IL-17F is unclear; human IL-17F does not bind to human IL-17RA and mouse counterparts only associate weakly *in vitro* ${ }^{49}$, but recently, IL-17RC (a member of the IL-17 receptor family) was reported to be a receptor for IL-17F ${ }^{50}$. Interestingly, IL-17 also binds to IL-17RC. A spliced variant of human IL-17RC inhibits the signalling of both IL-17 and IL-17F, providing a new means to simultaneously block the action of these two cytokines. However, it is still not clear whether IL-17 and IL-17F homodimers, as well as the IL-17–IL-17F heterodimer, preferentially interact with IL-17RA and IL-17RC homodimers or heterodimers. Elucidation of the receptor usage by these cytokines will help to reveal the differential roles of IL-17-family members in the regulation of inflammation.

IL, interleukin; ND, not determined; $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$, Thelper.
IL-22, which is a member of the IL-10 family, was recently shown to be expressed by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>51–53</sup>. Using an IL-22-specific antibody, IL-22 protein was shown to be expressed by some IL-17<sup>+</sup> and some IL-17<sup>−</sup> T cells when they were differentiated under T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-polarizing conditions<sup>52</sup>. Moreover, IL-22-expressing T cells generated *in vivo* co-expressed IL-17 and IL-17F, and IL-23 has been shown to have an important role in regulating IL-22 expression<sup>52,53</sup>.

The IL-22 receptor consists of a unique IL-22R1 chain and IL-10R2, which is shared with the receptors for IL-10, IL-26 and IFNλ<sup>54</sup>. Through this complex, IL-22 activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to induce the expression of the anti-microbial peptides β-defensin-2 and β-defensin-3 (REF. 54). IL-22 can function as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and it has been shown to mediate IL-23-induced acanthosis (thickening of the skin) and dermal inflammation through the activation of STAT3 *in vivo*<sup>53</sup>. Interestingly, Liang *et al.* reported that IL-22 plus IL-17 and/or IL-17F synergistically regulates the expression of β-defensin-2 and S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9)<sup>52</sup>, which illustrates the combined effects of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell products in promoting inflammatory responses. More recently, IL-22 was reported to protect hosts against bacterial infections of the lungs and the gut<sup>55,56</sup>.

However, IL-22 deficiency does not protect mice against EAE<sup>57</sup>. As IL-17 is required for the development of this disease, this result indicates that IL-22 might have distinct target tissues from IL-17 and IL-17F. Furthermore, IL-22, but not IL-17, protects against liver damage in an acute inflammation model<sup>58</sup>. The underlying mechanisms for this protection are not clear; it is possible that IL-22 could induce tissue-repair pathways to limit tissue damage and excessive inflammation, similar to the function of IL-17 in DSS-induced acute colitis. The different functions of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell cytokines in different settings indicate that they might have opposing roles in acute and chronic inflammatory responses.

In addition to IL-22, human T<sub>H</sub>17 cells express another IL-10-family member, IL-26, which does not exist in mice<sup>59</sup>. The exact role of IL-26 in inflammation is currently unclear, but it might have similar functions to IL-22 in chronic inflammation.

IL-21. IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22 produced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells regulate the inflammatory responses of cells in non-lymphoid tissues, but do not seem to regulate T-cell activation or differentiation<sup>14,51</sup>. IL-21 was recently reported to be another cytokine that is expressed at high levels by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells at both the mRNA and protein levels<sup>60–62</sup>, although it is not clear if the same cells can secrete both IL-21 and the other T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-associated cytokines. The expression of IL-21 is induced by IL-6 in a STAT3-dependent manner<sup>21,61,62</sup>, and IL-21 can also autoregulate its own expression<sup>61</sup>.

The IL-21 receptor consists of a unique chain, IL-21R, and the common cytokine receptor γ-chain (γ<sub>c</sub>), which is shared with other cytokine receptors. IL-21R is associated with humoral immunity and germinal-centre reactions, consistent with the high-level expression of IL-21 by T<sub>FH</sub> cells<sup>63</sup>. It is not clear if T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-derived IL-21 is important for humoral immunity; if so, it would expand the function of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells beyond inflammation. In addition, IL-21 is a potent regulator of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation<sup>63</sup>. As I discuss in the next section, IL-21 regulates the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in an autocrine manner<sup>60–62</sup>.

CCL20. CC-chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) is expressed by B cells and subsets of T cells and DCs. Its single ligand, CCL20 (also known as MIP3α), has been shown to be expressed by intestinal tissues and to facilitate the localization of immune cells to the gut<sup>64</sup>. Interestingly, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in mice and humans have been reported to produce CCL20 (REFS 59,65). In addition, CCR6 is also expressed by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>65,66</sup>, which indicates that T<sub>H</sub>17 cells might regulate their own recruitment to inflamed tissues through a paracrine mechanism. CCL20 expression is also induced by IL-17 in tissues<sup>15</sup>, which indicates that CCL20 might have an important role in sustaining T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-mediated inflammation. In support of the importance of CCL20–CCR6 signalling in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell function, CCR6 deficiency or blockade protected against T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-mediated arthritis<sup>65</sup> and EAE (C.D., unpublished observations).

In summary, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells express a unique and expanding array of pro-inflammatory products, which comprises more than just IL-17. So far, a reductionist approach has been taken in the field in understanding the contribution of each pro-inflammatory cytokine to immune responses and diseases (TABLE 2), but the synergy between and the cross-regulation of cytokines produced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells should be considered in the future.

T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation: regulation by cytokines

Over the past two years, both mouse and human T<sub>H</sub>17 cells have been shown to have a distinct gene-expression pattern from that of T<sub>H</sub>1 or T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, which is important for their biological and pathological functions. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to the induction of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-specific genes in activated T<sub>H</sub> cells is therefore of importance in basic and clinical immunology. The functional differentiation of T<sub>H</sub> cells is instructed by the innate immune system, which provides co-stimulatory molecules to allow for optimal T-cell activation and proliferation, and cytokine production that mediates the development of T<sub>H</sub>-cell lineages in response to antigen (FIG. 1). The co-stimulatory receptors CD28 and ICOS have both been shown to be important for the generation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, similar to T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, whereas T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation might only require one of these co-stimulatory molecules<sup>15,67</sup>. In terms of cytokines, neither IFNγ nor IL-4 is required for T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation *in vitro* or *in vivo*, providing one of the first clues that T<sub>H</sub>17 cells might be a separate lineage of T<sub>H</sub> cells<sup>14,15</sup>. More recently, significant progress has been made in understanding the unique cytokine requirements for the development of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in mice and humans.

IL-6 and TGFβ. Although IL-23 was originally shown to be important for the proliferation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and for T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-mediated immune diseases, it does not seem to be necessary for the initiation of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation.

significantly increased numbers of FOXP3-expressing regulatory T cells⁶⁰.

Mangan *et al.* were the first to report the importance of TGFβ in the generation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells *in vivo*⁶⁹. TGFβ-deficient mice have a markedly decreased number of memory T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, but a greatly increased number of IFNγ-expressing T<sub>H</sub>1 cells. TGFβ is broadly expressed by many cell types in the body, but it has been shown that T cells are an important source of the TGFβ that mediates T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation. Bettelli *et al.* reported that overexpression of TGFβ in T cells resulted in increased differentiation to T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-mediated EAE⁶⁸. More conclusively, Li *et al.* generated a T-cell-specific knockout of the gene encoding TGFβ1 and showed that T-cell-derived TGFβ was indispensable for T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation and the induction of EAE in mice⁷⁸.

Despite the above data on the combinatorial role of TGFβ and IL-6 in the initiation of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell development in mice, several issues remain to be further investigated. First, most of these studies used IL-17 expression as a marker of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation, but it is becoming evident that although TGFβ and IL-6 synergistically regulate transcription of the genes encoding IL-17 and IL-17F⁷⁹, many other T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-specific genes are regulated by either exogenous TGFβ or IL-6. For example, IL-21 expression is potently induced by IL-6 (REFS 61,62), whereas TGFβ is not required (C.D., unpublished observations). Moreover, the induction of IL-22 production seems to require a lower concentration of TGFβ than does the induction of IL-17 production⁵³.

Second, TGFβ deficiency resulted in decreased T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation but greatly increased IFNγ production⁶⁹. It still remains formally possible that the requirement for TGFβ in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation is due to the inhibition of T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation, which otherwise would strongly inhibit the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells through IFNγ production or the activity of transcription factors associated with T<sub>H</sub>1 cells. Understanding the downstream mediators of TGFβ signalling in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation is a crucial next step.

Finally, although TGFβ has been shown to be important in initiating T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation in mice, the differentiation of human T<sub>H</sub>17 cells was reported by two groups to be independent of TGFβ but instead mediated by IL-1, IL-6 and possibly IL-23 (REFS 59,80). This finding is controversial, in particular in terms of the naive human T cells that were used in the experiments. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand the requirement for TGFβ and its signalling for T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation in both mice and humans.

IL-21. IL-21 was recently reported not only to be expressed by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells but also to regulate the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells *in vitro* and *in vivo*⁶⁰⁻⁶². These studies indicate that the production of IL-21 could be induced in T cells after treatment with IL-6. Nurieva *et al.* showed that IL-6-induced production of IL-21 depends on the expression of STAT3 but is independent of retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-γ (RORγ), a T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-specific transcription factor⁶¹. IL-6-deficient mice have greatly decreased IL-21 expression *in vivo*⁶¹. Interestingly, IL-21

Substantial *in vivo* data support the requirement for TGFβ and IL-6 in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation. IL-6 was reported to be necessary for antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation⁷⁶. In addition, IL-6 is required for constitutive IL-17 expression by cells in the intestinal tissues⁶⁹,⁷⁷. Interestingly, Korn *et al.* showed that the loss of IL-6 during autoimmune responses resulted in

REVIEWS

Moreover, IL-23 was shown to induce the proliferation of antigen-experienced T cells, and the resulting IL-23R-expressing T<sub>H</sub>17 cells were highly pathogenic in causing autoimmunity<sup>13</sup>. Interestingly, in this study, it was reported that IL-23 could expand T<sub>H</sub>17-cell populations derived from IL-23-deficient mice, which indicates that IL-23 might not be required for the initial differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells *in vivo*, a finding that was subsequently confirmed by another group<sup>69</sup>. Now, it has become clear that naive T cells do not express IL-23R or respond to IL-23 during the initiation of the T<sub>H</sub>17-cell developmental pathway and that the induction of IL-23R expression by developing T<sub>H</sub>17 cells is mediated by IL-6 (REFS 62,76). Consistent with this result, IL-23 synergizes with IL-6 to induce T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation<sup>76</sup> and the overexpression of IL-23R on activated T cells led to IL-23-dependent differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>62</sup>.

The precise effect of IL-23 on T<sub>H</sub>17 cells is still unresolved. Aggarwal *et al.* first showed that IL-23 induces the expression of IL-17 by memory T cells in the absence of T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement<sup>84</sup>, which is similar to the observed regulation of T<sub>H</sub>1 cells by IL-12 in the absence of a TCR signal<sup>85</sup>; however, the physiological importance of this regulation remains unclear. By contrast, IL-23 is required for the initiation, but not for the effector phase, of EAE<sup>86</sup>. T cells isolated from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-immunized p19-deficient mice (which lack IL-23) were less pathogenic than those from immunized wild-type mice; however, it is possible that there were fewer antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in the T cells isolated from the p19-deficient mice compared with those isolated from wild-type mice. Recently, McGechy *et al.* showed that IL-23 signalling downregulates IL-10 expression by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells generated *in vivo* or differentiated in the presence of TGFβ and IL-6, and that IL-23-treated T<sub>H</sub>17 cells are more potent in driving EAE than those that proliferated in the presence of TGFβ and IL-6 alone<sup>87</sup>. These results indicate that the expression of IL-23R, once induced in developing T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, might be important in a final step of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation to 'fix' the pro-inflammatory programme. It is also possible that IL-23 mediates the survival or proliferation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells after the primary response.

IL-23-mediated regulation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells or expression of IL-17 is increasingly being recognized as important in human diseases. A genome-wide screen recently identified *IL23R* as a susceptibility gene for human inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune diseases<sup>88,89</sup>, which is consistent with a rodent study that indicates a pathogenic function of IL-23 in intestinal inflammation<sup>90</sup>. Monoclonal antibodies specific for p40 have shown promise in the treatment of human psoriasis<sup>91</sup>, although it is not clear at this stage whether this effect was solely through the inhibition of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. In addition, expression of IL-23 has been associated with many types of human tumour<sup>92</sup>. As IL-23-deficient mice were reported to be resistant to tumour development, IL-23 might be important in the development of inflammatory cancers in humans. It remains to be determined if this novel function of IL-23 is mediated through the regulation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells or other IL-17-expressing T cells.

Figure 2 | Cytokine-mediated regulation of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation. Naive CD4<sup>+</sup>T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) cells undergo initial T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation in the presence of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which leads to the expression of IL-21. IL-21 further sustains T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation in an autocrine manner and establishes the transcriptional programme of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, including the expression of IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) and IL-1R1. IL-23 and IL-1, both of which are products of activated myeloid cells, possibly finalize the differentiation programme of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and help to maintain the differentiated T<sub>H</sub>17 cells.

expression is regulated by the co-stimulatory receptor ICOS<sup>7</sup>, which indicates that ICOS might regulate T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation through IL-21 expression.

After its induction by IL-6, IL-21 synergizes with TGFβ to promote the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in mice<sup>60–62</sup>. Similar to IL-6, IL-21 inhibits FOXP3 expression induced by TGFβ and thereby prevents regulatory T-cell differentiation<sup>60,61</sup>. Loss of expression of IL-21 or its receptor resulted in defective T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation *in vitro*<sup>60–62</sup>. Consistent with this, IL-21 is important for the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells *in vivo* and during EAE pathogenesis<sup>60–62</sup>. All of these results indicate that IL-21 has an essential role in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation and that an IL-6–IL-21 linear cytokine pathway is involved in this process (FIG. 2). However, Korn *et al.* also reported that in the absence of IL-6 and regulatory T cells, IL-21 could function to promote EAE<sup>60</sup>, raising the possibility of an IL-6-independent mechanism that results in IL-21 expression *in vivo* in the absence of regulatory T-cell function. IL-21 has recently been shown to be expressed by NKT cells<sup>81</sup>; the importance of NKT-cell-derived IL-21 in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation remains to be investigated.

IL-23. IL-23 is a member of the IL-12 cytokine family, which consists of IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35, and it is expressed by activated myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages<sup>82</sup>. The IL-23 heterodimer shares its p40 subunit with IL-12 and has a unique p19 chain<sup>82</sup>. IL-23 was the first cytokine to be shown to selectively regulate IL-17 expression<sup>12,83</sup>. IL-23 deficiency was shown to protect against EAE and collagen-induced arthritis<sup>12,83</sup>; this protection was associated with defective IL-17 expression but intact IFNγ expression<sup>12,13</sup>.

IL-1. IL-1α and IL-1β, which are produced by activated myeloid cells, both bind to the two known IL-1 receptors, IL-1R1 and IL-1R2. IL-1R1 mediates cell activation together with the IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RAP), whereas IL-1R2 lacks signalling properties and acts exclusively as a decoy receptor. It has been reported that, similar to IL-23R, the expression of IL-1R1 is upregulated by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>21</sup>. An initial study using IL-1R1-deficient mice showed that IL-1 has an important role in EAE<sup>93</sup>. Recently, IL-1β was found to promote T<sub>H</sub>17-cell development and/or proliferation in the presence of IL-6 and TGFβ<sup>42</sup>. Sutton *et al.* further showed that the induction of antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, but not T<sub>H</sub>1 or T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, is abrogated in *Il1rl*<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which is consistent with the low incidence of EAE in these mice compared with wild-type mice<sup>94</sup>. However, similar to IL-23, the precise function of IL-1 in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation remains to be fully determined.

Negative regulation. Whereas the cytokines described above positively regulate T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation or function, other cytokines in the immune system negatively regulate T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. In addition to IL-4 and IFNγ, IL-2 was recently shown to promote FOXP3 expression and inhibit T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation<sup>95</sup>, and genetic deletion or antibody-mediated blockade of IL-2 promoted the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells.

IL-27, another member of the IL-12 heterodimeric family, consists of two subunits — Epstein–Barr virus-induced molecule 3 (EBI3) and p28. The IL-27 receptor comprises a unique subunit, known as WSX1, and gp130, which is shared by the IL-6 receptor complex<sup>82</sup>. Recently, two groups showed that IL-27 negatively regulates T<sub>H</sub>17-cell development, which is consistent with its ability to promote a T<sub>H</sub>1-cell response<sup>96,97</sup>. Mice deficient in WSX1 were more susceptible to EAE or infection with *Toxoplasma gondii* than were wild-type mice<sup>96,97</sup>. *In vitro*, IL-27 suppresses the development of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells induced by IL-6 and TGFβ in a STAT1-dependent manner<sup>96,97</sup>.

IL-25 (IL-17E) is a member of the IL-17 family that binds to IL-17RB<sup>16</sup>. IL-25-deficient mice were reported to have greater susceptibility to EAE and to have an increased number of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>98</sup>. IL-25 might inhibit T<sub>H</sub>17-cell development by inhibiting the expression of IL-1 and IL-23 by dendritic cells<sup>98</sup>. However, IL-25 was also recently shown to promote T<sub>H</sub>2-cell development<sup>99</sup>. It is therefore possible that IL-25 can function directly on T cells, as well as indirectly through antigen-presenting cells, to inhibit T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation.

In summary, the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, at least in mice, is initiated by TGFβ and IL-6, which is further sustained and regulated by IL-21 expressed by T cells in an autocrine manner. Differentiating and differentiated T<sub>H</sub>17 cells upregulate the expression of IL-23R and IL-1R1, the function of which is still not well understood but which might mediate or maintain the final lineage specification or induce the proliferation of pre-committed T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. Although human T<sub>H</sub>17-cell development is less well understood and might not involve TGFβ, the cytokines IL-6, IL-1 and IL-23 have been shown to collectively mediate the differentiation of human T<sub>H</sub>17 cells.

In the future, it will be important to resolve the apparent differences in the literature with regards to cytokine-mediated regulation of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation in mice and humans, as this might lead to new interventions for human inflammatory diseases.

T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation: transcriptional control

During T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation, regulatory cytokines act through selective members of the STAT family to regulate gene transcription<sup>3</sup>. For example, T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation is mediated by STAT1 downstream of IFNγ and by STAT4 downstream of IL-12. During T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation, IL-4 signals through STAT6. STAT proteins regulate T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation at least in part through the induction of lineage-specific transcription factors; the expression of T-bet protein is induced by STAT1 in developing T<sub>H</sub>1 cells<sup>100</sup> and the expression of GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is regulated by STAT6 in T<sub>H</sub>2 cells<sup>101</sup>. For T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation, it has been shown that neither T<sub>H</sub>1-cell-associated (STAT1, STAT4 or T-bet) nor T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-associated (STAT6) transcription factors are required, further substantiating the claim that these cells are a distinct lineage of T<sub>H</sub> cells<sup>14,15</sup>. Recently, there has been rapid progress in identifying the transcriptional regulators of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation (FIG. 3).

STAT3. Although little is known about the signalling mechanisms of TGFβ in the initiation of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation, STAT3 has been reported to be a crucial component of IL-6-mediated regulation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>62,76,102–105</sup>. The first clue came from studies by Chen *et al.* in which T cells deficient in suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3; a negative regulator of STAT3) were found to have increased STAT3 activity in response to IL-23 (REF. 103). Moreover, IL-17 production was also increased in SOCS3-deficient cells in response to IL-23 stimulation. As STAT3 binds to the *Il17* gene promoter, these investigators proposed that STAT3 mediates IL-23-regulated expression of IL-17, which is negatively regulated by SOCS3. These results indicate that IL-23 signals through STAT3 in T cells. As IL-23 is not important for the initial differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, STAT3 might function at the effector stage to mediate IL-23-induced T<sub>H</sub>17-cell proliferation and cytokine expression.

The function of STAT3 in IL-6-mediated initiation of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell development was analysed by other investigators. Yang *et al.* showed that overexpression of a hyperactive form of STAT3 in T cells potentiated T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation and, conversely, that T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation mediated by TGFβ and IL-6 was defective in STAT3-deficient T cells<sup>76</sup>. In the absence of STAT3, they observed defects not only in IL-17 production, but also in the expression of IL-17F, IL-22 and IL-23R. Subsequently, STAT3 was also reported to be important for IL-21 expression and for IL-21-mediated T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation<sup>61,62</sup>. Importantly, STAT3 deficiency markedly decreased the expression of RORγt and RORα, which are now known to be lineage-specific transcription factors for T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>76,106</sup> (see later). These results indicate an essential function of STAT3 in the global

Figure 3 | Transcriptional regulation of T helper 17 (T~H~17) cell differentiation. The differentiation of T helper 17 (T~H~17) cells is initiated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), downstream of interleukin-6 (IL-6)- and IL-21-induced signalling. Activation of STAT3 induces the expression of retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-α (RORα) and RORγt. These two factors establish the T~H~17-cell-associated gene-expression programme, leading to the production of IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22. STAT5, which is downstream of IL-2 signalling, and STAT1, which is downstream of IL-27 signalling, as well as ETS1, are negative regulators of T~H~17-cell differentiation. In addition, the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), which is induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling, antagonizes the T~H~17-cell developmental programme.

regulation of T~H~17-cell gene-expression programmes, possibly through the induction of lineage-specific transcription factors. The importance of STAT3 in vivo was shown by Harris et al., who found that STAT3 deficiency in T cells resulted in defective T~H~17-cell differentiation in vivo and protection against EAE^107^.

Although Yang et al. found that overexpression of active STAT5 protein in T cells did not affect T~H~17-cell differentiation^76^, Laurence et al. showed that STAT5 mediates the inhibition of T~H~17-cell differentiation by IL-2 (REF. 95). Therefore, STAT3 and STAT5 seem to have opposing functions in T~H~17-cell differentiation. Whereas STAT3 (activated by IL-6 and IL-21) favours T~H~17-cell differentiation, STAT5 (downstream of IL-2) functions to promote the generation of inducible regulatory T cells^95^. Precisely how STAT3 and STAT5 antagonize each other's function is still unknown.

**RORγt and RORα.** T~H~-cell lineage commitment is mediated by lineage-specific transcription factors. Similar to T-bet in T~H~1 cells and GATA3 in T~H~2 cells, two transcription factors were recently shown to regulate T~H~17-cell differentiation. RORγ, encoded by the RORC gene, and RORα are both members of the retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan nuclear hormone receptor family, which also includes RORβ^108^. An isoform of RORγ, RORγt, is exclusively expressed in cells of the immune system^109^. Recently, Ivanov et al. identified RORγt as a candidate master regulator that drives T~H~17-cell lineage differentiation^77^. Expression of RORγt is induced by TGFβ or IL-6, and overexpression of RORγt promoted T~H~17-cell differentiation when both T~H~1- and T~H~2-cell differentiation were blocked. Conversely, RORγt-deficient T cells were defective in T~H~17-cell differentiation, particularly in terms of the expression of IL-17 and IL-17F, in response to TGFβ and IL-6 or IL-21 (REFS 61,62,77). RORγt-expressing T~H~17 cells are constitutively present in the intestinal lamina propria, but they are absent in mice deficient in RORγt or IL-6. In a model of EAE, mice with RORγt-deficient T cells have attenuated autoimmune disease and they lack tissue-infiltrating T~H~17 cells^77^. Together, these studies show that RORγt is a key regulator of T~H~17-cell lineage differentiation.

However, residual T~H~17 cells are still present in the absence of RORγt and mice lacking T-cell expression of RORγt can still develop EAE, which indicates that other factors are also involved. Recently, Yang et al. reported that RORα is also expressed by T~H~17 cells, and it is induced by TGFβ and IL-6 in a STAT3-dependent

manner<sup>106</sup>. Similar to RORγt, overexpression of RORα promoted T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation when T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation was inhibited, which could occur independently of RORγ expression. However, RORα deficiency in T cells only resulted in a selective decrease in IL-17 and IL-23R expression and had a very moderate inhibitory effect on EAE<sup>106</sup>.

So, compared with RORγt, RORα seems to be a minor player in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation. In which case, why do we need both factors in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells? Yang *et al.* showed that overexpression of RORα and RORγt had a synergistic effect in promoting T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation, particularly when T cells were cultured under T<sub>H</sub>1-cell- or regulatory-T-cell-polarizing conditions<sup>106</sup>. In addition, compound mutations in both factors completely inhibited T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation *in vitro* and *in vivo* and entirely suppressed the development of EAE<sup>106</sup>. So, RORα and RORγt have similar and redundant functions. As there is no evidence for their cross-regulation, their combined concentration might be important in determining T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation, particularly in the presence of negative regulators.

**IRF4.** In addition to these transcription factors, interferon-regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) was recently shown also to be essential for T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation<sup>110</sup>. IRF4 deficiency completely inhibited the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and protected mice against EAE. RORγt expression was markedly decreased in *Irf4*<sup>−/−</sup> T cells after treatment with TGFβ and IL-6, which indicates that IRF4 might be upstream of RORγt<sup>110</sup>. However, RORγt overexpression in *Irf4*<sup>−/−</sup> T cells only partially restored T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation. Therefore, the precise function of IRF4 remains to be determined. As *Irf4*<sup>−/−</sup> mice were also reported to have defects in the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells<sup>111–113</sup>, it is possible that IRF4 might not only regulate a T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-specific programme. In addition, the physiological activator or inducer of IRF4 is unknown.

**Epigenetic regulation.** Lineage-specific transcription factors can function by binding *cis* elements in the cytokine gene loci to initiate or maintain a selective and heritable epigenetic configuration. Previous analysis has revealed an important function of epigenetic regulation in the development, and perhaps maintenance, of the T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell developmental programmes<sup>114</sup>. Although there has been substantial progress in identifying the transcription factors that are involved in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation, it is still poorly understood how they function, particularly with regards to the *cis*-acting elements to which they bind and the epigenetic mechanisms they initiate. Akimzhanov *et al.* recently reported that the promoters of *Il17* and *Il17f* genes in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, but not in T<sub>H</sub>1 or T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, had histone modifications that are typically associated with active, transcribing loci — that is, acetylated histone H3 residues and histone H4 residues that were trimethylated at lysine 4 (REF. 79). This provided the first evidence that epigenetic regulation might occur in T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation. Moreover, eight conserved, non-coding sequences (CNS) in the *Il17–Il17f* gene locus, which are also associated with

acetylated histone H3 in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, were identified, raising the possibility that these intronic elements might regulate the coordinated expression of IL-17 and IL-17F in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. One of these elements, CNS2, has been studied in greater detail. The acetylation of histone H3 at CNS2 is induced by TGFβ and IL-6, and both RORα and RORγt can bind to the ROR response element (RORE) sites in this region<sup>106</sup>. Interestingly, although the expression of RORα or RORγt in EL4 cells could not activate the transcription of a luciferase reporter downstream of a minimal *Il17* gene promoter, coupling ROR expression with the presence of CNS2 in the reporter construct conferred ROR inducibility, which indicates that the RORE sites in CNS2 are functional. Further investigation is necessary to advance our understanding of the interaction of these CNS elements with transcription factors that regulate T<sub>H</sub>17 cells.

**Negative regulation.** The differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells is self-promoted by lineage-specific transcriptional machinery, but it is also antagonized by transcription factors that control the differentiation of other lineages, such as T-bet, GATA3 and FOXP3. However, it has not been reported how these factors negatively regulate T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation. Recently, the transcription factor **ETS1** was shown to inhibit T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation<sup>115</sup>. Although overexpression of ETS1 minimally affected the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, *Ets1*<sup>−/−</sup> T cells had greatly increased T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation in response to TGFβ and IL-6, as characterized by the increased expression of IL-17, IL-17F, IL-22 and IL-23R<sup>115</sup>. Moreover, the expression of RORγt was also increased in ETS1-deficient T cells, although STAT3 activity was not affected. How ETS1 functions to inhibit T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation is still unclear, but data presented by Moisan *et al.* indicate that ETS1 is required for IL-2-mediated inhibition of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell development<sup>115</sup>. The importance of this regulation was shown by an increase in the expression of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-associated cytokines *in vivo* and IL-17-dependent mucus hyperplasia in the lung epithelium of ETS1-deficient mice.

**Conclusion**

Since they were originally proposed as a third lineage of effector T<sub>H</sub> cells, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells have been extensively studied. The study of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells has been one of the most exciting and fast-moving subject areas in immunology. In the past two years, we have learnt that these cells produce different arrays of pro-inflammatory products, that they are regulated by distinct cytokines and that they have their own transcriptional regulators, compared with other T<sub>H</sub>-cell subsets. T<sub>H</sub>17 cells express IL-17, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-26 in humans, and possibly CCL20. Naive T<sub>H</sub> cells, when activated in the presence of TCR and co-stimulatory-receptor signalling, can be induced to undergo initial T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation in the presence of TGFβ and IL-6, which requires activity of the transcription factor STAT3. This leads to the expression of IL-21, which further sustains T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation in an autocrine manner through STAT3, leading to the expression of RORα and RORγt. RORα

REVIEWS

Box 1 | Unresolved questions related to T<sub>H</sub>17 cells

### Lineage specification
Where do T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cells come from? What is the relationship between T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and other types of T cells, including regulatory T cells and T<sub>H</sub>1 cells? Do they emerge from a common precursor in vivo? What are the molecular switches that control lineage differentiation?

### Lineage maintenance
Considering we are no longer in the binary world, are terminally differentiated T<sub>H</sub> cells stable or more plastic than we originally thought? What helps to maintain the differentiated T cells and what can drive their conversion? What are the interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) dual-expressing T cells that have been described in humans and mice and are they stable? Are there IL-17 and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) double-positive T cells? How long can memory T<sub>H</sub>17 cells live and how are they regulated?

### Genetic controls
We already have some knowledge about the possible regulators of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation. But how do they work? What are the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that repress T<sub>H</sub>1-, T<sub>H</sub>2- and regulatory-T-cell programmes in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells? Are signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) required to maintain the T<sub>H</sub>17-cell phenotype?

### Effector regulation
Although we have substantial knowledge of the developmental regulation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, how their effector function is regulated is still poorly understood. For example, how is the cytokine-expression profile of effector T<sub>H</sub>17 cells regulated by co-stimulatory molecules and other cytokines? How do T<sub>H</sub>17 cells migrate into and then interact with inflammatory tissues? What controls their numbers in the early and late phases of an immune response?

### T<sub>H</sub>17-cell function
In my view, we are still in the early phases of exploring T<sub>H</sub>17-cell function and often regard IL-17 as the only factor produced by these cells. But what is the biological relevance of IL-17 and IL-17F? What is the functional synergy or redundancy of members of the IL-17 family and IL-22? How do these cytokines signal in various target tissues?

### T<sub>H</sub>17 cells or not T<sub>H</sub>17 cells?
The cytokines expressed by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells can also be produced by other cells. The cellular sources of these cytokines in different types and phases of immune responses will need to be carefully examined.

and RORγt, perhaps together with STAT3 and IRF4, establish T<sub>H</sub>17-cell transcriptional programmes, including the expression of IL-23R and IL-1R1. IL-23 and IL-1, both of which are the products of activated myeloid cells, possibly finalize the differentiation programme and help to maintain the differentiated T<sub>H</sub>17 cells.

T<sub>H</sub>17 cells have emerged as an important mediator in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Understanding the regulation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells might help to design new therapeutic approaches for these diseases. For example, inhibition of IL-6 and IL-21 might be beneficial in blocking T<sub>H</sub>17-cell development. Inhibitors specific for RORα

and RORγ might serve the same purpose, although it is not clear what effect they might have on fully differentiated T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and what side effects there might be. During the effector phase of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell responses, IL-23 is an attractive target that has shown some success and IL-23 blockade might inhibit T<sub>H</sub>17-cell growth and function.

However, despite this exciting new knowledge about T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, I think there are still many unsolved mysteries (BOX 1). Answering these questions will not only benefit our understanding of T<sub>H</sub>17-cell regulation, but also our knowledge of the interplay between T<sub>H</sub>-cell subsets in immune responses and diseases.
