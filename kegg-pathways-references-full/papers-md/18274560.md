# Immunology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

**Peter J. Barnes**

Abstract | Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both obstructive airway diseases that involve chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract, but the type of inflammation is markedly different between these diseases, with different patterns of inflammatory cells and mediators being involved. As described in this Review, these inflammatory profiles are largely determined by the involvement of different immune cells, which orchestrate the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells that drive the distinct patterns of structural changes in these diseases. However, it is now becoming clear that the distinction between these diseases becomes blurred in patients with severe asthma, in asthmatic subjects who smoke and during acute exacerbations. This has important implications for the development of new therapies.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A group of diseases characterized by the pathological limitation of airflow in the airway, including chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema. It is most often caused by tobacco smoking, but can also be caused by other airborne irritants, such as coal dust, and occasionally by genetic abnormalities, such as α₁-antitrypsin deficiency.

### Atopic (extrinsic) asthma
The commonest form of asthma in which the patients are atopic (as indicated by a positive skin-prick test and the presence of IgE to common inhalant allergens, such as house-dust mites) and have allergic inflammation of the airways.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both very common and their incidence is increasing globally, placing an increasing burden on health services in industrialized and developing countries¹⁻³. Both diseases are characterized by airway obstruction, which is variable and reversible in asthma but is progressive and largely irreversible in COPD. In both diseases, there is chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract, which is mediated by the increased expression of multiple inflammatory proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes and receptors. In both diseases there are acute episodes or exacerbations, when the intensity of this inflammation increases. The similarity between these airway diseases prompted the suggestion in the 1960s that asthma and COPD are different forms of a common disease (chronic obstructive lung disease), and this came to be known as the ‘Dutch hypothesis’. This was countered by the ‘British hypothesis’, which maintained that these diseases were separate entities; the debate continues today, with evidence both for and against these two views⁴,⁵.

Despite the similarity of some clinical features of asthma and COPD, there are marked differences in the pattern of inflammation that occurs in the respiratory tract, with different inflammatory cells recruited, different mediators produced, distinct consequences of inflammation and differing responses to therapy. In addition, the inflammation seen in asthma is mainly located in the larger conducting airways, and although small airways can also be affected in more severe forms of the disease, the lung parenchyma is not affected. By contrast, COPD predominantly affects the small airways and the lung parenchyma, although similar inflammatory changes can also be found in larger airways⁶,⁷. These differences in disease distribution may partly reflect the distribution of inhaled inciting agents, such as allergens in asthma and tobacco smoke in COPD. In both diseases, there are different clinical phenotypes recognized. Most patients with asthma are atopic (extrinsic asthma), but a few patients are non-atopic (intrinsic asthma), and these patients often have a more severe form of the disease⁸. There is a range of asthma severity, which tends to be maintained throughout life⁹. Approximately 5% of patients have severe asthma that is difficult to control with maximal inhaler therapy and for whom new therapeutic approaches are needed. The main types of COPD are the development of small-airway obstruction and emphysema, which can occur alone or together, but which both involve progressive airflow limitation and are usually caused by tobacco smoke.

The differences in inflammation between asthma and COPD are linked to differences in the immunological mechanisms that underlie these two diseases (FIGS 1,2). There have been several recent important advances in our understanding of the immunopathology of asthma and COPD, and these are discussed in this Review. T cells have a crucial role in both asthma and COPD and it is now recognized that different subsets are involved in orchestrating inflammation in these two diseases, resulting in different inflammatory and structural consequences. B cells also have an important

Figure 1 | Inflammatory and immune cells involved in asthma. Inhaled allergens activate sensitized mast cells by crosslinking surface-bound IgE molecules to release several bronchoconstrictor mediators, including cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandin D₂. Epithelial cells release stem-cell factor (SCF), which is important for maintaining mucosal mast cells at the airway surface. Allergens are processed by myeloid dendritic cells, which are conditioned by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) secreted by epithelial cells and mast cells to release the chemokines CC-chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) and CCL22, which act on CC-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) to attract Thelper 2 (Tₕ₂) cells. Tₕ₂ cells have a central role in orchestrating the inflammatory response in allergy through the release of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 (which stimulate B cells to synthesize IgE), IL-5 (which is necessary for eosinophilic inflammation) and IL-9 (which stimulates mast-cell proliferation). Epithelial cells release CCL11, which recruits eosinophils via CCR3. Patients with asthma may have a defect in regulatory T (TReg) cells, which may favour further Tₕ₂-cell proliferation.

at the airway surface and activated T cells. There are characteristic structural changes, with collagen deposition under the epithelium that is sometimes described as basement-membrane thickening and is found in all patients with asthma, and thickening of the airway smooth-muscle cell layer as a result of hyperplasia and hypertrophy, which is more commonly seen in patients with severe asthma¹⁴. Epithelial cells are often shed from asthmatic patient biopsies compared to normal control biopsies, as they are friable and more easily detach from the basement membrane during the biopsy procedure. In addition, there is an increase in the number of blood vessels (angiogenesis) in response to increased secretion of vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF)¹⁵. Mucus hyperplasia is commonly seen in biopsies from asthmatic patients, with an increase in the number of mucus-secreting goblet cells in the epithelium and an increase in the size of submucosal glands¹⁶.

In biopsies of the bronchial airways, small airways and lung parenchyma from patients with COPD, there is no evidence for mast-cell activation, but there is an infiltration of T cells and increased numbers of neutrophils, particularly in the airway lumen¹⁷. Subepithelial fibrosis is not apparent, but fibrosis does occur around small airways and is thought to be a main factor that contributes to the irreversible airway narrowing that is characteristic of this disease¹⁸. The airway smooth-muscle cell layer is not usually increased in COPD patients compared with normal airways, and airway epithelial cells may show pseudostratification as a result of chronic irritation from inhaled cigarette smoke or other irritants and the release of epithelial-cell growth factors. As in biopsies from asthma patients, there is mucus hyperplasia and increased expression of mucin genes in biopsies from patients with COPD¹⁹. A marked difference between COPD and asthma is the destruction of alveolar walls (emphysema) that occurs in COPD as a result of protease-mediated degradation of connective tissue elements, particularly elastin, and apoptosis of type I pneumocytes and possibly endothelial cells²⁰,²¹. In addition, the production of elastolytic enzymes, such as neutrophil elastase and particularly several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), is increased in the lungs of COPD patients²², and there may be a reduction in the levels of antiproteases, such as α₁-antitrypsin, as seen in a rare form of emphysema caused by a congenital deficiency of α₁-antitrypsin²³.

role, although this remains poorly understood in COPD. The appreciation that similar immune mechanisms are involved in both asthma and COPD has important implications for the development of new therapies for these troublesome diseases.

Non-atopic (intrinsic) asthma

An uncommon form of asthma that is more likely to be severe and characterized by negative skin-prick tests. The airway inflammation is similar to that of atopic asthma and may be mediated by local rather than systemic IgE production.

Emphysema

Destruction of the alveolar walls, resulting in decreased gas exchange and contributing to airflow limitation by loss of alveolar attachments to the small airways that serve to keep the airways open during expiration.

Inflammatory cells and mediators

There are many differences between mild asthma and COPD in the type of inflammation that occurs in the lungs, with a different range of inflammatory cells and mediators being implicated¹⁰,¹¹. However, many of the cytokines and chemokines that are secreted in both asthma and COPD are regulated by the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which is activated in airway epithelial cells and macrophages in both diseases, and may have an important role in amplifying airway inflammation¹²,¹³.

Histopathology. The histological appearance of airways from asthmatic individuals is very different from the changes that are observed in patients with COPD (FIG. 3). Bronchial biopsies from asthmatic subjects reveal an infiltration of eosinophils, activated mucosal mast cells

Mast cells. Mast cells have a key role in asthma through the release of several bronchoconstrictors, including histamine, which is preformed and stored in granules, and the lipid mediators leukotriene C₄, leukotriene D₄, leukotriene E₄ and prostaglandin D₂, which are synthesized following mast-cell activation. The release of these mediators may account for the variable bronchoconstriction seen in asthma, as these mediators are released by various environmental triggers, such as allergens, and an increase in plasma osmolality as a result of increased ventilation during exercise. Mucosal mast cells are recruited to the surface of the airways by stem-cell factor (SCF; also known as KIT ligand) released from epithelial cells, which acts on KIT receptors expressed by the

Pseudostratification  
Increased proliferation of  
airway epithelial cells in chronic  
obstructive pulmonary disease,  
as a result of the release of  
epithelial-cell growth factors,  
which lead to increased  
thickness of the epithelial-cell  
layer.

Type I pneumocytes  
Flat alveolar cells that make up  
most of the epithelial-cell layer  
of the alveolar wall and that are  
responsible for gas exchange in  
the alveoli.

Bronchoconstrictor  
An agent that induces  
contraction of airway smooth  
muscle and thereby narrows  
the airways, thus reducing the  
flow of air.

mast cells²⁴. Mast cells also release cytokines that are  
linked to allergic inflammation, including interleukin-4  
(IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13 (REF. 25). The presence of mast  
cells in the airway smooth muscle has been linked to  
airway hyper-responsiveness in asthma²⁶, as patients with  
eosinophilic bronchitis have a similar degree of eosino-  
philic inflammation to that found in asthmatics and  
also have subepithelial fibrosis, but they do not show  
airway hyper-responsiveness, which is the physiological  
hallmark of asthma. By contrast, mast cells do not seem  
to have a role in COPD, which may explain the lack of  
variable bronchoconstriction in this disease.

Granulocytes. The inflammation that occurs in asthma is  
often described as eosinophilic, whereas that occurring  
in COPD is described as neutrophilic. These differences  
reflect the secretion of different chemotactic factors in  
these diseases. In asthma, eosinophil chemotactic factors,  
such as CC-chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11; also known as  
eotaxin-1) and related CC-chemokines, are mainly  
secreted by airway epithelial cells. The functional role of  

eosinophils in asthma is not clear and the evidence that  
links their presence to airway hyper-responsiveness has  
been questioned by the finding that the administration of  
IL-5-specific blocking antibodies that markedly reduce  
the number of eosinophils in the blood and sputum  
does not reduce airway hyper-responsiveness or asthma  
symptoms²⁷,²⁸. As discussed above, eosinophilic bronchi-  
tis is not associated with airway hyper-responsiveness,  
but subepithelial fibrosis does occur, which suggests a  
role for eosinophils in airway fibrosis. Interestingly, the  
presence of eosinophils seems to be a good marker of  
steroid responsiveness²⁹.

Neutrophils are increased in the sputum of patients  
with COPD and this correlates with disease severity³⁰.  
The increase in neutrophils is related to an increase  
in the production of CXC-chemokines, such as CXC-  
chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1; also known as GROα) and  
CXCL8 (also known as IL-8), which act on CXCR2 that  
is expressed predominantly by neutrophils.

Macrophages. Macrophage numbers are increased in the  
lungs of patients with asthma and COPD, but their num-  
bers are far greater in COPD than in asthma. These mac-  
rophages are derived from circulating monocytes, which  
migrate to the lungs in response to chemoattractants such  
as CCL2 (also known as MCP1) acting on CCR2, and  
CXCL1 acting on CXCR2 (REF. 31). There is increasing  
evidence that lung macrophages orchestrate the inflam-  
mation of COPD through the release of chemokines that  
attract neutrophils, monocytes and T cells and the release  
of proteases, particularly MMP9 (REF. 32).

The pattern of inflammatory cells found in the res-  
piratory tract therefore differs in patients with asthma  
and those with COPD and some of these contrasts  
may be explained by differences in the immunological  
mechanisms that drive these two diseases.

Immune responses  
The immune mechanisms that drive the different inflam-  
matory processes of asthma and COPD are mediated by  
different types of immune cell, in particular by different  
T-cell subsets. An understanding of which immune cells  
are involved is now emerging and may lead to the devel-  
opment of new and more-specific therapies for airway  
diseases in the future (FIGS 1,2).

T cells. In asthmatic patients, there is an increase in the  
number of CD4⁺ T cells in the airways and these are pre-  
dominantly T helper 2 (Tₕ₂) cells, whereas in normal air-  
ways Tₕ₁ cells predominate³³. By secreting the cytokines  
IL-4 and IL-13, which drive IgE production by B cells,  
IL-5, which is solely responsible for eosinophil differen-  
tiation in the bone marrow, and IL-9, which attracts and  
drives the differentiation of mast cells³⁴, Tₕ₂ cells have a  
central role in allergic inflammation and therefore their  
regulation is an area of intense research.

The transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding pro-  
tein 3) is crucial for the differentiation of uncommitted  
naive T cells into Tₕ₂ cells and it also regulates the secre-  
tion of Tₕ₂-type cytokines³⁵,³⁶. Accordingly, there is an  
increase in the number of GATA3⁺ T cells in the airways

Figure 2 | Inflammatory and immune cells involved in chronic obstructive  
pulmonary disease (COPD). Inhaled cigarette smoke and other irritants activate  
epithelial cells and macrophages to release several chemotactic factors that attract  
inflammatory cells to the lungs, including CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), which acts on  
CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) to attract monocytes, CXC-chemokine ligand 1  
(CXCL1) and CXCL8, which act on CCR2 to attract neutrophils and monocytes (which  
differentiate into macrophages in the lungs) and CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, which act  
on CXCR3 to attract Thelper 1 (Tₕ₁) cells and type 1 cytotoxic T (Tc₁) cells. These  
inflammatory cells together with macrophages and epithelial cells release proteases,  
such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which cause elastin degradation and  
emphysema. Neutrophil elastase also causes mucus hypersecretion. Epithelial cells and  
macrophages also release transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), which stimulates  
fibroblast proliferation, resulting in fibrosis in the small airways.

### Airway hyperresponsiveness
Increased narrowing of the airways, initiated by exposure to a defined stimulus that usually has little or no effect on airway function in normal individuals. This is a defining physiological characteristic of asthma.

### T<sub>H</sub>2 cells
(T helper 2 cells). The definition of a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell that has differentiated into a cell that produces the cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13, thereby supporting humoral immunity and counteracting T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses. An imbalance of T<sub>H</sub>1–T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of various infections, allergic responses and autoimmune diseases.

### T<sub>H</sub>1 cells
(T helper 1 cells). The definition of a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell that has differentiated into a cell that produces the cytokines interferon-γ and tumour-necrosis factor, thereby promoting cell-mediated immunity.

of asthmatic subjects compared with normal subjects<sup>37,38</sup>. Following simultaneous ligation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptor CD28 by antigen-presenting cells, T-cell GATA3 is phosphorylated and activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Activated GATA3 then translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it activates gene transcription<sup>39</sup>. GATA3 expression in T cells is regulated by the transcription factor STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6), which is in turn regulated by IL-4 receptor activation.

For T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation and secretion of the T<sub>H</sub>1-type cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ), the crucial transcription factor is T-bet. Consistent with the prominent role of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells in asthma, T-bet expression is reduced in T cells from the airways of asthmatic patients compared with non-asthmatic subjects<sup>40</sup>. When phosphorylated, T-bet can associate with and inhibit the function of GATA3, by preventing it from binding to its DNA target sequences<sup>41</sup>. T-bet-deficient mice show increased expression of GATA3 and production of T<sub>H</sub>2-type cytokines, confirming that T-bet is an important regulator of GATA3 (REF. 40). GATA3 expression is also regulated by IL-27, a recently identified member of the IL-12 family, which downregulates GATA3 expression and upregulates T-bet expression, thereby favouring the production

T<sub>H</sub>1-type cytokines, which then act to further inhibit GATA3 expression<sup>42</sup>. In turn, GATA3 inhibits the production of T<sub>H</sub>1-type cytokines by inhibiting STAT4, the key transcription factor activated by the T-bet-inducing cytokine IL-12 (REF. 43) (FIG. 4). Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a T-cell-specific transcription factor and appears to enhance the transcriptional activation of GATA3 by targeting the IL4 promoter<sup>44</sup>. Finally, IL-33, a newly discovered member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, seems to promote T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation by translocating to the nucleus and regulating transcription through an effect on chromatin structure<sup>45</sup>, but it also acts as a selective chemoattractant of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells by binding the surface receptor IL-1-receptor-like 1 (also known as ST2), which is specifically expressed by these cells<sup>46</sup>.

In contrast to asthma, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that accumulate in the airways and lungs of patients with COPD are mainly T<sub>H</sub>1 cells. T<sub>H</sub>1 cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR3 (REF. 47) and may be attracted to the lungs by the IFNγ-induced release of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 (also known as MIG), CXCL10 (also known as IP-10) and CXCL12 (also known as I-TAC), which are present at high levels in COPD airways<sup>48,49</sup>. However, there is some evidence that T<sub>H</sub>2 cells are also increased in lavage fluid of patients with COPD<sup>50</sup>; likewise, in patients with more severe asthma, T<sub>H</sub>1 cells are activated, as well as

T<sub>H</sub>2 cells<sup>51</sup>, making the distinction between the T<sub>H</sub>-cell patterns in these two diseases less clear.

Other subtypes of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that may have an important role in airway diseases are regulatory T cells, which have a suppressive effect on other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and may have a role in regulating T<sub>H</sub>2-cell function in asthma<sup>33,52</sup>. There is evidence that the numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells that express the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) are reduced in individuals with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) compared with non-atopic individuals, and this may be important in enabling high numbers of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells to develop in allergic disease<sup>53</sup>. However, by contrast, asthmatic patients seem to have an increase in FOXP3-expressing regulatory T cells compared with patients with mild asthma, at least among circulating cells<sup>54</sup>. Analysis of sputum from COPD patients suggests that the numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells are reduced, but similar changes are also seen in people who smoke but do not have airflow obstruction<sup>55</sup>. So, the role of regulatory T cells in asthma and COPD remains unclear and further research is therefore needed, particularly in defining the role of different types of regulatory T cells<sup>56</sup>.

Another subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, known as T<sub>H</sub>17 cells (T helper 17 cells), A subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells that produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and that are thought to be important in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Their generation involves IL-23 and IL-21, as well as the transcription factors RORγt (retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-γt) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3).

Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells Lymphocytes that express a particular variable gene segment, Vα14 (in mice) and Va24 (in humans), precisely rearranged to a particular Jα (joining) gene segment to yield T-cell receptor α-chains with an invariant sequence. Typically, these cells co-express cell-surface markers that are encoded by the natural killer (NK) locus, and they are activated by recognition of CD1d, particularly when α-galactosylceramide is bound in the groove of CD1d.

Type 1 cytotoxic T (T<sub>c</sub>1) and T<sub>c</sub>2 cells A designation that is used to describe subsets of CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells. T<sub>c</sub>1 cells typically secrete interferon-γ and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and have strong cytotoxic capacity, whereas T<sub>c</sub>2 cells secrete interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 and are less effective killers.

eosinophilic inflammation<sup>67</sup>. The production of CCL5 (also known as RANTES), which attracts CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells via CCR5, is also increased in the sputum of COPD patients compared with controls and may also be involved in T-cell recruitment<sup>49</sup>. T<sub>C</sub>1 cells release granzyme B and perforins, which are also present at higher levels in the sputum of COPD patients than normal control subjects who also smoke<sup>68</sup>, and may induce apoptosis of type 1 pneumocytes, thereby contributing to the development of emphysema<sup>20</sup>. T<sub>C</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>1-cell-driven inflammation is likely to be self-perpetuating as IFNγ stimulates the release of CXCR3 ligands, which then attract more T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>C</sub>1 cells into the lungs (FIG. 6). T<sub>C</sub>2 cells, which secrete IL-4, have also been described in COPD<sup>50</sup>. In asthma, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are present in patients with more severe disease and irreversible airflow obstruction<sup>69</sup> and these cells may be of either the T<sub>C</sub>1 or T<sub>C</sub>2 type<sup>70</sup>.

B cells. B cells have an important role in allergic diseases, including asthma, through the release of allergen-specific IgE which binds to high-affinity Fc receptors for IgE (FcεRI) expressed by mast cells and basophils, and to low-affinity Fc receptors for IgE (FcεRII) expressed by other inflammatory cells, including B cells, macrophages and possibly eosinophils<sup>71</sup>. The T<sub>H</sub>2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 induce B cells to undergo immunoglobulin class switching to produce IgE. Blocking IgE with the monoclonal antibody omalizumab reduces the response to allergens, airway inflammation and asthma exacerbations, indicating that IgE drives allergic inflammation in asthma<sup>72</sup>. In both atopic asthma and non-atopic asthma, IgE may be produced locally by B cells in the airways<sup>73</sup>.

Interestingly, IgE secretion is not observed in patients with COPD, but in the peripheral airways of patients with more severe disease there is a marked increase in the number of B cells, which are organized into lymphoid follicles that are surrounded by T cells<sup>18</sup>. The class of immunoglobulin they secrete and how they

Figure 4 | Interactions between T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells in asthma. The transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is regulated by interleukin-4 (IL-4) via STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) and regulates the expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 from Thelper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) cells and also inhibits the expression of T-bet via inhibition of STAT4. IL-33 enhances the actions of GATA3. T-bet regulates Thelper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1)-cell secretion of IL-2 and interferon-γ(IFNγ) and also has an inhibitory action on GATA3. T-bet is regulated by IL-12 via STAT4 and by IL-27 via STAT1. This demonstrates the complex interplay of cytokines and transcription factors in asthma.

of myeloid DCs and the recruitment of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells to the airways by inducing the release of CCL17 (also known as TARC) and CCL22 (also known as MDC), which bind to CCR4 that is selectively expressed by T<sub>H</sub>2 cells<sup>80</sup>.

Cigarette smoking is associated with an expansion of the DC population and with a marked increase in the number of mature DCs in the airways and alveolar walls of people who smoke<sup>81</sup>. However, the role of DCs in COPD is currently unclear as there are no obvious antigenic stimulants, apart from α-glycoprotein, which is isolated from tobacco and known to have a powerful immunostimulatory effect<sup>82</sup>. However, a recent electron microscopy study has demonstrated a decrease in DCs in the airways of patients with COPD who smoke compared to smokers without airway obstruction, suggesting that they do not have a key role in COPD<sup>83</sup>.

## Similarities between asthma and COPD

Although the inflammatory and immune mechanisms of asthma and COPD described above are markedly different, there are several situations where they become more similar and the distinction between asthma and COPD becomes blurred (TABLE 1).

### Severe asthma

Although only about 5% of the asthmatic population develop severe disease, such cases account for more than half of the healthcare spending in asthma and they are poorly controlled by currently available therapies<sup>84</sup>. The inflammatory pattern that occurs in cases of severe asthma, contrary to mild asthma, is more similar to that which occurs in COPD, with increased numbers of neutrophils in the sputum and increased amounts of CXCL8 and tumour-necrosis factor<sup>85</sup>, increased oxidative stress and a poor response to corticosteroids as is observed in patients with COPD (TABLE 1). Moreover, whereas in mild asthma T<sub>H</sub>2 cells predominate, in more severe asthmatic disease there is a mixture of T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells present in bronchial biopsies, as well as more CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and this more closely resembles the immune-cell infiltration seen in COPD<sup>51,69,70</sup>. The neutrophilic inflammation seen in cases of severe asthma may be induced by IL-17 production by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, which induces the release of the neutrophilic chemokine CXCL8 from airway epithelial cells<sup>59,60</sup>. A neutrophilic pattern of inflammation, with high levels of CXCL8, is also found in the sputum of asthmatic individuals who smoke<sup>86</sup>. Similar to patients with severe disease or COPD, these individuals also have a poor response to corticosteroids, even if given orally at high doses.

### Reversible COPD

Approximately 10% of patients with COPD have a reversibility of bronchoconstriction, showing greater than 12% improvement in lung function as assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and therefore behave more like asthmatics. Furthermore, compared with most patients with COPD, these patients more frequently have eosinophils in their sputum, an increase in exhaled nitric oxide and respond better to corticosteroid treatment, all of which are characteristic features of asthma<sup>87,88</sup>. It therefore seems likely that these patients have concomitant asthma and COPD.

Acute exacerbations. Acute exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) occur in patients with asthma and COPD, and are a major cause of patient suffering and medical expenditure<sup>89,90</sup>. Exacerbations in asthmatic individuals are usually triggered by upper respiratory tract infections, such as with rhinoviruses, and less commonly by inhaled allergens and air pollutants, whereas exacerbations in patients with COPD are usually triggered by either bacterial or viral infections. In both diseases, exacerbations are associated with a further increase in airway inflammation, increased numbers of cells infiltrating the lungs and higher concentrations of inflammatory mediators than are present in the steady state. However, there may also be changes in the pattern of inflammation. In exacerbations of asthma triggered by viruses, there can be increases in the numbers of neutrophils, as well as of eosinophils<sup>89</sup>, whereas in COPD exacerbations, particularly those due to viruses, there may be an increase in eosinophil numbers<sup>91</sup>. So, during episodes of disease exacerbation, the pattern of inflammation becomes similar in COPD and asthma.

**Implications for therapy**

In view of the different inflammatory and immune patterns of asthma and COPD, it is not surprising that they should respond differently to anti-inflammatory therapies.

Theophylline

A drug that is used at high doses as a bronchodilator in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, it is now less widely used as the high doses can have side effects, including nausea, headaches, cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. More recently, it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects at lower doses and may reverse corticosteroid resistance by increasing the activity of histone deacetylase.

Cyclosporin A and tacrolimus

Calcineurin inhibitors that are used to prevent transplant rejection and that function by inhibiting nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).

Rapamycin

An immunosuppressive drug that, in contrast to calcineurin inhibitors, does not prevent T-cell activation but blocks interleukin-2-mediated clonal expansion by blocking mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin).

Mycophenolate mofetil

An immunosuppressant that inhibits purine synthesis and has an inhibitory effect on T cells and B cells. It is currently used to treat transplant rejection and rheumatoid arthritis.

Immunomodulation. Specific immunotherapy to inhibit allergic responses has been successful in treating individuals with hay fever, in which there is a single type of allergen involved, but so far such an approach has not proved to be very effective for treating asthma and, because it is potentially dangerous through triggering anaphylactic responses, it is not recommended in current treatment guidelines. More effective and safer immunotherapy for asthma using DNA vaccines, T-cell peptides and sublingual immunotherapy is currently under investigation<sup>99</sup>.

Suppression of T cells may be a useful therapeutic approach in the treatment of asthma and COPD, given their role in driving inflammation in both diseases. Cyclosporin A, a non-selective inhibitor of T cells, although early studies showed it had some clinical benefit<sup>100</sup>, it has subsequently been found to be of little benefit to asthmatics in several clinical trials and is now not recommended as a therapy, particularly in view of its toxicity<sup>101</sup>. Less-toxic immunomodulators, such as tacrolimus, rapamycin and mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept; Roche), which are currently used in the prevention of transplantation rejection, have not been tested in clinical studies of asthma and there are no studies assessing the efficacy of immunosuppressants in patients with COPD. More specific immunomodulators that selectively inhibit T<sub>H</sub>2 cells have been sought for the treatment of asthma, as yet without success. Suplatast tosilate (IPD; Taiho Pharmaceutical) is a drug that apparently inhibits T<sub>H</sub>2 cells and T<sub>H</sub>2-type cytokine release<sup>102</sup>, but its mechanisms of action are not known. It has only weak clinical effects and is currently only available in Japan. In COPD patients, treatments that target CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might be more appropriate.

Figure 6 | **CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**. Epithelial cells and macrophages are stimulated by interferon-γ (IFNγ) to release the chemokines CXC-chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10 and CXCL11, which together act on CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) expressed on Thelper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cells and type 1 cytotoxic T (T<sub>C</sub>1) cells to attract them into the lungs. T<sub>C</sub>1 cells, through the release of perforin and granzyme B, induce apoptosis of type I pneumocytes, thereby contributing to emphysema. IFNγ released by T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>C</sub>1 cells then stimulates further release of CXCR3 ligands, resulting in a persistent inflammatory activation.

Given the role of B cells in both asthma and COPD, non-selective B-cell inhibitors, such as the CD20-specific monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc. and Biogen Idec) might be beneficial, as it is in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases$^{103}$. However, there are concerns about the safety of using rituximab, particularly in COPD patients who are susceptible to recurrent bacterial infections, as the airways of patients with more severe disease are often colonized by bacteria.

Other novel therapeutic approaches. Several novel therapeutic approaches are currently in development for treating inflammation in asthma and COPD$^{104,105}$, for example, one type of therapy involves targeting specific transcription factors that are known to be active in these diseases$^{106}$. In both airway diseases, NF-$\kappa$B activation appears to be important for activating multiple but different inflammatory genes, so inhibition of this transcription factor using small molecule inhibitors of IKK2 (inhibitor of NF-$\kappa$B kinase 2) would be a logical approach. For the treatment of asthma, inhibition of GATA3 function and therefore $T_{H}2$-type cytokine production may be a more specific approach and this might be possible using inhibitors of the GATA3-activating kinase p38 MAPK$^{39}$. Indeed, downregulation of p38 MAPK expression using an antisense oligonucleotide has proved to be effective in inhibiting $T_{H}2$-type cytokine production in a mouse model of asthma$^{107}$. For the treatment of COPD, inhibition of the $T_{H}1$-cell-inducing transcription factor T-bet would be more appropriate and this could be achieved by blocking STAT4 activity, but no such drugs have so far been developed.

Given that chemokines are crucial mediators in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs of patients with asthma and COPD, antagonism of specific chemokine receptors would be a logical approach for treating these diseases$^{108,109}$. In asthma, chemokine receptors on eosinophils (CCR3) and $T_{H}2$ cells (CCR4, CCR8 and CXCR4) are the main targets, whereas in COPD, receptors on neutrophils (CXCR2), monocytes (CXCR2 and CCR2), $T_{H}1$ cells (CXCR3) and $T_{C}1$ cells (CXCR3) are the major foci of drug development. Small molecule inhibitors for all of these receptors are now in development.

Conclusions and future perspectives

Although both COPD and asthma involve chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract, the pattern of inflammation is markedly different between these two diseases. Mild asthma is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation driven by $T_{H}2$ cells and DCs, and is associated with mast-cell sensitization by IgE, and by the release of multiple bronchoconstrictors. By contrast, COPD is characterized by neutrophilic inflammation that can be driven by a marked increase in the number of lung-resident macrophages, which also attract CD4$^{+}$ and CD8$^{+}$ T cells to the lungs. This lymphocytic infiltration can also be driven by chronic stimulation by viral and bacterial antigens or by autoantigens released following lung injury. Mast cells and DCs, which have such a key role in asthma, have little or no known

involvement in COPD. However, these distinctions between asthma and COPD may not be as clear as previously believed, as in patients with severe asthma and in asthmatic individuals who smoke there is a neutrophilic pattern of inflammation, and acute exacerbations of asthma and of COPD have similar inflammatory features. The role of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in severe asthma and COPD as a driving mechanism of neutrophilic inflammation is not yet fully understood and deserves more research; understanding these mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic approaches.

New therapeutic approaches may also stem from a greater understanding and appreciation of the similarities between asthma and COPD. Although there are highly effective treatments for mild asthma, severe asthma and asthma in people who smoke are poorly treated with current therapies and because of the similarities with COPD, it is likely that new anti-inflammatory treatments that are effective in COPD may also be effective in refractory asthma. Whether therapies based on the immune mechanisms will be safe and effective in treating airway diseases also deserves further research.
