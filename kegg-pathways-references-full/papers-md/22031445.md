Thiamine pyrophosphate 1 is an essential cofactor in all living systems${}^{1}$. Its biosynthesis involves the separate syntheses of the pyrimidine 2 and thiazole 3 precursors, which are then coupled${}^{2}$. Two biosynthetic routes to the thiazole have been identified. In prokaryotes, five enzymes act on three substrates to produce the thiazole via a complex oxidative condensation reaction, the mechanistic details of which are now well established${}^{2-6}$. In contrast, only one gene product is involved in thiazole biosynthesis in eukaryotes (THI4p in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*)${}^{7}$. Here we report the preparation of fully active recombinant wild-type THI4p, the identification of an iron-dependent sulphide transfer reaction from a conserved cysteine residue of the protein to a reaction intermediate and the demonstration that THI4p is a suicide enzyme undergoing only a single turnover.

While analysing the metabolic pathway leading to thiamine pyrophosphate 1 (Fig. 1a), we identified three adenylated metabolites (structures 5, 12 and 17 in Fig. 1b), co-purifying with THI4p. They provide three molecular snapshots of the reaction pathway catalysed by this protein. In addition, two partially active mutants were identified (C204A and H200N), which catalysed the conversion of NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) 6 and glycine 9 to an advanced intermediate 12 (ref. 8). A mechanism for thiazole formation, consistent with these observations, is outlined in Fig. 1b (refs 8–11). However, the source of the thiazole sulphur remained elusive, precluding us from deciphering the subsequent steps leading to the adenylated thiazole 5.

High-resolution ESI-FTMS (electrospray ionization Fourier-transformed mass spectrometry) analysis of wild-type THI4p (wtTHI4p), recombinantly expressed in *Escherichia coli*, revealed a mass that was $34 \pm 1$ Da lower than the calculated mass of the protein. The active site mutants of THI4p${}^{8}$, which did not copurify with any bound metabolites and did not show any activity, were unmodified, indicating that the 34-Da mass loss was in some way related to the catalytic activity of the protein. To localize the site of this modification, chymotrypsin digestion of modified wtTHI4p was carried out, followed by MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization) and ESI-MS analysis of the peptide fragments. Before the digestion, free thiol residues of the protein were alkylated with iodoacetamide to protect them from oxidation. As a control, we performed the same procedure on an inactive and unmodified THI4p mutant (R301Q)${}^{8}$ in parallel. Upon comparing the results for the wtTHI4p and the mutant THI4p, two modified peptide fragments, spanning the same region of the protein sequence, were identified (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Fragmentation analysis localized the modification to a pair of adjacent cysteine residues (Cys204 and Cys205, Fig. 2a, highlighted in red). Both of these residues failed to alkylate during the iodoacetamide treatment of the peptide fragments. In contrast, peptide fragments originating from THI4p (R301Q) under the same conditions were completely alkylated (Fig. 2a). These observations may be explained by the transfer of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ from Cys204 or Cys205 of wtTHI4p to a thiazole intermediate,

generating a dehydroalanine residue ($\mathrm{M}-34 \mathrm{Da}$), which is subsequently trapped by the adjacent cysteine-thiol, producing a seven-membered cyclic thioether (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2).

On the basis of these observations, the crystal structures of THI4p${}^{9}$ and THI1 (ref. 12; THI4p orthologue from *Arabidopsis thaliana*) were reanalyzed for evidence of an active site dehydroalanine (DHA) or cyclic thioether. The $2 F_{o}-F_{c}$ and $F_{o}-F_{c}$ electron density maps clearly demonstrate a lack of electron density for the sulphur atom of Cys205, consistent with a dehydroalanine residue (Fig. 2c, d). The loop containing Ala199–Asp207, disordered in our previous structure, was completed and shown to extend into the active site of a fourfold-related monomer. The interpretation of the high resolution

WT, wild type. **b**, A mechanistic hypothesis to explain the mass loss and lack of reactivity with iodoacetamide of the modified peptides. **c**, Active site of THI4p with bound ADT. The separation of the sulphur atom of ADT and the Cβ atom of the dehydroalanine residue is 5.3 Å. The loop Gln 203–Pro 208 is from a fourfold-related monomer and has carbon atoms coloured cyan. Water molecules are shown as red spheres. The electron density map ($2F_{o} - F_{c}$ contoured at $3\sigma$) clearly shows the loss of sulphur from Cys 205 to form the dehydroalanine residue. **d**, Magnified electron density of residue DHA 205 and residue Cys 204.

structure of THI1 (PDB ID 1RP0) is also consistent with an active site dehydroalanine. The $2F_{o} - F_{c}$ and $F_{o} - F_{c}$ electron density maps for this protein confirm that electron density for the sulphur atom of Cys 172 is missing and demonstrate that the Cα is planar (Supplementary Fig. 3). The identification of adjacent cysteine/dehydroalanine residues in THI4p suggests that the formation of the cyclic thioether occurs under the denaturing conditions used for the preparation of the sample for mass spectrometry analysis.

The activity-dependent loss of H₂S from THI4p indicated that the sulphur atom of the thiazole could be derived from THI4p. The resulting modification renders the enzyme inactive and explains our previous inability to reconstitute active wtTHI4p. The problem of obtaining active wtTHI4p was solved by a surprising set of observations regarding the effect of the growth medium on the activity of isolated wtTHI4p. When the overexpression strain was grown in M9 minimal medium instead of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium, the purified protein was mostly free of the 34-Da mass modification (Fig. 3b). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of this protein preparation demonstrated greatly reduced formation of the sulphur-containing metabolites 17 and 5 and the accumulation of 12 (Fig. 3a, red HPLC trace). This indicates that the sulphur transfer chemistry involved in thiazole formation is greatly retarded when wtTHI4p is isolated from cells grown in minimal medium.

Addition of 100 μM iron (II) to the growth medium was sufficient to restore the sulphide transfer activity of wtTHI4p as indicated by the formation of 17 and 5 shown in Fig. 3a (black HPLC trace). In addition, the protein thus isolated showed the 34-Da mass loss, as observed with wtTHI4p overexpressed in LB medium (Fig. 3b). These observations indicated that the THI4p-catalysed sulphur incorporation reactions are iron-dependent.

These observations suggested conditions for the successful reconstitution of the THI4p-catalysed reaction. To accomplish this, the unmodified wtTHI4p, overexpressed in minimal media, was freed from bound metabolites by multiple rounds of gel-filtration. This protein preparation catalysed the conversion of ADP-ribose (ADPr 7) to 12 in the presence of glycine 9, via the intermediate of ADP-ribulose (ADPr 8, Fig. 3c). Addition of Fe²⁺ to this reaction mixture resulted in the conversion of 12 to the final product ADP-thiazole (ADT, 5; Fig. 3c). Other divalent metal ions (Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, Mn²⁺, Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺) did not activate the enzyme for sulphide transfer chemistry. Although this reaction mixture did not contain an exogenous sulphur source, nearly one full turnover could be observed (380 ± 5 μM ADT from 420 ± 21 μM THI4p). Inclusion of excess sulphide or cysteine in the reaction mixture did not enhance the turnover number or protect the protein from modification. The production of ADT 5 was oxygen-sensitive and had to be performed under an anaerobic atmosphere, in the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) or tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP). Formation of ADT was accompanied by the loss of H₂S (∆M = 34 Da) from wtTHI4p, as evidenced from ESI-FTMS analysis (Fig. 3e). In control reactions, lacking either Fe²⁺ or ADPr 7, no modification of wtTHI4p was observed. A time course for the reaction demonstrates a consistent stoichiometry of 1:1 for protein modification and thiazole production (Fig. 3d, e).

The full reconstitution of ADT 5 formation, using purified wtTHI4p, in a reaction mixture lacking any exogenous sulphide donor, coupled with the observed loss of 34 Da from the protein and the structural characterization of a dehydroalanine residue at Cys 205 provides compelling evidence that the thiazole sulphur is derived from Cys 205 of wtTHI4p. Consistent with this model is the observation that Cys 205 is strictly conserved in eukaryotic thiazole synthases, whereas

Also, the THI4p C205S mutant was shown to be inactive, whereas the C204S mutant retains its ability to produce ADT, indicating Cys 205 as the sulphur donating residue.

Efforts towards the *in vitro* reactivation of modified THI4p under a variety of different conditions were unsuccessful. This suggests that THI4p is a single turnover enzyme. In addition, whereas thiamine biosynthetic enzymes are generally present in the proteome at very low concentrations, THI4p is an exception and a high level of expression (approximately 1.5%)¹³ is observed during the exponential growth phase of *Neurospora crassa*. To investigate the possibility that THI4p is a single turnover enzyme, we first characterized THI4p, expressed at native levels in a yeast strain, in which a His₆ tag had been inserted at the carboxy terminus of THI4p to facilitate its detection and purification. THI4p was isolated from this strain grown to mid-log phase in a vitamin-free defined medium using immunoaffinity chromatography and was analysed by gel electrophoresis and western blotting (Fig. 4a, b). The THI4p band was excised, digested with chymotrypsin and the peptide fragments were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). The peptide fragment (T194 to Y216) associated with the 34 Da mass-loss (*m/z* = 2,430.1) was again identified in this experiment (Fig. 4c) and their fragmentation patterns were identical, confirming the loss of H₂S followed by cyclic thioether formation (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). The unmodified species for the same peptide (predicted *m/z* = 2,464 Da) was not observed in this experiment. Identification of the same pattern of H₂S-loss from native THI4p, as observed in the *in vitro* reconstitution experiments, further validates THI4p as the sulphur donor for thiazole biosynthesis *in vivo*. In addition, the mass spectrometric analysis identifies modified THI4p as the major species present *in vivo*, indicating the absence of a repair pathway in yeast for modified THI4p. This suggests that the ratio of THI4p to thiamine produced should be 1:1. To test this hypothesis, the concentration of native THI4p in yeast cell-free extract was determined by quantitative western blot analysis, using known quantities of recombinantly expressed THI4p to generate a calibration curve (Fig. 4a), and thiamine concentration in yeast lysate and in the growth medium (secreted by yeast) was determined by the thiochrome assay (supplementary Fig. 6). A 1:1.1 ± 0.2 stoichiometry between THI4p and thiamine was demonstrated in yeast cultures growing at mid-log phase (four independent experiments), supporting its role as a single turn-over enzyme (Fig. 4d).

A mechanistic proposal for the sulphide transfer chemistry involved in ADT 5 formation that is consistent with these observations is outlined in Fig. 4e. Addition of the thiol of Cys 205 to intermediate 13, formed as shown in Fig. 1, followed by Fe²⁺ assisted elimination would give 14 and generate the active site dehydroalanine observed in the structure. It is also possible that the iron activates the sulphide transfer by direct interaction with the sulphur. The oxygen sensitivity of the reaction indicates that Fe²⁺ is the catalytically active iron oxidation state. Intermediate 14 is then converted to ADT 5 as shown in Fig. 1.

chain and THI4p serves as the sulphur source. The biological function of the modified protein, if any, remains to be elucidated.

### METHODS SUMMARY

THI4p and its mutants (pET28b vector, BL21(DE3) cell line) were overexpressed in LB medium and isolated using Ni-NTA chromatography as described previously. To isolate unmodified THI4p for activity assays, M9 minimal medium was used for overexpression (see Supplementary Materials for details). HPLC analyses of THI4p-bound metabolites and the *in vitro* reconstitution assays were performed as previously described. Assays of THI4p were performed in an anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory Products Inc.). A typical THI4p reconstitution reaction assay included ADP-ribose or NAD (final concentration 1 mM), glycine (final concentration 1 mM), freshly prepared FeSO₄ (final concentration 0.5 mM) and THI4p (300–500 μM). THI4p and its mutants were desalted into 50% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid for ESI-FTMS analyses. Chymotrypsin digestion/MALDI analyses of recombinant THI4p and its mutants were performed at the Proteomics Facility, Cornell University, using standard protocols. In-gel chymotrypsin digestion/MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis with THI4p isolated from yeast was carried out in the Russell laboratory at Texas A&M University and the ESI-FTMS analysis was carried out in the Dorrestein laboratory at UCSD. The crystal structures of THI4p (Protein Data Bank ID 2GJC) and THI1p (PDB ID 1RP0) were refined against the deposited structure factor magnitudes using REFMAC from CCP4 (refs 20 and 21). The *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* strain BY4741 (purchased from Open Biosystems, Inc.) was used for *in vivo* studies with THI4p. Vitamin-free medium A (medium YNB (yeast nitrogen base) plus 0.01% uracil, 0.01% leucine, 0.005% histidine, 0.005% methionine, 2% glucose, and 0.03% G418) was used to grow the yeast strain to allow the expression of the endogenous THI4p. Endogenous THI4p concentration was determined using a quantitative western blot, whereas the concentration of thiamine was determined using the thiochrome assay.

time intervals and the quenched reaction mixture was analysed by HPLC as previously described⁸. Simultaneously, another 100 µl aliquot was removed from the anaerobic chamber, rapidly buffer-exchanged, using a Bio-Spin mini desalting column (Bio-Rad), into 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Later, these samples were individually thawed, immediately before use, and desalted and eluted with 75% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid for ESI-FTMS analysis (as described above).

Identification of dehydroalanine in the structures of THI4p and THI1p. Consistent with the biochemical studies, electron density maps showed no density for the sulphur atom of Cys 205 and this residue was changed to dehydroalanine. In addition, several surrounding residues were adjusted to fit the electron density and a loop missing from the original structure was built. New loops including Gln 198–Thr 202, His 237–Gly 242, Pro 178–Thr 185 and Asp 238–Phe 24 and loop Asp 219–His 228 were rebuilt to better fit the electron density. Model building was done using program COOT²². Analysis of the Ramachandran plot for THI4p showed that 91.8% of the non-glycine residues were in the most favoured region, 7.8% in the additional favoured region, 0.2% in the generously allowed region, and 0.2% in the disallowed region. The final refinement statistics are given in Supplementary Table 1.

The crystal structure of THI1p (PDB ID 1RP0)¹² was refined against the deposited structure factor magnitudes using REFMAC. The structure of THI1p was originally deposited with an annotation that the occupancy of the sulphur atom of Cys 172 was 0, indicating that electron density for the sulphur atom was not visible. Residue Cys 172 was changed to dehydroalanine and the structure was refined a few rounds to convergence. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot for THI1p showed that 92.9% of the non-glycine residues were in the most favoured region and the remaining 7.1% were in the additional favoured region. No residues were found in the generously allowed or disallowed regions. The final refinement statistics, which are very similar to those originally reported¹², are given in Supplementary Table 1. Figure 2c, d was made using PyMOL²³.

Yeast strain and cell growth. The *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* strain BY4741 (*MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0*) was purchased from Open Biosystems, Inc. The *MATa* cells of the background strain BY4741 are tagged at the 3′ end of the *THI4* ORF with a sequence encoding six histidines (6 × His)²⁴. The chromosomal insertion was verified by colony PCR analysis and G418 resistance.

For each experiment, a single colony was picked from a freshly streaked G418 plate that was incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. For cell growth, 10 ml of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone, 2% glucose) was inoculated with this colony and incubated in a 100 ml sterile Erlenmeyer flask at 30 °C (shaking speed 270 r.p.m.) for 12 h or until an attenuation of 4.0 at 600 nm was reached. The resulting cells were collected by centrifugation, washed (3×) with vitamin-free medium A (medium YNB (yeast nitrogen base) plus 0.01% uracil, 0.01% leucine, 0.005% histidine, 0.005% methionine, 2% glucose and 0.03% G418), suspended in 50 ml of vitamin-free medium A containing the antibiotic G418 to an attenuation of 0.07 at 600 nm and transferred to a 250 ml sterile Erlenmeyer flask. This was incubated for 15 h (the predicted mid-log phase) at 30 °C (shaking speed 270 r.p.m.) and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min.

For experiments to determine the THI4p or thiamine concentration, cells (30–40 mg wet weight) were collected from 50 ml of vitamin-free medium A.

For the mass spectrometric experiments, the cells (5–10 g, wet weight) were collected from 6 l (3 × 2 l) of vitamin-free medium A.

Western blot analysis. Yeast cell-free extract was analysed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using a Panther semi-dry electroblotter (Owl Separation Systems), and then blocked in TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl) plus 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, before incubating with Penta·His Alexa Fluor 647 (Qiagen) anti-His antibody conjugates (1:5,000 dilution) for 1 h in the dark. After two rounds of 10-min washes with TBS in the dark, the membrane was then subjected to direct immunofluorescent detection by Typhoon Trio (excitation, 633 nm red laser; emission, 670 nm band-pass filter (670 BP 30)) from GE Healthcare Biosciences.

The above protocol was followed to confirm the occurrence and/or purity of endogenous THI4p isolated from yeast.

Analysis of the THI4p/thiamine ratio *in vivo*. The yeast cultures were grown as described above. The cells grown to the mid-log phase in 50 ml of vitamin-free medium A were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min. A portion (20 ml) of the supernatant (the clarified culture medium) was collected and frozen at −80 °C for at least 12 h. This was then lyophilized to dryness and the residue was used to determine the amount of thiamine secreted into the growth medium (details will follow).

The wet weight of cells from the 50 ml culture was 30 mg. Spheroplast formation was carried out according to published protocols²⁵. Unless indicated otherwise, all steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells (30 mg) were re-suspended in 30 µl of

Cultures were agitated at 37 °C until the OD at 600 nm reached 0.6, at which point protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG. The temperature was reduced to 15 °C and the culture was grown overnight with shaking. The cultures were then harvested by centrifugation (14,000g) and the pellets were frozen and stored at −80 °C until further use. To demonstrate iron dependence, an identical growth protocol was used except that, immediately before the induction of protein expression, FeSO₄ was added to the culture (final concentration 100 µM).

To purify the protein, a cell pellet from 2 l of culture was resuspended in 30 ml lysis buffer (10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH₂PO₄, 1 mM DTT, pH 8) and lysed by sonication on ice (Heat Systems Ultrasonics model W-385 sonicator, 2-s cycle, 50% duty). The resulting cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30,000g) and the THI4p protein was purified using a 5 ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After elution, the protein was buffer-exchanged using a 10-DG column (BioRad) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 2 mM DTT.

To release THI4p-bound metabolites, this protein preparation was further gel-filtered into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8 (containing 2 mM DTT). Then it was buffer exchanged into 50 mM KPi, pH 7.8 containing 2 mM DTT (or TCEP) and 100 mM NaCl. This protein preparation was used for all assays.

ESI-FTMS analysis of THI4p and its mutants. Samples were prepared by desalting the protein using C18 ZipTip (Millipore) following the manufacturer’s protocol and eluting with 75% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. This was diluted 1:1 with 50% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid and the resulting solution was used for ESI-FTMS analysis (Thermo-Fisher LTQ-FT) using a Biversa nanospray robot (Advion). The resulting data were deconvoluted with the software package Extract (licensed by Thermo-Fisher).

Chymotrypsin digestion-MALDI analysis of recombinantly expressed, wtTHI4p and the R301Q mutant. Guanidinium hydrochloride (40 µl, 8 M solution in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was added to a protein sample (10 µl, 10 mg ml⁻¹), followed by 2.5 µl of freshly prepared 200 mM DTT. After incubating the mixture for an hour at 50 °C, 19.5 µl of freshly prepared 200 mM iodoacetamide solution was added to a final concentration of 55 mM and the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. An aliquot of this reaction mixture (36 µl) was added to a solution of 2.5 µg chymotrypsin in 150 µl 100 mM Tris-HCl containing 10 mM CaCl₂. The proteolysis reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature in the dark. The resulting peptides were desalted using a PrepSep C18 solid phase extraction cartridge (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and were subjected to MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer.

*In vitro* reconstitution of wtTHI4p-catalysed reactions. The wtTHI4p, overexpressed in minimal media, was transferred to an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc.). ADP-ribose or NAD (final concentration 1 mM), glycine (final concentration 1 mM) and freshly prepared FeSO₄ (final concentration 0.5 mM) were added to the protein (420 µM) to initiate the reaction. Control reactions were set up by omitting various essential components. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 6 h, heat-quenched and analysed by HPLC as previously described⁸. The concentration of ADT produced was measured by converting it to the fluorescent thiochrome phosphate, as previously described¹⁰.

To observe the time-dependence of the THI4p-mediated reaction, a large scale reaction was set up (3 ml). Aliquots (100 µl) were heat-quenched at appropriate
zymolyase buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl₂, 30 mM TCEP), incubated for 15 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 400g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded (thiamine concentration in this fraction was negligible). The cell pellet was re-suspended in 100 μl of zymolyase buffer 2 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM TCEP) and the cell wall was enzymatically digested with 2 mg ml⁻¹ of zymolyase-100T (1.0 × 10⁵ U g⁻¹), which contained β-1,3-glucan laminarinpentahydrolase (from *Arthrobacter sp.*), β-1,3-glucanase (from *Arthrobacter sp.*), mannanase and protease. The suspension was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with shaking at 60 r.p.m. Light microscopy confirmed complete spheroplast formation. The spheroplasts were then centrifuged at 400g for 5 min and the supernatant was collected in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube (Tube A). The spheroplasts were washed with 100 μl of ice-cold zymolyase buffer 2 followed by centrifugation at 400g for 5 min. and the supernatant was added to Tube A. The spheroplast pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM TCEP, 10 mM KOAc, 1 mM PMSF plus protease inhibitor cocktail (100 mM AEBSF, 500 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 2.2 mM pepstatin A, and 1.4 mM E-64)). The suspension was homogenized on ice in a Dounce homogenizer (1 ml) by 20 strokes with a large clearance pestle “A” (Kontes Glassware). The spheroplast lysate was transferred to Tube A. An equal volume (300 μl) of extraction buffer (lysis buffer plus 0.8 M (NH₄)₂SO₄ and 20% glycerol) was added to Tube A. The tube was agitated on a rocker for 30 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000g. The supernatant (600 μl) was then split into two equal portions. One portion (300 μl) was analysed for THI4p while the other was analysed for thiamine.

To analyse for THI4p, one of the above portions was concentrated to 100 μl and 5 μl from that concentrate was loaded onto a 12% SDS–PAGE along with recombinant THI4p standards (0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 μM). A standard curve was determined with each western blot. The SDS PAGE and quantitative western blot analysis were performed as described above. The THI4p band densities were analysed using the ImageQuant image analysis software provided with the Typhoon Trio.

The second 300 μl portion of the cell lysate was treated with 5 μl of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h to convert the thiamine vitamers to thiamine alcohol. Potassium acetate (50 μl of 4 M) was added to 100 μl of the alkaline-phosphatase-treated sample followed by oxidative cyclization to thiochrome using 50 μl of a saturated solution of K₃Fe(CN)₆ in 7 M NaOH. The oxidation reaction was neutralized after 1 min with 6 M HCl and 100 μl from the reaction mixture was analysed by reverse phase HPLC with fluorescence detection (excitation at 365 nm, emission at 450 nm). The following linear gradient, at a flow rate of 1 ml min⁻¹, was used. Solvent A is water, solvent B is 100 mM KH₂PO₄, pH 6.6, and solvent C is methanol: 0 min, 100% B; 2 min, 10% A, 90% B; 10 min, 25% A, 15% B, 60% C; 12 min, 25% A, 15% B, 60% C; 15 min, 100% B; 17 min, 100% B. A calibration curve was generated using commercially available thiochrome following the same HPLC procedure.

To determine the thiamine content of the lyophilized culture medium, it was re-dissolved in 1,000 μl of double distilled H₂O. This solution (500 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h with 5 mg of acid phosphatase and an aliquot (100 μl) was analysed for thiamine using the thiochrome assay described above.

The THI4/thiamine ratio was determined in quadruplicate (Fig. 4d).

MALDI analysis of native THI4p (ScTHI4p). The yeast cells from the large scale cultivation (6l) were harvested by centrifugation, re-suspended in the appropriate buffer and lysed by the zymolyase-homogenizer method as described above. THI4p was partially purified from the clarified protein lysate by immunomagnetic beads using Anti-His monoclonal antibody coated microbeads (μMACS, Miltenyi Biotec) following manufacturer protocol. The resulting proteins were further purified by SDS–PAGE (12%). Electrophoresis was performed at 110 V and a maximum of 15 mA for 1.5 h. The bands were stained with Coomassie blue. The protein band corresponding to THI4p (confirmed by western blot) was excised and digested with chymotrypsin at 37 °C overnight using the following protocol: the gel slice was washed with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8) and dehydrated with a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN) and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (v/v, 2:1). The washing and dehydrating steps were repeated twice. The supernatant was then removed and the gel slice was dried in a vacuum centrifuge (SpeedVac Concentrator, Savant). Chymotrypsin (Promega) dissolved in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (10 μl of 20 ng μl⁻¹ solution) was added to the dried gel slice. After the gel slice was completely rehydrated, 20 μl of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the gel slice and proteolysis occurred at 37 °C overnight. The chymotrypsin digested sample was acidified with formic acid (pH 2–3), and desalted using a C18 ZipTip pipette tip (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After desalting, the chymotrypsin digested sample was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with the MALDI matrix (5 mg ml⁻¹ α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 50% (v/v) ACN, 10 mM ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) and 1 μl of the resulting mixture was spotted onto a MALDI sample plate. MALDI-MS and MS/MS experiments were performed using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra were acquired using air as the collision gas (medium pressure setting) and at 1 kV of collision energy in the Russell laboratory at Texas A&M University.
