# Receptor signaling and structure: insights from serotonin-1 receptors

## Paul R. Albert and Mario Tiberi

Studies of the serotonin (5-HT) receptors have illustrated several important concepts in G-protein-mediated signaling. These concepts include G-protein specificity and cellular specificity of signaling; mechanisms of transactivation; receptor states and constitutive receptor activity; and the structural basis of coupling. The 5-HT1 receptors couple via specific Gi/Gq proteins to inhibitory pathways [inhibition of adenyl cyclase (AC) activity and regulation of ion channels], but also to stimulate phospholipase C, ACII, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) growth-signaling pathway. 5-HT1 receptors initiate novel endocytotic and Ca²⁺-dependent pathways to activate MAPK acutely, but can downregulate MAPK on chronic activation. These pathways are often mediated via distinct Gi/Gq-protein subtypes. Desensitization by multiple protein kinases via receptor phosphorylation is pathway selective. Structural determination of 5-HT1 receptor and G-protein domains that mediate G-protein-specific coupling and desensitization could lead to the development of highly selective ligands that directly regulate receptor-G-protein coupling.

The serotonin receptors represent one of the largest, most highly conserved and evolutionarily ancient families of receptors¹. These receptors have been studied in organisms ranging from *Caenorhabditis elegans* to humans and play important roles in behavioral modulation. The mammalian 5-HT receptors are composed of several families that can be grouped on the basis of conserved structures and signaling mechanisms. These families include the ionotropic 5-HT3 receptors and G-protein-coupled 5-HT receptors, the 5-HT1 (Gi/Gq-coupled), 5-HT2 (Gq-coupled), 5-HT4/6/7 (Gs-coupled) and 5-HT5 receptors²⁻⁴. This review focuses on the 5-HT1 receptors. As shown in Table 1, there are five known subtypes, all of which are highly conserved and signal through pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi/Gq proteins.

Although similar in structure and signaling properties, these receptors are distinguished by selective ligands and differential distribution in the brain². Importantly, the 5-HT1A receptor serves as the somatodendritic autoreceptor on serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei, whereas the 5-HT1B/1D receptor is a presynaptic receptor on serotonergic and other neurons. Together, these receptors regulate the level of activity of the serotonergic system of the brain by controlling the firing of raphe neurons⁵. In addition, these receptors are expressed at several postsynaptic sites. Considerable interest has focused on the distinct functional roles of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. Mice lacking the gene encoding the 5-HT1A receptor display increased anxiety behavior and stress response, whereas mice lacking the gene encoding the 5-HT1B receptor have increased aggressivity and susceptibility to cocaine addiction⁶. These results from knockout mice are consistent with the important roles of these receptors identified by pharmacological studies in the regulation of mood, emotion, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sexual motivation.

### 5-HT1 receptors: multiple signaling pathways

The 5-HT1 receptors couple to Gi/Gq proteins to mediate a range of actions that include classic inhibitory and cell-specific pathways⁴,⁷. A ubiquitous pathway is Gαi-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation, whereas Gβγ-induced opening of K⁺ channels and closing of Ca²⁺ channels occur mainly in neuroendocrine cells (Table 1). In mesenchymal cells, 5-HT1 receptors mediate ‘stimulatory’ pathways including Gβγ-mediated stimulation of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) and

treatment (1 h) induced a transient increase in Ca²⁺ that led to MAPK activation. Hence, in neurons, inhibitory receptor mechanisms appear to predominate in long-term agonist treatment. However, the detailed G-protein-mediated pathways that lead to acute MAPK activation in fibroblasts or chronic MKP induction in neurons remain to be fully defined.

G-protein specificity: dependence on signaling pathway

The G-protein specificity of 5-HT1 receptor signaling has been examined in detail and reveals a surprising complexity (Fig. 2). Biochemical studies of the 5-HT1A receptor when the gene was expressed in bacteria or insect (Sf9) cells indicate a limited specificity for Gᵢ/Gₒ proteins over Gₛ, Gₕ or Gₜ, although little or no preference within the Gᵢ/Gₒ family was observed²⁰⁻²³. However, studies of 5-HT1A G-protein specificity for coupling to specific effectors in intact systems have demonstrated a higher degree of G-protein specificity. Like many Gᵢ/Gₒ-coupled receptors, the 5-HT1A receptor stably transfected in GH4C1 pituitary cells couples via Gₒ but not Gᵢ, to inhibition of L-type Ca²⁺ channel activation²⁴. This coupling presumably occurs via Gβγ subunit interaction with the channel α1 subunit²⁵. However, the 5-HT1A receptor utilizes Gᵢ but not Gₒ, to couple to inhibition of basal or Gₛ-stimulated cAMP formation. Antisense depletion of Gαᵢ₁⁻₃ in GH4C1 pituitary cells revealed that, although they all participate in 5-HT1A-induced inhibition of cAMP, there is specificity depending on the activation state (e.g. basal, forskolin- or Gₛ-induced) of AC. Depletion of Gαᵢ₁ eliminated 5-HT1A-induced inhibition of basal cAMP, but inhibition of Gₛ-stimulated cAMP was retained. Importantly, a 5-HT1A–Gαᵢ₁ fusion protein strongly inhibited forskolin-induced activation of AC (Ref. 26), suggesting that the Gαᵢ₁ subtype also mediates 5-HT1A-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC. This probably reflects a different Gαᵢ specificity for inhibition of forskolin- rather than Gₛ-stimulated AC, as documented for dopamine D2S receptors in Ltk- and GH4 cells²⁶. By contrast, depletion of Gαᵢ₂ or Gαᵢ₃ blocked 5-HT1A action on Gₛ-induced AC, although basal cAMP inhibition was still observed. Thus, Gαᵢ₁ is coupled to the inhibition of basal and forskolin-stimulated AC, whereas Gαᵢ₂ and Gαᵢ₃ inhibit Gₛ-stimulated AC (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, Gαᵢ specificity was observed in 5-HT1A coupling to stimulation of cAMP. Depletion of Gαᵢ₁ in GH4C1 cells specifically unmasked strong coupling of the receptor to increase cAMP (Ref. 24). The 5-HT1A receptor is coupled via Gαᵢ₂>Gαᵢ₃>>Gαᵢ₁=Gₒ to stimulate the gene encoding ACII, which is strongly expressed in GH4C1 cells, and the ACII protein presumably mediates enhanced cAMP formation in the Gαᵢ₁-depleted cells. Thus, in cells synthesizing Gβγ-stimulated AC subtypes II or IV, the 5-HT1A

address G protein identity or functional coupling to  
effectors. Assessing constitutive coupling of receptors  
to inhibitory responses (such as inhibition of cAMP)  
has proved difficult, in part owing to the complexity of  
determining inhibitory activity in the presence of  
activators. Gi-mediated stimulation of ACII provides  
a stimulatory pathway to address constitutive  
activity and G-protein specificity of 5-HT1A receptor  
signaling. On cotransfection with Go2 and ACII, the  
5-HT1A receptor constitutively activated ACII by a  
PTX-sensitive pathway involving Gβγ subunits36.  
Constitutive 5-HT1A activity appeared to be  
mediated by the release of Gβγ subunits from Gi2 and  
a weak coupling of the receptor to Gs (Ref. 37) to  
activate ACII (Fig. 2).  

Spiperone had no activity as an inverse agonist for  
5-HT1A-Gi2-induced coupling to ACII, although it did  
effectively block 5-HT1A-mediated inhibition of  
Gs-mediated cAMP formation and acts as an inverse  
agonist for 5-HT1A-induced GTPyS binding.  
However, the G protein Gi2 might not support the  
inverse agonist activity of spiperone, because this  
appears to be highly sensitive to G protein structure.  
For example, a point mutation in Gi1 eliminated  
inverse agonist activity of spiperone at the 5-HT1A  
receptor-Gαi1 fusion protein38. Neutral antagonists  
did not alter constitutive 5-HT1A-Gi2-mediated  
coupling to ACII, but anxiolytic compounds (such as  
buspirone) with partial agonist activity at the  
5-HT1A receptor partially inhibited constitutive  
coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to ACII. These  
results suggest that, depending on the signaling  
pathway examined, a receptor ligand might behave as  
an inverse or neutral antagonist (such as spiperone),  
or as a partial agonist or partial inverse agonist (such  
as pindolol or buspirone).  

These observations can be explained using the  
simple two-state model of receptor activation, as  
shown in Fig. 3. In this model, the unliganded  
receptor equilibrates between inactive (R) and active  
(R*) states, and the level of constitutive activity is  
determined by this equilibrium. Agonists  
preferentially bind to and stabilize R* (active form),  
whereas inverse agonists bind to R (inactive form) to  
shift the equilibrium to the left (towards  
inactivation). Neutral antagonists would bind  
equally well to both R and R*, whereas partial  
agonists bind to R* > R (Ref. 39). The level of basal  
activity of the receptor is determined in part by  
receptor structure. We propose that, like receptor  
ligands, G protein effector complexes (Gi2-ACII) can  
influence the basal activity of the receptor by  
preferential binding to different states (R or R*) of  
the receptor to shift its activity to a given response  
(e.g. activation of ACII). In support of this, the  
intracellular Cl catalytic domain of ACV increased  
by three to four orders of magnitude the potency of a  
muscarinic receptor-derived peptide fragment to  
enhance in vitro GTPase activity of Gi (Ref. 40). The  
Cl domain of ACV also enhanced peptide-and

implicated in various signaling pathways of the 5-HT1A receptor. In some cases, Gβγ subunits are  
crucial to the mediation of the response, as indicated. Note that except for ACII, the regulation might  
involve multiple different subtypes (e.g. of AC, gCa2+, Na+/H+), and specific effector subtypes have yet  
to be matched to specific Gα proteins. Arrows indicate positive regulation; bars indicate negative  
regulation. Abbreviations: AC, adenyl cyclase, gCa2+, L-type Ca2+ channel; F-stim, forskolin-

(or 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D) receptor can stimulate rather  
than inhibit cAMP, particularly in the absence of Gi1  
(Ref. 24). A different Gαi specificity was observed for  
the muscarinic M4 receptor, where depletion of Gi3  
permitted stimulation of cAMP as observed in  
hippocampal membranes27. Finally, a striking Gαi  
specificity is observed for 5-HT1A receptor coupling to  
Na+-proton exchange (Fig. 2). With the use of  
transfection of PTX-resistant Gα mutants, Gi2 and  
Gi3 have been shown to mediate 5-HT1A-induced  
Na+-proton exchange, which is independent of Gβγ  
subunits28.  

Constitutive activity: modulation by ligands and  
G proteins  
Constitutive, agonist-independent coupling of non-  
mutated cloned receptors to effectors was initially  
identified for the stimulatory Gq-coupled 5-HT2C  
receptor29 and the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic30 and  
dopamine-D5 (D1B) receptors31. Constitutive activity  
of inhibitory 5-HT1 receptors has been detected by  
enhanced GTPyS binding to membranes, which  
measures activation of G proteins, and has the  
highest affinity for Gs (Ref. 32). Agonist-independent  
5-HT1A receptor-induced binding of GTPyS is  
enhanced further upon the addition of agonists [5-HT  
or 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (DPAT)],  
and is reduced by inverse agonists (such as  
spiperone), whereas neutral antagonists (such as  
WAY100,635) do not significantly alter GTPyS  
binding33–35. The GTPyS binding results do not

Fig. 3. Model for agonist-and G-protein-dependent 5-HT1A receptor activation of ACII. The receptor equilibrates between inactive (R) and active (R*) states, based on the model presented in Ref. 39. Under normal conditions with no agonists and multiple G proteins, the inactive R state is favored. Agonist binding favors R*, whereas partial agonist is intermediate between R and R*. Neutral antagonists bind equally well to R and R* and do not alter the equilibrium. An abundance of the combination of Gi2 and ACII led to a shift to R* for coupling to ACII, thereby constitutively increasing the cAMP level. Agonists did not modify Gi2-ACII activation, whereas inverse agonists or partial agonists reduced the level of cAMP because they induced a shift from R* to R. Abbreviation: AC, adenylyl cyclase.

somatostatin receptor-mediated cyclase inhibition, indicating that ACV enhances the R* state that couples to Gi. When R* is the predominant state (in the presence of a full agonist or of Gi2-ACII), a partial agonist will shift the equilibrium to the R form, inhibiting constitutive activity.

Association of the G protein effector with R* is supported by data indicating that agonist-activated receptors remain associated with G proteins, but goes against the classic doctrine that G proteins dissociate from R*. For example, an increase in the 5-HT1B receptor to G protein ratio enhances the efficacy of partial agonists and constitutive receptor activity41, suggesting that reducing G protein levels stabilizes the R* state. However, in 5-HT1A-PTX-insensitive Go1 (Ref. 38) fusion constructs, there is a twofold enhancement in agonist-independent activity, suggesting that physical association of the G protein enhances the R* state. Similarly, a twofold increase in basal activity was seen upon cotransfection of 5-HT1B and PTX-insensitive Go (Ref. 42). The constitutive activity is caused by the fusion protein because it is PTX-insensitive, and is altered by mutation of the third intracellular receptor domain (i3) 38, in addition to G protein coupling domains43. Furthermore, it appears that receptor interactions with specific G proteins can alter the coupling efficacy of different agonists44, 45, suggesting functional interactions between agonist- and G-protein-induced conformational changes of the receptor.

In addition to the 5-HT1A receptor, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D display constitutive activity in GTPyS binding or in coupling to ACII (Refs 23, 36, 41, 42). Although constitutive activity has been observed in cell lines transfected with genes encoding various

http://tem.trends.com

5-HT1 receptors, this activity is not observed in hippocampal membranes46. Whereas inverse agonists inhibited basal GTPyS binding at the 5-HT1B receptor in transfected cell lines, no effect was seen at endogenous 5-HT1B receptors in striatal membranes. Furthermore, inverse agonists did not produce any effect on basal temperature regulation when injected in the frontal cortex, suggesting a lack of inverse agonist activity47. Hence, inverse agonist activity observed in vitro must be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that the histamine H3 receptor, which displays a high level of constitutive Gi/Gs coupling in CHO cells, has constitutive activity in vivo48. By comparing the actions of inverse agonists of the histamine H3 receptor in the absence or presence of neutral antagonists on H3-mediated inhibition of histamine release in brain synaptosomes, constitutive activity of the endogenous receptor in neurons has been revealed. Thus, the correlation between the anxiolytic properties of partial agonists and the inverse agonism of 5-HT1A coupling to ACII (Ref. 36) in ectopically transfected cells suggests that constitutive activity of this receptor might play an in vivo role in anxiety, and that this might be a useful target for the development of novel compounds.

Desensitization: multiple sites and pathways

The mechanisms of desensitization of 5-HT1 receptors, although similar to those identified for the β-adrenergic receptors, have revealed new and interesting variations that might typify other Gi/Gs-coupled receptor subtypes. One variation from classic desensitization is the pathway-selective uncoupling of receptor signaling by protein kinase C (PKC) 49. Initially, PKC was shown both to phosphorylate the 5-HT1A receptor and uncouple the receptor from some, but not all, signaling pathways. For example, acute activation of PKC blocks 5-HT1A-induced PLC activation (Fig. 1), but does not affect 5-HT1A-induced inhibition of forskolin- or Gs-stimulated cAMP formation. The role of PKA in uncoupling the 5-HT1A receptor is less clear; however, coactivation of protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC leads to enhanced uncoupling of the receptor from PLC activation. Both PKC and 5-HT agonists phosphorylate the 5-HT1A receptor, but at different sites4, 50. Although the specific sites of PKC phosphorylation of the 5-HT1A receptor were not identified, mutagenesis studies suggested that multiple PKC consensus phosphorylation sites in the i3 domain are required for PKC-induced uncoupling49. More recently, the PKC site on the second intracellular loop (i2) of the receptor, T149, has been implicated in coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to N-type Ca2+ channels. Mutation of this single residue renders the receptor resistant to low concentrations of phorbol ester (10nM), which weakly activate PKC (Ref. 51). This suggests that the 5-HT1A receptor provides a high-affinity target for PKC-induced uncoupling of inhibitory regulation of
the N-type Ca²⁺ channel. By contrast, high concentrations of phorbol ester inhibit coupling in 5-HT1A PKC site mutants, suggesting that downstream targets, such as the G protein or ion channel, are phosphorylated at high levels of PKC activation.

Agonist-mediated 5-HT1A receptor phosphorylation in Sf9 cells (largely at Ser residues) was weakly inhibited by PKC or PKA blockers but blocked by heparin, an inhibitor of GRK (Ref. 50). This suggests that GRK might mediate agonist-induced desensitization of the 5-HT1A receptor. However, it has been difficult to demonstrate 5-HT1A receptor desensitization in several systems, possibly because of rapid receptor resensitization. In opossum kidney OK cells that express endogenous 5-HT1B receptors and α₂-adrenergic receptors, GRK2 was implicated in agonist-induced desensitization of the α₂-but not the 5-HT1B receptor⁵². Lacking an effect on 5-HT1B receptor desensitization, overexpression of the gene encoding GRK2 (now known as ADRBK1) enhanced α₂-adrenergic receptor desensitization, whereas overexpression of antisense or dominant-negative GRK2 inhibited α₂-receptor desensitization. These results suggest that heparin-sensitive protein kinases distinct from GRK2 might regulate the 5-HT1B receptor. In summary, agonist-and PKC-mediated desensitization appear to involve distinct phosphorylation sites and kinases.

Similar to PKC, agonist-induced desensitization could involve downstream elements such as G proteins. As observed for β-adrenergic receptor-Gₛ signaling⁵³, 5-HT1A receptor activation enhances Gαᵢ protein palmitoyl turnover, which might lead to uncoupling⁵⁴.

### Signaling domains: important roles for intracellular loop domains

Based on the model of β-adrenergic receptor-Gₛ coupling, putative coupling domains of the 5-HT1 receptors have been examined focusing primarily on the i3 domain proximal to the membrane. Unlike the β-adrenergic receptor, the C-terminus of this receptor family is very short (~15 amino acids), but does contain potential palmitoylation sites. The crystal structure of the G-protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin predicts that the proximal C-terminal domain up to the palmitoylated cysteine residues forms an eighth α-helical domain⁵⁵. Peptides corresponding to the 5-HT1Ai3 domain (C-terminal portion) inhibit forskolin-stimulated AC and attenuate inhibitory coupling of 5-HT1A receptors to AC and T-type Ca²⁺ channels⁵⁶–⁵⁸. Peptides incorporating the 5-HT1Ai2 domain are inactive towards Ca²⁺ channel coupling, but mediate direct, PTX-insensitive coupling to inhibition of cAMP (Ref. 58). Thus, both i2 and i3 domains appear to be important for coupling to inhibition of AC. However, point mutagenesis of these domains does uncouple

the 5-HT1A receptor from Gαᵢ, but i3 mutants favored coupling to Gₛ (Ref. 37). The T149A mutant of the 5-HT1Ai2 domain also does not uncouple the receptor from inhibition of AC, whereas several Gβγ pathways are uncoupled by this mutation³⁶, ⁵¹, ⁵⁹. Hence, the structural basis for 5-HT1 receptor coupling to G proteins remains to be fully elucidated. The structure of these domains is proposed to be an amphipathic α-helix based on structural predictions from the primary amino acid sequences⁶⁰. Although there is considerable sequence divergence in these domains across different 5-HT1 receptor subtypes, the predicted structure of the amphipathic α-helix, with a polar, positively charged face opposite a hydrophobic face, is remarkably conserved⁶⁰. Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the i3 domain have α-helical structure in solution⁵⁸. The rhodopsin structure provides little detailed structure for the cytoplasmic loops, suggesting that helical structures in these domains might be stabilized by other components (the lipid bilayer or G proteins). The i3 domain is proposed to interact with the C-terminal end of the Gαᵢ/o subunit, which is crucial for coupling of receptors and is modified by PTX. Adjacent to the C-terminus, the α4 helix and α4–β6 loop region of Gα reconstitutes coupling to the 5-HT1B receptor in Gαₜ–Gα₁₁ chimeric constructs⁴³, and might serve as an important receptor–G protein contact point. Point mutagenesis of Gα₁₁ residues 300–308 has revealed that Q304 and E308 are the crucial amino acids in the α4 helix for coupling to the 5-HT1B receptor⁴³. Interactions with G proteins that are necessary for coupling might stabilize the predicted α-helical structure of the receptor i2 and i3 domains.

#### Conclusion

The 5-HT1 receptors represent a prototypic Gᵢ/Gₒ-coupled receptor family that has provided novel insights into the diversity and specificity of Gᵢ/Gₒ-mediated signaling. Specific roles for G protein subtypes suggest the possibility of developing novel ligands for the selective disruption of some but not all receptor-mediated signaling pathways. The rational development of such ligands will require a better structural knowledge of the receptor–G protein interface by mutagenesis and ultimately co-crystallization studies. A diversity of mechanisms for receptor desensitization, including PKC, PKA and GRK-mediated phosphorylation, might provide another means of selectively blocking discrete signaling pathways. The identification of both acute positive and chronic negative regulation of the MAPK growth-signaling pathway points to important post-receptor regulatory mechanisms that remain to be fully characterized. The molecular determinants and functional roles of constitutive 5-HT1 receptor coupling need to be better characterized, but might lead to the development of novel anti-anxiety compounds.

# Nuclear receptors in cell life and death

## Lucia Altucci and Hinrich Gronemeyer

The balance between cell proliferation and programmed cell death (apoptosis) determines body patterns during animal development and controls compartment sizes, tissue architecture and remodeling. The removal of primordial structures by apoptosis allows the organism to develop sex specifically and to adapt for novel functions at later stages; apoptosis also limits the size of evolving structures. It is a ubiquitous function that is essential for all cells. Although inappropriate regulation or execution of apoptosis leads to disease, such as cancer, there is now evidence for its great therapeutic potential. This would be particularly true if apoptosis could be targeted at defined cell compartments, rather than acting ubiquitously like chemotherapy. Here, we discuss the potential of nuclear receptor ligands, many of which act through their cognate receptors in defined body compartments as modulators of cell life and death, with special emphasis on the molecular pathways by which these receptors affect cell-cycle progression, survival and apoptosis.

NRS (see Glossary), which comprise the receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones, vitamin D, in addition to many ‘orphans’, are members of a large family of ligand-inducible transcription factors that regulate gene-initiated programs at the basis of a plethora of (patho)physiological phenomena. The recent determination of the crystal structures of NR domains has clarified the intra- and intermolecular mechanisms that initiate receptor activation and signal transduction. All NRs are modular proteins harboring one DBD and LBD (Fig. 1). The LBD also comprises the ligand-dependent AF-2, whereas AF-1 operates autonomously and ligand independently when placed outside the receptor. NRs are transcription factors that: (1) respond directly to a large variety of hormonal and metabolic signals; (2) integrate diverse signaling pathways to targets post-translationally; and (3) regulate the activities of other major signaling cascades (called signal transduction crosstalk).

Growth regulation by NRs: (patho)physiological phenomena

NRs comprise two principal categories: those that stimulate growth and those that interfere negatively with cell proliferation. ERs and ARs are predominantly growth-stimulatory receptors in the major target organs, such as breast and prostate, which is why anti-hormonal therapies are used in the corresponding (hormone-responsive) cancers. By contrast, GRs are mainly antiproliferative because they induce apoptosis in lymphoid cells; thus, GC agonists are useful as anti-leukemia and anti-inflammatory agents. Outside the steroid receptor family, RARs, RXRs, VDR and PPARs have pronounced antiproliferative potential, which is usually linked to the capacity to induce differentiation. However, the distinction between proliferative and antiproliferative NRs is rather artificial. Indeed, depending on the cell context, a receptor can exhibit proliferative or antiproliferative activity.

Sex steroid hormones and their cognate receptors trigger fundamental physiological processes, particularly in primary and accessory sex organs, by regulating cell life and death. A prototypic example is the hormonal control of the mammary gland. Estradiol stimulates directly the formation of terminal end buds and proliferation of the mammary epithelium, effects that are inhibited by antiestrogens¹ and impaired in ERα-deficient female mice², demonstrating an ERα-mediated pathway of estrogen action. Progesterone might also act as a MITOGEN in breast, triggering lobular-alveolar development during pregnancy. PR-deficient mice fail to form a mammary lobular-alveolar structure upon exposure to estrogen and progesterone³.

One of the most clinically important aspects of estrogen is its stimulation of ERα-positive breast
