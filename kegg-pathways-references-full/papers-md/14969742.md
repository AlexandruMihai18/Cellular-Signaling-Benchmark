### Abstract

The homologous regulation of opioid receptors, through G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins, is an initial step in the complex molecular mechanisms leading to opiate tolerance and dependence. This study was designed to evaluate in parallel the contents of immunolabeled μ-opioid receptors (glycosylated proteins), two representative GRKs (GRK 2 and GRK 6) and β-arrestin-2 in brains of opiate addicts who had died of an opiate overdose (heroin or methadone). The immunodensities of μ-opioid receptors were decreased (66 kDa protein: 24%, $n = 24$, $P < 0.0001$; 85 kDa protein: 16%, $n = 24$, $P < 0.05$) in the prefrontal cortex of opiate addicts compared with sex-, age-, and PMD-matched controls. This down-regulation of brain μ-opioid receptors was more pronounced in opiate addicts dying of a heroin overdose ($27 - 30\%$, $n = 13$) than in those who died of a methadone overdose ($5 - 16\%$, $n = 11$). In the same brains, significant decreases in the immunodensities of GRK 2 ($19\%$, $n = 24$, $P < 0.05$), GRK 6 ($25\%$, $n = 24$, $P < 0.002$) and β-arrestin-2 ($22\%$, $n = 24$, $P < 0.0005$) were also quantitated. In contrast, the content of α-internexin (a neuronal marker used as a negative control) was not changed in brains of opiate addicts. In these subjects, there was a significant correlation between the densities of GRK 6 and β-arrestin-2 ($r = 0.63$, $n = 24$, $P = 0.001$), suggesting that both proteins are regulated in a coordinated manner by opiate drugs in the brain. The results indicate that opiate addiction in humans (tolerant state) is associated with down-regulation of brain μ-opioid receptors and regulatory GRK 2/6 and β-arrestin-2 proteins. These molecular adaptations may be relevant mechanisms for the induction of opiate tolerance in brains of opiate addicts.

### 1. Introduction

The regulation of opioid receptors (heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors) is a relevant topic in opiate addiction that has been associated with the phenomena of tolerance and dependence, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations have not yet been fully elucidated [29,36,49]. In this context, the involvement of μ-opioid receptor (MOP receptor) desensitization and/or down-regulation in morphine tolerance and dependence has long been postulated. Thus, μ-opioid receptor down-regulation after chronic opiate exposure clearly has been demonstrated in vitro, but most chronic in vivo administration studies have failed to show reduced binding of radioligands to μ-opioid receptors in brains of opiate-dependent animals [29,31,49] and in brains of human opiate addicts [17]. However, the in vivo induction of μ-opioid receptor down-regulation appears to depend on the intrinsic efficacy of the opiate agonist [9].

The homologous regulation of heptahelical receptors is mediated by a family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK 1–7), some of which translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (e.g., GRK 2 but not GRK 6) to

phosphorylate the agonist-activated receptors [8,26,39]. GRK-induced receptor phosphorylation is followed by membrane recruitment of β-arrestins and the linking of receptors to the clathrin-coated pit endocytic process, which can result in receptor down-regulation [8,26,39]. Numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated the involvement of GRKs (GRK 2/3/5/6) and β-arrestins in the regulation of opioid receptor function [29,31,49]. Moreover, in vivo studies in laboratory animals have also shown that various GRKs and β-arrestins are modulated by acute and chronic opiate agonists [10,24,37]. These studies indicated that specific GRKs and β-arrestins are also important components of the molecular mechanisms leading to opiate tolerance and dependence [29,31,49].

In previous preliminary studies, the immunodensities of μ-opioid receptors (glycosylated protein of ~58 kDa) and total GRK 2 were found unaltered in postmortem brains of opiate addicts [18,37]. Since the regulation of μ-opioid receptors is a relevant topic in human opiate addiction, the present study was designed to evaluate in parallel the contents of immunolabeled μ-opioid receptors (other glycosylated proteins), two representative regulatory receptor kinases (GRK 2 and GRK 6), and β-arrestin-2 in the current larger series of brains (*n* = 24) of chronic opiate abusers who had died of an opiate overdose (heroin or methadone).

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Subject selection and brain samples

Human brains were obtained at autopsy from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Geneva, Switzerland. This study was approved by the research and ethical review board of the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva. The specimens of postmortem human brain were obtained following all the legal procedures of the République et Canton de Genève. Bodies were kept in refrigerated rooms of the mortuary (4 °C) until autopsy. Brain samples (prefrontal cortex) were dissected at the time of autopsy and immediately stored at –80 °C until assay. As in previous studies [14,15,33], the right prefrontal cortex was selected for examination because it includes important areas functionally related to the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system which are relevant to opiate addiction [43,49]. The methodological aspects related to regulatory GRKs and β-arrestin-2 also were investigated in the same region and side of the brain [22].

Specimens of the right prefrontal cortex (Brodmann’s area 9) were collected from 24 well-defined chronic opiate abusers who had died of an opiate overdose (Table 1). The determination of a long-term history of opiate addiction was made by the medical examiner on the basis of the following criteria: (1) the presence of opiate drugs and opiate metabolites on toxicological screening; (2) the police reports following interviews with family members; and (3) the

PMD, postmortem delay (time period from death to the storage of the brain specimen). NQ: not quantitated (abnormal low expression). Cause of death for all opioid addicts was an overdose of heroin [detection of 6-monoacetylmorphine and free morphine (Mor) in blood] or methadone (Met, detection of Met and its metabolite 2-ethylidine-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidone in blood). Quantitative determinations of opiate drugs and other drugs in blood samples and in urine specimens (benzodiazepines and cannabinoids) were performed as indicated in Materials and methods. Bzd, benzodiazepines; Chl, chloroquine; Cit, citalopram; Coc, cocaine; Cod, codeine; Eth, ethanol; Qua, methaqualone; Qui, quinine; Thc, tetrahydrocannabinol; Thio, thioridazine.

<sup>a</sup> Data of the respective matched control subject presented in parentheses.

Toxicology Unit, Institute of Forensic Medicine, using standard procedures which included gas chromatography and/or mass spectrometry analyses (Table 1). Drug screening in blood samples showed the presence of fatal concentrations of morphine (1.15 ± 0.16 μg/ml, \( n = 13 \)) or methadone (0.81 ± 0.13 μg/ml, \( n = 11 \)) in all opiate addicts in whom a heroin (13 cases fulfilled the criteria for the presence of the active metabolite 6-monoacetylmorphine in blood) or methadone overdose was the cause of death. For comparison, in blood specimens of heroin-related deaths, a mean serum concentration of 0.22 μg/ml morphine has been found to be lethal [16,21], and generally it is assumed an average serum concentration of over 0.4 μg/ml methadone is sufficient to cause death in subjects tolerant to opiate drugs [34]. Moreover, the mode of death in these subjects was rapid as revealed by the high concentrations of 6-monoacetylmorphine (detected only for a few hours after heroin intake) and free morphine (data not shown) or methadone in blood [16,21]. In most opiate addicts, the detection in hair samples (3–10 cm from the root) of 6-monoacetylmorphine (range 0.2–13 ng/mg, \( n = 11 \)), morphine (range, 0.2–1.3 ng/mg, \( n = 8 \)) or methadone (range 0.4–14.2 ng/mg, \( n = 9 \)) indicated a long-term abuse of opiates in these subjects (6–12 months before death) [32,44]. Ethanol was found in blood samples of some opiate addicts (0.63 ± 0.25 g/l, range: 0.05–2.44 g/l, \( n = 10 \)), but no evidence of a diagnosis of ethanol dependence was obtained by medical records. Other drugs detected in blood samples of these subjects (e.g., weak concentrations of cocaine) (Table 1) did not appear to alter the status of the target proteins in brains of opiate addicts [14,15,18,22].

Controls specimens (right prefrontal cortex; Brodmann’s area 9) were obtained at autopsy from potential healthy subjects dying in the same period and who met the following criteria: (1) sudden and unexpected death (e.g., motor-vehicle accident; myocardial infarction; gunshot chest wound, homicide); (2) appropriate age, sex, and postmortem delay to match each subject in the opiate addict group; (3) absence of an apparent history of drug abuse or neuropsychiatric disorder; and (4) negative toxicological screening with the exception of ethanol (Table 1). Ethanol was detected in some control subjects (0.61 ± 0.35 g/l, range: 0.05–2.02 g/l, \( n = 6 \)), but also in these, cases no evidence of a diagnosis of ethanol dependence was obtained. The definitive control group consisted of specimens from 18 subjects with an age at death (mean ± S.E.M.: 33 ± 2 years) and a postmortem delay (PMD: 34 ± 4 h) that did not differ from those in opiate addicts (age: 30 ± 2 years; PMD: 34 ± 4 h).

In a given experiment, the immunoreactivities of target proteins in the prefrontal cortex of opiate addicts were compared with those of control subjects that were matched for age (± 8 years), PMD (± 15 h) and whenever possible for sex. The influence of these variables on the target proteins in the brain (μ-opioid receptor, GRKs and β-arrestin-2) were assessed in previous studies [18,22]. The definitive pairs of subjects (opiate addicts and their respective matched controls) are shown in Table 1.

### 2.2. Brain sample preparations and immunoblot assays

Specimens of prefrontal cortex from opiate addicts and healthy controls were dissected on a glass surface cooled with ice and care was taken to include only gray matter (no more than a 1-mm white-matter border was included) in cortical samples. The relative contents of brain μ-opioid receptors, GRKs (GRK 2 and GRK 6), β-arrestin-2, and α-internexin (a 64 kDa neuronal intermediate filament used as a negative control) were assessed by quantitative immunoblotting as described previously [15,22]. Briefly, 200–250 mg of prefrontal cortex was homogenized (1:7.5, w/v) in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mM EDTA, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and various protease inhibitors (1.3 mM pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml E64, 10 μg/ml anti-pain and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) and the mixture was sonicated for 10 s. An aliquot of the previous mixture was combined with solubilization buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% bromophenol blue] to reach a final protein concentration of 3 μg/μl. The mixtures were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and stored at –80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the biuret reaction using bicinchoninic acid for colorimetric detection of cuprous cation (BCA, Protein Assay Reagent; Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL, USA).

In routine experiments, 40 μg proteins (total homogenate) was loaded and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15-well minigels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline solution with 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.2% Tween-20, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing the appropriate primary antibody (overnight at 4 °C). The following primary polyclonal antibody were used: the antiserum MU/2EL, 1:1000 dilution, raised against the peptide sequence 208–216 (TKYRQGSID) of the cloned μ-opioid receptor [19,20,40] was a generous gift from Javier Garzón (Instituto de Neurobiología “Ramón y Cajal”, Madrid, Spain); anti-GRK 2 (C-15, lot D139), 1:5000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); anti-GRK 6 (C-20, lot L159), 1:1000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-β-arrestin-2 (N-16, lot J299), 1:1000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-α-internexin (AB1515, lot 18020268), 1:1000 dilution (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution). The production and specificity of antibody MU/2EL for the detection of μ-opioid receptors (immunoreactive glycosylated proteins of ~63 and 84-kDa in mouse and rat striatum) have been described elsewhere [19,20,40]. The other antibodies used labeled bands with molecular masses of 80 kDa (GRK 2), 66 kDa (GRK 6), 46

kDa (β-arrestin-2) and 64 kDa (α-internexin), as described previously in the human brain [14,22]. Bound antibody (immunoreactivity) was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot detection system (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and visualized by exposure to autoradiographic film (Amersham ECL Hyperfilm) for 1–10 min (autoradiograms).

### 2.3. Quantitation of target protein contents

The autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometric scanning (GS-700 Imaging Densitometer, resolution: 42 μm, Bio-Rad), by measuring the integrated optical density (IOD) units of the immunoreactive bands. In a given experiment, the amount of a target protein in the prefrontal cortex of one or two opiate addicts was compared with that of a control subject matched for sex, age and postmortem delay, and these subjects were run together on the same gel. Prior to analyses, the linearity of protein concentration for Western blotting was ascertained by resolution of selected concentrations of protein (i.e., total protein loaded vs. IOD units, consisting of 4–6 points of different protein content, usually 10/20 to 60/90 μg, resulting in good linear relations) (data not shown) [22]. Experiments in opiate addicts and matched controls were performed by using a protein concentration (40 μg) known to be within the linear range for immunolabeling of the target proteins. This quantification procedure was assessed 2–3 times in different gels. Finally, percent changes in immunoreactivity with respect to control samples (100%) were calculated for each opiate addict in each gel, and the mean value of the different gels was used as a final estimate.

### 2.4. Data analysis and statistics

All series of data were analyzed with the program GraphPad Prism® version 3.0, and all of them followed Gaussian distributions (Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test).

### 3.1. Density of μ-opioid receptors in brains of opiate addicts

In the human brain, the antibody MU/2EL labeled two major bands of about 66 and 85 kDa (glycosylated forms of the μ-opioid receptor) (Fig. 1C), in good agreement with previous findings in the mouse and rat brains [40].

The immunodensities of μ-opioid receptors were significantly decreased (66 kDa protein: 24 ± 4%, *n* = 24, *t* = 5.90,

The amount of total protein loaded per gel well was 40 μg in all cases. The apparent molecular masses of μ-opioid receptor glycosylated forms (66- and 85-kDa) were determined by calibrating the blots with prestained molecular weight markers as shown on the left-hand side. Note that in A1, but not in A2, the immunoreactivities of μ-opioid receptor forms were decreased (15–29%).

$P < 0.0001$; $85 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein: $16 \pm 8\%$, $n = 24$, $t = 2.16$, $P < 0.05$) in the prefrontal cortex of opiate addicts compared with sex-, age-, and PMD-matched controls (Fig. 1A, B, C; see Table 1 for individual values). In these subjects, there was a positive and significant correlation between the densities of $66$ and $85 \, \mathrm{kDa} \, \mu$-opioid receptor proteins ($r = 0.60$, $n = 21$, $P = 0.004$), which indicated the existence of a close relation between these two glycosylated forms of the $\mu$-opioid receptor in each opiate addict. Similar decreases of $\mu$-opioid receptors were also observed in the prefrontal cortex of drug-free opiate addicts (no drugs other than opiates detected) ($66 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein: $28 \pm 4\%$, $n = 16$, $t = 7.18$, $P < 0.0001$; $85 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein: $25 \pm 11\%$, $n = 13$, $t = 2.24$, $P < 0.05$) (Table 1). Other drugs in blood samples of opiate addicts (e.g., cocaine, ethanol) did not alter significantly the status of $\mu$-opioid receptors in the brain (Table 1).

The down-regulation in the immunodensity of brain $\mu$-opioid receptors was more pronounced in opiate addicts dying of a heroin overdose ($66 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein: $30 \pm 5\%$, $n = 13$, $t = 5.83$, $P < 0.0001$; $85 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein: $27 \pm 7\%$, $n = 11$, $t = 3.78$, $P < 0.005$) than in those who died of a methadone overdose ($66 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein: $16 \pm 6\%$, $n = 11$, $t = 2.82$, $P < 0.05$; $85 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein: $5 \pm 13\%$, $n = 10$, $t = 0.38$, $P = 0.71$) (Fig. 1A, B, C). The reduced immunodensity of $\mu$-opioid receptors ($66$- and $85$-kDa proteins) in brains of opiate addicts did not correlate significantly with the plasma concentrations of opiates ($r = -0.10$ and $0.04$, $n = 24$ and $21$, $P = 0.65$ and $0.90$).

### 3.2. Density of regulatory receptor GRKs and $\beta$-arrestin-2 in brains of opiate addicts

In the prefrontal cortex of opiate addicts, the immunodensities of two representative G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK 2 and GRK 6) and that of $\beta$-arrestin-2 were also significantly decreased (GRK 2: $19 \pm 8\%$, $n = 24$, $t = 2.39$, $P < 0.05$; GRK 6: $25 \pm 7\%$, $n = 24$, $t = 3.53$, $P < 0.002$; $\beta$-arrestin-2: $22 \pm 5\%$, $n = 24$, $t = 4.23$, $P < 0.0005$) compared with those in sex-, age-, and PMD-matched controls (Fig. 2A, B; see Fig. 3 for individual values). In drug-free opiate addicts (no drugs other than opiates detected), very similar down-regulations of these regulatory proteins were also found in the brain ($19-24\%$, $n = 16$, at least $P < 0.05$). In these subjects, the immunodensities of GRK 6, but not of GRK 2, showed a trend to correlate inversely with those of $\mu$-opioid receptors ($66 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein vs. GRK 6: $r = -0.46$, $n = 16$, $P = 0.07$; $85 \, \mathrm{kDa}$ protein vs. GRK 6: $r = -0.54$, $n = 13$, $P = 0.05$). Variables such as heroin or methadone overdose, plasma concentrations of opiates and presence of ethanol or other drugs in brain samples did not alter significantly the opiate-induced decreases in regulatory receptor GRKs and $\beta$-arrestin-2 in brains of opiate addicts (data not shown).

Since GRK enzymes and $\beta$-arrestin-2 appear to be regulated in a coordinated manner during the homologous regulation of receptors (e.g., $\mu$-opioid receptors), the relation

The amount of total protein loaded per gel well was $40 \, \mu \mathrm{g}$ in all cases. Note that in A1, and to a lesser extent in A2, the immunoreactivities of GRK 2/6 and $\beta$-arrestin 2, but not that of $\alpha$-internexin, were decreased ($33-48\%$).

The immunodensities of GRK 2 did not correlate significantly with those of $\beta$-arrestin-2 ($r = 0.30$, $n = 24$, $P = 0.16$) in the prefrontal cortex of opiate addicts (Fig. 3A). In contrast, there was a positive and significant correlation between the densities of GRK 6 and $\beta$-arrestin-2 in the same brains ($r = 0.63$, $n = 24$, $P = 0.001$) (Fig. 3B). Further statistical analysis to control for covariates such as the age and PMD of subjects, also resulted in a significant correlation between GRK 6 and $\beta$-arrestin-2 in brains of opiate addicts ($r = 0.67$, $n = 24$, $P = 0.005$). On the other hand, the immunodensities of GRK 2 did not correlate with those of GRK 6 in brains of opiate addicts ($r = 0.04$, $n = 24$, $P = 0.91$) (Fig. 3C), suggesting different properties for the two kinases which belong to different subgroups of the GRK family.

### 4. Discussion

The current results indicate that the abundance of immunoreactive μ-opioid receptor (glycosylated proteins of ~65 and 85-kDa) is reduced in the prefrontal cortex of chronic opiate addicts who died of an opiate overdose. The immunoblot experiments were performed with an antibody (MU/2EL) [19,20,40] directed against the second extracellular loop (peptide 208–216, TKYRQGSID) of the cloned μ-opioid receptor, an important domain for the initial binding of opioid ligands [28,38,50]. Notably, in vivo injection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the μ-opioid receptor markedly reduced the immunodensity of similar peptides (63–84 kDa; MU/2EL antibody) in the mouse and rat brain, demonstrating the association of these glycosylated proteins with the mature μ-opioid receptor [40] (the immunosignals shifted to a lower molecular mass of ~40 kDa after enzymatic deglycosylation, which was coincident with the mass of the cloned receptor) [20]. In immunoblot assays and depending on the experimental conditions and antibody used, peptides of various molecular masses (55–85 kDa) have been reported for the μ-opioid receptor (the N-terminal tail possesses five consensus sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation) [1,2,6,7,29,50].

In human brain specimens of opiate (heroin or methadone)-related deaths, immunohistochemical methods using an anti-opiate antibody have revealed the staining of neuronal bodies, axons and dendrites in various regions (including the frontal cortex), indicating the accumulation of a high concentration of the specific opiate in neuronal structures of opiate addicts [46,47]. In recent postmortem morphometric studies in brains of opiate addicts [41,42], the density of neurons (pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex)
expressing anti-μ-opioid receptor immunoreactivity was shown to be similar to that of control subjects in Brodmann’s areas 10, 24 and 25 [41] but increased (20%) in area 11 [42], suggesting that chronic opiate exposure in humans induces subtle regional differences in the number of μ-opioid receptor expressing neurons. The current results, however, indicate that the immunodensity of μ-opioid receptors (glycosylated proteins of ~65 and 85 kDa; MU/2EL antibody) is decreased in the prefrontal cortex of a well-defined population of chronic opiate addicts. In a previous study [18] the immunodensity of μ-opioid receptors (glycosylated protein of ~58 kDa), quantitated with an antibody directed against the amino-terminal region of the receptor (peptide 1–16, MDSSTGPGNTSDCSDP; MAS/2 antibody) [20,40], was found unaltered in brains of opiate addicts. The reason for this discrepancy is not known but it may be related to the nature of the different antibodies used in the two studies, which probably recognize different forms of the heterogeneous μ-opioid receptor. Interestingly, comparison of both antibodies in the same opiate addicts (n = 12) (present and previous data [18]), clearly indicates that the immunodensity of μ-opioid receptors is found significantly decreased with antibody MU/2EL (25 ± 5%, P=0.0004) but not with antibody MAS/2 (3 ± 5%, P=0.52).

The in vivo down-regulation of μ-opioid receptors after chronic opiate exposure (tolerant state) is still a controversial issue, but much evidence indicates that this phenomenon depends on the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist (e.g., see data for the potent full agonist sufentanil [9]), and also that it may not be essential for the development of tolerance [27,31,49]. Although morphine and methadone are described as partial agonists, methadone can induce μ-opioid receptor internalization and down-regulation whereas morphine only induces receptor down-regulation in clonal and recombinant cell lines expressing the receptor [27,30,49]. However, the present results indicate that chronic heroin (rapidly deacetylated to morphine) was more efficient than methadone in decreasing the immunodensity of μ-opioid receptors in brains of opiate addicts, suggesting that the former opiates are effective in vivo agonists in the human brain. Heroin and morphine also have been shown to be potent in vivo μ-agonists in non-human primates [35]. Similarly to the current results, chronic, but not acute morphine, resulted in a 50% reduction in μ-opioid receptor protein (~70 kDa) in the mouse brain (pons, midbrain and medulla) quantitated by Western immunoassay [2]. Immunohistochemical experiments also demonstrated significant reductions in the immunodensity of μ-opioid receptors after chronic treatment with a selective μ-agonist in the rat brain [45]. In contrast, previous studies had shown that the density of μ-agonist binding sites ([³H]DAMGO) and DAMGO-stimulated [³⁵S]GTPγS binding in cortical brain membranes were not altered in opiate addicts [17,33], which was interpreted as an apparent normal functional activity of μ-opioid receptors in human addicts. In a recent study [25], the specific binding of

[^18F]cyclofoxy (a μ- and κ-opioid receptor antagonist) was found decreased in living brain regions of methadone-maintained former heroin addicts, a reduction probably related to opiate receptor occupancy. It has been suggested that specific antibodies, compared with radioligands, provide a more direct assessment of total receptor densities [45,49]. In this context, and by using a selective antibody (MU/2EL), the conclusion can be made that chronic opiate (heroin, methadone) abuse in humans is associated with down-regulation of μ-opioid receptor proteins in the brain. This receptor down-regulation may be an important mechanism for opiate tolerance in brains of opiate addicts.

The current results also indicate that the immunodensities of GRK 2, GRK 6 and β-arrestin-2 are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of chronic opiate addicts who died of an opiate overdose. These data are in line with the observed down-regulation of μ-opioid receptors and may also be of relevance in the mechanisms of opiate tolerance in brains of opiate addicts. The homologous regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (e.g., μ-opioid receptors) has been shown to involve agonist-promoted receptor phosphorylation by specific GRKs, which is followed by recruitment of β-arrestins and the linking of receptors to the endocytic recycling or degradative process [8,26,39]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that intracellular trafficking of the opioid receptors mediated by specific GRKs (GRK 2/3/5/6) and β-arrestins play relevant roles in the regulation of opioid receptor function [29,31,49]. Thus, recent in vivo studies showed that the functional deletion of the β-arrestin-2 gene in mice resulted in potentiation and prolongation of morphine analgesia [3] and in blockade of opiate tolerance but not dependence [4]. Other in vivo studies have demonstrated that acute treatment of rats with morphine or sufentanil resulted in up-regulation of GRK 2/3/6 and β-arrestin-2 proteins, as well as in GRK 2/5 mRNA expression, and that chronic opiate treatment was associated with marked attenuations of up-regulated GRK 2/3 proteins or even down-regulation of GRK 2 gene expression in the cerebral cortex [12,24,37]. Moreover, chronic morphine administration has been shown to induce the phosphorylation of GRK 2/3 (increased kinase activity) and β-arrestin, which finally resulted in a reduced pool of these kinases by Western analysis [5]. A recent study [13] also demonstrated a modulation of β-arrestin 1/2 mRNA expressions by morphine in the rat brain. These results provided clear evidence for the relevance of specific GRKs and β-arrestin-2 in regulating the function of μ-opioid receptors (and the development of tolerance) in the brain.

The present results (reduced contents of GRK 2, GRK 6 and β-arrestin-2) in brains of chronic opiate addicts (tolerant state) are in general agreement with the above reported findings. Thus, the sustained stimulation of μ-opioid receptors by exogenous opiates would induce down-regulation of the receptors and concomitantly of the associated receptor regulatory proteins. In contrast, chronic treatments of rats with the opiate receptor antagonists naloxone and naltrex-
one have been shown to result in up-regulation of μ-opioid receptor density and also, consistent with the homologous regulation of these receptors, in marked up-regulations of GRK 2/3/6 and β-arrestin-2 proteins in the rat cerebral cortex [10]. It is of interest to note that in drug-free opiate addicts (no drugs other than opiates detected in blood) the immunodensity of μ-opioid receptors showed a clear tendency to correlate inversely with that of GRK 6 (66 kDa protein: \( r = -0.46 \), \( n = 16 \), \( P = 0.07 \); 85 kDa protein: \( r = -0.54 \), \( n = 16 \), \( P = 0.05 \)), but not of GRK 2, which could reflect a better modulation of GRK 6 during the homologous regulation of these receptors (i.e., the higher the content of GRK 6 the lower the content of receptors). In turn GRK 6, but not GRK 2, correlated positively and significantly with β-arrestin-2 in the same brains of opiate addicts (all subjects) (Fig. 3B). These two indirect evidence could suggest a more specific and coordinated modulation of these two regulatory proteins (GRK 6/β-arrestin-2) in the homologous regulation of the μ-opioid receptor during the process of opiate addiction in humans. It is not known, however, whether GRK 6 is in fact able to phosphorylate the μ-opioid receptor (GRK 6 has been implicated in δ-opioid receptor desensitization [48]), but GRK 6 is clearly modulated in vivo and in opposite directions by opiate agonists [24] (current results) and antagonists [10]. On the other hand, the immunodensities of GRK 2 did not correlate with those of GRK 6 in the same brain samples of opiate addicts, a finding also observed in brains of subjects with major depression [23] and which further suggests different regulatory mechanisms for the two kinases in the human brain. Finally, since the ubiquitous enzymes GRK 2/6 can phosphorylate a wide variety of receptors in brain (other than opioid receptors) [8,39], it is possible that the observed decreases in GRK 2/6 and β-arrestin-2 in brains of opiate addicts could also reflect abnormalities of other neurotransmitter receptor complexes during opiate addiction.
