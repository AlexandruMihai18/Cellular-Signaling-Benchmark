SUMMARY  
IN THIS ARNOTT LECTURE, the structure of the small intestinal mucosa has been described, and the specialized rôle that the enterocyte plays in certain digestive-absorptive events has been considered. These features were contrasted with the structural and functional abnormalities which are known to occur in the coeliac enterocyte, particularly in regard to its impaired brush border activity.  

The effect of treatment, either with dietary gluten restriction or with corticosteroid hormones, has been shown to restore many of these known functions to normal. In describing this return to apparent normality it has been possible to examine the hypothesis that coeliac disease might be due to a congenital enzyme deficiency. The evidence presented argues against this idea, but the pathogenesis of this condition in affected individuals is still unknown.  

The various aspects of small intestinal structure and physiology which have been described in this Lecture clearly establish that the enterocyte, with its highly specialized brush border, is an important locus of both digestive and absorptive activity.  

Introduction  
IN THIS LECTURE, the digestive-absorptive functions of the normal enterocyte, and of the coeliac enterocyte, will be discussed with reference to two dietary constituents, carbohydrates and protein. In the light of this information, the hypothesis that coeliac disease may be caused by a congenital peptidase deficiency will be considered.  

The structure of the small intestinal mucosa  
In man, the small intestine is 15–20 feet in length. It is lined by a mucous membrane, the surface of which is increased about six hundred times by the valves of Kerckring, the villous processes and the microvilli. The valves are transverse crescentic folds which encircle the lumen for about two-thirds of its circumference. In cross-section, they are formed by submucosal connective tissue and lined on the outside by the mucous membrane, which consists of muscularis, lamina propria and epithelium. The villi are finger-like projections, each containing a core of lamina propria enclosed within a regular palisade of epithelial cells. In between, the epithelium invaginates the lamina propria to form the tubular crypts of Lieberkühn (Fig. 1a).  

The crypts are lined predominantly by the ‘undifferentiated’ cells, together with goblet cells, and at a deeper level by the argentaffin and Paneth cells. New cells are formed in the crypts and then migrate along each villus to be lost into the intestine from extrusion zones at their tips: in man, it takes about five days for this to occur. The daily production of cells in the intestinal mucosa is of the same order as the output of cells from the bone marrow. Because of the close similarity between both processes, it is becoming fashionable to refer to this process as entero-

poiesis, the precursor cells in the crypts being known as enteroblasts and the mature columnar cells as enterocytes.

During the last 10 years, it has become customary to observe the surface of the small intestinal mucosa with the dissecting microscope¹, through which the shape of the villi may be clearly seen (Fig. 1b). Villi are delicate structures about 1 mm. in height and they vary in shape from long, finger-like processes to wider and shorter leaf-like structures. Because the epithelium is transparent, it is possible to see the fine capillary network which runs beneath the basement membrane.

However, the dissecting microscope has a very limited resolving power, and because the epithelium is transparent it is not possible to observe the cells which clothe the villi. Information of this kind may now be

obtained using the scanning electron microscope, which has recently been applied to studies of the surface structure of the small intestine. With this technique it can be seen that the surface of each villus is corrugated, and at higher magnifications it is possible to see individual enterocytes. They are hexagonal in outline so that together they form a honeycomb mosaic pattern, with goblet cells scattered in between (Fig. 2a). The surface of the cells has a nodular appearance, which is due to the microvilli which cover their luminal surfaces².

Microvilli are discrete structures and were first seen in the transmission electron microscope; they are rod-shaped structures and are about 1 micron in length and 0.1 micron in diameter. On their outer surface they are covered by a fibrillar layer, which is known as the enteric coat or glycocalyx. This layer is known to contain polysaccharide and appears

to be synthesized by each enterocyte: radioactive tracer studies indicate that its turnover time is about 6–12 hours³,⁴. Each microvillus has a well-defined plasma membrane and appears to be supported by fine filaments which are anchored in the apical region of the enterocyte—the part which is known as the terminal web. When the scanning electron microscope is used at high magnification, it is possible to obtain a panoramic view of the brush border or microvilli (Fig. 2b), and it has been estimated that the luminal surface of each enterocyte is covered by 3–5,000 projections, which increase its surface area 30–40 times².

The small intestine in coeliac disease

intestine is lost. When viewed through the dissecting microscope the mucosal surface is flat and often divided into lobular, or mosaic, areas (Fig. 3a). Histologically there is marked hypertrophy of the crypts and an increased number of mitotic figures is present in the germinal epithelium (Fig. 3b). The cells of the surface epithelium are reduced in height, often appear cuboidal in section and look pseudostratified as a result of widespread infiltration by lymphocytes. In the lamina propria there is an increased number of lymphocytes and plasma cells and, using immunofluorescence techniques, it has been shown that the majority of plasma cells contain IgM immunoglobulin⁵, compared with the normal preponderance of IgA containing immunocytes.

New information about the surface structure of coeliac mucosa has been derived from studies using the scanning electron microscope⁶. The mosaic pattern is produced by deep, interconnecting clefts and, in between, the mucosal surface is perforated by the mouths of numerous crypts, which are sometimes ringed by low collars of cells (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the enterocytes are irregular in size and outline (Fig. 5a), which is in striking contrast to the regular hexagonal arrangement of normal enterocytes. The brush border of these damaged enterocytes is disorganized and the microvilli are shorter, clumped and sometimes fused to each other (Fig. 6). Moreover, evidence for brush border damage has been

provided by histochemical studies in which it was shown that there is reduced activity of membrane enzymes, e.g. alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase.

Lysosomes are regularly found beneath the terminal web: they are heterogeneous in shape and content, and are enclosed by a single membrane. They are known to contain various potent enzymes and their rôle is predominantly phagocytic. In coeliac disease, an increased number of lysosomes is found beneath the web of damaged cells, and it has been found that the localization of lysosomal enzymes such as acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase is diffuse. The cellular damage brought about by injurious gluten peptides is perhaps due to lysosomal

DIGESTIVE-ABSORPTIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE ENTEROCYTE

rupture and release of their contained enzymes. Lysosomal rupture, however, is a non-specific response of cells to injury and has been shown to occur in many other situations, e.g. liver disease and hypervitaminosis A.

It is well recognized that dietary folate absorption in coeliac disease is markedly reduced. Circulating folic acid is mainly in the form of pteroylmonoglutamate (PMG) and it has been suggested that dietary folate (pteroylpolyglutamate) is hydrolysed to PMG within the enterocyte. Using the technique of subcellular fractionation, Hoffbrand and Peters<sup>7</sup> have recently shown that the necessary enzyme is probably localized in the lysosomal fraction of guinea pig enterocytes. This observation is interesting because it suggests that lysosomes could have a digestive rôle in folate metabolism. The almost invariable finding of ‘folate’ deficiency in untreated coeliac disease could thus be related to lysosomal damage. On the other hand, it is conceivable that it is related to the enhanced requirements for folic acid, secondary to the excessive desquamation of cells which has been shown to occur in this condition<sup>8</sup>.

Dramatic changes occur in the enterocytes during treatment with a gluten-free diet. They become columnar in shape, lymphocytic infiltration is reduced and the microvilli are restored to normal. In the scanning electron microscope the cells are seen to become more regular in outline (Fig. 5b), and their surface areas increase towards normal. Histochemically, lysosomal integrity is restored since the reaction product of specific enzymes (acid phosphatase) now appears as discrete, supranuclear granules. It has been shown that such changes may occur within a week of excluding gluten-containing foods from the diet of coeliac patients. Corticosteroid hormones also stabilize lysosomal membranes, and the cytoarchitecture of the enterocyte rapidly becomes normal following treatment with oral prednisolone even in the presence of gluten.

**The digestive-absorptive functions of the enterocyte brush border**

Within the last 10 years much research has led to exciting new concepts of the function of the enterocyte, both in health and disease. The old idea that intraluminal digestion is complete and that the intestinal cell functions purely as an absorptive cell has been replaced, since it is now apparent that in each cell the brush border membrane itself is an important site of digestive activity.

**Carbohydrate digestion and absorption**

Carbohydrates form a large part of the diet and are consumed mainly as starch, which is a polymer of glucose. Two molecular types exist, amylose and amylopectin (Fig. 7).

Amylose consists of straight chains of glucose units joined in 1,4 linkage, and has a molecular weight of about \(10^4\). It is acted upon by salivary amylase, but this effect is soon inhibited by the acidity of the

M. N. MARSH

gastric contents since its pH optimum is above 6. Further splitting is carried out by pancreatic α-amylase in the intestinal lumen to yield short oligosaccharide chains—such as maltotetrose and maltotriose.

Amylopectin has a molecular weight of \(10^6\). It consists of linear chains of glucose residues linked in 1,4 sequence, but at intervals branching is introduced into the molecule through 1,6 linkages. α-amylase cannot split 1,6 linkages nor the adjacent 1,4 bonds, so that larger molecules, called α-limit dextrins, are produced, in addition to smaller, linear oligosaccharides which are cleaved from the intervening parts of the original molecule. α-limit dextrins consist usually of 5–9 glucose residues (Fig. 7).

In addition to starch, dietary carbohydrate comprises smaller quantities of the disaccharides, lactose and sucrose and variable amounts of the monosaccharides, glucose and fructose.

![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/yourimage.png)

Fig. 7. The cleavage of starch by pancreatic α-amylase.

For many years it was firmly held and taught that disaccharides were completely hydrolysed by enzymes which were secreted in the intestinal juice, the so-called succus entericus. Although the fundamental importance of the intestinal mucosa as a site of digestive activity had been realized by several workers such as Cajori (1933) and Florey and his colleagues (1941), it was not until 1961 that Miller and Crane demonstrated that purified brush borders obtained from hamster small intestinal cells were rich in several enzymes, including those necessary to split disaccharides. Since then, these workers have clearly shown that these enzymes are actually located within or on the surface of the microvillous membrane⁹.

Furthermore, Ugolev (1965) in Russia showed that the *in vitro* hydrolysis of starch by pancreatic enzymes (α-amylase) proceeded at a more rapid rate in the presence of intestinal mucosa, even though the latter

DIGESTIVE-ABSORPTIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE ENTEROCYTE

had been denatured chemically. He suggested that the enzyme was adsorbed onto the outer surface of the microvilli thus leading to more efficient hydrolysis, a phenomenon which he called 'contact (membrane) digestion'.

Finally, there is evidence from studies using the transmission electron microscope that discrete particles of the order of 60–100 Å diameter may be observed on the outer surface of guinea pig and rabbit brush border preparations when negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid: these particles have been considered to represent disaccharidase enzymes.

It is now generally accepted that various oligosaccharidase enzymes are associated intimately with the plasma membrane of the microvilli (Fig. 8). Maltose and maltotriose are split by α-glucosidase ('maltase'), and α-limit dextrins by α-limit dextrinase (oligo-1,6 glucosidase or 'isomaltase'). Lactose is split into glucose and galactose by β-galactosidase ('lactase'), and sucrose is cleaved by β-fructofuranosidase ('sucrase'). The monosaccharides produced by the brush border oligosaccharidases are subsequently transported across the plasma membrane into the cell. Glucose and galactose are actively transported, and may be inhibited by metabolic antagonists with accumulation of monosaccharide on the luminal side of the brush border. Glucose and galactose appear to share a common transport mechanism, whereas fructose seems to move by a process of diffusion.

**Carbohydrate malabsorption**

In 1958 Durand described a patient who was apparently unable to split dietary lactose and, since that time, numerous reports have appeared in the literature which draw attention to examples of various types of disaccharidase deficiency. These clinical observations have thus revealed a new realm of gastrointestinal disorders of known, specific etiology.

They may give rise to diarrhoea and other abdominal symptoms and may be easily recognized, diagnosed and treated. Apart from their clinical importance, these observations have confirmed *in vitro* findings that specific brush border enzymes split particular oligosaccharides. Some of the causes of sugar malabsorption are listed in Table I, and they are divided into defects of cleavage and those of transport. Although the congenital deficiencies are rare, the recognition of patients with an isolated glucose-galactose transport defect has confirmed experimental data which suggested that these monosaccharides share a common transport mechanism. In these congenital cases, the microvilli are structurally normal when observed by transmission electron microscopy.

In adults, a selective reduction of lactase activity (hypolactasia) is common and appears to be determined by hereditary factors, since it is commonly found in racial groups (e.g. Negroes, Orientals and Indians) and in those of Mediterranean stock. This constitutional defect contrasts

sharply with the marked reduction in the activity of all the oligosaccharidase enzymes, particularly that of lactase, which may be associated with cell damage such as occurs in coeliac disease, tropical strue and kwashiorkor. This was demonstrated in coeliac disease by Plotkin and Isselbacher (1964), who also showed that a return of oligosaccharidase activity followed successful treatment. Two points need to be stressed. First, that in the case of constitutional (adult) hypolactasia, and the other congenital oligosaccharidase deficiencies, the defect is primary and persists throughout life. The other is that secondary deficiencies usually result from severe mucosal damage and, if this can be repaired, activity may be expected to return to normal.

### Protein digestion and absorption

It had been known for several years that the ingestion of proteins was accompanied by a rise of amino-acid concentration in the portal venous blood. This observation, however, raises more problems than it solves.

DIGESTIVE-ABSORPTIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE ENTEROCYTE

For instance, is it possible that whole proteins can be absorbed by the enterocyte? Specific examples of this phenomenon have been well documented, e.g. in neonatal animals whole colostral protein is absorbed intact for several days after birth. With increasing maturity this process ceases—an occurrence which is termed ‘closure’—and with this cessation of activity the structure of the intestinal cells comes to approach that of the adult of the species. By this process, various animals acquire immunoglobulins from the maternal milk in the first few hours of life¹⁰.

Another point which was established by Nasset is that, although the amino-acid composition of the gastric contents is related to dietary protein intake, the pattern in the small intestine is more like that of the portal blood. In fact a large quantity of protein, of the order of 200 gr., is secreted into the intestinal lumen daily, and consists of various enzymes,

blood-group glycoproteins, albumen, mucus and protein derived from desquamated enterocytes. This amounts to more than three times the average daily protein intake. Thus not only are the exogenous dietary proteins degraded and absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, but also the many types of protein which are endogenously secreted into the lumen.

With these considerations as a background, it is now possible to consider what is known to-day about protein digestion and absorption and, secondly, to discuss what rôle the enterocyte plays in this function. In 1951, Wiseman¹¹ showed that L amino acids are actively transported in preference to their D isomers. A few years later, Fisher (1954) pointed out that *in vitro* proteolysis is slow and incomplete, and concluded that pepsin and trypsin give rise to small peptides and not individual amino acids. Following this Crane and Neuberger (1960) indicated that

M. N. MARSH

either whole protein, or protein hydrolysates, were absorbed at similar rates. Subsequently Newey and Smyth¹² made the important suggestion that the final stages of peptide hydrolysis to yield amino acids might be performed within the cell by intracellular peptidases.

To investigate this concept in greater detail the distribution of di- and tri-peptide activity was determined in subcellular fractions of guinea pig mucosa¹³ which were prepared by established methods. The results showed (Table II) that for each brush border preparation investigated only 10% or less of the total recoverable activity against dipeptides was present in these fractions, whereas between 20% and 60% of the total tripeptidase activity (with the exception of L alanyl-glycyl-glycine) was located in this region of the enterocyte.

Further studies were conducted in order to investigate the activity of brush border preparations towards a series of oligopeptides, up to and including hexaglycine. These results (Table III) showed that significant activity was demonstrable against every oligopeptide, with the exception

of diglycine, and that this activity was graded, in that the rate of hydrolysis of hexaglycine was more rapid than that of triglycine. However, approximately equimolar amounts of glycine were released from each substrate, suggesting that the brush border oligopeptidases are exopeptidases. Further evidence was provided by blocking the C- or N-terminal end of each molecule; it was found that amino-acid residues were cleaved sequentially only from the N-terminal end.

With these observations in mind, it is possible to create a model for protein digestion (Fig. 9). Dietary protein is acted upon by gastric and pancreatic proteases to yield small peptides, and perhaps some amino acid. The oligopeptides are then hydrolysed by amino-polypeptidases located in the brush border region of each enterocyte. As they percolate through this molecular sieve, dipeptides are released which pass into the cell. Here they are split by intracellular dipeptidases into their constituent amino acids. From there they pass into the portal venous system and thence to the liver.

DIGESTIVE-ABSORPTIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE ENTEROCYTE

# Protein absorption in coeliac disease

The manner in which protein is digested and absorbed by the normal enterocyte is important because it reflects critically upon one of the major hypotheses that has been advanced to explain the pathophysiology of adult coeliac disease. In 1950, Dicke in Holland made the important clinical observation that the malabsorption of coeliac disease was caused by the gluten fraction of wheat flour. Dietary restriction of flour-containing foods led to clinical remission, while relapse occurred if gluten was re-introduced. On the basis of these findings Frazer suggested that the congenital absence of a gluten-splitting enzyme (i.e. a peptidase) might explain the metabolic basis of this condition. Furthermore, this attractive idea was supported by the observation that the toxic effects of a peptic-tryptic digest of gluten could be abolished after further incubation with hog intestinal mucosa¹⁴.

![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/yourimage.png)

Fig. 9. The proposed rôle of the enterocyte in the digestion and absorption of dietary protein (from Peters, Hoffbrand and Booth (1970), 7th Int. Congr. Clin. Chem., Geneva. Karger, Basle; 4, 1069).

One difficulty that arises here is that the mode of inheritance in the family pedigrees of coeliac patients does not appear to follow any recognizable Mendelian pattern and, furthermore, discordance for the disease has been recorded in one pair of identical twins. If coeliac disease were due to a congenital peptidase deficiency it follows that the disease should be recognized in children and, secondly, that it should occur with greater frequency in the near relatives of affected individuals compared with a matched sample of control subjects. These criteria have been established, but like any congenital enzyme defect (i.e. galactosaemia or G6PD deficiency) the biochemical lesion should persist throughout life. Indeed, patients commonly present with malabsorption due to coeliac disease late in life and many give a clear history of intestinal disorder in early childhood. Therefore it should be possible to demon-
strate the supposed enzyme defect at any time, irrespective of any apparent clinical cure which might have been secured by dietary gluten restriction.

This hypothesis was tested by determining the peptidase activity in homogenates of small intestinal mucosa obtained from patients with untreated and treated coeliac disease. In untreated coeliac disease, such activity towards two dipeptide substrates (glycyl-glycine and L leucyl-L leucine) was significantly reduced when compared with normal mucosa tested under the same conditions: following treatment with a gluten-free diet or corticosteroid hormones, the dipeptidase activity of the mucosal homogenates differed insignificantly from the control material. These findings indicated that, for the two specific dipeptide substrates used, a primary deficiency of the appropriate enzymes was not established. To overcome the objection that these synthetic peptides are unrelated to gluten peptides, mucosal homogenates were next incubated with a peptic-tryptic digest of gluten, which is a mixture containing several peptides rich in proline and glutamic acid. After incubation at 37°, the amount of each amino acid which was released from the mixture was determined. Only small amounts of proline and glutamic acid were released by mucosa obtained from untreated coeliac patients compared with control mucosa whereas, after treatment, there was a clear rise in the amount of amino acid released. These results suggested that histological repair of the coeliac mucosal enterocytes was accompanied by a return of peptidase activity towards these gluten peptides¹⁵.

These studies not only illustrate that mucosal activity towards gluten peptides returns to normal levels after treatment, but in addition they argue strongly against the idea of a congenital peptidase deficiency. These findings are reminiscent of the rise in mucosal disaccharidase activity which was shown to occur in treated coeliac patients and which were considered to be a reflection of non-specific mucosal injury.
