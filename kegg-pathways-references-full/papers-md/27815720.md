## Abstract  
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle involved in cellular homeostasis and control of protein quality. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular response to ER stress and promotes cell survival. Severe or prolonged stress activates apoptosis signaling to trigger cell death. In mammals, the UPR is initiated by three major ER stress sensors, including inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase 1, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase and activating transcription factor 6. UPR dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease, which is characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins. ER stress mediates the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia, sleep fragmentation and post-traumatic stress disorder. The role of UPR in the neuropathology of humans, cell lines and animal models, is established. Therefore, inhibition of specific ER mediators may contribute to the treatment and prevention of neurodegeneration. Preclinical studies have shed light on the potential therapeutic strategies. Here, we will review the evidence of UPR activation in neurodegenerative disorders and psychiatric diseases along with the methodology.

In this review, the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric diseases would be summarized according to a number of studies from humans, cell lines and animal models.

## Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress  

### ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR)  
ER is an essential intracellular organelle mediating the synthesis and export of proteins and glycoproteins, and maintenance of Ca${}^{2+}$ homeostasis. It is the site of translation, folding and transport of newly formed proteins in the cell membrane, which are integral membrane proteins and transmembrane receptors or proteins secreted by exocytosis. Disruption of these physiological functions leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins and induces the unfolded protein response [1, 2]. Normally, accurately folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus. Unfolded proteins, with functionally inactive structures, are retained in the ER until they attain appropriate conformation. If the final tertiary structure cannot be attained, unfolded proteins are translocated to the cytosol and subjected to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation, known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Accumulation of

unfolded proteins in the ER triggers the expression of ER chaperones to eliminate the misfolded or unfolded proteins. UPR quickly reduces the need for ER proteins and eliminates the misfolded proteins via protein degradation mechanisms such as translocation of misfolded proteins out of the ER into the cytoplasm. When the capacity of the ER is saturated, UPR induces the synthesis of molecular chaperones and other components for accurate folding of proteins [3, 4]. Improved folding and processing reduces secretion of proteins into the ER compartment. UPR activation is mediated via three ER stress pathways: inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) and protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK). PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 contain two domains in the ER lumen and the cytoplasm, respectively. The domain in ER lumen is activated by the accumulation of misfolded protein; Cytosolic domain activates downstream signaling effectors (Fig. 1). If the adaptive capacity of the UPR is exceeded, pro-apoptotic events are triggered including up-regulation of a number of cell death genes including caspase-12 and their eventual activation. CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein, also known as growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153 or GADD153) is strongly stimulated by the main components of UPR, including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), ATF6 and X box binding protein-1 (XBP-1), The overexpression of these genes induces apoptosis via the anti-apoptotic factor B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family of proteins [5]. ER shows abnormal enlargement and loss of ribosomes (Fig. 2).

The accumulation of misfolded proteins is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease (HD). In addition, recent studies also suggest that misfolded proteins mediate abnormal neuronal death in psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Animal models and transgenic species represent powerful biological methods to investigate these diseases. In the last few years, ER stress levels and UPR activation in neurodegenerative disease have been studied in humans and animals. In this review, we focus on recent findings affecting the three signal transduction pathways in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disease.

PERK pathway

PERK is a type I ER transmembrane protein, containing a structurally and functionally related luminal sensor domain and a divergent cytoplasmic ser/thr protein kinase domain [6, 7]. PERK is characterized by a short hinge loop connecting the large C-terminal lobe with a smaller N-terminal lobe [8].

The dissolution of PERK with the ER chaperone glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78, also called BiP: immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein) induces the activation of its kinase domain via oligomerization and autophosphorylation [9, 10]. Phosphorylated PERK (p-PERK) induces the phosphorylation of α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF2α) at ser51 [7, 11]. Phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α) also promotes the translation of mRNAs such as ATF4 [12]. ATF4 acts as the upstream activator of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transportation, as well as genes related to apoptosis, including ER chaperone and CHOP [13].

CHOP has a negative feedback loop involving growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), which is the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) that dephosphorylates eIF2α [14]. CHOP activity is also enhanced at the post-transcriptional level during the cross-talk between PERK/eIF2α pathway and IRE1/tumor necrosis factor associated factor 2 (TRAF2)/apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) pathway [15]. PERK⁻/⁻ cells display hypersensitivity to ER stress [6]. Meanwhile, perk⁻/⁻, atf4⁻/⁻ cells and eIF2α knock-in cells under the genetic manipulation of mice fail to induce CHOP during ER stress, which suggests that CHOP induction is highly PERK-dependent [5]. To conclude, PERK activation protects against mild ER stress, and the induction of CHOP is an important element in the switch to pro-death signaling.

PERK also mediates phosphorylation of nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF2) and promotes its dissociation from Kelch-like Ech-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) [16]. The NRF2 translocated to the nucleus activates the genes related to antioxidant proteins and detoxifying enzymes, such as A1 and A2 subunits of glutathione S-transferase, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and others (Fig. 3) [17].

IRE1 signaling

IRE1 [18] is also a type I ER transmembrane protein with an ER luminal dimerization domain that senses ER stress, and a cytosolic domain containing ser/thr kinase and endonuclease activities. The mammalian genome encodes two isoforms of IRE1: IRE1α and IRE1β [19]. Most mammalian UPR research is conducted on IRE1α. IRE1α signaling is a positive regulator of cell survival and terminated during irremediable ER stress resulting in apoptosis.

Under ER stress, misfolded proteins in the ER are sensed by the luminal domain of IRE1α. The dissociation of BiP from the luminal domain of IRE1α triggers the activation of IRE1, leading to oligomerization, autophosphorylation of its kinase domain, and activation of endoribonuclease domain of IRE1α, resulting in the cleavage of mRNA encoding the basic leucine zipper protein (bZIP) transcription factor Hac1 in yeast or XBP1 in metazoans. IRE1-mediated removal of a 26-nucleotide-long intron introduces a frame-shift mutation and an alternative C-terminus in the spliced form of Xbp1 (Xbp1s). In turn, XBP1s up-regulates the transcription of UPR target genes, which promote protein folding and ERAD [20]: (1) binding to ER stress element (ERSE) induces the transcription of GRP78 and CHOP; (2) binding to UPR element (UPRE) induces the transcription of ER degradation-enhancing alpha mannosidase-like protein (EDEM), which promote ERAD; (3) induction of the expression of P38INK down-regulates the phosphorylation of PERK and induces the expression of CHOP (Fig. 4).

Fig. 3 The PERK pathway. Activation of PERK can cause the phosphorylation of eIF2α, which is important in blocking general protein synthesis. p-eIF2α lead to the increased translation of the transcription factor, ATF4. ATF4 translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of many genes required for amino acid metabolism and transport. ATF4 also can up-regulate the expression of CHOP,

and then activate the transcription of GADD34. GADD34 then promote the dephosphorylation of p-eIF2α with PP1, and elevate the protein loads into the ER. NRF2 is also a substrate of PERK. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of NRF2 induce the dissociation from KEAP1, resulting in the accumulation of NRF2 in the nucleus. NRF2 binds to the antioxidative stress genes

cell death. (4) Activated IRE1 RNase may cause the decay of ER-localized mRNAs, in particular the rapid decay of select microRNAs. The translation of pro-apoptotic protein is regulated by IRE1 by terminating microRNA biogenesis [24]. (5) Cyclin-dependent 5 (CD5) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKKK) mediate an ER stress-induced apoptosis signaling pathway. CDK5 phosphorylates MAPKKK and the JNK pathway is phosphorylated to initiate apoptosis [25].

ATF6 pathway

ATF6, also known as bZIP, is an ER-associated type II transmembrane protein with three structural domains: a luminal C-terminal, a transmembrane and a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain [26]. Two isoforms have been described: ATF6α and ATF6β [27, 28]. ATF6α has a higher transcriptional activity compared with ATF6β. In the lumi- nal domain, ATF6 contains Golgi localization sequences

(GLS), two in the ATF6α isoform (GLS1 and GLS2) and one (GLS2) in the ATF6β isoform.

The luminal regions of ATF6 associate with the ER chaperone GRP78 [29–32] under non-stressed conditions. BiP dissociates from the N-terminus of ATF6 under ER stress, altering ATF6 to different states [9] followed by translocation and activation. However, the mechanism of BiP interaction with ATF6 and the factors controlling ATF6 translocation to the Golgi remain uncertain [33, 34]. ATF6 translocated from the ER to the Golgi, is cleaved sequentially by a site 1 protease (S1P) and a site 2 protease (S2P); the liberated N-terminal cytosolic domain is then transferred into the nucleus (Fig. 5).

A gene expression program is induced by cleaved ATF6, in conjunction with other bZIP transcription factors and co-regulators, such as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) [35, 36], increasing chaperone activity as well as the degradation of unfolded proteins [37, 38]. For example, ATF6 up-regulates BiP, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and EDEM1 expression. Additionally, ATF6 induces the expression of XBP1. XBP1 is processed by activated IRE1α, and induces the expression of chaperones as well as the control elements such as P58INK [39]. The ATF6-induced gene expression program is also cytoprotective. For example, ATF6 induces regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) expression [40]. RCAN1 sequesters calcineurin, a calcium-activated protein phosphatase B that dephosphorylates BCL-2-antagonist of cell death (BAD) at S75 or S99 [41], which leads to sequestration of BCL-2 by BAD, and inhibition of downstream anti-apoptotic activity [42]. Researchers speculate that ER stress dissociates BiP from ATF6 by actively restarting the BiP ATPase cycle. Nadanaka et al. [43, 44] found that under ER stress induced by both dithiothreitol and tunicamycin, the disulfide bonds are reduced, and only monomeric ATF6 reaches the Golgi.

### Alzheimer's disease

AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) [45]. It is characterized by increased production, oligomerization

Fig. 5 A model for the activation of ATF6. ATF6 (α,β) is transported from the ER to the Golgi in response to ER stress, and the N-terminal cystolic portion of ATF6 is released by the sequential cleavage with

and aggregation of amyloid-β peptides (mainly Aβ40 and Aβ42), which are cleaved from the amyloid β-precursor protein (APP) by the β-secretase (BACE) and γ-secretase complexes. Aβ is the main component of extracellular senile plaques causing neurotoxicity in AD. It triggers neurodegeneration and apoptosis, leading to memory failure associated with AD. AD cognitive disorder is induced by small soluble oligomers of Aβ peptides. More than 1000 studies support the oligomer hypothesis [46]. In addition, oxidative stress, synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration are also play a significant role. However, the pathogenesis of AD still remains unclear.

A number of studies indicated the effect of stress on cellular organelles such as mitochondria, ER and Golgi. Abnormal ER structure and function play a key role in AD. The mechanisms associated with ER stress in AD are diverse and complex, ranging from genetic changes to protein folding. These reports suggest the presence of ER stress in postmortem brain samples of AD patients as well as animal and in vitro models. AD is classified as familial AD (FAD) and sporadic AD (SAD). Recent advances in genetic analysis identified the causative gene mutations,

proteases S1P and S2P. The free ATF6 fragment is then transferred into the nucleus activating transcription of ER chaperone genes by binding to ERSE

associated with APP, presenilin-1 (PSI), and presenilin-2 (PS2) in AD [47]. ER stress is also involved in the synthesis of Aβ, BACE and γ-secretases associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease [48].

Studies suggest that UPR is involved in the early stages of AD pathology [49]. Activation of UPR in the hippocampus and temporal cortex suggests the increased presence of phosphorylated IRE1 (p-IRE1), p-PERK, and p-eIF2α in AD neurons. Overall, the level of BiP and the p-IRE1 in AD neurons correlates with the presence of abnormal Tau proteins [50]. In vitro studies suggest that the activation of UPR induces the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) [51], which is a major kinase involved in the phosphorylation of tau in the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In vitro data indicate that the p-IRE1α, p-PERK, and pIRE1α-positive granules are surrounded by a halo similar to granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD), which is predominant in the hippocampal neurons of AD and characterized by basophilic granules [52]. Reduction in Aβ levels was mostly correlated with attenuated ER-stress and vice versa. For example, aged PS2-mutant mice showed BACE-1 inhibition in brain tissues following treadmill

exercise. It was accompanied by the down-regulation of GRP78 and PDI enzymes as well as inhibition of PERK, eIF2α, ATF6 and XBP1s [53].

PERK

Hoozemans et al. found that the expression of p-PERK and p-eIF2α was increased in the hippocampal neurons of AD, especially in neurons containing granulovacuolar degeneration [54]. Studies in different groups demonstrate increased levels of p-PERK and p-eIF2α in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of AD [50, 55].

Mouton-Liger’s team and O’Connor’s group revealed a statistically significant correlation between BACE1 levels and eIF2α activation in human AD brain [56, 57] but not between PERK activation and BACE1 levels or Aβ [57]. Treating BACE1-293 cells for 24 h with salubrinal, which is a selective inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation prevents PP1/GADD34 complex formation [58], and selectively inhibits eIF2α dephosphorylation leading to increased BACE1 levels [56]. The PS1 mutation inhibited the phosphorylation of eIF2α in SK-N-SH cells, which resulted in abnormal cell survival [59]. Significantly increased levels of p-eIF2α in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice carried the mutant human APP695 gene [60]. The p-eIF2α level was greatly increased along with elevated BACE1 [56, 57, 61] Meanwhile, p-eIF2α was significantly increased immediately after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Aβ oligomers (AβOs) in mice [62].

p-PERK was also involved [63]. These studies suggest that PERK plays a more significant role in cell survival mechanism than apoptosis in ER stress-induced Aβ neurotoxicity. However, Spataro and Robinson failed to observe any altered tau biology following chemical induction of UPR in SH-SY5Y cells suggesting the absence of a link between tau aggregation and ER stress in neurodegeneration, and emphasizing the role of Aβ in UPR activation in AD patients [64]. Hoozemans also found that the percentage of p-PERK-immunoreactive neurons associated with the phosphorylated tau protein and p-PERK is related to early ubiquitin pathology in AD hippocampus [54]. These conclusions have been confirmed in a wide range of studies [65, 66]. Exogenous Aβ activates UPR in SK-N-SH cells. Short-term treatment of Aβ selectively enhanced the activation of PERK pathway in neurons. Further, treatment for Aβ and silencing of PERK slightly increased apoptosis compared with transfection using the control siRNA [67]. The levels of ATF4 were also increased whereas p-PERK remained normal [62]. In contrast, Spataro’s team failed to find UPR activation in transgenic mice expressing tau [64].

In conclusion, the modulation of PERK-eIF2α pathway represents a potential therapeutic target in AD. However, questions related to the precise mechanism still persist. For example, it is still unclear whether p-eIF2α was activated in UPR regulation [68]. On the one hand, PERK pathway is neuroprotective against AD. On the other hand, salubrinal is protective in neuronal cells under ER stress [58]. Therefore, additional studies are needed to determine the detailed mechanisms of regulation underlying protection against AD.

IRE1

PS1 binds directly to IRE1α on the ER membrane leading to of IRE1α autophosphorylation in response to ER stress. Katayama used immunofluorescence microscopy to study the subcellular localization of PS1 and IRE1 in SK-N-SH cells and found that PS1 was preferentially distributed in the ER and Golgi [69]. As mentioned above, activation of IRE1 is triggered by dissociation of GRP78/BiP and the PS1 mutations altered the dissociation and inhibited the activation of IRE1 during ER stress [70, 71]. Some group studied PS1 knock-out mouse fibroblasts and report that the C-terminal domain of IRE1α was cleaved by PS1 [59]. The PS1-deficient cells decreased the sensitivity to UPR by reducing nuclear accumulation of C-terminal fragments of IRE1 [72]. Sato and his groups obtained PS2V (a mutated form of PS2) from SAD brains with a high frequency and indicated that the excretion of Aβ1-42 was increased in cells expressing PS2V and cells expressing dominant-negative IRE1 [73]. Modulation of IRE1 activity influenced XBP1 splicing suggesting that PS1 mutation delayed the splicing of XBP1 and switch to the pro-death response [74]. A number of XBP1 target genes have been associated with AD [20]. XBP1 binds to the promoters of ubiquilin1 (UBQLN1), which is a negative regulator of the γ-secretase complex controlling APP trafficking and generation of Aβ. Evidence suggested that ASK1 might be a novel therapeutic mechanism to prevent and treat AD. The ASK1-mediated JNK pathway is involved in AD pathogenesis by increasing Aβ production, enhancing the inflammatory response and inducing NFT aggregation [75]. The Aβ activated the ASK1 cascade in SH-SY5Y cells [76, 77].

Generally, studies demonstrated that PS1 and PS2 mutations increase the vulnerability of cells to ER stress and induce apoptosis in FAD and SAD, respectively. In addition, the XBP-1 splicing controls the trafficking of AD-related APP and generation of Aβ during disease development. The ASK-1-mediated JNK pathway is activated by Aβ with SH-SY5Y cells and promotes apoptosis and controls cell fate.

ATF6

Katayama’s groups found that PS1 was associated with the cleavage of ATF6 on the ER membrane. However, the

conversion of p90ATF6 to p50ATF6 was intact in PS1 cells, suggesting that PS1 was not associated with the proteolysis of ATF6. This conclusion was supported by the lack of changes in ATF6 processing in cell lines expressing dominant-negative PS1 that was mutated at aspartate at residues 257 or 385. PS1 mutation inhibits ATF6 activation [59]. In contrast to native PS1, FAD-linked PS1 mutants inhibited the cleavage of p90ATF6 via poorly defined mechanisms. Furthermore, results suggest that FAD-linked PS1 mutants inhibit the activities of S1P and S2P, which are sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). FAD-linked PS1 mutations do not inhibit the processing of SREBPs. The present review found that down-regulation of BiP by FAD-linked PS1 mutant is related to attenuate signaling of the UPR via decreased levels of phosphorylated Ire1 and inhibition of ATF6 under ER stress. Pinkaew and his colleague investigated the expression of ER stress proteins including ATF6, CHOP and cleaved caspase-12 using Western blot, and showed that the optimal expression occurred at 12, 24 and 9 h, respectively, after exposure to Aβ. Overall, the result suggested that the expression of ER stress proteins increased in a time-dependent manner, with the maximum level observed between 9 and 24 h

in the SK-N-SH cells treated with Aβ. They also demonstrated that Aβ induced the up-regulation of BiP, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, and cleaved ATF6α [78]. However, as stated before, ATF6 remained unaltered in the AβO-injected mice. The AβO expression in the central nervous system triggered peripheral metabolic deregulation [62].

The different role of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 in AD from patients, animals and cell lines was listed in Table 1.

Parkinson's disease (PD)

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder after AD affecting 0.6% of the population aged between 65 and 69 years and 2.6% of those aged between 85 and 89 years [79]. It is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in striatum and substantia nigra (SN) and accumulation of modified α-synuclein (α-syn) in the degenerating neurons termed as Lewy bodies. Dopamine transmission between SN and other regions in the brain regulates voluntary movements of the body. Low levels of dopamine interfere with movement, leading to Parkinsonian symptoms [80]. Studies suggest

that oxidative stress contributes to loss of dopaminergic neurons via impaired calcium homeostasis and dysfunction of mitochondria, ER, and Golgi apparatus [81]. Accumulating evidence suggests that UPR mediates neuronal death in PD [5, 82]. On the other hand, α-syn, composed of Lewy bodies, plays a key role in PD pathogenesis. Mutant genes were found to regulate protein stability: α-syn (proteasome), parkin (E3 ligase), DJ-1 (redox sensor) and PINK1 (protein stability). Several neurotoxins, such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), have been used to mimic certain aspects of PD.

Recent evidence demonstrates that formation of misfolded proteins such as, parkin and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) are linked to the development of PD. Thus, neuroprotective therapies should be aimed at the prevention of aggregation of misfolded proteins [83].

### PERK

The p-PERK and p-eIF2α were elevated in SN of the postmortem brain tissue in PD patients. The p-PERK was found only in neurons containing α-syn. However, not all α-syn neurons were p-PERK-positive though p-PERK and α-syn showed different subcellular localization [84]. As for eIF2α, some studies discovered that the α-syn levels correlated with increased levels of p-eIF2α but not p-eIF2α. Smith and his colleague found increased levels of p-eIF2α in A53T alpha-synuclein-induced cells, in which gene mutations led to dominant familial PD. ER stress leads to decline of caspase-12, which protects cells from death. They also discovered that salubrinal acted partially against cell death and reduced the toxicity of αS transgenic mouse [85]. Similar results were found in other groups [86]. The eIF2α phosphorylation was induced by PD mimetic 6-OHDA and MPP+ in MN9D cells and PC12 cells. Specifically, 6-OHDA exposure triggered a prolonged phosphorylation of eIF2α. However, MPP+ exposure induced a rapid and transient response [87].

ATF4 was increased in neuromelanin-positive neurons in the SN of PD patients [88]. The increased expression of ATF4/CREB-2 (cAMP-response element binding protein CREB) in the SN of SYN120 transgenic mouse models of PD overexpressed truncated α-syn. Accumulation of α-syn induced ATF4, which suggested that activation of the PERK pathway by α-syn played an additional pro-apoptotic role in PD progression [89]. ATF4 protected the primary midbrain dopaminergic neurons against cell death induced by the two types of neurotoxins in Parkinson's: 6-OHDA, MPP+. Parkin is located downstream of ATF4 and plays an important role in cell survival in PD cellular models. Bouman’s team also found that the parkin expression was decreased in the primary cortical neurons

of ATF4-knockout mice. Similarly, decreased up-regulation of parkin induced by ER stress (thapsigargin) was observed in the ATF4-knockout SH-SY5Y cells [90].

As mentioned before, ATF4 is linked with the transcription of CHOP. However, the induction of CHOP is not related to ATF4 in response to dopaminergic neuronal toxins [88]. In summary, the role of ATF4 may be associated with both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic functions. However, it is more likely to be neuroprotective in PD. However, other studies reveal the pro-apoptotic effect of ER stress. Bellucci and his team found induction of ATF4/CREB-2 in glucose-derived SH-SY5Y + cells via accumulation of α-syn [89].

In brief, the phosphorylation of eIF2α may be related to α-syn, whereas ATF4 might play a neuroprotective role during the regulation of parkin. According to Varma and Sen, the initial activation of UPR may be neuroprotective whereas prolonged effect might contribute to neurodegenerative disorder [91].

### IRE1

Recently, in vitro and in vivo studies unraveled the neuroprotective effect of the UPR transcription factor XBP1 in the survival of dopaminergic neurons. The ablation of XBP1 in pretreated dopaminergic neurons induced resistance to a PD-triggering neurotoxin 6-OHDA [92]. This effect was also observed in dopaminergic neurons of XBP1-deficient animals, inducing altered protein homeostasis [93]. Up-regulation of several UPR effectors also occurred in the SNpc of XBP1-deficient animals lacking pro-apoptotic markers. The neuroprotective effect can be explained by the ER-hormesis mechanism, which was established in the rodent and fly models of PD by Matus and his colleagues [94]. The ER-hormesis mechanism suggests that XBP1-deficiency selectively exhibited mild ER stress, which suggests a functional requirement for IRE1α-XBP1 signaling to maintain protein homeostasis in nigral dopaminergic neurons [95]. In addition, Valdes team induced chronic ER stress by knocking down XBP1 in adult mice, which triggered spontaneous neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons [92]. Ray and his groups recently found that XBP1 over-expression protected against α-synuclein-induced dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in *Caenorhabditis elegans*. The unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA requires not only IRE1α but also the RNA ligase RTCB-1 [96].

The active form XBP1 (XBP1s) is the unconventional splicing product of XBP1 mRNA following treatment with endoribonuclease IRE1α resulting in protection against cells induced by 6-OHDA, MPP+ and proteasome inhibitors. Valdes team transfected active XBP1s in adult mice using adeno-associated vectors to induce protection against6-OHDA and reduce striatal denervation [92]. To investigate whether MPP+ and proteasome inhibitor-induced cell death were repaired by the activation of IRE1α-XBP1 pathway, Sado and co-workers used human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y exposed to MPP+, MG132 and lactacystin. They found reduced cell death in cells transduced with Adv-XBP1s using MPP+-induced model and recombinant adenovirus (rAdV) expression system. MG132-induced cell death was suppressed completely by XBP1s expression. Similar to MG132-induced model, lactacystin-induced cell death was also significantly suppressed by XBP1s expression. Sado also investigated the effect against TG-induced cell death. The over-expression of XBP1s suggested strong tolerance to TG-induced cell death [97]. In addition, the effect of XBP1s was observed in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP1)-induced PD model. In this *in vivo* study, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the mouse model was significantly suppressed by adenoviral XBP1s. Increasing evidence indicates the critical role of XBP1 in protein homeostasis and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Increased survival of the graft and improved motor performance were found in XBP1-transfected neural stem cells in the brain in a rotenone-induced rat model of PD [98].

Generally, targeting the ire1α-XBP1 pathway plays a neuroprotective role in the development of PD and suggests a potential therapeutic role in PD.

### ATF6

Genetic manipulation of UPR in PD was reported only in a few studies. For example, ATF6α knockout increased accumulation of ubiquitin-positive inclusions and enhanced the loss of dopaminergic neurons with a PD-triggering neurotoxin. ATF6 controls the levels of the chaperone BiP and ERAD components under resting conditions in dopaminergic neurons [99].

Egawa et al. demonstrated the causal relationship between oxidative and ER stress in the pathogenesis of PD using ATF6α wild-type and knock-out mice treated with MPTP. The data indicated the following findings: First, ATF6α controls the levels of ER chaperones and ERAD components in dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Second, both MPTP [100] and MPP+ up-regulate the expression of ER chaperones and ERAD by activating ATF6α in dopaminergic neurons and SH-SY5Y cells. MPTP induces the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) in the dopaminergic neurons in vivo. Phosphorylated p38MAPK and activated ATF6α synergistically elevate the expression of BiP in dopaminergic neurons treated with MPP+. MPP+ induces the translocation of N-terminal fragment of ATF6α to the nucleus and binding of N-terminal ATF6α with phosphorylated p38MAPK.

It enhances the transcriptional activity of ATF6α. Third, MPTP initiates formation of additional clusters of ubiquitin-immunoreactive substances in the striatum of ATF6α KO mice than in WT mice. Finally, dopaminergic neurons under ATF6α KO conditions are more vulnerable to MPTP neurotoxicity. Overall, ATF6α plays an important role in protection against MPTP toxicity in the dopaminergic neurons via up-regulation of ER chaperones and ERAD. Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated that MPP+ associated oxidative stress enhanced the interaction between p38MAPK and ATF6α, causing increased transcriptional activity of ATF6α [101].

Gorbatyuk et al. determined that the overexpression of human wt α-syn in rat activated UPR by up-regulation of mediators via at least two pathways: ATF6 and PERK. Cleaved phosphorylated ATF6 (pATF6) was significantly increased in α-syn-injected substantia nigra pars compacta(SNc) compared with GFP injected animals [102]. Hashida et al.'s found that ATF6α may contribute to neuronal survival and regulation of protein aggregation in the early stages, but not in the late stages, of PD [103].

To conclude, ATF6 has been shown to have protective effect. The roles of three pathways in PD were listed in the Table 2.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, cortex and brain stem, leading to muscular atrophy and paralysis [104]. It is mainly characterized by accumulation of proteins, including mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). The levels of total PERK, ATF6, IRE1 and caspase-4 are increased in the spinal cord of sporadic ALS patients [105]. In addition, the increased levels of XBP-1s, ATF4, as well as ER chaperones and the apoptosis signal GRP58 were observed in human spinal cord samples of sporadic ALS patients, postmortem, by Western blot [106–109]. Sasaki found increased GRP 78-immunoreactivity in the motor neurons of sALS patients [110]. Up-regulation of ERP57 has been reported in sALS and fALS patients. The apoptotic CHOP was up-regulated in sALS. Strikingly, a detailed observation of ER in motor neurons was performed using electron microscopy, which provides evidence correlating the development of ALS with ER stress. Distended and fragmented ER cisternae were detected in the affected cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord [111]. Enlarged ER lumen contained amorphous or granular material [110].

Although the majority of the patients are sporadic (called sALS) without genetic mutation, approximately 5–10% of the patients are familial (designated as fALS).

Genes associated with fALS, include cytosolic SOD1, TAR DNA-binding protein (TARDBP or TDP-43), fused in sarcoma (FUS/TLS), and vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB).

PERK

Transgenic mice carrying a G93A mutation of human SOD1 were used to investigate the pathology of ALS. Major components including PERK and its downstream molecule were up-regulated in SOD1G93A mice [112]. However, significant differences exist in the phosphorylation of PERK. A broad ER stress occurred only in the end stage of the disease, which did not favor ER stress in ALS pathology [113]. The increase of p-PERK and p-eIF2α only occurred at the pre-symptomatic age of 12 weeks, but not at weeks 4 and 20. Therefore, ER stress response occurs in the mild-to-late pre-symptomatic stages, rather than the end-stage [114]. Chen also observed that the increased level of PERK was time-independent in white gastrocnemius of ALS transgenic mice [115].

PERK haplo-insufficient transgenic mice manifested UPR activation, and SOD1 accumulation earlier compared with the normal mice. However, it failed to reduce ATF4 production during the early onset of disease, and only partially decreased ATF4 levels during the late symptomatic stage. The study showed no alteration of target genes of ATF4, such as CHOP and BiP. Therefore, PERK

haploinsufficiency in ALS pathogenesis is related to the regulation of protein translation via eIF2α phosphorylation rather than ATF4 induction [116]. However, Matus’ team also found that ATF4 deficiency decreased the probability of generating mutant SOD1 transgenic mice, as well as delayed the disease onset and increased lifespan. ATF4 deficiency also altered the aggregation of mutant SOD1 and led to reduced pathological stress [117]. Despite the lack of UPR activation in the mutant TDP-43 animal model [118], Vaccaro and his colleagues found that salubrinal, guanabenz reduced the mutant TDP-43 levels in ALS. The wild-type TDP-43 protein is hyper-phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and aggregated in the cytoplasm and nuclei of affected cells in ALS. Toxicity in C.elegans and zebrafish was induced by different mechanisms related to the PERK pathway [119]. Reducing PEK, which is the homolog of mammalian PERK, decreased TDP-43 toxicity, whereas knockdown of GADD34 had the opposite effect [120].

As for eIF2α, [107] a number of studies confirmed the increased phosphorylation of eIF2α in ALS samples. Prell and his colleague observed the phosphorylation of eIF2α in motor neuronal-like cells expressing SODG93A [121]. Guanabenz is a regulatory subunit of the PP1/GADD34, and also acts as the selective inhibitor of the eIF2α dephosphorylation [122]. Using primary fibroblasts derived from SOD1 mutant mice, Vieira’s team discovered that viability against tunicamycin was greatly increased with guanabenz treatment [123]. When targeted on the TDP-43 levels
in ALS, Kim found similar results in *Drosophila*. TDP-43 toxicity was modulated via reduction of genes related to eIF2α phosphorylation.

ALS type 8 is caused by mutations in the gene encoding VAPB. The mutation involves a proline to serine substitution at position-56 (P56S-VAPB) [124]. Tokutake and his group found enhanced ATF4 and CHOP levels in the P56S-VAPB-expressing cells. The increased ATF4 and CHOP mediated dyslipidemia in the adipose tissue of ALS patients [125]. As mentioned previously, GADD34 is the downstream target of ATF4 and facilitates the dephosphorylation of eIF2α. G85R/GADD34<sup>+/ΔC</sup> transgenic mice contain an inactive allele, which decreased the normal function of GADD34. Wang found that the G85R/GADD34<sup>+/ΔC</sup> transgenic mice showed a reduced accumulation of mSOD1 and prolonged life span, as well as enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2α [126]. Kikuchi also observed the up-regulation of ATF4 in the spinal cord of the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice [113].

To conclude, PERK signaling may have opposite functions in ALS pathology. The ATF4 production may lead to neuronal loss whereas eIF2α phosphorylation was neuroprotective [127]. However, as stated earlier, the effect on the PERK pathway is inconclusive.

### IRE1

Hetz et al. [108] investigated the deficiency of XBP1 on ALS pathogenesis using mutant SOD1 transgenic mice by specifically deleting XBP-1 in the nervous system. It ameliorated the disease and decreased the toxicity by activation of autophagy. Studies with human SOD1<sup>wt</sup> or mutant SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> as EGFP fusion proteins assessed the aggregation of intracellular SOD1 inclusion by Western blot or fluorescent microscopy [128]. An unexpected reduction in the number of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> intracellular inclusions occurred in the XBP-1 and IRE1α knockdown NSC34 cells. A clear increase occurred in the number of XBP-1 knockdown NSC34 cells containing autophagosomes and the presence of LC3-positive vacuoles (LC3 is the key autophagy-related gene) indicated that autophagy was rigorously activated in cells with impaired IRE1α.

Mutant TDP-43 transgenic rats showed overexpression of mutant TDP-43 in neurons and failed to activate the three transducer proteins of UPR resulting in UPR suppression [118]. In the brain of TRE-TDP-43<sup>M337V/</sup>Camk2α-tTA transgenic rats none of the ER chaperone proteins was up-regulated [129]. Further, spliced and unspliced XBP1 (XBP1s and XBP1u) were increased in the rat forebrain and were gradually depleted in the neurons of transgenic mutant TDP-43 [130]. Active XBP1 was delivered to the spinal cord by gene therapy and was associated with enhanced oligodendrocyte survival,

which had a significant effect on motoneuron recovery after spinal cord injury [131]. XBP-1 deficiency enhanced autophagy and delayed the ALS onset in mutant SOD1 mice, whereas in the mutant TDP-43 mice no autophagy marker LC3 was found [132]. However, the results were different in vivo. Hetz observed an intense increase in neurons with LC3-labeled autophagosomes in SOD<sup>G86R</sup>/XBP-1<sup>NES−/−</sup> mice. Consistently, the lysosomal content was markedly increased in motoneurons of SOD<sup>G86R</sup>/XBP-1<sup>NES−/−</sup> mice during the LAMP-2 staining [108].

Studies suggested that the key to reducing motor neuron deficits includes protection from ER-stress [119]. Alexandra and his groups identified methylene blue as a suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity using a TDP-43 mutant in vivo animal model generated by the *ire-1(zcl4)* mutants [133, 134]. Growing evidence suggests that methylene blue protects against mutant TDP-43 neurons via the IRE1 pathway [135–137]. Studies found the salubrinal guanabenz, phenazine and methylene blue act against mutant SOD1 [138]. In brief, these compounds mediate different UPR signaling pathway and manifest neuroprotective effect against mTDP-43 toxicity.

The IRE1-XBP1 pathway is adversely affected in cells expressing P56S-VAPB and reduces myotube formation in ALS [139, 140]. Tokutake and his team studied the factors underlying disruption of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway in cells expressing P56S-VAPB [141]. The experimental use of C2C12 cells transfected with wild-type VAPB and P56S-VAPB also revealed reduced myotube formation and the activity of IRE1-XBP1 pathway occurred via ERAl system. In addition, the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mutant ALS model has been shown to accelerate XBP1 or XBP1s expression after thapsigargin treatment [142]. However, the increase was larger in the wild-type cells than in the P56S-VAPBC1C12 cells after exposure to thapsigargin [121] These findings indicate that the IRE1-XBP1 expression was altered in the P56S-VAPBC2C12 cells.

The ASK1-P38 pathway is activated in motor neurons of the spinal cord of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mutant ALS model [143, 144]. Nishitoh and his team investigated whether SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> induced interaction between ASK1 and TRAF2 and found that ASK1 interacted with TRAF2 in NSC34 cells infected with Ad-SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>. ASK1 interacted with IRE1 only in ASK1-TRAF2-IRE1 complex by co-immunoprecipitation suggesting that SOD1 triggered the formation of ASK1-TRAF2-IRE1 and ER-stress via IRE1 pathway. ASK1 is a potential therapeutic target in ALS. Using wild type and ASK1<sup>-/-</sup>SOD1 mutant mice, researchers found that ASK deficiency had no effect on the expression of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>, but increased resistance to SOD1 toxicity than the wild-type neurons. The results suggest that the ASK1 signaling pathway mediated cell death in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> induced ER stress and ASK1deficiency alleviated motor neuronal death. It prolonged the lifespan of ALS model mice [145].

Generally, XBP-1 deficiency enhanced autophagy and delayed the ALS onset in mutant SOD1 mice but not in mutant TDP-43 mice. Recent studies suggested that salubrinal, guanabenz, phenazine and methylene blue protected mutant TDP-43 neurons via the IRE1 pathway. The impaired myotube formation was attributed to the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. Finally, SOD1 triggered ASK1-TRAF2-IRE1 formation and the ER-stress via IRE1 pathway. In turn, the ASK1 deficiency alleviated motor neuronal death and prolonged the lifespan of ALS model mice. ASK1 is a potential target in ALS treatment.

### ATF6

Studies have shown that protein levels of ATF6 are increased in the spinal cord of sporadic ALS [107]. Overexpression of VAPB attenuated the activity of ATF6-regulated transcription. The disease-associated mutant, VAPBP56S, exhibited enhanced inhibition against ATF6-dependent transcription compared with the wild-type protein. The interaction between VAP proteins and ATF6 may represent a previously uncharacterized mechanism of ER homeostatic and stress response. However, no interaction was detected between VAPA, VAPB or ATF6 co-expressed with heterologous leucine zipper-Venus fusions [146].

As VAPB has very little luminal structure, it is unlikely to directly inhibit the ability of ATF6 to detect ER stress. Over-expression of VAPB disrupts membrane trafficking and may indirectly inhibit the activation of ATF6 by reducing the translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi [147]. Alternatively, VAP proteins directly inhibit the translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi or via a mechanism similar to that of nucleobindin1, which represses S1P activation of ATF6 [148].

To determine if the interaction with VAPB affects the ability of ATF6 to activate transcription, luciferase-based transient transcription assays were conducted using the ATF6/XBP1-dependent reporter of transcription [149]. In HEK293 cells, basal levels of transcription from this promoter were reduced by over-expression of myc-tagged forms of VAPB or VAPBP56S. ATF6/XBP1-mediated transcription activated by the glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, was also significantly reduced by over-expression of VAPB or VAP-BP56S [27] Increasing levels of ATF6 by co-expression of a FLAG-tagged recombinant form of human ATF6 increased basal and tunicamycin-induced expression of the ATF6/XBP1 reporter [150].

The roles of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were listed in Table 3.

### Huntington's disease (HD)

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor abnormalities, and onset of psychiatric symptoms and dementia in early-to mid-adult life. A glutamine expansion of 40 repeats or more within the Huntingtin protein (Htt) generates a dominant toxic function, leading to progressive accumulation of misfolded mutant Htt (mHtt) in the form of intracellular oligomers and inclusions, resulting in neuronal loss [151–153]. Although several cerebral regions exhibit neurodegeneration in HD, the most striking characteristics of this disorder includes atrophy of the striatum observed in post-mortem histological investigation [154] or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [155, 156]. Detection of atrophy of the caudate and putamen in the pre-symptomatic patients (i.e., carrying the mutation but asymptomatic) demonstrated significant degeneration (cell shrinkage or loss) years before manifestation of clinical symptoms [152, 153]. The disease mainly affects the GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons of the striatum that project into SN reticulata and pallidum. Interestingly, large cholinergic inter-neurons and medium-sized spiny interneurons are preserved in the HD striatum [157–159]. Cortical atrophy and early degeneration of the hypothalamus are also important aspects of HD pathogenesis, and late-stage HD patients show widespread brain degeneration. However, the severity of striatal alterations is correlated with the degree of motor, cognitive and psychiatric perturbations, suggesting that striatal degeneration is an important aspect of HD pathology. Although the relationship between Htt expression and neuronal function is inconclusive, cellular and animal models of HD suggest a direct correlation between HD and ER stress.

### PERK

PERK/eIF2α phosphorylation is involved in polyQ72-induced LC3 conversion, which is important in autophagy. The PERK pathway is required for autophagy in the expression of Huntington’s disease-associated expanded polyglutamine repeats. PERK pathway in HD patients is poorly studied. However, PERK/eIF2α phosphorylation mediated polyQ aggregation, which suggested that eIF2α phosphorylation induced autophagy and acted as a cellular defense that inhibited ER-stress-mediated cell death [160]. Leitman found high levels of htt in cultured striatal cells with huntingtin induced ER stress and activated PERK. Meanwhile, they also observed that PERK inhibition decreased the apoptosis in Htt1Q-expressing cells, which suggested that inhibition of PERK reduced huntingtin toxicity [161]. The eIF2α phosphorylation inhibition may be associated with

cognition, suggesting that huntingtin pathology may be one of the factors underlying early cognitive impairment [162]. However, ATF4 deficiency did not alter the mHtt levels in the transgenic mice. Studies failed to observe the alteration of ATF4, BiP or CHOP expression in the striatum of HD patients [163]. Knock-down ATF4 did not affect autophagy or polyQ<sub>79</sub>-EGFP aggregation in neuron [160].

In brief, the inhibition of PERK offers new therapeutic targets. The eIF2α phosphorylation may induce autophagy. However, evidence does not suggest the role of ATF4 in HD development. Salubrinal reduces protein aggregation and concomitantly increases the viability of cell that expresses N-terminal huntingtin proteins with expanded polyQ in PC6.3 cells [164].

IRE1 pathway

To determine the role of XBP1 deficiency in HD in vivo, Graham and his colleagues generated the HD transgenic model, where XBP1 was silenced in the nervous system on a C57BL/6 genetic background with Nestin-Cre

system. The strain was recombined with YAC128HD mouse model on a heterozygous background (XBP1<sup>Nes-/−</sup>mHtt<sup>Q128</sup>). They found that XBP1 deficiency resulted in a significant improvement in the motor performance in transgenic mice [165]. Subsequently, they used an antibody on Western blot and found that the mHtt levels were specifically reduced in the striatum of XBP1<sup>Nes-/−</sup>HD transgenic mice [166]. In XBP1 knockdown cells and animal models of HD, macrophagy and proteasome were shown to mediate mHtt degradation [163]. Depletion of XBP1 induced autophagy and progressively enhanced the degradation of mHtt and pathologic polyQ peptide [167]. Western blot shown that the expression of ATF4, CHOP, BiP, ERP72, and PDI remained unaltered in the striatum of mHtt mice, which was consistent with previous studies suggesting that HD was not associated with classical ER stress response, but via the ER stress-independent neuroprotective effect of XBP1 caused by autophagy [168]. In post-mortem analysis of striatum HD patient samples, the expression of XBP1s was inversely correlated with

Apoptosis

LC3-II levels as well as t unaltered general ER stress response in ATF4, CHOP, or BiP [169]. Experiments involving huntingtin-transfected cells revealed increased mHtt aggregation via IRE1 activation and the IRE1-TRAF2 pathway impaired the autophagy in enhanced cellular accumulation of mHtt. Huikong Lee also found that p62 (autophagy marker) was significantly increased via IRE1-TRAF2-JNK pathway. Atg5 deficiency in M5-7 cells blocked mHtt aggregation induced by the IRE1 pathway but increased the mHtt aggregation per se. HD animal models and patients showed up-regulated ER stress marker p-IRE1 and autophagy marker p62. In a HD fly model, the down-regulation of IRE1 rescued the rough-eye phenotype by mHtt. Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (Usp14) interacted with IRE1 and inhibited the phosphorylation of IRE1α in mutated Htt transgenic mice (BACHD mice) and mHtt cells resulting in neuroprotection and inhibition of caspase-3 activation [170].

Overall, IRE1 plays an essential role in neuronal toxicity due to mHtt aggregation in HD and mediates mHtt pathogenesis [171]. But there is no corresponding treatment towards this pathway at present.

ATF6 pathway

Naranjo's group found that downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) levels were reduced in mouse HD models shortly after birth and before locomotors dysfunction. Reduction in DREAM protein levels is a neuroprotective response in murine models in vivo and HD models in vitro [172].

Chronic administration of repaglinide, a small molecule that binds DREAM in vitro, delayed disease onset, ameliorated locomotor symptoms, and prolonged lifespan [172]. This interaction was potentiated by Ca²⁺ and was reduced in the presence of repaglinide. Furthermore, pull-down assays also showed that the N-terminal of DREAM and the N-terminal region of ATF6 interact in a repaglinide-dependent manner [149]. These results suggest that the DREAM-ATF6 interaction was involved in repaglinide-mediated neuroprotection. STHdhQ7/7 cell exposure to repaglinide had no effect on basal conditions, but significantly increased thapsigargin-induced expression of ATF6 target genes. Thapsigargin-induced ER stress in STHdhQ7/7 cells increased mRNA levels of the ATF6 downstream targets XBP1, BiP, CHOP, and calreticulin [38, 39, 173, 174].

To conclude, depression of ATF6 transcription mediates DREAM-related neuroprotection in HD. The studies mentioned before demonstrated that there is a mechanistic link between ER stress conditions and a role for DREAM in HD.

The different roles of three pathways in Huntington's disease were shown in the Table 4.

Psychiatric diseases

PERK pathway

Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is one of the major risk factors for psychiatric diseases, including major depression, bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, and mood disorders [175]. Several groups found an interaction between DISC1 and ATF4 in experimental models [175, 176]. ATF4 is located on chromosome 22q13, which is a hotspot related to several genes in schizophrenia [177]. ATF4 gene polymorphisms are associated with schizophrenia in male patients [178]. Therefore, we assume that ATF4 is correlated with schizophrenia. Trinh and his group found that PERK and ATF4 were greatly reduced in schizophrenia samples compared with controls [177].

Timberlake and Dwivedi reported no alteration in the expression of ATF4 in the learned helpless (LH) model of depression. However, they discovered a tendency toward up-regulation in further analysis [179].

Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disease characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression that affects about 1% of the population and increases the risk of suicide. Pfaffenseller and his colleague discovered that UPR-related proteins, such as GRP78 and eIF2α, remained unchanged in the lymphocytes of patients with bipolar disorder. Compared with the significant increase in the controls, they speculated a dysfunction in the PERK pathway of BD patients [180]. Trinh also found similar results in the frontal cortex of BD patients [175]. However, Kakiuchi failed to find any genetic association between ATF4 and the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder in a case-control study involving Japanese population [181].

Chen and his team found that ethanol increased the levels of p-PERK, p-eIF2α, and ATF4 following exposure to tunicamycin and thapsigargin in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and primary cerebellar neurons. Ethanol also increased neuronal death [182].

Hakim and his group discovered that sleep fragmentation (SF) increased the level of p-eIF2α/total eIF2α [183].

Our group discovered that the expression of p-PERK and p-eIF2α was increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of single prolonged stress (SPS, a rat model of PTSD) rats. We also observed decreased apoptosis in mPFC and an increased ability for learning and memory after GSK2606414 treatment in the Morris water maze test (MWM) and the Novel Object Recognition test (NOR). We concluded that the PERK/eIF2α pathway, in particular p-PERK and p-eIF2α, is involved in SPS-induced high

IRE1 pathway

A valid animal model of major depressive disorders (MDD) comprises rats exposed to inescapable shock (LH rats), rats not exposed to shock but tested for escape latency (TC rats) and the non-learned helpless rats (NLH rats). Matthew and his group examined the plasma corticosterone level and expression of transcriptional factors as well as GRP78, GRP94, ATF6 and XBP1 in the hippocampus of the three rat groups. The result suggested that when compared with TC or NLH groups the expression of XBP-1 was strikingly elevated in the brain of LH groups. The increased expression of XBP-1 in the

LH was associated with MDD such as apoptosis and inflammatory response [179]. Toda and his groups suggested that pharmacologically-induced serotonin release and environmental stress triggered elevated XBP1 activity in a rodent model, which was generated by inducing the XBP-1 splicing in the rat brain. In turn, the finding indicated the association between stress-induced MDD and intracellular XBP1 biochemical pathway [184]. Subsequently, Grunebaum and his team evaluated the association between the XBP1 genotype, plasma cortisol and clinical depression by testing the 132 adults who expressed -116C polymorphism with higher baseline cortisol and after treatment for 1 year for an index major depressive episode (MDE). The association indicated that the presence of XBP1C allele (CC or CG genotype) was related to MDE criteria during the follow-up comparison with the controls, suggesting that the higher-expressing C

allele may be associated with worse outcomes during the 1-year follow-up after MDE. In addition, the antidepressant treatment and demographic factors were excluded consistent with the previous hypothesis showing that the cortisol level was linked to XBP1 or the impaired UPR function [185]. Nevelland his colleague analyzed the expression of the indicators of UPR using real-time PCR of leukocyte-derived RNA samples in 86 MDD patients and found that MDD was associated with 1.60-fold increase in XBP1 indicating persistent activation of ER stress response in peripheral tissues of MDD patients [186].

DNA analysis of -116C/G genotypes in the lymphoblastoid cells by Kakiuchi revealed that the polymorphism (-116C→G) in the XBP1 promoter, affected the putative binding site of XBP1, and was associated with lower gene transcription, especially in Japanese populations with bipolar disorder. The presence of G allele increases the risk for bipolar disorder while the -116C/C genotype is a protective factor [187]. However, Cichon's team and Hou's groups found that this result was not consistent with European and Chinese studies [188, 189]. So and his team found the lymphoid cells derived from patients with bipolar disorder showed decreased transcription of XBP1 and CHOP after in vitro cellular stress by qRT-PCR and a TaqMan-based assay [190]. Two years later, Hayashi and his group confirmed the results in lymphoblastoid cell lines and reported that the splicing of XBP1 was reduced in bipolar disorder patients [191].

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder exhibit similar pathogenesis and clinical features. Kakiuchi team also found that the polymorphism (-116C→G) in the XBP1 promoter was associated with schizophrenia in the Japanese population [192].

In addition to Japanese population, heng and his partners found that the polymorphism -116C/G in XBP1 was linked to the risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [193].

Olney and his colleagues generated a trimester equivalent mouse model of ethanol abuse and showed that the up-regulation of XBP1 induced UPR in the brain of mouse [194]. Goral and Meyer found that the expression of CHOP and XBP1 was triggered in BV2 microglia exposed to ethanol and attenuated the inflammation induced by LPS [195].

In the time-course SF experiments, Hakim team found that the ER stress-induced splicing of XBP1 messenger RNA was increased and indicated that sleep fragmentation activated UPR and induced ER stress in the hypothalamus of the C57BL/6J mice [183].

We detected the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rat models of single prolonged stress (SPS) induced post-traumatic stress disorder. Our results show that IRE1α, XBP1u, and total XBP1 were significantly increased on day 1 after SPS and then decreased gradually [196]. Overall, the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway was activated by the posttraumatic stress disorder and may be involved in its pathogenesis.

ATF6 pathway

Trimberlake and his group examined the expression of genes mediating the three different pathways in UPR activation, namely GRP78, GRP94, ATF6 and CHOP using an animal model system that distinguishes vulnerability (learned helpless, LH) from resistance (non-learned helpless, NLH) resulting in depression. Expression of GRP78, GRP94, and ATF6 was significantly up-regulated in LH rat hippocampi compared with TC or NLH rats [179].

The roles of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 pathway in mental disease including schizophrenia, depression and PTSD were shown in Table 5.

ER stress and mitochondria in neurodegenerative disease

The ER and mitochondria form a highly dynamic interconnected network, which plays an important role in the development of neurodegenerative disease. Mitochondria and ER form structural and functional networks (mitochondria-associated ER membranes, MAMs), which are essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis and determining cell fate. Some scientists found the up-regulation in MAM function and ER/mitochondrial communication in cells, mouse models and human AD brain [197]. Area-Gomez and his group also found that PS1 and PS2 were highly rich in MAM [198]. MAM also associated with the production of Aβ [199].

Recent studies demonstrated significant changes in the expression of almost all mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins including DLP1, OPA1, Mfn1/2, and Fis1 in the brain from AD patients [200, 201]. DLP1 interacts with Aβ monomer and oligomers and phosphorylated tau in AD brain tissues [201]. Besides, Muñoz and his colleague discovered that PERK silencing enhanced the apoptosis of Mfn2-deficient cells [202].

Dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to calcium dys-homeostasis through impaired buffering capacity or direct impact on the endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels. ER stress causes sustained Ca²⁺ accumulation into mitochondrial alteration, which triggers the apoptosis of mitochondria [203]. Calcium mishandling was reported in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD [204]. In conclusion, the damage of ER/mitochondria association may take part in the development of neurodegenerative disease and also act as therapeutic targets in the treatment of the disease. Recent studies demonstrated that mitotempo is a

# Therapeutic strategy in UPR targeting in the neurodegenerative disease

There are several strategies that could be applied in UPR targeting in the future to treat neurodegenerative disease according to the recent researches mentioned above. The studies of small molecules that target the UPR are growing. However, it is difficult but important to distinguish positive or negative effects after small molecules treatment. Moreover, interfere treatment may be strongly affected by the pathological state. The other question is that adaptive UPR mat have turned maladaptive from translating mechanistic observation in the physiology to an allocation in pathology.

In the case of AD, using specific, small-molecule PERK branch inhibitors to block PERK-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation seems to be a potential treatment strategy for AD individuals. This strategy may lead to the regain of global translation rates and reduction of expression of ATF4 and BACE1. In this way, the therapeutic strategy can affect the accelerated β-amyloidogenesis through reduction in APP cleaving via the BACE1-dependent amyloidogenic pathway [206]. XBP1 has been a candidate for gene therapy to attenuate ER stress level in AD individuals. In the case of AD, intracerebral delivery adeno-associated virus (AAVs) using brain stereotaxis is the current choice [207]. The results confirm that in ATF6 knockdown cellular autophagy was induced after ER stress similar to the wild-type cells [208]. Abnormal autophagy predisposed cells to ER stress, suggesting that autophagy protects against cell death induced by ER stress. Therefore, Li's team suggests that autophagy was a therapeutic target in AD [68].

In the case of PD, Sal reduced the accumulation of α-syn, attenuated disease manifestation, extended the lifespan of α-syn transgenic mouse models, but did not protect dopaminergic neurons against degeneration [86]. Other studies also found that salubrinal can play an important role in the cytoprotection of SH-SY5Y cells relating to the ATF4-parkin pathway [209]. Recent studies demonstrated that XBP1 deficiency in adult animals resulted in chronic ER stress caused up-regulation of CHOP and led to the spontaneous neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons [86]. Apigenin, luteolin treatment can improve the locomotors and muscular activities in MPTP treated mice by up-regulation of ATF6 expression [210]. Baicalein has been shown to exert a protective effect on neurons in 6-OHDA-induced experimental parkinsonism in vitro and in vivo [211].

Table 6 Role of three ER-dependent pathways in Neurodegenerative disease

| Disease | Pathway | Role | Positive or negative |
|---------|---------|------|---------------------|
| AD      | PERK    | Neuroprotection | + |
|         | IRE1    | XBP1: neuroprotection; ASK1: apoptosis | – |
|         | ATF6   | Unclear | Unclear |
| PD      | PERK    | Neuroprotection | + |
|         | IRE1    | XBP1: neuroprotection | + |
|         | ATF6   | Neuronal survival (early stage) | + |
| ALS     | PERK    | Elf2: neuroprotection/ATF4: apoptosis | +/- |
|         | IRE1    | Neuroprotection | – |
|         | ATF6   | Unclear | Unclear |
| HD      | PERK    | Neuroprotection | + |
|         | IRE1    | IRE1: neuronal toxicity; XBP1: neuroprotection | – |
|         | ATF6   | Neuroprotection | + |

The modulation of ER stress pathway represents a potential therapeutic target in ALS. Phenazines acted via IRE1 and PERK pathways and played a potential therapeutic role against mTDP-43 toxicity [212]. In the context of ALS genetic therapy which targeted on ER proteostasis, Acosta-Alvear found SIL1 was treated as a direct target of XBP1s in the secretory cells and myotubes [20]. Filezac de L'Etang team observed SIL1 underlay part of the differential motoneuron vulnerability in ALS individuals [213]. AAV-XBP1 delivery of SIL1 to familial ALS motoneurons has been a therapeutic strategy to restore ER homeostasis [207].

In regard to HD, Salubrinal reduces protein aggregation and concomitantly increases the viability of cell that expresses N-terminal huntingtin proteins with expanded polyQ in PC6.3 cells [164]. Further, repaglinide competed with DREAM-ATF6 interaction and increased nuclear accumulation of the amino terminal ATF6 (Nt-ATF6) and ATF6-dependent transcription in striatal neurons in vivo [27]. The pharmacological inhibition of DREAM activity induces UPR function, which opens a new avenue for therapeutic intervention in HD patients, such as using the repaglinide [172].

Taken together, all these studies suggest that strategies to attenuate ER stress levels and regain the ER proteostasis may have beneficial consequences on neurodegenerative diseases. Fully understanding of the pathological state is necessary and important to make a further study in UPR targeting for the treatment of neurodegeneration. In addition, more research is needed to define the optimal targets to alleviate ER stress in the each neurodegenerative disease. Predicting and defining the possible side effects of UPR targeting remains an important subject for future drug target.

Conclusion

In vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence supports the role of three ER-dependent pathways in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease according to evidence derived from cell lines, animal models and patients (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The studies indicate that the three pathways play different roles in UPR regulation ranging from protective response to apoptosis. PERK plays a greater role in cell survival than in apoptosis under ER stress. The IRE1 pathway regulates ER-induced apoptosis compared with neuroprotection in most neurodegenerative diseases except Parkinson disease (Table 6). However, the precise mechanism has yet to be delineated. The three pathways provide new strategies for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disease and Psychiatric diseases.
