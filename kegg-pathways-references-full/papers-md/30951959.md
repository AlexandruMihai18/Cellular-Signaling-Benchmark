ABSTRACT

Breast cancer incidence is increasing globally and exposure to endocrine disruptors has gained importance as a potential risk factor. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was once used as a fungicide and, despite being banned, considerable amounts are still released into the environment. HCB acts as an endocrine disruptor in thyroid, uterus and mammary gland and was classified as possibly carcinogenic to human. This review provides a thorough analysis of results obtained in the last 15 years of research and evaluates data from assays in mammary gland and breast cancer in diverse animal models. We discuss the effects of environmentally relevant HCB concentrations on the normal mammary gland and different stages of carcinogenesis, and attempt to elucidate its mechanisms of action at molecular level. HCB weakly binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), activating both membrane (c-Src) and nuclear pathways. Through c-Src stimulation, AhR signaling interacts with other membrane receptors including estrogen receptor-α, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor beta 1 receptors. In this way, several pathways involved in mammary morphogenesis and breast cancer development are modified, inducing tumor progression. HCB thus stimulates epithelial cell proliferation, preneoplastic lesions and alterations in mammary gland development as well as neoplastic cell migration and invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis in breast cancer. In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that the presence and bioaccumulation of HCB in high-fat tissues and during highly sensitive time windows such as pregnancy, childhood and adolescence make exposure a risk factor for breast tumor development.

1. Introduction

The incidence of breast cancer is increasing globally ([Torre et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvres.2019.03.054)) and exposure to endocrine disruptors (EDs) has become a potential risk factor for this disease ([IBCERCC, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvres.2019.03.054)). EDs are chemical compounds which interfere with the overall action of hormones playing key roles in the maintenance of body homeostasis and the regulation of developmental and reproductive processes. EDs are able to generate

Birgelen, 1998). This receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor localized in a cytosolic complex with c-Src kinase. After activation, AhR binds to consensus sequences called dioxin-response elements in the promoters of its target genes and regulates the expression of detoxification genes. However, the physiological relevance of AhR has been demonstrated beyond its function in the metabolism of xenobiotics, including organ development, metabolism, adaptation to hypoxia, control of the circadian cycle and neurogenesis. In addition, experimental evidence links AhR with alterations in several cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, tumor promotion, reproduction, and immune response (Barouki et al., 2007). This receptor is activated mainly by xenobiotics of hydrophobic nature, including the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and HCB. TCDD is regarded as the most toxic dioxin and the one with the highest affinity for AhR, whereas HCB has an affinity 10,000 times lower (Hahn et al., 1989). The activation of AhR triggers different possible mechanisms of action: a genomic or nuclear mechanism and several non-genomic ones. In the first mechanism, the ligand-AhR complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the AhR nuclear translocator protein and acts as a transcription factor. In the second group, AhR activation triggers c-Src kinase translocation to the cell membrane, where it can interact with growth factor receptors, stimulating its own phosphorylation and the corresponding signaling pathways (Park et al., 2007). As a third option, Ohtake et al. (2007) have reported AhR to possess ligand-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which allows it to mark interacting proteins such as ERα for its degradation via the proteasome.

2. Environmentally relevant HCB concentrations

The primary reason to use HCB doses representative of the concentrations found in human samples lies in the necessity to obtain information that can be used by risk assessment agencies to protect the population. Therefore, an extensive analysis of the available literature was carried out to determine if the concentrations used in the different works are environmentally relevant. For these reasons, doses of 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 μM were used for in vitro assays. In a rural population highly exposed to airborne HCB in Spain, To-Figueras et al. (1997) reported levels of HCB in human serum (32 ng/ml, which is equivalent to 1.1 μM) within the range of the highest dose used (5 μM). In relation to the dose of 0.05 μM, Guo et al. (2014) observed that serum HCB levels of mothers at the time of giving birth in China were 70.62 ng/g of lipid (approximately 0.07 μM). Also, HCB levels in umbilical cord serum proved to be 65.16 ng/g of lipid (approximately 0.06 μM). In France, 28 ng/g of lipid (approximately 0.03 μM) were found in serum samples from women (Saoudi et al., 2014). In addition, the maximum residual limit allowed in fruits and vegetables is 0.01 μM, according to the European Commission directive. Finally, another study conducted in China reported 420 pg/ml HCB levels in pregnant women serum, which is equivalent to 0.0015 μM (Cao et al., 2011) and comparable to the 0.005 μM HCB dose used. Similarly, Becker et al. (2002) found that HCB serum levels were 440 ng/l in an adult population in Germany, which is equivalent to 0.002 μM HCB. This lowest dose was also used in other models which reported that 0.005 μM HCB increased sensitivity to androgens in prostate cancer cells (Ralph et al., 2003).

For the in vivo assays, 0.3, 3 and 30 mg HCB/kg body weight (b.w.) dissolved in corn oil were used in mouse models. About 80% of the HCB dose administered is absorbed when given as an oil solution, while only 6% is absorbed when administered in an aqueous suspension (Koss and Koransky, 1975). Although HCB absorption has not been determined in mice, it may be thought to resemble the values found in human populations. For instance, when HCB (500 mg/kg b.w. in water solution) was administered to rats by gavage, serum HCB concentration was 600 ng/ml (Chiappini et al., 2009). Assuming that HCB distribution is similar in rats and mice, we hypothesize that the administration of 3 mg/kg b.w. in mice may render serum concentrations of at least

N.V. Miret, et al.

Fig. 2. HCB action on mammary gland. HCB binds to AhR, induces epithelial cell proliferation generating ductal hyperplasia and increasing the number of TEBs and branching points. These results could be explained by the activation of the AhR membrane pathway, mediated by c-Src, which stimulates ERα, IGF-1R, IR and HER1 in epithelial cells and triggers their signaling pathways. The activation of ERα in epithelial cells may lead to the activation of the HER1 pathway in fibroblasts and, eventually, stimulate epithelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, HCB promotes TGF-β1 signaling, which subsequently enhances epithelial cell migration. On the other hand, HCB reduces the levels of TβRII but increases α-SMA in fibroblasts, rendering a CAF-like phenotype. Consequently, these fibroblasts release soluble factors which act on epithelial cells, inducing migration and mammary gland alterations.

45 ng/ml. In this respect, To-Figueras et al. (1997) have found 32 ng/ml of HCB in human serum. In addition, Ralph et al. (2003) have reported that HCB (5 mg/kg/day) produced androgenic effects in mice. On the other hand, HCB water solution given at a concentration of 100 mg/kg b.w. has been used in rat models, with results showing serum HCB concentrations around 120 ng/ml. These findings suggest that HCB doses used are higher than the concentrations reported in the general population and encourage further assays at lower doses. However, the results obtained were similar to those found in mice models.

3. HCB action on the mammary gland

The key stages of mammary gland development are embryonic, pubertal and adult in both rodents and humans. The embryonic phase is hormone-independent and is regulated by epithelial/mesenchymal interactions. However, ovarian and pituitary hormones, as well as growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) are essential in the pubertal and adult stages. Given that the mammary gland suffers a large number of functional and morphological changes from gestation and throughout life, perturbation during these critical stages can trigger alterations in normal mammary development and may have implication in cancer (Paulose et al., 2015). In this context, and on the basis of evidence of ED exposure as a risk factor for breast cancer resulting from its high hormonal influence, this section will discuss the effects of HCB on the mammary gland when exposure takes place in the pubertal and adult stages. The discussion will specifically focus on the process of branching morphogenesis, the development of preneoplastic lesions and the signaling pathways altered in the different cell types which populate the mammary gland.

3.1. Mammary gland development

In rodents, mammary glands become functional in adult life, although their development begins after mid-gestation when five pairs of placodes invaginate to form a bulb-shape bud which penetrates the underlying mesenchyme and form a rudimental ductal system. After birth, mammary development remains in a resting phase until puberty, when terminal end buds (TEBs) form at the tips of the ducts and penetrate into the fat pad. In this process, called branching morphogenesis, the ducts are subjected to successive rounds of elongation, bifurcation and lateral branching, finally providing an extensive system of branched ducts which fills the fat pad. In response to cycling ovarian hormones, TEBs differentiate, new ramifications take place, and lobulo-alveolar structures develop in the ends of the ducts. These structures will finish their differentiation and they will be able to secrete milk only under the influence of pregnancy hormones (Sternlicht, 2006). Mammary development is slightly different in humans; the pubertal breast contains a similarly extensive mammary tree, but terminal ducts give rise to terminal ductal-lobular structures comprising numerous acini. Despite these differences, rodent and human mammary glands exhibit a parallelism in terms of structure and development, and extensive research uses the mouse and rat mammary gland as a model system to explore developmental mechanisms (Macias and Hinck, 2012).

Treatment with HCB (100 mg/kg b.w.) delivered by gavage during 45 days to adult female Sprague Dawley rats increases serum estrogen levels but reduces progesterone content (Peña et al., 2012). As a consequence, an estrogenic microenvironment is generated in breast tissue which impacts the biological behavior of the mammary gland, increasing the number of ducts (Randi et al., 2006) and TEBs (Peña et al., 2012). Estrogen and IGF-1 act together and even synergize in the regulation and coordination of branching morphogenesis. Growth hormone (GH) also stimulates proliferation and duct elongation and activates TEBs through the IGF-1 signaling pathway (Sternlicht, 2006). In this respect, HCB enhances IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression and activates its downstream effector, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), in the rat mammary gland (Randi et al., 2006). In addition, HCB increases c-Src phosphorylation, induces c-Src/ERα and c-Src/EGF receptor (HER1) interaction, and consequently activates ERα and HER1. Next, these receptors trigger the phosphorylation and activation of their downstream effectors: extracellular signal related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1-2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (Stat5b) (Peña et al., 2012). Furthermore, HER1 signaling is known to induce mammary branching (Gjorevski and Nelson, 2011), which could explain the increase in the number of breast ducts observed in HCB-exposed rats (Randi et al., 2006) (Fig. 2).

Similar results have been found in a murine model in which HCB exposure takes place in the pubertal stage. In this case, female wild-type

(AhR +/+) and AhR-null (AhR −/−) C57BL/6N mice were treated with HCB (3 mg/kg b.w.) by intraperitoneal injection for 21 days, and mammary glands were evaluated by whole mounts. This technique shows the ductal branching and is thus used to identify morphological changes in epithelial development. Results revealed alterations in mammary branching morphogenesis induced by HCB through AhR. These findings suggest that HCB mechanism of action involves the activation of ERα in epithelial cells, which in turn stimulate the HER1 signaling pathway in fibroblasts, thus increasing epithelial cell proliferation, ductal branching and the number of TEBs (Miret et al., 2017) (Fig. 2). TEBs are undifferentiated and highly proliferative structures, which makes them sensitive to the effects of carcinogens and other chemicals (Macon and Fenton, 2013). As a result, the increase in the number of TEBs observed in HCB-treated rodents may be thought to heighten cancer risk. In addition, the fact that TEBs remain large in number hints at a delay in their differentiation process, which could be interpreted as a slowdown in branching morphogenesis. The implication of AhR in mammary gland development was reported by other authors; AhR activation is known to impair lactogenesis and alveolar differentiation during pregnancy (Lew et al., 2011), as TCDD induces AhR repressor (AhRR) expression, which blocks AhR physiologic function and the transcription of milk gene β-casein (Basham et al., 2015). Furthermore, perinatal exposure to different EDs such as bisphenol A and diethylstilbestrol has been shown to delay mammary gland differentiation during gestation (Kass et al., 2012). In conclusion, HCB acts as a xenoestrogen, modulating ERα, IGF-I and HER1 signaling, which results in the alteration of mammary gland development.

### 3.2. Preneoplastic lesions

It has been proposed that breast cancer begins with the uncontrolled proliferation of epithelial cells and progresses through atypical hyperplasia (Polyak and Kalluri, 2010). These are benign breast conditions or preneoplastic lesions, and they are considered premalignant structures and precursors of neoplastic lesions (Singh et al., 2000). Different studies in rodent models have shown that HCB does not initiate breast cancer in the times assayed (20–45 days) but induces preneoplastic lesions in the mammary gland such as ductal hyperplasia and stromal hypercellularity (Miret et al., 2017; Peña et al., 2012). In agreement, other EDs including bisphenol A, diethylstilbestrol and chlorpyrifos induce pre-carcinogenic mammary lesions in different rat and mouse models (Gomez et al., 2017; Vandenberg et al., 2008; Ventura et al., 2016). These lesions are the result of alterations in several pathways such as insulin, IGF-1 and estrogen. In this respect, we have shown HCB to enhance IGF-1R and insulin receptor (IR) expression and to activate their downstream signaling pathways in the rat mammary gland (Randi et al., 2006), which are involved in mitogenic actions in both mammary gland (Cohick, 2016) and breast cancer (Christopoulos et al., 2015). As mentioned previously, HCB treatment generates an estrogenic micro-environment in the rat mammary gland (Peña et al., 2012), and estrogen is widely established as the main steroid hormone inducing proliferation of mammary epithelial cells during the menstrual cycle (Clarke, 2006). In addition, HCB promotes ERα nuclear translocation in mouse and ERα phosphorylation in rat mammary gland epithelium (Miret et al., 2017; Peña et al., 2012). Moreover, HCB reduces AhR levels, a potent epithelial growth inhibitor, in epithelial cells from mouse mammary gland (Miret et al., 2017), which may explain why AhR fails to inhibit cell proliferation. The analysis of these results reinforces the notion that HCB modulates the mammary gland micro-environment, promoting the development of preneoplastic mammary lesions which could increase breast cancer risk.

### 3.3. Epithelial-stromal cell interaction

The mammary gland is composed of an extensive system of epithelial ducts surrounded by the extracellular matrix and multiple stromal cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and leukocytes. It is well recognized that the stroma plays a crucial role in mammary gland and breast cancer development by modifying the proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration capacity of mammary epithelial cells (Polyak and Kalluri, 2010). As mammary morphogenesis is regulated by small fluctuations in endogenous hormone levels, exposure to low doses of EDs can alter the delicate balance of hormone action, resulting in changes in epithelial and stromal cells and, consequently, in breast development. Finally, these alterations could lead to increased risk of breast cancer in adulthood (Burks et al., 2017). Understanding the effect of EDs on stromal cells is thus deemed highly relevant, as accumulating evidence suggests that fibroblasts, immune and endothelial cells contain prognostic information about breast cancer progression (Paulsson and Micke, 2014). In this section, we will discuss HCB action on epithelial mammary cells as well as on two key stromal components: fibroblasts and endothelial cells.

#### 3.3.1. Epithelial cells

As pointed out above, EDs have the particular characteristic of presenting greater effects at low doses than at high ones (Schneider et al., 2017), as observed in NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells exposed to HCB. At a dose similar to that found in serum of highly contaminated populations (5 μM), HCB activates the nuclear AhR pathway, reduces cell migration and induces G1 cell cycle arrest. This action on the cell cycle has been reported in different cell types and for several EDs, including TCDD, HCB and bisphenol A (Barhoover et al., 2010; Chiappini et al., 2013; García et al., 2010; Lee and Rhee, 2007). In agreement, treatment with 6-formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ), a strong and endogen ligand of AhR, reduces NMuMG cell migration and enhances epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin (Rico-Leo et al., 2013).

However, at a lower dose (0.05 μM), HCB activates the AhR membrane pathway, mediated by c-Src (Miret, 2018), which induces TGF-β1 signaling pathways and thus stimulates the phosphorylation of Smad3 and ERK1-2, all of which eventually leads to an increase in NMuMG cell migration (Miret et al., 2017) (Fig. 2). These data support the notion of TGF-β1 as one of AhR downstream effectors (Gómez-Durán et al., 2009). In this respect, Galliher and Schiemann (2006) have shown that c-Src can phosphorylate TGF-β1 receptor type II (TβRII) and thus induce TGF-β1 signaling. These pathways promote the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, as well as apoptosis and inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation. However, as tumor development progresses, TGF-β1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration and invasion (Zarzynska, 2014). In NMuMG cells, both treatment with TGF-β1 and a reduction in AhR levels have been found to induce cell migration and the expression of EMT markers (Rico-Leo et al., 2013). Indeed, the fact that HCB can exert opposite actions depending on which AhR pathway is activated makes it even more difficult to establish safe doses for these kinds of compounds.

In the ductal epithelial tree, cells communicate with each other through gap junctions composed of protein subunits called connexins. The current consensus appears to be that gap junction intercellular communication is lost in cancer cells, which constitutes an important driver of tumorigenesis. Connexin 43 is predominant in the human breast and its high expression has been associated to tumor suppression in primary tumors (Phillips et al., 2017). Interestingly, female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to HCB (100 mg/kg b.w.) by gavage during 50 days have shown a reduction in connexin 43 expression levels in mammary gland, which could be mediated by Akt activation. Although no significant effects of HCB exposure were observed in phospho-Akt protein levels in this in vivo model, in human non-tumorigenic breast cells MCF-12A the authors found that the activation of Akt decreases connexin 43 expression (Delisle et al., 2015). However, the role of this connexin in breast cancer is still controversial, as evidence has shown increased and reduced connexin 43 levels in association with better or

N.V. Miret, et al.

worse survival rates, depending on tumor subtypes (Busby et al., 2018).

### 3.3.2. Fibroblasts

Although a large number of studies have focused on the effects of AhR ligands on mammary epithelial cells, their action on fibroblasts has not been fully elucidated yet. In breast cancer, fibroblasts shift to an activated phenotype called cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and have been shown to play an active role in tumorigenesis (Paulsson and Micke, 2014). In a study performed in mouse mammary fibroblasts (FGM) AhR+/+ and AhR−/− cell lines, HCB exposure was shown to activate FGM AhR+/+, resembling a CAF phenotype found in tumor stroma. In this cell line, HCB (5 μM) increases α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, the most widely used marker for CAFs. At the same time, HCB reduces TβRII levels through a process likely to involve AhR (Miret et al., 2017). The presence of CAFs, which express high levels α-SMA but low content of TβRII, is associated with poor prognosis in human breast cancer (Busch et al., 2015). CAFs also contribute to mammary carcinogenesis by secreting cytokines like TGF-β1 and IL-6, which boost cell migration in different mammary epithelial cell lines (Mao et al., 2013). Accordingly, the conditioned medium from FGM AhR+/+ exposed to HCB (5 μM) promotes NMuMG cell migration (Miret et al., 2017) (Fig. 2). These data support the hypothesis that HCB contributes to breast cancer risk not only by modulating epithelial cells but also by altering the fibroblasts. The mammary stroma actively participates in the control of tumor growth and could be a crucial target for EDs, suggesting that alterations like fibroblast activation and stromal hypercellularity may lead to carcinogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for these effects may contribute to explaining how they influence cancer risk.

### 3.3.3. Endothelial cells

The mammary gland structure changes drastically depending on the hormonal environment; therefore, the vasculature needs to adapt repeatedly to the functional phase of the breast. In mature virgin female mice, the formation of new vessels is produced from pre-existing ones in a process named angiogenesis (Andres and Djonov, 2010). The surface of the healthy vessels is largely continuous, interrupted with minor areas of fenestration (Ryman et al., 2015). As the vasculature is the nutrient and oxygen supply for tissues, angiogenesis plays a crucial role and is required upon mammary hyperplasia or the remodeling of breast tissue concerning cell proliferation. This process is coordinated by the release of growth factors and hormones, among which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) constitutes the main regulator. VEGF is secreted by epithelial, endothelial and other stromal cells and exerts its effects through binding to VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2. The major signal transducer in endothelial cells, VEGFR2 may activate c-Src, ERK1-2, Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and p38. In this way, VEGFR2 signaling could regulate several processes including cell survival, proliferation, migration and vessel formation (Abhinand et al., 2016). A study performed by Pontillo et al. (2015) revealed that HCB activates human microvascular endothelial cells HMEC-1, enhancing cell migration and neovasculogenesis *in vitro*. These results also showed HCB to increase AhR and VEGFR2 levels, two proteins implicated in tumor angiogenesis and correlated with poor prognosis and survival (Harris et al., 2016; Roman et al., 2009; Rydén et al., 2010). In addition, pesticide binding to AhR induces VEGF expression and secretion and stimulates the VEGFR2 pathway by activating ERK1-2 and p38 (Pontillo et al., 2015). A possible mechanism for the regulation of VEGF expression involves the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)/PGE2 receptor EP2-EP4 axis (Liu et al., 2014). In this sense, HCB raises COX-2 protein levels (Pontillo et al., 2015), and the nuclear AhR pathway is known to increase the transcription of COX-2 (Degner et al., 2007). This dysregulation of COX-2 expression leads to higher levels of PGE2, which in turn activates EP2-EP4 receptors and may induce VEGF expression and angiogenesis (Xu et al., 2014). Likewise, VEGF may be thought to stimulate COX-2 levels, as reported Tamura

et al. (2002). Finally, HCB effects on cell migration and neovascularization involve AhR, COX-2 and VEGFR2 proteins (Pontillo et al., 2015). Altogether, these results suggest a potential connection with breast cancer and support the hypothesis that environmental pollutants such as organochlorine pesticides are involved in the modulation of angiogenesis and tumor promotion.

## 4. HCB action on breast cancer

Breast cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide (Torre et al., 2016), with environmental exposure to organochlorine compounds featuring among the risk factors for the disease (IBCEERCC, 2013). In this scenario, this section summarizes HCB effects on different processes associated to breast cancer.

### 4.1. Tumor growth and prognosis of breast cancer

It has been proposed that long-term exposure to environmental pollutants with estrogenic effect might be critically implicated in the process of carcinogenesis in hormone-related tumors. In this respect, high concentrations of HCB have been found in breast tumor samples compared to the surrounding normal tissue, which might be of relevance to the etiology of breast cancer (Eldakroory et al., 2017; Ellsworth et al., 2018). Moreover, Arrebola et al. (2016) have reported that high levels of HCB in adipose tissue from breast cancer patients in Spain were positively associated with ER and PR expression but negatively associated with p53 and E-cadherin. These results suggest that HCB induces a carcinogenic microenvironment which may modulate hormonal receptor expression, interfere with apoptotic signaling and promote invasiveness and metastatic processes. Accordingly, in a C4-HI syngeneic model in BALB/c mice (ERα- and PR-positive), HCB (0.3 and 3 mg/kg b.w.) was found to increase tumor volume and weight (Pontillo et al., 2013). Early studies have postulated HCB as a tumor co-carcinogen in the rat mammary gland. In a model of experimentally induced breast tumor in rats by N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU), HCB (100 mg/kg b.w.) increased tumor incidence, the number of tumors per rat and tumor volume. NMU-induced tumors are mammary ductal carcinomas with different degrees of cribriform, papillary and comedocarcinoma patterns, but with a predominant proportion of cribriform patterns consistent with a low or medium grade of malignancy. However, tumors developed in NMU-HCB rats showed the prevalence of undifferentiated features, with higher cellular atypia and an increased proportion of papillary and comedocarcinoma patterns (Randi et al., 2006). In contrast to its effect on the mammary gland, where HCB exerts estrogenic actions, in NMU rats HCB reduces ERα activation in tumors and serum estrogen levels, which supports the notion that HCB may participate in the transformation of breast cancer cells into more malignant tumors independent of hormone. This malignant phenotype could be partly explained by the fact that HCB promotes tumor growth through c-Src and HER1 activation, which induces c-Src/HER1 association, triggering Akt and STAT5b phosphorylation (Peña et al., 2012). c-Src and HER1 potentiate their own signaling, as HER1 can phosphorylate and activate c-Src and vice versa (Wang, 2017). Inappropriate activation of HER1 has been related to tumorigenesis (Sigismund et al., 2018), while HER1 overexpression has been linked to worse overall survival and disease-free survival in women with early breast cancer (Gonzalez-Conchas et al., 2018). In addition, HER1 and its ligands are involved in resistance to treatments including trastuzumab and anti-endocrine therapy (Kjaer et al., 2018). In a similar way, STAT5b is implicated in breast cancer cell migration, invasion and tamoxifen resistance (Jallow et al., 2018). In particular, it has been reported that the Cas/c-Src/HER1/STAT5 signaling pathway promotes tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (Riggins et al., 2006). Likewise, treatment with clinical anti-estrogen ICI182,780 (Fulvestrant) enhances the expression of genes associated with stemness, EMT and metastasis through STAT5b in normal mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer

Fig. 3. HCB effects on ERα-positive breast cancer cell proliferation. A) At low doses (0.005 and 0.05 μM), HCB induces the membrane AhR pathway, mediated by c-Src, activating ERα, IGF-1R and IR signaling, which results in an increase in cell proliferation. In addition, the active c-Src forms a complex with p27, releasing cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes and allowing cell cycle progression. B) In contrast, at high doses (0.5 and 5 μM), HCB stimulates the nuclear AhR pathway, evaluated by the increase in cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression, a target gene of AhR. Besides, p27 binds to the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

2011).

The mechanism through which HCB promotes ERα signaling is still unknown. This receptor could be activated independently of ligand stimulation through phosphorylation on Tyr537 by c-Src (Varricchio et al., 2007). As the pesticide exhibits little or no ability to bind to ERα (Noguerol et al., 2006), c-Src is likely to first phosphorylate ERα. Indeed, HCB treatment (0.005 μM) leads to c-Src activation, ERα phosphorylation on Tyr537 and cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells. Ligand-activated AhR can stimulate c-Src activity, which induces autophosphorylation and translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (Park et al., 2007). This AhR-dependent mechanism for HCB has been demonstrated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Pontillo et al., 2011) and in rat liver (Randi et al., 2008).

The transition from one phase of the cell cycle to another occurs in an orderly manner and is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The cyclin D1-CDK4 complex allows early G1 transition, whereas the cyclin E-CDK2 complex is necessary for S phase entry. The activity of these complexes is regulated by accessory factor p27, which inhibits the catalytic ability of CDKs (Diaz-Moralli et al., 2013). In MCF-7 cells, HCB (0.005 μM) increases cyclin D1 expression, stimulating cell cycle progression. Likewise, HCB treatment promotes the nuclear export of p27, which is retained in the cytosol by c-Src (Ventura et al., 2017) (Fig. 3A). In this way, cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes are released and the cell cycle can progress. Additionally, it has been reported that c-Src could phosphorylate p27, promoting its degradation (Chu et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2015). Although p27 was once considered a tumor suppressor for inhibiting cell cycle progression, this action is now known to depend on its localization, as cytoplasmic p27 induces EMT in human mammary epithelial cells and

increases invasion and metastasis in breast cancer (Zhao et al., 2015). On the other hand, high doses of HCB (0.5 and 5 μM) stimulate the nuclear AhR pathway, delay cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (García et al., 2010; Ventura et al., 2017), which resembles findings obtained in mammary epithelial cells NMuMG (Miret et al., 2017). Ligand-activated AhR is known to inhibit cell proliferation in normally cycling cell populations (Puga et al., 2009). Given that c-Src is not activated at these high HCB doses, the formation of the cyclin E-CDK2-p27 protein complex is promoted, resulting in the negative regulation of cell cycle progression (Ventura et al., 2017) (Fig. 3B). These findings are indeed concerning, as low doses which could be closer to actual human exposure may stimulate neoplastic cell proliferation and produce adverse effects.

### 4.3. Angiogenic switch

The vascular endothelium controls tumor initiation, development and metastasis, as tumors require extensive vascularization and increased angiogenesis. The increment in tumor growth exerted by HCB exposure hence implies high tumor vascularization. In response to pro-angiogenic factors, endothelial cells detach from their neighbors, migrate and proliferate to form new tubes which mature to develop a functional network (Weis and Cheresh, 2011). As discussed in Section 3.3.3, HCB treatment induces cell migration and vasculogenesis, increases VEGF expression and activates its signaling pathway in mammary endothelial cells HMEC-1 (Pontillo et al., 2015). Additionally, organochlorine pesticides chlordecone and lindane have been shown to augment endothelial cell proliferation, migration and metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity and to stimulate in vivo neovascularization (Clere

N.V. Miret, et al.

Fig. 4. HCB mechanism of action in hormone-independent breast cancer cells. HCB binds to the AhR-c-Src complex and triggers c-Src activation, enhancing the phosphorylation of TGF-β1 receptors and HER1 downstream pathways Smad3, JNK, p38, ERK1-2 and Stat5b. These signaling pathways induce TGF-β1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, which are secreted and accumulated in the culture medium. These events promote MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion, as well as metastasis in mouse models. On the other hand, the activation of TGF-β1/Smad signaling by HCB reduces AhR mRNA expression.

et al., 2012). This evidence suggests that HCB could modulate angiogenesis in the initial steps of carcinogenesis, when transition from prevascular hyperplasia to vascularized tumors takes place. The angiogenic switch was studied by Pontillo et al. (2015) in a xenograft model using cell line MDA-MB-231, in which cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice previously exposed to HCB. Angiogenesis was evaluated 5 days later, with results showing significantly induced formation of blood vessels and increased VEGF protein expression in mice skin from angiogenic sites after HCB treatment (3 and 30 mg/kg b.w.). These findings demonstrate the association between exposure to HCB, angiogenesis and mammary carcinogenesis.

### 4.4. Cell migration and invasion

As neoplastic cell movement is one of the initial steps in metastasis, the effect of HCB on cell migration and invasion has been widely studied in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 4). Results have shown that the pesticide stimulates the membrane AhR pathway via c-Src at a wide range of doses (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 μM) (Pontillo et al., 2011), but induces AhR nuclear translocation and activity as a transcription factor only at 5 μM (Miret et al., 2016). As a consequence, HCB activates different signaling pathways, including c-Src/HER1/STAT5b and HER1/ERK1-2, which converge in increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion (Pontillo et al., 2011, 2013). The induction of these pathways also stimulates MMP-2 and MMP-9, whose activities are necessary for HCB-induced invasion (Pontillo et al., 2013). Both MMPs are highly expressed in breast tumors and are closely associated to metastasis and tumor prognosis, as they degrade the basal membrane and thus allow tumor cell movement (Li et al., 2017). Accordingly, HCB (0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg b.w.) was shown to stimulate MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expression in tumors from an orthotopic mouse xenograft model with MDA-MB-231 cells (Pontillo et al., 2013).

Abundant research establishes that AhR and TGF-β1 signaling interact and regulate common processes. Furthermore, mechanisms of reciprocal regulation have been demonstrated between these proteins. TGF-β1 can reduce or increase AhR mRNA levels depending on the cell type and tissue (Haarmann-Stemmann et al., 2009; Wolff et al., 2001), whereas TGF-β1 higher levels are synthesized and secreted in the absence of AhR (Gómez-Durán et al., 2009). HCB exposure results in the modulation of TGF-β1 expression and the activation of its signaling pathway in different models, such as rat liver (Giribaldi et al., 2011), thyroid cells (Chiappini et al., 2014) and breast epithelial cells (Miret et al., 2017). In MDA-MB-231 cells, HCB alters the crosstalk between AhR and TGF-β1, reducing AhR mRNA levels but increasing TGF-β1 expression and activity. In summary, HCB promotes the AhR/c-Src axis, which in turn stimulates the canonical (Smad3) and non-canonical

(ERK1-2, JNK and p38) TGF-β1 signaling pathways, which contribute to an increase in cell migration and invasion (Miret et al., 2016) (Fig. 4). These results suggest that alterations in the interaction between these proteins could have serious implications in the progression of breast cancer.

#### 4.5. Metastasis

The study of the metastatic cascade has long sparked great interest in research, as this process is the main cause of breast cancer death (Jemal et al., 2011). It has been proposed that metastatic capacity is a late and acquired event in breast tumorigenesis. The metastatic process requires that breast cancer cells detach from the primary tumor tissue, migrate and invade neighboring tissue until crossing the endothelial barrier, to finally enter the circulatory and lymphatic system. After escaping from blood and lymphatic vessels, tumor cells may migrate and form metastases (Melzer et al., 2017).

Given that the first steps of this cascade are promoted by HCB, this pesticide may be also expected to alter metastasis. In a model of spontaneous metastasis where C4-HI mammary tumors were transplanted into female BALB/c mice, a low dose of HCB (0.3 mg/kg b.w.) promoted lung and liver micrometastasis after 30 days of treatment (Pontillo et al., 2013). Worth pointing out, this model poses the advantage of expressing ER and PR, and of evaluating all steps in the metastatic process. In a different model of experimental metastasis where the murine mammary carcinoma cell line LM3 was injected into the tail vein of BALB/c mice, a higher dose (30 mg/kg b.w.) of HCB did not alter total metastasis but increased the number of greater size metastatic foci observed in lungs (Pontillo et al., 2013). At variance with the previous protocol, this model is hormone-independent and evaluates the late steps in the metastatic cascade, as tumor cells must leave the circulatory system and form metastases in the lung. These results may respond to an acceleration of the process which allows early foci production, an increment in cell proliferation, or a merge of several metastatic foci into a larger one. A remarkable finding is that HCB facilitates lung metastasis in both models, regardless of hormone receptor status. Liu et al. (2010) observed similar results with other organochlorine compounds; in particular, PCB treatment increased MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell migration and induced MDA-MB-231 metastatic capacity in lung and liver. In summary, HCB exposure has been shown to constitute a risk factor for breast cancer promotion, as it induces tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis.

### 5. Concluding remarks

Historically, investment in breast cancer research has focused

N.V. Miret, et al.

mainly on diagnosis and treatment, while advances in the area of breast cancer prevention and the search for ways to identify and mitigate environmental causes of the disease have not been given priority. Specific studies on the impact of environmental factors on mammary gland development are deemed necessary, as the alterations induced may influence the risk of breast cancer. It has been postulated that the significant increase in breast cancer incidence observed in recent years may be due to exposure to chemicals acting as EDs. In particular, the effects of HCB exposure have been extensively studied in the mammary gland and different stages of breast cancer, with results showing that environmentally relevant concentrations of HCB may produce alterations in mammary gland morphogenesis, leading to the acquisition of preneoplastic lesions and a pro-migratory phenotype. Furthermore, the numerous trials conducted in different models of breast cancer *in vitro* and *in vivo* point to the conclusion that HCB acts on tumor progression, both in hormone-dependent and independent stages, stimulating proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Therefore, these findings suggest that exposure to HCB could be a risk factor for human breast cancer development.

Given that AhR is overexpressed in mammary tumors and can be a positive or negative prognostic factor, the use of selective AhR modulators has been postulated as a potential treatment in cancer (Powell et al., 2013; Safe et al., 2017). However, the current review shows that HCB can increase or decrease AhR protein expression and still contribute to signaling pathways related to cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Other reports have established that the activation of nuclear AhR signaling is related to breast cancer prevention and propose AhR as a therapeutic target (Hall, 2014). Using different breast cancer cell lines, Hall et al. (2010) showed that TCDD exposure activates the nuclear AhR pathway, promotes differentiation and inhibits cell invasiveness and colony formation regardless of ER, PR or HER2 status. These contradictory reports of AhR as a tumor suppressor or a tumorigenic factor suggest that ligand affinity and the signaling pathways activated will ultimately determine the role of this receptor in breast cancer. A better understanding of AhR signaling pathways activated in breast cancer could contribute to identifying downstream targets which may constitute an even better option for therapy. HCB is a weak AhR ligand which can activate membrane or nuclear AhR pathways, depending on cell type and exposure doses. The main conclusion of this review is that when the AhR/c-Src axis (membrane pathway) is stimulated by HCB, breast alterations and tumor progression are promoted, regardless of the nuclear AhR pathway activation status. Accordingly, Ye et al. (2018) established that the AhR/c-Src axis is essential in resistance to treatment with HER1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer. Nevertheless, when the nuclear AhR pathway is induced but c-Src remains inactive, HCB triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These observations should be taken into account for the development of pharmacological drugs targeting AhR in breast cancer. Specifically, the analysis of c-Src kinase activity should be included in the search of these selective AhR modulators.

It is known that hormones can act at very low doses and that they often have non-linear and non-monotonic dose-response curves. It is expected that EDs, which interfere with hormonal action, also follow similar rules. Several reports show that EDs usually exhibit non-monotonic dose-response relationships and effects are often observed below the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) (Zoeller and Vandenberg, 2015). The results analyzed here show that response to HCB depends on the presence of hormone receptors. In turn, hormone ability to produce effects depends on the specificity of hormone-receptor interactions and on the variation of the expression profiles of these receptors throughout development (Vandenberg et al., 2013). The effects observed of HCB exposure in different cell lines and animal models which do not express ERα or PR show monotonic responses (Miret et al., 2016; Pontillo et al., 2011, 2013; 2015). However, in the hormonal receptor positive models, U-shaped or inverted U-shaped dose responsiveness curves are observed (García et al., 2010; Miret

et al., 2017; Pontillo et al., 2013; Ventura et al., 2017), which entails the risk that lower doses than those established as safe and closer to actual human exposure levels could produce adverse effects (Vandenberg et al., 2012).

The fact that the incidence and mortality of breast cancer has not declined unveils the need for both new therapeutic targets and prevention work to reduce exposure to these compounds, especially among pregnant women, children and adolescents. Although the production and use of HCB has been banned, this compound is persistent in the environment and populations are still exposed. A relevant fact in some current epidemiological studies is the detection of HCB in a large proportion of human samples, such as breast adipose tissue, puerperal and umbilical cord serum and breast milk. The mammary gland has adjacent adipose tissue that can potentially bioaccumulate organochlorine residues, which may provide a proliferative microenvironment influencing tumor growth and increasing malignancy. The evidence presented is testimony to the low adherence to norms, the persistence of organochlorine pesticides in the food chain and the relevance of this public health concern even upon compound prohibition. In this sense, information from epidemiological studies and basic research may enhance prevention by eliminating potentially harmful exposure and establishing safe exposure levels. The development of strategies to reduce exposure to EDs and to promote cancer prevention must be carried out jointly by institutions representing science, medicine, industry, and governments. It is also necessary to inform the public about the presence of EDs in everyday consumer products and its consequences, as well as methods to reduce exposure risk, especially for pregnant and lactating women, young children and adolescents.

In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that the presence and bioaccumulation of EDs such as HCB in tissues with high fat content and in highly sensitive time windows make this compound a risk factor for breast tumor development.
