## Abstract

### Introduction
Accumulating evidence suggests that the interleukin (IL)-17 cytokines are major players in the immune response to foreign pathogens. In addition, the pathogeneses of a number of inflammatory diseases have been linked to uncontrolled expression of these cytokine pathways.

### Discussion
Genetic and biochemical analyses have elucidated the cellular and molecular events triggered by these proteins during an inflammatory response. While significant efforts have been placed on understanding the functions of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17E, the significance of the other family members, IL-17B-D, in inflammation remains to be determined.

### Conclusion
This review will focus on the cellular sources, target cell/receptors that are utilized by these cytokines to control pathogenesis, and the therapeutic potential of targeting these pathways to treat inflammatory disorders.

## Introduction

The interleukin-17 family of cytokines contains six members, interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E (also called IL-25), and IL-17F. IL-17A, the prototype member of this family, was cloned from a cDNA library derived from activated T cells [1]. But it was not recognized as a proinflammatory cytokine until Yao and colleagues published their seminal work and defined its biological activities [2]. In humans, IL-17A is a glycoprotein of 155 amino acids with a molecular weight of 15 kDa and is secreted as a disulfide-linked homodimer of 35 kDa [3]. The related family members were identified through database searches based on their homology to IL-17A [4]. They share between 20% and 50% amino acid identity to IL-17A. Of these, IL-17A and IL-17F share the highest amino acid identity (50%) [5, 6]. Common features among the IL-17 cytokine family include higher conservation on the C terminus as well as five spatially conserved cysteine residues. Structural analysis of IL-17A and IL-17F homodimers revealed that four of these conserved cysteine residues are used to form cystine-knot structures similar to those found in growth factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and nerve growth factor [7, 8]

IL-17A and IL-17F

IL-17A was first named as IL-17 by Yao and colleagues [2]. IL-17F was subsequently cloned based on homology to IL-17A [9]. IL-17A and IL-17F can be secreted as both disulfide-linked homodimeric and heterodimeric glycoproteins [5, 6]. IL-17A and IL-17F dimers have largely overlapping but distinct functions, with their potencies of proinflammatory cytokine induction on most target cells ranked as IL-17A > IL-17A/F > IL-17F [5, 6, 10, 11]. IL-17A and IL-17F signal through an IL-17RA–IL-17RC complex (Fig. 1), found on the surface of a multitude of target cells, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts [12].

IL-17A and IL-17F homodimers and heterodimers are produced by Th17 cells, CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, activated monocytes, and neutrophils [9, 13–18]. Th17 cells are a subset of CD4⁺ T helper cells, named for their ability to preferentially produce IL-17. Th17 cells mediate host defense against infectious pathogens and contribute to development of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and psoriasis [19]. Th17 cells are the main source of IL-17A and IL-17F. IL-6 and TGF-β induce the differentiation of Th17 cells, while IL-23 and IL-21 maintain and expand Th17 cells [20–28]. Transcription factors, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-γt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, ROR-α, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, interferon regulatory factor 4, and c-Maf play important roles in Th17 cell differentiation and the expression of IL-17A and IL-17F in these cells. [28–31].

IL-23 also regulates IL-17A production from CD8⁺ T cells, NKT, and γδ T cells; however, unlike Th17 cells, both NKT and γδ T cells can produce IL-17A independent of IL-6 signaling [14, 17, 32, 33]. Innate production of IL-17A by γδ T cells is enhanced by IL-23 and IL-1β signaling as well as pathogen recognition via Toll-like receptors [34, 35]. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that IL-17A and IL-17F are not always co-expressed or coregulated, for instance, IL-17F and not IL-17A mRNA expression was detected in colonic epithelial cells [36]. The contribution of these other sources of IL-17A and IL-17F during an immune response remains to be confirmed.

IL-17A and IL-17F trigger proinflammatory responses. Upon receptor binding, IL-17A and IL-17F induce expression of multiple genes involved in tissue-mediated innate immunity including proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10), cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)), antimicrobial peptides (mucins, β-defensins, S100A7-9), and proteins involved in tissue remodeling and acute phase responses (serum amyloid A, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) [37]. IL-17A and IL-17F can also synergize with other cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and interferon-γ to augment the induction of proinflammatory responses from various target cells [38–40]. Both IL-17A and IL-17F promote granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization to sites of infection [37]. Overexpression of IL-17A or IL-17F in vivo increased neutrophil infiltration through modulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines resulting in inflammation [18, 41–43].

**Fig. 1 Overview of IL-17 family ligands (IL-17A–IL-17F) and IL-17 receptor family (IL-17RA–IL-17RE) relationships and known functions. Previously characterized IL-17 receptor-ligand interactions are depicted by black arrows. The red arrows represent the induction of signaling pathways mediated through IL-17 receptor-ligand complex formation. A question mark is used for unknown receptors, ligands, or signaling pathways. Each IL-17 receptor subunit is composed of an extracellular-fibronectin III-like (FnIII) domain, a single transmembrane domain (TM), and an intracellular SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) domain.**
In agreement with the described cellular functions, in vivo studies demonstrate the importance of these in host defense against pathogen infections. Use of mice deficient in IL-17A, IL-17F, or both has provided that insight into the distinct roles each cytokine plays in response to particular pathogens. Both IL-17A and IL-17F are required in the response to local Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infections, as singly and doubly deficient mice displayed heightened bacterial burdens and pathology following local *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Citrobacter rodentium* infections \[36, 44\]. In addition, *Il17a*⁻/⁻ mice display increased susceptibility to the pulmonary pathogen *Klebsiella pneumoniae* \[44\]. Susceptibility to bacterial infections is attributed to defective G-CSF responses, granulopoiesis, and neutrophil mobilization \[44, 45\]. The IL-17A/F pathway is also required for antifungal defense. Adenoviral expression of IL-17A in normal mice protects from lethal doses of *Candida albicans* infection \[46\], while neutralization of IL-17A in normal mice infected with the yeast *Pneumocystis carinii* increases fungal burden \[47\]. In contrast to the protective role observed during extracellular bacterial infections, IL-17A-deficient mice are not susceptible to primary infections with intracellular bacterial pathogens such as *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and *Listeria monocytogenes* \[44\]. Instead, IL-17A is critical for the enhancement of memory responses against these pathogens. Vaccination of mice with *M. tuberculosis* antigens resulted in pulmonary accumulation of IL-17-producing T cells, and after challenge with *M. tuberculosis*, IL-17-inducible chemokine expression mediates the recruitment of Th1 effector cells to lung tissue \[48\]. Consequently, these findings suggest that IL-17A and IL-17F are important for innate protection to primary infections against extracellular bacteria and fungi and for memory responses to intracellular bacterial infections.

In addition to protective properties, the IL-17A/F pathway is implicated in the development of autoimmune responses \[19\]. Elevated IL-17A and IL-17F levels have been detected in several human autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, RA, MS, and IBD (Table I) \[36, 49–56\]. Preclinical models of RA, IBD, and MS have implicated roles for these cytokines in disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, emerging data suggest that IL-17A and IL-17F provide distinct functions during development of autoimmune diseases. IL-17A has a more critical role for the development of models of RA and MS, while IL-17F may have a more important role in the pathogenesis of IBD \[18, 36, 57\]. Reduced IL-17A expression, either through genetic deficiency or antibody-blockade, ameliorated disease activities in preclinical animal models of RA \[57–59\]. Consistently, overexpression of IL-17A through adenoviral-mediated gene transfer in the knee joint of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice promoted disease and aggravated joint destruction \[58, 59\]. However, although IL-17F mediated similar proinflammatory activities as IL-17A from cultured RA synoviocytes \[56\], a recent study using *Il17f*⁻/⁻ mice suggests that IL-17F has a minimal role compared to IL-17A in the development of arthritis in mice \[36\]. Moreover, studies using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for MS also implicate IL-17A in disease pathogenesis. IL-17A deficiency or blockade reduced disease severity in EAE \[18, 60, 61\]. Additionally, therapeutic treatment using an IL-17A neutralizing monoclonal antibody ameliorated the disease course in acute EAE \[43, 60\]. However, similar to what was observed in the arthritis preclinical models, *Il17f*⁻/⁻ mice displayed moderate improvement in recovery compared with both wild-type and *Il17a*⁻/⁻ mice \[18\].

Contrary to the observations from the models of RA and EAE, the roles of IL-17A and IL-17F in IBD are less clear. IL-17A and IL-17F have opposing functions in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model of IBD. While *Il17a*⁻/⁻ mice developed more severe disease in DSS-induced IBD, IL-17F deficiency resulted in reduced colitis in this model \[18\]. Consistently, antibody blockade of IL-17A in the same model aggravated disease \[62\]. One study also suggests a protective role for IL-17A in the CD45RBhi T cell transfer model of colitis \[63\]. Another study, however, concludes that both IL-17A and IL-17F exert pathogenic functions in a similar model \[64\]. More studies are clearly required to further address this issue.

Overall, accumulating evidence supports the importance of IL-17A and IL-17F in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and in turn provides justification to develop therapeutics that target the IL-17 pathway. Several therapies designed to neutralize IL-17A are now in clinical development. The front-runners are AIN457 (Novartis) and LY2439821 (Eli Lilly), both anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies. AIN457 recently completed phase I/IIa trials in psoriasis, RA and autoimmune uveitis, while LY2439821 is currently conducting phase II trial in RA. The preliminary results presented at the 2009 European League Against Rheumatism meeting show that anti-IL-17A blocking antibodies appear to effectively reduce disease signs and lower symptoms without severe adverse effects \[65, 66\].

### IL-17E (IL-25)

IL-17E, or IL-25, shares 25% to 35% homology with the other IL-17 family members. Basal IL-17E RNA expression was initially found in testis, prostate, trachea, brain, spinal cord, kidney, lung, and heart \[67–70\]. Expression of IL-17E is induced in the gut following *Nippostrongylus brasiliensis* infection and in the lung after *Aspergillus fumigatus* infection or ovalbumin sensitization \[41\]. The

cellular sources of IL-17E include activated Th2 cells [67], activated eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells [71, 72]. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating IL-17E expression. Biochemical analysis indicates that IL-17RB (alternatively known as IL-17Rh1, IL-17BR, IL-25R, or Evi27) binds IL-17E with high affinity (Fig. 1) [69]. In addition, genetic studies indicate that IL-17RA is functionally required for IL-17E biology [73]. While a direct physical interaction between IL-17E and IL-17RA has not been detected, association of IL-17RA with a preformed IL-17E–IL-17RB complex was reported in the micromolar range [74].

In vivo studies indicate that IL-17E promotes Th2 immunity. Transgenic mice expressing IL-17E under a liver-specific or myosin promoter display eosinophilia and neutrophilia in the blood and enhanced serum IgE, IgA, IgG1, and Th2 cytokines [68, 70]. Similar results were observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice expressing IL-17E under a lung-specific promoter [75]. Analyses of *Il17e*^−/−^ mice revealed the necessity for this cytokine in the clearance of the parasite *Trichuris muris* and the helminth *N. brasiliensis* [76, 77], both pathogens requiring Th2 immunity for eradication. In agreement with the genetic data, in vivo administration IL-25 induces rapid clearance of *N. brasiliensis* [76].

Consistent with its role in Th2 immunity, IL-17E is implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. IL-17E expression is elevated in the lung tissue of asthmatic patients and in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients (Table I) [72, 78]. Mice administrated intranasal IL-17E displayed asthmatic symptoms, including IL-4/5/13 upregulation, eosinophil infiltration and mucous production in

the lung, and airway hyperresponsiveness [41]. Administration of a neutralizing anti-IL-17E antibody in a mouse model of lung inflammation prevented acute asthmatic symptoms [79]. Interestingly, mice lacking IL-4/5/9/13 still displayed asthmatic symptoms upon intranasal injection of IL-17E [79], suggesting that IL-17E has a unique pathway bypassing conventional Th2 cytokines.

While IL-17E is implicated in promoting the Th2 response, in vivo studies suggest that it plays a role in inhibiting Th1 and Th17 biology. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-treated *Il17e*^−/−^ mice displayed an elevated number of IL-17A-expressing cells and higher EAE clinical scores [80]. This increase in disease severity is linked to enhanced expression of IL-23, a critical mediator of Th17 survival and maintenance [81]. Consistent with this observation, MOG-treated mice injected with IL-17E display reduced EAE clinical scores [80]. This inhibition is proposed to result from IL-17E induction of IL-13, which in turn blocks IL-23 secretion by DCs, preventing Th17 cell survival. [80]. In addition, IL-17E prevented Th1 cell-driven colitis by inhibiting IL-12 and IL-23 expression by CD14^+^ cells isolated from inflamed gut of IBD patients [82]. Interestingly, IL-17E expression is downregulated in inflamed colon tissue of patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, implying the possibility of IL-17E as therapeutic reagent for IBD [82].

IL-17B, IL-17C, and IL-17D

IL-17B, IL-17C, and IL-17D were identified through database searches based on their 23–29% homology to IL-
17A [9, 83, 84]. Sequence comparison to IL-17A suggests that these cytokines also form dimers. However, in contrast to IL-17A or IL-17F dimers, biochemical analysis of IL-17B suggests that it forms a tightly associated, nondisulfide-linked dimer [84]. It is unknown whether IL-17C and IL-17D behave accordingly. The receptors utilized by these cytokines are unclear. In vitro biochemical analyses indicate that IL-17B binds specifically to IL-17RB with a high affinity of 7.6 nM (Fig. 1) [84]. Interestingly, while IL-17E also interacts with IL-17RB, it remains to be determined whether IL-17B shares any functional properties with IL-17E [69]. The receptors for IL-17C and IL-17D are unknown.

The cellular sources, targets, and specific functions of IL-17B, IL-17C, and IL-17D are less clear. IL-17B mRNA is broadly expressed in multiple tissues, with protein expression detected in neuronal cell bodies and axons from mouse spinal cord and brain, and chondrocytes [4, 83–87]. IL-1β treatment of bovine cartilage explants significantly elevated IL-17B protein expression [88], although the significance of this observation is unclear. In contrast, IL-17C mRNA expression is rare in most tissues and appears to be induced during inflammation, as discussed below [83]. IL-17D mRNA is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle, brain, adipose tissue, heart, lung, and pancreas [9].

Data suggest that expression of these IL-17 family members is regulated during inflammation. IL-17B and IL-17C were detected in the inflamed paws of mice with CIA, with IL-17B exclusively found in chondrocytes while IL-17C was detected in several populations of leukocytes [89]. IL-17C mRNA was detected following bacterial infection of the lung by *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* and in epidermal keratinocytes in response to *S. aureus* [90, 91]. Examination of human disease samples revealed elevated IL-17B, IL-17C, and IL-17D mRNA expression in rheumatoid nodules, a complication of severe RA [92]. Elevated expression of IL-17C mRNA was also observed in synovial fluid mononuclear cells in response to IL-15 and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from RA patients [93]. In addition, augmented IL-17C was detected in lesional psoriatic skin, while expression of IL-17B and IL-17D was depressed (Table I) [94]. Thus, regulated expression of these IL-17 family members could potentially influence inflammatory responses that mediate the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.

Cell-based assays and in vivo studies suggest that these family members may contribute to inflammation. IL-17B induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, from a number of target cells, including monocytes, fibroblasts, and cells derived from the peritoneal cavity [83, 89]. Likewise, IL-17C also induced similar proinflammatory cytokine expression from monocytes and fibroblasts [83, 89]. Additionally, treatment of

human subepithelial myofibroblasts with IL-17B, IL-17C, or IL-17D weakly increased IL-6, IL-8, LIF, and MMP3 secretion [95]. IL-17D stimulated the production of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF from human endothelial cells as well as the stimulation of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNAs from chicken fibroblasts [9, 96]. Preliminary studies overexpressing these cytokines in vivo substantiate their role in inflammation. In vivo overexpression of IL-17B and IL-17C suggest that these cytokines can promote neutrophil migration [41, 84]. Bone marrow chimeric mice overexpressing IL-17B or IL-17C that were subsequently induced with CIA demonstrated increased proinflammatory cytokine expression and exacerbated arthritis progression [89]. In agreement, the adoptive transfer of CD4⁺ T cells transduced with IL-17B or IL-17C into collagen-immunized mice exacerbated disease, whereas blocking of IL-17B suppressed the progression of arthritis and bone destruction in the CIA model [89]. Overall, data from both human and animal models suggest that IL-17B, IL-17C, and IL-17D might have a role in inflammatory disease, thus highlighting the need to further investigate their biological functions.

### IL-17 Receptors

The IL-17 receptor family, composed of five members, IL-17RA–RE, are structurally distinct proteins with little homology to other receptors and mediate signaling events that are unique from the activation cascades initiated in other cytokine systems. Each subunit is composed of a single transmembrane domain, an extracellular-fibronectin III-like (FnIII) domain, and an intracellular SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) domain (Fig. 1). Alternative spliced variants have been described for a number of the genes in this superfamily, resulting in soluble versions of the proteins. The SEFIR domain shares considerable homology with the Toll-/IL-1R (TIR) domains found in receptors of the innate immune system. However, the SEFIR domain found in the IL-17 receptor family lacks certain features that prevent association with adaptor proteins found in TIR signaling pathways. Instead, the SEFIR domain in the cytoplasmic tails of the IL-17Rs promotes protein-protein interactions with other SEFIR domain containing proteins, to initiate downstream signaling cascades and proinflammatory functions. As Gaffen has recently reviewed the signaling mechanisms utilized by the IL-17 receptor family, we will not be discussing this feature of IL-17 biology in this review and will focus on the biological outcomes of these biochemical pathways [12].

#### IL-17RA

IL-17RA was the first member of this family to be cloned and was identified as the receptor for IL-17A. As describedabove, IL-17RA is ubiquitously expressed, with expression on stromal cells being critical for IL-17A and IL-17F responses to pathogens. In addition, expression on neurons, macrophage, and DCs has been reported, although the role for IL-17RA in these systems is not well defined [97]. Cytokine regulation of IL-17RA expression has been explored, with some evidence suggesting that IL-15 and IL-21 can induce IL-17RA on CD8⁺ T cells [98]. However, the function of IL-17RA on this population of T cells is unclear. In addition, elevated IL-17RA expression has been detected in human diseases, including arthritic joints from patients with RA (Table I) [99, 100], suggesting that IL-17RA-mediated signals augment autoimmunity. Consistent with these observations, genetic studies have identified risk haplotypes within the IL-17RA gene that increase susceptibility to Crohn’s disease [101].

Biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that IL-17RA can pair with multiple other receptors in this family. As discussed above, the assembly of a heterodimeric complex between IL-17RA and IL-17RC is required for the biological functions of IL-17A and IL-17F (Fig. 1). Deficiencies of either chain fail to induce IL-17A and IL-17F mediated events including proinflammatory cytokine secretion [100]. Affinity studies demonstrate a strong association between IL-17A and IL-17RA, measured in the low nanomolar range, while the interaction between IL-17F and IL-17RA is weaker [102]. This difference in binding affinities is in accord with the potency of each of the cytokine dimers [6, 11]. Structural analyses combined with surface plasmon resonance measurements suggest that assembly of the heterodimeric receptor complex occurs in a stepwise manner, with the higher affinity interaction between cytokine and receptor preceding the assembly of the complete receptor complex [74]. As the IL-17A–IL-17RA interaction is strong, the proposed mechanism involves initial binding of IL-17A to IL-17RA followed by recruitment of IL-17RC into the complex.

As discussed above, genetic data indicate that IL-17RA is necessary for IL-17E function [73]. It has been suggested that IL-17RA may be a common chain for a number of IL-17 family members [74]. IL-17RD has been shown to associate with IL-17RA (described below) [103]. Structural analyses implicate this chain as the predominant receptor for pairing with the other IL-17R chains. However, the significance of this observation has not been explored.

Numerous studies using genetically deficient mice and blocking reagents have demonstrated the role for IL-17RA-mediated signals in mediating host defense. *Il17ra*⁻/⁻ mice cannot induce the chemokines necessary for neutrophil recruitment and granulopoiesis, resulting in a failure to mobilize neutrophils to sites of infection [45, 104], rendering them susceptible to multiple types of infections, including parasitic, extracellular bacterial, and fungal pathogens [46, 105]. In addition, the failure to mount efficient immune responses protects these mice from developing disease in preclinical models of arthritis, IBD, and influenza infection [104, 106, 107]. The ability of IL-17RA to regulate immune responses has prompted investigators to determine the therapeutic potential of blocking this chain in inflammation. Soluble versions of IL-17RA confer protection from allograft rejection, joint damage in models of arthritis and *Chlamydia* infection [108–110]. Presumably the phenotype of the *Il17ra*⁻/⁻ mice and the effects of the soluble receptor are due to absence/blockade of IL-17A- and IL-17F-mediated pathways; however, given the recent data suggesting that IL-17RA can function as a receptor for all IL-17 family members, it is difficult to conclude that targeting this pathway will be specific for one cytokine over another [74].

**IL-17RB**

Screening expressed sequence tag databases for IL-17RA like molecules identified the IL-17RB chain. As described above, IL-17RB binds to both IL-17B and IL-17E in vitro (Fig. 1) [69, 84]. While the function of the IL-17B–IL-17RB interaction is unknown, much effort has been put into understanding IL-17E–IL-17RB-mediated events. Expression of IL-17RB is detected in lung, kidney, bone, and fetal liver tissues [84]. Further characterization of IL-17RB revealed expression in subsets of NKT, memory Th2, lung epithelial, airway smooth muscle, macrophages, non-B/T ckit⁺, and endothelial cells [76, 111–115]. Activation of Th2 memory cells with either anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, IL-7/15 cytokines, or cocultures of DCs stimulated with thymic stromal lymphopoietin augments IL-17RB expression [72]. While the function of IL-17RB on each of these cell types is unclear, multiple studies suggest that they participate in IL-17E-induced Th2 immune responses, in particular airway inflammation. In accord with these observations, elevated expression of IL-17RB is detected in asthmatic lungs, as well as in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients (Table I) [72], and the 5661G-A polymorphism within the IL-17RB gene has been identified to be protective against asthma [116].

Genetic and biochemical data indicate IL-17RB pairs with IL-17RA to mediate IL-17E function [73]. As discussed above, IL-17RB binding to IL-17E recruits IL-17RA to the complex. Genetic ablation of either IL-17RB or IL-17RA gene blocked IL-17E-mediated lung inflammation. Similar findings were observed when IL-17E treated mice were administered blocking antibodies to either receptor chain [73]. In accordance with this data, IL-17E responses are lost with deficiency or blockade of IL-17RA.
IL-17RC

IL-17RC was initially identified using a bioinformatics approach for proteins homologous to IL-17RA [102]. As discussed earlier, IL-17RC has been shown to pair with IL-17RA to mediate the biological functions of IL-17A and IL-17F (Fig. 1), and the absence of either chain renders cells insensitive to these cytokines. Consistent with these data, IL-17RC shares expression with IL-17RA in number of cells, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, chondrocytes, and macrophages [117]. However, recent studies have determined that IL-17RC expression is elevated in colon, small intestine, and lung tissues while IL-17RA is not detected [36], suggesting that IL-17RC may have biological functions independent of IL-17RA. Biochemical analyses demonstrate high affinity interactions between IL-17RC–IL-17A and IL-17RC–IL-17F (Fig. 1) [74]. There have been no reports of IL-17RC binding to other IL-17 family members. As with IL-17RA, IL-17RC expression is elevated in patients with RA, emphasizing the role of this pathway in autoimmune disease pathology (Table I) [99, 100]. Interestingly, expression of alternative splice variants of IL-17RC has been identified in prostate cancer tumors; however, the function of these proteins is unclear [118, 119].

- IL-17RC function has only been reported in the context of IL-17A and IL-17F biology. In agreement with the essential role for IL-17RC in IL-17A and IL-17F responses, genetic deletion or antibody-mediated blockade of this chain abrogates IL-17A and IL-17F effects, including IL-6 and Gro-α secretion by fibroblasts and GM-CSF induction from colons explants [11, 120]. Consistent with the results from *Il17ra*⁻/⁻ mice, *Il17rc*⁻/⁻ mice also are resistant to the development of EAE (Helen Hu, JI, accepted).

IL-17RD and IL-17RE

Little is known about these members of the IL-17R family, which were also identified through database searches. As they are orphan receptors, their role in inflammation has not been addressed. IL-17RD was found to be expressed in endothelial cells and epithelial cells, with no detectable expression in hematopoietic cells [121]. Biochemical studies suggest that IL-17RD can complex with IL-17RA to mediate IL-17A function [103]. Mutations in the IL-17RD cytoplasmic domain suppress IL-17A induction of the 24p3 luciferase reporter [103]. Overexpression studies suggest that IL-17RD can suppress fibroblast growth factor-mediated Ras and PI3K signaling in zebrafish and human cells; however, the significance of this inhibition has not been elucidated.

IL-17RE RNA was detected in kidney, lung, stomach, testis, and intestine; however, there is no data defining the cellular populations that are IL-17RE⁺ [122]. A large number of splice variants of the IL-17RE gene have been identified, yet the function of these isoforms is unknown [122]. Overexpression studies suggest that this chain participates in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, but further studies are required to understand the significance of this observation.

### Conclusions and Future Directions

While great efforts have culminated in a better understanding of the biological functions of IL-17 family cytokines, there is still much to be learned. Understanding the roles of the newer family members and the orphan receptors will provide more insight into the function of this family in immunity and disease. Elucidating how these proteins function in the pathogenesis of human disease will provide a better understanding for developing new therapies to treat inflammatory disorders.
