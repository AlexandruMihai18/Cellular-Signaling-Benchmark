### Abstract

The thyroid gland is a unique endocrine organ that requires hydrogen peroxide ($\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$) for thyroid hormone formation. The molecule for $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ production in the thyroid gland has been known as dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2). Recently, NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a homolog of the NOX family, was added as a new intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the human thyroid gland. This review focuses on the recent progress of the DUOX system and its possible contribution to human thyroid diseases. Also, we discuss human thyroid diseases related to abnormal $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ generation. The DUOX molecule contains peroxidase-like and NADPH oxidase-like domains. Human thyroid gland also contains DUOX1 that shares 83% similarity with the DUOX2 gene. However, thyroid DUOX1 protein appears to play a minor role in $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ production. DUOX proteins require DUOX maturation or activation factors (DUOXA1 or 2) for proper translocation of DUOX from the endoplasmic reticulum to the apical plasma membrane, where $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ production takes place. Thyroid cells contain antioxidants to protect cells from the $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$-mediated oxidative damage. Loss of this balance may result in thyroid cell dysfunction and thyroid diseases. Mutation of either DUOX2 or DUOXA2 gene is a newly recognized cause of hypothyroidism due to insufficient $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ production. Papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common thyroid cancer, is closely linked to the increased ROS production by NOX4. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a common autoimmune thyroid disease in women, becomes conspicuous when iodide intake increases. This phenomenon may be explained by the abnormality of iodide-induced $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or other ROS in susceptible individuals. Discovery of DUOX proteins and NOX4 provides us with valuable tools for a better understanding of pathophysiology of prevalent thyroid diseases.

### Introduction

Hydrogen peroxide ($\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$) is essential for thyroid peroxidase (TPO)-catalyzed thyroid hormone formation. The ability of the thyroid to generate $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ was reported in 1971. ${}^{1,2}$ Björkman *et al.* ${}^{3,4}$ demonstrated that $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the thyroid gland was produced by NADPH oxidase located at the apical plasma membrane. Virion *et al.* ${}^{5}$ proposed that $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ generation by the thyroid NADPH oxidase does not involve the intermediate superoxide ($\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$) as an electron acceptor. NADPH oxidase-mediated $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ generation in the thyroid gland requires $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to be fully active. ${}^{6-9}$ This enzyme system has a membrane-bound flavoprotein using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a co-factor. ${}^{10,11}$ In 1999, Dupuy *et al.* ${}^{12}$ first reported the cloning of the pig and human p138${}^{\text {Tox }}$ flavoproteins consisting of 1207 (porcine) and 1210 (human) amino acids. In 2000, De Deken *et al.* cloned the entire two human thyroid cDNAs encoding new NADPH oxidase members by screening cDNA libraries using a probe of gp91${}^{\text {phox }}$/NOX2, a well-defined NADPH

oxidase in phagocytes. The two genes were initially called thyroid oxidase (THOX) 1 and 2. THOX 2 turned out to be the full-length version of p138${}^{\text {Tox }}$ flavoprotein. ${}^{13}$ Now, these two oxidases are named as DUOX1 and DUOX2. The name of DUOX (DUal OXidase) is derived from the protein structure analysis of NADPH oxidase family of *Caenorhabditis elegans*. ${}^{14}$ Thyroid diseases derived from the DUOX system have not been well recognized with the exception of the congenital hypothyroidism due to mutations in the DUOX2 gene. ${}^{15-21}$ Weyemi *et al.* ${}^{22}$ recently reported a new intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating system (NADPH oxidase 4 [NOX4]) in the human thyroid gland.

the apical membrane. Iodide is rapidly oxidized by TPO in the presence of H₂O₂ resulting in covalent binding to the tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin (Tg) on the luminal side of the apical membrane. This step produces monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Then only properly spaced MIT and DIT in Tg participate in the coupling reactions to form thyroxine (T₄) and triiodothyronine (T₃); this reaction is also catalyzed by TPO with H₂O₂. The source of thyroid H₂O₂ is DUOX2 expressed in the apical plasma membrane coordinated with DUOXA2. Thyroid hormones are released into the circulation after digestion of Tg. MIT and DIT are deiodinated by an iodotyrosine dehalogenase 1 (DEHAL1).²³ Thyroid hormone formation is predominantly regulated by thyrotropin (TSH). The binding of TSH to the TSH receptor activates both Gs and Gq proteins. The former activates the growth regulation, differentiation and thyroid hormone secretion, whereas the latter activates H₂O₂ generation and iodide binding to protein through the phospholipase C-dependent inositol phosphate Ca²⁺/diacylglycerol pathway.²⁴

## DUOX genes and proteins

### DUOXs' structure

Human Duox1 and Duox2 genes are located 16 kb apart on the chromosome 15q15.3. These genes have opposite transcriptional orientations.²⁵ The Duox1 gene spans 36 kb and contains 35 exons; the first two exons are non-coding. The Duox2 gene spans about 22 kb composed of 34 exons, and the first exon is non-coding.¹²,¹³ Human DUOX1 and DUOX2 proteins have 1551 amino acids and 1548 amino acids, respectively, for open reading frame. DUOX1 and DUOX2 show 83% similarity in their DNA sequences.¹³

However, the DUOX1 and DUOX2 promoters are different. The human DUOX1 promoter has GC-rich three putative SP1-binding sites. The human DUOX2 promoter has neither a TATA box nor an SP1-binding element.¹⁶ The DUOXs are glycoproteins containing seven transmembrane helices, an extracellular peroxidase-like domain, a long intracellular loop with two EF-hand motifs and a NOX2-like domain starting from around the second transmembrane helix to the C-terminal, in which two critical binding cavities for FAD and NADPH are present (Figure 2).¹²,¹³ The peroxidase-like domain has 43% similarity to TPO. Whether the peroxidase-like domain in humans exhibits peroxidase activity is controversial. Both detection of peroxidase activity¹⁴,²⁶ and absence of peroxidase activity²⁷ have been reported. The DUOX proteins have two EF-hands, calcium-binding sites on the first intracellular loop, suggesting an important regulatory role of Ca²⁺ for the DUOX molecule. Indeed, an enhanced H₂O₂ generation by Ca²⁺ has been shown from the DUOX2 in transfection experiments.²⁸⁻³⁰ Rigutto et al.³⁰ also confirmed a significant contribution of the EF-hands to H₂O₂ production, since the introduction of mutation to glutamate residues of EF-hands did not stimulate H₂O₂ production by ionomycin. DUOX1 and DUOX2 have 53% and 47% similarity to gp91^phox/NOX2, respectively.¹³ The NOX2-like domain of the DUOX molecule retains necessary structures and functions of phagocyte NOX2 for electron transfer from NADPH to FAD, heme and extracellular molecular oxygen.³¹,³²

### Tissue distribution of the DUOX1 and 2

In the thyroid gland, the DUOX2 mRNA expression is 1.5–5 times more abundant than that of DUOX1.²⁵ The DUOXs are located at the apical membrane of thyrocytes and

co-localized with TPO.¹³ The DUOX1 and DUOX2 expressions are not restricted to the thyroid gland.¹⁴ DUOX1 is present in the prostate, testis, placenta, heart, kidney, brain, pancreas and skin. DUOX2 is found in the salivary gland, stomach, duodenum, colon, rectum, pancreas and testis.¹⁴,³³⁻³⁵ In human airway epithelial cells, both DUOX1 and 2 are expressed.³⁴,³⁶⁻³⁸

### Requirement of DUOX activation factors for DUOX protein maturation and transition to the plasma membrane

Only fully glycosylated DUOX2 is transported to the plasma membrane and generates H₂O₂, whereas partially glycosylated DUOX2 remains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that generates O₂⁻.²⁹,³⁹⁻⁴¹ Grasberger et al.³⁹ identified the DUOX maturation factors (DUOXA1 and DUOXA2) that enable the DUOX proteins to translocate to the targeting membrane and display a full enzymatic activity of DUOXs. Only the combination of the DUOXs with their corresponding DUOXAs makes the functional unit for proper folding of DUOXs to exit the ER.⁴⁰ The DUOXA genes are located within the 16 kb intergenic region between DUOX1 and DUOX2 genes in a tail-to-tail orientation to each other. The DUOXA2 protein consists of 320 amino acids, six exons and five membrane-integral regions with an extended extracellular loop between second and third transmembrane domains, where the three N-glycosylation sites are present. The DUOXA1 gene is located adjacent to DUOXA2 and extends into the promoter region of DUOX1.³⁹ The DUOXA2 mRNA is more abundantly expressed in the thyroid gland than in the salivary gland.

The DUOXA1 mRNA is also predominantly distributed in the thyroid gland, with a lower level in the esophagus.³² The DUOXA1 is also expressed in human respiratory epithelial cells.⁴²

The DUOXA1 has four transcript variants: DUOXA1-α,-β,-γ and -∂. DUOXA1α and γ have three complete N-glycosylation sites, whereas DUOXA1-β and -∂ have only one glycosylation site that is insufficient to rescue oxidase activity.⁴³ Morand et al. examined the co-expression of DUOX1 or DUOX2 combined with DUOXA1-α, -γ or DUOXA2 in their transfection experiments into non-thyroid cells. The pairs of DUOX1-DUOXA1α and DUOX2-DUOXA2 generated H₂O₂ most effectively without producing O₂⁻ as expected. The heterogeneous pairs of DUOX1-DUOXA2 or DUOX2-DUOXA1-α and -γ are prominently expressed in the ER and produced O₂⁻; they generated lower levels H₂O₂ at plasma membrane.⁴³

### Regulation of DUOX genes' expression and their enzymatic activity

#### TSH, cAMP, thyroid-specific transcription factors

Regulation of the DUOXs' expression is clearly different from that of the other thyroid-specific proteins of NIS, Tg and TPO. The DUOX2 mRNA is expressed without TSH in FRTL-5 rat cells or porcine thyrocytes, whereas NIS mRNA expression needs TSH stimulation.⁴⁴,⁴⁵ The regulation of DUOX protein by TSH is much less than that of NIS and iodinated Tg.⁴⁶ In contrast, NOX4, another ROS-generating NADPH oxidase, is regulated by TSH.²² Similarly, forskolin did not stimulate the transcriptional activities of human DUOX1 and 2 promoters or the DUOX protein expression in human thyrocytes, while it
activated the Tg and NIS promoters and TPO protein expression.²⁵ Pachucki *et al.*²⁵ reported that a thyroid-specific enhancer was not identified in the 5′-flanking regions of both DUOX genes. Thyroid transcription factor-1 and Pax8, well-known thyroid-specific transcription factors, do not appear to control DUOX1 and 2 promoter activities in PCCL3 rat cells.⁴⁷ The lack of thyroid-specific stimulants for DUOXs is in accord with their wide tissue distribution in the human body.

### Cytokines

Cytokines can regulate the thyroid DUOXs’ expression.⁴⁸,⁴⁹ Th1-dominant cytokines (interleukin α [IL-1α] and interferon γ [IFN-γ]) and Th3-dominant cytokines (transforming growth factor β [TGF-β] and IL-10) decrease DUOX mRNA and its protein expression in human thyrocytes and rat thyroid cells.⁴⁸,⁴⁹ Th2 cytokine, IL-4, reverses the inhibitory effects of IL-1α, IFN-γ and IL-10, but not that of TGF-β.⁴⁸ Thus, autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Th1-related Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Th2-dominant Graves’ disease, may affect DUOX-mediated H₂O₂ production. The DUOX system in the respiratory tract epithelium has different cytokine regulation; Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ, highly induces DUOX2 mRNA, whereas Th2 cytokines, IL-13 and IL-4, increase DUOX1 mRNA.⁵⁰

### Ca²⁺, protein kinase A and protein kinase C

As mentioned before, H₂O₂ generation is Ca²⁺-dependent and it is activated not only by the increased level of intracellular Ca²⁺ but also by the phospholipase C-Ca²⁺ pathway.⁸,⁵¹,⁵² Recently, Rigutto *et al.* described the differential regulation of DUOX1 and DUOX2 on H₂O₂ generation in transfected Cos-7 cells. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) stimulated DUOX1, and protein kinase C (PKC) activated DUOX2 based on the phosphorylation of the respective DUOX proteins.³⁰ They also confirmed the above findings in human thyrocytes. Therefore, even though the main H₂O₂ producing machinery of DUOX2 fails, DUOX1-mediated H₂O₂ production may partially compensate as long as a cAMP signal prevails.³⁰

### Iodide

Iodide controls H₂O₂ generation in thyroid cells. Morand *et al.* have studied the effect of KI on H₂O₂ generation in porcine thyroid follicles, the most physiological thyroid culture system. They exposed follicles to 1 μmol/L KI for two days under cAMP stimulation and showed reduction in H₂O₂ production without affecting DUOX mRNA levels. Post-transcriptional change of the DUOX molecule by KI appears to be responsible for the decreased H₂O₂ generation.⁵³

## Hypothyroidism with DUOX2 and DUOXA2 gene mutation

Congenital hypothyroidism is the most common congenital endocrine disorder. The worldwide incidence is one in 4000 neonates. The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is thyroid dysgenesis (80–85%). Approximately 15–20% of infants with congenital hypothyroidism have goitrous hypothyroidism, suggesting dyshormonogenesis.⁵⁴ This disorder is caused by abnormalities of the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor, Gs protein, NIS, pendrin, TPO, Tg, PDS or DEHAL1.⁵⁵ Before the discovery of DUOXs and DUOXAs, there were two cases that might have been caused by abnormal H₂O₂ supply.⁵⁶,⁵⁷ Now, cases of hypothyroidism due to DUOX2 or DUOXA2 mutation have been identified¹⁵⁻²¹,⁴¹ (Tables 1 and 2).

Moreno *et al.*¹⁵ reported the first four cases of DUOX2 mutation in 2002. Twenty-two patients with DUOX2 mutation have been reported.¹⁵⁻²¹ Table 1 summarizes all reported cases of DUOX2 mutation and the clinical findings. There are 20 mutations in the DUOX2 gene: eight mutations in the extracellular peroxidase-like domain, 11 mutations in the first long intracellular loop and one mutation in the second intracellular loop (Figure 2). The types of mutation include missense mutation (*n* = 8), nonsense mutation (*n* = 6), frame shift (*n* = 5) and splice-site mutation (*n* = 1). Most cases were detected by the neonatal screening test for hypothyroidism, since both biallelic and monoallelic mutations resulted in hypothyroidism. Although all cases required thyroxine treatment initially, some of them were able to discontinue thyroxine treatment. According to Moreno *et al.*,¹⁵ biallelic mutations lead to permanent hypothyroidism, whereas monoallelic mutations result in transient hypothyroidism. However, Maruo *et al.*²¹ reported a transient hypothyroid case, despite biallelic mutations causing truncated DUOX2 protein. This report suggests the existence of an alternative mechanism to produce H₂O₂ when DUOX2 loses its function. The likely candidate is either DUOX1 or NOX4, since both molecules can be activated by TSH-PKA.²²,³⁰ However, intact DUOX1 did not appear to function for the patient with biallelic mutation of DUOX2 reported by Moreno *et al.*,¹⁵ and NOX4 is not localized on the apical membrane.²² The alternative H₂O₂ generating system for DUOX2-DUOXA2 is still unclear.

The clinical phenotype of DUOX2 gene mutation may vary even though patients have the identical DUOX2 mutation as Vigone *et al.*¹⁶ reported in two siblings. Their first sibling case had severe hypothyroidism and goiter, and his brother had mild hypothyroidism without goiter. The authors explained that the iodine supply could modify their phenotype. Also, our cases with the identical heterozygous mutation showed various phenotypes.²⁰ Thus, environmental factors including iodine intake may be responsible for variable phenotype expressions in this disorder.

The diagnosis of DUOX2 mutation is mainly based on the neonatal screening of thyroid function. Adult cases of DUOX2 mutation are difficult to diagnose unless physicians are aware of characteristics of dyshormonogenic goiter (marshmallow-like softness and enlarging goiter with age). Thyroid function tests vary from euthyroidism to hypothyroidism. To confirm iodide organization defect, a perchlorate discharge test has to be performed. This test is to demonstrate amount of radioactive iodine released from the thyroid gland after the administration of oral perchlorate. Radioactive iodine that does not bind to Tg (iodide organization defect) is released by perchlorate. The final

TSH, thyrotropin; TPO, thyroid peroxidase

diagnosis can be made by analyzing gene mutation. Thyroxine treatment should be started in the neonatal period and continued for the first several years to enhance normal development. It is necessary to confirm whether the hypothyroidism is permanent or transient after several years of thyroxine treatment. Even though thyroxine treatment is withheld for transient hypothyroidism, thyroid function has to be periodically examined.

Grasberger et al.⁴⁰ carried out the functional study of DUOX2 mutants in Cos-7 cells. They analyzed the following three missense mutations of the peroxidase-like domain (Q36H, R376W and D506N). The Q36H and R376W mutations completely abolished the transition of DUOX from the ER to the plasma membrane. Also, the D506N mutant reduced its plasma membrane translocation. These DUOX2 mutants were retained within the ER. They concluded that post-transitional processing of the peroxidase-like domain plays a crucial role for the ER exit of DUOX2. The mutation site at the R1110Q reported by Ohye et al.²⁰ corresponds to the highly conserved arginine residues of R80 in the NOX2, an NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. Interestingly, R80E mutation resulted in complete abolishment of ROS production in the NOX2 molecule because of failure to form a heterodimer with integral membrane protein p22phox, a docking site for the regulatory proteins.³¹ It is speculated that the R1110 has a function similar to the R80 of NOX2.

Zamproni et al.⁴¹ first described a patient with mild congenital hypothyroidism due to the homozygous nonsense mutation (Y246X) in the DUOXA2. The patient had a goiter with a partial iodide organification defect. The clinical features are summarized in Table 2. The mutation is located at the second extracellular loop (Figure 3) and produces a truncated DUOXA2 protein lacking the fifth transmembrane domain and C-terminal. The transfection of the Y246X mutant into HeLa cells failed the translocation of DUOX2 to the cell surface with no detectable H₂O₂. Also, DUOXA1 could not substitute for abnormal DUOXA2 in their cross-functioning study.⁴¹

ROS-mediated thyroid diseases

Thyroid cancer

Lacroix et al. examined DUOX1 and DUOX2 mRNA levels from thyroid cancer tissues and normal thyroid tissues obtained from patients, whose thyroid function tests were normal at the time of surgery. Thyroid cancer tissues

Figure 3 Structural model of DUOXA2 protein and mutation site. A small closed circle indicates the location of mutation and changes in amino acid
displayed a wide variation of DUOX1 and DUOX2 mRNA levels. The mean DUOX1 and DUOX2 mRNA levels of cancer tissues did not differ from those of normal thyroid tissues. They also examined the DUOX1 and DUOX2 protein expression by immunostaining. The variable levels of DUOX protein expression were seen in thyroid cancer tissues.⁵⁸ Also, abolished or decreased H₂O₂ generation was detected in some of the thyroid carcinoma tissues by others.⁵⁹ The discrepancy between DUOX expression levels and H₂O₂ generation seen in some cancer tissues is probably caused by different localizations of the DUOX protein either in the apical membrane or in the cytoplasm.⁵⁸,⁶⁰,⁶¹ One interesting aspect is that the majority of cancer tissues exhibited normal or slightly increased DUOX protein expressions while NIS, TPO and PDS protein expressions were profoundly decreased or absent.⁵⁸

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid cancer, and radiation is the only proven cause. There is a growing speculation that H₂O₂ can be the cause of sporadic PTC.⁶² Detours *et al.*⁶² found that Chernobyl Tissue Bank (PTC after radiation exposure) and French sporadic PTC (no radiation exposure) had similar overall gene expression profiles, RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutation rates. Also, transcriptional responses of human lymphocytes to 200 μmol/L H₂O₂ and 2.5 Gy radiation had a significant similarity. Therefore, sporadic PTC and radiation-induced PTC appear to be the same disease category, although they are distinguishable with molecular signatures. Maintenance of normal or slightly increased thyroid DUOX protein expression in thyroid cancer,⁵⁸ long-term H₂O₂ exposure due to 8.5 years’ life span of thyroid cells,⁶³ membrane permeable nature of H₂O₂ and decreased TPO expression in cancer tissues (less utilization of H₂O₂) should partly explain the accumulated DNA damage by H₂O₂ and its possible contribution to the development of PTC. In addition, Weyemi *et al.*²² recently provided convincing evidence of activation of intracellular ROS by NOX4 in human PTC tissues. Furthermore, the same authors described activation of p22phox, an active partner of NOX4, by H-Ras oncogene in cultured human thyrocytes.⁶⁴

### Hashimoto’s thyroiditis

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a common thyroid disease for women and involves genetic, immunological and environmental factors for its development. The most important environmental factor is iodine. A survey in China showed an increased prevalence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and hypothyroidism with excessive iodine intake.⁶⁵ A key question is: how does increased iodide ingestion contribute to the development of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. One of the important aspects of iodide, besides thyroid hormone formation, is the Wolff–Chaikoff effect in the thyroid gland. This protects thyrocytes from acute iodide overload by inhibiting iodide organification and by discharging iodide recently transported into the thyroid gland. Therefore, administration of a large amount of iodide is a standard procedure to prevent ¹³¹I-iodine accumulation in the thyroid gland from nuclear accidents. The Wolff–Chaikoff

effect is caused by iodide-mediated inhibition of H₂O₂ generation.⁵¹ The study of NOD.H2h4 mouse, an animal model of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, provides us with insight into the understanding of iodide handling in susceptible host.⁶⁶,⁶⁷ Exposure of NOD.H2h4 thyroid cells to 100 μmol/L iodide (more than 100-fold higher iodide concentration than physiological dose) increased extracellular H₂O₂ production that subsequently activated intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression. Constitutive expression of ICAM-1 in the thyroid cell of NOD.H2h4 mouse and ICAM-1 activation by H₂O₂ results in the retention of circulating lymphocytes and subsequent cytokine release favoring the development of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.⁶⁶ The high level of H₂O₂ also produces the antigenic antigen from oxidation damaged iodinated Tg.⁶⁸ Antioxidants blocked the generation of ROS and ICAM-1 expression. In a non-susceptible mouse, 100 μmol/L iodide did not generate H₂O₂.⁶⁶,⁶⁷ The animal experiments suggest that susceptible hosts have defective Wolff–Chaikoff effect allowing them to generate H₂O₂ in response to increased iodide influx, which ordinarily should not happen as seen in the non-susceptible mouse.⁶⁷ Thus, abnormality of thyroid H₂O₂ generation in response to high iodide may play a role in the development of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis in susceptible individuals. Whether iodide-mediated H₂O₂ generation is driven by activated DUOX or NOX4 or defective antioxidants has yet to be studied.

#### Multinodular goiter or hypofunctioning adenoma

The levels of mRNA expression of the DUOXs are highly variable; no statistical difference was noted between nodular tissues and normal tissues. The DUOXs’ protein expressions in multinodular goiter and hypofunctioning adenoma are also highly variable from one follicle to the other.³⁵,⁶⁰ However, Caillou *et al.*³⁵ found a higher number of positive DUOX cells in hypofunctioning follicular adenoma than in hyperfunctioning tissue. This finding suggests that DUOX protein expression does not always correlate with the functional state of thyroid tissue. The other common feature was weak staining in macrofollicular area and flattened cells, whereas strong staining is seen in the microfollicular area and cuboidal cells, an index of active thyroid cells.³⁵ This trend is also found in normal thyroid tissue.⁶⁹ NOX4 immunostaining was also found in the cytoplasm in multinodular thyroid tissue.²² However, the possible contribution of DUOX or NOX4 proteins to the development of multinodular goiter or adenoma deserves further investigation.

#### Hyperthyroidism

In hyperfunctioning thyroid tissue, there are increased iodinated Tg, NIS and TPO protein expressions with slightly increased PDS expression contributing to excess thyroid hormone production.⁶⁰,⁶¹ However, the DUOXs’ expression is variable. The DUOXs’ mRNA expression was relatively low in thyroid tissues of Graves’ disease and varied widely in toxic adenoma when compared with that of normal tissue. In the immunostaining, only 0–10% offollicular cells was positive for DUOX protein in the hyperfunctioning thyroid.³⁵ Other investigators described slightly increased DUOXs' protein levels in hyperfunctioning thyroid tissues.⁶⁰ One potential explanation for these variable expression levels is the effect of the treatment with anti-thyroid drugs before surgery. Methimazole and propylthiouracil inhibit NADPH oxidase activity.⁷⁰ Some of the hyperfunctioning nodules did not express DUOXs' protein after anti-thyroid drug treatment.⁶⁰ Interestingly, an impairment of iodide organification in hyperactive portions of the thyroid has been reported.⁷¹,⁷² Roti *et al.*⁷¹ reported that 69% of the 29 patients with untreated Graves’ disease showed a positive perchlorate discharge test, and this abnormality was corrected with the anti-thyroid drug treatment for more than 50% patients. Thyroid-stimulating antibody found in patients with Graves’ disease does not appear to stimulate H₂O₂ generation.⁷³ Moreno-Reyes *et al.*⁷² also described a positive perchlorate discharge test in 61% of 46 patients with autonomous thyroid nodules. H₂O₂ generation in autonomous thyroid nodules is lower than in the corresponding normal thyroid tissue.⁷⁴ Taken together, an impaired iodide organification due to low H₂O₂ generation can possibly happen in some patients with untreated hyperfunctioning thyroid. The involvement of other members of NOX family has to be investigated to establish the H₂O₂ generation status in hyperthyroid thyroid glands.

## Conclusions

The DUOX2-DUOXA2 system has been known as the extracellular source of H₂O₂ in the thyroid gland. Now, NOX4 is a newly added source of intracellular ROS in the thyroid gland.²² Mutation of either DUOX2 or DUOXA2 causes hypothyroidism due to insufficient H₂O₂ generation. We have summarized clinical and molecular aspects of all DUOX2 and DUOXA2 mutations from patients so far reported (Tables 1 and 2, Figures 2 and 3). Thyroid cells may accumulate oxidative damage due to constant exposure to H₂O₂ and other ROS. The imbalance between ROS production and its degradation systems⁷⁴ may create an oxidant dominant state causing sporadic PTC²²,⁶² or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.⁶⁶,⁶⁷ Our present review suggests that the thyroid H₂O₂ generating systems might be involved, not only in the hypothyroidism caused by DUOX defects but also in some other common thyroid diseases.
