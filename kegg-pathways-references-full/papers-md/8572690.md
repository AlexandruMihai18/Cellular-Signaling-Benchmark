The degradation of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), pyrene (PYR), benz[a]anthracene (BAA), and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 was studied. The bacterium was isolated from an abandoned coal gasification site soil by analog enrichment techniques and found to mineralize \[^{14}C\]PYR. Further degradation studies with PYR showed three metabolites formed by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135, including 4,5-phenanthrene-dicarboxylic acid not previously isolated, 4-phenanthrene-carboxylic acid, and 4,5-pyrene-dihydrodiol. At least two dihydrodiols, 5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol and 10,11-BAA-dihydrodiol, were confirmed by high-resolution mass spectral and fluorescence analyses as products of the biodegradation of BAA by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135. Additionally, a cleavage product of BAA was also isolated. Mass spectra and fluorescence data support two different routes for the degradation of BaP by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135. The 7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol and three cleavage products of BaP, including 4,5-chrysene-dicarboxylic acid and a dihydro-pyrene-carboxylic acid metabolite, have been isolated and identified as degradation products formed by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135. These latter results represent the first example of the isolation of BaP ring fission products formed by a bacterial isolate. We propose that while this bacterium appears to attack only one site of the PYR molecule, it is capable of degrading different sites of the BAA and BaP molecules, and although the sites of attack may be different, the ability of this bacterium to degrade these PAH is well supported. The proposed pathways for biodegradation of these compounds by this *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 support the dioxygenase enzymatic processes reported previously for other bacteria. Microorganisms like *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 will be invaluable in attaining the goal of remediation of sites containing mixtures of these PAH.

The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in contaminated soils continues to pose significant problems. Levels of these compounds vary from 5 ppb for an undeveloped area of Alaska to \(1.79 \times 10^6\) ppb for an oil refinery outfall in Southampton, England (12). Their hydrophobicity is cited as the primary reason for their persistence in soils and sediments. This is especially true for larger PAH such as pyrene (PYR), benz[a]anthracene (BAA), and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), which have very low water solubilities (0.140 mg of PYR liter\(^{-1}\); 0.002 mg of BAA liter\(^{-1}\); 0.003 mg of BaP liter\(^{-1}\)) (19). Their prevalence in contaminated soil at hazardous waste sites are 1,808 ppb for PYR, 2,320 ppb for BAA, and 3,101 ppb for BaP compared with 1 to 19.7 ppb for PYR, 5 to 20 ppb for BAA, and 2 to 1,300 ppb for BaP in rural soils (19). While PYR is not considered a carcinogen, it is prevalent in contaminated soils (71% of sites tested) (19) and is mutagenic as determined by the Ames assay (9). Both BaP and BAA are commonly found in contaminated soils (47% sites contain BaP, and 41% contain BAA) (19), and BaP is considered a potent carcinogen, while BAA is considered a moderate to weak carcinogen (10).

Of the processes whereby these contaminants such as PYR, BAA, and BaP are removed from the environment, microbial degradation plays a major role in the decontamination of sediment and surface soils (17). With the aim of remediation and removal of these compounds from the environment, it is essential to understand the pathways of degradation for those compounds which are found at these sites. While two- to three-ring PAH degradation by microorganisms is well understood and documented (see reference 4 for a review), the microbial biodegradation of the larger-ring PAH has not been studied extensively. Of the three molecules PYR, BAA, and BaP degradation has been studied to the greatest extent, and the degradation of four-ring compounds such as PYR and fluoranthene is well documented (3, 4, 7, 8, 13).

While BaP degradation has been reported (5), only the cis-9,10-BaP-dihydrodiol and 7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol formed by *Beijerinckia* sp. (5) have been identified as intermediates; no ring cleavage products have been isolated. Isolated intermediates of BAA degradation by *Beijerinckia* sp. strain B1 have included three dihydrodiols, namely, cis-1,2-BAA-dihydrodiol, cis-8,9-BAA-dihydrodiol, and cis-10,11-BAA-dihydrodiol (5, 11), as well as ring cleavage products 1-hydroxy-2-anthracene-carboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy-3-phenanthrene-carboxylic acid, and 3-hydroxy-2-phenanthrene-carboxylic acid (15). As part of our overall aim to enhance microbial biodegradation of PAH, we present proposed pathways of PYR, BAA, and BaP degradation by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 which include the formation of dihydrodiols and ring fission intermediates.

the organic-extractable residue, and the other metabolites accounted for >48% of the radioactivity at 32 days, clearly demonstrating degradation of BAA by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135.

BAA metabolite identification. To accurately identify the degradation products of BAA, *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 was incubated with nonradiolabeled BAA for 2 weeks. This time point appeared to be optimal for obtaining sufficient quantities of all metabolites. Organic extracts of growth medium were injected onto the HPLC and analyzed by mass spectral and fluorescence analyses.

HPLC peak BAA-II, at 26.4 min, cochromatographed with the standard cis-5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol. Trimethylsilylated metabolite BAA-II gave a M⁺ ion at m/z 406 with an elemental composition of C₂₄H₃₀O₂Si₂ and fragment ions at m/z 334 with an elemental analysis of C₂₁H₂₂O₂Si (M⁺ - 72, C₃H₈Si loss) and at m/z 316 with an elemental analysis of C₂₁H₂₀OSi (M⁺ - 90, C₃H₁₀OSi loss) (Table 3). The mass spectral data of trimethylsilylated metabolite BAA-II are consistent with trimethylsilylation of standard cis-5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol. Additionally, the fluorescence spectra of metabolite BAA-II are coincident with the fluorescence spectra of authentic standard cis-5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol (Fig. 1A). On the basis of these data, metabolite BAA-II is assigned the structure cis-5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol.

Metabolite PYR-III at an HPLC retention time of 21.1 min was the PYR major metabolite produced by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135. This metabolite had a M⁺ ion at m/z 236 with an elemental analysis of C₁₆H₁₂O₂, a base peak of 218, and an elemental analysis of C₁₆H₁₀O (M⁺ - 18, H₂O loss) and fragment ions at m/z 202 with an elemental analysis of C₁₆H₁₀ (M⁺ - 34, two OH loss) and at m/z 189 with an elemental analysis of C₁₅H₉ (M⁺ - 47, COH and H₂O loss) (Table 1). Fluorescence spectra of this metabolite shows a phenanthrene structure indicating that either aromatic ring two or four of PYR is saturated, which would be consistent with a pyrene-dihydrodiol structure. On the basis of mass spectral and fluorescence data, metabolite PYR-III is identified as 4,5-pyrene-dihydrodiol, which is consistent with the assigned structure reported by Heitkamp et al. for *Mycobacterium* sp. strain PYR-1 (8).

Kinetics of BAA degradation and metabolite formation. Studies with *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 and \[^{12}\]-\[^{14}C\]BAA showed the formation of at least five metabolites, designated BAA-I, BAA-II, BAA-III, BAA-IV, and BAA-V, with retention times of 24, 26.4, 28.2, 31, and 34 min, respectively (undegraded BAA retention time, 40 min). The degradation of \[^{14}C\]BAA was concomitant with the increase in these metabolites over 32 days (Table 2). Sterile controls showed no degradation. The degradation by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 was fairly rapid since metabolite BAA-V, with an HPLC retention time of 35 min, was present at 11% after only 1 day. Following 8 days of incubation, only ~36% of the original \[^{14}C\]BAA remained, while metabolite BAA-V had increased to ~30%. Undegraded BAA accounted for 11% of

HPLC retention time of 31 to 32 min gave a M⁺ at m/z 246.0681 with an elemental analysis of C₁₇H₁₀O₂. While a structure has not been assigned to this metabolite, it represents a ring cleavage intermediate of BAA formed by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135.

Kinetics of BaP degradation and metabolite formation. Studies of Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135 with [¹⁴C]BaP showed the formation of at least six metabolites, designated BaP-I, BaP-II, BaP-III, BaP-IV, BaP-V, and BaP-VI, with retention times of 14, 16, 30, 33, 35, and 36 min, respectively (BaP retention time, 42 min). The kinetics of BaP degradation and metabolite formation by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135 was much slower than that seen for PYR or BAA degradation (Table 4). After 32 days, undegraded [¹⁴C]BaP accounted for ~60% of the organic-extractable residue; sterile controls showed no degradation. Similarly, the formation of the metabolites increased slowly from 0 to ~9% over 32 days for metabolites III and V, from 0 to ~6% for metabolite VI, and from 0 to ~2% for metabolite BaP-IV.

BaP metabolite identification. To accurately determine the BaP degradation pathway and metabolite identification, Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135 was incubated with nonradio-labeled BaP for 2 weeks. The organic extracts of the growth medium were separated by HPLC and analyzed by mass spectral and fluorescence analyses. Four metabolites, designated BaP-I, BaP-II, BaP-III, and BaP-IV, were identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy.

Metabolite BaP-I, with an HPLC retention time of 14 min, was methylated and gave a M⁺ at m/z 344 and an elemental analysis of C₂₂H₁₆O₄, a base peak at m/z 285 with an elemental analysis of C₂₀H₁₃O₂ (M⁺ - 59, CO₂CH₃ loss), and a fragment ion at m/z 270 with an elemental analysis of C₁₉H₁₀O₂ (M⁺ - 74, CH₃ and CO₂CH₃ loss) (Table 5). These data indicate that methylation occurred at a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group rather than two carboxyl groups. Methylation of the latter would yield a fragment ion showing a loss of two methyl carboxylate groups (M⁺ - 118), which was not shown in the mass spectra. The methylation of both carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in similar compounds, with diazomethane, has

been reported (2). The fluorescence spectra of the nonmethylated fraction indicate that metabolite BaP-I has a PYR structure with wavelength maxima at 235, 261, 275, 336, 365, 373, 396, and 425 nm, which closely match those of a PYR standard. These high-resolution mass spectral and fluorescence spectral analyses are consistent with a PYR derivative. We cannot, however, distinguish between the meta fission products through the 7,8 bond or the 9,10 bond of BaP. In the former case, the structural assignment would be consistent with cis-4-(7-hydroxypyren-8-yl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid; for the latter, it would be the cis-4-(8-hydroxypyren-7-yl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid. A fission product through the 8,9 bond of BaP would not form a compound which could produce this mass spectra; hence, this possibility can be ruled out.

a chrysene structure with wavelength maxima of 256, 362, 380, 404, and 428 nm, which are similar to those of an authentic chrysene standard. The mass spectral analysis and fluorescence spectra are consistent with a chrysene dicarboxylic acid derivative, indicating an *ortho* fission product through the 4,5 bond in BaP. Therefore, metabolite BaP-II is assigned the structure of 4,5-chrysene-dicarboxylic acid.

Metabolite BaP-III, which eluted at 30 min on the HPLC, was the major BaP metabolite formed by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135. This metabolite gave a M⁺ at m/z 286 with an elemental analysis of C₂₀H₁₄O₂, a base peak at m/z 268 with an elemental analysis of C₂₀H₁₂O (M⁺ – 18, H₂O loss), a fragment ion at m/z 252 with an elemental analysis of C₂₀H₁₂ (M⁺ – 34, two OH loss), and a fragment ion at m/z 239 with an elemental analysis of C₁₉H₁₁ (M⁺ – 47, COH and H₂O loss). The molecular ion, elemental compositions, and fragment ions are consistent with standard dihydrodiols of BaP. In addition, the HPLC retention time and fluorescence spectra of metabolite BaP-III closely matched those of the authentic standard *cis*-7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol (Fig. 2A). Hence, metabolite BaP-III is assigned the structure *cis*-7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol. Since an authentic 8,9-BaP-dihydrodiol standard is not available for comparison, it is possible that metabolite BaP-III may be the 8,9-dihydrodiol or a mixture of both dihydrodiols.

Metabolite BaP-IV, which eluted at 33 min on the HPLC, was methylated prior to mass spectral analysis. The high-resolution mass spectra of the derivatized metabolite gave a M⁺ at m/z 262 with an elemental analysis of C₁₈H₁₄O₂ and fragment ions at m/z 247 with an elemental analysis of C₁₇H₁₁O₂ (M⁺ – 15, CH₃ loss) and at m/z 202 with an elemental analysis of C₁₆H₁₀ representing loss of methyl carboxylate (Table 5). The fluorescence spectra of the nonmethylated metabolite BaP-IV is consistent with a PYR structure (Fig. 2B). The shift in fluorescence peak maxima between BaP-IV and PYR is consistent with differences reported between parent compounds and derivatives with aromatic ring saturation and/or substitution (16). The molecular ion, elemental analysis, fragmentation pattern, and fluorescence spectra are consistent with a methylester of dihydro-pyrene-carboxylic acid. As we have indicated for metabolite BaP-I, based on fission of the 7,8-bond and/or the 9,10-bond of BaP, we cannot distinguish

between the 7,8-dihydro-pyrene-7-carboxylic acid and 7,8-dihydro-pyrene-8-carboxylic acid structures for this metabolite.

### DISCUSSION

We have shown that *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 is capable of mineralizing [¹⁴C]PYR to ~50% while producing at least three stable intermediates within a short (4- to 8-h) period of time. These intermediates include the previously reported 4-phenanthrene-carboxylic acid and 4,5-pyrene-dihydrodiol produced by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain PYR-1 (8) and 4,5-phenanthrene-dicarboxylic acid, which had been proposed but not previously isolated from strain PYR-1 (4). The pathway for degradation of PYR by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 is consistent with that reported for *Mycobacterium* sp. strain PYR-1 (4, 8), which would be expected from members of the same genus.

The formation of at least two different dihydrodiols of BAA by *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 as seen in the proposed pathway (Fig. 3) is similar to previous reports (5, 11, 15) for *Beijerinckia* sp. strain B1, although the 1,2-BAA-dihydrodiol formed preferentially by the *Beijerinckia* sp. was not found in the *Mycobacterium* sp. Unlike the *Beijerinckia* sp., *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 forms 5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol as the predominant metabolite and, secondarily, 10,11-BAA-dihydrodiol. Additionally, the ring cleavage product BAA-IV suggests that this bacterium is capable of cleaving at least one ring of the BAA molecule. The formation of dihydrodiols is consistent with the dioxygenase enzyme pathways proposed for the degradation of other PAH (4), although isolation and identification of the enzymes involved in degradation by this *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 are under investigation.

Before this report, the identified intermediates of microbial BaP degradation were *cis*-9,10-BaP-dihydrodiol and 7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol formed by *Beijerinckia* sp. strain B1 (5). The identification of 7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol formed by this *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 is consistent with those findings. Similarly, we propose that this metabolite is most likely the *cis* isomer. This report of the isolation of three-ring cleavage products of BaP degradation formed from *Mycobacterium* sp. strain RJGII-135 (Fig. 4) is unique. The two pathways for attack of the BaP

data). With a better understanding of the degradation process of PAH by bacteria, strategies will be developed for the removal and containment of carcinogenic PAH from contaminated ecosystems and the reduction of health risks associated with exposure to PAH.
