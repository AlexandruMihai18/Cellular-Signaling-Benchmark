Cell polarity is an essential requirement for the proper tissue development of complex organisms. This is underscored by *in vivo* studies showing that loss of cell polarity contributes to the formation and progression of tumours. Evolutionary conserved multi-protein complexes, such as the Par3–Par6–aPKC or, in short, the Par polarity complex, regulate the establishment of cell polarity. The small Rho GTPases CDC42 and Rac control the activation of the Par polarity complex. Evidence now implicates the Rac activator Tiam1 as a crucial component of the Par complex in regulating neuronal (axonal) and epithelial (apical-basal) polarity. Our current knowledge places Tiam1 at the centre of a pivotal biological process, the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, and suggests that deregulation of the Tiam1-Par complex contributes to tumourigenicity.

### Introduction

Three conserved protein complexes that control cell polarity have been identified, the Crumbs-Patj-Pals, Scribble-Lgl-Dlg and Par3-Par6-aPKC complexes. Although the Crumbs complex is restricted to epithelial cells, the Scribble and Par complexes control cell polarity in a broader context and are conserved from yeast to man. Polarity complexes function through the arrangement of ‘positional landmarks’ on the plasma membrane, which are expanded by the targeting of specific proteins to these sites. Of these, the Par polarity complex, which consists of a core of partition defective 3 (Par3), Par6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKCλ or aPKCζ), controls many aspects of cell polarity. These include asymmetric cell division, axon specification and synaptogenesis, the polarized migration of astrocytes and the establishment of apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells (reviewed in [1–4]) (Figure 1). The establishment of cell polarity requires interplay between signalling by polarity proteins and the coordinated regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Rho-GTPases and their effectors are key regulators of actin and microtubule dynamics and, consequently, are crucially involved in polarity signaling. The Par polarity complex is of particular interest because its activation by Rho-GTPases is the primary cue for the initiation of polarity signalling.

It is suggested that Par3 has a role in localizing Par6 and aPKC to their site of activation [5]. Par6 is constitutively associated with aPKCs and couples the activation of the Rho-GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 to the activation of aPKCs [6–9]. GTP-bound (activated) Cdc42 or Rac1 bind the semi-CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) motif and the adjacent PDZ domain of Par6, which is thought to relieve the inhibitory effect of Par6 on aPKC activity [10,11]. Atypical PKCs are the main effectors of the polarity complex that controls cellular polarization through a mostly unknown downstream signalling cascade [7].

Early studies indicated that Cdc42 provides the primary cue to initiate cell polarity in many cellular systems (reviewed in [12]). Recent reports now show that Rac1 and its specific activator Tiam1 initiate epithelial polarity independently of Cdc42 [13,14]. Tiam1 is a typical member of the Dbl-like family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and specifically activates the Rho-GTPase Rac [15,16] (Boxes 1,2). In mice, Tiam1 is highly expressed in brain, testis and epidermis and expressed at lower levels in most other tissues. Here, we summarize the most important findings from the past years, with particular focus on the role of Tiam1 in the regulation of epithelial- (apical-basal) and neuronal- (axon specification and dendritic spine formation) cell polarity. In addition, we discuss how Tiam1-mediated Rac activation in conjunction with the Par polarity complex might contribute to epithelial tumourigenicity.

#### The Par complex regulates tight junction assembly

Apical-basal polarity of mammalian epithelial cells is established and maintained through the formation of specialized intercellular junctions, the adherens junction (AJ) and the tight junction (TJ) [17,18] (Box 3). TJs function as intercellular barriers that regulate paracellular permeability by segregating the plasma membrane into two compartments, thereby generating a functional asymmetry that is required for polarization of epithelial cells [19,20]. In the past decade, advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in TJ formation, including the requirement for activation of Rho-GTPases and the involvement of the Par polarity complex. On the formation of initial intercellular contacts by classical cadherins (known as primordial adhesions), the activation of the Par polarity complex by Cdc42 and/or Rac is required for the establishment of TJs in vertebrate epithelial cells [2]. Par3, Par6 and aPKC localize to primordial TJs and regulate their maturation and positioning with respect to basolateral and apical membrane domains [6,21]. Cadherins, with or without nectins, transduce signals to activate Rac and/or Cdc42 [22,23], which in turn can result in the local activation of the Par polarity complex, further stimulating the assembly of TJs. It is currently unclear if membrane

Figure 1. The Par complex and cell polarity. The Par polarity complex consists of Par3, Par6 and atypical PKC (ζ or ι/λ). GTP-bound active Rac and Cdc42 can bind to Par6 in a mutually exclusive manner, inducing a conformational change in Par6, to ultimately activate aPKC, the key effector of the complex. In several model organisms, Cdc42 is considered to be the primary cue that locally activates the Par complex (red arrow) and induces axon specification, asymmetric cell divisions and polarized migration (a–c). Rac either has no function in polarity signalling or functions in a downstream signalling cascade of the Par complex in these processes (+Tiam1, c). Rac and Tiam1 function as direct activators (red arrow) of the Par complex in vertebrate epithelial cells (d) during the establishment of apical-basal polarity. (a) During axon specification, the Par complex is specifically activated by Cdc42 at the neurite tip that is committed to form the axon and controls the outgrowth of the axon via Tiam1-Rac signalling and cytoskeletal remodelling. (b) Members of the Par complex asymmetrically localize to the anterior pole of the dividing Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, the Drosophila oocyte and neuroblast and the site of bud growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The complex regulates the orientation of the mitotic spindle and the asymmetric distribution of developmental determinants over the daughter cells. (c) In migrating astrocytes (during wound healing), Cdc42 activates the Par complex to regulate the orientation of the microtubule organizing centre (MTOC). During polarization, Rac stimulates the formation of membrane protrusions in the direction of migration. Whether Par3 takes part in polarity signalling during directed migration is currently unclear. (d) Apical-basal polarization of vertebrate epithelial cells is established through the formation of TJs. The Par complex localizes to primordial TJs and its activity regulates the formation and positioning of TJs on the lateral plasma membrane, apical to the adherens junction. In the process of epithelial polarization Rac1 (rather than Cdc42) activates the Par-complex. The Rac activator Tiam1 interacts with Par3 and regulates axon specification and TJ formation via the Par complex.

translocation of the Par complex during TJ formation depends on GTPase activation, as suggested for several other polarization processes [24,25]. In epidermal keratinocytes, however, dominant-active mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 induce TJ formation through the activation of the Par complex [14]. Because the localization of these mutants along the plasma membrane is random, it is unlikely that Cdc42 and Rac1 function by localizing the Par complex in keratinocytes.

Tiam1 regulates TJ assembly through Par3 Although Cdc42 is the key activator of the Par complex in most polarity model systems [12], its role in Par polarity signalling in vertebrate epithelial cells is less clear. The activity of Cdc42 is dispensable for apical-basal cell polarization in epidermal keratinocytes and epithelial

MDCK cells [14,26,27]; however, there is limited evidence that Cdc42 is involved in TJ biogenesis [28]. Two independent studies recently showed that the Rac activator Tiam1 directly associates with the Par polarity complex by binding to Par3, thereby controlling TJ assembly in epithelial cells [13,14]. In epidermal keratinocytes, Tiam1-mediated activation of Rac directly regulates TJ assembly through the activation of the Par polarity complex [14]. Similar to wild-type keratinocytes, Tiam1-deficient cells form normal primordial adhesions that contain components of both AJs and TJs and are properly localized at the basolateral side of the plasma membrane. However, Tiam1-deficient cells are impaired in TJ maturation.

Box 1. Regulation of Rho protein activity

Rho family proteins, including Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA, control signalling pathways that affect the actin cytoskeleton as well as gene transcription. In particular, they regulate and coordinate the cytoskeleton remodelling in response to receptor stimulation including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and adhesion receptors such as integrins and cadherins (Figure I). Similarly to Ras proteins, Rho-like GTPases cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Exchange of GDP for GTP is catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Tiam1. When bound to GTP, the GTPases undergo a conformational change, which enables the binding of various downstream effector molecules that lead to the activation of various downstream signalling pathways. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) increase the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis and inactivate Rho GTPases and thereby abrogate Rho signalling. Inactive GDP-bound Rho GTPases bind to guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (Rho-GDIs), which retain the GTPases in the cytoplasm.

Figure I.

Rac, fully restores TJ biogenesis in Tiam1-deficient cells [14]. This suggests that Tiam1–Rac signalling activates the polarity complex and is not required for its localization at sites of primordial adhesions. Moreover, Rac is activated upon the formation of primordial adhesions in wild-type but not in Tiam1-deficient cells. Tiam1 triggers the biogenesis of the TJ through the activation of Rac and aPKCζ, independently from Cdc42 [14]. In response to cadherin clustering at primordial adhesions, Tiam1 can locally activate Rac and the polarity complex to mediate TJ formation. In a separate study using MDCK cells, depletion of Par3 led to disruption of TJ formation, which was accompanied by an elevated activation of Rac [13]. Strikingly, expression of dominant negative Rac1<sup>N17</sup> or downregulation of Tiam1 in Par3-depleted MDCK cells restores TJ formation, suggesting that Tiam1-mediated activation of Rac inhibits TJ assembly in the MDCK model system [13].

These seemingly opposing results can be explained by a function of Par3 in the recruitment of Tiam1 to sites of primordial adhesions, thereby coupling Tiam1–Rac signalling to the activation of the polarity complex [14]. Par3 depletion in the MDCK model might prevent Tiam1 localization at cell–cell contact sites and, consequently, delocalized Tiam1 could enhance the activity of Rac at alternative sites of the plasma membrane independently from Par3. At these sites, Tiam1-mediated activation of Rac can drive lamellipodia formation leading to the disruption of intercellular contacts and loss of apical-basal polarity.

Evidence for this model comes from earlier studies in MDCK cells, which showed that PI3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent Tiam1 localization to lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (in response to changes in extracellular matrix composition) led to dissociation rather than the formation of intercellular adhesions. Local PI3K activity can define the localization of Tiam1 at either the cell–cell contacts or lamellipodia [29]. Interestingly, PI3K activity is required for correct Par3 localization during neuronal cell polarization [30]. Whether PI3K has a similar function in epithelial cell polarization is currently unknown but PI3K is activated upon E-cadherin clustering in MDCK cells [31]. Taken together, these studies indicate that PI3K is a possible candidate that controls both Tiam1 activity

Box 2. Protein domains of Tiam1, its regulation and association with other proteins

In mammals, >60 activators or GEFs for Rho-GTPases have been identified, yet of many their exact functions are unknown [16]. GEFs are differentially expressed in specific cell types and their activity is strictly regulated in space and time. The GEF Tiam1 is a specific activator of the Rho-like GTPase Rac [15]. The protein is highly expressed in brain, testis and epidermis and expressed at lower levels in other tissues. A Tiam1-related protein, called Tiam2 or STEF, has been identified in mammals but its expression is mostly restricted to neuronal cells [73]. Still life (SIF) is the Drosophila homologue of Tiam1 [48]. As shown in Figure I, Tiam1 has the characteristic Dbl homology-Pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) domain combination, which is always found in activators of Rho-like GTPases. In addition, Tiam1 is myristoylated at its N terminus, contains two N-terminal PEST domains, an N-terminal Pleckstrin homology domain (PHn), a coiled-coil region with adjacent sequence (CC-ex), a Ras-binding domain (RBD) and a PDZ domain. Various domains bind to different cytoplasmic and membrane-associated proteins, which couples Tiam1-Rac activity to specific downstream signalling pathways (reviewed in [74]). Both the N- and C-terminal Pleckstrin homology domains (PHn and PHc) bind phosphoinositides that control activation and intracellular localization of the protein [35]. Moreover, Tiam1 can associate with Par3 [13,14,33], Ras [68], Rac [15] and Rap1A [75], which all have a role in cell polarity.

Box 3. Apical-basal cell polarity in epithelial cells

The establishment of apical-basal polarity in vertebrate epithelial cells is a direct consequence of proper tight junction assembly. Intercellular adhesion in epithelial cells is initiated by classical cadherins (E-, P-, N-, R- and K-cadherins) that establish homophilic interactions in the presence of Ca²⁺ ions [17]. The molecular machinery regulating the formation and maturation of intercellular contacts followed by clear morphological changes that accompany this process have been extensively studied in primary skin keratinocytes and epithelial MDCK cells (reviewed in [76]). Initially, cadherins cluster at the plasma membrane to form spot-like structures (or puncta) positioned at the end of thin actin cables that extend from the puncta towards the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton [77]. These so-called primordial adhesions contain a mixture of AJ and TJ components. These are subsequently sorted and assembled into belt-like AJs at the basolateral plasma membrane (PM) and TJs on the most apical side of the lateral PM along cortical F-actin fibres [21] (Figure 1). In vertebrate cells, the primordial adhesions mediated by cadherins are a prerequisite to assemble TJs [17]. Fully matured TJs consist of the transmembrane proteins occludin, claudins, and JAMs, which are organized in intra-membranous strands and are linked to the F-actin cytoskeleton, either directly or indirectly through members of the MAGUK family of proteins (i.e. ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3) [20].

cells [32]. Although endogenous Par3 exclusively localizes to TJs in MDCK cells, overexpression of exogenous Par3 causes delocalization of Par3 all along the plasma membrane. Analogous to the results obtained by depletion of Par3, MDCK cells overexpressing Par3 lose their intercellular contacts and adopt a mesenchymal, migratory phenotype, which is dependent on elevated Rac activity [32]. Notably, Par3-elicited induction of Rac signalling maps to the C terminus of Par3, a region that functions as the Tiam1-binding site [13,33]. Together, these findings imply that mistargeting of Tiam1-mediated Rac activity away from intercellular adhesions by over-expression or depletion of Par3 causes the loss of intercellular contacts. Strikingly, the Tiam1-binding fragment of Par3 continues to localize to TJs and to restore TJ formation in Par3-depleted cells [13], demonstrating the biological importance of the Tiam1-Par3 interaction. The proper localization of Tiam1 by Par3 at primordial adhesions is sufficient to enable TJ formation. The recruitment of the polarity complex to primordial adhesions could be accomplished by binding of Par3 to the PDZ domain of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM-A), which is present in primordial adhesions [34]. As Tiam1 associates with Par3, Tiam1 could be recruited to these sites and locally control the activation of Rac and therefore the Par complex. PI3K signalling might further facilitate the recruitment of Par3 and Tiam1. At these sites, PI3K and its phosphoinositide lipid products could stimulate the GEF activity of Tiam1 [29,35] (Figure 2). Finally, the importance of Tiam1 localization by Par3 for its correct Rac-mediated function in cell polarity is underscored by studies concerning neuronal axon outgrowth.

and Par3 localization in primordial adhesions of epithelial cells.

Support for a role of Par3 in localizing Tiam1-Rac activity comes from overexpression studies in MDCK

Involvement of the extracellular matrix in cell polarity

In addition to cell-cell adhesions, cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions can function as a spatial cue to

Figure 2. Tiam1 regulates TJ formation through the Par polarity complex. Primordial adhesions are formed upon homophilic E-cadherin clustering mediated by Ca²⁺ ions (centre). Clustering of cadherins results in a local induction of PI3K activity, which might contribute to the activation and recruitment of Tiam1 and the Par polarity complex to the primordial adhesion site. Moreover, the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex is thought to be targeted to the plasma membrane through the interaction of Par3 with transmembrane proteins called JAMs. It is currently unknown how JAMs are recruited to primordial adhesions upon cadherin clustering. As Par3 directly interacts with Tiam1, Par3 could function as a localization signal for Tiam1. Tiam1 brings Rac into the Par complex leading to Rac activation and the activation of aPKC. Upon activation of the Par complex, JAM, occludin and claudins are recruited and form TJ strands, creating conditions for the separation of the apical and lateral plasma membrane domains (right). These strands are stably anchored to the actin cytoskeleton through the MAGUK family of proteins, such as ZO-1. In addition, the formation of adherens junctions is restricted to the basolateral membrane domain where cadherins are also associated with actin filaments through α- and β-catenins (left). How the spatial separation of the AJ from the TJ and the formation of TJ strands are regulated by the Par complex is currently unknown.

determine the transition of a non-polarized to a polarized
epithelial cell. Studies focusing on the interaction of
epithelial cells with the ECM suggest that Tiam1-Rac
signalling contributes to ECM-mediated polarity.

In the absence of ECM, single epithelial cells cannot
establish apical-basal polarity. Early studies involving
multicellular epithelial (MDCK) cysts showed that the
absence of ECM led to aberrant localization of TJ proteins.
However, the subsequent accumulation of endogenously
produced ECM on the inside of these aggregates resulted
in specific localization of TJ proteins to the apical-lateral
membrane boundary. Strikingly, when these cysts are
surrounded by exogenous ECM, the apical membrane
reforms on the luminal surface and the TJ relocates to the
new apical-lateral membrane boundary, resulting in a
reversal of the axis of cell polarity [36].

Although E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions also
generate differences in protein distribution along the
apical and basolateral membranes, these early findings
illustrate the importance of the ECM in determining
apical-basal cell polarity. This is supported by the more
recent finding that Rac and the ECM component laminin 1
are pivotal in orientating apical-basal polarity in developing
MDCK cysts [37]. Dominant-negative Rac1<sup>N17</sup>
expression causes an inversion of apical-basal polarity
in cysts, implicating Rac activity in the orientation of cell
polarity. Exogenous laminin 1 promotes apical-basal cell
polarity through β<sub>1</sub> integrin-mediated Rac activation
[37,38]. Together, these results imply that integrin-
mediated Rac signalling is a cue to specify the orientation
of the apical membrane domain in MDCK cells.

Because Tiam1 is a specific activator of Rac, Tiam1 is
probably involved in the regulation of integrin-ECM-
mediated cell polarization. Evidence for this comes from
studies that show that Tiam1-mediated Rac activation is
required for integrin signalling and necessary for the
proper production and secretion of laminin 5 (LN5). In
fact, Tiam1-deficient keratinocytes are abrogated in LN5
secretion owing to impaired α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin-induced Rac
activation [39]. In addition, adhesion, spreading and
polarized migration of epithelial cells are controlled by
Rac-dependent α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-LN5 interactions. The α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin
mediates adhesion of epithelial keratinocytes to LN5 and
requires the activation of Rac for these processes [39–41].
These studies, combined with the findings that laminin 1
can determine epithelial cell polarity [37,38], suggest that
Tiam1-Rac signalling on ECM-integrin interactions
controls Par-mediated cell polarization.


Neuronal cell polarity

Perhaps the most unequivocal demonstration of how
polarity signalling controls cell morphology and differentiation
is that of a developing neuron during axon
specification. Primary hippocampal neurons in culture
undergo several distinct morphological changes in a
polarized fashion during differentiation. After seeding,
primary neurons form lamellipodia that extend small
processes called neurites. The first step in polarization
occurs as one of these neurites grows out to become the
future axon, while the others differentiate towards
dendrites. Sequentially, the axon and dendrites mature


and form axonal boutons and dendritic spines, structures
that mediate the synaptic contacts [42]. The Par polarity
complex and Rho-GTPases are essential mediators that
coordinate the cytoskeletal dynamics regulating neuronal
cell differentiation at multiple levels [3,43]. Analogous to
its role in epithelial cells, Tiam1 functions as the hub
between the Par polarity complex and Rac signalling in
neuronal polarization [33]. However, the molecular
mechanisms by which Tiam1 regulates neuronal and
epithelial cell polarity are distinct.

Activation of Rac by Tiam1 or STEF (a Tiam1-related
protein that is also called Tiam2) and, in addition, the
activation of Cdc42, promotes both lamellipodia formation
and neurite outgrowth [44–46]. Furthermore, in murine
hippocampal neurons, Tiam1 is primarily localized to
axon growth cones and its overexpression or suppression
leads to the formation of multiple axon-like neurites or to
defects in axon formation, respectively, suggesting a role
for Tiam1 in the formation of these structures [47]. Similar
results were found in *Drosophila* for the Tiam1
homologue, Still life (SIF), indicating that the involvement
of Tiam1 in axon development is conserved across species
[48]. Combined, these results suggest that Tiam1 regulates
axon specification and neurite outgrowth.

Tiam1, the Par complex and axon specification

Recent data indicate that Cdc42 functions as the primary
cue upstream of the Par polarity complex and Rac to define
which of the growing neurites becomes the future axon
[33,49]. The small GTPase Rap1B localizes Cdc42 to a
single neurite, leading to activation of the Par polarity
complex and to Rac-mediated extension of the respective
neurite to become an axon [49]. Overexpression of an
activated mutant of Cdc42 (Cdc42<sup>L28</sup>) or dominant-active
Rap1B<sup>V12</sup> leads to the formation of multiple axons,
whereas dominant-active Rac1<sup>V12</sup> induces the extension
of multiple neurites irrespective of their identity [49]. By
contrast to the Cdc42<sup>L28</sup> mutant (which autonomously
cycles between a GTP and GDP-bound state), the
Cdc42<sup>V12</sup> mutant (which is unable to hydrolyse GTP)
cannot induce multiple axons, indicating that active
cycling is required for Cdc42 to induce neuronal polarity.
Tiam1 regulates Rac1-driven actin remodelling downstream
of Cdc42 and the Par polarity complex to enable
outgrowth of the pre-selected axon [33]. The direct
interaction of Tiam1 or Tiam2/STEF with Par3 is crucial
for proper polarization and suggests that, as in epithelial
cells, Par3 localizes Tiam1 and Rac activity. In contrast to
TJ formation in epithelial cells, Tiam1 and Rac do not
directly control neuronal cell polarity through Par6 but
are only required for the subsequent outgrowth of the pre-
destined axon, which is downstream of Cdc42 and Rap1B
[33,49]. A similar mechanism has been proposed in
astrocytes, in which Cdc42 initiates polarity signalling
and Rac controls the outgrowth of protrusions at the front
of a motile cell [50]. Nevertheless, the possibility remains
that Par3-recruited Tiam1 functions in a positive feedback
loop, further activating the Par complex through activation
of Rac and thereby contributing to axon specification. In
this way, Cdc42 marks the position on the plasma
membrane from which polarity should be expanded,

whereas Rac signalling functions as a molecular switch to
axonal commitment.

Tiam1, the Par complex and synapse formation
Tiam1 and Rac signalling have an additional role in
neuronal cell polarity; they stimulate the formation and
stabilization of dendritic spines, which are bulb-like
protrusions along dendrites that mediate synaptic con-
tacts [51]. In rat hippocampal neurons, Tiam1 regulates
branching of the dendritic network and dendritic spine
density, which depends on actin remodelling [51]. Simi-
larly, aPKC also regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in
dendritic spines in *Drosophila* [52]. Axonal bouton density
depends on Par6, Bazooka (the *Drosophila* homologue of
Par3) and on the activity of aPKC [52]. Axonal bouton
number is also regulated by SIF, the *Drosophila* homol-
ogue of Tiam1 [48,53]. Together, these data point towards
an evolutionary conserved cross talk between Tiam1/SIF
and the Par polarity complex that regulates spine and
bouton number. A function of Tiam1 and Par3 in
regulating the formation of dendritic spines in rat
hippocampal neurons has recently been confirmed [54].
Whether Tiam1 in spines and axonal boutons is a
downstream target of the polarity complex, as it is in
developing axons, awaits further investigation.

In epithelial cells, Tiam1–Rac signalling is thus
required for the correct localization and activation of the
polarity complex leading to apical-basal cell polarity. In
neuronal cells, however, Rap1–Cdc42 signalling regulates
the localization and activation of the polarity complex
leading to axon specification. Tiam1–Rac signalling
probably controls the subsequent polarized development
of axons and synaptic structures that are predestined by
the Par complex. In both cell systems, however, the
localization of Tiam1 and Rac1 is essential for their
function in cell polarity.

Cell polarity genes and the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition
Loss of apical-basal polarity in epithelial tumours is a
crucial step in the process of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), a requirement for tumour cells to
become invasive and to metastasize [55]. Loss of Tiam1
expression and deregulation of polarity genes contribute
to the progression of tumours [56–60]. *In vitro*, EMT is
characterized morphologically by the acquisition of a
fibroblast-like cell morphology and the dissolution of TJs
and AJs. In various epithelial cells, up- or downregulation
of one of the Par polarity genes (e.g. encoding Par3, Par6B
or aPKC) leads to the disruption of apical-basal polarity,
which could lead to EMT [13,32,60,61]. In *Drosophila*,
oncogenic Ras (*Ras*<sup>V12</sup>) renders tumours of the imaginal
disc highly metastatic but only in combination with
mutations in several polarity genes encoding proteins
such as Scribble, Bazooka (*Drosophila* Par3) or Cdc42,
associating these polarity genes with Ras-induced EMT
[56,62]. Deregulation of the Par complex could therefore
be a requirement, in cooperation with oncogenic signal-
ling, to induce EMT. Evidence for direct cross talk between
a potential oncogenic signalling pathway and the Par

EMT [63]. TGFβ signalling stimulates the dissolution of
TJs in epithelial cells by binding of Par6 to the TGFβ type I
receptor [58,64]. Similarly, knockdown of Tiam1 in
epithelial MDCK cells contributes to the loss of apical-
basal cell polarity and EMT [65], suggesting that loss of
Tiam1 might advance tumour progression by promoting
EMT. Studies on oncogenic Ras-elicited skin tumours in
Tiam1-deficient mice confirm this. These occasional
tumours appearing in Tiam1-deficient mice are highly
invasive, effectively linking the loss of Tiam1 expression
with EMT *in vivo* [57]. Moreover, in skin tumours of wild-
type mice, the conversion of well-differentiated squamous
cell carcinomas to invasive spindle carcinomas is associ-
ated with loss of Tiam1; again supporting the idea that
loss of Tiam1 contributes to tumour progression [57].
However, loss of Tiam1 is not always associated with
tumour progression because increased Tiam1 protein
levels also correlate with invasive and metastatic growth
of some human breast and colon tumours [66,67]. These
contradictory findings might be explained by aberrant
localization of Tiam1 away from cell–cell adhesions, for
instance, by depletion of Par3 or lack of other polarization
cues. This would lead to the dissolution of cell–cell
adhesions and consequently promote migration and
invasion of tumour cells (Figure 3).

Cell polarity genes and tumourigenicity
In addition to the role Tiam1 and polarity proteins have in
EMT, accumulating evidence implies a role in cellular
transformation, particularly in association with oncogenic
Ras. The Ras pathway collaborates with the Rac pathway
in the morphological transformation of cells that involves
Tiam1. The Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Tiam1 interacts
with activated Ras and is required for Ras-mediated
activation of Rac in a PI3K-independent manner [68]. In
addition, *Ras*<sup>V12</sup>-induced transformation of fibroblasts
depends on the interaction of Rac1 or Cdc42 with Par6
and requires PKCζ activity [9,69]. *Ras*<sup>V12</sup>-induced acti-
vation of aPKCζ is impaired by the co-expression of
dominant-negative Rac1<sup>N17</sup>, suggesting that the polarity
complex functions downstream of Ras through Rac [70].
Atypical PKCs (aPKCζ and PKCλ/ι) promote anti-apopto-
tic signalling downstream of Ras and Rac through NFκB
signalling that prevents apoptosis induced by oncogenic
Ras [71,72]. In Tiam1-deficient mice, we found a strong
resistance to the formation of Ras-induced skin tumours
that is due to increased apoptosis in the basal layer of the
epidermis [57]. Therefore, Tiam1 seems required for cell
survival of basal layer keratinocytes that carry an
oncogenic Ras mutation. The *in vivo* function of Tiam1 is
consistent with *in vitro* data that implicate Rac and
atypical PKCs, through activation of NF-κB, in the
suppression of apoptosis induced by oncogenic Ras. In
summary, oncogenic Ras might lead to both neoplastic
transformation and EMT through the involvement of the
Tiam1–Rac pathway and molecules of the Par polarity
complex, including Par6 and PKCζ.

Concluding remarks
Here, we discuss recent findings that implicate Tiam1 in
the establishment of epithelial and neuronal cell polarity.

The localization of Tiam1 by Par3 at the TJs is essential for the maintenance of epithelial polarity. In epithelial cells, dissolution of TJs leads to the loss of apical-basal polarity and results in morphological EMT (right elongated and flattened cell). Under normal conditions (left), Par3 at the TJ localizes Tiam1 and, by stimulating local Rac activity, enables stable intercellular adhesion. Abrogation of the Tiam1-Par polarity complex (right) leads to diminished Rac activity at the cell-cell contacts because Tiam1 is no longer properly localized. Tiam1 can then stimulate Rac activity at other distinct cellular sites, which might result in the enhancement of cell survival signalling, integrin-mediated laminin production and secretion, and increased migration and lamellipodia formation. Enhancement of these Tiam1-Rac-associated processes ultimately leads to increased cell survival, altered cellular adhesion and polarized migration, respectively.

However, the signalling pathways regulating intercellular adhesion and axon specification differ in their requirement for Rac and Cdc42 as the initial cue to stimulate polarity through the Par complex. In line with this, Tiam1 might either function as a direct regulator of the Par complex in epithelial cells or as a target of polarity signalling in neurons. In both cell types, however, the interaction between Par3 and Tiam1 is conserved to restrict Rac activation to the site where polarity is initiated.

Tiam1 and members of the Par complex also have overlapping roles in carcinogenesis. It will be challenging to unravel the molecular mechanism by which Tiam1, Par6 and aPKCs regulate two distinct biological processes: the control of apical-basal polarity and cellular transformation. On the basis of recent studies, one could envision that, during tumour formation and progression, the loss of upstream signals that normally regulate the localization and activity of the polarity complex towards the establishment of cell polarity divert its activity towards processes of cell survival and cell proliferation. Loss of cadherin function, changes in integrin expression and cell-matrix adhesion or dysfunctional mutations in polarity molecules, such as Par3, might direct polarity protein function towards atypical processes such as oncogenic transformation or cancer-related EMT (Figure 3).
