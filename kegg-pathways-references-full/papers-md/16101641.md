## Genetics of ARVC

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. However, variants of ARVC that preferentially affect the left ventricle are increasingly recognized. ARVC is distinguished from dilated cardiomyopathy by a propensity toward ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in the absence of significant ventricular dysfunction.

In the majority of families, ARVC shows autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Recessive forms are also described, often in association with cutaneous disorders. Causative mutations have so far been identified in plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and plakophilin, all of which encode key components of the desmosome. Desmosomes are protein complexes that anchor intermediate filaments to the cytoplasmic membrane in adjoining cells, thereby forming a three-dimensional scaffolding that provides tissues with mechanical strength. Unraveling of the genetic etiology of ARVC has elicited a new model for pathogenesis. Impaired functioning of cell adhesion junctions during exposure to shear stress may lead to myocyte detachment and death, accompanied by inflammation and fibrofatty repair. At least three mechanisms contribute to the arrhythmic substrate: bouts of myocarditis, fibrous and adipose infiltrates that facilitate macroreentry, and gap junction remodeling secondary to altered mechanical coupling. The latter may underlie arrhythmogenicity in early disease.

Although ARVC can be considered a disease of the desmosome, a variety of other genetic defects give rise to phenocopies, which may ultimately enhance our understanding of the broad phenotypic spectrum.

### Introduction

#### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. The main pathologic feature is progressive loss of right ventricular myocardium, which becomes replaced with adipose and fibrous tissue. These changes may be localized and in early disease are often confined to the so-called “triangle of dysplasia”: the inflow, outflow, and apical regions of the right ventricle. Aneurysm formation is typical. Diffuse myocardial involvement leads to global right ventricular dilation. Fibrofatty substitution of the left ventricle is common in advanced disease; the posterolateral wall is preferentially affected, with relative sparing of the septum. Patchy inflammatory infiltrates may be present in areas of myocardial damage.

Characteristic clinical abnormalities include delayed depolarization, epsilon waves, and inverted T waves in the right precordial leads on a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG); late potentials on the signal-averaged ECG; and ventricular dilation, systolic impairment, and wall motion abnormalities on imaging. The cardinal feature is arrhythmia of right ventricular origin, which ranges from frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) to ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The natural history of the disease is subdivided into four phases based on clinical and pathological correlations. Early ARVC is often described as “concealed” owing to the frequent absence of clinical findings, although minor ventricular arrhythmia and subtle structural changes are sometimes discernible. Patients tend to be asymptomatic but may nonetheless be at risk of sudden death, notably during intense physical exertion. The “overt electrical disorder” that subsequently develops is characterized by symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia; patients typically present with palpitation, syncope, and presyncope. Morphological abnormalities are more obvious at this stage and usually detectable by imaging. In the third phase, further extension of disease through the right ventricular myocardium causes impaired contractility and isolated right heart failure. Left ventricular involvement with consequent biventricular failure occurs in the endstage, which may be difficult to distinguish from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).¹⁻³ It should be emphasized, however, that this

clinical picture is representative of the severe form of ARVC that may be seen in probands; familial studies suggest a far broader spectrum of disease expression.^[4,5]

# Diverse Phenotype of Familial ARVC

The prevalence of familial ARVC is usually cited as around 30–50%,^[2] although this is likely to be a conservative estimate for a number of reasons. Since the disease is often clinically silent, elucidation of the family history alone is insufficient; relatives should be encouraged to undergo cardiac assessment. Another major factor is the reduced penetrance that often accompanies autosomal dominant inheritance. The penetrance of ARVC in some kindreds may be as low as 20–30%. Evaluation of small families in clinical practice may therefore create the false impression of sporadic disease. Finally, relatives may show mild, nonspecific phenotypes, contributing to under-recognition of familial disease. Stepwise progression through the classic phases appears rare; mild dilation of either or both ventricles has been documented in relatives without preceding or concomitant arrhythmia.^[5]

The diversity of phenotypic expression in familial ARVC has raised issues regarding the fundamental nature of the disease and, in particular, its distinction from DCM. In the past, the predilection for the right ventricle has been considered the principal distinguishing factor. Recent years, however, have seen pathological descriptions of fibrofatty replacement exclusive to the left ventricle in sudden cardiac death victims.^[6,7] The existence of this entity, perhaps best described as arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy (ALVC), was subsequently confirmed in the clinical setting.^[6] Key findings include inverted T waves in the left ventricular leads (V4–V6), late potentials, and arrhythmia of left ventricular origin, which parallel the clinical findings in ARVC (unpublished data). Family members of patients with ALVC may have the classic right ventricular variant, highlighting the genetic affiliation of the two diseases. Predominant right ventricular involvement is therefore not a necessary attribute. Neither is the presence of myocardial fat pathognomonic of ARVC; significant fatty infiltration has been documented in over 50% of hearts in normal elderly subjects.^[8-10]

The principal characteristic of the arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies is a propensity toward ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in the absence of overt ventricular dysfunction. While sudden death accounts for at least 30% of the overall mortality in DCM,^[11] it is seldom the mode of presentation. In contrast, sudden death is the first clinical manifestation of the disease in more than 50% of probands with ARVC.^[4,5] Equally, ventricular arrhythmia is a relatively common finding in DCM but rare in the absence of significant ventricular dilation and impairment. Of note, not all patients with ARVC will demonstrate this increased arrhythmogenicity, underscoring the importance of familial evaluation in defining the phenotype. Prominent regional involvement and aneurysm formation are additional distinctive features that raise suspicion of an arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy rather than DCM.

## Genetics of Recessive and Syndromic ARVC

Although ARVC is most commonly inherited in autosomal dominant fashion, the molecular studies that led to identification of the first disease-causing gene were performed on a recessive variant known as Naxos disease. One of the major syndromic forms of ARVC, Naxos disease is characterized by nonepidermolysis palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair. The cutaneous manifestations, coupled with nearly 100% penetrance of cardiac disease by adolescence, facilitated the recognition of affected subjects in this population. In 1998, Coonar et al. mapped the genetic locus to 17q21.^[12] Two years later, McKoy et al. reported a 2 base pair deletion in the plakoglobin gene (JUP) as the cause of Naxos disease. This mutation results in a frameshift and premature termination of the protein.^[13] Homozygous subjects have diffuse palmo-plantar keratoderma and woolly hair from infancy. Children are usually asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint but may have minor ventricular arrhythmia; symptom onset occurs in puberty, often with syncope. The annual mortality thereafter from sudden cardiac death is around 3%, marginally higher than that observed in dominant forms of ARVC.^[14]

Plakoglobin is a major constituent of cell adhesion junctions, and its isolation in Naxos disease paved the way for a search for related genes. Gene identification studies were already ongoing for another recessive cardiocutaneous syndrome, consisting of a triad of woolly hair, epidermolysis palmoplantar keratoderma, and apparent DCM. First recognized by Rao et al. in 1996 in India,^[15] the phenotype was further elucidated in several Ecuadorian families by Dr. Luis Carvajal-Huerta.^[16] Within months of the identification of plakoglobin in Naxos disease, Norgett et al. reported a deletion in desmoplakin (DSP) as the causative mutation in so-called Carvajal syndrome.^[17] This mutation is predicted to cause truncation of the C-domain in the tail end of the protein. More recently, Alcalai et al. isolated a missense mutation in the C-terminal of desmoplakin in an Arab family with recessive ARVC, woolly hair, and a pemphigus-like skin disorder.^[18] Curiously, both mutations are located in exon 24 of the desmoplakin gene; however, the cardiomyopathy of Carvajal syndrome shows a predilection for the left ventricle, while the cardiac phenotype in the Arab family appeared to be classic ARVC.

### Genetics of Dominant ARVC

Desmoplakin was also the first gene linked to autosomal-dominant ARVC, when Rampazzo et al. reported a missense mutation in an Italian family with the typical right ventricular phenotype.^[19] The resulting amino acid substitution modifies a putative phosphorylation site in the N-terminal plakoglobin-binding domain. Desmoplakin forms dimers or higher-order aggregates in vivo; thus, the majority of complexes are likely to contain the mutant protein, accounting for the dominant mode of transmission. Interestingly, a single adenine insertion in the N-terminal of desmoplakin has been isolated in a family with archetypal ALVC (unpublished data). This frameshift mutation is predicted to introduce a premature stop-codon, resulting in truncation of the rod and C-terminal domains. More recently, a variety of mutations in plakophilin-2 (PKP2) have been identified in a number of probands with ARVC.^[20]

Unraveling the pathogenesis of ARVC is dependent on understanding the function and interplay of the cell adhesion proteins implicated.

### The Intercellular Junction: A Simplified Model

Skeletal muscle consists of long multinucleated myofibres that originate from fusion of mononucleated precursor myoblasts. Cardiac myocytes, in contrast, do not form a
syncytium. Instead, the mononuclear cells rely on specialized structures known as intercalated discs for both mechanical and electrical coupling. Intercalated discs contain three distinct types of cell-cell connection: gap junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes.

Gap junctions mediate ion transfer between cells. Each gap junction channel is a composite of two hemi-channels, or connexons, located within the cytoplasmic membrane of adjacent cells. The connexons, in turn, are formed by an assembly of six connexin subunits. Connexin 43 (Cx 43) is the principal subtype in the human heart; connexins 40 and 45 are also expressed at lower levels.²¹⁻²³

Synchronous contraction requires transmission of force between cells, which is accomplished via adherens junctions. The transmembrane component of an adherens junction, which establishes intercellular contact, is a classical cadherin (Ca²⁺-dependent glycoprotein). N-cadherin is the predominant isoform expressed in the human heart. Attached to the cytoplasmic tail of N-cadherin are β-catenin and plakoglobin (γ-catenin), both of which bind to α-catenin. α-catenin interacts directly with actin microfilaments within the sarcomere.²³

Finally, desmosomes share with adherens junctions the responsibility for providing mechanical attachment between cells. In contrast to adherens junctions, however, desmosomes are not linked to the dynamic actin network; rather, they are associated with intermediate filaments, mainly desmin.²⁴ Proteins from three separate families assemble to form desmosomes: the desmosomal cadherins, armadillo proteins, and plakins.

The genes encoding the desmosomal cadherins are clustered on chromosome 18q12.1. Four desmogleins (DSG1-4) and three desmocollins (DSC1-3) are recognized.²⁵,²⁶ The desmosomal cadherins comprise the transmembrane component of the desmosomal complex. Their extracellular domains interface directly with their counterparts on neighboring cells (Fig. 1). Besides their role in cell adhesion, the desmosomal cadherins may function as regulators of morphogenesis.²⁵

The intracellular portions of the desmosomal cadherins interact with proteins of the armadillo family: plakoglobin and plakophilin. Plakoglobin, it should be noted, is also found in

adherens junctions together with its homologue β-catenin. β-catenin, conversely, is not a constituent of desmosomes as it binds specifically to the classical cadherins. However, β-catenin has an additional nonadhesive function as a regulator of transcription, and a similar role has been postulated for plakoglobin.²⁵ The plakophilins are found in the nucleus as well as the desmosome, although their function therein remains speculative.²⁶

Binding sites for both plakoglobin and plakophilin are situated in the N-terminal domain of desmoplakin. At its C-terminal, desmoplakin anchors desmin intermediate filaments to the cell surface.²⁵,²⁶ Another member of the plakin family, plectin, is also present in desmosomes. While its absence does not alter the ultrastructure of desmosomes, plectin appears to contribute significantly to the mechanical strengthening of cells.²⁷

# Pathogenesis of ARVC

The disease-causing genes hitherto identified in ARVC encode desmosomal proteins, prompting proposal of a new model for the pathogenesis of ARVC. Impaired desmosome functioning under conditions of mechanical stress is thought to cause myocyte detachment and death. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs.

The above hypothesis sheds light on a number of the hallmark features of ARVC, including its anatomical progression. The increased distensibility of the thin-walled right ventricle, an adaptation to wide variations in preload in the normal state, appears to confer vulnerability to cell adhesion defects. By Laplace’s law, wall tension is inversely proportional to wall thickness. Accordingly, early ARVC shows a predilection for the thinnest portions of the right ventricle, namely, the triangle of dysplasia. Similarly, left ventricular involvement is often restricted to the relatively thin posterolateral wall, with sparing of the thicker septum. Clinical experience suggests that athletes often have structurally severe forms of the disease, consequent perhaps to intense and prolonged mechanical stress on the heart during physical training. The heterogeneous distribution of mechanical stress

within the ventricle accounts for regional disease expression and aneurysm formation. In contrast, the contemporary view of the pathogenesis of DCM invokes impaired generation or transmission of force, which is more likely to be a uniform phenomenon.

The extramyocardial manifestations of syndromic ARVC are also explicable in terms of desmosomal dysfunction. Cutaneous disease is confined to the areas most exposed to pressure and/or abrasion: the palmar and plantar surfaces. The implication is that the mutant desmosomal proteins are able to maintain tissue integrity unless subjected to excessive mechanical stress. It follows that the incomplete penetrance of ARVC in many gene carriers may be related to a lack of stress on the heart, in conjunction perhaps with a sedentary lifestyle. Thus, the young athlete presents with symptomatic arrhythmia while the disease remains subclinical in other family members.

The same paradigm may be extrapolated to other associations of ARVC, although the exact mechanisms are much less well understood. Martini et al. reported on a patient with ARVC and mitral valve prolapse,²⁸ a link that was subsequently highlighted in a postmortem series.²⁹ It can be speculated that disruption of normal cell-cell adhesion predisposes to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve. More recently, Merten et al. documented chronic aortic dissection in the setting of ARVC.³⁰ Autopsy revealed degenerative changes in the media of the aorta. Whether this was coincidental or true pleiotropy remains unresolved; the history of hypertension was a major confounder. However, disruption of the internal elastic lamina, accompanied by intimal and medial hyperplasia, has been observed in the arteries of ARVC patients.³¹,³² Fontaine et al. have cited this finding as a possible explanation for the atypical chest pain often reported by these patients.³³ Intimal hyperplasia is widely held to be a response to endothelial cell injury, to which vessels with cell adhesion defects may naturally be more susceptible. Recessive ARVC and anterior polar cataracts have been described in a consanguineous family from Argentina.³⁴ Fibrotic changes and abnormal accumulation of crystallins are observed in the lens epithelial cells of patients with anterior polar cataracts. Crystallins are essential determinants of lens transparency that may undergo modification in response to aging or stress.³⁵ A common undercurrent of stress-induced damage to cell surfaces is therefore apparent.

### Mechanisms Underlying Arrhythmia

At least three distinct mechanisms may underlie ventricular arrhythmia in ARVC. Sustained monomorphic VT in the overt stage is traditionally ascribed to reentrant circuits arising from fibrofatty substitution of the myocardium. Less easy to account for is the phenomenon of “hot phases,” during which previously stable patients with mild disease may suffer unheralded arrhythmic events or even die suddenly. The disease is thought to remain quiescent for long periods, until an unknown stimulus triggers myocyte loss and inflammation in hitherto unaffected regions of the myocardium. The resulting bouts of myocarditis may provide the substrate for arrhythmic exacerbation. Recent studies have also shed light on the basis for arrhythmia in “concealed” ARVC. Gap junctions have a high protein content, which renders the normally fluid cytoplasmic membrane rigid and prone to rupture. Their close proximity to desmosomes at the intercalated discs may protect them from mechanical stress. Destabilization of cell adhesion complexes will inhibit preservation of normal numbers of gap junctions. The resultant heterogeneous conduction may be a significant contributor to arrhythmogenesis.⁴⁰

Kaplan et al. tested this hypothesis on cardiac tissue from 4 patients with Naxos disease and 1 with Carvajal syndrome.³⁷,⁴⁰ Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed markedly diminished expression of connexin 43 at the intercellular junctions in both ventricles. Smaller and fewer gap junctions were observed. Of particular interest was the presence of these findings in the heart of a 7-year-old child homozygous for the Naxos mutation. Prior cardiac evaluation had revealed >14,000 PVCs of predominantly right ventricular origin in a 24-hour period. Following her death from leukemia, histological examination of her heart showed no evidence of fibrofatty replacement, leukemic infiltrates, or chemotherapy-related damage. The inescapable conclusion is that clinically significant arrhythmia may occur in the absence of structural heart disease in ARVC. Furthermore, it appears that gap junction remodeling may account for arrhythmogenesis in the so-called “concealed” phase. Whether this

### Left-Sided Variants of ARVC

Both ALVC and Carvajal syndrome have been linked with mutations causing truncation of the C-terminal domain of desmoplakin. An attractive hypothesis invokes disrupted binding of desmin intermediate filaments as the mechanism underlying involvement of the high-pressure left ventricle. This may be analogous to the loss of cytoskeletal integrity considered central to the development of DCM.³⁶ Immunohistochemical analysis of myocardial sections from a patient with Carvajal syndrome has confirmed failure of desmin to localize to the intercalated discs.³⁷ The normal interaction between desmin and sarcomeric Z-disks was unaffected. Conversely, amino acid substitutions within desmoplakin may impair cell adhesion without compromising cytoskeletal function, thereby resulting in predominant right ventricular disease.¹⁸,¹⁹ However, ARVC and its left ventricular vari-
mechanism has the potential to produce lethal tachyarrhythmia is unresolved. As Kaplan et al. suggest, however, superimposition of even mild myocardial abnormalities could impart a marked propensity toward arrhythmia and sudden death.⁴⁰

# Beyond the Desmosomal Model

Current thinking therefore portrays ARVC as a disease of the desmosome. This model appears to provide satisfactory explanations for both the characteristic myocardial abnormalities and the extracardiac features of syndromic ARVC. The identification of mutations in other components of the desmosome is an active area of research. Djabali et al. reported on two Arab families with the Naxos phenotype in whom mutations in plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilins 1, 2, and 4, and the desmocollin/desmoglein gene cluster were excluded.⁴¹ Although analysis of additional desmosomal proteins is ongoing, it may be necessary to look outside the cell adhesion complex in some kindreds.

In 1994, linkage analysis identified a genetic locus for dominant ARVC at 14q23-q24, thereafter termed ARVD1.⁴² One of the most promising candidate genes mapping to this region was transforming growth factor β3 (TGFβ3). However, sequencing studies failed to identify any disease-causing mutations in the exonic regions of TGFβ3 and four other genes,⁴³ prompting screening of the promoter and untranslated regions (UTRs) of TGFβ3. Beffagna et al. recently reported a nucleotide transition in 5′ UTR of the TGFβ3 gene in all clinically affected members of a large family with ARVD1.⁴⁴ The mutation is predicted to produce an amino acid substitution in a putative short peptide with an inhibitory role in TGFβ3 regulation. An additional mutation was identified in the 3′ UTR of TGFβ3 in an unrelated proband. Expression assays revealed that both mutated UTRs were significantly more active than wild-type.

The implication of these studies is that regulatory mutations resulting in overexpression of TGFβ3 may form the basis of ARVC in these families. The transforming growth factor β family of cytokines is known to stimulate production of components of the extracellular matrix. It is therefore conceivable that enhanced TGFβ activity may lead to myocardial fibrosis. TGFβ is further postulated to modulate the stability of intercellular junctions, which may explain preferential involvement of the right ventricle as per the desmosomal model. A few cautionary notes must be sounded, however, before TGFβ can be assigned a central role in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Genetic analysis of two other families with ARVD1 failed to identify mutations in the TGFβ3 coding sequences, UTRs, and promoter region.⁴⁴ In view of the widespread tissue distribution of TGFβ3, the apparent absence of extracardiac manifestations in association with the mutations warrants examination. Finally, while the desmosomal model succeeds in explaining many of the clinical facets of ARVC, including arrhythmogenesis in early disease and the predilection for the right ventricle, the mechanisms underlying disease expression secondary to TGFβ3 mutations remain to be elucidated.⁴⁵ Table 1 summarizes the disease-causing mutations so far identified in ARVC and associated phenotypes.

Another obvious extradesmosomal candidate gene is connexin-43. Mutations in connexin-43 have not been identified in conjunction with cardiac disease, but have the obvious potential to be arrhythmogenic. The capacity of connexin-43 defects to produce structural abnormalities is evidenced by the association with oculo-dento-digital dysplasia; ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden deaths have been recorded in some affected families.⁴⁶

Phenocopies of ARVC may provide additional insight into its genetic heterogeneity. In clinical practice, the disease that most frequently mimics ARVC is idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (RVOTT). A benign arrhythmic disorder with no familial basis, RVOTT may nonetheless be extremely difficult to distinguish from the concealed phase of ARVC, in which typical ECG and imaging abnormalities are absent. RVOTT cannot, however, be considered a true phenocopy as the classic structural features do not evolve with time.

A distinct clinical entity known as ARVD2 was described in 1988.⁴⁷ Whereas classic ARVC is associated with monomorphic right ventricular tachycardia, ARVD2 is characterized by effort-induced polymorphic VT that does not appear to have a reentrant mechanism.⁴⁷,⁴⁸ Patients do not develop characteristic features of ARVC on the 12-lead ECG, and late potentials on the signal-averaged ECG are a rare occurrence. The echocardiogram is often normal, although slightly increased right ventricular volumes and mild localized hypokinesia have been reported in some cases. Global right ventricular function is unaffected.⁴⁹ Further distinguishing features include high penetrance, association with juvenile sudden death, and an equal sex ratio; classic ARVC is slightly more common in men. A causative mutation was subsequently identified in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2),⁵⁰ the major calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiomyocytes, also implicated in familial catecholaminergic polymorphic VT.⁵¹,⁵² It has been proposed that RyR2 mutations affect the regulation of the channel. The result is increased leakage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during sympathetic stimulation, which produces the typical stress-induced polymorphic VT seen in both conditions. Rampazzo et al. have further suggested that disturbances in calcium homeostasis may be a final common pathway for disease expression in both ARVD2 and desmosomal disease.¹⁹ While segmental fibrofatty replacement has been reported at the apex of the right ventricle on postmortem,⁴⁵ ARVD2 shows a closer resemblance to familial catecholaminergic polymorphic VT in both etiology and phenotype; its inclusion under the umbrella term of ARVC remains controversial.

Surprisingly, more convincing phenocopies of ARVC may reside among the muscular dystrophies. Skeletal muscle degeneration with fibrous and adipose replacement is characteristic. Similar histological changes may be observed in the heart, underscoring the nonspecific reparative nature of fibrofatty infiltration. Myocardial disease may occur in the absence of significant skeletal myopathy.

Melacini et al. found evidence of cardiomyopathy in 68% of patients with subclinical Becker’s muscular dystrophy undergoing routine cardiac evaluation.⁵³ ECG features included T wave inversion in the right precordial leads in a minority. Right ventricular dilation was a common finding on echocardiography. Serial evaluation of a single patient suggested preferential involvement of the right ventricle in early disease, followed by progression to a DCM phenotype.

The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex provides a mechanical connection between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.<sup>54</sup> Mutations in dystrophin may initially compromise cellular adherence to the extracellular matrix and thereby predispose to sarcolemmal damage from shear stress. As with desmosomal abnormalities, this process is more liable to affect the thin-walled right ventricle. Subsequent involvement of the cytoskeleton causes left ventricular impairment. Defects of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex should therefore be considered in families with right ventricular cardiomyopathy progressing to a DCM phenotype. In contrast to desmosomal disease, however, arrhythmia and sudden death seldom occur in the absence of prominent left ventricular dysfunction.

The histopathological appearances of the heart in X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) mirror those of ARVC. There is myocardial atrophy with fibrofatty replacement, with preponderance for the right heart; however, the prominent atrial involvement is peculiar to EDMD.<sup>55,56</sup> Female carriers may develop cardiac disease without skeletal myopathy.<sup>52</sup> The disease-causing gene at Xq28 encodes emerin,<sup>57</sup> which localizes to the inner nuclear membrane, desmosomes, and adherens junctions.<sup>58</sup> Dysfunction of cell adhesion junctions and, by extrapolation, altered electrical coupling, may account for the enhanced risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden death in EDMD.<sup>59</sup> Novel mutations in emerin and related proteins could conceivably result in an ARVC phenotype.

Asano et al. have described a phenotype resembling ARVC in mice carrying mutations of the laminin receptor 1 gene (Lamr1),<sup>60</sup> which encodes a nuclear ribosomal protein. Affected mice showed degeneration of cardiac myocytes with massive fibrosis confined to the right ventricle although ventricular tachyarrhythmia was not documented. Specific binding of the mutant gene product to a heterochromatin protein was observed, with alteration of chromatin architecture and early cell death. An alternative explanation was offered for the right ventricular preponderance, namely, that the normally high pressures in the left ventricle might induce expression of cytoprotective genes, including heat shock proteins, which counteract inappropriate protein remodeling. While this mechanism may well contribute to the phenotype,

sitivity. Particularly problematic is recognition of the “concealed” phase, since the absence of clinical features does not necessarily confer low risk. Interpretation of isolated cardiac abnormalities may be difficult. Sensitive imaging techniques, for example, frequently detect mild wall motion abnormalities, the significance of which is uncertain in the thin-walled, pyramidal, trabeculated right ventricle. Furthermore, the clinician will often wonder how far to proceed in investigating symptoms such as syncope, a common and innocuous occurrence among normal adolescents, but a potential harbinger of arrhythmic events in ARVC. Incomplete penetrance also poses a significant obstacle to stepwise familial assessment. Currently, the recommendation is to err on the side of caution by offering routine evaluation to second-degree relatives of index cases. However, the inevitable consequence of this approach will be extensive, albeit noninvasive, investigation of numerous healthy individuals.

Molecular genetic analysis will eventually assume a pivotal role in the clinical area by facilitating timely diagnosis, guiding interpretation of borderline investigations, and enabling cascade screening of relatives. Gerull et al. report a 25% prevalence of plakophilin mutations among unrelated probands with ARVC; with additional screening of desmoplakin, genetic diagnosis may be feasible in a significant proportion of patients. However, early identification of genetically affected individuals raises complex management issues in its own right while definitive risk stratification remains elusive. So-called “hot phases,” in particular, are unpredictable and a small number of patients may suffer arrhythmic events without warning symptoms or clinical evidence of overt disease. Conversely, a sizable proportion of gene carriers will not develop clinically significant disease owing to reduced penetrance. Furthermore, among relatives with disease expression, the majority are likely to follow a benign course. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator confers optimal protection against sudden death, but the notable complication rate and psychological repercussions in the younger age group argue strongly against indiscriminate device placement in all gene-positive patients. Similarly, the adverse prognostic impact of harboring an ARVC mutation is too small to justify the use of mutation analysis in prenatal diagnosis. At present, there is little evidence to support the notion that certain mutations may portend a less favorable outcome than others; retrospective studies suggest that, in contrast to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a malignant family history is not an important predictor of increased risk in ARVC.

Conclusion

The arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies may be considered diseases of the desmosome. Impaired mechanical coupling at cell adhesion junctions is associated with gap junction remodeling, which may account for the increased propensity toward arrhythmia in early disease. Ventricular dysfunction may ensue in the later stages owing to progressive myocyte detachment and death. Fibrofatty replacement is a nonspecific repair process also observed in the muscular dystrophies. Right ventricular predominance appears to be a feature of many diseases in which adhesion of cells to each other or the extracellular matrix is compromised. However, marked arrhythmogenicity occurs mainly in the setting of desmosomal and gap junction involvement.
