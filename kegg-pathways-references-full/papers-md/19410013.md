ABSTRACT

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a representative model of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and offers a means of understanding their common principles and fundamental mechanisms. Furthermore, EGFR plays an essential role in cell proliferation and migration, and the disruption of EGFR signaling has been implicated in the development and growth of cancer. Phospholipase D (PLD) is a key mediator of EGFR function, and can be directly regulated by upstream binding partners in an EGF-dependent manner. PLD regulates downstream molecules by generating phosphatidic acid (PA), but it also dynamically interacts with a variety of intracellular molecules and these interactions spatiotemporally regulate EGFR function and serve as a hub that orchestrates signaling flow. This review summarizes the interrelationship between PLD and its binding molecules in the context of EGFR signaling, and addresses the roles of PLD in the mediation and coordination of this signaling.

1. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling

Epidemal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is representative of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, and is highly conserved from nematodes to humans [1,2]. Furthermore, EGFR signaling plays important roles in the determination of cell fate, particularly in terms of cell proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation. EGF signaling is also important for the maturation of epithelial tissues [3,4], the development of epithelial organs [5–7], and for hepatic organ repair [8]. In addition to these physiologic roles, EGFR signaling has also been implicated in pathologic states, like cancer progression [9–12], and is a target of potential anti-cancer therapies.

The binding of EGF to EGFR causes EGFR dimerization and the induction of the phosphorylations of specific tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domains. By utilizing these phosphotyrosine residues as docking sites, EGFR recruits many signaling proteins, such as, phosphoinositide (PtdIns) 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), Abl, Src, Grb2, Shc, PTP-1B, and SHP-1, and transduces signals to many different pathways in a binding partner dependent manner. Finally, EGFR signaling is turned off by endocytosis, that is, by its removal from the cell surface, by dephosphorylation (by phosphatases), and by negative-feedback that dissociates EFGR from its protein partners [13].

2. EGF-mediated phospholipase D (PLD) regulation

It has been reported that EGF triggers the activation of PLD in various cell types, such as, osteoblastic cells [14], a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293) [15], a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (A431) [16], mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) [17], immortalized rabbit corneal epithelial cells [18], a mouse myoblast cell line (C2C12) [19], a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line (CCL39) [20], rat liver cells [21], bovine luteal cells [22], pancreatic acinar cells [23], a human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) [24], human dermal fibroblasts [25], a Chinese hamster embryo fibroblast cell line (IIC9) [26], and a mouse embryo fibroblast cell line Swiss 3T3 [27]. Furthermore, EGF-mediated PLD activation is a feature of the key molecular events underlying many cellular functions in a wide range of cell types. In A431 cells [28] and rat calvarial osteoblastic cells [29], EGF was found to induce proliferation via PLD activation. Furthermore, EGF has been reported to activate PLD in mouse pancreatic islets and in a pancreatic beta cell line, and these activations appeared to be associated with insulin secretion [30]. In 3Y1 rat fibroblasts [31,32], elevated expressions of PLD and EGFR were found to contribute to cellular transformation. In addition to cancer progression via abnormal EGFR signaling, it has also been reported that PLD activity and expression are increased in several cancer cells, which include breast, gastric, and colon cancer cells [33–36]. In another study, PLD activity was found to be implicated in EGFR-mediated endocytosis [37]. Furthermore, in MDCK cells, PA (the product of PLD activation) is a critical mediator of EGF-dependent cell motility [38].

As we mentioned above, EGF stimulates PLD in many cell types. In an immortalized hippocampal stem cell line (HiB5), PDGF induced the rapid and transient activations of PLC and PLD and caused neurite

outgrowth. However, EGF stimulated neither PLD nor PLC in these cells [39]. Furthermore, the mechanism of PLD activation by EGF is cell type dependent. In Swiss 3T3 cells and HEK293 cells, it was found that PKC downregulation inhibits EGF-stimulated PLD activation [40,41]. In 3Y1 cells, PKCα mediated the activation of PLD by EGF [42], but in A431 cells, PKC downregulation or treatment with PKC inhibitors had no effect on EGF-induced PLD activation [43]. It has also been reported that neither PLC, PtdIns 3-kinase, nor PKC is involved in the activation of PLD by EGF in immortalized rabbit corneal epithelial cells [18], and that PLD activation by EGF is dependent on Rac1, and not on PKC, in Rat1 fibroblasts [44]. The cellular functions and mechanisms of PLD activation by EGF are cell-type dependent, which means that the signaling contexts of PLD complexes induced by EGF are also cell-type dependent. Accordingly, a detailed knowledge of the many PLD complexes is likely to contribute substantially to the understanding of these phenomena.

### 3. PLD and its binding partners in EGF signaling

Two isoforms of PLD (PLD1 and PLD2) have been cloned in mammals [45–47]. These isoforms show about 50% sequence homology to each other and have several conserved regions, namely, the phox homology (PX) domain, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and catalytic regions I–IV, which are directly involved in the enzyme activities of PLD superfamily members [48,49]. The cloning of these PLDs accelerated isozyme specific studies to be conducted on the functions of PLD, the hierarchy of the PLD signaling pathway, and the mechanisms of PLD regulation. Initially, attempts were made to discover new PLD-binding partners and to characterize their molecular relationships in specific signaling pathways. These efforts have resulted in the discovery of around 50 PLD-binding partners. The PLD-binding molecules that mediate EGF signaling are summarized in Table 1. Multiple interactions in various cellular regions underlie the complexity of PLD regulation. Here, we will mainly discuss the roles and mechanisms of PLD-binding partners in the regulation of EGF signaling.

#### 3.1. GTP-binding proteins

Many authors have suggested that members of the small GTPase family, which contains the Rho, Arf, and Ras families, interact directly with PLD in vitro, and these interactions have been implicated in the regulation of PLD activation in vivo [47,49–54]. Although it is not clear whether Rac2 can regulate PLD activity [55,56], Hess et al. showed that dominant negative Rac1 (N17Rac1) completely inhibits PLD activation by EGF, but not by PDGF, whereas PDGF-induced PLD activation was found to be mediated by RhoA in Rat1 fibroblasts [44]. In 293T cells overexpressing EGFR, Arf4 associates with the cytoplasmic region of EGFR and directly regulates PLD2 activation, but not PLD1 activation [57]. Dominant-negative RalA and Ras were also found to abolish PLD activation by EGF [41]. RalA is a downstream effector of Ras, and EGF causes the Ras-induced activation of RalA, whereas EGF-stimulated PLD1 activation is dependent on both Ras and RalA [32]. Most authors have suggested that PLD1 can be activated by small GTPases in vitro, but PLD2 either responds marginally or fails to respond to small GTPases in vitro [49]. However, Arf1 activates PLD2 and PLD1 in vitro [47]. Arf4 also activates PLD2 in EGF-stimulated cells [57], although it remains to be determined whether this is achieved by a direct or an indirect interaction. Accordingly, the involvement of small GTPases in EGF-dependent PLD activation requires further verification.

Park et al. reported that dynamin, a large GTPase, can interact with PLD in a GTP dependent manner in vitro [58]. Dynamin is considered a mechanochemical enzyme that drives vesicle budding-out via GTP hydrolysis [59–61]. In COS7 cells, dynamin interacts with and activates PLD in an EGF-dependent manner [58]. Accordingly, activated EGFR may use various GTP-binding proteins to activate PLD in cells.

#### 3.2. Protein kinases

Several groups have reported the involvement of PKC in extracellular signal induced-PLD activation [40,62–65]. In particular, in terms of EGF signaling, PLD activation is dependent on PKC isotypes. In Swiss 3T3 cells, PKC downregulation abolished EGF-stimulated PLD activation [40,41], and in HEK293 cells, PKC alpha and PKC delta were found to differentially regulate EGF-induced PLD activation [42]. Furthermore, it has been reported that PKCα phosphorylates multiple residues (S2, T147, and S561) of PLD1 in vivo [66]. EGF stimulates PKCα-mediated PLD1 phosphorylation (T147) in the caveolae region of COS7 cells, and this phosphorylation contributes to PLD1 activation. Moreover, dominant negative-PKCα, a kinase-defective mutant of PKCα, completely inhibited EGF-induced PLD1 phosphorylation and activation [67]. Accordingly, it appears that PKCα is one of the major protein kinases in the EGFR signaling pathway leading to PLD1 activation.

Recently, it was reported cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates PLD2 (but not PLD1) at Ser 134, and that this phosphorylation is critical for EGF-dependent PLD2 activation and insulin secretion in a pancreatic β cell line [68]. Src, a tyrosine kinase, also can interact with the PH domain and phosphorylate tyrosine residues of PLD in an EGF-dependent manner. However, this phosphorylation of PLD by Src is not required for EGF-induced PLD activation, but it is required for Src activation [28]. It has been reported that PLD2 forms a complex with EGFR in an EGF-independent manner and that PLD2 is phosphorylated at tyrosine residue Y11 by EGF, but this phosphorylation was not found to affect EGF-induced PLD activation [15]. Although the serine/threonine phosphorylation of PLD is important for PLD regulation, the role of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD is unclear. Thus, it remains to be determined what precisely the roles of the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD via EGFR or Src are.

3.3. Inhibitory proteins

Many reports have concluded that PLDs are directly regulated by inhibitory proteins. Cytoskeletal-related proteins like monomeric actin [69,70], actinin [71], and tubulin [72] are known to inhibit PLD activity via direct interaction. However, in the case of actin, it was reported that polymerized F-actin can increase PLD activity [70]. The metabolic enzyme (adolase) [73] and neuronal proteins (collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) [74], amphiphysin [75], and α-synuclein [76]) also interact directly with PLD and inhibit its activity. Of these inhibitory proteins, only tubulin showed a signal (carbachol) dependent interaction with PLD. This particular interaction is important for the transient activation of PLD by carbachol [72]. Munc-18 is another inhibitory protein that interacts with PLD in the basal state, and EGF dissociates munc-18 from PLD, and thereby, activates PLD, which indicates that munc-18 acts as negative regulator that inhibits basal PLD activity [77]. Issues that remain to be addressed include the possible involvements of other inhibitory proteins in the regulation of PLDs in EGF signaling.

3.4. Other binding proteins

Grb2 is a key adaptor that directly associates with EGFR [78]. It has been reported that Grb2 interacts with the Y169/Y179 residues of PLD2, and that this interaction is essential for EGF-induced PLD2 activity and for the intracellular localization of PLD2 [79]. PLCγ1 is also a key signaling molecule that interacts with the phosphotyrosine residue of EGFR. PLCγ1 interacts with the PX domain of PLD2 via its SH3 domain, and this interaction is critical for the EGF-induced activations of PLCγ1 and PLD2 [80]. Furthermore, the protein effect of PLD and the upstream function of PLD in the activation of PLCγ1 were first suggested in this report. Many studies have focused on the regulation of PLD activity by its binding partners. However, as in the case for PLCγ1, it would be worthwhile determining whether these interacting proteins can be modulated by PLD itself, rather than by its lipase activity.

3.5. Phospholipids

Because PLDs are localized to membranes, they may interact with membrane lipids and mediate lipid signaling. Several phospholipids (PtdIns(4,5)P₂, PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃, and PA) are essential second messengers in the EGF signaling pathway [29,81–83], and these phospholipids can associate with and regulate PLD. For example, PtdIns(4,5)P₂ potently and specifically affects the membrane localization of PLD and activates both PLD1 and PLD2 [84–86]. Furthermore, PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ can interact with the PX domain (R179) of PLD1, and this is important for stimulating PDGF-induced PLD1 activity [87]. PA also binds to the PX domain of PLD, and the secondary lipid-binding pocket residue (R158) of the PLD1-PX domains is essential for this PA binding [88,89]. PA also recruits its binding proteins to the membrane, for example, the EGF-dependent membrane translocation of SOS is due to an interaction between the PH domain of SOS and PA [90]. Moreover, this translocation of SOS to the plasma membrane mediates EGF-induced Ras signaling. PA also activates PtdIns(4)P 5-Kinase, which is required for EGF-induced PtdIns(4,5)P₂ generation and cell spreading [91]. In addition, PA can interact with the FRB domain of mTOR and PA generated by mitogenic signaling can activate mTOR [92]. However, little is known about the relationship between PLD and phospholipids in the EGF signaling pathway, and the role of phospholipids in the regulation of PLD during EGF signaling remains to be elucidated.

4. PLD and EGFR endocytosis

PLD has been reported to be implicated in receptor-mediated endocytosis [93,94]. During this process, PA is involved in the membrane curvature required for vesicle budding [95]. More specifically, PA recruits PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase to generate PtdIns(4,5)P₂, which recruits dynamin [61], the core clathrin coat, and coat-associated proteins like AP2 [96] and AP180 [97]. It has also been reported that PA generation via PLD activation is important for EGFR-induced endocytosis [37], and recently, Lee et al. suggested that the GTPase activation protein (GAP) property of PLD for dynamin is also required for EGFR-induced endocytosis [98]. The concentration of EGF in normal tissue ranges from 0.15 to 0.3 nM and its concentration in the lumens of the tubular ducts of kidneys, salivary glands, and mammary glands is around 15 nM [99,100]. Furthermore, during wound healing and malignant transformation, EGFR is exposed to high concentrations of EGF [101], which has also been reported to be elevated in tumors [102]. In addition, Roepstorff et al. have suggested that the mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis may be affected by the EGF concentration [103]. Here, we suggest both PLD activity dependent and independent models of EGFR endocytosis (Fig. 1). At low EGF concentration (0.2 nM), which cannot activate PLD, PLD protein itself (via its GAP function for dynamin) may be critically involved in EGFR endocytosis. However, at EGF concentration which is high enough (20 nM) to activate PLD, PA produced by PLD activation may be the major player in EGFR endocytosis. Furthermore, there may be a requirement for the rapid internalization of EGFR via PA generation when EGF concentrations are high. There is another example of the effect of EGF concentration on EGFR endocytosis. At low EGF concentrations (0.15–0.3 nM), EGFR is internalized by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, whereas at higher EGF concentration (3 nM), EGFR is internalized by caveolae-dependent endocytosis [104]. On the other hand, in another report it was suggested that EGFR endocytosis is mainly due to clathrin-dependent endocytosis at high EGF concentrations [105]. Summarizing, depending on EGF concentration, PLD is involved in EGFR endocytosis through both the GAP activity of its PX domain for dynamin and the production of PA.

5. Coordination of EGF signaling by the PX domain of PLD

As mentioned above, the PX domain of PLD interacts with several molecules, such as, proteins (PLCγ1, munc-18, dynamin, PKCα, and Grb2), and phospholipids (PA, PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃). Munc-18 interacts with the C-terminal region (184–212 residues) of the PLD1-PX domain [77], and this interaction is dissociated within 1 min of EGF signaling. Moreover, this dissociation is involved in PLD activation by EGF. The SH3 domain of PLCγ1 interacts with the P161/P164 residues of the PLD1-PX domain [80], and this interaction is maximally induced within 1 min of EGF signaling. In addition, the interaction between PLCγ1 and PLD1 is important for EGF-induced activations of PLCγ1 and PLD. The EGF-dependent interaction between dynamin and PLD is mediated by the GTPase domain of dynamin and by the PX domain of PLD1, and the complex (PLD1-dynamin) formed is also maximally induced within 1 min of EGF signaling. PLD1-dynamin complex formation correlates with PLD activity and has been implicated in PLD activation by EGF [58]. The R128/R197 residues of the PLD1-PX domain function as an arginine finger which stimulates the GTPase activity of dynamin, and are also involved in EGFR endocytosis [98]. Furthermore, PKCα phosphorylates the T147 residue in PLD1-PX domain [66], and PLD1 phosphorylation by PKC is essential for EGF-stimulated PLD1 activation [67]. Grb2 interacts with the Y169/Y179 residues of the PLD2-PX domain (PLD1-PX-Y186/Y196) [106]. Also, the PLD2-Y169F mutation eliminates PLD2 activity and the PLD2-Y197F mutation upregulates DNA synthesis [106,107]. Although PLD2 interacts with Grb2 regardless of EGF stimulation, Grb2 re-localizes PLD2 to Golgi-like structures after EGF signaling [79]. In addition, PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ can interact with R179 in the PLD1-PX domain. Binding between PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ and PLD1 is required for PDGF-induced PLD1 activation [87], and it has been suggested that the R158

Summarizing (Fig. 2), the PX domain of PLD appears to act as a center that forms multicomplexes with several binding partners (munc-18, PLCγ1, dynamin, PKCα, Grb2, PA, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃). Furthermore, the binding proteins munc-18, PLCγ1, dynamin, and PKCα dynamically associate and dissociate with/from PLD as determined by EGF. Moreover, the levels of the phospholipids PA and PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ are dynamically modulated by EGF. These dynamics are cooperatively regulated by PLD-PX domain, which can merge protein and phospholipid signals on the membrane. We suggest that these properties of the PX domain of PLD spatiotemporally regulate EGF signaling and may importantly determine signaling duration and strength.

## 6. Conclusion and perspectives

Many signaling molecules have been reported to participate in EGF-mediated PLD activation in cell-type dependent manner [40–44], and these EGF-stimulated PLD signals are known to mediate a variety of cellular functions [28,29,31,32,37,38]. As mentioned above, PLD interacts with many signaling molecules via its PX domain in the EGF signaling pathway. More specifically, PLD can sense and mediate lipid as well as protein signaling. Thus, it appears that diverse EGF signals merge at PLD, which translates and then transmits finely regulated downstream signals (Fig. 3). Thus, PLD may serve as signaling hub that has cooperative relationships with multicomponents in the EGF signal transduction pathway. To confirm the existence of interconnected relationships between PLD and the many components of EGF signaling, investigations of the natures of interactions are required to determine whether one binding partner affects interactions between PLD and its other binding partners in vitro and in vivo. In addition, our knowledge of the role played by PLD in EGFR family (erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4) signaling, with the exception EGFR itself, is

Fig. 1. Models of EGFR endocytosis and their dependences on EGF concentration. (A) At low EGF concentration (0.2 nM), binding between EGF and EGFR induces EGFR endocytosis. During endocytosis, dynamin is recruited to the plasma membrane and loads GTP. GTP-loaded dynamin is oligomerized at the necks of vesicles. GTP-dynamin interacts with PLD, which is not activated at low EGF concentrations. Rather under these conditions, the PX domain of PLD serves as a GAP for dynamin. GTP hydrolysis of dynamin by PLD then accelerates EGFR endocytosis. (B) On the other hand, at high EGF concentration (20 nM), EGF binding to EGFR also induces EGFR endocytosis, and as occurs at low EGF concentrations, dynamin loads GTP, and the GTP-dynamin interacts with PLD, which is activated at high EGF concentrations and generates PA, which has been implicated in the process of membrane curvature. Furthermore, PA recruits PtdIns (4)P 5-kinase, which generates PtdIns(4,5)P₂, which in turn recruits endocytic components, such as, AP-2 and AP-180. In addition, PLD serves as a GAP for dynamin. Thus, at high EGF concentrations, PA mainly contributes to the endocytosis of EGFR.

residue of the PLD1-PX domain is critical for its interaction with PA [88,89]. However, the role of PLD1 to PA binding has not been determined.

Munc-18 interacts with the 184–212 region (yellow color) in the PX domain and the SH3 domain of PLCγ1 interacts with P161/P164 residues (blue color) in this domain. Furthermore, the R128/R197 residues (pink color) in this domain serve as an arginine finger for the dynamin-GTPase domain.

limited [103]. Accordingly, the characterization of PLD multicomplexes that participate in erbB2-4 signaling is one of the most important outstanding topics. Finally, malfunctions of EGFR family signaling have been associated with cancer [103,108], and thus, the elucidation of relationships between PLD complexes and signaling of EGFR family members in cancer remains a challenging issue.
