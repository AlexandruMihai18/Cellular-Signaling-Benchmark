Homologs of quorum-sensing *luxR* and *luxI* regulatory genes, *avsR* and *avsI*, were identified in *Agrobacterium vitis* strain F2/5. Compared to other LuxI proteins from related species, the deduced AvsI shows the greatest identity to SinI (71%) from *Sinorhizobium meliloti* Rm1021. AvsR possesses characteristic autoinducer binding and helix-turn-helix DNA binding domains and shares a high level of identity with SinR (38%) from Rm1021. Site-directed mutagenesis of *avsR* and *avsI* was performed, and both genes are essential for hypersensitive-like response (HR) and necrosis. Two hypothetical proteins (ORF1 and ORF2) that are positioned downstream of *avsR-avsI* are also essential for the phenotypes. Profiles of *N*-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) isolated from the wild type and mutants revealed that disruption of *avsI*, ORF1, or ORF2 abolished the production of long-chain AHLs. Disruption of *avsR* reduces long-chain AHLs. Expression of a cloned *avsI* gene in *A. tumefaciens* strain NT1 resulted in synthesis of long-chain AHLs. The necrosis and HR phenotypes of the *avsI* and *avsR* mutants were fully complemented with cloned *avsI*. The addition of synthetic AHLs (*C*~16:1~ and 3-O-*C*~16:1~) complemented grape necrosis in the *avsR*, *avsI*, ORF1, and ORF2 mutants. It was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR that the expression level of *avsI* is regulated by *avsR* but not by *aviR* or *avhR*, two other *luxR* homologs which were previously shown to be associated with induction of a tobacco hypersensitive response and grape necrosis. We further verified that *avsR* regulates *avsI* by measuring the expression of an *avsI::lacZ* fusion construct.

Quorum-sensing (QS) regulation has been identified in many gram-negative bacteria and can be associated with the expression of various genes that control diverse physiological functions, including virulence and disease, in plants and animals. Hallmarks of QS in many gram-negative bacteria are characterized by the presence of LuxR proteins that function as transcriptional regulators and LuxI proteins that function as synthases for AHL signal molecules (9). Most LuxR proteins share relatively low identity (18 to 25%) but possess five highly conserved and several other conserved amino acid residues (42). The X-ray crystal structure of the TraR protein was solved, and the conserved amino acid residues that appear to be associated with pheromone and DNA binding were identified (38, 44).

The structures of AHLs differ with regard to acyl side chain lengths, hydroxyl or oxo substitutions at the third carbon, and by the presence of double bonds. The LuxI family shares four groups of conserved sequences and several essential residues. When mutations are made in such residues, a reduction or loss of AHL synthase activity typically results (13, 28). The crystal structure of EsalI, a synthase for production of 3-O-C~6~-HL in *Pantoea stewartii*, was characterized. It was confirmed as a monomeric and approximately spherical protein with a deep cleft believed to be involved in substrate binding (40). Recently, the crystal structure of LasI (synthase for 3-O-C~12~-HL) in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* was shown to have a six-stranded beta sheet and three alpha helices forming a V-shaped substrate-binding cleft that will accommodate longer acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) (10).

*Agrobacterium vitis* causes crown gall on grapevine, a serious disease that occurs worldwide and results in poor growth and death of vines (2). The process by which *Agrobacterium* spp. causes crown gall has been studied intensively for several years, and it involves the transfer of T-DNA carried on the Ti plasmid from the bacterium to its plant host, where it is expressed (47). In addition, *A. vitis* induces a host-specific necrosis on grape and a hypersensitive-like response (HR) on non-host plants such as tobacco (15). The HR resembles a form of programmed cell death in plants characterized by a rapid localized plant cell death that is associated with resistance against disease. Several species of gram-negative bacteria induce the HR on non-host plants. Initiation of the HR usually involves the delivery of specific effector proteins to the plant cell via a type III secretion system (1, 3) that is encoded by a set of *hrp* (HR and pathogenicity) and *hrc* (HR and conserved) genes that are also essential for induction of the HR. Such genes are often grouped in the bacterial genome on pathogenicity islands. Subsequent interaction of the effectors with plant receptors leads to disease (in a compatible host) or induction of the HR (incompatible response). Many type III secretion system effectors have been functionally identified and can act as double agents in bacterial disease and plant defense (1). Although it has been reported that *A. tumefaciens* induces responses in maize that resemble an HR (12) and that *S. meliloti* induces an oxidative burst leading to localized cell death during the early infection process of alfalfa (32), *A. vitis* is thus far the only member of the Rhizobiaceae that has been shown to cause a rapid collapse and cell death of infiltrated tobacco leaves (15). The *A. vitis* response resembles HRs caused by

Complementation of mutants with AHLs. Volumes of 2 μl AHL extracted from F2/5 were added to tubes, dried in a fume hood, and then mixed with *avsI* mutant, *avsR* mutant, ORF1 mutant, or ORF2 mutant (overnight cultures) suspended to an optical density at 600 nm (OD~600~) of 1.5 in sterile distilled water. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min to 1 h, and then the cells were infiltrated into tobacco leaves and inoculated on grape shoot explants. Controls consisted of F2/5, *avsI* mutant, *avsR* mutant, ORF1 mutant, and ORF2 mutant cultures and distilled water.

Complementation of *avsI* mutant was also attempted by adding individual synthetic AHLs to cultures. Approximately 6.5 μM of synthetic AHLs (3-O-C~8~, C~14:1~, C~16:1~, and 3-O-C~16:1~) (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to *avsI* mutant suspensions as described above. These synthetic AHLs were tested because we have determined that they are produced by F2/5 (unpublished data).

Cloning of *avsR* and *avsI* and complementation. Complementation of *avsR* mutant and *avsI* mutant was done by methods previously described in our laboratory (14). Primers, *avsR*-F1 and *avsR*-R1 as well as *avsI*-F1 and *avsI*-R1, containing EcoRI and PstI restriction sites, respectively, were designed to amplify *avsR* and *avsI* from F2/5 genomic DNA (Table 2). The genes were cloned into broad-host-range vector pPROBE-AT (25) and pPZP201 with the *Plac* promoter (11), respectively, and transformed into DH5α competent cells. Positive colonies were selected on LB plates containing appropriate antibiotics. The consensus clones (pAT-*avsR* and pPZP-*avsI*) in the recombinant plasmid were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. During this process, two clones of *avsI* construction (complement mutant 2 [Comp.2] and Comp.3) that differed by two and three amino acid residues, respectively, from the consensus clone were also evaluated in complementation tests. Clones of pAT-*avsR* and pPZP-*avsI* were conjugated into *avsR* mutant and *avsI* mutant, respectively, by tri-parental mating using *E. coli* helper strain HB101 (pRK2013). Transformants were selected on AB (plus 10% mannitol) minimal medium containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) or spectinomycin (400 μg/ml) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and were verified by PCR. Resulting transconjugants were tested for their ability to cause tobacco HR and grape necrosis. Similarly, the *avsI* consensus clone was also transferred to *avsR* mutant and tested for the ability to cause HR and grape necrosis. Plasmid pPZP-*avsI* was also electroporated to *A. tumefaciens* strain NT1 competent cells. Resulting transformants were verified by PCR and analyzed for AHL production as described above.

Plasmid and promoter fusion construction. To construct a *lacZ* reporter fusion, the promoter region containing an apparent *lux* box motif, positioned between the convergently oriented *avsR-avsI* pair, was amplified from F2/5 genomic DNA by primers *avsRI*-F1 and *avsRI*-R1, each having appropriate restriction sites (Table 2). The resultant 299-bp fragment was purified, digested, and cloned into pKP302 vector containing a promoterless *lacZ* with its own ribosome-binding site (27). The construct (pKP-RI) was introduced into *E. coli* DH5α and then tested for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids pAT-*avsR* and pKP-RI were cotransformed into *E. coli* DH5α and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The pPROBE-*aviR* consensus clone was obtained as described previously (45). Similarly, pGT-*aviR* was also coexpressed with the *avsI::lacZ* reporter and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. First, β-galactosidase activities were assessed by streaking cultures on antibiotic-amended LB plates with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside and with or without AHLs extracted from F2/5. The intensity of colony color was visualized after 24 to 48 h at 37°C. β-Galactosidase activity was then quantified according to the Miller method (31). The assay was repeated three times, and the average was calculated for comparison.

Sequence comparison. The sequences of the *avsR-avsI* cluster were analyzed and compared to homologous regions of *A. tumefaciens* C58 and *S. meliloti* Rm1021 genomes. DNA sequence homology searches were performed with Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithms provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Analyses of DNA and deduced protein sequences were carried out with DNASTAR software.

RT-PCR. It was determined whether the currently identified *luxR* homologs in *A. vitis* are expressed in a hierarchical manner and whether *avsR-avsI* with ORF1 and ORF2 are expressed as an operon. Expression of *aviR*, *avhR*, *avsR*, *avsI*, ORF1, and ORF2 was measured by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Total RNAs were isolated from overnight PDB cultures (OD~600~ = 1.4 to 1.5, corresponding to 3 × 10⁹ to 5 × 10⁹ CFU/ml of F2/5, M1154, M1320, and *avsR* mutant) using the TRI-Reagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to prevent DNA contamination, and then PCRs were run using the treated RNA samples as templates to verify the absence of contaminating DNA. RT-PCR was conducted with a Superscript One-Step RT-PCR system plus Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. Primers for determining expression of *aviR* (*aviR*-F and *aviR*-R), for *avhR*

AHL production similarly to the *avsI* mutant (Fig. 3A). ORF3 contains 474 nt encoding a putative 157-amino-acid bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP) that has identity with AGRc3362 (70%) and SMc00524 (62%). BCP is reported as a new member of the thiol-specific antioxidant protein (TSA)/alkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase C (AhpC) family, acting as a general hydroperoxide peroxidase (18). Mutation in ORF3 does not appear to affect AHL production (data not shown).

Sequence comparisons revealed that *avsI*, *avsR*, ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 have homologs in the circular chromosome of Rm1021 and C58, except that *avsR-avsI* is not present in C58 (Fig. 4). All ORFs were first identified in the S4 genome, and subsequently their presence was confirmed in F2/5 by PCR cloning and sequencing. The relative order and orientation of the related genes are identical in F2/5, C58, and Rm1021, except for greater distances between ORF1 and ORF2 in C58 and Rm1021, as shown in Fig. 4.

**Phenotypes and complementation of mutants.** Mutations in *avsR*, *avsI*, ORF1, or ORF2 resulted in an HR-negative phenotype on tobacco leaves infiltrated with cells from 24-h-old cultures adjusted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of about 1.5 (Fig. 5A). Grape necrosis was noticeably reduced in the *avsR* mutant but to an even greater extent by *avsI*, ORF1, and ORF2 mutants (Fig. 5B and 6A). Mutation in ORF3 did not affect HR or necrosis (data not shown). HR was complemented in *avsI* mutant by adding AHLs extracted from F2/5, whereas extracts from *avsI* mutant did not complement the mutant (data not shown); however, the complementation is not consistent, in that all of the leaf panels with the complemented *avsI* mutant did not express an HR in repeated experiments. The necrosis phenotype was consistently complemented in *avsI* mutant, *avsR* mutant, ORF1 mutant, and ORF mutants by adding AHLs extractions from F2/5 (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, HR and necrosis of *avsI* mutant and *avsR* mutant were complemented following transformation with pZP-*avsI* (Fig. 5). HR and necrosis of *avsR* mutant were also complemented following transformation with pAT-*avsR* (data not shown). The complemented *avsI* mutant produced the same AHL profile as F2/5 (Fig. 3B, Comp. 1); complemented *avsR* mutant also exhibited a wild-type AHL profile (data not shown). During the cloning of *avsI*, one clone (Comp. 2) that differed from the consensus clone by only two amino acid substitutions (Asp108Gly and Ala166Thr) (Fig. 2) was not able to complement the HR and produced a noticeably reduced signal for the presence of long-chain AHLs (Fig. 3B). Another clone (Comp. 3) with three amino acid substitutions (Arg64Trp, Leu87Pro, and Leu158Ile) (Fig. 2) also was unable to complement the HR and produced a very faint signal for long-chain AHLs (Fig. 3B).

To identify specific AHLs that were able to complement *avsI* mutant, different synthetic AHLs were added to cul-

mutant (A) from F2/5. (B) Mutant *avsI* and complemented mutant *avsI* (marked as Comp. 1, Comp. 2, and Comp. 3, respectively) and from F2/5. (C) NT1 containing pZP and NT1 containing pZP-*avsI*. Volumes of 10 μl from each extraction were spotted and separated on C<sub>18</sub> reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography plates developed with methanol-water (70:30) and were visualized following overlay with *Agrobacterium* sensor strain NTL4(pZLR4). S represents a mixture of standard unsubstituted AHLs as indicated.

tures. The HR was not complemented with 3-O-$C_8$-HL, $C_{14:1}$-HL, $C_{16:1}$-HL, or 3-O-$C_{16:1}$-HL. However, addition of $C_{14:1}$-HL to $avsl$ mutant resulted in a relatively weak necrosis phenotype, and addition of $C_{16:1}$-HL and 3-O-$C_{16:1}$-HL resulted in necrosis at wild-type levels (Fig. 6B).

$avsR$ affects the expression of $avsl$. The expressions of the putative QS-associated genes $aviR$, $avhR$, $avsR$, and $avsl$ in F2/5 (HR and necrosis positive), M1154 (HR and necrosis negative), M1320 (HR negative and necrosis reduced), and $avsR$ mutant (HR negative and necrosis reduced) were determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 7). $aviR$ is expressed in F2/5, M1320, and the $avsR$ mutant; similarly, $avhR$ is expressed in F2/5, M1154, and the $avsR$ mutant. The expression of $avsR$ appears to be reduced in M1154 compared to F2/5 and M1320. The expression of $avsl$ was shown as a faint signal in the $avsR$ mutant compared to F2/5, M1154, and M1320, suggesting that the expression level of $avsl$ is regulated by $avsR$ but not by $aviR$ or $avhR$. These results conform to the QS model that would assume a basal-level expression of the AHL synthase gene in the absence of its transcriptional regulator (24, 33). The levels of expression of ORF1 and ORF2 appear to be the same in F2/5 and the $avsR$ mutant, indicating that the expressions of these putative genes are not dependent on $avsR$ (data not shown).

To confirm $avsR$ is involved in regulation of $avsl$ expression, two plasmids (pKP-RI and pAT-$avsR$ as well as pKP-RI and pGT-$aviR$) were introduced into *E. coli* DH5α which produce no detectable β-galactosidase activity. The reporter strain pKP-RI alone containing $avsl::lacZ$ shows basal level β-galactosidase activity (Table 3). The strain harboring pKP-RI and pGT-$aviR$ shows no difference for β-galactosidase activity, indicating $aviR$ does not affect $avsl$ expression, as was also shown by RT-PCR. The strain expressing both $avsR$ and $avsl::lacZ$ shows a slight increase for β-galactosidase activity. The addition an ethyl acetate extract of F2/5 results in slightly increased β-galactosidase

and that these ORFs are not apparently regulated by *avsR*. We hypothesize that ORF1 and ORF2 encode proteins involved in the synthesis pathways of the long-chain AHLs that are essential for expression of HR and necrosis. AHLs derive their invariant homoserine lactone rings from the substrate S-adenosyl-L-methionine and their variable acyl chains from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) pool (28). Employing an in vitro fatty acid-3-O-AHL synthesis system, it was demonstrated that the minimum Fab-3-O-AHL biosynthetic pathway includes Fab (fatty acid biosynthesis) proteins, ACP, and the LasI synthase (17). ORF1 and ORF2 in *A. vitis* reported here may encode unique ACP or Fab proteins that interact with AvsI. Further work needs to be done to determine how ORF1 and ORF2 are involved in long-chain AHL synthesis. Thin-layer chromatography assays provided evidence that short-chain AHLs in F2/5 are not affected by the mutations in *avsR*, *avsI*, ORF1, or ORF2. Therefore, more than one AHL synthase must exist in F2/5. To support this hypothesis, we recently characterized a putative *luxI* homolog (unpublished data) residing in one of the conjugal F2/5 plasmids (36). In this case, the gene shares a high degree of similarity to *traI* of C58. It may be that as in C58, the short-chain AHLs are involved in conjugal transfer of the plasmid.

Mutational studies of AHL synthases, LuxI, RhlI, and EsaI have shown that several residues near the N terminus are essential for gene function, including Arg23, Glu42, Asp44, Asp47, Arg70, Glu101, Ser103, and Arg104 (13, 28, 40). The structural analysis of LasI revealed that Arg154 and Lys150 are associated with acyl-ACP binding and provides an explanation for the specificity between the AHL synthase and the acyl chain length (10). In our case with the deduced AvsI protein, nonfunctional clones Comp.2 and Comp.3 differed from the consensus clone in only two and three residues that have not previously been recognized as being essential for synthase activity. It will be interesting to determine more completely which residues are essential for AvsI function and whether they are also essential for SinI.

The addition of AHLs extracted from F2/5 to the *avsI* mutant culture complemented both the necrosis and the HR phenotypes. When different synthetic AHLs were added to *avsI* mutant, however, only necrosis was complemented at different efficiencies depending on the specific AHL. The strongest necrosis responses were observed following addition of C<sub>16:1</sub>-HL and 3-O-C<sub>16:1</sub>-HL, indicating that one or both of them may be the cognate AHL for a regulator that plays a critical role in necrosis induction. As indicated above, the complementation of HR was inconsistent and could have resulted from timing of AHL exposure to the mutant or insufficient concentration of AHL for regulation of bacterial gene expression that is required for HR.

It is interesting that the two hypothetical proteins (ORF1 and ORF2) located directly downstream of *avsR-avsI* are also necessary for long-chain AHL production, HR, and necrosis.

quired to induce the HR. In contrast, consistent complementation of HR is obtained with cloned *avsI* (pPZP-avsI). Former studies suggested that the development of HR and necrosis (disease) are similar processes, their induction requires different numbers of bacteria, and their development proceeds at different rates (1). A recent analysis of large-scale mRNA expression in *P. syringae*-Arabidopsis-compatible and -incompatible interactions documents the similarity of the responses and how they differ primarily in their timing. The report also suggests that a common signal transduction pathway underlies both responses (37). Efforts are under way in our laboratory to determine mechanisms associated with necrosis and the HR and how QS regulation is involved.

Recently, we demonstrated that the deduced AvhR protein has several substitutions in residues that were reported as conserved in known functional LuxR homologs (14). The putative AvsR protein has five amino acid substitutions located in the AHL binding domain that are predicted to be involved in pheromone binding. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that LuxR proteins comprise two families with different functions and structures (21). Family A, including TraR, requires binding of its cognate AHL, *N*-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, for proper protein folding and dimerization into its active form and for protection against proteolysis (30, 46). A similar scenario was also demonstrated for LuxR in *V. fischeri* and LasR in *P. aeruginosa* (20). In contrast, binding of pheromone for functionality is not necessary in family B. For example, CarR and ExpR in *Erwinia carotovora* have been shown to bind the promoter in the absence of autoinducer, and EsaR is inactivated in the presence of autoinducer (26, 41). In addition, CarR functions independently of AHL to control carbapenem antibiotic synthesis in *Serratia marcescens* (7). Therefore, an interesting question is whether the substitutions that are apparent at conserved amino acids affect binding of the cognate AHL in AvsR. The promoter region of *avsI* possesses a conspicuous *lux* box motif and was used to construct an *avsI::lacZ* reporter fusion. We found AvsR (and not AviR) activates *avsI::lacZ* expression consistently but weakly with or without adding AHLs. A similar result was observed with *sinI*; it was shown to be weakly controlled by *sinR* in microarray analysis in *S. meliloti*, although AHL production was affected in a *sinR* mutant (16). We speculate that as in *S. meliloti*, there is a complex QS network in F2/5, and *avsR-avsI* is not at the top of the QS hierarchy. AviR does not activate *avsI::lacZ* reporters in the presence or absence of AHLs, confirming that they do not bind the *avsI* promoter and regulate *avsI* expression. We speculate that AviR may bind on AHL for activity, because it possesses all the conserved residues of that AHL binding domain identified in TraR (44). In a previous work, we demonstrated that *aviR* regulates expression of a gene that encodes a putative dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and also has an upstream motif suggestive of a *lux* box (45). A *lacZ* fusion will also be made to the putative *lux* box promoter region of this gene to determine the cognate AHL for AviR. The identification of the cognate AHLs for other LuxR proteins in *A. vitis* that are associated with induction of HR and necrosis are under investigation. It will be important to determine whether the functionality of these regulatory proteins is dependent on AHL binding.

Gene phylogenies of LuxR and LuxI families in Pseudomo-

nas species suggest a complex process of lateral transfers, ancestral duplication, and gene loss. It has been proposed that microbial species obtain *luxR-luxI* genes through horizontal gene transfer (21). We find that all of the predicted proteins flanking the *avsR-luxI* genes have corresponding homologs in Rm1021. SinR-SinI is responsible for the production of long-chain AHLs (24). AvsI not only shares unusual high homology with SinI (71%) but also affects long-chain AHL production similarly. Earlier, we reported that AviR shares high homology with ExpR of Rm1021 and AvhR shares homology with two Rm1021 *luxR* homologs (SMc00877 and SMc00878) (14, 45). This suggests that these LuxR homologs in *A. vitis* and *S. meliloti* have arisen from the same ancestral genome by duplications and followed by speciation. It is interesting that AvsR-AvsI homologs are not present in C58, though the orientation and arrangement of bordering gene homologs are conserved. It appears, therefore, that C58 either never obtained AvsR-AvsI genes from the ancestral genome or lost it during evolution. A comparison of the *avsR-avsI*, *aviR*, and *avhR* bordering genes in these three members of Rhizobiaceae indicates a close relationship, although there are evident rearrangements and deletions.

In *A. vitis* we have identified functional *aviR* and *avhR* that reside in the genome with no nearby *luxI* partner. Together with the presence of *avsR-avsI*, this indicates a complex quorum-sensing network that regulates interactions between the bacterium and plants. Several other bacteria also employ multiple quorum-sensing systems; some of them are known to function in a hierarchical manner to regulate diverse phenotypes (42). From RT-PCR results, we show that *aviR*, *avhR*, and *avsR* are expressed independently. We previously demonstrated that *aviR* affects the production of AHLs (44) and now have determined that it does not regulate *avsI*. Therefore, it may be that *avsI* produces the AHL(s) that serves as the cognate for *aviR*. All three of the presently known *luxR* homologs in *A. vitis* affect HR and necrosis; however, only the disruption of *aviR* completely abolishes the necrosis phenotype, and the phenotype of *avsI* mutant is highly reduced in necrosis. We predict, therefore, that function of AviR may require a specific AHL synthesized by AvsI; however, this scenario now needs to be confirmed.

A main goal of our research is to determine a basic understanding of genetic mechanisms used by *A. vitis* in plant interactions. We have begun to identify QS circuits that are involved in regulation of the interactions and will continue to focus on target genes and their products. Such results will add to our general understanding of plant-microbe interactions and may help to identify novel disease control strategies.
