## Abstract

Growth hormone (GH) released from pituitary under direct control of hypothalamic releasing (i.e., GHRH) and inhibiting (i.e., sst or SRIF) hormones is an anabolic hormone that regulates metabolism of proteins, fats, sugars and minerals in mammals. Cyril Bowers' discovery of GH-releasing peptide (GHRP-6) was followed by a search for synthetic peptide and nonpeptide GH-secretagogues (GHSs) that stimulate GH release, as well as a receptor(s) unique from GHRH receptor. GHRH and GHSs operate through distinct G protein-coupled receptors to release GH. Signal transduction pathways activated by GHS increase intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration in somatotrophs, whereas GHRH increases cAMP. Isolation and characterization of ghrelin, the natural ligand for GHS receptor, has opened a new era of understanding to physiology of anabolism, feeding behavior, and nutritional homeostasis for GH secretion and gastrointestinal motility through gut-brain interactions. Other peptide hormones (i.e., motilin, TRH, PACAP, GnRH, leptin, FMRF amide, galanin, NPY, NPW) from gut, brain and other tissues also play a role in modulating GH secretion in livestock and lower vertebrate species. Physiological processes, such as neurotransmission, and secretion of hormones or enzymes, require fusion of secretory vesicles at the cell plasma membrane and expulsion of vesicular contents. This process for GH release from porcine somatotrophs was revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemical distribution of the cells in pituitary during stages of development.

1. **Introduction**

   Growth hormone (GH) produced by somatotrophs of the adenohypophysis is the anabolic hormone crucial for long bone growth, muscle accretion, energy homeostasis and the metabolism of proteins, sugars, fats, and minerals in mammals. A series of stimulatory and inhibitory releasing hormones of hypothalamic and peripheral origins controls the pulsatile release of GH from somatotrophs. Until recently, the consensus was that two antagonistic hypothalamic peptides: a stimulatory GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and an inhibitory somatostatin-14 (sst or SRIF) controlled the pulsatile pattern of GH secretion [1,2]. GH participates in its own rhythmic secretion through feedback action on GHRH and SRIF neurons [3]. GHRH and SRIF receptors belong to the family of seven transmembrane receptors coupled to a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein. SRIF receptor and subtypes are coupled to a G<sub>i</sub> protein and its activation inhibits adenylate cyclase. The GHRH receptor is coupled to a G<sub>s</sub> protein and its activation stimulates adenylate cyclase activity that results in increased intracellular cyclic AMP and protein kinase A levels. GHRH, a 1–44 amino-acid peptide, and its analogs (i.e., human pancreatic GRF [hp GRF(1,40)OH; Nle<sup>27</sup>rGRF(1,29)NH<sub>2</sub>; rhGRF(1–32)OH] are potent releasers of GH in vivo in cattle [4,5] and pigs [6].

### 1.1. Peptidyl and non-peptidyl GH-secretagogues

In 1976, C.Y. Bowers et al., working with Met enkephalin, discovered a series of small peptides called GH-releasing peptides (GHRP) with potent GH-releasing activity in cultured pituitary cells [7–11]. Thus, the first GHRP was synthesized before the isolation of GHRH in 1982 by Guillemain et al. [12] and Rivier et al. [13]. GHRPs were initially based on an opioid structure, but they lack opioid activity. A great number of peptidyl and non-peptidyl GH-secretagogues (GHS) have been developed that effectively release GH when administered intravenously, subcutaneously, intranasally and orally [11,14]. Non-peptidyl classes of benzolactam and spiroindolamine GHS (i.e., L-692,429, L-692,585, L-163,255, MK-677) with some improved oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties were developed [1,15–17].

### 1.2. GHS receptor and ghrelin

Earlier biological studies revealed a complementary and synergistic action by co-administration of GHS and GHRH on GH release in rat, pig, cattle and monkey [6,17]. Although GHS and GHRH were considered to act on different receptors, Howard et al. in 1996 isolated a receptor in pituitary and hypothalamus that was unique for GHS action on GH release [18]. The seven transmembrane GHS receptor (GHSR) showed a high degree of homology in human, pig, dog, rat and mouse ranging from 93 to 99% identity [14,18–21]. Thus, GHSR was a classic orphan receptor until 1999 when Kojima et al. reported the natural ligand isolated from stomach and they designated the GH-releasing peptide ‘ghrelin’ [22]. With this chronology, discussion of the physiology of GHS-related peptides will be followed by the physiology of ghrelin focused primarily on livestock species.

## 2. Physiological control of GH release in vivo

### 2.1. GH secretion and somatic growth

Somatic growth in vertebrates is thought to be dependent on pituitary GH; without pituitary GH production or peripheral GH action, postnatal growth is severely stunted [23–26]. For example, a deficiency in GH production or GH receptor (GHR) gene has been demonstrated to stunt growth [27]. A notable exception is the guinea pig, in which hypophysectomy does not alter growth rate, and treatment with bovine GH (bGH) does not affect growth or increase insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels [28–30]. GH secretion in the guinea pig is pulsatile and controlled by endogenous GHRH and SRIF, and possibly a GHRPR [31]. GHR is expressed in various tissues and binds guinea pig GH, but an unusual binding specificity of guinea pig GH-binding protein (GHBP) being highly heterogeneous in molecular weight and binding affinities with a more generalized binding affinity for ovine- and bovine-GH than human-GH [32,33]. The percent specific GHBP in sera from domestic animals reveal considerable differences (i.e., bovine 5.3%, ovine 5.4%, porcine 19.0%, chicken 10.0%, goose 14.1%, equine 26.1%) [34].

### 2.2. Neuroendocrine regulation of GH secretion and somatic growth

The hypothalamus regulates episodic GH secretion from the pituitary partly by its endogenous release of GHRH, SRIF, ghrelin, GH and other hypothalamic neuropeptide hormones affecting feeding behavior and satiety [11,20,35–37]. The neurohypophyseal link between the hypothalamus and the pituitary is essential for connecting these releasing and inhibiting hormones affecting endogenous GH secretion [6,23]. In the young animal, episodic GH secretion occurs during stages of rapid growth and wanes during maturity and senescence. Although aging animals and humans lack robust episodic GH secretion, the pituitary is fully capable of responding to GHRH or GHS challenge with supraphysiological GH release. In vivo approaches such as stalk sectioning, hypothalamic deafferentation, and hypophysectomy provide strong evidence for the neuroendocrine control of GH release. Less clear is the role of episodic GH release in long-term growth.

GH produced by specific cells (somatotrophs and somatomammotrophs) within the adenohypophysis, is secreted into peripheral blood during fetal development. From 40 to 115 days gestation in the pig (term 116 days), there is a steady increase in serum GH concentration harvested from umbilical arterial blood (Fig. 1). At day 40, serum levels of 3–4 ng/ml increase to 50 ng/ml by day 60, peak by day 80 to 100–115 ng/ml, and remain elevated until parturition [38]. The pattern of GH secretion closely follows fetal development (Fig. 1).

In vivo models coupled with molecular approaches have provided insight into the role of a member of the POU-domain family of genes, POU1F1 (also previously known as PIT-1 or GHF1) in the control of GH. It also is a positive regulator for prolactin (PRL), and thyroid-stimulating hormone β (TSHβ) in several mammalian species including the pig. A role of POU1F1 in the control of GH expression is indicated from polymorphisms at POU1F1 that are associated with growth and other performance traits (i.e., fatness, carcass composition) in the pig [39-41]. In Chinese Meishan pigs, segregating at *MspI* POU1F1 polymorphism, there were effects on GH mRNA and on the circulating concentrations of GH at birth,

but not thereafter [42]. At birth, plasma GH ranges from 25 to 35 ng/ml and decreases to 5–10 ng/ml by days 15 and 30; GH pmol/µg mRNA also decreases in a similar pattern during this time [40,42]. GH secretion is required for growth and nitrogen retention in this species; hypophysectomy arrests growth in the young pig and GH treatment restores growth [43]. GH secretion is pulsatile in all species studied [44–48]. These episodic rhythms at approximately 3-h intervals likely reflect GH-mediated feedback that increases SRIF tone at the hypothalamus and pituitary gland and attenuates GHRH and GH release. Experimental evidences suggest GH periodicity being self-entraining [14]. Hypothalamic deafferentation abolishes pulsatile GH secretion in the pig [49]. The circulating blood concentration in intact pigs and calves reaches peaks of 5–7 ng/ml with basal levels of about 1 ng/ml; hypophyseal stalk transection (HST) abolishes episodic GH release in young pigs, calves and sheep (Figs. 2 and 3) [50–52]. Thus, the porcine, bovine, and ovine somatotroph would appear to be independent of hypothalamic influence on both GH synthesis and basal secretion, but is dependent on the hypothalamus for the hormone’s episodic release profile.

Although stalk sectioning has a marked effect on decreasing pituitary size in calves and young pigs, the isolated gland continues to sustain a basal level of GH secretion (Table 1). A study on long-term growth in beef calves, clearly showed that although cattle depend on the pituitary for GH to sustain growth, episodic secretion of GH is not essential for long-term growth. Indeed growth can continue during a prolonged period in the complete absence of pulsatile GH release; however, hypophysectomy completely arrests growth in this species (Fig. 4).

Adrenal and thyroid gland development is sustained after HST, but thyroxine and triiodothyronine secretion are greatly reduced compared with SOC (Table 1). Adrenal and

thyroid development after hypophysectomy causes a marked decrease in gland size, histology and function as indicated by hypothyroidism. The intravenous injection of GHRH in intact or HST calves and pigs resulted in an equivalent dose-dependent peak release of GH [4,53]. SRIF infused intravenously greatly decreased GHRH-induced GH secretion in HST and SOC calves and pigs [4,6].

Pulsatile GH release appears to be related to reduced GHRH secretion and increased SRIF secretion during GH troughs [54,55]. When GHRH and SRIF were monitored in the hypothalamic-pituitary portal vessels of conscious sheep and pigs, one ovine study revealed simultaneous GH and GHRH peaks associated with a fall in SRIF 48% of the time [56], whereas the other ovine study showed a 62% match of GH and GHRH peaks (*P* < 0.02) without a significant correlation with SRIF troughs [57]. Using a transorbital approach in the pig, Drisko et al. found a closer correlation of GH peaks with SRIF troughs (63%) than with GHRH peaks (33%) [58,59].

## 3. Physiology of GHS and related peptides

### 3.1. Effects of hypophyseal stalk section on GHS-induced GH secretion

The effects of the GHS, L-692,585, were examined in hypothalamic-pituitary stalk-sectioned (HST) pigs to determine whether the higher levels of GH release depend on the presence of hypothalamic factors such as GHRH [6]. Before surgery, animals were treated with L-692,585 + GHRH, and blood was collected to measure GH. The magnitude of GH release was highest in the L-692,585-treated animals. When L-692,585 and GHRH were injected together, the GH response was more than additive. The pigs were next separated into two groups, one group was subjected to HST and the other to sham transection. Each group was again treated with the secretagogues and the GH response measured. The magnitude of GH secretion was markedly diminished in the stalk-transected animals treated with L-692,585 (Fig. 5 for comparison of GH responses post-HST and post-sham). When the same stalk-transected pigs were treated with GnRH and CRH, normal LH and ACTH responses were measured, demonstrating that surgical intervention had not compromised the functional integrity of the pituitary gland [60].

Experiments in HST pigs showed that a peptidomimetic GHS required an intact hypothalamic-pituitary axis for optimal GH release [6]. Human subjects with hypothalamic-pituitary stalk disconnection fail to respond to the GHS, hexarelin, [61,62]. The presence of endogenous GHRH is crucial for the effect of GHSs in human, as established in these clinical studies in patients with pituitary stalk section. However, animal studies were still able to demonstrate GH release after the transection of the pituitary stalk [6,52]. These discrepancies may result from more complex destruction of the hypothalamic-pituitary area in the patients studied. The patients were more heterogeneous in terms of age, cause

of the pituitary-hypothalamic disconnection, and underlying diseases, than the groups of experimental animals.

### 3.2. Effects of intracerebroventricular injection of GHS on GH secretion

GH response to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) GHRP-6 injection was higher than that observed after systemic administration of the same dose [63], supporting the assumption of hypothalamic action of GHS. Anesthesia reduced the amplitude of GH response to GHS providing additional for extrapituitary action of GHS. Acute intravenous injection of GHRP-6 was able to evoke GH release in hypothalamo-pituitary disconnected (HPD) sheep (wethers and ewes) indicating a pituitary site of action for this peptide; GHRP-6 was less potent than GHRH. The response to GHRP-6 was 5-fold smaller in intact animals and 15-fold smaller in HPD animals; this difference may be explained by a stimulating effect of GHRP-6 on GHRH neurons and suggests that a component of GHRP-6 action is mediated through the hypothalamus [52].

In intact pigs, i.c.v. administration of L-692,585 caused an abrupt GH peak release (>50 ng/ml) in plasma, but did not have a direct stimulatory effect on adrenal cortisol secretion [64,65]. Intravenous administration of GHRP-2 in calves [66] and L-692,585 in pigs [65] augmented similar peak plasma concentrations (110 ng/ml) when co-administered with GHRH. Chronic central infusion of GHS induces increased neuronal activity and Fos protein expression in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus [67,68]. The i.c.v. injection of SRIF attenuated GHS-induced Fos protein expression in the arcuate nucleus suggesting a central inhibitory control by somatostatin [69]. The GHS, L-163,255, is a potent orally active spiropiperidine on GH release in swine [70]. The in vivo GH secretagogue activity of L-163,255 in swine resembles that of the substituted benzolactam GHSs, L-692,429, L-692,585 and L-700,653, but has greater oral potency [71]. Several substance P antagonists inhibit the GH response to GHSs, but not GHRH. The most potent antagonist is [D-Arg¹,

d-Phe⁵,d-Trp⁷,⁹,Leu¹¹]-substance P (L-756,867) having an IC₅₀ value of 0.2 μM in inhibiting L-692,429-induced GH release of from pituitary cells [72]. This antagonist impaired the ability of L-692,429 to potentiate the effect of GHRH on GH release. Furthermore, the L-756,867 administered intravenously blocked GHS-induced GH release, but not GHRH-induced GH release. This suggests that GHSs and the L-756,867 substance P antagonist stimulate GH release via a common receptor.

The stimulatory effect of GHS on PRL secretion is modest, dose-dependent, and within the normal physiological range of basal PRL level [73,74]. The stimulatory effect of GHS on the activity of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis seems independent of sex but shows age-related variations. Whereas GHS do not stimulate ACTH release from pituitary cells in culture [75], basal cortisol concentrations were reduced post-surgery in HST pigs relative to the SOC group [6]. The response to CRH challenge in the HST group suggests that the decrease is associated with decreased secretory stimulus rather than decreased synthesis. The modest ACTH-releasing activity of GHSs could be, in part, dependent on CRH- and AVP-mediated mechanisms [36]. The plasma LH response to GnRH in HST and SOC pigs was similar [6].

### 3.3. GHRH neurosecretory terminals

The major function of GHRH, released from neurosecretory terminals in the median eminence, is to stimulate the release and synthesis of GH. GHRH is expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus together with other tissues, for example, intestine, gonads, immune tissues, and the placenta. GHRH-immunoreactive (-IR) neurons have been identified in coronal and sagittal frozen sections of bovine and porcine hypothalamus [76]. Rounded bipolar GHRH-IR perikarya are localized in ventrolateral regions of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in both species. GHRH-immunoreactive fibers projected ventrally into the median eminence (ME) in both species.

In prepubertal female calves, the peak amplitude of the GH response to intravenous administration of GHRH was greater before feeding than after feeding [4]. Feeding also reduced the activity of immunoreactive GHRH neurons in the arcuate nucleus and of immunoreactive SRIF neurons in the periventricular nucleus and ARC in castrate male cattle [77]. GHRH-induced secretion of GH after feeding was associated with decreased activity of GHRH neurons in the ARC and decreased activity of SRIF neurons in the periventricular nucleus.

GHRH-induced signal transduction involves Gₛ-protein, adenylate cyclase (isoform II and/or IV), cyclic 3′,5′ adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and protein kinase A. There is a cAMP response element (CRE) upstream from the coding region of the GH gene. GHRH increases GH expression (e.g., cattle [78]; chickens [79,80]). Intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations are increased by GHRH. This involves both influx of Ca²⁺ (via L- and T-type voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ channels) and by phospholipase C hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, leading to mobilizing intracellular Ca²⁺ stores.

### 3.4. SRIF and NPY neurosecretory terminals

A major function of SRIF is suppressing the release, but not synthesis, of GH by the somatotroph [2]. SRIF-IR neurons have been identified in bovine and porcine hypothalamic tissue

[76]. Bipolar SRIF-IR perikarya are located about the third ventricle in the periventricular nucleus. SRIF-IR fibers project ventrally into the ME. SRIF-IR fibers densely innervate the ventromedial and ARC nuclei in pigs, but are not as distinguishable as in cattle [76]. Double immunostaining reveals a close apposition of SRIF-IR fibers with GHRH-IR perikarya in the ARC and ventromedial nuclei and apposition of SRIF- and GHRH-IR varicosities in the ME [76]. The i.c.v. injection of SRIF attenuated the GH-secretagogue-induced Fos protein expression in the arcuate nucleus suggesting central inhibitory control by somatostatin [82]. The SRIF receptor (sstr) is encoded by five different genes (sstr 1–5; [2]). The dominant sstr influencing GH release from the somatotroph appears to be sstr-2 [81]. Signal transduction involves G-protein-coupled reduction in L- and T-type voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ influx/channels and increased K⁺ channels [2].

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons are scattered throughout the ARC, notably in the ventromedial arcuate nucleus [69,83,84]. A few of the NPY neurons in the ARC likely are neuroendocrine cells since about 30% of GHRH neurons co-express NPY [85]. NPY exerts an inhibitory influence on GH secretion [86]. Neuropeptide W (NPW) is a novel hypothalamic peptide that activates the previously described orphan G protein-coupled receptors, GPR7 and GPR8. Robust expression of GPR7 in the hypothalamus suggests that it may have a role in the modulation of neuroendocrine functions. Both NPY neurons and NPW neurons have a role in the regulation of feeding behavior. Multiple daily injections of NPY into the PVN increases food intake and body weight [87] Activation of these NPY neurons by GHS may be responsible for the acute effects on feeding behavior when administered directly into the brain ventricles without affecting plasma GH concentration [88,89]. In contrast, NPW neurons appear to function as an endogenous catabolic signaling molecule in the brain. NPW was isolated from porcine hypothalamus, and two mature peptides NPW23 and NPW30 bind to and activate both GPR7 and GPR8 at similar doses [90,91]. Central administration of NPW23 increased serum levels of PRL and corticosterone and stimulated food intake and water drinking [92]. Single administration of NPW23 and NPW30 to free-feeding rats suppressed dark phase and fasting-induced food intake at similar effective doses [93]. Continuous i.c.v. infusion of NPW suppressed feeding and body weight gain, whereas i.c.v. administration of anti-NPW IgG stimulated feeding. Thus, NPY and NPW modulate hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis.

### 3.5. Motilin

Motilin is a highly conserved, 22-amino-acid peptide secreted by enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine [94]. This peptide stimulates gastrointestinal motor activity and seems to play a physiological role in the regulation of fasting motility patterns [95]. Both immunoreactive motilin and mRNA expression are found in the gastrointestinal tract, brain, nerves, and other endocrine glands in several species, including monkey, man, pig, sheep, and rabbit [96]. The motilin receptor, designated motilin-R1A (MTLR1A), is a heterotrimeric, guanosine triphosphate-binding, protein (G protein)-coupled receptor. It was isolated from human stomach, and its amino-acid sequence was found to be 52% identical to the human GHSR [97]. The high amino-acid-sequence identity between MTLR1A and the GHSR suggests a role for motilin in the control of GH secretion.

Two forms of peptide YY₃₋₃₆ (PYY₁₋₃₆ and PYY₃₋₃₆) are 36-amino-acid peptides secreted from endocrine L cells in the gastrointestinal tract [98,99]. Besides their local effects on gut motility, they mediate orexigenic behavior by the circulating PYYs concentration being low during fasting and increasing rapidly after a meal [100]. The two forms of PYY play a role in satiety by opposite effects in the central nervous system. In rodent models, PYY₃₋₃₆ administered peripherally or intraperitoneally dose-dependently inhibited food intake [101,102]. PYY₃₋₃₆ acts within the hypothalamus as indicated: (a) PYY₃₋₃₆ administered peripherally induced c-fos expression in arcuate neurons expressing proopiomelanocortin (POMC), a precursor of the anorexigenic peptide, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH); (b) PYY₃₋₃₆ inhibits orexigenic NPY neurons in the ARC, and (c) induces satiety in wild-type and melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R)-deficient mice, but seems to be not dependent on MC4R signaling. In POMC null (POMC−/−) mice which lack all melanocortin ligands (i.e., α-MSH) and in MC4R null (MC4R−/−) mice indicate that the hypothalamic melanocortin system is not required for anorexigenic effects of PYY₃₋₃₆ [102,103]. On the other hand, PYY₃₋₃₆ does not act within the brainstem satiety centers as does cholecystokinin (CCK) at receptors on peripheral vagal afferent terminals and brainstem nucleus of the solitary tract to these appetite centers [102,104].

MC4R and MC3R, G protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptors, are expressed in the brain and hypothalamus of the pig and play an important role in the control of mammalian food intake and energy homeostasis [105–107]. A missense mutation (Asp298Asn) was identified in the porcine MC4R gene which is associated with growth and food intake traits [106]. Sequencing of the MC4R gene of seven diverse genera within Suiformes (i.e., Hippopotamidae [hippos], Tayassuidea [peccaries] and Suidae [pigs]) revealed 62 nucleotide variations of MC4R. A single missense mutation (Asp298Asn) of aspartic acid (Asp) to asparagine (Asn) in MC4R gene decreased cAMP content and MC4R signaling was associated with growth, fatness, and feed intake traits in domestic pigs [106,108]. Stimulation of the MC4-R and MC3-R receptors (agonist) inhibits feed intake and blockade (antagonist) of the receptor increases feed intake [107,109]. Agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and its mRNA produced in the arcuate nucleus is an endogenous antagonist of αMSH at MC3-R and MC4-R [110–112]. AGRP and NPY are overexpressed in db/db and ob/ob mice and results in hyperphagia and obesity [113,114].

## 3.7. Effects of galanin, TRH, PACAP on GH secretion

Galanin, originally isolated from porcine intestine, is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and adrenal medulla of several species (i.e., human, primates, dog, cat, pig, cattle, rodents) [115]. This putative hypothalamic-hypophysiotropic hormone demonstrated significant GH-releasing activity in perfused pituitary slices alone or co-incubated with ME terminals from young male calves [116]. Galanin infusion for 60 min increased basal GH secretion 60% in pituitary slices and 200% in pituitary + medina eminence. Galanin administered i.c.v. stimulates GH release, and galanin-augmented L-692,585-induced GH release in the pig [117]. In contrast, in cultured pituitary GH secreting adenoma cells, galanin inhibits GH release [118–120].

The modified tripeptide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates GH release in cattle [121, 122], fetal pigs [123], and chickens [124]. TRH potentiates the effect of GHRH in postnatal pigs [125] and in chickens [126, 127], but has little effect in sheep [128] or in horses [129]. The in vivo influence of excitatory amino acids (EAA) on GH secretion in pigs indicated that aspartate was a more potent secretagogue of GH secretion than glutamate [130]. Because no stimulation by either EAA of GH secretion by anterior pituitary cells in culture occurred, it was concluded that the stimulatory effect in vivo is mediated primarily at the level of the hypothalamus or higher brain centers.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) is a potent GH secretagogue, and has been proposed as the ancestral releasing factor for GH [131]. PACAP27 and PACAP38 stimulate GH release in vitro from bovine and porcine and chicken somatotrophs [132–134], and in vivo in cattle [135].

### 3.8. Effects of leptin and FMRF amide on GH secretion

Leptin’s effects on GH release appear to be predominately stimulatory and can reverse the inhibitory effect of caloric restriction on longitudinal growth [136]. Leptin receptors have been identified on/in ovine [137] and porcine [138, 139] somatotrophs. Leptin can influence GH release, either stimulating [140, 141] or increasing the responsiveness to GHRH [141–144]. The signal transduction system for leptin appears to by predominantly via JAKII and STAT [145]. Studies, particularly in lower vertebrate species, suggest that somatotrophs are promiscuous in terms of the peptides that will stimulate GH release. In some species of lower vertebrates, CRH has been reported to stimulate GH secretion (i.e., reptiles [146]; fish [147]). The neuropeptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH₂ (FMRF amide), originally described in mollusks, stimulate GH release in amphibians. Similar peptides have been identified in brains of vertebrates (i.e., rat, chicken, frog, carp) with a similar RF amide motif at their C-termini [148–151]. A novel hypothalamic RF amide peptide localized in the hypothalamus of the bullfrog has GH-releasing activity and was designated frog GH-releasing peptide-1 and –2 (fGRP-RP-1 and fGRP-RP-2 [152–153]).

### 3.9. GHS-R homologs

In a search for GHS-R family library members, the human genomic and the pufferfish was selected because of its compact genome and evolutionarily distant (i.e., at least 400 million years) from human and homologous genes [154]. Three GHS-R homologs (GPR38, GPR39, and FM3) were isolated from a human genomic PAC library [21, 155]. GRP38 revealed a 52% identity and 73% similarity to the human GHS-R, and the transmembrane domains show 73–89% similarity. Human/porcine peptide motilin (MTL) has been identified as the endogenous ligand for GRP38, the closest GHS-R family member, whereas adenosine is a partial ligand for GHS-R. Adenosine activates the GHS-R through a site different from that occupied by MK-0677 and GHRP-6 [156]. Adenosine also has an integrative effect in regulating dopamine and γ-aminobutyric acid [157]. MTL is produced in stomach and gastrointestinal tract (GI) and affects gastric motility. High-affinity MTL-binding sites were detected in GI and CNS (i.e., cerebellum) [158]. A high amino acid sequence identity (52%) between MTL-R and GHS-R suggests that their natural ligands may be related.

Constitutive overexpression of the human GHS-R in rat GC cell lines and GHRH neurons resulted in increased basal phosphoinositol turnover and responsive to GHS ligands [159]. This constitutive overexpression of GHS-R is GHRH neurons up-regulates basal activity in the GHRH-GH axis. The interactions of GHSs and GHRH/SRIF in the neuroendocrine system in regulating pulsatile GH secretions may be influenced by the GHS natural peptide, ghrelin. Immunoneutralization of endogenous SRIF reversed the blunted GH response to GHRP-6 at trough times, suggesting that GHRP-6 neither disrupts nor inhibits the cyclic release of endogenous hypothalamic SRIF [160]. In contrast, passive immunization with anti-GHRH serum obliterated the GH responses to GHRP-6, suggesting that GHSs do not act by altering SRIF release, but stimulation of GH release via GHRH-dependent pathways.

## 4. Physiology of ghrelin

### 4.1. Endogenous sources and chemistry of ghrelin

The discovery of the endogenous GHS ligand, ghrelin, has led to new insights into the existence of a gastric-hypothalamic–pituitary axis that provides endocrine control of nutritional homeostasis with GH secretion and gastrointestinal motility [161]. Ghrelin stimulates GH secretion as well as appetite and feed intake by acting on GHR-R₁a in the pituitary and hypothalamus [162–164]. Systemic GH levels exert a negative or positive feedback action on stomach ghrelin homeostasis [165]. For example, GH administration decreased stomach ghrelin mRNA and plasma ghrelin levels. Ghrelin is produced in the chromogranin A-immunoreactive X/A-like endocrine cells located in the mucosal layer of the fundus. These cells are associated with capillary networks that transport secreted ghrelin into the bloodstream for endocrine action. A unique feature of the GHS, ghrelin, is its hydrophobic moiety: an octanoylated linear chain and the ester bond that links the alkyl chain to the serine (Ser³) side chain [22]. The *n*-octanoyl group at Ser³ is required to activate the GHS₁a receptor [166,167]. The amino acid sequence of human ghrelin-28 differs from rat ghrelin at residues 11 and 12 with Arg substituted to Lys and Val substituted to Ala (Fig. 6) [168].

![Rat Ghrelin-28](#)

Fig. 6. Amino acid sequence of rat ghrelin-28, human ghrelin-28, and porcine ghrelin-28. Note the octanoyl modification at the Ser³ residue and the 2 amino acid changes in positions 11 and 12 for the human ghrelin and in positions 12, 22 and 26 for porcine ghrelin compared with rat ghrelin.

Des-Gln<sup>14</sup>-ghrelin has an *n*-octanoyl modification at Ser<sup>3</sup> like ghrelin, and it stimulates GH release when injected into rats. The circulating isoform of ghrelin, des-octanoyl ghrelin; however, does not activate GHS-R<sub>1a</sub> and lacks the endocrine activities of ghrelin [164]. Porcine ghrelin differs from rat ghrelin at residue 12 with Val substituted to Ala, at residue 22 with Ala substituted to Pro and at residue 26 with Lys substituted to Gln (Fig. 6).

### 4.2. Orexigenic effects of ghrelin in CNS

From a cDNA mouse stomach library, a protein designated prepromotilin-related peptide was identical to the rat preproghrelin, a precursor to ghrelin [166]. Thus, the similarities of ghrelin with motilin at ligand (30%) and receptor (50%) led to studies in gastric motility [169]. Central or peripheral injection of ghrelin increases gastric motility and gastric acid secretion; vagotomy abolishes these actions by blocking vagal cholinergic input from the brain to the GI tract [170]. Gastrectomy in rodents and humans decreases circulating concentrations of ghrelin by 70%; however, there also is some ghrelin expression in hypothalamus pituitary, kidney, heart, and immune cells [168,171,172].

The arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus (VM) are sites of abundant GHS-R receptor expression. The ARC contains neurons for orexigenic peptides (i.e., NPY, AGRP, POMC) and the orexigenic effects of ghrelin can be blocked by chemical ablation of the ARC [162,173]. For example, ghrelin, i.c.v., administration causes NPY and AGRP neurons in the ARC to express cFos and Erg-1, markers of neuronal activity, and increased NPY (NPY6) and AGRP mRNA expression [173,174]; antibodies and antagonists of NPY and AGRP abolished ghrelin-induced feeding [173]. Treatment of *Agrp*<sup>−/−</sup>; *Npy*<sup>−/−</sup> and *Mc3r*<sup>−/−</sup>; *Mc4r*<sup>−/−</sup> double knockout mice as well as *Npy*<sup>−/−</sup> and *Agrp*<sup>−/−</sup> single knockout mice with ghrelin demonstrated that NPY and AGRP are required for the in vivo orexigenic effects of ghrelin, as well as the involvement of the melanocortin pathway in ghrelin signaling [175]. Prepromelanin-concentrating hormone yields MCH and neuropeptide EI (NEI). Combined treatment of MCH and GHRH (10 nM each) had an additive stimulatory effect on GH release from fetal pituitary cells [176]. NEI (10 nM) exhibited an even greater GH release by these cultured cells than an equivalent dose of GHRH, and an additive effect on GH release when the cells were treated with both peptides. Although deletion of either NPY or AGRP caused only a modest or nondetectable effect, ablation of both ligands completely abolished the orexigenic action of ghrelin [161,175]. Ghrelin exerts potent GH-releasing activity through pituitary and hypothalamic GHS-R activation [172]. Ghrelin actions at the pituitary can upregulate expression of Pit-1, the transcription factor involved in GH gene expression [177].

### 4.3. Gastric ghrelin on appetite and GH secretion

Ghrelin is the first food intake-stimulatory signal originating from the stomach, and on repeated peripheral or i.c.v. administration induces adiposity and weight gain in rodents [171,178]. Circulating concentrations of ghrelin are elevated by fasting and decreased after refeeding or oral glucose administration, but not by water ingestion [178]. These effects were not observed, however, in ghrelin-treated hypophysectomized, thyroidectomized or

adrenalectomized rats, indicating an essential role for the pituitary axis in ghrelin-induced adiposity [179]. Thus, ghrelin stimulates appetite and induces a positive energy balance leading to body weight gain in addition to its ability to stimulate GH secretion [180]. Ghrelin stimulation of GH release and appetite is mediated through the GHS-R [181]. In GHS-R null mice, acute treatment with ghrelin stimulated neither GH release nor food intake, indicating that GHS-R is a biologically relevant ghrelin receptor [181, 182]. Fasting-induced changes in serum levels of leptin and insulin are identical in wild-type and null mice as are serum IGF-1 levels and body weights. Thus, antagonists of ghrelin likely will not have broad utility as antiobesity agents [181, 182]. Insulin infusion during euglycemia caused a rapid decrease in circulating ghrelin concentration, and remained suppressed during subsequent periods of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia [183]. Despite suppression of ghrelin, GH showed a significant rise during hypoglycemia, suggesting that insulin may suppress circulating ghrelin independently of glucose. Hyperthyroidism also is associated with suppressed circulating ghrelin levels, but ghrelin is not a primary stimulator of appetite and food intake in hyperthyroidism [184].

### 4.4. Synergistic effects of ghrelin and GHRH on GH secretion

Ghrelin and GHRH act synergistically to stimulate GH secretion when administered in vivo, but they act additively when incubated with somatotrophs in vitro [185]. Because ghrelin also is present in the ARC, it may enhance GHRH and impair SRIF and thus contribute to its synergism with GHRH in GH secretion. Pretreatment of rat pituitary cells in vitro with SRIF strongly abolished ghrelin- and /or GHRH-stimulated GH secretion [186]. Ghrelin caused a weaker GH response than GHRH, suggesting that it indirectly affects coordinated GH release from the pituitary, as found in vivo [186]. GHRH, SRIF, and ghrelin or synthetic GHSs act through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR); GHRH activates cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) production approximately twice that observed after activation of the GHRH receptor alone [187]. GHRH activates adenyl cyclase cAMP, and protein kinase A pathways, while ghrelin and synthetic GHSs stimulate phospholipase C activity leading to production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, increase in cytosolic calcium levels, and GH release. This potentiated response is dose-dependent with respect to both GHRH and GHS (ghrelin or synthetic peptide and nonpeptide ligands), and is dependent on the expression of both receptors [187].

Although the strong synergistic relation between synthetic GHS and GHRH with respect to GH secretion in both animals and humans is well known, the combined administration of a synthetic GHS and ghrelin-induced GH response values more than the summed mean GH response values of each peptide alone (*P* < 0.05) [188, 189]. Ghrelin also induces a stimulatory effect on lactotroph and corticotroph secretion [189, 190]. The effects of ghrelin on spontaneous pulsatile GH secretion in conscious, free-moving rodents demonstrate that ghrelin, administered intravenously or i.c.v. exerts potent, time-dependent GH-releasing activity under physiological conditions [191]. Although ghrelin is a functional antagonist of SRIF, its GH-releasing activity at the pituitary is not dependent on inhibiting endogenous SRIF release [191]. However, continuous infusion of synthetic GHS or ghrelin does not stimulate skeletal growth and is associated with desensitization to further GHS treatment as well as elicit an increase in SRIF mRNA expression in the PVN [192].

# 4.5. Peptidyl and non-peptidyl GHS, and ghrelin on intracellular \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) mobilization

Activation of intracellular calcium mobilization—\([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\)—is one of the earliest known cellular signals elicited by nonpeptidyl GHSs (i.e., L-692,585) and by the natural ligand ghrelin [163,193–197]. Ghrelin and synthetic GHSs transiently stimulate \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) indicating the involvement of adenylyl cyclase-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and phospholipase C inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate pathways [163,193,194]. To determine the stimulatory effect of ghrelin on \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) in cultured porcine somatotrophs, the GH-immunoreactive cells comprised 40% of the total pituitary cells in culture [194]. An increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) above baseline following hGHRH treatment functionally identified GH cells. Of the cells that responded to hGHRH, 98% also responded to 1 μM ghrelin applied 10 min after the application of hGHRH (Fig. 7).

A similar calcium response was observed after treatment of isolated porcine somatotrophs with nonpeptidyl GHS, L-692,585 [193]. Experiments where reverse hemolytic plaque assay and \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) measurements were done concurrently and demonstrated that the calcium transient in cultured pituitary cells after application of L-692,585 or ghrelin coincided with GH secretion, implying that calcium transient evoked by L-692,585 or ghrelin is also followed by GH release [193,194]. The effect of ghrelin on \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) in cultured porcine somatotrophs was dose-dependent (Fig. 7). To determine whether the effect of ghrelin was receptor mediated, experiments were performed with (D-Lys³)-GHRP-6, a specific antagonist of GHS-R [198]. Perfusion of cultures with 100 μM (D-Lys³)-GHRP-6 for 10 min before ghrelin markedly decreased \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) (\(P < 0.01\)) (Fig. 8B) [194]. In the presence of the receptor antagonist, the increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) evoked by ghrelin (1 μM) was delayed about 100 s and decreased compared with controls (Fig. 8A). SRIF decreased and delayed the \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) transient response evoked by ghrelin compared with control (Fig. 8C). Likewise, in the presence of application for 10 min, the increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) evoked by ghrelin was decreased compared with controls (Fig. 8D).

Application of L-692,585 after ghrelin did not have additive effects on \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\), whereas preapplication of L-692,585 blocked the stimulatory effect of ghrelin on porcine somatotrophs [194]. Combined treatment with ghrelin and GHRH or L-163,255 did not cause a further increase in GH release from porcine somatotrophs, whereas SRIF abolished the effect of ghrelin [196]. Ghrelin stimulated cAMP production and also had an additive effect with GHRH on cAMP accumulation as well as increase free \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) levels in the porcine somatotrophs. The ghrelin-induced porcine GH release was entirely dependent on extracellular \(Ca^{2+}\) influx through L-type voltage-sensitive channels [193,194,196]. Exposure of porcine pituitary cell cultures to 4 h treatment with GHRH decreased GHRH-R mRNA and also diminished GHS-R transcripts levels [197]. Likewise, ghrelin down-regulated both GHS-R and GHRH-R expression, but dexamethasone treatment did not modify GHRH-R or GHS-R expression. Forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, decreased GHRH-R mRNA levels but had no effect on GHS-R. Thus, ghrelin, as well as GHRH, mediates homologous and heterologous downregulation of their own receptor synthesis. The results also indicated that expression of porcine GHRH-R and GHS-R is regulated by distinct signals which may differ from those reported in other mammalian species [197].

SRIF inhibits GH release from rat somatotrophs by reducing adenylyl cyclase activity and the free cytosolic \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\); however, SRIF may act not only as an inhibitor but also

(A) Somatotrophs were functionally identified by a 2-min application of \(10 \mu \mathrm{M}\) hGHRH. Subsequent administration of \(1 \mu \mathrm{M}\) ghrelin evoked an increase in \(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}\) in \(98 \%\) of the somatotrophs. The repeated administration of ghrelin after \(30 \mathrm{~min}\) did not have an additive effect on the \(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}\) increase, suggesting the existence of homologous desensitization of GHS-R. Application of \(50 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{K}^{+}\)increased the \(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}\) in all cells that responded to hGHRH and ghrelin. Panels of images of calcium transient were taken at the time indicated on the time course histogram.

a stimulator of GH release in the pig [199]. SRIF administration did not decrease basal GH in vivo in fetal [200] or prepubertal [53] gilts; continuous SRIF infusion enhanced the stimulatory effect of GHRH in this latter model [53]. SRIF at \(10^{-7}\) and \(10^{-5} \mathrm{M}\) concentration stimulate GH release from a subpopulation of high-density porcine somatotrophs [199]. The SRIF-induced GH release was not reduced by blockade of extracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx through voltage-sensitive channels as by depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) stores [199]. Thus, SRIF stimulates GH secretion from cultured porcine somatotrophs through an

adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway-dependent mechanism that is seemingly independent of net increase inositol phosphate turnover as \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) [199].

### 4.6. Ghrelin stimulation of GH secretion

hghrelin and rghrelin stimulated GH release from dispersed porcine pituitary cells during 2 h incubation at doses of \(10^{-8}\) and \(10^{-7} \mathrm{M}(P<0.05)\) [201]. GHRH-stimulated GH release from the cells at a dose as low as \(10^{-11} \mathrm{M}(P<0.05)\), and the response to GHRH was greater than that induced by h- or rghrelin. SRIF at \(10^{-7} \mathrm{M}\) blunted GH release induced by hghrelin and GHRH \((P<0.05)\). In synthetic GHSs, an additive or synergistic effect on GH secretion from pituitary cells was also observed in sheep [202] and cattle [66]. Ghrelin-immunoreactive cells were abundant in the cardiac region and pyloric region of pig stomach, and abundant from the neck to the base of the oxyntic glands of cow, sheep, pig and horse stomachs [203]. Circulating plasma ghrelin concentration was decreased 1 h after feeding

cows and then recovered to pre-feeding levels [203]. The i.c.v. administration of ghrelin in Shila goats markedly increased peak plasma GH concentration in a dose-dependent manner [203]. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the 1–28 or the 1–18 amino acid sequence of rodent and human ghrelin motilin-related peptide [MTLRP] were tested in vitro on GH release by rat pituitary cells and in vivo on freely moving rats [204]. The *n*-octanoylation of ghrelin28 or hghrelin18 was essential for direct pituitary GH release, whereas in vivo only ghrelin28 was active. Only the longer forms are active in vivo and inhibition of SRIF release appears to be involved in the mechanism of ghrelin action.

### 4.7. Peripheral signals in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis

There are numerous peripheral signals that contribute to the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis (i.e., mechano- and chemo-receptors, density of food, satiety in the immediate postprandial period, hormonal signals [205]). Hypothalamic neurons respond to changes in circulating glucose concentrations to elicit meal initiation and termination. These signals interact with long-term hormonal regulators (i.e., insulin, leptin, motilin, CCK, ghrelin) to maintain energy homeostasis. For example, upregulation of ghrelin expression occurs in the stomach upon fasting, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and leptin administration [206]. Pathways by which gastric ghrelin released into the circulating blood signals the hypothalamus are not clear, but ghrelin does cross the blood–brain barrier as an intact molecule [207]. The extent and direction in which ghrelin can cross the blood–brain barrier is influenced by its post-translationally added fatty acid side chain and its amino acid sequence. For example, des-octanoyl mouse ghrelin passes in the blood-to-brain direction, and the octanoylated (bioactive) mouse ghrelin crosses primarily in the brain-to-blood direction [207]. Ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone, is an important variable in feeding behavior in rats [208] and humans [171]. Studies on the effects of ghrelin on food intake, muscle accretion and neuroendocrine function are limited in livestock species. In mono-gastric weaning pigs, intravenous infusion of ghrelin 3× daily for 5 days increased weight gain (*P* < 0.04) and more frequent eating (*P* < 0.05) compared with saline-infused controls [209]. The initial intravenous infusion of ghrelin increased serum ghrelin, GH, insulin and cortisol concentrations, whereas serum IGF-1 decreased in these weaning pigs.

### 4.8. Endogenous ghrelin secretion as related to food intake

The digestive organs of ruminant and monogastric species are different. In sheep, a prefeeding surge in ghrelin circulating concentrations was followed by a decrease in ghrelin concentration soon after feeding, suggesting stimulates GH secretion [210,211]. There is a diurnal rhythm of plasma ghrelin and GH concentrations in sheep fed once daily at 0900 h [210–212]. When the sheep were fed 4× daily (09:00, 12:00, 15:00 and 18:00 h), plasma ghrelin concentrations peaked within 1 h prefeeding (*P* < 0.01 at 09:00 and 12:00 h, *P* < 0.05 at 16:00 h), followed by a rapid decrease to basal concentrations; however, this does not occur when animals have constant access to food [211,212]. The autonomic nervous system, particularly cholinergic neurons to the stomach in regulating ghrelin secretion in sheep was tested by administering cholinergic blockers (atropine and hexamethonium) and a cholinergic accelerator (metoclopramide) [213]. Atropine binds to muscarinic receptors in

the GI tract and hexamethonium binds to nicotinic receptors in cholinergic ganglia [212]. Metoclopramide accelerates cholinergic activity of the vagus nerve through inhibition of acetylcholine esterase. Plasma ghrelin concentrations in sheep infused with hexamethonium were greater ($P < 0.05$) than those infused with atropine which remained unchanged during a 3-h period. Ghrelin levels were lowest in metoclopramide-infused animals. These results suggest vagal involvement by activation of the cholinergic system to the ghrelin-producing cells of the stomach. In mature Holstein dairy cows and 3-month-old calves, changes in plasma ghrelin and GH concentrations were determined in relation to feeding at scheduled times [214]. The cows were fed at 08:00 and 16:00 h for 2 weeks before and during blood sampling. Plasma ghrelin concentrations decreased ($P < 0.01$) just after 08:00 but not at the 16:00 h feeding. Ghrelin concentrations were lower ($P < 0.01$) in calves than in cows and were unaffected by feeding. The lack of change in ghrelin circulating concentrations in calves may be related to rumen development. In domestic fowl (*Gallus domesticus*) the non-peptidyl GHSs, L-692,429 and L-163,225, abruptly increased GH secretion in vivo, and GH release from perfused chicken pituitary glands [215, 216]. The GHS-R has been cloned in chicken [217, 218]. Immunoreactive ghrelin was present in chicken hypothalamus, particularly in discrete parvocellular cells and neuronal fibers in the anterior medial hypothalamus, as well as in clusters of large ovoid magnocellular cells in the nucleus magnocellularis preopticus pars medialis and preopticus supraopticus, and in the chiasmaoptic [219]. Ghrelin immunoreactivity was not detected in the chicken proventriculus, stomach, ileum or colon, whereas SRIF immunoreactivity was readily detectable in the GI tract [219]. Intravenous administration of human ghrelin to immature chickens promptly increased plasma GH concentrations in a dose-dependent manner [220]. Additionally, ghrelin-induced dose-dependent GH release ($10^{-6}$ to $10^{-9}$ M) from dispersed chicken pituitary cells [220].

### 4.9. Effect of ghrelin on muscle accretion

Few studies are available on ghrelin affecting muscle accretion and long-term growth. Myogenic expression vectors containing the full length cDNA of swine ghrelin28 (pGEM-wt-sGhln) and truncated variant (pGEM-tmt-sGhln) consisting of the first seven residues of ghrelin (including Ser³ substituted with Trp³) with addition of a basic amino acid Lys (K) at the C-terminus [221]. Ectopic expressions of ghrelin and its variant were observed 30 days after intramuscular injection, and GH serum concentrations were greater ($P < 0.05$) in the pGEM-tmt-sGhln injected rats compared with controls. Body weight gains averaged 15% ($P < 0.05$) and 21% ($P < 0.03$) heavier than the controls. Skeletal muscle may have the potential to perform post-translational acylation for ghrelin, and a short ghrelin variant, as described here, may have biological effects similar to wild-type ghrelin.

### 5.1. Multiple factors affecting GH secretion

The discovery of potent synthetic peptidyl and non-peptidyl GH-secretagogues and the natural ligand, ghrelin, and its receptor has opened a new understanding of the regulation

of GH secretion. There is an array of other factors playing a role in the modulation of GH secretion, appetite, satiety, homeostasis, and muscle accretion, some of which are summarized in Fig. 9 and Table 2. There is yet much to be learned concerning the complexity of subtle inputs that regulate GH secretion in health and disease.

## 5.2. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of GH secretion

The molecular and cellular mechanisms of GH secretion have been examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) immunohistochemistry, immunogold labeling, biochemical analyses [222–225]. For the first time, the molecular composition and architecture of exocytic machinery at the cell plasma membrane has been revealed at nanometer resolution and its dynamics shown in real time, providing a new understanding of cellular secretion. The existence of the fusion pore (porosome), suggested a number of years ago from electrophysiological measurements, is now finally confirmed [226]. The discovery of the porosome and elucidation of its composition, revealed where membrane-bound secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release their contents [227]. AFM was used to reveal pits containing 100–200 nm in diameter depressions or fusion pores were identified in resting porcine GH-secreting cells [225]. Following stimulation of secretion, the size of the depression (fusion pore) enlarged and gold-tagged GH antibody were formed to bind to the pit structures in stimulated porcine GH cells. TEM was used to reveal that the number of secretory vesicles in porcine GH cells of the pituitary remains unchanged after secretion [223]. These results are consistent with a mechanism that, after simulation of secretion, vesicles transiently dock and fuse at the fusion pore to release vesicular contents. Immunocytochemical techniques were used to determine the distribution of somatotrophs in porcine anterior pituitary [224]. A distinctive pattern was found in somatotroph distribution throughout the gland in the age groups (1, 42, and 100 days old pigs). From these results, we suggest that there may be regional specificity of cellular differentiation and transformation to facilitate GH secretion to meet the need for endocrine regulation as the animal ages.
