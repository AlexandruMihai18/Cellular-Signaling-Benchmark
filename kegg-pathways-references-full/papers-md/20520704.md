CANCER

Clues from cell metabolism

William G. Kaelin Jr and Craig B. Thompson

Interest in the abnormal metabolism exhibited by cancer cells has been reawakened by the discovery of oncogenic mutations in metabolic enzymes, and by tools that monitor metabolism in living cells. Existing and emerging therapies aim to target this abnormal metabolism in various ways.

What is cell metabolism?

Cell metabolism describes the intracellular chemical reactions that convert nutrients and endogenous molecules into the energy and matter (proteins, nucleic acids and lipids) that sustain life. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the principal molecule that drives all energy-dependent cellular processes, is mainly generated by two metabolic pathways: glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 1). In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate, generating two net ATP molecules. When oxygen levels are low, anaerobic glycolysis continues, turning pyruvate into lactate. If oxygen is plentiful, however, the much more efficient process of oxidative phosphorylation occurs, in which pyruvate is routed to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA), or Krebs, cycle in the mitochondria, generating more than 30 net ATP molecules per molecule of glucose.

How do these abnormalities occur?

The ability to adapt to a dwindling nutrient supply depends on the integrity of a number of tumour suppressors, including the p53 and LKB1 proteins. Cancer cells, which often lack these tumour-suppressor proteins, exhibit 'addiction' to glucose and/or glutamine consumption.

Increased activity of the PI3K–AKT signalling pathway — due, for example, to activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases — mediates excessive nutrient uptake. AKT activates the HIF and MYC transcription factors, which enhance the expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) and glycolytic enzymes (Fig. 1). Moreover, HIF diverts pyruvate from the TCA cycle. Some of these actions can be reinforced by the loss of p53. Oncogenic MYC can also directly induce glutamine uptake in excess of nitrogen or carbon demand. Cells must eliminate the breakdown products of this metabolism by secreting the excess carbon and/or nitrogen as lactate, alanine and ammonia.

flux of metabolites to generate supplies of the macromolecular precursors NADPH, acetyl-CoA, ribose and glucose-derived non-essential amino acids. To maintain this high rate of glycolysis, a ready supply of the phosphate acceptor ADP is needed. If cellular metabolism is too efficient, all the ADP will be phosphorylated to ATP, and further glucose metabolism will be inhibited. Cancer cells therefore divert glucose-derived carbon into aerobic glycolysis and uncouple ATP production from mitochondrial electron transport. This means that they can consume the metabolic cofactor NADH without producing ATP, and promote the diversion of glycolytic intermediates into non-ATP-generating bypass pathways.

Can cancer cells use fat as a fuel?

Yes. Cancer cells, however, engage extensively in net lipid synthesis — another feature of cancer metabolism — to generate phospholipids for membrane production and lipid-derived signalling intermediates such as prostaglandins. It would be inefficient to simultaneously break down their newly synthesized fatty acids to generate energy.

How do cancer cells benefit from their abnormal metabolism?

In several ways. First, such metabolism ensures that cancer cells have a ready supply of the building blocks needed for macromolecule synthesis, such as NADPH and acetyl-CoA, in addition to ATP. Second, by claiming more than their fair share of nutrients, cancer cells starve their neighbours and gain space for growth. Third, excessive nutrient uptake can increase the generation of reactive oxygen species, which can promote cancer-cell proliferation by inactivating growth-inhibitory phosphatase enzymes, and enhance the mutation rate by inducing DNA damage.

What is the effect of changing oxygen levels?

A fundamental problem for solid tumours is that they often outgrow their blood supplies, and face low oxygen levels (hypoxia). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF accumulates and triggers the transcription of about 200 genes, many of which support cell survival. These include genes that promote glycolysis and suppress oxidative phosphorylation. HIF accumulation is suppressed by the activity of oxygen-dependent PHD (prolyl hydroxylase domain) enzymes (Fig. 2). The HIF response can be further magnified by mutations that promote HIF translation, such as those leading to AKT activation, or by mutations that compromise HIF degradation, such as those leading to loss of the tumour-suppressor protein pVHL. Furthermore, changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species or TCA-cycle metabolites

As aerobic glycolysis is inefficient, how do cancer cells maintain ATP levels?

By simply burning more glucose. Besides, too high a yield of ATP is probably not a good thing for a cancer cell. Cell growth depends on a continuous glycolytic and mitochondrial

Do any normal cells share these properties?

Normal cells can carry out aerobic glycolysis and inefficient glutamine breakdown when they are induced to proliferate. But if their supply of intracellular nutrients becomes depleted, the cells adapt by reactivating oxidative phosphorylation and ceasing proliferation.

such as succinate and fumarate can promote HIF accumulation.

### How about changes in nutrient availability?

Mammalian cells rely on intracellular mechanisms to gauge their nutrient supplies. For example, they sense low ATP levels through a rise in one of its hydrolysis products, AMP, which then activates the kinase AMPK and the LKB1 tumour-suppressor protein. Furthermore, intracellular levels of glutamine and other essential amino acids can affect the activity of mTOR kinase. Their actions regulate the ability of mTOR to stimulate protein synthesis and suppress autophagic cell death, in which the cell digests itself. Recent work has shown that, in the presence of essential amino acids, the Rag GTPase enzymes promote relocalization of mTOR to vesicles thought to contain its activator, Rheb. The deregulation of mTOR has been implicated in cancer. Furthermore, cells sense non-essential amino acids through the levels of their corresponding charged versus non-charged transfer RNA using an intracellular pathway involving the metabolic sensor GCN2. Inhibition of GCN2 can severely impair tumour growth. Nutrients can also affect gene expression. For example, nuclear and cytosolic levels of the metabolic cofactors acetyl-CoA and NAD⁺ partially control DNA accessibility and gene transcription, coupling them to the cell's energy status. These metabolic cofactors may alter epigenetic marks on the genome of cancer cells.

### Why is glutamine crucial for cancer cells?

Glutamine is essential for cell growth — abnormal increase in biomass is a hallmark of cancer. It is the metabolite that acts as an intermediate in the transport of reduced nitrogen through the bloodstream. To produce nucleotides and non-essential amino acids, cancer cells need a robust supply of reduced nitrogen. Furthermore, glutamine plays a crucial part in the uptake of essential amino acids, can maintain the TCA cycle when glucose levels are limiting (Fig. 1), and can support NADPH production, which is necessary for lipid and nucleotide biosynthesis. Oncogenic activation of MYC promotes glutamine use but at the expense of glutamine addiction.

### How does the Warburg effect come in?

Otto Warburg and colleagues were the first to report that cancer cells continue to engage in glycolysis and lactate production even when oxygen levels are abundant. This is known as the Warburg effect. Despite extensive efforts, however, Warburg and others could not find mutations that impaired oxidative metabolism in cancer cells. Consequently, many biologists questioned whether Warburg’s observations truly reflected tumour metabolism or were instead an artefact of inadvertent hypoxia

**Figure 1 | Biochemistry of cancer-cell metabolism.** On entering the cell, glucose is converted to pyruvate by glycolysis. In normal cells, if oxygen is available, pyruvate undergoes oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, through the TCA cycle. If oxygen levels are low, however, pyruvate is converted to lactate in the cytoplasm. Cancer cells drive pyruvate conversion to lactate even in the presence of oxygen. Metabolism of the nutrient glutamine is also modified in cancer. The transcription factors HIF (yellow) and MYC (green) seem to affect these metabolic pathways at various steps. For simplicity, only some chemical reactions and enzymes (purple) are shown. GLUT, glucose transporter; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter.

arising during his *in vitro* experiments. Imaging studies described below support the *in vivo* relevance of the Warburg effect.

### And how does it relate to the Pasteur effect?

The Pasteur effect describes the reciprocal relationship between anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation: when oxygen is present, glucose consumption to produce lactate should be suppressed in favour of oxidative phosphorylation. The Warburg effect is a loss of the Pasteur effect. It is clear that HIF is essential for both the Pasteur and the Warburg effects. In normal cells, oxygen suppresses HIF activity, leading to diminished glycolysis and increased entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. In cancer cells, oxygen can no longer effectively decrease HIF activity. Moreover, mutations affecting crucial cancer targets such as MYC and p53 can conspire with HIF activation to maintain a highly glycolytic state.

### Are metabolic enzymes frequently mutated in cancer?

Probably not. Metabolic pathways are independently regulated at various steps, and mutations in a single enzyme are usually insufficient to affect a nutrient’s uptake or metabolism. Rather, it seems that tumours seize control of their own metabolism by selecting for mutations that affect metabolic pathways rather than individual pathway components.

### How are cancer-associated metabolic changes detected?

Mass spectrometry can identify and quantify a diverse range of small organic metabolites in complex mixtures such as cell extracts. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also be used to monitor certain highly abundant metabolites and metabolic fluxes in intact cells. Several imaging techniques — including magnetic resonance imaging — are used to detect altered cancer-cell metabolism

in living organisms. The most widely used procedure is positron emission tomography (PET) after intravenous injection of the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). Strong 18FDG-PET signals in non-hypoxic tumours in vivo firmly support the Warburg effect.

### Could targeting cancer-associated glycolysis be used therapeutically?

In vitro, many cancer cells die in response to glucose withdrawal. But blocking glycolysis has not been useful in the clinic. For instance, the hexokinase enzyme mediates the first step of glycolysis (Fig. 1), but clinical trials with the hexokinase inhibitors 2-deoxyglucose and lonidamine were terminated, presumably owing to their untoward toxicity or inefficacy. The specificity of other hexokinase inhibitors under investigation, such as 3-bromopyruvate, has also been questioned. Clinical trials on TLN-232 (or CAP-232), an inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase, are continuing. A theoretical concern with glycolysis inhibitors is that glucose is an essential fuel source for red blood cells and, under non-starvation conditions, for the brain. Drugs that indirectly target glycolysis are also being pursued. mTOR inhibitors, for example, indirectly reduce glycolysis by decreasing levels of the HIF-1α subunit and perhaps other HIF-α family members. Several agents that block mTOR or receptor-tyrosine kinase signalling upstream of mTOR have been approved for cancer treatment. The efficacy of these drugs can be rapidly assessed by their ability to reverse tumour-associated 18FDG uptake. Whether their antiproliferative and pro-cell-death effects are also due to changes in metabolism is unclear, however.

### Do any anticancer agents exploit the metabolic addictions of cancer cells?

Yes. One of the first anticancer agents — and the first to induce remissions in leukaemia — was aminopterin, which blocks the activity of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This NADPH-dependent enzyme has a central role in nucleic-acid synthesis, and is activated by the high redox state induced by aerobic glycolysis and/or glutamine breakdown. Methotrexate, a related aminopterin compound, remains an important anticancer drug. Other ‘antimetabolites’ that interfere with nucleotide biosynthesis — including fluorouracil, cytarabine, gemcitabine and thioguanine — are also used to treat various cancers. Furthermore, L-asparagine is an essential amino acid for cells of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and the enzyme L-asparaginase, which breaks it down, is used to treat this cancer. L-Asparaginase also functions as a glutaminase — converting glutamine into glutamate (Fig. 1).

### What about other potential therapies?

Preclinical studies hint at several promising targets. For example, inhibition of the LDH-A enzyme or monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which respectively mediate

![Figure 2 | Regulation of HIF function.](attachment:Figure_2.png)

**Figure 2 | Regulation of HIF function.** HIF is a heterodimer consisting of an unstable α-subunit and a β-subunit. In the presence of oxygen, HIF-α is hydroxylated on one (or both) of two prolyl residues by members of the PHD enzyme family. In addition to oxygen, these enzymes require the TCA-cycle intermediate 2-oxoglutarate and reduced iron (Fe²⁺), and are inhibited by high concentrations of some other TCA-cycle metabolites such as fumarate, succinate and perhaps reactive oxygen species (ROS). A ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex containing the tumour-suppressor protein pVHL recognizes prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-α and earmarks it for degradation by proteasomes by adding a chain of ubiquitin (Ub) proteins. Dashed lines depict components that regulate PHD enzymes.

lactate production and secretion as part of aerobic glycolysis, seems to have anti-tumour effects (Fig. 1). The enzyme PDK, which is partly involved in diverting pyruvate to lactate production, is another potential cancer-drug target, and the PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate is being tested in patients with cancer. Glutamine must be converted to glutamate by glutaminase before entering the TCA cycle: cancer cells that express the MYC oncogene overexpress glutaminase and are killed by glutamine withdrawal. Although first-generation glutamine antagonists such as 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and acivicin are neurotoxic, safe glutaminase inhibitors are under development. Another possible target is the enzyme fatty-acid synthase, which is overexpressed in many cancers. Furthermore, inhibition of the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase, which is overexpressed in aggressive cancers, can suppress tumour growth.

### What are the latest advances?

An exciting finding is that germline mutations that affect the TCA-cycle enzymes fumarate hydratase and succinate dehydrogenase can produce cancer, by causing HIF stabilization and a state of pseudo-hypoxia (Figs 1, 2). Defective succinate dehydrogenase can also mediate the development of neural-crest tumours independently of HIF. Similarly, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) have been reported in brain tumours and acute leukaemia. Instead of their normal product (the TCA-cycle intermediate 2-oxoglutarate), these mutant enzymes produce 2-hydroxyglutarate, which might alter the activity of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes such as those that modify HIF levels. Several histone demethylase enzymes also seem to work as 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, raising the intriguing possibility that oxygen, reactive oxygen species, and metabolites such as 2-oxoglutarate may have relatively direct roles in influencing DNA-dependent processes including transcription and cell behaviour. Clearly, metabolic pathways are highly interconnected with pathways that govern the hallmarks of cancer, such as unrestrained proliferation and resistance to cell death. The many metabolic enzymes, intermediates and products involved could be fertile ground for improving cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.
