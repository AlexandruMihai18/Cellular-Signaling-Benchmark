### Abstract
The synthesis of lipids in response to food intake represents a key advantage that allows organisms to survive when energy availability is limited. In mammals, circulating levels of insulin and nutrients, which fluctuate between fasting and feeding, dictate whether lipids are synthesized or catabolized by tissues. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that is activated by anabolic signals, plays fundamental roles in regulating lipid biosynthesis and metabolism in response to nutrition. The mTOR kinase nucleates two large protein complexes named mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Following their activation, these complexes facilitate the accumulation of triglycerides by promoting adipogenesis and lipogenesis and by shutting down catabolic processes such as lipolysis and β-oxidation. Here, we review and discuss the roles of mTOR complexes in various aspects of lipid metabolism in mammals. We also use this opportunity to discuss the implication of these relations to the maintenance of systemic lipid homeostasis.

The protein composition and key features of mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTOR kinase is at the center of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Although mTORC1 and mTORC2 share the same catalytic subunit, these complexes show very unique features (see text for details). Abbreviations: 4E-BP1/2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 and 2; Akt, protein kinase B; DEPTOR, Dishevelled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; mLST8, mammalian lethal with Sec13 protein 8; mSIN1, mammalian stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein; mTORC1/2, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1/2; PKCa, protein kinase C-α; PRAS40, proline-rich Akt substrate 40kDa; PROTOR1/2, protein observed with Rictor-1 and -2; RAPTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR; RICTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR; S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1; SGK1, serum-and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1; Tel2, telomere length regulation protein TEL2 homolog; Tti1, TELO2-interacting protein 1 homolog.

(b) Dishevelled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (Deptor) (100); (c) mammalian lethal with Sec13 protein 8 (mLST8, also known as GβL) (47, 53); and (d) the Tti1/Tel2 complex (48). The proteins specifically associated with mTORC1 are regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) (35, 52) and proline-rich Akt substrate 40kDa (PRAS40) (112, 125, 129, 132). On the other hand, the partners associated only with mTORC2 are rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor) (47, 113), protein observed with Rictor-1 and -2 (Protor-1/2) (95, 96, 125), and mammalian stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein (mSin1) (29, 46). The structure, the interaction map, and the function of the mTOR-interacting proteins have been extensively reviewed previously (65, 66, 152).

As its name implies, mTOR was identified as a target of rapamycin, which is an antifungal produced by the bacterium *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*. Rapamycin binds to FK506-binding protein of 12kDa (FKBP12) and inhibits the kinase activity of mTORC1 by interfering with the FKBP12-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of mTOR (10, 109). Although some functions of mTORC1 are insensitive to inhibition by rapamycin, the activity of mTORC1 toward many of its substrates is severely impaired by this compound. The activation state of mTORC1 is intimately linked
to the cellular environment. mTORC1 senses growth factors, amino acids, energy status, stress, and oxygen levels to regulate many biological processes required for cell growth and proliferation. When active, mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis, mainly through the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins 1 and 2 (4E-BP1/2). Beyond its impact on protein synthesis, mTORC1 also promotes lysosome and mitochondrial biogenesis and, as reviewed here, several aspects of lipid metabolism. Importantly, mTORC1 also inhibits catabolism by blocking autophagy, the central degradative process in cells. We refer readers to other reviews for a complete description of the mechanisms by which mTORC1 regulates these other cellular processes (66, 152).

Growth factors such as insulin and insulin growth factor 1 are key regulators of mTORC1 (Figure 2). When bound to their specific receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), these growth factors activate PI3K and Ras, and this activation promotes the activity of several downstream kinases including protein kinase B/Akt (Akt), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (Figure 2a). These kinases directly phosphorylate tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), an event that leads to the dissociation of TSC2 from its partners TSC1 and TBC1 domain family member 7 and impairs the activity of the TSC complex (22, 44, 78, 80, 103, 108). TSC functions as a GTPase-activating protein for the Ras-homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) GTPase. The active form of Rheb is bound with a GTP and strongly enhances mTOR activity (76). When active, the TSC complex inhibits mTORC1 by converting Rheb into its inactive guanosine diphosphate-bound state (43, 124). By inhibiting TSC action, growth factor signaling promotes the action of Rheb and insures the optimal activation of mTORC1 (Figure 2a). Intracellular energy levels also regulate mTORC1 activity via the TSC axis. When cells are deprived of energy, the drop in ATP levels promotes AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) activity. AMPk directly phosphorylates TSC2, which enhances its GTPase-activating activity toward Rheb and blocks mTORC1 (45). The elevation in AMPk activity also impairs mTORC1 by directly phosphorylating the mTORC1 component Raptor (33).

As mentioned above, mTORC1 activity is highly sensitive to amino acids. The mechanism by which amino acids regulate mTORC1 activity has been the subject of intense investigation over the last ten years (4, 25). When cells are deprived of amino acids, mTORC1 activity is completely abolished, and the complex is diffused throughout the cytoplasm. The addition of amino acids to cells greatly promotes the activity of mTORC1, an effect that is associated with the

Overview of the mTOR signaling pathway. (a) mTORC1 is activated by the presence of growth factors and amino acids, and this complex regulates several biological processes, including lipid metabolism, autophagy, protein synthesis, lysosome biogenesis, and mitochondrial biogenesis. On the other hand, mTORC2 is activated by growth factors and regulates cytoskeletal organization, metabolism, and survival (see text for details). (b) The activation of mTORC1 triggers several negative feedback loops that inhibit growth factor signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (left panel).

recruitment of mTORC1 at the surface of the lysosomes (111). Amino acid–dependent activation of mTORC1 requires the Ras-related GTP-binding protein (Rag) family of small GTPases (54, 111). In mammals, there are four Rag proteins, RagA to RagD. These proteins form heterodimers consisting of RagA or RagB with RagC or RagD, which are physically attached to the lysosome through their interaction with a protein complex named Ragulator (110). The Rag GTPases have opposite nucleotide loading states, so that when RagA/B is bound to GTP, RagC/D is bound to guanosine diphosphate and vice versa. Upon amino acid stimulation, the guanine exchange factor activity of the Ragulator is induced through a mechanism that requires the activation of the lysosomal H⁺-adenosine triphosphate ATPase (5, 151). When active, the Ragulator promotes the GTP loading of RagA/B. In this state, RagA/B efficiently recruits mTORC1 on the lysosomes where the mTORC1 activator Rheb resides (Figure 2a). The interaction between mTORC1 and Rheb induces mTORC1 signaling by promoting its kinase activity. It is important to point out that amino acid–dependent recruitment of mTORC1 on lysosomes is a prerequisite for the activation of mTORC1 by other signals such as growth factors (89).

A key aspect related to mTORC1 is the ability of this complex to activate several negative feedback loops to inhibit growth factor signaling (Figure 2b). When activated, mTORC1 and S6K1 directly phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), which promotes IRS1 degradation and reduces the ability of growth factors to signal downstream of RTK (36, 128). mTORC1 also inhibits growth factor signaling by phosphorylating and stabilizing growth factor receptor-bound 10, an endogenous inhibitor of RTK (41, 146). The importance of the feedback loops regulated by mTORC1 can be observed in cells treated with rapamycin. In that case, the inhibition of mTORC1 relieves the feedback loops, which greatly enhances PI3K signaling (Figure 2b). The literature published over the past two decades clearly shows that the feedback loops are core components of the mTOR signaling pathway and that these elements are extremely significant from both physiological and clinical perspectives (66).

Compared to mTORC1, for which numerous inputs and downstream targets have been identified, less is known about mTORC2. mTORC2 was initially characterized as the rapamycin-insensitive mTOR complex (47, 113). Although mTORC2 activity is not impaired by acute rapamycin treatment, studies have shown that chronic treatment with the drug can inhibit its function in some cell types and tissues (63, 114). Unlike mTORC1, the activity of mTORC2 is not affected by amino acids. On the other hand, this complex is activated by growth factors downstream of PI3K, but the exact mechanism involved is still unclear. One potential mechanism involves a role for ribosomes, as ribosomes are needed for mTORC2 activation, and mTORC2 binds them in a PI3K-dependent fashion (150). mTORC2 controls several biological processes, including cell survival, metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization, by promoting the phosphorylation of several AGC kinases including serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1), protein kinase C-α, and Akt (66, 152) (Figure 2a).

**IMPACT OF mTOR SIGNALING ON LIPOGENESIS**

The transition between fasting and feeding is associated with profound changes in the circulating amounts of nutrients and growth factors, and these modulations dictate whether anabolic or catabolic processes are turned on in tissues. Postprandial metabolism is very dynamic and allows the organism to efficiently use the ingested nutrients to support anabolism. Cells require a substantial amount of lipids to support membrane biogenesis as well as energy metabolism. Lipogenesis is a cellular process by which acetyl-CoA is converted to fatty acids. This important anabolic process occurs in several tissues following carbohydrate-rich meals and is highly dependent on circulating insulin levels (51). Because the mTOR signaling pathway responds to nutrient and growth factor levels, its role in regulating lipogenesis has been of great interest over the past few years.
$\textbf{mTORC1}$

As illustrated in Figure $2a$, mTORC1 is activated under conditions of nutrient abundance in order to increase protein translation. It is now widely accepted that the anabolic function of mTORC1 goes far beyond its impact on protein synthesis. mTORC1 plays a central role in promoting lipid biogenesis by regulating the expression of many lipogenic genes (67). One important family of transcription factors that are involved in lipid synthesis is composed of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). SREBPs are basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors that regulate lipid homeostasis by controlling the expression of several lipogenic genes (39). Three isoforms have been described so far: SREBP1a and SREBP1c (hereafter referred to as SREBP1), which are encoded by the same gene ($SREBF1$) and differ in their first exon, and SREBP2. SREBP1 is a master transcription regulator of insulin-mediated fatty acid synthesis, a process known as de novo lipogenesis, whereas SREBP2 mainly controls sterol biosynthesis (39). SREBPs reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane as an inactive precursor in complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). SCAP forms a complex with insulin-induced gene (INSIG) proteins, which retains SREBPs in the ER. In response to insulin or low sterols, the SREBP-SCAP complex dissociates from INSIG and traffics to the Golgi, where SREBPs are proteolytically cleaved by site-1 protease (S1P) and S2P into their active mature forms (mSREBPs) (39). mSREBPs transit into the nuclei and activate the expression of several lipogenic genes. When activated, mSREBP1 can also induce its own expression in a feed-forward fashion (23). The importance of SREBPs in lipogenesis was highlighted by studies using mice with liver-specific deletion of $Scap$ (82) or $S1p$ (137), which exhibit reduction in processing SREBPs and cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in liver. Additionally, genetically obese $ob/ob$ mice lacking $Srebp1$ are protected from diet-induced hepatic steatosis (136).

mTORC1 positively regulates the activation of SREBPs at multiple levels, including processing, trafficking, and transcription (3) (Figure $3a$). In 2008, one group observed that rapamycin prevents the Akt-mediated nuclear accumulation of mSREBP1 and the induction of lipogenic genes in epithelial cells (102). These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that rapamycin reduces the expression of several lipogenic genes (83, 97). Interestingly, silencing of $Raptor$, but not $Rictor$, blunts the processing of SREBP1 and the expression of lipogenic genes, confirming that the regulation of SREBP1 action depends mainly on mTORC1 (102). Supporting the importance of mTORC1 for SREBP1 processing and activation, genetic disruption of the TSC complex in cancer cells in vitro induces mSREBP1 nuclear accumulation and promotes de novo lipogenesis in a rapamycin-sensitive fashion (24). The importance of mTORC1 in regulating SREBP1 processing was also observed in vivo. Mice treated with rapamycin show a reduction in hepatic SREBP1 processing, an effect associated with a significant decrease in the expression of lipogenic genes (140). Studies have revealed that the mTORC1 substrate S6K1 plays a crucial role in promoting the processing of SREBPs downstream of mTORC1, but the exact mechanism involved still remains to be determined (24, 72, 75, 93, 131). In addition to S6K1, it is possible that mTORC1 could also promote SREBP1 processing through the induction of ER stress. ER stress is induced when protein synthesis is high and when the amount of unfolded protein exceeds the folding capacity of the ER. Interestingly, ER stress promotes SREBP1 activation in mouse liver, and strategies aimed at reducing ER stress reduce SREPB1 processing and the expression of lipogenic genes (49, 134). The fact that sustained activation of mTORC1 induces ER stress (94) raises the possibility that mTORC1 could control SREBP1 processing via this route. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

The rise in insulin levels driven by food consumption has been identified as a very potent inducer of liver $Srebf1$ expression (28, 38, 118). A large body of evidence indicates that in addition to its role
in promoting the processing of SREBPs, mTORC1 also regulates *Srebf1* transcription (Figure 3a). Several research teams observed, in various experimental conditions, that insulin-mediated induction in *Srebf1* is significantly reduced by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mTORC1 (24, 72, 93, 102, 130, 140). The contribution of S6K1 to the effect of mTORC1 on *Srebf1* expression was investigated, but the conclusions are conflicting. Whereas one group showed that insulin-dependent *Srebf1* expression could not be blocked using a specific S6K inhibitor (72), another one reported that knocking down S6K1 is sufficient to reduce *Srebf1* expression (73). The use of different models and strategies to inhibit S6K1 activity may explain the discrepancies between these

studies. Lastly, it was recently proposed that mTORC1 could control *Srebf1* expression through the regulation of the nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor γ (90). Whether retinoid X receptor γ action is affected directly by mTORC1, S6K1, or other downstream effectors remains to be determined.

Another important mechanism by which mTORC1 regulates SREBPs is through lipin-1. Lipin-1 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase required for glycerolipid biosynthesis. This protein also serves as a transcriptional coactivator that regulates the expression of lipogenic genes (104). It was shown that mTORC1 promotes the activation of SREBPs by inducing their nuclear accumulation through a mechanism that requires lipin-1 (100a). When active, mTORC1 phosphorylates lipin-1, which results in its exclusion from the nucleus (Figure 3a). Upon mTORC1 inhibition, lipin-1 accumulates in the nucleus, which promotes the association of SREBPs to the nuclear matrix and impairs their ability to bind target genes (100a). This regulation has been proven to be critical for the development of hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia caused by a Western diet (100a).

As discussed above, the relation between mTORC1 and SREBPs is key for the activation of lipogenesis in response to food intake. Nonetheless, it is important to point out that the mTORC1-SREBPs axis also plays roles in other biological contexts including, but not restricted to, cancer development and nervous system function. The promotion of lipogenesis is a hallmark of proliferative cancer cells, the synthesis of lipids being essential to support membrane synthesis and proliferation (84). Many components of the PI3K signaling pathway, which is upstream of mTORC1, are mutated in cancers (66). Evidence also shows that activation of mTORC1 is required to relay oncogenic signals to SREBP1 activation (24, 102). The activation of SREBP1 by mTORC1 drives the expression of components of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, which controls the production of the reducing equivalents and ribose-5-phosphate needed for lipogenesis and nucleotide biosynthesis, respectively (24). The reduction in cell proliferation associated with depletion of SREBPs in cells with elevated PI3K-mTORC1 signaling indicates that cell proliferation induced by oncogenic PI3K signaling depends on the transcriptional program controlled by SREBPs (24, 102). From a completely different perspective, the mTORC1-SREBPs connection was recently shown to be important in maintaining nervous system homeostasis (88, 90, 91, 153). Myelin is an insulating sheath that forms around axons and nerves to increase the

**Figure 3**

Impact of mTOR signaling in lipogenesis. (*a*) When activated by insulin and amino acids, mTORC1 induces lipogenesis through its effect on SREBP. mTORC1 favors SREBP processing, an event required for the nuclear translocation and the activation of SREBP transcriptional activity. There is evidence that S6K1 mediates the effect of mTORC1 on SREBP processing. The induction of protein synthesis and ER stress associated with elevated mTORC1 activity may also facilitate SREBP processing and the formation of its mature and active form (mSREBP). In the nucleus, mSREBP activates the expression of lipogenic genes, including *Srebf1*, by a feed-forward loop amplifying SREBP activation. The activation of mTORC1 also promotes *Srebf1* expression through a mechanism that may depend on S6K1. The nuclear receptor RXRγ has been shown to contribute to the effect of mTORC1 on *Srebf1* expression. Lastly, mTORC1 promotes the transcriptional activity of mSREBP by phosphorylating Lipin1, which blocks its nuclear accumulation. In the cytoplasm, Lipin1 is no longer able to block the transcriptional activity of mSREBP. (*b*) mTORC2 activates SREBP through the activation of Akt. When activated, Akt phosphorylates and blocks GSK3-mediated degradation of mSREBP. It has also been proposed that mTORC2 could regulate SREBP activity through Akt-independent mechanisms. (*c*) Balancing the signal between mTORC1 and Akt is key for the optimal activation of lipogenesis. Akt activation by insulin reduces the expression of *Insig2a*, which promotes SREBP dissociation from the ER and facilitates its processing by mTORC1 (*left panel*). Overactivation of mTORC1 caused by the loss of *Tsc1* impairs SREBP and lipogenesis by inducing the feedback inhibition of Akt (*right panel*).

speed and efficiency at which electrical impulses propagate along axons and nerves. mTORC1 has emerged as one important player involved in myelination (91). Using transgenic mice that overexpress constitutively active Akt in oligodendrocytes, investigators demonstrated that Akt regulates myelination in a rapamycin-sensitive fashion (88). Consistently, neuronal-specific *Rheb1* knockout mice, which have impaired mTORC1 activity in neurons, exhibit a flagrant defect in myelination during development (153). Another group also revealed that loss of *Raptor*, but not *Rictor*, in myelin-producing Schwann cells leads to hypomyelination (90). This defect was reported to be the consequence of altered lipid composition due to defective SREBP signaling. These studies support the importance of the lipogenic functions of mTORC1 in both health and diseases.

## mTORC2

Although the control of lipogenesis was mainly studied in relation to mTORC1, recent studies indicate that mTORC2 also plays a critical role in modulating lipid synthesis. Two independent research groups recently reported that deletion of *Rictor* in the liver decreases SREBP activity, the expression of lipogenic genes, and lipid accumulation in the liver (34, 147). Another group also showed a defect in lipogenesis in mice devoid of *Rictor* in brown adipose tissue (42). Although these studies confirm the importance of mTORC2 for the promotion of lipogenesis, the mechanism of action proposed greatly differs. A first group observed that the lipogenic defects observed in liver-specific *Rictor* null mice are completely rescued by the overexpression of a constitutively activated Akt isoform (34). Relatively similar findings were reported by others, demonstrating the importance of Akt in the control of lipogenesis downstream of mTORC2 (42). Over the years, Akt was shown to control lipogenesis through its action on SREBP1. Akt reduces the expression of *Insig2a* (a liver-specific isoform of INSIG), which promotes SREBP1 dissociation from the ER and facilitates its processing (135, 140, 143). Akt also directly phosphorylates SREBP1, which promotes SREBP1 transport from the ER to the Golgi (142). Lastly, Akt blocks glycogen synthase kinase 3-mediated proteasomal degradation of mSREBP1 (7, 123). The results presented by this first group suggest that the loss of mTORC2-mediated Akt phosphorylation on Serine 473 (Ser473), which only partially reduces Akt function, impairs SREBP1 activation by enhancing its degradation via glycogen synthase kinase 3 (*Figure 3b*). On the other hand, another report showed that Akt overexpression is not sufficient to overcome the lipogenic defects observed in *Rictor* null mice, which suggests that mTORC2 affects SREBP1 activation and the lipogenic program independently of Akt (147). In this study, mTORC2 depletion was associated with a significant reduction in mTORC1 activity, an effect that may have contributed to reduce SREBP activation and lipogenesis. Such inhibition of mTORC1 signaling was absent in the first study discussed above (34) and in many previous reports in which mTORC2 was deleted (8, 31, 32, 61, 119). The reason for these differences is unknown but likely explains the discrepancy between the two studies.

## Balancing the Signals Is Key for the Optimal Activation of Lipogenesis

Although some questions remain to be answered relative to the mechanisms by which mTOR complexes promote lipogenesis, the studies described above clearly show that these complexes are playing a central role in this process. Interestingly, three reports published recently indicate that the relation between mTOR signaling and lipogenesis is not as straightforward as originally thought. By crossing *Tsc1* floxed mice with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the *Albumin* promoter, two independent groups have produced mice with constitutive hepatic mTORC1 activation (50, 140). Owing to the positive role of mTORC1 in mediating SREBP1 activation and lipogenesis, it was expected that liver-specific *Tsc1* null mice would develop severehepatosterosis. Surprisingly, these mice did not accumulate more lipids in their liver and were even protected against age- and diet-induced hepatosterosis. Despite constitutive mTORC1 signaling, SREBP1 expression and processing is lower in the liver of *Tsc1* null mice, which indicates that mTORC1 activation is not sufficient to induce hepatic SREBP1 activation and de novo lipogenesis. It was shown that the constitutive mTORC1 activation exacerbates the feedback inhibition of insulin signaling, which severely impairs Akt activity (140). Such reduction in Akt signaling was associated with a significant increase in the expression of the SREBP1 inhibitor *Insig2a* (140). These results indicate that Akt and mTORC1 control essential but distinct steps in SREBP1 activation and that these signals must be adequately balanced for the full activation of lipogenesis (Figure 3c). Interestingly, similar conclusions were drawn in mice lacking *Tsc1* in myelin-producing oligodendrocytes (70). In this study, the authors found that oligodendrocyte-specific overactivation of mTORC1 causes hypomyelination characterized by downregulation of Akt signaling and lipogenic pathways. These results further support the idea that a delicately balanced regulation of mTORC1 and Akt is needed for the optimal activation of lipogenesis.

**IMPLICATION OF mTOR SIGNALING IN WHITE ADIPOSE TISSUE FORMATION**

The accumulation of triglycerides in adipose tissue represents a key evolutionary process allowing organisms to survive periods of food deprivation. The adipocytes composing white adipose tissue store triglycerides and can rapidly mobilize these lipids to fulfill energy needs when access to food is limited. Considering that triglycerides yield twice as many calories per gram than do carbohydrates, and that white adipose tissue shows an outstanding capacity to store triglycerides, this tissue represents by far the most important energy reserve of the body. Owing to its role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in response to fasting, white adipose tissue is highly sensitive to the nutritional status. In response to insulin and nutrients, several processes including glucose uptake, lipoprotein hydrolysis, fatty acid uptake/esterification, and triglyceride synthesis are activated, insuring the storage of lipids when energy is available. In conditions of chronic overfeeding, the proliferation of fat cell progenitors and their differentiation into mature adipocytes is also induced (133). In contrast, most of these processes are repressed in response to fasting. As discussed above and illustrated in Figure 2a, the mTOR signaling pathway is highly sensitive to activation by insulin and nutrients. Reports indicate that this signaling node deeply affects adipose tissue development and maintenance.

Adipogenesis is a complex developmental process in which multipotent stem cells commit toward the adipose lineage and start accumulating lipids to form mature adipocytes (13). Although knowledge of the early steps required for the commitment of adipose precursors is still limited, the molecular events leading to their terminal differentiation into mature adipocytes are extremely well defined. The differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes is regulated by the action of several transcription factors, including the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). When preadipocytes are exposed to proadipogenic conditions, the expression of C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ is rapidly turned on, which induces C/EBPα and the expression of PPARγ, a nuclear receptor that is necessary and sufficient for the activation of the whole adipogenic program. PPARγ controls the adipogenic process by directly promoting the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in fatty acid binding, fatty acid esterification, triglyceride synthesis, and lipid storage. A complete overview of the adipogenic cascade can be found in numerous excellent reviews (106, 107, 127).$\textbf{mTORC1}$

Many observations support a role for mTORC1 in the regulation of adipogenesis. Using rapamycin, several research groups observed that the drug abrogates adipocyte differentiation in various cell lines in vitro (6, 18, 26, 30, 57, 101, 141, 145, 149). Because prolonged treatment with rapamycin can sometimes inhibit mTORC2 (63, 114), studies based on the chronic use of this drug cannot completely exclude a possible role for mTORC2 in the regulation of adipocyte formation. To determine the specific contribution of mTORC1 in adipogenesis, one group knocked down the essential mTORC1 component $Raptor$ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (101). Reduction in mTORC1 activity severely impaired adipogenesis in this model. A similar phenotype was observed when $Raptor$ null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were induced to differentiate in vitro (101). Conversely, the loss of $Tsc2$, which leads to the constitutive activation of mTORC1, increases the adipogenic potential of MEFs (149). Importantly, the positive role of mTORC1 on adipocyte formation and maintenance was also observed in animal models. It was shown several times that rodents treated with rapamycin accumulate less adipose tissue (16, 17, 40). The role of mTORC1 in regulating adipose tissue in vivo was also demonstrated using a Cre-Lox approach. By crossing $Raptor$ floxed mice with mice expressing the Cre-recombinase under the control of the $aP2$ promoter, a promoter highly active in adipocytes, one group deleted $Raptor$ in adipose tissue and showed that the loss of mTORC1 activity in this tissue impairs lipid accumulation and protects mice from diet-induced obesity (101). Although these results support the role of mTORC1 in regulating white adipose tissue maintenance, the conclusions drawn from this last study should be interpreted carefully because recent reports indicate that the $aP2$ promoter drives the expression of the Cre-recombinase not only in fat but also in other tissues, including the brain (71, 81). This raises the possibility that loss of mTORC1 activity in the brain could have also contributed to reduce adipose tissue accumulation by affecting, for example, the regulation of energy balance. More studies are needed to test this possibility.

From a mechanistic perspective, mTORC1 affects adipogenesis at different levels (Figure 4a). It was first reported that rapamycin impairs adipogenesis by blocking the mitotic clonal expansion of preadipocytes, an early proliferative step required for the conversion of several adipogenic cell lines in vitro (141). Other groups showed thereafter that addition of rapamycin following clonal expansion also impairs adipogenesis, thus indicating that mTORC1 controls the terminal differentiation of fat cells independently of its early effect on cell proliferation (6, 18, 30). In perfect agreement with these results, rapamycin was shown to inhibit the expression of C/EBPs and

Impact of mTOR signaling on adipogenesis. $(a)$ mTORC1 affects the adipogenic process at multiple steps. The phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BPs by mTORC1 promotes the commitment of mesenchymal stem cells toward the adipogenic lineage and the terminal differentiation of these cells. How S6K1 regulates the early steps of the adipogenic program is still unclear. On the other hand, mTORC1 is known to control the terminal differentiation of adipocytes by activating key adipogenic transcription factors including C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ downstream of 4E-BPs. $(b)$ mTORC2 affects early steps of adipogenesis by modulating the activity of the transcription factor FoxC2, downstream of Akt. $(c)$ Akt and mTORC1 regulate distinct steps for the optimal activation of the adipogenic process (left panel). The partial inhibition of mTORC1 mediated by Deptor expression or partial mTOR knockdown promotes adipogenesis by reducing the negative feedback loops from mTORC1 to IRS1 (right panel). The improvement in insulin signaling insures the optimal activation of Akt, which plays a key role in glucose uptake, lipid synthesis, and PPARγ activation.

PPARγ in vitro (57). Both S6K1 and 4E-BPs play roles in regulating fat cell formation downstream of mTORC1 (Figure 4a). It was reported that S6K1 is required for the commitment of embryonic stem cells to early adipocyte progenitors (12). S6k1 null mice are unable to efficiently increase adipocyte cell number in response to a high-fat diet, an effect associated with a marked reduction in the expression of early adipogenic transcription factors including C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ (12). Other evidence suggests that S6K1 also affects the terminal differentiation of preadipocytes. Knockdown of S6K1 or its pharmacological inhibition with PF4708671 completely blocks 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation (144). Taking all these observations into account, it is evident that S6K1 represents a key regulator of adipogenesis downstream of mTORC1. Nonetheless, overexpression of a constitutively active form of S6K1 is not sufficient to reverse the antiadipogenic effect of rapamycin (57). This observation clearly indicates that mTORC1 also regulates adipogenesis through S6K1-independent mechanisms. In addition to S6K1, mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BP1/2, which blocks the ability of these proteins to bind and inhibit the translational regulator eIF4E. Loss of 4E-BP1/2, which mimics a state of constitutive mTORC1 activation, increases the expression of C/EBPδ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ and the adipogenic conversion of MEFs in vitro (69). Consistently, 4e-bp1/2 null mice gain significantly more weight when exposed to a high-fat diet (69). Overall, all the studies described above confirm the importance of S6K1 and 4E-BPs in regulating adipocyte development and maintenance downstream of mTORC1. Despite the significant contribution of these two effectors, it is important to point out that mTORC1 may also affect adipogenesis through additional and complementary mechanisms. As discussed in the previous section, mTORC1 positively regulates SREBP1 activity. This transcription factor has been previously shown to affect PPARγ activation and the terminal differentiation of adipocytes (55, 56). Whether mTORC1 controls adipose tissue formation through SREBP1 remains to be determined.

## mTORC2

Adipogenesis is a cellular process that requires the activation of Akt (59, 79, 85, 87, 98). In response to insulin, Akt induces glucose uptake and metabolism and incorporation of glycolytic intermediates into lipids, and it promotes the activation of PPARγ through various mechanisms (106). Akt also induces mTORC1, another important regulator of fat cell development (Figure 4a). Owing to its role in promoting Akt, it was initially assumed that mTORC2 would play key roles in adipogenesis. Surprisingly, mice with adipose-specific deletion of Rictor, the essential component of mTORC2, do not show any defect in adipose tissue accumulation (21, 62). From these studies, it was concluded that mTORC2 is not essential for the terminal differentiation and the maintenance of adipocytes in vivo. These results raise one important question: How can mTORC2, which activates Akt, be dispensable for adipogenesis, considering the importance of Akt in this process? The full activation of Akt requires its phosphorylation on Ser473 and Thr308 by mTORC2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDPK1), respectively. It was observed several times that the loss of Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 brought by the depletion of mTORC2 only partially reduces the activity of Akt (21, 27, 32, 62). The maintenance of Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 is sufficient to maintain the action of Akt toward most of its substrates. This suggests that the residual activity of Akt present in mature fat cells is sufficient to maintain adipocyte formation and maintenance in the context of mTORC2 inhibition.

The strategy used to study mTORC2 in adipose tissue in vivo was designed using the Ap2-Cre mouse model. Because this Cre recombinase is expressed at a late stage of the adipogenic process, this model is not suitable to evaluate the role of mTORC2 in the early phases of adipogenesis. To test the role of mTORC2 in the initial phases of fat cell development, one group crossed Rictor floxed mice with mice expressing the myogenic factor 5 (Myf5)-Cre recombinase, which is expressed
in several cell types, including some white adipocyte progenitors (42). Using this approach, they showed that mice lacking mTORC2 in white adipocyte progenitors accumulate less adipose tissue, suggesting a role for mTORC2 in the early phases of adipose tissue development. Consistently, loss of *Rictor* in adipose precursors cells or MEFs impairs adipogenesis in vitro (42, 138). Mechanistically, it was proposed that mTORC2 affects early adipogenesis by blocking the activity of the transcription factor forkhead-box C2 (FoxC2), downstream of Akt (138) (Figure 4b). The combination of results from all these studies suggests that mTORC2 is required for early adipogenesis but likely dispensable for the terminal differentiation and the maintenance of mature adipocytes.

**Balancing the Signals Is Key for Adipocyte Differentiation**

From all the results discussed above, it is clear that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 play complementary roles in promoting adipogenesis, adipose tissue formation, and fat cell maintenance. Nonetheless, recent results indicate that the control of adipogenesis by the mTOR signaling pathway is much more complex than anticipated.

In 2009, the protein Deaptor was identified as a new partner of mTORC1 and mTORC2 (100). In this first report, investigators showed that Deaptor inhibits the activity of both complexes and promotes growth factor signaling by blocking the negative feedback loops from mTORC1 to PI3K (100). It was observed that the ability of Deaptor to relieve the feedback inhibition on RTK is exploited by some cancer cell lines to promote PI3K signaling and survival. At that time, the role of Deaptor in the regulation of physiological processes in vivo was unknown. Before the identification of Deaptor as an mTOR-interacting protein, a section on chromosome 15 that includes the *Deaptor* gene was identified as being part of the Fob3a quantitative trait locus that is linked to obesity/leanness in mice (122). It was reported that *Deaptor* expression is elevated in the adipose tissues of the mouse line genetically prone to obesity. The possibility that a negative regulator of mTOR signaling could favor adiposity was counterintuitive considering the well-established positive role of this signaling node in regulating adipogenesis and adipose cell maintenance. To test the physiological functions of Deaptor in vivo, investigators developed a doxycycline-inducible mouse model allowing the overexpression of Deaptor in peripheral tissues, including the adipose tissues (64). As suggested by the quantitative trait locus studies, overexpression of Deaptor was observed to induce obesity in mice. Consistent with a positive role of Deaptor in adipogenesis, it was shown that the expression of Deaptor is massively increased during the development of white adipose tissue in vivo and during adipogenesis in vitro. A positive relation between DEPTOR protein levels in adipose tissue and the severity of obesity in humans was also observed. In vitro, overexpression of Deaptor promotes the adipogenic conversion of MEFs, whereas *Deaptor* knockdown completely abrogates this process. A reduction in PPARγ activity and expression was observed in cells depleted from Deaptor. Mechanistically, Deaptor expression was shown to partially reduce mTORC1 activity, which relieves the negative feedback loop on IRS1 and increases the proadipogenic functions of Akt (Figure 4c). Deaptor insures the optimal balance between Akt and mTORC1 signaling, which are both essential for the activation of PPARγ and for the completion of the adipogenic program. It is important to note that Deaptor does not block mTORC1 to the same degree as rapamycin, which probably explains why this endogenous inhibitor has a different impact on adipogenesis. Interestingly, another group recently confirmed the importance of balancing mTORC1 and Akt signaling for the optimal activation of adipogenesis. It was reported that a partial depletion of mTOR in 3T3-L1 cells improves IRS1 stability, Akt phosphorylation, PPARγ expression, and adipogenesis (144). Together, these reports show that the balance between mTORC1 and Akt signaling is critical for the optimal development of adipocytes. Interestingly, this concept is very similar to the one described above regarding the relation between mTORC1, Akt, and SREBP

activation. All these reports highlight the importance of the negative feedback loops controlled by mTORC1 in the regulation of several anabolic processes.

# IMPLICATION OF mTOR SIGNALING IN LIPOLYSIS

In the previous sections, we have detailed how food intake activates mTOR complexes and how such activation affects the synthesis of lipids and the formation of adipose tissue, which are key processes required for the conservation of energy in higher organisms. In addition to promoting anabolism, mTOR activation also blocks several catabolic processes. The perfect example is the reduction in autophagy associated with mTORC1 activation (66). Reports published recently indicate that autophagy is not the only catabolic process blocked by mTOR signaling. The breakdown of intracellular triglycerides, a process defined as lipolysis (148), is also inhibited by the action of both mTOR complexes. We review these findings in the following sections.

## mTORC1

The link between mTORC1 and adipose tissue lipolysis was suggested by observations made in various experimental conditions. First, it was reported that humans and animal models treated with rapamycin show a significant elevation in circulating free fatty acids (2, 40, 86). Consistently, isolated adipocytes exposed to rapamycin exhibit higher basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis ex vivo (14, 77, 99). A similar effect was also observed in mature 3T3-L1 cells treated with rapamycin or depleted from Raptor (14, 121). On the other hand, activation of mTORC1 by the overexpression of Rheb inhibits lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells (14). Downstream of mTORC1, loss of S6K1 promotes lipolysis in isolated adipocytes, whereas loss of 4E-BP1/2 reduces this effect (69, 128). Altogether, these results suggest that mTORC1 negatively regulates triglyceride breakdown and fatty acid release from adipocytes. This conclusion makes much sense considering that mTORC1 is activated in response to food intake, a condition that severely inhibits lipolysis.

As observed in the case of lipogenesis and adipogenesis, mTORC1 appears to regulate lipolysis through several mechanisms (Figure 5). It was reported that mTORC1 affects the lipolytic process through its impact on the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the lipase that catalyzes the initial step of lipolysis, converting triglycerides to diacylglycerols (148). Hyperactive mTORC1 signaling was associated with a reduction in the expression of *Atgl* (14). Conversely, inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin was linked to a significant increase in *Atgl* expression in vitro and in vivo. A later report showed that the regulation of *Atgl* expression by mTORC1 involves the action of the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr1) (15). The activation of mTORC1 by insulin and growth factors increases the levels of Egr1 through an unknown mechanism, and Egr1 inhibits *Atgl* expression by directly binding to its promoter (Figure 5).

The inhibition of lipolysis following food intake is a rapid phenomenon. This is illustrated by the dramatic reduction in circulating free fatty acids observed within one hour following food intake (37, 68). In fact, the most important regulatory steps in triglyceride breakdown occur at the posttranslational level and are independent of changes in the expression of the lipases affecting triglyceride hydrolysis (148). Although the relation between mTORC1 and the expression of *Egr1* and *Atgl* probably plays a role in the long-term regulation of lipolysis, it is very unlikely that this transcriptional cascade could be involved in the rapid inhibition of lipolysis by food consumption. One study revealed that mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin promotes lipolysis, independently of changes in ATGL levels, by enhancing protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase on Ser 563 (121), a site that promotes the activity of this key lipase required for the complete breakdown of triglycerides (116). In this study, it was reported that

mTORC1 inhibition increases catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis independently of changes in intracellular cAMP levels and PKA phosphorylation. Exactly how mTORC1 inhibition synergizes with PKA to affect hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation remains to be determined.

## mTORC2

In addition to mTORC1, mTORC2 has also been identified as a negative regulator of adipose tissue lipolysis. Adipose-specific loss of *Rictor*, the essential component of mTORC2, severely reduces the ability of adipocytes to suppress lipolysis in response to insulin (62). Adipose-specific *Rictor* null mice show elevated circulating glycerol and free fatty acids, ectopic fat deposition, and insulin resistance. The higher lipolytic rate observed in *Rictor* null adipocytes was associated with reduced Akt phosphorylation, elevated PKA activity, and higher HSL phosphorylation on Ser563. As illustrated in Figure 5, Akt negatively regulates lipolysis by blocking cAMP-mediated activation of PKA and HSL. The results from investigators using adipose-specific *Rictor* null mice suggest that mTORC2 affects triglyceride breakdown in fat cells by promoting the antilipolytic functions of Akt. Surprisingly, not all the studies using adipose-specific *Rictor* null mice yielded similar conclusions. Using the same model, another group did not observe any effect of mTORC2 loss on circulating levels of free fatty acids, an indicator of lipolysis (21). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear but could be due to differences in experimental procedures.

## Lipolysis and mTOR Signaling: The Picture Is Still Not Perfectly Clear

As mentioned above, treatment of mice or adipose cells with rapamycin promotes triglyceride breakdown and the release of free fatty acids (2, 14, 40, 77, 86, 99, 121). Although there are indications that mTORC1 per se can affect lipolysis (14, 15), the possibility that rapamycin could indirectly affect this process by modulating mTORC2 function should not be ruled out. As discussed in the first section of this review, chronic treatment with rapamycin can inhibit mTORC2 assembly and function in some, but not all, cell types (114). Thus, it is possible that the activation of lipolysis observed following exposure to rapamycin could be due to the indirect inhibition of the mTORC2-Akt axis. One study in rats suggests that this is effectively the case (40). Unfortunately, the impact of rapamycin on mTORC2 function was not assessed in most of the studies cited above (2, 14, 77, 86, 99, 121). Although genetic evidence supports a direct role for mTORC1 in the control of adipocyte lipolysis (14), adipose-specific deletion of *Raptor* in mice does not affect lipolysis (101). The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Additional work is needed to better understand the mechanisms of action and the contribution of each mTOR complex to the regulation of lipolysis.

## ROLE OF mTOR SIGNALING IN β-OXIDATION

As discussed above, the breakdown of triglycerides in white adipose tissue is very important for the adaptation to fasting. The fatty acids released in the bloodstream are catabolized in peripheral tissues through a process termed β-oxidation, which provides the carbon intermediates and reducing equivalents required to sustain the energy needs of tissues when access to food is limited. Additionally, β-oxidation in the liver is key to support the production of ketone bodies, a source of energy released by the liver that is essential to maintain brain activity during prolonged fasting. From a functional perspective, it is not surprising to see that the activation of lipolysis and that of β-oxidation are tightly coupled, with lipolysis providing the substrates to feed β-oxidation. In the previous section, we reviewed several studies linking mTOR signaling to lipolysis. Some evidence

indicates that mTOR complexes also play roles in β-oxidation. We review these findings in the following section.

# mTORC1

In vitro, inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin increases β-oxidation and the expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadvl) and carnitine-palmitoyltransferase-1 (Cpt1) (11, 97). Rapamycin also increases β-oxidation in skeletal muscle (120). These results suggest that mTORC1 acutely inhibits fatty acid oxidation. The confirmation of a key role for mTORC1 in the control of β-oxidation comes from results produced with transgenic mice with constitutive mTORC1 signaling in their liver. One group reported that constitutive activation of mTORC1 in mouse liver severely reduces the ability of hepatocytes to turn on β-oxidation in response to fasting (115). This effect was linked to a severe defect in the expression of genes promoting fatty acid catabolism. Conversely, loss of Raptor

increased the expression of many of these genes, confirming the key role of mTORC1 in the transcriptional regulation of β-oxidation (115). As briefly discussed at the beginning of this section, β-oxidation in the liver is important to drive the production of ketone bodies during fasting. Interestingly, mice with constitutive activation of mTORC1 are unable to turn on ketogenesis when fasted (115). Mechanistically, mTORC1 impairs the activity of PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of liver β-oxidation, by promoting the nuclear accumulation of nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1). NCoR1 is a transcriptional regulator that binds several nuclear receptors to silence their activity. This factor represses gene transcription in part by promoting deacetylation of core histones through the recruitment of histone deacetylases. A recent study confirmed the link between mTORC1, NcoR1, and PPARα and further identified S6K2 as a downstream effector mediating the effect of mTORC1 on NCoR1 nuclear localization (Figure 6). In this latter report, the authors showed that mice lacking S6K2 exhibit enhanced PPARα activity, expression of oxidative genes, and elevated levels of ketone bodies (58). These results suggest an important role of mTORC1 signaling for the adaptation to fasting.

It is important to point out that the relation between mTORC1 and β-oxidation may not be as straightforward as described above. It has been observed that mTORC1 promotes the expression of several genes coding for protein regulating mitochondrial metabolism (20, 60). Moreover, genetic ablation of mTORC1 in mouse heart or skeletal muscle reduces mitochondrial number and the expression of oxidative genes (8, 105, 117). Several studies have reported that mTORC1 induces oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis by promoting the expression and activity of PPAR-γ coactivator-1α (PGC1α), a nuclear cofactor that controls the expression of key mitochondrial genes (19, 20, 139). Such induction in PGC1α was recently shown to promote the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21, a secreted factor recognized to promote hepatic lipid oxidation (19). These results support the idea that mTORC1 activation could promote, rather than inhibit, fatty acid oxidation. The reasons for these different conclusions are unknown. It is possible that the role of mTORC1 in mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism may differ between cell types and tissues. Moreover, chronic versus acute inhibition of mTORC1 may have different impacts on mitochondrial lipid oxidation. Additional studies are needed to test these possibilities.

**Figure 5**

Impact of mTOR signaling on lipolysis. The β-adrenergic system is a key activator of lipolysis in fat cells. Mechanistically, β-adrenergic stimulation promotes an elevation in intracellular cAMP levels, which activates PKA. When active, PKA directly phosphorylates HSL and the lipid droplet-associated protein perilipin-1, which facilitates the interaction of HSL with the lipids and the efficiency of the lipolytic process. ATGL action is also induced by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of perilipin-1. The phosphorylation of perilipin-1 causes the release of comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) from the lipid droplet, which allows CGI-58 to interact with ATGL to promote its hydrolase activity. On the other hand, insulin serves as a negative regulator of lipolysis. Insulin promotes the phosphorylation and activation of several PDEs, which increases PDE-mediated degradation of cAMP and inhibition of PKA. The inhibition of PKA reduces the efficiency of lipolysis by blocking the activation of HSL and ATGL. mTOR signaling inhibits the breakdown of intracellular triglycerides. mTORC1 promotes the ability of Egr1 to repress the transcription of *ATGL*. mTORC1 also reduces PKA-mediated phosphorylation/activation of HSL through a mechanism that remains to be determined. In contrast, mTORC2 contributes to the suppression of lipolysis in response to insulin. Through an Akt-dependent mechanism, mTORC2 negatively regulates lipolysis by blocking cAMP-mediated activation of PKA and HSL. This involves the activation of PDEs.

Impact of mTORC1 signaling on β-oxidation. mTORC1 activation reduces β-oxidation by reducing the expression of several genes coding for proteins involved in the oxidation of fatty acids. When activated, mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K2, which enables the recruitment of NCoR1 to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NCoR1 interacts with PPARα and blocks the transcription of oxidative genes. Some evidence also indicates that mTORC1 can induce oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis by promoting PGC1α expression and activation.

### mTORC2

The role of mTORC2 in modulating β-oxidation is less clear. Recently, one group observed that liver-specific Rictor knockout mice exhibit an increase in the expression of several genes encoding proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation (34). A similar phenotype was observed in brown adipose tissue of Myf5-specific Rictor knockout mice (42). In this last study, the increase in the expression of oxidative genes was detected relatively late during development and was preceded by a rapid decrease in the expression of several lipogenic genes (42). This observation confirms the role of mTORC2 in promoting lipogenesis but raises important questions as to the role of mTORC2 in regulating β-oxidation. Indeed, an increase in oxidative metabolism is commonly observed when lipogenesis is impaired (1, 92, 126). Such elevation in β-oxidation is thought to be necessary to eliminate the excess of fatty acids when the potential for fatty acid esterification is reduced. This phenomenon may be important to reduce the toxic effects of fatty acids in cells and tissues (74).

is thus possible that the increase in fatty acid oxidation observed in the absence of *Rictor* could be an indirect consequence of the lipogenic defects induced by the loss of mTORC2. At this stage, more studies are needed to better define the role of mTORC2 in regulating β-oxidation.

# CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this review, we have discussed the implication of mTOR signaling in the regulation of lipid metabolism in mammals. From a general perspective, the results presented indicate that in response to food intake, the activation of both mTOR complexes triggers several biological processes oriented toward promoting energy conservation. In response to anabolic signals, mTORC1 and mTORC2 facilitate the accumulation of triglycerides by promoting adipogenesis and lipogenesis. These complexes also insure the optimal storage of energy by shutting down catabolic processes such as lipolysis and β-oxidation. Despite major progress made in the comprehension of the mechanisms linking mTOR complexes to lipid metabolism, several questions remain to be answered. These unresolved issues, which were highlighted throughout this review, have to be clarified to improve our comprehension of the mechanisms regulating lipid homeostasis.
