and behaviour. Leptin, insulin, and melanocortin receptor agonists are potent anorexigen². Absence of leptin³ or melanocortin receptors² or neuron-specific deletion of insulin receptors⁴ causes hyperphagia and obesity. Glucose⁵ and fatty acids⁶ also modulate the activity of neurons that regulate appetite. The central nervous system signalling networks that mediate the actions of hormones and nutrients on energy balance are of key interest. AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of catalytic α-subunits and regulatory β- and γ-subunits¹. AMPK is regulated by the cellular AMP/ATP ratio and by upstream kinases¹,⁷. AMPK is activated by stress and regulates cellular metabolism by inhibiting energy consuming pathways and inducing pathways that generate ATP¹. It is widely expressed—locations include neurons and glial cells⁸,⁹. We hypothesized that hypothalamic AMPK might mediate hormonal and nutrient effects on food intake and energy balance.

First we assessed whether leptin alters hypothalamic AMPK activity. The accuracy of dissection of hypothalamic nuclei was assessed by measuring the expression of neuropeptides expressed in distinct hypothalamic regions¹⁰ (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1). Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of leptin in free-moving fasted mice decreased α2AMPK activity in PVH and arcuate hypothalamus (ARH) at 3 and 6 h after injection (Fig. 1a). In contrast, leptin did not affect AMPK activity in other medial hypothalamic regions (ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH, and dorsomedial hypothalamus, DMH) or in lateral hypothalamus (LH). Moreover, α1AMPK activity did not change in response to leptin in any hypothalamic region (not shown). Baseline α2AMPK activity was high in the cortex and was unaltered by leptin administration. Intrahypothalamic injection of leptin had similar effects to i.p. injection and inhibited α2AMPK activity selectively in PVH and ARH (Fig. 1b). These effects could be direct or indirect via neuronal networks. In contrast to the restricted effect of leptin on AMPK activity, i.p. and intrahypothalamic leptin both increased STAT3 phosphorylation in all hypothalamic regions, with greater effects in ARH and VMH/DMH than in PVH and LH (Fig. 1c).

The melanocortin (MC) 4 receptor pathway potently inhibits appetite and at least partially mediates the anorexigenic effect of leptin². Injection of MT-II, an agonist for MC3 and 4 receptors², into the lateral ventricle (intracerebroventricularly, i.c.v.) inhibited α2AMPK activity in PVH (Fig. 1d), similar to leptin. There was no effect of MT-II in the medial hypothalamus and, similar to leptin, there was no effect in LH or cortex. Insulin is also a potent anorexigenic hormone²,¹¹. Insulin i.c.v. reduced α2AMPK activity by 25–40% in all hypothalamic regions but not in cortex (Fig. 2d). Thus, the effect of insulin was more widespread in the hypothalamus than that of leptin or MT-II.

Brain glucose concentrations regulate neuronal firing rate⁵ and a rise in glucose may suppress feeding behaviour and alter autonomic tone⁵. Glucose injection (i.p.) in awake mice suppressed α2AMPK activity in all hypothalamic regions but not cortex (Fig. 1e). Because systemic injection of glucose causes hyperglycaemia (12.2 ± 1.3 mM in i.p. glucose-injected mice; 5.1 ± 0.4 mM in saline-injected mice), which stimulates insulin secretion (0.89 ± 0.14 ng ml⁻¹ in i.p. glucose-injected mice; 0.09 ± 0.01 ng ml⁻¹ in saline-injected mice) and alters levels of substrates such as fatty acids, we subsequently injected glucose i.c.v. (100 μg) to determine the impact of changes in brain glucose concentrations *per se*. Glucose injection (i.c.v.) did not change serum glucose (5.7 ± 0.2 mM) or insulin (0.12 ± 0.002 ng ml⁻¹) levels, compared with the saline-injected controls (glucose: 5.3 ± 0.3 mM, insulin: 0.11 ± 0.02 ng ml⁻¹). However, α2AMPK activity was suppressed in all hypothalamic regions, similar to the effects of i.p. glucose (Fig. 1e). Thus, the AMPK pathway appears to respond coordinately to several anorexigenic inputs. Neither i.p. nor i.c.v. glucose or insulin or MT-II affected α1AMPK activity.

Refeeding rapidly reduced AMPK activity in all hypothalamic nuclei, demonstrating the physiological significance (Fig. 1f). This

Obesity is an epidemic in Western society, and causes rapidly accelerating rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), functions as a ‘fuel gauge’ to monitor cellular energy status¹. We investigated the potential role of AMPK in the hypothalamus in the regulation of food intake. Here we report that AMPK activity is inhibited in arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) by the anorexigenic hormone leptin, and in multiple hypothalamic regions by insulin, high glucose and refeeding. A melanocortin receptor agonist, a potent anorexigen², decreases AMPK activity in PVH, whereas agouti-related protein, an orexigen², increases AMPK activity. Melanocortin receptor signalling is required for leptin and refeeding effects on AMPK in PVH. Dominant negative AMPK expression in the hypothalamus is sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight, whereas constitutively active AMPK increases both. Alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity augment changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression induced by fasting and feeding. Furthermore, inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK is necessary for leptin’s effects on food intake and body weight, as constitutively active AMPK blocks these effects. Thus, hypothalamic AMPK plays a critical role in hormonal and nutrient-derived anorexigenic and orexigenic signals and in energy balance.

Multiple factors regulate food intake, including hormones, fuels

effect persisted until at least 6 h of refeeding (not shown). In mice that were refed after an overnight fast, α2AMPK activity decreased in all hypothalamic regions (Fig. 1f), possibly owing to refeeding-induced elevation in serum glucose (9.7 ± 0.4 versus 6.4 ± 0.2 mM in fasted) and/or serum insulin (1.16 ± 0.32 versus 0.16 ± 0.03 ng ml⁻¹ in fasted). In contrast, agouti-related protein (AGRP) i.c.v. increased α2AMPK activity from the refeeding to the fasting level in PVH only. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) did not change α2AMPK activity in any hypothalamic region. Neither AGRP nor NPY altered α2AMPK activity in the fasted state (not shown), probably owing to AMPK activity already being high.

AGRP is a specific competitive antagonist of MC3 and MC4 receptors<sup>12</sup>; some effects of leptin in PVH are mediated by the MC4 receptor<sup>2</sup>. The reciprocal effects of AGRP and MT-II on AMPK activity in PVH indicate that PVH AMPK activity is regulated by MC3/4 receptors. Therefore, we examined regulation of AMPK activity in PVH in MC4 receptor knockout mice. α2AMPK activity in PVH did not decrease in response to i.p. leptin or refeeding in MC4 receptor knockout mice (Fig. 1g). Thus, the decrease of α2AMPK activity in PVH in response to leptin or refeeding depends on MC4 receptor signalling.

To determine whether modulation of hypothalamic AMPK activity alters food intake and body weight, we expressed constitutively active (CA, H150R mutation in the γ1 subunit of AMPK) (Supplementary Methods) and dominant negative (DN) α1 (D157A)<sup>13</sup> and α2 (K45R) (Supplementary Methods) subunits of AMPK in the medial hypothalamus using recombinant adenoviruses. We expressed α1 and α2 DN-AMPK simultaneously for maximal effects on AMPK activity, because in the absence of α2AMPK, α1AMPK can upregulate<sup>14</sup> and in preliminary experiments, α1AMPK activity increased when we expressed only α2 DN-AMPK. The DN effect results from competition of the catalytically inactive α-subunits with endogenous wild-type α-subunits, for binding to β- and γ-subunits<sup>13</sup>. Control mice were injected with an adenovirus with no insert ('Null'). The VMH was chosen as the injection site to mimic the widespread effects of many anorexigenic factors on AMPK activity in the hypothalamus.

The recombinant adenoviruses expressed AMPK subunit messenger RNA primarily in ARH, VMH and DMH with very low-level expression in PVH and LH (Fig. 2a). Corresponding proteins were also detected in the ARH and VMH/DMH (Fig. 2b). Consistent with these results, immunohistochemistry with an antibody recognizing enhanced GFP (eGFP), also encoded in the α2 DN-AMPK adenovirus, showed many positive cells and fibres in VMH and DMH, the injection site of the adenoviruses (Fig. 2c). In ARH, several cells and many fibres were also positive. There were many positive fibres but no positive cells in PVH, LH and perifornical area.

In the first 2 days after adenovirus injection, all mice lost weight (Fig. 2d). However, mice expressing CA-AMPK regained weight more rapidly than controls. In contrast, mice with DN-AMPK lost more weight than controls or CA-AMPK-expressing mice and regained weight more slowly. These changes could at least partly be explained by alterations in food intake (Fig. 2e). Mice with DN-AMPK ate 0.3–0.5 g per day less than controls and those with CA-AMPK ate 0.3–0.5 g per day more starting at 4 days after adenovirus injections (Fig. 2e). Cumulative food intake over 8 days was also increased in CA-AMPK mice (50.5 ± 0.8 g, n = 25) compared to controls (47.8 ± 0.8 g, n = 26, P < 0.05) and was reduced in DN-AMPK mice (45.2 ± 0.6 g, n = 27, P < 0.05). Thus,

Serum glucose in wild type (WT) and MC4R-KO was 5.3 ± 0.3 and 5.5 ± 0.3 mM, respectively, and serum insulin was 0.17 ± 0.03 and 0.26 ± 0.09 ng ml⁻¹, respectively. *P* < 0.05 versus saline.

modulation of hypothalamic AMPK activity is sufficient to alter food intake and body weight.

To explore the mechanism(s) for these effects, we examined hypothalamic neuropeptide expression. Under *ad libitum* fed conditions, DN-AMPK decreased neuropeptide Y (NPY) and AGRP mRNA levels in ARH (Fig. 2f) whereas CA-AMPK had no effect. In contrast, CA-AMPK enhanced the fasting-induced increase in NPY (60% > fasting Null; \(P < 0.01\)) and AGRP mRNA levels (30% > fasting Null; \(P < 0.05\)). In mice expressing DN-AMPK, fasting increased NPY and AGRP expression similar to controls. Thus, DN- and CA-AMPK reciprocally regulate NPY and AGRP expression in ARH, depending on the feeding state, suggesting that high AMPK activity enhances orexigenic signals in the fasting state, whereas low AMPK activity suppresses these signals under *ad libitum* fed conditions. Consistent with these changes, CA-AMPK but not Null or DN-AMPK increased expression of melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), another orexigenic neuropeptide, in LH in response to fasting. This increase in MCH expression is probably secondary to changes in neuronal activity in the medial

hypothalamus including NPY/AGRP neurons, because we find very few eGFP-positive cells in LH (Fig. 2c). In contrast, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expression in ARH responded normally to fasting in CA-AMPK-expressing mice. The lower POMC mRNA level in DN-AMPK-expressing mice under *ad libitum* conditions most probably reflects lowered body weight, food intake and serum leptin levels. These results indicate that POMC neurons respond physiologically in DN- and CA-AMPK-expressing mice, without augmentation or impairment of the fasting response.

To determine whether inhibition of AMPK activity in the hypothalamus is required for leptin's effect on food intake and body weight, we injected fasted mice expressing DN- or CA-AMPK in the medial hypothalamus with leptin. In control mice (adenovirus alone, Null), leptin decreased body weight by 2 g over 24 h compared to a slight increase in body weight in saline-injected control mice (Fig. 3a). Leptin also decreased body weight in mice expressing DN-AMPK. In contrast, in mice expressing CA-AMPK, body weight after saline injection was slightly greater than in saline-injected control (Null) mice, and leptin had a markedly attenuated

effect on body weight (Fig. 3a). Effects on food intake paralleled the effects on body weight. Leptin decreased food intake from 5.1 ± 0.2 g for 24 h at baseline to 2.9 ± 0.2 g in control mice (Fig. 3b). Food intake was decreased in mice with DN-AMPK at baseline and leptin further inhibited food intake to a level similar to leptin-treated control mice. However, in mice expressing CA-AMPK, food intake was increased at baseline and failed to be significantly suppressed by leptin. Thus, suppression of AMPK activity in the medial hypothalamus is necessary for leptin's anorexic and weight loss effects and lack of suppression causes leptin resistance.

In control mice (Null) in the fasted state, α2AMPK activity in all hypothalamic regions was similar to the activity in fasted mice with no adenovirus treatment (Fig. 1a). Intrahypothalamic leptin in null mice decreased α2AMPK activity in PVH and ARH (Fig. 3c), as was seen in mice with no adenovirus treatment (Fig. 1b). In mice with DN-AMPK, baseline α2AMPK activity was decreased in PVH, ARH and VMH/DMH and leptin had no further effect. In fasted mice expressing CA-AMPK, baseline α2AMPK was increased in VMH/DMH and leptin failed to decrease α2AMPK activity in PVH, ARH or VMH/DMH (Fig. 3c). α2AMPK protein level did not change (Supplementary Fig. 2).

We hypothesized that AMPK activity was not increased in the fasted state in some hypothalamic nuclei of mice expressing CA-AMPK because AMPK activity is already elevated with fasting. Hence we measured total (α1 and α2) AMPK activity after refeeding. In mice with adenovirus-null, refeeding decreased AMPK activity in the ARH and VMH/DMH to comparable levels as DN-AMPK (Fig. 3d). In contrast, in mice with CA-AMPK, total AMPK activity in ARH and VMH/DMH was constitutively elevated in the refed state. Consistent with the AMPK activity, food consumption during 3 h of refeeding was increased in mice with CA-AMPK and decreased in mice with DN-AMPK (Null: 1.54 ± 0.19 g per mouse, DN: 1.28 ± 0.10, CA: 1.94 ± 0.16, \(P < 0.05\) for DN or CA versus Null).

The effects of DN- and CA-AMPK could not be explained by alterations in STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or protein level in the hypothalamus, because leptin’s effect of increasing STAT3 phosphorylation was normal in ARH and VMH/DMH in mice with DN-AMPK and slightly enhanced in ARH in mice with CA-AMPK (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 2). In spite of this enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in the ARH of CA-AMPK mice, leptin did not reduce food intake. This suggests that the early steps in leptin signalling are intact in the hypothalamus of mice expressing DN- or CA-AMPK, and that AMPK functions either downstream of, or in a parallel pathway to, STAT3 to modulate its effects on food intake.

Our data show that hypothalamic AMPK activity is suppressed by multiple anorexigenic factors and increased by the orexigenic peptide, AGRP. (In agreement with this, we note a recent report¹⁵, appearing online after we submitted the present Letter, showing that leptin inhibits, and ghrelin stimulates, hypothalamic AMPK activity.) We show that these effects are important in normal physiology because modulation of hypothalamic AMPK activity is sufficient to alter food intake and body weight (Fig. 2d, e). Furthermore, suppression of AMPK activity is necessary for the anorexic and weight loss effects of leptin (Fig. 3a, b). Thus, our data establish a novel pathway for the regulation of food intake which, in response to leptin, most probably acts in a coordinate

manner with the STAT3<sup>16</sup> and PI3 kinase<sup>17,18</sup> pathways (Fig. 4).

All physiological anorexigenic signals that we examined inhibit α2AMPK activity in the ARH and PVH. In the ARH, NPY and AGRP but not POMC neurons are affected (see model, Fig. 4). The possibility that another pathway in addition to STAT3 is critical for leptin's effects on expression of NPY and AGRP, but not POMC, was suggested in studies of a transgenic mouse expressing leptin receptors with a mutation in the tyrosyl residue required for STAT3 phosphorylation<sup>16</sup>. Similarly, inhibition of CPT1 in the hypothalamus in rats results in alterations in NPY and AGRP but not POMC expression<sup>19</sup>, also supporting the notion that these neuropeptides are regulated by different signalling pathways.

Our data suggest that alterations in AMPK activity in the PVH are mediated by the MC4 receptor, and are secondary to changes in activity of arcuate AGRP neurons (Fig. 4). AGRP competitively antagonizes the stimulatory effects of POMC neurons on the MC4 receptor<sup>12</sup>. Furthermore, NPY functionally inhibits the MC4 receptor pathway in PVH<sup>20</sup>. The effect of anorexigenic signals on AMPK activity in PVH appears to be mediated through MC4 receptors, as it can be mimicked with an MC3/4R agonist (Fig. 1d) and it is absent in MC4 receptor knockout mice (Fig. 1g). Although STAT3 and possibly PI3 kinase pathways may play a role in suppressing the

activity of NPY/AGRP neurons, we propose that decreased ARH AMPK activity enhances this suppression, leading to activation of MC4 receptor signalling in PVH neurons. MC4 receptor activation decreases AMPK activity in PVH, which probably further enhances neurotransmission required for regulation of food intake and energy balance. In addition, our data indicate that insulin, glucose and refeeding also decrease α2AMPK activity in other hypothalamic regions, suggesting that these hormonal and nutritional signals recruit additional pathways that may regulate energy balance and have other physiological functions.

The effect of AMPK may be through transcriptional effects<sup>1</sup>, actions on ion channels<sup>21,22</sup> or changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (ref. 23). Leptin, MT-II, insulin and glucose each alter the activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels<sup>24,25</sup> and other ion channels in neurons<sup>20</sup>, some of which regulate cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. These results are also consistent with increased hypothalamic malonyl-CoA levels<sup>26,27</sup> and direct inhibition of hypothalamic CPT1<sup>19</sup> decreasing food intake. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved energy-sensing enzyme, AMPK, regulates energy balance in higher organisms not only by altering metabolism<sup>1,28,29</sup>, but also by responding to nutritional and hormonal signals governing food intake. Understanding the integration of this pathway with other afferent signals could lead to new approaches to prevent or reverse obesity.

### Methods

#### Animals
Male FVB mice (aged 7–9 weeks) were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 14/10-h light/dark cycle. Mice were given chow (Formulab 5008; Farmer’s Exchange) and water freely before beginning experiments. Some mice were implanted with chronic cannulas in the medial hypothalamus bilaterally 2 weeks before experiments. Other mice were implanted with an unilateral chronic cannula in the lateral ventricle. Leptin (10 ng) was injected through the cannula in the medial hypothalamus. Insulin (1 pmol), MT-II (30 pmol), NPY (10 nmol) and AGRP (10 nmol) were injected i.c.v. through the cannula in the lateral ventricle. In some mice, including MC4 receptor knockout mice, leptin (3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) or saline was injected i.p. In other mice, adenoviruses expressing dominant negative α1<sup>13</sup> or α2AMPK (Supplementary Methods), constitutively active γ1 (Supplementary Methods), a control adenoviral vector without DNA insert were injected into the medial hypothalamus bilaterally 2 weeks after catheter implantation. Body weight and food intake were monitored daily. Mice were killed by decapitation and hypothalamic nuclei and parietal cortex were quickly dissected. All assays were performed on hypothalamic regions from individual mice. Stereotaxic coordinates for intrahypothalamic cannula and injections are described in Supplementary Methods.

#### Dissection of hypothalamic regions and cortex
Each hypothalamic region and parietal cortex were dissected from 1-mm-thick sagittal sections of fresh brain. PVH, ARH, VMH plus DMH, and parietal cortex were dissected from the first sections from the midline of the brain, and LH was dissected from the next lateral sections. In some experiments, ARH and VMH plus DMH were dissected together. Coordinates for each hypothalamic region are described in Supplementary Methods.

#### Measurement of AMPK activity
To measure α1 and α2 isoform-specific AMPK activity in the hypothalamic regions and cortex, we immunoprecipitated each AMPK from lysates from individual mice (40–50 μg of protein) with specific antibodies against the α1- (ref. 30) and α2-subunits (ref. 30) bound to protein-G sepharose beads. To measure total AMPK activity, we used a specific antibody<sup>13</sup> against the β-subunits bound to protein-A and -G sepharose beads. The kinase activity of the immunoprecipitates was measured using ‘SAMS’ peptide and [γ<sup>-32</sup>P]ATP<sup>31</sup>.

#### Measurement of mRNA levels of neuropeptides
mRNA levels of TRH, AGRP, NPY, POMC and MCH were quantified with real time PCR, as described in Supplementary Methods. All data were expressed as a ratio of the neuropeptide mRNA to cyclophilin mRNA. The data are shown as a percentage of the ratio in null fed mice.

#### Immunohistochemistry with eGFP antibody
Mice were injected with an adenovirus expressing both DN-α2AMPK and eGFP (2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> p.f.u. per 0.1 μl, Supplementary Methods) into the medial hypothalamus bilaterally, using brain cannula implanted with stereotaxic coordinates as described above. Six days after adenovirus injection, animals underwent transcardiac formalin fixation and immunohistochemistry of brain was performed with an eGFP antibody (1:20,000, Molecular Probes).

#### Western blot analysis
Phosphorylation of STAT3 in hypothalamic regions and cortex was determined with 10% SDS acrylamide gels using an antibody against the phospho-tyrosine 705 of STAT3 (Cell Signalling). The protein levels of α1 and α2AMPK<sup>30</sup> and STAT3 (Santa Cruz)

**Figure 4** Proposed model for role of AMPK in anorexigenic signalling in the hypothalamus. Anorexigenic signals activate POMC neurons in ARH (arcuate hypothalamus) via STAT3 and possibly also PI3 kinase, generating a second anorexigenic signal mediated by α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). In contrast, the anorexigenic signals suppress the activity of NPY/AGRP neurons, partly via STAT3 and possibly also PI3 kinase, and decrease AMPK activity in these neurons. Decreased AMPK activity enhances the suppression of NPY/AGRP effects, leading to activation of MC4 receptor signalling in PVH (paraventricular hypothalamus) neurons. MC4 receptor activation decreases AMPK activity in PVH, which probably further enhances neurotransmission required for regulation of food intake and energy balance. Decreased NPY signalling in PVH functionally enhances the MC4 receptor signalling pathway. In addition, decreased AMPK activity in other hypothalamic regions may enhance the MC4 receptor signalling pathway by projections to the ARH or PVH (for example, NPY neurons in DMH) and recruit additional pathways that may regulate food intake.

in the hypothalamic regions were determined.

To detect protein expression of α1 and α2 DN-AMPK and γ1 CA-AMPK in the hypothalamus after injection of adenoviruses, we immunoprecipitated AMPK from hypothalamic lysates (500 μg of protein pooled from 5–6 animals) with a polyclonal antiserum recognizing the α1, α2, β1, β2 and γ1 subunits of AMPK (for CA-AMPK) (gift from D. Carling) or this antiserum combined with sheep α1 and α2 antiserum (for DN-AMPK) bound to protein-A and -G sepharose beads, and blotted with monoclonal antibodies against the c-Myc tag (for α1 and α2 DN-AMPK) (9B11, Cell Signalling) or the HA tag (for γ1 CA-AMPK) (Roche).

### Detection of mRNA of DN- and CA-AMPK

Total RNA was isolated from PVH, ARH, VMH/DMH and LH by TriReagent (Molecular Research Center). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using reverse transcriptase (Ambion) primed by random decamer.

The chemotaxis network that governs the motion of *Escherichia coli* has long been studied to gain a general understanding of signal transduction. Although this pathway is composed of just a few components, it exhibits some essential characteristics of biological complexity, such as adaptation and response to environmental signals¹. In studying intracellular networks, most experiments and mathematical models²⁻⁵ have assumed that network properties can be inferred from population measurements. However, this approach masks underlying temporal fluctuations of intracellular signalling events. We have inferred fundamental properties of the chemotaxis network from a noise analysis of behavioural variations in individual bacteria. Here we show that certain properties established by population measurements, such as adapted states, are not conserved at the single-cell level: for timescales ranging from seconds to several minutes, the behaviour of non-stimulated cells exhibit temporal variations much larger than the expected statistical fluctuations. We find that the signalling network itself causes this noise and identify the molecular events that produce it. Small changes in the concentration of one key network component suppress temporal behavioural variability, suggesting that such variability is a selected property of this adaptive system.

At the level of populations, it is well-established that the chemotaxis network produces a steady output in the absence of external stimuli, generally referred to as ‘adapted steady-states’. This mechanism³ allows bacteria to maintain their steady-state behaviour independently of the absolute concentration of chemo-effectors in their environment⁵. Because the network’s output from individual cells is noisy (that is, it fluctuates randomly), it is standard practice
