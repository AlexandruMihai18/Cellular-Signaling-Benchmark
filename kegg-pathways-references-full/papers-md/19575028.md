**Structure and signalling in the IL-17 receptor family**

**Sarah L. Gaffen**

Abstract | Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), the hallmark cytokine of the newly defined T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cell subset, has important roles in protecting the host against extracellular pathogens, but also promotes inflammatory pathology in autoimmune disease. IL-17A and its receptor (IL-17RA) are the founding members of a newly described family of cytokines and receptors that have unique structural features which distinguish them from other cytokine families. Research defining the signal transduction pathways induced by IL-17R family cytokines has lagged behind that of other cytokine families, but studies in the past 2 years have begun to delineate unusual functional motifs and new proximal signalling mediators used by the IL-17R family to mediate downstream events.

**T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells**

The two main subsets of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cells produce interferon-γ and tumour necrosis factor, thereby promoting cell-mediated immunity that is mainly directed towards intracellular pathogens. T<sub>H</sub>2 cells produce interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13, thereby supporting humoral immunity and counteracting T<sub>H</sub>1 cell responses.

**T<sub>H</sub>17 cell**

A cell belonging to a newly described subset of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that is characterized by the production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-22, IL-21 and (in humans) IL-26. T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cells promote neutrophil activation and immunity to extracellular pathogens. They also promote inflammation in autoimmunity.

In 1986, a seminal paper by Coffman, Mosmann and colleagues postulated the existence of subsets of T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) cells characterized by the secretion of distinct cytokines, which were designated T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells<sup>1</sup>. Although this paradigm dominated for nearly 2 decades<sup>2</sup>, discrepancies arose as details of T<sub>H</sub> cell development became more refined. In particular, deficiency in interleukin-12 (IL-12) (specifically, the IL-12p40 subunit of this heterodimeric cytokine), which drives the development of the T<sub>H</sub>1 cell lineage, frequently failed to phenocopy deficiency in interferon-γ (IFNγ), the hallmark T<sub>H</sub>1-type cytokine<sup>3</sup>. The basis for this paradox became evident when it was recognized that IL-12p40 is also a component of IL-23 (together with IL-23p19), and so IL-12p40-deficient mice lack both IL-12 and IL-23 (REF. 4). Further studies showed that IL-23 stimulates the production of IL-17A by a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup>5,6</sup>, and IL-23p19-deficient mice, but not IL-12p35-deficient mice, are susceptible to certain autoimmune diseases<sup>7</sup>. This revealed a new branch of the T<sub>H</sub> cell family tree, now known as T<sub>H</sub>17 cells (TIMELINE).

Numerous reports rapidly followed describing the factors involved in the differentiation of this lineage, the additional cytokines produced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and the production of T<sub>H</sub>17-type cytokines by other cell subsets. To summarize briefly, T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation is regulated by the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and is driven by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), IL-1 and IL-6; IL-23 is required to expand and stabilize the cell population. In addition to IL-17A, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells produce IL-17F (discussed below), IL-21, IL-22 and IL-26, as well as chemokines such as CC-chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20; also known as MIP3α). T<sub>H</sub>17 cells function prominently at mucosal surfaces and trigger pro-inflammatory danger signals that promote neutrophil mobilization and the expression of antimicrobial factors. Furthermore, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells drive inflammatory pathology in various autoimmune conditions. Various T<sub>H</sub>17-like cells that produce a similar range of cytokines to T<sub>H</sub>17 cells also exist; these include γδ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NKT cells and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. The reader is referred to several excellent reviews on this topic<sup>8–10</sup>.

Less attention has been paid to the mechanisms by which IL-17 family cytokines mediate effects at a molecular level. IL-17A and its receptor (IL-17RA) are founding members of a newly described family of cytokines (IL-17A–IL-17F) and receptors, known as the IL-17R family (IL-17RA–IL-17RE) (TABLE 1). Receptors belonging to the IL-17R family have unique structural features and mediate signalling events that are surprisingly distinct from those triggered by other cytokine receptors, particularly those usually involved in adaptive immunity. The signature cytokines involved in the T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses trigger Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT signalling pathways, whereas IL-17R family cytokines mediate signalling through a distinct pathway that depends on ACT1 (also known as CIKS), culminating in the activation of pro-inflammatory mediators that are usually associated with innate immune signalling, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (BOX 1).

So, by virtue of the unusual signalling properties of IL-17, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells act as a bridge between adaptive and innate immunity<sup>11</sup>. Recent work has begun to define the architecture of the IL-17R family and its sometimes surprising ligand-receptor relationships and signal transduction pathways. This Review discusses recent discoveries in this field in the context of cytokine receptor biology and highlights the potential implications of this knowledge with respect to emerging therapeutics.

### γδT cell
A T cell that expresses a T cell receptor consisting of a γ-chain and a δ-chain. These T cells are present mainly in the intestinal epithelium as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Although the exact function of γδT cells (or IELs) is still unknown, it has been suggested that mucosal γδT cells are involved in innate immune responses mediated by the mucosal immune system.

### Lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cell
A cell that is present in developing lymph nodes, Peyer's patches and nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). LTi cells are required for the development of these lymphoid organs. The inductive capacity of these cells for the generation of Peyer's patches and NALT has been shown by adoptive transfer and it is generally assumed that they have a similar function in the formation of lymph nodes.

### IL-17 cytokines constitute a unique family
IL-17A was identified by a subtractive hybridization screen in a rodent T cell library<sup>12</sup> (TIMELINE), but was not immediately recognized as a cytokine owing to its unusual amino acid sequence. Subsequent characterization showed that IL-17A is produced by T cells and stimulates the production of factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-6 and IL-8, indicating that it should be considered a bona fide cytokine<sup>13,14</sup>. Intriguingly, the amino acid sequence of IL-17A is 58% identical to an open reading frame in Herpesvirus saimiri, a T cell-tropic gammaherpesvirus<sup>13</sup>, although the importance of homology to this viral protein (known as vIL-17) remains unknown. Genomic sequencing efforts led to the identification of several putative IL-17A homologues: IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E (also known as IL-25) and IL-17F. The only member of the family to have been crystallized for structural studies is IL-17F, which adopts a three-dimensional cysteine-knot fold architecture<sup>15</sup>. IL-17 family homologues have been found in various species, including sea lamprey, rainbow trout, zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans, among others<sup>16</sup>. Although the cellular sources and expression patterns of the various mammalian IL-17 family members are different (TABLE 1), they all have pro-inflammatory activities.

#### IL-17A and IL-17F drive inflammation and autoimmunity
IL-17A and IL-17F are by far the best characterized cytokines of the IL-17 cytokine family. Both are covalent homodimers, and recent findings show that they also form IL-17A–IL-17F heterodimers<sup>17,18</sup> (FIG. 1). IL-17A–IL-17F heterodimers are produced at higher levels than IL-17A homodimers by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells *in vitro*<sup>17</sup>, but the form that predominates *in vivo* is not well defined<sup>19</sup>. IL-17A, IL-17F and the IL-17A–IL-17F heterodimer signal through the same receptor subunits, IL-17RA and IL-17RC (also known as IL-17RL), which together form a heteromeric complex<sup>20,21</sup>. However, IL-17A and IL-17F have distinct biological effects. Studies comparing Il17a<sup>-/-</sup> mice with Il17f<sup>-/-</sup> mice indicate that IL-17A has a more important role in driving autoimmunity than IL-17F, probably owing to its more potent strength of signalling<sup>19,22</sup>. The role of the IL-17A–IL-17F heterodimer *in vivo* will be more challenging to evaluate. The basis for functional differences between IL-17A and IL-17F could be the markedly decreased strength of signalling triggered by IL-17F compared with IL-17A, as IL-17F-induced responses are 10–30-fold weaker in terms of downstream gene activation than those of IL-17A, with IL-17A–IL-17F heterodimers acting at an intermediate level<sup>17,23,24</sup>. The precise nature of their respective receptor complexes has not been defined (discussed further below). As IL-17RA

and IL-17RC have different affinities for IL-17A and IL-17F; it is plausible that different receptor complexes exist with varying ratios of IL-17RA and IL-17RC that have different ligand preferences.

**IL-17E is a T<sub>H</sub>2 cell-promoting cytokine.** IL-17E is produced by mucosal epithelial cells and many immune cell types (TABLE 1). Transgenic overexpression of IL-17E promotes eosinophilia and stimulates the production of T<sub>H</sub>2-type cytokines. Moreover, IL-17E limits T<sub>H</sub>17 cell development by inducing the expression of IL-13 by dendritic cells (DCs) or by inhibiting IL-23 production by macrophages (reviewed in REF. 25). IL-17E binds a receptor complex composed of IL-17RB (also known

Box 1 | **IL-17R signalling is a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity**

Traditional T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) and T<sub>H</sub>2 cell signature cytokines induce the activation of signalling pathways mediated by Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, with the T<sub>H</sub>1-type cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) activating a JAK1– and JAK2–STAT1-dependent pathway and the T<sub>H</sub>2-type cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) activating a JAK1– and JAK3–STAT6-dependent pathway. Activation of these pathways is crucial both for the effector functions of these cells and for their development. By contrast, IL-17A and IL-17F produced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells induce signalling mediated by ACT1 (also known as CIKS), TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and nuclear factor-κB, which is much more reminiscent of receptors associated with innate immunity, such as IL-1 family receptors and Toll-like receptors. Interestingly, another T<sub>H</sub>17 cell signature cytokine is IL-22, which activates a JAK1– and TYK2–STAT3 signalling pathway, but the downstream gene targets of which are markedly similar to the genes induced by IL-17. So, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells promote signals that are typical of early inflammatory events and in this sense serve to bridge innate and adaptive immune responses.

as IL-25R) and IL-17RA<sup>26</sup> (FIG. 1). Il17rb<sup>-/-</sup> and Il17ra<sup>-/-</sup> mice fail to respond to IL-17E, and both knockout strains are refractory to pulmonary inflammation induced by intranasal application of IL-17E<sup>27</sup>. Taken together, these observations indicate that there is intriguing crosstalk between members of the IL-17 cytokine family.

**IL-17B, IL-17C and IL-17D functions are poorly defined.** IL-17B, IL-17C and IL-17D remain poorly characterized. IL-17B binds to IL-17RB with fairly high affinity<sup>28</sup>, and IL-17C was recently reported to bind IL-17RE and to activate NF-κB (S. Levin, personal communication). The receptor (or receptors) for IL-17D remains unknown. Ectopic expression of IL-17B and IL-17C by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells exacerbates collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)<sup>29</sup>, and intranasal administration of adenoviruses expressing IL-17C, IL-17A or IL-17F triggers comparable responses by neutrophils<sup>30</sup>, suggesting that these cytokines mediate common biological effects, probably through shared signalling pathways. Antibodies specific for IL-17B also partially suppress CIA<sup>29</sup>. IL-17B and IL-17C stimulate the transcription of an array of pro-inflammatory genes similar to those induced by IL-17A and IL-17F<sup>29,31</sup>. IL-17D was reported to promote a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile in endothelial cells and to have a mild inhibitory effect on the proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells *in vitro*<sup>32</sup>. As more knockout mice are generated and the target receptors for IL-17B, IL-17C and IL-17D become more clearly defined, we will gain an improved understanding of these newly described IL-17 family members.

The IL-17R family

The IL-17R family comprises five receptor subunits, IL-17RA–IL-17RE³³ (FIG. 1). Despite considerable sequence divergence, many of the genes encoding the IL-17R family members are linked, with clusters on human chromosome 3 (for IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD and IL-17RE) and mouse chromosomes 6 (for IL-17RA, IL-17RC and IL-17RE) and 14 (for IL-17RB and IL-17RD). All of the receptor subunits are single transmembrane domain-containing proteins, ranging in size from 499 to 866 amino acids (with smaller alternatively spliced forms also found, as discussed below). These receptor subunits contain certain conserved structural motifs, including an extracellular fibronectin III-like domain and a cytoplasmic SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) domain (see below). Although it is still not clear precisely how IL-17R subunits interact to form productive receptor complexes, it is becoming evident that IL-17RA, which is by far the largest member of the family, is a common signalling subunit used by at least four ligands.

IL-17RA: expression and complex formation. IL-17RA was initially identified as the receptor for mammalian IL-17A and vIL-17 (REF. 13). IL-17RA also binds IL-17F, albeit weakly in humans, and is necessary for signal transduction mediated by IL-17A, IL-17A–IL-17F and IL-17F¹⁵. Early studies showed that the affinity of IL-17RA for IL-17A is lower than the concentration required to mediate responses, which indicates that an additional subunit is involved in binding ligand and/or eliciting signalling³⁴. Indeed, IL-17RA pairs with IL-17RC to induce responses to IL-17A and IL-17F³⁵. Similarly, *Il17ra*⁻/⁻ mice are refractory to the effects of IL-17E, suggesting that IL-17RA is also a component of this receptor complex²⁷. Moreover, IL-17RA might associate with IL-17RD, as these subunits colocalize, and overexpression of a mutant form of IL-17RD lacking a cytoplasmic tail inhibits IL-17A-dependent signals³⁶. However, this finding has yet to be validated, and no ligand has been identified for an IL-17RA–IL-17RD receptor complex (FIG. 1). As it is used by many cytokines, IL-17RA could be analogous to shared cytokine receptor subunits, such as gp130, which is a common signal transducer for molecules of the IL-6 family³⁷.

IL-17RA is expressed ubiquitously, with particularly high levels in haematopoietic tissues¹³,²². This expression pattern is interesting, as the main responses to IL-17A occur in epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts, although macrophages and DCs are also responsive (reviewed in REF. 38). Only a limited number of IL-17A-induced genes has been documented in lymphocytes, and these genes are distinct from those induced by IL-17A in other cell types²²,³⁹. Although its expression is widespread, IL-17RA can be dynamically regulated; for example, IL-15 and IL-21 upregulate the expression of IL-17RA by CD8⁺ T cells⁴⁰,⁴¹, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) limits the expression of IL-17RA by T cells. This could be biologically important, as IL-17A-induced signalling strength correlates with cell surface expression levels of IL-17RA; in contrast to most cytokine receptors, high levels of IL-17RA seem to be required for effective responses to IL-17A⁴²,⁴³. Another function of IL-17RA might be to limit signalling by receptor-mediated internalization of the ligand. Indeed, surface expression of IL-17RA rapidly decreases after IL-17A binding, theoretically internalizing IL-17A and clearing it from the inflammatory milieu⁴¹.

The composition of IL-17RA-containing receptor complexes is poorly defined. The textbook paradigm of cytokine receptor signalling is that individual receptor subunits reside in the membrane as monomers. Ligand binding promotes subunit oligomerization, thereby juxtaposing receptor-associated signalling intermediates such as kinases or adaptors. Inconsistent with this view are studies showing that many receptors actually exist as pre-associated, multisubunit complexes (such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), tumour necrosis

The various receptor complexes through which each ligand is thought to induce signalling are shown, although it should be emphasized that in no case has the stoichiometry been shown definitively. The receptor for IL-17D is unknown, as is the ligand for IL-17RD or an IL-17RA–IL-17RD pairing if indeed it exists (see REF. 75).

Figure 2 | IL-17R-binding complexes and strategies for therapeutic blockade of IL-17 signalling. The interleukin-17 receptor (IL-17R) complex contains an undetermined number of IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits, although studies so far indicate that it might be at least trimeric, which is the form shown here. Both IL-17A and IL-17F signal through these subunits, although IL-17A has far higher affinity for IL-17RA than for IL-17RC, whereas IL-17F has a greater affinity for IL-17RC than for IL-17RA (in humans)²¹. Therefore, in humans soluble IL-17RA–Fc affects the response to IL-17A only, whereas soluble IL-17RA–Fc affects the response to both IL-17A and IL-17F in mice. Many cytokine-targeting strategies have been proposed to block signalling through IL-17R⁹². **a** | Antibodies specific for individual ligands or the individual receptor subunits are the most straightforward approach. **b** | In addition, soluble IL-17R subunits, such as fusions to IgG Fc, have been evaluated in pre-clinical models (reviewed in REF. 93). **c** | Finally, preventing receptor assembly by means of soluble peptides containing the pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD) of IL-17RA is another possible avenue for drug development, analogous to approaches used with tumour necrosis factor receptor signalling⁴⁷,⁵⁰.

factor receptors (TNFRs) and erythropoietin receptor (EPOR; reviewed in REFS 38,44). Mechanistically, pre-assembly poises a receptor to respond rapidly and specifically to a ligand. In the case of IL-17RA, studies using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to analyse interactions between IL-17RA subunits showed that IL-17RA forms ligand-independent complexes⁴⁵⁻⁴⁷. Moreover, IL-17RA co-immunoprecipitated with IL-17RC in overexpression studies in a ligand-dependent manner, although it is not known whether IL-17RC is pre-assembled with IL-17RA to any degree³⁵. The precise stoichiometry of the IL-17A-binding receptor complex has not been determined, but native gel analyses of IL-17RC indicate the existence of a trimeric complex containing two IL-17RA subunits and one IL-17RC subunit⁴⁸.

For pre-assembled receptors such as EPOR, ligand binding induces large conformational changes in the relative positions of the receptor subunits. This re-orients receptor-bound cytoplasmic signalling molecules such as JAKs, facilitating interactions with appropriate substrates⁴⁹. This might also apply for IL-17RA because FRET between IL-17RA molecules decreases following an interaction with a ligand⁴⁵,⁴⁶. One possible scenario is that IL-17RA dimers dissociate after ligand binding and are replaced by IL-17RA–IL-17RC heterodimers. Alternatively, IL-17RC might be recruited to the IL-17RA dimer to create a trimer or larger multimer, together with cytoplasmic signalling molecules such as ACT1. A better understanding of this process will be provided by the elucidation of the IL-17RA crystal structure.

In the TNFR system, pre-assembly of the receptor is dictated by an extracellular cysteine-rich motif known as a pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD). Soluble PLAD peptides have been shown to prevent TNFR assembly and thus block signalling in CIA⁵⁰. Although it is structurally distinct from TNFRs, IL-17RA contains a fibronectin III-like PLAD that dimerizes in a yeast two-hybrid system and is required for co-immunoprecipitation of IL-17RA dimers⁴⁵. Unlike the TNFR system, in which the PLAD and ligand-binding site of the receptor are physically distinct, the IL-17RA second fibronectin III-like motif is also an essential component of the IL-17A-binding domain⁴⁵. Consequently, strategies to block IL-17A or its receptor could include soluble PLAD peptides as well as antibodies or soluble receptors⁴⁷ (FIG. 2).

IL-17RA signalling: the NF-κB pathway. As IL-17RA is not homologous to any known receptors¹³, it was not possible to investigate signal transduction simply by comparing it with other cytokine receptor systems. However, studies defining IL-17A-induced genes showed that IL-17A activates a highly pro-inflammatory programme of gene expression, which is typical of that induced by innate immune receptors such as IL-1Rs and TLRs⁵¹,⁵². Similarly to these receptors, IL-17A activates NF-κB, a hallmark transcription factor associated with the induction of inflammation¹³ (FIG. 3a). Correspondingly, DNA elements that bind NF-κB in the promoters of several IL-17A target genes are required for IL-17A-induced gene expression (reviewed in REF. 38). Gel shift studies indicated that IL-17A activates p50 and p65, which are

Figure 3 | IL-17-induced signalling pathways. **a** | Schematic depicting interleukin-17 receptor (IL-17R) signalling. The IL-17R complex is composed of IL-17RA and IL-17RC. Both subunits encode SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) domains<sup>59</sup>, but a sequence similar to the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) BB-loop is found only in IL-17RA, termed a TIR-like loop (TILL)<sup>43</sup>. IL-17RA engages the SEFIR domain-containing adaptor ACT1 to mediate various downstream events<sup>62</sup>. Specifically, ACT1 is required for recruitment of TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and possibly TRAF3, which are essential upstream activators of the canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. It is not clear whether TRAF6 is also required for the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Act1<sup>-/-</sup> cells fail to upregulate the expression of the liver-enriched activator protein (LAP) and LAP* splice variants of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) or the expression of C/EBPδ, another event that might be downstream of NF-κB<sup>58,63</sup>. ACT1, but not TRAF6, is required for IL-17A-induced stabilization of several target mRNAs, particularly those encoding chemokines and cytokines<sup>66</sup>. Interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) might also be controlled, at least indirectly, by ACT1-independent pathways, as Act1<sup>-/-</sup> cells show strong upregulation of ERK phosphorylation 24 hours after IL-17A stimulation<sup>63</sup>. ERK mediates rapid phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on threonine 188 (REF. 61). A second functional domain on IL-17RA is located in the carboxy-terminal region and is not required for efficient activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. However, deletion of this domain results in impaired alternative translation of C/EBPβ from the LAP isoform to the LAP* isoform<sup>43</sup>, and hence was termed the C/EBPβ-activation domain (CBAD). The CBAD is also required for IL-17A-mediated inducible phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on threonine 179, which is mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)<sup>61</sup>. **b** | Comparison of IL-17R and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling. IL-17R and TLR (or IL-1R, not shown) signalling pathways use different functional receptor motifs (SEFIR and TILL versus Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domains) and proximal adaptors (ACT1 versus MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88) and TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFNβ)), but converge on common pathways (NF-κB, C/EBP and MAPKs). Therefore, these receptors activate similar, although not identical, panels of downstream genes. IκBζ, inhibitor of NF-κB-ζ; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; P13K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase.

components of the canonical NF-κB pathway<sup>53</sup>, but so far there is no evidence that the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is involved in IL-17RA signalling (S.L.G., unpublished observations). However, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which is a component of the non-canonical pathway, was reported to be activated in response to IL-17A<sup>54</sup>. IL-17A also induces the expression of inhibitor of NF-κB-ζ (IkBζ)<sup>51,55</sup>, which is a positive regulator of transcription triggered by the TLR and IL-1R signalling pathways<sup>55</sup>. It is therefore likely that IkBζ is involved in IL-17A-mediated gene expression, although this has not been clearly defined.

A wide diversity of inflammatory stimuli activate NF-κB, but they accomplish this through distinct proximal signalling pathways<sup>56</sup>. The proximal activators of NF-κB in the IL-17RA signalling pathway were unknown for a considerable length of time. Hints as to their identity came from observations that IL-17RA signalling had parallels with the IL-1R and TLR signalling cascades. For example, TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a key adaptor protein in the IL-1R and TLR signalling cascades, and fibroblasts from *Traf6*<sup>-/-</sup> mice are defective in IL-17A-mediated induction of NF-κB activation<sup>57</sup>. As IL-17RA does not have an obvious TRAF6-binding motif, it was suggested that a signalling intermediate might be required to bridge IL-17RA and TRAF6. However, molecules involved in proximal IL-1R and TLR signalling, such as MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88), TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFNβ), IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4) and IRAK1, are dispensable for IL-17A-mediated signalling<sup>43,58</sup> (F. Shen, L. Li and S.L.G., unpublished observations). Consequently, early IL-17RA signalling intermediates are distinct from classical activators of innate immune responses (FIG. 3b).

A SEFIR domain is also present in ACT1, a signalling adaptor that was previously linked to NF-κB activation through B cell activating factor (BAFF) and CD40 ligand<sup>59</sup>. Indeed, ACT1 deficiency in knockout mice or generated by RNA interference-mediated knockdown impairs IL-17A- and IL-17F-induced activation of NF-κB<sup>25,62</sup> (FIG. 3). Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that ACT1 is recruited to IL-17RA within 5 minutes of IL-17A stimulation<sup>63</sup>. Supporting these observations, deletion of the SEFIR domain in IL-17RA impairs the activation of NF-κB by IL-17A<sup>43,63</sup>. Unlike IL-17RA, ACT1 contains a TRAF6-binding motif and, accordingly, can bind TRAF6, TRAF3 and TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)<sup>63</sup>. However, ACT1-independent pathways are also induced by IL-17RA, as shown by the fact that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 are activated in *Act1*<sup>-/-</sup> cells in response to IL-17A, albeit with delayed kinetics<sup>63</sup>. The crucial role of ACT1 in IL-17RA signalling has recently been verified in a second knockout mouse model<sup>26</sup>. Intriguingly, the respiratory pathogen *Chlamydia pneumoniae* encodes an ACT1-binding protein that seems to inhibit IL-17RA signalling, presumably providing a survival advantage to this organism<sup>64</sup>. Collectively, these studies illustrate that the proximal events in IL-17RA-mediated activation of NF-κB differ from those of TLRs and IL-1Rs owing to unique structural components of IL-17RA (FIG. 3b).

**Canonical NF-κB pathway**
A typical pathway of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation that involves phosphorylation and degradation of the prototypical NF-κB inhibitor, inhibitor of NF-κB-α (IκBa).

**Non-canonical NF-κB pathway**
A pathway of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation that does not involve inhibitor of NF-κB-α (IκBa) degradation but relies on the processing of an NF-κB precursor protein, p100, leading to nuclear translocation of the p52–RELB NF-κB heterodimer.

**Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain**
An intracellular signalling domain that is found in interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor, Toll-like receptors and several adaptor proteins, including MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88).

**BB-loop**
A structured loop linking the second α-helix and the second β-sheet within Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains. This loop is a specificity determinant for TIR domains, and certain mutations in the BB-loop cause impairment of Toll-like receptor signalling.

**Exosome complex**
A multi-protein complex that degrades various forms of RNA. Certain mRNA transcripts (particularly those encoding cytokines and chemokines) are inherently unstable owing to the presence of AU-rich elements (AREs) located in the 3′ untranslated region. Proteins that bind to AREs target these transcripts to the exosome complex for degradation.

**IL-17RA signalling: AP1, MAPK and mRNA stability.**
Another typical event induced by pro-inflammatory mediators is the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, which leads to the activation of AP1 (activator protein 1). IL-17A induces the activation of various MAPKs, but ERK is generally the most strongly and rapidly phosphorylated. Although AP1 binding sites are enriched in IL-17A target promoters<sup>42</sup>, the AP1 site in the mouse *Il6* promoter is dispensable for IL-17A-induced activation<sup>53</sup>. The most important role of the MAPK pathway in IL-17A-induced signalling is controlling the stability of mRNA transcripts. MAPKs stabilize mRNA through the inhibition of destabilizing proteins such as tristetraprolin. Tristetraprolin binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNA transcripts and delivers them to the exosome complex, where they are degraded. Phosphorylation of tristetraprolin by MAPKs blocks its ability to recruit the degradative machinery, thereby increasing mRNA transcript half-life (reviewed in REF. 65). Many IL-17A target genes are chemokines or cytokines, the transcripts of which are destabilized by AREs located in the 3′ untranslated region<sup>65</sup>. Numerous studies show that activation of MAPKs by IL-17A significantly increases the concentration of these transcripts<sup>38</sup>. ACT1 is required for IL-17A-mediated stabilization of *Cxcl1* (CXC-chemokine ligand 1) mRNA, but TRAF6 is surprisingly dispensable<sup>66</sup>. Unexpectedly, the ability of IL-17A to stabilize TNF-induced *Cxcl1* mRNA is not compromised in tristetraprolin-deficient fibroblasts (T. Hamilton, personal communication). In addition to tristetraprolin, other proteins are involved in mediating cytokine mRNA stability, such as the recently described ZC3H12A<sup>67</sup>.

A key insight into IL-17R signalling emerged from a bioinformatics analysis that identified a conserved motif in the cytoplasmic domains of IL-17R family members that was homologous to the Toll/IL-1 R (TIR) domain<sup>9</sup>, which provides essential and specific docking sites for intracellular adaptors such as MYD88. This study named the conserved IL-17R region a SEFIR domain (see above). SEFIR domains lack certain elements found in prototypical TIR domains, potentially explaining why they do not engage TIR-containing adaptors. Specifically, SEFIR domains lack the TIR box 3 subdomain and the BB-loop<sup>59</sup>, which are crucial specificity determinants directing TIR-based protein–protein interactions<sup>60</sup>. However, a region at the carboxy-terminal side of the SEFIR domain in IL-17RA has marked sequence homology to BB-loops. Deletion of or point mutations in this region render IL-17RA non-functional, so this motif is referred to as a TIR-like loop (TILL)<sup>43,61</sup>. It is probable that the TILL provides a unique interaction surface for an as-yet-unknown signalling molecule, potentially serving as the TIR box 3 equivalent. Surprisingly, although all IL-17Rs have a SEFIR motif, the TILL domain seems to be unique to IL-17RA, perhaps explaining why IL-17RA functions as a common subunit shared by several receptors in the family (FIG. 1).
Thus, there is clearly much more to learn about the mechanisms by which IL-17A regulates mRNA transcript stability, but this is likely to be an important means by which inflammation is controlled by this cytokine.

**IL-17RA signalling: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein.**

IL-17A is consistently found to be a weak activator of NF-κB, which indicates that additional transcription factors are involved in the response to IL-17A. A microarray screen for IL-17A-induced genes identified the CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ as being involved in this process<sup>53</sup>. The promoters of genes upregulated by IL-17A are enriched for C/EBP-binding elements<sup>42</sup>, and activation of the *Il6* and *lcn2* (lipocalin 2; also known as 24p3) promoters following IL-17A stimulation requires C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ<sup>53</sup>. So, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are targets of IL-17A-induced signalling and also important mediators of IL-17A-induced signalling pathways.

In some respects, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ seem to function redundantly, as reconstitution of cells deficient in both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ with either transcription factor can restore IL-17A-dependent induction of IL-6 and lipocalin 2 expression<sup>53</sup>. Nonetheless, there are essential differences in how C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are regulated by IL-17RA. ACT1 and the SEFIR and TILL domains of IL-17RA are required for the induction of C/EBPδ expression, suggesting a role for NF-κB in this process<sup>43,58</sup>. This observation is consistent with a study showing that NF-κB can bind directly to the *Cebpd* promoter following lipopolysaccharide stimulation<sup>68</sup>.

C/EBPβ expression is regulated by IL-17A in a more complex manner. C/EBPβ exists in three isoforms that are generated by alternative translation<sup>69</sup>. The largest is a full length isoform known as liver-enriched activator protein (LAP*). A shorter form, LAP, is generated from an alternative start codon and is thought to be the most transcriptionally active form of C/EBPβ. LIP (liver-enriched inhibitory protein) is also generated by alternative translation and acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of transcription. The mechanism underlying these alternative translation events is not understood. IL-17A treatment of fibroblast cell lines results in a mild induction of LAP, a large increase in LAP* and no induction of LIP. Induction of LAP* depends on the SEFIR and TILL domains of IL-17RA, suggesting that this process is downstream of ACT1. Generation of LAP* also requires a poorly characterized C-terminal domain in IL-17RA known as a C/EBPβ-activation domain (CBAD)<sup>43</sup>, which is not found in any other IL-17R family member<sup>61</sup>.

As with many signalling effectors, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are important for the activity of C/EBPβ<sup>69,70</sup>. IL-17A triggers dual, sequential phosphorylation of a regulatory site within C/EBPβ. Specifically, ERK phosphorylates threonine 188 within 15 minutes of IL-17A stimulation, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylates threonine 179 after 1 hour, an event that requires prior phosphorylation at threonine 188 (REF. 61). Interestingly, these phosphorylation events are mediated by distinct subdomains of IL-17RA (FIG. 3a). Regulation of ERK and hence

phosphorylation at threonine 188 is mediated by the SEFIR and TILL domains of IL-17RA<sup>43</sup>, whereas regulation of GSK3β is mediated by the CBAD. In other systems, PI3K signalling is upstream of GSK3β, but standard PI3K inhibitors have no effect on IL-17A-induced signalling in this setting. Unexpectedly, the effect of C/EBPβ phosphorylation is to downregulate its transcriptional capacity, so this pathway is one of the few known inhibitory signalling events mediated by IL-17A<sup>61</sup>. Because induction, alternative translation and phosphorylation of C/EBPβ all occur during a time frame in which expression of C/EBPδ is also upregulated by IL-17A through the canonical NF-κB pathway<sup>51</sup>, there is a dynamic and complex interplay between members of the C/EBP family that could allow the detailed transcriptional control of C/EBP-dependent genes. Finally, C/EBPβ can be regulated by subcellular localization and association with numerous transcription factors, which provides future avenues of investigation in the context of IL-17R signalling<sup>69</sup>.

More broadly, these molecular events help to explain the synergism between IL-17A and other cytokines, in particular TNF<sup>71</sup>. The mechanism underlying such synergy occurs partly through enhanced effects on mRNA stability<sup>38,72</sup>, but C/EBP transcription factors also help to mediate cooperative activation of target promoters. For example, TNF and IL-17A have an additive effect on the activation of the *Il6* promoter, and overexpression of either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ can replace the contribution of IL-17A to this cooperative signal<sup>53</sup>.

**Other pathways activated by IL-17RA.**

Additional events have been implicated in IL-17RA signalling, although generally there is less evidence for these other pathways. Pharmacological inhibitors of JAKs have been reported to limit IL-17A-mediated signalling<sup>73,74</sup>, but these results should be interpreted with caution owing to the non-specific effects of such compounds. Weak activation of STATs has also been reported, but secondary effects from IL-17A-induced secretion of cytokines such as IL-6 were not ruled out satisfactorily<sup>38</sup>. Activation of PI3K has also been observed; IL-17A-induced signalling in lung epithelial cells is associated with increased lipid phosphorylation, weak AKT phosphorylation and inhibition by specific PI3K inhibitors<sup>73</sup>. However, there are few biochemical data indicating which PI3K isoforms are involved in this process. In addition, IL-17RA, and hence downstream signalling from this receptor, might be controlled by inducible degradation. An overexpression study showed that IL-17A triggers the ubiquitylation and degradation of IL-17RA, which might involve the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (REF. 75).

**Other receptors of the IL-17R family**

**IL-17RC.** IL-17RC was identified by homology searches of mammalian expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. Complementation studies showed that IL-17RC is required for IL-17A- and IL-17F-mediated signalling, although it cannot induce signalling in the absence of IL-17RA. This study also revealed an unexpected species-dependent interaction between IL-17R subunits. Specifically, mouse and human IL-17A show no species
dependence in signalling^{13}, whereas only mouse IL-17RA can reconstitute IL-17A-dependent signalling in mouse *Il17ra*^−/−^ fibroblasts. Furthermore, co-expression of human but not mouse IL-17RC with human IL-17RA can restore signalling in these cells^{35}. Consistently, fibroblasts from *Il17rc*^−/−^ mice fail to induce the production of IL-6 or granulocyte/macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) in response to either IL-17A or IL-17F^{76}. The reason for this species dependence is not clear, but it could be important in evaluating cytokine-specific therapeutics in pre-clinical models.

The findings discussed above indicate that the IL-17A-binding complex is an obligate multimeric receptor containing both IL-17RA and IL-17RC. However, these subunits have reciprocal expression patterns, which is suggestive of tissue-dependent activities^{21,22}. In contrast to IL-17RA, IL-17RC expression is low in haematopoietic tissues and high in non-immune cells of the prostate, liver, kidney, thyroid and joints^{21,77}. In terms of biological signalling, it is conceivable that the differential expression of IL-17R subunits could provide a mechanism for tissue-specific signalling by IL-17A and/or IL-17F. In humans IL-17RA binds with an extremely low affinity to IL-17F, whereas IL-17RC binds with higher affinity to IL-17F than to IL-17A^{21}, so cells with high IL-17RC expression could be highly responsive to IL-17F, whereas those with low IL-17RC expression and high IL-17RA expression might respond better to IL-17A. The situation is somewhat different in mice, in which IL-17RA binds both IL-17A and IL-17F, whereas IL-17RC binds strongly only to IL-17F. Studies in *Il17a*^−/−^ and *Il17f*^−/−^ mice indicated that IL-17A but not IL-17F mediates signals in mouse T cells, correlating with undetectable levels of IL-17RC in these cells^{22}. This raises the intriguing question of whether IL-17RA signals as a homomultimer in T cells or whether there is another subunit that might pair with IL-17RA in certain cell types such as T cells. This information could also be used for therapeutic purposes; soluble IL-17RA can efficiently block IL-17A-dependent but not IL-17F-dependent responses in human cells, providing an avenue to selectively target individual cytokines^{21} (FIG. 2). Defining the precise nature of IL-17 family cytokine-binding complexes in different tissues and also in mice and humans is therefore important for understanding signalling and devising ways in which to optimally target this system for clinical benefit.

With the exception of IL-17RA, other members of the IL-17R family are highly spliced at sites in the extracellular domain, potentially giving rise to both agonistic and antagonistic (soluble) forms of the receptors. Indeed, more than 90 splice isoforms of IL-17RC were identified in human prostate cancer lines^{78}, but only 4 splice variants of mouse IL-17RC are found in EST databases^{21}. Interestingly, there is ligand preference of IL-17RC splice isoforms, as certain forms bind preferentially to IL-17A or IL-17F. Moreover, some isoforms do not bind either cytokine, suggesting that there might be additional ligands for this receptor subunit^{21}. The mechanism by which splicing is controlled has not been determined, but might be important for directing the ability of a particular cell or tissue to respond to different IL-17 family cytokines.

As expected, the IL-17RC cytoplasmic tail is required for signal transduction^{35} but not for inducible co-immunoprecipitation with IL-17RA (W. Ouyang, personal communication). So far, little is known about exactly how IL-17RC participates in signalling. IL-17RC contains a SEFIR domain but not an obvious TILL domain, and it is not known whether IL-17RC binds directly to ACT1, TRAF6 or other downstream signalling molecules. It is tempting to speculate that IL-17RC might recruit unique molecules to the receptor complex, but it is possible that IL-17RC simply increases the number of ACT1 molecules in the complex to facilitate more efficient signal transduction.

**IL-17RB.** IL-17RB binds both IL-17B and IL-17E. This subunit is expressed by various endocrine tissues as well as the kidneys, liver and T~H~2 cells^{79}. Similarly to IL-17RC, IL-17RB is highly spliced in the extracellular domain^{80}, although no evaluation of the role of each splice variant has been reported. Recent evidence indicates that IL-17RB pairs with IL-17RA to form a functional receptor complex for IL-17E, but the specific contribution of each subunit to downstream signalling is unclear^{27}. This finding raises issues regarding conclusions drawn from studies of *Il17ra*^−/−^ mice, as effects attributed to IL-17A and IL-17F could involve additional contributions from IL-17E. Unlike IL-17RA, IL-17RB has a TRAF6-binding motif in its cytoplasmic tail. As a result, antibody-mediated cross-linking of the receptor activates NF-κB, which can be blocked by a dominant-negative form of TRAF6 but not TRAF2 (REF. 81). IL-17E has been shown to activate NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1) and JUNB, leading to increased IL-4 expression by T~H~2 cells^{82}. Similar to the rest of the IL-17R family, the IL-17RB cytoplasmic tail contains a SEFIR domain and was recently shown to bind ACT1 in a SEFIR-dependent manner. Accordingly, *Act1*^−/−^ mice show defects in responding to IL-17E *in vivo*^{26,83}.

**IL-17RD.** IL-17RD has no known ligand (FIG. 1). It was first identified in zebrafish on the basis of a similar expression pattern to the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and thus is commonly known as SEF (similar expression to the FGFR). IL-17RD seems to be the most evolutionarily ancient member of the IL-17R family, as it has homologues in sea lamprey, frogs and *C. elegans*^{84}. Its role in zebrafish suggests that the original function of the IL-17R family might have been to control development. Interestingly, this represents another parallel to the TLR family, as Toll from *Drosophila melanogaster* functions to control dorsoventral polarity during embryonic development. IL-17RD inhibits FGF-mediated Ras-MAPK and PI3K signalling during both zebrafish and frog development^{85}. IL-17RD blocks FGF in part by physically associating with FGFR1 and FGFR2. The cytoplasmic tail of IL-17RD is required for its ability to inhibit signalling and associate with FGFR, but the extracellular domain is dispensable^{85}. The human homologue of IL-17RD also co-immunoprecipitates with FGFR1 and can inhibit FGF-dependent ERK activation and

Box 2 | Future avenues of investigation in the IL-17R signalling field

There remain many unanswered questions with regard to interleukin-17 receptor (IL-17R) signalling. To start, not all of the ligand–receptor relationships are defined. For example, the receptor for IL-17D is unknown, as is the ligand (or ligands) for IL-17RD (see also FIG. 1). The stoichiometry of the various receptor complexes is not well delineated, and there is no substantial information on how expression of each receptor subunit is controlled; for example, why are IL-17RA and IL-17RC reciprocally expressed if they form a heteromeric complex? Is there tissue specificity in terms of IL-17R composition, and if so, does this translate into differential signalling? Does IL-17RC have another ligand? In the receptor complex for IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17A–IL-17F, the molecular contribution of the IL-17RC cytoplasmic tail is unknown, and a similar question exists for the IL-17RE subunit when paired with IL-17RA. The details of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway are not fully elucidated; for example, a possible role for inhibitor of NF-κB-ζ (Iκβζ) is intriguing but undetermined. It is not known whether ACT1 (also known as CIKS) binds to additional signalling molecules or kinases that might have similar roles to IL-1R-associated kinases in the Toll-like receptor system. The signalling pathways leading to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) activation are incompletely elucidated. How does IL-17 control mRNA transcript stability? The role of IL-17 signalling in B and T cells is also not well understood. What is the contribution of IL-17R signalling pathways in vivo? What is the importance of a virally encoded IL-17A homologue in Herpesvirus saimiri? Future investigations will address these and other important questions.

FGF-dependent proliferation<sup>86–88</sup>. Although the mechanism by which IL-17RD-mediated inhibition occurs is not defined, mouse IL-17RD has been shown to interact with TAK1 to activate the MAP2K4–Jun N-terminal kinase signalling pathway<sup>89</sup>. In addition to associating with FGFR, human IL-17RD has been shown to form homodimers, although it is not clear whether these are functional<sup>86</sup>. IL-17RD can also interact with IL-17RA, although the biological importance of this association remains unclear<sup>36</sup>. IL-17RD-deficient mice are viable and have no obvious developmental abnormalities, but detailed phenotypic analysis has not yet been carried out (J. Tocker, personal communication).

**IL-17RE.** IL-17RE is the least well understood member of the IL-17R family, but recent studies suggest that its ligand is IL-17C (S. Levin, personal communication). IL-17RE is highly spliced, with six isoforms identified in EST databases. Ectopic expression of an EPOR–IL-17RE construct in the myeloid BaF3 cell line indicated that this receptor might promote proliferation, but this occurred in a ligand-independent manner, which raises concerns about the validity of the assay system<sup>90</sup>.

### Perspectives and implications

The past decade has seen great success in exploiting cytokines for therapeutic intervention. For example, antibodies and soluble receptors that neutralize TNF have revolutionized the treatment of autoimmune diseases<sup>91</sup>. Therapies that target IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23, which affect the development and function of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells (as well as other T<sub>H</sub>17-like cells that produce IL-17A and related ligands), have also had success in the clinical setting or in experimental trials. The roles of IL-17 family cytokines in autoimmunity make this system an obvious target for clinical intervention<sup>92</sup>. Strategies include administering neutralizing antibodies specific for IL-17A, IL-17F or IL-17A–IL-17F, or for IL-17RA or IL-17RC. Soluble receptors or PLAD peptides could also be used to block ligand–receptor interactions<sup>21,50</sup> (FIG. 2). Understanding which receptor subunit (or subunits) to target while avoiding deleterious effects on the host immune system will be integral for developing effective treatments. In this regard, the different affinity of each IL-17R subunit for its ligand could be exploited to allow more selective inhibition; for example, in human cells soluble IL-17RA reagents selectively block IL-17A and probably the IL-17A–IL-17F heterodimer, whereas soluble IL-17RC blocks IL-17A, IL-17F and the IL-17A–IL-17F heterodimer<sup>21</sup>. In exciting new developments, IL-17A-specific antibodies have shown promise in early trials for the treatment of psoriasis (D. Patel, personal communication). Although current strategies target ligands or extracellular features of cytokine receptors, defining the downstream signal transduction mechanisms might also allow the development of small molecule inhibitors that block specific intracellular pathways.

In summary, IL-17A came to prominence as the signature cytokine of the new T<sub>H</sub>17 cell subset, and its unusual structure, receptor and proximal signalling pathways have presented new paradigms in cytokine biology. However, there are still many open questions pertaining to ligand–receptor relationships, molecular signalling events and functions of the IL-17 family *in vivo* (BOX 2). The next few years will certainly see important new insights about this fascinating family of cytokines.
