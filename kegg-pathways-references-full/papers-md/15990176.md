G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) encoded by herpesviruses and poxviruses are homologous to mammalian chemokine receptors. GPCRs encoded by herpesvirus-6, herpesvirus-7, herpesvirus-8 and cytomegalovirus are among the best studied. Virally encoded GPCRs engage many different signal-transduction cascades, and have important roles in the life-cycles of the viruses and pathogenesis of human disease. Although signaling by these GPCRs might be modified by ligand binding, they often exhibit constitutive (basal) signaling activities that appear to provide selective advantages to the virus.

'Pirating' of G-protein-coupled receptors by viruses According to evolutionary theory, viruses have 'pirated' cellular genes that are involved in cell-cycle control, immune modulation, apoptosis, signal transduction of growth factors, differentiation and cell trafficking to support their life-cycles. One class of genes that have been pirated by herpesviruses and poxviruses, which regulate several of these processes, includes members of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, herpesviruses and poxviruses have genes that encode GPCRs that are homologous to mammalian chemokine receptors [1]. However, unlike typical mammalian chemokine receptors, viral receptors also signal independently of ligand. Constitutive signaling by GPCRs contributes to virus survival and host invasion.

In this review, we discuss GPCRs that are encoded by human β-herpesvirus and γ-herpesvirus. A classification of chemokine-like GPCRs that are encoded by viruses has been proposed, based on sequence homology, genome location and function [2]. The functional properties of these viral receptors are different from their host homologs. We provide an overview of their signaling via multiple signal-transduction pathways and give examples of the biological consequences of their cellular expression. Last, we provide a hypothesis for how signaling for viral survival leads to the pathogenesis of human disease and, consequently, why GPCRs constitute new targets for therapeutic intervention.

Herpesviruses A common characteristic of herpesviruses is the ability to establish a latent state in a few cells after primary infection. During this state no virus is produced but there is weak expression of viral ‘latent’ genes. After stimulation, the virus reactivates and enters a lytic phase in which infectious virions are produced. Throughout these phases of viral infection (latency and reactivation), herpesviruses continue to influence host-cell biology by expressing chemokine receptors. Herpesviruses are grouped into α-, β- and γ-subfamilies according to their biological properties and genomic organization. To date, only α-herpesviruses do not appear to encode GPCRs. The best studied are β-herpesviruses, namely human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and HHV-7, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and members of the γ-herpesviruses, such as HHV-8 (also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus); recently, the γ-herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was also found to encode a GPCR.

HCMV HCMV is the leading cause of birth defects in infected neonates, and life-threatening systemic infections are observed in immunocompromised subjects, such as HIV-infected and bone-marrow-transplant patients [3]. HCMV infection is also a risk factor for vascular diseases, such as arterial restenosis after angioplasty and atherosclerosis. HCMV encodes four GPCRs, US27, US28, UL33 and UL78, which are candidates for involvement in HCMV-induced pathogenesis [4,5]. The roles of US27 and UL78 are not discussed here because limited data are available on these GPCRs.

US28 shows high homology to mammalian chemokine CCR1 and CCR2 receptors and was described initially as a cofactor for HIV-1 entry [6]. US28 is active constitutively and can be activated further by several CC chemokines and the CX3C chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) [7–9]. Continuous internalization of US28 sequesters chemokines that might facilitate immune evasion at sites of infection and contribute to the latent presence of the virus [7,10]. Several biological effects of US28 have been demonstrated. US28 induces migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, which might contribute to viral dissemination and the development of vascular disease [11]. Some signaling pathways that are activated in US28-expressing smooth muscle cells have been studied. Depending on the cellular-expression system, US28 elicits both constitutive and ligand-dependent signaling through multiple G proteins, which enables this viral

GPCR to affect a broad range of signaling cascades (Figure 1). However, it appears that US28-induced migration of smooth muscle cells does not involve G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins, G<sub>i</sub>α or G<sub>q/11</sub>α, but G<sub>12/13</sub>α, which activates RhoA, is required [12]. Moreover, US28 signals through the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to facilitate migration [13]. Taken together, these data constitute a molecular basis that might explain the acceleration of vascular disease by HCMV, including the development of atherosclerosis. Moreover, because US28 might be expressed during latency in hematopoietic progenitor cells and monocytes, Streblow and co-workers have suggested that HMCV might direct these cells to inflamed tissues rather than to lymph nodes to escape the host immune system [13].

The second HCMV-GPCR to be characterized was UL33. To date, UL33 homologs are orphan GPCRs for which no ligand has been identified. UL33 homologs, however, exhibit basal (constitutive) signaling that results in activation of downstream intracellular effectors to a similar degree as ligand-dependent activation of GPCRs. Although UL33 and R33 (the rat homolog) couple to G<sub>q/11</sub> proteins to activate phospholipase C and lead to the production of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>], they have different signaling properties (Figure 2) [9]. Activation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated signaling by UL33 at early and late times post-infection is likely to be biologically important because most of the promoters of CMV immediate early genes contain consensus CREs. This activation of CREs might initiate a primary genetic switch that is essential for either viral infection or reactivation. In atherosclerosis, it is tempting to speculate that US28 and UL33 cooperate to transform smooth muscle cells by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK-dependent proliferative signaling pathways. Thus, crosstalk in signaling by UL33 and US28 during the course of HCMV infection might confer advantages to the virus. Cellular proliferation and transformation caused by constitutive signaling of these viral GPCRs enables the virus to increase the size of its reservoir pool and increases the number of cells that might potentially be infected. Moreover, acquisition of a transformed phenotype also induces infected cells to secrete soluble factors that, in turn, promote angiogenesis and inflammation, and inhibit the immune response.

Figure 1. Signaling pathways triggered by constitutively active US28-CMV-GPCR. US28 binds several CC chemokines, including RANTES [regulated upon activation, normal T cells, expressed and secreted (CCL5)], monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP-1 (CCL2)], MCP-3 (CCL7), monocyte inhibitory protein 1α [MIP-1α (CCL3)] and MIP-1β (CCL4). US28 also binds the CX3C chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1). US28 elicits both constitutive and ligand-dependent signaling activities through multiple G proteins (G<sub>i</sub>, G<sub>16</sub>, G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>12/13</sub>α), which are cell-type specific. Most signaling cascades have been identified in human embryonic kidney cells and smooth muscle cells. Binding of CCL5 to US28 activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, 2 (ERK1, 2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through the G proteins G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>16</sub> and activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor, which induce the expression of several genes that encode inflammatory mediators. US28 signals constitutively through the pertussis-toxin-insensitive G<sub>q/11</sub>-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) pathway and activates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). US28 also signals through the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and couples to G<sub>12/13</sub>α to activate RhoA, which mediates the migration of smooth muscle cells. Dashed arrows with a question mark represent either uncharacterized or potential signal-transduction pathways that might be used by US28 to activate downstream effectors such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p38 MAPK, ERK1, 2 and transcription factors. These downstream effectors activate the expression of specific genes that are involved in cell migration, survival and proliferation. The biological consequences of the expression of US28 provide HCMV with different means to maintain its genome and to infect new target cells.

HHV-8
HHV-8, a γ2-herpesvirus, is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's
sarcoma that causes a rare malignant lymphoma (primary
effusion lymphoma) and multicentric Castleman's disease
(a hematological disorder that is characterized by angio-
follicular hyperplasia) in some patients [18–20]. HHV-8 is
similar to EBV and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), two viruses
that transform mammalian lymphoid cells in culture and
cause malignant lymphomas. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most
frequent tumor in HIV-infected patients and is a signi-
ficant cause of death in AIDS sufferers. Kaposi's sarcoma
lesions are composed of proliferating tumor cells, called
spindle cells because of their shape, infiltrating inflam-
matory cells and extravasated erythrocytes associated
with neovascular spaces.
HHV-8-GPCR (also known as KSHV-GPCR and
ORF74) has homology to human receptors including
CXC chemokine receptor type 1 (CXCR1), CXCR2 and
CXCR3 [20–22]. HHV-8-GPCR is a constitutively active
receptor [21] that, like US28 of HCMV, binds several CXC
and CC chemokines [23]. Therefore, HHV-8-GPCR inter-
acts with a much broader array of chemokines than
mammalian receptors and its signaling activity is modi-
fied by them. HHV-8-GPCR binds HHV-8-encoded vMIP-II,
which provides a feedback mechanism to modulate the
activity of KSHV-GPCR.
Cellular expression of mutant forms of KSHV-GPCR
have helped to identify regions that are required for
constitutive activity, such as the transmembrane helical
bundle (a NPxxY motif in transmembrane helix 7) and
other residues (e.g. at the intracellular ends of trans-
membrane helix 2 and transmembrane helix 3) [24–28].
Viral GPCRs are desensitized by mechanisms described
for endogenous chemokine receptors and GPCR-specific
kinases and protein kinase C (PKC) mediate desensitiza-
tion of HHV-8-GPCR [29].
The biological effects of expression of HHV-8-GPCR are
interesting. Initially, HHV-8-GPCR was shown to have
tumorigenic potential in fibroblasts and to cause tumors in
nude mice [30,31]. In human umbilical vein endothelial
cells, expression of HHV-8-GPCR leads to immortalization
[30,31]. Moreover, expression of HHV-8-GPCR protects
cells, notably endothelial cells, from apoptosis induced by
serum deprivation [32,33].
Gene expression stimulated by HHV-8-GPCR signaling
is different in B cells and endothelial cells, which are both
considered to be likely targets of HHV-8 infection, and
HHV-8-GPCR couples to different signaling pathways in
these cell types. Although HHV-8-GPCR signals through
the phosphoinositide–Ins(1,4,5)P₃–Ca²⁺–diacylglycerol–
PKC cascade via the pertussis-toxin-insensitive Gq family
of G proteins (Figure 3) in both cell types, its constitutive
activity differs in these two cell types [21,22]. In endo-
thelial cells only, HHV-8-GPCR signals via a pertussis-
toxin-sensitive pathway that leads to lowering of cAMP
levels [32]. HHV-8-GPCR can couple to other G proteins,
such as G₁₂/₁₃α, and part of the signal is generated by Gβγ
in most cells [34]. Indeed, coupling of HHV-8-GPCR to the

Figure 2. Signaling pathways triggered by constitutively active GPCRs of CMV
(UL33 and R33). Human UL33 CMV (a) and rat R33 CMV (b) are orphan receptors
that have different ligand-independent signaling properties. For UL33 and R33,
activation of phospholipase C (PLC) is also mediated by Gi/o proteins (the α-subunit
of Gq/11 and Gβγ subunits from Gi/o) [9]. Through Gi/o, R33 constitutively inhibits
adenylyl cyclase (AC), which leads to the inhibition of CREB-mediated gene
transcription and enhances NF-κB activity. UL33 couples to more G proteins
(compared with R33), including Gs, that leads to activation of RhoA and, in turn, p38
MAPK [9].

These are some of the strategies mediated by these virally
encoded GPCRs for the benefit of the virus.

HHV-6 and HHV-7
HHV-6 and HHV-7 cause primary infections in early
childhood [14]. Primary infection with HHV-6 (variants A
and B) is the cause of exanthem subitum, a cutaneous rash
that affects the entire body of infants and is responsible for
a mononucleosis-like illness in adults. Primary infection
with HHV-7 is not linked definitively to a disease. Reactivation of HHV-6 and HHV-7 either later in life or
in immunosuppressed individuals might be related to
disease.
HHV-6 and HHV-7 each encode two chemokine-like
GPCRs, U12 and U51 [15]. U12 from HHV-6 has high
homology with CCR3 and binds CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5
[15]. U12 from HHV-7 [16] is homologous to human CCR7
and has exquisite chemokine selectivity because it binds
CCL19 exclusively [16]. Although U12 from both HHV-6
and HHV-7 are functional receptors that signal through a
pertussis-toxin-insensitive G-protein-transduction path-
way that results in transient influx of Ca²⁺, their roles in
the viral life-cycle and disease pathogenesis are unknown
currently [15,16].
U51 from HHV-6 and HHV-7 is expressed at both
immediate early and early times post-infection and binds
several CC chemokines such as CCL5, CCL11, CCL2,
CCL7, CCL13 and the viral monocyte inflammatory
protein-II (vMIP-II) of HHV-8 [15,17]. U51 from HHV-6
downregulates transcription of the gene that encodes
CCL5, and might have an immunomodulatory role during
virus infection [17]. Further studies are needed to define

Figure 3. Signaling pathways that are triggered by, and the biological effects of, constitutively active HHV-8-GPCR. HHV-8-GPCR is a constitutively active receptor that binds several CXC chemokines and CC chemokines. Growth-related oncogene α [GROα (CXCL1)] and interleukin 8 [IL-8 (CXCL8)] are agonists of HHV-8-GPCR, whereas interferon γ-inducible protein 10 [IP-10 (CXCL10)], stromal-cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1 (CXCL12)] and the HHV-8-encoded CC chemokine v-MIP-II are inverse agonists. Epithelial-cell-derived neutrophil-activating 78 [ENA78 (CXCL5)] and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 [NAP-2 (CXCL7)] are neutral antagonists of HHV-8-GPCR [24]. HHV-8-GPCR signals through multiple signaling pathways that involve G<sub>q</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub> and G<sub>12/13</sub>. Depending on the cell system, HHV-8-GPCR signals through phosphoinositide-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate–Ca<sup>2+</sup>–diacylglycerol–protein kinase C (PKC) to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, which activates proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk-2) and the small GTPase Rac1. These transduction cascades lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) {e.g. p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1,2 (ERK1,2) and c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) [stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)]} that, in turn, activate transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), NFAT and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Activation of NF-κB and NFAT induces the secretion of several growth factors [e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)], pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic cytokines (e.g. CCL5, interleukin-6 and CXCL8), contributing to angiogenesis and mitogenesis. HHV-8-GPCR expression induces cell survival, changes in adhesion and migration, promotes transformation and tumorigenesis by affecting the cells in which it is expressed and might influence surrounding cells (uninfected cells or latently infected cells) via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. These different biological effects that HHV-8 might target by expressing one of its viral proteins represent interesting features of viral strategies that HHV-8 uses for its own benefit: viral maintenance. Abbreviations: AC, adenylyl cyclase; PLC, phospholipase C.

phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt (protein kinase B)  
pathway depends on Gβγ released from pertussis-toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins [32,33,35]. It seems, therefore, that the PI3K–Akt pathway has a central role in HHV-8-GPCR-induced transformation in endothelial cells [32,33]. In addition, this pathway protects endothelial cells from apoptosis and would promote survival of cells infected with HHV-8.  
HHV-8-GPCR activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway has other biological consequences. For example, Akt is activated by PKC and p44/p42 MAPK, which, in turn, lead to the activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and the subsequent expression and release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [35,36]. Concomitantly, HHV-8-GPCR might activate Akt indirectly by upregulating the expression of the VEGF receptor KDR2, which is associated with the release of VEGF. In turn, this  

autocrine signaling through KDR2 activates Akt. In addition, the release of VEGF from endothelial cells that express HHV-8-GPCR induces Akt activity in neighboring endothelial cells *in vivo* [37]. Stimulation of angiogenesis via this paracrine mechanism seems to be an important feature in HHV-8-mediated oncogenesis [27,36–40].  
HHV-8-GPCR also contributes to cell survival, transformation and angiogenesis by activating MAPKs and transcription factors that are regulated by these kinases. HHV-8-GPCR activates the p44/p42 MAPK pathway, which leads to cellular proliferation. HHV-8-GPCR triggers several cascades that lead to activation of p44/p42 MAPK, including PI3K, Ras and PKC-dependent pathways (Figure 3) [35].  
Two other MAPKs are activated by HHV-8-GPCR, namely c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) [also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)] and p38 MAPK. It
is noteworthy that JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK mediate pathways that are often involved in the activation of inflammatory cytokines that lead to angiogenesis and mitogenesis [37]. In addition to MAPKs, HHV-8-GPCR activates proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk-2)-related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), which indicates a role for this viral receptor in cell adhesion and migration [41]. Last, HHV-8-GPCR activates the small GTPase Rac1, which might be involved in malignant progression, invasiveness and metastasis [42].

Ultimately, the signaling pathways that are triggered by HHV-8-GPCR target specific transcription factors, for example, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), CREB, c-JUN, HIF1α and activator protein 1 (AP1) (Figure 3). NFAT and NF-κB induce the secretion of several growth factors and pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic cytokines [e.g. CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, interleukin 1β, (IL-1β), IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α and basic fibroblast growth factor], and increase the expression of adhesion molecules [27,39,40,42,43]. These factors are important mediators in Kaposi’s sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas. Therefore, HHV-8-GPCR might upregulate the expression of potent lymphocyte chemoattractants and mitogens that promote cell recruitment and proliferation in HHV-8-related diseases.

These findings *in vitro* are supported by studies in transgenic animals. Expression of HHV-8-GPCR in mice induces the formation of angioproliferative lesions [31,44,45]. The pathology of HHV-8-GPCR transgenic mice is similar to the lesions caused by Kaposi’s sarcoma in humans, with angiogenesis and spindle-cell proliferation. Two transgenic mouse models have been established [31,45]. These show that HHV-8-GPCR might not transform directly but that it activates the expression of cellular factors such as VEGF, which recruit and stimulate the proliferation of endothelial cells and spindle cells, and, thereby, induce the formation of Kaposi’s sarcoma-like lesions [45]. However, studies of transgenic mice that express mutant HHV-8-GPCRs show that induction of Kaposi’s sarcoma-like tumorigenesis requires high levels of constitutive signaling activity [44]. Results in mice infected with ORF74-deficient mouse herpesvirus-68, demonstrate that ORF74 is required for both chemokine-stimulated virus replication and efficient reactivation from latency [46]. It is possible that a small subset of cells that express lytic genes, including HHV-8-GPCR, might cooperate with cells that express HHV-8 latent genes and contribute to the pathogenesis of Kaposi’s sarcoma through a paracrine mechanism [47–50]. Moreover, HHV-8-GPCR might also contribute to the pathogenesis by influencing uninfected cells and latently infected cells via paracrine mechanisms (Figure 3).

The ability of HHV-8-GPCR to exploit multiple intracellular signaling pathways and so induce cell proliferation, survival, migration, transformation, differentiation and angiogenesis mediates its important role in the viral life cycle and leads to disease pathogenesis [46,47].

EBV

EBV is a γ1-herpesvirus and primary infection with EBV is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis. In a subset of individuals, EBV infection is associated with endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and AIDS- and transplant-associated B-cell lymphomas [51]. Although EBV induces endogenous chemokine GPCRs such as CCR6, CCR7 and CCR10 in host cells, until recently it was the only γ1-herpesvirus in which a GPCR had not been identified. However, a comparative sequence analysis of the open reading frame of BILF1, which is present in the annotated sequence of EBV that was established 20 years ago, has demonstrated that EBV does encode a functional, constitutively active GPCR [52,53]. This receptor does not have sequence similarities with chemokine receptors but signals through Giα (as do chemokine receptors). BILF1 couples to Giα but not Gq/11α, modulates CRE-mediated signaling, activates NF-κB and inhibits the phosphorylation of RNA-dependent protein kinase through a mechanism that does not involve Gi/oα coupling. RNA-dependent protein kinase is important in intracellular antiviral defense and has not been described previously as a target for virally encoded GPCRs [52,53]. Although latency-associated EBV genes are thought to contribute mainly to oncogenesis, it is possible that a few cells might be spontaneously permissive for lytic replication. Because BILF1 is transcribed, like HHV-8-GPCR, during the lytic-replication cycle, it is tempting to speculate that BILF1 might contribute to the control of the level of reactivation and be involved in EBV tumorigenesis by acting on either uninfected or latently infected cells through paracrine mechanisms.

Concluding remarks

Herpesviruses appear to have pirated GPCRs to enhance the robustness of their life cycles. Once incorporated in the viral genomes, mutation of these GPCRs enabled them to signal constitutively. This ability enables the virus to alter host-cell homeostasis in the absence of ligand. This one-factor system (receptor without a ligand) is a more efficient way for the virus to alter the biology of the host than a two-factor system (receptor and ligand). Creating the capacity to trigger specific signaling pathways that lead to cell proliferation, survival and migration with only a single molecular determinant markedly increases the likelihood of virus survival. For example, by increasing host-cell proliferation, the virus enhances the size of its reservoir pool and, by altering the immune response, it enhances its ability to evade immune damage. Therefore, it is likely that viruses have acquired chemokine receptors, rather than other GPCRs that might enhance either survival or proliferation, because chemokine receptor signaling pathways are involved in immune regulation in host cells. Last, the capacity to induce disease in humans is likely to be a consequence of the evolutionary changes in GPCR signaling (and in the functions of other viral genes) that have occurred to enhance virus survival. In fact, a better symbiotic relationship exists when the changes induced that increase viral survival do not adversely affect the host. Nevertheless, because signaling by viral GPCRs is involved in the pathogenesis of human disease, these receptors are potentially important targets for drug therapy.
