Abstract | Despite nearly two decades passing since the discovery of gene fusions involving TFE3 or TFEB in sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the molecular mechanisms underlying the renal-specific tumorigenesis of these genes remain largely unclear. The recently published findings of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network reported that five of the 416 surveyed clear cell RCC tumours (1.2%) harboured SFPQ–TFE3 fusions, providing further evidence for the importance of gene fusions. A total of five TFE3 gene fusions (PRCC–TFE3, ASPSCR1–TFE3, SFPQ–TFE3, NONO–TFE3, and CLTC–TFE3) and one TFEB gene fusion (MALAT1–TFEB) have been identified in RCC tumours and characterized at the mRNA transcript level. A multitude of molecular pathways well-described in carcinogenesis are regulated in part by TFE3 or TFEB proteins, including activation of TGFβ and ETS transcription factors, E-cadherin expression, CD40L-dependent lymphocyte activation, mTORC1 signalling, insulin-dependent metabolism regulation, folliculin signalling, and retinoblastoma-dependent cell cycle arrest. Determining which pathways are most important to RCC oncogenesis will be critical in discovering the most promising therapeutic targets for this disease.

### Introduction

Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the fusion of two different genes are the most common type of mutation found in human cancer.¹ The role of these mutations in sarcomas and haematological malignancies has been established for several decades, but more recently, advances in genetic analysis have led to their discovery in common carcinomas.² The next-generation sequencing of breast and prostate carcinomas has highlighted the common occurrence of fusion events in carcinogenesis, revealing numerous gene fusions per patient tumour.²⁻⁴ However, the effect and importance of these gene fusions has yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we describe the molecular and genetic features of gene fusions found in a subset of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) involving TFE3 or TFEB, which are members of the microphthalmia transcription factor (MiT) gene family.

RCC includes multiple heterogeneous cancer types that originate from the renal tubular epithelium.⁵ Each subtype is defined by a distinct histology, the most common types being clear cell (65–70%), papillary (15–20%), and chromophobe (5–10%).⁶ Genetic mutations underlying RCC tumorigenesis are becoming increasingly understood, aided by the discovery of at least 12 genes (VHL, MET, FH, FLCN, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, MiTF, and BAP1) that confer hereditary susceptibility to RCC when mutated in the germ-line.⁷⁻⁸ Additional insight has been gained from recent full-exome sequencing efforts in sporadic clear cell RCC

Key points

- Recent large-scale next-generation genetic analyses underscore the frequent occurrence and importance of gene fusion events—including those involving the MiT transcription factor family—in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
- Six MiT family gene fusions (five involving *TFE3* and one involving *TFEB*) have been identified in patients with RCC, most of which demonstrate heterogeneity in mRNA transcript structure across different tumours
- Common to all *TFE3* and *TFEB* fusion isoforms is retention of the wild-type protein C-terminus, which includes DNA-binding, dimerization, and nuclear localization domains, but not the transcriptional activation domain
- The most widely accepted model of *TFE*-fusion oncogenesis is the introduction of a constitutively active promoter leading to dysregulated *TFE* transcriptional activity
- Many proteins (including TGFβ, ETS-1, E-cadherin, folliculin, mTORC1) and cellular processes (autophagy, insulin-dependent metabolism, retinoblastoma-dependent cell cycle arrest) are regulated by wild type *TFE* proteins; dysregulation could drive tumorigenesis
- Given the lack of a standard-of-care for the systemic treatment of *TFE*-fusion RCC, pinpointing the most promising molecular targets for novel therapeutics should be a primary focus of ongoing research

Xp11 rearrangement in an RCC tumour was a t(X;1) (p11.2;q21.2) translocation in a paediatric patient, reported in 1986.¹⁹ In the early 1990s, this translocation was found to be a recurrent mutation in adults.²⁰,²¹ At this time, three immortalized cell lines (UOK120, UOK124, and UOK146) derived from RCC tumours with papillary-like histology and the t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2) mutation were established in our laboratory, and their study led to the cloning and description of the first gene fusion in RCC, *PRCC–TFE3*, in 1995.²²–²⁵ This fusion was noted to link the gene encoding a previously described transcription factor, *TFE3* on chromosome Xp11.2, with a novel gene on chromosome 1q21.2, designated *PRCC* (papillary renal cell carcinoma [translocation-associated]) at the time, based on its presumed importance in papillary RCC oncogenesis. *PRCC–TFE3* was the first gene fusion identified in a carcinoma other than thyroid cancer.

Subsequently, two other RCC cell lines were created within our laboratory (UOK145 and UOK109) that harboured the novel Xp11.2 rearrangements t(X;1) (p11.2;1p34) and inv(X)(p11.2;q12), respectively, from which we cloned and described two additional gene fusions, *SFPQ–TFE3* (previously referred to as *PSF–TFE3*) and *NONO–TFE3* (previously referred to as *p54nrb–TFE3*), respectively.²⁶ These findings indicated that *TFE3*, rather than *PRCC*, was the critical gene fusion partner. Intriguingly, both *SFPQ* and *NONO* were found to encode functionally conserved mRNA-splicing proteins, implicating this process or, more simply, nuclear localization in *TFE3*-fusion oncogenesis. Characterization of the *NONO–TFE3* fusion, which results from inversion of the *TFE3* and *NONO* loci on chromosome Xp, revealed that chromosomal rearrangements other than translocations could generate *TFE3* gene fusions.

In the early 21ˢᵗ century, Argani et al.²⁷,²⁸ identified two more *TFE3* fusions in RCC: *ASPSCR1–TFE3* (previously referred to as *ASPL–TFE3*) and *CLTC–TFE3*. Both *ASPSCR1* and *CLTC* were found to localize to chromosome 17q. The former was cloned as a novel gene of unknown function, and remains as such to date, whereas the latter had been previously cloned as the heavy chain component of the vesicular transport protein clathrin.²⁷,²⁸

Four of the five *TFE3* gene fusions (*PRCC–TFE3*, *ASPSCR1–TFE3*, *SFPQ–TFE3*, and *NONO–TFE3*) have been confirmed as recurrent mutations in multiple patients with RCC. For each of these four fusions, rearrangement occurs within an intron of either gene partner, but the specific intron involved can vary between patients, resulting in different mRNA isoforms that are designated as different ‘types’. The *CLTC–TFE3* fusion, on the other hand, has only been identified in a single patient.²⁸ Interestingly, *TFE3* gene fusions are not unique to patients with RCC. The *ASPSCR1–TFE3* fusion was originally identified in 100% of alveolar soft part sarcomas (ASPS), a rare lung cancer variant with no known association with RCC, and the *SFPQ–TFE3* fusion is also found in a subset of benign tumours

Nearly two decades ago, the molecular biology underlying *TFE3* and *TFEB* gene fusions in RCC remains largely uncharacterized, and effective targeted therapies are yet to be identified. Thus, there remains no clinical standard agent available for the pharmacological treatment of these patients.

Critical to the development of effective therapies for patients with RCC harbouring *TFE3* or *TFEB* gene fusions is identification of the key clinical pathways driving these particular cancers. In this Review, we summarize the contemporary understanding of the molecular biology underlying these gene-fusion-associated (translocation) RCCs. Throughout this Review we refer to these cancers by our preferred term ‘*TFE*-fusion RCC’, although they have also been described in the literature using the equally relevant term ‘*MiT* family translocation RCCs’. We include an up-to-date overview of the candidate mechanisms and signalling pathways thought to contribute to the oncogenesis of these tumours, as well as a detailed description of gene fusion structures based on an updated understanding of *TFE3* and *TFEB* genetic organization.

vast majority of genetically confirmed TFEB-fusion RCC studies have reported clinical outcomes, only two cases of metastasis and one cancer-specific death have been observed.³⁷

### TFE-fusion structure and mRNA isoforms

The nucleic acid site of fusion between TFE3 or TFEB and their partner genes varies and can produce fusion transcripts with different numbers of exons from the original genes. Accordingly, many different mRNA transcript isoforms (or types) have been characterized for most known TFE fusions (Figure 2). Unfortunately, confusion exists regarding the structure of chimeric TFE3 transcripts, owing to inconsistencies in exon nomenclature following the identification of two additional upstream coding exons and a novel transcriptional start site, as detailed in contemporary genetic databases. Here, we provide a summary of the TFE-fusion transcript isoforms characterized to date, based on comparison of sequence data from the literature and contemporary genetic databases, including the human UCSC Genome Browser,³⁸ the Ensembl database,³⁹ and the UniProt Protein Database (Table 2, Figure 1).⁴⁰

#### Wild-type TFE3

The TFE3 gene (NM_006521.4) comprises 14,749 bp on chromosome Xp11.22 and encodes a 3,431 bp mRNA transcript consisting of a 238 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR) followed by 10 coding exons and a 1,427 bp 3' UTR. The coding region includes a start codon in exon 1 and stop codon in exon 10. Wild-type TFE3 mRNA is translated into a 61.5 kDa protein, 575 amino acids (AAs) in length. TFE3 protein shares highly conserved peptide domains with other MiT family members, including a 12 AA transcription activation domain spanning exons 4 and 5, a 54 AA basic helix–loop–helix domain (bHLH) within exons 7–9, and a 22 AA leucine-zipper domain (LZ) within exons 9–10 (Figure 1, Figure 2a). The bHLH and LZ domains both mediate dimerization and DNA binding,⁴¹,⁴² and the former additionally contains a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS).

#### TFE3 gene fusions

The exact breakpoint site in TFE3 fusions is presumed to occur with different introns of both the TFE3 gene and its fusion partners. Pre-mRNA splicing of TFE3 fusions generates a chimeric mRNA transcript fused at exon–exon

REVIEWs

Wild-type TFEB
The TFEB gene (NM_007162.2) comprises 51,083 bp on chromosome 6p21.1 and encodes a 2,364 bp mRNA transcript consisting of two noncoding and eight coding exons. The gene has a 302 bp 5' UTR followed by a start codon in exon 3, and a stop codon in exon 10 followed by a 621 bp 3' UTR (Figure 3). A variant transcript isoform contains only one alternative noncoding exon (NM_001167827.1).

Wild-type TFEB mRNA produces a 476 AA protein similar to TFE3 with a 10 AA transcription activation domain, a 54 AA bHLH domain containing a putative NLS and a 22 AA LZ DNA-binding domain (Figures 2 and 3).

TFEB gene fusions
MALAT1–TFEB fusion breakpoints generally occur before the start codon in TFEB exon 3, resulting in retention of the complete TFEB coding sequence (Figure 3). Until recently, all MALAT1–TFEB fusions were believed to occur within a 289 bp breakpoint cluster region upstream of TFEB exon 3, and within a 1,205 bp breakpoint cluster region of MALAT1. However, a recent study of three patients with TFEB-fusion RCC has suggested a wider range of the traditional breakpoint cluster regions in both TFEB and MALAT1. This study also suggested that a breakpoint can occur in TFEB exon 4, after the start codon, although the resulting protein was of similar size to the wild-type (Figure 3).

Developmental roles of the MiT family
TFE3 and TFEB are members of the MiT transcription factor family, which also includes TFEC and the prototype member, MiTF. MiT transcription factors form homodimers or heterodimers that bind target promoters at a consensus E-box sequence motif (CA[C/T] GTG). Family members have overlapping transcriptional target specificity owing to the highly conserved bHLH and LZ domains. MiT functions are diverse and tissue-specific, often related to cell growth and differentiation. With the exception of TFEC, all MiT members are expressed ubiquitously but activity is tightly regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Regulation occurs in part through tissue-specific splicing, which can be mediated by promoter multiplicity. In heterodimers, TFEC can repress transcriptional activation by its family members, adding another potential level of complexity to MiT regulation.

The best characterized function of the MiT family is its master regulatory role in melanocyte differentiation, which is particularly well-described for MiTF. Over a dozen rodent models with germline mutations in the bHLH-LZ region of the MiTF gene have been described with various pigmentation defects including albinism, ocular defects (microphthalmia), and deafness. In humans, heterozygous MiTF mutations are responsible for Waardenburg Syndrome IIA, which is characterized by melanocyte deficiency and a similar phenotype to the animal models. Melanocytic differentiation seems to be mediated by MiT-mediated transcriptional activation of

The traditional breakpoint cluster region (BCR) is shown in light grey, with recently published extensions to the BCR in dark grey. To date, all but one fusion occurred before the initial ATG translational start of TFEB with a single downstream fusion breakpoint reported in exon 4. Thus, all MALAT1–TFEB gene fusions contain an upstream MALAT1 region (red) and the majority of the TFEB gene (blue-grey) with differing amounts of the ‘variable region’. Thin regions of the gene represent noncoding sequence, whereas thick regions represent the translated reading frame. Diagonal white strips indicate the region is no longer to scale. Abbreviations: AD, strong transcription activation domain; BCR, breakpoint cluster region; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix domain; LZ, leucine zipper domain.
the key melanocytic enzymes, tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2.⁶⁵,⁶⁶ The ability of MiT members to bind and enhance activity of the LEF-1 protein, a mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, might also contribute to melanocytic differentiation.⁶⁷

Another well-described role of the MiT family is the regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation, including macrophages, osteoclasts, lymphocytes, and mast cells.⁵⁹,⁶⁸–⁷² Osteoclast differentiation requires phosphorylation of either TFE3 or MiTF by p38 MAP kinase in response to osteoclastogenic cytokines, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand.⁷³,⁷⁴ Several osteoclast-related genes targeted by MiT transcription factors might also be involved, including *CLCN7*, *CTSK*, *OSCAR*, *OSTM1*, and *TRAP*.⁶⁸,⁷⁵–⁷⁷ Importantly, MiTF or TFE3 alone is sufficient to activate osteoclastogenesis, underscoring the phenomenon of functional redundancy within the MiT family, with one member able to rescue loss of another.⁴²,⁶⁸,⁷⁸,⁷⁹ Certain MiT gene mutations might act as dominant negatives if they inhibit protein function but are able to maintain heterodimerization. Hence, MiTF mutations in the basic domain lead to osteoporosis in mice despite the presence of wild-type TFE3, perhaps owing to TFE3 sequestration in transcriptionally inactive heterodimers with the mutant MiTF protein.⁸⁰

### Mechanism of TFE-fusion oncogenesis

Oncogenic activity of *TFE3* gene fusions has been demonstrated in various preclinical cancer models. Ectopic expression of the *PRCC–TFE3* fusion confers tumorigenicity to fibroblast cells in nude mice and enables benign proximal renal tubule cells to overcome *in vitro* growth arrest.⁸¹ Similarly, expression of the *NONO–TFE3* fusion is required for soft-agar colonization by the UOK109 *TFE3*-fusion RCC cell line.⁷⁸ However, the molecular mechanisms behind *TFE*-fusion renal oncogenesis remain poorly understood. We propose three different models that could explain the oncogenic behaviour of gene fusions in general. The ‘lost activity model’ presumes a wild-type tumour-suppressive gene function that is disrupted by the gene fusion. However, a fusion protein is not generally translated in such cases. The ‘novel activity model’ refers to a novel transforming activity in the fusion protein that is conferred by altered protein conformation. Finally, according to the ‘dysregulated activity model’, which is the most widely accepted for *TFE3* gene fusions, the fusion protein upregulates oncogenic activity already present in the wild-type protein through introduction of a more active or less tightly controlled transcriptional promoter that is not regulated in the same way as the wild-type *TFE3* promoter. Consistent with this model, all *TFE3* fusion partners have constitutively active gene promoters, and *TFE3* fusion proteins are expressed at dramatically higher levels than wild-type *TFE3*.²⁵,²⁶,²⁸,³⁵,⁸¹–⁸³ Furthermore, the dysregulated activity model is known to be the mechanism for *TFEB*-fusion oncogenesis, with *MALAT1–TFEB* fusions generally upregulating wild-type *TFEB* protein and not chimeric protein. The dysregulated activity model is consistent with gene fusion mechanisms in other cancers, in which promoter substitution leads to upregulation of a transcription factor oncogene, such as *TMPRSS2–ERG* in prostate cancer.

The dysregulated activity model implies that the function of wild-type *TFE3* and *TFEB* proteins (and perhaps other MiT family members) is, at least in part, pro-oncogenic. Consistent with this theory, wild-type MiT oncogenic activity has been described in various cancer types.⁷⁸,⁸⁴ In a preclinical model of clear cell sarcoma, for example, wild-type *TFE3* protein and wild-type *MiTF* protein both mediate mitogenic activity of the *EWS–ATF1* oncoprotein responsible for the disease.⁷⁸ Furthermore, artificial expression of wild-type *MiTF* in UOK109 RCC cells can rescue soft-agar colonization inhibited by endogenous *NONO–TFE3* knockdown.⁷⁸ Similarly, wild-type *TFEB* expression has been shown to have mitogenic effects in some cancer types.⁸⁴

Oncogenic activity of MiT members is also supported by clinical observations. *MiTF* is amplified in 20% of metastatic melanomas, and a germline activating *MiTF* AA substitution was recently implicated in hereditary variants of RCC and melanoma (Table 1).⁸⁵–⁸⁷ Furthermore, higher *TFE3* expression in RCC tumours has been demonstrated to correlate independently with worse patient outcomes.⁸⁸,⁸⁹ Among 25 patients with RCC of unclassified histology, Mir *et al.*⁸⁸ reported that positive immunostaining for *TFE3* (*n* = 8) was associated with an 88% rate of high-grade disease, 50% rate of lymph node metastasis and 16% rate of 5-year cancer-specific survival, compared with rates of 29%, 6%, and 88%, respectively, for negative staining (*n* = 17). Macher-Goeppinger *et al.*⁸⁹ found that 9% of 876 RCC tumours analysed on a tissue microarray demonstrated some level of *TFE3* immunoreactivity, despite genetic confirmation in only 1%. *TFE3* immunostaining in patients lacking genetic confirmation of *TFE3*-fusion was associated with approximately twofold higher risks of advanced tumour grade, advanced tumour stage, and distant metastasis. Multivariable analysis, including all patients or just patients with clear cell histology, indicated a nearly twofold independent risk increase in cancer-specific mortality associated with presence of the *TFE*-fusion.

### Candidate TFE signalling pathways

#### Diversity of TFE signalling pathways

*TFE3* and *TFEB* are involved in a variety of signalling pathways, the dysregulation of which might contribute to renal carcinogenesis (Figure 4). *TFE3* is known to cooperate with SMAD proteins downstream of the TGFβ signalling pathway, which has a well-characterized role in carcinogenesis regulation.⁹⁰,⁹¹ Transcriptional activation of the *PAI1* gene, a regulator of fibrinolysis implicated in the metastasis of many cancer types, might also be involved in this pathway.⁹⁰,⁹¹ *TFE3* also directly binds and enhances activity of ETS-1, the prototype member of the ETS transcription factor family found in gene fusions in prostate cancer and sarcomas.⁹² *TFE3* and *TFEB* also govern transcription of E-cadherin, an important regulator of cancer
REVIEW

TFE3 and cell cycle regulation

There is some evidence to suggest that dysregulated TFE3 expression might promote oncogenesis by preventing cell cycle arrest (Figure 4). TFE3 protein is known to interact with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) target, E2F3, causing synergistic activation of E2F target genes and enabling escape from Rb-induced cell cycle arrest. The ability of TFE3 to block the anti-mitogenic effects of TGFβ has been suggested to result from the dependence of TGFβ signalling on the downstream Rb protein product. Potential upregulation of cyclin proteins by TFE3 might promote cell cycle progression. Furthermore, at least one type of TFE3-fusion protein (SFPQ–TFE3) can interact with p53, a key cell cycle regulator. Like TFE3, TFEB has the capacity to regulate transcriptional activation of TGFβ target genes.

TFE and Met tyrosine kinase regulation

Upregulation of the Met tyrosine kinase, an oncogene frequently amplified in papillary RCC, has been suggested to mediate TFE3-fusion oncogenicity (Figure 4). Tsuda et al. showed direct activation of the Met promoter by various TFE3 fusion proteins in vitro leading to up to a 3.5-fold increase in Met transcription. However, among the clinical renal tumours with TFE3-fusions that were included in this study, activated (that is, phosphorylated) Met protein was frequently undetectable. Furthermore, the FU-UR1 RCC cell line, which harbours an ASPSCR1–TFE3 type 1 gene fusion, required very high concentrations of a selective Met inhibitor (500 nM of PHA665752) for growth inhibition. This concentration is approximately 10 times higher than the IC₅₀ for growth previously reported for gastric cancer cells with Met upregulation, approximately 100 times higher than the IC₅₀ for phosphorylation, and similar to the IC₅₀ for cancer cells without Met upregulation. We have similarly observed no significant growth inhibition at high concentrations of selective Met inhibitors in a panel of TFE3-fusion RCC cell lines. Hence, Met inhibition might not be an effective monotherapy for patients with TFE-fusion RCC. Consistent with this idea, a recent clinical trial using the selective Met inhibitor, tivantinib, demonstrated poor progression-free survival (median 1.9 months) and no objective responses for six patients with RCC with known translocations.

Significance of the TFE3-fusion protein partner

An alternative mechanistic hypothesis, in addition to the main theories of TFE-fusion oncogenesis, is that the TFE3-fusion partner has a functional role within the chimeric protein. This theory has been proposed by some investigators based on the functional similarity of known TFE3 fusion partners. Most of these fusion partners seem to have regulatory roles in mRNA splicing or mitosis. Both NONO and SFPQ are pre-mRNA splicing factors, whereas PRCC can also be found in complexes with splicing factors. Both PRCC and CLTC are implicated in mitosis control through their

cell–cell interactions, and CD40L, the primary activator of T-cell lymphocytes, suggesting a possible role in tumour immunoevasion.

Both TFE3 and particularly TFEB have been implicated in mTORC1 signalling, a major regulator of protein synthesis that contributes to tumour growth in many cancer types, including RCC. Argani et al. reported mTORC1 activation to be more common among TFE3-fusion RCC tumours than clear cell RCC tumours, based on higher phosphorylated levels of the downstream mTORC1 target, S6. Similarly, we have observed the frequent activation of mTORC1 signalling in a panel of TFE3-fusion RCC cell lines, with variable suppression of cancer cell growth using a selective mTORC1 inhibitor. Additionally, phosphorylation and nuclear localization of TFEB was recently found by Pena-Llopis et al. to be regulated by mTORC1 in some cell types. Drugs with selective mTORC1 inhibition have been studied in a small number of patients with TFE-fusion RCC tumours, with occasional but inconsistent patient responses.

TFE and metabolic regulation

Kidney cancer is a metabolically driven disease, as evidenced by the involvement of many kidney cancer genes in major metabolic pathways. Similarly, both TFE3 and TFEB seem to have roles in the regulation of metabolic pathways (Figure 4). In liver and muscle, TFE3 governs insulin signalling and glucose metabolism through upregulation of IRS-2 and the hexokinase enzymes, inhibiting lipogenesis and increasing glycogen synthesis. We have also shown in a Birt-Hogg-Dubé preclinical model that TFE3 activity can be inhibited by expression of folliculin, a protein found in complexes with AMPK, the primary sensor of cell energy and a putative tumour suppressor. TFEB might have a similar energy sensing role. The TFEB gene product has been identified as a master transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, the cellular process by which nutrients are recycled during periods of cellular starvation.

direct or indirect interactions with MAD2B, a regulator of the anaphase-promoting complex. PRCC binds to MAD2B directly, whereas CLTC is thought to regulate MAD2B through shared interactions with the clathrin light chain component.¹¹⁵,¹¹⁶ The similarity of functions among TFE3 fusion partners is intriguing and warrants further investigation.

### Conclusions

Approximately two decades after the discovery of TFE3 gene fusions and one decade after the discovery of TFEB gene fusions, the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic effects of these mutations in kidneys remain unclear. As with other fusion proteins involving transcription factors, promoter substitution seems to be the key molecular event associated with TFE fusions, causing dysregulated TFE protein activity. Yet how this dysregulation translates into cancer is unknown. Interestingly, many signalling pathways already implicated in carcinogenesis seem to be regulated by TFE3 and TFEB, and it might be this multitude of pathways that enables a single mutation in these genes to be sufficient for cellular transformation. The ability of TFE3 and TFEB to regulate metabolic pathways and mTOR signalling is particularly intriguing, given the known roles of both processes in RCC tumorigenesis. Whether dysregulation of these pathways contributes to TFE-fusion carcinogenesis warrants further investigation, with the ultimate goal of pinpointing the most promising molecular targets for novel therapeutics. The advent of rapid genetic analysis and large scale investigative projects, including the TCGA Network, is now enabling the identification of increasing numbers of patients with tumours harbouring gene fusions, such as the TFE-fusion RCCs. Now could be the optimal time to begin thorough investigations of targeted therapies based on the existing and forthcoming knowledge of these specific cases.
