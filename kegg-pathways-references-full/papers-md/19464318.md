ABSTRACT

Triacylglycerol (TAG) stored in adipose tissue (AT) can be rapidly mobilized by the hydrolytic action of the three main lipases of the adipocyte. The non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) released are used by other tissues during times of energy deprivation. Until recently hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was considered to be the key rate-limiting enzyme responsible for regulating TAG mobilization. A novel lipase named adipose triglyceride lipase/desnutrin (ATGL) has been identified as playing an important role in the control of fat cell lipolysis. Additionally perilipin and other proteins of the surface of the lipid droplets protecting or exposing the TAG core of the droplets to lipases are also potent regulators of lipolysis. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of activation of the various lipases. Lipolysis is under tight hormonal regulation. The best understood hormonal effects on AT lipolysis concern the opposing regulation by insulin and catecholamines. Heart-derived natriuretic peptides (i.e., stored in granules in the atrial and ventricle cardiomyocytes and exerting stimulating effects on diuresis and natriuresis) and numerous autocrine/paracrine factors originating from adipocytes and other cells of the stroma-vascular fraction may also participate in the regulation of lipolysis. Endocrine and autocrine/paracrine factors cooperate and lead to a fine regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes. Age, anatomical site, sex, genotype and species differences all play a part in the regulation of lipolysis. The manipulation of lipolysis has therapeutic potential in the metabolic disorders frequently associated with obesity and probably in several inborn errors of metabolism.

in vitro studies remains to be elucidated. During lipolysis, intracellular TAG undergoes hydrolysis through the action of three major lipases: adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). NEFA and glycerol efflux from the fat cells is followed by transport of these metabolites in the bloodstream to other tissues (mainly liver for glycerol, and skeletal muscle, liver and heart for NEFA). Some of the NEFA that are formed during lipolysis do not leave the fat cell and can be re-esterified into intracellular TAG (Fig. 1). The glycerol formed during lipolysis is not re-utilized to a major extent by fat cells because they contain minimal amounts of the enzyme glycerol kinase necessary for its metabolism. In normal weight humans, the mean turnover rate of TAG in the total fat mass is about 100–300 g of TAG per day. An imbalance between the hydrolysis and synthesis of TAG can be important for the development of obesity. Altered lipolysis could be an element leading to obesity and inter-individual variations in AT lipolysis are of importance for the rate of weight loss. Conversely, excessive lipolytic rates, in conjunction with impairment in NEFA utilization by muscle and liver, may be a major contributor to the metabolic abnormalities found in individuals with upper body obesity and leads to type 2 diabetes.

The cellular and molecular aspects of lipolysis regulation will be reviewed. Important species-specific differences exist and so special attention will be given to the human fat cell. The quantitative and regulatory aspects of lipid mobilization in human AT will also be considered as well as its disturbances leading to metabolic disorders. Several hundred articles have been published relating to regulation of AT lipolysis in rodents and humans. We will, as often as possible, cite original papers and reviews that cover a large number of major publications in the area.

### 2. Exploration of lipolysis and lipid mobilization: methodological aspects

Exploration of several levels of physiological/biological organization is necessary to understand AT function. Lipolysis can be investigated at the whole body, AT, cell or subcellular and biochemical levels. Molecular and cellular approaches in murine preadipose cell lines (e.g., 3T3-L1, 3T3-F442A and ob-17 cells) associated with metabolic investigations in knockout and transgenic mice models have played a major role in expanding our knowledge of adipocyte and AT biology and physiology [13]. Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of results obtained with transgenic mice must be kept in perspective due to considerable species-specific differences in metabolic regulation. *In vitro* studies on isolated mature fat cells [14] or fat cell precursors differentiated into adipocytes *in vitro* [15,16] have provided suitable cell systems to explore human fat cell biology and a number of regulatory mechanisms. *In vivo* quantitative studies are more complex, though noticeable progress was made in the 1990s in improving *in vivo* studies in humans and reliable techniques are now available. The *in situ* microdialysis technique initially described by Lonnroth et al. [17] has been rapidly adopted and improved by other laboratories [18–22]. An open-flow microperfusion technique allows stable sampling of macromolecules from the interstitial space of AT [23]. Organ or tissue metabolism can be studied by measuring arteriovenous (a-v) differences combined with blood flow measurements (Fick principle) [24]. The method was adapted for the measurement of AT metabolism by the group of K. Frayn, who described a relatively selective investigation of subcutaneous AT by the a-v technique [25–27]. By cannulating the superficial inferior epigastric vein it is possible to obtain substrate concentrations in samples of blood draining the subcutaneous AT of the anterior abdominal wall from lean and obese subjects. Determination of AT venous glycerol concentrations and release provided similar results at rest as well as during prolonged, continuous exercise, whether determined by microdialysis or by a-v measurements across the AT. The two techniques provide similar estimates of lipolysis when compared in steady-state or quasi-steady-state conditions [28]. Methods based on the utilization of deuterium- or tritium-labelled metabolites can also be used to assess TAG storage or mobilization [29,30]. Nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics which address gene-diet interactions and may yield new tools are rapidly expanding areas with potential applications in the field of personalized nutrition [31,32] Gene expression profiling studies have successfully been used to investigate the molecular adaptations of AT to dietary interventions [33–35].

### 3. Triacylglycerol hydrolysis

#### 3.1. Lipases and protein-lipid interactions in lipolysis regulation

The mature adipocyte is comprised of a large lipid droplet occupying the major part of the cell, while adipocytes originating from fat cell precursors differentiated *in vitro* contain a large and heterogeneous population of lipid droplets of various sizes. Lipid droplets are considered dynamic organelles that are critical for the management of cellular lipid stores and lipolytic processes. Lipolysis requires that soluble cytosol lipases (i.e., ATGL and HSL) can access the highly hydrophobic TAG substrates coated by proteins surrounding the lipid droplet. Moreover, glycerol and the hydrophobic NEFA released by lipolysis must be removed from the fat cell. Adipocyte lipid droplets contain specific structural proteins as well as lipid metabolising enzymes; the structural reorganization of lipid droplets in response to the hormonal stimulation of lipolysis is accompanied by increases in the relative mass of several proteins and the recruitment of additional proteins [36]. Major cytosolic lipid-binding proteins as well as lipid-droplet associated proteins involved in the modulation of the rates of basal and/or hormone-regulated lipolysis will be considered (Fig. 2).

##### 3.1.1. Lipid-droplet associated proteins and lipid-binding proteins

NEFAs are highly toxic to cells and have been implicated in most of the pathological situations associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. FA esterification into TAG and packaging of the newly synthesized TAG are necessary for cell viability; and the adipocyte is the model cell for that purpose. TAG packaging into lipid droplets protects cells from the detrimental effects of excess NEFAs and proteins embedded on the lipid droplet surface help sequester esterified FA. The regulation of mammalian TAG hydrolases acting on water/lipid interphases often requires co-factors for full enzyme function and such co-factors have been found in fat cells. The crucial role of lipid-droplet coating proteins such as perilipin and of other cytosolic adipocyte proteins has been clarified during the last decade.

###### 3.1.1.1. Perilipins

The perilipin family are proteins covering the lipid droplets in adipocytes [37,38] that regulate the coordination of lipid storage and utilization in various cell types [39,40]. These proteins are collectively named PAT proteins after perilipin, adipophilin/adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP), and tail-interacting protein of 47 kilodaltons (TIP47). Other members include S3-12 and myocardial lipid droplet protein (MLDP), oxidative tissues-enriched PAT protein (OXPAT), and lipid storage droplet protein 5 (LSDP5). Perilipin A and B, arising from differential splicing, were the earliest identified lipid-droplet associated proteins with perilipin A being the predominant isoform found in mature adipocytes [41]. The central 25% of the perilipin A sequence, includes three hydrophobic sequences (H1, H2, and H3)

Fig. 2. Major pathways involved in the stimulation of human fat cell lipolysis. Signal transduction pathways for catecholamines via adrenergic receptors, autacoids- and metabolite-driven inhibitory receptors and atrial natriuretic peptides via type A receptor (NPR-A). Protein kinases (PKA and PKG (cGK-I)) are involved in target protein phosphorylation. HSL phosphorylation promotes its translocation from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplet. Perilipin phosphorylation induces an important physical alteration of the droplet surface that facilitates the action of HSL and the initiation of lipolysis. Docking of adipocyte lipid-binding protein (FABP4) to HSL favors the outflow from the cell of NEFAs released by the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols. Insulin, via stimulation of fat cell insulin receptors and phosphodiesterase-3B stimulation promotes cAMP degradation and antilipolytic effects while it is not active on cGMP-dependent pathways (not shown in the diagram).

and an acidic region. The three hydrophobic sequences play a major role in targeting and anchoring perilipins to lipid droplets [42]. Perilipin A is also the most highly phosphorylated protein in adipocytes stimulated by lipolytic hormones and is essential for the hydrolysis of TAG stored in the fat cell lipid droplets by adipocyte lipases. The amino and carboxyl termini are also critical to the function of perilipin A in facilitating triacylglycerol storage [43]. Perilipin A is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent proteins kinase A (PKA); the sequence of mouse perilipin A contains six consensus sites for the phosphorylation of serine residues by PKA. Mutagenesis studies have facilitated understanding of their roles; phosphorylation of serine 492 triggers a major remodelling of lipid droplets which will facilitate lipolysis by massively increasing the surface area of lipid available for lipase binding [38]. Perilipin A is also phosphorylated by the cGMP-dependent proteins kinase G (PKG) but the phosphorylated residues have not been explored in detail [44]. Perilipin ablation causes a dramatic attenuation of hormone-stimulated lipolysis while it is reported to increase rates of lipolysis under unstimulated conditions. Nevertheless, genetic ablation of perilipin, which leads to a lean phenotype and resistance to genetic or obesity-promoting diets [45,46], also induces alterations in the gene expression of oxidative and lipid biosynthesis pathways in AT and other peripheral tissues (i.e., liver skeletal muscle and kidney) [47]. Proteolysis of perilipin involving the lysosomal protein degradation machinery may constitute a novel mechanism for enhancing adipocyte lipolysis [48]. This mechanism may contribute to the enhanced rate of lipolysis observed in HIV patients receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). It is now well established that perilipin expression and its phosphorylation state are critical elements in the regulation of fat cell lipolysis [39]. Low perilipin content is associated with a high in vivo lipolytic activity in humans. A decrease in perilipin may constitute a mechanism for enhanced adipocyte lipolysis under non-stimulated (basal) conditions, and increased basal lipolysis has been linked to whole body metabolic dysregulation [49]. Elements of vesicle-transport systems may prove important in the regulation of lipolysis. From a siRNA screen in Drosophila cells, the vesicle-mediated coat protein complex I was identified as an evolutionary-conserved regulator of PAT protein composition and of ATGL access to the lipid droplet [50]. A similar role for this complex remains to be demonstrated in adipocytes.

3.1.1.2. Caveolin-1. Caveolins and caveolae play a role in many aspects of cell biology from vesicular transport to signal transduction. In particular, caveolin-1 has been shown to have inhibitory interactions with various proteins such as PKA, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and insulin receptors [51,52]. Caveolin-1 is abundant in adipocytes where it is an important component of the fat cell plasma membrane and is also localized to the lipid droplet [53]. Caveolin-1 null mice exhibit attenuated lipolytic activity. The phosphorylation of perilipin was dramatically reduced in these mice, indicating that caveolin-1 may facilitate phosphorylation of perilipin [54]. Caveolin-1 can dramatically inhibit cAMP-dependent signalling in vivo and a direct interaction between caveolin-1 and the catalytic subunit of PKA has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo [55,56]. In the adipocyte, ~50% of plasma membrane surface area is represented by caveolae-derived membranes; thus caveolin-1 mediated regulation of PKA signalling may be part of the additional mechanisms modulating cAMP-dependent signalling and finally lipolysis. The contribution of caveolin-1 in the regulation of lipolysis has not been explored in human fat cells and related pathologies have not been reported. Moreover, the contribution of adipocyte caveolae in signal transduction modulation still requires further experiments to resolve controversies around their numerous activities [53].

3.1.1.3. Proteins interacting with hormone-sensitive lipase. Proper activation of lipolysis relies upon proteins that are not directly involved in the catalytic process. Two proteins have been shown to interact with HSL: fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4), also known as ALBP and aP2, and lipotransin [57,58]. FABP4 is a cytosolic lipid-binding protein highly expressed in adipocytes that is involved in FA and retinoic acid intracellular trafficking [59]. It acts as a molecular chaperone, facilitating FA uptake and lipolysis [60]. In the case of the latter process, it shuttles FA out of the fat cell. FABPs fold as a conserved beta-barrel forming an interior water-filled cavity into which the ligand (i.e., typically a single long-chain fatty acid) non-covalently resides [61]. FABP4-null mice have decreased lipolytic capacity [62,63] with basal and stimulated lipolysis attenuated and the threshold of intracellular fatty acid levels increased. HSL contains a site for fatty acid binding that allows for FABP4 association. FABP4 physically binds to HSL in vitro and in vivo. HSL and FABP4 bind in a 1 to 1 ratio in the cytosol in response to accentuated lipolysis [64]. The first 300 amino acids of HSL provide a docking domain for FABP4 [57]. HSL and FABP4 form a physical complex when HSL is phosphorylated and FABP4 is bound to a FA. As demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, this complex translocates to lipid droplets upon PKA activation [65]. Mice null for FABP4 have been shown to compensate FABP4 deletion by increasing expression of keratinocyte fatty acid binding protein (KFABP/FABP5). FABP5 can functionally compensate for the absence of FABP4, resulting in no major alterations in adipocyte metabolism or fat accumulation in response to short-term feeding of high-fat diets [66,67]. Further work is required to discern the nature of the phenotypic heterogeneity and the relative role of these proteins in the control of adipocyte lipolysis. Studies with transgenic mice with various FABP subtypes expressed in fat cells have shown that lipolysis seems to be linked to total FABP content and not to a specific FABP type [68]. In human AT, the FABP4/FABP5 content differs in AT depots and also according to obesity [69]. FABPs are interesting candidates for a further understanding of their role in the regulation of lipolysis and fatty acid disturbances related to insulin resistance syndrome. Inhibiting FABP4 with small-molecule inhibitors is possible and this has been shown to be a treatment for type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis in mouse models [70]. Another protein of interest is lipotransin, a member of the katanin family which appears to translocate HSL to the lipid droplet and may dock the protein to its surface [58]. Faced with a paucity of further investigations, the exact contribution of lipotransin, if any, to catecholamine lipolytic and insulin antilipolytic effects awaits further confirmation.

3.1.1.4. Protein interacting with adipose triglyceride lipase, CGI-58/ ABHD5. CGI-58 (Comparative Gene Identification 58) also known as ABHD5 (alpha/beta-hydrolase domain-containing protein 5) has been shown to specifically activate ATGL [71]. ABHD5 is a 349 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 40 kDa that binds tightly to lipid droplets by interacting with perilipin A in non-stimulated adipocytes. Highly expressed in testis and AT, it belongs to the esterase/thioesterase/lipase subfamily characterized by the existence of an α/β hydrolase fold [72]. However, ABHD5 differs from other members of this lipase subfamily in that its putative catalytic triad contains an asparagine in place of the usual serine residue and it lacks lipase activity. Mutations in ABHD5 are the cause of a rare autosomal recessive disease called Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) [73]. With increases in intracellular cAMP levels, ABHD5 dissociates from perilipin and becomes cytosolic while decreases in cAMP levels reverse the dissociation process. Mutations of ABHD5 with single amino acid substitutions (Q130P, E260K) or deletions suppress perilipin binding [74] and totally fail to activate ATGL [71]. In summary, the recent findings of various research groups have led to the following sequence of events to be proposed: in the basal state, in unstimulated conditions, ABHD5 binds tightly to perilipin A and is unable to activate ATGL. Then, under hormonal stimulation, cAMP rises and PKA activation promotes perilipin A phosphorylation at several serine residues including serine-517. ABHD5 dissociation from perilipin is initiated and then ABHD5 interacts with ATGL and activates TAG hydrolysis [75–78] (Fig. 3). ABHD5 could have other physiological functions. In addition to its function as an ATGL activator, ABHD5 was found to possess lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity in mouse white AT which might affect phospholipid synthesis [79].

3.1.1.5. Aquaporin. Aquaporins are channel-forming integral proteins that function as water channels but some of them also allow the transport of glycerol. Aquaporin-7 (AQP7) is a glycerol channel mainly expressed in the adipocytes [80]. Six prospective sites of PKA phosphorylation exist in mouse and human AQP7 suggesting a putative cAMP/PKA-dependent regulation. Mice with deletion of the AQP7 gene show defective glycerol exit from fat cells, accumulation of TAG leading to adipocyte hypertrophy, and moderate obesity [81,82]. Short-term regulation and translocation of AQP7 to the plasma membrane is under catecholamine control, whereas long-term regulation of AQP7 is under the negative control of insulin [83].

3.1.1.6. Cide-domain-containing proteins (CideN). Members of the cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector (CIDE) gene family have been shown to regulate lipid metabolism. Cell death-inducing DFFA (DNA fragmentation factor-alpha)-like effector A (CIDEA) is a protein that regulates lipolysis in human adipocytes through cross-talk involving tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) which negatively regulates transcription of this gene [84]. Depletion of CIDEA by RNA interference in human adipocytes leads to increased lipolysis. CIDEA, known to be a mitochondrial protein in brown adipocytes, co-localizes with perilipin around lipid droplets in white fat cells [85,86]. CIDEA greatly enhances lipid droplet size when ectopically expressed in preadipocytes and favors cellular lipid accumulation [85]. CIDEA expression is increased in cancer cachexia and correlates with elevated levels of NEFA and reported weight loss. CIDEA overexpression in vitro increases fatty acid oxidation and decreases glucose oxidation [87]. CIDEA therefore exerts multiple roles in adipocyte FA metabolism influencing lipolysis, triacylglycerol deposition and FA oxidation. In humans another CideN protein, CIDEC (FSP27, fat-specific protein 27) is predominantly expressed in subcutaneous adipocytes and is down-regulated in response to a reduced caloric intake. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CIDEC resulted in an increased basal release of NEFA, and decreased responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation of lipolysis [88]. The putative interaction of members of the CideN family with lipases remains unknown.

3.1.2. Lipases and triacylglycerol hydrolysis

Until recently TAG hydrolysis in AT was believed to be exclusively controlled by HSL. The model of HSL activation as the rate-limiting step in TAG lipolysis was brought into question when residual fat cell lipolysis was observed in mice lacking HSL [89,90]. In these mice, catecholamine-induced lipolysis is markedly blunted; however, basal (i.e., unstimulated) lipolysis is unaltered in isolated adipocytes. Accumulation of DAG in fat cells shows that HSL is the rate-limiting enzyme for the catabolism of DAG but not of TAG [91]. The data therefore suggested the existence of a TAG lipase different from HSL, though it was questioned whether the high activity of the novel lipase resulted from a compensatory mechanism due to the lack of HSL. HSL-deficient rodent adipocytes exhibit features of brown adipocytes with a substantial up-regulation of UCP-1 [92]. This result could partly explain the limited AT expansion described in HSL-deficient mice. Thus, the lack of HSL

Fig. 3. Impact of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent pathways on lipid-droplet associated proteins leading to lipase activation. In the resting (i.e., unstimulated) state, HSL is dispersed in the cytoplasm, whereas perilipin coats the lipid droplets and binds to α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5 also known as CGI-58), a key co-activator of ATGL. According to the still-debated working hypothesis, ATGL is cytosolic and partly bound to the lipid droplet [39]. Catecholamines promote cAMP production while natriuretic peptides stimulate cGMP production. cAMP activates PKA while cGMP activates PKG (cGK-I), both leading to phosphorylation of perilipin and HSL. In the activated state, perilipin phosphorylation induces physical alteration of the lipid droplet surface, which facilitates the action of phosphorylated HSL on TAG hydrolysis. Phosphorylation of perilipin also promotes ABHD5 release, which then binds to ATGL and activates the enzyme which hydrolyzes TAG leading to DAG production. HSL and MGL contribute to the final hydrolysis of DAG and MAG. Concomitant enhancement of ATGL, HSL and MGL activities is necessary for full hydrolysis of TAG and release of NEFAs and glycerol.

potently affected adipocyte function resulting in reduced AT weight and led to the discovery of another important lipase.

3.1.2.1. Hormone-sensitive lipase. HSL has been considered for a long time the key enzyme catalysing the rate-limiting step of AT lipolysis. Administration of a specific inhibitor of HSL reduces plasma NEFA levels in mice, rats and dogs and reveals its in vivo role [93]. Several comprehensive reviews have been published concerning HSL enzymology, HSL gene and protein structure as well as the regulation of enzymatic activity [72,94–97]. Several isoforms of HSL ranging in size from 88 to 130 kDa are produced by a single gene by the use of alternative promoters in different tissues [98–102]. A domain structure model for the adipocyte isoform of HSL has been proposed. Adipocyte HSL is composed of an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain that is identical in all known HSL isoforms. This catalytic domain contains the active site, including residues of the catalytic triad (Ser, Asp, His), as well as a regulatory module with all the known phosphorylation sites of HSL. As described above, the N-terminal domain interacts with FABP4. One mole of TAG is broken down in a stepwise fashion via diacylglycerol (DAG) and monoacylglycerol (MAG) intermediates into 3 mol of free fatty acid and 1 mol of glycerol. In vitro, HSL catalyzes the hydrolysis of TAG into DAG and DAG into MAG. The relative FA hydrolase activity of HSL in vitro is 10-fold greater against DAG than TAG. HSL shows a preference for activity against FA in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions [103]. The enzyme is also responsible for the hydrolysis of cholesterol and retinyl esters [95]. Although HSL has the capacity to hydrolyze monoacylglycerol in vitro, monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) is required to obtain complete hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols in vivo [104]. Unlike other known mammalian triacylglycerol lipases, HSL phosphorylation by PKA leads to an activation of the enzyme. Through modulation of cAMP levels, catecholamines and insulin therefore control HSL activity. Three phosphorylation sites have been characterized on rat HSL: Ser⁵⁶³, Ser⁶⁵⁹ and Ser⁶⁶⁰ [105]. The latter two were shown to be responsible for the in vitro activation of HSL, whereas the role of Ser⁵⁶³ remains elusive. Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway is able to activate lipolysis by phosphorylating HSL on Ser⁶⁶⁰ [106]. The in vivo importance of this pathway remains to be clarified.

There have been few reports regarding the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on HSL phosphorylation and lipolysis. AMPK is a sensor of the cellular energy state that responds to metabolic stress and other signals. Activation of AMPK by a specific agonist AICAR (5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside) in isolated fat cells phosphorylates the Ser⁵⁶⁵ residue (equivalent to S⁵⁵⁴ in humans) on HSL and decreases beta-AR-stimulated lipolysis in rodent adipocytes [107,108]. This data suggests that AMPK acts on hormone-sensitive lipase by blocking its translocation to the lipid droplet. In mature rodent and human adipocytes, AMPK activation has a clear antilipolytic effect [108,109]. However, on 3T3-L1 adipocytes, overexpression of a dominant-inhibitory mutant of AMPK decreased isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis [110]. Prolonged treatment of adipocytes with AICAR results in a biphasic effect with an initial inhibition of lipolysis concomitant with inhibition of HSL activity followed in the long-term by an enhancement of lipolysis and increased ATGL content [111]. These data may help to explain the contradictory results regarding the pro- and anti-lipolytic effect of AMPK. By analogy with other lipases, HSL may exist in two conformational states, an active open form with exposure of a hydrophobic area that interacts with lipids and unmasking of the catalytic site and an inactive closed form [112]. Phosphorylation of HSL would be required to trigger the transition from the closed to the open form. In vivo, an important step in lipolysis activation seems to be the translocation of HSL from a cytosolic compartment to the surface of the lipid droplet
[77,113–115] (Fig. 3). In unstimulated cells, HSL is diffusively distributed throughout the cytosol. Upon stimulation of the fat cell with a lipolytic agonist, the HSL moves from the cytosol to the surface of lipid droplets where it interacts with perilipin and neutral lipids [113]. Fat cells lacking perilipin are incapable of translocating HSL to the lipid droplet after increases in cyclic AMP [116]. Major rearrangements of the morphology of lipid droplets with their fragmentation greatly increase the surface area accessible to HSL action [117]. Examination of the physiology of HSL-null mice has offered additional insight into the relative importance of HSL in TAG hydrolysis *in vivo* which will be discussed later.

### 3.1.2.2. Adipose triglyceride lipase/desnutrin

In 2004, three groups independently reported an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing TAG. This novel TAG hydrolase, which was responsible for the cytosolic acyl-hydrolase activity in white AT of HSL-deficient mice, was named adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), adiponutrin or phospholipase A2ζ [118–120]. This lipase belongs to a family of proteins containing a patatin-like domain; it is a lipid hydrolase with an unusual folded topology that differs from classical lipases. ATGL enzymology, gene and protein structure have recently been reviewed [72]. To sum-up, ATGL is a 486 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 54 kDa. The primary structures of the human and murine ATGL share 84% sequence identity which is higher (>95%) within the patatin domain harbouring the active site of the enzyme. Structural domains of human ATGL have been described. A hydrophobic stretch from amino acids 315 to 360 was proposed to mediate binding to the lipid droplet. In addition, two phosphorylation sites were localized in the C-terminal region of the enzyme (Ser⁴⁰⁴ and Ser⁴²⁸ in human ATGL). The nature of the putative protein-kinase and the functional role of such sites are unknown. The human ATGL is 19 amino acids longer than the mouse ortholog and contains a proline-rich sequence at its very C-terminus. It is unknown if this peptide contributes to species-specific differences in ATGL regulation and function [72]. ATGL exhibits 10-fold higher substrate specificity for TAG than DAG and selectively assumes the first step in TAG hydrolysis resulting in the formation of DAG and fatty acid [118].

ATGL is highly expressed in AT and its expression markedly increases during adipocyte differentiation. However, HSL has a higher capacity than ATGL to hydrolyze triacylglycerols *in vitro* [121]. Overexpression of ATGL in a mouse fat cell line stimulated basal and catecholamine-induced lipolysis. Knockdown of ATGL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in a decrease of glycerol and fatty acid release [122]. ATGL-null mice show blunted fat cell lipolysis. ATGL deficiency causes a potent reduction (more than 75%) of fatty acid release by white fat cells in mice and significant TAG accumulation [123]. As a consequence, ATGL deficient mice rapidly become obese [123]. Functional activation of ATGL has been delineated [72]. ABHD5, the co-activator of ATGL, stimulates TAG hydrolase activity in wild-type and HSL-deficient WAT but not in ATGL-deficient WAT, suggesting that ATGL is the sole target for ABHD5-mediated activation of adipose lipolysis (Fig. 3). ABHD5 does not affect HSL enzyme activity [71,124]. Silencing studies of ABHD5 in human fat cells have shown that the lipolytic action of ATGL is dependent on ABHD5 [125]. *In vitro*, ABHD5 is less efficient at stimulating human than mouse ATGL [71,126]. The C-terminal region of human ATGL is involved in the suppression of enzyme activity. Together, ATGL and HSL are responsible for more than 95% of the TG hydrolase activity present in murine white AT. In murine adipocytes, ATGL translocation to lipid droplets was without alteration of HSL and ATGL colocalization [77]. Some species-specific differences could exist. A recent study in a human adipocyte model (i.e., differentiated hMADS adipocytes) has provided valuable mechanistic information on the respective roles of ATGL and HSL in lipolysis regulation in a whole cell context instead of using cell fractions. Translocation of ATGL from the cytosol to smaller lipid droplets was observed and ATGL translocation increased its colocalization with HSL under stimulated conditions [125]. Alterations of ATGL expression resulted in dramatic changes in whole cell lipolysis. Its overexpression increases basal lipolysis while its inhibition eliminates hormone-stimulated lipolysis. Silencing studies of ATGL and ABHD5 have validated the role of both lipases in human fat cells. The hydrolase activity of ATGL is crucial for basal and hormone-stimulated lipolysis in human fat cells. ATGL is important in the provision of DAG to HSL in basal and stimulated conditions despite HSL’s own capacity to cleave the first ester bond [125]. HSL is indispensable for complete lipolysis as shown in human differentiated preadipocytes [127]. Therefore, we believe that the increased number of ATGL–CGI-58 complexes formed following perilipin A phosphorylation and docked on small lipid droplets govern PKA-stimulated lipolysis. Overall, it is the sequential effect of ATGL-accentuated TAG hydrolysis, phosphorylated HSL and MGL action which yields massive increases in NEFA release in response to PKA activation (Fig. 3).

A final regulatory step is also provided by the association between FABP4 and HSL. NEFA binding to FABP4 and HSL phosphorylation precede the association of FABP4 and HSL. Therefore, in addition to supporting NEFA trafficking to the plasma membrane in a reaction that is independent of physical association with HSL, FABP4 bound to FA associates with activated, phosphorylated HSL on the surface of lipid droplet. FA-FABP4-HSL association could either limit HSL activity or alter the complex’s formation on lipid droplets [65]. Because NEFA need to be trafficked from the site of hydrolysis (i.e., lipid droplet) to the plasma membrane, the loss of FABP4 may reduce NEFA release. It is confirmed in studies showing that in the absence of FABP4, lipolysis is decreased and NEFA content within adipocytes is three times greater than in wild-type littermates [63].

### 3.1.2.3. Monoglyceride lipase

Monoglyceride lipase (MGL) has a predicted amino acid sequence consisting of 302 amino acids corresponding to a molecular weight of a 33 kDa. The action of MGL is required in the final hydrolysis of the 2-monoacylglycerols produced by HSL activation [104]. MGL hydrolyzes the 1(3) and 2-esters bonds of MAG at equal rates and is without *in vitro* catalytic activity against DAG, TAG or cholesteryl esters. The structural elements in MGL, as well as the putative catalytic triad, have been identified. The residues of the proposed triad, Ser¹²², in a GXSXG motif, Asp²³⁹, and His²⁶⁹, were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Mutation of any of these three residues completely abolishes both lipase and esterase activities of MGL [128]. MGL is constitutively expressed in AT and felt to be not rate limiting due to its abundance (Figs. 2 and 3).

### 3.1.2.4. Alternative lipases

Other lipases have been identified in fat cells; however, their role in the physiological control of TAG lipolysis remains questionable. Three additional ATGL/desnutrin adiponutrin members (GS2, GS2-Like, and PNPLA1) have been identified [119,129]. GS2 lipase is a TAG lipase with a patatin homology domain that includes a combination of the G/AXGXXG and GXSXG motifs that are conserved in calcium-independent phospholipase A2 family members. *In vitro*, its triolein hydrolase activity exceeded that of ATGL/desnutrin. GS2 transcripts have only been identified in humans [129]. The lipases are expressed and regulated in a manner consistent with a role in energy homeostasis but additional studies are necessary to understand the role of this gene family. Another lipase, carboxylesterase 3 (EC 3.1.1.1) has been proposed to be responsible for non-HSL lipase activity in white AT *in vitro* suggesting an involvement in HSL-independent lipolysis in adipocytes [130]. An adipocyte differentiation-related gene expressed in 3T3-L1 cells has been described to possess
remarkable structural resemblance to triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH) with 70.4% identity. TGH-2 and TGH-1 lipases have been identified in terms of tissue distribution, subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and regulation. These lipases were found in the fat cake of adipocytes [131]. It must be remembered that inhibition of HSL activity in ATGL-deprived adipocytes results in an almost complete absence of FA release by fat cells [124,125]. This result suggests that, besides ATGL and HSL, the other additional lipases identified in AT contribute little to the lipolytic capacity of white fat cells. The substrates and products of their hydrolase activity could differ from the usual TAG lipolytic pathways providing NEFAs. To conclude, additional known or unknown lipases appear to play only a quantitatively minor role in fat cell hydrolysis of TAG.

### 3.2. Selective mobilization of fatty acids

FA are selectively mobilized from AT. The selectivity of fatty acid mobilization from rat and human AT has been reported during fasting in vivo [132,133] and during stimulated lipolysis in isolated fat cells [103,134]. In human fat cells, the relative mobilization rate for essential FA decreased in the following order: C20:5, n–3 > C20:4, n–6 > C18:3, n–3 > C18:2, n–6 > C22:6, n–3. Interestingly, C20:5, n–3 and C20:4, n–6, which are respectively precursors of the 3- and 2-series of prostaglandins, were preferentially mobilized. It is concluded that FA are selectively mobilized from human fat cells according to molecular structure, in full agreement with animal studies [103]. As a rule, the relative mobilization decreases with increasing chain length for a given degree of unsaturation and increases with increasing unsaturation for a given chain length. The two most readily mobilized FA, 20:5n–3 and 20:4n–6, are both precursors of eicosanoids that have potent effects on lipolysis and adipocyte development (i.e., PGE2 and PGI2) [135]. The contribution of HSL to the selective mobilization was studied using purified HSL and stable lipid emulsions [136,137]. The fatty acid specificities of HSL do not seem to be oriented towards a special demand by tissues or towards a preferential sparing of particular FA. Comparison of the relative hydrolysis of FA by HSL and their mobilization rates from adipocytes supports the view that the low mobilization of some FA could derive from a low release of FA by HSL, whereas the high mobilization of other FA seems unrelated to the enzymologic properties of HSL [138]. Because HSL activity can only explain part of the fatty acid mobilization, it is possible that ATGL, FABP4 and lipid droplet associated proteins such as perilipin also contribute to the fatty acid selectivity. It has recently been shown that mice deficient in FABP4 and FABP5 produce a FA, palmitoleate (C16:1 n–7), which acts as a lipokine stimulating insulin action [139]. Interestingly, this FA is preferentially mobilized during lipolysis in human AT [103]. The relative reuptake of FA by AT is also related to molecular structure: its decreases progressively with increasing unsaturation. The preferential release and the low reuptake of some highly polyunsaturated FA can partly explain their low proportions in AT TAG as compared to the diet.

### 3.3. Control of HSL and ATGL gene expression

Factors modulating HSL gene expression have been studied in mature adipocytes using murine preadipose cell lines. cAMP and phorbol esters were shown to decrease HSL mRNA and lipase activity levels through independent mechanisms suggesting that sustained activation of the PKA and protein kinase C pathways exerts a negative control on HSL gene expression [140]. In rodent and human adipocytes, glucose is a positive regulator of HSL expression. Glucose deprivation results in a decrease in HSL mRNA and lipase activity levels [141]. In primary cultures of rat adipocytes, prolonged treatment with glucose and insulin results in an increase in basal and stimulated lipolysis and maintenance of HSL protein levels [142]. The effect of glucose is reversible and is not due to an impairment of the differentiation program. Long chains FA do not seem to affect HSL expression.

The 775 amino acid-long adipocyte HSL is encoded by nine exons spanning eleven kilobases [100]. A short 5′ non-coding exon located 1.5 kb upstream of exon 1 contains the transcriptional start site [98]. The proximal 5′ flanking region contains an E-box that binds upstream stimulatory factors and two GC boxes that bind Sp1 and Sp3 [143]. The cis-acting elements are essential for promoter activity. The E box also mediates the response to glucose but the nature of the transcription factor complex responsible for glucose induction is unknown. Besides transcriptional mechanisms, alternative splicing of pre-mRNA has an important role in the regulation of gene expression. An alternatively spliced form of human HSL has been identified in AT [144]. In-frame skipping of exon 6 generates a catalytically inactive but phosphorylatable protein. The short form HSL mRNA represents approximately 20% of HSL transcripts.

Little is known about the molecular pathways regulating ATGL expression; a number of analyses are limited to measurements of ATGL mRNA levels and few report enzyme activities [72]. During adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, ATGL expression is strongly induced as is HSL; maximal levels are observed when the cells accumulate lipid droplets [118,145]. Although lipolysis is mainly regulated post-transcriptionally, some treatments of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin or beta-adrenergic agonists decreased concentrations of ATGL and HSL mRNA [146,147]. The inhibitory effect of insulin on ATGL expression was also confirmed in vivo in insulin resistant animals. Defective insulin signalling was associated with enhanced lipolysis and increased ATGL mRNA levels which might contribute to elevated NEFA mobilization [122]. ATGL mRNA concentrations are markedly affected by the nutritional status: they increase with fasting and decrease during refeeding [120,122,129,146]. Glucocorticoids could be responsible for the increase in ATGL mRNA levels in the fasted state [120].

A strong and unexpected co-expression of HSL and ATGL has been observed in vivo in human AT [121,145,148]. It has been observed both at the mRNA and protein levels in subcutaneous and visceral AT. These observations on a large number of subjects suggest that the two genes carried by different chromosomes share common trans-acting regulatory mechanisms.

### 4. Mechanisms of the hormonal control of lipolysis

#### 4.1. G-protein-coupled receptors and adenyl cyclase regulation

Hormones and activators or/inhibitors of the adipocyte plasma membrane adenyl cyclase system and enzymes controlling intracellular cyclic AMP levels are direct regulators of lipolysis. An increase in intracellular cyclic AMP enhances lipolysis while inhibition of lipolysis (i.e., antilipolysis) is associated with the lowering of cyclic AMP levels. In vitro studies on human fat cells have established that the tuning of cyclic AMP levels and lipolysis by hormones and paracrine agents is dependent on the balanced cross-talk between the stimulatory and inhibitory pathways mediating the control of adenyl cyclase on one hand and fat cell cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) on the other. PDEs, by hydrolyzing cyclic AMP, are critical in terminating signals initiated by cyclic nucleotides and therefore regulate biological processes mediated by second messengers. Activation or inhibition of adenyl cyclase activity via receptors from the seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor family (GPCR) controls the
formation of cyclic AMP from ATP. Stimulating receptors are coupled to the heterotrimeric G-protein Gs involved in the transduction of the signal and which activates adenylyl cyclase and cAMP production, while activation of inhibitory receptors coupled to the G-protein Gi inhibits the activity of the enzyme and lowers cAMP levels (Fig. 2).

### 4.1.1. Receptors coupled to the GTP binding protein, Gs

There are three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes (beta-AR) (beta₁-AR, beta₂-AR and beta₃-AR), each of which is coupled to the G-alpha subunit of the Gs protein. Their stimulation increases intracellular cAMP levels in fat cells of various species although considerable species-specific differences exist [149]. Simultaneous inactivation of the three beta-AR subtypes has revealed that beta-ARs play a critical role in the body’s defence against diet-induced obesity [150]. Strikingly, catecholamines at high concentrations stimulate lipolysis in white adipocytes of mice without beta-ARs [151]. The nature of this receptor is unknown. While beta₁-AR and beta₂-AR are expressed in many body tissues, the beta₃-AR is predominantly found in white and brown adipocytes in rodents, rabbits, golden hamsters and dogs. Stimulation of the beta-ARs leads to lipolysis in white adipocytes and non-shivering thermogenesis in brown fat [152]. In rodent adipocytes, beta₃-AR simultaneously activates the PKA and MAP kinase pathways [153]. In human fat cells, both beta₁- and beta₂-ARs are known to stimulate cyclic AMP production and lipolysis *in vitro* [154] and *in vivo* [21]. The physiological role of the beta₃-AR in human AT remains questionable. The receptor does not contribute to catecholamine-induced lipolysis in human subcutaneous adipocytes [155]. Moreover, one of the common agonists used to explore beta₃-AR effects, CGP 12177, exerts, in fact, atypical interactions with beta₁-adrenergic receptors [156–158]. Confirmation of the lack of beta₃-adrenergic effects in humans has also been provided by *in vivo* studies. During isoproterenol infusion at doses <200 ng/kg min there was no evidence of a beta₃-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in human lipolysis, energy expenditure and lipid oxidation [159]. Similar conclusions were obtained using *in situ* microdialysis [21]. To conclude, although some beta₃-agonists exerted some lipolytic activity *in vitro*, a role for beta₃-ARs in the regulation of lipid mobilization has not been convincingly validated *in vivo*.

The other hormones that are known to exert lipolytic effects in rodent fat cells through Gs-protein-coupled receptors are ineffective or weak activators of lipolysis in human fat cells. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and lipotropin (beta-LPH) exert potent lipolytic and lipid mobilizing effects in rabbits [160]. In rodent fat cells stimulation of lipolysis is mediated via MC2 receptors [161]. However, these peptide hormones have no effect in human fat cells. Glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which also act in rodent fat cells, do not stimulate lipolysis in isolated human subcutaneous fat cells. PTH stimulates lipolysis in human fat cells [162–164] with the N-terminal 1-34 peptide portion of the hormone being responsible for adenylyl cyclase stimulation and cAMP production leading to stimulation of lipolysis. Furthermore, PTH stimulates lipid mobilization *in vivo* in man though the effect occurs at rather high PTH concentrations, which are clearly extra-physiological. There are no data concerning a physiological contribution of PTH in the control of lipid mobilization in humans. Human recombinant TSH (hTSH) has been shown to induce a lipolytic response similar to that obtained with a beta-AR agonist in isolated infant adipocytes [165] and the lipolytic effect was completely blocked by inhibitory TSH receptor (TSHR) antibodies. TSHR mRNA was found in isolated infant and adult AT adipocytes [166]. Long-term treatment, but not acute stimulation, of human adipocytes with endothelin-1 results in an increase in lipolysis. This effect seems to be mediated by acti-

vation of the ET<sub>A</sub>-endothelin receptor but the mechanism remains unclear [167].

### 4.1.2. Receptors coupled to the GTP binding protein, Gi

In addition to lipolysis-promoting agents, neuropeptides, paracrine factors and autacoid agents (adenosine, prostaglandins and their metabolites and other small-molecule compounds such as short chain FA, beta-hydroxybutyrate and lactate) originating from the adipocytes themselves, but also from preadipocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages and sympathetic nerve terminals, are known to negatively control adenylyl cyclase activity and inhibit lipolysis by their interaction with plasma membrane receptors belonging to the GPCR family (Figs. 2 and 3). Catecholamines have a special status since they are able to stimulate both beta-ARs and a major antilipolytic pathway involving alpha₂-ARs. In fact, adrenaline and noradrenaline stimulate and/or inhibit adenylyl cyclase and lipolysis depending on their relative affinity for the beta<sub>1/2-</sub> and alpha₂-ARs and the relative number of beta<sub>1/2-</sub> and alpha₂-ARs expressed in the fat cell. Their coupling efficiency to heterotrimeric G-proteins involved in the transduction of the signal (Gs- and Gi-protein, respectively) and adenylyl cyclase activity could also play a modulating role [168]. Recently long chain FAs have been shown to suppress alpha₂-adrenergic responses in human isolated fat cells. The impact of long chain FAs on lipolysis was confirmed in patients during an exercise-induced lipid mobilization challenge. Long chain FA-mediated suppression of antilipolytic pathways represents a mechanism whereby a high fat content in the diet might increase adipose tissue lipolysis [169].

The other adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptor subtypes (A₁- adenosine receptor, NPY-Y₁ receptor and EP-3 prostaglandin E₂ receptor) have been identified and quantified in human fat cells [170,171]. Their stimulation inhibits lipolysis while antagonists of such receptors, relieving the inhibition of cAMP production promoted by the endogenous ligands, enhance the lipolytic activity of fat cells. The physiological relevance of all these *in vitro* investigations is yet to be established. It is recognized that agonists leading to activation of Gi-protein-coupled receptors of the adipocytes will limit NEFA release and represent putative antihyperlipidemic drugs. Strategies aimed at targeting small-molecular compounds towards receptors of small-molecule compounds for modulating lipolysis have been proposed as therapeutic approaches [172].

The receptor for nicotinic acid (niacin), an old lipid-lowering drug, has been identified. The G-protein-coupled receptor “protein up-regulated in macrophages by interferon” (mouse PUMA-G, human HM74a) also named GPR109a and GPR109b, which is highly expressed in AT, is the nicotinic acid receptor that mediates the antilipolytic and lipid-lowering effect of nicotinic acid *in vivo* [173–175]. The ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate is an agonist for GPR109a and binds to the same site as niacin [176]. It specifically activates GPR109a at concentrations observed in serum during fasting. Like nicotinic acid, beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits lipolysis in mouse adipocytes in a GPR109a-dependent manner. It is the first endogenous physiological ligand proposed for this receptor. If supported by assays on human fat cells and further clinical studies, these findings suggest a homeostatic mechanism for surviving starvation in which beta-hydroxybutyrate negatively regulates its own production, thereby preventing ketoacidosis and promoting optimal use of fat stores. GPR81, a Gi-coupled receptor that is highly homologous to the niacin receptors GPR109a and GPR109b is expressed in human and rodent adipocytes. In its physiological concentration range (1–20 mM), L-lactate inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes from humans, mice and rats [177,178]. GPR81 is another Gi-coupled receptor with high expression in AT. Extracellular succinate at concentrations in the range of plasma levels also activates this receptor and thereby inhibits lipolysis [179]. These receptors could play a key role in regulating appropriate lipid
mobilization and utilization of energy stores under various physiological circumstances. GPR109a, via beta-hydroxybutyrate stimulation will play a role in survival of starvation by preserving fat stores while GPR81 will be recruited during conditions of high energy expenditure leading to lactate production and putative oxygen deficit. Activation of GPR81 might be operative during physical exercise and metabolic acidosis, two conditions known to increase succinate concentrations. Finally, GPR43 in rodent adipocytes leads to inhibition of lipolysis and lowering of plasma FA concentrations [180]. GPR43, which belongs to a subfamily of related GPCRs, including GPR40 and GPR41 that have been identified as receptors with specificity for FA. Short-chain FA activate GPR41 and GPR43 while medium chain FA activate GPR40 [181].

There are only two peptides that possess well-established antilipolytic actions in rodent and human fat cells: neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY). NPY/PYY-receptor stimulation, via Gi-protein coupling, inhibits adenyl cyclase activity, cAMP production and lipolysis [182–184]. The human fat cell NPY receptor is a NPY-Y₁ receptor subtype. Differences exist in human NPY/PYY receptor distribution according to the anatomical location of AT; the highest level of expression being found in subcutaneous adipocytes [185]. Secretion of NPY by neurons is dramatically upregulated by the presence of adipocytes in co-culture and appears to be mediated by an adipocyte-derived soluble factor [184]. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inactivates the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (i.e., incretins are intestinal hormones that are released in response to ingestion of nutrients, especially carbohydrate) and can also hydrolyze NPY (1-36) which is truncated to NPY (3-36) and as a consequence, the affinity for the NPY-Y₁ receptor is decreased. DPP-IV inhibitors augment the antilipolytic effect of NPY in human AT [186]. Studies in mice submitted to chronic stress revealed that nerve-released NPY may constitute a link between angiogenesis and adipogenesis. In vivo, implanted pellets with slow-release of NPY increased fat pad weight [187]. The physiological relevance of this NPY-dependent pathway and its relevance in human diseases remain unclear. Further studies are required to show whether the impact of DPP-IV inhibitors on NPY effects in AT could explain the lack of weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients treated with these drugs.

Adenosine and prostaglandins are probably metabolized very rapidly in vitro as well as in vivo [188,189]. Nevertheless, substantial amounts of adenosine are found in the interstitial fluid of AT [190]. Binding of adenosine to a small fraction of the large population of adipocyte A₁-adenosine receptors is sufficient to cause a decrease in the cAMP content in fat cells [191]. In the case of prostaglandins, PGE₂ was found to be higher in AT of obese humans compared with normal weight controls [192]. A recent study revealed the physiological relevance of endogenously produced prostaglandin E₂ in mouse AT. Stimulation of lipolysis releases arachidonate being available for PGE₂ synthesis. An adipocyte phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂) named AdPLA has been identified in mice and human adipocytes [193]. PGE₂ is present at levels of one or two orders of magnitude higher than those of other prostaglandins in mouse AT. AdPLA ablation increases lipolysis and the mice have reduced PGE₂ levels in their AT. Moreover, obesity induced by high-fat feeding is prevented after AdPLA ablation. This study showed that the suppression of lipolysis by the local PGE₂ produced by adipocytes was crucial in regulating adipocyte lipolysis and revealed an unsuspected role for the AdPLA-PGE₂-EP₃ receptor-cAMP signalling pathway in the control of lipolysis and TAG storage [194].

The data with a vast array of ligands initiating antilipolytic effects show that endogenous inhibitory agents may have a more important role in the regulation of TAG hydrolysis than previously suspected. The putative regulatory steps may involve several mechanistic steps (i.e., enzymes involved in ligand production

and degradation), plasma membrane Gi-coupled receptor expression and regulation and downstream pathways. Giα₂ is a major transducer of the inhibitory response in AT and it has been shown that it provides tonic suppression of basal adenyl cyclase activity in vitro and in vivo [195]. If unrestrained, fat cell adenyl cyclase proceeds at increased rates. It is suggested that a certain degree of inhibition might be necessary for fat cell adenyl cyclase to be susceptible to stimulation. Under in vivo conditions, in the presence of the endogenous ligands, Gi-dependent inhibitory pathways may be under sustained and permanent inhibition since the inhibitory pathways driven by prostaglandins, catecholamines, and adenosine are always activated at low concentrations of the agents [168,196]. Convincing demonstrations that such mechanisms operate in human AT in vivo are still missing.

### 4.2. Natriuretic peptide pathway

A new hormonal lipolytic pathway has been discovered in human fat cells [197]. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) stimulate human fat cell lipolysis as much as isoproterenol while C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) exerted weak effects. The rank order of potency for the stimulation of lipolysis (ANP > BNP > CNP) and the existence of an ANP-induced cyclic GMP production suggested the presence of a functional type A natriuretic peptide receptor in human fat cells. Expression of ANP receptor mRNAs and binding studies have confirmed the presence of types A and C ANP-receptors (NPR-A and NPR-C) [197] (Fig. 4). Real-time PCR revealed that large adipocytes expressed higher mRNA levels of natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A and HSL, and binding studies showed that large adipocytes expressed more NPR-A on their membranes per cell than small adipocytes [198]. Cyclic GMP-dependent activation of protein kinase G and phosphorylation of HSL occur after ANP stimulation in human adipocytes [44]. In vitro studies have previously shown that HSL could be phosphorylated by cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase [199]. Neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase 24.11, CD10, NEP), which is involved in natriuretic peptide degradation, has been identified in the human fat cell membrane. Moreover, a low level of expression and activity of type 5A phosphodiesterase, involved in cGMP hydrolysis, has been reported in isolated human fat cells [200]. In situ microdialysis experiments have confirmed the potent lipolytic effect of ANP in abdominal subcutaneous AT of healthy subjects and intravenous administration of ANP causes a striking increase in plasma NEFA and glycerol levels in normal and obese subjects [201–203].

### 4.3. Tyrosine-kinase receptors and signalling pathways

A critical point in the understanding of AT lipolysis is the potent antilipolytic effect of insulin. Failure to suppress NEFA in response to the ingestion of a meal and the subsequent rise in insulinemia leads to abnormal elevations of plasma NEFA. The resistance of adipocytes to the antilipolytic effect of insulin is an important element of AT biology which could be at the origin of the metabolic risks. The mechanisms of insulin action and insulin resistance have been extensively studied in rodent and human fat cells and will be briefly summarized. In human adipocytes, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) inhibit fat cell glycerol release and stimulate adipocyte 3-O-methylglucose transport and AT glucose oxidation as effectively as insulin, but the biological potencies of the IGFs, on a molar basis, are 600–1000 times less than that of insulin [204]. Insulin and IGF-1 receptors are prototypic members of the family of tyrosine-kinase receptors that are characterized by an extracellular binding domain, a single transmembrane portion and a large intracellular catalytic domain. In parallel with their control of glucose uptake by fat cells, insulin and IGF-1 control

cyclic AMP levels and lipolysis through the activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B). The importance of PDE3B in the regulation of lipolysis and of insulin-induced antilipolysis was confirmed in PDE3B-null mice [205]. Insulin activates PDE3B and initiates PDE3B-dependent degradation of cyclic AMP to 5′AMP, a decrease in cyclic AMP, inactivation of PKA and reduced phosphorylation of HSL and perilipins, thus inhibiting lipolysis. Insulin and IGF-1 tyrosine-kinase receptors are coupled to phosphatidylinositol kinase-3 (PI3-K). PI3-K is a heterodimer composed of two subunits: a p85alpha regulatory subunit, which contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and one Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, as well as the p110 catalytic subunit. PI3-K possesses both lipid-kinase and serine-kinase activities. The activation cascade leading to PDE3B activation is rather complex and some points remain unclear. When insulin binds to its receptor, the receptor is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which causes tyrosine phosphorylation on intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrate I and II and binding of the p85alpha subunit of PI3-K. This binding activates the lipid-kinase, which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol at the D-3 position of the inositol ring. In addition, PI3-K serine kinase autophosphorylates both the p85alpha regulatory subunit and the p110 catalytic subunit. This step is followed by PKB/Akt phosphorylation/activation, PDE3B activation and cyclic AMP breakdown [206]. Studies in human adipocytes have shown that PDE3B is associated with the insulin receptor; its association does not appear to be regulated by insulin. Insulin increases binding of the PI3-K-serine kinase associated with the insulin receptor, leading to an increased phosphorylation and activation of PDE3B [207]. Cyclic AMP-mediated pathways may either oppose or facilitate the actions of insulin and/or growth factors that signal via receptor tyrosine kinases [208]. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a major negative regulator of insulin and leptin sensitivity. PTP1B overexpression in AT and skeletal muscle of humans and rodents may contribute to insulin resistance and obesity. Moreover, PTP1B appears to be a critical point for insulin and catecholamine counter-regulation [209] and PTP1B overexpression in multiple tissues in obesity appears to be regulated by inflammation [210]. Overexpression of PTP1B protein has been observed in insulin-resistant states associated with obesity. Mice lacking a functional PTP1B gene exhibit increased insulin sensitivity and are resistant to weight gain. Studies in rodents have provided a link between Gi protein-mediated pathways and PTP1B expression. Suppression of the expression of Gi₂ in vivo has been shown to provoke insulin resistance, whereas enhanced insulin signalling is observed when Gi₂ is overexpressed in vivo. Elevation of intracellular cAMP in fat cells is shown to increase PTP1B activity, whereas either depression of cAMP levels or direct activation of Gi₂ suppresses PTP1B. Activation of Gi₂ can suppress both the expression and activity of PTP1B in insulin-sensitive tissues [211].

### 4.4. Other lipolytic pathways

#### 4.4.1. Growth hormone

The effect of GH on fuel metabolism includes direct stimulation of lipolysis and protein synthesis and indirect inhibition of proteolysis via insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1). Exposure to GH leads to increased plasma NEFA, ketone bodies, IGF-1, insulin and glucose. Whether GH promotes IGF-I production or lipolysis depends on nutritional status. Fasting and stress contribute to GH secretion while food intake inhibits GH release. The combination of fasting and GH exposure translates into enhanced lipolysis, reduced IGF-I activity and insulin sensitivity, and blunted activation of the Janus kinase JAK/STAT pathway [212]. In vitro studies have shown that GH stimulates lipolysis in human adipocytes [213]; the effect is delayed (2–3 h) when compared with that of catecholamines and the exact mechanism of action is not fully established. The transducing pathways are suspected to involve those used by catecholamines (cAMP- and PKA-dependent pathways). GH-dependent modifications of the interactions between adenylyl cyclase and Giα₂ have
been reported. Consequently, the GH-related relief of Gi-dependent inhibition of cAMP production increases lipolysis [214,215]. The physiological contribution of GH to the control of human AT lipid mobilization has remained elusive and is not yet entirely clear. GH defects in humans are associated with reduced lean body mass and increased fat mass which can both be normalized by GH treatments [212,216]. GH deficient-patients have reduced lipolysis and plasma NEFA concentrations [217]. Pulsatile and continuous GH administration, leading to plasma concentration rises like those seen during exercise in humans, promote a significant increase in NEFA after 2–3 h [218,219]. Moreover, the normal nocturnal rise in plasma GH concentrations also leads to site-specific regulation of lipolysis in AT [220]. GH-dependent stimulation of lipolysis probably represents a physiological adaptation to stress (maintenance of basal lipolysis during fasting and exercise). The exercise-induced increase in GH secretion plays a role in the post-exercise lipolysis in s.c. abdominal AT [221]. GH and cortisol are co-secreted during stress conditions and it is probable that both hormones are involved in the regulation of AT metabolism during fasting and stress. Acute lipolytic effects of cortisol have been reported [222,223]. GH and cortisol stimulate systemic and regional lipolysis independently and in an additive manner when co-administered [224,225]. Of putative pharmacological interest, a small synthetic peptide sequence of human GH (AOD-9041) has been shown to increase human and rodent fat cell lipolysis in vitro. Its efficiency on lipid mobilization has been observed after chronic oral administration in rodents though the mechanism of action remains to be clarified [226]. In conclusion, although it possesses some delayed lipid mobilizing properties when compared with fast-acting lipolytic agents, GH (which varies in plasma concentrations between 1 and 30 μg/l) can be considered as a weaker regulator of lipolysis than catecholamines and insulin.

### 4.4.2. Interleukin 6

Subcutaneous AT was shown to secrete large amounts of IL-6 and this secretion was correlated with the body mass index of the subjects [227]. Circulating IL-6 levels might reflect, at least in part, AT IL-6 production [228] although it is also secreted by the exercising muscle [229]. It was proposed that locally secreted IL-6 could act on adipocytes by a paracrine/autocrine mechanism. Human adipocytes express both IL-6 and its receptor system consisting of the IL-6 receptor and the signal transducing protein gp130 [230]. IL-6 stimulates lipolysis in human adipocytes and exerts anti-insulin actions [231]. It was found that IL-6-treated adipocytes have reduced insulin-stimulated lipogenesis and glucose transport and fail to maintain their adipocyte phenotype (e.g. down-regulation of various adipogenic markers). Likewise, expression of the insulin receptor-β (IR-β and IRS-1 is reduced as is insulin-induced activation of IR-β, Akt/PKB and ERK1/2. Expression of a suppressor of cytokine signalling-3 (SOCS-3), a potential inhibitor of insulin signalling is also induced by IL-6 [232,233]. Recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) infusion, leading to plasma IL-6 concentrations of about 140 pg/ml in healthy volunteers, resulted in an increase in plasma NEFA and glycerol concentrations and an increased rate of appearance of NEFAs and glycerol measured by isotope dilution techniques [234]. Plasma cortisol concentrations were increased by 50%, and transient changes in adrenaline were also observed during IL-6 infusion, while putative concomitant changes in GH levels were not determined. It may be premature to include IL-6 in a physiological loop of the regulation of lipolytic processes [235].

### 4.4.3. Tumor necrosis factor-α

TNFα is released in AT by macrophages and to a lower extent by fat cells. The interest of TNFα as a regulator of lipid storage in AT originates from cachexia disorders. TNFα prevents the normal development of preadipocytes to fully differentiated adipose cells and, instead, promotes an inflammatory phenotype of the adipocytes [236]. TNFα was initially found to exert potent effects on intracellular TAG levels in 3T3-L1 cells [237]. Stimulation of lipolysis by TNFα is not direct, since it only becomes apparent after long-lasting exposure of human and rodent adipocytes to the cytokine [238]. Multiple impacts of TNFα on fat cells have been identified [239]. TNFα pathways interact with lipase expression, perilipin expression and phosphorylation, insulin effects and Gi-dependent inhibitory signalling pathways. TNFα-induced lipolysis, as well as inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, is predominantly mediated by TNFR-1 [240,241]. Three MAP kinases (p44/42, Jun kinase (JNK) and p38) are activated by TNFα in fat cells [242]. TNF-α-induced lipolysis is mediated by only p44/42 and Jun Kinase but not by p38 [243]. In fat cells, TNFα reduces the effect of insulin via inactivation of IRS-1 which is mediated through TNFα-induced p42-44 MAP kinase activation [244]. TNFα decreases the expression of PDE3B in human fat cells [245] and regulates lipolysis via perilipin phosphorylation but also by decreasing the protein levels at the lipid droplet surface [239,245,246]. The effect of TNFα on perilipin phosphorylation is probably indirect and mediated by the decreased expression of PDE3B and concomitant increase in cAMP and PKA activation leading to perilipin phosphorylation. Blunting the endogenous inhibition of lipolysis controlled by endogenous ligands (i.e., adenosine, prostaglandin E and NPY) is another possible mechanism. Modulation of antilipolytic pathways could explain part of the lipolytic effect of TNFα in rodent fat cells: it decreases the protein content of all three Gαi subtypes without affecting Gs and G-protein beta-subunits [247,248]. TNFα inhibits the expression of HSL and ATGL mRNA levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [146,147]. This observation could be related to a dedifferentiation process whose may occur after the phase in which TNFα stimulates lipolysis. Administration of a low dose of recombinant human TNFα to humans increased palmitate turnover but did not affect NEFA metabolism in skeletal muscle. This increase in palmitate turnover was promoted without significant changes in adrenaline and noradrenaline and with a modest rise in IL-6. This result suggests that in conditions associated with low grade inflammation, TNFα could play a mechanistic role in mediating lipolysis and dyslipemia [249].

#### 4.4.4. Miscellaneous agents

Nitric oxide (NO) or related redox species like NO⁺/NO⁻ have been proposed as potential regulators of lipolysis in rodent and human fat cells [250,251]. In rodents, leptin has been shown in vitro to reduce the expression of lipogenic enzymes in preadipocytes and to increase glycerol release from mature adipocytes [252]. Leptin causes concentration-dependent stimulation of lipolysis in rat fat cells and had no effect on fat cells of the fa/fa rat that has a defective leptin Ob-R_L receptor. Apparently, the lipolytic effect of leptin occurs at the adenylyl cyclase/Gi protein level and leptin-induced lipolysis opposes the tonic inhibition of endogenous adenosine in white adipocytes [252,253]. Nevertheless, leptin (within a concentration range from 25 to 250 ng/ml) has no direct lipolytic effect on human adipocytes either in children or adults [254].

The factors that cause loss of fat mass which may precede muscle wasting in cachexia are poorly understood. Adipocyte lipolysis is increased in cancer cachexia most probably because of enhanced expression and function of adipocyte HSL [255]. However, a number of experiments have reported the production of a lipid-mobilizing factor (LMF) by cachexia-inducing tumors. This factor, when incubated with murine adipocytes, promotes stimulation of lipolysis associated with an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP levels [256]. LMF has not yet been characterized but its activity was shown to be attenuated by eicosapentaenoic acid [256]. The serum and urine of cachectic cancer patients contain LMF, the
activity of which correlated with the extent of weight loss [257]. Zinc-α₂-glycoprotein (ZAG), a soluble protein that is present in serum and other body fluids, stimulates lipid degradation in adipocytes and causes the extensive fat losses associated with some advanced cancers. ZAG is a 43-kDa protein that acts as a lipid-mobilizing factor that stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes; it leads to cachexia in mice implanted with ZAG-producing tumors. ZAG was detected in mouse and human fat depots. Overexpression in AT of tumor-bearing mice suggests a local role for adipocyte-derived ZAG in the substantial reduction in the adiposity of cancer cachexia [258]. Its physiological role remains to be established to clarify the influence of cachexia mediators in AT atrophy [259,260].

### 5. Physiological regulation of lipolysis in human AT

In normal subjects, regulation of lipolysis in response to feeding, fasting and physical exercise is controlled by lipase expression/activity and the interactions between several regulators discussed above, principally plasma insulin and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) modulation [27,261]. The newly-discovered contribution of natriuretic peptides has been reviewed recently [262]. The contribution of autocrine and paracrine factors in the in vivo regulation of lipolysis in human AT remains the least investigated and understood area.

#### 5.1. Body fat distribution

Body fat distribution differs between normal weight men and women. A peripheral distribution is usually found in women while a more central one is described in men. Human AT displays significant regional differences in preadipocyte capacities for replication and differentiation, adipocyte size, basal metabolic activities and hormonal responsiveness [263–265]. These differences appear to contribute to regional fat deposition. Conversely, body fat distribution is an important factor explaining NEFA metabolism and FA-associated insulin resistance [30]. Adipose site-related differences in the regulation of lipolysis have been shown in vitro and in vivo [168,266–270]. In normal weight and overweight adults, visceral AT is more responsive to a lipolytic challenge on a percent unit weight basis than subcutaneous fat [270]. However, NEFAs released by visceral fat weakly contribute to systemic NEFA concentrations. Abdominal subcutaneous AT is the major determinant of systemic NEFA concentrations [270–272]. In situ measurements of glycerol release from AT have provided further evidence that regional heterogeneity of lipolysis occurs in humans [268]. The mechanisms explaining the regional differences have been investigated in vitro [18,273–275]. The lipolytic response of isolated fat cells to catecholamines is weaker in the subcutaneous gluteal/femoral than in the subcutaneous abdominal and visceral AT in normal weight subjects. Omental adipocytes display greater relative responsiveness to both adrenergic receptor- and postreceptor-acting agents compared with subcutaneous adipocytes [276]. In upper-body obesity, the regional variations in lipolysis between visceral and subcutaneous fat cells appear less important than in normal weight subjects [277]. An enhanced alpha₂-adrenergic responsiveness associated with a concomitant decrease in beta-adrenergic responsiveness explains the lower lipolytic effect of catecholamines in gluteal/femoral fat cells of women and men. Conversely, visceral fat adipocytes show the highest lipolytic responsiveness to catecholamines. In vitro studies have shown that concomitant variations in beta₂- and alpha₂-adrenergic sensitivity in adipocytes may be predictive of weight loss during dieting or very low-calorie diets [278,279]. Site-related differences are also found in the antilipolytic action of insulin, while those concerning prostaglandins and adenosine require further investigation. In vitro studies have demonstrated

that regional differences exist in the antilipolytic effects of insulin. Omental adipocytes are less sensitive to the antilipolytic effect of insulin than abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes [280] and although this has been confirmed by other investigators, some discrepancies exist [281]. The regional heterogeneity of insulin-regulated NEFA release has been confirmed in in vivo studies. Visceral AT lipolysis is more resistant to insulin suppression than is leg AT lipolysis in humans [282]. Tissue-specific investigations, using in situ microdialysis [22], need to be extended to delineate the physiological relevance of previous studies on insulin and to determine the effects of other antilipolytic agents.

The higher lipolytic capacity of omental adipocytes may be related to the level of expression of lipases with HSL, but not ATGL mRNA expression being higher in omental than subcutaneous AT [283]. However, fat cell size is also an important determinant that influences lipase expression and modifies the differences between fat depots [284].

#### 5.2. Fasting and calorie restriction

During short-term fasting, an enhancement of AT responsiveness to catecholamine-induced lipolysis and a decrease in insulin-stimulated antilipolysis are observed. During very-low-calorie and low-calorie diets, lipolysis is also enhanced in obese subjects with a stimulation of both catecholamine and ANP-induced lipid mobilization [202]. An increase in HSL expression in the subcutaneous AT of obese women occurs [285]. This physiological adaptation is important to optimize mobilization of FA during this type of calorie restriction. In two independent weight reduction programs combining hypocaloric diet followed by stabilization at the new weight, the level of HSL after weight stabilization was lower than before the program [286,287]. Weight reduction also significantly decreased ATGL mRNA and protein expression [148]. These data show that variations in AT lipolysis and lipase expression differ between the hypocaloric and isocaloric phases of weight reduction programs.

#### 5.3. Physical exercise

Physical exercise represents, with fasting, the main physiological situation of increased lipolysis. Sustained exercise of moderate intensity is characterized by a marked increase in lipolysis [288]. Women have a higher percentage of body fat than men and lipolysis and the proportion of energy derived from fat during exercise is higher in women than in men [289,290]. The impact of exercise upon lipid metabolism persists into recovery, although women depend more on lipid during exercise, during recovery, lipid metabolism is accentuated to a greater extent in men [291]. Aerobic physical training in obese male subjects, although having no noticeable incidence on weight loss, modifies AT lipolysis through an enhancement of beta-adrenergic responses and a concomitant blunting of adipocyte antilipolytic activity [292–294]. Adrenaline-and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolytic responses in vitro are higher in fat cells from trained compared with sedentary women, whereas alpha₂-adrenergic responses are lower. Maximal lipolysis initiated by agents acting at post-receptor level is also higher [295]. Microdialysis studies have revealed a higher exercise-induced lipolysis in trained compared with untrained subjects; beta-adrenergic response is largely responsible for this effect since the alpha₂-adrenergic receptor-mediated antilipolytic action is not involved in the regulation of lipolysis in subcutaneous abdominal AT of the trained subjects during exercise [296]. An alpha₂-AR-dependent antilipolytic effect was revealed in the subcutaneous AT of obese men performing exercise [297]. Endurance training improves beta-adrenergic receptor- as well as ANP-mediated lipid mobilization and AT blood flow in the subcutaneous AT of overweight subjects

[298]. The lipolytic response to exercise is partly blocked by beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Therefore, the exercise-induced lipid mobilization resistant to beta-AR blockers has been attributed to atrial natriuretic peptides released by the heart during exercise [262,299]. During low-to-moderate exercise periods (30% and 50% VO₂ max), lipid mobilization in abdominal subcutaneous AT relies less on catecholamine-dependent stimulation of beta-ARs than on an increase in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and the decrease in plasma insulin [290] (Figs. 5 and 6). Delineation of the relative contribution of the various lipolytic and antilipolytic factors involved in exercise-induced lipid mobilization remains complex. In a recent study, blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors during exercise performed during infusion of octreotide (a somatostatin analogue blocking insulin and GH release but also the exercise-induced rise in epinephrine but not that of norepinephrine) does not alter the exercise-induced lipolysis. This suggests that epinephrine is the main adrenergic agent contributing to exercise-induced lipolysis in subcutaneous AT. Moreover, it is the combined action of insulin suppression and NPs release which explains the lipolytic response which remains under octreotide after full local blockade of fat cell adrenergic receptors [300].

### 5.4. Ageing

Ageing is associated with a diminished ability to mobilize FA and to use fat as a fuel (decreased skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake and oxidation) during beta-AR stimulation [301]. There is a selective decrease in the beta-adrenergic lipolytic capacity with ageing that may be caused by disturbances at the adrenergic receptor level or at the post-receptor level. Lipolytic resistance to catecholamines is present *in vivo* in apparently healthy subjects due to reduced expression of beta₂-ARs in adipocytes [273]. These alterations are independent from the age-expected increase in total adiposity [302]. The impairment in SNS-mediated lipolysis and fat oxidation may be of importance in the age-related increase in adiposity and obesity.

#### 5.5. Stress

In diverse stressful conditions such as surgery, trauma, severe burns and mental stress, most of the studies have described increases in lipolysis that could be activated to an inappropriate level and lead to excess levels of plasma NEFA. Activation of lipolysis is due to an increased SNS drive and the secretion of stress hormones that both facilitate lipid mobilization and reduce insulin secretion [27,303]. The lipolytic activity in human AT is markedly promoted during mental stress, owing to adrenergic mechanisms that are mediated via beta-ARs [304] and is enhanced by underfeeding [305]. Sustained changes in SNS activity or plasma catecholamine levels have commonly been associated with altered beta-adrenergic function in target cells leading to desensitisation. Desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated lipolysis to catecholamines exposure has been extensively studied *in vitro* [149]. Repeated adrenaline treatment has been shown to suppress basal and adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis in lean and obese subjects. The plasma insulin concentration increased after repeated adrenaline treatment and could contribute to the loss of adrenaline efficacy [306]. The *in vivo* lipolytic response of the AT to adrenaline is desensitized by prior acute exposure to adrenaline [307].

Comparative study of exercise-induced lipid mobilization in SCAT of lean and obese men. Time-course of extracellular glycerol concentration changes in SCAT, calculated from dialysate glycerol levels, during a 60 min cycle-ergometer exercise in lean (A) and obese (B) men. The non-selective alpha₁/alpha₂-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phentolamine, was or was not added to the perfusion medium of the microdialysis probe. Data are means ± SEM from 7 to 10 separate experiments. Physiological stimulation of adipocyte alpha₂-adrenergic receptors strongly impairs exercise-induced lipid mobilization in SCAT in obese subjects. The blunting of lipid mobilization induced by exercise-induced noradrenaline/adrenaline release is completely suppressed by the local administration of a alpha₁/alpha₂-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Plasma levels of catecholamines are given at rest (R) and at the end of exercise (E). Adrenaline is suspected to be an important regulator in the control of lipid mobilization through activation of antilipolytic alpha₂-adrenergic receptors in human SCAT during exercise (from Ref. [297], with permission of the American Physiological Society).

ever, no cardiovascular desensitization was observed in these conditions. Acute aerobic exercise, which increases adrenergic activity, also induces desensitization in beta₁- and beta₂-adrenergic lipolytic pathways in human subcutaneous adipose tissue [308]. It remains to establish if this phenomenon is related to noticeable beta-AR desensitization, to the appearance of altered expression/function in intracellular signalling molecules or to change in the balance between beta- and alpha₂-adrenergic receptor-dependent effects or to an increase in plasma insulin.

6. Dysregulation of lipolysis in obesity

Plasma NEFA concentrations are commonly increased in the obese state suggesting dysregulation of lipolysis or NEFA uptake by fat cells. The two important abnormalities of lipolysis which could play a role in the development of obesity include decreased plasma delivery from AT lipolysis in fasting and exercising conditions and altered suppression of NEFA in response to insulin after a meal. To date, it is not clearly established if NEFA reesterification is altered in obesity. Approximately 50% of newly hydrolyzed NEFA are reesterified in subcutaneous AT of weight-stable obese individuals [309]. The release of NEFA is also controlled by the AT blood flow (ATBF) which is under paracrine, endocrine and neural control [310]. Changes in ATBF contribute to TAG clearance and facilitate the removal of NEFA and glycerol produced during lipolysis. Failure to regulate ATBF may therefore be a feature of obesity and insulin resistance [311].

It is known that circulating NEFA levels are increased in obese subjects and that an *in vivo* increase in the overall rate of lipolysis exists during fasting in obesity. Interpretations of these results are more complex since when the fat mass is taken in account the increase is not observed [27,272]. Microdialysis studies performed after an overnight fast in obese subjects have revealed that the lipolytic rate per tissue weight was normal in obesity [312]. The basal rate of lipolysis *in vitro* is increased in enlarged fat cells of most obese subjects whatever the AT location. The differences existing in the basal rate of lipolysis *in vitro* between lean and obese subjects disappear when fat cell size is taken into account [276]. The mass effect due to the enlargement of fat deposits in the body might explain the increased overall rates of lipolysis *in vivo* and probably explains the origin of the increased plasma NEFA levels commonly found in obese subjects.

6.1. Alterations in lipase action

A defect in HSL expression linked to an impaired lipolytic capacity is observed in subcutaneous adipocytes of obese subjects [121,283,313]. The decrease in HSL expression is also observed in insulin-resistant and type 2 diabetic subjects [148,314] and the maximum lipolytic capacity of adipocytes and HSL expression are

lower in subjects with obese relatives [315]. This result suggests a defect in fat cell lipolysis caused by an impaired expression of HSL in normal weight subjects with a family history of obesity. Moreover, preadipocytes from obese and lean individuals differentiated *in vitro* also show defects in lipolysis and HSL expression [145]. Impaired lipolysis could therefore constitute an early event in the development of obesity. Moreover, AT ATGL mRNA levels were found to be unaffected in obesity [121, 274]. In another study, ATGL protein expression and TAG hydrolase activity were reduced in subcutaneous AT of obese subjects despite increased mRNA levels [316]. A potential explanation of the discrepancy between reports is that ATGL expression is altered by insulin resistance and not by obesity *per se* [148, 283]. A striking reduction of hormone-induced lipolysis has been reported in the adipocytes of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome who are prone to visceral obesity and have an increased risk of diabetes [317]. Different steps of the lipolytic cascade are altered [318, 319]. In adipocytes from women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, reduction of noradrenaline-induced lipolysis was positively correlated with HSL protein levels but not with ATGL protein; HSL protein levels are reduced while ATGL expression is unaffected [127].

### 6.2. Catecholamine action

It is commonly accepted that the action of catecholamines on human fat cells is impaired in obesity. This defect might be an early event since it has been observed in obese adolescents [320, 321]. *In vitro*, reduced beta₂-adrenergic lipolytic responsiveness has been reported in subcutaneous fat cells from obese subjects [322] or subjects with reduced isoprenaline sensitivity [273]. Little is known about the differential role played by the different PKA regulatory subunits in humans. Changes occurring in R2-beta and R1-alpha subunits expression could modify sensitivity of PKA to cAMP activation and its activity [323]. Stimulated PKA activity and expression of the R2B regulatory isoform are reduced in the visceral and omental adipocytes in the obese, a mechanism which contributes to a reduced beta-adrenergic response [324]. In addition, an increased antilipolytic responsiveness linked to alpha₂-adrenergic receptor stimulation has also been found in subcutaneous adipocytes of obese subjects of both sexes [325]. Conversely, in visceral fat, catecholamine action is increased owing to an increased beta-adrenergic responsiveness and decreased alpha₂-adrenoceptor function [326]. A number of *in vivo* studies have shown blunted catecholamine-induced lipolysis in the subcutaneous AT of obese subjects [327, 328]. Crude fat cell plasma membranes from obese patients were less responsive to isoproterenol than those from normal-weight subjects [329]. Unresponsiveness of the subcutaneous AT to neurally stimulated lipolysis has been described [330]. Using *in situ* microdialysis, a specific impairment in the capacity of beta₂-adrenergic receptor-agonists to promote lipolysis has been reported in the subcutaneous abdominal AT of obese adolescent girls [321]. These data support the notion that a defect in lipolysis could be an early event. However, with the i.v. administration of selective beta₁- and beta₂-adrenergic receptor-agonists, the lipolytic and nutritive blood flow response to beta-adrenergic stimulation *in situ* was comparable in lean and obese male subjects in a study [331] while in vivo beta-adrenergically mediated lipolytic response was found to be systematically impaired and in abdominal subcutaneous AT of obese versus lean men [332]. In conclusion, it is suspected that a dysfunction of the beta₂-adrenergic pathway or of the beta₂-adrenergic receptor density may play a role in the etiology or maintenance of a relatively increased fat mass and consequently obesity. A lipolytic defect associated with reduced NEFA availability, may be the cause of an impairment of responses in energy expenditure and lipid oxidation during beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation [333].

Hereditary influences have repeatedly been reported in the control of catecholamine-induced lipolysis [285, 334–336]. Beta-adrenergic receptors are candidate genes for obesity because of their role in catecholamine-induced lipolysis and energy homeostasis. This question will not be reviewed in detail here. Polymorphisms in the beta₁-, beta₂-AR and beta₃-adrenergic receptors could influence adipocyte lipolysis and have an incidence on the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders [337, 338]. Common SNPs in adrenergic receptor genes may be important susceptibility loci for obesity and related alterations [336, 339]. Results obtained with populations of limited size should be replicated in larger populations to validate some studies. Polymorphisms in the beta₁-, beta₂- and beta₃-ARs could influence adipocyte lipolysis and thus have a role in the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders.

The physiological stimulation of adipocyte alpha₂-adrenergic receptors during exercise-induced SNS activation contributes to the reduced lipolysis observed in the subcutaneous AT of obese men [297] (Fig. 6). The alpha₂-adrenergic effect is weaker in the subcutaneous AT of obese women [340]. In hypertrophic human fat cells which express a high level of alpha₂-adrenergic receptors, any reduction of the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated lipolytic response will disturb the functional balance between alpha₂- and beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated effects and amplify the reduction of the lipolytic response initiated by the physiological amines. Alpha₂-adrenergic receptors in the subcutaneous AT of obese subjects may have important physiopathological implications in men developing large subcutaneous fat deposits and in women with excessive hip and femoral fat deposits. Reduced AT lipolytic sensitivity to catecholamines occurring in subcutaneous AT deposits probably represents an adaptive process of the hypertrophied adipocyte. The increase in alpha₂-adrenergic receptors and alpha₂-adrenergic activity has beneficial effects by limiting excessive rates of lipolysis and NEFA release into the systemic circulation. Such a regulation could represent a valuable adaptive process to adjust lipolytic responsiveness to catecholamines to fat accumulation.

#### 6.3. Other lipolytic and antilipolytic pathways

In addition to catecholamines, the lipolytic effect of atrial natriuretic peptides is reduced in the subcutaneous AT of obese patients [298]. The most striking abnormality in NEFA metabolism is the failure to suppress normal fatty acid concentrations/AT lipolysis in response to postprandial hyperinsulinemia in obesity [30, 341, 342]. Impaired insulin signal transduction has been reported in some obese subjects, but not all. Low IRS-1 content has been observed in some insulin resistant subjects [343]. When performing studies on fat cells, it is unclear if the antilipolytic effect of insulin is altered in the obese state [18, 275, 344]. In fact, the antilipolytic effect of insulin is difficult to study since insulin-induced antilipolysis is always measured against isoproterenol- or catecholamine-induced lipolysis, the effects of which could also vary in the obese state. Heterogeneous results, probably partly related to this problem, have been reported (i.e., normal, decreased or increased) antilipolytic activities among the obese. Modifications of other antilipolytic mechanisms may also be involved in the adipocyte of obese subjects. Decreased antilipolytic actions of prostaglandins and adenosine have been reported in the subcutaneous fat cells of obese subjects *in vitro* [170, 171].

### 7. Conclusions and future trends

The last decade has been marked by the discovery of a number of mechanisms able to clarify the control of fat storage and lipid mobilization though some results obtained in rodent models still require validation in humans. Lipases and lipolytic and antilipolytic receptor

dysfunction may play a noticeable role in the development of obesity complications. Future studies must be devoted to the delineation of the defects affecting genes encoding the various elements of the transduction pathways and the enzymes involved in the regulation of lipolysis as well as the lipolytic and antilipolytic mechanisms.

The impact of altered sympathetic nervous system on its target cells could lead to the development of obesity [11]. The reduced efficiency of beta-adrenergic receptor-dependent lipolysis and/or enhanced alpha₂-AR-mediated antilipolysis could both impair lipolysis and lead to catecholamine-resistance and promote the development and/or stabilization of obesity. In addition, loss of efficiency of the ANP-dependent lipolytic pathway could also be another element that could explain altered lipid mobilization [262]. The reduced lipolysis commonly reported in the subcutaneous AT of obese subjects could also be viewed as an adaptive mechanism limiting an excess rate of lipolysis. This could lead to a protection against lipotoxicity. Environmental factors such as sedentary life-style may worsen a hereditary defect affecting beta-AR-dependent lipolysis while physical exercise may counterbalance such a defect. There is no doubt that studies of the interactions between genetic factors and environmental conditions will be of great interest to explain why energy storage differs so widely, even in obese patients.

Knowledge of lipolytic pathways has fostered the identification of new targets for lipolysis modulators [345]. Apparently modest clinical results of beta₃-AR agonists do not stimulate drug discovery efforts. Since the rationale was largely based on findings in rodent models, and given the large differences in beta₃-AR agonism between human and rodents, the potential of these molecules as drugs is debatable and remains to be further validated in clinic. Since HSL and the newly identified ATGL are involved in TAG hydrolysis, selective inhibitors targeting this step are likely promising drugs [172]. Drug discovery efforts have not focused until now on therapeutics directed towards targeting antilipolytic pathways, except niacin utilization [346]. In addition to the niacin receptor HM74a (GPR109a), other GPCR receptors with antilipolytic activity might also be targeted, such as alpha₂-AR receptors, the A1-adenosine and EP3-receptors and metabolite-activated Gi-coupled receptors [176,177,179,194]. In another emerging field, ANP has a potent lipolytic effect, ANP antagonists could be potential antilipolytic compounds for the treatment of dyslipidemia and NEFA-related insulin resistance. The question remains largely open in the absence of suitable pharmacological compounds. Unfortunately, the field is also facing major limitations since the efficacy of ANP antagonists cannot be assessed in rodent systems. To conclude, with the accumulating knowledge of the lipolytic pathways, continued efforts in this area will hopefully lead to new chemical entities for the treatment of obesity-related problems such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk.
