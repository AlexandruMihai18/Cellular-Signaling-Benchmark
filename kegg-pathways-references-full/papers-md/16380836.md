## Introduction

This review will discuss the key preclinical and clinical features of antifolates, from methotrexate (MTX) to pemetrexed and beyond. Despite 50 years of study, definition of the key molecular and pharmacological features of antifolates that translate into clinical activity remains elusive. They include the following.

- Are multiple intracellular targets better than one? Does inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS) or enzymes of the purine biosynthetic pathway confer an advantage? Alternatively, is inhibition of purine biosynthesis a safety liability rather than an advantage?
- Can a lipophilic molecule rather than one that uses the folate carrier mechanisms, i.e. the folate binding protein (FBP) and/or the reduced folate carrier (RFC), circumvent intrinsic or acquired resistance?
- Can tumor selectivity be increased by exploiting knowledge of different patterns of RFC versus FBP expression or of variations in FBP isoform expression?
- How does a patient’s functional folate status or supplemental folic acid modulate efficacy and/or toxicity?
- Does an antifolate that is a good substrate for the intracellular enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS) have a selective advantage? Does polyglutamation of the antifolate confer a therapeutic advantage because it results in increased potency against the target enzyme, and increased polarity leading to increased cellular retention? Alternatively, is it a disadvantage with respect to safety of the molecule because of prolonged intracellular retention times or the potential for resistance?
- Does an increase in the potency of binding to the target enzyme confer a therapeutic advantage?
- Resistance mechanisms include decreased cellular accumulation due to impaired transport, decreased retention inside the cell as a consequence of a lack of polyglutamate formation, or an increase in gamma glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) activity, an increase in expression of the target enzyme, or a mutation in the target enzyme. Which of these is clinically relevant, and how does knowledge of these resistance mechanisms aid selection of the appropriate antifolate for treatment of an individual patient?

- How do pharmacokinetic variables contribute to safety and efficacy? Do the newer antifolates have fewer propensities for drug-drug interactions?
- Is there an intrinsic limit to the clinical activity of an antifolate as a single agent? Can antitumor activity be increased, or can an increase in activity only be achieved by combining antifolates with other anticancer drugs (either other antifolates which target different folate requiring enzymes or compounds with different mechanisms of action)? Similarly, can the spectrum of clinical activity be increased?
- Can patients whose tumors have a specific set of molecular properties be identified prospectively, and matched with the pharmacological properties of an agent, i.e. can therapy of individual patients be tailored?
- Can toxicity be decreased and quality of life improved?
- Can patients at risk of serious toxicity to a given agent be identified before or during therapy and managed in the light of that knowledge?
- Are there mechanisms for rescuing patients from toxicity, and not from antitumor activity?
- What improvements can be made in the administration schedule and therefore convenience to patients?

These issues will be addressed in this review with particular emphasis on data that is available from correlative laboratory and clinical studies, and randomized phase III studies where they exist. Table 1 [1–7] provides a summary of the key molecular features and clinical development status of the drugs reviewed.

The discovery and development of antibiotics over 50 years ago required the detailed study of a number of microorganisms. During this period, an essential growth factor for the bacterium *Lactobacillus casei* was isolated and later identified as folic acid. It was first synthesized in 1945 and given to leukemia patients as a potential therapy. Unfortunately the patient’s symptoms deteriorated, but this observation led to the hypothesis that an antagonist of folic

acid might have clinical utility. By substituting an amino for the hydroxyl group at the 4 position of the pteridine ring of folic acid, Farber and colleagues [8] synthesized aminopterin, which at that time had an unknown mechanism of action, but which was later determined to be a tight binding inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). When treated with aminopterin, some children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) had dramatic, but brief remissions, and this heralded the advent of cancer chemotherapy.

The search for better and less toxic analogs of aminopterin led to the synthesis of MTX; a 4-amino-10-methyl substituted analog (Figure 1). Early clinical trials identified that MTX was effective in the treatment of choriocarcinoma [9–11] and subsequent clinical development established the place of MTX in the treatment of multiple malignancies. As a component of combination chemotherapy, MTX is essentially curative in lymphoma and choriocarcinoma, and in maintenance therapy for ALL. Although clinical practice is now changing, it also found extensive use in the treatment of gastric, bladder, and head and neck cancers. For many years, the CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) regimen was the mainstay of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, as well as treatment for metastatic disease. MTX is also effective in the treatment of a number of other non-malignant diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and graft vs. host disease. The molecular, pharmacological and clinical properties of MTX have been extensively studied and reviewed [12–14].

Attempts to improve the effectiveness of MTX and the spectrum of activity, as well as the observations of intrinsic and acquired resistance to MTX have prompted the search for newer and better antifolates and have taken several different directions. These include the synthesis of other DHFR inhibitors with different pharmacological features, (examples include edatrexate, trimetrexate, piritrexim and PDX), and agents that target a different folate requiring enzyme. These enzymes and their corresponding antifolates include thymidylate synthase, which is targeted by CB 3717, raltitrexed, plevitrexed and AG 337, the purine enzymes glycinate ribonucleotide formyl transferase (GARFT) and aminoimidazole carboxamide formyl transferase (AICARFT) that are targeted by lometrexol, LY 309887 and AG 2034. Pemetrexed is an agent that inhibits multiple folate requiring enzymes.

Another approach has been to modify the affinity of the antifolate for the intracellular enzyme, folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS) via a change in structure. FPGS adds terminal glutamate residues via a peptide bond. Whilst in many cases this increases potency against the target enzyme, it has the potential liability of increasing the intracellular half-life of the molecule and therefore prolonging toxicity. In addition, an important mechanism of clinical resistance to several antifolates including MTX is the reduced capability of cells to form polyglutamates; thus a molecule that is potent without the need for polyglutamation may have a clinical advantage. Antifolates that are not substrates for FPGS are known as non-classical antifolates. Examples include trimetrexate, piritrexim, plevitrexed and AG 337. These molecules are lipophilic and may circumvent resistance due to defects in folate transport pathways. Another strategy has been to try and exploit variations in the tissue distribution of different isoforms of the folate receptor in an attempt to improve the therapeutic ratio of the compound (e.g. LY 309887).

## Methotrexate

### Mechanism of action

The cell is dependent on a supply of fully reduced folates to drive a series of 1-carbon reactions that result in the *de novo* synthesis of both thymidylate and purines. 5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate is the required cofactor for the conversion of deoxyuridylate into thymidylate by thymidylate synthase (TS), whilst 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate donates its formyl group in *de novo* purine biosynthesis. Purine biosynthesis involves ten enzymatic steps. GARFT and AICARFT are responsible for adding carbons 3 and 9 to the ring structure of purines and therefore represent key targets for antifolates.

Antifolates act as fraudulent folate cofactors, thereby inhibiting one or more of the key enzymatic steps in the *de novo* purine and thymidylate biosynthetic pathways. MTX is a tight binding, but reversible [15] inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is responsible for converting dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of this pathway therefore results in the accumulation of dihydrofolate and the inhibition of thymidylate synthase and purine biosynthesis. Binding of MTX to DHFR is stoichiometric under conditions where a low ratio of inhibitor to the enzyme is present inside the cell, but to maintain total enzymatic blockade an excess of unbound drug is required [16]. The physico-chemical characteristics of binding to DHFR have been extensively studied using X-ray crystal-

lography and other techniques [17]. Once MTX binds to DHFR, there is an increase in the level of DHFR protein, which is thought to occur by a mechanism involving translational autoregulation [18, 19]. MTX also inhibits both GARFT and AICARFT, with potency dependent on the polyglutamation status of the molecule (see discussion below). These enzymes may therefore be alternate sites of action of MTX, although a consideration of the Ki values for the pentaglutamates against the target enzymes (0.004 nM, 47 nM, 2500 nM, and 56 nM for DHFR, TS, GARFT and AICARFT, respectively [1]) would suggest that the predominant intracellular target is DHFR, and kinetic studies confirm this.

**Transport**

Folates can be transported into the cell via two energy dependent, carrier mediated mechanisms. The reduced folate carrier (RFC) in human cells is an 80 to 120 kD membrane protein [20, 21]. It is bi-directional, high capacity, pH, energy and temperature dependent and has poor affinity for folic acid (Km 200–400(M), but relatively high affinity for reduced folate cofactors, with a Km of 1 to 3 μM for 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate [22]. The RFC gene has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 21 [23].

The folate binding protein (FBP) is a low capacity, high affinity (Kd = 1 nM), carrier of folates. Once folate is trapped at the cell membrane by the FBP, transport can be mediated via two different mechanisms. The first of these is via endocytosis involving clathrin coated pits, and the second mechanism, potocytosis, is a process involving plasma membrane vesicles that have caveolin as the predominant scaffolding protein [24–26]. There are at least 3 different isoforms of the FBP, also known as the folate receptor (FR), which have been mapped to chromosome 11 [27]. The isoforms differ in their substrate affinity binding profiles and tissue distributions, and may be overexpressed in malignant tissue. FRα is overexpressed in a number of different carcinomas, including ovarian cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer, whereas FRβ is expressed in human liver and placenta [28, 29]. FRγ has been identified only recently and is not linked to the plasma membrane [30].

Folate status appears to regulate the expression of both the RFC and the FBP. Under conditions of folate deprivation, the carriers are upregulated, and when folate repletion occurs, down regulation is observed. This is an important consideration given that cancer patients have been shown to be functionally folate deficient [31] and also in the pharmacology and action of a number of antifolates which have been administered in combination with folic acid, in particular lometrexol, LY309887 and pemetrexed. The different tissue expression of both the RFC and FBP, their overexpression in malignant tissue, as well as the presence of different isoforms of the FBP, may also have important pharmacological consequences for antifolates which have differing binding affinities for these receptors. In addition, competition for the various carriers between naturally occurring folates and antifolates are likely to be important determinants of both toxicity and antitumor activity.

MTX is transported into the cell using both the RFC and the FBP. The RFC has a Km similar to that of folates, whereas the affinity of the FBP for MTX is lower than that of its affinity for reduced folate cofactors and folic acid [32]. The efflux mechanisms of folates have been poorly characterized, but since the RFC is bi-directional, efflux may occur through this route. In addition, a glucose and ATP dependent efflux route has been described [33]. Other factors that contribute to intracellular accumulation include binding to the target enzyme and substrate specificity for the enzymes that control polyglutamation status, FPGS and gamma glutamyl hydrolase (GGH).

**Polyglutamation and intracellular retention**

An important feature of folate homeostasis is the ability of cells to maintain an intracellular concentration of 1 to 10 μM compared to a plasma concentration of 10 to 30 nMol/L in humans [13]. This differential is achieved by polyglutamation. This is the process, catalyzed by FPGS, by which glutamate residues are added sequentially to the proximal glutamate residue of the folate via a peptide bond. The normal glutamate chain length is of the order of 5 to 8 residues. Polyglutamation has a number of important consequences. Firstly, the molecule becomes more polar and therefore cannot diffuse outside the cell, and secondly it often confers and increases cofactor affinity, or in the case of an antifolate, potency against the target enzyme. The intracellular polyglutamation status of a folate (or antifolate) depends not only on substrate specificity for FPGS, but also on specificity for the lysosomal enzyme responsible for removing the terminal glutamate groups, GGH. FPGS is a 62 kD ATP dependent protein that is found in both the cytosol and the mitochondria. Its properties have been reviewed [34]. GGH is a 36 kD exopeptidase that has been cloned, sequenced and expressed recently [35].

MTX competes with the naturally occurring folates for polyglutamation and is a relatively poor substrate for FPGS, with a substrate constant, Km, of 166 μM [1]. The polyglutamated forms of MTX are either equipotent or marginally more potent as inhibitors of DHFR, but potency against other intracellular folate requiring enzymes is enhanced with increasing chain length. Decreased polyglutamate accumulation is an important source of clinical resistance to MTX, and therefore other antifolates that are potent enzyme inhibitors and yet are not substrates for the FPGS may have a therapeutic advantage over MTX in circumventing this important resistance mechanism.

**Clinical resistance mechanisms**

Resistance to MTX can occur via a number of mechanisms, reviewed in [36–39]. These include:

1. A change in transport characteristics through a reduction in transport by the RFC and or the FBP, a loss of one or other of these carriers or an increased rate of efflux.
2. Impaired polyglutamation via a change in the activity of FPGS and/or GGH.
3. A change in the intracellular target (DHFR). This could take the form of increased levels of DHFR, via gene amplification, changes in transcription or translation, or a change in the enzyme's affinity for MTX via a point mutation.
4. Changes in other metabolic and regulatory pathways downstream of DHFR, such as a loss of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein.

Resistance to MTX can either be intrinsic or acquired. Patients with AML are intrinsically resistant to treatment with MTX, whereas ALL is an intrinsically sensitive disease. This clinical difference along with the availability of clinical material has greatly aided the study of resistance mechanisms. The contrasting relative paucity of information on solid tumors is of course largely due to a number of technical and ethical issues associated with taking repeat biopsy samples [39].

Based on clinical studies comparing the potential resistance mechanisms in blast cells from patients with either AML or ALL, it would appear that the predominant mechanism of intrinsic resistance in AML is a defect in polyglutamation. Decreased polyglutamation has also been identified in tumor biopsies from patients with soft tissue sarcoma [40], a disease that is also intrinsically resistant to MTX. The ability of cells to form polyglutamates has been identified as an important factor in predicting outcome to therapy, at least in patients who have good prognostic features [41].

In contrast, an alteration in transport characteristics (decreased influx or increased efflux) or an amplification of DHFR occurs less frequently in clinical samples taken from patients with intrinsically resistant disease. However, in one study of patients with high-grade osteosarcoma, decreased expression of the RFC appeared to be responsible for intrinsic resistance to MTX. At the time of initial biopsy 13 of 20 samples from previously untreated patients had decreased RFC expression as assayed by quantitative RT PCR. Neither DHFR amplification nor a deletion of the RFC gene was seen in any of the samples [42].

Acquired resistance to MTX occurs in patients via a number of mechanisms, including transport defects [43] and amplification of DHFR [44]. In a study of patients with ALL of whom 38 were untreated, and 29 in relapse, Goker et al. [44] identified nine of the 29 relapsed patients who had low level amplification of the DHFR gene, and demonstrated a correlation with the incidence of p53 mutations in seven of the nine patients (*p* < 0.001). The molecular basis of the transport resistance may be a mutation in the RFC gene. These have been described in a number of cell lines [45]. An increase in DHFR copy number has been shown in both experimental models and in leukemic blasts from patients

who had previously received MTX, although the clinical samples have also shown marked heterogeneity in levels of DHFR [46].

Several studies have failed to demonstrate mutations in DHFR in blasts isolated from patients with clinical resistance to MTX. For example, using PCR techniques no mutations in DHFR were identified in leukemic blasts from children with ALL treated with MTX [47]. Lack of a functional retinoblastoma protein has been found to mediate resistance in human cell lines [48], but data from clinical samples are lacking.

### Pharmacokinetic profile

The plasma pharmacokinetic properties of MTX are summarized in Table 2 and reviewed in [12]. Due to variations in absorption, MTX is usually given intravenously rather than orally. The clearance of the drug is highly dependent on renal function [49]. Those patients with impaired renal function are at risk of increased toxicity. Other risk factors include the accumulation of third space fluids [50] and the simultaneous use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents [51], reviewed in [52] and [53]. When given at high doses, i.e. > 6 gm/m², MTX may precipitate intrarenally, since the solubility exceeds the concentrations found in the urine at acid pH, leading to renal failure. This can be avoided by hydration and alkalinizing the urine [54].

MTX undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. It is stored in the liver as polyglutamates and may persist in the body for some considerable time. Two metabolites have been identified in patients receiving high dose infusions: 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH MTX), which appears to be the predominant metabolite excreted in the first 12 to 24 hours [55], and 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpterolic acid (dAMPA) [56], which comprises approximately 25% of the total volume excreted between 24 and 48 hours [57]. The polyglutamated 7-OH metabolite is a weak inhibitor of DHFR, but has similar potency when compared with MTX polyglutamates against GARFT and AICARFT [12, 58].

**Table 2. Plasma pharmacokinetic properties of MTX. From [12]**

| t1/2α | 2 to 3h |
| t1/2γ | 8 to 27h (longer in patients with renal dysfunction or third space accumulations) |
| Vdss | Approximately that of total body water |
| Clearance | 120 ml/min |
| Excretion | Predominantly renal. Most excreted within 12h of administration |
| Protein binding | 60% |
| Third space penetration | Slow, steady state with plasma reached after approximately 6h |
| Clearance from third space | 5 mL/min |
A number of studies have been conducted which would suggest that the pharmacokinetics of MTX is an important determinant of clinical outcome, with respect to both efficacy, and toxicity. A total of 1503 courses of MTX maintenance therapy at a dose of 1 gm/m² were given to 108 children with ALL in one study. Those children with relatively slow clearance (45 to 72 ml/min/m²) had a significantly decreased (*p* = 0.01) risk of relapse whereas rapid drug clearance (84 to 132 ml/min/m²) was associated with a 40% risk of relapse. Steady state MTX concentrations of 16 μM or above were also associated with a higher probability of remaining in remission (*p* < 0.05) [59]. A high plasma AUC of MTX has been found to be predictive of stomatitis in a study involving 150 ALL patients [60], whereas a high concentration of MTX polyglutamates is associated with increased antileukemic effect [61]. The effect was greatest in those patients with nonhyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and those with *T* cell lineage, and these findings are consistent with prognosis [62]. Similarly, in a study of 198 osteosarcoma patients given high doses of MTX (12 gm/m² i.v. over 4 hours) a peak plasma concentration above 1000 (μMol/L has been shown to be predictive of survival [63] and histological response [64].

These risk factors for toxicity and response, together with the high degree of interpatient variability in absorption, have led to the practice of monitoring MTX plasma concentrations, especially in patients receiving high dose therapy, with the intent of pharmacokinetic optimization [65, 66].

### Antitumor activity

MTX is used extensively in the treatment of patients with lymphoma and choriocarcinoma and in the maintenance therapy of ALL. Approximately 70% of children with ALL can now be cured [67]. Although high dose MTX and intrathecal MTX are particularly useful in the treatment of malignancies that involve the CNS such as lymphoma, there are concerns about the potential for increased neurotoxicity when combined with radiation.

Although clinical practice is changing with the advent of new drugs, MTX was historically the mainstay of a number of clinically important combination regimes for the treatment of non-gestational carcinomas. These include the CMF regimen (cyclophosphamide, MTX and 5FU) in adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer, the MVAC regimen (MTX, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in advanced bladder cancer, and the FAMTX regimen (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and high dose MTX) for the treatment of gastric cancer. An assessment of the antitumor activity of MTX as a single agent relative to that of second and third generation antifolates is confounded by the age of the data and by the lack of comparative randomized trials. The initial clinical studies of MTX were conducted before the advent and widespread use of common tools for categorizing response. However, there are some phase II studies of high dose single agent MTX in the treatment of mesothelioma and head and neck cancer. In addition, some assessment of the clinical utility of MTX in combination chemotherapy can be made from recent randomized trials where MTX is a component of one of the regimes and where these trials isolate the value of MTX.

Since mesothelioma is a disease of the pleura that grows in lateral sheets, it is very difficult to identify bidimensionally measurable lesions. As such, the application of standard response criteria such as WHO or SWOG are unhelpful. In a phase II study of high dose MTX in mesothelioma [68], a response was prospectively defined as a 50% decrease in the thickness of two sections or a 30% reduction in thickness of 3 sections. Of 60 assessable patients there were 21 partial responses and 1 CR for an overall response rate of 37%. Currently there are no data available from randomized phase III trials in mesothelioma. However, a review of the activity of a variety of agents in this disease [69] would suggest that based on historical data, MTX is an active agent in this disease.

In head and neck cancer a randomized phase III trial [70] comparing the activity of MTX in patients with edatrexate in previously untreated disease defined a response rate of 16% (9 CRs and 12 PRs) in 133 patients treated with MTX. The majority of responses were seen in patients with locally advanced disease. The median duration of survival was 6 months.

A MTX containing regime known as the classical CMF regime (oral cyclophosphamide days 1 to 14, i.v. MTX and 5FU on days 1 and 8, repeated every 28 days) was the first effective adjuvant therapy for the treatment of patients with operable breast cancer. These observations were first reported in 1976 [71], and have been supported by long-term follow up [72] and a systematic review of all randomized trials in early breast cancer [73]. More recently, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group meta-analysis demonstrated a small survival benefit for anthracycline based adjuvant regimens compared to CMF [74], which has led to a change in the standard of care.

A systematic review of the published randomized clinical trials between 1975 and 1997 [75] has also established its value in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. This review included 189 trials involving 31,510 patients. The various regimes were classified into 12 different comparisons, including single agents versus polychemotherapy (PCHT), and other polychemotherapy versus CMF. In 15 trials involving 2,442 patients there was an 18% lower risk of death associated with the use of PCHT compared with the use of single agents. Whilst there was no difference in the hazard ratio for efficacy between other PCHT and CMF, the toxicity of CMF was substantially less than that of other PCHT. More recently, CMF is being replaced by taxanes and or herceptin in combination with anthracyclines in the metastatic setting.

Roth [76] reviewed the activity of MTX in 8 phase II studies in advanced bladder cancer that were published be-between 1977 and 1984. The 230 patients were treated with 30 to 50 mg/m² weekly in a variety of different dosing schedules. The author concluded that MTX is one of the most active single agents in this disease, with an overall response rate of around 30%. (For a further review of single agent activity in phase II studies in metastatic bladder cancer, see [77]). The value of two drug combinations involving MTX is unclear, certainly in a randomized trial of cisplatin versus cisplatin MTX, there was no difference in overall survival, although there was a higher CR rate and overall progression free survival in favor of the combination [78]. However, the 4-drug MVAC regimen became standard treatment, at least in the US, following publication of data from two randomized trials that showed a survival benefit. The first of these [79] was a comparison with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin, where there was an increase in median survival of 12 weeks in favor of MVAC. The second intergroup study compared MVAC with single agent cisplatin in 246 patients, and a survival advantage of over 4 months was obtained in favor of combination arm [80]. The MVAC regimen has significant toxicity however, and this may explain why it is not a universal standard in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer. Alternatives include another MTX containing regime, cyclophosphamide, MTX and vinblastine (CMV), and gemcitabine and cisplatin.

Hill and Cunningham [81] have reviewed the activity of a number of single agents in the treatment of gastric cancer. In a single study published in 1982, MTX had a response rate of 11% in 28 patients [82]. A number of combination regimes have been studied, but a randomized trial with a design that isolated the value of MTX in advanced gastric cancer was conducted by the EORTC [83]. Two hundred patients were randomized to either FAM (5 fluorouracil, doxorubicin and mitomycin) or FAMTX. There was a survival benefit of 15 weeks in favor of the MTX containing arm, $(p = 0.002)$, and a statistically significant difference in response rate (41% for FAMTX and 9% for FAM, $p = 0.0001$).

### Other compounds which target DHFR

A number of analogs of MTX have been evaluated both preclinically and clinically. These have been classified according to their substrate specificity for FPGS. Classical antifolates are those that are substrates for FPGS and typically enter the cell via either the RFC or the FBP. The rationale for the development of the non-polyglutamated inhibitors is that unlike MTX, they should be able to circumvent intrinsic or acquired resistance resulting from a decrease in polyglutamation or an increase in the activity of GGH. Rosowsky [84] has proposed a sub classification of these non-classical antifolates into those of class A and B, based on transport characteristics. Class A compounds are lipophilic and enter cells via passive or facilitated diffusion. This may confer a therapeutic advantage in the setting of resistance due to a transport defect. Class B compounds are water-soluble, enter cells via the RFC and are rapidly cleared, but have their $\gamma$-carboxy groups of the side chain blocked and therefore are not substrates for FPGS. Compounds of the B class have largely not been tested in the clinic and therefore are not discussed further here. Preclinical data for these compounds is reviewed in [84].

Numerous non-classical DHFR analogs have been evaluated. Several, including Baker’s antifol, piritrexim and metoprine have been the subject of clinical investigation.

#### Trimetrexate

Trimetrexate (TMTX), 2, 4-diaminoquinazoline, is a class A, non-classical, direct inhibitor of DHFR that has been approved for the treatment of AIDS related Pneumocystis infections. The activity of TMTX in cell lines that are resistant to MTX by virtue of a change in transport characteristics has been demonstrated experimentally [85]. Whilst this observation might support the contention that TMTX has an advantage over MTX, multidrug resistant cell lines are resistant to TMTX [86–88]. An alternative mechanism of resistance results from increased levels of DHFR occurring via a posttranslational mechanism [89, 90].

A large number of phase I trials evaluating various intermittent to continuous schedules of TMTX have been conducted [91–98, reviewed in 99], and the toxicity profile is similar to that of MTX, with leukopenia being dose limiting. Tolerance is highly variable between patients, possibly because of high protein binding and hepatic transformation [100]. A review of toxicity among 272 patients entered into phase I trials with TMTX suggested that that serum albumin and protein levels are predictive for toxicity. Those patients with baseline albumin less than 3.5 g/dL had a higher incidence of life threatening toxicity [101]. It is not clear what the optimal schedule is, although the most commonly used regimen is an i.v. bolus given daily × 5 every three weeks. Phase II studies are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 [102–129]. Preliminary data suggests that TMTX is highly active in patients with $T$ cell lymphoma and skin involvement. A response rate of 45% in 20 patients was observed [122]. Eighty five percent of patients had not responded to a prior regimen and of the 5 patients previously treated with MTX, 2 responded to TMTX. With this exception, the antitumor activity of TMTX appears to be otherwise fairly modest. Different trials have also yielded disparate results with the caveat of course that there are wide confidence intervals associated with the response rates in these small studies. These were between from 0 to 15% in advanced breast cancer [102, 103], from 0 to 19% in NSCLC [109, 110, 124], from 0 to 12.5% in esophageal cancer [111–113], and from 4 to 21% in gastric cancer [115, 116]. In phase II trials of patients with renal cell, leiomyosarcomas of uterus, mixed mesodermal tumor of the uterus, mesothelioma, and bladder cancer, response rates of up to 3% [104], 4.3% [120],

4.8% [121], 12.5% [107], and 17% [105] respectively, have been reported. TMTX is inactive in the treatment of sarcoma [108], prostate cancer [106], glioma [119], cervical cancer [126] and melanoma [117, 118].

Despite an earlier observation of lack of activity in 30 patients with colorectal cancer [114], two schedules of TMTX were evaluated in a randomized phase II study (Table 4) [123]. In 71 previously untreated patients given TMTX at 200mg/m²iv every 14 days, a 6% response rate was obtained, whereas 12mg/m² given on the more usual daily × 5 schedule failed to produce any responses in 29 patients. In the same study 5FU had a response rate of 18% in 62 patients.

In CCRF CEM cells the cytotoxicity of a combination of TMTX and leucovorin, but not MTX and fluorouracil, were increased with leucovorin [131]. In a phase I study the combination of TMTX and 5FU with leucovorin produced a 20% response rate in previously treated patients with gastrointestinal cancers.

testinal malignancies, the majority of which were colorectal [132]. These observations led to phase II combinations studies in which response rates of 15–42% were obtained with the combination in patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer [127–129], and later to 2 randomized trials in which 5FU leucovorin was compared with TMTX, 5FU and leucovorin (Table 6) [133, 134]. These trials had disappointing outcomes. The US trial failed to demonstrate either a survival advantage or a benefit in terms of progression free survival, for the TMTX containing arm [133]. The European trial [134] had a similar but non-identical design, in that it was not placebo controlled, and the dose of 5FU was 600mg/m² rather than 500mg/m² as in the US study. In this study, there was a statistically significant increase of 1.3 months in progression free survival in favor of the TMTX containing arm. However, in an integrated analysis of both trials this difference was not sustained [135].

How effective is TMTX in MTX resistant patients? Several of the published studies included patients who had been previously treated with MTX. In the ECOG phase II study [105] in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, there were 8 responses in 48 evaluable patients. All of these

responders had prior exposure to MTX, and 5 of them had progressed while on MTX containing regimens. The activity of TMTX in previously untreated TCC patients has not been determined. As discussed above TMTX was noted to induce responses in patients with T cell lymphoma who had previously been exposed to MTX [122].

Piritrexim

Piritrexim is also a class A, non-classical DHFR inhibitor which is given orally on a daily × 5 every 21 day schedule with doses of 75 to 150mg twice daily, although it can also be given intravenously. The MTD on the i.v. formulation is 170mg/m² per day daily. Dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression, with phlebitis and nausea and vomiting being issues with the i.v. and oral formulations, respectively. Whether or not an orally administered compound is an advantage is debatable. Often such compounds have wide interpatient toxicities, and if nausea and vomiting are uncontrolled, variable absorption may be an issue. Phase I data are reviewed by Laszlo [136] and Phase II data by Takimoto and Allegra [137] and are summarized in Table 7 [138–149]. There are less clinical data than with TMTX and no randomized trials. Published response rates from phase II trials include 4% in patients with advanced breast cancer [142], 9% in patients with sarcoma [144], and 20 to 27% in patients with head and neck cancer previously untreated in the recurrent or metastatic setting [145, 146]. Interestingly, the addition of MTX did not confer additional benefit in the treatment of head and neck cancer, since a study of the combination in patients with previously untreated disease [147] yielded a 17% response rate. In a phase II study of 31 patients with melanoma a 23% response rate was reported for the single agent [148], and yet in combination with DTIC, no responses were observed in 17 evaluable patients.
[149]. Initial observations suggested intriguing activity in bladder cancer: in a second line setting there were 3 PRs in 13 evaluable patients (23% RR) [139], and in a study of 33 chemotherapy naive patients there was a complete response lasting 19+ weeks, and 10 PRs for an overall response rate of 38% in 29 evaluable patients [140]. Three of four patients with bladder cancer who progressed following MVAC had a partial response to treatment with oral piritrexim [150]. However, a subsequent study in previously treated patients was disappointing with a response rate of only 7% [138]. The patterns of clinical resistance to piritrexim have not been well characterized. The bone marrow of patients treated with piritrexim was collaterally resistant to MTX in a phase I trial [151]. However, there is a case report of a patient with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who acquired resistance to piritrexim, but remained sensitive to methotrexate [152].

### Edatrexate

Edatrexate (a diastereoisomeric mixture of 10-ethyl-10-deaza-aminopterin), (Edam) is a classical antifolate which has better transport characteristics (increased Vmax and decreased Km for the RFC) and better substrate specificity for FPGS than MTX [153]. In preclinical models it has a broader spectrum of activity than MTX [154]. Like MTX, Edam enters the cell via the RFC. Phase I studies determined a recommended phase II dose of 80 mg/m² given i.v. weekly. The dose limiting toxicity is mucositis, other toxicities include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and transient rises in transaminases. A multiplicity of phase II studies has been conducted (Tables 8 and 9 [155–181], and previously reviewed by Takimoto and Allegra [137]). Edam has no significant activity in hepatocellular carcinoma [161], germ cell tumors [155], cervix cancer [157], ovarian cancer [160], pancreas cancer [162, 171], small cell lung cancer [163], colorectal cancer [158, 159], prostate cancer [164] and melanoma [170]. In soft tissue sarcoma 5 responses were seen in 7 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma [172], otherwise the drug would appear to be essentially inactive [172, 173]. However, in 4 separate phase II studies in patients with NSCLC, response rates of between 7 and 32% were observed with an overall composite of 15 responses in 94 patients evaluable for response. In breast cancer, activity of between 34 and 41% was seen in 2 trials involving 73 patients (Table 8), [168, 169]. By combining edatrexate with various other cytotoxic drugs response rates of up to 47% are achievable (Table 9, [178–180]). Although an edatrexate, cisplatin, vinblastine, doxorubicin combination was highly active [180], 3 treatment related deaths occurred and patients experienced deterioration in quality of life.

Edatrexate is active as a single agent in head and neck cancer (Table 8 [164–167]) with response rates of between 6 and 24% [164–167] in three separate trials. However, a disappointing 9% response rate in 26 patients was obtained when leucovorin and carboplatin were added to edatrexate (Table 9, [181]).

The CALGB [177] conducted sequential trials of 80 mg/m² weekly edatrexate in previously untreated patients with mesothelioma. In the first part of the study, 20 patients were treated with edatrexate alone with a 25% response rate. However, there was substantial toxicity. In the second part of the study, 38 patients were supplemented with leucovorin yielding a 16% response rate with improved tolerance. Given the confidence intervals associated with these response rates it is not possible to say if activity was reduced by leucovorin, but this is possible.

The observations of activity in NSCLC and head and neck cancer led to two randomized trials. The EORTC phase III study randomized 131 in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck to Edam, and 133 to MTX [182]. Overall and progression free survival was similar in both arms. Although overall toxicity was said to be similar in both arms of the study, stomatitis and skin toxicity were more pronounced with Edam treatment. In addition, there were 5 treatment-related deaths in patients treated with Edam, and 1 in a patient treated with MTX. This led to the conclusion that there was no difference between Edam and MTX with respect to efficacy, and more toxicity with Edam.

In the other randomized trial, 673 previously untreated patients with stage III and IV NSCLC (Table 11) [183] were randomized to either Edam, mitomycin and vinblastine or mitomycin and vinblastine. Efficacy (median survival and 1 year survival) was similar in both arms of the study and there were excess treatment related deaths, Grade 3 and 4 leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and mucositis in the Edam containing arm. There was therefore no benefit and increased toxicity with Edam treatment.

### PDX

10-propargyl 10-deazaaminopterin, otherwise known as PDX, has greater specificity for the reduced folate carrier and for FPGS than dose either MTX or EdaM. It is approximately 5 fold more potent than MTX as an inhibitor of L1210 cells [184]. A phase I study defined a dose of 150 mg/m² given every 2 weeks as the recommended phase II dose [185]. Mucositis was dose limiting. In a phase II study of 39 patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated in a secondline setting a 10% response rate was obtained [186]. Further phase II data is awaited with interest.

### TS inhibitors

The enzyme thymidylate synthase converts deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) into thymidine monophosphate (TMP). Inhibition of this enzyme leads to a thymine less death [187].

CB3717

A 2-amino-4-hydroxyquinazoline derivative was synthesized as part of an attempt to generate antifolates that might have specificity for TS rather than DHFR. CB3717 is a potent TS inhibitor with a Ki for the target enzyme of approximately 3nM and good in vitro and in vivo activity [188–190]. Although a number of responses were noted in early phase II clinical trials [191–193], CB3717 had unpredictable life-threatening toxicity secondary to renal tubule occlusion due to crystallization of the compound in the urine at low pH. The patients who were at risk could not be

identified by a multivariate analysis, and alkalinization of the urine could not prevent the crystallization [194], so further clinical development was terminated. However, the observations of activity with CB3717 stimulated further interest in the notion that TS directed antifolates may have useful clinical activity, and led to the structure activity design criteria of specificity for TS, requirement for polyglutamation by FPGS, good cytotoxicity and solubility. These criteria led to the selection of raltitrexed (ZD1964) from structure activity studies.

### Raltitrexed

Raltitrexed enters the cell via the RFC, with a Km of 1 to 2 $\mu$M [4, 195], binds to the FBP with an affinity of 0.7 times that of folic acid [196] and is a good substrate for polyglutamation, with a Km of 1.3 $\mu$M for FPGS [4]. Polyglutamate formation has been studied in a variety of cell lines exposed to 0.1 uM raltitrexed for 4 hours [195]. In cells sensitive to raltitrexed the intracellular concentration ranged from 2.8 to 9.6 $\mu$M, of which up to 97% existed as polyglutamates [195]. Raltitrexed is a less potent binder of TS than CB3717, with a Ki of 60 nM for the parent compound [4]. In common with other molecules of this class, potency against the target enzyme increases with successive polyglutamation, and the tetraglutamate has a Ki of 1 nM [197]. The specificity for TS as the target intracellular enzyme has been demonstrated by end product reversal experiments [4] and raltitrexed is active in cell lines resistant to MTX by virtue of amplification of DHFR [195]. The *in vivo* animal data show a lack of correlation with clinical data, and indeed antitumor activity is difficult to demonstrate *in vivo*, except in cell lines that are unable to salvage thymidine via thymidine kinase. At least in part this is due to the very high levels of circulating thymidine in the plasma of mice, which is estimated to be around 1 $\mu$M. In contrast, levels of circulating thymidine in humans are 10-fold lower [198].

Phase I studies of raltitrexed were initiated in 1991, and defined a recommended phase II dose of 3 mg/m² given as a 15-minute infusion once every three weeks [199]. Dose limiting toxicity included neutropenia and diarrhea. Three responses were documented (breast, ovarian and carcinoma

prolonged infusion). There was no difference in efficacy between the arms, but toxicity was greater in the raltitrexed arm, suggesting inferiority for the newer agent.

Subsequent phase II studies have attempted to define the activity of raltitrexed in combination with other agents in colorectal cancer. One of the most active doublets is an oxaliplatin combination, and in 6 separate studies (Table 14 [219–224]), response rates of between 43 and 62% were obtained in a frontline setting. Activity drops to between 16 and 33% in previously treated patients (Table 15 [225–229])

The irinotecan doublet may be as active as the raltitrexed oxaliplatin combination but has been less well characterized (Table 16), and the two doublets have yet to be compared in a randomized trial. Two studies of 83 and 46 chemo naive patients produced response rates of 34 and 46% respectively [230 231], and in one of these studies [230], the median survival was 15.6 months. In 52 5FU refractory patients, raltitrexed plus irinotecan had a response rate of 15.4% (Table 16), [232].

The other combinations evaluated to date are inferior. A sequential study of raltitrexed, methotrexate and 5FU leucovorin in chemonaive patients produced a response rate (12%) equivalent to that of single agent raltitrexed [233]. In patients who failed two previous regimens including 5FU, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, raltitrexed was inactive [234].

There are no published phase III trials evaluating raltitrexed combinations in colorectal cancer. However, a phase II/III study (Table 17, [235]) with response rate as the primary endpoint, attempted to isolate the value of raltitrexed compared to methotrexate when combined with

5FU leucovorin, and with irinotecan plus 5FU leucovorin. The study design was confounded by the use of 3 different doses of 5FU in the 3 arms. Although the irinotecan 5FU doublet appeared superior with a 34% response rate compared to 24% for both of the other arms of the study, there was insufficient power to detect a difference.

Raltitrexed is also active in other GI malignancies (Table 18 [236–239], Table 19 [240]). Two phase II studies demonstrated response rates of 12 and 29% for raltitrexed plus gemcitabine in previously untreated pancreas cancer (Table 18) [236, 237]. In patients previously treated with gemcitabine, raltitrexed was inactive.

in a randomized phase II study (Table 19 [240]), but in combination with irinotecan had a 16% response rate. The difference between the two arms was statistically significant.

Whereas as a single agent raltitrexed had no activity in gastric cancer [207] (Table 12), in combination with epirubicin and cisplatin, a response rate of 29% was achieved (Table 18, [238]). However, there was significant toxicity including 3 treatment related deaths (neutropenic sepsis and cardiorespiratory failure). When combined with oxaliplatin in a secondline setting, raltitrexed is essentially inactive with a 5% response rate (Table 18, [239]).

As with gastric cancer, raltitrexed appeared from the initial phase II studies to be inactive in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Table 12, [213, 214]). A randomized phase II study comparing raltitrexed cisplatin and 5FU with methotrexate cisplatin and 5FU (Table 20, [241]) appears to suggest a statistically significant difference in overall response rate and complete response rate in favor of the raltitrexed combination. However, the dose of both 5FU and cisplatin varies between the two arms of the study, making the efficacy data difficult to interpret.

A phase I study of the combination of raltitrexed with oxaliplatin first suggested activity in mesothelioma. Seventeen patients with mesothelioma were included in the study, of whom 7 had a partial response documented [242]. Subsequent phase II studies (Table 21 [243, 244]) of the combination yielded a 45% response rate in chemonaive patients [243] and 20% in a population of patients, 20% of whom had been pretreated [244]. A later phase II trial (Table 22 [245]) comparing cisplatin with raltitrexed plus cisplatin showed a trend towards improved median survival in the combination arm (11.2 months vs. 8.8 months), but the difference did not achieve statistical significance.

Several studies have revealed safety concerns including treatment related deaths with raltitrexed [218, 246, 247]. These deaths have largely resulted from gastrointestinal toxicity in the setting of neutropenia. A study in the adjuvant setting (PETACC-1) had to be stopped early when

an interim safety review revealed a 1.9% incidence of treatment related deaths (17 in 911 patients) compared to 0.8% (7 in 927 patients) in patients treated with 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin [248]. Further analysis suggested that some of these patients had not received appropriate dose modifications on the basis of either impaired renal function, or in the face of toxicity. Renal excretion is the major route of elimination of raltitrexed [249], and accumulation may result if patients have impaired renal function [250]. Leucovorin has been proposed as a rescue agent on the basis of animal experimentation [251], but concerns about the potential for ablation of the antitumor effect mitigates against its routine use. Unlike the experience with pemetrexed (see below), folate supplementation has not been employed clinically. It would be interesting to know if elevated homocysteine predicts for increased toxicity. At least

in one small study, this would appear not to be the case [252].

Identifying the clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance to raltitrexed is still the subject of investigation. Cell lines made resistant to raltitrexed show decreased polyglutamation and reduced uptake [5, 253, 254].

Earlier correlative studies have shown that expression of TS is an important prognostic variable in the outcome of patients treated with 5FU [255–257]. One small pharmacodynamic study [258], investigated the expression of various enzymes, including TS and FPGS in biopsies of colorectal cancer in patients pre and post treatment with raltitrexed. Twenty patients were evaluable for both response and gene expression studies, and 6 patients responded. Unlike the case with 5FU, lack of response was

not associated with high levels of either dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase or thymidine phosphorylase. However, high levels of TS mRNA expression predicted non-response to raltitrexed.

### Plevitrexed

A second-generation TS inhibitor, plevitrexed (ZD9331), was designed not to be a substrate for FPGS in an effort to circumvent potential resistance mechanisms. Its potency against the target enzyme TS is comparable to that of the pentaglutamate form of raltitrexed. Due to the relatively short half-life in dogs of around 6 hours, a daily × 5 schedule was initially selected for phase I testing. However, in humans the compound proved to have a half-life 17 times longer and a clearance 49 times longer than anticipated from preclinical studies [259]. Alternative schedules of day 1 and 8 administration every 3 weeks [260] and a five day infusion every 3 weeks [259, 261] and an oral formulation [262, 263] were then evaluated.

Phase II studies have been conducted in gastric, non small cell, ovarian, breast and colorectal cancers (Table 23 [264–267]), largely using the weekly × 2 every three week schedule at 130 mg/m². The oral formulation was evaluated in a subset of patients with breast cancer [265], and a subset of gastric cancer patients were treated at 65 mg/m² [264].

The most interesting data has been derived in ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. An initial study conducted in ovarian cancer patients who had failed prior platinum, paclitaxel and topotecan defined a 7% response rate [266]. This included a complete response in a patient receiving plevitrexed as 8th line therapy. When combined with topotecan in 41 patients who had progressed following first or second-line treatment with platinum and paclitaxel, a response rate of 14.6% was achieved including one complete response (Table 24 [268]). These data suggest that the evaluation of plevitrexed in an earlier setting in combination with platinum and/or a taxane would be of interest.

The initial 10 patients in the gastric cancer phase II study [264] were dosed at 130 mg/m². Seven of these patients required a dose delay, reduction or omission due to toxicity. This led to a decision to treat subsequent patients at 65 mg/m². However, these patients were permitted to have dose escalations, and in fact, 58% of them did so. This suggests that the dose of 65 mg/m² may have been suboptimal. In the 24 patients treated at 65 mg/m², there were 6 responses giving a response rate of 25%. No responses were seen at 130 mg/m². When the data is combined, there is an overall response rate of 17.2%. Clearly, this trial needs replicating using a suitable dose. However if the efficacy is sustained it would place plevitrexed as one of the more active single agents in gastric cancer, and would clearly distinguish it from raltitrexed which is inactive in gastric cancer [207].

---

A small randomized trial (Table 25 [269]), comparing plevitrexed with gemcitabine in pancreas cancer suggested a trend towards improved survival in the plevitrexed arm (5.1 vs. 3.6 months). However, the trial only contained 55 patients, and significance was not reached. The survival in the gemcitabine arm also appears to be lower than anticipated by comparison with recent randomized trials [270, 271]. A suitably powered study should be conducted to determine the true value of plevitrexed in this disease.

### Nolatrexed

Nolatrexed (AG337) is a TS inhibitor that was designed from the crystal structure of E. coli TS and X-ray analysis of ligands bound to the enzyme [272]. It is a lipophilic, water-soluble molecule that is not a substrate for either the RFC or FPGS. The notion was that prolonged exposure would be required to achieve antitumor effect, since there would be no selective retention of the molecule intracellularly, but that would be compensated by the absence of prolonged toxicity. End product reversal experiments demonstrate that nolatrexed is a specific inhibitor of TS, with a Ki of 11 nM for binding to TS [273]. As would be expected from knowledge of its structure the compound has rapid influx and efflux and prolonged exposure is needed for cytotoxic activity. *In vivo*, nolatrexed has good activity and is curative in L5178Y TK- lymphoma [273].

Five phase I studies were conducted with nolatrexed in adult patients. A study evaluating a 24-hour infusion [274] showed a rapid clearance with a t1/2 of 53 to 93 minutes after the infusion, and plasma pharmacokinetics best described by a one-compartment model. Levels of plasma deoxyuridylate (dUDR) were raised during the infusion suggesting that TS inhibition was achieved. This study led to a 5-day infusion study, given once every three weeks, which defined a dose of 800 mg/m²/day as the recommended phase II dose [275]. Dose limiting toxicity included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and mucositis. One partial response in a patient with colorectal cancer was observed in this study. A 10-day infusion was felt to be too toxic on the basis of thrombotic phenomena [276].

Since nolatrexed has 89% bioavailability, an oral schedule (every 6 hours for 5 days) was also evaluated [277]. Toxicity was similar to the i.v. schedule and a dose of 800 mg/m²/day was recommended for phase II evaluation. A second oral dosing schedule (every 6 hours for 10 days) defined a dose of 429 mg/m²/day as a potential candidate for phase II testing [278].

The 5-day i.v. infusion was selected for phase II evaluation in prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreas cancer, head and neck and colorectal cancer and NSCLC. Most of the data from these early trials has been published in abstract form only, but reviewed by Hughes and Calvert [279]. There was 1PR in hepatocellular carcinoma in 40

evaluable patients, 4/22 responses in head and neck cancer including 2 CRs, 1/17 in adenocarcinoma of the colon and 1/25 in pancreas cancer. Two further phase studies in hepatocellular carcinoma had response rates of 2.5 and 4.9% respectively [280, 281], and a phase II/III study in which 54 patients were randomized to either doxorubicin or nolatrexed failed to show a statistically significant survival difference between the two arms [282] (Table 26). No responses were observed in either arm of the study. A further randomized trial (Table 27) with MTX as the comparator was conducted in patients with head and neck cancer, also failed to demonstrate a difference in efficacy between the two arms [283]. The incidence of CTC grade 3 and 4 toxicity was increased in the nolatrexed arm.

Resistance mechanisms to nolatrexed are poorly characterized. However, human lung carcinoma cells, SW1573/2R160, which overexpress Pgp, are resistant to AG337 [284]. Site directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that amino acids Ile and Phe 225 are important in the binding of folate and its analogues and a mutation in Ile 108 confers approximately 80-fold resistance to nolatrexed [285].

Purine biosynthesis inhibitors

Lometrexol

Lometrexol (LMTX), the 6R diastereomer of dideazatetrahydrofolic acid (DDATHF), was the first antifolate to specifically target the purine biosynthetic pathway. Its preclinical and clinical properties have been comprehensively reviewed by Mendelsohn et al. [6]. LMTX enters the cell via both the RFC and the FBP, and the binding characteristics to the various isoforms of FBP have been characterized. The hypothesis is that the relative binding to these isoforms and their different tissue distribution may provide the basis for selectivity [28, 286]. Once inside the cell LMTX is a good substrate for FGPS, and potency against the target enzymes increases with polyglutamation, such that the parent compound has a Ki of 59.7 nM for human GARFT, whereas the pentaglutamate has a Ki tenfold lower, at 5.3 nM [6, 287]. In some key experiments, the late Gerry Grindey showed that the toxicity of LMTX is highly dependent on folate status [288, 289]. Mice maintained on a folate free diet are highly sensitive to LMTX, if the diet is supplemented with folic acid toxicity may be ameliorated but antitumor activity preserved, unless very high doses of folic acid are given. Whole body autoradiography experiments showed that under conditions of folate deprivation there was increased uptake of LMTX into the liver [290] and it has been postulated that the liver may act as a store of LMTX and free drug may be leached into the circulation over time. This may in part explain the long half-life of 2593 minutes that has been observed in the clinic [291]. Folic acid would appear not to influence pharmacokinetic parameters [291]. LMTX has high affinity for the β isoform of the FR, which is highly expressed in human liver [28, 286].

*Q 3 week schedule.

The importance of dietary folic acid in modulating toxicity was only understood after the initiation of phase I trials with LMTX, and as a result some studies were conducted without folic acid supplementation, and some with, which protracted clinical development. Without folic acid supplementation, the dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression, but toxicity is cumulative. Consistent with the in vivo observations, supplementing patients with oral folic acid improves tolerance to LMTX. On a Q 3 week schedule of LMTX in the absence of folic acid, the MTD is less than 12 mg/m² [292]. However, the same schedule with 14 days of supplemental oral folic acid at 5 mg/day has a recommended phase II dose of at least 130 mg/m² [293]. A number of key questions remain including the size of the therapeutic window in man, i.e. what is an optimal level of folic acid supplementation that will provide a tolerable safety profile but not ablate antitumor activity? Whilst this question cannot be answered with precision on the basis of the clinical trials conducted to date, it is clear that i.v. folic acid administered 30 minutes before LMTX is not effective in reducing or preventing toxicity [294], and of the oral supplements evaluated, a dose of more than 2 mg/day but less than or equal to 5 mg/day is required. Although the question as to whether folic acid at these doses modulates efficacy could of course only be addressed by a randomized study, it is important to note that a total of 6 responses were seen in the phase I studies. These responses were seen in different tumor types, in different centers and in studies with and without folate supplementation [6]. No phase II data are available.

LY309887

LY309887 is a second generation thiophene derivative of lometrexol that was designed to have an improved therapeutic ratio by virtue of different relative affinities for the various isoforms of the FBP. It also has superior potency against GARFT with a Ki for the parent compound of 2.1 nM (figure derived for the diastereomeric mix of

compounds), compared with 59.7 for parent (i.e. not polyglutamated) LMTX [6]. The 3 phase I studies with LY 309887 [295–297] have all been conducted with folic acid supplementation, and a dose of 6 mg/m² given every three weeks with 5 mg of folic acid given daily for 14 days was defined as the recommended phase II dose [297].

AG2034

The crystal structure of GARFT was used to design the inhibitor AG2034 (reviewed by Boritzki [7]) [4-[2-(2-amino-4-oxo-4, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-3H-pyrimidino[5, 4, 6][1, 4]thiazin-6-yl)-(S)-ethyl]-2, 5-thienoylamino-L-glutamic acid]. Whether purine biosynthesis inhibitors are cytotoxic as opposed to cytostatic has long been a subject of debate. Cell culture experiments have shown that AG2034 is cytostatic to HeLa/S3 cells and SW480 cells in the presence of high extracellular levels of folic acid, but that at lower (physiological) levels of folate, AG2034 is cytotoxic. The presence or absence of functional p53 would also appear to determine whether a cytotoxic or cytostatic response is elicited. These observations led to the decision to evaluate AG2034 in the clinic in the absence of folic acid, and two separate phase I studies defined a recommended phase II dose of 5 mg/m² with a Q 3 week schedule [298, 299]. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a shorter terminal half-life than LMTX, i.e. 364 minutes, but there was accumulation of AG2034 between courses [300].

Multiple targets

The notion that a compound that is directed at multiple targets within the folate pathway might be better than one that is highly specific is intriguing.

Pemetrexed

Pemetrexed (LY231514, MTA) is a pyrrolopyrimidine that was discovered in structure-activity relationship studies based on LMTX [301]. Investigations utilizing a panel of
breast carcinoma cell lines with differing levels of expression of the RFC or FBP have shown that pemetrexed enters the cell via the RFC. Pemetrexed is an extremely good substrate for FPGS, with a substrate constant of 0.8 μM, compared to MTX at 166 μM and LMTX at 9.3 μM [1]. Pemetrexed has multiple intracellular loci within the folate pathway including TS, DHFR, GARFT, AICARFT and the dehydrogenase and synthetase domains of C1 tetrahydrofolate synthase. The Ki values for the pentaglutamate derivative of pemetrexed against these enzymes are 1.3 nM, 7.2 nM, 65 nM, 265 nM, 4 μM and 1.6 μM, respectively [302]. Progressive glutamation increases potency against TS and GARFT, but not against DHFR. Based on these values, one might expect the predominant intracellular target to be TS. However, end product reversal experiments have shown that an exogenous supply of both thymidine and a purine, hypoxanthine, is required to fully reverse cytotoxicity to CCRF/CEM cells in culture, suggesting that inhibition of multiple targets is required to achieve cell killing. In addition, pemetrexed is effective in killing cell lines resistant to compounds which act at the TS locus by virtue of overexpression of TS, and cytotoxicity to these cells is completely prevented by the addition of hypoxanthine to the culture medium [303]. In studies examining the effects on pemetrexed on folate and nucleotide triphosphate pools pemetrexed had a metabolic profile distinct from either MTX or LY309887 [304].

Three phase I studies were conducted which demonstrated that pemetrexed has marked schedule dependency. The weekly × 4 Q6 schedule [305] was not feasible since myelosuppression mandated multiple dose omissions within a course. The daily × 5 Q21 day and the every three week studies defined recommended phase II doses of 4 mg/m² [306], and 600 mg/m² [307] for these schedules, respectively. Myelosuppression was dose limiting, other toxicities included stomatitis, fatigue and a rash. Interestingly, 4 responses were noted in patients in the every 3 week phase I study, 2 in colorectal cancer and 2 in pancreas cancer. Of these, 3 patients had received prior treatment with a TS inhibitor. These observations prompted a broad-spectrum phase II program with the Q3 week schedule, [reviewed in 1, 308, 309]. Phase II and III clinical data are summarized in Tables 28–38 [310–336]. As a single agent, pemetrexed showed broad activity in initial phase II studies with response rates of 7 % in pancreas cancer [322], 8% in renal cancer [335], 9–23% in non small cell lung cancer [310–315], 15–17% in colorectal cancer [325, 326] 17–28% in advanced breast cancer [329–331], 21% in gastric cancer [328], 21% in cervix cancer [336], 26.5% in SCCHN [333] and 32% in advanced bladder cancer [334].

The early observation of single agent activity in NSLC led to a large randomized trial comparing pemetrexed (500 mg/m² and vitamin supplemented) with single agent docetaxel at 75 mg/m² given in a secondline setting (Table 29 [313]). Although the efficacy outcomes (median survival, 1 year survival and response rate) were comparable between the two arms of the study, the safety profile favored pemetrexed. Docetaxel caused significantly more CTC grade 3 and 4 neutropenia, complications associated with neutropenia (fever, infection, use of granulocyte stimulating factor and hospitalizations), and alopecia. These data were the basis for marketing authorization in the US and in Europe.

Several pemetrexed combinations have been evaluated in phase II studies in NSCLC (Table 30, 31 [314–318]). A 31 patient study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin in previously untreated patients had a 41.9 % response rate, with median survival of 8.9 months [315]. Although the combination of pemetrexed and gemcitabine only achieved a modest 15.5% response rate, median survival was 10.1 months and 1 year survival 42.6% [316]. The significance of the survival data are difficult to interpret in the context of a phase II study but it would seem that the combination is worthy of further investigation. A randomized phase II study of pemetrexed plus oxaliplatin versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin in 80 patients was unrevealing with similar response rates (27 and 33% respectively) in both arms [318].

The activity of pemetrexed in mesothelioma was first seen in the initial phase I combination study with cisplatin. Eleven remissions were seen including 4 in 10 patients with mesothelioma, and one complete response in a patient with relapsed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [337]. In a phase I study of the combination of pemetrexed and carboplatin in mesothelioma patients, 8 partial responses were seen in 25 patients assessable for response, and 70% of patients reported symptomatic improvement [338]. These observations were followed by phase II studies of pemetrexed (Table 32) as a single agent (14.1% response rate [319]), and in combination with gemcitabine (20% response rate in 34 evaluable patients in a preliminary report [320]).

Table 33 summarizes data from a 456 patient study in which chemotherapy naive pleural mesothelioma patients were randomized to either cisplatin as a single agent or to the combination of pemetrexed plus cisplatin [321]. The combination had significantly better efficacy outcomes as follows: median survival (12.1 vs. 9.3 months), median time to progression (5.7 vs. 3.9 months) and response rate (41.3 vs. 16.7%). As might be anticipated, toxicity was increased with the combination, particularly CTC grade 3 and 4 neutropenia. However, there was no statistically significant difference with respect to clinical complications of neutropenia, i.e. febrile episodes and infections. Pemetrexed is the first drug to show a survival benefit in mesothelioma and the data led to marketing authorizations in the US and Europe.

Interestingly, Wang and colleagues [339] have reported the existence of a novel antifolate transporter highly specific for pemetrexed in human mesothelioma cell lines. This transporter has relatively low affinity for raltitrexed, plevitrexed or inhibitors of DHFR. This would provide a plausible explanation for the apparently superior clinical activity of pemetrexed in mesothelioma in comparison with other an-

tifolates. (This statement must of course be tempered with the caveat that there are no randomized trials comparing the activity of pemetrexed with other antifolates in mesothelioma).

Despite some initially promising data derived from phase II studies (Table 34 [322, 323]), pemetrexed does not improve the survival of patients with pancreas cancer treated with gemcitabine alone (Table 35 [324]).

Phase III data in other indications are currently lacking. However, as discussed above, pemetrexed has intriguing activity in a range of other tumor types (Tables 36–38) including colorectal, gastric, breast, head and neck, bladder and cervix cancer. Additional combination studies are warranted in these indications.

The initial phase II studies of pemetrexed were characterized by observations of interindividual variation in tolerance. Some studies were conducted at 500mg/m² and some at 600mg/m² every 3 weeks. It would seem that measuring plasma homocysteine can identify patients at risk of serious toxicity. This is because the enzyme methionine synthase that transfers a methyl group to homocysteine in the synthesis of methionine is highly folate dependent and under conditions of functional folate stress homocysteine accumulates in the plasma. The assay of plasma homocysteine may therefore provide a useful tool for identifying patients at risk of developing severe toxicity.

mocysteine is a more sensitive indicator of folate status than is measurement of either serum or red cell folate [31, 340]. A multivariate analysis [341] of 246 patients treated with pemetrexed in various phase I and II studies between 1995 and 1999 examined the potential correlation between a number of variables and toxicity outcomes. The variables included age, gender, baseline performance status, liver enzyme levels, creatinine clearance, albumin levels, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts, area under the curve and vitamin metabolites. Plasma homocysteine levels were highly correlated with CTC grade 4 neutropenia ($P = 0.0185$), grade 4 thrombocytopenia ($p = 0.0002$) and grade 4 neutropenia with grade 3 or 4 infection ($P = 0.0064$). Levels of homocysteine greater than 11.5 μmol/L were associated with a 300% increased risk of severe toxicity ($P = 0.0040$). Although elevated pretreatment methylmalonic acid levels were also independently predictive of grade 3 or 4 mucositis and diarrhea, homocysteine was also found to be predictive of these toxicities. These observations, together with some additional clinical experience collectively led to a decision to supplement patients treated with pemetrexed with folic acid and B12, and to give prophylactic dexamethasone. At the time this decision was made some studies were ongoing, and so some studies contain a mixture of some supplemented and some unsupplemented patients. Supplementation reduces toxicity. In the gastric phase II study [328], the initial 6 patients were treated at 500 mg/m² every 3 weeks without supplementation. In these 6 patients there were 2 treatment related deaths, a further 2 patients discontinued due to hematologic toxicity and 5 patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. The remaining 32 patients were supplemented with folic acid (not B12). There were no discontinuations due to hematologic toxicity and the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity fell to 37%. In this group, there was one patient who expired due to hepatic failure, although it was unclear if this was disease or drug related. The phase III study of single agent pemetrexed in mesothelioma was also supplemented during the course of the study; after 117 patients had been treated. The data set was analyzed by a comparison of the relative risk of toxicity in the whole randomized population compared with the population supplemented with folic acid and B12 [342]. The relative risk of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia

These data suggest that at least to some extent, those patients at risk of developing severe toxicity with pemetrexed can be identified on the basis of their homocysteine levels. To what extent are there data suggesting that response might also be predicted? These studies are still in their

infancy. However, one investigation of freshly explanted tumor biopsies suggests that low expression of GARFT (but not TS or DHFR) may predict for sensitivity to pemetrexed [343]. The outcome of an ongoing study in breast cancer [344] in which changes in levels of expression of TS, GARFT, c-erb-B2 and p53 with pemetrexed treatment is awaited with interest.

It would seem that pemetrexed has broad clinical activity and a manageable toxicity profile with folate and B12 supplementation. Indeed, the spectrum of clinical activity would appear to be broader than most other antifolates. In addition, pemetrexed has efficacy in patients that are either resistant to or have failed other therapies [311, 330]. This latter observation is consistent with the preclinical data demonstrating activity in resistant cell lines. Targeting multiple enzymes may indeed be a good thing.

Conclusion

Over 40 years of clinical study has firmly established the place of antifolates in the treatment of a number of malignancies. What have we learned about the clinically important characteristics of the molecules? It is clear that activity is not the preserve of a single target. DHFR antagonists are efficacious, with MTX the prima facie example. The TS inhibitor, raltitrexed has a marketing authorization for colorectal cancer in a number of countries based on data from the initial randomized trials against 5FU. Of course the clinical activity of 5FU itself represents prior proof of concept for a specific inhibitor of TS. The value of inhibiting purine biosynthesis remains unproven since even phase II data for the inhibitors are lacking. The notion that multiple targets may have greater clinical utility than one is intriguing. Pemetrexed has both broad activity and the ability to circumvent resistance, which raises the question as to whether target promiscuity equates to broad clinical activity? This is clearly a key question in antifolate design. Unfortunately, this question together with the others posed at the beginning of this review as to the relative importance of substrate specificity for the RFC, FBP and for

FPGS, pharmacokinetics, and titration of therapies to individual patients based on molecular characteristics, can only be addressed by yet more mature clinical data, including laboratory-clinical correlative studies. Despite 50 years of research in this field, still more is needed. It is perhaps therefore unsurprising that so many scientists and physicians have spent their careers researching this interesting and clinically useful class of drugs in an attempt to improve the outcome for cancer patients [345].
