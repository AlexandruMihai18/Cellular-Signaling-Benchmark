## ABSTRACT: Macrophages, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and their interactions have key roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. In atheroma development, the phenotype of macrophages and SMCs change, which may influence the disease progression. Accumulating data on the phenotypes exhibited by these cells within atherosclerotic lesions raise many questions regarding the mechanisms and factors that might control the transition of cell phenotype. SMCs often reside in vascular lesions in close proximity to macrophage clusters and are most likely influenced by factors released from these proinflammatory phagocytes. Moreover, macrophages may be influenced by direct contact with SMCs or soluble factors released by these cells. Macrophages may promote activation and induce proatherogenic functions of SMCs, and SMCs may modulate macrophage phenotype. Addressing the mechanisms involved in SMC-macrophage crosstalk that lead to phenotypic modulation of both cell types may provide new insight into atherogenesis and new targets for therapies of various vascular diseases.

## KEY WORDS: smooth muscle cells, monocytes/macrophages, cell crosstalk, fractalkine, atherosclerosis

### I. INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and is predicted to remain so. Atherosclerosis, the major cause of cardiovascular disease, is a systemic inflammatory disease resulting from an imbalance in lipid metabolism and a dysfunctional immune response. Progression of the atherosclerotic lesion is a multifaceted process that involves participation of different cell types, a multitude of signaling molecules, and a complex interplay between inflammatory factors present in the arterial wall, as well as genetic and environmental variables that promote lesion growth and plaque instability.

An important role in the evolution of atherosclerotic plaque is played by the interactions between inflammatory cells and the cells residing in the arterial wall. In the first stage, endothelial cell activation and dysfunction are critical elements in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic disease. Therefore, as a reaction to intimal lipid accumulation, disturbed blood flow, or other different agonists, endothelial cells recruit leukocytes (monocytes, T cells) and facilitate their migration to the subendothelium² (Fig. 1). When monocytes arrive in the intima, dependent on the specific micro-media of the intimal space, they become activated and differentiate into macrophages. In response to different exogen or endogen agonists, the accumulated monocytes/macrophages produce proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbating local inflammation and leading to the development and progression of atherosclerosis.³ Moreover, in the subendothelium, monocytes and macrophages encounter smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which may be present in the human arterial wall in areas of intimal thickening or may be recruited from the vessel medial layer by the chemokines present in the inflamed vessel wall (Fig. 1). In the evolution of atherosclerosis, intimal SMCs can proliferate, favoring the fibrous cap formation (a structure associated with plaque stability); change their phenotype in a secretory one; or undergo apoptosis, thus contributing to plaque vulnerability and rupture.⁴ These important phenotypic changes in

SMCs are caused by a dysfunctional endothelium, different inflammatory triggers, and perhaps by SMCs interacting with macrophages. Therefore, as the monocytes cross the endothelium and transmigrate in the intima, where they differentiate in the macrophages, they may encounter resident SMCs or SMCs that have migrated from the media, and their interaction may have an important role in the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions.

SMCs are the major component of the vascular wall and are characterized by their high plasticity. In normal conditions, SMCs are contractile and respond to changes in blood flow and pressure. In an atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment, SMCs switch their contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype. SMCs with a synthetic phenotype have an increased capacity to proliferate, migrate, and express different adhesion molecules, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and so on—processes that mediate the progression of atherogenesis (Fig. 1).

Macrophages are immune cells that maintain tissue homeostasis by phagocytosis and by killing invading pathogens, by presenting and processing antigens, and by releasing mediators of inflammation. According to the features of the tissue microenvironment, upon differentiation macrophages acquire specific functions that dictate their future behavior.

In atherogenesis, the macrophages are the most numerous among leukocytes and, along with SMCs, are the most important cellular contributors to the atherosclerotic lesion’s physical size. By expressing diverse inflammatory molecules and scavenger receptors, the inflammatory macrophages from the intima influence the fate of atherosclerotic plaque. The pattern recognition receptors expressed on the macrophage membrane recognize various native and oxidized lipoproteins and facilitate their uptake and the formation of foam cells (Fig. 1). Moreover, uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles such as oxidized LDL leads to the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, which can activate the inflammasome, and leads further to interleukin (IL)-1β secretion. In addition, different components of modified LDL can bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activate

different intracellular signaling cascades that promote the expression of inflammatory molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, oxidases, and costimulatory molecules. The production of these inflammatory/atherogenic molecules that control the subsequent macrophage phenotype may also affect the SMC phenotype.

The role of direct or indirect communication of SMCs with monocytes/macrophages in early lesion initiation and the effect of this interaction on the progression of vascular diseases has not been extensively reviewed. Here we review the available evidence of how monocytes that infiltrate in the inflamed vessel wall and become macrophages communicate with intimal SMCs, the effect of this communication on monocyte/macrophage and SMC phenotype, and the fate of these cell types during the progression of atherosclerotic lesions.

II. PHENOTYPIC MODULATION OF MONOCYTE/MACROPHAGE AND SMCs AS A RESULT OF THEIR CROSSTALK

A. Phenotypic Modulation of Monocytes

Under conditions of endothelial cell activation, monocytes adhere to endothelial cells and are recruited into the vessel wall. Continuous influx of monocytes into the vessel wall is a key process of the chronic inflammation, characteristic of atherosclerotic plaque. After they transmigrate the endothelium, monocytes are exposed to the factors present in the vessel wall, may interact with the cells present in the atherosclerotic plaque, and become activated monocytes/macrophages.

Human monocytes in peripheral blood are divided into three major subsets on the basis of the surface expression of CD14 and CD16: (1) classical (inflammatory) CD14<sup>++</sup> CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes (approximately 90% of all circulating monocytes), (2) nonclassical CD14<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>++</sup>, and (3) intermediary type CD14<sup>++</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup>. These monocyte subsets display differential expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors known to be important for monocyte adhesion and recruitment

The Role of Monocytes/Macrophages and SMCs Cross-talk in Atherosclerosis

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of the interaction between smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and monocytes/macrophages in the atherosclerotic process. In response to plasma lipoproteins (LDL), disturbed blood flow, or other agonists, endothelial cells (ECs) become activated, express increased amounts of cell adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1], fractalkine, etc.), and recruit monocytes and T cells. The specific microenvironment present in the intima (modified LDL, cytokines, etc.) promotes the differentiation of monocytes in macrophages (MΦ), which express diverse inflammatory molecules and scavenger receptors. The pattern recognition receptors present on the macrophages mediate the uptake of various native and oxidized lipoproteins, facilitating the formation of foam cells. In addition, the macrophages can interact with resident SMCs or SMCs migrated from the intima by specific ligand receptor binding, causing changes in the phenotype of both cell types, lipid transfer from macrophage to SMCs, and plaque progression.

in different inflammatory diseases. Interestingly, CD14⁺⁺ CD16⁻ monocytes express the chemokine receptor CCR2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1 receptor), whereas CD14⁺ CD16⁺⁺ monocytes do not express it, but both subsets express the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor (fractalkine receptor). The CX3CR1 receptor seems to be important for the patrolling behavior of monocytes along endothelial cell surfaces,³ in monocyte/macrophage survival,¹⁵ and mediating the crosstalk between monocytes/macrophages and SMCs in atherosclerotic plaque.¹⁶

Inflammatory monocytes produce proinflammatory cytokines, professional phagocytes that uptake LDL and generate reactive oxygen species.¹⁷ Nonclassical monocytes do not respond to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), but they respond to viruses and endogenous nucleic acids via TLR7

Volume 24, Number 4, 2014
and TLR8 receptors.¹⁸ They patrol in the blood vessels and produce proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor; they also participate in tissue remodeling.¹⁹ Intermediate monocytes display an inflammatory phenotype with a high capacity to produce and release IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in response to LPS.¹⁸ Moreover, these monocytes possess high efficiency to stimulate CD4 T-cell proliferation and proangiogenic capacity.²⁰

Therefore, classical, intermediary, and nonclassical monocytes differ significantly in phenotype and function. After they cross the endothelium and arrive in the vessel wall, classical monocytes differentiate into a phenotype consistent with inflammatory macrophages and inflammatory dendritic cells. The phenotype of these cells is modulated by lipid uptake, TLR ligands, growth factors, and cytokines/chemokines. In addition to these agonists, we and others have shown that the monocyte phenotype can also be modulated by direct interaction with SMCs.¹¹,¹⁶–²² Thus the interaction between monocytes and SMCs enhances monocyte procoagulant activity and production of atherosclerosis-related factors such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, IL-6, and MCP-1²¹ (Fig. 2). Moreover, the coculture of monocytes or LPS-activated monocytes with SMCs induces activation of monocytes that express increased concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CX3CR1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 gene and protein¹⁶ (Fig. 2). Expression of CD36 and resistin is also upregulated in interacted monocytes compared with control monocytes.²²,²³ All these inflammatory molecules, which are increased due to coculture of monocytes with SMCs, can modify the monocyte phenotype toward macrophages, aggravate the inflammatory response, and contribute to the progression of atherosclerotic plaque.

Interestingly, as a result of monocyte interaction with SMCs, monocytes may even change their phenotype in smooth muscle-like cells. A recent study found that the environmental conditions provided by coculture between SMCs and monocytes resulted in the differentiation of monocytes to smooth muscle-like cells with mesenchymal/

fibroblastic characteristics. These cells maintain their myeloid lineage by CD14 marker expression but they also express collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin, and calponin (found in SMCs) and exhibit additional phenotypic changes.²⁴

In addition to phenotypic changes, the adhesive interactions between vascular SMCs and monocytes contribute to subendothelial monocyte-macrophage survival and retention in the atherosclerotic lesion,²⁵ a process dependent on the CX3CR1 receptor.²⁶ Therefore, treatment of Apoe−/− mice with a CX3CR1 antagonist reduced CX3CR1-dependent inflammatory monocyte survival.²⁶ We recently found that oxidative stress (as measured by detection of reactive oxygen species) was significantly decreased in monocytes after their interactions with SMCs²² and that monocytes were protected from apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effects on monocytes caused by SMC-monocyte interaction were dependent on Bcl-2 expression (a key antiapoptotic protein; Fig. 2), which caused a time-dependent increase in monocytes as a result of their binding to SMCs.²⁵ Protection of monocytes against apoptosis, which is induced by cell interaction, was partially blocked by preincubation of SMCs with anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, a cell adhesion molecule that mediates the adhesive interactions between SMCs and monocytes.²³ In addition to VCAM-1 binding to very late antigen-4 (VLA4), the binding of fractalkine to its receptor CX3CR1 could also be involved in mediating the adhesive interaction between SMCs and monocytes/macrophages, which further leads to antiapoptotic effects on monocytes. Thus Landsman et al.¹⁵ observed the enforced survival of monocytes and foam cells in CX3CR1 knockout mice that restored atherogenesis, suggesting that CX3CL1- and CX3CR1-mediated survival signals are critical for atheroma formation and progression.

Therefore, physical contact of monocytes with intimal vascular SMCs may represent a key mechanism in preventing migrated monocytes from apoptosis and thereby favors their activation and abnormal accumulation. The retention and survival of monocytes along with monocyte differentiation

Following the direct interaction between fractalkine–CX3CR1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)–VLA4, and other ligand receptors, the cells become activated, switch their phenotype by producing different inflammatory molecules (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1β, monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP]-1, CX3CR1, matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, CD36, resistin) and may promote lipid transfer from macrophages to SMCs. Moreover, the cell cross-talk induces monocyte survival and retention as well as foam cell formation and affects SMC proliferation and migration. EC, endothelial cell; oxLDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein.**

toward macrophages induced by cell–cell interactions are important events that facilitate the progression of atherosclerosis.

**B. Phenotypic Modulation of Macrophages**

Macrophages are the major cell type of early atherosclerotic lesions and play important roles in all stages of plaque formation. They ingest lipoprotein particles, giving rise to foam cells, and may contribute to the atherogenic process by regulating lipid metabolism and by controlling inflammatory responses and the clearance of dead cells.²⁷ They participate to the evolution of the atherosclerotic plaque by secreting cytokines, reactive oxygen species, nitrogen species, and metalloproteinases. In atherosclerotic lesions, the macrophage phenotype is variable; macrophages can be found as large, lipid-laden foam cells, activated macrophages, or small inflammatory cells. The classical macrophage heterogeneity distinguishes between either proinflammatory M1 macrophages or anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. The most utilized growth factor to produce macrophages *in vitro* is macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which may generate unpolarized (M0) macrophages

Volume 24, Number 4, 2014

from monocytes. If M0 macrophages are treated with bacterial compounds (LPS) or inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (classically activated), they polarize to the M1 phenotype and have the capacity to increase and sustain the ongoing inflammatory response via production of inflammation-promoting mediators (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12).<sup>19</sup> If M0 macrophages are treated with IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13 (alternatively activated), they polarize to M2 macrophages that present a predominantly anti-inflammatory phenotype, express high levels of scavenger receptors, and promote tissue repair and healing.<sup>28</sup> Glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone secreted postprandially from L cells, was recently found to induce macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype.<sup>29</sup> Moreover, endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by alternative stimulation is essential to generate the M2 phenotype.<sup>30</sup>

Based on results of *in vitro* experiments, M2 macrophages are further divided into M2a, M2b, and M2c macrophages.<sup>31</sup> The M2a and M2b macrophages have immune regulatory functions, control Th2 responses, and are induced by activation of macrophages with IL-4 or IL-13 (M2a) and by immune complexes, TLR stimulation, or IL-1RA (M2b). The M2c macrophages have roles in suppressing immune responses and in promoting tissue remodeling<sup>31</sup> and are induced by exposure of macrophages to IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, or glucocorticoids. Remarkably, macrophage activation takes place concomitant with profound transcriptional reprogramming. A recent study identified a large and unique transcriptomic data set of human macrophage activation that revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending beyond the current M1 versus M2 polarization model.<sup>32</sup> These transcriptomic data represent an essential step forward in understanding how macrophages integrate and compute signals from their local microenvironment under different inflammatory conditions.

Regarding the macrophage phenotypes found in atherosclerosis, until now it has been thought that they are likely the result of both lineage commitment and phenotypic changes in response to

their specific environment.<sup>33</sup> Changes in macrophage phenotype and function within atherosclerotic plaque may have profound consequences for plaque evolution, including plaque rupture and thrombosis. Although the crosstalk of macrophages with surrounding cells can dictate the macrophage phenotype, it is now known whether SMCs are able to directly modulate them, especially in the early stages of atherogenesis. In our studies we investigated the communication between monocytes/macrophages and SMCs both in direct contact or by soluble factors. Thus we used LPS-activated monocytes that were cocultured with SMCs and found a supplementary induction of the analyzed atherogenic molecules (TNF-α, CX-3CR1, MMP-9, and resistin) compared with the results obtained when monocytes were cocultured with SMCs.<sup>16,22</sup> Another group found that TGF-β produced by SMCs is a critical mediator of SMC-induced macrophage phenotypic modulation.<sup>34</sup> Thus macrophages exposed to conditioned media from SMCs exhibit increased expression of CCL-5, IL-6, IL-12a, CCR3, CCR7,<sup>34</sup> and LDL receptor.<sup>35</sup> These data suggest that the crosstalk between macrophages and SMCs may induce an inflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype, but further experiments need to be done to clarify this matter.

Interesting results were found in another recent study in which the authors questioned whether a direct transfer of molecules between macrophages and SMCs could occur. The answer was that lysosomes loaded with acetylated LDL or cholesterol are transported from macrophages into SMCs and modulate the behavior of the SMCs; these results provide new insights on the effects of the direct communication between these cells and on the cells’ subsequent behavior<sup>36</sup> (Fig 2).

### C. Phenotypic Modulation of SMCs

In normal vessels the majority of SMCs are located in the medial layer of arteries and are contractile cells with an important role in maintaining vascular tone and resistance. In the human vessel wall some SMCs are also present within the intima in areas known as “intimal thickenings”—areas that

consist of SMCs and proteoglycans.² In atherosclerosis a significant number of SMCs are found in the arterial vessels intima, and some of them originate from SMCs that migrated from the vessel medial layer. It is generally accepted that SMCs, because of their phenotypic modulation from a “contractile” phenotype to a “synthetic” phenotype, are key participants in atherosclerosis evolution and have a key role in the stage associated with fibrous plaque formation.² As a result of phenotype modification, the genes that define the contractile SMCs are suppressed and the inflammatory molecules are upregulated, leading to proliferation, migration, and increased matrix production by SMCs.³⁷ These processes contribute to increases in the overall size of and inflammation in the early atherosclerotic plaques, whereas in advanced lesions they can promote formation of a thick, fibrous cap and thus lead to more stable plaque.³⁸ In human atherosclerotic lesions medial SMCs preponderantly express proteins involved in the contractile function of the cell, such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, smooth muscle α-actin, vimentin, calponin, transgelin, and desmin, whereas the SMCs found in the intima express lower levels of these proteins, have a higher proliferative index, and have a high capacity to express proteases and inflammatory molecules.³⁹ However, a proteomic analysis of media layers from human atherosclerotic and preatherosclerotic coronary arteries isolated by laser microdissection revealed that even medial vascular SMCs switch from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype *in vivo*. Thus, 12 altered proteins were found in medial SMCs of the atherosclerotic coronary arteries, 5 of which were cytoskeleton proteins with decreased expression.⁴⁰ Interestingly, upon phenotype switching, SMCs may display functions normally attributed to other cell types such as endothelial cells, macrophages, and other immune cells. Like endothelial cells, SMCs can express different adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, intracellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1, fractalkine) that mediate the adhesion and migration of monocytes and lymphocytes into the vessel wall⁴¹ and protect SMCs against apoptosis,⁴² thus contributing to the early cellularity of the lesion. Like macrophages,

SMCs with a changed phenotype may express a variety of receptors for lipid uptake and can form foamlike cells,⁴³ contributing to the accumulation of plaque lipids. Like other immune cells within the developing plaque, SMCs could produce different inflammatory molecules that contribute to the initiation and exacerbation of the inflammatory response. Therefore, studies of human and experimental models of atherosclerosis revealed that SMCs can switch to a “proinflammatory” phenotype, secrete cytokines, and express cell adhesion molecules such as IL-8, CCL20, IL-6, CXCL6, and VCAM-1, which may functionally regulate monocyte and macrophage adhesion and other processes during atherosclerosis.⁴⁴ Moreover, SMCs acquire features of lymphoid tissue organizers and may participate in the formation of tertiary lymphoid tissue in atherosclerosis by upregulating lymphorganogenic chemokines CCL7, CCL9, CXCL13, CCL19, CXCL16, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which are involved in T-lymphocyte, B-lymphocyte, and macrophage/dendritic cell attraction.⁴⁵

The majority of these results of SMC phenotype modulation are obtained *in vitro*, in cultured SMCs exposed to different agonists (IL-1β, platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], lipids, TNF-α, resistin).¹⁸,⁴⁶,⁴⁷ The accumulating data suggest that even the communication between cells from atherosclerotic plaque can modulate the SMC phenotype. Therefore, exposing human aortic SMCs to conditioned media from THP-1-derived macrophages substantially promoted SMC proliferation and migration.⁴⁸ In addition to influencing the proliferation rate, the interaction between SMCs and monocytes/macrophages led to overexpression of different inflammatory and atherogenic molecules. Therefore coculture experiments showed that both direct contact and soluble factors contribute to MMP-1 production²¹ (Fig. 2). Neutralizing anti-IL-6 and TNF-α antibodies inhibited MMP-1 production in conditioned medium from vascular SMCs and monocytes/macrophages coculture. Using the same coculture model, Roy et al.⁴⁹ studied the effects of macrophage-conditioned media on SMCs and found increased expression of bradykinin B1 receptor on SMCs, dependent on a macrophage-

mediated mechanism. In a direct contact model of interaction, the IL-6 and MCP-1 concentrations were significantly enhanced in the supernatant of SMC–monocyte cocultures compared with cytokine production in the supernatant of SMCs or monocytes cultured separately.⁵⁰ We also used a direct model of interaction between monocytes and SMCs; we separated the cells after their interaction and analyzed them individually. We found that SMCs were profoundly affected by this direct contact. Thus the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CX3CR1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, as well as reactive oxygen species, were increased in SMCs separated from monocytes (after their coculture) (Fig. 2); all these changes attest to the modification of the SMC phenotype.¹⁶ The phenotypic alteration of the vascular SMC toward a foamlike cell was also investigated and it was found that binding of β-very LDLs to SMCs and the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol was enhanced by the presence of macrophages.⁵¹ This effect was accompanied by decreased activity of lipid-metabolizing enzymes (neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase and acid cholesteryl ester hydrolase) in SMCs, showing that macrophages have a direct effect on the lipid-metabolizing enzymes of SMCs. It was revealed more recently that the direct interaction between macrophages and SMCs mediates lysosomal transfer from macrophages to vascular SMCs, leading to an SMC–foamlike cell phenotype.³⁶ Moreover, macrophages promoted calcification of vascular SMCs via secreted soluble factors such as reactive oxygen species in an SMC/macrophage transwell coculture treated with Triol.⁵² All these data provide *in vitro* evidence of the secretory phenotype of SMCs induced by the crosstalk between monocytes/macrophages and SMCs.

Although there is evidence from our studies and similar studies by other groups that the direct or indirect communication between monocytes/ macrophages and SMCs may occur and induce phenotypic switching of both cultured SMCs or monocytes/macrophages,¹⁶,²³,³⁶ there is a lack of clear evidence that this happens *in vivo*.

### III. MEDIATORS OF MONOCYTE/MACROPHAGE–SMC INTERACTIONS

The adhesive interaction between monocytes/macrophages and SMCs are mediated by ligand–receptor binding. Since in atherosclerotic lesions vascular SMCs exhibit increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules and chemokines and the monocytes/macrophages express their specific ligands, these ligand–receptor pairs are likely susceptible to mediating the direct monocyte–SMC interaction. Until now, the direct contact between SMCs and monocytes was thought to be mediated by binding of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and fractalkine to their specific receptors, VLA4, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), and CX3CR1, respectively.¹⁶,²³,²⁵ Macrophages (like monocytes) express the integrins VLA4, LFA-1, and the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1; they also can bind to SMCs using these molecules. At least for fractalkine–CX3CR1, our results showed that silencing CX3CR1 in LPS-activated monocytes before coculture with SMCs significantly reduced the expression of TNF-α and MMP-9.¹⁶ Moreover, macrophages seem to communicate with SMC by the Fas–Fas ligand axis. Therefore, binding of membrane-bound Fas expressed on macrophages with Fas-ligand on SMCs is in part responsible for human vascular SMC apoptosis induced by human macrophages, a process that may further promote plaque rupture.¹²

#### A. VCAM-1 and VLA4

VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 belong to an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of adhesion molecules, and their modulation and function in endothelial cells have been well described.⁵³ Their specific ligands, VLA4 and LFA-1, respectively, are integrins located on polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Both Igs and integrins are induced in response to inflammatory cytokines and promote interactions between endothelial cell and monocytes and/or lymphocytes. Different agonists induce expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on human SMCs, thus facilitating their interaction with leukocytes by these ligand–

receptor axes.⁵⁴,⁵⁵ Moreover, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were shown to be expressed by intimal SMCs within the atherosclerotic lesions of mice and humans, but they were not found in medial SMCs from healthy subjects.⁵³,⁵⁶

Binding of monocytes to vascular SMCs by Ig-integrin pairs was studied using monoclonal antibodies to human integrin 1 or 2, which were used to determine the functional role of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in this process. The results revealed that both β1- and β2-integrin interactions, but not a nonspecific control IgG, mediated binding of monocytes to SMCs induced by angiotensin-II and PDGF-BB.²³ Moreover, the protection of monocytes from apoptosis, mediated by binding to SMCs, was partially antagonized by preincubating SMCs with a VCAM-1-blocking antibody but not with an ICAM-1 antibody or control nonspecific IgG.²⁵ The same authors found that the induction of CD36 expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation by cell-cell crosstalk was also dependent on VCAM-1. These results suggest that VCAM-1/integrin signaling may be involved in binding-mediated protection of monocytes from apoptosis via upregulation of CD36 and activation of ERK1/2.

### B. Fractalkine-CX3CR1

CX3CL1 (or fractalkine) is a structurally and functionally unique chemokine with a recognized role in atherosclerosis; it exists in both transmembrane and soluble form. In its membrane-bound form, it facilitates firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial cells, whereas in its soluble form, it acts as a chemoattractant for CX3CR1-expressing cells. Fractalkine and its specific receptor CX3CR1 mediate critical physiological events during inflammatory responses and have an important role in many diseases.⁵⁷

Antiapoptotic and proliferative effects of fractalkine on human SMCs via epidermal growth factor receptor signaling were recently found.⁴² These data may have important implications in atherosclerosis, where the balance between SMC apoptosis and proliferation dictates the stability of

the plaque and supports the data discussed below, showing the implication of fractalkine in monocytes' survival.

Since *in vitro* studies showed that CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 mediate heterotypic anchorage of foam cells to aortic SMCs⁴¹ and immunocytochemistry showed that within the human atherosclerotic plaque CX3CL1 on SMC colocalizes with macrophage CX3CR1,⁵⁸ in a previous study we questioned whether fractalkine might mediate the communication between these two cellular types. The experimental data revealed that monocytes interact with SMCs by fractalkine–CX3CR1, and the cellular signaling induced by the crosstalk may induce an inflammatory response.¹⁶ Therefore, we found that different inflammatory and atherogenic molecules were upregulated as a result of direct cell–cell communication, and, interestingly, only some of them were induced by dependence on the fractalkine–CX3CR1 axis. If monocytes were preincubated with a blocking antibody to CX3CR1 before cell interaction, the expression of TNF-α, MMP-9, and CX3CR1—but not IL-6, IL-1β, or MMP2—was significantly decreased on both types of cells.¹⁶

All these results uncover the potential of this chemokine/chemokine receptor pair to mediate the direct communication between monocytes/macrophages and SMCs and indicate this axis as an inflammatory target for therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular diseases.

### IV. SIGNALING MECHANISM TRIGGERED BY MONOCYTE/MACROPHAGE AND SMC CROSSTALK

Although inflammation has been postulated to play a critical role in all stages of atherogenesis, the regulatory mechanisms of the inflammatory process in atherosclerotic plaque are still not completely understood. Different proinflammatory cytokines participate in atherosclerotic plaque development, growth, and rupture.¹ Cytokines interact with specific receptors in target cells by phosphorylating different protein kinases associated with the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors, which
leads to the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, JAK/STAT, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and other transcription factors.⁵⁹ The main proinflammatory effect triggered by the activation of these transcription factors is protein neosynthesis.

As we discuss below, the direct or indirect cross-talk between monocytes and SMCs may induce modification of both cell types. The signaling mechanism involved in regulation of different molecules and processes in monocytes and SMCs is a result of direct ligand–receptor interaction. Thus, binding of fractalkine to CX3CR1, VCAM-1 to VLA4, and other soluble factors found in the conditioned medium of the cocultured cells to their specific receptors on monocytes or SMCs activates different signaling pathways. Until now, some important signaling molecules were modified as a result of monocyte–SMC communication. Increased phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was found in bound and unbound monocytes cocultured with SMCs when compared with monocytes cultured alone, indicating that both direct binding as well as soluble factors released from the cocultures were responsible for activating monocyte kinases. Although both kinases were activated by cell coculture, only the ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) blocked CD36 expression induced on monocytes as a result of monocytes’ interaction with SMCs.²³ In the same article, the authors found that cell communication protects monocytes against apoptosis by a different signaling mechanism, one independent of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK activation. The results showed that after binding monocytes to human SMCs, the antiapoptotic kinase Akt and its downstream targets were phosphorylated and Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein expression was enhanced (Fig. 2). In a previous paper we noted that the SMC–monocyte interaction activates the p38MAPK in each cell type.¹⁶ The p38MAPK was also involved in phenotypic modulation of macrophages by SMC-derived TGF-β.³⁴ Downstream of p38MAPK there are inducible transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB. Using small interfering RNA technology, we found that silencing of p65 led to the downregulation of IL-6 and IL-1β, whereas silencing of c-jun led to downregulation of TNF-α, CX3CR1,

and MMP-9. Interestingly, AP-1 was involved in the modulation of molecules that was CX3CL1-CX3CR1 dependent, suggesting that this pair triggers the signaling pathway that leads to activation of AP-1 in SMCs.¹⁶

Other signaling molecules activated by monocyte–SMC communication were revealed by a study that showed that treatment of human aortic SMCs with angiotensin-II or PDGF-BB increases binding to human monocytes, dependent on β1- and β2-integrins. The adhesion of monocytes to SMCs was also attenuated when the SMC arachidonic acid metabolism was blocked with inhibitors of 12/15-lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase-2 by a mechanism dependent on activation of downstream molecules Src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and MAPKs.²⁵

In addition to NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathways, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is a critical regulator of the inflammatory processes in various vascular cells and is involved in switching of the SMC phenotype from contractile to synthetic.⁶⁰,⁶¹ Different receptors/ligands, including cytokines, interferons, and neurohumoral factors, as well as mechanical stress and oxidative stress, activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and modify the synthesis and release of proinflammatory mediators.⁶² A study exploring the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway as a result of monocyte–SMC crosstalk found increased phosphorylation of STAT3 in cocultures compared with SMCs cultured alone; this increased phosphorylation led to the synergistic production of IL-6 and MCP-1.⁵⁰ We found that the direct interaction between LPS-activated monocytes and SMCs increased STAT3 transcription factor activity by increasing STAT3 phosphorylation and decreasing SOCS3 expression in both SMCs and monocytes. Activation of STAT3 by cell crosstalk induced resistin expression in monocytes and intracellular reactive oxygen species in SMCs.²²

### V. THERAPEUTIC PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSIONS

Cell–cell interactions determine each cell’s fate under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
The Role of Monocytes/Macrophages and SMCs Cross-talk in Atherosclerosis

These studies showed that leukocyte adhesion to arterial endothelia was significantly reduced (83%) in animals lacking CX3CR1 and that neutralization of CX3CL1 activity inhibited angiotensin-II-induced mononuclear cell-human umbilical arterial endothelial cell interactions (by 73%). Another recent study showed that CX3CR1 deficiency induces an early protective inflammatory environment in ischemic mice. The extent of lipid-stained lesions in the thoracic aorta was reduced by 59% in CX3CR1/apoE double knockout mice compared with their CX3CR1+/+/apoE−/− littermates. Moreover, the development of atherosclerosis in the aortic sinus was diminished in the double knockout mice, with a 50% reduction in macrophage accumulation. These data are in accord with human data showing that the chemokine receptor mutant CX3CR1-M280 has impaired adhesive function and correlates with protection against cardiovascular disease in humans.

Another interesting approach is to block CX3CR1 with specific antagonists. In this aspect, little progress has been made in the development and use of chemical inhibitors of CX3CR1. A specific antagonist for CX3CR1, AZ12201182, inhibited the prosurvival and mitogenic effects of CX3CL1 on vascular SMCs and blocked the induction of epieregulin messenger RNA in response to CX3CL1. Another CX3CR1 antagonist (an amino terminus-modified CX3CR1 ligand, F1) that was administered to atherogenic mice reduced the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in both Apoe−/− and Ldlr−/− mouse models. Interestingly, macrophage accumulation in the aortic sinus and the size of the atherosclerotic lesion were reduced in Apoe−/− mice treated with F1. These compounds may be interesting and useful tools for further analysis of CX3CR1 function and can provide a valuable therapeutic method of CX3CR1 blockade.

Since the absence of a functional VCAM-1 gene results in embryonic death, in the case of VCAM-1, the possibilities to interrupt its binding to its receptor are limited to the use of specific antibodies or antagonists. Blocking endothelial VCAM-1 with a specific antibody reduced monocyte adhesion by 75% and increased monocyte

conditions. Cellular communication can be mediated by the release of soluble factors, as well as by direct contact, and can affect cell proliferation, differentiation, death, adhesion, motility, local inflammation, and redox status. While direct contact between endothelial cells and SMCs at the level of the myoendothelial cell junction is an important physiological process that regulates vascular tone and homeostasis, how the interaction between SMCs and monocytes or macrophages may influence vascular pathophysiology is still not clear. However, Koga and Aikawa noted that the interchangeability of macrophages and SMCs and their crosstalk recommends these cells as contributors to vascular disease progression in a more coordinated and intertwined fashion than was supposed until now.

To date, most of the results of monocyte/macrophage crosstalk with SMCs are *in vitro* data; therefore, future *in vivo* and in-human studies are needed to validate the *in vitro* data and to clarify their relevance for atherosclerosis evolution.

The data that we reviewed in this article support the idea that SMC-monocyte communication in coculture induces proinflammatory phenotypic alteration of both monocytes and vascular SMCs. These events, which may occur in the microenvironment of the plaque (where other proatherogenic and proinflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and so on are present), may prevent the favorable resolution of inflammatory processes, with important consequences for the health of the individual. In this context, the development of therapeutic approaches to control interactions between SMCs and monocytes/macrophages in atherosclerotic plaque may have an important impact in treating/reducing atherosclerotic disease. Because monocytes and SMCs can directly interact by fractalkine-CX3CR1 and VCAM-1-VLA4, a potential strategy to reduce the pathologic inflammatory process developed by cell interactions is to block these ligands and receptors from binding. To date, several studies investigated the effect of blockade of the fractalkine/CX3CR1 or VCAM-1/VLA4 binding on atherosclerosis progression using deficient mice or specific agonists/selective blocking antibodies.

rolling velocity to endothelium of isolated perfused carotid arteries from *ApoE*⁻/⁻ mice.⁶⁹ Moreover, inhibition of VLA4 by monoclonal antibodies directed at the α4 subunit reduced macrophage recruitment to atherosclerotic plaques in *ApoE*⁻/⁻ mice.⁷⁰ A recent study showed that anti-VCAM-1 antibody attenuates atherosclerosis in *ApoE*⁻/⁻ mice by reducing the adhesion of inflammatory cells and improving plaque inflammation and stability.⁷¹

Understanding the key ligands and receptors involved in monocyte/macrophage–SMC crosstalk may help to identify new therapeutic targets. Taking into account that the behavior of macrophages and SMCs has a critical influence on all lesional stages of atherosclerosis, the development of therapeutic approaches to target the communication between monocytes/macrophages and SMCs in atherosclerotic plaque may become a point of interest for researchers.
