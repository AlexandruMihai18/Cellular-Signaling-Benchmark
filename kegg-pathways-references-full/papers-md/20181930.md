Mattaliano MD, Wooters J, Shih HH, Paulsen JE. ROCK2 associates with lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 and mediates oxidized LDL-induced IL-8 production. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 298: C1180–C1187, 2010. First published February 24, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00483.2009.—Oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) is a contributing factor of endothelial dysfunction, an early cellular event during atherogenesis. In endothelial cells, OxLDL has been shown to stimulate proinflammatory responses, increase lipid accumulation, and induce the expression of adhesion and extracellular matrix degrading molecules. The primary receptor for OxLDL on endothelial cells has been identified as a member of the scavenger receptor family called lectin-like OxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1). A number of studies on LOX-1 have implicated its role in multiple cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of LOX-1 in endothelial cells, we identified interacting proteins in an affinity-purified LOX-1 receptor complex from human aortic endothelial HAECT cells by mass spectrometry. Two molecules involved in Rho signaling pathway, ARHGEF1 and ROCK2, were identified, and their associations with LOX-1 were confirmed in reciprocal immunoprecipitation studies. Particularly, ROCK2 was found to dynamically associate with LOX-1 in the presence of OxLDL. In addition, OxLDL treatment stimulated ROCK2 catalytic activity, and ROCK2 inhibition attenuated NF-κB activation and IL-8 production resulting from OxLDL activation of LOX-1. In summary, a functional proteomics approach has enabled us to identify novel LOX-1 interactors that potentially contribute to the cellular and signaling functions of LOX-1.

tein that is known to recognize a wide array of structurally distinct ligands besides OxLDL. These include activated platelets, advanced glycation end products (AGE), apoptotic bodies, bacteria, and C-reactive protein (CRP) (20, 23, 32). Several lines of evidence support a role of LOX-1 in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Genetically, LOX-1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (20). Furthermore, several studies have shown that LOX-1 expression correlates with the pathology. In normal endothelium LOX-1 is expressed at low levels, whereas pathological states such as atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, and hypertension dramatically increase LOX-1 expression. Inflammatory and atherogenic stimulating molecules, including OxLDL, AGE, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), have been shown to induce LOX-1 expression (20). In humans, increased LOX-1 expression can be detected in atherosclerotic lesions, and treatment with antiatherosclerotic statin drugs represses LOX-1 expression. In addition to the correlation of LOX-1 expression with atherosclerosis, a functional association of LOX-1 with atherogenesis has been demonstrated in mouse models of atherosclerosis. The deletion of LOX-1 causes a significant reduction in atherogenesis in LDLR null mice on a high-cholesterol diet, whereas LOX-1 overexpression in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) null mice leads to intramyocardial vasculopathy (14, 21). Collectively, these studies support an important role of LOX-1 in atherogenesis.

One potential mechanism by which LOX-1 contributes to atherogenesis is through endothelial dysfunction. In the absence of LOX-1, LDLR-deficient mice retain normal endothelial function in response to the challenge of a high-fat diet (21). Several studies have implicated a number of intracellular signaling events downstream from LOX-1 activation that mediate its suggested role in endothelial dysfunction (9, 31). OxLDL stimulation of LOX-1 leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anion, which inactivates nitric oxide (NO) while reducing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, resulting in the disruption of vascular homeostasis. Also, LOX-1 activation increases NF-κB activity and, consequently, the production of chemokines and adhesion molecules, including monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2), and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (19, 20), leading to the recruitment and adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium.

LOX-1 has a short 36-amino acid cytosolic tail with no homology to known catalytic or signaling domains and therefore presumably relies on associating adaptor and signal transduction proteins to transduce signals to activate downstream functions. Although AKT, PKC, MAPK, and NF-κB have been implicated as signaling molecules downstream from LOX-1 (9,

ATHEROSCLEROSIS IS A CHRONIC inflammatory disease marked by a narrowing of the arteries from lipid-rich plaques present within the walls of arterial blood vessels. Elevated serum concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a well-established risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. LDL can accumulate within the blood vessel wall and undergo modification by oxidation (16, 17). This results in a loss of recognition of LDL by the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Instead, oxidized LDL (OxLDL) binds and is internalized by members of the scavenger receptor family expressed on the surface of macrophages and endothelial cells that constitute the developing atherosclerotic plaques in the blood vessel wall. The perturbation of the balance between vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation by OxLDL leads to endothelial dysfunction, one of the earliest hallmarks of atherogenesis (11, 20, 21).

The primary receptor for OxLDL in endothelial cells is LOX-1 (20, 23). LOX-1 is a type II transmembrane glycopro-

ROCK2 ASSOCIATES WITH LOX-1

20), molecules that directly interact with LOX-1 and may be involved in initiating the signaling cascade have not been identified. Taking a functional proteomics approach, we have identified a number of adaptor and signal transduction proteins that constitute the LOX-1 receptor complex. Two molecules, ARHGEF1 (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) and ROCK2 (Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2), may be components of the Rho signaling pathway downstream from the LOX-1 receptor complex.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Antibodies and kinase inhibitors. The antibodies used in our study are LOX-1 (R&D Systems), APPL1 (Novus), ARHGEF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ROCK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Bethyl Laboratories), TJP1 (Zymed), and rabbit and goat IgG (Jackson Laboratory). ROCK inhibitors used in the study are Y-27632 [(R)-(+)-trans-4-(1-aminoethyl)-N-(4-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride monohydrate; Sigma] and fasudil HA1077 [1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)homopiperazine dihydrochloride; Sigma].

Cell culture. A total of \(1 \times 10^8\) human aortic endothelial cells from the HAECT cell line (8) per condition were plated on 500-cm² dishes and cultured as previously described (11). LOX-1 adenovirus was prepared by Viraquest, and infections to generate LOX-1-overexpressing HAECT cells were performed as previously described (19).

Immunoprecipitations. Ligand treatment was performed by incubating HAECT cells for 20 min with either OxLDL (35 μg/ml; Intracel) or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC; 100 μM; Sigma). Treated or untreated cells were washed twice in cold PBS before being lysed in lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100 (wt/vol), 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, phosphate inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2 (Sigma), Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 10 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 1.0 mM NaVO₄]. The cell lysates were briefly sonicated and then cleared by centrifuging at 16,000 rpm for 30 min. For immunoprecipitations (IPs), cell lysates were first precleared with IgG conjugated to CL6B beads (GE Life Sciences) for 90 min. For LOX-1 or control IPs, antibody-bead conjugates were added to the precleared cell lysates and rotated at 4°C for 4 h. IPs were then washed in cold lysis buffer three times, followed by two washes with PBS. Proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE. After being transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, proteins were detected by Western blotting using ECL and Super ECL (Pierce).

ROCK kinase assay. Protein concentrations of HAECT cell lysates were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein for each sample was analyzed for ROCK activity according to the manufacturer's protocol (IBL-America). Briefly, each cell lysate was incubated with a ROCK peptide substrate. The phosphorylation of the peptide substrate was detected using a phosphospecific antibody.

ELISA. Conditioned medium was collected from treated or control HAECT cells. The levels of IL-8 and CXCL2 were evaluated by ELISA according to the manufacturers' instructions (IL-8, R&D Systems; CXCL2, IBL-America).

NF-κB activity assay. The protein concentrations of HAECT cell lysates were determined as described above, and an equal amount of each sample was analyzed for NF-κB activity using NF-κB assay (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Assay plates were analyzed using a Victor³ plate reader (PerkinElmer).

Whole gel proteomic analysis. IPs were eluted from agarose beads with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the beads were filtered away. DTT was added to the eluates to a final concentration of 15 mM. The samples were heated to 80°C for 5 min before they were separated on a 10% Laemmli PAGE gel. The gel was stained with Imperial blue (Thermo Scientific) Coomassie staining, and each sample lane was vertically excised in 23 bands. Gel bands were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion using a robotic digester (Abimed) with reduction (DTT), alkylation (iodoacetamide), and modified trypsin digestion (Promega). Peptide eluates were concentrated and frozen for mass spectrometric analysis.

The trypsin digests were analyzed by on-line capillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Peptides were resolved on a 75-μm × 12-cm capillary column packed with 5-μm Everest C18 (Waters) using a gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.1 M formic acid as modifier. Peptides were eluted from the capillary column directly into an ion trap (Finnigan LTQ) using alternate full scans of 400–800 and 800–1,200 m/z with data-dependent triggering to collect collisionally induced dissociation (CID) spectra.

CID spectra were searched using Sequest (Finnigan) running on a 32-node personal computer cluster. The data was searched against the NR database as well as a decoy database consisting of the reversed sequences of NR to obtain an estimate of false discovery rate (FDR). Peptide sequences meeting the validation criteria were compiled into protein consensi using in-house software (DYNAMMID). The target FDR in these studies was 4%, and the scoring parameters returned by Sequest (Xcorr and Delta Cn) were adjusted appropriately for each charge state to achieve an FDR of 4% uniformly. In these experiments, a sham IP (nonimmune IgG) was used as a control, and the hundreds of proteins detected in that sample were subtracted from the protein lists from the LOX-1 IPs. DYNAMMID allows separate validation criteria to be applied to samples and controls. In this study, consensi from LOX-1 IP required a minimum of two distinct peptide sequences for a present call in at least one condition. As noted above, all peptides in the analysis met the 4% FDR threshold scores.

For data analysis, the data were compiled from triplicate samples from three or more separate experiments. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was performed using Statview JMP software.

RESULTS

LOX-1-associated proteins are identified from aortic endothelial HAECT cells. We used a mass spectrometry (MS)-based affinity proteomics approach to identify cytosolic proteins and signal transduction molecules that associate with LOX-1 in basal and ligand-stimulated conditions. LOX-1 is normally expressed at low levels in endothelial cells. Therefore, to maximize the chance for capturing LOX-1-interacting proteins, we used adenovirus to overexpress LOX-1 in a human aortic endothelial cell line, HAECT cells (8), and affinity purified the LOX-1 receptor complex by IP with an anti-LOX-1 antibody. A control IP was also carried out using a species-matched nonimmune IgG. The experimental conditions included both untreated HAECT-LOX-1 cells and cells treated with LOX-1

ligands OxLDL and LPC, a lipid-component of OxLDL capable of binding to LOX-1 (1, 31). This would allow us to identify proteins that constitutively associate with LOX-1 under both basal and ligand-stimulated conditions as well as molecules that become actively recruited into the LOX-1 receptor complex upon ligand activation. The proteins constituting the immunocomplex were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Imperial blue staining (Fig. 1A). Whole gel proteomic analysis using ion-trap LC-MS/MS was used to identify the proteins in each lane. Proteins identified in the control IgG IP were considered nonspecific and removed from the data set. As a result, a specific set of putative LOX-1-associated proteins was compiled from the MS data (see the complete protein list in Supplemental Table 1). (Supplemental data for this article is available online at the American Journal of Physiology-Cell Physiology website.) Among this set, ARHGEF1, APPL1, and TJP1 contained extensive coverage based on the number of unique and total peptides identified and thus represented the strongest positives. This set was found in the LOX-1 receptor complexes in both ligand-treated and untreated HAECT-LOX-1 cells and therefore appeared to constitutively associate with the receptor complex. Another protein, ROCK2, exhibited a preferential association with the ligand-treated LOX-1 receptor complex. The OxLDL- and LPC-treated samples contained 15 and 5 distinct peptides corresponding to ROCK2 sequence, respectively, whereas only a single peptide was detected in the untreated sample. Thus ROCK2 potentially represents a molecule that becomes recruited to the receptor complex on ligand activation of LOX-1 (Fig. 1B). Other molecules that exhibited this pattern included talin (TLN1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4γ1 (EIF4G1), and WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1) (Supplemental Fig. 1).

To confirm the LOX-1 associations identified by MS affinity proteomics, we performed reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation with lysates from HAECT-LOX-1 cells treated either with or without OxLDL (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. 2). IPs with an anti-ROCK2 antibody from OxLDL-treated cells, but not untreated cells, coprecipitated associating LOX-1 (Fig. 2A and data not shown). IP with antibodies to ARHGEF1 from untreated cells successfully pulled down LOX-1 (Fig. 2B). These data confirmed our initial observations and demonstrated that the LOX-1 receptor complex contained ARHGEF1 and ROCK2.

To exclude the possibility that these interactions were an artifact of LOX-1 overexpression, coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous LOX-1 from uninfected HAECT cells also pulled down these associating molecules (Fig. 3 and Supplemental Fig. 3). Notably, the association of ROCK2 with endogenous LOX-1 only occurred in the presence of OxLDL treatment, consistent with our initial observation, confirming that ligand treatment led to the recruitment of ROCK2 to the LOX-1 receptor complex.

OxLDL activation of LOX-1 leads to ROCK2 activation. ROCK2 is a serine/threonine kinase activated by a variety of stimuli, including ANG II and TNF-α (22, 26, 27). To determine whether OxLDL activation of LOX-1 leads to the activation of ROCK2, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using lysates from OxLDL-treated and untreated HAECT-LOX-1 cells. ROCK2 kinase activity significantly increased following OxLDL treatment (Fig. 4), demonstrating that ROCK2 could be activated on OxLDL stimulation of LOX-1.

ROCK2 kinase activity is required for IL-8 and CXCL2 production induced by OxLDL treatment of LOX-1. Our previous work demonstrated that LOX-1 could activate the production of CXC-chemokines CXCL2 and IL-8 following OxLDL treatment of HAECT-LOX-1 cells (19). In the present study we aimed to determine whether ROCK2 kinase activity was required for LOX-1-dependent chemokine production. We treated HAECT cells overexpressing either LOX-1 or control green fluorescent protein (GFP) with OxLDL in the presence of either Y-27632 or fasudil, two structurally distinct pharmacological inhibitors of ROCK2 kinase activity.

logical inhibitors of ROCK kinases. Conditioned media from these samples were analyzed for OxLDL-induced IL-8 production. Treatment with either Y-27632 or fasudil significantly inhibited OxLDL-stimulated IL-8 (Fig. 5), demonstrating that the kinase activity of ROCK2 was necessary for the induction of IL-8 following OxLDL treatment of HAECT-LOX-1 cells. The effects of the inhibitors on IL-8 were not due to a reduction in LOX-1-mediated OxLDL binding or internalization, since these events were unaffected (data not shown). In addition to the effect on IL-8, the treatment of HAECT-LOX-1 cells with Y-27632 significantly reduced OxLDL-induced CXCL2 production as measured by ELISA of CXCL2 levels in the conditioned media (Fig. 6).

**ROCK2 kinase activity is required for NF-κB activation resulting from OxLDL activation of LOX-1.** The production of both IL-8 and CXCL2 is known to be regulated by NF-κB, and it has been reported that NF-κB can be activated following OxLDL activation of LOX-1 (5). This raises the possibility that ROCK2 may mediate NF-κB activation by LOX-1 in response to OxLDL. To address this question, we treated OxLDL-stimulated HAECT-LOX-1 cells with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and analyzed NF-κB activity. Y-27632 significantly inhibited OxLDL-stimulated NF-κB p50 and p65 activity (Fig. 7). This indicated that ROCK2 kinase activity was required downstream of LOX-1 for full activation of NF-κB in response to OxLDL treatment.

DISCUSSION

OxLDL is an important initiating factor for endothelial activation and injury contributing to endothelial dysfunction, one of the earliest hallmarks of atherosclerosis (11, 16, 30). As the primary OxLDL receptor on endothelial cells, LOX-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (15, 20, 21). However, the downstream signaling events following LOX-1 activation are only beginning to be understood. One gap in the understanding of LOX-1 biology is the identity of proximal mediators of LOX-1 function and signaling. To date, no cytosolic proteins that associate with LOX-1 have been identified.

In this study we used an affinity proteomics approach to identify proteins that are present in LOX-1 receptor complex in endothelial cells stimulated with OxLDL. We have identified one LOX-1-associating molecule, ROCK2, as a potential mediator of LOX-1 signaling functions. ROCK2 is a kinase with a diverse set of substrates, including myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins, LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1), and adducin (29).

stood cellular physiological roles of ROCK2 activation is contractility of the cytoskeleton, affecting cell motility, vascular tone, adhesion, and phagocytosis (29). ROCK activity also has been linked to pathophysiological conditions such as atherosclerosis and hypertension (7). In our study, ROCK2 peptides are abundantly identified in a LOX-1 complex immunoprecipitated from HAECT cells treated with LOX-1 ligands OxLDL and LPC. Interestingly, the association is ligand dependent, since in the absence of OxLDL and LPC, only a weak interaction is detected. The interaction of ROCK2 and LOX-1 can be further confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation, and the association of endogenous LOX-1 with ROCK2 gives us confidence that the binding of these proteins is not an artifact of LOX-1 overexpression. It is not known whether the interaction is via direct binding or mediated by another protein.

It is noteworthy that we have found that another protein functionally related to ROCK, ARHGEF1, also associates with LOX-1. Both ARHGEF1 and ROCK2 are involved in Rho signaling, where ARHGEF1 acts as a GTP-exchange factor for Rho, whereas ROCK2 is a well-established RhoA effector. Furthermore, ARHGEF1 and ROCK have been shown to act in concert, where ARHGEF1 activates ROCK via RhoA (4). While this article was being prepared, Sugimoto et al. (33) published their work demonstrating that OxLDL induces RhoA activation via the LOX-1-membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) axis to modulate eNOS, NADPH oxidase, and ROS generation. Our findings are consistent with these results and suggest that ROCK2 activation is a downstream event from RhoA (Fig. 8). It is worth noting that RhoA was not detected in the LOX-1 immunocomplex based on our MS analysis (data not shown), suggesting that LOX-1 may not form a direct or stable association with RhoA. A weak or transient interaction between LOX-1 and RhoA would be possible and sufficient to mediate this signaling event. Future work must be carried out to confirm that RhoA activation is a downstream event of OxLDL activation of LOX-1 via functional blockade of RhoA. Furthermore, the functional interaction among LOX-1, MT1-MMP, ARHGEF1, and RhoA as well as the downstream biological effects needs to be delineated.

In addition to the physical association we have demonstrated for ROCK2 and LOX-1, our results show that ROCK activity is required for NF-κB activation and cytokine production in response to OxLDL activation of LOX-1 in HAECT cells. The intermediate signaling events between ROCK2 and NF-κB remain to be resolved and may involve the formation of

superoxide radicals and ROS. Both OxLDL activation of LOX-1 and ROCK activation have been reported to induce ROS generation (10, 25), which has been shown to activate NF-κB (6).

Our novel finding on ROCK2 being a proximal component of the LOX-1 signaling pathway is consistent with several lines of evidence from published data. Both LOX-1 and ROCK2 are known to have a role in several cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and ischemia-reperfusion. LOX-1 expression is elevated in atherosclerotic plaques,

Fig. 8. Model describing potential downstream signaling events from OxLDL-activated LOX-1 in endothelial cells. OxLDL binds to LOX-1 on endothelial cells and signals through membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and possibly ARHGEF1 to activate RhoA and RhoA substrate ROCK2 (3, 33). Subsequent NF-κB activation is potentially mediated through Rac-mediated ROS formation (25). Both Rho activation and ROS formation reduce endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function. After its translocation to the nucleus, NF-κB activates transcription of CXC chemokines. IL-8 and CXCL2 are secreted factors that bind to the CXCR2 receptor expressed on leukocytes. Recruited leukocytes adhere, transmigrate, and cause inflammation in vascular tissues, thus promoting atherosclerosis. The role for the other LOX-1-interacting cytosolic molecules, ARHGEF1, APPL1, and TJP1, is yet to be determined.

whereas ROCK substrates display an increased level of phosphorylation within atherosclerotic lesions in mouse models of atherosclerosis, suggesting that ROCK activity is increased at sites where LOX-1 is expressed under the pathological conditions of atherosclerosis (15, 28). This is consistent with our finding that OxLDL treatment leads to an induction of ROCK kinase activity.

Findings from LOX-1 knockout and ROCK pharmacological inhibitor studies both have shown beneficial outcomes in several disease models. In LDL-deficient mice, atherosclerotic plaque development and markers of inflammation are reduced when either LOX-1 is genetically deleted or ROCK is pharmacologically inhibited (18, 21). Similarly, cardiac function following ischemia-reperfusion injury is improved in LOX-1-deficient mice or when ROCK is inhibited (2, 12). Furthermore, in a model of hypertension induced by ANG II treatment, LOX-1-deficient mice display a reduction in hypertension (13). Likewise, ROCK inhibition in several models of hypertension leads to a lowering in blood pressure (7). These studies encompassing different animal models of cardiovascular diseases strengthen the notion that LOX-1 and ROCK may exhibit functional convergence in vivo.

The functional consequence of ROCK2 activation downstream to LOX-1 may involve the downregulation of eNOS. Reduced eNOS activity is a central feature of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis (11). OxLDL binding to LOX-1 reduces eNOS activity and expression (21). ROCK can phosphorylate eNOS at T495 to inhibit eNOS activity and NO production (34) or signal a decrease in eNOS mRNA stability (24, 35). Collectively, it is intriguing to determine whether ROCK can mediate the downregulation of eNOS following LOX-1 binding to OxLDL. This hypothesis along with the role of ROCK in LOX-1 signaling in a more physiological setting awaits further experimental testing.

Together our data support the model shown in Fig. 8. Our results demonstrate that LOX-1 can associate with a number of proximal proteins such as ARHGEF1 that reside in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells, and these interactions may mediate both normal and pathological functions of LOX-1. ARHGEF1 and ROCK2 could be components of the Rho signaling pathway downstream from activated LOX-1. The specific interaction

tion between ROCK2 and LOX-1 resulting from OxLDL activation may be important for the role of LOX-1 in atherogenesis via the activation of ROCK2 kinase activity and the subsequent NF-kB activation, possibly through ROS formation. Activated NF-kB will translocate into the nucleus and activate the transcription of CXC chemokines, including IL-8 and CXCL2. These secreted chemokines can in turn bind to the CXCR2 receptor expressed on leukocytes, resulting in the recruitment of leukocytes to the inflamed endothelium, which constitutes an early event during atherogenesis.

In summary, our functional proteomic approach has allowed us to identify novel LOX-1-associated molecules, yielding an important step toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie LOX-1 functions. This is particularly exemplified by our results involving ROCK2 and LOX-1. OxLDL treatment recruits ROCK2 to LOX-1 and stimulates ROCK kinase activity, and this activity is required for NF-kB stimulation, one of the central responses of LOX-1 activation. The discovery of ROCK2 and the additional LOX-1-associating proteins provide a foundation for future studies. Determining their role with respect to LOX-1 will enhance our understanding of LOX-1 functional mechanisms and the means by which LOX-1 contributes to cardiovascular disease.
