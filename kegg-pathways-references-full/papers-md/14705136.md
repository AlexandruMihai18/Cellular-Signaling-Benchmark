The normal function of prion protein (PrP) is usually disregarded at the expense of the more fascinating role of PrP in transmissible prion diseases. However, the normal PrP may play an important role in cellular function in the central nervous system, since PrP is highly expressed in neurons and motifs in the sequence of PrP are conserved in evolution. The finding that prion null mice do not have a significant overt phenotype suggests that the normal function of PrP is of minor importance. However, the absence of PrP in cells or in vivo contributes to an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress or apoptosis-inducing insults. An alternative explanation is that the PrP normal function is so important that it is redundant. Probing into the characteristics of PrP has revealed a number of features that could mediate important cellular functions. The neuroprotective actions so far identified with PrP are initiated through cell surface signaling, antioxidant activity, or anti-Bax function. Here, we review the characteristics of the PrP and the evidence that PrP protects against neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death.

### EXPRESSION PROFILE AND SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION OF PrP

The human PrP gene (PRNP) is located on chromosome 20 and comprises two exons; PrP is encoded by the second exon (Puckett et al., 1991). In mammals, PrP is highly expressed in brain. PrP mRNA is detected mostly in neurons of the hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, and medulla but is also present in nonneuronal astrocytes and ependymal cells (Brown et al., 1990; Tanji et al., 1995; McLennan et al., 2001; Makrinou et al., 2002).

One of the most important challenges in the prion field is to elucidate the normal function of PrP. An obvious avenue to exploring the function of PrP is to define precisely the subcellular localization of the protein. In the rodent brain, PrP is present in three major subcellular sites when analyzed by immunoelectron microscopy: the Golgi apparatus, early and late endosomes, and the plasma membrane (Fournier et al., 2000; Laine et al., 2001). These results were confirmed in various cell lines expressing a fusion green fluorescence protein (GFP)-PrP (Ivanova et al., 2001; Negro et al., 2001; Magalhaes et al., 2002). Based on the fact that PrP is expressed predominantly at synapses, it was suggested that PrP may regulate neuronal synaptic transmission (Herms et al., 1999). This observation was later challenged by two groups who detected the presence of PrP on all portions of the plasma membrane of neurons, with no preference for synapses (Laine et al., 2001; Mironov et al., 2003). Recently, PrP was also detected in the cytoplasm in subpopulations of neurons (Mironov et al., 2003). The function of PrP in the cytosol is discussed below.

As with other plasma membrane proteins (Fig. 1), PrP is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), transits through the Golgi, and is transported at the cell surface (for review see Harris, 1999). In the ER, both the N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1–22) and the C-terminal hydrophobic segment (residues 231–253) are cleaved, followed by the attachment of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor at the C-terminus (Stahl et al., 1987). Moreover, two N-linked oligosaccharide chains are added on residues Asn181 and Asn197, and a disulfide bond is formed between residues Cys179 and Cys214 (Caughey et al., 1989; Rudd et al., 2002). In the Golgi, oligosaccharide chains are further modified by the addition of sialic acid (Safar et al., 1990; Stahl et al., 1992). Moreover, PrP is hydroxylated at position Pro44 in a cell-type-specific manner (Gill et al., 2000). This post-translational modification is likely to change the structure of the N-terminus, a domain essential for the subcellular trafficking and, therefore, probably important in the function of PrP (Gill et al., 2000; Nunziante et al., 2003). Recombinant PrP can also be phosphorylated by several kinases in vitro (Negro et al., 2000). However, it is unclear whether PrP is phosphorylated in vivo and whether this phosphorylation modulates its activity. Therefore, the mature PrP contains 207 residues, and most of the newly synthesized PrP is exposed outside of the cell, attached to

the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by the GPI anchor (Caughey et al., 1989).

Interestingly, the punctate appearance of neuronal membrane staining suggests that PrP is organized in clusters (Laine et al., 2001). These clusters may represent membrane microdomains. Indeed, as with other GPI-anchored proteins, PrP in brain and in cultured cells is enriched in specialized sphingolipid-cholesterol compartments called rafts (Gorodinsky and Harris, 1995; Naslavsky et al., 1997). Raft domains may concentrate signaling proteins, and the presence of PrP in such domains raises the possibility that PrP may trigger signals inside the cells. Evidence for PrP signaling is presented below. PrP is also located in caveolae both at the plasma membrane and inside the cell (Peters et al., 2003).

Despite the majority of PrP being localized at the cell surface as a GPI-anchored protein, alternate forms of PrP, that may have inherent physiological functions, exist. Truncated forms of PrP generated by disintegrins ADAM10 and TACE activity at codon His-111 or Met-112 are present in normal human brain and cell lines (Chen et al., 1995; Jimenez-Huete et al., 1998; Vincent et al., 2000). After being translocated into the ER, PrP also can adopt two transmembrane topologies (Hegde et al., 1998). By using an in vitro assay, it was estimated that the secreted form ${}^{\mathrm{Sec}}$PrP represents 55% of the total PrP protein. In contrast, the transmembrane forms ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP (C-terminus in the lumen of the ER) and ${}^{\mathrm{Ntm}}$PrP (N-terminus in the lumen of the ER) represent only 35% and 15% of the total PrP, respectively. PrP topology is regulated by the N-terminal signal sequence and factors at the translocation channel of the ER (Hegde et al., 1998; Kim and Hegde, 2002). Furthermore, a small amount of PrP

may be released in the extracellular space after removal of the GPI anchor by posttranslational modification (Borchelt et al., 1993), and secreted PrP is observed by immunoprecipitation in the media of primary cultures of human neurons after 12 hr (Bounhar et al., 2001). In addition (Fig. 1), PrP contains two independent functional nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the N-terminal domain (Gu et al., 2003). However, the presence of N-glycans and/or GPI anchor in the normal protein prevents its targeting to the nucleus, and nuclear staining of PrP has not been detected on immunohistochemical examination of normal Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD), and Gerstmann Straussler Scheinker disease (GSS) brains. The role of these minor, truncated, transmembrane and nuclear forms of PrP is presently unknown. These mostly have been associated with disease. For example, proteolytic processing of PrP is altered in CJD (Chen et al., 1995). In excess, the transmembrane ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP is associated with pathological events rather than neuroprotective events (Hegde et al., 1998, 1999). The PrP145Stop and PrP160Stop mutants associated with a cerebrovascular form of prion disease are directed to the nucleus (Zanusso et al., 1999; Lorenz et al., 2002). However, it is also plausible that these alternate forms produced in low amounts have a significant yet undefined cellular function.

Finally, there has been considerable attention recently to the cytosolic form of PrP. By using proteasome inhibitors, several authors have shown by immunocytochemistry that wild-type and mutant PrP accumulate in the cytosol, mostly as an aggregated scrapie-like form, suggesting that PrP is normally subject to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (ERAD; Zanusso et al., 1999; Jin et al., 2000; Ma and Lindquist, 2001;

Yedidia et al., 2001; Cohen and Taraboulos, 2003; Mishra et al., 2003). Retrotranslocation of PrP through the ERAD pathway has been questioned in transfected cells, because transfection of cells with high levels of cDNAs results in a cytosolic PrP that retains its signal peptide (Drisaldi et al., 2003). Although this is entirely plausible, it is also evident from other studies that PrP accumulating in N2a cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor ALLN is ubiquitinated, a feature consistent with degradation of ERAD-derived proteins (Yedidia et al., 2001; Cohen and Taraboulos, 2003). Also, in primary cultures of human neurons treated with the irreversible and highly specific proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin, accumulating cytosolic PrP detected by subcellular fractionation lacks the signal peptide (Roucou et al., 2003). Therefore, there is strong evidence that ERAD-derived PrP can occur through endogenously expressed PrP in neurons and is usually degraded by the proteasome. Inhibition of the proteasomal activity results in the accumulation of this cytosolic PrP.

In N2a cells treated with the proteasomal inhibitors MG132 or lactacystine, the accumulation of cytosolic PrP is cytotoxic, similarly to when cytosolic PrP is expressed from a cDNA lacking both the N-terminal and the C-terminal signal peptides (Ma and Lindquist, 2002). Expression of a transgene encoding a form of PrP that lacks both the N- and the C-terminal signal peptides and is expressed exclusively in the cytosol induces a severe loss of cerebellar granule neurons and gliosis in mice (Ma et al., 2002). Therefore, the data suggest that the presence of cytosolic PrP in some neurons has pathological implications. However, in NIH 3T3 cells (Ma and Lindquist, 2002) and in primary cultures of human neurons (LeBlanc and Roucou, 2003), the accumulation of PrP in the cytosol is not associated with cell death, indicating that PrP requires more than a simple accumulation in the cytosol to become cytotoxic. Furthermore, it is surprising that, in the transgenic mice, the exogenous cytosolic PrP expressed under the prion promoter, which is highly expressed in many neuron cell types, causes degeneration only of the cerebellar granule neurons and not of the other neurons (Ma et al., 2002). These results raise the possibility of a normal cellular function for cytosolic PrP. A neuroprotective function for ERAD-derived cytosolic PrP is discussed below.

PrP. Because as Fyn is associated with cellular proliferation and cellular survival, this study indicates that cell surface PrP could modulate neuronal survival. However, by using the Fyn inhibitor PP2, others found that PrP-mediated Fyn activation in cerebellar granule neurons may be responsible for neuritic outgrowth rather than neuronal survival (Chen et al., 2003). PrP has been shown to promote neuritic outgrowth through interaction with the laminin receptor (Graner et al., 2000). Possibly, neuritic outgrowth in the 1C11 differentiated cells is important in survival.

Consistent with the role of PrP in signal transduction is the finding of interactions between PrP and synapsin Ib, a protein whose function in synapse formation and the regulation of neurotransmitter release supports neuronal survival (Spielhaupter and Schatzl, 2001). Several studies suggest that, at the plasma membrane of neurons, PrP predominantly has a synaptic distribution (Herms et al., 1999; Fournier et al., 2000; Haeberle et al., 2000; Moya et al., 2000). Furthermore, PrP interacts with Grb2, an adaptor protein that mediates growth factor receptor signals and also plays an important role in neuronal survival (Spielhaupter and Schatzl, 2001). More work will be required to understand the exact role of PrP interaction with Grb2 and synapsin Ib in synaptic transmission. Synaptic transmission disruption in PrP null mice has been reported by some but also disputed by others (Collinge et al., 1994; Whittington et al., 1995; Lledo et al., 1996; Mallucci et al., 2002). In assuming a role for PrP in synaptic transmission, it may be that PrP is involved in neuronal survival by maintaining the integrity of synaptic function.

A more substantial molecular understanding of the neuroprotective role of PrP through signal transduction is demonstrated in work using retinal explants. A PrP-binding protein and derived peptide promote survival of the neuroblastic layer in retinal explants against the translational inhibitor anisomycin-mediated cell death (Martins et al., 1997; Chiarini et al., 2002). The PrP-binding protein was identified as the stress-inducible protein I (STI1), which is present in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface (Zanata et al., 2002). Protection occurs through the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), whereas inhibition of ERK potentiates the protective role of PrP binding protein. Whether anisomycin mediates a classical mode of apoptotic cell death and whether PrP–StI1 interaction can protect neurons against other types of insult remain to be seen.

In addition, several signal transduction pathways involved in survival are activated in mouse primary cerebellar granule neurons grown in PrP molecule-coated tissue culture plates, including PKA, Src-related tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt, and MAPK/ERK kinases (Chen et al., 2003). Among downstream targets, increased Bcl-2 levels and decreased Bax levels were observed, consistently with PrP triggering survival signals. Taken together, these studies clearly support a neuroprotective role for PrP through signal transduction events.

# PROTECTION AGAINST Bax-MEDIATED CELL DEATH

## Wild-Type PrP

Given the similarity between the PrP octapeptide repeats and the BH2 domain of Bcl-2 family members (Fig. 1), it was suggested that PrP might function as a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (LeBlanc, 1998). The first evidence for a role of PrP in cellular survival was demonstrated by Kuwahara and colleagues (1999), who showed that immortalized hippocampal neurons prepared from PrP null mice were more susceptible to the apoptosis-inducing serum-deprivation insult than the cellular counterpart expressing wild-type PrP. Furthermore, transfection with Bcl-2 or PrP constructs rescued the PrP null cells (Kuwahara et al., 1999). Thereafter, it was shown that PrP protected human neurons in primary culture against Bax-mediated cell death (Bounhar et al., 2001).

Bax is a major proapoptotic protein of neurons and, once activated, undergoes a conformational change, oligomerization, and translocation to the mitochondria, where it allows the release of apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria, resulting in caspase-dependent or -independent cell death (Martinou and Green, 2001). When overexpressed in human neurons, Bax induces cell death that is prevented by coexpression of Bcl-2. Similarly, coexpression of wild-type PrP completely prevents cell death by Bax. The neuroprotection of PrP appears to require mature PrP, since disruption of the Golgi with Brefeldin A or protein trafficking into the Golgi with monensin eliminates the neuroprotective function of PrP. In addition, deletion of the octapeptide repeats eliminates PrP's neuroprotective function. However, the GPI anchor is not necessary for this neuroprotective function against Bax, indicating that cell surface signaling from the GPI-anchored PrP is not the only neuroprotective pathway mediated by PrP. Although the protection of PrP against Bax is obvious in cultures of primary human neurons, that function cannot be replicated in neuroblastoma mouse N2a, human BE(2)-M17, human SK-N-SH, or human embryonic kidney 293 cells even if these cell types undergo cell death upon Bax overexpression (Table I). However, PrP rescued differentiated human NT2 neuronal cells and partially protected MCF7 cells from Bax-mediated cell death. Therefore, it is important when studying neuroprotective functions of PrP to consider the cell type. It appears that PrP neuroprotection against Bax might occur only in terminally differentiated neurons. The cell-specific neuroprotective function of PrP may depend on a specific isoform, its cellular localization, the presence or absence of signaling pathways, or PrP-interacting proteins. Interestingly, others find that overexpression of PrP in a murine neuronal cell line leads to increased sensitivity to apoptotic insults (Paitel et al., 2003). This result is not inconsistent with what is known of the universal pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, which can under some conditions cause cell death rather than protect against cell death (Kirsch et al., 1999; Lewis et al., 1999).

## Cytosolic PrP

The work of Kurschner and Morgan that showed an interaction of PrP with Bcl-2 proteins using the yeast two-hybrid screening assay for Bcl-2-interacting proteins raised the possibility that PrP interaction with Bax is the mechanism by which PrP prevents Bax-mediated apoptosis (Kurschner and Morgan, 1995, 1996; Bounhar et al., 2001). However, at that time, a direct interaction between PrP and Bax was not an acceptable hypothesis, because PrP was known to be synthesized through the secretory pathway, whereas Bax was in the cytosol. Therefore, compartmentalization would prevent a direct interaction between PrP and Bcl-2 proteins. The recent papers on the occurrence of cytosolic PrP through the ERAD pathway now indicate that PrP could interfere with Bax-mediated cell death by direct interaction in the cytoplasm. Although Lindquist and colleagues have shown that cytosolic PrP is toxic in neuroblastoma N2a cells and in mouse cerebellar granule neurons, in human neurons cytosolic PrP not only is nontoxic but also protects against Bax-mediated cell death (Roucou et al., 2003), similar to the role full-length PrP plays against Bax in human neurons (Bounhar et al., 2001). However, cytosolic PrP does not inhibit Bax-mediated cell death in N2a cells, indicating that the simple colocalization of PrP with Bax cannot account for the inhibition of Bax (Table I). Further work will be needed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of PrP neuroprotection against Bax-mediated cell death.

## Mutations T183A and D178N Associated with FASE and FFI Prevent the Antiapoptotic Function of PrP Against Bax-Mediated Cell Death

Many single point mutations of the PrP gene result in amino acid substitution in the PrP and neurodegenerative diseases (Prusiner et al., 1998). Clinically, familial prion diseases are categorized as CJD, GSS, and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). There are also several variants that do not fit these categories, such as familial atypical spongiform encephalopathy (FASE; Nitrini et al., 1997). Two mutations of PrP associated with prion diseases altered the
neuroprotective ability of PrP against Bax-mediated cell death (Bounhar et al., 2001). Whereas the T183A FASE mutation (Nitrini et al., 1997) partially retains 50% of PrP’s function, the D178N FFI mutation (Medori et al., 1992) completely abolishes PrP’s neuroprotective function against Bax. Although many other mutations remain to be tested, these results support the hypothesis that inherited PrP mutations alter PrP’s neuroprotective function and indicate that a loss of the anti-Bax function of PrP could contribute to the pathological manifestation of the disease in the absence of other anti-Bax neuroprotective mechanisms. Interestingly, the expression of the universal antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is a strong inhibitor of Bax, is reduced in the aging CNS (Merry et al., 1994).

### PrP PROTECTS AGAINST OXIDATIVE STRESS

PrP binds to divalent copper via the octapeptide repeats present in the N-terminal region (Brown et al., 1997a) and may modulate the activity of copper (Cu²⁺)/zinc (Zn²⁺) superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key intracellular antioxidant enzyme (Brown and Besinger, 1998). Moreover, levels of PrP seem to correlate with Cu/Zn SOD and glutathione reductase activities (Brown and Besinger, 1998; Rachidi et al., 2003). However, others fail to see variations of SOD activity with varying levels of PrP expression (Waggoner et al., 2000). Two of the copper-binding sites may be physiologically relevant, with Kd values of about 10⁻¹⁴ M and 4 × 10⁻¹⁴ M, which are comparable to other known copper-binding proteins, such as SOD and ceruloplasmin. Spermatozoa from Prnp⁰/⁰ mice are more susceptible to copper toxicity than are spermatozoa expressing PrP (Shaked et al., 1999). In addition, PrP⁰/⁰ cell lines are more sensitive to copper toxicity (Brown et al., 1997b), suggesting a protective role for PrP. In contrast, the fact that the numbers of octapeptide repeats and histidine residues that are implicated in Cu²⁺ binding vary among species suggests that copper binding may not be the primary function of the PrP protein (van Rheede et al., 2003). Brown (2001), noting the synaptic concentration of PrP in neurons and the copper-binding affinity, proposed that PrP has a protective role against Cu²⁺ toxicity at the synapse rather than a direct role in neurotransmission. These data suggest that PrP expression at the synapse may contribute to Cu²⁺ binding and/or uptake, increased Cu/Zn SOD activity, and increased resistance to oxidative stress. This role may be particularly significant in light of the fact that the earliest lesions in the prion diseases have been noted at the synapse (Jeffrey et al., 2000).

Furthermore, neuronal cell cultures from Prnp⁰/⁰ mice are more susceptible to oxidative stress than are wild-type cells (Brown et al., 1997b; White et al., 1999). Indeed, impaired brain antioxidant defenses may be a significant factor in the lower threshold for seizure activity noted in Prnp⁰/⁰ mice (Pereira et al., 2001). Deletion of PrP’s octapeptide repeats eliminates the antioxidant function of PrP (Brown et al., 1999).

Taken together, these data suggest that PrP may have a role in protecting against oxidative stress, protection mediated both by Cu/Zn SOD and via glutathione reductase. However, it is important to note that the protection of PrP against oxidative stress is usually limited to approximately 30% of the cells, and further investigation in the prion null mice has revealed changes in various anti- and proapoptotic proteins, such as a decrease in p53, in addition to an increase in Bcl-2, Bax, and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB; Brown et al., 2002). Therefore, the susceptibility of the PrP null cells to oxidative stress may not be directly caused by the lack of the PrP but rather be caused by a response of the cells to the loss of PrP and subsequent altered activity of these anti- and proapoptotic proteins.

#### EVIDENCE FOR PrP NEUROPROTECTION IN VIVO

If PrP promotes survival, then why is there little defect in PrP null mice (Bueler et al., 1992)? The null strains (Bueler et al., 1992, 1993) are relatively unperturbed, except for sleep disturbances and altered circadian rhythm (Tobler et al., 1996). Two other strains show severe Purkinje cell loss (Sakaguchi et al., 1996; Nishida et al., 1999). The PrP-like gene Doppel is overexpressed in these mice because of a gene rearrangement event (Moore et al., 1999). Reexpression of PrP in these mice corrects the ataxic and neurodegenerative features of the null mice, suggesting that PrP can protect against Doppel-mediated cell death in vivo (Nishida et al., 1999). Again, the neuroprotective function of PrP requires the octapeptide repeats, because the deletion of amino acids 23–88 abrogates the ability of PrP to protect against Doppel (Atarashi et al., 2003). Furthermore, demyelination of the peripheral nervous system in this PrP null mouse is also corrected by PrP expression (Nishida et al., 1999). Ataxia in an N-terminally truncated PrP transgenic mouse is completely abolished by reintroducing one copy of the PrP gene (Shmerling et al., 1998). Therefore, it appears that PrP expression can prevent neurodegeneration in vivo. Moreover, it is important to consider that many null mice lack obvious defects. However, this does not mean that the protein is not important. One possibility is that the natural expression of functionally related proteins compensates for the lack of PrP expression. It is also possible that PrP is involved only in certain situations, so that unchallenged null mice will not show any effect. This seems to be the case for PrP, in that PrP null cells are more susceptible to serum deprivation (Kuwahara et al., 1999) and oxidative stress (Brown et al., 1997b) than PrP-expressing cells. Also, human neurons in primary culture microinjected with an antisense expression construct are more vulnerable to Bax, but the antisense itself does not induce cell death (Bounhar et al., 2001). Similarly, mutant PrPs of FASE (Nitrini et al., 1997) and FFI (Medori et al., 1992) do not cause cell death when microinjected in neurons but do eliminate PrP’s neuroprotective function (Bounhar et al., 2001).

Neuroprotective functions of PrP. 1, PrP protects human primary neurons against Bax-induced cell death, either from the plasma membrane through an unidentified signaling pathway or from the cytosol (Bounhar et al., 2001; Roucou et al., 2003). 2, The cAMP/PKA pathway, activated upon binding of PrP to stress-inducible protein-1 (STI1) at the cell surface, protects neonatal mice and rats retinal explants against anisomycin-induced cell death (Chiarini et al., 2002; Zanata et al., 2002). 3, PrP activates several pathways that promote survival of mouse cerebellar granule neurons (Chen et al., 2003). 4, PrP activates the Fyn kinase and could mediate cell survival and proliferation (Mouillet-Richard et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2003). 5, PrP prevents Doppel- and N-terminally truncated PrP-induced neurodegeneration in mice through an as yet unknown mechanism (Nishida et al., 1999; Shmerong et al., 1998). 6, PrP protection against oxidative stress in neuronal cultures is mediated by both Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase (Brown and Besinger, 1998; Brown et al., 2002). Dashed lines indicate preliminary studies that require further confirmation.

CONCLUSIONS

In this Mini-Review, we have described three PrP-mediated actions that promote neuroprotection: signal transduction, anti-Bax activity, and antioxidant activity (Fig. 2). These functions of PrP in neuroprotection seem paradoxical when considering that PrP infections only occur in the presence of host PrP and seem to be facilitated by high expression levels of PrP. The possibility that increased expression of PrP in situations of stress in order to promote neuronal survival also leads to an increased chance for PrP to undergo conversion into the infectious unit offers a unifying hypothesis for this paradox. The lack of prion disease transmission in prion null animals has indicated the possibility that eliminating PrP gene expression may be one way to prevent further infections from food sources. Although prevention of the infectious PrP is paramount, these neuroprotective functions of PrP cannot be ignored. The current results indicating a neuroprotective role of PrP question the validity of eliminating PrP expression in animals to prevent prion disease transmission, because another problem may occur, especially in long-lived species that could depend on PrP expression to protect them against Bax-mediated neuronal cell death or oxidative stress. Oxidative stress increases in the aging brain and is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein decreases in aging CNS (Merry et al., 1994), and PrP may functionally replace this important protein in the aging brain.

The three neuroprotective functions of PrP occur through independent mechanisms. However, the necessity for the octapeptide repeats in PrP's neuroprotection against Bax-, oxidative stress-, and Doppel-mediated cell death indicates a common link in neuroprotection actions. Whether the primary amino acid sequence of the octapeptide repeat is directly responsible for the loss of function should be addressed. It is possible that removal of this sequence alters the conformation of PrP that is required

for neuroprotection. On the other hand, there are clearly differences in the basic mechanisms offered by these diverse neuroprotective functions. Although PrP's protection against Bax and Doppel appears complete, the antioxidant function is limited. However, it is possible that the antioxidant insults are too strong to allow complete protection and that limited oxidative stress in an in vivo situation would be controlled by endogenous PrP. Another difference in the neuroprotection mode is that, whereas the antioxidant and signal transduction functions appear to occur through the cell surface GPI-anchored PrP, the anti-Bax function is mediated both by cytosolically expressed PrP and by secreted PrP that has at least crossed the cis-Golgi. Therefore, it is possible that the anti-Bax function is initially mediated by two independent mechanisms depending on the location of PrP. Possibly, direct interaction of cytosolic PrP with Bax could prevent Bax-mediated cell death, as proposed for Bcl-2 inhibition of Bax (Yin et al., 1994). Also, one cannot exclude the possibility that ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}} \mathrm{PrP}$, which has the N-terminal containing the octapeptide repeats oriented in the cytosol, could interact with Bax. On the other hand, secreted PrP may act through signal transduction.

Most of the evidence for the role of PrP neuroprotection was described from neurons. It is clear from our own studies that PrP's antiapoptotic function against Bax is likely to be specific to terminally differentiated neurons. Protection in MCF-7 cells is only partial. It is therefore tempting to speculate that there are specific neuronal factors that mediate PrP neuroprotection. The next challenge will be to identify these factors and the pathways involved to understand better the underlying molecular mechanisms of PrP neuroprotection.
