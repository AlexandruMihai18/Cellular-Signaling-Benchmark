### Abstract

Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a cellular fuel gauge that regulates metabolic pathways in nutrient metabolism. Recent studies have strongly implicated that AMPK in the hypothalamus regulates energy metabolism by integrating inputs from multiple hormones, peptides, neurotransmitters, and nutrients. Leptin is an adipocyte hormone that regulates food intake and energy expenditure in peripheral tissues. Leptin inhibits AMPK activity in the arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus, and its inhibition is necessary for the anorexic effect of leptin. Alteration of hypothalamic AMPK activity is sufficient to change food intake and body weight. Furthermore, fasting/refeeding, glucose, and melanocortin receptor alter AMPK activity in the hypothalamus. Adiponectin has also been shown to increase food intake by activating AMPK in the arcuate hypothalamus. Recent data have shown that acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase/malonyl-coenzyme A/carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1/fatty acid oxidation and mammalian target of rapamycin signalings are putative downstream pathways for food intake regulation in response to hypothalamic AMPK. Thus, these results suggest that food intake and nutrient metabolism are coordinately regulated by the common signaling pathway of AMPK in the hypothalamus. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Introduction

Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. It is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of an α-catalytic subunit and β- and γ-regulatory subunits (Fig. 1) [1]. AMPK is activated by allosteric effect of AMP and by threonine phosphorylation of an α-subunit in response to AMPK kinases such as LKB1, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK), and TGF-beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) [2–6]. Activation of AMPK represses adenosine triphosphate–consuming anabolic pathways and induces adenosine triphosphate–producing catabolic pathways [1]. For example, AMPK inhibits fatty acid synthesis, whereas it activates fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid oxidation in response to AMPK is accomplished, at least in part, by phosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and decrease of malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA), and by increasing gene expression of fatty acid oxidation–related genes.

In addition to its metabolic action in the periphery, AMPK in the hypothalamus regulates food intake [7]. We found that leptin, glucose, melanocortin receptor agonist and antagonist, and fasting/refeeding change AMPK activity in several hypothalamic nuclei [8]. The alteration of hypothalamic AMPK activity was sufficient to change food intake and body weight. Other orexigenic and anorexigenic molecules for food intake regulation were also demonstrated to change hypothalamic AMPK activity [7]. Recent studies have further indicated that the downstream targets of AMPK, ACC/malonyl-CoA and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, involve food intake regulation [7]. This mini-review focuses on recent findings pertaining to the role of hypothalamic AMPK in food intake regulation and its signaling pathways.

activity in several hypothalamic regions, whereas refeeding inhibits it [8]. Expression of constitutively active (CA) AMPK in the medial hypothalamus by adenovirus increases food intake and body weight of normal mice, whereas dominant negative (DN) AMPK inhibits them. Changes in hypothalamic AMPK activity result in alterations of neuropeptide expression: expression of DN-AMPK in the medial hypothalamus suppresses mRNA expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) in the arcuate hypothalamus (ARH), whereas expression of CA-AMPK enhances the fasting-induced increase in the expression of NPY and AgRP in the ARH and melanin-concentrating hormone in the lateral hypothalamus. The changes in neuropeptide expression are likely to mediate the effect of AMPK on food intake, at least in part.

Fasting and refeeding are accompanied by changes in hormones and nutrient levels that may bring about the alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity [8]. Intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of glucose inhibits AMPK activity in several regions of the hypothalamus including the ARH and the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). In contrast to the periphery, the anorexigenic hormone, leptin, inhibits hypothalamic AMPK activity [8]. Furthermore, the anorexigenic hormone, insulin, also inhibits the activity [8].

Recently, the specific roles of the AMPK α₂-subunit in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) or AgRP neurons were examined by generating KO mice lacking the AMPK α₂-subunit in these neurons preferentially [9]. KO mice lacking the AMPK α₂-subunit in POMC neurons developed obesity due to reduced energy expenditure and dysregulated food intake. In contrast, KO mice lacking the AMPK α₂-subunit in AgRP neurons showed decreased body weight with increased sensitivity to an MC receptor agonist, melanotan-II. Electrophysiologic studies have revealed that these KO mice do not respond to a low glucose level, suggesting that AMPK is necessary for the glucose-sensing mechanism in these neurons [9]. In contrast, these AMPK α₂-subunit KO mice remained sensitive to leptin: leptin normally inhibited food intake and changed neuronal activity in POMC and AgRP neurons [9]. This is consistent with our previous study showing that the anorexic effect of leptin is intact in DN-AMPK-expressing mice [8].

Many other anorexic and orexigenic molecules also alter hypothalamic AMPK activity (Table 1) [8,10–15]. α-Lipoic acid and fatty acid synthase inhibitor (C75), which reduce food intake when given by intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection, inhibits AMPK activity in the hypothalamus [10,11]. In contrast, the orexigenic molecules, ghrelin [12,13] and cannabinoids [13], stimulate hypothalamic AMPK activity. Recently, Kubota et al. [14], in col-

activity is restricted in the ARH and PVH (Fig. 2), whereas insulin inhibits AMPK activity in other hypothalamic regions such as the lateral hypothalamus, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the dorsomedial hypothalamus. Expression of CA-AMPK in the medial hypothalamus suppresses leptin-induced anorexia, whereas the effect of leptin is normal under the expression of DN-AMPK [8]. These results indicate that hypothalamic AMPK acts as a gatekeeper for leptin signaling in the hypothalamus for food intake regulation. The effects of DN- and CA-AMPK cannot be explained by alterations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the hypothalamus, because the effect of leptin on increasing STAT3 phosphorylation was normal or slightly enhanced in the ARH and ventromedial hypothalamus/dorsomedial hypothalamus in mice expressing DN- or CA-AMPK in the hypothalamus [8].

Melanocortin-4 (MC4) receptor appears to be involved in the effects of leptin and refeeding on AMPK activity in the PVH (Fig. 2). Intracerebroventricular injection of the MC receptor agonist, melanotan-II, inhibits AMPK activity in the PVH, whereas injection of the MC receptor antagonist, AgRP, increases AMPK activity in the nucleus [8]. Furthermore, refeeding and leptin fail to inhibit AMPK activity in the PVH in the MC4-receptor knockout (KO) mice. Alterations in AMPK activity in the PVH are thus mediated by the MC4 receptor and are secondary to changes in the activity of arcuate AgRP neurons. Although STAT3 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathways play a crucial role in regulating the activity of NPY/AgRP neurons, we propose that decreased ARH AMPK activity allows and enhances this suppression, leading to activation of MC4 receptor signaling in PVH neurons [8]. MC4-receptor activation decreases AMPK activity in the PVH, which proba-

Leptin inhibits AMPK activity in NPY/AGRP neurons and suppresses its activity and neuropeptide gene expression, leading to activation of MC4 receptor signaling in the PVH neurons.

laboration with us, showed that adiponectin stimulates food intake by increasing AMPK activity in the ARH. Adiponectin receptor-1 is expressed in the ARH, and the stimulation of food intake by adiponectin was attenuated by siRNA of adiponectin receptor-1 and DN-AMPK expressions in the ARH. Adiponectin-KO mice showed decreased AMPK activity in the ARH, decreased food intake, and increased energy expenditure, exhibiting resistance to high-fat-induced obesity. Trimers and hexamers but not high-molecular-weight multimers of adiponectin were transported to the cerebrospinal fluid. Adiponectin levels in serum and the cerebrospinal fluid and expression of adiponectin receptor-1 in the ARH increased during fasting and decreased after refeeding, suggesting that adiponectin is an orexigenic hormone to stimulate food intake and decrease energy expenditure during fasting through its effects in the hypothalamus. These are consistent with a recent study showing that mice lacking leptin and overexpressing adiponectin are morbidly obese compared with their *ob/ob* littermates [16]. Thus, these findings suggest that the hypothalamic AMPK integrates nutrient-derived and hormonal- or peptide-derived signals from anorexigenic and orexigenic pathways to regulate food intake and body weight.

### Downstream and upstream effectors of hypothalamic AMPK for food intake regulation

One of the best-characterized target metabolic pathways for AMPK activity on feeding control is the ACC/malonyl-CoA/fatty acid oxidation pathway (Fig. 3) [7]. Some studies have shown that inhibition of AMPK by leptin or α-lipoic acid is associated with decreased phosphorylation of ACC, leading to stimulation of ACC activity and increases in cellular malonyl-CoA levels [10,12,17]. An increase in malonyl-CoA levels would inhibit mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, AMPK has been shown to activate malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and decrease malonyl-CoA. Overexpression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in the medial hypothalamus by an adenovirus or adeno-associated virus decreased malonyl-CoA and long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and induced obesity [18,19]. Furthermore, inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 activity in the hypothalamus by a riboprobe or specific inhibitor suppressed food intake and body weight [20]. Recently, the orexigenic effect of ghrelin was reported to involve inhibition of fatty acid synthesis induced by activation of AMPK resulting in a decreased hypothalamic level of malonyl-CoA and increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 activity [21]. In addition, fasting decreased mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase in the ventromedial hypothalamus preferentially in an AMPK- and a ghrelin-dependent manner [21].

The mTOR is another target of AMPK (Fig. 3) [22–24]. AMPK inhibits mTOR signaling, thereby suppressing protein synthesis, which is an important pathway by which AMPK conserves cellular energy during low energy states

[25–27]. Recent studies have shown that the mTOR-signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of food intake and body weight in the hypothalamus [15,28]. The mTOR is colocalized with AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons in the ARH [28]. Leptin and refeeding activate mTOR signaling, whereas fasting downregulates it. The amino acid, L-leucine, a potent stimulator of mTOR activity, inhibited food intake and reduced body weight [28]. Furthermore, an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, blocked the effects of leucine and leptin on food intake and body weight. More recently, it was reported that leucine and a high-protein diet decrease AMPK and increase mTOR activity in the hypothalamus, leading to inhibition of NPY and stimulation of POMC gene expression [15]. Rapamycin suppressed the effects of leucine on food intake and neuropeptide gene expression. Because AMPK inhibits mTOR in vivo and in vitro, mTOR may be a putative mediator of the hypothalamic effects of AMPK.

A recent study reported that CaMKK2 contributes to the regulation of hypothalamic AMPK and energy metabolism [29]. CaMKK2-KO mice showed decreased hypothalamic AMPK activity and decreased NPY and AgRP but not POMC mRNA expression. The KO mice did not respond to orexigenic signals and were resistant to a high-fat diet-induced obesity. Pharmacologic inhibition of hypothalamic CaMKK in wild-type mice also inhibited food intake and

promoted weight loss consistent with decreased NPY and AgRP mRNA.

# Conclusion and future directions

Recent studies have shown that AMPK and its downstream signaling pathways comprise a crucial regulatory system for food intake and body weight. Increasing numbers of hormones and nutrients are being shown to regulate hypothalamic AMPK signaling and novel molecules and pathways are being identified as targets of AMPK. These data show that the AMPK signaling pathway regulates food intake and energy metabolism by integrating hormonal and nutrient signals. However, the following key questions still remain to be clarified: How does leptin inhibit hypothalamic AMPK yet activate in the peripheral tissues? Do AMPK kinases, LKB1 and TAK1, and CaMKK involve AMPK activity regulation in the hypothalamus? It will be important to further delineate the mechanism by which alterations of fatty acid metabolism and mTOR signaling in the hypothalamus change neuronal activity and feeding behavior.
