### Abstract

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated-factor-6 (TRAF6) is an adaptor protein involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Recent studies using macrophages from TRAF6 knockout mice have revealed that TRAF6 is required for TLR7 signaling. However, an essential role of TRAF6 in TLR4 signaling and cytokine production is slightly controversial. Using an RNAi approach to reduce the cellular levels of TRAF6, we tested the role of this adaptor protein on the sensitivity of the various components of the ERK pathway mediated by TLR4 and -7 in Raw264.7, a mouse macrophage cell line. ERK activation in macrophages by TLR4 and -7 is mediated via a MAP3K, called TPL2/COT, which under unstimulated conditions is associated with NFκB1 p105, a member of the IkB family of proteins. Upon stimulation with TLR ligands, p105 is phosphorylated by IkB kinase (IKK) complex and partially degraded, which releases TPL2. The free TPL2 is active and stimulates the ERK pathway via MEK1/2. The free TPL2, however, is also unstable and is targeted for degradation. We demonstrate here that reduced level of TRAF6 (~80% decrease) in macrophages does not significantly affect any of the components of the TLR4-stimulated ERK pathway, including p105 phosphorylation, TPL2 degradation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, however, TLR4-induced JNK1/2 phosphorylation is significantly blocked by TRAF6 knockdown, suggesting that ERK and JNK pathways are differentially sensitive to TRAF6 levels. Furthermore, although TLR4-mediated IKK-induced p105 phosphorylation is not sensitive to TRAF6 knockdown, IkBa phosphorylation (also, IKK-induced) is significantly blocked, suggesting that TLR4 activation results in a TRAF6-sensitive and -insensitive IKK activation in macrophages. In contrast to TLR4 signaling, TLR7 activation of ERK, JNK pathways and phosphorylation of p105 and IkBa are completely inhibited in TRAF6 knockdown cells. Compared to the signaling data, while TLR4-induced TNFα mRNA expression is not significantly inhibited by TRAF6 knockdown, TLR7-induced TNFα mRNA is significantly blocked. In contrast, both TLR4- and TLR7-induced IL6 mRNA are significantly blocked by TRAF6 knockdown. These results suggest that while TRAF6 is absolutely essential for TLR7 activation of ERK, JNK and NFκB pathways, TLR4-induced ERK, JNK pathways and IKK-mediated phosphorylation of IkB family members as well as cytokine expression are differentially sensitive to the cellular levels of TRAF6. These results have important implications in terms of therapeutic targeting of TRAF6 complexes in diseases where TLR4 and -7 are involved.

### 1. Introduction

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) in the microbes (Akira et al., 2006; Beutler, 2005; Beutler et al., 2006). These receptors are key sensors of microbial products

and are expressed in “sentinel cells of the immune system, in particular dendritic cells and macrophages”, where they sense a range of chemicals produced by viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa (Akira et al., 2006; Beutler, 2005; Beutler et al., 2006). Activation of signaling pathways by TLRs, by the various molecular components of the microbes constitute one of the body’s earliest signals that it has been invaded by a foreign microbe. Thirteen TLRs that have been identified so far, of which TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are displayed on the cell surface, while TLR3, 7, 8 and 9 are localized intracellularly

(Akira et al., 2006; Beutler, 2005; Beutler et al., 2006). The TLRs have a conserved region of about 200 amino acids in their cytoplasmic tails, known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. Within the TIR domain are regions, which are conserved and are crucial for signaling. After ligand binding the TLRs dimerize and undergo conformational change that is required for the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. These include the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (Myd88), IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β-) activated kinase (TAK1), TAK-1 binding protein (TAB1 and 2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated-factor-6 (TRAF-6) (O’Neill, 2006; Tsan, 2006).

Tumor necrosis factor associated factors (TRAFs) are intracellular adaptor proteins that are proximal signal transducers for TNFR superfamily (Chung et al., 2002; Lee and Lee, 2002; Zapata, 2003). Six TRAFs (TRAF1-6) are currently known in mammals (Cao et al., 1996; Hu et al., 1994; Ishida et al., 1996a,b; Nakano et al., 1996; Rothe et al., 1995; Rothe et al., 1994; Sato et al., 1995). Unlike other TRAFs, TRAF6 has been shown to play a pivotal role in the signaling from IL1R/TLR superfamily as demonstrated using TRAF6 knockout mice (Gohda et al., 2004; Hacker et al., 2006; Kobayashi et al., 2001; Lomaga et al., 1999; Naito et al., 1999). Many of the physiological effects of TRAF6 are mediated by activation of IkB kinase complex and members of the MAPKs, which then regulate transcription of genes via NFκB and AP1.

Using macrophages from TRAF6 knockout mice, two studies have independently confirmed that TLR7-induced signaling requires TRAF6 (Gohda et al., 2004; Hacker et al., 2006). The role of TRAF6 in TLR4 signaling, however, is slightly controversial. Using an RNAi approach to knockdown TRAF6 levels in macrophages, we demonstrate here that the role of TRAF6 is not only distinct between TLR4 and -7 pathways, it is also selective between signaling pathways stimulated by TLR4 activation.

### 2. Materials and methods

#### 2.1. Materials

Ultra pure LPS, and R837 were from Invivogen. Tubulin antibody was from Sigma. Protease inhibitor cocktail tablet was from Roche. TRAF6, TPL2, ERK2 and p105/p50 antibodies were from Santa Cruz; pERK1/2, p-p105, and p-IkBα and IkBα antibodies were from Cell-signaling.

#### 2.2. Cell culture

Raw264.7 macrophages were from ATCC and were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO₂.

#### 2.3. siRNA

Control siRNA, and mouse TRAF6 siRNAs were from Dharmacon. Transfection of siRNAs in Raw264.7 cells was performed using Amaxa’s Nucleofector Program D-032. The cells were transfected and analyzed for knockdown 48 h after electroporation, as described before (Parameswaran et al., 2006). Cells were analyzed for knockdown after every siRNA transfection.

#### 2.4. Western blotting

For Western blotting, cells after treatment were quickly washed with cold PBS before lysis with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were clarified and then protein concentration determined and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded on the gels for Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (Parameswaran et al., 2006). For immunoblotting, the secondary antibodies were HRP conjugated and analyzed by chemiluminescence and densitometry.

#### 2.5. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR

RNA extraction and real-time Q-RT-PCR were performed as described before (Coussens et al., 2002; Janagama et al., 2006; Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from Raw264.7 macrophages using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After sodium acetate–ethanol precipitation and several ethanol washes, the RNA integrity was verified by formaldehyde–agarose gel electrophoresis. Synthesis of cDNA was performed with reverse transcriptase (RT) with the total RNA using the superscript II kit with Oligo-dt (12–18) primers as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified by PCR in a final reaction volume of 25 μl using SYBR Green Supermix (Invitrogen) with 10 pmol of each primer (QuantiTect primers for TNFα and IL6 from Qiagen). Real-time PCR was performed in MX3000P (Stratagene) thermocycler. QuantiTect primer manufacturer’s recommended SYBR green PCR conditions were followed. RNA free samples, a negative control did not produce any amplicons. Melting curve and gel analysis were used to verify single products of the appropriate base-pair size. Data was analysed with MX3000P software using actin for normalization. Results are expressed as percent maximal with LPS- or R837-stimulated TNFα or IL6 expression levels in control cells set at 100%.

#### 2.6. Statistics

All experiments were repeated 3–6 times and data were analyzed using ANOVA (for three or more group comparisons) or Student’s t-test (for two group comparisons). All statistics and data analysis were performed using GRAPHPAD PRISM software. Statistical significance was set at \(p < 0.05\).

### 3. Results

#### 3.1. Efficient knockdown of TRAF6 in Raw264.7 macrophages

By using a siRNA pool against TRAF6, we knocked down the cellular levels of TRAF6 in Raw264.7 macrophages consistently between 80% and 85% in every experiment (Fig. 1A).

A representative blot from more than five experiments is shown in the insert. For quantitation, TRAF6 bands were normalized with actin levels to correct for loading. (B) Activation of ERK via IKK-p105-TPL2-MEK by TLR activation in macrophages: Using cells from IKK, p105 and TPL2 knockout mice, it is now established that TLR-mediated activation of ERK in macrophages involves the phosphorylation of p105 by IKK and the subsequent degradation of p105 and release of TPL2 (Banerjee et al., 2006; Beinke and Ley, 2004; Beinke et al., 2004; Waterfield et al., 2004; Waterfield et al., 2003). TPL2 is the MAP3K that activates ERK1/2 in macrophages in response to TLR stimulation (Dumitru et al., 2000). This paradigm has also been established to be functional in Raw264.7 macrophages (Beinke et al., 2004).

For control, we transfected the Raw264.7 cells with control siRNA pool against luciferase gene that is not expressed in mammalian cells. Compared to untransfected cells the control siRNA did not alter the cellular levels of TRAF6 (data not shown).

### 3.2. Effects of LPS and R837 on p105-TPL2-ERK pathway in macrophages

TLR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in macrophages (including Raw264.7 cells) is mediated by MEK1/2, which in turn is activated by a MAP3K called TPL2/COT (Fig. 1B). TPL2 is a unique MAP3K, because under basal conditions, it is stoichiometrically associated with NFκB1 p105, an IkB family member. Like other IkB members, p105 is also phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex upon stimulation by TLRs and this process results in the partial degradation of p105, which then releases TPL2. While the p105-bound TPL2 is inactive in terms of MEK1/2 activation, the free TPL2 is active and phosphorylates MEK1/2, which then activates ERK1/2. The free TPL2 however is also unstable and is targeted for degradation (Beinke et al., 2003; Beinke et al., 2004; Belich et al., 1999; Cho et al., 2005; Cho and Tsichlis, 2005; Das et al., 2005; Waterfield et al., 2003). Using the Raw264.7 macrophage model with reduced TRAF6 levels, we tested the effects of LPS (TLR4 ligand) and R837 (TLR7 ligand) on the p105-TPL2-ERK pathway. Our results revealed that LPS-induced ERK activation is not sensitive to the low levels of TRAF6 because ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not significantly affected in TRAF6 knockdown cells compared to control cells (Fig. 2A and C). At 15 and 60 min after LPS treatment, there was only a 10% change between control and TRAF6 knockdown cells, while at 30 min after LPS stimulation, there was ~30% decrease in phosphoERK levels in TRAF6 knockdown cells compared to the control cells. This partial decrease, however, was not statistically significant. In contrast, R837-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly blocked (Fig. 2B and D). Using TPL2 degradation as a surrogate for its activity as well as its p105 interaction-status, we examined the effect of LPS and R837 on TPL2 degradation kinetics in control and TRAF6 knockdown cells. Interestingly, consistent with the pERK data, LPS-induced TPL2 degradation was not affected in TRAF6 knockdown cells compared to the controls (Fig. 2A and E). R837-induced TPL2 degradation was, however, significantly blocked in TRAF6 knockdown cells compared to controls (Fig. 2B and F), indicating that low TRAF6 levels probably blocked TPL2 release from p105. Based on these results we hypothesized that low TRAF6 levels differentially regulate LPS-and R837-induced p105 phosphorylation by IKK. As expected, LPS-induced p105 phosphorylation was not significantly inhibited in TRAF6 knockdown cells compared to controls (Fig. 2A and G). But R837-induced p105 phosphorylation was significantly blocked in TRAF6 knockdown cells (Fig. 2B and H). Taken together, these results suggest that while LPS-induced IKK-p105-TPL2-ERK pathway is not sensitive to the knock-down levels of TRAF6, R837-induced IKK-p105-TPL2-ERK pathway is significantly blocked at low TRAF6 levels even without a complete knockout of TRAF6. This suggests that LPS-induced IKK activation involves a TRAF6-independent pathway that can compensate during low levels of TRAF6 in macrophages.

### 3.3. Effects of LPS and R837 on IkBa phosphorylation

In order to examine if LPS- and R837-induced IKK activation in general follows the above paradigm, we tested the effect of TRAF6 knockdown on LPS- and R837-induced IkBa phosphorylation. IkBa is another member of the IkB family that is also phosphorylated by IKK upon stimulation by LPS and R837 in macrophages. Both LPS and R837 caused a significant decrease in IkBa levels by 15–30 min after stimulation (Fig. 3). By 60 min after stimulation, IkBa levels returned to the levels comparable to time 0. The IKK-induced phosphorylation

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were serum starved for 4 h after which they were treated without or with LPS (1 μg/ml) or R837 (10 μg/ml) for various time points as indicated. Cell lysates were collected and Western blotting was performed as described in the Section 2. After probing with phospho-ERK, TPL2 or phospho-p105 antibodies, blots were reprobed with either tubulin (for phospho-ERK and TPL2) or with p105 (for phospho-p105). Representative blots are shown in (A) and (B). Quantitation was done after normalizing the phospho-ERK (C and D) and TPL2 (E and F) to tubulin and phospho-p105 (G and H) to p105 and results are expressed as percentage of maximal response for pERK and pP105 and as percentage of control for TPL2. \( n = 3-6 \). *\( p < 0.001 \); **\( p < 0.01 \); #\( p < 0.05 \) compared to control cells.

of IkBa also followed this pattern. The reappearance and the biphasic phosphorylation status of IkBa have been extensively described before (Arenzana-Seisdedos et al., 1995; Sun et al., 1993). In contrast to the p105-TPL2-ERK pathway, LPS- and R837-induced IkBa phosphorylation were significantly inhibited by TRAF6 knockdown (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that LPS causes a TRAF6-sensitive and TRAF6-insensitive IKK activation in macrophages. The TRAF6-sensitive IKK activation mediates IkBa phosphorylation, while TRAF6-insensitive activation mediates p105 phosphorylation. These results are not non-specific effects of TRAF6 siRNA because these results were obtained in the same cells under the same conditions. In addition, under the same conditions, R837-induced IKK activation is entirely TRAF6-sensitive.

### 3.4. Differential roles of TRAF6 in LPS-induced ERK and JNK activation

Compared to the role of TRAF6 in TLR4- and -7-induced ERK pathway, LPS- and R837-induced JNK activation were significantly blocked in TRAF6 knockdown compared to control cells (Fig. 4). These results suggest that both LPS-

Blots were first probed for phosphoIkBα and then for IkBα and subsequently with tubulin. Blots in (A) and (B) are representative blots from three separate experiments. Quantitation provided in (C) and (E) was performed without normalization to total IkB levels. pIkBα levels at 15 min was normalized with IkB levels and quantitated separately and provided in (D) and (F). Because IkBα levels were very low after 30 min treatment with LPS and R837, normalization was performed only up to the 15 min time point. Both types of quantitation reveal that LPS- and R837-induced IkBα phosphorylation is significantly attenuated in TRAF6 knockdown cells. \( n = 3 \), \(* p < 0.001\).

R837-induced JNK activation are sensitive to the cellular levels of TRAF6 in a similar manner. These results also demonstrate that the role of TRAF6 on MAPK pathways is not only different between TLR4 and TLR7, but the different members of the MAPK pathways are differentially sensitive to low TRAF6 levels even with in TLR4 signaling.

### 3.5. Role of TRAF6 in LPS- and R837-induced cytokine mRNA production

In order to test if the role of TRAF6 in signaling is reflected downstream on cytokine expression, we examined the effects of LPS and R837 on TNFα and IL6 mRNA in the macrophage model described above. We found that LPS-induced TNFα mRNA was only partially blocked in macrophages with TRAF6 knockdown (~40% inhibition, which did not reach statistical significance) (Fig. 5A). LPS-induced IL6 mRNA expression, however, was significantly blocked in TRAF6 knockdown macrophages compared to control cells (~80% inhibition compared to control) (Fig. 5B). Similar to the role of TRAF6 in TLR7 signaling pathways, R837-induced TNFα and IL-6 mRNA were both significantly blocked in TRAF6 knockdown compared to control macrophages (Fig. 5C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of TRAF6 in LPS- and R837-induced signaling pathways in macrophages are also reflected downstream on cytokine expression. These results are significant in the context of drug development against TRAF6-mediated signaling pathways because our results suggest that TRAF6 inhibition will result in a selective blockade of signaling and pathophysiology in response to LPS in macrophages.

### 4. Discussion

Knockout mice studies have shown that TRAF6 is crucial in the signaling from both TNF and TLR superfamily of receptors. Although Lomaga et al. (1999) and Naito et al. (1999) initially reported characterization of TRAF6 knockout mice, there were discrepancies between the two studies, probably because different exons were targeted in the two knockouts. In later studies, the role of TRAF6 in macrophages was examined by two groups (Gohda et al., 2004; Hacker et al., 2006). However, both studies used different controls thus making the interpretation of these experiments slightly difficult. Furthermore, while Gohda et al. (2004) reported a clear change in the kinetics of TLR4-induced signaling in TRAF6\(^{-/-}\) compared to TRAF6\(^{+/+}\) spleen-derived macrophages, studies by Hacker et al. (2006) did not show a change in the kinetics of TLR4-induced signaling in TRAF6\(^{+/+}\) compared to TRAF6\(^{-/-}\) macrophages derived from the bone marrow. They, however, showed an overall partial decrease in the signaling pathways. RNAi studies in mouse macrophages reveal that, knockdown of TRAF6 to up to 80–85% of control levels do not affect some pathways significantly while inhibiting other pathways from the same ligand stimulation. Specifically, our results show that even though LPS-induced JNK and IkBα phosphorylation are sensitive to knockdown levels of TRAF6, LPS-induced ERK pathway is not significantly affected by even 80–85% knockdown of TRAF6. In addition, we demonstrate here that the various upstream components of the ERK pathway also follow the same trend. It is now clear that, in macrophages activation of ERK (by LPS) but not JNK is mediated via phosphorylation of NFκB1 p105

Effect of TRAF6 knockdown on LPS- and R837-induced TNFα (A and C) and IL6 (B and D) mRNA expression in Raw264.7 macrophages: cell transfections were performed as described in Fig. 2. 48 h after transfection, cells were serum starved for 4 h and then treated with LPS or R837 for 6 h.

essential sensitivity of LPS-induced signaling pathways to low TRAF6 levels in macrophages. Taken together, our results on the cytokine expression are generally in agreement with the findings of Hacker et al. (2006). Our results as well as that of Hacker et al.'s especially on TNFα expression are, however, in contrast to the data provided by Gohda et al. (2004). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear.

Further studies are necessary to decipher precisely the signaling proteins mediating the TRAF6-independent activation of signaling pathways by LPS. It is clear the TLRs that utilize only the MyD88 adaptor protein require TRAF6 while TLR3 that utilizes only the TRIF adaptor protein does not require TRAF6 (Gohda et al., 2004). TLR4 is unique because it utilizes both MyD88 and TRIF pathways. Other studies have shown that TLR4-stimulated TRIF pathway also utilizes TRAF6 (Sato et al., 2003). However, a role for the death-domain kinase Rip1 (receptor-interacting protein1) has also been demonstrated in TLR4-stimulated TRIF pathways (Cusson-Hermance et al., 2005). Whether LPS stimulation of macrophages results in a separate TRAF6-dependent and RIP1-dependent IKK activation is not known and will be tested in future studies. In addition, further studies are necessary to delineate the TRAF6-independent but TRIF-dependent pathways mediated by LPS.

Fig. 6. Proposed model on the role of TRAF6-sensitive and insensitive IKK pathways in macrophages: Based on the results presented in this manuscript, we propose that LPS stimulates a TRAF6-dependent (probably MyD88-dependent) and a TRAF6-independent (probably MyD88-independent and TRIF-dependent) IKK activation in macrophages.

5. Conclusions

It is now clear that cell-signaling pathways are cell type specific and are highly regulated. Using a RNA interference system in macrophages, we show here that LPS stimulates TRAF6-sensitive and insensitive signaling pathways (Fig. 6) and cytokine expression. Because TLR4 is a major target for a number of inflammatory diseases, understanding the precise signaling pathways in specialized cells such as macrophages would provide us with additional molecular targets for regulating the receptor signaling pathways in various inflammatory diseases.
