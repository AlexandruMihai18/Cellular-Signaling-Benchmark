Abstract

Oral homeostasis is dependent upon saliva and its content of proteins. Reflex salivary flow occurs at a low ‘resting’ rate and for short periods of the day more intense taste or chewing stimuli evoke up to ten fold increases in salivation. The secretion of salivary fluid and proteins is controlled by autonomic nerves. All salivary glands are supplied by cholinergic parasympathetic nerves which release acetylcholine that binds to M3 and (to a lesser extent) M1 muscarinic receptors, evoking the secretion of saliva by acinar cells in the endpieces of the salivary gland ductal tree. Most salivary glands also receive a variable innervation from sympathetic nerves which released noradrenaline from which tends to evoke greater release of stored proteins, mostly from acinar cells but also ductal cells. There is some ‘cross-talk’ between the calcium and cyclic AMP intracellular pathways coupling autonomic stimulation to secretion and salivary protein secretion is augmented during combined stimulation. Other non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neuropeptides released from autonomic nerves evoke salivary gland secretion and parasympathetically derived vasointestinal peptide, acting through endothelial cell derived nitric oxide, plays a role in the reflex vasodilatation that accompanies secretion. Neuronal type, calcium-activated, soluble nitric oxide within salivary cells appears to play a role in mediating salivary protein secretion in response to autonomimetics. Fluid secretion by salivary glands involves aquaporin 5 and the extent to which the expression of aquaporin 5 on apical acinar cell membranes is upregulated by cholinomimetics remains uncertain. Extended periods of autonomic denervation, liquid diet feeding (reduced reflex stimulation) or duct ligation cause salivary gland atrophy. The latter two are reversible, demonstrating that glands can regenerate provided that the autonomic innervation remains intact. The mechanisms by which nerves integrate with salivary cells during regeneration or during salivary gland development remain to be elucidated.

concentration compared to acid stimulated saliva (Mackie and Pangborn, 1990). There have been a few studies in which the effects of different reflex stimuli have been studied in animal models. Gjorstrup (1980) and later Ikawa et al. (1991) showed that higher concentrations of salivary amylase and other proteins were secreted into rabbit parotid saliva evoked by carrots compared to standard pelleted chow.

Nerve impulses in the afferent limbs of the salivary reflex pass to the salivary nuclei within the medulla oblongata and from these centres efferent parasympathetic secretomotor nerves emerge to supply the parenchyma of salivary glands (see Fig. 2). The integration of impulses from primary salivary centres to glands depends on central modulation. The central neural connections between primary salivary centres and other nuclei are not well understood and continue to be investigated. Retrograde labelling of neurons has demonstrated that the primary parasympathetic salivary centres form connections with the lateral hypothalamus where the regulation of feeding, drinking and body temperature occurs.

It appears that both excitatory (gamma aminobutyric acid containing) and inhibitory (glycine containing) nerves synapse with the salivary centres (Matsuo, 1999). Further evidence of the involvement of central mechanisms in modulating salivary secretion was reported following intracerebroventricular injection of pilocarpine or atropine which were found to respectively stimulate and inhibit salivation (Renzi et al., 2002; Takakura et al., 2003). However, a more recent study questioned the high doses used in the earlier work (Sato et al., 2006). Alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonists (e.g. clonidine) and antagonists (e.g. yohimbine) have been demonstrated to act centrally in studies of reflex secretion in human subjects and cholinergically evoked secretion in animal models. Alpha(2) adrenoceptor blockade increases salivary secretion whilst stimulation by alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonists inhibits secretion (Moreira et al., 2002; Phillips et al., 2000). The primary sympathetic salivary centres are located in the upper thoracic segments of the spinal cord although it remains unclear precisely where in this region (Bradley et al., 2005; Matsuo, 1999). It has been understood

Fig. 2. Salivary reflex secretion. Afferent stimuli are integrated in the primary salivary centres of the medulla. Autonomic parasympathetic efferent nerves conduct signals to salivary glands via parasympathetic ganglia situated near the target gland. Nerves project (lower broken line) from the medulla to the sympathetic centre in the upper thoracic segments of the spinal cord and from here sympathetic efferent nerves conduct signals to salivary glands via the superior cervical ganglion. Nerves project (upper broken line) from the cortex to the parasympathetic centres in the medulla and these can have an excitatory or inhibitory effect on salivary secretion. Efferent autonomic nerves stimulate salivary secretion and there is no peripheral inhibition of secretion via sympathetic nerves.

for some time that central inhibition as a result of connections between the primary salivary centres and the higher centres of the brain are responsible for the dry mouth associated with anxiety. It is worth repeating at this point that there is no peripheral inhibition of salivary secretion under normal conditions. The concept of peripheral sympathetic inhibition of salivary secretion which later became widely accepted, was appreciated as an experimental artefact over a century ago (see Garrett, 1987). Experimental electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerve supply to salivary glands or use of alpha(1) adrenoceptor agonists in anaesthetized animals leads to a vasoconstriction of glandular blood vessels in addition to activation of parenchymal cells. In contrast under reflex conditions only sympathetic secretomotor nerve fibres and not vasoactive nerve fibres to salivary glands are activated. Thus vasoconstriction is not part of the salivary reflex.

## 3. Salivary glands and their innervation

### 3.1. The development of salivary glands

During embryogenesis the major salivary glands develop from the ectoderm whereas the minor glands originate from the mesoderm. In the genetic syndrome salivary gland agenesis there is an absence of ectodermal-derived structures such as sweat glands and the major salivary glands but minor salivary glands are present (Nordgarden et al., 2001). The first visible sign of salivary glands in the embryo (e13 in rats, e8 wks in humans) involves interactions between the epithelial layer and the mesenchyme (derived from the neural crest) resulting in a local thickening of the epithelium to form a placode. Some of the signalling occurring at this stage involves Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) (Jaskoll et al., 2004), Epithelial Growth factor (EGF) and Transforming growth factor (TGF) α (Jaskoll and Melnick, 1999) and Ectodysplasin (Eda) and its receptor (EdaR) (Jaskoll et al., 2003). Each of these signalling molecules only has a partial role since mice with one of these genes knocked out have defects in, but not a complete absence of, salivary glands. Following the formation of the salivary placode salivary gland development has been well characterised as in Fig. 3.

EGF receptor and its two ligands, EGF and TGFα appear to be important in co-ordinating the regulated cell proliferation during salivary gland development. EGF is not present in the initial bud stage and so signalling occurs via TGFα localised on the cell surface and opposing mesenchyme layer. By early canalicular stage EGF is first detected in the epithelia of the terminal end buds. By late canalicular stage TGF α is newly located on the ductal epithelia facing the lumen, i.e. where most proliferation and apoptosis is occurring (Jaskoll and Melnick, 1999). If glands are removed at the canalicular stage and stimulated *in vitro* by autonnomimetics a specific group of proteins are secreted reflecting the two main cell types—Type 1 terminal tubule cells and Type 3 proacinar cells (Fig. 3D). Interestingly there are differences in which agonists cause the secretion of these proteins (Ball et al., 1988) suggesting that the different mechanisms of protein secretion (and the control thereof) seen in the adult are also present in the neonatal salivary

when catecholamine-containing nerves start to appear (Bottaro and Cutler, 1984). The development of sympathetic nerves occurs at a similar time to the development of proacinar and terminal tubule Types 1 and 3 cells into mature acinar and ductal cells and a neonatal sympathetic denervation reduced parotid acinar development (Henriks- son et al., 1985) which implies a role for the innervation in the final differentiation of Types 1 and 3 cells into functional acinar and ductal structures (Danielsson et al., 1988; Bottaro and Cutler, 1984). A dichotomy of sympathetic nerve development in the rat submandibular and sublingual glands exists since despite developing in the same capsule surrounded by the same mesenchymal cap the sublingual gland contains very few sympathetic nerves whereas the submandibular gland has a rich innervation (see Fig. 4). This presumably reflects the lack of expression of the neurotrophin NGF in sublingual glands as the expression of this molecule correlates closely with sympathetic innervation in other tissues (Glebova and Ginty, 2004).

Parasympathetic nerves develop in parallel with the salivary parenchyma and require an interaction with the parenchyma in order to develop (Coughlin, 1975). By separating the submandibular ganglion from the salivary epithelium at an early stage (e 11 in the mouse) the development of cholinesterase containing nerves was inhibited although the salivary parenchyma developed normally in the absence of the submandibular ganglion (note the opposite relationship occurs later at pro-acinar to mature cell conversion stage which requires parasympathetic input). Which signalling molecules interact between nerves and salivary cells is not clear although, as indicated above, EGF signalling is active. Several recent studies using knockout mice have indicated a significant role for glial cell derived neurotrophins (GDNFs) affecting peripheral nerve innervation. Glial cells (also known as Schwann cells) support, guide and interact with nerve axons right up to the target cell. Although parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves enter glands from separate sources they quickly align themselves and combined parasympathetic/sympathetic/Schwann cell bundles are common throughout most salivary glands (Garrett and

Fig. 3. The development of rat submandibular salivary glands. Starting at embryonic day e12/13 the initial bud stage (A) there is a proliferation and infolding of the epithelial layer (E) of the oral cavity (OC) into the adjoining condensed mesenchyme (CM) to form the pseudoglandular stage (B) in which an elongated cord of epithelial (E) cells extends into the surrounding mesenchyme (M). The appearance of a ductal cell lumen (L) characterises the onset of the canicular stage (C) and the terminal bud stage is reached once lumena extend into the epithelial buds (D). At this stage two cell types are apparent-type 3 pro-acinar cells and type 1 terminal tubules cells. From birth to day 30 salivary glands develop their mature phenotype (E) of acinar cells and intercalated, granular and striated ductal cells.

gland. Between birth and adult (Fig. 3E) Type 3 proacinar cells develop into acini (Ac) and eventually sero-mucous cells whilst Type 1 cells maintain a central location possibly forming intercalated cells (Hand et al., 1996; Jaskoll and Melnick, 1999); striated ducts (SD) appear to develop post-natally (Redman et al., 2002).

### 3.2. The development of nerves in salivary glands

Saliva can be produced from rat salivary glands at birth by stimulating parasympathetic nerves implying a functional neuro-epithelial junction although sympathetic nerves and secretory granule movement in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation does not occur until 3–5 days after birth

Fig. 4. Sympathetic nerves in rat salivary glands. Catecholamine fluorescence of cells from digested rat parotid (A), sublingual (B) and submandibular (C) glands. Both parotid and submandibular glands have a dense sympathetic innervation particularly surrounding the acini (Ac) but also present on ductal structures (Dc), whereas the sublingual gland has a sparse sympathetic innervation except around the occasional duct.

Kidd, 1993). For parasympathetic nerves the main GDNF appears to be neururin acting on GDNF family receptor alpha 2 (GFRα2) molecules expressed by nerve axons which appears to be important for the development of peripheral fibres. Knocking out GFRα2 greatly reduced the parasympathetic innervation of acini in the sublingual gland (Rossi et al., 1999). For sympathetic nerves, Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been known for a long time to be important. Indeed NGF was first isolated from rodent salivary glands (Cohen, 2004) as they have such a high concentration. NGF acts through a high (TrkA) and a low affinity receptor (p75)-TrkA promotes cell survival and axon elongation and p75 activation invokes cell death (Dechant and Barde, 2002). Knocking out p75 actually enhanced sympathetic innervation of mouse submandibular glands (Jahed and Kawaja, 2005) whereas knocked out NGF inhibited sympathetic innervation of salivary glands (Ghasemlou et al., 2004).

The guidance molecules for nerves in salivary glands are unknown but by comparison with other models (Zou, 2004) Wnt binding to frizzled receptors could be important to axon guidance by acting as both attractants and repellents whilst ectodysplasin A (Eda) and its receptor (EdaR) also have forward and reverse signalling capabilities (Hinck, 2004). Secreted frizzled (1 and 4) are strongly expressed by salivary cells at e15.5, (Leimeister et al., 1998) and WNT4 mRNA expression has been shown to be increasingly expressed in mouse from e14 to adult—in fact, with NGF it is one of the few proteins to be actively increased from post-partum day 5 to adult (Hoffman et al., 2002).

### 3.3. Innervation of adult salivary glands

From the two separate nerve supplies to the salivary gland sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves run together with Schwann cells as one bundle up to the target cell (Garrett and Kidd, 1993). From there some nerves may supply several more target cells as unmyelinated axons. There appears to be no specialised neuro-effector sites, neurotransmitter release may occur anywhere along the nerve, although nerve terminals may have a bulbous ending and varicosities along the length of the nerve (Ohtani et al., 1983) these should not be thought of as the only place where neurotransmitter release may occur. Furthermore electron microscopical studies have indicated that two types of nerve-epithelial cell relationship exist—epilemmal and hypolemmal (Garrett and Kidd, 1993). Epilemmal nerve arrangements sit on top of the epithelial cell, surrounded by a Schwann cell, and are considered less efficient, in terms of neurotransmission, as the neurotransmitter must pass through two basement membranes (Schwann cell and epithelial cell) to reach the receptor. Hypolemmal nerves sit between epithelial cells and are not surrounded by Schwann cell. However, no evidence exists for any difference between their relative efficiencies of each nerve arrangement. The relative proportion of epi- and hypolemmal nerves varies according to the gland being studied — for instance the rat parotid has

epi- and hypolemmal nerves whereas the rat submandibular has only epilemmal nerves (Garrett and Kidd, 1993) although interestingly, hypolemmal nerves exist in the developing rat submandibular gland (Yohro, 1971).

Parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves appear to be in contact with most cell types in salivary glands. Most nerve staining is associated with the acinar cells and their associated myoepithelial cells which both receive dual innervation (see Figs. 1 and 4). Although the rat sublingual has a paucity of adrenergic innervation some sympathetic nerves were seen associated with striated ducts and blood vessels (Garrett et al., 1991). Blood vessels also have dual innervation—parasympathetic stimulation causing vasodilation and sympathetic stimulation vasoconstriction, although it should be remembered that such vasoconstriction is not part of the salivary reflex (Bernard, 1858 cited in (Garrett, 1999)). Vasodilation in the rat submandibular caused by acetylcholine and VIP release from parasympathetic nerves (Anderson and Garrett, 1998) is mediated by nitric oxide and other endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (Anderson et al., 2006) — nitric oxide appears to be less important as the size of the blood vessel decreases.

As well as the main neurotransmitters acetylcholine and adrenaline there are other non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) transmitters within nerves in salivary glands. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurokinin A (NKA), substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have all been detected within either parasympathetic, sympathetic or sometimes both nerves (reviewed in (Ekstrom, 1999)). These neuropeptides can have effects on the blood vessels and on the salivary cells enhancing protein and/or fluid secretory responses (see later). There is some specific localisation of peptide containing nerves as VIP nerves are more numerous around the mucous acinar cells in the human submandibular gland (Kusakabe et al., 1998), their expression may change with salivary gland development (Virta et al., 1992) and focal infiltrates of inflammatory cells may downregulate nerve expression of neuropeptides (Pedersen et al., 2000). Some of these NANC transmitters are also found in sensory nerve fibres within the salivary glands. By using the sensory neurotoxin capsaicin to destroy sensory nerve fibres only nerves containing both CGRP and SP, usually located around ducts and blood vessels, were diminished (Dunerengstrom et al., 1985).

## 4. The short term effects of autonomic nerves on salivary function

The efferent autonomic secretomotor nerves supplying salivary glands stimulate secretion and there is no antagonism between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system (Emmelin, 1987). Garrett (1987) produced a useful summary of the effects of parasympathetic and sympathetic impulses on salivary glands (Table 1).

Table 1  
Effects of autonomic nerves on salivary gland function (modified from Garrett, 1987)

**Parasympathetic stimulation**

1) Is mediated mainly by acetylcholine in combination with NANC peptides (e.g., VIP)  
2) Evokes most of the salivary fluid secreted. Mainly acts through M3 and to a lesser extent M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors  
3) Causes variable degrees of exocytosis from salivary cells but is responsible for most mucin secretion by mucous glands  
4) Induces contraction of myoepithelial cells  
5) Increases glandular blood flow as part of the salivary reflex  

**Sympathetic stimulation**

1) Is mediated mainly by noradrenaline and acts essentially on cells receiving parasympathetic impulses, which tends to produce synergistic effects, but exerts little effect on mucous gland secretion  
2) Often does not cause much mobilization of fluid but DOES NOT inhibit salivary secretion  
3) Tends to modulate the composition of saliva by increasing exocytosis from salivary cells  
4) Induces contraction of myoepithelial cells  
5) Exerts control on glandular blood flow but NOT as part of the salivary reflex  

It can be seen from Table 1 that parasympathetic impulses usually evoke most of the fluid secretion into saliva whilst sympathetic nerves have less of a fluid evoking role. There has been a tendency to dichotomize the respective roles of the nerves further by attributing salivary protein secretion almost entirely to sympathetic nerve impulses. The latter is an oversimplification since various studies have demonstrated that parasympathetically mediated impulses can give rise to substantial protein secretion (e.g., Asking and Gjorstrup, 1987). Nevertheless, the importance of sympathetically mediated impulses in evoking protein secretion is demonstrated by experiments in which electrical stimulation of the

When these stimulations are combined, amylase secretion is greater than the sum of the individual stimulations (Asking, 1985).

Such dual stimulation experiments are thought to better

reflect the events leading to reflex secretion of saliva, since it is expected that both parasympathetic and sympathetic impulses are acting on secretory cells simultaneously. Studies of reflex salivary secretion have shown that the protein content of saliva is decreased in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade or acute sympathetic denervation compared to glands without such blockade (e.g. Ikawa et al., 1991) or denervation (Fig. 6B; (Matsuo et al., 2000).

Most of the protein secreted by salivary glands is derived from protein storage granules in acinar cells by a process of exocytosis (Castle et al., 1975; Segawa and Yamashina, 1998). Sympathetic stimulation causes a morphologically obvious depletion of storage granules from acinar cells in most salivary glands studied. However, in studies of the rat parotid and submandibular glands the morphological effects of parasympathetic stimulation were barely discernable, compared to obvious degranulation with sympathetic stimulation, even when the conditions of parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation were adjusted to evoke similar amounts of protein secretion (Asking and Gjorstrup, 1987; Garrett et al., 1991). These observations fuelled the sometimes furious debate concerning the role of acinar cell non-storage granule vesicular secretory routes in salivary protein secretion. More recent *in vivo* studies have shown that salivary proteins accumulate in the ductal system of salivary glands in the absence of stimulation (Garrett et al., 1996; Proctor et al., 2003) whilst *in vitro* radiolabelling studies have demonstrated the rapid secretion of newly synthesised secretory proteins via a non-storage granule route (Castle and Castle, 1996). The latter protein secretion pathway was referred to as the minor regulated pathway in view of its up-regulation by low doses of autonomimetics. The composition of proteins secreted by storage granules and vesicles differs and the mechanisms enabling selective sequestration of different proteins are still being studied in a variety of exocrine cells including salivary acinar cells (Gorr et al., 2005). So the existence of autonomically regulated vesicular protein transport pathways is now more widely accepted. A recent series of studies by the present authors have established that vesicular transcytosis of IgA across glandular epithelial cells is also subject to autonomic regulation (see Proctor and Carpenter, 2002). Both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimuli cause increased salivary secretion of sIgA (Fig. 7) and appear to regulate such secretion through the transcytosis of the epithelial polymeric immunoglobulin receptor containing vesicles.

It must be emphasized that the effects of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve impulses on protein secretion from salivary glands can differ between glands in the same species and between the same gland in different species. The rat parotid and submandibular glands and more recently the mouse submandibular gland are the most frequently employed models for salivary gland studies. Consequently these glands have become our reference points and the many earlier studies on glands in other species are largely ignored. Morphologically the cat submandibular gland more closely

resembles the human gland than does the rat submandibular gland and studies of the effects of nerve stimulation on the main parenchymal cells proved revealing (see Garrett, 1987). Both divisions of the autonomic nervous system exerted an effect on protein secretion from central acinar, demilunar and striated duct cells. The amounts of protein secreted from each cell type differed depending upon the nerve being stimulated. The sparse adrenergic (sympathetic) innervation of mucous secreting glands such as the rat and human sublingual and the human minor salivary glands appears to be directed to the vasculature rather than the parenchyma (Garrett and Anderson, 1991; Rossoni et al., 1979). Thus sympathetic nerve stimulation *in vivo* and adrenergic stimulation *in vitro* evoked little mucin secretion. Rather, mucin secretion from these mucous glands is dependent upon parasympathetic stimulation and peptidergic stimulation (Culp et al., 1991). Thus, although parasympathetic nerve mediated stimuli appear to universally cause fluid secretion from salivary glands, the role of the sympathetic innervation in evoking protein secretion is variable.

The functional significance of vesicular transport with regard to salivary protein secretion remains uncertain. However, vesicular transport is crucial for the delivery of membrane ion transport proteins to cell membranes. Such proteins allow the movement of sodium, chloride and bicarbonate into the lumen of the secretory endpiece and the osmotic gradient created leads to water movement and hence saliva is formed (Melvin et al., 2005). This anion (chloride and bicarbonate) dependent model of salivary secretion is now accepted and many of the significant membrane transport proteins have been identified. The route by which water crosses epithelial cells, whether transcellular or paracellular, has been debated for some time (Young et al., 1987). The discovery of water channels or aquaporins (see Verkman, 2005) led to studies of the role played by these channels in fluid secretion. Active fluid
transport in some tissues, e.g. sweat glands and intestinal cells, is aquaporin independent but in tissues such as kidney and salivary gland, where fluid transport per unit surface area is much higher, aquaporins play a role (Verkman, 2005). Aquaporins 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 have been detected in salivary cells and salivary glands (Gresz et al., 2001; Hoque et al., 2002; Ishikawa et al., 2000). Of these, aquaporin 5 is expressed in apical membranes and aquaporin 3 in basolateral membranes of acinar cells and therefore have been implicated in mediating water transport into saliva (Gresz et al., 2001). The importance of aquaporin 5 has been confirmed by the observation that salivary fluid secretion is decreased by 50% in aquaporin 5 knockout mice but is unaffected in aquaporin 3 knockout mice (Melvin et al., 2005). A series of studies on rat parotid gland slices *in vitro* utilized membrane fractionation in order to quantify aquaporin 5 in the apical plasma membrane. The results of these experiments indicated that aquaporin 5 expression in the apical plasma membrane is subject to rapid increases following stimulation with autonomimetics (Ishikawa et al., 2000). Subsequent *in vivo* studies utilizing autonomimetics failed to show changes in aquaporin 5 expression on apical plasma membranes as determined immunocytochemically by light and electron microscopy (Gresz et al., 2004). Given the great increase in vesicular and storage granule trafficking and membrane turnover during stimulated salivary secretion it would appear that aquaporin 5 is somehow anchored to the apical plasma membrane in order to be retained there for the duration of stimulated secretion.

In addition to the effects on parenchymal cells autonomic nerves exercise short term regulation of salivary gland blood flow. Parasympathetic vasodilation is an integral part of the salivary reflex as demonstrated recently in the rat submandibular gland (Mizuta et al., 2000; Anderson et al., 2006). Sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction is under separate vasomotor control and independent of the salivary reflex (Emmelin and Engstrom, 1960). Parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves also cause contraction of myoepithelial cells which embrace the secretory endpieces of salivary glands like ‘an octopus sitting on a rock’ (Tamarin, 1966). In fact the extent of the embrace does vary between glands, for example in the rat parotid gland myoepithelial cells are mainly associated with intercalated duct cells. Since myoepithelial cells respond to lower doses of autonomimetics and low electrical nerve stimulation frequencies than parenchymal cells it seems that contraction may slightly precede secretion and possibly serve to enhance the expulsion of saliva, particularly the more viscous secretions of mucous glands. Such contraction may help to propel saliva from the acinus and to prevent extravasation of saliva into the gland interstitium (Garrett, 1998).

The release of acetylcholine from parasympathetic nerves and its interaction with muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) regulates many fundamental functions in the periphery (smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretion, modulation of cardiac output) and CNS (motor control, thermoregulation, memory). Five subtypes of mAChR, M₁–M₅, have been designated on the basis of cDNA cloning and the interactions of agonists and antagonists with these receptors along with their intracellular coupling through different G proteins, continues to be characterized (Caulfield and Birdsall, 1998). It is clear that release of acetylcholine from parasympathetic nerves acting via mAChRs plays the main role in evoking fluid secretion since secretion is almost completely abolished by atropine. There has been a widespread acceptance based on studies of the rat parotid gland, that salivary secretion is mediated entirely by M3 receptors (Baum and Wellner, 1999). Pharmacological studies of rabbit and rat submandibular and rat sublingual salivary glands indicate that fluid secretion is also partially mediated by M1 and other non-M3 receptors (Culp et al., 1996; Tobin et al., 2002; Tobin, 1995). Recent studies of knockout mice has enabled a greater understanding of the involvement of different mAChR subtypes in salivary secretion (Gautam et al., 2004; Nakamura et al., 2004). These studies indicate that both M1 and M3 receptors make a contribution to the secretion of whole mouth saliva (the combined secretion of all of the salivary glands) evoked by pilocarpine and other muscarinic agonists. The M1 receptor appears to make more of a contribution at higher doses of pilocarpine whilst the M3 receptor mediates secretion in response to lower doses of agonist. Stimulation via both M1 and M3 receptors is coupled to secretion through a G-protein/phospholipase C generation of inositol triphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol. The interaction of IP₃ with IP₃ receptors (IP₃R’s) on the endoplasmic reticulum causes release of stored calcium (Baum and Wellner, 1999; Gallacher and Smith, 1999). Rises in intracellular calcium open apical membrane chloride channels and basolateral membrane potassium channels in acinar cells leading to electrolyte and water secretion (Melvin et al., 2005). Studies of carbachol induced calcium signalling in mAChR knock-out mice suggest that, unlike M3 receptors, M1 receptors are not ubiquitously expressed on submandibular acinar cells (Nakamura et al., 2004).

Noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerves stimulates salivary secretion through alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Alpha1-adrenoceptor mediated signals follow a similar intracellular calcium pathway as described for M1 and M3 (above) leading to fluid secretion (Baum and Wellner, 1999). Beta1-adrenoceptor signalling mainly occurs through G-protein/adenylate cyclase generation of intracellular cAMP followed by activation of protein kinase A and phosphorylation of endogenous proteins leading to exocytosis of protein storage granules and salivary protein secretion (Baum and Wellner, 1999).

Signalling from parasympathetic nerves can give rise to substantial salivary protein secretion. Such protein secretion may be due in part to release of the neuropeptide co-

5. The coupling of autonomic nerve stimulation to secretion

The principal neurotransmitters activating salivary cell secretion are acetylcholine, secreted by parasympathetic nerves and noradrenaline, secreted by sympathetic nerves.
transmitter vasointestinal polypeptide (VIP) (Ekstrom, 1999). VIP intracellular signalling occurs through cAMP as described for noradrenaline signalling. However, cholinergic stimuli can give rise to the release of protein by a coupling mechanism independent of cAMP, involving elevated intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C (Moller et al., 1996).

Experiments have been undertaken in which salivary glands are stimulated simultaneously through the sympathetic nerve supply on a background of parasympathetic nerve stimulation or through combined use of sympatho- and parasympathomimetics, since such combined stimulation occurs during reflex secretion. Under these experimental conditions an ‘augmented’ secretion of salivary fluid is observed in cats and dogs (Emmelin, 1987) and an augmented secretion of amylase occurs in rabbit and rat parotid glands (see Fig. 5). The latter effect appears to be dependent upon beta adrenergically mediated stimuli since it is produced by isoprenaline and abolished by beta blockers (Asking, 1985). A similar augmented secretion has been observed *in vitro* in rat acinar cells (Tanimura et al., 1999) and appears to reflect a ‘cross-talk’ between the intracellular calcium and cAMP secretory signalling pathways. It has also been observed with VIP, a cAMP mobilising agonist, in combination with either phentolamine, acetylcholine or substance P, all of which mobilize intracellular calcium (Bobyock and Chemick, 1989). The mechanism of cross-talk may involve a potentiation of the release of calcium due to phosphorylation of inositol triphosphate receptors by cAMP dependent protein kinase A (Straub et al., 2002).

Parasympathetically evoked vasodilation persists in the presence of atropine, an observation originally made at the end of the 19th century. Thulin (1976) observed that a small secretion of parasympathetically evoked rat submandibular saliva also persisted in the presence of atropine. Further studies undertaken by Ekstrom and other researchers has demonstrated that in addition to the main neurotransmitters there are a variety of NANC neuropeptide transmitters (Ekstrom, 1999). The study of peptidergic NANC stimulated salivary secretion mainly concerns the neuropeptides released by parasympathetic nerves in response to relatively high nerve stimulation frequencies. Such overt atropine resistant secretion fades with continued stimulation, reflecting the exhaustable stores of peptide in dense cored vesicles in nerve endings (Ekstrom et al., 1989). It is likely that neuropeptides are released from parasympathetic nerves with acetylcholine even at lower stimulation frequencies and that they modulate the protein and fluid secretory responses of salivary glands. The coupling of peptide stimulation to secretion differs according to the peptide. For example, VIP has been shown to evoke rises in adenosine 3′,5′-(cyclic) monophosphate (cAMP) whilst substance P causes increases in intracellular calcium. Studies of atropine resistant vasodilation demonstrated that VIP acted largely through activation of endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the generation of nitric oxide (Ekstrom, 1999; Edwards and Garrett, 1993) leading to the activation

soluble guanylate cyclase and generation of guanosine 3′,5′-(cyclic) monophosphate or cGMP. In earlier studies it was apparent that the cGMP second messenger pathway could mediate amylase secretion in response to parasympathetic stimulation, at least in some glands (Watson et al., 1982). However, cAMP was recognised as being the most potent mediator of amylase secretion, being up-regulated in response to sympathetic stimulation and cGMP was concluded to be of secondary importance (Butcher and Putney, 1980). More recently, interest in cGMP as a mediator in salivary secretion has been re-awakened, due mainly to the studies of atropine resistant vasodilation when it became apparent that L-NAME (*N*-nitro-*L*-arginine methyl ester), an inhibitor of NOS, also partially inhibited salivary protein secretion. Further studies confirmed a role for nitric oxide in mediating protein secretion in response to parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation (e.g. Buckle et al., 1995). It is now apparent from studies of rat and mouse salivary glands that nitric oxide and generation of cGMP can be linked to the release of calcium from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores via production of the calcium mobilising nucleotide cADP-ribose (Harmer et al., 2001; Looms et al., 2001). The source of nitric oxide in the above signalling cascade appears to be from neuronal type calcium dependent NOS of non-neuronal origin as shown by fluorescence microscopy of acinar cells loaded with a nitric oxide indicator (Looms et al., 2001) and *in vivo* denervation studies (Sayardoust and Ekstrom, 2003). Studies in the rabbit parotid gland suggest that nitric oxide production and subsequent downstream signalling through cGMP are calcium dependent (Sugiya et al., 1998). These data suggest that initially elevated intracellular calcium leads to further increases in intracellular calcium via nitric oxide, cGMP and cADPribose as shown in Fig. 8. It may also be that diffusion of nitric oxide into adjacent cells plays a role in co-ordinating the secretory response in acini (Harmer et al., 2001). Nitric oxide has therefore been demonstrated to make a significant contribution to salivary protein secretion in response to autonomic stimulation. However, there remain some unexplained observations. For example, rat parotid acinar cells appear to show a degree of dependency upon nitric oxide production during isoprenaline evoked amylase secretion and it is not clear how NOS activation takes place under these circumstances. Cholinergic stimulation, which leads to rises in intracellular calcium, does not appear to lead to significant nitric oxide evoked amylase secretion in some studies (Sayardoust and Ekstrom, 2003). Nevertheless, rat parotid acinar cells contain calcium dependent neuronal type NOS and soluble guanylate cyclase activity (Shimomura et al., 2004). It is apparent that the extent of nitric oxide induced protein secretion differs in different salivary glands.

Fig. 8. Signalling pathways for nitric oxide (NO) in salivary cells. Salivary cells contain neural type nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which can generate NO and activate guanylate cyclase with the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The activation of NOS (NOS*) may occur through inositol triphosphate (IP3) signalling from muscarinic receptor or alpha-adrenoceptor occupation. cGMP can cause further release of calcium from ryanodine sensitive stores via protein kinase G, and cADPribose which may lead to further NO generation. NO may also diffuse to neighbouring acinar cells and act through similar intracellular signalling. NO may also be generated as a result of raised intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from beta-adrenoceptor or vasointestinal peptide (VIP) receptor occupation and activation of guanylate cyclase (GC*).

response to isoprenaline (a beta-adrenoceptor agonist) from isolated parotid cells (Melvin et al., 1988). Whereas 1 week of sympathectomy reduced parasympathetically mediated secretion of secretory IgA, a non-storage product transported by polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (Proctor et al., 2000). The decreased IgA secretion appeared to be related to decreased routing of plgR to the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells and others have shown an effect of parasympathetic stimulation on localisation of proteins to membranes (Ishikawa et al., 2000). A further difference between stored proteins was seen in the rat submandibular gland following 1 week of pre-ganglionic sympathectomy where parasympathetic nerve stimulation increased stored protein secretion but not IgA secretion into saliva (Proctor et al., 2000). So, sympathectomy can increase cholinergically-mediated protein secretion and interestingly the opposite may also be true, i.e. 1 week parasympathectomy can increase sympathetically-mediated fluid secretion (Carpenter et al., 2005; Proctor et al., 1990). These cross-over effects, whereby removing the influence of one nerve can heighten the functions of the opposite nerve may reflect the cross-talk between the parasympathetic and sympathetic inputs to individual (and mostly acinar) cells that has been suggested by dual stimulation experiments on intact glands (Carpenter et al., 2000; Anderson et al., 1995). Interestingly the changes in cellular sensitivity following denervation are not reflected by changes in receptor density nor binding constants (or to changes in the cellular content of the secretory protein, see (Ekstrom, 1999) for a review) and further work is required therefore to untangle these complexities.

### 6.2. The effects of denervation on salivary gland structure

Acute sympathectomy (1 week) caused an increased gland weight due to the accumulation of secretory material within glands whereas longer sympathetic denervation caused the gland to reduce in weight (Proctor and Asking, 1989). Following 1 week of pre-ganglionic parasympathectomy (Carpenter et al., 2005; Chaparro et al., 1998; Katsukawa et al., 1990) the size of submandibular acini was reduced (although DNA levels stayed the same) whereas granular tubules – which appear to be more dependent on hormonal influences – remained unchanged (Anderson et al., 1994). In contrast, knocking out both the M₁ and M₃ had no apparent effects on parenchymal structure (Nakamura et al., 2004) though a detailed analysis was not published. This may suggest that the presence of parasympathetic nerves (in the knock out mouse) was enough to prevent atrophy seen in the rat suggesting a role for other non-cholinergic neurotransmitters such as substance P and VIP (see Ekstrom, 1999).

### 6.1. Effects of denervations on salivary secretion

Secretion from denervated glands is complex and varies according to the different routes of protein secretion, the form of stimulation given and the gland studied. For instance, amylase secretion (released from protein storage granules) from parotid glands following 1 week of sympathectomy increased in response to parasympathetic stimulation (Asking and Emmelin, 1989) but decreased in

### 6.3. The involvement of nerves in salivary gland regeneration

Switching the feed for a rat from solid chow to a liquid diet causes a severe atrophy of the salivary glands (Hand and

Ho, 1981) and the hyperplastic response of switching back to a solid diet or moving to a bulk diet was inhibited by a double denervation (Schneyer et al., 1992). Chronic beta adrenoceptor stimulation with isoprenaline can also induce salivary gland hyperplasia with the upregulation of a specific set of secretory proteins (Johnson, 1984). Interestingly both isoprenaline-induced and reflexly-induced increases in gland size were mediated in part by NGF (Purushotham et al., 1993). Conversely chronic pilocarpine administration to mimic increased parasympathetic impulses did not cause a change in gland size (Muller et al., 1985) although just 30 min of parasympathetic nerve stimulation is enough to cause significant mitogenic activity (Schneyer et al., 1993) again suggesting a greater trophic role for neuropeptides rather than the classical neurotransmitters.

Nerves also play a role in salivary gland regeneration following duct ligation induced atrophy. Our own experiments have used the ligation and deligation of the rat submandibular duct to examine the influence of nerves on the regeneration of salivary glands from an atrophic state. Initial studies indicate that parasympathetic, but not sympathetic,

Fig. 10. Comparison of salivary flow from affected and contra-lateral control submandibular glands in a group of ten patients with sialolithiasis. Saliva was collected using a novel suction technique pre-operatively and at 6 months post-operative follow-up. Mean salivary flow was reduced to 16% in the affected glands and recovered to approximately 47% by 6 months (Osailan, 2004).

nerves are important in regenerating salivary glands. Following 1 week of ligation, a pre-ganglionic parasympathectomy reduced gland recovery by 50% after 4 weeks of deligation compared with control glands that had been deligated alone. Secretory capacity, as evaluated by whole body methacholine stimulation, revealed that denervated and deligated glands only secreted ~60% of the salivary flow compared to normally innervated deligated glands. Morphologically (see Fig. 9) acini in denervated and deligated glands did not regenerate as completely since they were smaller and the intercalated ducts longer than those of regenerating glands with intact parasympathetic innervation. These findings are interesting because the intercalated ducts have some features of the immature pro-acinar phenotype possibly suggesting they are the source of developing new acinar cells (Denny et al., 1997). The lack of parasympathetic input therefore may prevent the conversion of intercalated cells into acinar units. A similar role for parasympathetic nerves has also been shown in the developing gland where a parasympathectomy at birth limited subsequent salivary gland weight to 40% and greatly reduced the spreading and development of the myoepithelial cells surrounding acini (Murakami et al., 1991). Likewise sympathetic denervation at birth (when pro-acinar and terminal tubule cells are maturing) caused a significant reduction in gland size (9 weeks later) with a reduction in secretory granule content (Henriksson et al., 1985). In the same series of experiments chronic beta blockade of adrenoceptors did not cause the same changes, again suggesting a role for NANC transmitters in the development of salivary glands although this has not been followed-up.

Fig. 9. H and E staining of formol sucrose fixed rat submandibular glands following ligation (1 week) and deligation (4 weeks). In addition the gland (panel B) was parasympathectomised at the point of deligation. The added effect of a parasympathectomy has reduced acinar (Ac) size and increased the length of the intercalated ducts (ID) making them more obvious. Other ducts (Dc) appear similar in both glands.

7. Conclusions and clinical perspective

It is clear that autonomic nerves have a considerable influence on salivary glands. In addition to controlling immediate secretion from salivary cells nerves are also involved
in maintaining salivary gland size in order to deliver the volume and composition of secretion that meets functional demands. The latter must involve influencing mitosis to generate new cells, developing cells into their mature functional state and controlling responsiveness to parasympathetic and sympathetic inputs. The effects of denervations are complex and underline the complex roles that nerves play in maintaining salivary glands. Our knowledge of the different intracellular signalling cascades involved in mediating nerve derived stimuli has greatly increased but it remains unclear how these different signalling mechanisms are integrated and the extent to which ‘cross-talk’ occurs. The role of muscarinic receptor sub-types in mediating salivary secretion is of particular clinical interest at present since a range of muscarinic receptor agonists and antagonists have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, nociceptive pain, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, urinary incontinence, irritable bowel syndrome, gastric ulceration and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ([Eglen et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-5122(99)00041-1)). A frequent side effect of the use of muscarinic antagonists is dry mouth (xerostomia). In order to develop more selective muscarinic antagonists without the xerostomic side effect we need to gain an understanding of how different muscarinic receptor subtypes are involved in the physiological control of salivary secretion ([Proctor, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autneu.2006.03.005)). In addition to action at peripheral autonomic receptors many prescribed drugs appear to exert side effects on salivary secretion via a central action ([Scully, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9868(03)00003-8)). The list of drugs producing xerostomia as a side effect is extensive (see [Sreebny and Schwartz, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3913(97)00003-2); [http://www.drymouth.info](http://www.drymouth.info)).

The mechanisms by which nerves exert trophic influences on salivary glands requires further study and may lead to novel approaches for therapeutic intervention in salivary gland disease. The latter may involve the use of exogenous stem cells to regenerate salivary glands following irreversible damage from irradiation or chronic inflammation. Clearly the success of such approaches will depend upon the presence of autonomic nerves and the integration of newly formed secretory structures with nerves. Recent studies have demonstrated that human salivary glands like animal models, have the capacity to regenerate. Following removal of salivary ductal stones by minimally invasive surgical techniques inflamed, atrophic salivary glands regain secretory function progressively over the ensuing 6–12 months ([Fig. 10](#fig:10); [Osailan, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2004.01.002)). The latter indicates that human glands are able to regenerate and re-integrate secretory structures with the autonomic innervation.
