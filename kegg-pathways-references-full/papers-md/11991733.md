Distinct Signaling Pathways Mediate Cardiomyocyte Phospholipase D Stimulation by Endothelin-1 and Thrombin. Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology (2002) 34, 441–453. Several G protein-coupled receptors which stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) also activate phospholipase D (PLD) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we characterized PLD activation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by the PLC-stimulatory thrombin receptor PAR1, in comparison to the endothelin-1 receptor ETAR, which induces PLD stimulation by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) δ and ε. Similar to ETAR, activation of PAR1 induced PLD stimulation, which, however, was insensitive to PKC inhibition. Furthermore, in contrast to ETAR, PLD stimulation by PAR1 was suppressed by overexpression of regulators of G protein signaling specific for G₁₂-type G proteins and treatment with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases. On the other hand, inactivation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B and treatment with general tyrosine kinase inhibitors suppressed PAR1- and ETAR- as well as phorbol ester-induced PLD stimulation and was associated with a fall in the cellular level of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂). We conclude that, in contrast to ETAR-PLD coupling, PAR1-induced cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation is PKC-independent and mediated by G₁₂-type G proteins and ARF GTPases, while Rho and tyrosine kinases regulate PLD stimulation by either receptor, apparently by controlling the cellular level of PIP₂, a common regulator of PLD activity.

## Introduction

Stimulation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PLD) has been described in diverse tissues and cell types for a wide variety of hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors (for reviews see Refs 1–5). In particular, numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known to stimulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) have been shown to mediate PLD stimulation. Many

distinct cellular factors have been reported to be involved in PLD stimulation by GPCRs, including pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive or -insensitive heterotrimeric G proteins, protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, as yet unidentified tyrosine kinases, monomeric GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and Rho protein families, and the phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂).¹⁻⁵ There is, however, apparently a large cell- and/or receptor-specific heterogeneity in the mechanisms of GPCR-induced PLD stimulation, and only scarce information exists on the type of PLD isozyme mediating stimulation of PLD activity by a given GPCR in a certain cell type. The two mammalian PLD isozymes cloned and characterized so far, PLD1 or PLD2, are dependent on PIP₂ for activity.⁶⁻⁸ While PLD1 is strongly activated by ARF and Rho GTPases as well as by conventional PKC isozymes, PLD2 exhibits *in vitro* a high “basal” activity in the presence of PIP₂ and is only modestly stimulated by PKC and ARF GTPases.¹⁻⁸ This PLD isozyme was recently reported to be inhibited by α-actinin, which was reversed by ARF proteins,⁹ suggesting that *in vivo* PLD2 activity may be controlled by similar factors to PLD1.

Several GPCRs known to stimulate PLC, such as endothelin-1 receptor subtype A (ETₐR), bradykinin B₂ receptors, and α₁-adrenoceptors, have been demonstrated to mediate PLD stimulation in isolated cardiomyocytes.¹⁰ Furthermore, based on data obtained with various PKC inhibitors, PKC downregulation, and activation of specific PKC isozymes, it was concluded that activation of PLC-dependent PKC, most likely PKCδ and ε, plays an essential role for cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by the ETₐR.¹⁰,¹¹ Similar to the above mentioned GPCRs, thrombin acting through the protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR1) has been reported to induce PLC stimulation and hypertrophic responses in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.¹²,¹³

As PLD and its reaction product, phosphatidic acid, are assumed to participate in cardiac hypertrophy,¹⁴ we examined in the present study whether, and by which mechanisms, thrombin stimulates PLD activity in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, in comparison to the established PLD activator endothelin-1. We report that thrombin stimulates cardiomyocyte PLD and that the mechanism of this stimulation is, at least in part, very distinct from that used by endothelin-1, particularly with regard to the type of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in PLD stimulation by these GPCR agonists, as well as participation of PKC and ARF GTPases. Furthermore, evidence is provided suggesting that Rho GTPases and tyrosine kinases control the cellular level of PIP₂ and thereby contribute to regulation of cardiomyocyte PLD activity independent of the stimulus applied.

# Materials and Methods

## Cell culture and membrane preparation

Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated from the ventricular myocardium of 0–3 days old Wistar rats as described before. These preparations contain more than 95% of cardiac myocytes.¹⁵ Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 10⁶ cells per 60 mm culture dish and cultured in minimum essential medium, 10% (by vol.) fetal calf serum, 1% (by mass) penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% (by mass) 5′-bromo-deoxyuridine, 4 days prior to labeling and/or infection with recombinant adenoviruses. After 3 days in culture, cells were checked for viability and only culture dishes with homogenously beating cardiomyocytes were used for the experiments. For membrane preparation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the dishes, and homogenized in 2 ml KHCO₃ buffer (1 mM KHCO₃, 2 μg/μl aprotinine). After centrifugation (30 min at 14 600 × g), the crude membranes were resuspended in KHCO₃ buffer.

## Construction of and infection with recombinant adenoviruses

The construction of the recombinant adenoviruses encoding human regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) and the RGS domain of mouse Lsc (Lsc-RGS) has been described before.¹⁶ The recombinant adenovirus encoding the RGS homology domain of human KIAA380, a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor related to p115RhoGEF and its murine homolog Lsc,¹⁷ was constructed identically. Briefly, the cDNA coding for the RGS domain of KIAA380 (aa 268–485) was amplified by standard PCR and subcloned into the pET15b vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The DNA sequence was verified by automated sequencing. The cDNA encoding KIAA380-RGS plus an N-terminal His₆-sequence (out of the pET15b vector) was further subcloned into the pAdTrack vector. After homologous recombination with the pAdEasy vector (both vectors were kindly provided by Dr B. Vogelstein),¹⁸ the construct was linearized and transfected into HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Gibco-BRL, Karlsruhe, Germany). After several

cycles of amplification, the recombinant viruses were purified over a CsCl₂ gradient and stored as high titer stock with 1.34 × 10⁷ plaque-forming units/µl. If not otherwise indicated, the cardiomyocytes were infected 48 h prior to PLD assays at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Before the assay, infected cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy, as the constructs additionally expressed green fluorescent protein under the control of an independent CMV promoter.¹⁸ The Ad5lacZ virus, which was used as a control,¹⁶ was a kind gift of Dr T. Eschenhagen.

### Western blot analysis

For detection of recombinant RGS proteins, 3 × 10⁶ cardiomyocytes were harvested in 200 µl Murakami buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl₂, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA). PLD isozymes were detected in cardiomyocyte membranes. Proteins (50 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide in the resolving gel) and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Blots were washed with TBS (Tris 10 mM, NaCl 154 mM, pH 7.4), incubated overnight at 4°C with 3% skimmed milk in TTBS (TBS + 0.05% Tween 20), washed with TTBS, and incubated with an anti-RGS4-antiserum (1:2000, kind gift of Dr J. H. Kehrl), an His-probe (1:500, sc-803, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) (both for 3 h at room temperature), or for 1 h with anti-PLD1- (1:2000 dilution) or anti-PLD2- (1:500 dilution) specific peptide antibodies (kind gifts of Dr S. Bourgoin). PKC isoforms were detected by rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for PKCα, δ and ε (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used as secondary antibody (1:2000), and specific bands were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham, Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany).

### PKC translocation assay

For PKC translocation studies, cells were exposed to either 1 µM endothelin-1, 1 U/ml thrombin (30 s), media control (5 min) or 100 nM PMA control (5 min). Cells were then washed with PBS and harvested in 200 µl chilled Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA; 100 mM NaF, 2 µM leupeptin, 120 µM pepstatin A, 1 mM AEBSF-HCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% digitonin). After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing the cytosolic proteins was retained (cytosolic fraction). The pellet was resuspended by vortexing in 200 µl lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min (particulate fraction). Bradford protein assay was performed on each sample before storage in sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide in the resolving gel). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes and immunodetection was performed as described above. The densities of all Western blot bands and Coomassie stained membranes were analyzed using NIH Image version 1.59. Densities of the Western blot bands were normalized to the protein loading with reference to the Coomassie stained membranes.

### Assay of PLD activity

For measurement of PLD activity, cellular phospholipids in cardiomyocytes were labeled by adding 2.5 µCi/ml to the culture medium 20–24 h prior to the assay. To study the effects of PTX, *Clostridium difficile* toxin B (a kind gift of Dr C. von Eichel-Streiber), and genistein on PLD activity, these agents or their respective solvents were added during the labeling period. The amount of [³H]oleic acid incorporated into the phospholipids was used as a viability control and was not altered by the different treatments. Thereafter, the cells were washed once with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, 118 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl₂, 1 mM MgCl₂, 5 mM D-glucose, 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and then allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 37°C. To study the effects of PKC and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, brefeldin A, and HA-1077, these agents or their respective solvents were added to the cells during this equilibration period. The equilibration medium was replaced by fresh HBSS containing 2% ethanol and the indicated stimuli, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 37°C. Stoppage of the reaction and isolation of labeled phospholipids, including the PLD-specific product, [³H]phosphatidylethanol ([³H]PtdEtOH), were performed as described before.¹⁹ The formation of [³H]PtdEtOH is expressed as percent of total labeled phospholipids.

### Determination of PLC activity and PIP₂ levels in cardiomyocytes

Cellular phospholipids in NRCM were labeled by adding 2 µCi/ml myo-[³H]inositol (Amersham-Pharmacia) to the culture medium 20–24 h prior

to the assay. Cells were washed and equilibrated as described above with HBSS supplemented with 10 mM LiCl. Receptor antagonists were present during the equilibration and stimulation periods. Stoppage of reaction and analysis of \[^3H\]inositol phosphates (\[^3H\]IP\(_x\)) were performed as described before.\(^{19}\)

Alternatively, unlabeled cardiomyocytes were plated on 60 mm culture dishes and cultivated for 4 days. If indicated, the cells were treated for 20–24 h with and without PTX, toxin B, or genistein. Thereafter, the cells were washed once with HBSS and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at \(37^\circ\)C, followed by agonist addition and further incubation for the indicated periods of time (for PLC assays). The reaction was stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid (0.5 M). Formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP\(_3\)) was quantified by a radioreceptor assay as reported before.\(^{20}\) The phosphoinositides were extracted with acidified chloroform/methanol and hydrolyzed with 1 M KOH at \(100^\circ\)C for 15 min. PIP\(_2\) was quantified as IP\(_3\) resulting from PIP\(_2\) hydrolysis.

**Data presentation and statistics**

Data shown are means ± S.E.M. from the indicated number (\(n\)) of independent experiments, each performed in duplicate or triplicate. Concentration-response curves were analyzed using iterative nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPAD Prism). Statistical significance was estimated by Student’s \(t\)-test for unpaired observations, with or without Welch’s correction. A \(P\)-value of <0.05 was considered significant.

**Results**

**Role of PLC and PKC for cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by endothelin-1 and thrombin**

Studies in many different cell types demonstrated that GPCRs which activate PLC generally also stimulate PLD, and for some, but not all, of these GPCRs PLD stimulation has been found to be dependent on PLC-mediated PKC activation.\(^{1-5}\) Similar data have been reported for various GPCRs, particularly for the endothelin-1 ET\(_A\)R, endogenously expressed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, inducing both PLC stimulation and PKC-dependent PLD activation.\(^{10,11}\) As thrombin acting via PAR1 also potently stimulates PLC in cardiomyocytes,\(^{12,13}\) we

examined in the present study whether, and by which mechanisms, thrombin stimulates PLD in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, in comparison to endothelin-1.

As illustrated in Figure 1, endothelin-1 (0.1–1 μM) stimulated cardiomyocyte PLC and PLD activities maximally 4–5-fold. Stimulation of PLC and PLD by 0.1 μM endothelin-1 was significantly

Distinct Coupling of GPCRs to Cardiomyocyte PLD 445

thrombin-induced PLC stimulation was very transient, as reported before.¹²,¹³ Sixty s after stimulation with thrombin, IP₃ levels had returned to baseline, whereas elevated levels of IP₃ could be detected even 15 min after stimulation with endothelin-1. Pretreatment of the cells with PTX (100 ng/ml, 24 h) had no effect on IP₃ formation (extent or time course) by either agonist. Maximal PLD stimulation (about 4-fold) observed at 1 U/ml thrombin was similar to that induced by endothelin-1. As shown in Figure 2(C), neonatal cardiomyocytes express both PLD1 and PLD2 isozymes.

PKC isozymes are apparently involved in PLD stimulation by endothelin-1.¹⁰,¹¹ As shown in Figure 3(A,B), stimulation of neonatal cardiomyocytes with endothelin-1 (1 μM) induced a significant translocation of the PKC isoforms δ (2-fold) and ε (1.5-fold) but not PKCα from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction within 30 s after stimulation. In contrast to endothelin-1, thrombin (1 U/ml) did not induce a significant change in cellular distribution of PKCε. Translocation of PKCδ, however, was significantly induced (1.6-fold) [Fig. 3(C)]. The PKC-activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 nM, 5 min) induced very marked translocation of all three PKC isoforms under study [Fig. 3(D)].

As reported before,¹⁰ pretreatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with the broad range PKC inhibitor, Ro 31-8220 (bisindolylmaleimide IX, 5 μM), significantly reduced, by about 50%, PLD stimulation by endothelin-1 (1 μM). In contrast, PLD stimulation induced by thrombin (1 U/ml) was not affected [Fig. 4(A)]. On the other hand, the PKCα- and PKCβ-specific inhibitor, Gö 6976 (5 μM), neither altered endothelin-1- nor thrombin-induced PLD stimulation [Fig. 4(B)].

Distinct G proteins mediate cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by endothelin-1 and thrombin

As stimulation of cardiomyocyte PLD activity by thrombin was apparently PKC-independent, we first examined whether thrombin receptor coupling to cardiomyocyte PLD is mediated by PTX-sensitive Gi-type G proteins. However, as shown in Figure 5(A), treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with PTX (100 ng/ml, 24 h) did not alter [³H]PtdEtOH formation induced by thrombin (1 U/ml). Interestingly, in PTX-treated cardiomyocytes formation of [³H]PtdEtOH induced by endothelin-1 (1 μM) was even increased, by about 2-fold.

Thus, thrombin stimulation of PLD activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes is apparently mediated

Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated for 24 h without (Control, open bars) and with 100 ng/ml PTX (A) or infected with adenoviruses encoding bacterial galactosidase (LacZ, open bars) (B,C), Lsc-RGS (Lsc, closed bars) (B,C), RGS4 (grey bars) (B), or KIAA380-RGS at the indicated MOI (D), as described in “Experimental Procedures”. Thereafter, formation of \[^{3}H\]PtdEtOH was determined in the absence (Basal) and presence of 1 μM endothelin-1 (ET-1) or 1 U/ml thrombin (Thr). Shown are the mean ± S.E.M. of \( n = 9 \) (A) or \( n = 6 \) (B,C,D) experiments. **\*\*** \( P < 0.01 \) vs control. **\*** \( P < 0.05 \) vs LacZ.

not shown). In contrast, thrombin-induced PLD stimulation was significantly blunted, by 50–60%, in cardiomyocytes overexpressing Lsc-RGS [Fig. 5(B,C)]. Overexpression of Lsc-RGS reduced the maximal extent of thrombin-induced PLD stimulation, without altering the concentration response curve (data not shown). On the other hand, PLD stimulation induced by endothelin-1 was not affected by overexpression of Lsc-RGS [Fig. 5(C)], which also had no effect on agonist-induced PLC stimulation (data not shown). These data suggested that cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by thrombin, but not by endothelin-1, is mediated by G~12~-type G proteins. To corroborate this hypothesis, we expressed the RGS homology domain of KIAA380, a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor related to p115RhoGEF and its murine homolog Lsc. As shown in Figure 5(D), infection of cardiomyocytes with a recombinant adenovirus encoding KIAA380-RGS resulted in expression of the protein and a concomitant reduction in thrombin-induced PLD stimulation. Maximal reduction (~75%) was observed at a MOI of 40. As observed for cells expressing Lsc-RGS, endothelin-1-induced PLD stimulation was unaltered by expression of KIAA380-RGS (data not shown).

Thereafter, [³H]PtdEtOH formation was determined in the absence (Basal) and presence of 1 μM endothelin-1 (ET-1) or 1 U/ml thrombin (Thr). Data are the mean ± S.E.M. of n = 9 experiments. ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 v control.

Role of ARF and Rho GTPases for cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by endothelin-1 and thrombin

Monomeric GTPases of the ARF and Rho families have been reported to mediate PLD stimulation by various receptors in diverse cell types.¹⁻⁵ To study the role of these GTPases for cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation, we used brefeldin A, a cell-permeable inhibitor of ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and the Rho protein-inactivating Clostridium difficile toxin B, both of which have been used before to establish a contribution of ARF and Rho proteins, respectively, to GPCR-induced PLD stimulation, e.g., by the M₃ muscarinic receptor in HEK-293 cells.²¹,²² As shown in Figure 6(A), treatment of cardiomyocytes with brefeldin A (175 μM, 30 min) significantly reduced, by about 50%, PLD stimulation by thrombin (1 U/ml),

Figure 7 Influence of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors on cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by endothelin-1 and thrombin. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated for 30 min without (Control, open bars) and with 100 μM genistein (closed bars), 100 μM tyrphostin A23 (dark grey bars), or 10 μM PP2 (light grey bars). Thereafter, [³H]PtdEtOH formation was measured in the absence and presence of 1 μM endothelin-1 (ET-1) or 1 U/ml thrombin (Thr). Agonist-induced PLD activity is shown as the mean ± S.E.M. of n = 6–9 experiments. ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 v control.

whereas PLD stimulation induced by endothelin-1 (1 μM) was not affected. On the other hand, both thrombin- and endothelin-1-induced PLD stimulation was significantly reduced, by 45–50%, in cardiomyocytes pretreated with toxin B (50 pg/ml, 24 h) [Fig. 6(B)]. Many cellular effects of Rho proteins are mediated by Rho-activated Rho-kinase,²³ and Rho-kinase has been reported to be involved in PLD stimulation by the M₃ muscarinic receptor in HEK-293 cells.²⁴ However, in contrast to the findings in HEK-293 cells, treatment of cardiomyocytes with the Rho-kinase inhibitor, HA-1077 (up to 100 μM), did not alter endothelin-1- or thrombin-induced PLD stimulation (data not shown).

Role of tyrosine kinases for cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by endothelin-1 and thrombin

Studies with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggested that, in addition to PKC and monomeric GTPases, tyrosine kinases are involved in GPCR-induced PLD stimulation in diverse cell types.¹⁻⁵ As shown in Figure 7, stimulation of cardiomyocyte PLD is apparently also dependent on tyrosine kinases. Treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with the broad range tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, strongly reduced PLD stimulation by either endothelin-1 (1 μM) or thrombin (1 U/ml), by 60–65% at a concentration of 100 μM. Tyrphostin A23 (100 μM), another non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, similarly reduced agonist-induced PLD stimulation, but was somewhat less

**Regulation of phorbol ester-induced cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation**

As observed in most other cell types,\(^{1-5}\) treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with the PKC-activating phorbol ester PMA (100 nM) caused a very strong PLD stimulation, by about 50-fold (Fig. 8). This stimulation was largely suppressed by the PKC inhibitor, Ro 31-8220 (5 μM). While brefeldin A (175 μM) had no effect, treatment of cardiomyocytes with toxin B (50 pg/ml) reduced the PMA-induced PLD stimulation nearly as efficiently as Ro 31-8220. Interestingly, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (100 μM), also reduced the PMA-induced PLD stimulation. The extent of this inhibition was dependent on the time of pretreatment with genistein, amounting to about 20% and 75% inhibition after 0.5 h and 24 h of treatment, respectively.

**Reduction of cardiomyocyte PIP₂ levels by toxin B and genistein**

The inhibition of PLD stimulation by toxin B and genistein irrespective of the stimulus used suggested that Rho proteins and tyrosine kinases may control the cellular level of a common regulator of PLD activity. Therefore, we quantified the level of PIP₂ known to be involved in stimulation of both PLD1 and PLD2 isozymes.\(^{1-8}\) As shown in Figure 9, treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes for 24 h with toxin B (50 pg/ml) or genistein (100 μM) caused a significant reduction in the total cellular PIP₂ content, by about 33% and 65%, respectively. The extent of the reduction in PIP₂ content correlated with the extent of inhibition of agonist-induced PLD stimulation induced by toxin B and genistein [about 45% and 65%, see Fig. 4(B) and Fig. 5, respectively].

**Discussion**

Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes express various GPCRs mediating agonist-induced PLC stimulation and hypertrophic responses. As observed with other PLC-activating GPCRs in other cell types,\(^{1-5}\) several of the cardiomyocyte PLC-activating GPCRs have also

stimulation suggest that the activation of cardiomyocyte PLD by PKC is phosphorylation-dependent. A likely candidate substrate is PLD1, which has recently been shown to be activated by PKC-induced phosphorylation.³⁰

In contrast to endothelin-1-stimulated PLD, thrombin-induced PLD stimulation was not inhibited by Ro 31-8220. Taking further into account that thrombin did not induce an activation of PKCε and only a weak translocation of PKCδ, our data suggest that thrombin does not cause stimulation of PLD via a PKC-dependent mechanism.

The second major difference between PAR1- and ETAR-induced PLD stimulation is apparently the type of heterotrimeric G proteins mediating this response. Thrombin-induced PLD stimulation was not affected by PTX, which had also no effect on thrombin-induced IP₃ formation,¹² or by overexpression of RGS4, a negative regulator Gi- and Gq-type G proteins.³¹ These data support the notion that cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by thrombin is not dependent on PLC and PKC activation and specifically argue against a role for Gi- and Gq-type G proteins in PAR1-PLD coupling. Using a similar approach as recently reported for characterization of the type of G proteins involved in PLD stimulation by the M₃ muscarinic receptor expressed in HEK-293 cells,¹⁶ i.e. expression of RGS proteins which selectively suppress G₁₂-type G proteins, evidence is provided suggesting that PAR1-PLD coupling is primarily mediated by G₁₂-type G proteins. Specifically, expression of Lsc-RGS and KIAA380-RGS, which selectively inactivate G₁₂-type G proteins,¹⁶,¹⁷ strongly reduced thrombin-induced PLD stimulation, but was without effect on PLD stimulation induced by endothelin-1. Thus, PKC-independent and G₁₂-type G protein-mediated GPCR-PLD coupling is not restricted to the rather artificial situation of the M₃ muscarinic receptor expressed in HEK-293 cells,¹⁶ but is also observed for a GPCR, i.e. PAR1, endogenously expressed in cardiomyocytes.

Interestingly, PTX treatment of cardiomyocytes, which had no effect on thrombin-induced PLD stimulation, strongly increased, by about 2-fold, PLD stimulation induced by endothelin-1, whereas PLC stimulation was not altered. Presently, we can only speculate on the mechanism underlying this observation. It is well known that the ETAR can activate PTX-sensitive G proteins, leading to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in the heart and contributing to the ETAR-induced hypertrophic response in cultured cardiomyocytes.³²,³³ As α₂-adrenoceptors overexpressed in PC12 cells have been reported to induce PTX-sensitive PLD inhibition,³⁴ it may be speculated that the ETAR activates in

cardiomyocytes, in addition to the PKC-dependent PLD stimulation, a $G_{i}$-mediated inhibitory pathway, the nature of which remains to be characterized. PTX treatment would block this inhibition, leading to full, unrestricted PLD stimulation by the ET$_{A}$R.

Finally, PAR1 and ET$_{A}$R coupling to cardiomyocyte PLD apparently differs with regard to involvement of ARF GTPases. Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, has been used in several cellular systems to inhibit ARF activation and ARF-dependent PLD stimulation. ${}^{1-5}$ Treatment of cardiomyocytes with this agent strongly reduced PLD stimulation induced by thrombin, but not by endothelin-1, suggesting that PAR1-induced and $G_{12}$-mediated but PKC-independent stimulation of cardiomyocyte PLD involves ARF GTPases. Recently, it was reported that PLD2 in rat cardiomyocytes is inhibited by $\alpha$-actinin and that this inhibition is reversed by ARF. ${}^{9}$ Thus, it may be speculated that PAR1-mediated stimulation of PLD activity in cardiomyocytes is caused by ARF-dependent activation of the PLD2 isozyme, although involvement of the directly ARF-activated PLD1 isozyme is also not unlikely.

There were, however, also obvious similarities in cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation by endothelin-1 and thrombin. Treatment of the cells with the Rho protein-inactivating toxin B and the general tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin A23, largely reduced PLD stimulation induced by either endothelin-1 or thrombin and even that induced by the phorbol ester PMA. These data suggested that toxin B and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors may affect the level or activity of a common PLD regulatory factor. As PIP$_{2}$ is required for PLD1 and PLD2 activities, ${}^{6-8}$ and synthesis of PIP$_{2}$ is controlled by Rho GTPases and tyrosine kinases, ${}^{20,35}$ the level of PIP$_{2}$ was quantified in cardiomyocytes treated with toxin B and genistein. Toxin B and genistein markedly reduced the cellular PIP$_{2}$ level. Moreover, there was a correlation between the extent of cellular PIP$_{2}$ reduction and the extent of inhibition of receptor-induced PLD stimulation, with genistein reducing PIP$_{2}$ level and PLD stimulation more efficiently than toxin B.

In summary, the data reported herein provide evidence for two distinct pathways mediating GPCR-induced PLD stimulation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. One pathway appears to be used by the endothelin-1 receptor ET$_{A}$R, leading via $G_{q}$-type G proteins to stimulation of a PLC$\beta$ isozyme and subsequent activation of PKC$\delta$ and PKC$\varepsilon$, then finally resulting in PLD activation. The other pathway, apparently used by the thrombin receptor PAR1, is proposed to mediate PLD stimulation via

activation of $G_{12}$-type G proteins and activation of ARF GTPases. Rho proteins, which can be activated by $G_{q}$-type and $G_{12}$-type depending pathways, ${}^{36,37}$ control the cellular PIP$_{2}$ level, together with non-Src tyrosine kinases, and thereby contribute to PLD regulation irrespective of the receptor stimulus. It remains to be determined which of the PLD isozymes, PLD1 and PLD2, is activated by the two pathways.
