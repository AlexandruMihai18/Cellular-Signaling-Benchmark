AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic fuel gauge conserved along the evolutionary scale in eukaryotes that senses changes in the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio¹. Recent evidence indicated an important role for AMPK in the therapeutic benefits of metformin²³, thiazolidinediones⁴ and exercise⁵, which form the cornerstones of the clinical management of type 2 diabetes and associated metabolic disorders. In general, activation of AMPK acts to maintain cellular energy stores, switching on catabolic pathways that produce ATP, mostly by enhancing oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, while switching off anabolic pathways that consume ATP¹. This regulation can take place acutely, through the regulation of fast post-translational events, but also by transcriptionally reprogramming the cell to meet energetic needs. Here we demonstrate that AMPK controls the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism in mouse skeletal muscle by acting in coordination with another metabolic sensor, the NAD⁺-dependent type III deacetylase SIRT1. AMPK enhances SIRT1 activity by increasing cellular NAD⁺ levels, resulting in the deacetylation and modulation of the activity of downstream SIRT1 targets that include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α and the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and O3 (FOXO3a) transcription factors. The AMPK-induced SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of these targets explains many of the convergent biological effects of AMPK and SIRT1 on energy metabolism.

AMPK is a critical regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to energy deprivation⁶. Although the mechanisms by which AMPK modulates mitochondrial gene expression are not entirely elucidated, they seem to require the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), either by increasing its expression⁷ or direct phosphorylation⁸. Because PGC-1α is also activated by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation⁹⁻¹², we speculated that AMPK alters PGC-1α activity by changing its acetylation status. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-riboside (AICAR) decreased PGC-1α acetylation after 4 h of treatment (Fig. 1a). Unrelated AMPK activators (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b), such as resveratrol¹³,¹⁴, metformin³, dinitrophenol (DNP)¹⁵ and A-769662¹⁶, also decreased PGC-1α acetylation (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Furthermore, overexpression of a constitutively active form of AMPKα₁ led to a robust deacetylation of PGC-1α that could not be further enhanced by AICAR (Fig. 1c). In contrast, when a dominant negative form of AMPKα₁ was overexpressed, AICAR was unable to deacetylate PGC-1α (Fig. 1c). The activation of AMPK hence triggers PGC-1α deacetylation in C2C12 myotubes.

To validate these observations *in vivo*, we examined PGC-1α acetylation in hindlimb muscles after a single AICAR injection. PGC-1α acetylation was markedly reduced by AICAR in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and gastrocnemius, but not in soleus (Fig. 1d). The soleus is an oxidative muscle, where basal PGC-1α activity is presumably higher than in glycolytic muscles such as the EDL. Supporting this hypothesis, basal PGC-1α acetylation levels were lower in soleus than EDL (Supplementary Fig. 2a), explaining why the soleus is refractory to AICAR. AICAR-induced PGC-1α deacetylation in muscle correlated with an increase of PGC-1α target genes (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Consistent with PGC-1α acetylation levels, AICAR had, however, minor effects on mitochondrial gene expression in the soleus (Supplementary Fig. 2c).

We then tested whether AMPK activation through exercise decreases PGC-1α acetylation. An exhaustive single bout of treadmill running transiently activated AMPK (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and induced PGC-1α deacetylation with a maximal effect 3 h after ending exercise (Fig. 1e). As observed with AICAR infusion, the soleus was refractory to exercise-induced PGC-1α deacetylation (Fig. 1e) despite being effectively recruited, as indicated by the diminished glycogen levels and increased AMPK activity (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). The decrease in PGC-1α acetylation in EDL and gastrocnemius, but not in soleus, translated to a marked induction of PGC-1α target genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b (*Cpt1b*), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (*Pdk4*) or *Glut4* (also called *Slc2a4*; Supplementary Fig. 3d), whereas these genes only minimally responded in soleus (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Together, these results physiologically correlate AMPK activation, PGC-1α deacetylation and PGC-1α activity.

Because SIRT1 interacts with and deacetylates PGC-1α⁹,¹¹, we next evaluated whether SIRT1 mediates the AICAR-induced deacetylation of PGC-1α. Pre-treatment of C2C12 myotubes with nicotinamide (NAM), a type III histone deacetylase inhibitor¹⁷, blocked AICAR-induced PGC-1α deacetylation (Supplementary Fig. 4). Furthermore, AICAR failed to decrease PGC-1α acetylation when SIRT1 expression was knocked down with a short hairpin RNA⁹ (shRNA; Fig. 2a) or genetically ablated, as in *Sirt1⁻/⁻* mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)¹⁸ (Fig. 2b). The lack of SIRT1 did not affect AICAR-induced AMPK phosphorylation in any of these models (Fig. 2c, d). The protein levels of SIRT2 and SIRT3, the closest homologues of SIRT1, were not affected by reduced SIRT1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 5), ruling out their implication in the blunted response to AICAR.

We next explored whether PGC-1α deacetylation influences AMPK-induced PGC-1α transcriptional activity. Because PGC-1α positively autoregulates its own promoter¹⁹, we monitored PGC-1α activity by transiently transfecting a luciferase reporter under the control of the *Pgc1-α* (also called *Ppargc1a*) promoter, in the absence/presence of PGC-1α and a *Sirt1* shRNA. AICAR robustly increased PGC-1α action on its own promoter in both C2C12 myocytes (Fig. 3a) and *Sirt1*⁺/⁺ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 3b). This increase was

Then, NAD⁺ and NADH (h) or PGC-1α acetylation levels (i) were measured. j, k, As in h, i, but using FK866 (10 nM) instead of etomoxir. All values are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. Asterisks indicate statistical difference versus vehicle/saline group at \(P < 0.05\). Hash symbols indicate statistical difference versus respective control shRNA group at \(P < 0.05\).

SIRT1 also had a major role in the ability of AMPK to increase mitochondrial respiration, as the long-term effects of AICAR on cellular O₂ consumption, a readout of oxidative metabolism, were severely blunted by knocking down SIRT1 (Fig. 3e). Thus, we determined the contribution of lipid oxidation to total O₂ consumption by blocking mitochondrial fatty acid uptake with etomoxir. Confirming previous observations¹⁰, knocking down SIRT1 severely decreased lipid oxidation and increased the oxidation of alternative substrates (Fig. 3e). In control cells, AICAR markedly increased lipid oxidation-driven O₂ consumption, whereas it almost completely blocked the oxidation of other substrates, such as glucose. When SIRT1 expression was knocked down, AICAR action on lipid oxidation was blunted and, additionally, AICAR was unable to decrease O₂ consumption derived from the other substrates (Fig. 3e). In line with this, direct measurement of oleate oxidation confirmed that the chronic effects of AICAR on lipid oxidation were blunted in myotubes where SIRT1 expression was knocked down (Supplementary Fig. 11). The lack of SIRT1 hence alters the long-term actions of AICAR on lipid oxidation and global cellular O₂ consumption.

As AICAR or metformin cannot directly activate SIRT1 (Supplementary Fig. 12), our data suggest that AMPK signalling modulates SIRT1 activity indirectly. No changes in SIRT1 protein levels were detected after 8 h of AICAR (Supplementary Fig. 13a),

To determine how AMPK acutely increases the NAD⁺/NADH ratio, we pharmacologically targeted different possible sources of cellular NAD⁺ production. Inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase with oxamic acid did not affect the ability of AICAR to increase NAD⁺ levels and the NAD⁺/NADH ratio (Supplementary Fig. 15a). In contrast, inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation with etomoxir was enough to hamper the increase in NAD⁺/NADH induced by AMPK (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 15b), indicating that an increase in mitochondrial β-oxidation is required for AMPK to increase the NAD⁺/NADH ratio. Supporting the role of NAD⁺/NADH ratio on SIRT1 activity, etomoxir also abolished AMPK-induced PGC-1α deacetylation (Fig. 3i).

SIRT1 activity is inhibited by NAM, a product of the deacetylation reaction catalysed by the sirtuins¹⁷. NAM can be cleared and enzymatically reconverted into NAD⁺ through the NAD⁺ salvage pathway, the initial rate-limiting step of which is catalysed in mammals by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)²³. Acute blockage of NAMPT activity with the specific inhibitor FK866²⁴, however, did not affect AICAR’s capacity to modulate PGC-1α acetylation or NAD⁺/NADH ratio up to 8 h after treatment (Fig. 3j, k and Supplementary Fig. 15c). These results apparently conflict with observations indicating that NAMPT can link AMPK and SIRT1 activities²⁵. These differences may be explained by the fact that a chronic knock down of NAMPT may constitutively inhibit SIRT1 due to reduced intracellular NAM clearance¹⁷. Supporting this speculation, knock down of NAMPT for 48 h promotes PGC-1α hyperacetylation (Supplementary Fig. 16). The use of FK866 dissociates the direct effects of acute NAMPT inhibition from those of indirect SIRT1 inhibition and indicates that AMPK initially regulates the NAD⁺/NADH ratio and SIRT1 activity independently of NAMPT. These results, however, do not rule out that NAMPT could participate to sustain the actions of AMPK on SIRT1.

Whereas it has been reported that AMPK activates PGC-1α through direct phosphorylation⁸, our data show that deacetylation of PGC-1α on AMPK activation is also required to activate PGC-1α.

To understand how both post-translational modifications intertwine, we used the PGC-1α 2A mutant lacking the two AMPK phosphorylation sites⁸. Mutation of these sites markedly reduced deacetylation of PGC-1α by AICAR (Fig. 4a), and, consistently, blunted AICAR action on the expression of mitochondrial genes (Fig. 4b). The expression of the PGC-1α 2A mutant, however, did not alter AICAR action on the NAD⁺/NADH ratio, which increased to a similar extent as in myocytes expressing wild-type PGC-1α (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 17). This suggested that the activation of SIRT1 by AMPK should theoretically be unaffected by the PGC-1α 2A mutant and, consequently, still have an impact on other SIRT1 substrates beyond PGC-1α, like the FOXO transcription factors²⁶. AICAR treatment triggered the deacetylation of endogenous FOXO1 (Fig. 4d), as well as other members of the FOXO family, such as FOXO3a (Supplementary Fig. 18), in C2C12 myotubes. The deacetylation of FOXO1 in response to AICAR was similar in myocytes expressing wild-type PGC-1α or the 2A mutant (Fig. 4e), demonstrating that the PGC-1α 2A mutation only alters PGC-1α deacetylation but not general SIRT1 activation in response to AICAR. Hence, the data suggest a scenario where phosphorylation of PGC-1α constitutes a priming signal for subsequent deacetylation by SIRT1 (Fig. 4f). Notably, AMPK can also phosphorylate the FOXO transcription factors²⁷, which are also targets for SIRT1 deacetylation²⁶. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the coordinated sequential actions of AMPK and SIRT1 could be a conserved mechanism for AMPK to modulate the specificity among SIRT1 targets, with phosphorylation discriminating which substrates should be deacetylated and preventing random deacetylation.

This work demonstrates that deacetylation of PGC-1α is a key mechanism by which AMPK triggers PGC-1α activity in cultured myotubes and in skeletal muscle. We also unveil SIRT1 as a key, albeit not the sole, mediator of AMPK action on PGC-1α transcriptional activity, the expression of mitochondrial and lipid metabolism genes, and O₂ consumption (Fig. 3). The acute actions of AMPK on lipid oxidation alter the balance between cellular NAD⁺ and NADH,

against FOXO1. **f**, Scheme illustrating the convergent actions of AMPK and SIRT1 on PGC-1α. Pharmacological (metformin) and physiological (fasting or exercise) activation of AMPK in muscle triggers an increase in the NAD⁺/NADH ratio, which activates SIRT1. AMPK also induces the phosphorylation of PGC-1α and primes it for subsequent deacetylation by SIRT1. The impact of AMPK and SIRT1 on the acetylation status of PGC-1α and other transcriptional regulators, such as the FOXO family of transcription factors, will then modulate mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism. All values are presented as mean ± standard error. Asterisks indicate statistical difference versus corresponding vehicle group at \(P < 0.05\).which acts as a messenger to activate SIRT1. This study constitutes a step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms by which AMPK transcriptionally regulates energy expenditure. The implication of SIRT1 in the transcriptional actions of AMPK provides a possible explanation for the overlapping metabolic effects of SIRT1 and AMPK activators ${ }^{7,12,16,28,29}$. Furthermore, the interplay between SIRT1 and AMPK might be reciprocal, as specific SIRT1 agonists promote fatty acid oxidation and indirectly activate AMPK through metabolic adaptations ${ }^{29}$. Hence, the interdependent regulation of SIRT1 and AMPK provides a finely tuned amplification mechanism for energy homeostasis under low nutrient availability. Together, these findings constitute a conciliatory view of the possible implications of AMPK and SIRT1 on the pleiotropic beneficial effects of calorie restriction on metabolic homeostasis and lifespan, where both enzymes were known to participate, but never linked.

### METHODS SUMMARY

The origin of all chemicals, antibodies, plasmids and adenoviruses is listed in Methods.

#### Cell culture.
C2C12 skeletal muscle cells were grown and differentiated as described ${ }^{12}$. C2C12 cells were considered as myotubes after 96 h of differentiation. Differentiation medium was supplemented with $0.1 \mathrm{mM}$ oleic acid. Unless otherwise stated, AICAR treatments lasted 8 h. Additional cell culture procedures can be found in Methods.

# METHODS

## Exercise protocol.
8-week-old non-fasted C57BL6/J male mice were subjected to a resistance running test, using a variable speed belt treadmill enclosed in a plexiglass chamber with a stimulus device consisting of a shock grid attached to the rear of the belt (Panlab). Animals were acclimatized to the chamber the day preceding the running test. For the habituation, mice run at 21 cm s⁻¹ for 10 min with a 5° incline. For the actual test, we used a protocol at 5° incline where, beginning at 18 cm s⁻¹, speed increased gradually by 3 cm s⁻¹ every 5 min. The distance run and the number of shocks were monitored during the test, and exhaustion was assumed when mice received more than 50 shocks in a 2.5 min interval. Mice were removed from the treadmill on exhaustion.

Preceding the running test, we randomly subdivided mice into three different groups (8 mice per group): one group that would be killed immediately after the exercise test, another which would be killed 3 h after the exercise test, and, finally, a group that would be killed 6 h after the cessation of exercise. The time and distance run before exhaustion was similar in the three groups (data not shown), around 600 m after 40 min of exercise. Mice killed 3 and 6 h after exercise had free access to food and water once the running protocol was finished.

## Reagents and materials.
AICAR was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals. Anti-PGC-1α (H300) and anti-actin goat antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-PGC-1α, anti-acetyl-lysine, anti-AMPKα, anti-phospho-AMPKα (Thr 172) and anti-FOXO1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-Sir2 and anti-phospho AcetylCoA carboxylase (ACC) (Ser79) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-NAMPT antibody was purchased from Bethyl laboratories. Anti-Flag (M2) and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies as well as most commonly used chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Nampt siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. The A-769662 compound was a gift from G. Hardie. C. Ammann provided the FK866 compound.

## Plasmids and adenoviral vectors.
Adenoviruses encoding for GFP, Flag–HA–PGC-1α, Flag–R13-PGC-1α, control and Sirt1 shRNAs were described previously⁹. Adenoviruses encoding for the different forms of AMPKα₁ subunit were a gift from P. Ferré and F. Foufelle³⁰. The plasmids encoding for the mouse Pdk4 gene promoter²⁰, mouse Mcad gene promoter²¹, and the 2A-PGC-1α mutant⁸ have all been described. The plasmid encoding for Flag-tagged FOXO3a was purchased from Addgene.

## Cell culture, adenoviral infection and treatments.
C2C12 skeletal muscle cells were grown and differentiated as described¹². Unless otherwise stated, C2C12 were considered as myotubes after 96 h of differentiation. Differentiation medium was supplemented with 0.1 mM oleic acid. Adenoviral infections of C2C12 myocytes were performed after 48 h of differentiation. Cells were washed with PBS and left for 1 h in serum-free DMEM 4.5 g l⁻¹ glucose containing the appropriate amount of viral particles (MOI = 100 per each virus used, using GFP as control to make even the final viral amount). Then, the media was replaced with fresh differentiation media for an additional 47 h before any treatment took place. MEFs were cultured in DMEM 4.5 g l⁻¹ glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Adenoviral infection of MEFs was performed when cells reached 70% of confluency, and processed as with C2C12 myocytes but using 10% FCS DMEM medium instead of differentiation medium at the end. DMSO was used as vehicle for the different treatments. Plasmids and siRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. *Sirt1*⁺/⁺ and *Sirt1*⁻/⁻ cells were a gift of F. Alt.

## Total protein extraction.
To obtain total protein extracts from cellular samples, cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold PBS before adding cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris HCl pH = 7.9, 5 mM MgCl₂, 10% glycerol, 100 mM KCl; 1% NP40; 0.3 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, containing freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem)). For acetylation studies, 5 mM nicotinamide and 1 mM sodium butyrate were added to the buffer. After 1 min, cells were scraped, transferred into an Eppendorf tube and left on ice for 5 more minutes. Then cells were homogenized with a 25-gauge needle, left for 5 more minutes on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and kept at –80 °C.

## Nuclear extracts.
Nuclear extracts from gastrocnemius muscles were obtained as described previously¹².

## Immunoprecipitation and western blot.
 Routinely, 500 μg of protein from cultured cells or 2 mg of protein from muscle samples (total lysates or nuclear extracts) were used for immunoprecipitation. Forty microlitres of protein G-sepharose re-suspended in lysis buffer were used for pre-clearing the sample and immunoprecipitation after conjugating the beads with 3–5 mg of antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitate was boiled with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) and used for Western blot applications. For immunoprecipitation using rabbit polyclonal antibodies, protein-A-sepharose beads were used instead

of Protein-G-conjugated beads. Western blot and protein detection was performed as described previously¹².

## Gene expression analysis.
RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA was generated using Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) and quantitative real-time PCR was performed as described previously¹² using acidic ribosomal protein (ARP) to normalize the expression. The oligonucleotides primers used for PCR analysis are provided at the end of the section.

## Oxygen consumption.
C2C12 myotubes or MEF cells were incubated for 5 h per day with AICAR during 2 days, in the presence of 0.1 mM oleic acid. Then oxygen consumption was measured using Seahorse Biotechnology XF24 equipment (Seahorse Bioscience Inc.) as described³¹.

## Oleate oxidation.
The estimation of oleate oxidation rates was performed as described previously³².

## Reporter gene assays.
C2C12 myocytes were transfected in 48-well plates at 90% of confluence with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were left for 5 h with the DNA-Lipofectamine mix, and the corresponding adenoviruses were added (each adenovirus at MOI 100) for the last hour of transfection. Then, the medium was removed and replaced by differentiation medium supplemented with 0.1 mM oleic acid for 36 h before treatment with AICAR or vehicle for 12 h. For MEFs, the protocol was similar, but replacing the transfection medium by DMEM 4.5 g l⁻¹ glucose 10% FCS supplemented with 0.1 mM oleic acid. Firefly luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-gal activity (always transfected simultaneously). Empty pGL3basic reporter gene vector and pCDNA.3.1 vector were used as control vectors. pGL3-PGC-1α 2-kb promoter was purchased from Addgene. The pcDNA.3.1 HA–PGC-1α plasmid was generated in P.P.’s laboratory. pcDNA–Flag–SIRT1 plasmid was developed in our own laboratory. Reporter constructs for *Pdk4* and *Mcad* promoters were produced by D. P. Kelly’s laboratory.

## Measurement of SIRT1 activity.
Experiments testing the direct effects of AICAR and metformin on SIRT1 activity were performed as described²⁸.

## NAD⁺/NADH measurements.
NAD⁺ and NADH nucleotides were directly measured as described before³³. In brief, whole tibialis anterior muscles or two 10-cm dishes of C2C12 myotubes were homogenized in 200 μl of acid extraction buffer to measure the NAD⁺ concentration, or 200 μl of alkali extraction to obtain NADH concentration. Then, homogenates were neutralized and the concentration of nucleotides was measured fluorimetrically after an enzymatic cycling reaction using 5 μl of sample. Values for both nucleotides were detected within the linear range. NAD⁺/NADH ratios were calculated by comparing the ratios obtained from each animal (randomly, one tibialis was used for NAD⁺ measurements and the other for NADH) or from parallel cell dishes in each experiment. The ratios obtained from different animals or individual cell culture experiment ratios were then used as individual values to calculate the mean and standard error.

## Glycogen measurement.
Muscle pieces (15–20 mg) were hydrolysed in 250 μl of 2 M HCl at 95 °C for 2 h. The solution was then neutralized with 250 μl 2 M NaOH, and the resulting free glycosyl units were assayed spectrophotometrically using a hexokinase-dependant assay kit (Amresco).

## Protein kinase assays.
For protein kinase assays on full-length SIRT1 and NAMPT, Flag-tagged proteins were produced using a coupled in vitro transcription and translation system (TNT, Promega Corporation). Active AMPK and SAMS peptide, as positive control substrate for AMPK, were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. AMPK was mixed with either Flag–SIRT1, Flag–NAMPT, control vector or SAMS peptide (200 mM) in a solution containing 30 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.65 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% Brij-35, 10 mM MgAc and 0.2 mM AMP. The reaction started by the addition of 0.1 mM ATP (containing [γ³²P]ATP at 1,000 c.p.m. pmol⁻¹), and was stopped after 20 min by adding 5 μl of 3% phosphoric acid, and 15 μl of the reaction mix were transferred to a piece of P81 phosphocellulose Whatman paper and washed extensively with phosphoric acid solution. Then, the paper was dried with acetone and radioactivity was counted by Cherenkov counting. The rest of the reaction mix was diluted in LSB and boiled for 5 min. Western blots were performed to ensure the correct presence of the proteins in the mix (data not shown). For kinase assays on different GST–SIRT1 fragments and GST–PGC-1α 1–400 (as positive control), proteins were expressed in bacteria (BL21 strain; Invitrogen) and purified by using glutathione–Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, 17-0756-01). In vitro kinase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer’s specifications (Millipore, 14-305). Briefly, recombinant protein was incubated with 32 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.01% Brij-35, 18.75 mM MgCl₂, 0.15 mM AMP, 0.125 mM ATP, 2.5 mCi [γ³²P]ATP and 0.65 mM dithiothreitol in the presence or absence of 200 ng activated AMPK for 30 min at 30 °C. The glutathione beads were then washed twice and eluted protein was analysed by SDS–PAGE and radiolabelled phosphate incorporation was assessed by autoradiography. Protein levels were determined by Coomassie blue staining.
