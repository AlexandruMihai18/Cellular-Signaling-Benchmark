Protein tyrosine phosphatase μ (PTPμ) is an adhesion molecule in the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed in the developing nervous system. We have shown that PTPμ can promote neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cells and it regulates neurite outgrowth mediated by N-cadherin (S. M. Burden-Gulley and S. M. Brady-Kalnay, 1999, *J. Cell Biol.* 144, 1323–1336). We previously demonstrated that PTPμ binds to the scaffolding protein RACK1 in yeast and mammalian cells (T. Mourton *et al.*, 2001, *J. Biol. Chem.* 276, 14896–14901). RACK1 is a receptor for activated protein kinase C (PKC). In this article, we demonstrate that PKC is involved in PTPμ-dependent signaling. PTPμ, RACK1, and PKCδ exist in a complex in cultured retinal cells and retinal tissue. Using pharmacologic inhibition of PKC, we demonstrate that PKCδ is required for neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cells on a PTPμ substrate. These results suggest that PTPμ signaling via RACK1 requires PKCδ activity to promote neurite outgrowth.

been well defined. A subgroup of CAMs consists of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) that transduce signals via changes in tyrosine phosphorylation.

The balance of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities control the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins within a cell (reviewed in Hunter, 1998). Tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in the growth and guidance of axons in the nervous system (reviewed in Desai *et al.*, 1997; Bixby, 2000; Stoker, 2001). For example, the Eph PTKs and their ephrin ligands are axon guidance molecules that play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal patterning of the visual system (reviewed in Nakamoto, 2000). RPTPs of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily have also been implicated in axonal growth and guidance (reviewed in Brady-Kalnay, 2001). These CAM-like RPTPs are unique due to their dual functions as cell–cell adhesion molecules and tyrosine phosphatases (Brady-Kalnay, 2001), suggesting that they signal in response to adhesion. We recently demonstrated that the RPTP PTPμ promotes neurite outgrowth in an *in vitro* assay (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). A related RPTP, PTPκ, was also shown to promote neurite outgrowth from cerebellar neurons (Drosopoulos *et al.*, 1999). PTPδ, a member of the LAR subfamily of PTPs, promotes neurite outgrowth from forebrain and some cerebellar neurons (Wang and Bixby, 1999). In addition, a gradient of PTPδ can act as a chemoattractant for embryonic forebrain neurons, which suggests that this phosphatase may be a guidance molecule (Sun *et al.*, 2000). Another LAR-like PTP, CRYPα, has been shown to regulate the interactions between neurons and glia in the retina and to regulate retinal axon outgrowth (Haj *et*

## INTRODUCTION

Spatiotemporal patterning of the central nervous system is complex: trillions of neurons need to find their sometimes distant targets. Through an intricate combination of short- and long-range interactions, some attractive and some repulsive, an axon can find its way to its target tissue. The growing tip of the axon, called the growth cone, migrates along the surface of other neurons, on glial cells and on extracellular matrix. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediate the cell–cell interactions required for migration and axonal guidance (reviewed in Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996). Yet, the signaling cascades that convert these extracellular adhesive events into intracellular responses have not

al., 1999; Ledig et al., 1999a). Homophilic binding of the leech homolog of LAR (HmLAR2) may function in neuronal outgrowth as well as growth cone collapse and mutual repulsion (Gershon et al., 1998; Baker and Macagno, 2000). In addition, CAM-like Drosophila RPTPs are required for proper neuronal guidance during development of the fly nervous system (Desai et al., 1996; Krueger et al., 1996; Desai et al., 1997). The regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by RPTPs may control attraction or repulsion of growth cones. This “steering” of growth cones promotes extension along the appropriate pathways during development.

The neurite outgrowth assay provides a model for contact-dependent growth and guidance, which is thought to be mediated by a series of adhesive events between the growth cone and molecules expressed on other cells or in matrices which form the “substrate” for migration. Neurite outgrowth is a frequently used assay of adhesion molecule function because it not only requires adhesion but also signaling to the cytoskeleton in order for a CAM to promote neurite outgrowth (reviewed in Suter and Forscher, 2000). Only a limited number of CAMs are able to promote neurite outgrowth. PTPμ promotes neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cells, which is blocked by anti-PTPμ antibodies (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). PTPμ is expressed at high levels in the retina and tectum during the developmental period in which RGC axons are growing to and forming connections with their CNS target (Ledig et al., 1999b; Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). Thus, studying neurite outgrowth from retina during this developmental period is an appropriate functional assay for PTPμ.

The focus of this manuscript is PTPμ which is widely expressed in the developing nervous system and developmentally regulated in the visual system (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999; Ledig et al., 1999b). It is a member of the Ig superfamily of adhesion molecules. The extracellular segment of PTPμ contains a MAM domain, followed by an Ig domain and four fibronectin type III repeats (Gebbink et al., 1991). The extracellular portion of the protein is responsible for its adhesive properties and PTPμ is known to bind homophilically via its Ig domain (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks, 1994). The MAM domain has also been shown to play a role in cell–cell aggregation (Zondag et al., 1995). The intracellular segment of PTPμ consists of a juxtamembrane region followed by two phosphatase domains (Gebbink et al., 1991).

The juxtamembrane domain of PTPμ has 20% homology with the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins (Tonks et al., 1992). The cadherins are calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules. The intracellular domain of cadherins binds to the catenins which in turn link this protein complex to the actin cytoskeleton (Gumbiner, 1995; Aberle et al., 1996). We have previously shown that PTPμ associates with the cadherin-catenin complex (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1995, 1998; Hiscox and Jiang, 1998) and that PTPμ is required for N-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). In addition, PTPμ also promotes neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cells (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999).

The precise signal transduction pathway utilized by PTPμ to promote neurite outgrowth was not known. We previously performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify interacting proteins and found that RACK1 binds to the membrane proximal phosphatase domain of PTPμ (Mourton et al., 2001). RACK1 is a scaffolding protein that was originally identified as a receptor for activated C kinase (Ron et al., 1994). RACK1 is a member of the Gβ family of proteins distinguished by seven propeller-like protein-binding domains called WD40 repeats (Garcia-Higuera et al., 1996). This cytoplasmic scaffolding protein binds the signaling molecules protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase-Cγ, the src tyrosine kinase, and cAMP phosphodiesterase-4 as well as the β subunit of integrin receptors and the β chain of the interleukin-5 receptor (Disatnik et al., 1994; Chang et al., 1998; Yarwood et al., 1999; Liliental and Chang, 1998; Geijesen et al., 1999). RACK1 has also been shown to bind to the pleckstrin homology domains of dynamin, β-spectrin, RasGRF, and oxysterol binding protein (Rodriguez et al., 1999). The interactions between RACK1 with PKC and PLCγ are mutually exclusive (Chang et al., 1998), as are the interactions between RACK1 with PTPμ or src (Mourton et al., 2001). The interaction between RACK1 and src is enhanced by PKC activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of the RACK1 protein (Chang et al., 2001). These studies suggest a model where distinct complexes are formed via RACK1 in response to unique cellular signals.

RACK1 is a receptor for activated PKC (Ron et al., 1994). PKC(s) are a family of lipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases involved in many cellular processes including neurite outgrowth as well as growth, differentiation, secretion, apoptosis, and tumor development (reviewed in Gschwendt, 1999). Our goal was to determine whether the PTPμ/RACK1 complex associates with PKC(s) as a part of a signaling pathway to regulate PTPμ-dependent neurite outgrowth.

In this article, we demonstrate that PKCδ is involved in PTPμ-dependent neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cells. First, we show that most isoforms of PKC
including PKCδ are expressed in chick retinal cells. Second, we demonstrate that PTPμ, RACK1, and PKCδ exist in a complex in cultured retinal cells as well as retinal tissue. Third, using pharmacologic inhibition of PKC, we demonstrate that PKCδ activity is required for neurite outgrowth on a PTPμ substrate. Together, these results suggest that PTPμ signaling requires PKCδ activity to promote neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cells.

**RESULTS**

**PKC Isoforms Are Expressed in Chick Retinal Cells**

PTPμ interacts directly with the scaffolding protein RACK1 in a yeast two-hybrid system and in a mammalian cell line (Mourton *et al.*, 2001). RACK1 binds to activated PKC (Ron *et al.*, 1994). We investigated whether PKC interacts with PTPμ and RACK1 in retinal cells. There are at least nine isoforms of PKC and most are expressed in the retina and brain (Wood *et al.*, 1997). Immunoblot analysis showed that all isoforms tested except for PKCβ are expressed in embryonic day 8 (E8) chick retina and in E6 retinal neuroepithelial (RNE) cells (Fig. 1). The E8 retinas are used for the neurite outgrowth assays and E6 RNE cells are pluripotent neuroepithelial cells that can be cultured *in vitro* at different densities. Most avian PKC isoforms migrated on SDS-PAGE at the same rate as their mammalian homologue (rat brain extract) with the exception of PKCδ. Chick PKCδ migrated slower than the strongest band in the mammalian positive control. There were also several higher bands recognized by the PKCα antibody in both E8 retina and RNE cells. RACK1 was expressed in both retinal preparations (Fig. 1).

**PTPμ, RACK1, and PKCδ Exist in a Complex in Retinal Cells**

To examine whether PTPμ associates with RACK1 and PKC isoforms in chick retina, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using retina lysates (Fig. 2). PTPμ coimmunoprecipitates with RACK1 and the δ isoform of PKC in both retina tissue and retinal cultures. The other classical PKC isoforms that are expressed in retina were tested (α and γ) but not detected in a complex with PTPμ in the retina (data not shown). To determine whether the interaction between PTPμ with RACK1 and PKCδ was dependent on cell contact (i.e., induced by PTPμ homophilic binding), immunoprecipitation experiments were performed at two dif-

ferent cell densities to control the amount of cell–cell contact (Fig. 2). At low cell density (approximately 1 × 10⁷ cells/100-mm dish) there is very little contact between cells, whereas at high cell density (approximately 4 × 10⁷ cells/100-mm dish), the majority of cells are in contact with each other. The density experiments provide a model for retinal cell–cell adhesion as the cells contact other cells or axons. The immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with two monoclonal antibodies generated against intracellular epitopes in the PTPμ protein. The SK7 antibody binds to the juxtamembrane domain of PTPμ (Brady-Kalnay *et al.*, 1998). The

FIG. 2. RACK1 and PKCδ coimmunoprecipitate with PTPµ in E8 retina and in retinal neuroepithelial (RNE) cultures. (A) Lysates from E6 RNE cells at low (lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, 13) and high (lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14) density and from E8 retina (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15) were immunoprecipitated with control (lanes 1–3), RACK1 (lanes 4–6), PKCδ (lanes 7–9), or PTPµ (SK7, lanes 10–12; SK18, lanes 13–15) antibodies and were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE. Immunoblots were probed with RACK1 antibodies (A). RACK1 was detected in all RACK1 (A, lanes 4–6) and PKCδ (A, lanes 7–9) immunoprecipitates. PTPµ predominantly interacts with RACK1 in high-density RNE cultures (A, lane 11) and in E8 retina (A, lane 12), but not in low-density RNE cultures (A, lane 10). The interaction between PTPµ and RACK1 is not preserved in immunoprecipitates using the SK18 antibody (A, lanes 13–15). (B) Lysates from RNE cells at low (lanes 1, 4, 7) and high (lanes 2, 5, 8) density and from E8 retina (lanes 3, 6, 9) were immunoprecipitated with PKCδ (lanes 1–3) or PTPµ (SK7, lanes 4–6; SK18, lanes 7–9) antibodies. PKCδ was detected in all PKCδ immunoprecipitates (B, lanes 1–3). PTPµ predominantly interacts with PKCδ in high-density RNE cultures (B, lane 5) and in E8 retina (B, lane 6), but not in low-density RNE cultures (B, lane 4). The complex between PTPµ and PKCδ is not immunoprecipitated by the SK18 antibody (B, lanes 7–9). (C) Lysates from RNE cells at low (lanes 1, 4) and high (lanes 2, 5) density and from E8 retina (lanes 3, 6) were immunoprecipitated with the SK7 (lanes 1–3) or SK18 (lanes 4–6) antibodies to PTPµ and were separated by 6% SDS–PAGE. Immunoblots were probed with the PTPµ antibody SK15. Both full-length and proteolytically processed forms of PTPµ were detected in SK7 (C, lanes 1–3) and SK18 (C, lanes 4–6) immunoprecipitates.

SK18 antibody binds to the membrane proximal catalytic domain of PTPµ (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1998) which also contains the RACK1 binding site (Mourton et al., 2001). Both the full-length (200-kDa) and cleaved (100-kDa) forms of PTPµ were immunoprecipitated by both antibodies to PTPµ (Fig. 2C).

When immunoprecipitates of PTPµ were probed on immunoblots with RACK1 antibodies, an association was detected in both E8 retina and E6 RNE cultures at high cell density when the SK7 antibody was used (Fig. 2A, lanes 11 and 12). Interestingly, the SK18 antibody, which immunoprecipitated PTPµ, did not immunoprecipitate RACK1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–15). The epitope of SK18 antibody is the first phosphatase domain of PTPµ (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1998) and the RACK1 binding site in PTPµ is also the first phosphatase domain (Mourton et al., 2001). The PTPµ/RACK1 complex could not be immunoprecipitated using the SK18 antibody suggesting that the antibody binding site may overlap with the

RACK1 binding site on PTPµ. In addition, PKCδ was also detected by immunoblot in PTPµ immunoprecipitates using the SK7 antibody in E8 retina and E6 RNE cultures at high cell density (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). PKCδ was not detected in the SK18 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B, lanes 7–9), which also lack RACK1.

The association between PKCδ and RACK1 in E6 RNE cells was not affected by the degree of cell–cell contact (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). RACK1 binds to activated PKC (Ron et al., 1994). The RACK1/PKCδ complex was observed in RNE cultures under all conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). This result was not surprising since the retinal cell cultures were grown in the presence of serum, which contains growth factors known to stimulate PKC. However, the association between PTPµ with RACK1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 10 and 11) and PKCδ (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5) in E6 RNE cells was dependent on cell–cell contact. Together, these results suggest that PTPµ exists in a signaling complex with RACK1 and

The cells were fixed and double labeled with RACK1 antibodies (B, E) and PTPμ antibodies (A) or PKCδ antibodies (D) or secondary antibodies only (G–I). Phase contrast images are shown in C, F, and I. These proteins are present in neurites and growth cones of retinal ganglion cells. PTPμ (A) is diffusely localized throughout the growth cone and neurite, whereas RACK1 (B, E) and PKCδ (D) are localized predominantly in the central region of the growth cone as well as in the neurite.

PKCδ at high cell density. Most likely, RACK1 is mediating the interaction between PTPμ and PKCδ.

### PTPμ, RACK1, and PKCδ Are Present in the Neurites and Growth Cones of Retinal Ganglion Cells

PTPμ is expressed predominantly in retinal ganglion cells during retinal development and localized to the axons and growth cones of retinal ganglion cells (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). To determine whether RACK1 and PKCδ were also present in these cells, we performed double-label immunocytochemistry on retinal explants (Fig. 3). Neurites and growth cones growing on a laminin substrate were double labeled for PTPμ and RACK1 (Figs. 3A–3C) or PKCδ and RACK1 (Figs. 3D–3F). All three proteins were present in the neurites and growth cones of retinal ganglion cells. PTPμ is expressed throughout the neurite and growth cone (Fig. 3A). RACK1 (Figs. 3B and 3E) and PKCδ (Fig. 3D) are localized predominantly to the central region of the growth cone as well as the shaft of the neurite. There is colocalization of both PTPμ (Figs. 3A and 3B) and PKCδ (Figs. 3D and 3E) with RACK1 in the shaft of the neurite as well as in the central region of the growth cone.

#### Inhibition of PKCδ Blocks PTPμ-Dependent Neurite Outgrowth

Purified PTPμ is capable of promoting neurite outgrowth from E8 retinal explants (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). To determine whether PKCs were involved in PTPμ-dependent signaling to promote neurite outgrowth, PKC-specific inhibitors were used in the neurite outgrowth assay. The phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is a potent stimulator of PKC activity upon short-term treatment (minutes). However, long-term treatment on the order of 24 h results in inhibition of a broad spectrum of PKC isoforms (Ballester and Rosen, 1985) including PKCδ (Pucéat et al., 1994; Chen and Wu, 1995). Retinal explants were treated with PMA for the first 18–20 h after plating, and then the PMA was washed out and replaced with fresh medium. Under these conditions, PMA caused a significant decrease in neurite outgrowth on a PTPμ substrate (Figs. 4A, 4B, and 5; Table 1). The photographs shown (Figs. 4A and 4B) are representative of the median level of neurite outgrowth under control and test conditions. The effect of PMA treatment ranged from no neurites to a few short neurites. Quantitation of similar experiments indicated that overall neurite density was reduced by 94% and neurite lengths

Neural retina explants from E8 chick embryos were cultured on a PTPμ substrate in the presence of DMSO (A, C, E) or 20 nM PMA (B), 7 nM Gö6976 (D), or 0.5 μM rottlerin (F). The explant tissue is on the left of each panel. The neurites in each dish were examined using dark-field optics at 3–4 days after plating. Long-term treatment with PMA is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of PKC and blocks neurite outgrowth on a PTPμ substrate. Treatment with Gö6976 (inhibits PKCa and β) has no effect on PTPμ-dependent neurite outgrowth, whereas treatment with rottlerin (inhibits PKCδ) blocks PTPμ-dependent neurite outgrowth. Bar, 500 μm.

were reduced by 84% in cultures treated with PMA compared to control cultures treated with DMSO.

To determine which PKC isoforms were required for PTPμ-dependent outgrowth, isoform-specific PKC inhibitors were added to neurite outgrowth assays. Gö6976 specifically inhibits PKCa and PKCβ isoforms. This inhibitor had no effect on neurite outgrowth on a PTPμ substrate (Figs. 4C, 4D, and 5; Table 1). A slight increase in neurite length was observed in the presence of Gö6976 (Fig. 5B), but this increase was not statistically significant. Rottlerin specifically inhibits PKCδ and treatment with this inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction in PTPμ-dependent neurite outgrowth (Figs. 4E, 4F, and 5; Table 1). Quantitation of similar experiments showed that overall average neurite density was reduced by 82% and average neurite lengths were reduced by 54% in rottlerin-treated cultures compared to the control treatment with DMSO. Together, these results suggest that the PKC signaling pathway is involved in PTPμ-dependent neurite outgrowth and the isoform mediating this effect is likely to be PKCδ.

We wanted to test whether PKCδ was specifically involved in PTPμ-dependent neurite outgrowth or if it was required for neurite outgrowth on other substrates as well. Therefore, control neurite outgrowth assays performed on two other adhesion molecules, laminin and N-cadherin, were treated with the PKC inhibitors as described above. Laminin, an extracellular matrix molecule that binds to integrin receptors, induces robust outgrowth within 24 h of plating (Cohen et al., 1986). Cultures were treated with PMA for the first day after plating, and then the PMA-containing medium was washed out and replaced with normal medium. This washout procedure resulted in a slight overall delay in neurite outgrowth for both experimental and control cultures. After approximately 18 h of recovery time, the cultures were photographed. Under these conditions, PMA-induced inhibition of PKC resulted in a small decrease in length (10% decrease) and in density (28% decrease) in neurite outgrowth on laminin (Figs. 6A, 6B, 8A, and 8B; Table 1). The isoform-specific PKC inhibitors Gö6976 and rottlerin were also added to retinal neurite outgrowth cultures. Treatment with these inhibitors had no effect on laminin-induced neurite outgrowth (Figs. 6C, 6F, 8A, and 8B; Table 1). Therefore, we concluded that PKCδ is not involved in laminin-induced retinal neurite outgrowth.

The PKC inhibitors were also added to a neurite

E8 chick retina explants cultured on a PTP${}_{\mu}$ substrate were treated with DMSO (black bars) or a PKC inhibitor (PMA, gray bars; G06976, striped bars; rottlerin, hatched bars). Treatment with PMA (broad-spectrum inhibitor) and with rottlerin (PKC$\delta$ inhibitor) caused a statistically significant (asterisk) reduction in neurite density (A) and length (B), but treatment with G06976 (PKC$\alpha$ and $\beta$ inhibitor) had no effect on neurite density or length.

When cultures plated on a N-cadherin substrate were treated with PMA, neurite outgrowth was unaffected by broad-spectrum PKC inhibition (Figs. 7A, 7B, 8C, and 8D; Table 1). In addition, treatment with the isoform-specific PKC inhibitors resulted in a slight reduction in neurite outgrowth (Figs. 7C–7F, 8C, and 8D; Table 1). Inhibition of PKC$\alpha$ and PKC$\beta$ with G06976 caused a small reduction (19% decrease) in neurite

FIG. 6. Long-term PMA treatment has a subtle effect on laminin-induced neurite outgrowth. Neural retina explants from E8 chick embryos were cultured on a laminin substrate in the presence of DMSO (A, C, E) or 20 nM PMA (B), 7 nM Gö6976 (D), or 0.5 µM rottlerin (F). The explants are on the left of each panel. The neurites in each dish were examined using dark-field optics at 42 h (A, B) or 24 h (C–F) after plating. Long-term treatment with PMA is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of PKC and causes a small reduction in neurite outgrowth on a laminin substrate.

length and a slight reduction in neurite density that was not significant. Rottlerin, the PKCδ inhibitor, caused small reductions in both overall neurite density (36% decrease) and neurite length (27% decrease) compared to DMSO-treated controls. These results suggest that a PKCδ signaling pathway may play a minor role in N-cadherin-mediated neurite outgrowth. Together, the results of the PKC inhibitor studies clearly indicate a requirement for PKCδ activity in PTPµ-dependent neurite outgrowth.

### DISCUSSION

PTPµ is capable of promoting neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cell neurons (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). The ability of PTPµ to bind to RACK1 in yeast and mammalian cells suggests that PTPµ-dependent signaling may involve RACK1 (Mourton *et al.*, 2001) and perhaps the other RACK1 interacting proteins such as the PKCs. To determine whether PTPµ forms a signaling complex with RACK1 and PKCs, we examined whether PTPµ interacts with PKCs and RACK1 in E8 chick retina using immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates of PTPµ contained RACK1 and PKCδ. A complex of PTPµ, RACK1, and PKCδ was also observed in E6 RNE cells and the interaction was dependent upon cell–cell contact. The density dependence of the complex formation suggests that cell–cell binding stimulates the complex to form which may be involved in the propagation of signals. A working model of neurite outgrowth is that PTPµ on the culture dish (which mimics PTPµ on the neuronal cell surface) binds to PTPµ on the growth cone and this binding stimulates the formation of the PTPµ–RACK1–PKCδ signaling complex (see Fig. 9).

To determine whether PKCs, which bind to RACK1 in their activated state, are involved in PTPµ-dependent signaling, we examined the ability of various PKC inhibitors to affect neurite outgrowth on a PTPµ substrate. Long-term treatment with the phorbol ester PMA inhibits a broad spectrum of PKC isoforms and caused a large reduction in neurite outgrowth on a PTPµ substrate. To determine which isoform of PKC was mediating this effect, isoform-specific inhibitors were added to neurite outgrowth assays. Inhibition of the classical PKC isoforms α and β with Gö6976 had no effect on PTPµ-dependent neurite outgrowth. However, treatment with rottlerin, which inhibits PKCδ resulted in a large reduction in neurite outgrowth. Together, these results suggest that PKCδ activity may be regulated by PTPµ signaling to promote neurite outgrowth.

FIG. 7. PKC inhibitors have little effect on N-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth. Neural retina explants from E8 chick embryos were cultured on a N-cadherin substrate in the presence of DMSO (A, C, E) or 20 nM PMA (B), 7 nM Gö6976 (D), or 0.5 μM rottlerin (F). The explants are on the left of each panel. The neurites in each dish were examined using dark-field optics at 48 h after plating. Long-term treatment with PMA is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of PKC and has no effect on N-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth.

ously examined. Several groups have used phorbol esters as well as nonspecific protein kinase and PKC-specific inhibitors to study the role of PKC. They have examined both neuronal-like cell lines and primary neuronal cultures with seemingly contradictory results, depending on cell type, culture conditions, the stage of development used, and other variables. Treatment with phorbol ester inhibited neurite outgrowth from mouse neuroblastoma cells (Ishii et al., 1978; Herrick-Davis et al., 1991), chick sensory ganglia (Ishii, 1978), and rat sympathetic ganglia (Campenot et al., 1991). Conversely, phorbol ester treatment stimulated neurite formation from human neuroblastoma cells (Spinelli et al., 1982), chick ciliary ganglia (Bixby, 1989), and PC12 cells (O’Driscoll et al., 1995). Interestingly, neurite outgrowth from rat cerebellar neurons is inhibited by high doses of phorbol esters, whereas it is stimulated by low doses (Cambray-Deakin et al., 1990). Very recently, Kabir and colleagues (2001) have reported that stimulation of PKC by phorbol ester treatment of aplysia neurons resulted in the advance of microtubules into the peripheral region of the growth cone.

In our study, we examined the role of PKCs in neurite outgrowth of embryonic chick retinal cells cultured on the adhesion molecules PTPμ, laminin, and N-cadherin. We observed a large reduction in neurite outgrowth on a PTPμ substrate with prolonged treatment of PMA, compared to a small reduction on a laminin substrate and no effect on N-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth. Heacock and Agranoff (1997) observed that

protein kinase inhibitors including prolonged phorbol ester treatment and PKC-specific inhibitors were capable of inhibiting neurite outgrowth of regenerating adult goldfish retinal cells. Using PKC isoform-specific inhibitors, we found that inhibition of PKCδ mimicked the effect observed with the broad-spectrum inhibition of PKC on a PTPμ substrate. A role for PKCδ in neurite outgrowth appears to be unique to PTPμ-dependent neurite outgrowth, since this specific inhibitor had no effect on a laminin substrate and only a subtle effect on a N-cadherin substrate.

A role for PKC has been previously shown for neurons growing on laminin (Bixby, 1989) and N-cadherin (Bixby and Jhabvala, 1990) in other cell types. In ciliary ganglion neurons, short-term phorbol ester treatment (6–8 h) resulted in a potentiation of neurite outgrowth on suboptimal laminin concentrations (Bixby, 1989) and on a N-cadherin substrate (Bixby and Jhabvala, 1990). Additionally, the broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor H7 inhibited neurite outgrowth on laminin (Bixby, 1989). Treatment with H7 resulted in potentiation of the initial growth response on N-cadherin (8 h) but inhibition of neurite outgrowth by 16 h (Bixby and Jhabvala, 1990). Together with our results from retinal ganglion cells, it appears that the PKC pathway is regulated by specific adhesion molecules, perhaps in a PKC isoform-specific manner. No previous data are available from the studies mentioned above regarding the PKC isoforms involved in laminin or N-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth, but our study suggests that under these

FIG. 8. Quantitation of the effects of PKC inhibition on laminin and N-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth. E8 chick retina explants cultured on a laminin (A, B) or N-cadherin (C, D) substrate were treated with DMSO (black bars) or a PKC inhibitor (PMA, gray bars; Gö6976, striped bars; rottlerin, hatched bars) for 24 or 42 h. Treatment with PMA (broad-spectrum inhibitor) caused a small but statistically significant reduction in laminin-induced neurite density (A) and length (B). Treatment with Gö6976 (PKCα and β inhibitor) and rottlerin (inhibits PKCδ) had no effect on laminin-induced neurite density (A) or length (B). Treatment with PMA had no effect on neurite density (C) or length (D) on N-cadherin. Treatment with rottlerin caused a statistically significant decrease (asterisk) in both neurite density (C) and length (D), and treatment with Gö6876 caused a statistically significant decrease (asterisk) in neurite length (D). For statistical analysis, see Table 1.

conditions, PKCδ activity is not required for retinal ganglion cell neurite outgrowth on laminin or N-cadherin.

Our neurite outgrowth results suggest a role for PKCδ in retinal ganglion cell outgrowth on PTPµ. Osborne and colleagues (1992, 1994) have examined the localization of several PKC isoforms in the retinas of several species including chick. PKCδ, PKCe, and PKCζ were expressed in the inner segments of the photoreceptor cells of adult chick retina. Interestingly, close inspection of the photomicrographs suggests that low levels of PKCδ were also localized to the ganglion cell layer (Osborne et al., 1994). Our studies were performed in embryonic chick retina. Our immunocytochemical data confirm that PTPµ, RACK1, and PKCδ are all coexpressed in retinal ganglion cells (Fig. 3). The PKC family plays a number of roles in the retina including dopamine release, modulation of glutamate receptors and GABA<sub>c</sub> receptor function, involvement in retinal ischemia, cytoskeletal regulation, and inositol phosphate signaling (Wood et al., 1997). We provide evidence that PKCδ is involved in PTPµ-dependent neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cells.

Both N-cadherin and PTPµ are homophilic binding

FIG. 9. A model of PTPμ function in neurite outgrowth. PTPμ on the surface of migrating axons binds to PTPμ on the surface of neighboring axons and other cells. PTPμ–PTPμ binding initiates a signaling cascade that includes recruitment of RACK1 and PKCδ. PTPμ/PTPμ-dependent signaling is likely to be distinct from N-cadherin/N-cadherin-dependent signaling (signal X) although PTPμ catalytic activity is required for N-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth (signal Y).

proteins (Takeichi, 1988; Brady-Kalnay *et al.*, 1993). These proteins bind to themselves *in trans*; i.e., PTPμ binds to PTPμ on two apposing cells. PTPμ and N-cadherin are known to bind to one another *in cis* (within the plane of the membrane) via their cytoplasmic domains (Brady-Kalnay *et al.*, 1995, 1998). We have previously shown that PTPμ is required for N-cadherin-mediated neurite outgrowth (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). We have further demonstrated that the catalytic activity of PTPμ is required for N-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). N-cadherin homophilic binding may generate a specific signal within the neuronal cell body, axon, or growth cone (Fig. 9, illustrated as signal X). The N-cadherin/PTPμ *cis* interaction may involve another downstream signaling pathway (Fig. 9, illustrated as signal Y). We have no evidence to date that N-cadherin homophilic binding activates PTPμ catalytic activity or PTPμ-dependent signaling cascades that involve RACK1. We would argue from our data that the N-cadherin homophilic binding signal does not require PKCδ. Based upon our results, we hypothesize that PTPμ homophilic binding generates signals that are likely to involve RACK1 and PKCδ (Fig. 9). PTPμ may regulate PKCδ via its interaction with RACK1. Since PTPμ coimmunoprecipitates with RACK1 in di-

verse cell types (chick retina, shown here and MvLu cells, a mink lung cell line, Mourton *et al.*, 2001), the interaction between PTPμ and RACK1 may be a common mechanism for membrane localization of RACK1 and signaling complex formation.

A model for PTPμ-dependent signaling is beginning to emerge. PKC is activated at the cell membrane by diacylglycerol and phospholipid (reviewed in Ron and Kazanietz, 1999). Activated PKC binds to RACK1, translocates to the plasma membrane, and phosphorylates key substrates. Several PKC enzymatic substrates are necessary for neurite outgrowth, including GAP-43, CAP-23, and MARCKS (Aigner and Caroni, 1993; Meiri *et al.*, 1998; Laux *et al.*, 2000; Frey *et al.*, 2000). PTPμ could regulate PKC by several possible mechanisms. First, PTPμ may serve to localize RACK1 and PKC (via its RACK1 association) to a particular site in the plasma membrane where cytoskeletal changes will occur to promote neurite outgrowth. A change in subcellular localization may affect substrate availability of PKC and therefore its downstream signaling. It is also possible that PKC is an enzymatic substrate of PTPμ, since PKCδ is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Gschwendt, 1999). In addition, since src can alter the association of PTPμ with RACK1 (Mourton *et al.*, 2001), PTPμ may affect the phosphotyrosine levels of PKCδ indirectly by

displacing src from RACK1. RACK1 itself can be ty-
rosine phosphorylated and the interaction between
RACK1 and src is mediated by phosphotyrosines in the
sixth WD repeat (Chang et al., 2001). RACK1 could be a
substrate for PTPµ or PTPµ could modulate protein-
protein interactions between PKC, src, and RACK1.
The RPTPs are unique molecules combining adhesion
and signaling functions. The signaling functions of
these molecules have been difficult to study due to the
high degree of in vitro promiscuity. The present study
has demonstrated that PTPµ exists in a signaling com-
plex with the scaffolding protein RACK1 and PKCδ. We
have determined that the PKCδ isoform is required for
neurite outgrowth on a PTPµ substrate in chick retinal
ganglion cells. In conclusion these results suggest that

Methods

Retinal neuroepithelial cultures. Retinal neuroepi-
thelial cultures were prepared from E6 retinas using the
procedure described in BurdenGulley and Brady-Kal-
used at 0.6 mg of IgG per milliliter of beads, ascites fluid was used at 1 mg of IgG per milliliter of beads, and polyclonal serum was used at 3 mg of IgG per milliliter of beads. Immunoprecipitates were prepared from 250 μg of the Triton-soluble lysate of cells. The immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight at 4°C on a rocker, centrifuged at 3000g for 1 min. The supernatant was removed and the beads were separated then washed four times in lysis buffer and the bound material was eluted by addition of 100 μl of 2× sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95°C. One-fifth of the immunoprecipitate (20 μl) was loaded per lane of the gel, and the proteins were separated by 10% (for analysis of RACK1 and PKC) and 6% (for analysis of PTPμ) SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting.

**Neurite outgrowth assays.** PTPμ was purified from adult rat brains as described (Burden-Gulley and Brady-Kalnay, 1999). N-cadherin was purified from embryonic chick brains as described (Bixby and Zhang, 1990). Briefly, 35-mm tissue culture dishes were coated with nitrocellulose in methanol (Lagenaur and Lemmon, 1987) and allowed to dry. Protein (2–4 μg) was spread across the center of the dishes, and they were incubated 20–30 min at room temperature. Remaining binding sites on the nitrocellulose were blocked with 2% BSA in calcium-, magnesium-free Hank's buffered saline (CMF), and the dishes were rinsed with RPMI 1640 medium.

Embryonic day 8 (stage 32.5–33 according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951) chick eyes were dissected and the retina was flattened with the photoreceptor side down onto black nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm pore size) that had previously been incubated in 0.1% concanavalin A to aid in attachment of the retina to the filter. The filter was then cut into 350-μm-wide strips perpendicular to the optic fissure using a McIlwain tissue chopper. Strips were inverted onto substrate-coated culture dishes so that the ganglion cell layer was directly adjacent to the substrate. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% chick serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, 2 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 ng/ml amphotericin. For pharmacologic inhibition studies, PKC chemical inhibitors (final concentrations 7 nM Gö6976, 0.5 μM rottlerin, or 20 nM PMA) were added to the cultures and they were incubated at 37°C in 95% air/5% CO₂. For the PMA experiments, after 18–20 h the medium was exchanged for normal medium without inhibitors. For the Gö6976 and rottlerin experiments, the inhibitors remained in the culture for the entire culture period. Treatment with rottlerin at the IC₅₀ (3–6 μM) was toxic to the neurons; however, treatment with 0.5 μM rottlerin was not cytotoxic. Gö6976 was used at its IC₅₀ concentration. Cultures

were examined at approximately 24 and 42 h after plating for laminin and 48 h N-cadherin substrates and at approximately 72 and 96 h for cultures on a PTPμ substrate. Neurite outgrowth from each explant was photographed on a Nikon inverted microscope.

We used an established method for quantitation of neurite outgrowth in control and perturbation conditions (Drazba and Lemmon, 1990). Measurement of both length and density provides two distinct means to assess the overall growth (density is, in part, a measure of length also since it takes into account all neurites on the dish). All measurements were done at intervals that allowed us to examine the most robust neurite outgrowth on each substrate. To quantify the neurite outgrowth, the 35-mm negatives were scanned and the digitized images were analyzed using the Metamorph image analysis program (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Lengths of the five longest neurites per explant were measured perpendicular to the explant tissue. To measure the number of neurites per explant, the region of neurite outgrowth was outlined, the neurites were highlighted using the threshold function, and the total number of highlighted pixels was calculated. The neurite length and density measurements were analyzed by Fisher’s PLSD, Scheffe, and Student’s *t* test (Statview 4.51, Abacus Concepts, Inc.). The data from all like experiments were combined and graphed (SigmaPlot 2000, SPSS Inc.).
