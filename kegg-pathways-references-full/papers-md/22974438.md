## Abstract

Pancreatic β cells secrete insulin, the body’s only hormone capable of lowering plasma glucose levels. Impaired or insufficient insulin secretion results in diabetes mellitus. The β cell is electrically excitable; in response to an elevation of glucose, it depolarizes and starts generating action potentials. The electrophysiology of mouse β cells and the cell’s role in insulin secretion have been extensively investigated. More recently, similar studies have been performed on human β cells. These studies have revealed numerous and important differences between human and rodent β cells. Here we discuss the properties of human pancreatic β cells: their glucose sensing, the ion channel complement underlying glucose-induced electrical activity that culminates in exocytotic release of insulin, the cellular control of exocytosis, and the modulation of insulin secretion by circulating hormones and locally released neurotransmitters. Finally, we consider the pathophysiology of insulin secretion and the interactions between genetics and environmental factors that may explain the current diabetes epidemic.

# INTRODUCTION

Insulin is the body’s only blood glucose-lowering hormone and is secreted by the pancreatic β cells of the islets of Langerhans. A detailed knowledge about the process of insulin secretion is critical to the understanding of diabetes mellitus, a disease characterized by high blood glucose levels as a result of insufficient insulin for the body’s needs (1). Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions, and 5% of the world’s population (i.e., close to 350 million out of 7 billion) have the disease (2). Diabetes mellitus is broadly divided into two classes. Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease that results in β-cell destruction. It usually presents in childhood, accounts for 5–10% of all diabetes, and is associated with the presence of islet-cell antibodies, and patients require lifelong exogenous insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), the most common form of the disease (>90% of all diabetic patients have T2DM), has a strong genetic component, but the risk of developing the disease is influenced by lifestyle factors, such as age, pregnancy, and obesity (3). T2DM results when insulin secretion from the β cells is insufficient to match the functional requirements (4).

Much of our knowledge about the regulation of insulin secretion comes from work on rodent models. However, the ultimate goal of these endeavors is to dissect the causes of human diabetes. Although human and rodent β cells share many features, they are not identical, and observations in rodents should be confirmed in human cells. The Edmonton protocol provided proof of concept that normoglycemia can be restored (at least for a limited period) in patients with T1DM by transplantation of pancreatic islets obtained from organ donors (5). As a by-product of the islet transplantation program, more human islets also became available for research. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of insulin secretion in human β cells. We describe how glucose, following its metabolic degradation, physiologically triggers electrical activity. We also discuss the ion channels involved and how action potential firing, via an increase in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ ([Ca²⁺]i), triggers insulin granule exocytosis. We finally consider what may go wrong in T2DM and the possible nature of the causal defect(s).

## THE PANCREATIC ISLETS

A human pancreas contains ~1 million pancreatic islets (6). The pancreatic islets consist of several types of endocrine cells, of which the insulin-secreting β cells (50% of the cells in human islets), the glucagon-releasing α cells (35–40%), and the somatostatin-releasing δ cells (10–15%) are the most important ones (7). The islets receive a rich systemic vascular supply (via the splenic and superior mesenteric arteries), and the effluent empties into the portal vein. Although the islets compose only 1–2% of the pancreas, they receive ~10% of the blood supply (8). Whereas the pancreatic islets of rodents are extensively innervated, human islet cells are more sparsely innervated (9). Human and rodent islets also differ in their architecture. Rodent islets consist of a clearly demarcated core of β cells surrounded by a mantle of non-β cells. In contrast, in human islets, non-β cells line the islet capillaries located at the margin of the islet, as in rodents, but also penetrate into the center of the islets; the β cells are directly juxtaposed to the non-β cells, an arrangement that facilitates paracrine interactions (10).

of glucose. Accumulating evidence suggests that GLUT1 (encoded by *SLC2A1*) and GLUT3 (encoded by *SLC2A3*) are the predominant glucose transporters in human β cells; in contrast, Glut2 (encoded by *Slc2a2*) is the predominant glucose transporter in rodent β cells (11, 12). This difference may be functionally important because these glucose transporters transport glucose with different $K_m$ values: 6 mM for GLUT1, 11 mM for GLUT2, and 1 mM for GLUT3 (11). For comparison, plasma glucose levels in humans are maintained between 3.6 mM (after a prolonged fast) (13) and 7 mM (after a meal) (14).

Glucose metabolism is initiated by glucose phosphorylation, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glucokinase (GCK). Half-maximal activity ($EC_{50}$) of human GCK occurs at glucose concentrations of ~4 mM (15). Glucose phosphorylation by GCK is rate limiting to insulin secretion, and therefore loss-of-function mutations within the GCK gene result in reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion and in glucose intolerance or diabetes (16).

Unfortunately, few studies have been devoted to the metabolic regulation of insulin secretion from human islets. In islets from nondiabetic donors, the rate of glucose oxidation (measured as the production of ${}^{14}\mathrm{CO}_2$ from uniformly ${}^{14}\mathrm{C}$-labeled glucose) increases threefold when the glucose concentration is increased from 1 to 6 mM, and there is only a small further (25%) acceleration when the glucose concentration increases to more than 12 mM (15). Remarkably [and in contrast to what is the case in rodent islets (17), but see Reference 18], only ~10% of glucose entering glycolysis appears to proceed through mitochondrial oxidation in human islets (15). The metabolic fate of the remaining 85% remains unclear. In rodent isles, pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) enters mitochondrial metabolism to equal extents following decarboxylation (catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase) and carboxylation (catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase). In human islets, pyruvate carboxylase activity is only 15% of that in rat islets (19). Mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is essential for glucose-induced insulin secretion in human islets, and the application of mitochondrial uncouplers promptly inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion (20).

In human islets, stimulation of insulin secretion is detectable at concentrations as low as 3 mM (15, 20), lower than the ~6 mM threshold in mouse islets (21). Half-maximal stimulation is at ~11 mM and ~6 mM in mouse and human islets, respectively. These differences may account for the fact that the nonfasting plasma glucose concentration is lower in humans (~5 mM) (14) than in mice (7–10 mM) (22, 23). The higher glucose sensitivity of human islets is due to intrinsic β-cell properties, as witnessed by the fact that when human islets are transplanted into diabetic mice, insulin secretion regulates plasma glucose at the normal nonfasting glucose concentration for humans rather than at the normal nonfasting glucose concentration for mice (24).

### ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN HUMAN β CELLS AND THE ROLE OF $\mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{ATP}}$ CHANNELS

The β cell is electrically excitable and uses changes in membrane potential to couple variations in the blood glucose concentration to stimulation or inhibition of insulin secretion. The electrophysiology of mouse β cells and the cell’s role in insulin secretion have recently been reviewed elsewhere (25) and are not considered in detail here. As in rodent β cells, $\mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{ATP}}$ channels control electrical activity in human β cells (26, 27). In the absence of glucose (<1 mM), the β-cell membrane potential is negative and approximately −70 mV. Importantly, the resting membrane

conductance² in β cells exposed to 1 mM glucose is only 60 pS pF⁻¹, i.e., <10% of the 0.7 nS pF⁻¹ seen in mouse β cells (28). Increasing glucose to 6 mM reduces the resting conductance by 70% (29) and triggers membrane depolarization, and once a threshold potential of –60 mV is exceeded, regenerative electrical activity is observed (Figure 1a). These effects of glucose on membrane conductance and electrical activity are mimicked by the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibitor tolbutamide.

Glucose-induced electrical activity in human β cells is variable. At 6 mM glucose, bursting electrical activity is occasionally observed (Figure 1b). These membrane potential oscillations likely underlie the glucose-induced [Ca²⁺]<sub>i</sub> oscillations that can be recorded in small clusters of human β cells (Figure 1c) and that have been observed in intact human pancreatic islets (30). However, in most recordings, action potentials occur individually from a membrane potential of approximately –50 mV (Figure 1b).

**ION CHANNELS INVOLVED IN ACTION POTENTIAL FIRING**

Human β cells express a plethora of voltage-dependent and voltage-independent ion channels. Below we consider their molecular and biophysical characteristics and, in a few cases, their role in diabetes.

### Voltage-Gated Ca²⁺ Channels

Unlike in mice, human β cells are equipped with T-type Ca²⁺ channels that give rise to a transient (inactivating) Ca²⁺ current component (31). This current is reversibly blocked by the selective T-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker NNC 55-3096 (32). The current activates at membrane potentials of slightly above –60 mV and reaches a peak density of 3.5 pA pF⁻¹ at –30 mV. T-type Ca²⁺ channels undergo voltage-dependent inactivation, which is half-maximal at –65 mV. At voltages above –50 mV, the T-type Ca²⁺ current inactivates with a time constant of ~40 ms; this inactivation becomes more rapid at more depolarized membrane potentials.

The low-voltage-activated (LVA) T-type Ca²⁺ channels likely play a role in pacemaking in human β cells. This role is probably particularly important at membrane potentials at approximately the threshold for action potential firing (–55 mV). Indeed, the application of NNC 55-3096 suppressed action potential firing and inhibited insulin secretion elicited by 6 mM glucose. At the molecular level, the T-type Ca²⁺ channels in human β cells are likely encoded by CACNA1H (Caᵥ3.2), which is expressed at much higher levels than are other T-type Ca²⁺ channel genes. This possibility is supported by the sensitivity of the T-type current to low-micromolar concentrations of Zn²⁺ (M. Braun & P. Rorsman, unpublished observations).

In addition to the LVA T-type Ca²⁺ channels, human β cells are equipped with high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca²⁺ channels (31, 33). Opening of ω-agatoxin-sensitive P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels (CACNA1A) and opening of isradipine-sensitive, L-type Ca²⁺ channels contribute equally (40–45%) to the whole-cell Ca²⁺ current. Human islets express both α₁C/Caᵥ1.2 (CACNA1C) and α₁D/Caᵥ1.3 (CACNA1D) L-type Ca²⁺ channels, which may explain the biphasic voltage-dependent activation of the isradipine-sensitive L-type current (34). HVA Ca²⁺ channels activate quickly (taking <5 ms to peak) during depolarizations to membrane potentials above –40 mV. L-type channels, but not P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels, undergo significant Ca²⁺-dependent

(b) Patterns of glucose-induced action potential firing in human β cells: (i) single action potentials from a negative membrane potential (58% of recordings) and (ii) oscillatory electrical activity (26%). Recordings in panels $a$ and $b$ were performed in the presence of 6 mM glucose through the use of the perforated patch whole-cell technique (28). Oscillation periods in panel $ii$ vary greatly and range between 1 and 10 s.

inactivation, which at 0 mV proceeds with a time constant of 40 ms. Other types of channels, including the R-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, do not contribute much (if at all) to the HVA $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current in human β cells. In fact, $CACNA1E$ is not expressed at detectable levels in human islets, and the reported association between polymorphisms in $CACNA1E$ and T2DM (35) is therefore unlikely to reflect impaired β-cell function but rather results from systemic effects (i.e., is mediated by R-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in glucose-sensing cells outside the pancreatic islets). Both isradipine and ω-agatoxin strongly inhibit insulin secretion evoked by 6 mM glucose, whereas only isradipine

strongly inhibits insulin secretion elicited by 20 mM glucose. Isradipine strongly affects β-cell electrical activity and abolishes action potential firing. By contrast, the addition of ω-agatoxin has weaker effects and produces only a small reduction of the action potential amplitude. This paradox that ω-agatoxin inhibits insulin secretion without much affecting β-cell electrical activity may be explained by tight coupling of P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels to exocytosis in the human β cell (see below).

**Voltage-Gated Na⁺ Channels**

Human β cells are equipped with a large tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na⁺ current (31, 32). The maximum amplitude of the Na⁺ current is >40 pA pF⁻¹ at 0 mV. This current is approximately fourfold larger than the total Ca²⁺ current. Na⁺ currents are elicited by depolarizations to membrane potentials of −30 mV and above. The Na⁺ currents activate rapidly and peak within <1 ms (at −20 mV and above) and undergo almost complete inactivation within 5 ms. The Na⁺ current in human β cells undergoes voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation that is half-maximal at approximately −40 mV. This value is 60–70 mV more positive than the corresponding value in mouse β cells (36, 37). The addition of TTX to electrically active human β cells lowers the peak voltage of the action potentials and, in some cells, abolishes regenerative electrical activity. At the molecular level, the α subunit of the human β-cell Na⁺ current is likely encoded by SCN8A (Naᵥ1.6) or SCN9A (Naᵥ1.7), the two Na⁺ channel α subunits expressed at the highest level in human islets. Of the β subunits, SCN1B (which encodes the β₁ subunit) is expressed at levels fivefold higher than is SCN3B (which encodes the β₃ subunit).

**Large-Conductance Ca²⁺-Activated and Voltage-Gated Delayed Rectifying K⁺ Channels**

Large-conductance Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels (BK channels) (encoded by KCNMA1) are critical to the repolarization of the action potential in human β cells. BK channels open promptly upon membrane depolarization, and their activation echoes Ca²⁺ channel opening. In addition, human β cells contain a slowly activating, stromatoxin-sensitive (delayed rectifier) K⁺ current. At variance with mouse β cells, which express Kᵥ2.1/Kcn1b (38), mRNA expression data suggest that Kᵥ2.2 (KCNB2) channels carry the delayed rectifying K⁺ current in human β cells. The time constants of activation measured at −20 mV in the absence of iberiotoxin (when BK channels were active) and in the presence of iberiotoxin (to block BK channels, allowing the Kᵥ2.2 current to be studied in isolation) were ~2 ms and >10 ms, respectively. Thus, Kᵥ2.2 channels may not activate much during the upstroke of human β-cell action potentials, most of which typically last <10 ms. This scenario explains the divergent effects of stromatoxin and iberiotoxin on β-cell electrical activity. Whereas iberiotoxin increases action potential height, stromatoxin broadens the action potentials. However, only iberiotoxin affects glucose-induced insulin secretion from human islets. These data are significant because—on the basis of work in mouse islets, where Kᵥ2 channels play a more prominent role—these channels are considered a promising pharmacological target for enhancing glucose-induced insulin secretion (39). Although this strategy works well in mouse islets, it is less likely to be successful in human islets. However, recent evidence suggests that Kᵥ2.2 channels regulate exocytosis in human β cells independently of their ion-conducting function (40), an effect that may be possible to exploit pharmacologically.

KCNQ1 (which encodes Kᵥ7.1 channels) is expressed at low levels (at 10–30% of KCNMA1 and KCNB2 expression levels) in human islets. Intronic (noncoding) polymorphisms in KCNQ1 increase T2DM risk (41, 42). However, it is unclear whether Kᵥ7.1 channels contribute to the

voltage-gated K⁺ current or to action potential repolarization in human β cells; available inhibitors of the channel either were ineffective (JNJ 303) or had nonspecific effects on Kᵥ2.2 channels (chromanol 293B, linopirdine) (M. Braun & P. Rorsman, unpublished observations).

Human islets also contain high levels of KCNH2 (HERG1). HERG-like membrane currents, similar to those found in cardiac cells, have been recorded from human β cells (43). These channels carry little outward current during the action potential and are therefore unlikely to contribute much to action potential repolarization. However, the channels give rise to long-lasting tail currents, and they may thus influence the interval between successive spikes. Indeed, application of the HERG1 blocker WAY 123-398 increased action potential frequency and insulin secretion.

### Inwardly Rectifying K⁺ Channels

In human β cells, hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of –70 mV evoke progressively larger inward currents. The inward currents are unaffected by tolbutamide but are inhibited by low concentrations of Ba²⁺ (100 μM) and Cs⁺ (1 mM). The current-voltage relationship of the Ba²⁺-sensitive current reverses at ~–85 mV, close to the K⁺ equilibrium potential, suggesting the involvement of a K⁺-selective conductance. The current displays strongly inwardly rectifying properties and time-dependent inactivation at negative potentials. Collectively, these findings indicate that human β cells, like human δ cells (44), express a member of the inwardly rectifying K⁺ channel (Kᵢr) family. Quantitative PCR analyses confirmed the expression of Kᵢr2.2 (KCNJ12), Kᵢr2.3 (KCNJ4), and Kᵢr4.2 (KCNJ15) in human pancreatic islets (S. Amisten, M. Braun & P. Rorsman, unpublished observations).

Inhibition of the inward rectifiers by Ba²⁺ evokes membrane depolarization and stimulation of action potential firing in human β cells already exposed to glucose and tolbutamide. Conversely, an increase in the inwardly rectifying current should reduce β-cell electrical activity. A polymorphism in KCNJ15 (the gene encoding Kᵢr4.2) increases the diabetes risk >1.7-fold and increases KCNJ15 mRNA levels. Therefore, this gene variant may lower insulin secretion and increase diabetes risk via increased K⁺ conductance and reduced action potential firing.

### Small-Conductance Ca²⁺-Activated Channels

As in mouse islets, action potential firing in β cells in intact human islets is sometimes grouped into bursts (Figure 1a). The electrophysiological mechanism remains unclear, but extrapolation from mouse islets implicates small-conductance Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels (SK channels) activated by Ca²⁺ entry via voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (45–47). Human islets express SK3 (KCNN3), and blocking these channels with apamin stimulates action potential firing (48). Our own expression analyses detected transcripts of SK4 (KCNN4) at >10-fold-higher levels than those of KCNN2 and KCNN3 (KCNN1 was undetectable) (S. Amisten, M. Braun & P. Rorsman, unpublished observations). Application of the selective SK4 channel blocker TRAM34 (1 μM) enhanced insulin secretion evoked by 10 mM glucose approximately twofold while (surprisingly) having very little effect on electrical activity. The nonselective SK channel antagonist NS8593 also stimulated glucose-induced insulin secretion by approximately twofold, an effect associated with an ~10-mV depolarization and increased action potential firing.

### BACKGROUND (LEAK) CONDUCTANCE

Human islets (β cells) express several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. Some TRP channels are expressed at high levels in mouse pancreatic islets, but

C changes may still occur before final publication online and in print

their function remains largely enigmatic, and knockdown models mostly exhibit mild (if any) phenotypes with regard to electrical activity and insulin secretion (49). The role of TRP channels in human β cells has not been studied, but these channels may provide the depolarizing background membrane conductance required for β cells to depolarize upon K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure. However, the requirement for such a conductance in human β cells is weaker than in mouse β cells because of the presence of LVA T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the former.

Human islets also express the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing receptor (CaSR). CaSR activation through the use of the agonist R-568 triggers insulin secretion from human islets (50). In neurons, CaSR has been implicated as a regulator of electrical excitability (51). This effect involves interaction with the nonselective Na<sup>+</sup> leak channel NALCN. The gene encoding this channel (NALCN) is expressed in human islets (S. Amisten, M. Braun & P. Rorsman, unpublished observations), but no functional studies have been conducted to date.

## INTRACELLULAR ION CHANNELS

In addition to plasmalemmal ion channels, human islets are equipped with intracellular ion channels. Human islets express RYR2 (44), whereas RyR3 appears to be the predominant isoform in mouse islets (52). Activation of RYR2 by ryanodine application stimulates insulin secretion at 3 mM glucose but has no effect at higher glucose concentrations (53). The inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors (ITPR1–3) are expressed at >10-fold-higher levels than RYR2. The role of these ion channels in human β cells has not been studied but is likely to be the same as in rodent cells; these channels may mediate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in response to muscarinic receptor activation (54).

Human β cells also highly express the Cl<sup>−</sup> transporter protein CLC-3 (CLCN3). These transporters have been implicated in the regulation of exocytosis in mouse β cells and chromaffin cells (23, 55), and they may have a similar function in human cells.

## A MODEL FOR HUMAN β-CELL ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY

Figure 2 depicts the contribution of the different membrane currents to β-cell electrical activity. At nonstimulatory glucose concentrations (<3 mM), activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and K<sub>ir</sub> channels maintains a negative membrane potential in the β cell (−70 mV). At low stimulatory glucose concentrations (3.5–6 mM), the resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance (remaining K<sub>ATP</sub> and K<sub>ir</sub> channel activity) maintains a fairly negative membrane potential (−60 mV) while still allowing occasional openings of LVA T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The resultant depolarization initiates regenerative opening of additional T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, producing further depolarization. Eventually, the depolarization is large enough to activate L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, followed by the opening of TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> channels. The prominent roles of these channels in the initiation and upstroke of the action potential explain the inhibitory effects of isradipine and TTX on insulin secretion and electrical activity. At the peak of the action potential (−20 mV and above), P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open and trigger exocytosis of insulin granules. The elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> resulting from Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel opening activates BK channels, contributing to the action potential repolarization initiated by rapid voltage-dependent inactivation of the Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Stromatoxin-sensitive delayed rectifying K<sub>v</sub>2.2 channels (and possibly HERG channels) may also contribute to action potential repolarization, but their slow activation excludes a major effect. However, the slow deactivation of the K<sub>v</sub>2.2 and HERG channels may be responsible for the transient but prominent afterhyperpolarization that follows action potentials in many β cells. Cumulative voltage-dependent inactivation of the Na<sup>+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation of the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels

explain the reduced action potential height at steady state compared with that seen at the onset of electrical activity.

Interestingly, both TTX and ω-agatoxin are less effective inhibitors of insulin secretion in the presence of a high glucose concentration (20 mM) than at concentrations that are just suprathreshold (e.g., 6 mM) (31, 32). At a higher glucose concentration, the β cell may undergo stronger depolarization because of more complete inhibition of KATP channels. This stronger depolarization in turn results in voltage-dependent inactivation of Na+ channels, lowered action potential amplitude, and reduced opening of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. Accordingly, action potential firing and insulin secretion at high glucose principally involve L-type Ca2+ channels.

By analogy to the situation in mouse β cells, we propose that the grouping of the action potentials reflects the opening of Ca2+-activated SK channels and/or that of KATP channels due to the decreased intracellular ATP/ADP ratio resulting from SERCA (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase) activation (56). Restoration of the ATP/ADP ratio, lowering of [Ca2+]i, and reactivation of T-type Ca2+ channels may account for the pacemaker depolarization that precedes the next group of action potentials. However, whereas the role of the different voltage-gated ion channels found in human β cells in action potential firing is fairly well understood, there is considerable uncertainty about the origin of the slower membrane potential oscillations and their modulation.

A combination of two factors explains the fact that glucose triggers insulin secretion from human islets at concentrations lower than those required in mouse islets: (a) the much lower resting KATP channel activity and (b) the presence of LVA T-type Ca2+ channels that activate at fairly negative membrane potentials. Thus, even in low-glucose conditions, human β cells are closer to the threshold for electrical activity/insulin secretion than are mouse islets. Small depolarizing currents can therefore be expected to strongly stimulate β-cell electrical activity. This accounts for the strong stimulation of insulin secretion produced by the charged amino acid arginine, which induces a minute depolarizing current reflecting the electrogenic uptake mediated by the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) (57) (Figure 2a). Interestingly, arginine remains a strong stimulus of insulin secretion, even in T2DM islets, where glucose is less effective (58). This indicates that T2DM involves a small increase in resting membrane conductance, or else arginine is effective (59).

## MODULATION OF β-CELL ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY AND INSULIN SECRETION BY HORMONES AND NEUROTRANSMITTERS

The architecture of the human pancreatic islets combined with the innervation (9) and rich vascular supply (10) of the pancreatic islets not only may facilitate local neuronal, hormonal, and paracrine regulation of β cells in the individual islet but also may coordinate insulin secretion from the one million islets scattered throughout the pancreas. In this section we briefly summarize how some hormones and neurotransmitters regulate electrical activity and insulin secretion in human β cells. A consistent feature of these regulators is that they act at the level of both the membrane potential/electrical activity and the exocytotic release of insulin. Below we consider a few examples of stimulatory and inhibitory agonists. Several additional regulatory mechanisms (not discussed here) likely operate within and between human pancreatic islets.

### Somatostatin and Adrenaline

The pancreatic δ cells, which frequently make contact with several other endocrine cells within the islets, release somatostatin. Somatostatin application results in strong membrane repolarization and in inhibition of action potential firing. Adrenaline, via activation of α2-adrenergic receptors, produces similar inhibitory effects (Figure 3a). This inhibitory effect of somatostatin on electrical

activity cannot be antagonized by sulfonylureas, suggesting that these agonists, as in mouse β cells (60), act by the activation of K⁺ channels distinct from the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel (M. Braun & P. Rorsman, unpublished observations). This membrane hyperpolarization was diminished in the presence of tertiapin-Q, suggesting the involvement of G protein–coupled inwardly rectifying K⁺ channels (GIRKs) (62). Indeed, human islets express two members of the GIRK subfamily of K<sub>ir</sub> channels: KCNJ3 (K<sub>ir</sub>3.1) and KCNJ6 (K<sub>ir</sub>3.2) (S. Amisten, M. Braun & P. Rorsman, unpublished observations).

In rodent β cells, somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5) represents the functionally important receptor (63, 64). In human β cells, SSTR5 antagonists are largely ineffective, and the pharmacological data instead implicate SSTR2 and –3 (65, 66). In addition to its effect on electrical activity, somatostatin inhibits insulin secretion by directly affecting exocytosis (B. Kailey, P. Rorsman & M. Braun, unpublished observations) (Figure 3c), similar to the inhibitory effect on exocytosis that was previously documented in rodent β cells (67, 68).

## Acetylcholine

Acetylcholine (ACh) stimulates insulin secretion by activating muscarinic ACh receptor M3 (70). The effects involve moderate membrane depolarization and increased β-cell electrical activity (Figure 3c). In mouse β cells, ACh causes membrane depolarization by opening NALCN channels (69). These channels are also expressed in human islets (see above). The glucagon-producing α

cells release ACh, activating M3 receptors in β cells and thus potentiating glucose-induced insulin (70). In addition to the effect on electrical activity, muscarinic receptor activation may also evoke insulin secretion by IP₃-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores (see above) and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent amplification of exocytosis (54) (Figure 3c).

## Adenine Nucleotides

Insulin granules contain adenine nucleotides at an intragranular concentration of ~5 mM (71). These nucleotides are coreleased with insulin during β-cell exocytosis (72, 73). Both P2X and P2Y receptor agonists stimulate glucose-induced insulin secretion (74). ATP coreleased with insulin depolarizes human β cells and augments insulin secretion in an autocrine fashion via activation of ionotropic P2X₃ receptors (75). Similarly, ADP (an agonist of metabotropic P2Y receptors) depolarizes human β cells and stimulates electrical activity as potently as ATP (76). The role of P2X and P2Y receptors in the regulation of insulin secretion in human islets merits further investigation.

## γ-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)

Pancreatic islets contain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at levels comparable to those found in the central nervous system (77, 78). A subset of the insulin-containing secretory granules contains

Contribution of different ion channels to glucose-induced electrical activity in the human β cell. Schematic of the stimulus secretion coupling in human β cells (*a*) and a representative recording of the membrane potential illustrating the contribution of different ion channels to human β-cell electrical activity (*b*). The numbers (①–⑨) highlight different processes considered below. At nonstimulatory glucose concentrations (<3 mM), the activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and inwardly rectifying K⁺ channels (K<sub>ir</sub>) maintains a negative membrane potential in the β cell. When glucose is increased to concentrations that are just above the threshold for stimulation of insulin secretion (3.5–6 mM), increased glucose uptake (via GLUT1) across the plasma membrane (PM) and stimulated glucose metabolism [initiated by phosphorylation by glucokinase (GCK)] lead to increased membrane resistance (*R<sub>m</sub>* ↑), due to the closure of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (①) resulting from the metabolically induced elevation of the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio. When the membrane resistance is high, spontaneous openings of T-type Ca²⁺ channels (Ca<sub>T</sub>; ②) depolarize (*Ψ* ↓) the β cell sufficiently to initiate regenerative opening of additional T-type Ca²⁺ channels, producing further depolarization. Eventually, the depolarization is large enough to activate L-type Ca²⁺ channels (Ca<sub>L</sub>), followed by the activation of TTX-sensitive Na⁺ channels (Nav; ③). At the peak of the action potential (−20 mV and above), P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels (Ca<sub>P/Q</sub>) open, and the increase in [Ca²⁺]<sub>i</sub> triggers exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules (SG) (indicated by the *plus sign*) (④). The elevation of [Ca²⁺]<sub>i</sub> resulting from Ca²⁺ channel opening also leads to the activation (indicated by the *plus sign*) of BK channels. Opening of these channels, in combination with rapid inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub> channels, underlies action potential repolarization (⑤). Slow deactivation of voltage-gated K⁺ channels (K<sub>v</sub>, i.e., K<sub>v</sub>2.2 and HERG channels), which activated during the action potential, may be responsible for the transient afterhyperpolarization that follows action potentials in many β cells (⑥). Cumulative voltage-dependent inactivation of Na⁺ channels and Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca²⁺ channels explain the reduced action potential height at steady state compared with that seen at the onset of electrical activity (⑦). Opening of Ca²⁺-activated SK channels and/or that of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels due to the decreased intracellular ATP/ADP ratio resulting from SERCA (sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase) activation (⑧). Restoration of the ATP/ADP ratio, lowering of [Ca²⁺]<sub>i</sub>, and reactivation of T-type Ca²⁺ channels may account for the pacemaker depolarization that precedes the next group of action potentials (⑨). Also indicated in panel *a* is the mechanism by which arginine triggers insulin secretion. Arginine depolarizes the β cell by its electrogenic transport into the β cell via cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) and so bypasses the effects of glucose metabolism on electrical activity.

Regulation of β-cell electrical activity by hormones and neurotransmitters. (a) Membrane hyperpolarization (16 ± 4 mV; n = 5, P < 0.05) and inhibition of β-cell electrical activity by the addition of 5 μM adrenaline. (b) Depolarization (5 ± 3 mV; n = 8, P < 0.05) and stimulation of β-cell electrical activity by the addition of 20 μM of the muscarinic agonist carbachol. In both panels a and b, electrical activity was recorded in the presence of 6 mM glucose through the use of the perforated patch whole-cell technique. (c) Somatostatin (SST), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and acetylcholine (ACh) influence insulin secretion by affecting electrical activity (via ion channels) (lower part) and by distally affecting exocytosis (upper part). GLP-1 acts by activation of adenylate cyclase (AC), and the resultant elevation of cAMP leads to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and Epac2, which mediate the effects on exocytosis and activity of the KATP channel (which consists of the pore-forming subunit Kir6.2 and the regulatory subunit SUR1). ACh, via activation of muscarinic M3 receptors, activates phospholipase C (PLC), and the stimulatory effects involve activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which stimulates exocytosis, and activation of depolarizing ion channels (NALCN?). In addition, ACh mobilizes intracellular Ca²⁺ by activation of IP₃ receptors (not shown). Somatostatin, via activation of SSTR2 and SSTR3, repolarizes the β cell, possibly by activation of GIRK channels; inhibits Ca²⁺ entry via P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels; and directly affects insulin granule exocytosis. Adrenaline, by binding to α₂-adrenoreceptors, likely acts via mechanisms similar to those activated by somatostatin. The processes activated by ACh, SST, and GLP-1 are denoted by green, gray, and red, respectively.

GABA at an ~20 mM concentration (71, 79). Human β cells express both ionotropic GABAA and metabotropic GABAB receptors. GABAA receptors in human β cells consist of α₂, β₃, γ₂, and π subunits. Because [Cl⁻]i in human β cells is ~35 mM (giving an equilibrium potential for a Cl⁻-selective conductance of –35 mV), GABAA receptor activation leads to membrane depolarization, action potential generation, and the stimulation of insulin secretion. Thus, GABA exerts an autocrine stimulatory effect in human islets, and blocking GABAA receptors by using SR95531 inhibits insulin secretion evoked by 6 mM glucose (79). By contrast, GABAB receptor activation (GABAB receptor 1/GABBR1 is the only GABAB receptor detected in human islets) inhibits insulin secretion, and blocking these receptors (by CP55485) accordingly stimulates glucose-induced insulin secretion (80). Preliminary data suggest that inhibition of exocytosis mediates the latter effect. Thus, the GABAB agonist baclofen inhibits depolarization-evoked exocytosis in voltage-clamped human β cells without significantly affecting Ca²⁺ entry (P. Rorsman & M. Braun, unpublished data).

## Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 and Glucagon

The gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), released by the intestinal L-cells, potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion from human islets (81). GLP-1 is effective at picomolar concentrations and acts by a combination of at least two effects (82) (Figure 4c). First, GLP-1 enhances the inhibitory effect of glucose on KATP channel activity. Second, GLP-1 enhances β-cell Ca²⁺-dependent exocytosis via elevation of intracellular cAMP concentrations, and the latter effect amplifies the stimulation due to increased electrical activity (83). As in rodent islets (84), an elevation of cAMP concentration occurs by both protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent and PKA-independent mechanisms; the latter mechanism involves the alternative cAMP sensor Epac2 (85). Many effects of GLP-1 are likely shared by the islet hormone glucagon, which is released from the neighboring α cells and also acts by elevating intracellular cAMP concentrations. Because glucagon is a powerful stimulus of insulin secretion in humans, it has been used to assess (residual) β-cell function in vivo (86).

## CONTROL OF INSULIN SECRETION

The objective of β-cell electrical activity is to produce the [Ca²⁺]i elevation that triggers exocytosis of insulin granules. Glucose- and amino acid–induced insulin secretion follows a biphasic time course (20) (see Figure 4a). The basal rate of secretion corresponds to <0.01% of insulin content min⁻¹, transiently increases to 0.15% min⁻¹ ~5 min after increasing glucose (first-phase secretion), and finally (after about 10 min) settles at >0.05% min⁻¹ (second-phase secretion). Human β cells contain ~10,000 secretory granules (68). In terms of secretion per β cell, the above rates therefore correspond to 1 granule min⁻¹ (basal), 15 granules min⁻¹ (peak first phase), and 5 granules min⁻¹ (steady-state second phase).

It is interesting to compare these in vitro values with measurements of insulin secretion in vivo. A hyperglycemic clamp to 12.5 mM increases insulin secretion from a basal <100 pmol min⁻¹ to 1,500 pmol min⁻¹ and ~400 pmol min⁻¹ during first-phase secretion and second-phase secretion, respectively (87). A human insulin granule contains 1.8 attomoles of insulin (88). The volume of human islets is normally distributed around a mean islet diameter of 130 μm (6, 89), equating to an average islet volume of ~1.15 nl (if we assume spherical geometry). When allowance is made for the volume occupied by the interstitial space and blood vessels (35%) as well as by non-β cells (30%) (90), and if we take into account that every β cell has a volume of 3 pl (on the basis of a cell capacitance of 10 pF, a specific membrane capacitance of 10 fF μm⁻², and an assumption of

Regulation of biphasic insulin secretion. $(a)$ Biphasic insulin secretion (top) and $\beta$-cell electrical activity (bottom). The decline in insulin secretion following the initial peak (the first phase; ①) toward a sustained steady-state rate (the second phase; ②) is attributed to $(i)$ IRP depletion and $(ii)$ reduced action potential amplitude due to voltage-dependent and/or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent inactivation of ion channels ($\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels and L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, respectively) involved in action potential firing. The lowered action potential amplitude leads to reduced insulin secretion because insulin exocytosis is steeply dependent on voltage and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry. Secretion data have been redrawn from Reference 20. $(b)$ (Top) Example of $\beta$-cell action potential. The action potential exceeds $-20 \, \mathrm{mV}$ (the threshold for exocytosis) for $<5 \, \mathrm{ms}$. (Lower) Exocytic responses measured as increases in membrane capacitance ($\Delta C_{\mathrm{m}}$; measured in femtofarads) in $\beta$ cells within intact human pancreatic islets. Responses were normalized against cell capacitance (measured in picofarads and in every $\beta$ cell), which averages $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{pF}$ (32), and are displayed against $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, which is measured as the integrated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current ($Q_{\mathrm{Ca}}$; measured in picocoulombs). Changes in cell capacitance were converted to the approximate number of granules undergoing exocytosis (right). Exocytosis in $\beta$ cells within intact islets has a rapid component that plateaus for integrated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents between 1 and $2 \, \mathrm{pC} \, \mathrm{pF}^{-1}$. Data are mean values $\pm$ SEM of five $\beta$ cells. The numbers next to the data points correspond to the duration of the depolarizations to $0 \, \mathrm{mV}$ used to trigger exocytosis. $(c)$ Exocytosis in $\beta$ cells during action potentials. The $\beta$ cell contains a reserve pool (RP) and a readily releasable pool (indicated by asterisks) of granules. Only readily releasable pool granules situated close to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and exposed to the active zones of elevated $[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\mathrm{i}}$ (red gradient shapes) undergo exocytosis during the brief and localized increases in $[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\mathrm{i}}$ in response to a $\beta$-cell action potential.

Under a scenario of one million islets per human pancreas (6), the above in vivo values correspond to average secretion rates per $\beta$ cell of $<0.3$ granules min${}^{-1}$ (basal), $4.5$ granules min${}^{-1}$ (during peak first phase), and $1$ granule min${}^{-1}$ (during second-phase secretion). These figures are certainly only rough estimates, but they suggest that insulin secretion in isolated islets in vitro proceeds at rates

comparable to those observed in vivo. These considerations also illustrate that the healthy human β cell has considerable spare capacity. We can estimate that during the 1-h hyperglycemic clamp discussed above (87), a total of only 70 granules per β cell underwent exocytosis. This number is only 10% of the granules docked below the plasma membrane (91).

**Proteins Involved in Insulin Exocytosis**

Studies on mouse islets have established that the molecular machinery involved in insulin exocytosis is similar to that controlling neurotransmitter release. Thus, the SNARE proteins syntaxin-1, SNAP25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa), and VAMP-2 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 2) are expressed in human islets (92). Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) represents the Ca²⁺ sensor of exocytosis in mouse β cells (93), and human β cells also express SYT7 (94) as well as SYT5 (S. Amisten, M. Braun & P. Rorsman, unpublished observations). The similarities of the molecular machineries involved in insulin exocytosis and neurotransmitter release may explain why patients with schizophrenia, for which impaired synaptic transmission has been implicated (95, 96), are at increased risk of developing T2DM (97).

**Single-Cell Measurements of Exocytosis**

High-resolution capacitance measurements (88) of exocytosis have been applied to isolated human β cells (32). The observed depolarization-evoked increases in membrane capacitance can be converted to the number of granules released because every insulin granule contributes ~3 fF of capacitance [as expected for a vesicle with a diameter of ~0.3 μm (98)]. Exocytosis is negligible during depolarizations to voltages of less than –20 mV. At more positive membrane potentials, exocytosis increases steeply with voltage and reaches a maximum at membrane potentials of ~0 mV. A secondary decline in exocytosis is observed at voltages beyond 0 mV, echoing the decrease in Ca²⁺ entry due to the reduction of the electrochemical driving force. This voltage dependence most closely resembles that of the P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels. Indeed, exocytosis in human β cells is highly sensitive to ω-agatoxin (32). Exocytosis is highly dependent on Ca²⁺ entry and can be described by a fourth order of Ca²⁺ influx, which is indicative of a high degree of cooperativity (83).

Analysis of the kinetics of exocytosis in human single β cells indicates that depolarizations shorter than 50 ms evoke negligible insulin secretion (32). Action potentials in human β cells are very short, and the time spent at voltages above –20 mV (the threshold for exocytosis) is only ~5 ms. It may therefore seem surprising that insulin is secreted at all. Recent measurements of exocytosis in β cells in intact, freshly isolated islets resolve this conundrum (99). In these experiments, a 6-ms depolarization to 0 mV elicited a mean capacitance increase of 20 fF (Figure 4b). We propose that exocytosis in response to short (action potential-like) stimulation involves a pool of secretory granules situated in close proximity to voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. We estimate the size of the pool capable of engaging in this ultrafast form of exocytosis to be ~70 secretory granules per β cell. The reason why this pool of granules is not found in isolated β cells remains unknown, but this pool may be absent due to the rearrangement of the cytoarchitecture following islet dissociation and cell culture.

**Cell Physiology of Biphasic Insulin Secretion**

Measurements of exocytosis in human β cells suggest that exocytotic capacity declines during repetitive stimulation (83, 91). This behavior has been attributed to the subdivision of the secretory

granules into distinct functional pools that vary with regard to release competence and/or proximity to the plasma membrane (88). According to this model, the initial bout of exocytosis reflects the release of a finite, readily releasable pool (RRP) of granules situated just below the plasma membrane. Once the RRP is depleted, the time-dependent recruitment of new granules to the release sites becomes rate limiting, which accounts for the slower sustained phase.

Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of fluorescently tagged insulin granules has confirmed that, in the human β cell, glucose-induced insulin secretion, in contrast to what appears to be the case in rodent β cells (100), principally involves granules residing close to the plasma membrane (91). As discussed above, first-phase insulin secretion in human islets in vitro lasts ~10 min and attains a peak rate of 15 granules min⁻¹. Approximating first-phase insulin secretion to a triangle, we can estimate that it involves exocytosis of a total of 75 granules per β cell, a value close to that estimated for the ultrafast component of exocytosis described in the preceding section. Accordingly, first-phase insulin secretion engages only 10% of the granules docked below the plasma membrane (91) and <30% of the total RRP [estimated from release in response to a high-K⁺ depolarization (83, 91)]. We therefore propose that most docked granules are not available for release because they have not attained release competence (i.e., have not entered the RRP) or are situated too far away from the Ca²⁺ channel to undergo exocytosis during the short-lived and localized increases in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ resulting from individual action potentials. Only when the depolarization duration is extended into the nonphysiological range (e.g., by high-K⁺ depolarization in vitro), thus extending the cellular domain of elevated [Ca²⁺]ᵢ, can these more distant RRP granules be recruited for exocytosis (Figure 4c).

However, depletion of the RRP by repetitive stimulation may not be the sole cause of the termination of first-phase insulin secretion. Another cause may be the impact of inactivating voltage-dependent ion channels involved in action potential firing. The amplitude of action potentials declines with time during sustained stimulation with glucose (Figure 1a). The time-dependent decline of the action potential amplitude may also contribute to the termination of first-phase insulin secretion because exocytosis in β cells is steeply voltage dependent; a 10-mV reduction of spike height can be predicted to reduce insulin secretion by ~50% (32), in good agreement with the decline of insulin secretion that occurs between first-phase insulin secretion and second-phase insulin secretion (Figure 4a). More studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying biphasic insulin secretion in human islets, the relationship of biphasic insulin secretion to the pulsatile nature of insulin secretion in vivo (101), and the impairment of biphasic insulin secretion in T2DM (102).

## The Amplifying Effect of Glucose

Exocytosis of insulin granules requires that they be brought in close proximity to the plasma membrane. However, although physical translocation of granules is both functionally (103) and quantitatively (91) important for the maintenance of secretion in the longer term (hours or days), the acute (minute-by-minute) regulation of insulin secretion may simply involve modulation of the release competence of the secretory granules already situated below (or close to) the plasma membrane. Such modulation may be particularly relevant to understanding the amplifying effect of glucose on insulin secretion. In addition to the stimulation mediated by membrane depolarization and the initiation of electrical activity (referred to as the triggering effect), glucose also amplifies insulin secretion by potentiating the stimulatory effect of elevated [Ca²⁺]ᵢ (104). The amplifying effect is operational in human β cells, becomes detectable within minutes of glucose addition, and explains the stimulation of insulin secretion when glucose is added to islets already maximally depolarized with high extracellular K⁺ (20). The signal mediating the amplifying effect remains

unknown but may be NADPH (105) or glutamate (106); however, the molecular mechanism remains obscure.

Recent data indicate that SYT7 (one of the Ca²⁺ sensors of exocytosis in human β cells) is subject to reversible attachment of SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier protein 1). At low glucose concentrations, SYT7 is sumoylated, and such sumoylation, via reduced Ca²⁺ sensitivity, restricts exocytosis. Glucose activates the desumoylating enzyme SENP-1 (SUMO-1/sentrin-specific peptidase 1) and thereby amplifies insulin secretion via desumoylation of SYT7 (94). One future research area is to see whether neurotransmitters and hormones like GLP-1 and somatostatin stimulate and inhibit insulin secretion via reversible desumoylation and sumoylation, respectively.

# INSULIN SECRETION AND β-CELL FUNCTION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES

Impaired β-cell function is part of the etiology of T2DM (1, 3). Indeed, glucose-induced insulin secretion from islets isolated from patients with T2DM is reduced by 60% compared with such secretion in nondiabetic controls. This decrease is evident even when insulin secretion is expressed as a percentage of insulin content (68), suggesting that T2DM involves impaired β-cell function and is not solely a matter of reduced β-cell mass (107). Although T2DM is associated with reduced expression of key exocytic proteins (92), such reduced expression does not result in reduced depolarization-evoked exocytosis, at least when the measurements are conducted in the presence of high intracellular cAMP (68). Moreover, glucose-induced insulin secretion is more severely impaired than that evoked by release evoked by sulfonylureas or high K⁺ in vitro (58, 108). These findings suggest that the functional defect lies upstream in the stimulus-secretion pathway of [Ca²⁺]i elevation and the generation of electrical activity. Indeed, oxidative glucose metabolism (measured as oxygen consumption rate) is reduced in islets from T2DM donors (15). Such an impairment of glucose metabolism may, via reduced mitochondrial ATP production, compromise the ability of glucose to close KATP channels and evoke β-cell electrical activity and secretion (see Figure 2a). Interestingly, the expression of GCK (the first enzyme of the glycolytic breakdown of glucose) is reduced in islets from T2DM donors (58). Circumstantial evidence that reduced GCK expression may play an important role in T2DM comes from the observation that the secretion defect of T2DM islets can be corrected by a GCK activator (15).

## Role of Genes in T2DM

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >60 common gene variants or loci that individually produce a small increase in risk for developing T2DM (109–111). Most of these genes/loci have features that suggest a role in β-cell function and/or mass. The functional consequences of some of these gene variants have been reviewed elsewhere (3), but in most cases the mechanisms by which they predispose to diabetes remain an enigma. We recently analyzed the impact of 14 GWAS gene variants on the insulin secretion, exocytosis, and ultrastructure of human β cells (68). Of these variants, only *TCF7L2* (encoding transcription factor 7–like 2) and *ADRA2A* (encoding the α₂-adrenoreceptor) were associated with reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas susceptibility variants near *ADRA2A*, *KCNJ11* (encoding the KATP channel subunit Kir6.2), *KCNG1*, and *TCF7L2* resulted in reduced insulin exocytosis (as measured by recordings of membrane capacitance). In addition, *KCNG1*, *ADRA2A*, *KCNJ11*, and *HHEX/IDE* (encoding a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors) affected granule docking (as determined by electron microscopy). Why and how variants of *KCNG1* and *KCNJ11* (the latter encoding the KATP channel subunit Kir6.2) influence exocytosis and granule docking are unknown. There is

some evidence that sulfonylureas (which block K<sub>ATP</sub> channels) modulate exocytosis independently of their effects on β-cell electrical activity (112). As to the role of the KCNQ1 locus, the risk variant may affect the expression of neighboring genes rather than that of the ion channel itself (113).

**Role of Lipids in T2DM**

A major challenge in diabetes research is to understand the link between obesity and impaired/inadequate β-cell function that explains perhaps 80–85% of the current diabetes epidemic (3). Obesity results in insulin resistance (failure of insulin receptor activation in peripheral tissues) (114), but in most individuals, the β cell can compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion (115). T2DM results only when the insulin requirement exceeds the β cell’s capacity to release insulin.

In vitro, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) exert both stimulatory and inhibitory effects. Whereas acute elevation of NEFA potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion from human islets (20), protracted (>48-h) exposure leads to a time-dependent suppression of glucose-induced insulin secretion (116, 117). There is evidence from both rodent and human islets that the inhibitory effect of NEFA on glucose-induced insulin secretion involves a redistribution of plasmalemmal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels such that the pool of granules situated sufficiently close to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to undergo exocytosis during action potential firing is lost (117). During starvation, very high plasma NEFA levels occur (118). In parallel with the mobilization of NEFA from the adipocytes, gluconeogenesis ensures that plasma glucose levels are maintained at ≥3.5 mM even during protracted starvation. The combination of this glucose concentration and high NEFA levels is sufficient to evoke electrical activity and, at least in islets from fed individuals, to stimulate insulin secretion (14, 119). The redistribution of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels away from the secretory granules may represent the physiological mechanisms of preventing inappropriate insulin release during starvation by reducing the capacity of electrical activity/Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to trigger exocytosis. This mechanism may become erroneously activated in T2DM as a consequence of the lack of insulin and activation of lipolysis, which may contribute to the (rapid) progression of the disease by establishing a vicious cycle of progressive elevation of plasma NEFA levels and deterioration of glucose-induced insulin secretion. However, it is unlikely to cause T2DM because obesity is not associated with a sustained elevation of plasma NEFA levels (120).

Acute elevation of NEFA stimulates insulin secretion in both rodent and human islets in vitro (20, 118). The exact mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effect remain to be fully elucidated but include slight elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and amplification of exocytosis (121, 122). These effects may be mediated by activation of the NEFA receptor GPR40 (123, 124). GPR40 is expressed in human islets at levels comparable to those of the receptor for GLP-1 (GLP-1R), and the GPR40 agonist TAK-875 potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion (125). The physiological significance of the insulinotropic effects of NEFA is not evident. NEFA do not stimulate insulin secretion following a mixed meal, as plasma NEFA levels fall following feeding (14). However, moderate elevations in plasma NEFA short-term fasting may play an important role in maintaining a normal insulin-secretory response to glucose (126), and a normally occurring nocturnal elevation of plasma NEFA (when insulin concentrations are low) represents the signal connecting insulin resistance to increased β-cell function (127). In this context, it is of interest that a sustained elevation of plasma NEFA levels for 48 h resulted in marked insulin resistance and reduction of glucose-induced insulin secretion, but only in individuals with a family history of diabetes (87); in a control group, chronic elevation of NEFA enhanced rather than reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion. Thus, the capacity of the β cells to respond to increased insulin resistance with stimulation of insulin secretion may be genetically determined.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

The past 25 years have seen remarkable progress in the understanding of the processes underlying insulin secretion and their regulation under physiological as well as pathophysiological conditions. Recent breakthroughs include the identification of mutations in the genes encoding the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels that result in neonatal diabetes and the realization that some of these patients can be treated by sulfonylureas (128). However, these cases represent only a very small fraction of diabetes (1 in 200,000 live births). The next challenges are to explain the defects that cause and are associated with T2DM and to dissect how genetics, age, and lifestyle factors precipitate T2DM. T2DM is a bihormonal disorder that involves both insufficient insulin secretion and oversecretion of the hyperglycemic hormone glucagon (129). The role of glucagon in diabetes is illustrated by the recent report that normoglycemia is maintained in mice even after streptozotoxin-induced destruction of the insulin-producing β cells in mice lacking functional glucagon receptors (130). Intriguingly, the ion channel complement of the human glucagon-secreting α cell is very similar to that of the β cell (29). The precise mechanism by which glucose regulates glucagon secretion remains debated, but a current hypothesis suggests that the inhibition of α-cell K<sub>ATP</sub> channels may represent a critical event linking an elevation of plasma glucose to the suppression of glucagon secretion (131). Accordingly, any cellular defect(s) culminating in increased K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity (like reduced mitochondrial ATP production) can be predicted to result in reduced insulin secretion and in stimulated glucagon secretion (echoing the clinical picture). Therefore, elucidation of the causes of T2DM will require more than a detailed knowledge about the human β cell with regard to gene expression, protein complements, metabolism, and paracrine regulation; performing such studies on human α cells will be equally important.

SUMMARY POINTS

1. Human and murine β cells exhibit several and functionally important differences with regard to ion channel and enzyme complements involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion.
2. The human insulin-producing β cell is electrically excitable and generates action potentials in the presence of insulin-releasing concentrations of glucose and other stimuli.
3. Action potential firing in human β cells is secondary to closure of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and involves activation of several voltage-dependent ion channels that contribute to the depolarizing phase (T-, L-, and P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Na<sup>+</sup> channels) and the repolarizing phase (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated large-conductance K<sup>+</sup> channels) of action potentials.
4. Electrical activity in the β cell culminates in an elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis. Additionally, glucose exerts an amplifying effect that increases the capacity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to elicit exocytosis.
5. Insulin secretion is regulated by inhibitory and stimulatory neuronal and hormonal signals that regulate the β cell by modulating electrical activity and/or exocytosis.
6. T2DM results from the interaction between genes and the environment; the environment accounts for >80% of diabetes risk in genetically susceptible individuals.
