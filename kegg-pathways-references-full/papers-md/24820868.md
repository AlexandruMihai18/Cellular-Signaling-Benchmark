Natriuretic peptides in cardiometabolic regulation and disease

**Nora E. Zois, Emil D. Bartels, Ingrid Hunter, Birgitte S. Kousholt, Lisbeth H. Olsen and Jens P. Goetze**

Abstract | In the 30 years since the identification of the natriuretic peptides, their involvement in regulating fluid and blood pressure has become firmly established. Data indicating a role for these hormones in lifestyle-related metabolic and cardiovascular disorders have also accumulated over the past decade. Dysregulation of the natriuretic peptide system has been associated with obesity, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and essential hypertension. Moreover, the natriuretic peptides have been implicated in the protection against atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and myocardial ischaemia. All these conditions can coexist and potentially lead to heart failure, a syndrome associated with a functional natriuretic peptide deficiency despite high circulating concentrations of immunoreactive peptides. Therefore, dysregulation of the natriuretic peptide system, a ‘natriuretic handicap’, might be an important factor in the initiation and progression of metabolic dysfunction and its accompanying cardiovascular complications. This Review provides a summary of the natriuretic peptide system and its involvement in these cardiometabolic conditions. We propose that these peptides might have an integrating role in lifestyle-related metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.

## Introduction

The discovery of the diuretic hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in 1981 introduced the concept of the heart as an endocrine organ, regulating blood pressure and volume homeostasis in the body.¹ With the subsequent discovery of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in 1989² and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in 1990,³ a family of hormones was established and the era of basic and clinical research on the natriuretic peptides began. Initially, ANP and BNP were classified as hormonal regulators of salt and water balance by inducing natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and increased vascular permeability.⁴⁻⁶ Similarly, CNP was first recognized as an important factor in the control of blood pressure and intravascular volume.⁷⁻⁹ Subsequent studies have, however, shown that the natriuretic peptides affect a broader range of physiological systems than initially realized.

Both ANP and BNP are expressed and stored in granules of the atrial myocytes in mammalian hearts.¹⁰⁻¹² The peptides are released into the bloodstream upon distension of the atria and by neurohumoral stimulation.¹³⁻¹⁵ Whereas ANP is mainly secreted in its mature form (ANP₁₋₂₈), BNP is also released as a prohormone, proBNP₁₋₁₀₈. Upon secretion, proBNP₁₋₁₀₈ is enzymatically cleaved by corin (also known as ANP-converting enzyme) or furin into mature BNP (BNP₁₋₃₂) and the N-terminal proBNP₁₋₇₆ fragment (NT-proBNP).¹⁴⁻¹⁶ By contrast, no convincing data exist on CNP expression in cardiomyocytes.¹⁷ Instead, CNP expression is mainly found in vascular endothelial cells,¹⁸ neurons,¹⁹ and Leydig cells in the testicles.²⁰ The precursor proCNP₁₋₁₀₃ is cleaved by furin into CNP₁₋₅₃ and processed further, by an unidentified protease, into CNP₁₋₂₂, which is the main peptide form in circulating blood.²¹,²²

The natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR)-A, NPR-B, and NPR-C, which mediate the effects of these hormones, have a much broader distribution than just the vasculature and kidneys, being present in the adipose tissue,²³,²⁴ liver,²⁴ pancreas,²⁵ and brain.²⁶ Both the NPR-A and NPR-B are guanylyl cyclases, which catalyse the conversion of intracellular guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).²⁷,²⁸ The NPR-C lacks such activity, and was initially considered to be a clearance receptor only.²⁹ However, studies have subsequently revealed that the NPR-C mediates intracellular effects through inhibitory G-proteins and subsequent inhibition of adenyl cyclase and activation of phospholipase C (Figure 1).³⁰⁻³² Whereas the NPR-A preferentially binds ANP and BNP, the NPR-B binds CNP with the highest affinity.³³ All natriuretic peptides bind to the NPR-C, which is not only the most-abundantly expressed but also the most-widely distributed NPR, found in diverse cell types such as cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts,³⁴ vascular smooth muscle cells,³⁵ pancreatic α-cells,³⁶ platelets,³⁷ gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells,³⁸ neurons,³⁹ and chondrocytes.⁴⁰

The broad distribution of the NPRs is indicative of the wide range of biological effects of the natriuretic peptides. Studies performed in the past 25 years support such biological effects of ANP, BNP, and CNP beyond control of blood pressure and volume homeostasis (Table 1). Several of these effects are associated with lifestyle-related

Figure 1 | The natriuretic peptides exert their effects through transmembrane receptors: NPR-A, NPR-B, and NPR-C. NPR-A and NPR-B are guanylyl cyclases, which catalyse the synthesis of cGMP from GTP. In vascular and cardiac cells, the intracellular effects of these receptors are mediated through PKG phosphorylating downstream targets such as PLN, which is an important regulator of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations by mediating Ca²⁺ sequestration in the endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic reticulum and downregulation of the L-type Ca²⁺ channels located in the cell membrane. The NPR-C lacks guanylyl cyclase activity; instead, receptor activation is coupled to inhibition of AC or activation of PLC. Moreover, indirect cGMP signalling downstream from NPR-C occurs through activation of eNOS.

presence of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and diabetes.$^{54,55}$ In addition, genetic data indicate a link between expression of the human gene encoding BNP (NPPB) and the risk of type 2 diabetes in the general population.$^{56}$ In population samples, natriuretic peptide concentrations have been shown to be inversely associated with total cholesterol and triglycerides in serum, as well as glucose and insulin in plasma.$^{54}$ These findings are corroborated by a Swedish study reporting that a low plasma ANP concentration predicted onset of diabetes as well as impaired glucose tolerance over time, independently of clinical risk factors during 16 years of follow-up.$^{57}$

glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity are worth noting, because GLP-1 signalling has been shown to induce brown fat thermogenesis<sup>69</sup> and promote secretion of atrial ANP<sup>70</sup> in mice.

### Hypertension

The important role of the natriuretic peptides in the regulation of blood pressure has been demonstrated in animal models. Transgenic mice overexpressing ANP or BNP exhibit hypotension compared with wild-type littermates,<sup>71,72</sup> whereas mice with functional disruptions in ANP and the NPR-A have elevated blood pressure.<sup>73–75</sup> The involvement of NPR-A signalling and subsequent cGMP production in the regulation of blood pressures has been corroborated by a study that showed increases in guanylyl cyclase activity and blood pressure in direct proportion to the number of genes encoding the NPR-A (*Npr1*; ranging from one to four copies) in transgenic mice.<sup>76</sup>

The natriuretic peptides might serve as a therapeutic target in hypertension; this hypothesis is supported by studies in rats and in a patient with uncontrolled hypertension.<sup>77,78</sup> A potential protective effect of the natriuretic peptides against hypertension is supported by population-based studies showing that genetically determined increased circulating concentrations of ANP and BNP are associated with lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of hypertension than genetic variants exhibiting lower peptide concentrations.<sup>79,80</sup> Interestingly, these findings have been corroborated by the identification of a specific microRNA that regulates cardiac ANP expression in individuals with a genetically increased risk of hypertension.<sup>81</sup> Although an increased circulating concentration of BNP is found in patients with advanced essential hypertension, prehypertension seems to be associated with a relative deficiency in mature, bioactive BNP<sub>1–32</sub>.<sup>82,83</sup> A lack of activation of the BNP system has been reported in patients with stage 1 hypertension compared with control individuals who have normal blood pressure.<sup>82</sup> These findings were substantiated by a report of reduced concentrations of NT-proBNP and mature BNP<sub>1–32</sub> in individuals with prehypertension, indicating impaired BNP synthesis.<sup>83</sup> Importantly, a low BNP level was not accompanied by compensatory activation of the ANP system.<sup>84</sup> In addition, patients with obesity and hypertension have been reported to have low circulating concentrations of ANP and BNP compared with lean individuals with normal blood pressure.<sup>85</sup> Seemingly, the concentrations of ANP and BNP were inappropriately low for the degree of hypertension, suggesting inadequate suppression of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in obese individuals owing to a relative deficiency of natriuretic peptides.<sup>85,86</sup>

Altered processing of natriuretic prohormones might also be of importance in the regulation of blood pressure. The presence of two missense mutations in the gene encoding atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme (CORIN), which cleaves the prohormones to their mature counterparts, is associated with hypertension.<sup>84</sup> Moreover, mice deficient in this enzyme have been shown

**Figure 2** | Within adipocytes, adrenergic stimulation through the β-AR stimulates lipolysis as well as a phenotypic change into a brown-like adipocyte with increased thermogenic capacity. These effects are mediated by cAMP-dependent activation of PKA and subsequent HSL phosphorylation. Similar effects have been described for the natriuretic peptides through an alternative pathway involving PKG activation. By binding to the NPR-A, PKG is activated through cGMP synthesis from GTP. In turn, PKG phosphorylates HSL and induces the breakdown of triglycerides to FFAs. Moreover, PKA and PKG phosphorylate p38 MAPK, which in turn increases the transcription of UCP-1 and other thermogenic genes, and induces mitochondrial biogenesis whereby heat generation is promoted.

suggested. Interestingly, treatment of human white adipocytes both with ANP and with BNP, independently, has been shown to lead to the induction of functional phenotype characteristics of brown adipocytes, a so-called browning of fat, which increases the capacity for thermogenic energy expenditure.<sup>64</sup> These effects were mediated by mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1, and dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; Figure 2).<sup>64</sup> Similarly, *in vivo* administration of BNP to mice led to a corresponding browning of white fat and activation of pre-existing brown fat.<sup>64</sup> This finding is intriguing, because transplantation of brown fat in mice has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity, improve glucose tolerance, and reduce body weight.<sup>65</sup> The presence of metabolically active brown fat tissue in adult humans has been documented,<sup>66,67</sup> and glucose uptake mediated by insulin and cold temperatures in brown fat are blunted in obese individuals.<sup>68</sup> The physiological importance of brown fat and browning of white fat in humans needs further elucidation, as does the role of the natriuretic peptides in this process. In this regard, the blood-glucose-lowering and weight-reducing effects of
to spontaneously develop hypertension.⁸⁷ The magnitude or rate of clearance of the natriuretic peptides through the NPR-C might also be important in the development of hypertension, as indicated by the low blood pressure in NPR-C knock-out mice.⁸⁸ Involvement of the NPR-C in the pathogenesis of hypertension is also supported by a study showing that the locus encoding this receptor was associated with increased blood pressure in a European population.⁸⁹

### Atherosclerosis and thrombosis

Secretion of the natriuretic peptides into the blood, and expression of their receptors in the vascular wall and circulating blood cells, offer unique opportunities to regulate the delicate haemostatic and inflammatory balance of the vascular bed, which is disturbed in atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Activation of the endothelial lining, leading to leucocyte recruitment and proliferation, as well as migration and proliferation of smooth vascular cells, are considered important elements in the formation of an atherosclerotic lesion. Several lines of evidence support a role for the natriuretic peptides in each of these elements of the atherogenic process.

In cultured endothelial cells, ANP and CNP have been shown to reduce expression of adhesion molecules such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (also known as C-C motif chemokine 2) and P-selectin,³¹,⁹⁰ both of which are considered pivotal for the activation of endothelial cells and the subsequent infiltration of leucocytes.⁹¹ This suppressive effect on leucocyte–endothelial cell interaction has been confirmed *in vivo* by CNP infusions in a mouse model of high basal leucocyte activation.³¹

Inhibitory effects on proliferation and migration of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells have also been reported.⁹²⁻⁹⁴ Compared with ANP and BNP, CNP has a more-potent inhibitory effect on migration and has been shown to inhibit the migration of coronary vascular smooth muscle cells in response to oxidized LDL particles in a concentration-dependent manner.⁹³,⁹⁵ In several animal models of vascular injury and atherosclerosis, CNP-induced inhibition of intimal thickening resulting from smooth muscle cell migration have been reported.⁹⁶⁻⁹⁹

Activated platelets have a role in the atherogenic process by recruiting leucocytes through the formation of platelet–leucocyte aggregates and by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In concert with the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, activated platelets are also involved in thrombosis and in the thromboembolic complications observed in atherosclerosis. *In vitro*, CNP has been shown to reduce expression of platelet P-selectin, reduce platelet–leucocyte interactions, and suppress thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.³¹ Furthermore, treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells¹⁰⁰ and endothelial cells¹⁰¹ with CNP reduced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which is the major physiological inhibitor of fibrinolysis *in vivo*. Intraluminal infusions with CNP reduced the expression of PAI-1 in the carotid arteries of a rabbit model of intimal hyperplasia.¹⁰² In rabbits with balloon-injured carotid arteries, adenovirus-mediated local expression of

CNP significantly reduced recurrent thrombus formation and dislodgement, indicating that CNP also has a protective role in thrombosis that is not associated with atherosclerosis.¹⁰³ This putative protective effect requires closer examination, because few studies of the natriuretic peptide-induced effects on platelet activation and reactivity *in vitro* have been conducted and the results are discordant.³¹,¹⁰⁴⁻¹⁰⁶ Use of different platelet-aggregating agents among studies could partly explain the conflicting findings; nonetheless, the mechanism behind the platelet response to the effects of natriuretic peptides needs further investigation.

The NPR identified so far on platelets belongs to the NPR-C type, which mediates the activation of phospholipase C and inhibition of adenylate cyclase (Figure 1).³⁷,¹⁰⁷ Phospholipase C is known to augment platelet aggregation, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is dephosphorylated at low intracellular levels of cAMP, which in turn also augments platelet aggregation.¹⁰⁸,¹⁰⁹ In platelets, VASP phosphorylation at serine 239 induced by BNP and a NPR-C agonist has been reported.¹⁰⁶ Intriguingly, VASP phosphorylation at this specific serine residue is carried out preferentially by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (also known as protein kinase G; PKG).¹¹⁰,¹¹¹ Indirect cGMP–PKG signalling through nitric oxide (NO) generation has been shown downstream from NPR-C¹¹²,¹¹³ (Figure 1). This finding might help to explain potential VASP phosphorylation and, therefore, the inhibitory effect on platelets elicited through NPR-C.

The mechanism behind the effects exerted by CNP on leucocytes and smooth muscle cells also needs to be elucidated, because both CNP–NPR-C signalling³¹ and cGMP-dependent pathways have been suggested.⁹²,⁹³ A cGMP-dependent mechanism is supported by a study in which mice devoid of both apolipoprotein E and NPR-A exhibited increased blood pressure and increased size and complexity of atherosclerotic lesions compared with apolipoprotein E knock-out mice with conserved NPR-A signalling.¹¹⁴

The major body of evidence from *in vitro* studies and animal models, therefore, indicates protective effects mediated by the natriuretic peptides in diseases characterized by disturbances of vascular inflammatory and haemostatic homeostasis. In this context, CNP is the most-widely investigated of the natriuretic peptides, and has been implicated in the endogenous protection against atherosclerosis and thrombosis. In human coronary arteries harvested at autopsy, reduced endothelial CNP expression in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells was found in advanced atherosclerotic lesions compared with normal endothelium.¹¹⁵ In addition, inverse associations between circulating concentrations of N-terminal pro-CNP, carotid intima–media thickness, and aortic pulse wave velocity have been established in a population of clinically healthy men with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease.¹¹⁶ Interestingly, CNP secretion from cultured endothelial cells was inhibited by insulin, lending support to the presence of a natriuretic peptide-associated link between metabolic dysregulation, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis.¹¹⁷

Myocardial infarction
Initially, great emphasis was placed on the diuretic, natriuretic, and vasodilatory properties of the natriuretic peptides, by which they counteract the volume overload that accompanies a failing left ventricle. However, evidence is accumulating that the natriuretic peptides also have a protective role within the myocardium. Such paracrine or autocrine effects are supported by the expression of NPRs in cardiac tissue,³⁴ as well as upregulated expression and release of natriuretic peptides in response to myocardial stretch and insults to the myocardium, such as hypoxia.¹¹⁸–¹²⁰

Studies *in vitro* and of genetic disruptions in the genes encoding murine ANP (*Nppa*), BNP (*Nppb*), and NRP-A (*Nrp1*) have confirmed the involvement of ANP and BNP in the cardiac remodelling processes and, specifically, in protection against excessive remodelling.⁷³,⁷⁴,¹²¹ CNP is also thought to have local cardioprotective effects, because transgenic rats with partial deficiency in NPR-B exhibited progressive cardiac hypertrophy,¹²² whereas overexpression of CNP reduced hypertrophy in a murine model of myocardial infarction.¹²³ Antifibrotic effects have been demonstrated with *in vitro* and *in vivo* administration of CNP and the chimeric analogue CD-NP (created by fusion of CNP and D-type natriuretic peptide, which was identified in the eastern green mamba [*Dendroaspis angusticeps*]).¹²⁴–¹²⁶ Of note, the antifibrotic effect was superior to that of ANP and BNP in cultured cardiac fibroblasts, an observation that might be explained by the relative abundance of NPR-B over NPR-A in this cell type.¹²⁵

Additional evidence of local protective effects against hypoxic and reperfusion damage has been provided in experimental and clinical settings. In the Langendorff preparation of rat hearts, BNP infusion during ischaemia and early reperfusion limited infarct size in a concentration-dependent manner.¹²⁷,¹²⁸ In parallel, BNP infusion during early reperfusion in a porcine model of acute myocardial infarction decreased cardiomyocyte damage *in vivo*.¹²⁹ A similar effect has been shown for ANP, CNP, and CD-NP in isolated hearts as well as in blood-perfused hearts *in vivo*.¹²⁶,¹²⁹–¹³³

Promising results in clinical settings have also started to emerge. In the J-WIND-ANP study,¹³⁴ the effect of recombinant ANP (carperitide) was evaluated in patients with acute myocardial infarction. A decrease of nearly 15% in infarct size was reported in patients treated with carperitide for 3 days compared with those who received placebo.¹³⁴ Low-dose administration of recombinant BNP (nesiritide) improved cardiac performance 1 month after myocardial infarction in the BELIEVE pilot study.¹³⁵ A corresponding large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled study (BELIEVE II)¹³⁶ is currently underway, as are clinical trials on the effects of chimeric CNP.¹³⁷

The locally mediated cardioprotective effects of the natriuretic peptides have been linked to intracellular accumulation of cGMP and subsequent cGMP-PKG signalling¹²⁷,¹²⁸,¹³¹,¹³⁸ implicated in the balance between cellular apoptosis and survival.¹³⁹ Activation of the cGMP-PKG pathway occurs directly through NPR-A and NPR-B signalling, but also indirectly through NO-activated guanylyl cyclases.¹³⁹ The infarct-limiting effects of ANP and BNP have been shown to be halted by co-perfusion with NO-synthase inhibitors,¹²⁷,¹³⁰,¹⁴⁰ indicating that the protective action is NO-dependent. Interestingly, indirect cGMP-PKG signalling through NO generation occurs downstream from NPR-C activation,¹¹²,¹¹³,¹⁴¹ which renders this receptor a potential candidate for mediating the observed effects. The finding that the infarct-sparing effect in perfused hearts ceases with the addition of a selective NPR-C antagonist supports this hypothesis.¹³³ Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism, including identification of the downstream target of PKG within the cardiomyocytes, as well as the role of other factors, such as regulation of coronary blood flow¹²² and attenuation of the polymorph neutrophil activation evoked by hypoxia.¹⁴³

### Conclusions
Since the discovery of the natriuretic peptides, the haemodynamic and renal effects of these hormones have been the subject of intense investigation, including research to identify their biological effects beyond pressure-volume homeostasis. Data implicating dysregulation of the natriuretic peptide system in metabolic dysfunction and its cardiovascular complications are accumulating. The presence of a ‘natriuretic handicap’ has even been suggested as a putative explanation for the frequent clustering of obesity, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome;⁵⁴,⁸⁵ a concept we here extend to include atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and myocardial infarction.

The natriuretic peptides have been implicated in the control of metabolism by reducing blood glucose and insulin levels as well as by inducing lipolysis and thermogenesis.⁴⁹,⁵¹,⁶⁴ The presence of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes have all been associated with low circulating natriuretic peptide concentrations in population-based studies.⁵⁴,⁵⁷,⁸⁵ Moreover, genetically determined low circulating levels of ANP and BNP have been associated with an increased risk of hypertension.⁷⁹,⁸⁰ Whether the natriuretic peptide system is dysregulated in atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and myocardial ischaemia can only be speculated upon. Natriuretic peptide-induced cGMP accumulation and subsequent cGMP-PKG signalling in cardiomyocytes have, however, been established to be pivotal for attenuation of the irreversible injury associated with ischaemia and reperfusion. The protective effects exerted by the natriuretic peptides in these settings are intriguing, as is the knowledge that metabolic dysfunction, hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and myocardial ischaemia all increase an individual’s propensity to develop heart failure,¹⁴⁴ a disease state similarly associated with a dysfunctional natriuretic peptide system.¹⁴⁵–¹⁴⁷

The era of the natriuretic peptides is far from over, and we foresee a more-integrated view of these hormones in lifestyle-related metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Many questions are still to be addressed. Most importantly, the factors triggering a natriuretic deficiency, or ‘handicap’, still need to be elucidated. Several candidates, including genetically determined low circulating peptide concentrations, inappropriately low peptide synthesis, and

impaired processing of propeptide forms into mature bio-
active peptide exist, but no single reason for the relative
deficiency of natriuretic peptide in metabolic dysfunc-
tion has been identified. Food intake and high fasting
insulin levels have been shown to be inversely related to
natriuretic peptide concentrations, 54,55,58 suggesting that
hyperinsulinaemia might be a central initiating factor.
Conversely, obesity might also be the consequence of low
circulating natriuretic peptide concentrations through
reduced thermogenic energy expenditure, 64 and increa-
sed hunger owing to lack of ghrelin (also known as
appetite-regulating hormone) inhibition. 61 Furthermore,
population-based studies of natriuretic peptide profiles
and prevalence of cardiovascular complications to meta-
bolic dysfunction would help to elucidate the integrating
role of low circulating natriuretic peptide concentrations
in these settings. In perspective, the natriuretic peptides
might be a potential pharmacological target to pursue
for the prevention of metabolic dysfunction *per se*, and
also to reduce the risk of accompanying atherosclerosis,

hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Already, the
prospect of decreased platelet aggregation *in vivo* would
go ‘hand in hand’ with the therapeutic use in myocardial
ischaemia and infarction.
