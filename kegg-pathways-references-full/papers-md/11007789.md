Roper et al; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

**Summary**

The ability of *Porphyromonas gingivalis* to biosynthesize tetrapyrroles *de novo* has been investigated. Extracts of the bacterium do not possess activity for 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase or porphobilinogen deaminase, two key enzymes involved in the synthesis of uroporphyrinogen III. Similarly, it was not possible to detect any genetic evidence for these early enzymes with the use of degenerate PCR. However, the bacterium did appear to harbor some of the enzymes for cobalamin biosynthesis since cobyric acid, a pathway intermediate, was converted into cobinamide. Furthermore, degenerate PCR with primers designed to *cbiP*, which encodes cobyric acid synthase, produced a fragment with a high degree of identity to the *S. typhimurium cbiP*. Indeed, the recently released genome sequence data confirmed the presence of *cbiP* together with 14 other genes of the cobalamin pathway. A number of these genes were cloned and functionally characterized.

Whilst *P. gingivalis* harbors all the genes necessary to convert precorrin-2 into cobalamin, it is missing the genes for the synthesis of precorrin-2. Either the organism has a novel pathway for the synthesis of precorrin-2 or, more likely, it has lost this early part of the pathway. The remainder of the pathway may be being maintained to act as a salvage route for corrin synthesis.

**Key words:** cobalamin, vitamin B₁₂, precorrin, *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, tetrapyrrole.

# Introduction

Anaerobic bacteria constitute almost 95% of the indigenous flora of the alimentary tract. Among these organisms several opportunistic pathogens have been described, which are mainly Gram-negative anaerobic rods of the family Bacteroidaceae (1). These bacteria are also associated with the colonizing flora of the oral cavity, and are quite similar in terms of their physiological properties, requirement for heme and utilization of mainly amino acids and peptides as energy sources. Furthermore, disease caused by infection of anaerobic bacteria is an area of growing concern although little is known about the fundamental biology of many of these organisms (2). Periodontal diseases result in gum tissue destruction and in some cases the spread of the infective anaerobic flora into the blood, which can cause soft tissue infections in the pulmonary tract, brain abscesses and heart disease (3).

*Porphyromonas gingivalis*, one of the main causes of such infections, is an obligate anaerobe whose colonies are recognized by their characteristic heme pigments on blood agar plates (1). Heme is central to metabolism in nearly all organisms, especially in its role as a prosthetic group involved in electron transport. Its synthesis occurs via a branched biosynthetic pathway, which is also responsible for the synthesis of other modified tetrapyrroles including cobalamin (vitamin B₁₂) (Figure 1) (4). *P. gingivalis* exhibits an absolute growth requirement for heme *in vitro* (5) although it is not known whether this exogenous heme is used to complement an inability of the organism to make its own heme or whether, for instance, the exogenous heme is being used as a source of iron. Similarly, recent evidence also indicates that *P. gingivalis* requires adenosylcobalamin as a prosthetic group (6) but again it is not known whether the bacterium is able to make its own cobalamin. The biologically active forms of vitamin B₁₂, methyl and adenosylcobalamin, are required in methylation and

Roper et al; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

rearrangement reactions respectively (7). The biosynthesis of cobalamin represents one of the most complex pathways in Nature, involving somewhere around thirty enzyme-catalyzed reactions. These include the genes encoding enzymes responsible for the synthesis of uroporphyrinogen III, the first macrocyclic intermediate in tetrapyrrole synthesis, the genes encoding enzymes for the transformation of uroporphyrinogen III into cobinamide and the genes encoding enzymes for nucleotide loop assembly and attachment to the corrin ring (8-11). The steps required for the synthesis of cobalamin are highlighted in figure 2.

Studies over the past decade have demonstrated that there are at least two quite distinct routes for cobalamin synthesis, representing oxygen-dependent (aerobic) and oxygen-independent (anaerobic) pathways (12-13). For the biosynthesis of cobinamide, the genes of the oxygen-dependent route are prefixed *cob* whilst the genes for the oxygen-independent pathway are prefixed *cbi* (Figure 2)¹. The major differences between the two pathways relate to the requirement for molecular oxygen and the timing of cobalt insertion: in the oxygen-dependent pathway molecular oxygen is required to assist in the ring contraction process and cobalt is added relatively late on in the pathway, only after the synthesis of hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide whilst in the oxygen-independent pathway molecular oxygen is not required and cobalt is inserted into the macrocycle at an early stage of the synthesis, at the level of precorrin-2 (Figure 2).

In this paper, investigations into the ability of *P. gingivalis* to make tetrapyrroles, and in particular cobalamin, are reported. Although the organism appears to contain a functional oxygen-independent corrin biosynthetic pathway, which is able to transform precorrin-2 into cobalamin, the presence of the pathway is compounded by the lack of any enzymes for the synthesis of precorrin-2.

**Experimental procedures.**

Horse blood was bought from Difco (Detroit, Michigan, USA), and other media components were purchased from Oxoid (Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK). The RapID ANA II diagnostic system was from Innovative Diagnostic systems (Norcross, GA, USA). Perchloric acid was purchased from Aldrich Chemicals (Gillingham, Dorset, UK) while other chemicals were from Sigma chemicals (Poole, Dorset, UK). All general nucleic acid protocols were carried out as described in (14). Protein was quantitated according to the Bradford procedure (15). Cobyric acid was synthesized as described by Bonnett et al. (16).

**Bacterial Growth**

All strains and plasmids are shown in Table 1. The bacterial species *Porphyromonas gingivalis* W83, W50, PgM3, PgM4, Hg405, Hg1241 Hg189, *P. endodontalis* Hg189 and *Prevotella loescheii* NCTC 11321 were used in the present study. Cells were routinely grown on columbia blood agar² (CBA) plates (40 g columbia blood agar powder/1L, 5% v/v Horse blood) or fastidious anaerobe agar (FAA) in gas jars under anaerobic conditions (Anaerogen, Oxoid) at 37°C for 48 h. Broth cultures of *Porphyromonas* species [Nutrient Broth or Defined Medium (17) supplemented with 8 mM hemin plus 3 mM menadione] were inoculated with plate-grown cells and incubated anaerobically for 48 hrs. Cells were harvested either by scraping the colonies off the agar or centrifugation at 5,000 g for 15 min.

**Genomic DNA preparations.**

Genomic DNA was prepared according to standard procedures (14) except that excess proteinase K and RNAse were added during the lysozyme treatment stage since many of these bacteria produce a high concentration of nuclease.

# 5-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) assay

Harvested cells were washed twice in degassed assay buffer, 50 mM 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid (CHES), pH 8.5, containing 10 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl₂ and 100 mM ZnCl₂. Washed cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were disrupted in a Mickle high speed vibratory tissue disintegrator (Mickle Laboratory Engineering C. Ltd., Guilford, Surrey, UK). Samples were vibrated with 1 volume Ballotini No. 10 glass beads for 12 min at 4°C. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 4,000 g for 5 min at 4°C and the clarified supernatant removed. The beads were washed 5 times in 1 ml of assay buffer, recentrifuged and the washings were combined with the crude homogenate sample.

ALAD activity was determined by the amount of porphobilinogen (PBG) formed using a stopped spectrophotometric assay. The method was essentially as described previously (18) except that 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (5 mM final concentration) was preincubated for 2 min in assay buffer at 37°C and the reaction started by the addition of bacterial extracts (up to 2 mg protein), to give a final volume of 0.5 ml.

# Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) assay

PBGD activity was measured according to the method described by Jordan et al (19). Briefly, crude cell extract (500 μl) was incubated at 37°C in a final volume of 800 μl, containing 100 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 μmoles of porphobilinogen (PBG). The reaction was stopped after either 30 or 60 min by the addition of 0.2 ml of 5 N HCL. Ten microlitres of freshly prepared benzoquinone (1 mg/ml) was added to the solution. The mixture was centrifuged and after 15 min the solution was measured at 405

nm to quantify the amount of uroporphyrin formed, using an extinction coefficient of 5.48 x $10^5 \text{M}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-1}$.

### CbiK assay

The activity of the long and short version of CbiK, CbiK<sup>L</sup> and CbiK<sup>S</sup> respectively, was determined using an *in vitro* linked assay, similar to that described in (20). The incubation contained 1 mg of recombinant *Pseudomonas denitrificans* uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase (CobA), 0.1 mg of *E. coli* PBGD, 0.15 mg of *E. coli* uroporphyrinogen III synthase, 0.75 mg S-adenosyl-L-methionine and 0.1 mg PBG. The assay components were mixed in 1 ml of degassed 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. To this assay were added 0.1 mg of CbiK and CoCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (40 μM) as required. Spectra were recorded using a Hewlett Packard 352 photodiode array spectrophotometer over the range 300-700 nm.

### Cobalamin Bioassay

Cobalamin concentrations were determined using a modified bioassay. Bioassay plates were prepared as described previously (21) with two different indicator strains (*S. typhimurium metE cysG*, AR3612 or *S. typhimurium cbiB metE*, AR2680). AR2680 requires cobinamide or later intermediates for restoration of growth whereas AR3612 can grow in the presence of the earlier intermediate cobyric acid. This metabolic difference provided a means of determining if exogenously provided cobyric acid was being taken up and converted into cobinamide by the bacteria under investigation.

Where possible bacteria that were to be tested for the presence of cobalamin were grown in defined medium (17). However, not all strains were amenable to growth in defined medium and had to be grown on columbia blood agar plates. In this case the background level of

Roper et al.; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

cobalamins available from the media had to be taken into account and the results were based on the conversion of exogenously added cobyric acid (100 nmol/plate or 1000 nmol/plate) to cobinamide.

### PCR

Whole genomic DNA from *P. gingivalis* W83 was used as a template for initial isolation of porphinoïd genes by PCR. Degenerate PCR was used to amplify a partial gene sequence of ~365 bp encoding a fragment of *cbiP*. Degenerate PCR primers were designed from a highly conserved region of *cbiP* from known bacterial sequences (between amino acids 59 and 174 of *S. typhimurium cbiP*), using CODEHOP (consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for amplification of distantly-related sequences) (22). Degenerate primers to two other genes, *hemB* (encoding ALAD) and *btuR* (encoding the adenosyl transferase) were also designed (Table 2) but although these worked on control samples of DNA (*S. typhimurium* genomic DNA) they failed to amplify a product with genomic DNA from *P. gingivalis*. Primers designed to known DNA sequence were used to isolate *cbiGF*, *cbiJD*, *cbiL* and *cbiK* (Table 2).

Reactions were carried out in 50 μl containing NH₄ buffer, 1.5–4 mM MgCl₂, 40 mM of each deoxynucleotide, 0.5 mg genomic DNA and 50 pmol each primer. Conditions were 1 cycle at 95°C for 3 min for denaturation and hot start with Taq Polymerase (BioTaq), 35 cycles at 95°C for 20 sec, 45°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 45 sec, followed by 1 cycle at 72°C for 5 min.

PCR products of the expected size were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted (Qiagen) and cloned into pGem-T Easy (Promega, Madison, USA). The subsequent plasmids were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Inc., 373 DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, California, USA) to confirm the identities and sequence of the isolated genes.

Subcloning the *cbi* genes for expression studies

Cloning procedures were performed as described in (14). The isolated cobalamin biosynthetic genes from *P. gingivalis* including *cbiL*, *cbiK*, *cbiGF* and *cbiJD* were separately cloned into pKK223-3 under the regulation of a tac promoter by directional cloning. A second set of plasmids were also constructed whereby each gene or gene fusion was cloned into pET14b behind a His-tag encoding sequence, under the control of a T7 promoter.

The pKK constructs were used to carry out functional complementation tests on either defined *S. typhimurium* or recombinant *E. coli* cobalamin mutants. The pET constructs were used for expression of protein for affinity purification by metal chelate chromatography. The plasmids and strains are described in Table 1.

### Purification of His-tagged proteins.

The protein was expressed and purified as described in the pET manual (Novagen). Briefly, a culture of the appropriate strain was grown in LB containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol at $37^\circ$C until an $\text{OD}_{600} = 0.6$ was reached. At this stage IPTG was added to a final concentration of $0.4 \, \text{mM}$ and the cells were grown for a further 2 hours before harvesting by centrifugation ($10,000 \times g$, $4^\circ$C). The bacterial pellet was resuspended in binding buffer ($5 \, \text{mM}$ imidazole, $0.5 \, \text{M NaCl}$, $20 \, \text{mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9}$) and sonicated at 8 microns for $4 \times 30$ sec bursts using a MSE soniprep ultrasonicator. The solution was centrifuged again ($10,000 \times g$, $4^\circ$C) and the supernatant was loaded onto a charged His-bind column ($1 \, \text{cm} \times 2.5 \, \text{cm}$). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of binding buffer, 6 column volumes of wash buffer ($100 \, \text{mM}$ imidazole, $0.5 \, \text{M NaCl}$, $20 \, \text{mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9}$), and finally the protein was eluted in 6 column volumes of elution buffer ($400 \, \text{mM}$ imidazole, $0.5 \, \text{M NaCl}$, $20 \, \text{mM Tris}$-

HCl pH 7.9). Protein was detected by the Biorad protein assay and SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the His-tagged protein were pooled and desalted by passing through a PD10 column which had been previously equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8.

### Databases & Computer Programs

Sequences, alignments and comparisons were performed with the GCG Wisconsin Package.

Searches of the Unfinished Bacterial Genome Database were performed using the Blast suite (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/unfinshedgenome.html). Evolutionary trees were constructed using PAUP 4.0.

Results.

Since the gene for methylmalonyl CoA mutase, a B₁₂-dependent enzyme, had previously been isolated and sequenced from *P. gingivalis* (6), it was decided to investigate whether the bacterium was able to synthesize the coenzyme required for this reaction (adenosylcobalamin) *de novo*, by determining the presence of any cobalamin biosynthetic genes.

This was achieved using a degenerate PCR approach with primers designed to *btuR* (11), the cobalamin adenosylation enzyme, and *CbiP*, cobyric acid synthase (see Figure 2). Degenerate PCR with the *btuR* primers did not produce any DNA products of the correct size, although a negative result by this procedure does not mean the gene is absent since the process is reliant on a high degree of similarity with gene homologues. However, the lack of success with these primers may also be explained by the fact that not all bacteria capable of *de novo* cobalamin synthesis appear to harbor *btuR*, and must possess another, as yet unidentified, enzyme capable of adenosylation. Fortunately, degenerate PCR with the primers to *cbiP* produced a 350bp fragment of the expected size. Cloning and sequencing of this product revealed the fragment contained 54% sequence identity with *cbiP* from *S. typhimurium*. At this point in time the non-annotated data from the *P. gingivalis* sequencing project became available online (http://www.tigr.org). The *cbiP* sequence obtained from the degenerate PCR was found to match exactly that found in the *P. gingivalis* database. Furthermore, the full sequence of *cbiP* in the *P. gingivalis* database demonstrated clear similarity with *cbiP* from other organisms. A search of the *P. gingivalis* sequence database with other known corrin biosynthetic enzymes revealed the presence of 14 genes involved in the cobalamin pathway (*cbiL*, -H, -K, -C, -ET, -GF, -JD, -B, -P, -A, *cobD*, -S, -T, -U) (Figures 2 and 3). These 14 genes encode for enzymes that perform 17 different enzymatic transformations. The discrepancy between the number of genes and the number of enzymatic transformations is due to the fact that three of the genes

Roper et al.; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

encode for bifunctional proteins, where two separate genes would appear to have fused together (*cbiJD*, *cbiET* and *cbiGF*). Of the 14 genes, 11 appear to be clustered into 3 operons whilst the remaining three genes are dispersed randomly throughout the genome (Figure 3).

The identified genes appear to encode mainly for the enzymes that are responsible for the transformation of precorrin-2 into cobalamin (Figure 2). An alignment of the cobalamin biosynthetic methyltransferases found in the *P. gingivalis* genome (*CbiL*, -H, -J, -ET, -GF) with all other known cobalamin biosynthetic methyltransferases allowed a phylogenetic tree to be produced (data not shown) (23). Not surprisingly, the *P. gingivalis* methyltransferases segregated with enzymes associated with the oxygen-independent pathway. Indeed, three of the other cobalamin genes, *cbiD*, *cbiG* and *cbiK* can also be considered the genetic hallmarks of the anaerobic pathway, since they are only found in organisms that contain the oxygen-independent route (13).

Of significant interest was the absence of gene homologues that encode for any of the enzymes of precorrin-2 synthesis. Furthermore, degenerate primers to 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) failed to amplify any product and enzymatic assays on crude cell extracts from *P. givgivalis* for ALAD and porphobiligen deaminase (PBGD) failed to demonstrate any enzymatic activity. As for other modified tetrapyrrole synthesis, the only genes that were recorded in the genome were a few for heme synthesis including *hemN*, encoding an anaerobic coproporphyrinogen oxidase, and *hemH* which encodes the protoporphyrin ferrochelatase. Thus the *P. gingivalis* genome would appear to harbor all the *cbi* genes together with a few late heme biosynthetic genes, but none of the genes for the synthesis of ALA and its transformation into precorrin-2.

Roper et al.; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

Cloning and functional complementation.

Although the *P. gingivalis* cbi genes appear to contain the genetic hallmarks of the oxygen-independent corrin pathway, there were a number of gene fusions that had not been observed previously. For instance, *cbiJ* and *cbiD* appeared fused together as did *cbiG* and *cbiF*.

Moreover, *P. gingivalis* also appeared to harbor *cbiK*, a gene now known to encode the anaerobic cobalt chelatase (24, 25) and which has been detected in only four other organisms, *S. typhimurium*, *Clostridium difficile*, *Clostridium acetobutylicum* and *Clostridium tepidum*.

To evaluate the functionality of some of these genes, they were cloned and used in a series of complementation experiments (see below and Table 3).

The genes *cbiL*, *cbiJD*, *cbiK*, *cbiGF* and *cbiK* were amplified from *P. gingivalis* genomic DNA and cloned into pKK223-3 and were then used to complement either defined *S.* typhimurium, *E. coli* or recombinant *E. coli* cobalamin biosynthetic mutants. With *cbiK* there was a certain ambiguity with the size of the protein since the gene had two potential translation start codons, the first of which appeared to give the protein an 18-28 amino acid extension at the N-terminus in comparison to other CbiK proteins. A motif search in the PROSITE dictionary of protein sites and patterns indicated that this extension displays some of the features associated with signal peptides found on membrane lipoproteins (26).

Intriguingly, CbiK is the subject to two independent patent applications in Australia, with the authors citing CbiK as an immuno-reactive antigen³, supporting a theory that the protein is exported to the outer membrane. This is sustained by results detailing how CbiK is able to act as an outer membrane heme-binding protein that is important for the growth of *P. gingivalis* (27, 28). There is a suggestion that CbiK may be associated with a protective immune response against *P. gingivalis*-induced periodontitis (27).

Roper et al.; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

To test whether the *P. gingivalis* CbiK was active in the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway, cbiK was cloned such that it was expressed from the first methionine and was referred to as CbiK-long, CbiK<sup>L</sup>. Initially the cloned cbiK<sup>L</sup> was used to complement an *E. coli* cysG<sup>4</sup> mutant after the gene had been cloned in tandem with a uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase from *P. denitrificans* (cobA). The plasmid was found to complement efficiently the cysG deficiency of the strain, indicating that cbiK<sup>L</sup> was functional as a precorrin-2 ferrochelatase in siroheme synthesis. However, the addition of exogenous cobalt to the medium prevented this complementation suggesting that the ferrochelatase activity is inhibited by cobalt, consistent with the function of CbiK being a cobalt chelatase (24, 25). If CbiK<sup>L</sup> does contain a signal peptide, it would not appear to be transported since in *E. coli*, at least, CbiK<sup>L</sup> would appear to be retained in the cytosol.

When the *P. gingivalis* cbiK<sup>L</sup> was used to complement a cobalt chelatase deficient *E. coli* corrin producing strain, the gene was found to restore cobalamin levels to those previously observed with the *S. typhimurium* cbiK (Table 3) (24). Thus, the *P. gingivalis* and *S.* typhimurium cbiK are functionally equivalent encoding precorrin-2 cobalt chelatases that can also act as precorrin-2 ferrochelatases. Moreover, the *P. gingivalis* protein can be modeled accurately onto the *S. typhimurium* CbiK structure (25), with complete conservation of the amino acids involved in catalysis and structure formation (Figure 4). To investigate the role of the N-terminal extension, cbiK was expressed in both long (CbiK<sup>L</sup>) and short (CbiK<sup>S</sup>) versions as N-terminally His-tagged recombinant proteins in *E. coli*. This was achieved by cloning the respective genetic transcripts into pET14b. The two proteins were purified by metal chelate chromatography. Interestingly, the protein with the potential membrane lipoprotein signal sequence did not purify as easily as the protein without the signal and displayed a tendency to aggregate (Figure 5). The two proteins were used for in vitro assays,

Roper et al.; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

which demonstrated that they both catalyzed the insertion of Co²⁺ into precorrin-2 with similar efficiency (Figure 6).

When *cbiL*, which encodes a cobalt-precorrin-2 methyltransferase (29), was cloned into pKK223-3, the resultant plasmid was found to complement a *S. typhimurium cbiL* strain (Table 3) (11, 21). In this respect the *S. typhimurium* and *P. gingivalis cbiL* are interchangeable. The two bifunctional genes, *cbiJD* and *cbiGF* (encoding multifunctional enzymes of unknown function) were also cloned into pKK223-3. However, the presence of the *P. gingivalis cbiJD* did not restore cobalamin synthesis to a *S. typhimurium cbiD* strain. This result is consistent with the appearance of at least two classes of *cbiD*, reflecting some subtle differences in the anaerobic cobalamin pathway. For instance, the *B. megaterium cbiD* does not efficiently complement the *S. typhimurium cbiD* strain (11). The ability of the fusion protein to complement a *cbiJ* mutant was not tested.

The *P. gingivalis cbiGF* was found to complement a *S. typhimurium cbiF* mutant (11) indicating that the encoded protein is functional, in part, as the C-11 methyltransferase. The CbiF region of the fusion protein also modeled well onto the previously determined CbiF structure (30), in agreement with its functionality (data not shown). The *cbiGF* fusion was not tested for its ability to complement defined *cbiG* mutants. The functional complementation experiments demonstrate that the *P. gingivalis* genes represent part of an oxygen-independent pathway, broadly similar to those described for *S. typhimurium* and *B. megaterium* (Figure 2) (8, 13).

Roper et al.; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

Properties of the expressed proteins.

As with CbiK (cobalt chelatase), the other proteins, CbiL (C-20 methyltransferase), CbiJD (unknown function) and CbiGF (unknown function), were overproduced as recombinant His-tagged variants in *E. coli*. This was accomplished by cloning the respective genes into pET14b, which after transformation into BL21/pLysS allowed the recombinant proteins to be expressed to a level of at least 10% of total cellular protein. CbiK, CbiL and CbiGF were all found to be largely soluble whilst CbiJD was found to be largely insoluble. However, CbiJD could be resolubilised in 6M GnHCL and, after dialysis, remained in solution. The proteins could all be purified by metal affinity chromatography and the purified proteins are shown in Figure 5. CbiK<sup>L</sup> and CbiK<sup>S</sup> both ran as proteins with M<sub>r</sub>s of 30 k, as did CbiL, whilst both CbiJD and CbiGF ran with M<sub>r</sub>s of 66 k, consistent with their gene-derived molecular masses. The overproduced proteins are currently being used for *in vitro* assays and in attempts to crystallize the proteins.

Can *P. gingivalis* make cobalamin *de novo*?

The absence of any genes for the synthesis of precorrin-2 suggested that the bacterium was incapable of *de novo* synthesis of cobalamin. To address this possibility, cells were grown on a range of complex and defined media in order to ascertain whether there was any evidence for *de novo* synthesis of cobalamin.

When grown on rich medium (CBA), known to contain exogenous vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, *P. gingivalis* strain W83 accumulated cobalamin to a level of ~5 pmol/10<sup>9</sup> cells (Table 4). The bacteria were subcultured on defined medium (17) in the absence of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, on which it was noted that the levels of cobalamin dropped to ~1 pmol/10<sup>9</sup> cells (Table 4). Further subculturing on defined medium resulted in poor growth and a lowering of the amount of cobalamin.

Roper et al; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

detected in cell extracts (data not shown). Addition to the defined medium of exogenous cobalt and 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), the first universal intermediate of all porphinoid synthesis (4), did not result in significantly increased levels of cobalamin⁵. However, addition of exogenous cobalamin to the defined medium resulted in an accumulation of cobalamin within the cells. Such uptake may be mediated by TonB-linked receptors, which are frequently involved in periplasmic translocation of hemin, iron, colicins, or vitamin B₁₂ in other bacteria, and which have been reported in *P. gingivalis* (31). On all this available evidence it would appear that *P. gingivalis* is unable to synthesize its own cobalamin and relies on uptake to meet its coenzyme requirement.

Since the bacteria harbor genes capable of converting precorrin-2 into cobalamin, precorrin-2 was added to liquid cultures of *P. gingivalis* growing in defined media. This did not result in any increase in endogenous cobalamin synthesis, merely suggesting that precorrin-2 is probably not taken up by the cells. Indeed, the first cobalamin pathway intermediate known to be taken up in other bacteria is cobyric acid. When this compound was added to the defined *P. gingivalis* medium, not surprisingly, it was found that it was converted into cobalamin (or at least an intermediate between cobinamide and adenosylcobalamin) (Table 4). This was deduced from the observed growth of a *S. typhimurium* indicator strain, AR2680, induced by extracts of *P. gingivalis* that had been supplemented with cobyric acid. The indicator strain cannot convert cobyric acid into cobinamide and hence cannot make cobalamin due to a mutation within *cbiB*. Growth of the indicator strain is therefore dependent upon the presence of exogenous cobinamide (or a later pathway intermediate). The conversion of cobyric acid into cobinamide (and later intermediates) in *P. gingivalis* was, as expected, dependent upon the concentration of added exogenous cobyric acid i.e. the transformation of cobyric acid was dose dependent (Table 4). This result demonstrated that, at least, the *cobD* (encoding L-

Roper et al; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

threonine-phosphate decarboxylase) and *cbiB* (encoding cobinamide synthase) (9) gene products must be functionally active.

To test whether the presence of this cobalamin pathway was an isolated phenomenon of W83, we investigated the ability of a large number of other related strains to convert cobyric acid into cobinamide. To this end, several *P. gingivalis* strains were tested, along with closely related *Bacteroides* and *Prevotella* species. These species were selected so that a broad range of pigmented and non-pigmented species, which are often found in the same habitat, could be tested. All but *Pr. loescheii* were able to convert exogenously supplied cobyric acid into cobinamide (Table 5). *Pr. loescheii* was capable of taking up exogenously supplied cobyric acid but did not convert it to cobinamide.

Discussion.

The ability of *P. gingivalis* to biosynthesize tetrapyrroles de novo has been investigated.

Extracts of the bacterium do not possess activity for ALAD or PBGD, two key enzymes involved in the synthesis of uroporphyrinogen III. Similarly, it was not possible to detect any genetic evidence for these early enzymes with the use of degenerate PCR or by searching the data bases of the *P. gingivalis* genome sequencing project. However, biochemical and genetic investigations demonstrated that the bacterium did harbor the genes for the conversion of precorrin-2 into cobinamide. Some of these genes appeared as fusions, including *cbiJD* and *cbiGF*, and these can be interpreted with respect to the previously unidentified functions for CbiD and CbiG, since other fusion proteins in the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway appear to occur between enzymes that catalyze consecutive steps. For example, CbiET, which is also equivalent to CobL in the oxygen-dependent pathway, catalyses the methylation at C5/15 as well as the decarboxylation step in corrin synthesis (32), whilst CbiKL catalyses the cobalt insertion step and methylation at C-20 (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/C_difficile/). On this basis it is likely that CbiG would catalyze a step prior to C-11 methylation, possibly the delta-lactone formation that gives rise to cobalt precorrin-4 (Figure 2) (33). Similarly, CbiD would therefore be likely to catalyze a step prior to corrin ring reduction, presumably the removal of the C-2 fragment and methylation processes at C-1 (Figure 2) (13, 32, 33).

Why an incomplete cobalamin biosynthetic pathway?

The research we have described on *P. gingivalis* reveals a number of interesting facts that are difficult to reconcile. First of all, there is no evidence that the bacterium can make uroporphyrinogen III, the universal macrocyclic primogenitor of heme, chlorophyll, siroheme and cobalamin (4). On this basis one would assume that the bacterium was unable to make any modified tetrapyrrole de novo, consistent with observations that exogenous heme and

Roper et al; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

cobalamin are required for growth. Secondly, following on from this point, it was somewhat surprising to discover that *P. gingivalis* contained a corrin pathway, with all the necessary enzymes to convert precorrin-2 into cobalamin. Some of these enzymes were shown to complement defined *S. typhimurium* and *E. coli* cobalamin biosynthetic mutants. *P. gingivalis* is able to take up exogenously added cobyric acid and convert it into cobalamin, indicating that at least some of these enzymes are expressed within the cell. Why then does the bacterium contain a functional corrin pathway if it is unable to make the precorrin-2 substrate for entry into the pathway? The least likely explanation is that the bacterium may have evolved a completely different method for the synthesis of precorrin-2. The recent discovery that precorrin-2 can be converted into heme demonstrates that there is still much to be learnt about tetrapyrrole metabolism (34). Moreover, it is known that there are two routes for ALA synthesis (4), therefore alternative routes for the synthesis of uroporphyrinogen III/precorrin-2 may also exist. However, the fact that we were unable to detect any *de novo* synthesis of cobalamin in *P. gingivalis* suggests that such an alternative pathway does not exist in this organism. It would be unlikely that the bacterium is able to convert heme back into precorrin-2 for thermodynamic reasons, since the porphyrin macrocycle would have to be reduced back to the level of a hexahydroporphyrin and have its side chains modified to those observed in uroporphyrinogen III. Furthermore, all the *P. gingivalis* cultures were grown on medium containing exogenous heme, yet there was no evidence that any endogenous cobalamin was being produced.

A more likely explanation is that the bacterium has only relatively recently lost its early heme biosynthetic operon but has not yet lost its remaining *cbi* genes. There is no evidence that any of these *cbi* genes have become inactive indicating little time has elapsed for gene alterations to have taken place, although there is some evidence to suggest that CbiK may have evolved a

Roper et al; cobalamin biosynthesis in *P. gingivalis*

new role in heme binding (27, 28). Indeed, the structure of CbiK is very similar to that of protoporphyrin ferrochelatase (30) and may well be able to bind protoheme when complexed with other proteins.

Moreover, the bacterium would appear to have lost most of its heme biosynthetic genes, since there is no *hemD*, *E* or *G*. The remaining *hemH* may be retained to act as a dechelatase to aid in the removal of iron from exogenously imported heme, as has been suggested in *Haemophilus influenzae* (35). The presence of the putative coproporphyrinogen oxidase, HemN, may be misleading since its function is not yet fully understood. As a pathogen living on a rich medium, *P. gingivalis* would appear to have lost its selection pressure in keeping the ability to make tetrapyrroles *de novo*. The bacterium has evolved efficient transport systems to import exogenous heme and cobalamin. The presence of the cobinamide biosynthetic enzymes in *P. gingivalis* means that the bacterium can salvage the corrin component of cobalamin, and convert it back into the coenzyme form. A similar situation also exists in *E. coli*, where the organism has maintained its nucleotide assembly and attachment genes but has lost the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of cobinamide (36, 37).

In conclusion, *P. gingivalis* does not appear to have the ability to make either heme or cobalamin *de novo*. Both modified tetrapyrroles are somehow accumulated from the growth medium. A summary of the remaining pieces of the biosynthetic pathway in *P. gingivalis* is shown in figure 7.

Footnotes:

1. The nomenclature relating to the cobalamin biosynthetic genes is confusing. In the aerobic pathway all genes for the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III into cobalamin are prefixed *cob*, whilst in the anaerobic route the genes for the conversion of precorrin-2 into adenosylcobinamide phosphate are prefixed *cbi* with the genes for the nucleotide loop assembly prefixed *cob*. Thus the *cobA* gene refers to two quite distinct enzymes depending whether reference is being made to the aerobic or anaerobic pathway.

The aerobic and anaerobic pathways are outlined, highlighting the gene products required for the synthesis of adenosylcobalamin from uroporphyrinogen III. The aerobic pathway has been completely elucidated in *P. denitrificans* and the intermediates are outlined on the right hand side of the figure, whilst the anaerobic pathway has been partially resolved and its intermediates are outlined on the left hand side of the figure. The genes found in *P. gingivalis* are shown in red and correspond to the genes found in bacteria such as *S. typhimurium*, which harbor an anaerobic pathway. Underlined proteins indicate those overproduced in this study.

Figure 5a, lane 1, contains 5 μg of purified CbiGF; lane 2 contains 5 μg of purified CbiJD, after the protein had been resolubilised in urea and purified by metal chelate chromatography; lane 3 contains 5 μg of purified CbiL. Figure 5b, lane 1 contains 5 μg of purified CbiK<sup>L</sup> whilst lane 2 contains a similar quantity of purified CbiK<sup>S</sup>. The CbiK<sup>L</sup> copurified with a number of contaminants that proved difficult to remove.

Figure 6. Spectra of reaction catalyzed by CbiK. Precorrin-2 (10 μM) was incubated with cobalt (25 μM) in the presence (thin line) and absence of either CbiK<sup>L</sup> or CbiK<sup>S</sup> (thick line). In the absence of CbiK, a spectrum of partially-oxidised precorrin-2 was obtained (broad absorption maximum between 380-400 nm) since the reaction was performed under aerobic conditions. In the presence of either CbiK<sup>L</sup> or CbiK<sup>S</sup>, the spectrum of cobalt sirohydrochlorin was obtained, consistent with the function of CbiK as a cobalt chelatase.
