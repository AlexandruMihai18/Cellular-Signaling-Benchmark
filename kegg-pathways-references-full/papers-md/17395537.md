**Dlgh1 and Carma1 MAGUK proteins contribute to signal specificity downstream of TCR activation**

Fabien Rebeaud, Stephan Hailfinger and Margot Thome

Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), have a key role in T cell receptor (TCR)-induced gene transcription but their precise mechanism of activation is not well understood. The findings of two recent papers provide new insight into the activation of p38 and JNK by the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family members Dlgh1 and Carma1, respectively, and show how distinct MAGUK proteins control specific aspects of TCR-mediated MAPK activation.

MAGUKs and TCR signaling
On a mature naive T cell, the engagement by the T cell receptor (TCR) of MHC-peptide-antigen complexes leads

Figure 1. Overview of the domain structure of Dlgh1 and Carma1 with identified binding partners. Dlgh1 and Carma1 share the presence of MAGUK-typical PDZ, SH3 and GUK domains, but have distinct N-terminal domains. Dlgh1 has three PDZ domains proposed to bind to p38 following T cell activation [3]. The SH3 domain of Dlgh1 binds to the Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and, thereby, controls actin polymerization following TCR engagement [3,8], whereas the GUK domain binds to Gakin (guanylate kinase-associated kinesin) [11], a kinesin-like protein involved in vesicle transport to the plus-end of microtubules. The unique N-terminal region of Dlgh1 contains a proline-rich domain that binds to the tyrosine kinase p56<sup>lck</sup> [10]. Carma1 has a unique N-terminal region containing a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and coiled coil domain. The SH3 domain of Carma1 has been shown to be important for lipid raft recruitment [9], whereas the GUK domain mediates binding to the Ser/Thr kinase PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) [27]. The CARD motif of Carma1 binds to Bcl10 (B cell lymphoma 10) [12,13], whereas the coiled coil domain interacts with Malt1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein 1) [28].

vation, by studying the proteins Dlgh1 (Discs large homolog 1) and Carma1 (caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein 1), respectively [3,4]. Both proteins are members of the so-called membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family (Figure 1). Through their multiple domains participating in protein–protein interactions, MAGUKs are thought to function as scaffolding proteins recruiting signaling molecules to assemble multimolecular signaling complexes [5]. MAGUKs have key roles at sites of tight cell–cell contact, such as the neuronal synapse, which shares several important features with the immunological synapse. An immunological synapse is formed following prolonged contact between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC), and is thought to be crucial for efficient T cell activation [6]. MAGUK proteins are structurally characterized by the presence of one to three PDZ domains (originally identified in the proteins PSD95, Dlg and ZO-1), an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and a guanylate kinase (GUK) domain that is homologous to guanylate kinases but lacks kinase activity [5]. Dlgh1 and Carma1 share some of these C-terminal, MAGUK-typical features but also contain unique N-terminal structural features that collectively contribute to various protein–protein interactions (Figure 1). Both proteins translocate to the immune synapse following T-cell–APC contact [7–9], and the molecular mechanism by which Dlgh1 and Carma1 affect T cell functions is presently the focus of intense investigation.

TCR-induced NFAT and p38 activation by Dlgh1

A role for the mammalian Dlgh1 (also known as DLG1 and SAP97) in T cell activation was first suggested by the observation that human Dlgh1 associated with the tyro-

Figure 2. Summary of Dlgh1- and Carma1-controlled TCR signaling pathways in mature T cells. In mature T cells, TCR engagement triggers the activation of multiple transcriptional pathways that depend on the MAGUK proteins Dlgh1 and Carma1. Dlgh1 specifically controls NFAT activation through the so-called alternative pathway of p38 activation. This is thought to occur through a physical interaction of Dlgh1 with ZAP70, which directly or indirectly mediates the phosphorylation of p38 on Tyr323, leading to the subsequent autophosphorylation and activation of p38 [2,3]. In turn, p38 activation is necessary to enable NFAT activation, most probably by phosphorylation of its transactivation domain [3]. Dlgh1 does not seem to affect the TCR-induced Ca²⁺ response, which controls NFAT nuclear translocation by Ca²⁺–calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT. Optimal NFAT activation is thought to require the convergence of both Ca²⁺–calcineurin-dependent nuclear translocation and p38-dependent activation of NFAT. Carma1 controls NF-κB activation by the formation of a Carma1–Bcl10–Malt1 complex that controls IKK activation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB [12,13]. The recent study by Blonska et al. suggests that Carma1 specifically controls activation of the long isoform of JNK2 and, possibly, of JNK1 [4]. However, it is still controversial whether Carma1 also controls the activation of the short splice isoforms (p46) of JNK1 and JNK2 [18,19] or whether this might be controlled by a PKC-dependent, Carma1-independent pathway that is not precisely understood [4]. Abbreviation: CaN, calcineurin.

of p38 [2]. Interestingly, p38 activation was required for NFAT activation, because NFAT activation could be impaired by pharmacological inhibition of p38 or by overexpression of a dominant negative, PDZ mutated form of Dlgh1 that inhibits p38 activation [3]. These effects were specific for p38 and NFAT, because no inhibition of the ERK and JNK pathways or of the NF-κB pathways was observed. Collectively, the data of Round et al. suggest that the MAGUK family member Dlgh1 specifically coordinates the activation of the alternative p38 pathway and, thereby, directs TCR signals toward NFAT (but not NF-κB) activation (Figure 2).

TCR-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation by Carma1

TCR-induced NF-κB and JNK activation, but not NFAT and p38 activation, is coordinated specifically by another MAGUK family member, Carma1 (also known as CARD11 and Bimp3) [12,13]. The molecular mechanism of Carma1-dependent NF-κB activation has been studied intensively in recent years. Following TCR engagement, Carma1 recruits the adaptor protein B cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) and the human paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein 1 (Malt1) to form a Carma1–Bcl10–Malt1 complex (also known as the CBM complex). This is thought to be crucial for the activation of the classical NF-κB pathway, by ubiquitylation-dependent activation of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, which targets the inhibitor of

NF-κB (IκB) for proteasomal degradation to enable the nuclear translocation of NF-κB [12–14]. By contrast, how Carma1 controls the activation of the JNK pathway has remained enigmatic.

Two JNK genes, JNK1 and JNK2, are expressed in thymocytes and, inducibly following activation, in peripheral T cells [15]. For both JNK1 and JNK2, two isoforms, JNKp46 and JNKp54, have been described – these result from alternative splicing that adds an additional 43 amino acid tail to the C-terminus of the p54 isoforms [16,17]. Both isoforms of JNK1 and JNK2 are phosphorylated rapidly following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)–ionomycin or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation [15], but the underlying mechanism and the role of the individual JNK isoforms is only partly understood. The recent study by Blonska et al. [4] now demonstrates that Carma1-deficient Jurkat cells in addition to primary T, B and mast cells derived from Carma1 knockout mice show a clear defect in the phosphorylation of JNK2p54 but not of JNK2p46 or JNK1p46. Blonska et al. also noted that the activation of a transfected JNK1p54 construct was affected by Carma1-deficiency; the corresponding endogenous JNK1p54 was only weakly expressed in the Jurkat clone used in this study [4]. These findings are in contrast to previous studies using a dominant negative Carma1 mutant [18] or primary T cells derived from Carma1⁻/⁻ mice [19], which had found a marked decrease in the

activation of both the short and long isoforms of JNK1 and JNK2. At present, the reasons for these contradictory findings are unclear, and further studies are required to understand fully how Carma1 might selectively control the activation of the long splice isoforms of JNK2 and, possibly, of JNK1. This is particularly relevant because, to date, no particular function has been attributed to the long JNK isoforms. The paper by Blonska *et al.* also provides evidence that the Carma1 interaction partner, Bcl10, is necessary for JNK2p54 activation [4]. Interestingly, Bcl10 inducibly co-immunoprecipitated following PMA-ionomycin stimulation with JNK2p54, and with the MAP kinase kinase TAK1 and the MAP kinase kinase MKK7, which are both described to regulate JNK activity in T cells [1,20]. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that Bcl10 functions as a JNK activation scaffold that enables the sequential activation of JNK2p54 through a TAK1-MKK7-JNK2 signaling cascade (Figure 2). However, it seems likely that additional adaptors and effectors are relevant for this function.

### Open issues and future perspectives

Why do T cells use two MAGUK-dependent pathways to transmit TCR-dependent signals? One possibility is that the separation of TCR-derived signals into two major branches provides a safeguard mechanism against accidental activation, as both Dlgh1- and Carma1-derived signals are required to enable optimal T cell activation and proliferation. Another possibility is that Dlgh1 and Carma1 can help to specifically integrate signals from additional cell surface receptors, as has been proposed for other MAGUK family members [5]. The unmodulated L298R mutant of Carma1 has indeed revealed the capacity of Carma1 to integrate CD28-derived signals that lead to NF-κB activation [21]. By contrast, Dlgh1 can bind to the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 [10], which is important to enable sustained Ca²⁺ mobilization and, thus, to sustain NFAT activation in naive but not effector T cells [22]. In the study by Round *et al.*, Dlgh1 silencing had no effect on anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-induced Ca²⁺ responses in primary murine effector T cells [3], but naive T cells have not been tested. Therefore, it is still possible that the Dlgh1-Kv1.3 interaction is relevant for Dlgh1-mediated NFAT activation in naive T cells. Finally, it is interesting to note that NFAT DNA sequence motifs are frequently found in genes that are targeted by the transcription factor Foxp3 [23,24], which is selectively expressed in regulatory T (Treg) cells and controls the function and phenotype of these cells. Foxp3 associates physically with NFAT and can alternately repress or promote NFAT-mediated target gene expression [23,24]. Therefore, it is possible that Dlgh1-dependent (but not Carma1-dependent) signals specifically contribute to the generation or maintenance of Treg cells.

Another interesting open issue is to understand better how exactly Dlgh1 controls NFAT activation. The data of Round *et al.* [3] suggest that p38 can mediate the phosphorylation of the transactivating domain of NFAT directly or indirectly, but it is unclear how this relates to the well-known regulation of NFAT by the Ca²⁺-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates

NFAT and, thereby, controls its nuclear translocation. It is tempting to speculate that Dlgh1 might physically associate with calcineurin through the adaptor protein A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79), as has been suggested from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging studies in transfected COS7 cells [25], but it has yet to be experimentally tested whether similar mechanisms apply to T cells.

Finally, it will be relevant to gain additional insight into the TCR-derived signals that control the assembly of Dlgh1- and Carma1-containing signaling complexes, respectively. Recent studies have suggested that TCR engagement leads to Carma1 phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC)θ, inducing a conformational change that enables the assembly of a Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 complex necessary for downstream signal transduction [13]. At present it is unclear whether lipid raft recruitment and binding to the TCR-associated tyrosine kinases Lck and Zap70 is sufficient for Dlgh1 activation, or whether Ser/Thr phosphorylation, possibly by p38 itself [26], or other posttranslational modifications are involved in controlling the function of Dlgh1 in the TCR signaling pathway. A better understanding of these mechanisms, and the identification of the exact point where TCR-derived signals bifurcate to control Dlgh1 and Carma1 activation, would be highly useful for therapeutic approaches aimed at treating T cell-dependent pathologies, including transplant rejection, allergy and autoimmunity.

**Elsevier celebrates two anniversaries with a gift to university libraries in the developing world**

In 1580, the Elzevir family began their printing and bookselling business in the Netherlands, publishing works by scholars such as John Locke, Galileo Galilei and Hugo Grotius. On 4 March 1880, Jacobus George Robbers founded the modern Elsevier company intending, just like the original Elzevir family, to reproduce fine editions of literary classics for the edification of others who shared his passion, other 'Elzeviriens'. Robbers co-opted the Elzevir family printer's mark, stamping the new Elsevier products with a classic symbol of the symbiotic relationship between publisher and scholar. Elsevier has since become a leader in the dissemination of scientific, technical and medical (STM) information, building a reputation for excellence in publishing, new product innovation and commitment to its STM communities.

In celebration of the House of Elzevir’s 425th anniversary and the 125th anniversary of the modern Elsevier company, Elsevier donated books to ten university libraries in the developing world. Entitled 'A Book in Your Name', each of the 6700 Elsevier employees worldwide was invited to select one of the chosen libraries to receive a book donated by Elsevier. The core gift collection contains the company's most important and widely used STM publications, including *Gray's Anatomy*, *Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary*, *Essential Medical Physiology*, *Cecil Essentials of Medicine*, *Mosby's Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary*, *The Vaccine Book*, *Fundamentals of Neuroscience*, and *Myles Textbook for Midwives*.

The ten beneficiary libraries are located in Africa, South America and Asia. They include the Library of the Sciences of the University of Sierra Leone; the library of the Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences of the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; the library of the College of Medicine of the University of Malawi; and the University of Zambia; Universite du Mali; Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Mozambique; Makerere University, Uganda; Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador; Universidad Francisco Marroquin, Guatemala; and the National Centre for Scientific and Technological Information (NACESTI), Vietnam.

Through 'A Book in Your Name', these libraries received books with a total retail value of approximately one million US dollars.
