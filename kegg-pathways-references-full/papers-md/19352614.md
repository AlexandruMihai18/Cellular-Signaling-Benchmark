## Abstract  
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging metabolic-related disorder characterized by fatty infiltration of the liver in the absence of alcohol consumption. NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which might progress to end-stage liver disease. This progression is related to the insulin resistance, which is strongly linked to the metabolic syndrome consisting of central obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Earlier, the increased concentration of intracellular fatty acids within hepatocytes leads to steatosis. Subsequently, multifactorial complex interactions between nutritional factors, lifestyle, and genetic determinants promote necrosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular damage. Up to now, many studies have revealed the mechanism associated with insulin resistance, whereas the mechanisms related to the molecular components have been incompletely characterized. This review aims to assess the potential molecular mediators initiating and supporting the progression of NASH to establish precocious diagnosis and to plan more specific treatment for this disease.

## Introduction  
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic condition which encompasses a wide spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [1]. The presence of NASH is associated with more severe metabolic derangement and insulin resistance (IR) [2]. The high incidence of NAFLD in developed countries is related to the widespread presence of risk factors including the use of drugs, parenteral nutrition, gastric bypass surgery, and inherited metabolic disorders such as obesity, dyslipidemias, type 2 diabetes, and IR [3–7]. Fat accumulation in the parenchymal liver is the result of abnormal fatty acids metabolism including: (1) failure of the synthesis/secretion of apolipoproteins and triglycerides [8]; (2) excessive delivery of free fatty acids (FFAs) to the liver compared to the aliquot which can be metabolized; and (3) increased mitochondrial lipid oxidation. Liver biopsy studies in obese individuals have demonstrated that 30–40% of patients develop more than a simple steatosis [9]. In patients with NASH, 74% will have fibrosis and ~30% will have cirrhosis at the time of their initial liver biopsy [9, 10]. These data led to the identification of the risk factors which determine the NASH progression. An interesting working model known as the “two-hit” theory postulates the progression from simple steatosis to NASH, fibrosis, or cirrhosis. The “first hit” consists in the accumulation of excessive hepatic fat owing to IR. Often, this step is present in patients with the metabolic syndrome, and although it is not sufficient to cause NASH, it is enough to predispose the liver to chronic inflammation. The oxidative stress owing to reactive oxygen species (ROS) [11], gut-derived lipopolysaccharide, and soluble mediators synthesized both from cells of the immune system and from cells of the adipose tissue [12]

have been indicated as factors of risk responsible for the “second hit” (Fig. 1). Although the model of the “two-hit theory” quickly spread through the scientific world, it seems obvious that different factors are necessarily interacting. In the last few years, studies in animal models of NAFLD have provided new insights into the molecular and physiologic alterations responsible for the switch from steatosis to steatohepatitis. In this regard, several groups indicate that in NAFLD progression, multifactorial complex interactions between genetic determinants, nutritional factors, and dysmetabolism participate in the development of hepatocellular damage and progressive liver disease. Lipotoxic effects of FFAs and lipid intermediates impair the correct functions of liver cell organelles involving the production of ROS, the activation of pro-inflammatory defense programs, and, ultimately, apoptosis by mechanisms which are not yet fully understood. Toxic lipids and release of cytokines contribute to impair insulin signaling, which in turn contributes to diminished very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and liver secretion, involving an insufficient regulation of important transcription factors required for lipogenesis [13]. Impaired regulation activity of several nuclear receptors provides the molecular mechanism for the deteriorating metabolic dysfunction in NAFLD [14]. Deregulation of insulin signaling is critical in promoting progression from steatosis to inflammation, lipid peroxidation, and liver injury associated with steato-

hepatitis [15, 16]. In the course of metabolic burden, the hepatocellular defense against oxidative stress deteriorates organelle functions. Mitochondria are the first organelle to be impaired, as suggested by decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and increased compensatory peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation [17]. Oxidative stress further increases the hepatocyte’s susceptibility to toxic stimuli and stress [18]. Activation of cellular defense programs, and in particular activation of Kupffer cells, offers additional stress stimuli and may influence the fate of hepatocytes from survival toward apoptosis by altering lipid oxidation and the intracellular redox state [19]. Activated Kupffer cells produce inflammatory mediators which in turn activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to synthesize collagen whose overproduction leads to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.

The aim of this review was to outline the molecular and the genetic mechanisms leading to NASH. As a result, we will describe the key players involved in NAFLD onset as well as how pathologic alterations in each step of glucose and lipids metabolism are involved in the whole progression of NAFLD. Additionally, we will illustrate how antioxidant enzymes and genes implicated in the mitochondrial and microsomal functions are affected by those multiple cellular adaptations to the oxidative stress occurring when fatty acid metabolism is impaired in order to identify possible risk factors which lean towards the progression of the disease.

NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance

The occurrence of IR in the liver, characterized by reduced insulin-suppressing effect in hepatic glucose production, aggravates peripheral IR and contributes to hepatic lipogenesis [20]. Consequently, hyperinsulinemia determines an increased hepatic synthesis of FFAs and a decreased synthesis of apolipoprotein B-100, leading to triglyceride accumulation in the liver [21] (Fig. 1). Therefore, elevated FFAs levels are caused by IR in the adipocyte and lead to a decreased suppression of lipolysis by insulin [22]. The liver is not only an end organ for the effects of IR, but it is also an important regulator of carbohydrate homeostasis, which is under the control of insulin signaling, acting through binding to its specific receptor [23]. The insulin receptor belongs to a subfamily of tyrosine kinase receptors including insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-related receptor [24]. The insulin binding to its receptor activates the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates IRS-1 and IRS-2, which are the main mediators of insulin signaling in the liver [25] (Fig. 2a). The ligand-receptor interaction leads to the recruitment and to the activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS [26], which recruits signaling molecules containing Src homology-2 domains, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), and SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase (Shp2), which, in turn, activate downstream effectors which mediate the metabolic effects of insulin [27] (Fig. 2a). In addition, IRS proteins undergo serine phosphorylation, which attenuate insulin signaling by decreasing insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation [28, 29]. Tyrosine phosphatases [23] and serine kinases including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [30], protein kinase C (PKC) [31], inhibitor κB kinase (IKK) complex [29], and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are involved in these pathways [32] (Fig. 2a). The main downstream effector of insulin signaling is the protein kinase Akt. Upon activation, Akt phosphorylates and inactivates an inhibitory kinase, the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3; Fig. 2a), which regulates glycogen synthesis by inactivating glycogen synthase [33]. Depending on the pathway impaired, the elevated circulating levels of insulin and glucose generated may play a crucial role in fibrogenesis [34] through the release of connective tissue growth factors from HSCs and the production of extracellular matrix [34].

Impairment of glucose homeostasis in NAFLD

The mechanism whereby FFAs induce hepatic IR is mediated by translocation of the PKC isoforms [35] from the cytosol to the membrane compartment, resulting in impairment of hepatic IRS-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity [36]. In NAFLD patients, primary defect in insulin receptors causes the downregulation of IRS-1 signaling by excess FFAs [37], which activate the stress/inflammatory kinases JNK, IKK-β, and suppressors of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) contributing to IR [38, 39] (Fig. 2b).

JNK is regulated by FFAs and is an important regulator of IR [38]. The role of JNK in the induction of hepatic IR has been stressed by the demonstration of the correlation between IR, PKCε, and JNK activity [39] (Fig. 2b). Conflicting results exist on the role of the different JNK isoforms in inhibiting insulin signaling and in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Principally, JNK2 isoform impairs IRS-2, but not IRS-1, phosphorylation in hepatocytes overexpressing cytochrome P402 E1 [40]. The target of JNK action is the Ser307 of IRS-1[16, 41]. Overall, these data are coherent with a study showing that IR in the livers is not induced by insulin but mediated by TNF-α and FFAs through a JNK-dependent IRS-1Ser307 phosphorylation [38]. IKK-β is required for the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), the foremost transcription factor of pro-inflammatory mediators [such as interleukin-1(IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)] implicated in IR (Fig. 2b). The role of NF-κB in mediating hepatic and systemic IR was established by the selective loss of IKK-β in hepatocytes [40]. The mice expressing constitutively IKK-β in hepatocytes exhibit a type 2 diabetes phenotype, hepatic IR, and increased production of TNF-α [42–44]. Therefore, NF-κB-dependent inflammatory mediators produced in hepatocytes act to down-modulate insulin sensitivity and to promote liver injury. In vivo shutdown of hepatic glucose output by insulin involves also the nuclear exclusion of forkhead box-containing protein O subfamily-1 (FOXO1), a transcription factor controlling both the expression of the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). It has been reported that increased FOXO1 activity plays a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic IR associated with NAFLD [45]. FOXO1 is required for the activation of gluconeogenesis in association with peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) [46] and probably with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-α) [47], which is also downregulated by insulin signaling through the induction of the inhibitory isoform of liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein [48]. Hepatic FOXO1 ablation impairs cAMP-induced gluconeogenesis and reduces excessive hepatic glucose output caused by generalized cleavage of the insulin receptor [47]. Moreover, downregulation of FOXO1 by antisense oligonucleotides reduces hepatic IR in a murine model of diet-induced obesity and fatty liver [49]. FOXO1 becomes unresponsive

to insulin following the interaction with the deacetylase sirtuin-1, resulting in the induction of glucogenic genes [50, 51]. Hyperinsulinemia may also contribute to triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in the liver by inactivating the forkhead transcription factor-2 (Foxa-2) [52], which promotes fatty acid oxidation in the liver but is inactivated

by phosphorylation by either IRS1 or IRS2 signaling pathways (Fig. 2b). As Foxa-2 is sensitive to the action of insulin in the liver, hyperinsulinemia, even in the fasting state, can cause full suppression of Foxa2, thus decreasing fatty acid oxidation and contributing to fat accumulation.

Fig. 2 a Normal insulin signal transduction pathway. The insulin binding activates the phosphorylation of its receptor and the recruitment and the activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 which, in turn, recruit signaling molecules including PI3K, Grb2, and Shp2, which activate downstream effectors inducing the metabolic effects of insulin. Instead, serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins by recruitment of serine kinases including INK, PKC, IKK, and MAPK attenuate insulin signaling. Upon activation, Aky phosphorylates and inactivates the inhibitory kinase of GSK3, and FOXO, mediating the inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.

FFAs induce translocation of the PKC isoforms (PKCε, PKCδ) from the cytosolic to the membrane compartment, resulting in the impairment of hepatic IRS-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. The increased levels of IRS-1 inhibit the insulin receptor signaling. FFAs activate INK, IKK-β, and SOCS-3. INK activates IRS-1 through phosphorylation of Ser307; in particular, PKCθ/INK pathway is responsible for IRS-1 Ser307. INK2 impairs IRS-2 phosphorylation in hepatocytes overexpressing the cytochrome P402 E1. IR in the liver is mediated also by TNF-α through a JNK-dependent IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation. The pathway activating IKK-β induces NF-κB activation responsible for the induction of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Hyperinsulinemia induces the increase of TG by inactivating Foxa2, which decreases transcription of PEPCK and gluconeogenic activity. Foxa2 promotes fatty acid oxidation. Foxa2 is inactivated by phosphorylation of either IRS-1 or IRS-2 signaling pathways.

carboxylase-2 (ACC2) [58], an isoform of ACC that produces malonyl-CoA at the mitochondrial membrane [59] (Fig. 2b). The increase of malonyl-CoA causes a decreased oxidation of fatty acids due to the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), which shuttles fatty acids into the mitochondria [60]. The absence of ACC2 in knockout mice enhances the activity of CPT-1 and causes an increased rate of fatty acid oxidation [61].

ChREBP

ChREBP is the second bHLHZip transcription factor which leads to the transcription of genes involved in glycolysis, resulting in the conversion of glucose excess to fatty acids [62].

Glucose activates ChREBP by regulating the access of ChREBP from the cytosol into the nucleus and by activating the binding of the transcription factor to the DNA [63]. Glucose stimulates ChREBP to bind to an E-box motif in the promoter of liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis. Experimental evidences indicate that the expression of L-PK was reduced by approximately 90% in the liver of ChREBP knockout mice [63], suggesting that ChREBP can independently stimulate the transcription of lipogenic genes [64]. Whether inactivation of ChREBP attenuates the development of fatty livers in a state of IR is still under investigation. However, it seems that excessive stimulation of lipogenesis by ChREBP induction would be important only after the development of hyperglycemia.

PPAR-γ

Another transcription factor participating in the development of hepatic steatosis is PPAR-γ, a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that is required for normal adipocyte differentiation [65]. Normally, PPAR-γ is expressed at very low levels in the liver. In animal models with fatty livers, the expression of PPAR-γ is markedly increased [66]. SREBP-1c can activate transcriptionally PPAR-γ by stimulating production of an activating ligand for the nuclear receptor [67]. The importance of PPAR-γ expression in the development of fatty livers has been demonstrated in insulin-resistant mouse models in which the specific gene deletions of PPAR-γ attenuates the development of hepatic steatosis, independently to the presence of hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia [68]. In human NASH, PPAR-γ is transcriptionally upregulated and consequently activates lipogenic enzymes and exacerbates steatosis [68]. Additionally, it has been suggested that PPAR-γ agonists improve NASH, possibly by its primary insulin-sensitizing effect on adipocytes [69].

Molecular factors of lipid metabolism influencing NAFLD progression

IR is connected with the alteration of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, including glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD), a protein expressed in numerous tissues and cells [70]. Liver is the principal organ expressing high levels of GPI-PLD contributing to the release of GPI-PLD in the serum. The serum levels of GPI-PLD are related with apolipoproteins AI and AIV [71]. Patients with NAFLD show hepatic overexpression of GPI-PLD, which, in vitro, increases expression of de novo lipogenesis genes [72]. Genes affected by GPI-PLD overexpression involved in de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis include ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), ACC2, elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids, stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase (SCD), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1), whereas those involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids include short-chain hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase-alpha (HADH-α) and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2 (ACA-2). Many of these genes (ACC, SCD, ACLY, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) are regulated by SREBP. It is conceivable that overexpression of GPI-PLD alters the lipid composition of the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the activation of SREBPs [73]. Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) is another enzyme increased in NAFLD [74]. ADRP participates in signaling and membrane trafficking and is actively involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and is important in serving as a nucleation center for the assembly of lipids to form nascent lipid bodies [75]. Its overexpression enhances the uptake of long-chain fatty acids by increasing their stream speed [76]. Reduction in hepatic ADRP level using an antisense oligonucleotide reverses hepatic steatosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and IR in obese mice, suggesting that ADRP may be targeted for the treatment of NAFLD [77]. Genotype studies have analyzed the possibility that a genetic background confers the predisposition to NASH. A frameshift mutation in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) gene has been associated with a beta-lipoproteinemia leading to steatohepatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes. The MTP regulates the incorporation of triglycerides into apolipoprotein B and is a key enzyme for the assembly and secretion of VLDL from hepatocytes. The role of this pathway as a possible mechanism to generate fatty liver is demonstrated by the induction of fatty liver after tissue-specific inactivation of MTP [78]. The G/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -493 in the MTP promoter region has been associated with lower levels of transcription resulting in lower MTP levels and failure of TG secretion from the liver. Patients with NAFLD homozygous for the G allele have increased steatosis and higher histological NASH grade compared to heterozygous or homozygous patients [79]. Additionally, in vitro studies

have shown that insulin downregulates the expression of MTP in HepG2 cells, and in NASH subjects with a G/G genetic background, the hyperinsulinemia leads to a marked decrease in MTP. Interestingly, MTP is regulated by endotoxin and pro-inflammatory cytokines [80], factors which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis and may represent an additional mechanism for the association between NASH and MTP polymorphisms.

Recently, a connection between NAFLD and a loss-of-function of single nucleotide polymorphism in the phosphatidylethanolamine *N*-methyltransferase (PEMT) gene [81] has been described. PEMT catalyzes phosphatidylcholine synthesis required for VLDL synthesis. Pemt(−/−) mice fed a choline-deficient diet develop rapid steatohepatitis leading to liver failure [81]. Moreover, non-obese subjects with Val175Met variant of PEMT are susceptible to develop NASH [82].

Chitotriosidase and NASH

Recently, evidence has been provided that chitotriosidase (CHIT-1) increases significantly in NASH and Kupffer cells are the only hepatic source responsible of CHIT-1 mRNA expression [83, 84]. Human CHIT-1 is a member of the chitinase family mainly synthesized by activated macrophages. CHIT-1 activation could be associated with fatty acids accumulation [84–86]. The increased levels of CHIT-1 expression in Kupffer cells could be related with ROS production and lipid peroxides levels (Fig. 3). In response to liver cell injury/inflammation, activated Kupffer cells are a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines [87] which could induce CHIT-1 production. An added factor in the progression of NASH involves the release of cytokines by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Therefore, it is conceivably a contribution of CHIT-1 release for the activation of non-parenchymal cells, particularly as the biological effects of CHIT-1 are regulated by the release of cytokines [88]. Additionally, the highest levels of CHIT-1 were observed in NASH patients with the highest degree of hepatic iron accumulation [83]. Therefore, the increase of CHIT-1 in Kupffer cells might reflect an iron-mediated damage of lysosomes, suggesting that CHIT-1 contributes in regulating the acute phase response as an adaptive metabolic response to iron. Moreover, the correlation of CHIT-1 levels with alpha-smooth muscle actin (*α*-SMA) expression strongly suggests that CHIT-1 could be involved in the modulation of the extracellular matrix [89] in hepatic tissue, affecting cell adhesion and chemotaxis during the tissue remodeling processes which take place during fibrogenesis (Fig. 3) [90]. These data are consistent with in vitro studies showing that Kupffer cells medium stimulates collagen production and proliferation by isolated HSCs and elicits an activated morphology [91]. The parallel increases of CHIT-1 levels in

Fig. 3 Abnormality of oxidant functions in NASH progression. ROS generation leads to excessive lipid peroxidation. The ultrastructural mitochondrial defects cause impaired electron transport chain enzyme activity, leading to a defective oxidative phosphorylation triggering a vicious circle involving ROS-mediated antioxidant depletion and the deficient capacity of the mitochondria to inactivate ROS. The decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory complexes increase TNF-α levels, leading to additional lipid peroxidation which, in turn induces the production of IL-8 and of TGF-β, which activate collagen synthesis. The increased oxidative stress causes the increase activity of XO and the decrease of GPx, GST, GR, PON1, SOD, NO, and catalase levels. The increased activity of cytochrome P450 system is involved in the metabolism of lipo-oxygenation. CYPE1 overexpression reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2, while it increases IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, which leads to the inactivation of Akt resulting in the suppression of gluconeogenesis.

Kupffer cells and of α-SMA in HCSs, respectively, strongly suggest that this enzyme can be regarded as a mediator of HSCs activation in the liver of NASH patients. CHIT-1 released by activated Kupffer cells could activate HSCs to synthesize collagen whose overproduction leads to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Lipid peroxidation causes the raise of HO-1 levels both in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. HO reaction generates CO, biliverdin, bilirubin, and divalent iron. The overproduction of biliverdin and bilirubin inhibits LDL oxidation, while CO gives raise the cGMP and induces MAPK signaling pathway. The iron released is involved in a further oxidative stress. ROS formation, lipid peroxidation, cytokines, and the high degree of hepatic iron accumulation induces CHIT-1 release by Kupffer cells, which in turn activate HSCs to synthesize collagen whose overproduction leads to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. α-SMA alpha-smooth muscle actin, CO carbon monoxide, CHIT-1 chitotriosidase, cGMP cyclic guanylyl monophosphate, CYP2E1 cytochrome P450, GPx glutathione peroxidase, GR glutathione reductase, GST glutathione transferase, HO heme oxygenase, NO nitric oxide, PON1 paroxonase 1, SOD superoxide dismutase, TGF-β transforming growth factor-β, XO xanthine oxidase

In order to prevent oxidative stress, there is a constant balance between intrahepatic antioxidants and ROS. Appropriate fat oxidation is required to prevent fat accumulation in the liver, whereas excessive fatty acid oxidation leads to oxidative stress and reduction of antioxidant defenses [93]. The ROS imbalance triggers steatohepatitis by lipid peroxidation (Fig. 3). In experimental steatohepatitis, hepatocytes are the major site of lipid peroxidation due to the generation of pro-oxidants from mitochondria and/or cytochrome-P450 lipid oxidases, both of which are abundant in these cells [94]. In NASH patients, at least 40% of mitochondria are structurally abnormal [95]. The abnormalities consist of enlarged mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial cristae and paracrystalline inclusions [93], which are associated with impaired electron transport chain enzyme activity resulting in uncoupling oxidation from phosphorylation, leading to

Oxidative stress and NAFLD progression

Mechanisms promoting NAFLD progression involve multiple cellular adaptations to the oxidative stress occurring when fatty acid metabolism is impaired [92]. ROS in the liver can be generated through mechanisms involving mitochondria, cytochrome P-450, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase, cyclooxygenase, and lipoxyge-
further ROS formation [96]. Consequently, NASH patients have impaired adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) generation capacity [97] and depletion of mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) content, which precedes the decrease in the total liver GSH levels occurring for a defect in the mitochondrial GSH uptake mechanism [98, 99]. The decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory complexes increase TNF-α expression, which causes additional lipid peroxidation of mitochondrial membranes, further worsening mitochondrial function which, in turn, markedly enhances TNF-α hepatotoxicity [100] and cell death [101]. This suggests a close interaction between TNF-α and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of liver injury. In steatotic liver, the excess of ROS generation produces lipid peroxides, which further harm the respiratory chain component and the membrane transport capacity, triggering a vicious circle which involves antioxidant depletion and the incapacity of mitochondria to inactivate ROS [101] (Fig. 3). Overall, these events contribute to the enhancement of lipid peroxidation, which leads to liver cells injury and inflammation and conspicuous hepatic fibrosis and, consequently, to the development of steatohepatitis progression. In addition to TNF-α production, lipid peroxidation induces the production of other cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) [102] (Fig. 3). Interestingly, TGF-β is involved in the formation of Mallory bodies activating collagen synthesis and inducing fibrosis (Fig. 3). IL-8 is a chemoattractant that gives rise to neutrophil infiltration [102]. As well as TNF-α, TGF-β increase causes hepatocyte death. The higher rate of apoptosis in NASH patients is confirmed by the enhanced numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling-positive cells in the liver accompanied by increased expression of caspases 3 and 7. This amplified apoptotic response correlates with tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) expression, NF-κB activation, inflammatory activity, and fibrosis (Fig. 3) [103].

Hemeoxygenase-1 and NASH

Hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), a typical enzyme possessing antioxidant activity, results significantly upregulated in rodent models of NASH [108] and is overexpressed in NASH patients [109]. HO catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting reaction in heme catabolism [110]. The liver is the major organ which detoxifies excess of heme molecules by the action of HO [111]. The human liver generates comparable amounts of the HO-derived products in both Kupffer cells and hepatocytes [112]. The liver contains two HO isoenzymes for the physiologic degradation of the heme, HO-1 and HO-2. HO-1, and is inducible by various stimuli including cytokines, heavy metals, and ROS [113, 114]. The antioxidant activity of HO derives from the elimination of pro-oxidant heme and from its reaction products, i.e., carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin, bilirubin, and divalent iron, which are biologically active in the regulation of hepatobiliary function [115]. It has been observed that HO-1 expression exhibits distinct alterations between the different stages of liver disease in humans [109]. Since the sequence of pathogenic events during steatohepatitis progression involves early lipid accumulation and lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes, HO-1 could be activated by exposure to lipid peroxides. The temporal sequence of steatosis/lipid peroxidation, followed by liver cell injury, inflammation, HO-1 upregulation, and fibrosis, is consistent with the clue that lipid peroxidation may be mechanistically involved in the development of fibrosis. Moreover, the HO reaction releases iron, which could be involved in deleterious reactions that compete with iron reutilization and sequestration pathways.

Elevated levels of serum ferritin and positive liver iron stains are often observed in patients with NASH. Therefore, in the pathogenesis of liver injury, the iron overload is an additional event involving oxidative stress [116]. (Fig. 3).

Deregulation of oxidative stress response genes and NASH

Hepatic gene expression studies in progressive human NASH have shown abnormal expression of several genes implicated in the mitochondrial function. Mice with liver-specific deletion of nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), a gene mediating activation of oxidative stress response genes, develop all NAFLD features including steatosis, apoptosis, necrosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and, ultimately, cirrhosis or liver cancer [104, 105]. Increased oxidative stress in patients with NASH may result in a pro-oxidate environment, as demonstrated by the high levels of serum xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, which in turn could result in decreased

antioxidant enzyme activities including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and nitric oxide (NO) levels [106] (Fig. 3). A genotype study reported that a polymorphism of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is associated with an increased risk of severe liver disease [79], confirming that the compensatory mechanism of the antioxidative system against the oxidative stress is fragile. Moreover, it has been observed that mice lacking the gene encoding fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), the initial enzyme of the peroxisomal β-oxidation system, develop severe microvesicular NASH [107]. The damage of antioxidant enzyme activities in blood of patients with NASH further indicates a consistent role of free radical cytotoxicity in the pathophysiology of this disease.The evidence showing HO-1 overexpression in human NASH suggests that the variation of the HO-1 induction could be connected with the appearance of the initial lesions of steatohepatitis and the evolution in fibrosis.

Hemochromatosis gene mutations and NASH

In the recent years, it has been argued that iron overload is associated with hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations in the pathogenesis of NASH [117]. The two most frequently recognized inherited mutations of HFE result in amino acid substitutions at positions 282 (cysteine to tyrosine, C282Y) and 63 (histidine to aspartic acid, H63D). More than 90% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis are homozygous for at least one of these mutations [118]. Nevertheless, there are conflicting results on the role played by the mutation of the HFE [118, 119]. The significance of heterozygosity for these mutations is unclear, but it has been postulated that when a mutation occurs, even in heterozygosis, iron overload is present in the livers of NASH patients, which may induce fibrosis [104]. However, there may be a selection bias to do liver biopsy on people with HFE gene mutations with high ferritin levels or other evidence of liver dysfunction. Other investigators reported that the prevalence of HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) was similar to that of the general population, and iron overload and HFE mutations did not contribute significantly to hepatic fibrosis in patients with NASH [119].

Abnormality of the microsomal oxidant functions in NASH

The hypertrophy of the microsomal oxidant function due to increased activity of the cytochrome P450 system is associated with IR. Two enzymes, cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily E, polypeptide 1 (CYP2E1) and cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily a, polypeptide 10 (CYP4A), are implicated in the lipo-oxygenation of long-chain fatty acids. Both enzymes reduce molecular oxygen to produce pro-oxidant species, which, if not countered efficiently by antioxidants, create oxidative stress. Several of the factors regulating hepatic CYP2E1 and CYP4A expression have been linked to the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis and NASH. In the context of hepatic steatosis, both CYP2E1 and CYP4A generate the “second hit” of cellular injury, particularly when antioxidant reserves are depleted [95].

CYP2E1

It has been reported that CYP2E1 is overexpressed in the liver of patients with NASH [120]. Unlike alcoholic liver disease in which hepatic CYP2E1 activity subsides within days of discontinuing toxic alcohol intake, in the livers of NASH patients, CYP2E1 activity is persistently increased [120]. The distribution of CYP2E1 protein is in the perivenular (acinic zone 3) region, which corresponds to the site of maximal hepatocellular injury in NASH [2]. Depending on the inducing agent or physiological state, regulation of CYP2E1 operates at a variety of levels from transcriptional activation to posttranslational enzyme stability. High hepatic activity of CYP2E1 correlates with factors commonly associated with NASH, including fasting, obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia [120]. Interestingly, IR induces directly the increase of CYP2E1 by loss of the repressive effect of insulin. In a hepatocyte cell line, following insulin treatment, CYP2E1 overexpression reduced stimulatory tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 while increased inhibitory IRS-1 serine phosphorylation [40].

In parallel, the inactivation of the downstream effector kinase Akt and suppression of gluconeogenesis was observed [32]. Overall, these effects led to hyperglycemia and hepatic IR [26]. Increased CYP2E1 expression in hepatocytes and the presence of steatohepatitis result in the downregulation of insulin signaling, contributing, in part, to the IR [40]. Furthermore, the inhibition of insulin signaling by CYP2E1 overexpression is partially c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent. CYP2E1 overexpression induces activation of the MAPK [121]. Prominent among other signaling pathways affected by CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress are PKC and SOCS-3 [122]. CYP2E1 enhances NADPH oxidase activity, resulting in increased production of the ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by cycling redox of exogenous and endogenous substrates [122]. Therefore, IR and CYP2E1 expression may be interrelated through the ability of CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress to impair hepatic insulin signaling. In the absence of exogenous substrate, CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress is associated with the upregulation of collagen I, which is further enhanced by GSH depletion and is reversed by antioxidants [123]. Addition of substrates such as ethanol or arachidonic acid to HSCs expressing CYP2E1 activates collagen I gene expression largely than occurs spontaneously [91]. The intracellular generation of ROS is a signal for HSCs activation, confirming the role played by CYP2E1-derived oxidants in this process.

CYP4A

Long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids are metabolized by CYP4A, and the released dicarboxylic acids serve as substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation. Microsomal oxidation is usually a relatively minor pathway of fatty acid disposal, but CYP4A may be a crucial mediator in theadaptive response to the perturbations of hepatic lipid metabolism. Moreover, CYP4A may contribute to microsomal oxidative stress in the absence of CYP2E1. CYP4A gene is, in part, controlled by PPAR-α, a transcription factor managing genes involved with fatty acid β-oxidation and transport. Activated PPAR-α governs the expression of both peroxisomal and microsomal lipid oxidation pathways [124] and becomes important especially when CYP2E1 levels are low and polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulate. Activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation occurs when mitochondrial β-oxidation is impaired or saturated, which causes peroxisomal proliferation and increased release of H2O2, resulting in a final activation of lipid peroxidation and switch from steatosis to NASH [125]. The absence of AOX causes accumulation on long-chain fatty acids, resulting in the induction of CYP4A via PPAR-α activation [125]. Increased production of hydrogen peroxide generated by CYP4A-mediated oxidation of long-chain fatty acids results in cell injury and steatohepatitis. The involvement of CYP4A enzyme in this process is further supported by the demonstration that mice knockout for both PPAR-α and AOX do not develop steatohepatitis or mitochondrial injury [125]. These findings confirm the role of PPARα-induced genes, particularly members of the CYP4A family, in determining severity of steatosis and necroinflammatory injury in livers with defective peroxisomal β-oxidation.

Abnormalities of methionine/SAMe/betaine metabolism

Abnormalities in the hepatic trans-sulfuration/trans-methylation pathways on multiple levels may lead to the development of fatty liver and potentially to sensitization to TNF-induced hepatotoxicity. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is a metabolic intermediate in the trans-sulfuration pathway and is formed from methionine and ATP in a reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyl transferases (MAT) [126]. Because SAMe is a precursor for GSH synthesis, SAMe deficiency may result, in turn, in the GSH deficiency which is observed in many forms of liver disease [127]. In the trans-methylation pathway, SAMe is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). While SAMe levels tend to be low in most forms of liver disease, SAH levels are often elevated, as are homocysteine levels [127]. Homocysteine is an inducer of fatty liver [128]. Also, hepatic MAT is sensitive to oxidative stress; oxidation of cys 121, the active site of the enzyme located in its flexible loop, results in the loss of its activity [129]. Abnormal hepatic MAT activity in NASH patients could be due to the oxidation of this active site. Moreover, MAT1A knockout mice develop steatohepatitis with hepatic SAMe deficiency [130]. GSH is required for optimal expression of MAT activity in liver, and hepatic deficiency of MAT may, in part, be due to GSH deficiency. Another pathway for homocysteine restoration to methionine

involves the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, to produce 5-MTHF). Moreover, there is a frequent polymorphism in this gene that leads to decreased activity and may potentially induce fatty liver [131], as demonstrated in MTHFR knockout mice [131].

### Therapeutic strategies

The effects of various drugs on NAFLD including oral hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering agents, antioxidant compounds, antibiotics, and probiotics have been widely examined. Novel therapeutic strategies point toward the molecular basis of critical events involved in the development or progression of NAFLD. The principal crucial targets under investigation are molecules acting on tyrosine kinases, pro-lipogenic enzymes, and nuclear receptors related to impaired insulin signaling, peripheral lipolysis, reduced hepatic lipid oxidation, fatty-acids-induced organelle toxicity, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of HSCs [132].

Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) and metformin are the principal insulin-sensitizing agents employed in the management of NAFLD for their capacity to reduce aminotransferase levels and to improve histological grading [133]. Thiazolidinediones improve insulin sensitivity by stimulating adipocytes to increase uptake of FFAs and induce redistribution from liver fat to peripheral tissue [134]. Contrasting results in clinical trials have been obtained by thiazolidinediones of second-generation pioglitazone and rosiglitazone [134, 135]. Several studies report that rosiglitazone therapy induced increased crystalline inclusions in hepatocytes mitochondria, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy studies in liver biopsies, associated with the reduction of macrosteatosis and Mallory bodies, but no change was evident in microsteatosis, cellular enlargement, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, or apoptosis [136]. In contrast, other studies suggest that therapeutic benefit of thiazolidinedione treatment should be critically evaluated because suspension of treatment with either pioglitazone or rosiglitazone after 48 weeks abolishes the therapeutic effects on NASH, resulting in increased liver fat, inflammatory activity, and aggravation of histopathological scores [137].

Metformin, which reverses IR by acting on both hepatic glucose metabolism and glucose uptake and metabolism in skeletal muscle [138], improves hepatic steatosis and decreases TNF-α plasma level [139]. Metformin induces fatty acid oxidation and suppresses expression of lipogenic enzymes, likely reducing ACC activity and lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1 [140].

Encouraging results have been achieved by the use of lipid-lowering agents such as fibrates, statins, and probucol
[141]. Fibrates are ligands of PPAR-α; they affect lipid oxidation, reduce TG levels, and increase serum HDL by stimulating lipoprotein lipase and regulating apolipoprotein expression [142]. In particular, bezafibrate normalizes liver function and lipid metabolism, improving significantly hepatic steatosis [143]. A recent study reported that bezafibrate inhibits HSCs activation and fibrogenesis in a murine model of steatohepatitis, suggesting that fibrates could be used in the prevention of the disease progression [144].

Statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) decrease serum transaminases [145] and serum lipid levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and induce a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis [146]. Additionally, studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that statins improve insulin sensitivity and anti-inflammatory activity by mechanisms involving suppression of NF-κB activation or increasing iNOS mRNA stability [147, 148]. Various antioxidant compounds including radical scavenger vitamin E (α-tocopherol), β-carotene, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (*n*-3 PUFAs) are currently investigated in the management of NAFLD [149]. Dietary supplementation with vitamin E in patients with NASH is associated with significant improvement of histological grading and reduction of transaminases and TNF-α serum levels [150]. In patients with NAFLD, a combination of vitamin E with phospholipids and silymarin, an extract of milk thistle seed (silybum marianum), induces an improvement of hepatic steatosis and decreases transaminases, TGF-β, and TNF-α plasma levels [151]. Silymarin operates by preventing HSCs and Kupffer cells activation via reduction of ROS and leukotriene B4 synthesis [152]. Dietary supplementation with PUFAs improves NAFLD by preventing lipid peroxidation, positively influencing peripheral IR, activating PPAR-γ, and suppressing SREBP-1 [153]. Other antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances which exert positive therapeutic effects in NASH are *N*-Acetylcysteine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, taurine, and betaine [154]. *N*-Acetylcysteine acts as a cysteine donor for the biosynthesis of γ-glutamylcysteine, which is a substrate of GSH synthetase. S-adenosyl-L-methionine refills intracellular GSH and mitochondrial GSH to generate homocysteine and cysteine [98] and exerts anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects, decreasing production of TNF-α [155].

Since in NAFLD bacterial overgrowth in cooperation with the increased intestinal permeability are associated with pro-inflammatory stimulation and elevated TNF-α levels [156], antibiotics and probiotics have been also examined. Probiotics are bacteria that exert positive effects on their hosts and thus are supposed to normalize intestinal bacterial overgrowth in NAFLD [157]. Studies in *ob/ob* mice highlighted the putative therapeutic advantage of probiotics in NAFLD, which normalize fatty acid oxidation in mouse livers, alleviate steatosis, and reduce activity of JNK and NF-κB [158]. Probiotic VSL3 (a mixture of four lactobacilli strains) was found to improve plasma levels of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal [159].

Phosphotyrosine kinases and JNK1, which interfere with IRS signaling, represent the new targets for the treatment of IR [160]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of PKCε protects mice from fat-induced hepatic IR and leads to an increase of both insulin-stimulated AKT2 activity and IRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation [157]. Metformin treatment causes activation of the AMP-activated kinase and reduction of IRS-1 phosphorylation and a leftward shift in the insulin dose–response curve for PKB activation [161]. Furthermore, association of PPAR-γ coactivator-1 with functional polymorphisms in patients with IR and reduced activity of PPAR-γ coactivator-1 in NAFLD livers led to the idea that its activation may have advantageous effects in NAFLD [162].

The use of salicylates is related to their capability to reduce TNF-α-induced lipolysis [163] and to prevent inflammation by inhibition TNF-α-mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 as well as the phosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, and degradation of IKK-β [164] and inhibition of NF-κB [165].

A possible role for anti-inflammatory agents in the prevention of lipotoxic cell death has been proposed by the finding that phospholipase A2 inhibitors is able to block lipotoxic cell death induced by palmitate possibly mediated by reduction of LPC [166]. Likewise, inhibition of Foxo1, which protects against fatty-acids-induced apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress, has been recommended as a novel therapeutic strategy in NAFLD [167].

The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system has been suggested as a pharmaceutical target in NASH to prevent HSCs activation and fibrotic remodeling of the liver [168]. Moreover, in animal models of NASH, the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, telmisartan, reduced triglyceride, transaminases and TNF-α levels and suppressed fibrosis [169]. Telmisartan acts as a PPAR-γ agonist to reduce hepatic steatosis, in addition to its ability to block the renin–angiotensin pathway [169]. Remodeling processes during NASH are also experimentally approached by targeting nuclear receptors which are involved in the regulation of HSCs [170]. Troglitazone and 15 deoxy-Delta (12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) which are PPAR-γ agonists have antifibrotic effects, as they prevent proliferation of human HSCs probably by a mechanism antagonizing TGFβ1/Smad3 signaling [171]. Since lipid droplet fusion protein SNAP23 (a 23-kDa molecule resembling the 25-kDa synaptosome associated protein) mediates membrane fusion of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) vesicles in response to insulin [172], lipid droplet-associated proteins have been proposed as putative targets for the pharmacolog-
ical intervention in IR. Interestingly, reduction of intrahepatic malonyl-CoA levels by targeting ACC 1 and 2 with oligonucleotides was shown to lower hepatic lipid contents (e.g., long-chain acyl-CoAs, diacylglycerol, and TG) and to improve hepatic insulin sensitivity in an animal model of fat-induced NAFLD [173]. Therefore, lipid-droplet-associated proteins and lipid mediators in the inflammatory cross-talk of liver cells represent other promising targets in the therapy of NAFLD.

### Conclusions

NAFLD, being the main cause of abnormal liver function, is becoming a public health problem since it can progress to NASH, which, in a significant proportion of cases, may lead to end-stage liver disease, requiring transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The identification of the molecular mechanisms leading to fat accumulation and oxidative balance impairment in steatotic livers, as well as genome and proteome expression studies in tissue from patients with various stages of the disease, is expected to improve both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this light, attractive pharmacological designs include new molecules which modulate the activation of genes involved in the regulation of both microsomal and peroxisomal lipid oxidation pathways and would improve insulin sensitivity. Based on the evidence reported so far, any scheme enabling fatty livers to increase resistance against stressing conditions may help in guiding targeted treatment and prevention strategies.
