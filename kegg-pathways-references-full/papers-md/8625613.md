## INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

Growth hormone (GH) is expressed specifically from the somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary, and GH transcription is under both cell type-specific and hormonal control (Figure 1). As such, GH has become an important model for understanding the mechanism of cell type-specific control of gene expression during organ development. A significant number of recent reviews on GH and the control of GH expression have been published (1–12), including a recent comprehensive monograph (13). This review will focus on the most recent advances in the understanding of the control of GH expression. These areas will be covered in the comparative sense, connecting where possible results in the laboratory species with those in domestic animals. Additional comparisons will be made between genes specifically expressed in the anterior pituitary and somatotrophs to describe the current understanding of the somatotroph-specific expression of GH. The biologic activities of GH itself and the response to circulating GH will not be discussed. Interested readers are directed to current reviews of these subjects (13–19).

## GROWTH HORMONE—STRUCTURE AND EXPRESSION

GH gene and protein structure. The GH gene belongs to a large gene family that includes GH, prolactin (PRL), and the placental lactogens (also called chorionic somatomammotropins [CS]), which are thought to have arisen as a result of gene duplication (13,20,21). In most mammals, GH is a single gene, although in primates, there has been further duplication to generate a cluster of GH-like genes at a single genomic location. These include two GH genes, GH-N and GH-V, and three less related CS genes. The CS genes and the GH-V gene are expressed in placental tissue, whereas only the GH-N gene is expressed in the pituitary somatotrophs. The only other report of multiple GH genes concerned work in the goat, where cDNAs encoding GH genes were used to identify multiple putative GH genes (22). The GH gene has five exons and four introns, covering approximately 2.6 to 3.0 kilobase pairs (kbp) in most mammalian species, as well as in channel catfish (23) and Chinese grass carp (24). In chicken and rainbow trout, however, the GH gene is 3.5 and 4.5 kbp, respectively, because of larger intron sizes (25,26).

Alternative splicing of the human GH-N heterogeneous nuclear RNA leads to two mature mRNAs, which encode two polypeptides of 22 and 20 kDa, after the cleavage of a 26-amino-acid signal sequence (27). In circulation, a majority (70–75%) of human GH (hGH) protein is the 22-kDa form, where 5–10% is the 20-kDa form. In addition, about 8–12% of circulating hGH are deamidated versions of the 22-kDa isoform, 22K-Asp<sup>152</sup> and 22K-Glu<sup>137</sup>. Variants of bovine GH protein have also been identified (28). Glycosylation of human, rat, and chicken GH has also been postulated (27).

Control of GH expression in the pituitary. GH regulation can be divided into three levels: basal, cell type-specific and hormonally induced expression (see Figures 1 and 2). Basal or low-level expression is defined as that seen in nonpituitary cells and has been reviewed by others (8,13). Basal expression is controlled by several tissue-general factors that can act both positively and negatively. These include Sp1, NF-1/AP-2, and USF, as well as Zn-15, a newly identified zinc finger protein expressed in several cell types (29). High-level, somatotroph-specific GH expression is mainly controlled by the pituitary-specific factor PIT-1 (also called GHF-1 and PUF-1) and is discussed in detail later in this review. Environmental or hormonal control has also been extensively studied at the GH locus. Intracellular cAMP levels affect the proliferation of somatotrophs, as well as modulate GH synthesis (13). Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, TH) has a well-documented major role in the control of rat GH synthesis (30–40) and has been investigated in other species as well (13,41). In somatotrophic tumor cell lines, the addition of TH increases GH transcription, GH mRNA accumulation, and GH protein levels. In thyroidectomized rodents, GH mRNA and protein decrease significantly, whereas subsequent TH administration restores GH expression (42). Interestingly, pituitary-specific isoforms of the TH receptor (TRβ2) have been identified (43). TRβ2 mRNA accumulation was specifically decreased by TH treatment of pituitary cells in culture, whereas the nonpituitary-specific isoform TRβ1 was unaffected. Thus, TH may also have pituitary-

specific effects on gene regulation by acting to control the specific expression of its own receptors (43). Glucocorticoid (GC) addition, in vivo as well as in tissue culture models, increases GH gene expression (31,33). In tumor cell lines, retinoic acid (RA) stimulates GH transcription and protein synthesis (44–46). RA works synergistically with TH and GCs to activate GH expression. Activin (a member of the transforming growth factor β family) negatively regulates GH expression. Activin decreases both basal and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)-induced GH synthesis, primarily acting to decrease the level of the GH activator protein PIT-1, which in turn decreases GH mRNA synthesis (47). Insulin also suppresses GH promoter activity (48–50). In transfection studies, sequences within 500 base pairs (bp) of the hGH promoter were shown to contain insulin-responsive elements that bound factors responding to insulin treatment (50). The insulin control elements localized by DNA-protein-binding assays to the –290 to –252 region of the hGH promoter (50) overlap the NF-1/USF sites (Figure 2).

Neuroendocrine control of GH expression. GH Releasing Hormone. GHRH (also called GH-releasing factor), originally isolated from a human pancreatic tumor, was subsequently identified as a hypothalamic peptide that stimulated the release of GH from the pituitary. In addition, GHRH acts to stimulate GH synthesis through increasing intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn results in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (38,51). The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters also activated GH promoters in rat pituitary cells. At present, the precise mechanism by which cAMP activates the rat GH (rGH) promoter is unknown, although recent work indicates that the phosphorylation of specific regulatory proteins (see later section) may not be important (11).

Somatostatin. Somatostatin (SRIH), another hypothalamic peptide, represses GH secretion. The SRIH inhibition of GH release appears to be independent of GHRH as well as a direct block of GHRH action. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, SRIH

appears to prevent adenylate cyclase activation by GHRH or SRIH modulates Ca flux. It is not known if SRIH can affect GH synthesis directly, but it may do so by altering the intracellular cAMP concentration in opposition to GHRH action.

# IDENTIFICATION AND EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION OF GH TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL ELEMENTS

**Cell type–specific regulatory elements.** The flanking DNA elements of the GH gene have been studied in several species, most extensively in human and rat (2,3,8), but more recently in chicken (25) and trout (52,53). Previous reviews have noted the high level of conservation of regulatory elements (1,3,8,10,54) (see Figure 2). By the cotransfection of DNA flanking the GH gene fused to reporter genes into cell lines expressing GH, the regulatory region required for the cell type–specific control of GH expression was identified (55,56). Additional in vitro techniques, including DNase I footprinting and other DNA protein interaction analyses, were subsequently used to identify the regulatory factors binding the rGH elements. Two elements in particular, at –140 to –110 and at –99 to –69 bp relative to transcription initiation (+1), were important for GH expression in pituitary-derived cells. These elements bound proteins found in nuclear extracts from these cell types and did not bind protein found in nuclear extracts from cell types that did not produce GH (56–61). Transgenic mouse analysis of these rGH regulatory elements found that only the proximal 180 bp of the rGH 5′ sequence fused to the hGH gene were required for expression specifically in the pituitary (62). If a 133-bp-shorter rGH 5′ sequence were fused to the hGH gene, no expression was observed in the transgenic mice, indicating that the –180 to –47 sequence was critical for pituitary expression. Thus, the transgenic analysis supported the tissue culture data, indicating that the identified elements were relevant in vivo.

Most work in describing regulatory elements has been done with the human and rat GH genes, and there is good evidence that for mammals, the human and rat models of GH gene expression are appropriate (29). Much of the 180 bp of 5′ flanking region required for pituitary-specific expression in rats is highly conserved between the rat and the bovine, porcine, ovine, and caprine GH genes (29). In Figure 2, the current state of knowledge regarding regulatory elements in these and other species is depicted. The GH 5′ flanking sequences of the chicken and channel catfish contain elements similar to binding sites for the required pituitary-specific activator PIT-1 (23,25). Little additional sequence homology in these species to the mammalian GH regulatory region was seen, however. In the rainbow trout, several elements with sequence homology to mammalian pituitary-specific elements have been identified (52). These elements are protected by rat pituitary proteins in DNase I protection analyses, and one of these elements, at –182 to –151, was bound by pituitary protein from both rat GC pituitary tumor cell extracts and trout pituitary extracts. The rainbow trout GH promoter also functioned in rat GC cells and could be induced by a cAMP analogue (52), indicating that pituitary-specific control may be highly conserved across many vertebrate species.

**Hormone-responsive GH regulatory elements. TH.** Regulatory elements at the GH locus that control the response to hormones have been characterized. TH response elements (TREs) have been identified between –254 and –241 and between –209 and –166 of the rGH gene that are responsible for rapid TH-induced increases in transcription (61,63), although TH receptor (TR) binding to an additional region at –172 to –109 has been observed (37,64–67). TH induced rapid binding of both the TRE and cell type–specific elements at the rGH gene in vivo (68). This analysis, which used in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting at the rat GH gene, also showed little occupancy of these sites in GC cells in the absence of hormone treatment. Transcriptional activation of an rGH promoter

by TH was also demonstrated in an in vitro transcriptional assay that used GH₃ cell extracts (40). TH-dependent rGH transcription was independent of PIT-1-binding sites on the promoter, indicating that TR may act directly on the transcriptional apparatus to activate GH expression in the presence of TH (40). On the other hand, in vivo experiments indicate that PIT-1 and TR can act synergistically (69). In the cotransfection of a rat PIT-1 expression vector, a TR expression vector, and an rGH promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter construct into human U937 macrophage cells, either PIT-1 protein or TR could induce CAT expression. Induction was markedly enhanced when both expression vectors were included in the cotransfection; however, induction was observed only when phorbol esters and forskolin were added to increase cAMP levels (69). Synergistic activation did not require TH, although TH addition slightly enhanced the stimulatory effect on the rGH promoter. To investigate the requirements for the specific arrangement of rGH regulatory protein-binding sites, the spacing of elements was changed by the insertion of DNA between the TRE and the neighboring pituitary-specific elements (70). Insertions between the TRE and pituitary-specific elements did not affect cAMP responsiveness, but hormonal regulation was reduced, indicating that the spacing of the TRE and PIT-1 element is critical for TH responsiveness. Human GH TR-binding sites were localized to –290 to –129 and –124 to –87 (66,71). Although some of the sequence motifs in the rat and human TREs are conserved (61,63), these elements are inhibitory at the hGH promoter. While bound at the hGH TRE, TR may overlap the Sp1 and/or the pituitary-specific activation sites, causing steric hindrance of positively acting factors. This may explain the repressive effects seen by TH in primary bovine pituitary culture (72) or in several primate systems (73–75). Because TH administration has a stimulatory effect in many systems, additional mechanisms involving DNA elements beyond the 5′ flanking TREs must be present. TREs that stimulate GH expression have been identified in the 3′ flanking region of hGH (75) and in the third intron of the rGH gene (76). In contrast, a TRE in the proximal 3′-untranslated region of the human GH gene was shown to have a negative effect on hGH gene expression in rat GC cell cotransfection assays (77). These contradictory results emphasize the important role played by the specific arrangement of regulatory elements at the gene they control and show the hazards of analyzing a regulatory element outside its normal context and/or in isolation from other regulatory elements.

RA. A derivative of vitamin A, RA is important in embryonic development, in reproduction, and in the growth of many cell types across vertebrate species (78). Specific RA receptors (RAR) may also bind the GH promoter to effect the RA induction of GH expression (44–46). Induction by RA acts in synergism with TH, and RA induction requires a TRE to be present on the induced promoter DNA (79). RA may also independently act via its own receptor, which can bind TREs at the rat GH gene (79–80). Also possible are protein:protein dimerization or other interactions between RAR molecules and TR molecules or the related retinoid X receptor (RXR) molecules, which could then activate the GH promoter. As well, another nuclear receptor, the COUP protein, can repress RAR activity (81). Thus, multiple receptor interactions are possible at the GH promoter.

GCs. GH expression is stimulated by GC (31,33). By using 5′ sequences fused to a heterologous promoter, a GC-responsive element was mapped to –111 to –97 in the rGH promoter (82). However, in the context of the entire 1.8-kbp rat GH promoter, no response to GC was observed (37). Another group showed that a significant portion of the GC induction of rGH expression in GH₃ cells was posttranscriptional (83). In humans, GC increases GH mRNA levels, and GC-responsive elements were identified at –245 to –206 and +97 to +111 (74,84–86). GC also appears to stabilize hGH mRNA (87).

Negative GH regulatory elements. Besides elements identified as required for the stimulation of the GH promoter, negatively acting elements have been recognized (88). In the rat, a proximal silencer element (silencer-1) at –325 to –280 has been shown to repress GH promoter activity through the binding of repressor proteins in many cell types. However, the silencer-1 element does not bind protein, nor does it have an apparent activity, in pituitary cells (89). This DNA element has strong sequence similarity to the well-characterized NF1 DNA-binding motif, although the 45-kDa protein binding silencer-1 is apparently a different protein (89). It is also possible that the silencer-1-binding protein(s) is a member of a family of NF1-related proteins; the 30-kDa NF1 protein from rat liver (NF1-L) can bind the silencer-1 elements, and antibodies to the NF1-L DNA-binding domain will cross-react with silencer-1-binding proteins (90). However, NF1-L alone cannot repress basal rGH activity (91), and several additional proteins binding the silencer-1 element have been identified. One protein, SBP2, is found in all cell types examined, except for those in pituitary and pituitary-derived cells in culture. The SBP2-binding element, when placed upstream of a heterologous promoter-reporter fusion, can mediate repression in nonpituitary cells but not in pituitary cell types (91). A more distal element at –500 binds an uncharacterized protein with negative effects on rGH transcription (92). In humans, two repressive elements controlling GH expression have been identified. At –169 to –152, a protein (called PREB) binds to the GH promoter in nonpituitary cells to repress GH expression (93). In addition, because of the unique cluster of multiple, highly related GH-like genes in primates (the GH-placental lactogen [PL] cluster), an additional mechanism has evolved to silence all copies of the cluster, save for the hGH-N gene, which alone expresses GH in the pituitary. Nachtigal and coworkers have identified a repressive sequence motif present in the 5′ flanking DNA of all of the GH-PL cluster genes except for the hGH-N gene (94). This element binds pituitary-specific factor (PSF-1), which apparently represses genes with this PSF-1 element. Placental expression of the PL and hGH-V genes is thus due to the lack of PSF-1 in the placenta, which despite its name, is otherwise found in many tissues other than pituitary.

Additional mechanisms repressing GH gene expression have been identified. Increased gene-specific methylation at cytosine bases at rGH has been correlated with rGH repression in nonpituitary cell types (95,96). A specific sequence containing a ThaI site (CGCG) was completely methylated in the DNA from nonpituitary tissues (brain, kidney, liver, spleen) but hypomethylated in pituitary DNA (95). Similar correlations between the methylation state and expression have been observed at the hGH gene (97). The suppression of methyltransferase activity also increases GH expression in GH₃ cells three- to eightfold, indicating that methylation may act to decrease GH expression, even in pituitary cell types (98).

A major mechanism limiting GH expression in nonpituitary tissues is the lack of expression of activator protein (PIT-1). As discussed in the next section, PIT-1 is a pituitary-specific activator of GH and plays a major role in both GH activation and pituitary development. Somatic cell hybrids between pituitary and fibroblast cells exhibited a loss of GH and/or PRL expression (88,99,100). The extinction of PIT-1 expression was also observed in these hybrid cells, indicating that a loss of PIT-1 expression is a likely cause of GH extinction (99).

### PIT-1 AS A CONSERVED PITUITARY CELL TYPE–SPECIFIC ACTIVATOR

PIT-1: structure and function across species. The first pituitary-specific factor identified was PIT-1 (also called GHF-1 and PUF-1), which has been extensively studied during the last 8 years. The study of PIT-1 expression and function in controlling anterior pituitary development and gene activity has been extremely fruitful. Through the analysis

of PIT-1 interactions with the GH, PRL, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)β promoter elements and other regulatory factors, much has been learned regarding cell type-specific gene control. As discussed later in this review, there is also strong genetic evidence of the role of PIT-1 in pituitary cell proliferation, because several independent mutations in PIT-1 lead to hypopituitarism in mice and humans.

PIT-1 is a 291-amino-acid (aa) protein with an NH₂-terminal transactivation domain and a DNA-binding POU domain (see Figure 3). PIT-1 is a founding member of the POU domain family of genes, defined in 1988 when several transcriptional regulatory genes (PIT-1, Oct-1, Oct-2, unc-86) were cloned and a common segment was discovered (101). The 150- to 160-aa region POU domain segment encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain critical for the function of each member of the POU domain family (102,103). The POU domain is split into two well-conserved regions, separated by a poorly conserved linker region. The C-terminal half, called the POU-homeobox domain, encodes a low-affinity DNA-binding domain, whereas the N-terminal half, called the POU-specific domain, confers high affinity to the POU domain and participates in protein-protein interactions (104,105). Homeodomain regions are hallmarks of proteins involved in cell differentiation pathways and developmental signaling cascades (106,107), and PIT-1 is required for the development and maintenance of the somatotroph cell type in anterior pituitary development (see later section).

PIT-1 was first identified as a factor specific to pituitary cells that bound elements required for the pituitary-specific expression of the GH and PRL genes (60,108–110). Subsequent protein purification and cDNA cloning led to the definition of PIT-1 (also called GHF-1) (111,112). Transfected PIT-1 has been shown to transactivate a cotransfected GH or PRL promoter in HeLa cells (110,112) and rat2 cells (113), indicating that PIT-1 may be the limiting factor for GH synthesis in these cells. Strong genetic evidence of the requirement for PIT-1 in GH, PRL, and TSHβ expression was obtained in an analysis of several dwarf mouse strains. Snell dwarf (*dw*) and Jackson dwarf (*dw-J*) mice

have mutations in the PIT-1 gene causing a lack of the above three pituitary hormones (103). These mice also have severe hypopituitarism, lacking somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs, thus complicating the connection between the PIT-1 mutation and the lack of GH expression. However, a PIT-1 mutation has been found in a family with dwarfism and no GH synthesis in affected individuals, who do not show hypopituitarism (114). This result is stronger evidence of a direct role for PIT-1 in GH expression. A final proof awaits rescue of the dwarf phenotype and restored GH synthesis by a PIT-1 transgene expressed in the pituitaries of $d w$ mice. Although PIT-1 protein is one of the most specifically expressed transcription factors known, being limited to the somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs, this expression pattern indicates that PIT-1 protein is not sufficient for GH synthesis because GH is not expressed in the lactotroph or thyrotroph lineages, which express the PIT-1 protein. Either additional required factors are absent in these cell types yet present in promiscuous HeLa cells, or active repression of GH synthesis occurs in lactotroph and thyrotroph cells. Even within somatotrophs, PIT-1 function alone is not sufficient for GH expression. Transgenes containing only the PIT-1-binding sites near the rGH promoter are expressed in the pituitary at very low levels, although transgenes with additional genomic rGH regions express at high levels, specifically in the pituitary (115).

PIT-1 cDNA and/or genomic regions have been cloned from rat (111, 112, 116), cow (111), human (117–119), turkey (120), salmon (121), pig (122), trout (53), and chicken (D. Foster, personal communication). In all species tested thus far, PIT-1 has six exons and five introns, spanning about 1.6 to 2.0 kbp. Several variant mRNA transcripts with fewer exons (123, 124; T.-P. Yu and C.K. Tuggle, unpublished observations) or with larger exons (116, 125, 126) have been identified (see later section). PIT-1 is a single locus in the vertebrate genome (112, 118). In the mammalian species, PIT-1 protein is highly conserved, being 90–94% identical across the entire protein and 97–99% identical in the crucial POU domain region. The much larger salmon (365 aa) and trout (358 aa) proteins are less homologous overall (69%) to the mammalian proteins, although the POU domain region is highly conserved. Both the salmon and the trout PIT-1 POU domains are 86% identical to the rat PIT-1 POU domain. The turkey PIT-1 POU domain is even more conserved, at 94% identity with the rat cDNA. Rainbow trout PIT-1 is also conserved at the functional level, because trout PIT-1 binds the trout GH promoter at sites with the same consensus sequence as its mammalian counterparts (53). Outside the POU domain, there are specific sequences in several species, notably fish, where large insertions in the NH$_{2}$-terminal regions account for the significantly larger PIT-1 mature proteins. The reported turkey PIT-1 is also unique, in that it has a species-specific exon inserted between sequences that have similarity to the mammalian exons two and three (120).

**PIT-1 action at other genes.** PRL is expressed specifically in lactotroph and the lactotroph precursor cells, the somatomammotrophs (also called mammosomatotropes; 127). In transgenic mice, duplicating this specific endogenous PRL expression pattern requires two cis-acting elements, proximal and distal, of the 5′ flanking region of the PRL gene (128). PIT-1 is expressed in lactotrophs and lactotroph precursors and is known to interact with several other regulatory factors to activate the PRL promoter (129, 130). The PRL distal enhancer mediates the response to several hormones including estradiol (131). Within the distal enhancer, binding sites for PIT-1 are required for estradiol response, and the coexpression of PIT-1 and the estrogen receptor (ER) in heterologous COS-1 cells led to a marked induction of distal PRL enhancer-reporter fusion genes (129). Elements proximal to the PRL promoter also bind PIT-1 to mediate PRL transcriptional induction by cAMP (132, 133) or thyroid-releasing hormone (134). Mutational analysis of PIT-1 binding sites in the proximal and distal regulatory regions indicates that the PIT-1 site
adjacent to the estrogen response element is most crucial for estrogen response, although other PIT-1 sites contribute to the strength of the overall response (135). PIT-1 has been shown to activate the salmon PRL (sPRL) gene. The sPRL promoter functions poorly in rat GH₄ cells, as does the rat PRL (rPRL) promoter in primary fish pituitary cells (136). However, salmon PIT-1 could activate either the sPRL or rPRL promoters in HeLa cells, indicating that PIT-1 function at the PRL gene is conserved across vertebrate species but that PIT-1 is not the most crucial determinant for the marked species-specific activity of the sPRL and rPRL promoters (136). PIT-1 also participates in the dopamine-regulated inhibition of PRL synthesis, which acts through D2 receptors and inhibitory G proteins (137). PIT-1-binding sites can confer dopamine responsiveness to heterologous promoters. Gain-of-function mutants in the appropriate G proteins mimic the dopamine-induced PRL inhibition, and this effect is dependent on PIT-1-binding sites on the transfected promoter construct (137).

Thyrotropin β subunit (TSHβ) is expressed specifically in the thyrotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is an important regulator of TSHβ expression, likely acting through PKC pathways. TRH increases TSHβ promoter activity in cotransfection studies in GH₃ pituitary cells (138). PIT-1 is also expressed in thyrotrophs and appears to be involved in the maintenance of TSHβ gene expression. Because PIT-1 is first expressed after the appearance of TSHβ-expressing cells, PIT-1 is not thought to be involved in the initial activation of TSHβ expression (4). However, a recent report indicates that the early population of thyrotrophs (pre-PIT-1 expression) is located on the rostral tip of the developing mouse pituitary and that this population disappears by birth (139). A second population of thyrotrophs appears at embryonic day (ED) 15.5 in the caudomedial portion of the fetal pituitary, just after the initial appearance of PIT-1 protein in this region. Interestingly, in Snell dwarf mice, which are defective in PIT-1 function, these latter thyrotrophs fail to appear, indicating that PIT-1 is necessary for the differentiation of these thyrotroph cells (139). Further, PIT-1 binds to TRH-response regions of the rat TSHβ gene (140,141) and to regions of the mouse TSHβ promoter (139,142). Cotransfection studies indicate that PIT-1 can activate the rTSHβ promoter in human fetal kidney–derived 293 cells (141) and activate the mTSHβ promoter in HeLa cells (139). However, in TtT-97 thyrotropic tumor cells, which express TSHβ, coexpressed PIT-1 did not activate a mouse TSHβ-luciferase promoter fusion, indicating that PIT-1 is not the limiting factor in these thyrotroph-derived cells (142). The level of cAMP, thought to act through PKA, also regulates TSHβ expression. TRH and cAMP response elements at the human TSHβ (hTSHβ) promoter bind PIT-1 (143,144). The coexpression of PIT-1 and an hTSHβ-reporter gene allowed a response to cAMP stimulation in 293 cells, but without PIT-1, no response to cAMP stimulation by forskolin was seen (144). PIT-1 may thus be required for cAMP stimulation of the TSHβ gene in vivo. Accordingly, PIT-1 can be phosphorylated in vivo by both PKA and PKC, and phosphorylated PIT-1 binds TSHβ elements more strongly and GH or PRL elements less well as compared with nonphosphorylated PIT-1 (145). Differences in the PIT-1-binding site sequences among these three genes were proposed to explain the differential effect of phosphorylation on PIT-1 binding (145). PIT-1 binding to sites at the human TSHβ promoter at –128 to –61 relative to the start of transcription have also been implicated in the response to phorbol esters, forskolin, and TRH (146). A cofactor with PIT-1 is an AP-1-like factor that binds to a sequence motif at –1 to +6 that has homology to phorbol ester and cAMP response elements. Although not apparently synergistic, both PIT-1 and this AP-1-like factor are required to bind to their respective elements for the induction at hTSHβ through the activation of the PKA-, PKC-, or the TRH-mediated pathways (146).

PIT-1 expression patterns during development. In all species investigated, high-level PIT-1 mRNA expression is limited to the anterior pituitary. In the rat, all five cell types of the anterior pituitary express PIT-1 mRNA (147, 148). PIT-1 mRNA expression begins in the developing pituitary at ED16 in the rat and ED13.5 in the mouse (147, 148). Low-level PIT-1 expression in the ED10–13 (149) or ED11 (147) rat neural tube has also been reported. This expression diminished after ED13, and anterior pituitary expression then appeared at ED16.5, as seen by others. A major 2.3- to 2.5-kilobase (kb) PIT-1 transcript and minor 1.25- and 4.5 kb transcripts were observed in rat (112), while a single 2.4 kb human transcript has been detected (114). Another group (111) showed rat mRNA transcript sizes of 3.1 kb (major) and 4.0 kb (minor). Pig PIT-1 transcripts of 4.5 and 3.3 kb were found in the pituitary of both 3-wk-old and adult animals, although the shorter transcript in the young animals was much less abundant than in adults (150). Because GH levels decrease with age, this apparent lack of a concomitant decrease in PIT-1 mRNA levels in the pig would be interesting to investigate in the rodent species. Turkey PIT-1 mRNA expression levels were examined during the female reproductive cycle, during which PRL levels rise to a maximum at mid- to late egg incubation before falling drastically at egg hatching (120). No change in the levels of the 3.5-kb PIT-1 transcript was observed over this period, indicating that the steady-state level of PIT-1 mRNA does not explain the changes in PRL expression in incubating turkey hens. Additional, shorter PIT-1 transcripts of 1.2 and 2.7 kb were inferred from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in the turkey (120). A lack of correlation between GH expression levels and PIT-1 mRNA was seen in diabetic rats (151). GH mRNA and protein levels are decreased fivefold in these rats compared with the levels observed in normal rats. Thyroidectomy results in a further decrease to 5% of the normal GH levels. No change in PIT-1 mRNA levels before or after thyroidectomy was seen (151). In these latter two reports, no measurement of PIT-1 protein was performed, leaving open the possibility that PIT-1 protein levels do vary to control PRL and GH, respectively. As seen below, there is evidence for a decoupling of PIT-1 mRNA and protein expression during pituitary development.

Accumulated PIT-1 protein is not detected until ED16–17 in rat and ED15.5 in mouse, indicating that there is a lag of 0–1 (147) to 2 d (148) in protein expression after mRNA expression and that PIT-1 protein accumulates at about the time of GH accumulation in the pituitary. A more important difference between mRNA and protein expression concerns the discovery that PIT-1 protein is found only in the three cell types producing somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs (147), not in the gonadotrophs and corticotrophs, which express PIT-1 mRNA. PIT-1 is thus regulated posttranscriptionally as a function of cell type. PIT-1 protein has recently been detected at low levels in nonpituitary tissue and in lymphoid and hematopoietic cells, where low levels of GH production are also seen (152).

Regulation of PIT-1 expression. The flanking regions of the rat, mouse, turkey, and human PIT-1 gene have been isolated, and the rodent elements required for pituitary-specific expression and response to hormone and morphogens have been characterized (114, 153–157). Sequences from –200 to the start of transcription are sufficient for low-level pituitary-specific expression in tissue culture (153, 155), although an enhancer that increases expression in cell lines has been localized to –1800 to –850 (155). In the –200 to +1 region, there is one PIT-1-binding site, which is bound by bacterially produced PIT-1 protein (153–155). This PIT-1-binding site is required for transcription from the PIT-1 promoter. The cotransfection of a PIT-1-expressing vector with a PIT-1 promoter fused to a reporter gene into several cell types showed that PIT-1 can activate its own promoter (153–155). Another PIT-1 site was identified at +4 to +34 that showed negative

action; mutation of this site increased the expression of the PIT-1 promoter in GC or CV-1 cells (155). However, this site was a positive regulator if placed 5′ to the promoter. This result indicated that either steric hindrance of the transcription machinery or transcriptional arrest could be a mechanism of repression from the 3′ site. Placing this 3′ site downstream of the PRL promoter decreased the amount of PRL mRNA accumulation (158). However, in this study, the PIT-1 site was placed farther 3′ than seen in its native location at the PIT-1 locus; thus, these results did not exclude steric hindrance as a contributing factor at the PIT-1 gene. Sequences related to PIT-1 recognition elements have also been identified in the turkey PIT-1 gene at –290 and –70 relative to the start of translation (E. Wong, personal communication).

Several elements were shown to be important for high-level pituitary-specific expression of PIT-1 in vivo. A very small (15-bp) region centered at the TATA box is sufficient for pituitary-specific expression in cell culture (154). This element is bound by a cell type–specific factor distinct from PIT-1 and from TFIID, the conserved TATA box–binding factor (159). This pituitary-specific element does not exist at the GH or PRL promoters, indicating that this type of regulation is unique to the PIT-1 gene. The authors speculate that this element may exert necessarily tighter cell-specific control over the transcription factor PIT-1, especially because the PIT-1 gene is self-stimulated (154). Another major expression element has been identified in the mouse PIT-1-flanking DNA and lies far 5′, about 10 kbp, from the promoter. This 0.5- to 0.7-kbp region was identified in transgenic mice and in subsequent tissue culture experiments to be required for high-level pituitary-specific expression, and an extensive set of experiments was performed to characterize this complex regulatory region (156). Three functional PIT-1-binding sites are present in the PIT-1 flanking region; these sites bind PIT-1 protein in vitro, and promoter activity is greatly decreased when these sites are mutated. In addition, two elements were identified that are required for the hormonal stimulation of the PIT-1 promoter by the RAR or by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), named the PRE and RDE, respectively. Cotransfection of these receptors with various native and mutant PIT-1 flanking sequences that were fused to reporter genes identified these sites as required for hormone receptor–induced activation in GC cell culture. The RDE was bound in vitro by VDR and, to a lesser extent, bound RAR in the presence of RXRα, a ubiquitous activator protein with similar properties. In GC cells, similar complexes were observed as those observed in vitro, indicating that heterodimer formation between VDR and RXRα was necessary for binding to the RDE. The PRE element is bound by RAR but is bound strongly only in the presence of the PIT-1 protein, which had a binding site in close proximity to the PRE (156). The cotransfection of PIT-1 and RAR had a strong synergistic effect to stimulate PIT-1 expression. Altering the spacing of the PIT-1-binding site and the PRE significantly decreased this synergism. Overall, these investigations revealed multiple, complex interactions at the PIT-1 distal enhancer, primarily requiring PIT-1 to synergistically work with hormone receptors to autoregulate its own promoter (156). The RAR response element PRE is unusual in that it is dependent on PIT-1 for full function. The PIT-1 promoter is also responsive to cAMP levels. McCormick and coworkers showed that the level of rat PIT-1 mRNA increased in response to forskolin (153). The DNA elements required for this response to increased cAMP levels were localized to –200 to –90 relative to the transcriptional start site. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), an inducer of the PKC pathway, caused no response at the PIT-1 promoter (153). This region has two cAMP response elements (CRE), and these elements bind the CRE-binding protein (CREB) in vitro (153,155). It is interesting to note that a search of the human 5′ flanking sequence (extending to –420 bp) shows no CRE elements, indicating that human PIT-1 may not be sensitive, at least through the CREB protein pathway, to variation in
cAMP concentration, as seen in the rat. More recently, Jong and coworkers looked at this induction at the rat PIT-1 gene more closely. They observed a small (twofold) induction by dexamethasone (DEX) or TPA addition for 48 hr to GH₄C1 cells (157). However, a 20-fold synergistic effect was observed if DEX and TPA are added together. This synergism required the presence of DEX but not TPA early in the induction period. At least 36 hr of DEX treatment was required for the full effect to be observed. The DNA sequence required for this response was localized to the –210 to –142 region of the PIT-1 promoter, which contains the two CREs. No change in the level of protein binding to a CRE was observed in gel mobility shift assays, so the response was not due to increased binding of CREB. If PKA activity was inhibited in the induction period, no synergistic activation of the PIT-1 promoter was observed. An overall model of DEX/TPA induction was proposed as follows (157). DEX induces a protein factor that is then phosphorylated by PKC. The phosphorylated product then activates the PIT-1 promoter, with PKA apparently acting at an unknown but required step along this pathway.

**PIT-1 mRNA and protein variants.** The PIT-1 mRNA produces two proteins of 33 and 31 kDa that are capable of binding to regulatory elements. This is due to the use of alternative initiator met codons (160), although no functional difference between the two resulting proteins was detected. PIT-1 mRNA also exists in several alternatively spliced forms, some of which have been shown to produce PIT-1 proteins with altered properties (PIT-1β, PIT-1T, PIT-1Δ4, PIT-1Δ3) (see Figure 3).

**PIT-1β.** The first reported alternative splice event results in a PIT-1 protein with 26 additional aa inserted at the start of Exon 2 (116,125,126). This insertion is in the gene activation domain, and the larger protein is called PIT-1β (also called GHF-2, and PIT-1a). In tissue culture systems, the larger isoform activates the GH promoter more strongly than it activates the PRL (125), TSHβ (161), or PIT-1 (116) promoters. PIT-1β can bind the promoter DNA at the TSHβ and PIT-1 genes, but it is nearly inactive in transactivation. However, one group has reported some PRL activation by PIT1β in mouse Ltk⁻ and HeLa cell cotransfection (125). DNA binding by PIT1β resulted in an altered complex in gel shift mobility assays (126), but the DNA protected by PIT1β was shown to be identical to that protected by the “normal” PIT-1 isoform, which is now called PIT-1α (125). Differences in complex formation apparently affect the ability of the complex to activate transcription at the PRL and TSHβ genes. However, it is also possible that PIT-1β is deficient in its ability to interact with the additional factors required for transactivation. RNase protection analysis showed that in GH₃ cells and in pituitaries, PIT-1β mRNA is present at approximately 15% of the level of the previously reported PIT-1 transcript (116). PCR analysis of mouse pituitary cDNA showed similar results (125). PIT-1β protein expression was found to be even more limited, estimated at 3% of PIT-1α protein. Some authors have attributed this to the instability of the PIT-1β protein (125,126). The inability of PIT-1β to activate the PRL or the TSHβ gene has led to the suggestion that insignificant levels of PIT-1β, specifically in somatotrophs, could explain the lack of PRL/TSHβ expression in this cell type, which expresses PIT-1 protein as determined by non-isoform-specific PIT-1 antibody staining (9). This explanation would require differential regulation of alternative splicing at the PIT-1 gene between somatotrophs and lactotrophs, which has not yet been demonstrated. It is worthwhile to note that the trout and turkey PIT-1 proteins resemble most closely the PIT-1β variant (53,120). However, the reported turkey PIT-1 transcript is less abundant than a longer transcript seen in RNase protection experiments using 5′ specific probes (120). Further, a PIT-1 exon sequence corresponding to the first exon in the PIT-1α isoform has been identified in RT-PCR experiments; thus, turkeys may also produce PIT-1α (E. Wong, personal communication).

**PIT-1T.** A second alternative splice that adds only 14 aa to Exon 2 has also been
reported (161,162). Interestingly, this variant appears to be specifically expressed in thyrotrophs and thyrotroph-derived cell lines (TtT97 cells) and has been called PIT-1T. RNase protection shows that only about 2% of PIT-1 transcripts are PIT-1T. PIT-1T protein expression was low in TtT97 cells, and it was absent in GH₃ cells. Cotransfection experiments indicate that PIT-1T stimulates TSHβ expression but not GH or PRL expression in TtT97 cells. Stimulation was only observed if such protein was added by transfection to cells missing PIT-1α protein (162). These results indicate that PIT-1α and PIT-1T interact to activate TSHβ transcription and that this interaction is necessary and specific for the TSHβ promoter (161). Two specific regulatory elements in the TSHβ promoter were identified that mediate this stimulation, both of which are necessary for maximal effect.

PIT-1Δ3. In preliminary analyses of pig PIT-1 transcripts, a new putative splicing variant was observed (Figure 4; T.-P. Yu and C.K. Tuggle, unpublished data). By the use of 3′ pig cDNA sequence and consensus 5′ untranslated sequence from the human/rat/bovine genes to design primers for PCR, DNA fragments were amplified from pig 3-wk-old or adult animal pituitary cDNA. Several specific amplified bands were shown to contain PIT-1 5′ sequence by hybridization. Sequencing these products revealed that one of these fragments was the full-length transcript encoding PIT-1α, whereas a shorter fragment was missing (exactly) the entire 75-aa Exon 3 (PIT-1Δ3). Further PCR using additional primer sets also amplified a 225-bp-shorter transcript, indicating that PIT-1Δ3 was not a PCR artifact of the original primers used. In DNA:protein-binding assays, bacterially expressed pig PIT-1Δ3 did not recognize the rat GH promoter elements, whereas similarly produced pig PIT-1α was active (T.-P. Yu and C.K. Tuggle, unpublished data). Although the existence of PIT-1Δ3 protein needs to be confirmed by specific antibody staining, these preliminary data indicate that PIT-1 in pigs has alternative spliced products that show differential binding. It would be of interest to determine if PIT-1Δ3 can bind other PIT-1-binding sequences, such as the proximal or distal PRL sites or the PIT-1Δ4 Site A (123), which is discussed in the next section.

PIT-1Δ4. A further alternative splicing event, which removes Exon 4, which encodes the POU-specific region, has been reported (123,124). In culturing previously transplanted GH₃ cells, one group noted that smaller forms of PIT-1 appeared at times when PRL expression increased. RT-PCR detected a unique PIT-1 transcript that followed the time course of both PRL induction and the appearance of the small PIT-1 isoforms (124). After cloning and sequencing, this transcript was shown to encode a PIT-1 protein missing Exon

4 (PIT-1Δ4), which encodes nearly the entire POU-specific domain of PIT-1. This PIT-1Δ4 transcript and protein were shown to exist in normal pituitaries (4, 124). The loss of Exon 4 affected the binding specificity of PIT-1Δ4, although specific binding to a subset of PIT-1-binding sites was observed and DNA footprinting analysis showed that PIT-1α and PIT-1Δ4 bind DNA indistinguishably. Although DNA sequences could be found to which PIT-1Δ4 bound, this binding did not result in the transactivation of GH in cotransfection experiments (4). PIT-1Δ4 transfer alone (GH₃ cells) or with PIT-1α (rat-1 cells) showed that this isoform represses the expression of a cotransfected PRL-luciferase reporter construct, presumably by interfering with PIT1α function (124). The POU-specific region appears to act in a modular manner with the POU homeodomain to specify DNA binding to specific sites and also to act together with more N-terminal regions to activate transcription in a nonmodular cooperative fashion (4). The PIT1Δ4 variant has also been amplified and sequenced from pig pituitary mRNA by the use of techniques similar to those described above for PIT1Δ3 (T.-P. Yu and C.K. Tuggle, unpublished observations) but has not been reported in other species.

# COUPLING OF PIT-1 AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AT THE GH LOCUS

PIT-1 has been implicated in GH promoter activation in response to increases in intracellular cAMP levels because DNA sites bound by PIT-1 are involved in the cAMP response (38, 51, 163). In studies in human U937 macrophage cells using the cotransfection of a rat PIT-1 expression vector and an rGH promoter-CAT reporter construct, PIT-1 protein could induce CAT expression. However, this induction was observed only when phorbol esters and forskolin were added to increase the cAMP levels within the U937 cells (69). In response to phorbol esters or cAMP treatment, the phosphorylation of PIT-1 has been detected at a highly conserved residue (^{220}Thr) in the POU homeodomain and shown to modify PIT-1 recognition and the transcriptional activation of specific target genes (145, 164). Phosphorylated PIT-1 enhanced PIT-1 binding to TSHβ elements but decreased binding to PRL and GH elements. This differential affinity for DNA sites depended on DNA sequences flanking a “core” PIT-1 recognition site (164). These results led to the hypothesis that GH synthesis was regulated by ser/thr kinases, by phosphorylating PIT-1, which, in turn, directly induced the expression of the GH gene. This coupling of the signal transduction pathways to the cell type–specific control of GH synthesis through PIT-1 was not proved, however, because phosphorylated PIT-1 had not been shown to directly increase GH synthesis. In fact, after its phosphorylation, PIT-1 binding to both GH and PRL promoters is diminished (164). Further, recent studies have shown that the phosphorylation of PIT-1 is not required for either basal or induced GH promoter activity (165, 166). In cotransfection assays with GH-reporter genes and in vitro mutated or native PIT-1, these two groups showed that phosphorylation-deficient PIT-1 proteins were required for, and able to mediate, cAMP response at both the GH and PRL promoters. One author has therefore concluded that PIT-1 is not the functionally relevant target of PKA- and PKC-mediated signal transduction, but that an additional, PIT-1-dependent factor must be responding to hormonal/environmental cues that increase intracellular cAMP levels (11). In recent analyses of the hGH flanking region, Shepard and colleagues showed that two CREs and a PIT-1 recognition element were necessary for the response of the GH gene to forskolin addition to GC cells (167). The response to forskolin was mediated by PKA, and the cotransfection of PIT-1 only increased basal transcription, indicating that PIT-1 was not limiting for cAMP-mediated induction at hGH. Shepard and coworkers (167) further identified CREB/ATF-1 as the protein(s) bound at the CREs. Thus, CREB/ATF-1 may directly interact with PIT-1 to mediate hGH activation by cAMP in the pituitary.
CONTROL OF GROWTH HORMONE SYNTHESIS

### UBIQUITOUS GH REGULATORY FACTORS

Analysis using DNase 1 footprinting and mutations of the rat GH promoter identified a regulatory element at –239 to –219 that, when mutated, decreased promoter activity threefold in GC cells (168). A tissue-general factor of 43 kDa was identified as binding to this element and was called GHF-3; GHF-3 has not been further characterized. A recent report identified a new factor that acts synergistically with PIT-1 to activate the GH gene (29). In a search for new regulatory factors at the GH locus, the 5′ flanking sequence of available GH genes was compared. Several highly conserved regions in the human, rat, bovine, caprine, porcine, and ovine GH sequences were identified (Figure 2), although mutational analysis of the function of these regions in transgenic mice indicated that only one region was important in GH regulation. This sequence motif (called a Z box), located directly between the two PIT-1 sites on the rGH gene, was required for high-level expression in transgenic mouse pituitaries. A novel Zn finger protein (Zn-15) was isolated that specifically bound this Z box, and subsequent cotransfection analysis showed that Zn-15 will coactivate the GH gene with PIT-1 in heterologous cells. The effect was a four- to fivefold increase in gene expression over the transfection of PIT-1 alone. Zn-15 is expressed in the pituitary but is also found in several nonpituitary tissues such as heart and spleen. Thus, in analogy with other tissue-general factors that are coactivators with PIT-1, Zn-15 is a tissue-general transcription factor that acts synergistically with PIT-1 to activate the GH gene. Such PIT-1 coactivators include the RAR in the autoregulation of PIT-1 itself (156) and the estrogen receptor on the distal PRL enhancer (129, 130, 135, 147).

### THE USE OF SPONTANEOUS AND DERIVED MUTANTS TO STUDY PITUITARY CELL TYPE DEVELOPMENT

For several reasons, the anterior pituitary has been suggested as an excellent model to study cellular differentiation during development and the cell type–specific control of gene expression (1, 4, 10, 12, 13). First, all cell types in the anterior pituitary begin as undifferentiated ectoderm, which after contact with nearby neuroectoderm, begins a discrete pattern of differentiation events to generate distinct cell types. Some of these events have been characterized at the cellular and molecular levels so that specific hypotheses can be proposed to explain the mechanisms of pituitary differentiation (4, 8). Second, each anterior pituitary cell type is well defined, with highly cell type–specific molecular markers (hormones) for each of the five different cell types, although a progenitor cell expressing both GH and PRL has been identified. Third, these cell types and their biologic functions have been extensively studied because of the important role played by each cell type in both the understanding the physiology of signal transduction and the practical applications to agriculture and medicine (13). There are also several investigative tools available for studying the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation in the pituitary, including cell culture systems, which retain much of their cell type specificity. Finally, a number of genetic mutants have been described that are altered in the developmental steps in pituitary organogenesis and cellular differentiation. Some of these mutations are listed in Table 1, along with a number of mutant mouse strains that were generated artificially through transgenesis. The latter group lists primarily the results of transgenic experiments in which the effects of the overexpression of gene products in somatotrophs or in the ablation of pituitary cells were studied. Many additional natural and engineered mutant strains exist that are used to study anterior pituitary cellular and molecular biology (6, 12).

Spontaneous genetic mutants: PIT-1 is mutated in some Dwarf mice and humans. Mice homozygous for either of two independent mutations in the PIT-1 gene are dwarf in stature and are deficient in circulating GH, PRL, and TSHβ (see Table 1). These defects

CPHD: combined pituitary hormone deficiency. For all other abbreviations, see text.

are the result of the inadequate anterior pituitary structure, which is in turn due to the loss of PIT-1 gene function (103,169). PIT-1 has more directly been shown to be critical for the proliferation of the anterior pituitary; antisense oligonucleotides, which disrupt PIT-1 expression, prevent cell division of pituitary cells in culture (170). Genetic and molecular analysis of PIT-1 alleles in dwarf mice has been reviewed in detail (4). In addition, several human PIT-1 mutations have been studied (114,171–173). In these cases, affected patients have combined pituitary hormone deficiencies that were due to different mutations in PIT-1 and a subsequent loss of PIT-1 function (Figure 3 and Table 1). Several studies found hypopituitarism as well as hormone deficiency, as seen in both mouse dwarf strains (171–173). The PIT-1 mutation in one family was in the POU homeodomain (171), whereas others were in the POU-specific domain (172,173) or the transactivation domain (172). Another study of human growth failure showed that although the pituitary was overtly normal, no GH, PRL, or TSHβ was produced in affected patients in two families (114). The PIT-1 mutation found in both of these families changed ${}^{158}$Ala in the POU-specific domain to ${}^{158}$Pro. This latter result is important, because the authors were thus able to separate the gene activation function of PIT-1 from its role in pituitary cell proliferation (114).

Pigs exist that are either small (called mini-pigs) or very small (called micro-pigs) relative to production animals. Both mini- and micro-pigs have been investigated for circulating growth hormone and other growth factor levels. Serum GH levels are normal

in both size types, indicating that PIT-1 function is unaffected, at least with respect to its action on the GH gene (174). In contrast, serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels correlated with body size; Yucatan micro-pigs had significantly reduced IGF-1 levels in comparison to those of normal animals (174, 175). Mini-pigs had lower serum IGF-1 levels, but the differences was not statistically different from the IGF-1 levels seen in normal animals (175). One explanation for these results is that in both mini- and micro- pigs, the defect is in the response to GH, rather than in GH synthesis or release. It would be of interest to discover if another very small stature breed known as the Vietnamese pot-bellied pig has normal levels of GH, as do the mini and micro breeds. As well, lines of cattle selected for their mature frame size (176, 177) could be investigated for their GH levels. The PIT-1 gene is polymorphic in both dairy and beef breeds (178, 179). These genetic differences at the bovine PIT-1 locus have been associated (P < 0.05) with differences in several carcass measurements, including rib size, seam fat, and bone weight, although not for birth weight or adjusted weaning weight (180). In pigs, PIT-1 is also polymorphic across domestic breeds, as well as between domestic and Chinese breeds (122, 150, 181). Significant association has been found between a specific PIT-1 genotype (CC) and several traits related to growth and GH metabolism (182). These traits include weights at various ages (birth [P < 0.01–0.05], 21 d, and weaning and backfat at various parts of the carcass (overall average [P < 0.05], first rib [P < 0.01–0.05], last rib, lumbar [P < 0.05–0.1] and 10th rib). Chinese breeds of pig contributed the C allele in the Iowa State University reference families in which these analyses were done, and fatter carcasses detected by the CC genotype is a typical characteristic of the Meishan and Minzhu breeds. However, in both cattle and pigs, the polymorphisms detected at PIT-1 have not as yet been shown to affect PIT-1 function or activity. Therefore, a cause-and-effect relationship in livestock has yet to be proved between allelic variation at PIT-1 and statistically associated physiologic effects on growth and carcass composition.

Transgenic approaches to investigate pituitary development. Several transgenic approaches have been used to study the role of somatotrophs and somatotrophic hormone metabolism on growth and physiology in the intact animal. Although some results in transgenic mice have confirmed models of GH expression and pituitary cell proliferation and differentiation, there have also been several surprises (Table 1). The ablation of somatotrophs with toxic transgene products expressed from the GH promoter leads to dwarfism (183, 184). Borrelli and colleagues used a transgene ablation system that was inducible and reversible. The transgenic mice carried thymidine kinase, which in dividing cells only, converts 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-δ-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU) to a toxic metabolite. Feeding FIAU to transgenic mice carrying a GH-promoter-expressed thymidine kinase (TK) gene caused somatotroph ablation and a loss of circulating GH, as expected. Interestingly, when these mice were fed FIAU, they also lost their lactotrophs and exhibited a loss of PRL expression. These results indicated that lactotrophs derive from a population of GH-expressing precursor cells that the authors call a stem-somatotroph (184). Further, these precursor cells must persist into adulthood, because the removal of FIAU reversed the phenotype and animals recovered somatotroph and lactotroph function. In parallel experiments with transgenic mice carrying PRL-expressed TK, FIAU treatment showed no effects on the lactotroph population or function, indicating that lactotroph proliferation and differentiation precedes PRL expression (184).

In an attempt to establish an immortalized cell line expressing PIT-1, transgenic mice were produced that expressed the oncogenic simian virus (SV)40 large T antigen (TAg) under the control of the PIT-1 promoter (185). Unexpectedly, these mice were dwarf and pituitary tumors from these mice did not express either GH or PRL. Transformed cells established from TAg-expressing mice also expressed PIT-1 but not GH or PRL, indi-

cating that the cell population represented an early somatotroph progenitor that was developmentally entrapped at an initial stage of PIT-1 expression (185). Because these mice and cells also did not express PRL, the phenotype of the entrapped cells was further proof of the postulated somatomammotropic lineage that later produces both somatotrophs and lactotrophs (4,8). Evidence for bovine somatomammotroph cells has also been described (186). In primary bovine pituitary cell cultures, GH-releasing cells were detected at a much earlier gestational age than were PRL-releasing cells. The latter cells also released GH; thus, they were functional somatomamphotrophs (186).

Transgenic animals have also been used to study the effects of intracellular levels of cAMP on GH expression. Using somatotroph-specific promoters to express a toxin that irreversibly stimulates cAMP production resulted in transgenic mice with pituitary hyperplasia, increased GH production, and gigantism (187). In a complementary approach, the expression of a nonphosphorylatable mutant of the CREB in the pituitary of transgenic mice blocked the cAMP pathway. This block led to a loss of GH and PRL expression and to dwarfism (188). Mice expressing GHRH from the metallothionein (MT) promoter displayed pituitary hyperplasia and gigantism. These mice expressed large levels of GHRH in the pituitary, indicating that excess GHRH within the pituitary itself was likely having an uncontrolled autocrine effect (189).

## CONTROL OF GH SECRETION

GHRH and its receptor. GH is secreted in a pulsatile manner from the anterior pituitary under the control of a complex neuroendocrine system involving two hypothalamic hormones from the median eminence (Figure 1). One, GHRH, stimulates GH release and somatotroph proliferation, and the other, somatostatin (SRIF), inhibits basal as well as GHRH-stimulated GH release. The influence of these two hypothalamic hormones is modulated by other hypothalamic factors, by neurotransmitters, and by circulating hormones acting directly on the pituitary. Extensive reviews of the biology and chemistry of the hypothalamic hormones (13,190–192) and the neuropharmacology of GH secretion (193,194) have been published.

A decrease in growth rate after the destruction of the hypothalamus in young rats was the first evidence of the neuroendocrine control of GH secretion (195). The purification and sequencing of the releasing hormone were not completed until isolation from a human pancreatic islet adenoma (196). GHRH is synthesized as a 107/108-aa precursor in humans and is cleaved by a series of peptidases to GHRH(1–44)NH₂. The in vivo hormone exists as the amidated 44-aa form in all species except humans, in which a truncated version, [GHRH(1–40)OH] is also present. The aa sequence of GHRH is not highly conserved in mammalian species, especially between rodents and other mammals (194). The structure between Residues 1 and 27, which constitutes the active core of the peptide, however, is conserved.

The human GHRH gene has been sequenced (197) and was mapped at the p12 band of Chromosome 20 (198). Knowledge of the regulation of GHRH gene expression is mostly limited to the rat and mouse.

The surgical transection of the hypophysial stalk in cattle (199) and pigs (200), hypothalamic deafferentation in pigs (201), and hypothalamopituitary disconnection in sheep (202) abolish the normal episodic secretion of GH, providing evidence for a role of the hypothalamic hormones in controlling the episodic pattern of GH secretion. The isolated pituitary without its neurohypophysial link with the hypothalamus, however, remains responsive to peripheral doses of GHRH and SRIF (200,202–204). The anterior pituitary also contains GHRH and SRIF (205). Precursor forms of both hormones have been found in the pituitary (206,207), indicating that the synthesis of these releasing hormones occurs

in the pituitary and that the possibility exists of local neuroendocrine control of GH secretion and proliferation of anterior pituitary somatotrophs.

Further evidence of the role of GHRH in the pulsatile secretion of GH has been provided by active or passive immunization against GHRH. Immunization against GHRH abolished the pulsatile release of GH in heifers (208), gilts (209), and sheep (210). The treatment of rats with anti-GHRH antiserum reduced growth, reduced pituitary GH mRNA, and increased GHRH mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (211). The administration of GH or IGF-1 reversed the effects of anti-GHRH antiserum on the GHRH mRNA level in the arcuate nucleus, suggesting that GH and/or IGF-1 represent a major factor in the negative regulation of GHRH synthesis. There is considerable evidence that the administration of IGF-1 inhibits GHRH-stimulated GH release in rats and domestic fowl (194). The administration of IGF-1 has been shown to suppress GHRH gene transcription and the GHRH mRNA levels in rats (212). In rat hypothalamic-pituitary coperifusions, clonidine-induced GH release was associated with increased GHRH and decreased SRIH release (213). The increased GHRH and decreased SRIH were reversed by GH or IGF-1. In sheep, the intracerebroventricular injection of IGF-1 did not change the episodic pattern of GH secretion (214). GH secretion in sheep, however, was suppressed by intrapituitary injections of IGF-1. The IGFs, their binding proteins, and receptors have been found in the hypothalamic region of the brain (214) and are candidates for modifying the effects of GHRH on GH secretion or somatotroph proliferation.

The specific binding of GHRH to somatotroph cell membranes has been demonstrated with rat (215, 216) and bovine (217) pituitaries and human pituitary tumor tissue (218). Recently, human and rat (219, 220), mouse (221), and porcine (222) receptors for GHRH (GHRH-R) have been cloned. The 423-aa protein has seven transmembrane domains characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors and has homology with other G protein-coupled receptors (vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, calcitonin, glucagon, and parathyroid hormone). The protein has a large amino-terminal domain that is likely to be extracellular and to participate in ligand binding. The rat GHRH-R has 82% homology with human GHRH-R (219). The transient expression of the GHRH-R cDNA in human kidney 293 cells resulted in the specific binding of GHRH and the GHRH stimulation of cAMP production, a known second messenger for GHRH action. Evidence of gene expression for GHRH-R in extrahypothalamic tissues of the rat has recently been reported (223), suggesting additional role(s) for GHRH.

PIT-1 is likely to be involved directly in the activation of the GHRH-R gene. Sequence analysis of the region 5′ to the first coding exon of the GHRH-R gene shows two potential PIT-1-binding sites (P. Godfrey and K. Mayo, unpublished observations). Furthermore, in transfection assays using a GHRH-R regulatory sequence fused to luciferase, either hPIT-1 or a mutant hPIT-1 (PIT-1 A158P; Figure 3) could stimulate the expression of the GHRH-R gene. A similar analysis using a PRL promoter fused to luciferase indicated that only the wild-type hPIT-1 could activate the PRL promoter in CV1 cells (224). Further, a well-studied mouse strain called the Snell dwarf (*dw*) has multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies and severe pituitary hypoplasia. A recessive mutation in the *dw* locus, now known to be identical to the PIT-1 gene, maps to Chromosome 16 in the mouse. By using the newly cloned GHRH-R cDNA, Rosenfeld and coworkers showed that in the *dw* mouse, no GHRH-R mRNA is present, indicating that PIT-1 is required for the initiation or maintenance of GHRH-R expression (224). This result also indicates that the pituitary hypoplasia in *dw* mice may be caused by GHRH-R deficiency rather than by a direct effect of PIT-1, because GHRH is known to influence the proliferation of somatotrophs through cAMP-mediated signal transduction (192). Another dwarf mouse strain, *lit*, also has pituitary hypoplasia, but only GH mRNA and protein are severely affected. The lesion
causing the *lit* phenotype maps to Chromosome 6, indicating that the mutation in *lit* mice is unrelated to PIT-1. Two groups mapped GHRH-R to the same region of Chromosome 6 as *lit* (221,225). Analysis of the GHRH-R sequence in *lit* mice showed a single aa substitution to glycine at the highly conserved aspartic acid 60 residue in the ligand-binding domain (221,226). This mutant protein was unable to transduce an exogenous GHRH signal into increased cAMP levels in transfected cells, indicating that the GHRH-R protein in *lit* mice is defective in ligand binding and/or signal transduction after ligand binding. In *lit* mice, GHRH-R mRNA expression is unaffected at very early stages of the differentiation of the pituitary, and GH-positive cells can be seen in the pituitary at the correct time in development (ED16–18). In the adult pituitary gland, however, there is a marked reduction in GH-positive cells (221). GH and GHRH-R expression is also reduced and limited to the anterolateral portions of the adult anterior pituitary, with no GH-producing cells found in the caudomedial regions. In contrast, PRL expression is distributed throughout the anterior pituitary, indicating that PRL-expressing lactotrophs are unaffected in *lit* mice (221).

Overall, these data indicate that GHRH-R is not required for the initial proliferation of stem cells, which give rise to somatotrophs and lactotrophs. As these cells further differentiate and move to the caudomedial zone, however, they encounter GHRH-mediated stimulation near the portal vascular connections from the hypothalamus. For correct signal transduction of GHRH, the GHRH-R is then needed for the proliferation of somatotrophs only. PRL-producing cells are functional in *lit* mice, indicating that the maintenance of lactotroph proliferation is controlled by a different mechanism. The observation that PIT-1-deficient mice (*dw*) have no PRL- or TSHβ-producing cells as well as no GH-producing cells suggests that PIT-1 may regulate other receptors in lactotrophs and thyrotrophs, the role of which in proliferation is similar to that of GHRH-R in somatotrophs. Supporting the role of GHRH-R in the regulation of the proliferation of somatotrophs are the recent results of the study of yet another dwarf mouse strain, the Ames dwarf (*df*). The recessive *df* lesion causes a decrease in GH production and somatotroph lineage expansion and maps to mouse Chromosome 11 (227,228); thus, *df* is distinct from both the PIT-1 and the GHRH genes. A small number (0.05% of normal) of GH-producing cells are present in *df* pituitaries, indicating that somatotrophs can and do proliferate at low levels in these mice (229). However, no GHRH-R mRNA is expressed in the pituitary in *df* mice and the production of exogenous GHRH-R via an MT-GHRH-R transgene did not increase the growth of *df* mice. Hypothalamic levels of GHRH mRNA are elevated in *df* mice (230), and *df* mice can respond to exogenous GH (227,231), indicating that the defect is in the pituitary. Because these mice are unable to respond to increased levels of GHRH-R, the pituitary defect must be before GHRH-R function in the differentiation of the somatotroph lineage. The *df* locus thus appears to act at the approximate same point as (or in concert with) PIT-1 in the pathway to somatotroph proliferation.

In addition to its role in regulating secretion, GHRH stimulates the synthesis of GH and the proliferation of somatotrophs. GHRH-induced GH synthesis may be mediated through the nuclear protein CREB (232), which contains a PKA phosphorylation site (233). The phosphorylated CREB binds to the CRE, thereby activating gene transcription (see previous sections and Meyer and Habener [234] for a review). GHRH, but not GH-releasing Peptide 6, has been shown to increase PIT-1 mRNA in primary rat pituitary cell cultures (235).

SRIH. The discovery of the inhibition of in vitro GH release from incubated rat pituitaries by hypothalamic extracts (236) led to the isolation of a tetradecapeptide (SRIH-14) from the hypothalamus (237). SRIH is synthesized as a 116-aa precursor that is cleaved by endopeptidases, resulting in two forms secreted from the hypothalamus,
CONTROL OF GROWTH HORMONE SYNTHESIS

SRIH-28 and SRIH-14. SRIH-14 and SRIH-28 are produced in different proportions by neurons and secretory cells through the differential processing of a common pro- SRIH precursor (238). SRIH-28, an amino-terminal extension of SRIH-14, has the greater inhibitory effects on GH secretion. Unlike GHRH, SRIH is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system and its sequence is highly conserved in mammalian species. SRIH is a potent inhibitor of GH secretion induced by various stimuli in numerous species but has variable effects on basal GH secretion (239). Pharmacologic levels of SRIH given intravenously have been shown to depress unstimulated GH in sheep (239). The intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of SRIH to the sheep did not depress GH, but giving SRIH antiserum ICV dramatically increased GH.

GH administration increases SRIH mRNA concentrations in the hypothalamus of rats (240), but the effects of hypophysectomy have been variable (240, 241). The immunoneutralization of circulating endogenous GHRH slightly decreased SRIH mRNA in the periventricular nucleus, and the immunoneutralization of circulating SRIH had no effect on GHRH mRNA in the hypothalamus of rats (211). Following the observation that the stimulation of cAMP formation in diencephalic cultures increased SRIH mRNA levels, a CRE that was required for the expression of the SRIH gene was identified in the region just upstream of the transcription initiation site. Several CREBs or nuclear transcription factors that seem to be activated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation have been identified (211). A more recent study with purified rat somatotrophs (232) indicated that a low concentration of SRIH that suppressed GHRH-stimulated GH release had no effect on cytosolic PKA activity.

GHRH also seems to stimulate the secretion of SRIH on the basis of increased concentrations of SRIH in portal blood after the ICV injection of GHRH in rats (242) and sheep (243) and the increased release of SRIH from the rat median eminence in response to GHRH (244). In contrast, ICV administered anti-SRIH serum to rats increased GHRH concentrations in portal plasma (245). By the use of a mouse hypothalamic perfusion system, it was shown that reducing or removing the effective concentration of endogenous SRIH enhanced GHRH secretion (246). Those authors suggested that an increase in GHRH secretion after the administration of exogenous SRIH may be caused by the inhibition of an unidentified interneuron that exerts a suppressive action on GHRH secretion.

There is no evidence that SRIH modifies GH synthesis or somatotroph proliferation. The treatment of primary rat pituitary cells with SRIH had no effect on GHRH-induced PIT-1 mRNA levels (235).

The actions of SRIH are mediated by high-affinity plasma membrane receptors that are coupled via G proteins to adenylyl cyclase, K⁺ and Ca²⁺ channels, and protein tyrosine phosphatase (247–249). Five subtypes of SRIH receptors (SRIH-R) have been cloned from mammalian cells and have been proposed to mediate the diverse biologic actions of this peptide (250–254). SRIH receptors selective for SRIH-28 have been cloned from rat and human pituitaries (253). At present, there is considerable confusion in the scientific literature about the classification and nomenclature of SRIH receptors, but the five cloned receptors seem to fall into two classes (255). Northern blot analysis of SRIH-R5 revealed a 2.4-kb transcript in normal rat pituitary and a 4.0-kb transcript in normal human pituitary. The mRNA was selectively localized in the pituitary of rats and humans (253). Although the human and rat SRIH-R5 showed about 75% homology, the two displayed significantly different binding affinities for somatostatin analogues. On the basis of the binding of various SRIH analogues, it was concluded that SRIH-R5 in the human pituitary probably does not mediate the inhibition of GH release (254).

SUMMARY

A large body of research, primarily in the rodent and human species, has elucidated many of the details regarding the control of GH synthesis and release. Cell type-specific transcriptional control has been identified as the main mechanism of the somatotroph-specific expression of GH. The recent detailed analysis in rodents and humans of a highly specific transcriptional activator protein, PIT-1, has opened several new areas of study. This is especially true for research in the farm animal species, where PIT-1 has been cloned and its binding elements on the GH gene are being investigated in a number of economically important species. Genetic and biochemical analyses of PIT-1 and other GH regulators have shown the central role of PIT-1 not only in the cell-autonomous stimulation of GH gene transcription, but also in the participation of PIT-1 in the response at the GH gene to exogenous hormones such as RA and TH. PIT-1 has been implicated in the proliferative development of the pituitary itself, in the maintenance of anterior pituitary cell types once cell types are defined, and in the mechanism by which the hypothalamic signal for GH release is transduced. However, PIT-1 by itself does not activate the GH gene, so that additional unknown factors exist that need to be identified to fully understand the cell type-specific activation of the GH gene. In addition, GH gene regulatory elements acting through well-characterized systems such as TH have seemingly different effects; the specific context of the regulatory elements relative to the promoter elements appear to be crucial. These contextual details of GH gene regulation are not well understood for any species and need to be further studied to be able to make predictions for particular elements and regulatory mechanisms across species. The regulation of the pulsatile secretion of GH by GHRH and SRIH is reasonably well understood after the cloning and analysis of the two releasing factors and their receptors. Modification or manipulation of the pathways involved in the regulation of GH secretion is a potential means of enhancing the lean tissue growth of meat animals. However, further understanding of the systems controlling the in vivo release of GH is needed before such manipulations are likely to be productive.

Several other research questions regarding the control of GH expression and release remain to be answered. What is the biochemical connection between exogenous signal transduction (i.e., GRH/GHRH-R, TR, ER, RAR) and PIT-1 at the GH gene? Are there additional coactivators or repressors of GH that respond to cAMP levels? Do ubiquitous regulatory factors such as GHF-3 and Zn-15, identified thus far only in the rat, exist in humans or livestock? Zn-15 is expected to be found in many mammalian species, because its recognition sequence between the PIT-1-binding sites is highly conserved across mammals (Figure 2). What is the mechanism causing GH levels to drop during aging? Does PIT-1 expression decrease during the lifespan of animals? Is it possible to increase GH gene expression within target tissues by directing the expression of PIT-1 to these tissues via transgenesis, or are other factors limiting in peripheral tissues so that the lack of PIT-1 expression is not the deciding factor? Finally, is there genetic variation in the expression of GHRH and/or SRIH or in their respective receptors? These questions are relevant to and could be investigated in several of the livestock species.
