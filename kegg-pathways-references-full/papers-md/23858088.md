ABSTRACT

Teichoic acids (TA) are important for growth, biofilm formation, adhesion and virulence of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. The chemical structures of the TAs vary between bacteria, though they typically consist of zwitterionic polymers that are either anchored to the peptidoglycan layer as in the case of wall teichoic acid (WTA) or the cell membrane and named lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The polymers are modified with D-alanines and a lack of this decoration leads to increased susceptibility to cationic antimicrobial peptides. Four proteins, DltA-D, are essential for the incorporation of D-alanines into cell wall polymers and it has been established that DltA transfers D-alanines in the cytoplasm of the cell onto the carrier protein DltC. However, two conflicting models have been proposed for the remainder of the mechanism. Using a cellular protein localization and membrane topology analysis, we show here that DltC does not traverse the membrane and that DltD is anchored to the outside of the cell. These data are in agreement with the originally proposed model for D-alanine incorporation through a process that has been proposed to proceed via a D- alanine undecaprenyl phosphate membrane intermediate. Furthermore, we found that WTA isolated from a Staphylococcus aureus strain lacking LTA contains only a small amount of D-alanines, indicating that LTA has a role, either direct or indirect, in the efficient D-alanine incorporation into WTA in living cells.

INTRODUCTION

The bacterial cell wall is a complex and highly organized structure that allows bacteria to interact with and protects them against hostile insults encountered in the environment. In Gram-positive bacteria, multi-functional teichoic acids (TAs) are key components of the cell wall. Many Gram-positive bacteria contain two types of TAs; wall teichoic acid (WTA), which is covalently linked to the peptidoglycan layer and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which is embedded in the membrane via a lipid anchor (Reichmann & Gründling, 2011; Xia et al., 2010a). Bacteria display diverse defects in the absence of either polymer and their combined absence is lethal to the cell (Oku et al., 2009; Schirner et al., 2009).

In *Staphylococcus aureus*, LTA is composed of a polyglycerol phosphate backbone chain that is linked via a glycolipid anchor to the outside of the membrane (Reichmann & Gründling, 2011). The backbone chain is polymerized on the outside of the cell by the lipoteichoic acid synthase enzyme LtaS using the membrane lipid phosphatidylglycerol as its substrate (Gründling & Schneewind, 2007b; Karatsa-Dodgson et al., 2010; Koch et al., 1984; Lu et al., 2009). WTA in *S. aureus*, on the other hand, is composed of a ribitolphosphate backbone chain that is connected through a linker unit to muramic acid residues of peptidoglycan (Brown et al., 2008; Neuhaus & Baddiley, 2003). WTA is further decorated with α- or β-O-N-acetylglucosamine residues and the enzymes required for this modification have been recently identified as TarM and TarS (Brown et al., 2012; Xia et al., 2010b). In *S. aureus* and many other Gram-positive bacteria, both polymers are further decorated with D-alanine esters, which confer a positive charge on the negative polymer (Neuhaus & Baddiley, 2003). Pulse-chase experiments using [¹⁴C]-alanine indicated that D-alanines are first incorporated into LTA (Haas et al., 1984). Based on the

observation that a decrease in radioactivity in the LTA fraction is followed by an
increase in radioactivity in the WTA fraction, it has been suggested that D-alanine-
LTA serves as donor for D-alanine substitutions in WTA (Haas et al., 1984).

D-alanine modification of TAs is known to play an important role in the
regulation of autolytic activity and binding of Mg²⁺ ions within the cell wall (Fischer
et al., 1981; Koprivnjak et al., 2006; Lambert et al., 1975). The absence of D-alanine
esters leads to an increase in the susceptibility of bacteria to nisin, defensins and other
cationic antimicrobial peptides and more rapid killing by phagocytic cells and
neutrophils (Collins et al., 2002; Kristian et al., 2005; Peschel et al., 1999; Poyart et
al., 2003; Walter et al., 2007). S. aureus strains lacking D-alanine modifications are
unable to colonize polystyrene or glass, are impaired in biofilm formation and show
reduced adherence to nasal epithelial cells, and similar effects are observed in other
bacteria (Gross et al., 2001; Walter et al., 2007; Weidenmaier et al., 2004).

Proteins required for the D-alanine incorporation into TAs are encoded in the
dlt operon (Neuhaus & Baddiley, 2003; Neuhaus et al., 1996) and in S. aureus this
operon consists of five genes dltXABCD (Koprivnjak et al., 2006). Based on the dlt
operon in Bacillus subtilis only proteins encoded by dltABCD are thought to be
essential for D-alanine incorporation (Koprivnjak et al., 2006; Perego et al., 1995).
The function of DltA and DltC in this process has been established. DltA is a D-
alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase, which catalyzes the adenylation of D-alanine
and then the transfer of the activated amino acid onto the D-alanyl carrier protein
DltC (Debabov et al., 1996; Fischer, 1994; Heaton & Neuhaus, 1994). The roles
played by DltB and DltD are less clear. DltB is a multi-membrane spanning protein
and hydropathy profiles indicate that DltD is also anchored to the membrane via an N-
terminal hydrophobic sequence. Two models for the functions of these proteins have
been proposed; Fischer and colleagues proposed that D-alanylation of TAs proceeds  
through a lipid-linked undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) intermediate. In this model, it  
was hypothesized that DltB facilitates the transfer of D-alanines from DltC to C55-P to  
produce D-Ala-P-C55 and possibly the subsequent transfer of this lipid-linked  
intermediate across the membrane (Fig. 1(a)) (Perego et al., 1995). However, it  
should be noted that such a lipid-linked intermediate has not yet been confirmed  
experimentally. The final step in the D-alanylation process was proposed to be  
catalyzed by DltD, which in this model functions on the outside of the cell (Perego et  
al., 1995). The second model was formulated by Neuhaus and Baddiley following  
experiments performed by Debabov et al. on the DltD protein from Lactobacillus  
rhamnosus (Debabov et al., 2000). Using purified proteins, it was shown that the rate  
of ligation of D-alanines from DltA to DltC increases two-fold in the presence of  
DltD (Debabov et al., 2000). This led to the hypothesis that DltD acts in the  
cytoplasm of the cell as a platform to bring DltA and DltC in close proximity  
allowing efficient charging of DltC with D-alanines (Fig. 1(b)). The charged DltC  
protein is then thought to translocate across the membrane via a channel formed by  
DltB and to transfer D-alanines in a final step onto LTA (Neuhaus & Baddiley, 2003).  
In this study we revisited the mechanism of D-alanine incorporation into  
Gram-positive cell wall polymers. Using an S. aureus strain lacking LTA, we show  
that D-alanines are only very inefficiently incorporated into WTA, providing  
experimental evidence that in living cells D-alanine-LTA is required for the efficient  
incorporation of D-alanines into WTA. By performing a protein localization and  
membrane topology analysis in S. aureus, we show that DltC remains within the cell  
and that DltD is targeted to the outside of the cell, which is only consistent with the  
model proposed by Werner Fischer and colleagues. Based on our findings, we suggest  
that future studies addressing the mechanism of D-alanine incorporation into LTA
should be designed based on the originally proposed model.

121 METHODS
122 Bacterial stains and culture conditions. Bacterial strains used in this study are listed
123 in Table 1 and primers in Table 2. Escherichia coli strains were grown in LB medium
124 and S. aureus strains in tryptic soy broth (TSB) or agar (TSA). All strains were grown
125 at 37°C and media were supplemented when appropriate with the antibiotics or
126 inducers as listed in Table 1.
127 
128 Plasmid and strain construction. Plasmid pitet-dltC-His was constructed for
129 detection of DltC by western blot analysis. The dltC gene from S. aureus Newman
130 chromosomal DNA was amplified with primers 721/722, resulting in the addition a C-
131 terminal His-tag. The PCR product was digested with AvrII/BglII and ligated with
132 plasmid pitet, which had been digested with the same enzymes. Plasmid pitet-dltC-
133 His was initially obtained in E. coli XL1 Blue resulting in strain ANG 1482 and
134 subsequently integrated into the lipase gene geh of S. aureus RN4220Δspa giving rise
135 to strain ANG 1484. For use as an empty vector control strain, pitet was introduced
136 into S. aureus RN4220Δspa resulting in strain ANG 1729.
137 Plasmids pitet-dltD-lacZ, pitet-dltD40aa-lacZ, pitet-3aa-lacZ, and pitet-aurs-lacZ
138 were constructed for membrane topology studies in S. aureus. Plasmids pitet-dltD-
139 lacZ and pitet-dltD40aa-lacZ were constructed by amplifying the appropriate dltD
140 sequence from plasmid pUT18-dltD (ANG1314) with primers 882/883 and 882/884,
141 respectively. Following digestion with AvrII/SalI, PCR products were ligated with
142 pitet-lacZ (ANG 286), which had been digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids
143 pitet-dltD-lacZ and pitet-dltD40aa-lacZ were initially obtained in E. coli XL1 Blue
144 yielding strains ANG 1718 and ANG 1719, and subsequently transformed into S.
145 aureus RN4220Δspa resulting in strains ANG 1723 and ANG 1724, respectively. To

146 construct plasmid pitet-3aa-lacZ, the sequence encoding the ribosome binding site and
147 the first three amino acids of DltD was generated by annealing the primers 887/888.
148 The annealed primers were ligated with pitet-lacZ, which had been digested with
149 AvrII/SalI. Plasmid pitet-3aa-lacZ was initially obtained in E. coli XL1 Blue giving
150 rise to strain ANG 1720 and subsequently transformed into S. aureus RN4220Δspa
151 yielding strain ANG 1725. Plasmid pitet-aurs-lacZ was constructed by amplifying the
152 sequence encoding the signal sequence of aureolysin (aurs) from S. aureus Newman
153 chromosomal DNA with primers 1096/1097. The PCR product was digested with
154 AvrII/SalI and ligated with plasmid pitet-lacZ, which had been digested with the same
155 enzymes. Plasmid pitet-aurs-lacZ was initially obtained in E. coli XL1 Blue resulting
156 in strain ANG 1722 and subsequently transformed into S. aureus RN4220Δspa giving
157 rise to strain ANG 1727.
158 Fusions to the extracellular domain of the inactive LtaS variant eLtaST300A with
159 a C-terminal 6x histidine tag were used for membrane topology studies. Plasmids
160 pitet-dltD40aa-eLtaST300A-His, pitet-dltD100aa-eLtaST300A-His, pitet-3aa-eLtaST300A-His and
161 pitet-aurs-eLtaST300A-His were generated for this purpose. Plasmids pitet-dltD40aa-
162 eLtaST300A-His and pitet-dltD100aa-eLtaST300A-His were constructed by amplifying the
163 sequence encoding the first 40 or 100 amino acids of DltD from pUT18-dltD
164 (ANG 1314) with primers 882/889 and 882/891 and the eLtaST300A-His sequence from
165 pOK-ltaS-T300A (ANG 1103) using primers 890/420 and 892/420, respectively. The
166 resulting products were fused by splicing by overlap extension (SOE) PCR using
167 primers 882/420. The final PCR products were digested with AvrII/BglII and ligated
168 with plasmid pitet, which had been digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids pitet-
169 dltD40aa-eLtaST300A-His and pitet-dltD100aa-eLtaST300A-His were initially transformed
170 into E. coli XL1 Blue resulting in strains ANG 2041 and ANG 2022, and subsequently

transformed into S. aureus RN4220ΔspaΔsbi yielding strains ANG 2042 and
ANG 2026, respectively. In order to generate plasmid pitet-3aa-eltaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His, the
eltaS<sub>T300A</sub> sequence was amplified from pOK-ltaS-T300A (ANG 1103) with primers
1138/420, resulting in the addition of the ribosome binding site and sequences
encoding for the first three amino acids of DltD to the 5' end and a 6x His-tag to the 3'
end. This PCR product was digested with AvrII/BglII and ligated with plasmid pitet,
which had been digested with the same enzymes. Plasmid pitet-3aa-eltaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His was
initially transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue giving rise to strain ANG 1908 and
subsequently transformed into S. aureus RN4220ΔspaΔsbi yielding strain ANG 2024.
Plasmid pitet-aurs-eltaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His was constructed by amplifying the sequence
encoding the signal sequence of aureolysin (aurs) from pitet-aurs-lacZ (ANG 1722)
with primers 1096/1216 and the eltaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His sequence from pOK-ltaS-T300A
(ANG 1103) with primers 1217/420. The resulting products were fused by SOE PCR
using primers 1096/420. The final PCR product was digested with AvrII/BglII and
ligated with plasmid pitet, which had been digested with the same enzymes. Plasmid
pitet-aurs-eltaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His was initially transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue resulting in
strain ANG 2021 and subsequently transformed into S. aureus RN4220ΔspaΔsbi
yielding strain ANG 2025. The sequences of all inserts were verified by fluorescent
automatic sequencing at the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre at Imperial College
London.

Cell fractionation and western blot analysis. Overnight cultures of S. aureus were
diluted 1:100 into 5 ml TSB medium with anhydrotetracycline (Atet) and grown for
4½ h at 37°C with shaking. For cell fractionation into cytoplasm plus membrane
(Cell), cell wall and supernatant, cells of a 1 ml culture were pelleted by

196 centrifugation at 7,000×g for 15 min. Nine hundred μl of the supernatant was TCA
197 precipitated as previously described (Wörmann et al., 2011). The remaining
198 supernatant was removed from the cell pellet and bacteria suspended in 1 ml
199 osmotically stabilizing lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl₂, 30%
200 raffinose and 200 μg/ml lysostaphin) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The
201 protoplasts were collected by centrifugation at 6,000×g for 20 min and suspended in
202 protein sample buffer, yielding the cell fraction (cytoplasm and membrane). Nine
203 hundred μl of the supernatant (cell wall fraction) was TCA precipitated as described
204 above. All samples were suspended in protein sample buffer normalized for culture
205 OD₆₀₀ readings; that is a culture with an OD₆₀₀ of 3 was suspended in 45 μl sample
206 buffer. Samples were boiled for 15 min, centrifuged at 17,000×g for 5 min and 10 μl
207 aliquots were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels for western blot analysis. DltC-His
208 was detected with HRP-conjugated anti-His antibody (Sigma) at a 1:10,000 dilution.
209 The control proteins L6 (cytoplasmic) (gift from O. Schneewind), StrA (membrane)
210 (Mazmanian et al., 2000), SdrD (cell wall) (DeDent et al., 2008) and α-hemolysin
211 (Hla) (supernatant) (Bubeck-Wardenburg & Schneewind, 2008) were detected with
212 respective primary antibodies used at a 1:20,000 dilutions and an HRP-conjugated
213 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution. All experiments were
214 performed at least three times and representative Western blots are shown.

215

216 β-galactosidase activity assay. Overnight cultures of *S*. aureus were diluted 1:100 in
217 5 ml TSB containing 200 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline (Atet) and grown for 4 h at 37°C
218 with shaking. Cells from a 1 ml culture aliquot were collected by centrifugation at
219 17,000×g for 10 min and the pellet was frozen at -20°C overnight. Samples were
220 thawed and pellets suspended in 1 ml ABT buffer (60 mM K₂HPO₄, 40 mM KH₂PO₄,

100 mM NaCl, pH 7, 1% Triton X-100) containing 20 μg/ml lysostaphin and
incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 x
g for 10 min and 100 μl of the supernatant was added to 20 μl 0.4 mg/ml 4-methyl
umbelliferyl β-D-galactopyranoside (MUG) in a black 96-well plate. As background
control 100 μl ABT was added to 20 μl MUG solution. Following incubation in the
dark at room temperature for 1 h, a 20 μl sample was mixed with 180 μl ABT buffer
and fluorescence readings were detected at an excitation wavelength of 336 nm and
emission wavelength of 445 nm. A standard curve was generated using serial
dilutions of 4-methylumbelliferone (MU) in ABT buffer at known concentration.
Subsequently these values were used to determine the concentration (in μM) of
product in each sample and results are given as μM per OD<sub>600</sub> of 1. The experiment
was performed in triplicate and average values and standard deviations plotted.

WTA purification and NMR analysis. Purification of peptidoglycan-WTA
complexes was performed as previously described (Bernal et al., 2009; Kopp et al.,
1996; Strandén et al., 1997) with slight modifications. Overnight cultures of S. aureus
strain RN4220Δspa or the LTA negative strain 4S5 were diluted into five liter TSB to
obtain an initial OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.06 and grown at 37°C with shaking until an OD<sub>600</sub> of
approximately 3. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 10 min
and washed once with 1 M NaCl. Cells were suspended in 40 ml 1 M NaCl, disrupted
with 0.1 mm glass beads using a bead beater and the broken cells were collected by
centrifugation for 40 min at 13,300 x g. The cell wall material was washed once with
1 M NaCl, three times with 0.5% SDS and three times with water. The material was
suspend in 30 ml water and incubated for 30 min at 60°C with gentle stirring. The cell
wall material was recovered by centrifugation at 34,600 x g for 20 min, washed once

with water and recovered again by centrifugation. The final pellet was suspended in
20ml 0.15mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 containing 0.2mg/ml trypsin and incubated at 37°C
for 18h. The material was recovered by centrifugation and washed with 1M Tris-HCl
pH 7.0, 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.0 containing 1M NaCl, 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and three
times with water. To hydrolyze WTA from peptidoglycan, the cell wall material was
incubated in 10% tricarboxylic acid (TCA) at 4°C for 18h. The peptidoglycan was
removed by centrifugation at 9,700xg for 45min. WTA was precipitated with 0.1
volume of 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 3 volumes of 95% ice cold ethanol and
held overnight at -80°C. The following day, the WTA was precipitated by
centrifugation at 9,700xg for 30min and was washed five times with 95% ethanol.
Following the last wash step the pellet was air-dried and the WTA was suspended in
500µl of water and lyophilized overnight. For the NMR analysis, 6mg of WTA was
suspended and lyophilized twice in 99.96%D₂O and finally suspended in 99.99%
D₂O. Spectra were acquired on a 600 MHz Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer
equipped with TCI cryoprobe and processed using Bruker TopSpin 3.1 software. The
experiment was performed in triplicate.

RESULTS

DltC remains within the cell

A key difference between the proposed models for D-alanine incorporation into TAs is the cellular location of the small carrier protein DltC. In the Fischer model this protein remains within the cytoplasm of the cell, while in the Neuhaus and Baddiley model the protein crosses the membrane and is at least transiently located on the outside of the cell (Fig. 1). To distinguish between these possibilities, we set out to determine the cellular location of DltC. To this end, S. aureus strain ANG 1484 was constructed for expression of DltC with a C-terminal His-tag from the anhydrotetracycline (Atet) inducible itet promoter (Fig. 2(a)). As a control, strain ANG 1729 containing an empty vector was used. Both strains were grown to mid-log phase in the presence of Atet and subsequently cell (cytoplasm and membrane), cell wall and supernatant fractions prepared. The DltC protein was detected by western blot using a His-tag specific antibody and detection of the cytoplasmically located ribosomal protein L6, the membrane protein SrtA, the cell wall protein SdrD and the secreted alpha-hemolysin (α-hem) provided fractionation controls (Fig. 2(b)). DltC was only detected in the cell fraction and no signal was observed in the cell wall or supernatant fraction (Fig. 2b). These data are in better agreement with the model proposed by Werner Fischer and colleagues.

DltD is oriented towards the outside of the cell

DltD contains an N-terminal hydrophobic domain, which serves to anchor the protein in the membrane. According to the Neuhaus and Baddiley model, the protein is anchored in the membrane with an N-out C-terminus in topology, while in the Fischer model DltD has the opposite orientation (Fig. 1). To investigate the membrane

289 topology of DltD, LacZ fusions were constructed with the first 40 amino acids or full-
290 length DltD and the fusion proteins were expressed in S. aureus from the inducible
291 itet promoter by the addition of Atet (Fig. 3(a)). LacZ is only active within the
292 cytoplasm of the cell and LacZ fusions with the first 3 amino acids of DltD or the
293 signal sequence of aureolysin served as cytoplasmic or secreted controls, yielding as
294 expected high or low β-galactosidase activities, respectively (Fig. 3(b)). Expression of
295 the 40 amino acid or full-length DltD-LacZ fusion proteins yielded very low activity,
296 indicating that DltD has an N-in C-terminus out membrane topology consistent with
297 the Fischer model (Fig. 3(b)).
298 To verify this result, protein fusions were designed with the stably folded
299 extracellular eLtaS domain of the lipoteichoic acid synthase enzyme LtaS. It has been
300 previously shown that when this domain is fused to a signal peptide or transmembrane
301 domain with an N-terminus in C-terminus out topology, it is cleaved by the signal
302 peptidase and can be readily detected in the culture supernatant by western blot
303 (Wörmann et al., 2011). The enzymatically inactive eLtaS_T300A variant containing a
304 C-terminal His-tag was fused to the first 40 or 100 amino acids of DltD and fusions
305 with the first 3 amino acids of DltD or the aureolysin signal peptide were produced as
306 cytoplasmic or exported controls, respectively (Fig. 4(a)). Cell and supernatant
307 fractions were prepared from S. aureus strains containing an empty vector (v) or
308 vectors for the expression of the different fusions proteins. The fusion proteins were
309 detected by western blot using an anti-His-tag antibody and the fractionation
310 technique was verified using antibodies specific for the cytoplasmically located
311 ribosomal protein L6 or the secreted alpha-hemolysin (Fig. 4(b)). As expected,
312 eLtaS_T300A-His was detected in the supernatant fraction for the aureolysin signal
313 peptide control fusion. Proteins were also detected in the supernatant fraction for the

40 and 100 amino acid DltD fusions, while no signals were detected for samples isolated from the empty vector containing control strain or a strain expressing the cytoplasmic 3aa-eLtaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His control fusion, the latter of which was detected in the cell fraction (Fig. 4(b)). Double bands were also observed in the cell fraction for the aurss-eLtaS<sub>T300A</sub>, DltD<sub>40aa</sub> and DltD<sub>100aa</sub> fusion proteins (Fig. 4(b)). The less intense upper bands, which differ in size between the different fusion proteins, likely correspond to the full-length proteins. The lower protein bands, which are of similar size for all fusion proteins, are likely fusion protein fragments that have been transported to the outside of the cell, cleaved by the signal peptidase, but not yet released from the cell wall. Taken together, the western blot data and the LacZ activity assays indicate that DltD has an N-in C-terminus out membrane topology, consistent with the Fischer model and a function for DltD on the outside of the cell.

LTA is required for efficient incorporation of D-alanines into WTA

Disruption of *dltA-D* in *S. aureus* results not only in a lack of D-alanine substitutions in LTA, but also WTA (Perego et al., 1995). While this may imply that the Dlt proteins are involved in the transfer of D-alanine onto WTA, studies using [¹⁴C]-alanine have shown that when the radioactivity is lost from the LTA fraction it increases in the WTA fraction (Haas et al., 1984; Koch et al., 1985). Based on these finding, it has been proposed that D-alanine-LTA is the D-alanine donor for WTA. To address this further, D-alanine incorporation into WTA was investigated in the LTA negative (∆ltaS) *S. aureus* strain 4S5. Of note, in a previous study a whole genome sequence analysis was performed on strain 4S5, which revealed that this strain contains an intact *dlt* operon (Corrigan et al., 2011). To this end, cultures of the wild-type *S. aureus* control strain and the LTA deficient strain 4S5 were grown to mid-log

phase, cell walls were purified and the WTA was released in acid conditions to retain

the D-alanine modifications. The purified WTA material was subsequently analyzed

by 1D proton NMR. Clear signals derived from protons from the D-alanine and N-

acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications were observed in WTA samples isolated

from the wild-type strain (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1). As previously reported (Bernal et al.,

2009), the ratio of the signal from the three methyl groups protons of D-Ala at 1.6

ppm to GlcNAc at 2.1 ppm was 0.54 ± 0.08 for WTA isolated from a WT strain (Fig.

5(a) and Fig. S1). On the other hand, the D-alanine specific signal in WTA isolated

from the LTA negative strain was drastically and statistically significant reduced,

yielding a D-Ala to GlcNAc ratio of 0.11 ± 0.01 (Fig. 5(b) and Fig S1). These results

show that LTA is important for efficient D-alanylation of WTA and are consistent

with a model in which D-alanine-LTA servers as major D-alanine donor for WTA.

However, an alternative mechanism in which LTA has an indirect role in the D-

alanylation of WTA could also take place, as discussed below.

DISCUSSION

In this study we revisited the Dlt-protein mediated D-alanine incorporation mechanism into TAs of Gram-positive bacteria. Using an in vitro assay system, it has been reported in a previous study that alanines can transfer without the requirement of ATP and in an enzyme and Dlt protein independent manner between LTA molecules (Childs et al., 1985). In a second study, it has been proposed that D-alanine-LTA is the D-alanine donor for WTA, however in this case it has been invoked that the process is enzyme-catalyzed (Haas et al., 1984). While in this study we did not address whether or not the redistribution of D-alanines between TAs is enzyme- catalyzed, the recent description of an LTA negative S. aureus strain allowed us to investigate the requirement of LTA for the D-alanylation of WTA further. We show here that the D-alanine content in WTA is drastically reduced in the absence of LTA, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that D-alanylated LTA is important for efficient modification of WTA (Fig. 5). However, our data also showed that even in the absence of LTA, some D-alanines are still present in WTA. This might suggest that WTA polymers, which have been transported to the outside of the membrane but are still linked to the undecaprenyl phosphate membrane carrier can, although very inefficiently, serve as an acceptor molecule for D-alanine modification by the Dlt system. This may in part reflect the transient location of lipid-carrier anchored WTA at the membrane-wall interface prior to incorporation into the cell wall. An LTA negative S. aureus strain has usually a severe growth defect (Grundling & Schneewind, 2007b), however the LTA negative S. aureus strain used in this study survives in the absence of LTA and grows nearly like a wild-type strain through the acquisition of compensatory mutations (Corrigan et al., 2011). Genome sequence analysis confirmed that the dlt operon is intact (Corrigan et al., 2011), which could

have been an alternative explanation for the reduced levels of D-alanines in WTA in
this strain. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that the observed reduction of
D-alanines in WTA is not due to an incorrect assembly of the DltB or DltD proteins in
the membrane caused by a lack of LTA rather than our suggestion that D-alanine LTA
is the major donor of D-alanines for WTA.
Two conflicting models have been proposed for the incorporation of D-
alanines into TAs although the initial steps are identical in both models. It has been
well established that the cytoplasmic D-alanine D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA,
which shows homology to the acetyl coenzyme A synthases, uses ATP to activate D-
alanine to form D-alanyl-AMP. In a second step, DltA then transfers this intermediate
onto the small D-alanyl carrier protein DltC, where the D-alanine is bound through a
thiol ester bond to the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group in DltC (Du et al., 2008;
Neuhaus & Baddiley, 2003; Osman et al., 2009; Yonus et al., 2008). DltC shows
sequence and structural homology to acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), which in bacteria
function in the cytoplasm of the cell and are involved in fatty acid and polyketide
biosynthesis pathways (Volkman et al., 2001). In this study, we show that DltC does
not cross the membrane (Fig. 2) and therefore it is unlikely that the protein is involved
in the final D-alanylation step of LTA on the outside of the cell. Furthermore, the
results presented in this study indicate that DltD has an N-in C-terminus out
membrane topology (Fig. 3). This places the functional part of the protein on the
outside of the cell and suggests that DltD aids in the final step of the D-alanine
incorporation into LTA. Both of these findings are only consistent with the model
proposed by Werner Fischer and colleagues (Fig. 1(a)). According to the Fischer
model, once DltC is charged with a D-alanine, the multi-membrane spanning protein
DltB transfers D-alanine from DltC to C55-P, resulting in the formation of a D-

404 alanine-P-C55 membrane intermediate. This hypothesis is based on the proposed
405 model for the glycosylation process of LTA (Fischer, 1994), though this membrane
406 intermediate has never been experimentally confirmed. Based on the hydropathy
407 profile and the TMHMM membrane topology prediction programme, DltB assembles
408 as a 10 transmembrane helix protein with both N- and C-termini located on the
409 outside. DltB has been grouped among membrane-bound O-acyltransferases
410 (MBOAT) family proteins, a group of enzymes that transfer organic acids onto
411 hydroxyl groups of membrane-embedded components (Hofmann, 2000). Some of the
412 best-characterized members of MBOAT proteins are enzymes involved in the re-
413 acylation of lyso-phospholipids (Shindou et al., 2009). This would be consistent with
414 the idea that DltB does not merely form a membrane channel but contains enzymatic
415 activity, which will be necessary for the formation of a membrane linked D-alanine
416 intermediate. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that DltB plays a role together with
417 DltD in the final cleavage and ligation of D-alanine to LTA.
418 The dlt operon in S. aureus encodes a fifth protein, DltX, which is a small
419 protein with an expected size of 5.9 kDa. DltX has been annotated to belong to the
420 DUF 3687 superfamily of proteins and currently 185 proteins with this domain are
421 listed in Pfam. With two exceptions, these proteins are encoded immediately upstream
422 of dltA in S. aureus strains, other Staphylococcus sp. and several other Firmicutes
423 including some Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Listeria, Streptococcus, or Enterococcus sp.
424 However, additional work is needed to determine the function of DltX and establish
425 whether or not this protein is involved in the D-alanylation process in S. aureus or
426 other Firmicutes.
427 Recently it has been shown that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the Gram-
428 negative bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholera O1 El Tor is also modified with amino

429 acids, specifically glycine or diglycine residues (Hankins et al., 2012). The machinery
430 used shows similarities to the D-alanine modification system of TAs in Gram-positive
431 bacteria. AlmF, which shows homology to DltA, activates the glycine residues using
432 ATP and ligates it to AlmE. AlmE does not show homology on the sequence level
433 with DltC, but shows functional and likely structural homology to DltC. Once AlmE
434 is charged with a glycine residue, it is transferred by AlmG, which contains a
435 lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) domain, onto LPS. Again, AlmG does not
436 share any sequence homology with DltB, but both proteins are predicted to belong to
437 acyltransferase enzyme families, and therefore it seems likely that as functional
438 homologs these proteins are required for the transfer of the amino acids from the
439 charged carrier protein to lipid-linked acceptor molecules (Hankins et al., 2012).
440 While additional work is needed to fully elucidate the mechanism of D-alanine
441 incorporation into Gram-positive cell wall polymers, our cellular location and
442 membrane topology studies on the S. aureus DltC and DltD proteins are in better
443 agreement with the model proposed by Werner Fischer and colleagues. Therefore we
444 suggest that future investigations into the D-alanine incorporation mechanism should
445 be designed with this model in mind. Our preliminary findings indicate that proteins
446 involved in the LTA synthesis and the D-alanylation process may physically interact
447 within bacterial cells and it will be interesting to investigate in future studies the
448 spatial and temporal coordination of the cell wall polymer synthesis machineries and
449 proteins responsible for their modification.

Figure 1. Models of D-alanine substitution of LTA. (a) Fischer model: DltA ligates D-alanines (small green circle) onto the carrier proteins DltC. Next, it has been proposed that, with the aid of DltB, the D-alanines are transferred from DltC to undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) and traverse the membrane, however experimental evidence for such a membrane-linked intermediate is still lacking. DltD is then involved in the final transfer of the D-alanines to LTA on the outside of the cell. (b) Neuhaus and Baddiley model: For this model, it was suggested that DltD functions within the cell and increases the efficiency of the DltA-mediated ligation of D- alanines to DltC. The charged DltC protein then crosses the membrane with the help of DltB and transfers the D-alanines onto LTA.

Figure 2. Cellular localization of DltC as assessed by western blot. (a) Schematic representation of dltC expression construct. The gene encoding for a C-terminally His tagged version of DltC is placed under the inducible tetracycline promoter (pitet) and its expression induced by the addition of the less toxic tetracycline-derivative anhydrotetracycline (Atet) (b) Determination of DltC localization by Western blot analysis. S. aureus strain ANG 1729 containing the empty vector pitet (v) or strain ANG 1484 containing pitet-dltC-His (dltC) were grown for 4½ h at 37°C in the presence of Atet and samples were subsequently separated into cell (cytoplasm and membrane), cell wall and supernatant (super) fractions and analysed by western blot using a His-tag specific antibody for the detection of DltC or antibodies specific for the ribosomal protein L6 (cytoplasmic), the sortase enzyme SrtA (membrane), the cell wall anchored protein SdrD (cell wall) and the secreted α-hemolysin Hla (supernatant). The molecular weight of protein standards is indicated on the right of

each panel. The experiment was performed in triplicate and a representative blot is shown.

Figure 3. Membrane topology of DltD as assessed by LacZ fusions and β-galactosidase activity assays. (a) Schematic representation of the different lacZ fusions. The dltD gene or the sequence encoding the first 40aa of dltD were cloned into pitet-lacZ giving rise dltD-lacZ fusions expressed from the Atet inducible promoter. Sequences encoding for the first three amino acids of dltD (3aa) and the signal sequence of aureolysin (aurss) were cloned upstream of lacZ, providing cytoplasmic and secreted controls, respectively. (b) Determination of β-galactosidase activity. S. aureus strains containing pitet-3aa-lacZ, pitet-aurs-lacZ, pitet-dltD-lacZ (dltD) and pitet-dltD₄₀ₐₐ-lacZ were grown for 4h at 37°C in the presence of 200 ng/ml Atet and samples were prepared for β-galactosidase activity assays as described in the Method section. The assay was performed in triplicate and the average values and standard deviations were plotted. Activity is given as μM per OD₆₀₀. T-test analysis was performed and values which are significantly different from the positive control (3aa) are indicated with asterisks as follows: *p<0.05, **p<0.01.

Figure 4. Membrane topology of DltD as assessed by western blot analysis using eLtaS₃₀₀ₐ fusion proteins. (a) Schematic representation of the vectors for the expression of the eLtaS₃₀₀ₐ-His fusions. Sequences encoding the first three amino acids of dltD (3aa) (cytoplasmic control) or the signal sequence of aureolysin (aurss) (secreted control) as well as the first 40 aa or first 100 aa of dltD were fused to eltaS₃₀₀ₐ-His and expressed from the Atet inducible promoter in S. aureus. (b) Schematic representation of the eLtaS₃₀₀ₐ-His fusion protein. A fusion protein with

an N-in C-terminus out membrane topology (left) will lead to secretion of eLtaS<sub>T300A</sub>-
His into the supernatant while a fusion protein with an N-out C-in membrane
topology (right) will cause the retention of eLtaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His in the cytoplasm of the cell.
(c) Detection of the eLtaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His protein fusions by western blot. S. aureus strains
containing the empty vector pitet(-), pitet-3aa-eltaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His, pitet-aurs-eltaS<sub>T300A</sub>-
His, pitet-dltD<sub>40aa</sub>-eltaS<sub>T300A</sub>-His or pitet-dltD<sub>100aa</sub>-eltaS<sub>T300A</sub> were grown in the
presence of 200 ng/ml Atet for 4 h at 37°C and subsequently cell (cell) and
supernatant (Super) fraction samples were prepared and analysed by western blot. The
HRP-conjugated anti-His antibody was used at a 1:10000 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal
antibodies against the control proteins L6 (cytoplasmic) and Hla (supernatant) were
used at a 1:20000 dilution, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG antibodies used at a 1:10000 dilution. This experiment was performed in
triplicate and a representative result is shown.

Figure 5. NMR analysis of WTA isolated from WT and LTA negative S. aureus
strains. S. aureus strains SEJ1 (WT) and 4S5 (LTA negative) where grown to mid-log
phase and WTA purified as described in the method section. Six mg of dried WTA
were suspended in 99.99% D<sub>2</sub>O and 1-D proton spectra acquired at 600 MHz. The
experiment was performed in triplicate and representative spectra are shown. The
ratio of the D-Ala to GlcNAc signal is 0.54 ± 0.08 for WTA isolated from a WT strain
and 0.11 ± 0.01 for WTA isolated from the LTA negative strain. A 2-tailed unequal
variance T-test indicated a p-value < 0.01 indicating statistically significant
differences. Peaks are annotated as previously described (Bernal et al., 2009) and full
spectra are shown in Fig. S1.
