**Abstract** The surface of plants is covered by cuticular wax, which contains a mixture of very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) derivatives. This wax surface provides a hydrophobic barrier which reduces non-stomatal water loss. One component of the cuticular wax is the alkyl esters, which typically contain a VLCFA esterified to an alcohol of a similar length. As part of an EST project, we recently identified an acyltransferase with 19% sequence identity (amino acid) to a bacterial ‘bifunctional’ wax-ester synthase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT). Northern analysis revealed that this petunia homologue was expressed predominantly within the petals. The cDNA encoding the WS/DGAT homologue was introduced into a yeast strain deficient in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The expressed protein failed to restore triacylglycerol biosynthesis, indicating that it lacked DGAT activity. However, isoamyl esters of fatty acids were detected, which suggested that the petunia cDNA encoded a wax-synthase. Waxes were extracted from petunia petals and leaves. The petal wax extract was rich in VLCFA esters of methyl, isoamyl, and short-to-medium straight chain alcohols (C4–C12). These low molecular weight wax-esters were not present in leaf wax. In-vitro enzymes assays were performed using the heterologously expressed protein and ¹⁴C-labelled substrates. The expressed protein was membrane bound, and displayed a preference for medium chain alcohols and saturated very long-chain acyl-CoAs. In fact, the activity would be sufficient to produce most of the low molecular weight wax-esters present in petals, with methyl-esters being the exception. This work is the first characterization of a eukaryotic protein from the WS/DGAT family.

Introduction

The surface of plants, referred to as the cuticle, can be sub-divided into two components: cutin and cuticular waxes. Cutin is a polymer of interesterified hydroxylated C16 and C18 fatty acid derivatives, which overlays the epidermal cell wall (Kolattukudy 1980; Nawrath 2002). This cutin layer is covered by and embedded with the cuticular waxes (Kunst and Samuels 2003), an organic solvent extractable layer of lipids derived primarily from VLCFAs (C20–C32). This cuticular wax layer provides a coating to the plant which restricts water loss (Riederer and Schreiber 2001), reflects UV radiation (Holmes and Keiller 2002), regulates the transport of solutes (Baur et al. 1999), and can also play a role in specific plant-insect interactions (Marks-tädter et al. 2000). The composition of cuticular waxes varies greatly between species and between different surfaces of the same plant. Typical components are alkanes, free fatty acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, alkyl-esters, diterpenoids and triterpenoids. The alkyl-esters (wax-esters) have been found in most cuticular waxes analysed, and range from being a minor component to the major constituent of the wax. The wax from leaves of *A. thaliana*, for example, contains only 0.1–0.2% esters (Jenks et al. 1995), whereas the wax from fronds of *Copernicia cerifera* contain up to 85% esters (Kolattukudy 1976). In addition to plant cuticular lipids, wax-esters are found widely in nature. They are present on the cuticle of insects, as storage lipids in jojoba seeds, in beeswax, in sperm-whale oil and as lipid inclusions in some *n*-alkane degrading bacteria (Kolattukudy 1976; Ishige et al. 2003).

Three unrelated families of wax (ester) synthases (WS) have been identified so far, all of which are acyl-CoA dependent transferases. The first identified WS was from jojoba (Lardizabal et al. 2000). This desert shrub is unusual in that the main storage lipid that accumulates within its seeds is wax-esters (>98%) rather than triacylglycerol (Ohlrogge et al. 1978). *Arabidopsis thaliana* contains twelve homologues of the jojoba wax synthase, though none have yet been characterized. The second WS characterized was that from the bacterium *Acinetobacter calcoaceticus*. This enzyme was in fact bifunctional in vivo, acting as a diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and a WS (Kal scheuer and Steinbüchel 2003). In-vitro, this enzyme is capable of using a wide range of substrates as acyl acceptors including alcohols of many chain lengths, 1,2 and 1,3-diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerol, α,ω-diols and even thiols (Kalscheuer and Steinbüchel 2003; Kal scheuer et al. 2003, 2004; Stöveken et al. 2005; Uthoff et al. 2005). This acyltransferase family is not widely distributed amongst the prokaryotes. It is almost exclusively restricted to the Actinomycetes, and particularly expanded within the *Mycobacterium* genus. *M. tuberculosis* for example has 15 homologues of the *Acinetobacter* WS/DGAT, and recent studies suggest that the mycobacterial genes may be involved in diverse functions. The activity of DGAT has recently been demonstrated for a number of these homologues, and it has been proposed that these enzymes may play an important role in the accumulation of triacylglycerol within the bacterium under hypoxic conditions (Daniel et al. 2004). Two homologues are located on an operon containing genes involved in cell-wall biosynthesis, suggesting that they could be involved in esterifications necessary for the production of the mycobacterial cell-wall (Singh et al. 2003). The sequenced genomes of *A. thaliana* and *Oryza sativa* contain 11 and 3 homologues of the *Acinetobacter* WS/DGAT, respectively. Additionally, a recent tBlastn search we conducted of plant EST databases indicated that this gene family is present in many angiosperm and gymnosperm plant species. In mammals, a third WS was recently identified which is involved in the synthesis of lipids present in sebum and meibum (Cheng and Russell 2004). This WS is a member of the acyltransferase family, which includes mammalian monoacylglycerol acyltransferases (MGAT) and DGATs (Cheng and Russell 2004), fungal DGATs, and DGAT2 from *A. thaliana* (Lardizabal et al. 2001; Oelkers et al. 2002). There are no further homologues of this protein in *A. thaliana*.

Cuticular wax biosynthesis has been the focus of much study, particularly in *A. thaliana*, maize and barley. A number of genes involved in cuticular wax synthesis have been identified, usually via screens for mutants which display a visibly altered plant surface, such as glossy rather than glaucous surface (Jenks et al. 1995; Post-Beittenmiller 1996). These mutants are typically referred to as glossy (*gl*) in maize and *eceriferum* (*cer*) in *Arabidopsis* and barley. The precise function for many of the genes identified by this approach is still unknown, but none encode proteins with homology to any of the known wax-ester synthases. Furthermore, the chemical analysis that has been performed on these mutants does not suggest that any of the genes identified by this approach encode wax-ester synthases. In summary, no plant cuticular wax-ester synthase has yet been identified, though based on the number of homologues present from both the jojoba WS and *Acinetobacter* WS/DGAT families in *A. thaliana*, one or more of these would seem likely candidates. During a recent EST project within our laboratory, we were attempting to identify acyltransferases from petunia flower which may be involved in the biosynthesis of lipids in the

stigma exudates (Matsuzaki et al. 1986; Koiwai and Matsuzaki 1988). One of the acyltransferases we identified had significant homology to the bifunctional Acinetobacter WS/DGAT. Expression analysis of this gene revealed that is was highly expressed within the petals. We present evidence that this acyltransferase is involved in the synthesis of a range of wax-esters found in the petunia petal, which are comprised of a VLCFA esterified to a short-to-medium chain alcohol (≤12 carbons).

### Materials and methods

#### Materials

Behenoyl-CoA was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). 1-¹⁴C palmitic acid (1,961 kBq μmol⁻¹) and 1-¹⁴C-n-octanol (141 kBq μmol⁻¹) were from American Radiolabelled Chemicals (St Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals, including acyl-CoAs and alcohol substrates were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise.

#### EST database construction and analysis

One milligram of total RNA was extracted from the stigma of petunia flowers at the 1–2 cm unopened bud developmental stage. A custom cDNA library which contained 9.0 × 10⁷ primary plaques was constructed from this RNA by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA) in the Uni-Zap vector. Plasmid DNA (pBlueScript SK-) was produced via in vivo mass excision according to Stratagene's protocols. The resulting plasmid DNA was used for the production of an EST library at Michigan State University. The EST library was produced from a total of 8,737 high-quality 5′-sequencing runs which yielded 1,111 multi-sequence clusters and 4,578 singletons. Sequences were annotated using results from a tBlastn search of GenBank.

#### RNA extraction and blotting

Total RNA was extracted from plant tissues using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA) Plant RNA Miniprep kit or alternatively, for large-scale preparations, the trizol method (Chomczynski and Saachi 1987). DIG labelled cDNA probes were made via PCR from a plasmid cDNA library template using primers 5′-TTCG GCAGGAATTGAAGATT-3′ and 5′-ATTAAC TTAAATGCAATTTGTAA-3′. Total RNA (2 μg) was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel (containing 2% formaldehyde) and then blotted by upward capillary transfer onto Hybond N+ (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Transfer of RNA was verified by staining blots with 0.02% methylene blue. RNA blots were then developed following the manufacturer’s hybridization and detection protocols (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA).

#### Yeast strains and growth conditions

* *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* JCY500 (*MATα trpl-1 ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 are1Δ::HIS3 are2Δ::LEU2 dga1Δ::TRP1 lro1Δ::Kan'*) was the kind gift of Dennis Voelker (Quittnat et al. 2004). Cells were grown on SD medium (complete or without uracil) containing 2% glucose (maintenance on medium solidified with 2% agar), raffinose (precultures) or 2% galactose (induced cultures) as the sole carbon source. The nitrogen source was either 0.5% (NH₄)₂SO₄ or leucine as indicated. The yeast cultures were grown at 30°C in an orbital shaker at 250 r.p.m.

#### Heterologous expression of the wax synthase homologue

The coding region of the petunia wax synthase cDNA was amplified from a library clone containing the full-length cDNA via PCR using primers 5′-CACCATGA AGTCACTTGCCACA-3′ and 5′-TGATCATTTTCA GATTCTT-3′ and *Pfu* polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was gel purified and transferred into pTOPO/SD using Invitrogen’s Topo cloning kit to create a Gateway entry vector. This entry vector was used to create a galactose inducible yeast expression vector in pYES-DEST52. This expression vector was transformed into *S. cerevisiae* JCY500 via the lithium acetate method (Geitz and Woods 2002). For induction of protein expression, overnight starter cultures grown in raffinose medium were used to inoculate galactose medium at an OD600 of 0.1. These cultures were harvested during mid-exponential phase (OD600 of 1–2) and the cells pelleted at 3,000 g for 5 min. All subsequent steps were performed 4°C, using ice-cold buffers. Cells were washed once in sterile water, and then resuspended in extraction buffer (100 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.1, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1.2 M sorbitol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg ml⁻¹ leupeptin, 1 μg ml⁻¹ pepstatin A and 1.2 M sorbitol). Cells were then broken in 2ml screw-cap tubes with 0.5 mm glass beads using four 30 s cycles in the Biospec Minibeadbeater (Bio-spec Products Inc., OK, USA), with 1 min cooling in ice-water between cycles. The caps of the 2ml tubes were then pierced with a 25-gauge needle and then placed inverted in 15 ml Falcon tubes. Cell lysates were
recovered by centrifugation at 4,000g for 1 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged for a further 5 min at 2,000g to remove any intact cells and cell ghosts. The lysate was then centrifuged at 400,000g for 15 min in an ultracentrifuge to obtain a soluble (supernatant) and microsomal (pellet) fraction. The microsomal fraction was washed once and then resuspended in extraction buffer by gentle agitation with a glass rod. Aliquots of the microsomal and soluble fractions were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at $-86^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) with BSA as a standard.

### Radiolabelled acyl-coenzyme A synthesis

$[1-{ }^{14} \mathrm{C}]$-palmitoyl-CoA was synthesized enzymatically (Taylor et al. 1990) using acyl-coenzyme A synthetase from *Pseudomonas putida* obtained from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA, USA). A two-step purification process was used to remove unreacted free fatty acids and coenzyme A. The reaction (final volume of 800 μl) was acidified with 10 μl of HCl and washed three times with 1.6 ml of diethyl ether. 1.6 ml of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and 0.6 ml of 4 M NaCl was then added, and the acyl-CoA extracted twice with 1.5 ml of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ saturated $n$-butanol. The combined butanol extracts were then extracted twice with 3 ml of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to remove salt. The butanol was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and the acyl-CoA dissolved in 1 ml of 80 mM $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$. The acyl-CoA was then loaded onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and eluted with 3 ml of 0.4 M $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ in 80% methanol and neutralized immediately with 150 μl of glacial acetic acid. The acyl-CoA was then dried under $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and dissolved in 1 ml 80 mM $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$.

### Enzyme assays

Enzyme assays were conducted at $32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a volume of 25 μl and contained final concentrations of 100 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.1, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% (by vol) Triton X-100 and 1 mg ml${}^{-1}$ lipid-free BSA. For comparison of reactions rates with different alcohols, the palmitoyl-CoA concentration was kept at 50 μM. Alcohols were prepared as double concentration stock solutions in 0.04% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2 mg ml${}^{-1}$ BSA by sonification. Reactions were preincubated at $32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 5 min and initiated via the addition of enzyme (5 μl of 5 μg μl${}^{-1}$ microsomal protein). Reactions were terminated after 20 min by the addition of 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). The reaction was then partitioned with 200 μl of 1 M NaCl and the chloroform layer recovered and evaporated under nitrogen. The lipids were then dissolved in a minimal volume of chloroform and separated on a 250 μM thick silica gel K60 TLC plate (EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ, USA) developed with hexane/diethyl ether/formic acid (70/30/1, by vol). The wax-ester products were then quantified using a Packard Instant Imager (Meriden, CT, USA). For comparison of reaction rates with different acyl-CoAs, 250 μM $[1-{ }^{14} \mathrm{C}]$-$n$-octanol and 50 μM acyl-CoAs were used.

#### Extraction of yeast lipids

Totals lipids were extracted from 50 ml stationary phase cultures of yeast which were resuspended in water to a final volume of 1 ml and then broken with glass beads as described above. The cell lysate (including debris) was then extracted with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). The extract was then partitioned by the addition of 2 ml of 1 M NaCl and the chloroform layer dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The chloroform was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and the lipids resuspended in a 100 μl of chloroform. A 20 μl aliquot of the lipids were then applied to a 250 μM thick silica Gel K60 TLC plate which was developed with hexane/diethyl ether/formic acid (80/20/1, by vol). Lipids were located by UV exposure after spraying with 0.02% primulene in 80% acetone (w/v/v).

#### Plant maintenance and extraction and analysis of cuticular waxes

*Petunia hybrida* W115 (cv ‘Mitchell’, Ball Seed Co., West Chicago, IL, USA) was grown in the greenhouse with day cycles of 14 h at $23-24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ followed by 10 h night cycles at $22-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Cuticular waxes were extracted from 8–12 g of petal or leaf tissue by washing once with 100 ml and once with 50 ml of hexane for 30 s. A third hexane wash did not recover a significant amount of wax (supplementary Fig. 1). The hexane was then removed from the combined extracts by rotary evaporation at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ under reduced pressure. The extract was then placed in a vacuum desiccator overnight to remove any low molecular weight volatile components. The wax fraction ($<30 \mathrm{mg}$) was then dissolved in hexane and applied to a 1 g silica gel (Iatrobeads, Mitsubishi Raguka Iatron Inc., Tokyo, Japan) column which had been equilibrated with hexane. Lipids were then eluted with 10 ml of (A) hexane, (B) pentene stabilized chloroform, (C) acetone and (D) methanol. Under these conditions which are routinely used in our laboratory, wax-esters are eluted in the $\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}$. The mass of each fraction were determined by performing triplicate measurements on a Mettler Toledo XS105 balance, recording each mass to withinthe tenth of a milligram range. Fractions were then analysed by GC-MS with or without the derivitization treatments described below.

### Production of FAMES and TMS derivatives

One hundred micrograms of the wax-ester containing CHCl₃ fraction obtained from silica gel chromatography was dissolved in 1.3 ml of transmethylation reagent (19/6/1, by vol, methanol/toluene/conc. H₂SO₄ + 50 mg l⁻¹ BHT) and refluxed for 2 h at 80°C. After cooling, 5 ml of 1 M NaCl was added and the FAMES and fatty alcohols extracted into 2 × 2 ml of hexane. The combined hexane layers were evaporated under N₂ and dissolved in 0.5 ml of CHCl₃. The CHCl₃ was then applied to a 1 g silica gel column and the FAMEs eluted with 10 ml CHCl₃ and the fatty alcohols with 10 ml of acetone. The FAMEs fraction was concentrated by evaporation before GC-MS analysis. The acetone fraction containing the fatty alcohols was evaporated under N₂ and dissolved in 100 μl of a 1/1 (by vol) mix of hexane and 99/1 BSTFA/TMCS and heated to 70°C for 1 h. The reagent was then evaporated under N₂ before dissolving the reaction products in hexane for GC-MS analysis.

### Production of nicotinates

An aliquot of 0.5–1 mg of the wax-ester containing fraction obtained from the column chromatography was dissolved in 500 μl of transmethylation reagent. The wax-ester fractions were then refluxed at 80°C for 2 h to produce FAMES and free alcohols. The reaction was then cooled on ice and 16 ml of 1 M NaCl added. The FAMES and free alcohols were extracted into 4 ml of chloroform, which was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. A 1 ml aliquot of the chloroform layer was transferred to a vial for GC-MS analysis. The remaining 3 ml of chloroform was cooled on ice and converted to nicotinates (Christie 2003). The reaction was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and dissolved in 2 ml hexane. Insoluble material was removed by filtration through a glass-wool plugged Pasteur pipette, and then the filtrate was added to a 1 g silica gel column that had been prepared in hexane. The column was washed with the 10 ml of chloroform, and the nicotine esters of the alcohols eluted in 10 ml of acetone. The acetone fraction was the evaporated under nitrogen and dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform prior to GC-MS analysis. This clean-up procedure was sufficient to remove the bulk of the unreacted N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide which otherwise had a retention time which masked peaks of nicotine esters. Nicotine esters straight chain alcohols (C4–C8), isoalcohols (C4–C6) and anteisoamyl alcohol were also produced via this method to serve as references for GC-MS analysis (retention times and mass spectra).

#### GC-MS analysis

All analyses were performed using a Thermofinnigan GCQ coupled to a Polaris MS and AS2000 autosampler. Sample injections volumes were 1 μl. Plant waxes, FAMES and TMS derivatives were analysed using a Rtx-5MS column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film; Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) using a temperature program of 100°C for 1 min, to 300°C at 20°C min⁻¹, hold at 300°C for 10 min, to 350°C at 20°C min⁻¹, hold at 350°C for 10 min. Yeast lipids and nicotine esters were analysed on a DB23 column (20 m, 0.2 mm ID, 0.2 μm film; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA), using a temperature program of 100°C for 3 min, to 250°C at 20°C min⁻¹, hold at 250°C for 10 min.

#### Results

A putative WS/DGAT is expressed predominantly within the petals

We have identified a cDNA, designated *PhWSI*, which encoded a putative WS/DGAT. This cDNA was one of a number of acyltransferase gene candidates from a petunia stigma EST project. The aim of this stigma EST project was to identify genes which may be involved in the synthesis of estolides in the stigma exudates in *Solanaceae* (Matsuzaki et al. 1983, 1986; Koiwai and Matsuzaki 1988). The cDNA encoded a 522 amino acid protein with a sequence that was 19% identical to an *A. calcoaceticus* WS/DGAT. The protein had a predicted molecular weight of 59.3 kDa and a pI of 6.52. An alignment of protein encoded by *PhWSI*, the *A. calcoaceticus* WS/DGAT, three putative DGATs from *M. tuberculosis* (Daniel et al. 2004), and three *A. thaliana* homologues of unknown function is shown in Fig. 1, with the putative catalytic HHXXXDG motif highlighted. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis of *PhWSI* and the *A. thaliana* WS/DGAT homologues reveals that the petunia protein does not cluster with any of the Arabidopsis proteins (supplementary Fig. 2). To determine the spatial expression pattern of the petunia WS/DGAT gene we probed a blot that contained RNA from petunia stem, leaves, and a variety of floral tissues (Fig. 2). The mRNA encoding the putative WS/DGAT was detected only within floral tissues, and in particular,

The putative catalytic HHXXXDG motif is highlighted by the black bar

Ribosomal RNA bands stained with 0.02% (w/v) methylene blue are also shown. Tissue samples are as follows: lane *a* stem, *b* leaves, *c* unopened flowers 1–2 cm less stigma, *d* unopened 5–6 cm flowers less stigma, *e* stigma from 1–2 cm flowers, *f* stigma from 5 to 6 cm flowers, *g* style, *h* anther and filament, *i* ovaries, *j* petal and *k* sepals. Tissues in lanes *g–k* were also from 5–6 cm flowers

within the petals and, to a much lesser level, within the stigma.

Expression of PhWS1 directs isoamyl wax-ester biosynthesis in yeast

Because the putative WS/DGAT had significant homology to a family of proteins which includes bacterial DGATs, we examined whether the protein had any DGAT activity. Therefore we introduced this cDNA into a S. cerevisiae strain which is deficient in TAG (and steryl ester) biosynthesis (Oelkers et al. 2002; Sandager et al. 2002; Quittnat et al. 2004). S. cerevisiae is generally a good model system for analysing plant DGAT activity because it produces diacylglycerides containing long chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids like those found in plant oils. TLC analysis of the lipids extracted from S. cerevisiae JCY 500 revealed that the expression of the petunia cDNA did not restore TAG biosynthesis in this yeast strain. However, a novel lipid product, with equivalent polarity to steryl and wax esters, was detected (Fig. 3a). GC-MS analysis revealed that these lipids were isoamyl esters of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), arachidic (C20:0), behenic (C22:0) and lignoceric acid (C24:0). Isoamyl arachidate was the most abundant of these lipids (Fig. 3b). S. cerevisiae produces isoamyl alcohol via catabolism of leucine (Dickinson et al. 1998). To elevate the intracellular iso- amyl alcohol concentration in the yeast, we replaced the 0.5% ammonium sulphate in the SD growth medium with 0.5% leucine. As a result, the level of isoamyl esters produced increased, and the wax-ester profile

Lipids were located by exposure to UV after spraying with \(0.05 \%\) primulene. The spots located at the top of the plates for the yeast cells expressing PhWS1 correspond to isoamyl esters. **b, c** GC chromatographs showing isoamyl esters produced by *S. cerevisiae* cells grown in \((\mathrm{NH}_{4})_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\) or leucine nitrogen source SC medium (**b**, **c**, respectively). *The numbers above the peaks indicate the number of carbons present in the saturated fatty acid of the isoamyl esters.* **d** Comparison of the mass spectra produced from an authentic isoamyl ester standard, and the ester produced by *S. cerevisiae* expressing the petunia wax synthase cDNA

now included monoenoic fatty acids, although these were less abundant than their saturated counterparts (Fig. 3c). Yeast grown on leucine as a sole nitrogen source produced isoamyl stearate as the most abundant wax-ester. The structures of each of the wax-esters was confirmed by comparing the GC retention times and mass spectra with those of synthetic standards (Fig. 3d).

PhWS1 encodes a membrane-bound enzyme alcohol-acyltransferase

The production of the isoamyl esters of fatty acids in yeasts suggested that PhWS1 encodes an alcohol-acyl-

transferase. The *A. calcoaceticus* DGAT/WS has been shown to be localized mainly to the plasma membrane and the surface of the lipid bodies which accumulate in this bacterium (Stöveken et al. 2005). A Kyte-Doolittle plot of protein corresponding to PhWS1 revealed that it contained two domains with a hydrophobicity score above 1.5 (Kyte and Doolittle 1982). These regions were predicted to be transmembrane with TMAP software (Persson and Argos 1996) using a multiple alignment of petunia protein and the eleven *A. thaliana* homologues as input data (Fig. 4a). The N-terminal of the protein, which includes the putative catalytic HHXXXDG motif, is predicted to be cytosolic.

Petunia petals produce significant amounts of medium-chain alcohol wax-esters in their cuticular wax.

Acyl-esters of alcohols containing long-chain fatty acids are not volatile. Therefore, the preliminary analysis of the *PhWS1* suggested that it may encode a protein responsible for the synthesis of cuticular wax-esters rather than the volatile esters responsible for petal aroma. However, the cuticular wax-esters of plants typically contain VLC fatty alcohols from the acyl-reduction pathway, though wax-esters containing smaller alcohols (including aromatic) have been reported in a number of species (Gulz 1993; Sümmerchen et al. 1995; Goodwin et al. 2003). In an example relevant to this study, Goodwin et al. (2003) reported the presence of fatty-acid esters of an alcohol which they tentatively identified as 3-hydroxy-heptan-2-ol in wax from the petals of snapdragon. To determine whether the alcohol-acyltransferase activity that was observed for the enzyme encoded by *PhWS1* had any biological relevance to the plant from which it was obtained, we analysed the cuticular waxes of petunia petals and leaves. To partially purify the wax-esters, we performed silica gel column chromatography. Under the conditions used, wax-esters were eluted in the chloroform fraction, as confirmed by GC-MS. Fractionation of a wax-extract from petunia petals via silica gel chromatography yielded a chloroform fraction accounting for 39.0% of the recovered material (Table 1). The total recovered material was typically >95% (data not shown). The chloroform fraction from the leaf waxes only accounted for 6.1% of the waxes. GC-MS analysis of the chloroform fraction from petunia petals produced a chromatogram in which 83.9 ± 0.6% of the peak area corresponded to low-molecular weight esters (C21–C36) consisting of saturated VLCFA and short chain alcohols (Fig. 5a). Production of FAMES confirmed that these were saturated VLCFA, with the order of predominance being C24 > C22 > C26 > C20 > C28 (Fig. 5b). Analysis of the mass-spectral data indicated that the alcohol components of the wax-esters included methanol, and amyl, hexyl and octyl alcohols. To determine the structures of these 5–8 carbon alcohols present within the wax-ester, the alcohols were liberated from the fatty acids by transmethylation and converted to nicotinate esters. By comparing the retention times and mass spectra of the petal-wax derived nicotinates with those produced from alcohol standards, we were able to identify these alcohols as isoamyl, *n*-hexyl and *n*-octyl alcohols (Fig. 5c). Additionally, minor amounts of *n*-butyl, *n*-decyl and *n*-dodecyl nicotinates were also observed. Esters of these minor alcohols were not

Assays were conducted with 20 μg microsomal protein, 250 μM isoamyl alcohol, 50 μM \[^{14}C\] palmitoyl-CoA in 25 μl reactions at 32°C for 20 min. Reaction products were extracted into chloroform and applied to a TLC plate which was developed with hexane/diethyl ether/formic acid (70/30/1, by vol). The image was obtained by autoradiometry. Only the region of the TLC plate corresponding to wax-esters is shown

To determine whether petunia protein was membrane localized, acyltransferase assays were conducted on soluble and membrane protein extracts from *S. cerevisiae* JCY500 cells expressing *PhWS1*. Isoamyl alcohol and \[^{14}C\]-palmitoyl-CoA were used as substrates (Fig. 4b). Activity was found only in the membrane fraction of yeast cells expressing *PhWS1*. Using isoamyl alcohol and \[^{14}C\]-palmitoyl-CoA as substrates, the assay was also optimised with respect to pH. The assay was conducted between pH 6.8 and 8.0, with the highest activity being obtained at pH 7.1 (data not shown). However, it should be noted that diversion of the \[^{14}C\]-palmitoyl-CoA into phospholipids and free fatty acids were competing reactions in this crude microsomal assay, and the higher activity at pH 7.1 was partly due to the lower activity of these competing reactions at this pH.

Lipids (<30 mg) were fractionated on a 1 g silica gel column (Iatrobeads) by elution with 10 ml portions of solvents of increasing polarity. Amounts indicated are percentages of the total wax recovered (±SD, \( n = 3 \)), which was typically >95% of the loaded material.

VLC alcohols (C22–C28). Leaf waxes also contained C20–C28 fatty acids esterified to C28–C32 alcohols (data not shown).

The use of hexane is well-established for the removal of surface waxes from leaves. Petals, however, are much thinner than leaves. To determine whether this extraction process removed any intracellular lipids from petals, we analysed silica gel chromatography fraction by TLC for the presence of phospholipids (supplementary Fig. 1). Phospholipids, which would have been eluted from the silica gel with methanol, were not visible on TLC plates sprayed with primulene. They were, however, visible in extracts of the hexane-washed petals ground in chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). Additionally, we were able to recover additional wax-esters from the hexane-washed petals, indicating that wax-esters were not completely extractable by hexane. This may represent cuticular waxes that have not yet been exported from the cells.

The enzyme encoded by *PhWS1* displays a preference for medium-chain alcohols.

Preliminary analysis of the reaction with *n*-octanol as a substrate at concentrations from 100–1,000 μM revealed that the reaction was still linear at 20 min. However, the reaction appeared to be somewhat inhibited at higher concentrations of octanol, perhaps due to its limited solubility (Fig. 6). All subsequent reactions were therefore carried out using 250 μM of alcohol as

Benzyl alcohol could also act as an acyl-acceptor, but not 2-phenylethanol.

The enzyme encoded by *PhWSI* prefers saturated long and very long chain fatty acyl-CoA esters

To confirm that the reactions were dependent on acyl-CoAs rather than free fatty acids, we performed the reaction using 14C-octan-1-ol as an acyl acceptor, and C16:0, C18:0 and C18:1 free fatty acids and acyl-CoA esters as substrates. For each fatty acid, the activity observed with the CoA-esters ranged from 300–600 pmol min\(^{-1}\) mg\(^{-1}\) whereas the activity for of the free fatty acids was barely above the background activity (supplementary Table 1). This ‘background’ activity may occur due presence of trace amounts of acyl-CoAs present in the microsomal protein preparations.

The profile of wax-esters produced by the S. cerevisiae strain expressing *PhWSI* was somewhat enriched in saturated fatty acids. When the yeast was grown on ammonium as a nitrogen source, the isoamyl esters were also enriched in VLCFAs. These results suggested that that petunia wax-synthase may prefer saturated VLC acyl-CoAs as substrates. We confirmed this in vitro by performing assays with various acyl-CoAs as shown in Table 3. Activity was threefold and 1.7-fold less for C16 and C18 monoenoic acyl-CoA

et al. 2005). Therefore, saturated VLC acyl-CoAs such as 20:0, 22:0 and 24:0 probably make up less than one percent of the available acyl-CoAs within the yeast cells used in this study, which were grown under similar conditions. The profile of isoamyl esters produced when the yeast was grown on leucine was different to that of the yeast grown on ammonium sulphate. There was still a strong bias towards the saturated acyl species, but stearic acid was the most predominant fatty acid. This was probably due to a depletion of the VLC acyl-CoAs under conditions of enhanced wax-ester synthesis at the higher internal isoamyl alcohol concentrations.

The preference of the *PhWSI* encoded acyltransferase for short-chain alcohols also supports the conclusion that it is involved in petal wax-esters biosynthesis. However, the petunia protein preferred $n$-decanol and $n$-dodecanol rather than shorter chain (C4–C6) alcohols. $n$-Decanol and $n$-dodecanol were only minor components of the wax esters compared to $n$-hexanol and isoamyl alcohol. The petal waxes contained methyl-esters. The wax-synthase encoded by *PhWSI* was not able to produce methyl esters in vitro. This suggests that these methyl-esters are likely to be the product of another acyltransferase. High molecular weight wax-esters were also present within the petunia petal (i.e., those containing VLC alcohols). Synthesis of these esters would also require an additional WS activity, as the wax synthase encoded by *PhWSI* could not acylate VLC alcohols.

### Discussion

We have demonstrated that a petunia homologue of the *A. calcoaceticus* WS/DGAT is capable of synthesizing a range of low molecular weight wax esters. This is the first characterization of a member of this gene family from plants, and the first identification of a cuticular wax-ester synthase. The preferred in vitro substrates for the petunia enzyme appear to be saturated VLC acyl-CoAs (C20 and C22), and medium chain alcohols (C8–C12). The in vitro preference for the saturated VLC acyl-CoAs is supported by the observation that the wax-esters obtained from the petunia petal contained saturated VLCFA. Additionally, when expressed in *S. cerevisiae*, the predominant wax-ester species produced were isoamyl esters of saturated fatty acids. When yeast was grown on ammonium sulphate as a nitrogen source, the levels of the VLCFA (C20–C24) in the wax-esters were particularly enriched relative to the typical internal acyl-CoA pools. When intracellular acyl-CoA profiles of yeast grown in SD galactose medium have been analysed, the only acyl-CoA esters that have been detected are 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1 and 22:1 (Aharoni et al. 2000; Gaigg et al. 2001; Tonon
Although *PhWSI* belongs to an acyltransferase family which includes DGATs, the acyltransferase encoded by this cDNA did not have the capacity to restore TAG biosynthesis in a neutral-lipid deficient yeast strain. Additionally, no acyltransferase activities were observed with either monoolein or diolein as substrates in in vitro assays. Therefore, it would appear that *PhWSI*, unlike its counterpart in *A. calcoaceticus*, is not involved in glycerolipid biosynthesis.

The lack of DGAT activity in petunia wax synthase is not without precedence in the WS/DGAT family of proteins. All 15 homologues from *M. tuberculosis* H37Rv have been analyzed for both DGAT and WS activity (Daniel et al. 2004). Only four of the proteins displayed significant levels of DGAT activity, and none appeared to be wax-ester synthases. Furthermore, the three other protein families containing enzymes that synthesize TAG also contain members which acylate substrates other than DAG. The DGAT1 family contains sterol acyltransferases with no detectable DGAT activity (Cases et al. 1998). The DGAT2 family includes the mammalian wax-synthases, which also lack DGAT activity (Cheng and Russell 2004). The phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase from *S. cerevisiae* belongs to a protein family which includes the phospholipid:sterol acyltransferases and phospholipases (Dahlqvist et al. 2000; Thomaeus et al. 2001; Noiriel et al. 2004; Ståhl et al. 2004; Banas et al. 2005).

Based on searches of the public EST databases, it appears that the WS/DGAT gene family is broadly extended in terrestrial plants. WS/DGAT homologues have been found in many other plant species, including monocots (*Triticum aestivum*, GenBank accession CK163450) and gymnosperms (*Pinus taeda*, GenBank accession CV032126). *Arabidopsis thaliana* has eleven members of the WS/DGAT family. To date, none of the *A. thaliana* members of this gene family have been characterized. Some of these may be wax-ester synthases, but this species is not known to produce significant amounts of these esters in its cuticular wax. Therefore, it is unlikely that these are all proteins involved in the synthesis of wax-esters. Expression data for five of the *A. thaliana* WS/DGAT genes is already available in the Arabidopsis Lipid Gene Database (Beisson et al. 2003). This includes highly detailed microarray data obtained as part of the AtGenExpress project (Schmid et al. 2005). These data reveal that many of the *A. thaliana* WS/DGAT genes are highly upregulated in specific plant tissues. Of the five sequences for which microarray expression data is available, only one of these (*At3g49210*) appears to be upregulated within the petal. The gene appears to be upregulated within petals of stage 15 petals (2 days after flower opening) but not within stage 12 petals (just prior to flower opening) (Smyth et al. 1990). It should be noted that this gene is also upregulated within a number of other tissues, including the sepals of stage 15 flowers, senescing leaves, roots and stamens. *At3g49210* displays 45% sequence identity to *PhWSI*, which is not significantly higher than the sequence identity observed between *PhWSI* and the other *A. thaliana* WS/DGAT homologues (supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, despite being expressed in the petals, there is little to suggest that *At3g49210* is functionally equivalent to *PhWSI*. The availability of the *A. thaliana* microarray data should serve as a useful starting point in determining the functions of other members of this gene family. Other possible functions for the *A. thaliana* proteins include triacylglycerol, cutin or suberin biosynthesis.

The types of wax-ester observed in the petunia petals were unusual in that they contain low molecular weight alcohols in contrast to the VLC fatty alcohols that are typically observed in cuticular wax. These shorter-chain wax-esters were absent from the leaf wax. It is quite possible that these unusual esters may be present within the petal wax to confer some property specific to the role of the petal. The petal waxes would need to be permeable to volatile semiochemicals such as methyl benzoate (Underwood et al. 2005). Petal waxes may also need to be more UV-transparent than leaf waxes, as petals often have demarcations within the UV spectrum visible to pollinators (Gronquist et al. 2001). As there is wide variation in wax composition however, it is difficult to draw conclusions how these unusual waxes relate to petal function.

The VLC fatty alcohols usually found in cuticular wax (either as free alcohols, or esterified to fatty acids) are produced by the reduction of VLC acyl-CoA species produced by an ER-localized elongation system (Kunst and Samuels 2003). Stearoyl-CoA is typically the primer for the production of these VLC acyl-CoAs. Therefore, the small-to-medium chain alcohol species present in the petunia petal waxes are clearly produced via a pathway distinct from that involved in VLC acyl-CoA biosynthesis. The straight-chained alcohols present in the petal wax-esters were all even-numbered in chain length. This two-carbon elongation series strongly suggests that they are produced via the reduction of acyl-intermediates from a FAS-type fatty acid biosynthesis reaction. Indeed, pathways for the production of medium chain fatty acids have already been shown to operate in petunia and other solanaceous plants for the production of acylated sugars in trichome exudates (van der Hoeven and Steffens 2000; Kroumova
and Wagner 2003). The only branched-chain alcohol found in the wax-esters was isoamyl alcohol. There are a number of possible routes for the biosynthesis of this alcohol, including the transamination and decarboxylation of leucine, as observed in *S. cerevisiae* (Dickinson et al. 1998).

The enzymes assays conducted with the heterologously expressed protein indicated that the petunia wax-synthase is a membrane-bound protein. This was in agreement with prediction obtained using TMAP software (Persson and Argos 1996). As the ER membranes are thought to be the site of cuticular wax biosynthesis in plants (Kunst and Samuels 2003), this would seem a likely location for the wax synthase. None of the known C-terminal ER retrieval signals were found within wax-synthase peptide sequence; i.e., the H/KDEL, dilysine motifs (Pagny et al. 1999), or the more cryptic aromatic amino-acid rich domains recently characterized in plants (McCartney et al. 2004). However, the lack of these known ER retention sequences does not rule out the possibility of the petunia wax-synthase protein being ER-bound.

In summary we report here the first characterization of a member of the WS/DGAT family in plants. The protein encoded by *PhWSI* lacks DGAT activity, and functions in the flower petals to produce low-molecular weight cuticular wax-esters.
