In *Escherichia coli*, the multi-enzyme RNA degradosome contributes to the global, posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. The degradosome components are recognized through natively unstructured 'microdomains' comprising as few as 15–40 amino acids. Consequently, the degradosome might experience a comparatively smaller number of evolutionary constraints, because there is little requirement to maintain a folded state for the interaction sites. New regulatory properties of the degradosome could arise with relative rapidity, because partners that modify its function could be recruited by quickly evolving microdomains. The unusual combination of the centrality of RNA degradation in gene expression and the generality of natively unstructured microdomains in recognition can fortuitously confer a capacity for efficacious adaptive change to degradosome-like assemblies in eubacteria.

Introduction

Most mRNA molecules are destroyed shortly after they are synthesized. Despite the apparent wastefulness, this and other ‘futile’ cycles could in fact confer the considerable selective benefits of ensuring fidelity and enabling rapid responses to environmental change. Furthermore, any mechanism that affects transcript turnover can provide a means of controlling gene expression, often in complex ways. In *Salmonella enterica*, for example, the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is a global regulator of virulence and persistence, which means that mutations in PNPase affect the capacity of this organism to infect tissues [1].

It seems likely that transcript turnover can operate at different levels of a regulatory hierarchy, and thus can link different centres in networks of genetic control and metabolism. Such extra layers of connectivity in regulatory control could facilitate the coordination of different metabolic pathways that might not otherwise communicate, thereby minimizing any wasteful effort or optimizing the robustness of networks during environmental changes. Thus, control of transcript turnover can, in principle, provide an essential mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression.

In all three domains of life – eubacteria, archaea and eukaryotes – the machinery of RNA degradation often takes the form of multicomponent assemblies, and these complexes, or their individual components, can target specific gene products or affect the relative composition of different transcripts through differential decay rates [2]. From the perspective of regulatory control networks, RNA degradative machines effectively function as trans-acting regulators of gene expression, similar to the classical transcription factors that control rates of mRNA synthesis, except that RNA degradative machines affect rates of degradation.

In the well-studied eubacterium *Escherichia coli*, a multi-enzyme complex known as the ‘RNA degradosome’ can drive the energy-dependent turnover of mRNA and can trim some RNA species into their active forms [2]. Transcript analyses indicate that the degradosome has a broad role in gene regulation [3,4], and mutants in which degradosome assembly is disrupted have a slow-growth phenotype [5] and altered metabolic profiles (Vidya Chandran, PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, 2006). Although disruption of the degradosome affects the levels of many transcripts, some are affected strongly, suggesting that these transcripts might contain a structural or sequence signal for recognition. Many of these transcripts encode enzymes of glycolysis and other processes of cellular energetics [3].

Surprisingly, the *E. coli* RNA degradosome is built on a region of RNase E that shows high sequence variation among closely related bacteria. Also somewhat surprisingly, the available evidence indicates that other degradosome-like assemblies show apparently wide compositional variation across the phyla. These observations seem paradoxical, given the role of the degradosome in the regulatory repertoire of *E. coli*. Here we explore the organization of the *E. coli* degradosome, its putative phylogenetic variation and the hypothesis that it might represent a special case of molecular evolution, and thereby discuss the wider implications.

Composition of the *E. coli* RNA degradosome

The *E. coli* degradosome comprises the following principal enzymes: the essential endoribonuclease RNase E, which initiates the turnover of many, if not most, mRNA

molecules; the ATP-dependent RNA helicase RhlB, which unwinds and translocates RNA substrates; the glycolytic enzyme enolase; and the phosphorolytic exoribonuclease PN Pase [2, 6–8] (Figure 1a). The physical association of the nucleases and the helicase in the degradosome facilitates the coordination and cooperation of their individual activities.

In addition to its degradative role, RNase E can selectively process, rather than destroy, some RNA species by cleaving larger precursors [9–15], and the organization of the degradosome might help to affect the decision between these destructive and processive modes. RNase E can cleave defined transcripts in conjunction with small regulatory RNAs that have sequence complementarity to the target, and this function could also be facilitated by degradosome organization [16–18]. The role of enolase in the degradosome is not clear, although evidence indicates that enolase and RNase E affect the response to stress caused by overabundant phosphosugar [17].

The four components of the *E. coli* degradosome associate principally through interactions mediated by RNase E, which can be dissected into discrete functional and structural domains. The N-terminal half of *E. coli* RNase E, which in length and sequence closely resembles its paralogue RNase G, encompasses the catalytic domain

[12,19,20] (Figure 1a, types A and E, respectively). Whereas this half of RNase E has a compact fold and is well conserved among bacteria and even some plants, the C-terminal half is largely unstructured and varies greatly [21–23] (e.g. Figure 1a, types B–D). It is this C-terminal portion that organizes the *E. coli* RNA degradosome complex [2,6–8,23] (Figure 1b).

The degradosome is, in effect, a conglomerate of ancient conserved enzymes that are colocalized through a variable domain. It might also be a highly dynamic, heterogeneous assembly that can change with environmental conditions or through the transient recruitment of various components [24–26]. One such transient partner might be the Hfq protein, a homohexameric chaperone of small regulatory RNA that assists targeted transcript attack [17]. Similarly, a cold-shock helicase is recruited to the degradosome during adjustment to lower temperature [25,26].

Component structures and a subassembly of the degradosome

Recently, the crystal structure of the N-terminal half of *E. coli* RNase E (amino acids 1–529), which encompasses the catalytic function, has been solved [27]. The structure reveals a homotetramer in which the quaternary

Figure 1. RNase E, the *E. coli* RNA degradosome and putative bacterial degradosomes. (a) Primary structure of RNase E (type A) and its shorter paralogue RNase G (type E). The C-terminal half of *E. coli* RNase E forms the scaffold for the degradosome and has binding regions for RNA, helicase, enolase and PN Pase (note that variable components such as the cold-shock helicase and the Hfq RNA chaperone, which recruits small regulatory RNA into a complex with RNase E [17], are not shown). RNase E homologues from other bacteria, which we classify as groups A–D according to the extra peptide segments attached to the RNase G-like catalytic core, are also indicated. (b) Summary of the protein-protein and protein-RNA recognition microdomains of *E. coli* RNase E. Near the recognition sites for helicase (Rhlb) and enolase (Eno) are two arginine-rich regions that might be independently involved in RNA binding: the RNA-binding domain (RBD) and arginine-rich region 2 (AR2). We define ‘microdomains’ as the short segments on the scaffold domain of RNase E that are required for protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction.

(a) (i) Structure of the homotetrameric catalytic N-terminal domain of *E. coli* RNase E. Two protomers are tan and two are beige. The RNA is shown in stick representation in grey. The Mg²⁺ and Zn²⁺ ions are shown as magenta and grey spheres, respectively. Right, subdomain structure of a protomer, including the RNase H-like fold, the S1 RNA recognition fold, a 5′-sensing domain, the catalytic DNase-I-like fold and a small domain that forms one of the dimer interfaces (see Ref. [27] for more details). (b) Crystal structure of *E. coli* enolase in complex with the recognition microdomain from RNase E. The enolase dimer is yellow and the RNase E peptide is brown. Mg²⁺ ions in each active site are indicated by a red sphere. (c) Crystal structure of *Streptomyces antibioticus* PNase (left), which is homologous to the *E. coli* enzyme that is part of the RNA degradosome. As predicted by Symmons et al. [31], the *Sulfolobus* exosome core has a similar structure (right). Both PNase and the exosome core are viewed down the three-fold molecular axis and the two types of the corresponding subunits of each are dark and light blue. (d) Model of degradosome assembly based on crystallographic and biophysical data. To satisfy all of the available binding sites, a ratio of four PNase trimers (blue) to three RNase E tetramers (brown and tan) is required. The enolase dimers are yellow and the helicase domains are pink (N-terminal domain) and cyan (C-terminal domain). The symmetry of the tetrameric RNase E and trimeric PNase can be matched if two PNase trimers stack together to generate a local twofold axis, such that pairs of RNase E tails (brown and tan) make equivalent contacts with each trimeric ring. A set of PNase trimers stack precisely in this manner in the crystal lattice of the *Streptomyces antibioticus* enzyme [30,31], and these rings associate in such a way that the RNA-binding surfaces are exposed and could engage RNA substrates. The pairwise interactions of the C-terminal tails, implicated from yeast two-hybrid experiments [6], are indicated by short connecting lines. The degradosome complex might in fact have ‘quasi-equivalent’ symmetry if the scaffolding tails do not bind all of the components simultaneously.

organization is a dimer of dimers [27,28] (Figure 2a). The structure also accounts for the conservation of key residues of the catalytic site, the hydrophobic core and the protomer–protomer interfaces, and delimits the boundaries of this globular portion of the molecule.

Outside this catalytic domain, the remainder of RNase E is unlikely to have a defined structure, as inferred by sequence analysis. This lack of structure has been corroborated by biophysical studies of the isolated C-terminal domain from *E. coli* RNase E that reveal that this domain is intrinsically unstructured and even extended with little tendency to compact [23]. The domain is punctuated, however, by short segments of 15–40 residues that are comparatively better conserved and

are predicted to have a propensity to fold on recognition [23]. These segments are contained in larger regions that have been identified as protein–protein interaction sites by yeast two-hybrid analysis [6]. One of the regions has been shown to mediate interactions with enolase, a second region recognizes PNase, a third is implicated in RNA binding, and a fourth might be involved in self-association [23]. We refer to these small recognition segments that organize the degradosome as ‘microdomains’.

The recognition of the helicase RhlB is also mediated by a microdomain, although this region has a much weaker predicted structural propensity than has the other recognition sites. A 64-residue recognition site has been mapped by limited protease footprinting (Vidya

Chandran, PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, 2006) and is consistent with recent mutagenesis studies [26]. This region is conserved among the γ-proteobacteria. According to mass spectrometry, one helicase molecule binds one RNase E [23]. Its interaction with RNase E activates the helicase to hydrolyse ATP in the presence of RNA [7,23].

The complex of *E. coli* enolase and its recognition microdomain from RNase E has been solved at 1.6 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography (Figure 2b). The homodimeric enolase engages a single RNase E peptide in a conserved canyon at the dimer interface [29]. This stoichiometry agrees with findings from solution studies [23]. Those studies also indicate that one PNPAse protomer binds to each RNase E protomer. Structural information is also available for a close homologue of the *E. coli* PNPAse from *Streptomyces antibioticus*, which shows that the protein is a homotrimer [30] (Figure 2c, left). Incidentally, it was noted earlier [31] that PNPAse is homologous to the core of the multi-enzyme exosome, an RNA processing assembly found in eukaryotes and archaea; this homology has been recently corroborated by crystal structures of the archaeal exosome core [32,33] (Figure 2c, right).

We can propose a model of the degradosome that integrates the crystallographic and biochemical data (Figure 2d). We suggest that intrinsically unstructured tails emanate from the tetrameric catalytic domain of RNase E, which can accommodate up to four enolase dimers and four helicase monomers. Because a PNPAse trimer can bind three RNase E scaffolding tails, accommodating all interaction sites would require a ratio of three RNase E tetramers to four PNPAse trimers. We can envisage that the scaffolding tails of RNase E cooperate to build the degradosome assembly and perhaps to form proximal surfaces for shared binding of RNA substrates. Including enolase and helicase, the degradosome would have a molecular mass in excess of 4.1 mega-daltons (which is greater than a ribosome) and would readily qualify as a supramolecular machine dedicated to RNA processing and turnover. It is not clear whether all of the components can be accommodated simultaneously [17,23]. Our prediction of the mass is not in agreement with earlier suggestions and awaits experimental validation.

Molecular diversity of RNase E and the radiation of degradosomes

In RNase E homologues that are similar to the *E. coli* enzyme, the segments corresponding to microdomains, including the two microdomains that are probably RNA-binding sites (RBD and AR2), are comparatively well conserved. These RNase E homologues (Figure 1a, type A) are colour-coded as the red branch in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). Organisms of this branch include Gram-negative species that are pathogens of animals and plants such as *Salmonella typhimurium*, *Yersinia pestis*, *Yersinia pseudotuberculosis*, *Shigella flexneri* and *Erwinia carotovora*. It is likely that, among members of the red branch, RNase E recruits enolase, PNPAse and helicase and interacts with RNA in a similar manner.

The red branch in the tree represents only a subset of the γ-proteobacteria and, on the basis of sequence analyses and data that identify protein partners of these enzymes, other members of this family are expected to form complexes that are similar to, but not identical with, the *E. coli* degradosome (Figure 1a, types B–D; Figure 3; summarized in Table 1). For example, the RNase E of the γ-proteobacterium *Pseudomonas syringae* forms an equilibrium complex with the 3′-to-5′ hydrolytic exoribonuclease RNase R [34] (Figure 1a, type B; Figure 3, green branch); the corresponding *E. coli* enzymes are not known to interact.

In the representative α-proteobacterium *Rhodobacter capsulatus*, RNase E forms an equilibrium complex with a DEAD-box helicase, the transcription termination factor Rho and other proteins [35] (Figure 1a, type C; Figure 3, closest homologues of *Rhodobacter sphaeroides* are colour-coded as the blue branch). Although the function of Rho in a complex with RNase E is unknown, the association of these two enzymes suggests that there is a link between transcription termination and mRNA degradation that could be involved in the quality control of mRNA.

The RNase E from the Gram-positive actinobacterium *Streptomyces coelicolor* is the longest member of the family with 1340 amino acids; it is, effectively, a circularly permuted version of the *E. coli* homologue, such that the sequence that interacts with PNPAse precedes rather than follows the catalytic core [36] (Figure 1a, type D; Figure 3, pink branch). A lengthy N-terminal extension is also seen in the RNase E from *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the causative agent of tuberculosis and its close relative *Mycobacterium bovis* [37]. Extensions also occur in RNase E from the higher plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* (not shown in the tree), but it is not yet clear whether these extensions recruit partners. From these examples, a picture emerges of the degradosome as an assembly that varies greatly in the course of evolution.

Synopsis and synthesis

The idea that the degradosome has an essential functional role seems at odds with the observed sequence variation outside the conserved catalytic core among RNase E homologues and the compositional variation of the putative RNase E-mediated assemblies among closely related proteobacterial species. However, the preservation of long open reading frames of the variable, noncatalytic portion of RNase E, which often encode >500 amino acids, suggests that there is significant selective pressure to maintain them. Supporting this notion is the finding that the *E. coli* degradosome is in fact functionally important in regulation. The explanation for this paradox of the lack of sequence conservation on the one hand, and the importance of function on the other might lie in the physical properties of the microdomains.

The regions that form the scaffold of the *E. coli* degradosome and the proposed degradosomes of other species are predicted to be intrinsically unstructured and are therefore expected to be comparatively free from the restrictions associated with folding into a stable native structure [38–43], which would account for the tremendous sequence divergence in these regions.

The species for which assemblies based on RNase E have been characterized are indicated by an asterisk and are illustrated by a cartoon. The colour coding of the different branches (green, red, blue and pink) groups species that are predicted to have degradosome-like assemblies similar to each of the cartoons. The characteristic microdomains are not as well conserved for the species labeled in black. The sequence of the Rhodobacter capsulatus RNase E is not available, and the blue branch indicates homologues of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The tree was generated with PHYLIP (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) using amino acid sequences with bootstrapping for 36 trials and a maximum-likelihood method, as implemented in the programme PROML.

sequence constraints on the microdomains mean that the consequences of mutations are exposed to natural selection without the structural and thermodynamic costs usually associated with mutations in globular domains [38]. Thus, the microdomains can evolve comparatively rapidly with the consequence that new partners might associate through microdomain recognition. The centrality of the degradosome in the gene regulation network of *E. coli* suggests that such novel associations will alter gene expression levels for specific proteins [3,44]. These changes will be beneficial to the organism if the altered expression pattern is

advantageous, which could be frequent given that changes in expression are a common mechanism of adaptive evolution [45,46].

We suggest that the architecture of the degradosome—a structurally conserved core surrounded by unstructured recognition domains—confers high evolvability on the degradosome: that is, an increased capacity to generate adaptive, heritable and phenotypic variation [47]. The putative molecular diversity of the degradosome (Figure 3) might in fact reflect an adaptive radiation as the degradosome became embedded in the genetic regulatory apparatus and metabolic organization of *E. coli* and its closest relatives. Although we argue that the architecture of the degradosome leads to its high evolvability, we are not suggesting that this property is itself a product of natural selection, but rather is a fortuitous consequence of its structural organization.

### Concluding remarks

Molecular recognition mediated by microdomains is not unique to the *E. coli* degradosome because other regulatory complexes, such as the signalling and transcription machinery, are also assembled through microdomains. These other regulatory assemblies are predicted to have molecular evolution characteristics similar to those proposed for the degradosome [48]. Examples in eukaryotes abound in the recognition complexes formed by transmembrane receptors involved in signalling systems and by nucleotide exchange factors of the small GTPases. These complexes are often weak, transient assemblies with a myriad of components. Typically, the interfaces of these complexes have less than half the area that is present in stable structures at equilibrium.

Transient assemblies are also involved in many aspects of transcription control—for example, the interactions of the intracellular receptors that recognize the small hydrophobic pattern found in cognate coactivator partners and the recognition of the flexible tails of the histone proteins in chromatin. In bacteria, the σ-factors that control polymerase activity have large segments that are intrinsically unstructured and enable modular domains to make protein–protein contacts at sites that are well separated physically. Like the degradosome, these other control systems might also represent machines with potential for rapid adaptive evolution and, as the case might be, towards the development of specific signalling pathways, or the transcriptional control of specific genes.
