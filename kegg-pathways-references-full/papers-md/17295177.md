**ABSTRACT**

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of death among cirrhotic patients and has become a major health problem in developed countries. There is an elemental understanding of the genes and signaling pathways involved in the initiation and progression of this neoplasm. The current hypothesis of the HCC cell origin includes both somatic cells (hepatocytes) and stem cells/progenitor cells. Unlike that in other malignancies such as breast, brain, or hematopoietic cancers, the implication of cancer stem cells in HCC pathogenesis is not yet supported by consistent data. Analysis of somatic genetic alterations and gene expression profiles in HCC samples has provided relevant information on the genes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, pinpointing a seminal molecular classification of the disease. Nonetheless, a comprehensive genomic analysis of HCC samples using high-resolution platforms in precisely annotated HCCs is clearly needed. Recent data have identified different signaling pathways in liver carcinogenesis (e.g., Wnt-βCatenin, Hedgehog, tyrosine kinase receptor–related pathways), providing an important potential source of novel molecular targets for new therapies. This review summarizes the most relevant information regarding structural and functional alterations in HCC and describes some of the key signaling pathways implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis.

**KEYWORDS:** Liver cancer, genomics, signaling pathway

The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has doubled in the United States and Europe in the past four decades, a dramatic trend that has generated increased attention in the medical and scientific communities and has been attributed to an increase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.¹,² Worldwide, it is reported to be the fifth most common cancer; moreover, its mortality is third among all cancers, behind only lung and colon cancer.³ Particularly striking is the incidence of HCC reported in younger age cohorts in the United States: as the incidence rates of HCC have increased in recent years, the distribution of patients with HCC has shifted toward relatively younger ages, with the greatest increases occurring between the ages of 45 and 60 years.² In western countries, less than 40% of patients are eligible for potential curative treatment at the time of presentation.⁴ Systemic therapies such as standard chemotherapeutic agents do not have significant efficacy in HCC, based on data from randomized trials.⁵ These reasons have spurred extensive research to clarify the genomics and signaling pathways implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis in the hope that a greater understanding of its molecular pathogenesis will reveal new strategies to tackle this devastating disease.⁶

Several major drawbacks limit the usefulness of studies regarding molecular pathogenesis in HCC. First,

most studies include patients with varying etiologies, which, to some extent, obscures the data, at least from a genomic point of view. Second, few studies analyze the genetic and genomic alterations that emerge at different time points during the entire progressive sequence of the disease. Finally, the limited size of the studies is often a factor that undermines the capability to provide consistent genomic data. Gene expression analyses of human HCCs have, however, led to a seminal molecular classification of HCCs on the basis of prognosis.⁷ Because HCC arises in 80% of cases from cirrhotic liver, methodical analysis of genetic expression among normal liver tissue, cirrhosis, dysplastic nodules, and cancer is relevant. The precise characterization of the sequential molecular events in these different stages may help distinguish early and pivotal mutations from collateral damage.

Emphasizing a translational perspective, this review focuses on the current knowledge of the cellular origin of HCC, the structural damage and genomic mutations in HCC, as well as the most relevant signaling pathways involved in this neoplasm. Ultimately, we aim to integrate our discussion of structural DNA damage and phenotypic outcome at the transcriptome and protein levels with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes.

to transform from their normal quiescent, closely regulated phenotype to a constitutively activated phenotype. There is now abundant evidence that CSCs are originated from the stem cell compartment in some cancers, such as those of the hematopoietic system, central nervous system, and breast.⁷ Alternatively, it has been speculated that mature somatic cells dedifferentiate into stem cell-like cells with the ability to self-renew¹³⁻¹⁷ (Fig. 1).

The normal liver harbors an extraordinary capacity for regeneration in response to acute stimuli, such as partial hepatectomy and toxic injury. Liver regeneration after hepatectomy is primarily due to proliferation of differentiated hepatocytes.¹⁸ Experimental studies have shown that hepatocytes have a relevant capacity to proliferate with more than 70 doublings potentially occurring throughout their life span. However, when the mature hepatocyte compartment is damaged as a result of chronic inflammation/necrosis or a combined insult of hepatectomy and toxic injury, a reserve cell compartment—progenitor cell compartment—is activated.¹⁹,²⁰ Liver progenitor cells reside in the most peripheral branches of the biliary tree, the ductules, and canals of Hering. Different cell types and signals are involved in this process, including stellate cells, immune cells, and growth factors.²¹⁻²⁵ The speculation that a subpopulation of liver progenitor cells may have a hematopoietic origin²⁶ has not been supported by recent investigations.²⁷

It is tempting to draw parallels between the intercellular signaling taking place during the liver's response to injury between mesenchymal and epithelial cells and the concept of the stem cell niche, in which support cells surrounding the stem cells regulate their growth and differentiation.²⁸ Notably, small cell dysplastic lesions, which are defined as preneoplastic precursors, have been described as showing characteristics of progenitor cells.²⁹ In addition, a small proportion of tumors present a mixed hepatocellular carcinoma phenotype,²⁹ whereas some early HCCs show proliferating oval cells in the center of the lesions, indicating the presence of stem cell growth.⁸ Nevertheless, cancer stem cell involvement in hepatocarcinogenesis might be proved when specific markers are capable of recognizing such a lineage within the tumor boundaries, as is the case with interleukin-3a present in acute myelogenous leukemia stem cells or AC133 epitope in brain tumors.⁸ At present, human HCC markers for CSC (i.e., CD34)²² and comparison of gene expression profiles with rat fetal hepatoblast have provided controversial results.⁷

Disruption of pathways known to play roles in stem cell self-renewal such as Notch, Hedgehog, and Wnt-β/Catenin may be seminal events in oncogenesis within the liver. The crosstalk between these pathways and others classically associated with cancer (i.e., RAS/ MAPK, PI3K/Akt, etc.) may link the different steps in

CELLULAR ORIGIN OF HCC: FROM HEPATOCYTES TO STEM CELLS

The growing understanding of molecular cell biology and carcinogenesis has led to the clear concept that stem cells have a critical role in the development of some cancers (see review by Jordan et al⁸). The hallmark of stem cells is their capacity for self-renewal, the potential to proliferate extensively, and asymmetric cell division to multiple lineages.⁸⁻¹¹ In this process, stem cells yield two daughter cells that are different: the first, a stem cell, and the second, a committed progenitor cell that is capable of proliferating only into differentiated progeny.¹⁰ Advances in stem cell biology have reintroduced the controversial question of whether stem cells indeed are the originators of cancer.¹² Classical models of oncogenesis speculate that the additive acquisition of genetic events dysregulates master functions of the cell and creates the malignant phenotype, including features of antiapoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion. The cancer stem cell (CSC) model proposes that cancers are constituted of two different cell populations: malignant stem cells with capacity for asymmetric division, primarily responsible for tumorigenesis and dissemination, and a second larger population of partially differentiated cancer cells derived from CSC.¹² Several lines of evidence suggest that it is possible that CSCs arise by either mutation from normal stem cells or mutation of progenitor cells. These acquired mutations allow stem cells

Figure 1 Cancer stem cell model. This hypothesis describes the seminal role of cancer stem cells in the perpetuation of cancer. Although the exact source of cancer stem cells remains unclear, several reports suggest a possible origin in either normal stem cells or differentiated cells. These precursors may lead to different events, including genetic structural damage, horizontal gene transfer, cell fusion, and transdifferentiation, which give rise to the line of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Self-renewal is a defining attribute of CSCs and, hence, their progeny can either retain the capacity for self-renewal or evolve into a partially differentiated malignant phenotype.

cellular differentiation and intercellular communication. Therefore, the success in cancer treatment may ultimately rely on the pharmacological manipulation of these pathways.

SOMATIC GENETIC ALTERATIONS IN HCC

During the process of hepatocarcinogenesis, multiple genetic alterations are selected for their proliferative and survival advantages by tumor cells. Grossly, the evolution has been well documented and includes histopathological lesions that range from liver cirrhosis to low- and high-grade dysplastic nodules, then to cancer. During the preneoplastic stage, there is an up-regulation of mitogenic pathways leading to the selection of certain clones of dysplastic cells. These clones, organized as dysplastic nodules and surrounded by fibrous septa of connective tissue, may acquire a malignant phenotype after exposure to different genomic alterations. Multiple genetic alterations that activate oncogenes or disrupt tumor suppressor genes are thought to accompany the observed histological changes, yet the precise molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not fully understood. Notably, different combinations of genetic alterations are often observed among different individuals and sometimes even within different nodules arising in the same individual. Thus, an important goal would be to classify HCC instances into subgroups based on the observed spectrum of genetic alterations and to determine treatment modalities that are most effective for each subgroup.

Genetic alterations can range in scale from point mutations in individual genes to the gain or loss of chromosomal arms. Several candidate genes in hepatocarcinogenesis emerged from surveys of genetic alterations, including c-myc (8q), Cyclin A2 (4q), Cyclin D1 (11q), Rb1 (13q), AXIN1 (16p), p53 (17p), IGFR-II/M6PR (6q), p16 (9p), E-Cadherin (16q), SOCS (16p), and PTEN (10q). The most frequently mutated genes in HCC include p53, PIK3CA, and β-catenin, although mutation prevalence varies greatly depending on etiology. Chromosomal alterations in HCC have been surveyed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), which detects changes in relative DNA copy numbers between genomes by competitive hybridization. However, CGH cannot detect alterations less than 10 Mb or copy neutral loss of heterozygosity. These limitations have been overcome by technological innovations, such as array-based comparative genomic hybridization and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Both of these technologies provide a larger dynamic range for copy number measurements as well
as higher resolution to refine boundaries of amplifications and deletions. Despite these technical advantages, several recent array-based studies predominantly reported single copy gains and losses of entire chromosome arms rather than recurrent high-level amplifications or homozygous deletions smaller than 5 Mb. This result suggests that multiple genes residing on the same chromosome arm may be under simultaneous selection because of the synergistic proliferative advantages conferred by copy number alterations to these genes.

### Copy Number Alterations in HCC

Dozens of studies have investigated chromosomal alterations in HCC using CGH, as reviewed by Moinzadeh et al.³⁶ The most frequently affected chromosome arm is 1q, with rates of amplification ranging between 58% and 78% in HCC. Other chromosome arms commonly altered with amplifications include 6p, 8q, 17q, and 20q and with deletions include 4q, 8p, 13q, 16q, and 17p. The most extensive studies on CGH, including more than 40 patients each, are summarized in Table 1.³⁷⁻⁴⁸ The majority of the reports include patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease, and attempts to associate chromosomal alterations with the etiology of the underlying liver disease have been inconsistent. Two reports found no differences regarding serological status,³⁷,⁴⁶ whereas a Japanese study found significant association between gain of 11q and HBV etiology.³⁹

Recent bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array CGH studies, as well as one SNP array study, detected frequencies of chromosome gains and losses that were similar to those in traditional CGH studies.⁴⁴,⁴⁹⁻⁵¹ A common strategy for narrowing the list of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors is the delineation of minimally affected regions on these chromosome arms, which are often biased by one or two samples with the smallest regions of gain or loss. These analyses assume that the most frequently altered chromosomal locus is most likely to harbor genes that contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. Steinemann et al used an array with 6251 BACs to map minimal affected regions of less than 5Mb on chromosomes 1q, 4q, 5q, and 20q.⁵¹ Notably, the minimal affected region of gain at 1q22–1q23.1 was distinct from the region at 1q25 reported by Katoh et al, bolstering the notion that multiple genes from the same chromosome arm may be under selection.⁴⁹

High-level amplifications and homozygous deletions can also indicate regions in individual tumors under genetic selection, yet these events are rarely observed in HCC. Recurrent high-level amplification at 11q13 was reported in three studies at a combined frequency of 5%.⁴⁴,⁴⁹,⁵⁰ This evolutionarily conserved locus contains several genes in the Wnt and MAPK pathways, including cyclin D1, FGF19, FGF4, FGF3, and LRP5. Several other high-level amplifications have been reported in individual tumors, yet none of them have been replicated in multiple studies. Similarly, no recurrent homozygous deletions have been reported to date.

Although these strategies have improved the mapping of common lesions compared with CGH studies, even the smallest lesions often include dozens of candidate genes. One method to filter these gene lists is to evaluate the correlation between copy number alterations and gene expression levels across tumors with both data sets available. Genes in regions of chromosomal gain with increased expression levels are more likely to represent oncogenes, whereas genes in regions of chromosome loss with decreased expression probably indicate tumor suppressor genes. Patil et al pioneered this approach by assessing the correlation between 48 highly expressed genes on chromosome 8q and their copy numbers across 49 HCC samples.⁴⁴ One gene with a high positive correlation was COPS5/JAB1/CSN5, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome that regulates E3 ubiquitin ligases. Strikingly, increased copy number of this gene was positively correlated with a wound signature gene expression pattern in 37 breast tumors.⁵² Overexpression of COPS5 increased proliferation in both Hep3B cells and MCF10A cells, and siRNA knockdown against this gene decreased the growth rate of Hep3B cells. Both of these studies support the role for COPS5 as an oncogene activated by 8q gain.

The potential predictive power of genetic alterations regarding other clinical parameters such as prognosis, recurrence after surgery, and tumor stage remains unclear. In a meta-analysis including 785 patients,³⁶ there was a significant correlation between several high-frequency genomic imbalances and tumor grade (loss of 4q and 13q) as well as HBV infection (loss of 4q, 8p, 13q, and 16q). Similarly, additional studies reported significant associations with stage (gain of 1q, 3q, and 7q⁴⁵), tumor size (loss of 8p and gain of 8q³⁷), and vascular invasion (gain of 1q, 6q, 17q and loss of 11q⁴³). However, two recently published studies, including 41 and 44 patients, respectively, failed to show any correlation between CGH data and clinicopathological features.³⁸,⁴⁴ This discrepancy may arise from the multifactorial and heterogeneous contributions of genetic alterations to clinicopathological features. To complicate matters further, one report found a significantly higher number of chromosomal aberrations in patients from Shanghai compared with patients from Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States,⁴⁸ so the importance of an environmental influence in chromosome aberrations may have been underestimated. Raidl et al performed a systematic analysis of chromosomal imbalances in the entire hepatocarcinogenic process in 40 patients, studying tissue from cirrhotic liver, dysplastic nodules, and HCC. They demonstrated a stepwise increase in genetic aberrations

In summary, gains and losses of large chromosomal regions are the most prevalent genetic alterations observed in HCC, and high-level amplification of 11q13 is observed at ~5% frequency. Dosage changes for multiple genes on each recurrently altered chromosome arm are likely to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Although the roles of several candidate genes have been experimentally confirmed, further analyses that integrate copy number alterations with gene expression changes in the same tumors have the potential to discover new oncogenes and tumor suppressors.

Allelic Imbalances in HCC

Chromosomal regions with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) may harbor tumor suppressor genes that could be disabled by subsequent mutation. Assays for LOH require molecular markers—such as microsatellites or SNPs—that can distinguish between parental chromosomes. Microsatellites are short tandem repeated sequences (less than 10bp) spread throughout the entire genome. Impairment in mismatch repair systems causes alterations that may modify microsatellite sequences. This forms the rationale for the use of microsatellite marker analysis (MSA) in these studies, and in a fashion similar to CGH, they can reveal potential tumor suppressor genes. Unlike CGH, MSA cannot detect amplifications and, therefore, this technique is not suitable for investigation of the

occurrence of proto-oncogene activation. Another drawback of MSA is that because microsatellite analysis is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based, its high sensitivity can detect alterations arising from noncancer cells existing within the tumor, such as endothelial, inflammatory, Kupffer, and stellate cells.⁵⁴ This theoretical cellular selection bias can be overcome by laser capture microdissection or by cell sorting using flow cytometry.

Defective mismatch repair is a well-recognized event in some malignancies.⁵⁵⁻⁵⁸ In HCC, allelic loss at one or more of the 18 loci analyzed in 34 HCC samples was found in 70% of HCCs as opposed to 3% in nontumorous livers.⁵⁷ A larger study of 120 HCC samples, performed with 195 markers on 39 autosomal arms, encountered LOH at 1p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, 16q, and 17p, with prevalent LOH at 1p in small, well-differentiated tumors, whereas LOH at 16p and 17q occurred more frequently in metastatic lesions.⁵⁹ Another investigation narrowed the detecting threshold of CGH and MSA by using genome-wide minimal deleted region analysis on 48 HCC patients to assist in the cloning of candidate genes.⁶⁰ Among the 33 minimal deleted regions described, the authors found an inverse association between the loss of MDR15q1 (15q21.1-q22.2) and 2-year survival. A report comparing both techniques (CGH and alleletype by PCR-LOH) concluded that they were equivalent in their ability to detect chromosome aberrations with a concordance up to 89%, although CGH appeared to be a slightly more precise method.⁶¹

### Mutational Analysis in HCC

The screening for chromosomal aberrations and allelic imbalances revealed several loci altered in HCC. Data regarding gene location, in conjunction with data describing gene function, are the basis of an integrative genomic analysis. Closer scrutiny of the structural genetic damage in HCC relies on the mutational status of the different potential tumor suppressor and oncogenes, as revealed by the genome-wide approaches described previously. An example of this approach reported by Laurent-Puig et al defined two major hepatocarcinogenic pathways by genetic alterations combining allelic imbalance (using 335 microsatellite markers) and point mutations.⁶² The authors found significant associations regarding several clinical parameters, including prognosis, tumor size, degree of differentiation, and HBV serologic status.

Although there is evidence of germline mutations in some genes (e.g., p16INK4⁶³) that raises the possibility for a familial predisposition to HCC, most of the mutations described in HCC are somatic. We will briefly discuss *p53*, the somatic mutation most extensively studied in the past several decades. Mutations of β-catenin, PTEN, PIK3CA, and EGFR are discussed later in this review in the context of their respective signaling pathways.

*p53* is probably the gene most studied in modern oncology.⁶⁴ It is a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis, and differentiation, and its role in carcinogenesis is unquestionable. For this reason, several strategies have been attempted to restore *p53* function for therapeutic reasons.⁶⁵ In HCC, more than 30 studies (Table 2) have analyzed mutations of *p53*.⁶²,⁶⁶⁻⁹⁹ Overall, the rate of mutation ranges from 0% (in 129 HCC samples from Spain⁶⁷) to 67% (in 15 HCC samples from Senegal⁷¹). Indeed, there is a remarkable differential mutation rate according to geographic area: higher rates of mutation have been documented in West Africa and Southeast Asia and lower rates in western countries. One study showed differences within a single province in China related to the level of aflatoxin exposure (56% versus 8%).⁹⁴ Similar results were reported after sequencing 107 geographically and ethnically diverse HCC samples (25% versus 12% in high- and low-aflatoxin exposure regions, respectively).⁶⁹ *p53* G-to-T mutation at the third position of codon 249 is the target spot for aflatoxin B exposure.¹⁰⁰ In western countries where aflatoxin is not endemic, high mutation rates of *p53* are seen only in patients with hemochromatosis-related HCC.⁹⁸

Regarding *p53* mutations and the clinicopathological features of HCC, Tanaka et al found differential rates of *p53* mutations according to the histological degree of the lesions (0% [0/8] versus 60% [3/5] in Edmondson grade I and IV tumors, respectively),⁹⁶ suggesting a prognostic value of mutational status. Another report described differential *p53* mutational rates in early and advanced tumors (0% [0/21] versus 36% [8/22]).⁸⁵ Likewise, Hayashi et al found an association between *p53* mutations and the degree of differentiation and survival outcomes in 90 patients with resected HCC.¹⁰¹ Findings from an European cohort of 42 patients agreed with these studies and also showed significant differences in median survival after surgery when patients were clustered according to *p53* mutations (43 versus 12 month survival in wild-type and mutated *p53*, respectively).⁷⁷ A recent analysis of the cooperative interactions of germline *p53* mutation and telomere dysfunction using a telomerase reverse transcriptase gene knockout model concluded that in the setting of intact telomeres, *p53* mutation had no effect on hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas in the setting of telomere dysfunction, *p53* enabled advanced HCC disease.¹⁰² Thus, almost all data suggest that in the West loss of *p53* is a late event in hepatocarcinogenesis.

messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis (quantitative real-time PCR [qRT-PCR]) have revolutionized the approach to human malignancies. Its applications to liver diseases are extensively reviewed elsewhere.<sup>103</sup> Microarray expression technologies have allowed the simultaneous analysis of thousands of transcripts that cover nearly the entire genome.<sup>104</sup> Two pioneering microarray studies demonstrated widespread activation of growth factor receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and cell cycle proliferation in HCC.<sup>105,106</sup> Notably, the detection of lymphocyte-specific transcripts and endothelial cell markers underscores the involvement of tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. The application of clustering algorithms to the dysregulated genes permits the classification of samples on the basis of expression profiles.<sup>107</sup> These clusters, organized as gene signatures (“disease fingerprints”), can be used for diagnostic purposes as well as to assess response to treatment<sup>108</sup> and to predict survival<sup>109</sup> in several cancers. Hence, it is expected that microarray technologies will be progressively introduced into routine clinical management.

A priori, the information provided by microarrays is not restricted to expression profiles, so the large volume of expression data produced may uncover new candidate genes and may reveal relations between genes and signaling pathways. This potential has great relevance to drug discovery. Cancer is generally a polygenic disease and multiple hits are necessary for gene alterations in cancer. Because the number of transcripts far exceeds the number of protein-coding genes,<sup>110,111</sup> a high-throughput technique such as microarray becomes an extremely potent tool to characterize this cascade of events and to reveal new significant targets. Nevertheless, gene expression studies have some pitfalls. A critical review of seven microarray studies in cancer challenged the robustness of expression profiles as predictors of survival-related outcomes.<sup>112</sup> The rates of misclassification of patients were as high as 50% in five of the seven studies, which makes chance as predictive of survival as the expression profiles. Undeterred, the authors of the study encouraged further pursuit of the question, recommending redesign of the studies ensuring adequate power of the training set. Moreover, they cited noise in the data and limited reproducibility across platforms as additional faults that preclude drawing definitive conclusions.<sup>112</sup>

In HCC, few gene expression studies have been focused on the potential role of gene signatures in molecular classification and as predictors of recurrence and survival.<sup>113</sup> In a study conducted in 91 HCC samples, a 406-gene expression signature enabled discrimination of patients with significant differences in survival.<sup>109</sup> Transcripts related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, histone modification, and ubiquitination provided the most accurate discrimination between both survival populations. Subsequently, an additional subpopulation of apparent progenitor cell origin with poor prognosis was added to the former classification.<sup>114</sup> Another study reporting a 153-gene signature generated from data of 40 HCC patients was able to discriminate populations with different survival rates.<sup>115</sup> Similarly, two gene signatures have been proposed to predict recurrence in HCC (12-gene<sup>116</sup> versus a 20-gene signature<sup>117</sup>). Notably, no overlapping genes are common in these investigations, and training sets used are fairly small.

showed a modest correlation between genomic alterations and the corresponding transcriptional expression profiles in a series of 61 patients.³⁸ Experimental variability in microarray measurements as well as epigenetic modifications that dampen the transcription levels of large chromosomal regions may explain these differences.

qRT-PCR, although it is far more sensitive than microarray, lacks array's broad genome screening power because it is applicable to a comparatively small number of genes. Most of the candidate genes arising from structural analysis of DNA have been screened for dysregulation in HCC by qRT-PCR. These genes cover the entire spectrum of cell functions: proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis (Table 3).¹⁰⁵,¹⁰⁶,¹¹⁵,¹¹⁹–¹⁶⁰ The implications of these genes in the pathogenesis of HCC have been reviewed elsewhere. Several of these investigations showed that mRNA level might not reveal DNA aberrations but other molecular events. For instance, in studies analyzing PTEN status in HCC, a decrease in mRNA levels in 50% of the samples did not correlate with deletions/mutations involving only 4% of the cases, pinpointing epigenetic events as potential major players.¹⁶¹ On the other hand, mRNA levels are not a surrogate for protein function; mechanisms such as miRNA interference, mRNA stability, and post-translational changes justify this discordance and merit deeper investigation on individual genes. In terms of diagnostics, a study conducted in Mount Sinai investigating 55 genes using hydrolysis probe-based qRT-PCR found a three-gene set signature (GPC3, LYVE1, and survivin) able to distinguish dysplastic nodules from early HCC with a discriminative accuracy of 94%.¹⁶²

### SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN HCC:
#### INTEGRATING STRUCTURE AND GENOMIC DYSREGULATION

Even with the enormous amount of data gathered from structural damage studies and gene expression profiles in HCC, the stepwise process that leads normal cells to hepatocellular cancer remains unclear. An integrative analysis of this information in the functional context of cell biology is need. In effect, an understanding of the complexity of the signal transduction pathways as well as their relevance in normal and malignant cells will enable the identification of key regulators in cancer, with far-reaching implications in the potential development of molecular targeted therapies (Fig. 2). We discuss here a selection of the relevant signaling pathways in HCC (Fig. 3).

#### Differentiation and Embryonic Pathways:
##### Wnt-βcatenin and Hedgehog

The Wnt pathway, which normally functions in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis and which has a fundamental role in embryogenesis, has been implicated in tumorigenesis.¹⁶³ As with many of these signaling pathways, its proper functioning within the cell is so indispensable that it contains multiple failsafe mechanisms, and its components have been highly conserved throughout evolution.¹⁶³,¹⁶⁴ “Canonical Wnt pathway” is the term used to describe a cascade that involves translocation of β-catenin from the cell membrane into the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and in turn regulates specific target genes, including *c-myc*, *cyclin D*, and *survivin*.

In normal cells, β-catenin associates with E-cadherin at adherens junctions of the cell membrane, linking E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton.¹⁶⁵ The signaling cascade is normally initiated extracellularly, when enough Wnt ligands accumulate to outnumber the secreted Wnt antagonists, stimulating relay of the message via transmembrane receptor Frizzled (FZD). FZD signals to β-catenin to escape its association with E-cadherin.¹⁶⁶,¹⁶⁷ In addition, certain cytoplasmic elements of the Wnt pathway, once activated via FZD, prevent β-catenin from being phosphorylated by a degradation complex made up of a serine-threonine kinase (GSK3B) and a protein scaffold (AXIN and APC).

Normally, when the Wnt pathway is not activated, cytoplasmic β-catenin is marked for degradation by proteosomes with this phosphorylation step and a subsequent ubiquitination. However, mutations in these proteins can allow β-catenin to escape into the nucleus and to promote transcription of its target genes in a constitutive manner. Nuclear localization of β-catenin is considered a harbinger of its oncogenicity. Most of the mutations in the Wnt pathway leading to cancer either inactivate the function of APC or stabilize β-catenin by altering its binding site to the protein scaffold, thus allowing it to escape degradation.

The Wnt pathway has been studied extensively in colon cancer, in which 90% of tumors contain a mutation of the APC gene.¹⁶⁸ Mutations in the β-catenin gene have been detected in almost 50% of colorectal cancers without APC mutations.¹⁶⁹ In HCC, mutations of APC are rare.¹⁴⁹,¹⁷⁰–¹⁷² There is general agreement, however, that Wnt signaling is up-regulated in a subset of HCCs, as evidenced by studies at the DNA, mRNA, and protein level. More than 10 studies have demonstrated mutations in β-catenin⁶²,⁷⁴,¹²²,¹⁴⁹,¹⁷⁰,¹⁷²–¹⁸⁰ (Table 2), and others have also found an association with its nuclear sequestration based on immunohistochemistry. Even recent reports suggest that preneoplastic adenomas with β-catenin activation have a higher risk of malignant transformation than their counterparts. The mutation rate of β-catenin ranges from 0% to 44%.⁷⁴,¹⁷⁴ Mutations of β-catenin described in HCC are located in exon 3 of the *CTNNB1* gene, the phosphorylation site for GSK3B.¹⁸¹

Desert Hedgehog, although the former is the predominant isoform in the liver.¹⁸⁸ In the absence of ligand activation, the receptor Patched (Ptc) exerts an inhibitory effect on Smoothened (Smo), a transmembrane homolog of G-couple receptors that in combination with Cos-2 impairs nuclear translocation of Gli. Similarly to β-catenin, after ligand stimuli, Gli accumulates inside the nucleus and induces transcription of genes related to cell cycle and growth.

The role of Hedgehog signaling in cancer is well established. There is a “human” model of constitutive Hedgehog activation related to germline mutations in Ptc. These patients, who suffer from Gorlin’s syndrome, have an increased incidence of malignancies in various organs (e.g., skin, brain).¹⁸⁸ Furthermore, Hedgehog contributes to the development of some solid sporadic tumors (pancreas, lung, prostate, and medulloblastoma).¹⁸⁹–¹⁹⁴ Recent studies have identified a possible role of this pathway in HCC: one study documents expression of Sonic Hedgehog in 60% of 115 human HCC samples with down-regulation of Gli-related target genes after specific blockade of the pathway.¹⁹⁵ Moreover, tumorigenic activation of Smo can mediate c-myc overexpression, which plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis.¹⁹⁶ All these encouraging data suggest that Hedgehog signaling may become a relevant molecular-based target in HCC treatment.¹⁹⁷

## Tyrosine Kinase Receptor (TKR)-Dependent Pathways

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of a family of four related receptors (Her2/Neu, ErbB3, and ErbB4) that upon ligand binding trigger tyrosine kinase activity and consequently initiate signal transduction. EGFRs are transmembrane proteins involved in the regulation of a complex array of essential biological processes including cell proliferation and survival. There are eight known ligands able to activate EGFR: transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), epidermal growth factor (EGF), heparin-binding EGF, amphiregulin, betacellulin, epiregulin, epigen, and crypto.¹⁸³ The overexpression of EGFR in some malignancies was the rationale for the development of specific EGFR antagonists, some of which have already gained approval for use in clinical practice (i.e., erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer or cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer). Moreover, EGFR mutations were significantly correlated with response to some of these blockers,¹⁹⁸,¹⁹⁹ which reinforced the relevance of *pathway addiction*²⁰⁰ in molecular targeted therapies. Her2/neu is another receptor with capital importance in some malignancies. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against Her2/neu, has shown antineoplastic activity in Her2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer.²⁰¹,²⁰²

Mutations of genes transcribing other components of the Wnt pathway have been described, including AXIN1 and AXIN2⁶²,¹⁴⁹,¹⁷¹,¹⁷⁹,¹⁸² (Table 2) and several extracellular inhibitors of Wnt signaling.¹²²,¹⁴⁹,¹⁷⁷,¹⁸³ Wnt receptor FZD-7 was reportedly overexpressed in 90% of HCC tissue samples analyzed.¹⁸⁴ In addition, immunohistological studies have demonstrated abnormal cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in 17% to 40% of human HCCs.¹⁴⁴,¹⁵⁵,¹⁸⁵,¹⁸⁶ However, not all studies demonstrate a correlation between elevated nuclear β-catenin and expression of its transcriptional targets in HCC, suggesting that the expression of these target genes is also regulated by alternative signaling pathways.¹⁴⁴,¹⁸⁵,¹⁸⁶

Most of the preceding mutations are undetectable in allelotype analysis and therefore the β-catenin locus (3p) is not a usual chromosomal aberration reported in HCC.⁵⁴ Conversely, deletions in the AXIN1 locus (16p) have been reported in HCC.

Hedgehog signaling is also a signaling pathway fundamental to cell differentiation, regeneration, and stem cell biology and more specifically plays a leading role in the development and homeostasis of gut tissue.¹⁸⁷ The structure of the pathway resembles Wnt signaling. There are three potential ligands: Indian, Sonic, and

Figure 3 Signaling pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma. Downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) there are two major pathways. RAS/MAPK: In the presence of ligand, RAS initiates sequential activation (phosphorylation) of Raf, Mek, and Erk that induces modifications in the expression of genes stimulating proliferation. PI3k/Akt: Akt has two major sites of phosphorylation. One depends on phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP₃) and the second is activated through the recently described mTOR/Rictor/GβL complex.²⁴⁶ Akt interacts with several mediators (FOXO, BAD, FKHR, IKK, p21, Mdm2, etc.) and acts mainly as a survival molecule by avoidance of apoptosis. Downstream of Akt, the complex mTOR/Raptor/GβL can induce protein synthesis by two different mechanisms: 5′TOP-dependent (p70S6) and Cap-dependent (4EBP1). Wnt/β-Catenin: In the absence of ligand, β-catenin is degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome systems after phosphorylation by the APC/AXIN/GSK3β complex. Upon Wnt ligand stimulation, β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and translocates into the nucleus. Intracellular β-catenin leads to modifications in expression of numerous genes related to cell proliferation, cell cycling, apoptosis, and differentiation (Survivin, c-myc, Cyclin D1, etc.). Hedgehog: In the absence of Hh protein, Ptc inhibits Smo, which forms a complex with Cos and Fu and prevents nuclear translocation of Gli. In the presence of Hh ligand, the inhibitory effect of Ptc upon Smo is released. As a result, Gli reaches its intranuclear gene targets. Similarly to β-catenin, Gli plays a key role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and cell cycle. HIP acts as a tumor suppressor due to its inhibitory effect in the binding of Hh ligands to Ptc.

In HCC, data regarding EGFR dysregulation are scarce and inconsistent, ranging from 4%²⁰³ to 53%.¹³⁴ Moreover, Her2/neu overexpression²⁰⁴ and EGFR mutations are uncommon events in HCC,²⁰⁵,²⁰⁶ although 17p (locus of Her2/neu gene) gains have been reported. In HCC, erlotinib has shown activity in both preclinical and clinical studies. In vitro studies with HCC cell lines using erlotinib alone or in combination with chemotherapy showed a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. Moreover, there was an additive effect when erlotinib was combined with doxorubicin or docetaxel but not with cisplatin.²⁰⁷ Thereafter, the same group reported antiproliferative effects as well as some proapoptotic activity of cetuximab in HCC cell lines.²⁰⁸ Another report confirmed all these results in vivo using a model of experimental cirrhosis in rats, where another tyrosine kinase inhibitor (gefitinib) decreased the number of HCC nodules as compared with control rats.²⁰⁹ Philip et al have published clinical findings with erlotinib in 38 patients with advanced HCC²¹⁰: 47% of their subjects had been treated with at least one prior

systemic regimen; 39% had extrahepatic metastases. Although responses were infrequent, disease control rates were significant (59% combined response and stability); 6-month progression-free survival was seen in 32% of patients (12 of 38).

TGF-α is active in the initiation, promotion, and progression in experimental HCC and probably contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis by autocrine, paracrine, and “juxtacrine” mechanisms.²¹¹ In addition, TGF-α stimulates neoangiogenesis.²¹² TGF-α is elevated in serum and urine of patients with HCC but has also been detected in a membrane-bound state, from which it can activate EGF receptors on adjacent cells. TGF-α may promote neoangiogenesis, tumor cell survival, and proliferation indirectly through the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).²¹³ Inhibition of TGF-α by anti-EGF-receptor antibody reduces VEGF expression in epithelial tumor lines and results in diminished tumor growth and tumor-related angiogenesis after implantation in mice.²¹² There is overexpression of VEGFR in human HCC samples measured by immunohistochemistry and Northern hybridization,¹³⁹ and in fact blockade of this receptor has proved to be an effective target for HCC treatment in vitro.²¹⁴

The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family is composed of two ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II), two receptors (IGFR-I and IGFR-II/M6P), and six binding proteins (IGFBP1–6). IGF signaling has a major role in regulation of fetal development, proliferation, differentiation, cell growth, and apoptosis. Studies have shown paradoxical effects of IGFBP proteins under different conditions, suggesting that they might have divergent actions depending on the environmental conditions in which they are involved.²¹⁵ IGF-II can bind both IGFR-I and IGFR-II/M6P, but its affinity for IGFR-I is significantly lower than that of IGF-I. IGF-II gene expression is increased in multiple malignancies,²¹⁶ including HCC.²¹⁷ Nardone et al²¹⁸ reported that the pattern of IGF-II expression is different according to its splice variants. Variants active in the fetus are up-regulated in HCC compared with surrounding tissue, whereas the variant present in adults remains stable. In this study, alterations in IGF-II expression were more evident in certain samples, suggesting that members of the IGF family may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis in a subset of HCCs. Interestingly, IGFR-II has no tyrosine kinase activity, so that its action consists of binding and degrading IGF-II, and it is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene. These data are consistent with the frequent chromosomal detections described in the IGFR-II locus (6q).

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent molecule in hepatocyte regeneration after injury.¹²⁵ In this setting, it is secreted by stellate cells and exerts its actions by binding to c-MET receptor. Overexpressions of c-MET and HGF are common events in HCC.¹²¹,²¹⁹ Unfortunately, the correlations between their expression and clinical features are contradictory. Some reports show correlation with poor prognosis,²²⁰ whereas others fail to find such associations.¹²¹ Hence, the role of these molecules in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC needs further investigation.

### Cytosolic Elements of the Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Signaling Pathways

Downstream of the tyrosine kinase receptors, signal transduction can be transmitted by several different pathways, including Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and Jak/stat.²²¹ The activation of RAS initiates a phosphorylation cascade that culminates in the translocation of ERK into the nucleus and changes in gene expression. Mutations of RAS, a well-established event in some cancers (i.e., pancreatic cancer²²²), are uncommon in HCC except in patients with history of vinyl chloride exposure²²³–²²⁶ (see Table 2).

With regard to the PI3K/Akt pathway, Akt can be activated (phosphorylated) by two different stimuli, both of which converge on phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP₃): the first entails a ligand-mediated activation through a TKR, and the second involves abnormal stimulation by means of constitutive activation of PI3K or loss of PTEN function, which is the physiological inhibitor of PIP₃ synthesis (Fig. 3).

PTEN is a well-known tumor suppressor gene²²⁷ with documented mutations and somatic deletions in several cancers (ranging from 34%²²⁸ to 44%²²⁹). Loss of heterozygosity in 10q (location of PTEN) is frequently encountered in HCC,²³⁰ and several studies have analyzed the role of PTEN in HCC.¹⁵⁸,¹⁶¹,²³¹–²³³ The published frequency of PTEN mutation is fairly low in HCC in contrast to other malignancies and ranges from 0%²³³ to 11%.¹⁶¹ Nevertheless, two studies found that PTEN mRNA levels were significantly decreased in HCC in comparison with the surrounding cirrhotic tissue.¹⁶¹,²³² As with other cancers, epigenetic mechanisms may account for the inactivation of PTEN (methylation of CpG islands).²³⁴

PI3K exists as a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (p110α, p110β, or p110γ) and a shared regulatory subunit (p85α, p85β, or p55γ). PIK3CA encodes p110, and it is frequently mutated in human cancer: 32% in colorectal cancer (versus 2% in colon adenomas) and 25% in gastric cancer.²³⁵ The oncogenic capacity of these mutations is well established.²³⁶–²³⁸ In HCC, currently there are only two studies that investigated mutations in PIK3CA, with contradictory results. One report found mutations in 35% of 76 HCC samples,²³⁹ whereas the other encountered no mutations in 47 HCC samples.²⁴⁰ The role of Akt in HCC is still

uncertain; however, one study reported that the presence of phosphorylated Akt in resected HCCs from 135 patients conferred a 12-fold increased risk of early recurrence.²⁴¹

An important mediator of the PI3K-Akt pathway is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which acts as a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation, sensing nutritional status and allowing progression from G1 to S phase.²⁴² Under nutrition-depleted conditions, mTOR activity is down-regulated. In fact, mTOR inhibition provokes cellular responses indicating a physiological state of starvation.²⁴³ Sahin et al reported that the mTOR pathway is up-regulated in a proportion of HCCs,²⁴⁴ and another study demonstrated that its blockage with rapamycin inhibits growth in HCC cell lines.²⁴⁵ This molecule has special relevance in HCC because mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and analogues) are already approved as antirejection therapies in liver transplantation.

### CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES

Elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of HCC presents an intriguing challenge. To solve this puzzle, an organized reconstruction of the sequential molecular perturbations during hepatocarcinogenesis is required. Such an analysis needs to combine data from different levels, including genetic aberrations, expression alterations, and protein modifications in a comprehensive set of tissue samples. Too narrow a focus on individual approaches may obscure the broader perspective probably required to achieve the objective.

Signaling pathways are increasingly being clarified, underscoring their significant relevance to understanding HCC pathogenesis. Moreover, drug discovery requires a precise knowledge of how these pathways interact. Thus, an approach linking these pathways with cancer cell biology may be the key to integrating our knowledge of malignantly transformed systems and developing effective therapies for HCC.
