Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections play an important role in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC, however, has not been fully described. Evidence suggests that the HBV X protein (HBx) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HCC. The high occurrence of anti-HBx antibody in the serum of HCC patients indicates that it could be a prognostic marker of HBV infection and HCC. HBx stimulates and influences signal transduction pathways within cells. HBx also binds to such protein targets as p53, proteasome subunits, and UV-damaged DNA binding proteins. It also interacts with the cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein, ATF-2, NFκB, and basal transcription factors. HBx is primarily localized to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with and stimulates protein kinases, including protein kinase C, Janus kinase/STAT, IKK, PI-3-K, stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase, and protein kinase B/Akt. It is also found in the mitochondrion, where it influences the Bcl-2 family. This review examines the role of HBx in the life cycle of HBV as well as the various signal transduction pathways involved in the pathogenesis of HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.

HBV infection plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and HCC. ${}^{1,2}$ HBV-related HCC is among the top 10 most common cancers in the world. More than 400 million people worldwide are infected with chronic HBV. Although the pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC has not been fully described, evidence suggests that HBx plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HCC. ${}^{3,4}$

**HBV X GENE AND HBX PROTEIN**

The HBV genome is circular with partly double-stranded DNA (Fig 1). ${}^{5,6}$ The long (minus) strand is approximately 3200 bases in length and contains four ORFs named S, C, P, and X. ${}^{7}$ The smallest ORF is the X gene that codes HBx, a 154 amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 17 kDa. X gene deletion from the HBV genome results in silent viral infections in which patients test negative for such antigenic markers as hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg), and hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg). ${}^{8,9}$ HBx has been implicated in many aspects of liver disease (eg, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and HCC), but its role in the development of chronic HBV infection, although central, is yet undefined.

The clinical relevance of HBx begins with the integration of HBV DNA into the genome of hepatocytes of chronic HBV carriers. Although thought to involve illegitimate recombination, integration is not required for HBV replication, and it typically results in the rearrangement of HBV sequences. ${}^{3}$ The X gene is usually conserved in the integrants, and HBx is often found in malignant hepatocytes of chronic HBV carriers. Additionally, HBx transcripts seem to accumulate in hepatocytes; and HBx induction, in hepatocytes, seems to alter the expression of many genes involved in signal transduction pathways, cell cycle control, metastasis, transcriptional regulation, immune response, and metabolism. ${}^{10}$ These initial cellular targets of HBx provide a starting point in mapping out the HBx mechanism of action in the progressive development of HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis.

HBxAg in sera and liver tissues and anti-HBx antibody in sera. A clinical study by Hwang et al demonstrated that 40.0% of sera and 85% of liver tissues from HCC patients tested positive for HBxAg. ${}^{11}$ In addition, 70.0% of sera from HCC patients tested positive for anti-HBx antibody. ${}^{11}$ In our study, we found that HBxAg was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of cells found in liver tumor tissues (76.5%) and cirrhosis tissues (100%). ${}^{12}$ The expression of anti-HBx antibody in sera correlated well with markers of HBV replication, such as HBsAg and HBcAg proteins. ${}^{13}$ Taken together, these data suggest that anti-HBx antibody in serum can

**Fig 1. Structure of HBV genome.** The genome of HBV is a double-stranded circular DNA (3.2 kb), which contains four ORF coding for polymerase (P), surface antigens (PreS1, PreS2, and S), precore (preC), core (C), and X.

potentially be used as a prognostic marker of HBV infection and HCC.

Although present in sera and liver tissue, the mechanism of action of HBx, during the course of an infection, remains unresolved. Although *in vitro* studies suggest that it activates the transcription of such host genes as c-Myc and viral genes, ${}^{14,15}$ it is clear that the HBx-defective virus cannot initiate infection *in vivo*. ${}^{16,17}$ In all likelihood, however, HBx is not a DNA binding protein, but HBx induces transcription of both host and viral genes indirectly.

**Transformations caused by HBx.** Studies of HBx transgenic mice have also investigated the hepatocarcinogenic effect of HBx. On the one hand, expression of the HBx gene can disrupt normal cell growth in transgenic mice. Studies suggest that HBx transgenic mouse cells had characteristics of malignant transformation. ${}^{18,19}$ On the other hand, not all HBx transgenic mice developed HCC. In addition, HBx is not essential for HBV replication or its maturation in transgenic mice, but it can enhance viral replication, apparently, by activating viral gene expression. ${}^{20}$ These studies indicate that HBx may at least function as a cofactor of hepatocarcinogenesis *in vivo*.

**HBX AND REGULATION OF APOPTOSIS**

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is necessary for the elimination of redundant, damaged, and virally infected cells. In general, proteins regulate apoptosis in three ways: as effectors and initiators of apoptosis, as inducers and suppressors of apoptosis, and as intermediate proteins. ${}^{21-23}$ HBx affects the regulation of apo-

ptosis through its action on caspases, mitochondria, and survivin. 24,25

**HBx and caspases.** 21–25 Apoptosis induced by ectopic expression of HBx is associated with mitochondrial membrane alterations and caspase 3 activation. 24 HBx has been demonstrated to efficiently block caspase 3 (CPP32) activity and apoptosis in both rat fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. 25 Caspase-3 is essential for the cleavage of the plasma membrane Ca²⁺ ATPase, and large rises in Caspase-3 can be detected in the cytoplasmic rim beneath the plasma membrane during apoptosis. Overexpression of HBx enhances agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca²⁺ signals in HepG2 and HeLa cells without affecting either the steady state of endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ concentration or the kinetics of Ca²⁺ release. HBx perturbs intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis by acting on caspase-3-dependent extrusion mechanisms. This effect is an important factor in the control of HBx-related apoptosis. 26

**HBx and mitochondria.** HBx has been demonstrated to localize to the mitochondria. *In vivo* studies also suggest it plays a role in apoptosis, possibly by interacting with Bcl-2 during hepatic apoptosis. It has been reported that the proapoptotic activity of HBx overcomes or bypasses the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 against Fas cytotoxicity. 27 It also has been suggested that in HBV-infected cells, the location of HBx in mitochondria can cause the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, subsequently inducing mitochondria-dependent cell death.

**HBx and survivin.** Studies in our laboratory suggest that HBx can upregulate the expression of survivin in hepatic carcinoma cells, inhibiting apoptosis of hepatic carcinoma cells induced by adriamycin. 28 Survivin is a protein that inhibits apoptosis and is overexpressed in most human cancers. 29 It can form complexes with hepatitis B x-interacting protein (HBXIP), originally recognized for its association with HBx. Survivin–HBXIP complexes bind pro-caspase-9 preventing its action on Apaf-1 and consequently suppressing apoptosis initiated via the mitochondria/cytochrome c pathway. However, the binding of the complex is essential for this function as neither survivin nor HBXIP demonstrates this function individually. Viral HBx has also been shown to interact with the survivin–HBXIP complex, suppressing caspase activation in a survivin-dependent manner. 30 The data suggest to us that HBXIP functions as a cofactor for survivin in the cellular apoptosis machinery. It may also function as a bridge between the cellular apoptosis machinery and the HBV virus involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

**Effects of HBx on signal pathways.** Intracellular localization studies have demonstrated that HBx is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. 31,32 It can influence transcriptional activators and activate many cellular and viral transcriptional elements. 33–38 For example, HBx upregulates the transcriptional activity of proto-oncogenes (c-Myc, N-myc, and c-jun) and transcription factors such as activating protein-1 (AP-1), NFκB, and ATF/CREB. 14,39,40 HBx has also been found to be associated with many genes, such as TNF, TGF-β1, EGF receptor, IL-8, and p53, among others. 41 It has also been demonstrated that HBx can interact with the nucleotide excision DNA repair pathway. 42 Recent studies suggest that HBx expression in HepG2 cells regulated the expression of 39 genes, 43 including cell cycle regulatory genes, oncogenes, and apoptosis effectors.

HBx upregulates the RAS-RAF-MAPK signal cascade. HBx has been shown to upregulate the MAPK signal cascade. 44–48 HBx-mediated RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway activation is also associated with accelerating entry of cells into S phase, 49 detrimentally affecting the cell cycle. As well, RAS-RAF-MAPK activation is causally associated with transformation. Importantly, data suggest that CREB is the downstream target of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway, as studies have demonstrated that CREB phosphorylation, *in vivo*, is mediated by HBx-dependent activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway. In other cell lines, RAS-RAF-MAPK was also mediated by an HBx-dependent activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. HBx-dependent activation of p38 MAPK inactivates Cdc25C by phosphorylation of Ser216, and it then initiates activation of the G₂/M checkpoint, which may delay cell growth. The RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway can only be stimulated by cytoplasmic HBx once it is targeted to the nucleus. 50 HBx activates both the p38 MAPK and the JNK pathways in HBx-mediated apoptosis. This mechanism of apoptosis occurs *in vivo* in response to weak apoptotic signals. 51

HBx also can induce centrosome hyperamplification and mitotic aberration through its interaction with Ras-extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (MEK)-MAPK. Intervention of this signaling pathway may suppress centrosome amplification as well as result in mitotic aberration. 52 Interestingly, it also has been shown that HBx upregulates Src kinase, which is subsequently tyrosine phosphorylated to activate Ras. Src tyrosine kinase activation not only changes the expression of Ras *in vivo*, but it can also influence HBV replication by stimulating the activity of viral polymerase. 53,54

HBx affects the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K) and its downstream target, protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, are induced by many factors, such as TGF-β, to inhibit apoptosis. HBx downregulates TGF-β-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes by stimulating PI-3-K activity. 55 Studies suggest that in stable clone cells that express HBx, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the regulatory sub-

unit p85 of PI-3-K and PI-3-K activity are both increased and phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 is also increased. The activation of PI-3-K signaling pathway is attributed, at least in part, to the anti-apoptotic mechanism of HBx. 56 It has also been demonstrated that HBx activates other signaling pathways, such as the Src kinase-Ras-GTP complex 57 and the Jak1-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT4) 4 that activate the PI-3-K-Akt/PKB pathway indirectly. Taken together, these data indicate that the HBV inhibits apoptotic death through an HBx-PI-3-K-Akt-Bad-dependent pathway.

HBx activates JAK/STAT pathway. As mentioned, it has been demonstrated that in HBx stable expressing cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of various STATs, such as STAT3 and STAT5, is upregulated by HBx. Furthermore, HBx specifically upregulates the level of tyrosine phosphorylation and *in vitro* kinase activity of Jak1, but not Jak2 or Tyk2, through protein to protein interaction with Jak1. These results suggest that HBx is an inducer of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway. 58 Additional studies reveal that some HBx mutants that differ in their association to the wild-type HBx lose the ability to activate STAT-3 and NFκB. In HepG2 cells transfected with the wild-type HBx expression vector, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 was activated by HBx. 59 Stimulation of growth factors, during partial hepatectomy, results in the activation of JAK/STAT signaling in the liver and has been associated with increased hepatocyte proliferation. 60,61 Because of its ability to induce Src PTK, HBx protein may have many effects on transforming cellular processes.

HBx and NFκB. It has been reported that HBx is an activator of transcription factor NFκB, which was one of the first HBx-responsive motifs to be identified. 62,63 NFκB stimulated by HBx promotes the survival of liver cells against Fas-mediated apoptosis. 64 Previous studies have suggested that HBx can interact with all major forms of NFκB, including those containing RelA (p65), c-Rel, p52, p50, and p105. It induces the degradation of the inhibitor of κBa (IκB) and p105 through phosphorylation of these proteins. 65 HBx can directly bind with IB subunit of the NFκB complex, causing HBx to enter the nucleus. 61 Interestingly, NFκB can also be specifically inhibited by treatment with sulfasalazine or by expressing the IκBa super-repressor, both of which significantly increased cell death in Chang X-34 cells but had no influence on parental Chang cells. The ability of NFκB to mediate apoptosis was inhibited by HBx-expressing cells, a fact that may play a central role in programmed cell death. 66,67

Effect of HBx on cell cycle. Several studies have shown that HBx can affect cell cycle checkpoints. 68 Many genes involved in cell cycle regulation (cyclins, negative regulators, Wnt-β-catenin) and the transcription profile are altered in most HCC patients. 69 HBx can upregulate the activation rate and level of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 and CDC2, as well as enhance their active association with cyclin E/cyclin A and cyclin B, respectively. HBx has also been demonstrated to override, or greatly suppress, serum dependence for cell cycle activation. The effect of HBx on the G1–S checkpoint control depends on the status of p53. Transcription of p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> has been demonstrated to be activated by HBx in the presence of functional p53 and in a dose-dependent manner. However, the same transcription was depressed by HBx when p53 was absent or present at a low level. Furthermore, HBx has been shown to activate the cyclin A promoter, induce cyclin A–cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complexes and promote cycling of growth-arrested cells into G1, a reaction that also depends on the Src tyrosine kinases-activating pathway. HBx stimulation of Src kinases and cyclin gene expression was found to force growth-arrested cells to transit through G1 but to stall at the junction with the S phase. 70

HBX AND hTERT

Telomeres are located at both ends of chromosomes of eukaryote cells and progressively shorten with each cell cycle. Critically short telomeres induce senescence and program cell death. 71 Telomere length becomes stabilized in most tumor cells, highly proliferating cells and human somatic cells by the activation of telomerase. Consequently, telomerase activation is demonstrated as a vital step in tumor and cellular senescence. 72 The most crucial catalytic protein subunit of telomerase ribonuclear protein is hTERT, whose expression parallels telomerase activity. 73 hTERT expression is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level and the core promoter of hTERT contains many binding sites for transcription factors. All of these factors comprise a complex regulation system that can regulate the hTERT promoter region individually or collectively. 74 A recent study has shown that HBV DNA integration is located upstream to the hTERT promoter and intron3 of the hTERT gene and that the HBV enhancer can cis-activate the transcriptional expression of hTERT gene in hepatocarcinoma cell lines. 75 Experiments in our laboratory have found that both HBxAg and telomerase were highly expressed in hepatoma tissues and liver cirrhosis tissues. Additionally, HBx gene can upregulate the expression and activity of hTERT, 12 suggesting that HBx expression may play a role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis by interfering with telomerase activity during hepatocyte proliferation. 76 These findings suggest a new mechanism of HBV in liver carcinogenesis.

HBx and damaged DNA-binding complex. Damaged DDB has been demonstrated to contribute to DNA repair. DDB1 is a 127 kDa protein that associates with DDB2, a UV-inducible 48-kDa nuclear protein that transports DDB1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.<sup>77,78</sup> The DDB1 subunit of UV-DDB is a cellular target for HBx. Expression of DDB1 increases both the transactivation and the proapoptotic activities of HBx.<sup>79</sup> DDB1 also enhances the steady-state levels of both the WHx and HBx proteins, a stabilization effect that is X-DDB1 interaction-dependent. Given that the expression of DDB2 upregulates the nuclear levels of HBx, we hypothesize that DDB2 might enhance nuclear accumulation of the DDB1-HBx complex. Interestingly, DDB2 mutants that do not bind DDB1 could still enhance the nuclear accumulation of HBx, suggesting that DDB2 associates with HBx individually and independently of binding to DDB1. Given that the overexpression of HBx does not affect the interaction between DDB1 and DDB2, we believe that HBx may simultaneously bind to both subunits of DDB to form a X-DDB1-DDB2 complex; that is, DDB1 prominently increases HBx stability, whereas DDB2 relieves this effect. It has also been shown that physical interactions occurring within the X-DDB1-DDB2 complex mediate these effects through the modulation of proteasome-dependent degradation of HBx.<sup>80</sup> DDB2 is expressed only during late-G<sub>1</sub> phase; consequently, the DDB2-mediated accumulation of HBx during late-G<sub>1</sub> phase may be crucial for viral replication, from which the host cell then produces the replication proteins and enzymes during that phase of the cell cycle.

HBx binding proteins (Table I)<sup>82–99</sup> ATF2 and p53. It has been demonstrated that ATF2, by interfering with AP-1, inhibits basal transcription of the X promoter and the transactivation activity of HBx through AP-1. In addition, the HBx promoter activity is influenced by ATF2. Although the X promoter was shown to be repressed by ATF2, the small X promoter had an ATF2 binding site and was stimulated by ATF2.<sup>82</sup> It was also found that smaller forms of X protein, which initiated at the second and third ATG codons of the X ORF, also had transactivating functions.<sup>101</sup> Small X promoter and its positive regulatory element were located at the 59-distal half of the X ORF.<sup>102</sup> It was also reported that HBx specifically interacts with TBP in vivo. The minimal region in HBx necessary for its interaction with TBP includes amino acids 110–143.<sup>83</sup> The binding interaction between HBx and p53 has been previously identified, and it was demonstrated that the C-terminal region of HBx is required for maintaining the p53 in the cytoplasm and suppressing the p53-mediated apoptosis.<sup>84</sup>

CREB, ICER IIg, ATF3, and NF-IL6. HBx directly interacts with the bZip transactivator CREB and the basic region/leucine zipper (bZip) repressors ICER IIg and ATF3, increasing their ability to bind to DNA in vitro as well as their transcriptional efficacy in vivo.<sup>103</sup> CREB is a leucine zipper protein that binds to CRE as a homodimer. HBx binds directly with CREB via the bZip domain, increasing CREB affinity and increasing its transcriptional efficacy in vivo, a process that requires cyclic AMP.<sup>85</sup> It has also been found that HBx interacts with many other members of the bZip group of dimerizing leucine zipper transcriptional factors. These factors include ATF3, ICER IIg, gadd153/Chop10, and NF-IL6, which may activate or repress gene expression in the liver.<sup>86,87</sup> All of these factors are involved in mediating stress responses and in the regulation of the acute phase inflammatory response.

Qadri et al<sup>87,88</sup> demonstrated that HBx binds with TFIIH complexes both in vitro and in vivo. Their study further identified the ERCC2 and ERCC3 subunits of the TFIIH holoenzyme that directly interact with HBx. This interaction is directed toward a highly conserved domain of the DNA helicases associated with this complex, as HBx interacts with the yeast ERCC3 and ERCC2 homologs SSL2 and RAD3 both in vitro and in vivo. These properties of HBx suggest a functional role associated with TFIIH. Furthermore, HBx and the RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 both specifically bind to transcription factor TFIIB. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each have two binding regions for the other two proteins. The transactivation of HBx requires the interaction of both RPB5 and TFIIB.<sup>89</sup>

HVDAC3 and the mitochondrial association of HBx. The direct binding between HBx and HVDAC3 has also been demonstrated. A HVDAC3 and HBx complex was colocalized to mitochondria, and the mitochondrial association

Fig 2. Signaling pathways regulated by HBx in cells. HBx can influence a variety of cell signal transduction pathways.³⁵ HBx is a multifunctional factor that can stimulate signal transduction and bind to various protein targets, such as p53, proteasome subunits, and UV-damaged DNA binding proteins. It also interacts with the cAMP-responsive element binding protein, ATF-2 and NFκB. HBx also associates with basal transcription factors. HBx is mainly localized to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with and stimulates protein kinase C, Janus kinase/STAT, IKK, PI-3-K, stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase, and protein kinase B/Akt. HBx can also localize to the mitochondrion and influence the Bcl-2 family, an inhibitor of apoptosis family, as well as affect hTERT and cell cycle in the nucleus.

of HBx contributes to the alteration of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential.⁹⁰ The region necessary for HBx’s mitochondrial localization was located to amino acids 68–117, which is essential for cell death but inactive for transactivation function.¹⁰⁴

**PSMA7 and PSMC1 of proteasome complex.** HBx can also interact with the proteasome complex. It has been shown that a proteasome subunit, PSMA7, is a putative cellular target of HBx.¹⁰⁵,¹⁰⁶ It is also reported that another HBx-interacting subunit similar to the proteasome subunit PSMC1, an ATPase-like member of the 19 S regulatory factor,¹⁰⁷–¹⁰⁹ has been identified interacting with HBx. The interacting domains of PSMA7, PSMC1, and HBx have been mapped, and the specificity of these interactions was also further evaluated using a modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system.¹¹¹

**Heat shock protein 60 and 70.** Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) have also been identified as a cellular target of HBx. Hsp60 is a molecular chaperon associated with correct protein folding, facilitating the proteolytic degradation of misfolded or denatured proteins and stabilizing unfolded proteins.⁴⁰⁰ Analysis of HBx deletion constructs showed that the region required for HBx’s binding with Hsp60 was located at amino acids 88–117.⁹¹ Hsp60 and HBx provide a mechanism for the control of the proapoptotic function of HBx.⁹³ Recent research suggests that HBx can directly bind to Hsp70, demonstrating that HBx can form a complex with Hsp60 and Hsp70. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the implications of a HBx, Hsp60, and Hsp70 complex in

the molecular mechanism of action of viral infections.⁹³,¹¹⁰

**PROSPECTS**

The HBx protein is a multifunctional viral protein whose functions and signal pathways are summarized in Fig 2. Its ability to interact with p53 permits it to influence a variety of signal transduction pathways within cells. It plays a major role in cell survival and the initiation of hepatocellular transformation during the HBV infection. Although further research is needed, these data give us insights into understanding the cell-transforming potential of HBV. As HBx interacts with and stimulates many kinases, such as PKC, Jak1, IKK, PI-3-K, NFκB, and Akt/PKB, it has been speculated that HBx might act as an adaptor or kinase activator, enhancing the phosphorylation of HBx-associated proteins. A possible interaction of HBx with the mitochondrion is also intriguing. Biologically elucidating the significant activity of HBx may give further insight into the role of HBx and ultimately lead to new therapeutic strategies for managing HBV-related HCC patients as well as contribute to the clinical therapy of HCC. Defining the function of HBx *in vivo* is a priority that should define research objectives well into the future.
