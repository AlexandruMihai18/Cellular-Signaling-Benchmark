#### ABSTRACT

Prions are one of the few pathogens whose name is renowned at all population levels, after the dramatic years pervaded by the fear of eating prion-infected food. If now this, somehow irrational, scare of bovine meat inexorably transmitting devastating brain disorders is largely subdued, several prion-related issues are still unsolved, precluding the design of therapeutic approaches that could slow, if not halt, prion diseases.

One unsolved issue is, for example, the role of the prion protein ($\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$), whole conformational misfolding originates the prion but whose physiologic *raison d'être* in neurons, and in cells at large, remains enigmatic. Preceded by a historical outline, the present review will discuss the functional pleiotropy ascribed to $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$, and whether this aspect could fall, at least in part, into a more concise framework. It will also be devoted to radically different perspectives for $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$, which have been recently brought to the attention of the scientific world with unexpected force. Finally, it will discuss the possible reasons allowing an evolutionary conserved and benign protein, as $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ is, to turn into a high affinity receptor for pathologic misfolded oligomers, and to transmit their toxic message into neurons.

### 1. Prions and prion diseases: a brief historical outlook

As it often happened, particularly at times when pathogens were largely mysterious, the first example of the human pathology we now know to be caused by prions, was not named after the pathologic agent but after two clinicians, Hans G. Creutzfeldt and Alfons M. Jacob, recognizing around 1920 atypical neurodegenerative forms leading rapidly and invariably to death with atrocious symptoms [1,2]. Sadly, this dramatic outcome, which characterizes late-onset Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) and similar pathologies (e.g., fatal familial insomnia) [3], but also the variant CJD caused by bovine prion-contaminated food [4], remains largely unchanged after a century, despite identification of the etiological agent during this period of time.

This decade-long effort has witnessed the contribution of different scientific approaches: initially from veterinarians, biologists and physicists, highlighting that the agent of the sheep disease (called scrapie) was infectious [5] and unusually resistant to procedures inactivating viruses and bacteria [6]; then from other brilliant minds, e.g., the physician and anthropologist Daniel C. Gajdusek, suspecting and then proving the infectious basis for the endemic brain degeneration (named kuru) that ritual cannibalism was producing in distant Papua New Guinea [7,8]; or the mathematician John S. Griffith, theorizing an unorthodox origin for the scrapie agent [9]; finally biochemists, obstinately pursuing segregation of a brain infectious fraction, and calling it prion (PRoteinaceous ONly particle) after establishing its protein nature [10]. The subsequent years were principally devoted to determine the biochemical and pathological aspects of the prion, culminating in the identification of a gene unexpectedly coding for both the prion major constituent, thereafter named “scrapie” prion protein ($\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$), and a native cell component (“cellular” prion protein, $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$) [11].

Identical primary sequences and post-translational modifications of the two proteins [12] thus claimed that the central event in prion diseases had to be an aberrant conformation of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$. Indeed, such a structural misfolding generates a $\beta$ sheet-enriched conformer ($\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$) with novel physico-chemical properties, which account for insolubility and proteolysis resistance of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$-aggregates (amyloids), a common hallmark of diseased brains, and for insensitivity to classical pathogen-inactivating procedures. The key feature of the $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ conformer is, however, the capacity to self-propagate in a host organism by acting as a template for the exponential misfolding of native $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ molecules [13]. That the $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$-$\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ conversion is key to prion generation was eventually firmly established by the resistance of $\mathrm{PrP}$-knock out ($\mathrm{PrP}$-KO) animals to prions [14], and by generating “artificial” prions from recombinant $\mathrm{PrP}$ forms retaining replicative and infectious properties of the naturally-occurring ones [15].

Although prion diseases are by far less common than other neurodegenerative disorders (one case over $10^{6}$ people per year), the astounding advancements in the prion field have generated the so called “prion principle”, which is now generally adopted to explain the cell-to-cell spreading of self-replicating neurotoxic misfolded proteins and the existence of conformational strains. The reader is referred to other contributions to this section to appreciate all details, and applicability limits, of the afore-mentioned concept.

The demonstration that, instead of nucleic acids as in viruses and bacteria, self-replicating pathogens could be constituted by a protein has radically changed the concept of infectivity. Inevitably after the prion isolation, the necessity to fully define such a “new” agent has left aside the issue of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ physiology that, although revitalized in recent years by the urge for diagnostic and therapeutic tools, remains elusive.

### 2. Physiology of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$

$\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ is a glycoprotein of around 230 aminoacid residues linked to the external cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. It is ubiquitously expressed in all mammalian species, particularly in neurons and in the lympho-reticular system [16]. As mentioned, $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ physiology is not yet solved, not even after availability of $\mathrm{PrP}$-KO mice [17], also postnaturally [18], given that these animals display no obvious developmental or behavioral defect (for a review see Ref. [19]). It is however possible that compensatory mechanisms could hide the $\mathrm{PrP}$-KO phenotype under normal conditions, and that the absence of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ manifests clearly only during stress conditions as was reported in brains exposed to ischemic, or inflammatory, injury [20–24]. Other studies have reported that absence of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ could become evident with age, in light of mild cognitive deficits, nerve demyelination, muscle alterations and increased pain sensitivity recognized in aging $\mathrm{PrP}$-KO mice [25–31]. Nonetheless, an impressive number of possible functions has been postulated, all of which beneficial to the cell life, ranging from protection against oxidative insults, to involvement in differentiation and signal transduction, to synaptic plasticity including learning and memory. As the current review will concentrate to selected hypothesized roles for $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$, we refer to a number of reviews for primary references and for an exhaustive coverage of the issue [32–34].

#### 3. $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$, a defense against oxidative stress

Oxidative stress is one major cause of cell dysregulation and death. It arises when the cell redox equilibrium is altered and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overcomes total antioxidant activities and provokes damages to all types of molecules. By affecting pumps and channels and mitochondrial respiratory components, a key consequence of oxidative stress is a dangerous $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ load in different cell compartments, including mitochondria. This may lead to the opening of the mitochondrial transition pore that collapses the membrane potential, releases key matrix components and pro-apoptotic factors, and eventually triggers cell death [35]. Oxidative stress injuries have been recognized in multiple pathologies, ranging from cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, to neurodegenerative disorders [36], including prion diseases [37].

ROS result from many reactions in different cell sites. One of these is the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$-based Fenton reaction, which takes place particularly in synaptic clefts where free $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ concentrations could increase during physiologic neuronal depolarization [38]. Numerous studies thus aimed at relating the capacity of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ to coordinate up to six $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ (at N-terminal His residues with femto-to nano-molar affinity [39]) with a possible prevention of ROS damage at synaptic terminals where $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ preferentially localizes [40,41]. The observation that $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$-$\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ complexes have an accelerated endocytosis is also consistent with the ability of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ to sequester toxic free $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ and to remove the ion from the synaptic cleft [42].

The implication of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ against oxidative stress was mainly assumed from comparing wild type and $\mathrm{PrP}$-KO neuronal (primary or model) cells or mouse brains. These studies confirmed that $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ protected from oxidative injuries also by increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes [43–51]. Other reports on brains subjected to focal ischemia generating significant ROS amounts have evidenced an increased expression of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ [52,53], and that ischemic damages inversely correlated to $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ levels [52,54,55]. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ reduces ROS production also in intact hearts by modulating the expression (or activity) of ROS-removing catalase and ROS-generating p66${}^{\mathrm{shc}}$, and that it protects the myocardium from oxidative damage [56].

Examination of oxidative stress markers in brains derived from control and prion-infected mice further supported the contention that prion-induced loss of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ functions (see below) impairs neuronal defenses against oxidative injury [57–61]. More recently, the focus shifted to the unfolded-protein response (UPR) that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates to restore ER homeostasis in response to endogenous or exogenous insults, including accumulation of misfolded proteins (Fig. 1). The predominant UPR response promotes synthesis of ER proteins involved in folding or degradation processes [62], but also repression of mRNA translation by the pathway composed of the RNA-activated protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) and the eukaryotic initiation factor $2 \alpha$ (eIF2$\alpha$). During prolonged activation, UPR may, however, fatally compromise

Fig. 1. The physiologic function of PrP<sup>C</sup> and its role in disease. A simplified representation of the multiple extracellular and membrane partners that could bind PrP<sup>C</sup> under physiologic conditions is reported on the light blue side of the Figure. In addition to the shown NCAM and caveolin possibly serving to transduce PrP<sup>C</sup> signals, full details of all PrP<sup>C</sup> ligands, and of the triggered neuroprotective pathways, can be found in the text. Here, major emphasis is given to the capacity of PrP<sup>C</sup> to downregulate the activity of Fyn (short thick blue arrow), and to limit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NMDAR and SOCC (thin blue arrows), given that complexes between PrP<sup>C</sup> and prion, or Aβ, oligomers disrupt both events (red side of the Figure). Indeed, oligomers could disrupt the physiological association between PrP<sup>C</sup> and NMDAR (both located to PSD), and/or hamper the PrP<sup>C</sup>-dependent desensitization of the receptor, thus promoting ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions by the enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. The concurrent over activation of Fyn (short thick red arrow) by the toxic oligomers could also dangerously increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via SOCC (thin red arrow) and modify the many Fyn targets (long red arrow), including NMDAR (thin red arrow) that, now stabilized on the plasma membrane, potentially augment neuronal excitotoxicity. Although PrP<sup>C</sup> was shown to bind mGluR1 and 5 under physiologic conditions, mGluR5 is present only on the red side of the Figure in light of the capacity of this receptor to mediate toxicity of PrP<sup>C</sup>-Aβo complexes to Fyn and NMDAR in some AD paradigms.Aβo, Aβ oligomers.

neuronal life owing to severe repression of protein synthesis by hyperactive PERK-eIF2α, ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and mitochondria dysfunctions [36,63] (Fig. 1). Accordingly, ER stress markers have been detected in cortical samples from sporadic and variant CJD brains [64], while examination of prion-infected murine brains has revealed a major activation of PERK-eIF2α cascades, with reduced protein synthesis thereof, synaptic failure and neuronal death [65]. Importantly, all features could be also reversed upon reduction of PrP<sup>S</sup><sup>C</sup> formation through PrP<sup>C</sup>-expression silencing [66].

### 4. PrP<sup>C</sup>, an interlocutor in cell signaling

Localization in lipid rafts through the GPI anchor [67,68], and clustering in post synaptic density (PSD) [41], have long suggested that PrP<sup>C</sup> could be a (co-) receptor molecule. Indeed, both rafts and PSD favor signaling cascades by spatially segregating, and facilitating interaction of, signaling-related proteins in functional-specific plasma membrane domains [69,70]. Using neuronal cell lines or primary cultures, several studies

have emphasized the potential role of PrP<sup>C</sup> as a signal transducer (Fig. 1), by showing that the mere interaction with diverse protein partners (assayed by in vitro binding, co-immunoprecipitation or co-immunostaining) allowed PrP<sup>C</sup> to promote several relevant biological responses; e.g., neuritogenesis (with extracellular matrix laminin [71,72]); neurite/axonal outgrowth (with extracellular matrix vitronectin [73]); self-renewal of progenitor cells, neuritogenesis and neuronal/astrocytic protection against cell death (with secreted co-chaperone stress-inducible protein-1 (STI1) [74–77]). Interestingly, the PrP<sup>C</sup>-STI1 complex was observed to activate two distinct parallel pathways to promote neuritogenesis and neuron/ astrocyte survival, mediated by mitogen activated protein kinase [75,78,79] and protein kinase A [75,78], respectively.

A general issue regarding this role of PrP<sup>C</sup> is identification of the necessary intermediate molecule(s) allowing PrP<sup>C</sup> located to the external cell membrane to promote intracellular processes. In this sense, transmembrane or membrane-embedded candidates have been proposed (Fig. 1); for example, the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), recognized by crosslinking [80], or co-immunoprecipitation [81], approaches, whose impeded binding

with PrP<sup>C</sup> arrested neurite outgrowth; the 37 kDa laminin receptor precursor, or its mature 67 kDa form, recognized by the yeast two hybrid system [82,83], or by co-localization and binding assays [84]; group I metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and/or 5 (mGluR1/5), identified either by phage display, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization approaches after PrP<sup>C</sup>-laminin interaction that promoted neurite outgrowth [85], or by screening PSD proteins in model cells transfected with PrP<sup>C</sup> [86]; the α nicotinic receptor, determined by co-immunoprecipitation or co-localization assay, implicated in neuritogenesis with added STI1 [87]. Another protein is caveolin, the principal component of non-clatrin coated membrane invaginations and a recognized regulator of signal transduction [88]. After crosslinking of PrP<sup>C</sup> with antibodies to mimic natural ligands, the essential requirement for caveolin in PrP<sup>C</sup>-dependent activation of non-receptor Tyr kinases (see below) was firstly demonstrated in the 1C11 cell line [89] and subsequently confirmed in other model cells [90–92].

Among intracellular proteins implicated in bridging PrP<sup>C</sup> to downstream signaling, members of Src family kinases (SFK) have been frequently advocated following the notion that SFK non-receptor Tyr-kinases are highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) [93], and that the acyl-mediated insertion to the plasma membrane [94] position them to PSD [41,95], and/or close to raft-containing PrP<sup>C</sup>. One of the first proposed members was Fyn that, following PrP<sup>C</sup> crosslinking in neuronal cell models, including the undifferentiated 1C11 cell line, or differentiated into serotonergic or noradrenergic neurons, was found to activate downhill effectors (Fig. 1). These comprised extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 [90,92,96,97], and ROS-generating NADPH oxidase, with the possible intervention of protein kinase C [96,97], and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein transcription factor (CREB) [91]. In turn, CREB promoted synthesis of other transcription factors (Egr-1 and c-Fos) implicated in cell survival and neuronal plasticity [91]. Aside from these experiments marked by a “PrP<sup>C</sup> activation”, it is to be mentioned the recent finding that PrP<sup>C</sup> constitutively downregulates the basal activity of Fyn in primary cerebellar granule [98], and cortical (De Mario et al., unpublished observations), neurons (Fig. 1).

The above evidences, and the recent proposal for a deranged PrP<sup>C</sup>-Fyn axis by soluble oligomers of Aβ fragments (Aβo) [41,86,98], the likely prime source of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [99], demand full elucidation of the mechanism by which PrP<sup>C</sup> links to Fyn. According to [86,100,101], the link is mGluR5 that binds PrP<sup>C</sup> and/or PrP<sup>C</sup>-Aβo complexes (Fig. 1). However, were mGluR5 not expressed, other interesting points for PrP<sup>C</sup> intervention could be given by the complex regulatory system of Fyn, which comprises kinases (including Fyn itself) and phosphatases acting on two crucial Tyr (419 and 530) residues of the enzyme [102].

Lyn is an SFK member also related to PrP<sup>C</sup>. By following serotonin release by 1C11 serotonergic cell lines, it was possible to demonstrate that antibody-crosslinking of, or STI1 binding to, PrP<sup>C</sup> allowed caveolin-dependent activation of Lyn. This led to activation of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt node that, by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β, potentiated serotonergic signaling [103].

Another example of PI3K-Akt implication, however independent of Lyn and of any type of stimulus, is that provided by Ref. [104] showing the neuroprotective action of PrP<sup>C</sup> in brains and neuronal cell models. This was subsequently confirmed in STI1-treated primary hippocampal neurons [105] where, again via the PI3K-Akt pathway, PrP<sup>C</sup> signal was also found to regulate protein synthesis and neuritogenesis. Finally, it is good to mention the involvement of the PrP<sup>C</sup>-Akt axis in tissues other than the CNS. We refer to skeletal muscles harboring significant PrP<sup>C</sup> amounts [106],

where PrP<sup>C</sup> contributed to muscle regeneration by enhancing Akt signaling and by attenuating stress-activated p38 [107]. To our knowledge, this and the report on neurons by Ref. [108] are the only in vivo demonstrations for the implication of PrP<sup>C</sup> in cell differentiation.

## 5. PrP<sup>C</sup> pleiotropicity: the two sides of a coin

Previous sections have defined PrP<sup>C</sup> as a promiscuous protein that receives multiple incoming signals of positive nature and translates them downhill using a variety of partners and signaling pathways. This is clearly summarized in two 2008 reviews reporting over 40 interacting molecules of PrP<sup>C</sup> [32,33], a number that was further augmented in recent years (e.g., by ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) and mGluRs).

Two concepts may help explaining such a PrP<sup>C</sup> attribute. The first one links the structure of PrP<sup>C</sup> to recent advancements in protein biochemistry entailing that “intrinsically disordered regions” (IDRs) may play a role in shaping the dynamic response of proteins to external cues [109]. Increasingly, instead of a mere “evolutionary bug”, conformationally disordered domains are now recognized as evolutionarily selected strategies conferring adaptive traits to complex organisms. Of note, besides a highly structured C-domain, PrP<sup>C</sup> contains an extended N-terminal IDR [110] harboring most of the binding sites for PrP<sup>C</sup> functional associates [33]. Thus, PrP<sup>C</sup> control over the numerous reported downhill pathways may well derive from the capacity of the N-terminus to act as a “sticky” domain recruiting - in a context-dependent fashion - different extra-cellular ligands and/or membrane-associated partners.

The second notion conceives that promiscuity of PrP<sup>C</sup> could involve a PrP<sup>C</sup>-connected factor equally capable to regulating multiple processes but more mobile and dynamic than PrP<sup>C</sup>. With little doubts for the candidate necessary requirements [111], Ca<sup>2+</sup> - the most exploited cell signaling entity - is easily identifiable for this role. In fact, comparison between primary neuronal cultures and brain slices expressing, or not, PrP<sup>C</sup>, has evidenced that PrP<sup>C</sup> signaling and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis are closely interwoven (Fig. 1). This regards, in particular, the PrP<sup>C</sup>-dependent limitation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through iGluR, i.e., both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- [112,113] and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- (De Mario et al., manuscript in preparation) responsive receptors (NMDAR and AMPAR), and store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (SOCC) [98,114]. In the case of NMDAR, PrP<sup>C</sup> was shown to interact with a regulatory subunit, and to modulate (in a copper-dependent manner) the de-sensitization process of the receptor [112,113]. As to SOCC, it has been demonstrated that PrP<sup>C</sup> downregulates Fyn, thereby reducing Fyn-dependent activation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensors promoting SOCC opening [98]. Both examples imply that PrP<sup>C</sup> contributes to preventing potentially toxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes threatening neuronal life [115,116].

Three aspects of these experiments are worth to underline. The first one is that, at variance from the majority of the above reports exploiting “forced” PrP<sup>C</sup> activation to identify downstream partners and events, basal conditions were sufficient to observe modulation of iGluR and SOCC by PrP<sup>C</sup>. Instead of behaving like a classical receptor requiring an activating factor, here PrP<sup>C</sup> acted as a warrant for physiologic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes to regulate gene expression and proteins' function, and the plethora of processes therefrom. Interestingly, PrP<sup>C</sup> implication in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis extends beyond the site where it effectively acts (the plasma membrane), given that use of locally-targeted Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes has demonstrated that PrP<sup>C</sup> safeguards mitochondria from excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake [98]. The ability to ensure a correct mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism, which is crucial to satisfy the high ATP neuronal demand, further highlights the pro-life nature of PrP<sup>C</sup>.

Please cite this article in press as: C. Peggion, et al., Almost a century of prion protein(s): From pathology to physiology, and back to pathology, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.07.118

The second aspect emphasizes that the dichotomic nature of PrP<sup>C</sup> is not exclusive of PrP<sup>C</sup>-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformational transition. Indeed, recent studies have reported that, besides transducing benign signals, PrP<sup>C</sup> also acts as a high affinity receptor for β-enriched neurotoxic entities, e.g., soluble prion [117], or Aβ [118], oligomers. On this, both the plasticity of PrP<sup>C</sup> N-terminal IDR and the downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (which can convert into a death message upon disruption of its finely tuned homeostasis) may account for PrP<sup>C</sup> functional ambiguity (Fig. 1).

The third aspect entails that use of PrP-KO paradigms may provide, with a certain degree of limitation, useful information on the consequences deriving from loss of PrP<sup>C</sup> native functions, as could occur following a disturbed structure-function relationship caused by prions or Aβo binding to the protein. Accordingly, treatment with prions [119–126] or Aβo [41,86,98,113] provokes alterations in signaling and electrophysiologic patterns in a way similar to what observed in PrP-KO paradigms [98,113,127–135], favoring neuronal hyper-excitability. Likewise, abnormal activity of NMDAR [112,113] and AMPAR (De Mario et al., manuscript in preparation), also evidenced in PrP-KO neurons, could prominently contribute to modify long-term potentiation and depression [136,137] typical of prion diseases [121,125] and AD [118,138].
