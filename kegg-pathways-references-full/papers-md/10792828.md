## Summary

Phytochromes (phy) are a family of photoreceptors that control various aspects of light-dependent plant development. Phytochrome A (phyA) is responsible for the very low fluence response (VLFR) under inductive light conditions and for the high irradiance response (HIR) under continuous far-red light. We have recently shown that nuclear import of rice phyA:GFP is regulated by VLFR in transgenic tobacco. The import is preceded by very fast, light-induced formation of sequestered areas of phyA:GFP in the cytosol. Here we report that expression of the *Arabidopsis* phyA:GFP fusion protein in phyA-deficient *Arabidopsis* plants complements the mutant phenotype. In these transgenic *Arabidopsis* lines, both light-dependent cytosolic formation of sequestered areas of the phyA:GFP as well as VLFR or HIR-mediated nuclear import of the fusion protein was observed. By contrast, light-dependent nuclear import of the same fusion protein was induced only by continuous far-red light (HIR) but not by pulses of far-red light (VLFR) in transgenic tobacco. These results demonstrate that photoregulation of intracellular partitioning of the *Arabidopsis* phyA:GFP differs significantly in different genetic backgrounds.

## Introduction

Light, as a main environmental trigger, plays a central role in regulating plant development. Several photoreceptor classes have evolved in higher plants to monitor light quality and quantity (Batschauer, 1998; Fankhauser and Chory, 1997; Kendrick and Kronenberg, 1994). Among them, phytochromes (phy) are the best characterized. These plant photoreceptors are soluble chromoproteins, synthesized in the dark in their physiologically inactive, red light-absorbing form, P${}_{r}$. After light absorption, P${}_{r}$ is converted to its active, far-red light-absorbing form, P${}_{fr}$, which is transformed back into P${}_{r}$ upon a second light absorption (Schäfer et al., 1972). The genome of the model organism *Arabidopsis thaliana* contains five genes encoding phytochromes (PHYA-E, Clack et al., 1994; Sharrock and Quail, 1989). The physiological functions of phyA and phyB, using specific mutants and over-expressing transgenic plants, have been characterized in detail. The phyB molecule is light-stable and responsible for the photo-perception of red light (R) and functions as a red/far-red light reversible molecular switch (Furuya and Schäfer, 1996; Quail et al.,

Recently, photoregulation of the intracellular localization of the rice phyA:GFP fusion protein was analysed in transgenic tobacco plants and seedlings (Kircher *et al.*, 1999). In dark-grown seedlings or dark-adapted tobacco plants, the rice phyA:GFP was localized in the cytosol, and a single FR light pulse was sufficient to induce nuclear import of the fusion protein. Using white light irradiations, a rapid cytosolic spot formation of phyA:GFP was observed that preceded nuclear import (Kircher *et al.*, 1999).

There are no immunochemical data available about the *in vivo* localization of native phyB in light-grown plants. Physiological analysis in ferns, mosses and algae showed that the functional phytochromes are localized in the cytoplasm (Wada *et al.*, 1993). In contrast to lower plants, analysis of transgenic plants over-expressing C-terminal fragments of phyB:GUS (Sakamoto and Nagatani, 1996) or full-length phyB:GFP fusion proteins (Kircher *et al.*, 1999; Yamaguchi *et al.*, 1999) showed nuclear localization of phyB in light-grown material. The nuclear import of phyB:GFP is red/far-red reversible and it is not induced by FR light alone. Thus, light-dependent nuclear localization of phyA:GFP (a VLFR) and phyB:GFP (an LFR) shows significant differences regarding light quality and quantity, similarly to phyA- and phyB-mediated physiological responses (Furuya and Schäfer, 1996).

Beside these deviations in physiological responses, striking *in vivo* spectroscopical differences have been reported between phyA and phyB and also between phyAs from monocot and dicot plants. It is demonstrated that phyB is light-stable and shows a rapid dark reversion from P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>r</sub> (Eichenberg *et al.*, 1999). phyA is a light-labile molecule and in monocots no phyA P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>r</sub> dark reversion can be observed, whereas this reaction can be detected in all dicotyledonous plants, except in Centrospermae (Kendrick and Hillman, 1971). In addition, it was shown that, in monocots, proteolytic degradation of phyA is equally fast in continuous FR and R light (Schäfer *et al.*, 1975), whereas in dicots it is about one order of magnitude slower in FR than in R light (Schäfer *et al.*, 1972; Schäfer *et al.*, 1976). Another reaction that was thought to be detectable only in monocots is the P<sub>fr</sub>-induced degradation of P<sub>r</sub> (Stone and Pratt, 1979). However, *in vivo* spectroscopical analysis of phyA in Arabidopsis grown in continuous irradiation demonstrated dark reversion, P<sub>fr</sub>-induced P<sub>r</sub> destruction and a complex wavelength dependence of phyA destruction (Hennig *et al.*, 1999).

In this study, we report complementation of an Arabidopsis phyA-deficient mutant by expressing the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein under the control of the native Arabidopsis PHYA promoter. We also studied the effects of different light treatments on the intracellular distribution of the phyA:GFP photoreceptor in transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco. We show that photoregulation

of nucleo/cytoplasmic partitioning of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP is strikingly different in these two dicots. The results obtained are in good agreement with previously reported spectroscopical and biochemical data on phyA degradation and photobiological observations regarding reversion rates of Arabidopsis phyA from P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>r</sub>.

### Results

Arabidopsis phyA:GFP is a functional photoreceptor in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and complements the phyA-201 mutant

Biological activity of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein was determined after expressing this chimeric photoreceptor in a phyA-deficient Arabidopsis mutant. To this end, a chimeric gene was constructed (Figure 1a) that contained a 2.5 kb promoter region of the Arabidopsis PHYA gene followed by the Arabidopsis PHYA cDNA (Sharrock and Quail, 1989) fused to the modified green fluorescent protein 4 (*mGFP4*, Haseloff *et al.*, 1997). This chimeric gene was then inserted into the pPCV binary vector (Koncz *et al.*, 1994) and transferred via *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*-mediated transformation into a phyA-deficient Arabidopsis mutant (*phyA-201*, Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Wassilewskija, supplied by G. Whitelam). The selected transgenic plants were grown to maturation in the greenhouse and selfed. The obtained seeds were then germinated in the dark and the expression level of the Arabidopsis PHYA:GFP transgene was determined by Western blot hybridization using a phyA-specific monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Several transgenic lines expressing the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein at detectable but different levels were then chosen for further analysis. We showed that the selected Arabidopsis phyA:GFP-expressing transgenic seedlings exhibited identical growth in darkness as untransformed wild-type and phyA-201 mutant (Figure 1b,c). By contrast to the identical growth rates in darkness, significant differences were detected among the growth rates of seedlings germinated in continuous FR. As expected, under this light condition, the phyA-201 mutant showed significantly enhanced hypocotyl growth compared to that of the wild-type; however, the inhibition of hypocotyl growth was completely restored in the transgenic lines expressing the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein (Figure 1b,c). The transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed, in general, a wild-type growth pattern throughout their entire life cycle. These observations indicate that expression of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP transgene, under the control of the Arabidopsis PHYA promoter, fully complements the phyA-deficient mutant, and that the expressed phyA:GFP fusion protein is a functional, biologically active, photoreceptor.

Nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP 127

Nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis is regulated by HIR and VLFR and accompanied by the formation of nuclear and cytosolic spots

We studied the light quality- and quantity-dependent nuclear import of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein in detail after various light treatments. In these experiments, we used the complemented, transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings described in the previous paragraph. First we showed that, in the majority of transgenic seedlings grown for 6 days in darkness, accumulation of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein was not detectable in the nuclei (Figure 2a). The relatively low level of cytosolic fluorescence in this and some of the other samples shown is probably due to the dilution of the fusion protein in the cytosol. The intracellular distribution of phyA:GFP, in all seedlings studied, was strongly affected by irradiation. First we determined the effects of brief FR, R and blue (B) pulses. We found that brief FR (Figure 2b), B and R pulses (data not shown) were sufficient to induce rapid nuclear import of the fusion protein, leading to a primarily diffusive and additional spotted staining of the nuclei. We also observed that an FR pulse led, prior to nuclear localization of phyA:GFP, to spot formation of phyA:GFP in the cytoplasm. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the SAP (sequestered areas of phytochrome) formation described so far only for phyA in monocots (Speth et al., 1986; Speth et al., 1987) or for the rice phyA:GFP in transgenic tobacco (Kircher et al., 1999). Continuous irradiation of 5h with R as shown in Figure 2(e) is ineffective to induce nuclear import of phyA:GFP and formation of cytosolic spots. By contrast, 5h continuous irradiations with FR and B were sufficient to induce nuclear import and intra-nuclear spot formation as shown in Figure 2(c,f). Under these conditions, in some but not all cells, formation of cytosolic spots was also detected.

These observations indicate that nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP, besides the VLFR, can be also mediated by far-red HIR. It is well known that, in dicots, the far-red HIR is strongly diminished by R pre-treatments (Beggs et al., 1980; Holmes and Schäfer, 1981). To test whether this phenomenon can be recapitulated at the level of nuclear import, we performed the following experiments. Transgenic seedlings were grown in darkness for 5 days and then were divided into three groups. One set of seedlings was irradiated with 24hR on day 6; the other two groups of seedlings were kept in dark. On day 7, seedlings pre-irradiated with R as well as a group of seedlings kept in continuous darkness were irradiated with FR, whereas the third group of seedlings remained in darkness. After these irradiations, nuclear import of the phyA:GFP was determined. Figure 3 shows that pre-irradiation with R abolishes

nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP even if R treatment is followed by 24h continuous FR irradiation.

Nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP is induced only by HIR in transgenic tobacco seedlings.

Recently we reported that nuclear import of rice phyA:GFP in tobacco is induced by short pulses of R, is not reversible by FR, and that FR alone is also efficient. These observations suggested that nuclear localization of rice phyA:GFP was mediated by a VLFR (Kircher et al., 1999). To analyse whether this is specific to phyA derived from monocot plants, we produced transgenic tobacco plants via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation that express the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein to complement the Arabidopsis phyA-201 mutant. However, in this case, expression of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP was driven by the viral 35S promoter (Benfey et al., 1990a; Benfey et al., 1990b) and not by its native Arabidopsis promoter (see Figure 1a).

The intracellular localization of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein was analysed in 10-day-old, dark-grown, transgenic tobacco seedlings and in dark-grown seedlings irradiated with short pulses or with 1h or 24h of R, FR or B light. Nuclear-localized Arabidopsis phyA:GFP was not detectable in etiolated seedlings or in seedlings irradiated with pulses of FR, R and B (data not shown). These data indicate that nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP in tobacco in contrast to Arabidopsis phyA:GFP in Arabidopsis and rice phyA:GFP in tobacco is not mediated by VLFR. Extended irradiation of etiolated seedlings with continuous R (Figure 4a,d) and B (Figure 4c,f) was also ineffective. In contrast, even 1h FR treatment, unlike R and B irradiation, was sufficient to induce low-level accumulation of the phyA:GFP in the nuclei as shown in Figure 4(b). The nuclear-localized green fluorescence increased during extended FR irradiation, reaching a maximum after 4–6h (data not shown). After 4h FR treatment, besides the diffuse staining, formation of brightly fluorescing nuclear spots was also detectable. In contrast, formation of cytosolic spots was not detectable under these conditions. FR treatments for longer than 6h resulted in a gradual loss of nuclear staining, yet even after 24h FR irradiation (Figure 4e) a clear nuclear staining is still observable. The decrease of fluorescence during prolonged FR irradiation is probably due to the slow proteolytic degradation of the fusion protein. Western blotting analysis indicates that the kinetics of the light-dependent disappearance of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein follow those of the endogenous tobacco phyA (Figure 4g,h).

We also determined whether the above-described far-red HIR-induced nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP is as sensitive to R pre-irradiation in tobacco seedlings as in transgenic *Arabidopsis* seedlings. To this end, nuclear import of the fusion protein was analysed again as described for *Arabidopsis* phyA:GFP in transgenic *Arabidopsis*. We determined the accumulation of the fusion protein (i) in 10-day-old dark-grown plantlets, (ii) in dark-grown plant material irradiated on the 10th day with FR, and (iii) in etiolated seedlings where FR treatment was preceded with by 24 h R on the 9th day. Figure 5(a–h) shows the kinetics of far-red HIR-induced nuclear import of *Arabidopsis* phyA:GFP, and also illustrates that nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein was detectable only in seedlings that were not pre-irradiated with 24 h R.

Discussion

Arabidopsis phyA:GFP is a functional photoreceptor whose nuclear import is regulated by VLFR and HIR

Expression of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion protein – driven by its own phyA promoter – led to functional complementation of an Arabidopsis phyA mutant line. These data prove that Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion proteins are biologically active photoreceptors, as found for phyB:GFP (Kircher et al., 1999; Yamaguchi et al., 1999) and rice phyA:GFP (Kircher et al., 1999).

phyA in Arabidopsis has been shown to regulate hypocotyl length by VLFR and/or far-red HIR (Parks and Quail, 1993; Shinomura et al., 1996; Yanovsky et al., 1997). We demonstrate that nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings is inducible by (i) single R, B and FR pulses, (ii) 5 h B, and (iii) continuous FR treatment, at the fluence rates used. These results indicate that the VLFR- and far-red HIR-regulated rate of hypocotyl elongation shows a good correlation with the amount of phyA detectable in the nuclei. Therefore, we conclude that a critical step in signalling underlying VLFR- and far-red HIR-mediated physiological events is the regulation of nuclear import of the phyA photoreceptor. More importantly, we also provide evidence that continuous 24 h of R and B in contrast to pulses or 5 h B irradiations are ineffective at initiating nuclear translocation of the biologically active

fusion protein. Patterns of nucleo/cytosolic partitioning of phyA:GFP show good correlations, in these respects, with physiological responses, and therefore it is tempting to predict that the action spectrums of these photoresponses will be nearly identical with that of the nuclear import of phyA.

Two additional lines of evidence support the functional importance of regulated nuclear import of phyA. First, results reported by Ni et al. (1998) showed that phyA, besides phyB, also interacts with the nuclear-localized, putative transcription factor PIF3 in yeast, and that the over-expression of PIF3 in transgenic plants has subtle effects on hypocotyl elongation in FR. In this context, it should be noted that the SPA1 gene, whose mutation also specifically impairs phyA signalling, codes for another putative nuclear-localized transcription factor (Hoecker et al., 1999). These data suggest that nuclear-localized phyA, similarly to phyB, is involved in recruiting transcription complexes for regulated expression of selected genes. This recruitment may be mediated either by a direct interaction of photoreceptors with transcription factors, as suggested by Ni et al. (1999), or by other, as yet unknown mechanisms.

Therefore, it follows that regulation of the amount of phyA available for protein–protein interactions in the nuclei is another critical step of phyA signalling. This can be achieved by controlling the turnover rate of phyA in the cytosol and/or by changing the kinetics of the nuclear

import. phyA Pfr is a light-labile conformer and unlike phyB Pfr degrades rapidly. PhyA degradation in monocots is accompanied by the formation of SAPs which are thought to be functionally important in mediating this process

(Jabben *et al.*, 1989; Speth *et al.*, 1986; Speth *et al.*, 1987). Nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP in the complemented Arabidopsis plants was preceded by a light-dependent formation of cytosolic spots reminiscent of

SAPs detected previously by immunocytochemical methods only in monocot seedlings.

FR pulses, however, are assumed not to be sufficient to induce significant and fast degradation of phyA. Therefore, to decide whether these FR pulse-induced, fluorescent cytosolic spots/structures are functional equivalents of SAPs detected during phyA degradation in monocots requires further experiments. Independent of the exact function of FR-induced cytosolic spots in phyA degradation, we found that the velocity of the nuclear import of phyA:GFP in Arabidopsis is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of phyB. By contrast to nuclear-localized phyB:GFP, the appearance of phyA:GFP is detectable within minutes of light treatment. Thus we conclude that the dynamics of these processes (protein degradation versus nuclear import) are likely to be essential elements of phyA signalling.

Nuclear import of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP is regulated differentially in transgenic tobacco

Nuclear localization of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP showed a surprisingly different photoregulation in tobacco seedlings; only far-red HIR-mediated nuclear translocation was detectable. We have analysed more than 10 independent transgenic tobacco lines but were unable to detect VLFR-mediated nuclear import of this photoreceptor in any of them, despite very different expression levels of the Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion proteins. Therefore, it is likely that our inability to detect this response is not due to the low accumulation level of the fusion protein in the nuclei. In contrast, the astonishingly strong differences in spectral sensitivity of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP expressed in tobacco and Arabidopsis indicate that the physiological function of phyA is greatly influenced by the cellular background. This is probably exerted at the level of light-dependent degradation and or by the mechanism mediating cytosolic retention versus nuclear import of phyA. We hypothesize that molecules responsible for this altered photoregulation are located in the cytosol and affect protein stability or retention in the cytosol rather than the nuclear import mechanism itself.

Conclusions

The nuclear import of physiologically active Arabidopsis phyA:GFP is controlled by VLFR and HIR showing activity in R, FR and B light. By contrast, nuclear localization of phyB:GFP is controlled by LFR. Thus nuclear import of phyA and phyB shows fluence rate and wavelength dependence as reported for phyA- and phyB-mediated photomorphogenic responses. Therefore, we conclude that specific differences of phototransduction mediating physiological responses regulated by these two phyto-

chromes are manifested and established largely, but probably not exclusively, at the level of light-regulated nuclear translocation.

Surprisingly, light-mediated nuclear transport of Arabidopsis phyA:GFP shows remarkably significant differences when assayed in the homologous background or tobacco seedlings. We therefore suggest that light-dependent translocation of phyA:GFP is controlled by cytosolic factors which are different in Arabidopsis and tobacco and probably affect degradation and/or release from the cytosolic compartment. To address this question in more detail, we have initiated experiments to compare characteristic features of nuclear import of tobacco, rice, oat and Arabidopsis phyA:GFP fusion proteins in a mutant Arabidopsis line lacking a detectable amount of phyA.

Future experiments should also address the questions of (i) what molecular mechanisms are responsible for the different fluence rate and wavelength dependence of phyA and phyB nuclear transport, and (ii) what is the physiological role of the cytosolic and nuclear spots formed during and/or after nuclear import of these photoreceptors.

Experimental procedures

Light sources, plant material and growth conditions

Manipulation of plant material, unless otherwise indicated, was performed in dim, green safe light according to Schäfer (1978). For light treatments, standard red, far-red and blue light fields were used as described by Heim and Schäfer (1982). Transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis plants were maintained and grown on sterile MS medium supplemented by hygromycin or in soil in a greenhouse as described by Kircher *et al.* (1999) and Koncz *et al.* (1994), respectively. Transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis seeds were germinated according to Kircher *et al.* (1999) and Henning *et al.* (1999), respectively.

Construction of various phyA:GFP genes

Construction of the 35S:PHYA:GFP chimeric gene containing the full-length rice PHYA cDNA in the binary vector pPCV 812 has been described previously (Kircher *et al.*, 1999). To generate the 35S:Arabidopsis PHYA:GFP gene fusion, the rice PHYA cDNA was replaced in the binary vector. To this end, the rice PHYA fragment was removed by BamHI–Smal digestion and replaced with a BamHI–Smal fragment that contained the full-length Arabidopsis PHYA cDNA generated by a PCR reaction. To generate the Arabidopsis PHYA promoter-driven Arabidopsis phyA:GFP construct, we replaced the 35S promoter in the binary vector with a genomic fragment that contained a 2.5kb upstream region of the Arabidopsis PHYA gene. The Arabidopsis PHYA promoter fragment was again generated by PCR and introduced into the binary vector as a SalI–BamHI fragment. All gene fusions were sequenced prior to transformation experiments. Transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis plants expressing various phyA:GFP fusion proteins and resistant to hygromycin were regenerated according to Koncz *et al.* (1994). Selected plants were grown to maturation in a greenhouse, selfed and seeds obtained were used in further experiments.

### Protein extraction, protein assay, SDS-PAGE, protein gel blotting and immunodetection

Crude protein extracts were prepared as described by Kircher *et al.* (1999). The suspension was cleared by centrifugation (10 min at 20 000 g at 25°C) and the supernatant used for further experiments. Protein assay was performed as described in Popov *et al.* (1975). Aliquots (40 μg) of the cleared protein extract were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted to polyvinyl difluoride membrane, as described previously (Harter *et al.*, 1993). Immunodetection of phyA:GFP was performed using the phyA-specific monoclonal antibody 073D as primary and an alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-mouse antiserum (Boehringer Mannheim) as secondary antibody.

### Epifluorescence and light microscopy

For epifluorescence and light microscopy, plant material was transferred to glass slides and analysed using an Axiosvert microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Excitation of GFP was performed with standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. Representative cells were documented by photography with an automatic Contax 167 MT camera containing Eastman Kodak 64T film (Kodak AG, Stuttgart, Germany). Dark-incubated or light-treated plant material was manipulated under dim, green safe light prior to microscopy. Under these conditions, in the absence of other light pre-treatment, it took 5–10 min to detect a significant level of nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein induced by the microscopic light. To differentiate between nuclear import of fusion proteins induced by VLFR and the microscopic light, photographs were taken exclusively during the first 5 min of microscopic analysis. Moreover, we note that in light-pre-treated samples, including FR pulse treatment, accumulation of nuclear spots was readily detectable within the first minute of microscopy. DAPI staining of selected nuclei was performed as described in Sakamoto and Nagatani (1996). The slides were scanned (LS-1000 scanner, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and processed for optimal presentation using the Adobe Photoshop 3.0™ (Adobe Systems Europe Ltd, Edinburgh, UK) and Designer 6.0™ (Micrografx Deutschland GmbH; Unterschleissheim, Germany) software packages.
