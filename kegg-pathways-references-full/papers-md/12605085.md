# Enduring Effects of Chronic Ethanol in the CNS: Basis for Alcoholism

Marco Diana, Mark Brodie, Annalisa Muntoni, Maria C. Puddu, Giuliano Pillolla, Scott Steffensen, Saturnino Spiga, and Hilary J. Little

---

This symposium focused on functional alterations in the mesolimbic dopamine system during the abstinence phase after chronic alcohol intake. Mark Brodie first described his recordings from midbrain slices prepared after chronic alcohol treatment in vivo by daily injection in C57BL/6J mice. No changes were found in the baseline firing frequency of dopaminergic neurones in the VTA (ventral tegmental area), but the excitation produced in these neurones by an acute ethanol challenge was significantly increased in neurons from ethanol-treated mice compared with those from the saline-treated controls. There was also a significant decrease in the inhibitory response to GABA by the dopamine neurones following the chronic ethanol treatment. These data suggest that the timing pattern and mode of ethanol administration may determine the types of changes observed in dopaminergic reward area neurons. Annalisa Muntoni lectured on the relationship between electrophysiological and biochemical in vivo evidence supporting a reduction in tonic activity of dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens at various times after suspension of chronic ethanol treatment and morphological changes affecting dopamine neurons in rat VTA. Hilary J. Little then described changes in dopaminergic neurone function in the VTA during the abstinence phase. Decreases in baseline firing were seen at 6 days after withdrawal of mice from chronic ethanol treatment but were not apparent after 2 months abstinence. Increases in the affinity of D1 receptors in the striatum, but not in the cerebral cortex, were seen however up to 2 months after withdrawal. Scott Steffensen then described his studies recording in vivo from GABA containing neurones in the VTA in freely moving rats. Chronic ethanol administration enhanced the baseline activity of these neurones and resulted in tolerance to the inhibition by ethanol of these neurones. His results demonstrated selective adaptive circuit responses within the VTA or in extrategmental structures that regulate VTA-GABA neurone activity.

Prolonged effects of chronic alcohol consumption that last into the abstinence period will contribute to, and may be responsible for, relapse drinking, a major feature of alcoholism. However, relatively little is known about the enduring changes that are produced in the central nervous system compared with the extent of our knowledge of alterations in neuronal function during alcohol intake and during the acute hyperexcitability phase of the withdrawal syndrome. The contributions to this symposium described the most recent discoveries that have been made on such enduring changes. The symposium highlighted the value of the study of changes in neuronal function during the abstinence phase and the importance of studying the time course of such changes after withdrawal from chronic alcohol treatment for its reflections on the alcohol abuse in humans and potential new therapies.

## Sensitization to Ethanol Excitation of Dopaminergic VTA Neurons Following Chronic Intermittent Ethanol Treatment

### Mark Brodie

Dopaminergic neurons are important for the rewarding effects of ethanol and other drugs of abuse (Koob and Bloom, 1988). Ethanol increases the release of dopamine at terminal regions innervated by dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Imperato and Di Chiara, 1986). Ethanol stimulates the spontaneous activity of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area recorded in vivo. Ethanol also activates dopamine-VTA neuronal activity in brain slices (Brodie et al., 1990) and in acutely dissociated dopamine-VTA neurons (Brodie et al.,

Alcohol Clin Exp Res, Vol 27, No 2, 2003: pp 354–361

1999), indicating the excitatory action of ethanol is not mediated by a change in synaptic transmission but is a consequence of the action of ethanol directly on dopamine-VTA neurons.

While the acute action of ethanol on dopamine neuronal activity is clear, there is some controversy regarding the effects of chronic ethanol on dopamine-VTA neurons. In a number of studies performed by Marco Diana and associates (1996), ethanol was given intragastrically every 6 hr. In these electrophysiological studies, after chronic ethanol treatment and withdrawal, dopamine-VTA neurons fired more slowly as they appeared to be hyperpolarized (Diana et al., 1992b, 1993) and showed no tolerance to ethanol-induced excitation (Diana et al., 1992a).

Another study of the effect of chronic ethanol on dopamine-VTA neurons suggested that, in the absence of ethanol, dopamine-VTA neurons were in a state of chronic depolarization termed depolarization block (Shen and Chiodo, 1993). The result of depolarization block is a decrease in dopamine output to terminal regions. It should be noted that the results of both groups indicate that withdrawal from chronic ethanol results in a decrease in dopaminergic neurotransmission. The controversy lies in the mechanism of this decrease.

Acutely administered ethanol excites dopamine-VTA neurons of mice as well those of rats. A study from our laboratory indicates that dopamine-VTA neurons in brain slices from C57 BL/6J mice and DBA/2J mice are excited by acutely administered ethanol, but the dopamine-VTA neurons from DBA/2J mice were more sensitive to the excitatory effect of ethanol than were dopamine-VTA neurons from C57Bl/6J mice (Brodie and Appel, 2000).

Fewer studies of the effect of chronic ethanol on mouse VTA neurons have been performed. One study used a brain slice preparation to investigate the effect of chronic ethanol and withdrawal on dopamine-VTA neurons in mice (Bailey et al., 1998). Ethanol was administered in a liquid diet and, following this ethanol administration and withdrawal, brain slices were made and the effects of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), dopamine, and amphetamine were examined. The baseline firing rate of dopamine-VTA neurons from ethanol-treated mice was reduced compared with those from control mice. The neurons were less sensitive to the excitatory effects of NMDA and more sensitive to inhibition by dopamine and amphetamine. These observations suggest that the neurons from mice treated with ethanol in this manner are hyperpolarized compared with those from control mice (Bailey et al., 1998).

To begin to determine the effect of chronic intermittent ethanol treatment on dopamine-VTA neurons from C57 mice, C57 mice were treated twice daily with intraperitoneal injections (ip) of either ethanol (20% w/v of saline) or saline. A relatively high dose of ethanol (3.5 g/kg) was used. Injections continued for at least 21 days and were not given to subjects the day of recording (which means that there

was at least 16 hr since last ethanol injection). Brain slices containing the VTA were obtained using our standard methodology, and extracellular recordings were made from dopamine-VTA neurons. We assessed the effects of ethanol, GABA, and NMDA on the firing frequency of dopamine-VTA neurons from ethanol-treated or saline-treated C57 mice.

The results of this study were recently published (Brodie, 2002). We saw no differences in the baseline firing rate between DA-VTA neurons from ethanol-treated and control mice. DA-VTA neurons from ethanol-treated mice were more sensitive to ethanol-induced excitation than were dopamine-VTA neurons from control mice. This sensitization to ethanol excitation may be an important phenomenon. If there is an important role of dopamine and dopamine release in the rewarding effects of ethanol then, following this sort of ethanol treatment, a given dose of ethanol may have a larger rewarding effect than prior to chronic ethanol treatment. This may explain phenomena like the alcohol deprivation effect, where more ethanol intake is observed after a prolonged period of withdrawal (Rodd-Henricks et al., 2001).

In contrast, the effect of GABA was reduced in neurons from ethanol-treated mice compared with those from saline-treated mice. This may have important consequences for dopamine-VTA neurons as it is clear that mesencephalic dopamine neurons are under a constant high GABAergic tone in vivo (Grace, 1987).

The effect of NMDA was not different in dopamine-VTA neurons from ethanol-treated and control mice. This differs from dopamine-VTA neurons from TO mice given ethanol liquid diet, which show a decreased response to NMDA (Bailey et al., 1998). It is of interest in the present case that there was not a general increase in the response of VTA neurons from ethanol-treated mice to excitatory agents. That is, the response to ethanol was increased, but the response to NMDA was not altered.

The effect of chronic treatment with ethanol on GABA sensitivity is consistent with the observation of Melis et al. (2002) who found that GABA synaptic currents were increased in frequency following a single ethanol injection. Withdrawal from ethanol apparently increases GABA synaptic transmission. Repeated withdrawal from ethanol intoxication could lead to adaptation of VTA neurons. One of these adaptations could involve the GABA system accommodating to increased GABAergic transmission by altering the composition of GABA receptors, making them less sensitive to GABA. This type of adaptation was observed in the hippocampus and appeared to be the result of a change in GABA-A receptor subunit composition (Kang et al., 1996, 1998). Because of the cyclic nature of the ethanol treatment in my study in the VTA, dopamine-VTA neurons were exposed to continuously changing ethanol concentrations, from very high to very low, throughout the day. The change in sensitivity to GABA could be a result of the change from low to high ethanol concentration and may

reflect withdrawal from ethanol. Although no behavioral signs of withdrawal were observed, subclinical withdrawal could result in alteration of central GABA neurotransmission. As a result, the decreased response to endogenous GABA could lead to enhanced activity of dopamine-VTA neurons in the absence of ethanol.

In addition to the decrease in sensitivity to GABA, we observed an increase in sensitivity to acutely administered ethanol after chronic ethanol treatment. The mechanism for this change in sensitivity to ethanol is not clear, but the fact that the effect of ethanol on dopamine reward area neurons is increased following intermittent ethanol treatment is an important finding. This suggests that an intermittent pattern of ethanol administration could cause an increase in the rewarding effects of ethanol. An intermittent pattern, such as daily or twice daily injections, could result in dramatically different adaptive changes in the reward system compared with the more constant blood ethanol concentrations which result from other ethanol treatment paradigms, such as ad libitum access to ethanol-containing liquid diet or ethanol inhalation chambers. The use of multiple ethanol treatment methods will be required to understand the adaptive changes in neurons of central reward pathways that are a result of chronic ethanol intake.

(Electrophysiological and Morphological Effects of Chronic Ethanol and Withdrawal on the Mesolimbic System)

Annalisa Muntoni, Saturnino Spiga, Maria Puddu, Giuliano Pillolla, and Marco Diana

In the attempt to understand brain mechanisms underlying the motivational properties of alcohol and how changes in neural function induced by chronic exposure may cause the development of dependence, we focused our attention on the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, a major target of ethanol and drugs of abuse in general (Diana and Tepper, 2002; Pulvirenti and Diana, 2001).

This neural pathway, which projects from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), is known to be involved in both acute and chronic effects of ethanol. The vast majority of addictive substances, including ethanol, are able to acutely increase the mesolimbic dopaminergic neurotransmission (Brodie et al., 1990; Imperato and Di Chiara, 1986). Such activation is considered crucial for the abuse potential, while suspension of a chronic ethanol treatment causes a marked reduction of VTA dopamine neuronal activity (Diana et al., 1992b,1993; Shen and Chiodo, 1993) and dopamine release in the NAcc (Diana et al., 1993; Imperato and Di Chiara, 1986; Rossetti et al., 1992; Weiss et al., 1996). There is a general consensus that this dopamine hypoactivity could be responsible for maintaining addictive behavior by motivating relapse drinking during withdrawal to reverse dopamine (DA) deficits (Weiss and Porrino, 2002). Moreover, the reduced dopamine neurotransmission outlasts physical signs of withdrawal, as measured by in vivo

(Diana et al., 1995) and in vitro (Bailey et al., 1998) electrophysiological and biochemical (Bailey et al., 2000) methods, suggesting a role for DA in mediating enduring neuronal changes unrelated to somatic abstinence, but more closely linked to the psychological aspects of it. We can postulate that the long-lasting dopaminergic hypofunction might form the cellular basis of the dysphoric state, which characterizes abstinence from drugs, lasts much longer than the withdrawal syndrome itself, and strongly contributes to relapse (Diana, 1996, 1998).

In addition, recent studies investigating cellular mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced DA dysfunction have shown a decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), coupled with augmented levels of dopamine transporter (DAT), in both dorsal and ventral striatum of rats maintained on a chronic ethanol-containing diet, indicating that a reduced neurotransmitter synthesis and increased synaptic clearance may contribute to determine the dopaminergic hypoactivity during ethanol dependence (Rothblat et al., 2001). On the other hand, a previous paper by Ortiz and colleagues (1995) showed that chronic ethanol exposure (12 weeks, ethanol-containing diet) increases levels of TH and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity and decreases levels of neurofilament protein immunoreactivity in the rat VTA. These authors underlined the fact that altered levels of TH in catecholaminergic neurons frequently reflect altered states of cell activity (Ortiz et al., 1995).

Because most studies on ethanol-induced neuroadaptations in the dopamine mesolimbic system have focused on the ability of this drug to modify electrophysiological and/or biochemical features of neurons, we decided to investigate whether repeated exposure to ethanol, and subsequent withdrawal, might also alter the morphology of VTA cells in rats.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made physically dependent on ethanol by receiving a nutritionally balanced liquid diet containing ethanol 4.5% (v/v) for 10 days (Lal et al., 1988). Animals were randomly assigned to the following groups: (1) controls; (2) acute ethanol; (3) chronic ethanol; (4) abstinence (18 hr); (5) abstinence (72 hr); (6) abstinence (240 hr). Before killing, rats were evaluated for behavioral manifestations of ethanol withdrawal and scored as already described (Diana et al., 1995) by an experimenter blind to treatment.

As expected, only rats belonging to the 18-hr abstinence showed overt signs of withdrawal. Morphological and morphometrical analyses of immuno-labeled TH-positive VTA cells were performed by means of a confocal laser scanning microscope, which allows a tridimensional reconstruction of the cell body and yields more accurate measurements over conventional fluorescence microscopy.

Different morphological parameters (area, perimeter, major axis length, breadth, length) of TH-positive, presumed dopaminergic, neurons were found to be significantly reduced following an acute injection of a stimulating

dose of ethanol (3 g/kg, by gavage, 30 min–1 hr before killing). In chronically treated rats (mean blood alcohol level 238 mg/100 ml, at the 7th day of treatment), there was a further decline in all morphometrical parameters considered, supporting a causal role for ethanol in the shrinkage of TH-positive VTA elements. For example, a mean percent reduction (as compared with control) of ~25% was calculated in acute ethanol rats, whereas ~33% reduction in the area of chronic-ethanol TH-positive cells was found.

On the other hand, in rats belonging to withdrawal groups (18, 72, 240 hr from last drug challenge), although TH-positive somata were found still uniformly reduced in area and perimeter as compared with control TH-positive cell bodies, a tendency to recovery was observed. All together, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that ethanol intoxication, more than abstinence, might be responsible for the reported morphological alterations in the rat VTA. However, to better assess how ethanol consumption influences synaptic organization and function, more detailed analyses are certainly needed. To this aim, quantifications are currently in progress to evaluate ethanol effects on neuron numbers and somatic shape complexity because these parameters are strictly related to drug-induced neuroadaptive processes (Fattore et al., 2002). Interestingly, it has been shown that chronic morphine exposure decreased the complexity of dendritic branching and the number of dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons in the shell of the NAcc (Robinson and Kolb, 1999).

Our data appear to be consistent, at least in part, with the reduced expression of TH demonstrated in the ventral striatum of rats maintained on a chronic ethanol-containing diet (Rothblat et al., 2001) and with the reported decrease of neurofilament proteins immunoreactivity in the rat VTA (Ortiz et al., 1995). Indeed, both reductions would influence VTA neurons size and shape.

In conclusion, although preliminary, the results suggest that (1) ethanol exposure affects the morphological features of TH-positive, presumably dopamine-containing, elements; (2) the ethanol-induced reduction of cell size is long-lasting, being still present 10 days after last drug administration; and (3) analysis of VTA GABA-containing neurons and glial elements would be helpful to verify whether ethanol-induced shrinkage selectively affects TH-positive VTA cells or if it is rather a less specific phenomenon.

excessive drinking. Our recent studies have investigated the existence of functional changes after the acute withdrawal hyperexcitability phase. In behavioral studies, we showed that chronic ethanol consumption increases the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine and cocaine, when tested at times when the acute ethanol withdrawal hyperexcitability was no longer apparent (Manley and Little, 1997). When amphetamine or cocaine were given by daily administration, starting 24 hr, 6 days, or 2 months after the end of the ethanol treatment, sensitization to both psychostimulants was seen in animals that had previously received the ethanol treatment, but not in controls. In addition, increased locomotor activity in response to nicotine administration was seen following repeated nicotine administration in mice that had previously received chronic ethanol treatment, but not in control animals (Watson and Little, 1999). These results suggested that changes in dopamine transmission may be present long after the cessation of the acute withdrawal hyperexcitability. The present study investigates the activity of neurones in the mesolimbic dopamine system after the end of the acute phase of the behavioral signs of ethanol withdrawal, to provide a comparison with our earlier behavioral studies.

The present studies were carried out on adult TO strain mice and the results were published previously (Bailey et al., 1998, 2000, 2001). The chronic ethanol treatment schedule was the same as that used in our behavioral studies on the effects of psychostimulant drugs (Manley and Little, 1997; Watson and Little, 1999), described above, 3 weeks of a liquid diet, then withdrawal from the ethanol, followed by a range of intervals (24 hr, 6 days, and 2 months) with no treatment. Electrophysiological activity was recorded from midbrain slices containing the VTA. Dopamine release was also measured, from striatal and cortical slices, to permit analysis of the changes in neuronal activity, and measurements were made of the binding characteristics of D1-like and D2-like receptors in projection areas of the mesolimbic dopamine system. The use of tissues maintained in vitro for both the electrophysiological and dopamine release experiments enabled the sites of origin of any changes produced by the chronic ethanol treatment to be identified, in the absence of input from other brain regions and from interference by general anesthetics.

The firing rate and the number of spontaneously active dopamine-responsive neurones in the VTA were greatly reduced when the tissues were prepared at 24 hr after the end of the chronic ethanol consumption. In 5 out of 6 slices (one slice per animal) the change was sufficient to halt the spontaneous firing completely. At the 6-day interval, the spontaneous firing rate was still considerably reduced, to less than half the control rates. In tissues prepared 2 months after withdrawal from the chronic treatment, however, the spontaneous firing rates of dopaminergic neurones was not significantly different from controls.

Increases in noradrenaline and dopamine concentrations, and decreases in the ratios of dopamine metabolites

FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN THE MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE SYSTEM DURING ABSTINENCE FROM CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

Hilary J. Little

Many studies have been made of alterations in neuronal function during the acute phase of withdrawal hyperexcitability but, until recently, less attention has been paid to more prolonged changes which might be involved in the persistent symptoms and the repeated relapses back into
to dopamine, were seen in ventral tegmental tissue at 24 hr after alcohol consumption. Increased noradrenaline was also evident at the 6-day interval, but no other changes at this time. At the 2-month interval, the ventral tegmentum from ethanol-treated animals showed decreases in metabolite/dopamine ratios.

No differences were seen in the present studies between tritiated dopamine release from tissues prepared from ethanol-treated animals and controls at any of the abstinence intervals. This suggests that the primary effects of the ethanol treatment were at the dopamine cell body level in the VTA, rather than the nerve terminals. It is possible that small changes limited to the dopamine terminals in the nucleus accumbens area would not have been detected in the presence of the tissue from the dorsal striatum. However, no evidence was found that the chronic ethanol treatment altered transmitter release by causing changes at the terminals in the brain areas studied. Although extracellular dopamine in vivo in the nucleus accumbens has been reported to be decreased after chronic ethanol consumption, the present findings in vitro demonstrate that the terminal release mechanism was fully responsive, suggesting that the decreased release in vivo may reflect the decreased firing rates and other changes in the cell bodies in the VTA.

The receptor binding experiments showed an increase in the affinity for the D1-like receptor antagonist, \[^3\text{H}]\)-SCH23390, at all the abstinence intervals, 24 hr, 6 days, and 2 months (Bailey et al., 2001). This change was seen only in the striatum (that included caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens) but not in the cerebral cortex. No changes were found in binding to D2-like receptors.

We suggest that that the increase in locomotor activity after administration of nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamine, reported previously (Manley and Little, 1997; Watson and Little, 1999), are the result of changes in dopamine receptor function. The latter are suggested to be an adaptive response to the decrease in the firing of ventral tegmental dopaminergic neurons during and after withdrawal from chronic ethanol intake that is, in turn, an adaptive change in response to the stimulation of firing caused by alcohol (Brodie and Appel, 1998; Brodie et al., 1990). The time course of the behavioral changes paralleled that of the increased D1-receptor binding affinity, being seen at both the 6-day and 2-month intervals. The lack of change in firing rate at the 2-month interval suggests that there is gradual recovery of VTA firing during the abstinence phase. In contrast, the increase in the D1-like receptor affinity remained at a similar level at the times studied during the abstinence period. The increase in affinity of D1-like receptors, which are primarily postsynaptic in location, would compensate for the decreased firing. Overall synaptic efficiency at these sites would therefore continue, and the animals appear behaviorally normal, until the administration of another drug, such as amphetamine, that increases the release of dopamine. The resultant effects of this neurotransmitter would then be enhanced by the su-

persensitive D1-like receptors and the effects of the administered drug would be increased.

### ADAPTIVE RESPONSES OF GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA TO CHRONIC ETHANOL

#### Scott Steffensen

The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is known to be involved in reward from natural behaviors, such as feeding and drinking, as well as other types of reward such as electrical brain stimulation and self-administration of drugs. This system, including DA neurons in the VTA that project to the NAcc, appears to be critical for the reinforcing actions of opioids and psychostimulants. However, comparatively little is known regarding the neuropharmacological substrates of this system that are responsible for alcohol reward. A role for dopamine in alcohol reinforcement was suggested, in part, by neuropharmacological studies indicating that dopamine antagonists block responding for oral ethanol self-administration. However, rats continue to self-administer oral ethanol as well as opioids, despite severe neurotoxin-induced lesions of the mesolimbic dopamine system (Koob, 1992). Based on these and other studies, it has since been suggested that dopamine neurons are not reward neurons per se but may be critical for initiating drug use and for reinstating drug use during protracted abstinence (Koob and Le Moal, 1997). Therefore, there is an emerging view suggesting that neuronal substrates or mechanisms other than dopamine may play a critical role in alcohol reward. We hypothesize that VTA GABA neurons are the primary transducers of the intoxicating, amnestic, and rewarding properties of alcohol.

The impetus for studying the effects of alcohol on VTA GABA neurons arose out of attempts to find a subcortical site of ethanol action that influences hippocampal function (Steffensen, 1999). We had previously demonstrated that lesions of the septal complex that effectively denervate the hippocampus of subcortical afferent input block ethanol suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP) and augmentation of GABA-mediated recurrent inhibition in the dentate gyrus subfield of the hippocampus (Steffensen et al., 1993). At about the same time, dose-dependent effects of ethanol on VTA DA neurons had been demonstrated (Brodie et al., 1990) and selective subtype receptor DA agonists had been shown to block LTP in the dentate gyrus (Yanagihashi and Ishikawa, 1992). We subsequently reported that VTA modulation of dentate responses was mediated by DA, sensitive to ethanol (Criado et al., 1994), and that D1 receptor antagonists blocked ethanol suppression of LTP and augmentation of recurrent inhibition in the dentate gyrus (Criado et al., 1996). These findings were supported by our further studies showing that microinjection of ethanol into the VTA produced identical effects on dentate function as systemic ethanol (Steffensen and Henriksen, 1995). It was in these initial studies that we observed the

Fig. 1. Schematic of proposed loci for acute and chronic ethanol effects on mesolimbic circuitry. VTA dopamine (DA) and GABA neurons project to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. GABA neurons receive an excitatory glutamatergic (GLU) input from some of these limbic structures that controls their firing. VTA GABA neurons connect to VTA DA neurons and likely inhibit them. They, in turn, receive an inhibitory GABAergic input from the NAcc. Acute ethanol decreases the firing rate of VTA GABA neurons, leading to an increase in DA neuron activity resulting in enhanced release of DA in limbic structures (line size denotes relative degree of activity; comparisons are between treatment conditions only). Acute ethanol also con

marked sensitivity of a homogeneous population of VTA non-dopamine neurons to local and systemic ethanol (Lee and Steffensen, 1996). We went on to characterize these neurons electrophysiologically and immunocytochemically and found that these ethanol-sensitive neurons in the VTA were GABA-containing neurons. They are distinguished electrophysiologically from dopamine neurons by their rapid-firing, nonbursting spikes, short-duration action potentials, EPSP-dependent spontaneous spikes, lack of spike accommodation to depolarizing current pulses, and their activation by DA or D2 agonists (Steffensen et al., 1998). Despite the prevailing view that VTA GABA neurons are local circuit interneurons, we have found that they project to and receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from cortical and limbic structures. Indeed, their spontaneous activity is not intrinsic but is dependent on NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic input from the cortex.

We evaluated the effects of local and systemic ethanol on VTA GABA neuron spontaneous activity in ethanol-naive and chronically-treated rats (Gallegos and Criado, 1999). Acute intraperitoneal (ip) administration of 0.2–2.0 g/kg of ethanol reduced the firing rate of VTA GABA neurons. Chronic administration of twice-daily 2.0 g/kg of ethanol ip enhanced the baseline activity of VTA GABA neurons and induced tolerance to ethanol inhibition of their firing rate. These results demonstrate the marked sensitivity of these neurons to ethanol and suggest that chronic ethanol administration produces selective adaptive circuit responses within the VTA or in extrategmental structures that regulate VTA GABA neuron activity. It may be that this adaptive enhancement of VTA GABA neuron excitability underlies the decrease in mesolimbic dopamine neuronal activity and release of dopamine associated with withdrawal from chronic ethanol (Diana et al., 1993).

What may be the role for VTA GABA neurons in behavior? We have recently characterized the discharge profile of VTA GABA neurons during movement, anesthesia, and the sleep-wake cycle. The firing rate of these neurons is especially sensitive to anesthesia (Lee et al. 2001) and profoundly modulated by movement, often associated with the onset of certain head movements. Their firing rate slows during slow-wave sleep and accelerates during REM sleep, relative to wakefulness. These findings suggest that VTA GABA neurons do not subserve motor behaviors per se, but that they are involved in psychomotor-related events

comitantly decreases the firing rate of NAcc neurons, thereby disinhibiting VTA GABA neurons. Thus, VTA GABA neurons are inhibited directly, although transiently, by acute ethanol but undergo a late rebound excitation due to prolonged inhibition of GABAergic input produced by ethanol inhibition of NAcc neurons. Alternatively, or perhaps concomitantly, acute ethanol may be inhibiting GLU input to VTA GABA neurons. During chronic ethanol, VTA GABA neurons are hyperexcitable due to either: (1) intrinsic adaptive effects; (2) decreased GABAergic tone from the NAcc; or (3) increased GLU tone from other limbic structures. (Stippled line indicates possible long-term change in accumbo-tegmental drive.) Nonetheless, the persistent increase in VTA GABA neuron excitability during chronic ethanol may account for the known decrease in DA neural activity and NAcc DA release during withdrawal from chronic ethanol.
underlying cortical arousal. They may accomplish this by local circuit modulation of mesolimbic DA neurons similar to the role substantia nigra GABA neurons play in regulating motor activity. The high degree of correlation between VTA GABA neurons and cortical arousal suggests that they may be involved in attention to goal-related stimuli. Accordingly, we studied the discharge profile of VTA GABA neurons during sucrose and heroin self-administration as well as during brain stimulation reward. VTA GABA neuron activity accelerates immediately before self-administration of these reinforcers as well as with intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the medial forebrain bundle (Steffensen et al., 2001). Only recently we have begun to study VTA GABA neuron activity during ethanol self-administration. We have conducted experiments in an ethanol operant runway to study the cellular properties of VTA GABA neurons during ethanol-seeking behaviors. We have recently found that ethanol-dependent rats will run for small doses of intravenous ethanol in the ethanol operant runway and that VTA GABA neurons showed markedly increased firing rates in anticipation of ethanol reward.

In summary, by virtue of their strategic location in the mesocorticolimbic system, their wide dynamic range, widespread terminal distribution, and dependency on corticotegmental NMDA receptor-mediated input, VTA GABA neurons may be critical regulators of brain reward circuitry. The acceleration of VTA GABA firing rate in anticipation of food, drugs, or brain stimulation reward provides crucial evidence implicating these neurons in rewarding behaviors. Finally, we postulate that plasticity in the corticotegmental NMDA receptor-mediated input to VTA GABA neurons underlies the learned reinforcement associated with alcohol abuse (see Fig. 1).

### CONCLUSIONS

The abstinence period represents one of the most important phases in the entire drug dependence cycle (Diana and Tepper, 2002; Pulvirenti and Diana, 2001), a phase which is characterized by a high vulnerability to relapse. During this state, alcoholics show profound physical and psychological alterations that often lead them to resumption of addictive behavior (Weiss and Porrino, 2002). Animal studies have shown that more ethanol intake is observed after a prolonged period of withdrawal (Rodd-Henricks et al., 2001). The studies described in this symposium showed that a variety of changes are seen in the mesolimbic dopamine system during this abstinence phase and also that these changes are dependent on the schedule of alcohol treatment. A repeated injection schedule for chronic ethanol treatment resulted in no change in basal firing but in increased responses of the dopamine neurons to an acute ethanol challenge, as demonstrated by Brodie. Continuous intake of alcohol led to a decrease in the activity of dopamine neurons during the abstinence period, as shown by

Diana and colleagues and Little. Further studies during the abstinence phase by Muntoni et al. showed a prolonged decrease in the size of the dopamine neurones, and Little found an increase in the affinity of D1 receptors in the striatum. Increases in the activity of GABA neurones in the VTA, and tolerance of these neurones to ethanol inhibition after repeated injections of alcohol, was demonstrated by Steffensen. The results in these presentations led to some valuable and intriguing hypotheses on the mechanisms by which the changes in neuronal function could take place. Further studies in this area will prove of great interest, especially if combined with parallel behavioral information.
