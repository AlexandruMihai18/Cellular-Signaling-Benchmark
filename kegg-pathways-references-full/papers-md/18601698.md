The neuroendocrine control of prolactin secretion is unlike that of any other pituitary hormone. It is predominantly inhibited by the hypothalamus and, in the absence of a regulatory feedback hormone, it acts directly in the brain to suppress its own secretion. In addition to this short-loop feedback action in the brain, prolactin has been reported to influence a wide range of other brain functions. There have been few attempts to rationalise why a single hormone might exert such a range of distinct and seemingly unrelated neuroendocrine functions. In this review, we highlight some of the original studies that first characterised the unusual features of prolactin neuroendocrinology, and then attempt to identify areas of new progress and/or controversy. Finally, we discuss a hypothesis that provides a unifying explanation for the pleiotrophic actions of prolactin in the brain.

Prolactin is produced predominantly by the anterior pituitary gland, although, in humans, an alternative promoter drives expression in a number of extra-pituitary sites (1). It has several characteristics that are unusual or even unique among pituitary hormones. First, it is predominantly inhibited by the hypothalamus, and will be spontaneously secreted at high levels should hypothalamic inhibition be interrupted (2). All other pituitary hormones require stimulation from the hypothalamus for normal secretion. A hypophysiotrophic prolactin-releasing factor has been much postulated, but never identified. Second, the primary target organ of prolactin is not an endocrine organ, and hence the classical hormone-mediated feedback loops that control other pituitary hormones are absent. In their place is a system known as short-loop feedback, whereby prolactin itself feeds back on the hypothalamus to regulate its own secretion (3). Third, rather than having actions restricted to a relatively defined endocrine target, prolactin acts on many different cell types in the body. Arguably, this characteristic is also shared by growth hormone, but prolactin appears to have an unrivalled range of biological functions (4). Finally, as well as accessing the brain from the peripheral circulation, prolactin may also be produced in the brain, and thus function as a neuropeptide as well as a neuroendocrine hormone.

Prolactin was first characterised and named due to its function to stimulate milk synthesis. Over the years, however, the range of functions attributed to prolactin has increased to astonishing levels. An early review identified 85 functions in the body (5), and this has subsequently been updated to over 300 identified functions (4). In the last 10 years, many more functions of prolactin have been identified, and in particular, a broad range of prolactin actions in the brain have now been described (6). The term 'pleiotrophic' is defined as a single gene controlling several distinct and seemingly unrelated phenotypic effects. This term perfectly describes the range of neuroendocrine functions influenced by prolactin, which include activation of hypothalamic dopamine neurones to control its own secretion, suppression of fertility, stimulation of maternal behaviour, suppression of the stress response, stimulation of myelination in the central nervous system and generation of new neurons in the olfactory bulb. Prolactin is widely considered an adaptive hormone, but there have been few attempts to rationalise why a single hormone might exert such a range of distinct and seemingly unrelated neuroendocrine functions.

In line with the historical nature of this volume, in this brief review we aim to highlight some of the early studies that first characterised the unusual aspects of the neuroendocrinology of prolactin. We then move forward to current research, attempting to identify areas of new progress and controversy, or areas where more research is required. Finally, we describe some of the pleiotropic actions of prolactin in the brain, and discuss a hypothesis that attempts to provide a unifying explanation for at least some of the distinct actions of prolactin in the brain. Because much of the relevant research has been conducted in rats, we have largely focussed on that species, although, where appropriate, we have drawn comparison with other species. This is intended as an overview of the field. More in-depth reviews are available elsewhere (2, 4, 7).

# Neuroendocrine control of prolactin secretion

Prolactin secretion is inhibited by dopamine from the hypothalamus.

The discovery that the pituitary gland is able to spontaneously release large amounts of prolactin without input from the hypothalamus originally came from the observation that the rat pituitary could maintain the corpus luteum even after the pituitary stalk had been severed, or after the transplantation of a pituitary gland under the kidney capsule (8). These observations suggested the spontaneous secretion of a luteotropic substance from the pituitary gland. Subsequently, it was shown that ectopic pituitary grafts could maintain lactation, again suggesting high levels of prolactin secretion without hypothalamic stimulation (9). Repeating the classic experiments of Harris and Jacobsohn (10) that first proved humoral regulation of the pituitary gland by the hypothalamus, Nikitovitch-Winer and Everett (11) conducted a series of experiments in hypophysectomised rats, transplanting a pituitary gland either under the kidney capsule or back under the median eminence of the hypothalamus. They showed that although pituitaries located away from the hypothalamus would induce pseudopregnancy, normal cycles would result when pituitaries were revascularised by portal vessels under the median eminence (11). Thus, normal, inhibitory control of prolactin secretion by the hypothalamus could be restored. With the development of prolactin radioimmunoassays in the early 1970s, it was confirmed that median eminence lesions (12) or severing the pituitary stalk (13) resulted in elevated prolactin secretion. The use of ectopic pituitary glands, relieved of the hypothalamic inhibition of prolactin secretion, became a standard model of hyperprolactinemia (14).

The identification of dopamine, a catecholamine neurotransmitter, as the major prolactin-inhibitory factor from the hypothalamus was quite controversial because all the other hypothalamic hormones identified were peptide hormones. The first clue came from the observation that drugs such as reserpine, which depleted endogenous dopamine, induced pseudopregnancy in rats (15), but it was assumed that the catecholamines were working centrally by altering the release of a hypothalamic hormone. Researchers then determined that dopamine inhibited prolactin secretion from isolated pituitary glands (16, 17), and dopaminergic agonists were also effective at suppressing prolactin secretion *in vivo* (17). Dopamine was subsequently identified in the pituitary portal blood (18) and an elegant series of studies showed that changing levels of dopamine in the portal blood could account for much of the variation in prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland (19–22).

Evidence now suggests that prolactin secretion is regulated by three populations of hypothalamic dopaminergic systems (23): the tuberoinfundibular (TIDA), tuberohypophysial (THDA), and periventricular hypophysial (PHDA) dopaminergic neurones. TIDA neurones arise from the dorsomedial arcuate nucleus and project to the external zone of the median eminence (24). Dopamine diffuses into the capillaries of the pituitary portal blood vessels and is transported to the anterior pituitary where it acts on type-2 dopamine receptors on lactotrophs to tonically inhibit prolactin secretion (25).

THDA neurones originate in the rostral arcuate nucleus and project in the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tract to the intermediate and neural lobes of the pituitary gland (26). PHDA arise more rostrally in the periventricular nucleus, with axons terminating solely in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland (27). Dopamine from THDA and PHDA neurones contributes to basal regulation of prolactin secretion, after transport to the anterior pituitary gland through short portal vessels from the neurohypophysis (2).

## Short-loop negative feedback

Concurrent with studies establishing the role of dopamine as a physiological prolactin-inhibiting factor, it was found that prolactin stimulated hypothalamic dopamine synthesis (28) and turnover (29, 30) and promoted dopamine secretion into the pituitary portal blood (31). These observations identified the afferent limb of a short-loop feedback mechanism regulating prolactin secretion. Multiple studies in the subsequent two decades have confirmed the reciprocal relationship between prolactin and hypothalamic dopamine secretion. Prolactin acts directly on neuroendocrine dopamine neurones, which express prolactin receptors (32, 33). In particular, we have demonstrated expression of the long form of the prolactin receptor mRNA on TIDA neurones (Fig. 1). Activation of these neurones by prolactin requires activation of the JAK2/STAT5b signal transduction pathway (34, 35) and also involves a range of other signalling pathways (36) (Fig. 2). Prolactin stimulates gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, in neuroendocrine dopamine neurones (37), and also modulates the phosphorylation of TH resulting in increased dopamine synthesis (36). Dopamine synthesis and release are increased in response to acute or chronic increases in prolactin levels in blood (38–40), whereas hypoprolactinaemia results in the suppression of dopamine secretion (37), thus fulfilling criteria to be a homeostatic regulatory system.

The clear role for prolactin as a feedback regulator of hypothalamic dopamine neurones suggests that there must be a mechanism for prolactin to enter the brain. Systemic prolactin gains access to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a saturable, carrier-mediated process (41), possibly involving prolactin binding sites in the choroid plexus (42). The choroid plexus contains fenestrated capillaries, but maintains a blood-CSF barrier by means of continuous tight junctions between the choroid plexus epithelial cells (43). Hence, blood-borne prolactin has ready access to the choroid plexus epithelial cells, which express high levels of both the short and long forms of the prolactin receptor (44). The precise mechanism that translocates prolactin across this epithelial layer into the CSF, however, remains to be determined, and is a potentially important regulatory checkpoint. The arcuate nucleus/median eminence region may also have an incomplete blood-brain barrier, so hormones may have more direct access to neurones in this region (45).

## Varied patterns of prolactin secretion

There are multiple different modes of prolactin secretion (Fig. 3). The prototypical prolactin stimulus is suckling of the nipple by

Fig. 2. Prolactin (PRL) regulates tuberoinfundibular (TIDA) neurones through multiple interacting signal transduction pathways (34–36). Prolactin induced phosphorylation (P) of the janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT5b) pathway is required for prolactin regulation of these neurones, and presumably contributes to the stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression. Prolactin also regulates the phosphorylation of TH protein, and multiple signal transduction pathways have been implicated in this action, including protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC), extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase (CamKII) (36).

the young, which produces a signal in afferent somatosensory neuronal pathways that is relayed to the hypothalamus and then pituitary, inducing prolactin secretion. This is a classical neuroendocrine reflex, where the amount of prolactin released depends on the intensity and duration of suckling (46). Chronic increases in 17β-oestradiol also potentially stimulate prolactin

mating-induced prolactin surges of pregnancy represent a unique neuroendocrine reflex, with twice-daily prolactin surges occurring for up to 10 days as a result of a single acute stimulus (53, 54). These surges are not typical of a normal neuroendocrine reflex because the stimulus does not need to be repeated for another surge to occur. Instead, the prolactin surges are timed by the light/dark cycle, with daily nocturnal and diurnal prolactin surges. These surges provide luteotropic support for corpus luteum production of progesterone (48, 55), and thus are critical for the maintenance of pregnancy. Placental lactogen production from the newly-formed placenta takes over the role of prolactin in supporting progesterone secretion and maternal pituitary prolactin surges cease by days 9–10 of pregnancy (55), due to a negative feedback action of placental lactogen on hypothalamic dopamine neurones (56, 57).

There are some key similarities about the control of prolactin in these different situations. All involve an inhibition of hypothalamic dopamine neurones (20, 58–65), resulting in reduced dopamine reaching the lactotroph (66), allowing increased prolactin secretion. There is much debate about whether disinhibition, *per se*, is sufficient to account for the full suckling-induced release of prolactin. Certainly, our experience is that administration of a dopamine D2R antagonist can result in a release of prolactin of similar magnitude to that seen during suckling (65). However, whether such a total withdrawal of dopamine ever occurs *in vivo* is unlikely (67). Where measured, the fall in portal blood dopamine may not account for the full release of prolactin (68). Hence, there have been many attempts to identify additional factors involved in stimulating prolactin secretion. Lesions of the paraventricular nucleus markedly impair the suckling-induced release of prolactin (69, 70), suggesting that this nucleus plays a key role in stimulating prolactin secretion. Similarly, removal of the posterior lobe of the pituitary blocks the suckling-induced release of prolactin (71). A range of putative candidates from the PVN and/or posterior pituitary have now been examined, but the evidence for a physiological prolactin-releasing factor remains inconclusive. For example, passive immunisation against thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) blocked the suckling-induced prolactin release (72), but TRH release from the median eminence did not increase in response to suckling (61, 73) and there is no concurrent suckling-induced release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (74, 75), suggesting that it is unlikely that TRH is a physiological regulator of prolactin secretion during suckling. Similarly, both positive and negative evidence exists for vasopressin (76) and oxytocin (77, 78) as prolactin-releasing factors during suckling. More recently, the dopamine derivative, salsolinol, has been proposed as a potential prolactin releasing factor (79) that is derived from the posterior lobe of the pituitary and involved in both the stress and suckling-induced prolactin secretion (80). Clearly, it is still unknown whether one or more prolactin releasing factors are involved in the stimulation of prolactin release and, if so, their identity and physiological role remains to be determined. There was much excitement in the field when a novel neuropeptide was identified and named ‘prolactin releasing peptide’, based on *in vitro* actions (81). Unfortunately, based on

Fig. 3. Multiple modes of prolactin secretion. Acute stimuli, such as suckling or stress, promote a rapid and transient increase in prolactin secretion (A). By contrast, chronic rises in 17β-oestradiol, such as during the oestrous cycle or during late pregnancy, induce transient surges of prolactin that are entrained to the light/dark cycle, rather than the timing of the stimulus (B). Finally, in rodents, the acute mating stimulus can induce a unique neuroendocrine reflex consisting of twice-daily prolactin surges that persist for many days after a single stimulus (C).
a range of subsequent anatomical and physiological studies, this peptide is almost certainly not a physiological prolactin-releasing factor (82, 83).

### Contribution of prolactin feedback to the differential patterns of secretion

When the homeostatic balance between prolactin and dopamine secretion is changed by a stimulatory event, feedback mechanisms are in place to restore normal levels. Hence, during the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy, oestrogen- or mating-induced increases in prolactin activate hypothalamic dopamine neurones. There is a 4–12 h delay in this activation (39, 40), allowing prolactin levels to stay high for a number of hours, before returning back to normal. The mating-induced diurnal and nocturnal prolactin surges, for example, are driven by a reciprocal interaction of an endogenous rhythm of oxytocin neurones stimulating prolactin release, followed by an inhibitory dopamine response with an intrinsic delay. This reciprocal fluctuation is entrained to the light/dark cycles by innervation of oxytocin neurones by vasoactive intestinal peptide projections from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (84–87).

During lactation, however, the suckling-induced prolactin surges do not cause an activation of dopamine neurones and, despite hyperprolactinaemia, most indices of activity of the TIDA neurones are low (19, 60, 88). Treatment of lactating rats with physiological concentrations of ovine prolactin is ineffective in inhibiting the suckling-induced prolactin secretion (89, 90). Acute increases in prolactin concentrations markedly elevate TIDA activity in dioestrous rats, but have no effect on dopamine activity during lactation (60). Similarly, implantation of prolactin-secreting MMQ cells into the third ventricle only partially activated TIDA neurones in early lactation and had no effect at mid-lactation (91). These data suggest that the TIDA neurones are significantly less sensitive to prolactin than in nonlactating rats. This is an adaptive response, meaning that high levels of prolactin can be maintained during lactation, unencumbered by a regulatory feedback mechanism.

We have recently reviewed potential mechanisms for this loss of feedback sensitivity (92). There is no evidence of a down-regulation of the prolactin receptor in TIDA neurones during lactation (33), but prolactin-induced activation of STAT5 is markedly reduced (93, 94). This change effectively renders the neurones unresponsive to prolactin, at least with respect to STAT5b-mediated activation of dopamine release. The loss of prolactin-induced STAT5 phosphorylation may be mediated by a family of endogenous inhibitors of STAT signalling, the suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins. Several members of this SOCS family are increased in the arcuate nucleus during late pregnancy and lactation (93, 94). It appears that a combination of the changing levels of ovarian steroid hormones in the peripartum period together with changing patterns of prolactin secretion itself underlies the activation of SOCS proteins at this time (52), although the specific mechanism of activation remains to be determined.

### Pleiotropic actions of prolactin in the brain

#### Prolactin receptors are widespread in the hypothalamus

Prolactin receptors have been identified in the choroid plexus and hypothalamus using immunohistochemistry (95–97) and in situ hybridisation (98–100), and expression is widespread, particularly in medial nuclei from the preoptic region through to the caudal arcuate nucleus. As well as being expressed on TIDA neurones in the arcuate nucleus (32, 33), prolactin receptors are also expressed in enkephalin neurones (I. C. Kokay & D. R. Grattan, unpublished data), as well as some as yet unidentified neurones in this nucleus (Fig. 1). Despite evidence that prolactin might regulate β-endorphin production (101–103), only a few pro-opiomelanocortin neurones express the long form of the prolactin receptor (33). In the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, oxytocin neurones express the long form of the prolactin receptor (104). By contrast, vasopressin neurones do not express the long form of the prolactin receptor, but may express the short form of the receptor because prolactin receptor-like immunoreactivity has been identified on these cells (105). In the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, but not the arcuate nucleus, prolactin receptors are expressed on neuropeptide-Y containing neurones (106). In the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, prolactin receptors are localised on enkephalin neurones (I. C. Kokay & D. R. Grattan, unpublished data). In addition, there are extensive prolactin receptor-containing neurones in the medial preoptic nucleus and anteroventral periventricular nucleus. Although a few of these neurones may be gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurones (107), most are of an as yet undetermined phenotype. Hence, consistent with the pleiotropic role of prolactin, there are a wide variety of prolactin-sensitive neurones in the hypothalamus.

#### The brain also produces prolactin

Although there is extensive evidence of systemic prolactin being transported into the brain, prolactin of brain origin has also been reported. The role of brain prolactin remains controversial, however, despite numerous reports of both the protein and its mRNA in brain tissue. The original observation of immunoreactive prolactin in the hypothalamus (108) has been independently replicated by several groups (109–114). Importantly, all groups found that prolactin-like immunoreactivity was not depleted by hypophysectomy, suggesting that it was unlikely to be of pituitary origin. Moreover, de novo prolactin synthesis and prolactin release could be detected from hypothalamic fragments, in vitro (111, 115, 116), strongly suggesting local production of prolactin in neurones or glial cells. Subsequently, prolactin mRNA was detected in brain tissue by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (115, 117, 118) and, very recently, by in situ hybridisation in foetal sheep brains (119). Prolactin expression in the brain has been colocalised with oestrogen receptors (109, 114), specifically the β isoform (114), and appears to be stimulated by gonadal steroids (109, 115, 117, 120,
121). Prolactin mRNA in the brain is also increased by stress and during lactation (122, 123). While there is no universal agreement, prolactin expression appears to be widespread in the hypothalamus and most studies report prolactin or its mRNA in the medial preoptic, paraventricular, periventricular and arcuate nuclei. Although it is unclear what levels of prolactin might be released in the central nervous system, relative to levels entering the brain from the systemic circulation, it appears that some actions of prolactin in the brain might be mediated by prolactin acting as a neuropeptide, as well as a neuroendocrine hormone (124).

Multiple seemingly unrelated phenotypic effects

**Activation of dopamine neurones**

As described above, the most well characterised action of prolactin is to stimulate the hypothalamic dopamine neurones to regulate its own secretion. Interestingly, although prolactin-induced STAT5 activation is suppressed during lactation (described above), prolactin retains the ability to stimulate enkephalin expression in the same neurones (125–127), presumably through a non-STAT-mediated pathway. Because of the well characterised effect of opioid peptides to suppress dopamine release from these neurones (128), this effect of prolactin may inhibit dopamine release during lactation and facilitate its own secretion.

**Stimulation of maternal behaviour**

Animals lacking a functional prolactin receptor exhibit profound deficits in expression of maternal care (129), demonstrating a functional role for prolactin in mediating this process. Administration of prolactin to appropriately steroid-primed nulliparous rats significantly reduces the latency to onset of maternal behaviour (130, 131), whereas blocking prolactin secretion with bromocriptine (131) significantly delays the onset of maternal behaviour. These stimulatory actions of prolactin on maternal behaviour can be mimicked by placental lactogen (132). Interestingly, animals with a disrupted prolactin gene exhibit some maternal behaviour (133), presumably mediated through activation of prolactin receptors by placental lactogen. Consistent with what is known about the neuronal circuitry regulating maternal behaviour, it appears that the action of prolactin or placental lactogen to stimulate maternal behaviour is exerted in the medial preoptic nucleus (134).

**Appetite and body weight regulation**

Prolactin receptor-deficient mice exhibit lower body weight and reduced fat mass compared with wild-type controls, consistent with the hypothesis that prolactin has a long term role in the regulation of body weight (135). Food intake is stimulated in response to hyperprolactinaemia (136), an effect mediated within the paraventricular nucleus (137). Although phasic increases in prolactin appear to stimulate food intake through activation of

orexigenic pathways, chronically elevated prolactin, such as during pregnancy, maintains elevated levels of food intake by inducing a state of leptin resistance (138, 139). During lactation, prolactin may further stimulate food intake through activation of orexigenic neuropeptide-Y neurones in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (106).

**Stress response and anxiety**

Prolactin acts as an endogenous anxiolytic agent, able to induce dose-dependent suppression of anxiety behaviours (140) as well as the acute stress response (141, 142). Both effects could be prevented by central administration of antisense oligonucleotides directed against the prolactin receptor (142). Chronic prolactin treatment blocked the stress-induced increase in corticotrophin-releasing hormone mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus, and reduced neuronal activation in response to stress, as measured by fos mRNA (140).

**Regulation of oxytocin neurones**

Prolactin receptors are expressed in oxytocin neurones (104), and prolactin acutely regulates the firing rate of these neurones in non-pregnant females (104, 143). It has been proposed that this might reflect a feedback role, regulating a putative prolactin-releasing role of oxytocin (144). In lactating animals, prolactin stimulates oxytocin secretion (145, 146) and expression of oxytocin mRNA (147, 148). Hence, prolactin has a complex role in the regulation of oxytocin neurones, with specific effects dependent on the physiological state of these neurones.

**Suppression of fertility**

Hyperprolactinaemia is an established cause of infertility. Prolactin suppresses both frequency and amplitude of luteinising hormone (LH) pulses (149–152) and reduces GnRH secretion into the portal blood (153–156). Prolactin can also act in the pituitary gland to suppress LH secretion (157–161). In humans, pulsatile GnRH replacement can reverse the infertility induced by hyperprolactinaemia (162–164), suggesting a prolactin-induced suppression of GnRH release is the primary cause of infertility. Such an effect might be mediated directly on GnRH neurones (107, 165), or indirectly through prolactin-sensitive afferent neurones.

**Neurogenesis and glial cell function**

Elevated prolactin secretion seen during pregnancy (166) or following pheromone exposure (167, 168) in mice causes an increase in mitogenesis in the subventricular zone, resulting in increased incorporation of new neurones into the olfactory bulb. Prolactin has also been shown to stimulate mitogenesis in astrocyte (169, 170) and oligodendrocyte (171) populations. These glial cell actions might play a role in helping the brain recover following acute injury such as during stroke (172).

A unifying hypothesis: prolactin mediates adaptive responses of the maternal brain

Rather than multiple unrelated phenotypes, the pleiotropic actions of prolactin in the brain can be considered as a consistent and coordinated response when viewed in the context of the neurobiological adaptation to pregnancy and lactation. The physiological changes of pregnancy put enormous new strains on the mother's body. The endocrine changes associated with pregnancy function to coordinate the multifactorial adaptive responses required for the mother to cope with these strains (173). As with many adaptive homeostatic responses, the brain plays a significant role in monitoring the changing physiological conditions and organising appropriate responses. There are several adaptations to maintain high levels of lactogenic hormones throughout pregnancy and lactation. Initially, placental lactogen secretion overcomes the normal low levels of prolactin maintained by negative feedback. Subsequently, short-loop negative feedback of prolactin is suppressed, allowing hyperprolactinaemia to develop (92). Elevated prolactin contributes to the establishment of maternal behaviour (129–131), and the consequent suckling stimulus drives further prolactin secretion. Moreover, brain prolactin production is also increased during pregnancy and lactation (122, 123), and may combine with prolactin of systemic origin to regulate brain function. Prolactin receptor expression is also upregulated in the hypothalamus during pregnancy (96), suggesting that the hypothalamus is highly sensitive to prolactin at this time. Thus, prolactin (together with the related placental lactogens) is well placed to provide an essential afferent signal to communicate the reproductive state to the maternal brain, driving the adaptive responses.

Prolactin stimulates food intake during pregnancy and lactation, by increasing orexigenic drive and helping to establish leptin resistance in the mother (138, 139, 174). These are key metabolic adaptations promoting energy storage in preparation for the demands of foetal growth and lactation (175, 176). The anti-stress effects of prolactin may contribute to the suppression of stress responses during late pregnancy lactation (177, 178), an adaptive response to minimise the risk of adverse foetal programming from glucocorticoids (179, 180). Prolactin has also been shown to prevent stress-induced hyperthermia (181), and hence may be involved in the loss of the febrile response during late pregnancy (182). Oxytocin neurones undergo marked changes in firing pattern during parturition and in lactation (183), and hence the differential regulation by prolactin may have important consequences for the functioning of these critical neurones during parturition and/or milk ejection (104). Prolactin-induced suppression of fertility (107) may have physiological importance in lactational infertility and birth spacing (184). Finally, prolactin-induced neurogenesis during pregnancy (166) may have important implications for maternal recognition of the offspring, contributing to the prolactin-induced enhancement of maternal behaviour. Thus, rather than influencing widespread functions in the brain, these many actions of prolactin can be considered as a single function, to induce or regulate a constellation of neuroendocrine adaptations to pregnancy and lactation.
