Summary: Bone metabolism is regulated by hormonal or local factors in
the bone microenvironment, and recent studies have revealed that bone
homeostasis is also influenced by immune system. The term ‘osteoi-
munology’ has been proposed to explain the cross-talk between bone and
the immune system. A critical element in this cross-talk is the inducible
transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which regulates gene
expression during inflammatory and immune responses. However, NF-
κB-signaling pathways are also important for bone homeostasis, in parti-
cular for osteoclast differentiation. By bridging inflammation and bone
homeostasis, NF-κB also contributes to the onset and progression of
arthritis. Several natural compounds, synthetic drugs, and gene-transfer
technologies that lead to inhibition of the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase
(IKK)/NF-κB activation pathway can prevent arthritis in animal models.
In this review, we discuss the signaling pathway that leads to NF-κB
activation and the role of NF-κB on osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that inhibition of NF-κB might
provide novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting bone destruction in
rheumatoid arthritis.

Introduction
The transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) participates
in the expression of a wide variety of genes that are involved
in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses,
proliferation, tumorigenesis, and survival (1–3). Genes acti-
vated by NF-κB include many pro-inflammatory cytokines
[including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1
(IL-1), and IL-6], chemokines [e.g. IL-8 and macrophage
inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α)], and adhesion molecules
[vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intracellu-
lar cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)]. Some NF-κB-regu-
lated genes, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, also directly activate NF-
κB to amplify and increase the primary inflammatory
response. The activation of NF-κB by B- or T-cell receptors
is also required for antigen-induced proliferation, cytokine
production, and survival of T and B cells (1–3).
Bone, despite its hard structure, is actually in a constant
state of dynamic turnover known as bone remodeling (4, 5).

At the site of turnover, osteoblasts lay down new bone, whereas osteoclasts resorb existing bone. Each cell type is regulated by a variety of hormonal and local factors. If the balance between bone formation and bone resorption is lost, e.g. due to dysregulated synthesis of regulators, as during inflammation or in estrogen deficiency, bone integrity can be dramatically affected, and the patient might develop osteoporosis or osteopetrosis (4, 5). It has been demonstrated recently that skeletal bone homeostasis can be profoundly influenced by components of the immune system. For example, pathological bone destruction observed under inflammatory conditions has been shown to be due to, at least partly, the effects of activated T cells on osteoclasts. Therefore, the term 'osteoinmunology' has been recently proposed to better explain the cross-talk between bone homeostasis and the immune system (5–7).

Inflammatory bone destruction represents important unsolved problem in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Arthritis in humans and animal models is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration, synovial inflammation, erosion of bone and cartilage, and crippling of joints (8). In RA patients, the activation of NF-κB has been detected in synovium and lymphocytes (9), and the induction of arthritis in mice produced strong NF-κB transcriptional activity in the affected joints (10). Furthermore, gene-targeting studies have shown that NF-κB has a crucial role in osteoclast differentiation (11, 12). On the basis of this evidence, it is believed that NF-κB would be an attractive target for arthritis therapy. We have recently demonstrated that the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)-binding domain (NBD) peptide, which blocks the interaction of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IkB) kinase (IKK) catalytic subunits with the NEMO regulatory subunit, thereby selectively inhibiting NF-κB activation (13), can also efficiently inhibit osteoclastogenesis (14). Treatment with the NBD peptide delayed the onset, lowered the incidence, and decreased the severity of the arthritis. These studies therefore further establish NF-κB as a pivotal target for the treatment of bone destruction associated with inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.

### The NF-κB-signaling pathway

The NF-κB/Rel family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors consists of five members in mammals: p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, NF-κB1 (p50/p105), and NF-κB2 (p52/p100) (1–3). All five members share an N-terminal domain of 300 amino acids, designated the Rel homology domain, which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and interaction with the inhibitory IkB proteins. Three members, p65, c-Rel, and RelB, contain C-terminal transcriptional activation domains (TADs) that are crucial for their ability to induce target gene expression, while homodimers of p50 and p52 lack TADs and therefore have no intrinsic ability to drive transcription. p65, c-Rel, and RelB are synthesized as mature proteins, whereas p50 and p52 are first synthesized as longer precursors p105 and p100, respectively, which are then processed to their smaller forms by the proteosome.

The activity of NF-κB is controlled by its shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to cell stimulation. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm as a complex with the inhibitory IkB proteins, including IkBa, IkBβ, IkBe, and IkBy. The IkB proteins are characterized by the presence of five to seven ankyrin repeats that are essential for their interaction with NF-κB proteins. In response to a variety of stimuli, such as TNF-α or IL-1β, IkBs are phosphorylated (Ser32 and Ser36 for IkBa and Ser19 and Ser21 for IkBβ) by the activated IKK complex, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteosome. This process, which is a key step in the regulation of the NF-κB pathway, allows NF-κB dimers to translocate to the nucleus, where they induce expression of target genes (1–3).

The IKK complex consists of two catalytic kinase subunits, IKKa (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), and a regulatory subunit, NEMO, also called IKKy (15). IKKa and IKKβ share 52% amino acid homology and have similar functional domains, including an N-terminal catalytic domain, a centrally positioned leucine-zipper motif that is involved in homodimer and heterodimer formation, and a C-terminal helix-loop-helix domain. NEMO/IKKy interacts with a C-terminal region of IKKβ, designated the NBD, which is critical for the formation of IKK complex (13, 16). Although NEMO has no catalytic function, it is indispensable for signal-dependent NF-κB activation. IKKβ is mostly required for the classical (canonical) NF-κB pathway that depends on IkB degradation (Fig. 1). Despite the structural similarity of IKKa and IKKβ, biological and genetic studies indicate that IKKβ is the dominant kinase involved in the phosphorylation of IkBs. IKKa provides a partially redundant role in stimulus-induced NF-κB activation. Recent studies have shown that IKKa is involved in alternative (non-canonical) NF-κB pathway that regulates the RelB/p52 dimer (17, 18). In unstimulated cells, RelB is retained in cytoplasm as a RelB-p100 precursor complex to repress RelB-mediated transcriptional activity. Upon stimulation, the IkB-like C-terminal domain of p100 is proteolyzed, releasing RelB-p52 dimers that are translocated to the nucleus. The alternative NF-κB pathway is induced in response to only a

hemopoietic cells and osteoblasts/stromal cells in the presence
of osteotropic factors such as 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃
[1α, 25(OH)₂D₃], parathyroid hormone, and IL-11 (24).

Two proteins crucial for osteoclast development and activation are receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), also called TNF superfamily member 11A (TNFRSF11A), and its ligand RANKL [also called TNF-related activation-induced cytokine; osteoprotegerin ligand; osteoclast differentiation factor, TNSF11] (24, 25). RANKL is a member of the TNF superfamily of cytokines, and its expression is regulated by a number of bone-resorbing factors including 1α, 25(OH)₂D₃, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. RANKL activates mature osteoclasts and regulates osteoclast differentiation from monocyte/macrophage precursors together with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The in vivo significance of the RANKL-RANK-signaling pathway has been verified by the observations that targeting disruption of either gene in mice results in severe osteopetrosis and a total lack of osteoclasts (26, 27).

RANK is expressed as a transmembrane heterotrimer on the surface of hematopoietic osteoclast progenitors, mature osteoclasts, chondrocytes, and mammary gland epithelial cells. Mice lacking RANK have a complete block in osteoclast development that can be rescued by transplantation of bone marrow cells from wildtype mice, indicating that RANK-deficient mice have an intrinsic defect in osteoclast function (27). Furthermore, familial expansible osteolysis is a rare autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone remodeling, where a heterozygous insertion mutation in exon 1 of RANK has been identified (28). The recombinant forms of the mutant RANK proteins appear to increase RANK-mediated NF-κB activation and thus might be causal for the disease.

The RANKL-RANK interaction activates several intracellular pathways leading to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (29, 30), Fos (31), NF-κB (11, 12), or mitogen-activated protein kinases (32), all of which promote osteoclast differentiation. Several laboratories have investigated the interaction of RANK with TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and characterized the regions in the RANK cytoplasmic domain that both interact with various TRAFs and induce osteoclastogenesis (33–35). Two distinct domains in the RANK cytoplasmic tail were identified as the RANK-TRAF interaction domain. TRAF6 interacts with membrane-proximal determinants distinct from those binding TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5, and the interaction of RANK with TRAF6 is essential for osteoclast differentiation and/or function. When this membrane-proximal TRAF6 interaction domain was deleted, RANK-mediated

Fig. 1. Two different nuclear factor (NF)-κB-signaling pathways. The classical (canonical) pathway (left) is activated by a large number of agonists, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, lipopolysaccharide, or the T-cell receptor. Activation of this pathway depends on the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) complex [IKKα/β and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)], which phosphorylates IkBα (Ser32 and Ser36) to induce rapid degradation. This pathway is essential for immune responses, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and cell survival. The alternative (non-canonical) pathway (right) is activated a limited number of agonists that are involved in secondary lymphoid organogenesis, mature B-cell function, and adaptive immunity. This pathway requires NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IKKα, which induces the slow processing of p52 from p100, resulting in dimerization and activation of the p52/RelB heterodimer.

few members of the TNF family, such as B-cell-activating factor, CD40 ligand, and lymphotoxin-β, and is mostly involved in lymphoid organ development (19–21).

Signaling downstream of receptor activator of NF-κB and osteoclast differentiation

Osteoclastic bone resorption consists of multiple steps, such as differentiation of osteoclast precursors into mononuclear pre-fusion osteoclasts (pOCs), the fusion of pOCs to form multinucleated osteoclasts, and activation of osteoclasts to resorb bone (22–24). Multinuclear cells with osteoclastic characteristics, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, expression of calcitonin receptors, and pit-forming activity on dentine slices, are formed in a coculture of murine
NF-κB signaling was completely inhibited while c-Jun NH₂-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was only partially inhibited, suggesting that interaction with TRAFs is necessary for NF-κB activation (36, 37). Furthermore, mice lacking TRAF6 have a bone phenotype similar to RANKL- and RANK-deficient mice, which can be attributed to lack of osteoclasts (38). These results strongly suggest that the RANKL-RANK system activates signaling pathways via RANK-TRAF6 association, which induces osteoclast differentiation.

### Activation of NF-κB pathway and osteoclast differentiation

Analyses of mice lacking individual members of the NF-κB and IκB families have revealed essential roles for these factors in immune responses (1–3). However, relatively little is known of the possible roles of NF-κB in mammalian development. Because mammalian NF-κB complexes may have redundant activities, mice lacking individual family members may not reveal the full range of critical functions executed by these transcription factors. To eliminate possible redundancies and to better understand the biologic roles of NF-κB in vivo, two groups generated mice lacking both the p50 and p52 subunits (11, 12). These two subunits are highly homologous and are usually coexpressed, and they are the most frequent partners of the transactivating family members p65, c-Rel, and RelB. Consistent with the elimination of the majority of partly redundant NF-κB complexes, the double knockout (dKO) mice exhibited defects not seen with either the p50 or the p52 single KO mice. dKO mice developed typical osteopetrosis, accompanied with growth retardation, excessive calcification in the long bones, and impaired tooth eruption as detected in radiographs. A dramatic reduction in the number of osteoclasts was observed in bones of the dKO mice. In contrast, increased numbers of bone-residing macrophages (Mac-2-positive cells) were also observed in these mice. However, defective IL-6 and granulocyte-M-CSF (GM-CSF) production was observed in an in vitro cytokine assay or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of peritoneal macrophages by the stimulation of lipopolysaccharide with or without interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Osteoblasts obtained from dKO mice support osteoclastogenesis in cocultures with normal spleen cells in response to 1α,25(OH)₂D₃. In contrast, spleen cells from dKO mice failed to differentiate into osteoclasts in cocultures with normal osteoblasts in response to 1α,25(OH)₂D₃. These results suggest that the primary defect tracks with cells of the osteoclast lineage, rather than with cells of stromal/osteoblastic lineage. Consistent with these

results, osteopetrotic phenotype of p50/p52 dKO mice can be rescued by adoptive transfers of cells from wildtype fetal liver into newborn dKO mice. Therefore, the defect tracking with the osteoclastic lineage is responsible for the developmental block in osteoclast formation in p50/p52 dKO mice. Lack of p50 and p52 also blocks B-cell development at the immature B-cell stage (CD19⁺IgM⁺B220ᵈᵘˡˡCD43⁻IAᵇᵈᵘˡˡCD23⁻IgD⁻) (12). This developmental defect in B cells in dKO mice is intrinsic to the B-cell lineage, because the failure of mature B-cell development was also observed when bone marrow cells from dKO mice were adoptively transferred into recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG1) KO mice. The recipient mice contained only immature B cells, which were present in spleen but were unable to populate lymph nodes. In contrast, adoptively transferred RAG1 KO mice could support CD4⁺/CD8⁺ single positive T-cell differentiation from liver cells of dKO mice in both spleen and lymph node, although there was a modest decrease in CD4⁺/CD8⁺ single positive T cells in dKO mice. These adoptive transfer experiments clearly showed developmental defects in the dKO mice that were intrinsic to the osteoclastic and B-cell lineages.

As described above, the generation of the transcriptionally active subunits p50 and p52 is dependent on phosphorylation of their precursors, p105 and p100, respectively, followed by ubiquitination and partial proteosomal degradation of their C-terminal portion. p105 is ubiquitously expressed, and its conversion to p50 appears to be constitutive. On the contrary, p100 is expressed predominantly in lymphoid organs, and its processing is tightly regulated by a signaling pathway that includes the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IKKα. Novack et al. (39) have recently reported the effects of a lack of p100 processing on osteoclastogenesis using NIK-deficient mice. RANKL increased both expression of p100 and its processing to p52 in bone marrow macrophages of wildtype mice. In contrast, p100 expression is increased by RANKL, but its conversion to p52 is blocked, leading to cytosolic accumulation of p100, which serves as an IκB protein to retain the NF-κB complex in the cytoplasm in bone marrow macrophages of NIK KO mice. The osteoclastogenesis in NIK KO mice is not impaired in the basal state in vivo but was impaired when an excess of RANKL was administrated. This finding indicates that the modulating effect of NIK/p100 on osteoclastogenesis is most likely important under pathological conditions, e.g. during osteoporosis, periodontitis, and RA, when expression of RANKL is enhanced.

Mice expressing a kinase-inactive form of IKKα have mammary gland defects similar to those of RANK-deficient mice, and IKKα is required for the activation of p65/p50 by RANKL

Immunological Reviews 208/2005 83
in mammary epithelial cells (40). These findings suggest that the IKKα-signaling pathway also contributes to osteoclast differentiation. Although IKKα KO mice die in an early neonatal period, IKKα-deficient embryos possess significantly fewer multinucleated osteoclasts compared with wildtype embryos (E18.5 dp) (41). A more profound defect in osteoclastogenesis was observed in vitro using IKKα-deficient fetal liver cells treated with CSF-1 and RANKL, as the cells failed to form large multinucleated osteoclasts. IKKα was not required for RANKL-mediated IkBα degradation but was required for RANKL-induced p100 processing in osteoclast precursors. However, IKKα KO chimeras, where fetal liver cells from IKKα⁻/⁻ mice were transferred into IKKα heterozygote (+/−) mice, showed a reduction of mature B-cell populations, impairment of basal and antigen-specific immunoglobulin production, and disruption of splenic microarchitecture (42, 43). These results suggest that the alternative pathway of NF-κB activation contributes to peripheral B-cell maturation and, at least partially, to osteoclast differentiation.

**Targeting NF-κB for arthritis therapy**

RA is a severe chronic joint disease that is characterized by persistent inflammation and destruction of cartilage and bone (44). The pathogenesis of RA is focused on autoantibodies and immune complexes. T-cell-mediated antigen-specific responses, T-cell-independent cytokine networks, rheumatoid synovium, and osteoclastic bone resorption have also been implicated. Understanding the intracellular targets that regulate cytokine expression in RA can potentially lead to new therapeutic interventions. In RA patients, enhanced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2) can be observed in synovium and lymphocytes. This finding suggests that NF-κB might be a therapeutic target in RA. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an experimental animal model that mimics RA, and CIA has been used extensively both to study the pathology of arthritic processes as well as to help in the development and testing of drugs that might be beneficial for treatment of human RA (45).

T-cell-specific NF-κB inhibition

CIA is known to depend on T-cell activation (46). Major histocompatibility complex class II, being restricted to H-2q or H-2r haplotypes, controls the susceptibility to CIA. The key functions of T cells are determined by the effector cytokines they produce in response to antigenic stimulation. Activated T cells can differentiate into effectors that predominantly either IFN-γ [T-helper 1 (Th1) response] or IL-4 and IL-5 (Th2 response) (47). Several studies of cytokines at different stages of disease revealed that a Th1 cytokine profile predominates at the induction and acute phases of the disease, whereas a Th2 response is associated with remission phase of the disease (48, 49). Many cytokine genes produced by Th1/Th2 subsets are regulated by NF-κB (50). Therefore, inhibition of NF-κB in T cells might be an effective strategy to suppress CIA.

Transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative form of IkBα in their T-cell lineage repress NF-κB activation and display decreased incidence and severity of CIA induced by type II collagen, compared with wildtype mice (51). This inhibitory effect was associated with a profound decrease in antigen-induced IFN-γ production in vivo. These results suggest that inhibition of NF-κB in T cells impairs development of CIA in vivo through effects on Th1 responses.

![Figure 2](#fig-2)

**Fig. 2. Schematic model implicating multiple activations of nuclear factor (NF)-κB in several types of cells involving both onset and progress of rheumatoid arthritis.** The antigen presentation by dendritic cells occurs in the synovium; T cells differentiate into Th1 cells and clonally expand, helped by NF-κB activation, and then produce Th1 cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ or interleukin (IL)-17. Macrophages and synoviocytes are activated by inflammatory cytokines and can activate either themselves or their neighboring cells. These cells also produce or auto-amplify inflammatory cytokines. The activated T cells or synoviocytes produce RANKL that binds to RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursors and then activate NF-κB to differentiate to mature osteoclasts. Osteoclast activation mediates abundant bone resorption, while synoviocytes can invade cartilage.
SP100030, isolated upon screening small-molecule chemical libraries, has been demonstrated to act as a potent inhibitor of NF-κB in simulated Jurkat cells (52). This compound suppressed the expression of NF-κB-regulated cytokines (IL-2, IL-8, and TNF-α) at the mRNA and protein levels in T-cell lines but not in monocyte cells, fibroblasts, synoviocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and osteoblasts. Treatment with SP100030 significantly decreased the severity of arthritis from onset of clinical signs and synovial NF-κB binding in arthritic mouse ankles in CIA. The selectivity for T cells of SP100030 might provide potent immunosuppression with less toxicity than other NF-κB inhibitors.

Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production from synovium by NF-κB inhibition

One of the characteristic features of RA is synovial hyperplasia with infiltration of various inflammatory cells resulting in degradation of articular cartilage and bone (53). Synovial cells are a major source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and IL-1 and TNF-α expression is clearly recognizable at the site of cartilage–pannus junction (54). NF-κB is activated in the synovium of patients with RA (55). Intra-articular gene transfer of wildtype IKKβ, using an adenoviral vector, into the joint of normal rats resulted in significant paw swelling and histological evidence of synovial inflammation (56). Increased IKK activity was also detectable in wildtype IKKβ-injected ankle joints, coincident with enhanced NF-κB-binding activity. In contrast, introduction of dominant negative forms of IKKβ or IkBαDN, using adenoviral vectors, significantly suppressed the severity of adjuvant arthritis and was accompanied with decreased NF-κB DNA-binding activity. Intra-articular administration of NF-κB decoy oligonucleotides prevents the recurrence of streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis (57). Therefore, IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation plays a key role in synovial inflammation, and intra-articular gene therapy to inhibit NF-κB activity represents an attractive strategy for the treatment of chronic arthritis.

NBD peptide

Recent studies have identified an N-terminal α-helical region of NEMO that associates with a hexapeptide sequence within the extreme carboxyl-terminus of IKKβ and IKKα, termed the NBD (14, 16). Importantly, cell-permeable peptides spanning the NBD (NBD peptide) disrupted the association of NEMO with IKKβ, blocked NF-κB activation, and ameliorated inflammatory responses in animal models of inflammation (14). Hence, the NBD might be an attractive target for the development of drugs aimed at disrupting the IKK complex. An

advantage of the NBD peptide is that it blocks only the induced activity of NF-κB without affecting the basal NF-κB activity, thereby minimizing the chances of toxicity as a result of inhibiting the anti-apoptotic effects of NF-κB. This selectivity may be of particular relevance for the treatment of chronic diseases such as RA.

As described above, gene-targeting studies have shown NF-κB has a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis, and the ability of the NBD peptide in preventing inflammatory bone resorption was tested. The peptide inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The peptide inhibited both NF-κB-binding activity and transcriptional activity, but it did not inhibit JNK activity induced by RANKL in bone marrow macrophages (osteoclast precursors). The peptide did not affect RANK expression and proliferation of osteoclast precursors. Furthermore, osteoblast differentiation induced by ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate was unaffected by the treatment with NBD peptide in vitro. NBD peptide also blocked RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vivo. In addition, NBD peptide significantly reduced the severity of CIA in mice by reducing levels of TNF-α and IL-1β production, abrogating joint swelling and reducing destruction of bone and cartilage. The mutant NBD peptide fails to exert these functions (15). Recently, Dai et al. (58) have also reported that the NBD peptide, coupled to a different cell-permeable sequence, blocked osteoclastogenesis in vitro and bone erosion in serum-transferred arthritis. Thus, blockade of NEMO assembly with IKK complex is a viable strategy to prevent inflammatory osteolysis.

Conclusions

The term osteoimmunology is an emerging concept that proposes that certain regulatory molecules link bone metabolism and the immune system. It is now appreciated that the skeletal and immune systems regulate each other to a much greater degree than thought previously. A key molecule in this link between bone and immune responses is the transcription factor NF-κB. The NF-κB p50/p52 dKO was the first genetic model to reveal a direct link, but subsequent studies on IKKα-and NIK-deficient mice have further strengthened the evidence for this cross-talk. It is now well accepted that NF-κB plays an essential role for osteoclast differentiation; however, the molecular mechanism of how NF-κB regulates osteoclast differentiation remains unclear. It is still important to identify the target genes of NF-κB and to define the molecular mechanisms through which NF-κB regulates osteoclast differentiation.
