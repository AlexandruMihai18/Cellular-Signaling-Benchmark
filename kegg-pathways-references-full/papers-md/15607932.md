# 1. Introduction

The major platinum (Pt) drugs currently used in the clinic include cisplatin (DDP), carboplatin (CBDCA) and oxaliplatin (L-OHP). DDP and CBDCA generally have

assembled in the plasma membrane. Both proteins have eight membrane spanning domains [31, 36, 37] of which the sixth is conserved and forms the channel through which Cu moves (references in [38]). Both proteins also have 6 “metal binding sequences” (MBS) repeats of approximately 70 amino acids each at the N-terminal cytosolic side. Each MBS repeat

Cells selected for resistance to Cu or Pt drugs show parallel pharmacokinetic changes and transporter expression properties  

| Drug used for selection | Cell line | Cu | Cu transporter studied |
|-------------------------|-----------|----|------------------------|
|                         |           | Fold resistance | Pt-DNA adduct | Fold resistance | Efflux rate | Cu content | Basal Cu content | RNA levels | Protein levels |
of one or more of the proteins involved in Cu homeostasis. For example, the levels of the Cu efflux protein ATP7B were, respectively, 2.3 and 3.9 times higher in Cu-selected hepatocellular carcinoma CuR23 and CuR27 sublines than in their sensitive parental HuH7 cells [59,73]. Similar results were also reported by Schil

Cells transfected to express Cu proteins display parallel pharmacokinetic properties with respect to Pt drugs and Cu

ysis of the expression of ATP7A in 54 patients with ovarian carcinoma before and after treatment with a Pt drug-containing regimen demonstrated that, in some patients, treatment caused enrichment of the tumor for ATP7A-expressing cells, and the treatment outcome in patients in whom this occurred was quite poor [93].
