## Summary

We have isolated a cDNA clone that corresponds to the Ht1 locus of petunia which controls the hydroxylation of dihydrokaempferol to dihydroquercetin and of naringenin to eriodictyol by the action of flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H). The cDNA encodes a 512 amino acid polypeptide with regions of similarity to petunia flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylases (F3′5′H). Both F3′H and F3′5′H are cytochromes P450 and are key enzymes in the flavonoid pathway leading to the production of the coloured anthocyanins. The F3′H transcript is most abundant in petals from flowers at an early stage of development and levels decline as the flower matures. Transcripts are also detected in the ovaries, sepals, peduncles, stems and anthers of the petunia plant. No or very reduced levels of transcripts are detected in ht1/ht1 lines. This is the first report of isolation of a F3′H cDNA clone from any species.

## Introduction

Flower colour is predominantly due to three types of pigment: flavonoids, carotenoids and betalains. The flavonoids are the most common of the three types of pigment and contribute to a range of colours from yellow to red to blue. They are water-soluble compounds and occur in most flowering plants. The flavonoid molecules that make the major contribution to flower colour in petunia are the anthocyanins, which are glycosylated derivatives of the anthocyanidins: cyanidin and peonidin, contributing to the red/pink colours, and delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin, contributing to the blue/violet colours (see Figure 1).

The biosynthetic pathway for the flavonoid pigments is well established and many of the structural genes have been cloned (Holton and Cornish, 1995). The first committed step in the pathway (Figure 1) involves the condensation of three molecules of malonyl-CoA with one molecule of p-coumaroyl-CoA. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme chalcone synthase (CHS). The product of this reaction, 2′,4,4′,6′, tetrahydroxychalcone, is normally rapidly isomerized by chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI) to produce naringenin. Naringenin is subsequently hydroxylated at the 3 position of the central ring by flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) to produce dihydrokaempferol (DHK).

The hydroxylation pattern of the B-ring of DHK (Stafford, 1990) plays a key role in determining petal colour. In petunia, the B-ring of DHK can be hydroxylated at either the 3′ position, to produce dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and lead to the production of the cyanidin-based pigments, or at both the 3′ and 5′ positions to produce dihydromyricetin (DHM) and lead to the production of the delphinidin-based pigments. Two key enzymes involved in this pathway are flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H) and flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H) which are both microsomal cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases that require NADPH as a co-factor (Forkmann, 1991). F3′H enzyme activity was first demonstrated in microsomal preparations from *Happlopappus* cell cultures (Fritsch and Grisebach, 1975), and has been detected in floral extracts from a number of ornamental plants including defined genotypes of *Matthiola incana* (Forkmann et al., 1980), *Antirrhinum majus* (Forkmann and Stotz, 1981), *Dianthus caryophyllus* (Spribille and Forkmann, 1982) and *Petunia hybrida* (Stotz et al., 1985).

The dihydroflavonols (DHQ and DHM) are subsequently reduced to flavan-3, 4-cis diols (leucoanthocyanidins) by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR). In petunia, the DFR has a higher substrate specificity for DHM than DHQ. However, the petunia DFR has a low substrate specificity for DHK so that the brick-red pelargonidin based pigment is rarely found (Forkmann and Ruhnau, 1987). Further oxidation, dehydration and glycosylation of the leucoanthocyanidins lead to the production of the coloured anthocyanins, the red cyanidin-based pigments (hydroxylated at the 3′ and 4′ positions of the B-ring) and the blue/violet delphinidin-based pigments (hydroxylated at the 3′, 4′ and 5′ positions of the B-ring). Further modification of the anthocyanins including glycosylation, acylation and methylation can also occur (Stafford, 1990). DHK and DHQ can also be converted to kaempferol and quercetin, respectively, by

(Wiering, 1974). *Ht1* is phenotypically expressed in the limb and tube of the corolla, whereas *Ht2* acts only in the corolla tube and is only observed when *Ht1* is recessive (Wiering, 1974). There is a strict correlation between F3′H activity and the *Ht1* locus in defined genotypes of *P. hybrida* (Stotz et al., 1985).

This paper reports on the isolation of a F3′H cDNA clone from *Petunia hybrida* that is linked to the *Ht1* locus. This is the first report on the isolation of a F3′H clone from any species.

### Results

#### Isolation of a flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H) cDNA clone corresponding to the *Ht1* locus from *P. hybrida*

We set out to isolate a cDNA encoding the flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H) which was linked to the *Ht1* locus in petunia. The *P. hybrida* cv Old Glory Red (OGR) is a hybrid line that accumulates cyanidin-based pigments in the corolla limb. One hundred thousand clones of an amplified OGR corolla limb cDNA library were screened with a mixture of ³²P-labelled fragments isolated from four different petunia cytochrome P450 cDNA clones, three of which are involved in the flavonoid pathway. These included a cDNA clone representing cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and two petunia cDNA clones (corresponding to the *Hf1* and *Hf2* loci) encoding F3′5′H (Holton et al., 1993a).

Out of 230 strongly hybridizing clones, 39 were selected at random to isolate pure clones for further characterization. Plasmids were rescued and sequence data were generated from the 3′ and 5′ ends of the cDNA inserts. Based on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence, 27 of the 39 were identical to the petunia C4H cDNA clone, two of the 39 were identical to the *Hf1* cDNA clone and seven of the 39 did not appear to represent cytochromes P450 because the deduced amino acid sequence did not show sequence similarity to highly conserved amino acids found in all cytochromes P450 isolated to date (Chapple, 1998; Nelson and Strobel, 1988). The remaining three cDNA clones represented novel cytochromes P450 and were not identical to the P450 clones used in the screening procedure. These were subjected to RFLP analysis (see below) and one clone designated pCGP1805, which contained a cDNA insert (OGR-38) of around 1.8 kb, was chosen for further characterization based on these results. Sequence analysis indicated that it contained a putative open reading frame of 1536 bases which encodes a polypeptide of 512 amino acids (Figure 2).

The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of OGR-38 were compared with those of the cytochrome P450 probes used in the screening process and with

sequences in the GenBank database using a BLAST search (Altschul *et al.*, 1990). The nucleotide sequence of OGR-38 was most similar to that of the F3′5′Hs (representing the *Hf1* and *Hf2* loci) from *P. hybrid*a (Holton *et al.*, 1993a). An LFASTA alignment (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) of the *Hf1* clone and the OGR-38 clone revealed 60% identity at the nucleotide level and 50% identity at the amino acid level. The *Hf2* clone showed 59% identity at the nucleotide level and 49% identity at the amino acid level to the OGR-38 sequence. A ClustalW (Thompson *et al.*, 1994) alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of these hydroxylases is shown in Figure 3(a). Cytochrome P450 classification, based on the deduced amino acid sequence, placed OGR-38 into the CYP75B2 family (Nelson *et al.*, 1996), the first representative (CYP75B1) of which is sequence from the N-terminus exon of an *Arabidopsis thaliana* genomic DNA on chromosome 5 (P1 clone MXM12) (Sato *et al.*, 1997). Phylogenetic analysis using the deduced amino acid sequences of a range of plant P450s is shown in Figure 3(b). It also indicates that OGR-38 (CYP75B2) is most similar to the F3′5′H (CYP757A1 and 75A2) than other P450s, including those used in the screening process.

RFLP and RNA blot analysis of a VR (*Ht1/ht1*) × V23 (*ht1/ht1*) backcross population were used to investigate linkage of the gene corresponding to the OGR-38 cDNA to the *Ht1* locus. In petunia, if the dominant allele of *Hf1* is present (as is the case with VR) then *Ht1* has no visible effect on flower colour and only delphinidin derivatives are present (Gerats *et al.*, 1982). The nature of the flavonol, however, is dependent on the genotype with regard to the status of *Ht1*. Therefore, flowers from a VR (*Ht1/ht1*) × V23 (*ht1/ht1*) backcross population were analysed for the presence of the flavonols, kaempferol and quercetin. VR (*Ht1/ht1*) flowers accumulate the 3′,4′-hydroxylated flavonol (quercetin) and low levels of the 4′-hydroxylated flavonol (kaempferol), while V23 (*ht1/ht1*) flowers accumulate kaempferol but little or no quercetin. Individual plants from the VR (*Ht1/ht1*) × V23 (*ht1/ht1*) backcross were designated as VR-like (*Ht1/ht1*) if a substantial level of quercetin was detected in the flower extracts, and V23-like (*ht1/ht1*) if little or no quercetin but substantial levels of kaempferol were detected in the flower extracts (see Figure 1).

³²P-labelled fragments of the OGR-38 cDNA clone were used to probe RNA blots of total RNA isolated from petal limbs of individual plants in the VR (*Ht1/ht1*) × V23 (*ht1/ht1*) backcross population. Blots of genomic DNA isolated from individual plants in the VR (*Ht1/ht1*) × V23 (*ht1/ht1*) backcross population were also hybridized with the same probe. DNA blots of EcoRI digested V23 (*ht1/ht1*) and VR (*Ht1/ht1*) genomic DNA probed with OGR-38 revealed one hybridizing band in V23 and two hybridizing bands in VR under high stringency conditions. Analysis of EcoRI digested genomic DNA isolated from 12 plants of the VR × V23 backcross population revealed a RFLP for the OGR-38 probe which was linked to *Ht1* (data not shown).

genotypes. A 1.8kb transcript was detected in $Ht1/Ht1$ lines (OGR, R18, Dla51 and Ba20) compared to a much reduced or absent hybridizing transcript in the $ht1/ht1$ lines (Sw63, Sd5 and Skr4) (Figure 4b).

The petunia line W2169 is an $An1$ and $Ht1$ mutable line derived from W138 (van Houwelingen *et al.*, 1998). A transposon in the $An1$ locus leads to the production of acyanic flowers. W2169 flowers with a $Ht1^+$ phenotype are generally white with red spots or sectors and occasionally are completely red (due to the excision of the transposon from the $An1$ locus at an early stage of flower development). These flowers predominantly accumulate the 3',4'-hydroxylated flavonol, quercetin. W2169 flowers with an $ht1^m$ phenotype are generally white with pink spots or sectors (and occasionally completely pink, due to excision of the transposon from the $An1$ locus) and predominantly accumulate the 4'-hydroxylated flavonol, kaempferol. Total RNA isolated from a white petal with pink sectors of W2169 ($ht1^m$) and from red revertant petals of W2169 ($Ht1$) were examined for expression of mRNA hybridizing to the OGR-38 probe (Figure 4c). The OGR-38 probe detected a 2.1kb transcript in the $ht1^m$ petal (white) tissue and a 1.8kb transcript in the revertant tissue similar to that detected in a wild-type control (V2079).

Further evidence that the OGR-38 cDNA derives from the $Ht1$ locus was provided by experiments where oligonucleotide primers designed to the OGR-38 sequence were used to amplify a region of the corresponding gene by PCR. Two genetically defined petunia mutants harbouring unstable alleles of the $Ht1$ locus both contained an approximately 300bp insertion that hybridized to the $dTph1$ (Gerats *et al.*, 1990) transposon. These insertions were absent in closely related $Ht1$ (wild-type) plants (F. Quattrocchio and R. Koes, personal communication).

**Expression of OGR-38 in yeast**

The OGR-38 cDNA clone was cloned into the yeast expression vector pYE22m under the control of a yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (Tanaka *et al.*, 1988) (pCGP1646). An enzyme extract prepared from yeast transformed with pCGP1646 showed F3'H activity as demonstrated by conversion of naringenin to eriodictyol (Figure 5). Similar extracts of non-transformed yeast did not show any F3'H activity (data not shown). From this it was concluded that the cDNA insert from pCGP1805 (OGR-38), which was linked to the $Ht1$ locus, encoded a polypeptide having F3'H activity.

**Complementation of an $ht1$ mutant**

The hybrid petunia line Skr4 × Sw63 is homozygous recessive for the $Ht1$, $Hf1$ and $Hf2$ loci. It produces pale lilac flowers that accumulate low levels of malvidin-based

A 1.8kb transcript was detected in the VR-like ($Ht1/ht1$) flowers that contained high levels of quercetin (+). The same size transcript was detected at much lower levels in the V23-like ($ht1/ht1$) flowers that contained little or no quercetin (-). A similarly reduced level of transcript was also detected in the V23 parent petals.

(b) Hybridization with ${}^{32}$P-labelled OGR-38 fragments to total RNA isolated from petal limbs from $P.$ hybrida lines of defined genotypes. The $Ht1$ genotype for each petunia line is shown. A 1.8kb transcript was detected in $Ht1$ lines compared to little or no transcripts detected in $ht1$ lines.

(c) Hybridization with ${}^{32}$P-labelled OGR-38 fragments to total RNA isolated from a white petal with pink sectors of the line W2169 containing a transposon in the $Ht1$ locus ($ht1^m$) and from a red reverted petal from the same line where the transposon has excised ($Ht1$) along with a red petal from a wild-type control (V2079). A 2.1kb transcript is detected in the $ht1^m$ line compared to a 1.8kb transcript in the revertant petal and wild-type control.

Furthermore, there was a much reduced level of transcript detected in the petals of V23-like ($ht1/ht1$) lines which contained little or no quercetin compared to high levels of transcript detected in the petals of VR-like ($Ht1/ht1$) lines containing high levels of quercetin. A similarly reduced level of transcript was also detected in the petals of the V23 ($ht1/ht1$) parent (Figure 4a).

The level of the OGR-38 transcript was also examined in the corolla limbs of $P.$ hybrida lines with defined

pigments (due to a leaky hf1 mutation) and the 4'-hydroxylated flavonol, kaempferol (see Figure 1). It accumulates DHK as the predominant dihydroflavonol and little anthocyanin due to the low substrate specificity of the petunia DFR for DHK (Forkmann and Ruhnau, 1987). The anthers and pollen are white and accumulate the flavonol, kaempferol. The F3'H cDNA was cloned in a sense orientation behind a constitutive promoter to create pCGP1867 and then introduced into Skr4 × Sw63 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. RNA blot analysis of total RNA isolated from petal limbs revealed that 10 out of 13 independent transformants had detectable levels of the introduced F3'H transcript compared to little or none in the non-transformed control (data not shown).

The expression of the introduced F3'H gene in the Skr4 × Sw63 hybrid had a marked effect on flower colour. The transgenic plants produced pink to dark pink coloured flowers with pink anthers and pollen (Figure 6) and generally contained higher levels of anthocyanins with significantly higher levels of the 3',4'-hydroxylated anthocyanins and flavonols than the non-transgenic control. HPLC and TLC analysis of acid-hydrolysed extracts of these flower limbs revealed that peonidin (the methylated derivative of cyanidin) and quercetin (see Figure 1) were the major flavonoids produced (Table 1). The stamens with pink pollen and anthers produced by some transgenic plants also contained peonidin and quercetin, while the non-transgenic Skr4 × Sw63 control with white pollen and anthers contained kaempferol and a low level of quercetin.

The petunia hybrid Skr4 × Sw63 (ht1/ht1) was transformed with the T-DNA of pCGP1867 containing the F3'H transgene. Expression of the introduced F3'H transgene (confirmed by RNA blot analysis) led to the production of peonidin and quercetin in transgenic flowers resulting in pink flowers (transgenic) with pink anthers and pollen compared to the pale lilac Skr4 × Sw63 non-transformed control (control).

(a) Hybridization with ³²P-labelled probes of F3'H, CHS, DFR and FLS to total RNA isolated from petal limbs from five developmental stages of *P. hybrida* cv. OGR (1–5) described in the Experimental procedures and from leaf (L).

(b) Hybridization with ³²P-labelled F3'H probe to total RNA isolated from petal limbs (stage 2), leaf, sepals, roots, stems, pedicels, ovaries, stamens and styles/stigmas. The vegetative organs were from 6 to 8-week-old seedlings. The floral organs were from flowers at stages 1–2.

Since the Skr4 × Sw63 hybrid is dominant for *Gf*, *Rt*, *Mt* and *Mf* loci, the *ht1* mutation is the only lesion which prevents this line from producing 3',4'-hydroxylated anthocyanins and flavonols (such as those based on peonidin and quercetin) in the petal limb (see Figure 1). Hence, the production of these flavonoids in the transgenic flowers demonstrated that the OGR-38 cDNA can complement the *ht1* mutation indicating that *Ht1* encodes F3'H.

Expression of F3'H gene

The expression profile of the F3'H gene was examined in petunia leaves, sepals, roots, stems, peduncles, ovaries,

anthers, styles and petals from five stages of floral development (Figure 7) of OGR petunia. RNA blot analysis revealed that the F3'H probe hybridized with a 1.8 kb transcript and that this expression was highest in the early stages of flower development and declined as the corolla became fully pigmented and opened (Figure 7a). The developmental gene expression of CHS, DFR and FLS in OGR flowers is also shown as a comparison to that for the F3'H gene. The developmental gene expression was similar to that of FLS (Figure 7a) (Holton et al., 1993b). DFR and CHS expression, however, peaked at slightly later stages of flower development.

The F3'H transcript was most abundant in the petals and ovaries and was also detected in the sepals, pedicels and anthers of the OGR plant. A low level of transcript was also detected in the stems. Under the conditions used, no hybridizing transcript was detected by RNA blot analysis of total RNA isolated from leaf, style or roots (Figure 7b).

Discussion

OGR-38, a cDNA corresponding to the *Ht1* locus

In order to isolate a F3'H cDNA clone, an OGR petal limb cDNA library was screened with DNA probes corresponding to a mixture of cytochromes P450, including those involved in the modification of flavonoids such as C4H and F3'5'H. Screening of cDNA libraries with P450 sequences under low stringency conditions has been used previously to successfully isolate new and related P450 clones (Holton et al., 1993a). A number of cytochrome P450 cDNA clones were isolated using this procedure, however, three represented new P450 clones. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of the clones, OGR-38, showed high sequence identity to those of the F3'5'H cDNA clones used in the screening procedure and was shown to encode a F3'H both in an in vitro assay and an in vivo system. RFLP and RNA blot analysis provided strong evidence that this cDNA corresponds to the *Ht1* locus of petunia which

controls F3′H activity. This was verified by complementation of an *ht1* mutation with the *OGR-38* cDNA clone.

Introduction of the *OGR-38* cDNA clone into *Skr4 × Sw63* led to production of peonidin and quercetin in the petals and anthers of the transgenic flowers. Peonidin is the methylated derivative of the 3′,4′-hydroxylated anthocyanidin, cyanidin (see Figure 1). The non-transgenic *Skr4 × Sw63* control produced only kaempferol and a small amount of malvidin. Although *Skr4 × Sw63* is homozygous recessive for both the *Hf1* and *Hf2* genes, these mutations do not completely block production of F3′5′H (Stotz *et al.*, 1985) and low levels of malvidin are produced to give the petal limb a pale lilac colour. The genes *Ht1* and *Ht2* do not have an effect on the pollen colour so cyanidin, peonidin and quercetin are not normally found (Wiering and de Vlaming, 1984). Introduction of the *F3′H* cDNA clone under the control of a constitutive promoter allowed production of peonidin in the pollen giving it a pink colour that is not normally seen in petunia.

**Regulation of expression**

The *F3′H* gene is developmentally regulated in a similar manner to other flavonoid pathway genes (Beld *et al.*, 1989; van Tunen *et al.*, 1988) and its expression profile correlates with pigment accumulation. Expression of the gene is evident early in flower development when the first signs of pigmentation become visible. Transcript levels peak during the phase of elongation of the tubular corolla and then decline as the flower opens and matures. However, the *F3′H* transcript is detected and peaks at a slightly earlier stage of flower development than that of other flavonoid pathway genes such as those for CHS and DFR (see Figure 7a). The expression profile of *F3′H* is similar to that of *FLS* (Figure 7a; Holton *et al.*, 1993b) and this expression profile corresponds to the observation that FLS and F3′H enzyme activities are maximal at similar stages of floral development (Forkmann *et al.*, 1986). The *F3′H* gene expression observed by RNA blot analysis correlates with the enzyme activities observed at the different stages of floral development where F3′H activity is present in early stages of bud development, increases rapidly to a maximum in the early stages and then decreases rapidly to zero in fully opened flowers (Stotz *et al.*, 1985).

In petunia flowers of genotypes dominant for both *Fl* and *Ht1*, the amount of cyanidin produced is greatly reduced in favour of quercetin (Gerats *et al.*, 1982). This is clearly due to competition between the enzymes for flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthesis for DHQ as common substrate (Holton *et al.*, 1993b).

A large number of cytochrome P450 genes have been characterized and comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence shows that they all share some amino acid sequence conservation (Chapple, 1998; Nelson *et al.*, 1996). Both F3′H and F3′5′H are microsomal cytochromes P450 monooxygenases that perform similar hydroxylating reactions on the same substrates. In petunia, F3′H can hydroxylate DHK and naringenin at the 3′ position to produce DHQ and eriodictyol, respectively (Stotz *et al.*, 1985; Tabak *et al.*, 1978). F3′5′H is also able to hydroxylate naringenin and DHK at the 3′ and 5′ positions as well as eriodictyol and DHQ at the 5′ position to produce 5,7,3′,4′,5′-pentahydroxyflavanone and DHM, respectively (Menting *et al.*, 1994). The deduced amino acid sequences of F3′H and F3′5′H are similar, as would be expected. Early reports hypothesized that F3′H and F3′5′H enzymes evolved from C4H (an early enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway) (Stafford, 1990). However, with the isolation of a number of plant P450 clones including those representing F3′H and F3′5′H, phylogenetic analysis indicates that whilst F3′5′H and F3′H are closely related, a close phylogenetic relationship with C4H is not as well supported (Figure 3b). Alignment of a number of deduced amino acid sequences of F3′H and F3′5′H clones isolated to date (data not shown) reveals that the amino acid residues ‘GGEK’ at position 422–425 of the *OGR-38* sequence (Figure 3) are present in all F3′H sequences but not in F3′5′H sequences. The significance, if any, of the presence of this sequence has yet to be determined.

The isolation of a *F3′H* cDNA clone allows further study to aid in the identification of regions of deduced amino acids of the F3′5′H that may be essential for accommodating the DHQ or eriodictyol substrates for 5′ hydroxylation. Molecular modelling and mutagenesis studies of the F3′H and F3′5′H deduced amino acid sequences should provide further insights into the key amino acids needed for enzyme activity and substrate binding. Expression in a heterologous system such as *E. coli* or *S. cerevisiae* will allow further enzymatic studies and answer key questions such as the substrate specificities, *K*~M~ and *V*~max~ values of F3′H from petunia compared to the key flavonoid pathway enzymes that compete for the same substrates.

In petunia, *An1*, *An2*, *An11* and *An4* contain regulatory genes that control the activity of a number of genes involved in the late stages of anthocyanin biosynthesis (Quattrocchio *et al.*, 1993). Both *An1* and *An2* have been shown to control the activities of UDP-glucose: anthocyanidin-3-glucosyltransferase (3GT), SAM: anthocyanidin 3′-O-methyltransferase (3′AMT) and SAM: anthocyanidin 3′,5′-O-methyltransferase (3′5′AMT) (Gerats *et al.*, 1984, 1985; Kho *et al.*, 1978). The steady-state mRNA levels for *DFR* and *3RT* are also controlled by the *An1* and *An2* loci (Beld *et al.*, 1989; Brugliera *et al.*, 1994; Kroon *et al.*, 1994;
Quattrocchio *et al.*, 1993). An1 also controls the expression of Hf1 (Tabak *et al.*, 1981) which encodes F3′5′H (Holton *et al.*, 1993a) and the activity of the UDP glucose: anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5GT) (Jonsson *et al.*, 1984). However, Ht1 and FLS are not controlled by these regulatory genes. Petunia lines of the defined genotypes an1/Hf1 or an2/Hf1 are white and do not accumulate DHM. However, petunia lines of defined genotypes an1/Ht1 or an2/Ht1 accumulate the 3′,4′-hydroxylated flavonol, quercetin (Stotz *et al.*, 1985). The influence of the genetic loci An1 and An2 is a major difference between the F3′H and F3′5′H genes. The F3′H transcript was detected in an1/Ht1 (Ba20) and an2/Ht1 (Dla51) defined petunia lines (Figure 4b). However, F3′5′H transcripts are absent in an1 or an2 lines (data not shown) suggesting clear differences in the promoter region of these genes. Isolation of genomic clones and analysis of the promoter regions of the F3′H gene compared to F3′5′H and other flavonoid pathway genes regulated by the An1 and An2 loci will provide further insights into regulation of the flavonoid pathway. The similar petal expression profiles of F3′H and FLS genes may suggest a common regulatory mechanism. The earlier expression of F3′H and FLS appears to allow the production of 3′,4′-hydroxylated flavonols, even in the presence of F3′5′H. There is little cyanidin production in the presence of FLS even when there is no F3′5′H activity (in hf1, hf2 mutant lines), which leads to the question of whether the F3′H gene in petunia has evolved more for the production of quercetin than cyanidin.

### Experimental procedures

In general, recombinant DNA techniques were used as described by Sambrook *et al.* (1989).

#### Plant material

Plant varieties used were Petunia hybrid cv. Old Glory Red (OGR) F₁ Hybrid (Ball Seed, USA); V23 (An1, An2, Hf1, Hf2, ht1) (Wallroth *et al.*, 1986); R51 (An1, An2, hf1, hf2, Ht1) (Wallroth *et al.*, 1986); VR (V23 × R51 F₁ Hybrid); Ba20 (an1, An2, Ht1); Dla51 (An1, an2, Ht1); R18 (An1, An2, Ht1); Sd5 (An1, An2, ht1); Sw63 (An1, An2, hf1, hf2, ht1); Skr4 (An1, An2, hf1, hf2, ht1) and Skr4 × Sw63 (F₁ Hybrid).

Petals from OGR flowers were harvested at developmental stages defined as follows: stage 1: closed bud with first signs of pigmentation (< 25 mm in length); stage 2: pigmented, closed bud (25–35 mm in length); stage 3: dark red bud with emerging corolla (> 35 mm in length); stage 4: dark red opened flower pre-anther dehiscence (> 50 mm in length); stage 5: fully opened flower with all anthers dehisced. Flowers of the other varieties were harvested at a developmental stage equivalent to stage 2.

#### cDNA library construction

Total RNA was isolated from the petal tissue of P. hybrid cv OGR of stage 1–3 flowers using the method of Turpen and Griffith

(1986). Poly(A)+RNA was selected from the total RNA, using oligotex-dT™ (Qiagen).

A ZAP-cDNA Gigapack III Gold Cloning kit (Stratagene) was used to construct a directional cDNA library in λZAP using 5 μg of poly(A)+RNA isolated as described above. The total number of recombinants obtained was 2.5 × 10⁶.

After transfecting XL1-Blue MRF′ cells, the packaged cDNA mixture was plated at 50 000 pfu per 15 cm diameter plate. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 8 h, and the phages were eluted in Phage Storage Buffer (Sambrook *et al.*, 1989).

One hundred thousand pfu of the amplified library were plated onto NZY plates (Sambrook *et al.*, 1989) at a density of 10 000 pfu per 15 cm plate after transfecting XL1-Blue MRF′ cells, and incubated at 37°C for 8 h. After incubation at 4°C overnight, duplicate lifts were taken onto Colony/Plaque Screen™ filters (Dupont) and treated as recommended by the manufacturer.

#### Screening of the OGR library

Prior to hybridization, the duplicate lifts were washed with agitation in solutions of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sarcosine at 65°C for 30 min; followed by 0.4 M NaOH at 65°C for 30 min; and then 0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65°C for 30 min and with a final rinse in 2× SSC, 1.0% (w/v) SDS.

Hybridization conditions included a pre-hybridization step in 10% (v/v) formamide, 1 M NaCl, 10% (w/v) dextran sulphate, 1% (w/v) SDS at 42°C for at least 1 h. ³²P-labelled fragments of the coding regions of a petunia C4H cDNA clone (see below), Hf1 cDNA clone (Holton *et al.*, 1993a), Hf2 cDNA clone (Holton *et al.*, 1993a) and a 651 cDNA clone (see below) (each at 1 × 10⁶ cpm ml⁻¹) were then added to the hybridization solution and hybridization was continued at 42°C for a further 16 h. The filters were then washed in 2× SSC, 1% (w/v) SDS at 42°C for 2×1 h and exposed to Kodak XAR film with an intensifying screen at –70°C for 16 h.

#### Isolation of probes

Cytochromes P450 cDNA clones from petunia. A number of cytochrome P450 cDNA clones were isolated in the screening process used to isolate the two flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase cDNA clones corresponding to the Hf1 or Hf2 loci (Holton *et al.*, 1993a). One of these cDNA clones (F1) (contained in pCGP161) was identified as representing a cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), based on sequence identity with a previously characterized C4H clone from mung bean (Mizutani *et al.*, 1993). Another clone used in the screening process was a P450 cDNA clone named 651 contained in pCGP619. Isolation of CHS and DFR cDNA clones has been described previously by Brugliera *et al.* (1994). The isolation of the FLS cDNA clone is described in Holton *et al.* (1993b).

#### DNA sequencing

The complete sequence of the OGR-38 cDNA clone was determined by compilation of sequence from different pUC18 sub-clones obtained using standard procedures for the generation of randomly overlapping clones (Sambrook *et al.*, 1989). Sequencing was carried out using dye-primer cycle sequencing kits (Perkin-Elmer) and reactions were run on an Automated 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

Homology searches against GenBank, SWISS-PROT and EMBL databases were performed using the LFASTA, FASTA and

450 Filippa Brugliera et al.

TFASTA programs (Pearson and Lipman, 1988). Multiple sequence alignments and bootstrap trees were produced using ClustalW (Thompson *et al.*, 1994) and njplot (mgouy@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr), respectively.

**DNA and RNA blot analysis**

Total RNA was isolated using a Plant RNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was isolated as described in Brugliera *et al.* (1994). DNA and RNA blot analysis were performed as described by Brugliera *et al.* (1994). In general, 20 μg of total RNA was loaded for each RNA blot.

**Complementation experiments**

Plasmid pCGP1867 was constructed by cloning the cDNA insert from pCGP1805 in a 'sense' orientation behind the Mac promoter of the binary vector pCGP293 (Brugliera *et al.*, 1994). The Mac promoter is a hybrid promoter consisting of the mas promoter and a CaMV 35S enhancer region (Comai *et al.*, 1990). A Xbal/KpnI fragment containing the OGR-38cDNA insert from pCGP1805 was ligated with Xbal/KpnI ends of the pCGP293 binary vector to produce pCGP1867. Correct insertion of the fragment in pCGP1867 was established by Xbal/KpnI restriction enzyme analysis of DNA isolated from gentamycin-resistant transformants. The plasmid pCGP1867 was introduced into the *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* strain AGL0 (Lazo *et al.*, 1991) essentially as described by An *et al.* (1988). Petunia transformations were performed essentially as described by Horsch *et al.* (1985). HPLC analysis and TLC analysis were performed as described in Brugliera *et al.* (1994).

**Yeast expression**

The plasmid pCGP1646 was constructed by cloning the cDNA insert from pCGP1805 in a 'sense' orientation behind the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter of pYE22m (Tanaka *et al.*, 1988). The yeast strain G-1315 (*Mat a*, *trp1*) (Ashikari *et al.*, 1989) was transformed with pCGP1646 according to Ito *et al.* (1983). The transformants were selected by their ability to restore G-1315 to tryptophan prototrophy.

Preparation of yeast extracts for assay of F3′H activity has been described previously by Holton *et al.* (1993b). F3′H enzyme activity was measured using a modified version of the method described by Stotz and Forkmann (1982) using [³H]-naringenin as substrate. The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography and identified by comparison to radioactive naringenin and non-radioactive eriodictyol standards, which were run alongside the reaction products on a TLC and visualized under UV light.
