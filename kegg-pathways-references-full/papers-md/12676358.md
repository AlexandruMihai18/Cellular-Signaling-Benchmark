### Abstract

The 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist 8-hydroxy-2 (di-*n*-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) causes inhibition of caspase-3 and apoptosis via the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in hippocampal HN2–5 cells. Two 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonists, Repinotan hydrochloride (BAY x 3702) and 8-OH-DPAT, block caspase-3 activation and apoptosis caused by anoxia/reoxygenation and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. This is reversed upon transient expression of dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) and Raf-1 (Raf301), confirming the involvement of Ras and Raf-1 in this 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-R → ERK1/2 → caspase-3 pathway. A selective inhibitor of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) (U73122) but not a general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (GFX) reversed the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-R-mediated ERK1/2 stimulation. However, both GFX and the PKCα and PKCβ<sub>1</sub> inhibitor Gö6976 reversed the ERK1/2-mediated inhibition of caspase-3. ERK-dependent activation of only PKCα was observed in immunoprecipitates obtained from 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist-treated HN2–5 cells. Finally, transient expression of kinase-negative PKCα eliminated the 8-OH-DPAT-evoked block on the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-triggered caspase-3 stimulation, establishing PKCα as a link between ERK and caspase-3 (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-R → PLC → ERK1/2 → PKCα → caspase-3). Our results elucidate a novel yet general, neuroprotective pathway through which G protein-coupled receptors could cause inhibition of effector caspases, such as caspase-3.

### 1. Introduction

The heptahelical, serotonin 1A receptor couples mainly to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins, such as G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>o</sub> [1,2]. Among these interactions, the most extensively studied signaling is in the inhibition of adenylate cyclase through G<sub>i</sub> [3,4]. In addition, agonist binding to this receptor causes inhibition of N-type Ca-channels and activation of phospholipase C through distinct pools of G proteins [5,6].

More recently, the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor has been shown to couple to G<sub>z</sub> in Sf9 cells [7]. Serotonin 1A-receptor coupling to such variety of G proteins, however, has a common denominator—in all these receptor–G protein interactions, the G protein βγ complex is always released, which can then activate multiple effector molecules or pathways, such as the phospholipase Cβ → ERK1/2 pathway or the PI-3 kinase (PI-3K) pathway [8–11]. By contrast, the G protein α subunits faithfully couple to one effector molecule—e.g. G<sub>αi</sub> couples negatively to adenylate cyclase and G<sub>αs</sub> couples positively to adenylate cyclase and G<sub>αq</sub> couples positively to PLCβ.

As discussed earlier, in various cell types including neurons, agonist-stimulated release of the G protein βγ complex results in the activation of ERK1/2 enzymes, which are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family [10–12]. In this pathway, termed MAP kinase pathway, activation of multiple signaling proteins could precede the stimulation of the key enzymes ERK1/2, which finally regulates many important cellular events, such as mitosis or survival. Our earlier studies have demonstrated

that agonist stimulation of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor causes up-
regulation of the MAP kinase pathway, which results in an
inhibition of the proapoptotic, cysteinyI aspartate-specific
protease, caspase-3 [13].
Mitochondrial impairment caused by diverse types of
tissue insults leads to apoptosis through a generally accepted
pathway, which involves the release of cytochrome c from
the impaired mitochondria, its association with the apopto-
sis-activating factor Apaf-1 and caspase-9, and subsequent
partial activation of caspase-9 [14–17]. The partially acti-
vated caspase-9 undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to yield
fully active caspase-9, which proteolytically activates the
downstream caspase, caspase-3. Therefore, inhibition of this
post-mitochondrial pathway is expected to cause attenuation
of apoptosis caused by diverse conditions, such as anoxia/
reoxygenation, neurodegenerative diseases, or excitotoxicity
triggered by various conditions of neuronal injury, all of
which are known to work through mitochondrial impair-
ment. Earlier studies have shown that signaling from growth
factor receptors can cause inhibition of apoptosis through
PI-3K-mediated activation of Akt, which exerts its kinase
activity to inhibit either the proapoptotic mitochondrial
protein Bad [17] or the proapoptotic protease caspase-9
[16]. By contrast, our previous studies have shown that a G
protein-coupled receptor, the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor, causes inhib-
ition of caspase-3 and apoptosis by stimulating a novel, PI-
3K-independent pathway in the hippocampal neuron-
derived HN2–5 cells [11].
As mentioned earlier, in the circuitry of such complex
mechanisms, caspase-3 is clearly the common downstream
protease that has to be somehow inhibited to cause suppres-
sion of apoptosis. Since many conditions of neural insult and
degeneration culminate in the activation of caspase-3, the 5-
HT<sub>1A</sub>-R-mediated inhibition of caspase-3 could be used as a
general tool to prevent neuronal apoptosis. This study estab-
lishes PKCα as a novel link between the MAP kinase path-
way and caspase-3 and also introduces a measurable effect
(readout), such as the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-evoked caspase-3
inhibition. Such a readout could also be used to study the
connectivity and hierarchy of the upstream members of the G
protein-coupled receptor-activated MAPK cascade, such as
the kinases like Src or Pyk2, which often connect G protein-
coupled receptors to the MAPK pathway.

DEVD-(amino-4-methylcoumarin) (AcDEVD-AMC), the
caspase inhibitor, acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde (AcDEVD-
CHO) as well as PTX, WAY100635, and 8-OH-DPAT were
obtained from Sigma/RBI. bis-indolylmaleimide I (GFX),
Gö6976, U73122 (a PLCβ inhibitor) and PD98059 (an
MEK inhibitor) were obtained from Calbiochem (CA).
Repinotan hydrochloride (BAY x 3702) was obtained from
Bayer Corporation (CT). PBS denotes phosphate-buffered
saline.

### 2.1. Cell culture and anoxia

The mouse hippocampal neuron-derived HN2–5 cells
were cultured to about 70–80% confluence in DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-strepto-
mycin in poly-L-lysine-coated plates and then differentiated
by 16 h (overnight) treatment with either phosphate-free
Krebs–Ringer buffer (KRB) (25 mM HEPES, 20 mM
glucose, 5 mM KCl, 1.28 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) or 5 μM retinoic acid in DMEM
containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Both processes
confer to the cells neuronal morphology and strong immu-
noreactivity to the neurofilament protein-antibody SMI33
[18]. For both MAPK as well as caspase assays, cells in 10
cm plates were used. Following differentiation, the medium
was changed to serum-free DMEM, supplemented with
drugs (8-OH-DPAT, BAY x 3702, antagonists, inhibitors,
etc.), and then, for caspase assays, the cells were subjected
to anoxia as described in our previous report [11]. Prior to
caspase assays, differentiated HN2–5 cells were subjected
to 6 h anoxia followed by 16 h of reoxygenation.

### 2.2. MAPK assays

For MAP kinase (ERK2) assays, confluent, 10 cm plates
of HN2–5 cells were differentiated overnight in KRB, the
medium changed to serum-free DMEM followed by drug
treatment as described in the figure legends, medium aspi-
rated and cells lysed in RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1%
NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mM
Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> plus freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail;
Boehringer), immunoprecipitated using 1 μg/ml of MAPK
(ERK2) antibody (polyclonal, Santa Cruz) and protein A-
sepharose, immunoprecipitate resolved on a 7–16% gra-
dient acrylamide gel, proteins transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane, blocked in 5% solution of dry milk and then
probed using a monoclonal, phospho-MAPK (P-MAPK)
specific (anti-active) antibody at 1:1000 dilution and then
with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG
(1:1000). Following probing with P-MAPK antibody, the
blot was stripped by incubating for 1 h at room temperature
in 0.2 M glycine (pH 2.5), and then blocked in 5% dry milk
and reprobed with ERK2 antibody (1:500). The ERK2
bands were used for normalization to confirm that the
increase in P-MAPK bands was not due to an increase in
the amount of ERK2 protein.

## 2. Materials and methods

The anti-active MAPK antibody was obtained from New
England Biolabs (MA), and the ERK2 and other antibo-
dies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA).
The vectors pZipneo, pZipneoN17Ras and pNMC,
pNMCRaf301 were obtained as kind gifts from D. Foster
(Hunter College, CUNY) and S. Gutkind (NIH), respec-
tively. In immunoblotting analysis, the protein bands were
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Super
Signal kit from Pierce (IL). The caspase substrate, acetyl-
2.3. HOECHST 33342 staining to assess apoptosis

Controlled treatment of cells with the membrane-permeable dye HOECHST 33342 has been shown to effectively stain apoptotic nuclei and detect chromatin condensation [19,20]. HN2–5 cells were transfected with control vectors (pZipneo and pNMC) and those harboring the dominant negative mutants of Ras (N17Ras) and Raf-1 (Raf 301), differentiated, treated with the agonist, and then subjected to hypoxia and reoxygenation. Following this the cells were fixed and permeabilized and then assessed for chromatin condensation and disintegration of the nucleus by Hoechst staining [19]. A 1 μM concentration of HOECHST 33342 was used to label the cells for 15 min, following which the dye was washed out with 10 mM PBS and then pictures shot using a 360 nm excitation/420 nm emission filter. The apoptotic cells were identified by their disintegrated nuclear structure and counted to assess the proportion of healthy and apoptotic cells in multiple fields.

2.4. Caspase-3 assay using a fluorescent substrate

Caspase assays were performed using monolayers of HN2–5 cells at 80% confluence. Cell lysates were prepared from hydrogen peroxide-treated or normoxic and anoxic cell pellets obtained after two washes with ice-cold PBS. Cells were next lysed in 0.5 ml Yama buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 142 nM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% NP-40, 0.1 mM PMSF) [21]. Each sample was homogenized with a Potter Elvehjem homogenizer and then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant obtained was assayed for protein concentration, which was adjusted to 2 μg/μl and then an aliquot containing 300 μg protein was added to each well of a 96-well plate. This was followed by the addition of 1.5 μl of 10 mM stock AcDEVD-AMC in oxygen-free water (final concentration, 100 μM). The released fluorescence (due to the fluorescent group, AMC, which is cleaved by the caspases) was monitored after 30-min incubation using a fluorescence plate reader set at excitation wavelength 360 nm and emission wavelength 460 nm. Results from multiple caspase assays, each performed with triplicate samples, were combined after conversion into percentage of control caspase activity. Statistical analysis and determination of *P* values were carried out using Student’s *t*-test.

2.5. Protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme assays

Differentiated HN2–5 cells were treated for 30 min with 1 μM phorbol-myristate (PMA—a positive control), carrier or 1 μM 8-OH-DPAT in the absence and presence of 25 μM PD98059, following which the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer as described in MAPK assays. PKCα and PKCβ were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using the respective antibodies (Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitates were washed thoroughly, and then resuspended in 10 μl

PKC dilution buffer as provided in the Pierce PKC Assay Kit. This suspension was supplemented on ice with 15 μl of a pre-mixed reaction mixture containing equal volumes of 5× reaction buffer, 5× activator solution (sonicated in a bath sonicator prior to addition), PKC substrate which also contained 5 μCi/tube of AT[γ-32P]. The final volume with the protein A-sepharose beads was 30 μl. The tubes were vortexed and then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by microcentrifugation and transfer of 25 μl of the supernatant to SpinZyme columns. The columns were microcentrifuged to elute the aqueous phase. The non-phosphorylated peptide was next washed off by addition of 250 μl of Phosphopeptide Binding Buffer (provided in the kit), incubation for 3 min, followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 6000 rpm. This procedure was repeated once for a total wash of 500 μl, and then the column was placed in a fresh tube before elution of the phosphopeptide adhering to the column. For the elution, 250 μl of Phosphopeptide Elution Buffer (provided in the kit) was applied to the column, followed by incubation for 3 min and centrifugal elution. This process was repeated once to obtain a total elution volume of 500 μl. Next, 20 μl of each eluate was mixed with 3 ml of scintillation fluid and subjected to scintillation counting using a Beckman scintillation counter.

2.6. Transfection of PKCα vectors and pEGFPCL into HN2–5 cells

pEGFPCL (2 μg) alone or 1 μg each of pEGFPCL and SRDpkcαKN or pEGFPCL and SRDpkcαWT were cotransfected into HN2–5 cells in 24-well plates [22,23]. Transfection was carried out using the SuperFect Transfection kit from Qiagen Inc., optimized for transfection of HN2–5 cells in 24-well plate without pre-plating. The cells (1 × 10⁵ per well) were allowed to settle and attach in the wells for 5 h with the transfection complex containing 2 μg of total DNA and 5 μl of SuperFect reagent. Medium was then changed to the normal growth medium (10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in DMEM) and cells were allowed to recover for 19–24 h before differentiation. Differentiation was carried out in 5 μM retinoic acid in 1% fetal bovine serum containing DMEM for 24 h, following which the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM and appropriate wells were treated with carrier or 8-OH-DPAT in the absence or presence of 25 μM PD98059. H₂O₂ (200 μM) was added and the cells were incubated for 16 h in a tissue culture incubator as described in the following section.

2.7. Hydrogen peroxide treatment and caspase assays of cells

In all experiments, differentiated HN2–5 cells were used. Hydrogen peroxide was added from a freshly diluted and sterile filtered stock solution in serum-free DMEM. Typically, hydrogen peroxide treatment was carried out for 16 h before analyzing caspase-3 activity using either a fluores-

cent substrate (as discussed above) or immunocytochemistry. For the fluorescent substrate-based assays, HN2–5 cells grown in 10 cm plates to 70–80% confluence were differentiated and then subjected to H₂O₂ treatment in serum-free DMEM. Subsequently, the cells were pelleted down and subjected to caspase assays as described above.

### 2.8. Immunostaining to assess caspase-3 activation

In experiments requiring immunostaining, the cells were grown in 24-well plates, transfected as described above, differentiated, and then subjected to 200 μM hydrogen peroxide treatment for 16 h. Subsequently, the cells were fixed in freshly prepared 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed two times with PBS, and then blocked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V), 2% normal goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the blocking solution was replaced with 1° antibody (CM1) diluted 1:3000 in blocking solution. After overnight treatment at 4 °C, the cells were washed three times with wash buffer (0.2% Tween-20 in PBS) at room temperature and then incubated with the 2° antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 568) (1:2500) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with the wash buffer and then once with PBS, the cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using filters with emission wavelengths of 580 nm (for Alexa Fluor 568) and 510 nm (for green fluorescent protein).

### 2.9. Statistical analysis

After comparing multiple data sets, results were obtained as average (± S.D.), and “P” values were obtained using Student’s t-test.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. The peak of 5-HT₁A-R-mediated activation of ERK1/2 occurs after 30 min of treatment with 100 nm BAY x 3702

Our earlier studies had established the time of optimal activation of ERK1/2 in 8-OH-DPAT-treated HN2–5 cells.

Similar analysis of BAY x 3702-elicited ERK1/2 activation revealed a prominent increase in 5 min of agonist treatment, however, as observed for 8-OH-DPAT, the BAY x 3702-elicited ERK1/2 stimulation also reached a maximum in 30 min. However, following this, it decreased dramatically to virtually basal levels in 3 h (Fig. 1a and b). This is different from the prolonged activation of ERK observed in 8-OH-DPAT-treated HN2–5 cells [11] and could be attributed to the lesser chemical stability of BAY x 3702 in aqueous solutions. Dose-response analysis revealed that BAY x 3702-triggered ERK1/2 activation was quite significant even at 1 nM agonist concentration (Fig. 1c). Similar to the dose-response curve of 8-OH-DPAT, the ERK1/2 stimulation reached a maximum at 100 nM BAY x 3702 and then remained unchanged up to at least 1 μM.

The 5-HT₁A-R-mediated ERK1/2 stimulation was not affected by the PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 2a, lane 5) but was eliminated in the presence of PD98059 (Fig. 2a, lane 6), which inhibits MEK, the factor immediately upstream of ERK1/2 in the MAP kinase pathway [24,25]. This is an important difference from the protective pathways stimulated by other G protein-coupled receptors, which have been shown to involve PI-3K [25]. The non-involvement of PI-3K and the involvement of ERK1/2 in the 5-HT₁A-R-mediated inhibition of apoptosis had also been observed in our earlier studies [11].

Agonist stimulation of the 5-HT₁A receptor also causes a simultaneous increase in intracellular inositol phosphates, which is a direct measure of PLC activity [11]. Thus, there was a possibility that this increased PLC activity was essential for the observed activation of ERK1/2, and this is supported by earlier studies confirming that ERK stimulation by other G protein-coupled receptors requires activation of PLCβ upstream of Ras [12]. Elimination of the 5-HT₁A-R mediated activation of both ERK1/2 (Fig. 2a) and inhibition of caspase-3 (Fig. 2b and c) by the PLCβ inhibitor U73122 confirmed the involvement of PLCβ upstream of ERK1/2 [12]. Activation of PLC results in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, which causes activation of PKC. PKC is known to phosphorylate and activate the signaling protein Raf-1, which stimulates ERK1/2 via the signaling protein MEK [24]. Therefore, a PKC isozyme could relay the signal from the activated

Fig. 2. The 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist-activated MAPK pathway causes a PKC-dependent caspase-3 inhibition, but PKC is not involved in the activation of ERK1/2. Differentiated HN2–5 cells were treated for 30 min with carrier or 8-OH-DPAT (1 μM) (D) or BAY x 3702 (1 μM) (B) in the absence and presence of GFX (2 μM) (GFX), or PD98059 (25 μM) (PD), WAY100635 (1 μM) (WAY), or U73122 (1 μM) (U). (a) Differentiated HN2–5 cells were treated for 30 min with either carrier (lane 1), or 8-OH-DPAT (1 μM) (lane 2), or BAY x 3702 (1 μM) in the absence (lane 3) or presence of WAY100635 (1 μM) (lane 4), wortmannin (0.1 μM) (lane 5), PD98059 (25 μM) (lane 6), GFX (lane 7), or U73122 (1 μM) (lane 8). In a separate set, the cells were treated with 1 μM U73122 alone (lane 9). Next, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an ERK1/2 antibody followed by Western blotting using an anti-active ERK1/2 antibody. In a separate set of experiments, cells were subjected to 6 h hypoxia and 16 h reoxygenation, following which cell lysates were either (b) subjected to caspase assay or (c) analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-active caspase-3 antibody (CM1). Decreased presence of the 17 kDa fragment of active caspase-3 indicates inhibition of caspase-3 activity. Data presented (a) are the mean (± S.D.) of three independent experiments performed with triplicate samples. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Normalized intensities of bands shown in (a) and (b) are graphically shown.

phospholipase molecule to ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 2a, GFX (2 μM) did not affect the BAY x 3702-evoked ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2a, lane 7). However, as shown in Fig. 2b and c, GFX did indeed block signaling downstream of ERK1/2 where PKC could be involved (explained below). Results presented in Fig. 2a elucidate that the cytoprotective, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-mediated activation of ERK1/2 occurs not through a PKC–Raf-1 pathway, but most probably through a Ras → Raf-1 → MEK → ERK1/2 cascade as reported earlier for the same receptor in non-neural cells [10].

Although data presented in Fig. 1 demonstrate that BAY x 3702 causes ERK1/2 activation in HN2–5 cells, it was essential to test if BAY x 3702 affords ERK1/2-mediated caspase-3 inhibition as 8-OH-DPAT does in HN2–5 cells [11]. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, BAY x 3702 was even more effective than 8-OH-DPAT in causing an ERK1/2-dependent inhibition of caspase-3 in HN2–5 cells. Caspase-3 levels were assessed by enzyme assays (Fig. 2b), as well as immunoblotting using the CM1 antibody (IDUN, CA), which recognizes only the 17 kDa fragment of proteolyzed and activated caspase-3 (Fig. 2c). We also asked if PKC was

involved downstream of ERK1/2 in this cytoprotective pathway. Although the broad-range PKC-inhibitor GFX eliminated the BAY x 3702-elicited suppression of caspase-3 (Fig. 2b and c), as shown Fig. 2a (lane 7), the same concentration of GFX (2 μM) did not affect the BAY x 3702-evoked ERK1/2 activation. Therefore, our results collectively show that, unlike PLCβ, which is involved upstream of ERK1/2, PKC is involved downstream of ERK1/2 in the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist-triggered inhibition of caspase-3 in HN2–5 cells.

### 3.2. Involvement of Ras and Raf-1 in serotonin 1A receptor-mediated protection of HN2–5 cells against anoxia-triggered apoptosis

Our previous studies had established that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-mediated activation of ERK1/2 is an obligate step in the protection of HN2–5 cells from anoxia and reoxygenation [11]. However, the link between the G protein-coupled, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor and ERK1/2 was not clear. One possibility was that the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor was connected to MEK and ERK1/2 through the growth factor pathway, i.e., through Ras and Raf-1. However, since direct activation of Raf-1 through phosphorylation by receptor-activated PKC (and Ras-independent activation of ERK1/2, thereafter) has been reported [20], we sought to test the involvement of Ras in the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-mediated protection of HN2–5 cells by selectively inhibiting Ras and Raf-1 activity through transient expression of the corresponding dominant inhibitory mutants, N17Ras and Raf301, respectively. By cotransfecting pEGFP, which encodes a photoenhanced mutant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), approximately 60–80% transfection efficiency was recorded. Additionally, it was observed that transfection of a relatively large amount (~20 μg/10<sup>7</sup> cells) of plasmid encoding N17Ras (pZip-neoN17Ras) or Raf301 (pNMCRaf301) killed all cells within 3–5 days. Both of these observations confirmed that the transfection efficiency was high enough for the recording of a downstream effect after partially inhibiting Ras and Raf-1 in the HN2–5 cells by using lower amounts (10 μg) of these plasmids.

Control transfection was achieved using the vectors without the insert cDNAs (pZipneo and pNMC), and 10 μg of each plasmid DNA along with 10 μg of pEGFP were transfected into 10<sup>7</sup> HN2–5 cells by electroporation. Our assays were performed 96 h after transfection by electroporation at 220 V and 1000 μF in serum-free DMEM, when the maximum recovery of cells was observed. Additionally, the transfected and post-differentiation HN2–5 cells were more fragile to anoxia and reoxygenation than the untransfected but post-differentiation HN2–5 cells. Thus, in contrast to only 20–30% of apoptosis in the untransfected HN2–5 cells, about 50–80% apoptosis was observed in the transfected HN2–5 cells. In the control cells (transfected with pZipneo and pNMC), apoptosis was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by BAY x 3702 (Fig. 3a and b). This BAY x 3702-evoked protection was completely eliminated in the presence of either N17Ras (Fig. 3a) or Raf301 (Fig. 3b), thus confirming the involvement of Ras and Raf-1 in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist-evoked protection of anoxic HN2–5 cells.

### 3.3. A calcium-dependent PKC isozyme is involved in the ERK1/2-mediated inhibition of caspase-3

Since agonist-stimulated PLCβ activity results in IP<sub>3</sub> synthesis, which eventually causes calcium release from the ER, we postulated that intracellular calcium might play an important role in the transmission of the ERK signal to caspase-3. To test this hypothesis, we investigated if the PKC isozyme involved was either of the calcium-sensitive molecules, PKCα or PKCβ, by using a selective inhibitor of PKCα and PKCβ<sub>1</sub> (Gö6976, Calbiochem). It was observed that even as little as 1–5 nM

HN2–5 cells, transfected with (a) pZipneo or pZipneo-N17Ras or (b) pNMC or pNMC-Raf-301, were differentiated and then treated with carrier or the agonist (BAY x 3702) in the absence and presence of WAY100635 (1 μM), and then subjected to 6 h hypoxia and 16 h reoxygenation. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized and stained with HOECHST33342 to assess cell viability by fluorescence microscopy.

concentration of G6976 completely reversed the 5-HT1A
receptor-mediated inhibition of the anoxia-induced cas-
pase-3 activity, and this effect was observed using both 8-
OH-DPAT (Fig. 4a) as well as BAY x 3702 (Fig. 4b) as
agonist. Therefore, the 5-HT1A-R-mediated caspase-3
inhibition involved a calcium-dependent PKC, probably
PKCa or PKCb.

### 3.4. PKCa but not PKCb is stimulated downstream of
ERK1/2

Although the above experiments demonstrate that acti-
vation of a calcium-sensitive PKC is essential for the ERK1/
2-mediated inhibition of caspase-3, the suppression of
caspase-3 could still be due to synergistic action of the
activated forms of PKC and ERK1/2 (Fig. 5, mechanism 2).
In fact classical G protein coupled receptor pathways show
that stimulation of PLCβ by the receptor-activated G protein
results in the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) by PLC-
catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphoinositide-bis-phosphate.
DAG is a potent activator of PKC. Thus, it was possible
that PKC was activated in a parallel pathway by the ligand-
bound 5-HT1A receptor. Following this, both PKC and
MAPK could act together in a synergistic manner on a
downstream target to finally cause inhibition of caspase-3
(Fig. 5, mechanism 2). Such synergism between activated
PKC and ERK1/2 would preclude activation of PKC by
ERK1/2.

The next experiment was designed to test the possibility
described above and also to identify the PKC isozyme
involved in this 5-HT1A-R-mediated caspase-3 inhibition.
To achieve this, we immunoprecipitated two typical, cal-
cium-dependent PKC isozymes, PKCa and PKCb, from the
lysates of 5-HT1A-agonist-stimulated and control HN2–5
cells. These immunoprecipitates were next tested for PKC
activity using a PKC-assay kit (Pierce) and an MBP peptide
as substrate. Agonist (8-OH-DPAT) stimulation of the cells
caused a dramatic stimulation of PKCa but not PKCb (Fig.
6). Moreover, this 5-HT1A agonist-evoked activation of

PKCa was eliminated in the presence of the selective
inhibitor of the MAPK pathway PD98059 (Fig. 6). Thus,
PKCa is likely to be the isozyme involved in the 5-HT1A-R-
mediated signaling to caspase-3. Also, PKC is not activated
in a parallel pathway; rather, it is downstream of the 5-
HT1A-R-ERK1/2 pathway, such that blocking ERK1/2 acti-
vation could eliminate the stimulation of PKCa (Fig. 5,
mechanism 1).

Fig. 6. A 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist causes MAPK-dependent stimulation of PKCα but not PKCβ. Differentiated HN2–5 cells were treated with either PMA (1 μM) or 8-OH-DPAT (1 μM) in the absence and presence of PD98059 for 30 min. Next, the cells were lysed and PKCα and PKCβ immunoprecipitated successively from the lysates. The washed immunoprecipitates were subjected to PKC enzyme assay. The experiment was carried out two times with quadruplicate samples (*P* < 0.0005).

pretreatment of the differentiated HN2–5 cells attenuated this caspase-3 activity by 40% (Fig. 7b). Also, this caspase-3 inhibition was eliminated upon inhibition of the MAPK pathway with PD98059 (PD), or inhibition of PKC with GFX (Fig. 7b). Therefore, it is possible that 8-OH-DPAT-evoked caspase-3 inhibition in anoxia/reoxygenation as well as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treatment occurs through a ERK1/2 and PKC-dependent pathway as shown in Fig. 5 (mechanism 1).

### 3.4. A kinase negative mutant of PKCα reverses the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-mediated blockage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-triggered caspase-3 activation

To confirm that the observed 8-OH-DPAT-evoked check on the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-triggered caspase-3 activation specifically required PKCα, we performed transient expression of a kinase-negative mutant of PKCα in the HN2–5 cells (Fig. 8). The GFP was cotransfected to identify the transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. After transfection, the cells were differentiated as in the previous experiments and then subjected to 200 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment for 16 h followed by fixing of cells, and immunostaining using the same anti-active caspase-3 (CM1) antibody as used for Western blotting in an earlier experiment (Fig. 2c). Unlike the enzyme assays for caspase-3 presented earlier, immunostaining does not give a quantitative representation of caspase-3 activity. So, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration was adjusted to 200 μM (instead of 500 μM) to obtain a greater number of cells at the initial stages of caspase-3 activation. This procedure allowed us to carry out an effective analysis of the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on caspase-3 activation in the HN2–5 cells. Representative images show punctate anti-active caspase-3 staining (red) in the perinuclear regions, which indicates proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 following secretion of cytochrome *c* and Apaf1 from the mitochondria (Fig. 8a).

This was followed by addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from a stock solution in serum-free DMEM to the indicated concentrations. Next, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and then lysed for caspase assay. Each bar presented is the mean (± S.D.) of triplicate samples. Although the same overall profile of caspase activity was observed in at least 10 independent experiments, the magnitude of 0.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-evoked activation of caspase activity varied between two- and eight-fold of the carrier-treated cells.

**Fig. 8.** The 8-OH-DPAT evoked inhibition of caspase-3 is reversed in the presence of a kinase negative mutant (KN) of PKCα. HN2–5 cells grown in duplicate wells were cotransfected with pEGFP in the presence of either SRDpkcα(KN) (expressing kinase negative PKCα) or SRDpkcαWT (expressing wild-type PKCα). A control set of cells received pEGFP alone. Transfected cells were differentiated and then treated with 200 μM H₂O₂ for 16 h followed by fixing and staining with anti-active caspase-3 antibody (CM1) and an Alexa Fluor 568-labeled 2° antibody (red staining). Activation of caspase-3 was assessed from the proportion of GFP cells (green) that also showed red staining. (a) Representative images show punctate anti-active caspase-3 staining (red) in the perinuclear regions, which indicates proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3. Reduced caspase-3 activity appears as low-intensity, diffused, red color. (b) Data obtained represent three independent experiments, each performed with duplicate wells in which cells were counted in six fields. In the three experiments, the 8-OH-DPAT-evoked decrease in anti-active caspase-3 stained cells varied between 30% and 50% of carrier-treated in the GFP- and pkcαWT-transfected cells.

reduced caspase-3 activity, visible only as a faint, diffused, red staining were considered to be negative in terms of caspase-3 activation. It should be noted from our caspase-3 assays that caspase-3 activation is inhibited but not completely eliminated in the presence of 8-OH-DPAT. While cells transfected with GFP alone or GFP plus SRDpkcαWT showed the expected inhibition of CM1 antibody staining upon 8-OH-DPAT pretreatment (red), cells cotransfected with the kinase-negative mutant of PKCα (SRDpkcαKN)

showed complete reversal of this 8-OH-DPAT-evoked attenuation of anti-active caspase-3 staining (Fig. 8b). Such elimination of 8-OH-DPAT-evoked suppression of caspase-3 was also observed in cells pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Data obtained from this study and that shown in Fig. 7 confirmed that the general, 5-HT₁A-R-mediated protective pathway observed in the HN2–5 cells indeed involved PKCα downstream of ERK1/2 as proposed earlier in Fig. 5 (mechanism 1).

4. Discussion

Apoptosis is an important event that is essential for embryonic development as well as efficient removal of irreversibly damaged cells. This signaling program has been studied extensively in blood cells, and as a result, major biochemical mechanisms for the apoptotic program have been established. Simultaneously, research on growth factors has revealed the existence of a receptor tyrosine kinase-activated PI-3K pathway, which eventually causes inhibition of this apoptotic programming, such that some the partially injured cells can be revived [15, 16]. This is particularly important in the central nervous system, since, typically, after a stroke or neuronal injury caused by other insults, delayed death of a large number of neurons is observed, which often results in the loss of cognitive and motor functions. Additionally, during embryonic development, a large number of pre-neuronal cells undergo apoptosis to promote survival of neurons that have already made synaptic connections. Beneficial effects of apoptosis are also observed when chemotherapeutic agents eliminate cancer cells.

Receptor-mediated regulation of apoptosis could serve as an effective way of protecting brain neurons after a stroke or brain injury. As is true for the PI-3 kinase pathway, the MAP kinase cascade, which is stimulated by the growth factor receptors, is also linked to the protection of various cell types against apoptosis. Intriguingly, the isoforms ERK1/2 and p38 of MAPK that are stimulated at the end of the MAPK pathway have been linked to the inhibition and promotion of apoptosis, respectively [27]. Although earlier studies have demonstrated the importance of the MAPK pathway in protection against apoptosis [27, 28], molecular events connecting this pathway to apoptosis are not clear. Results presented here provide a direct demonstration of MAPK-dependent inhibition of an enzyme, caspase-3, which actually causes the signature cytoskeletal breakdown that defines apoptosis.

Our studies in the hippocampal neuron-derived cell line HN2–5 has revealed a novel link between the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor and the proapoptotic enzyme caspase-3 through the important enzyme PKCα. It had been reported by multiple research teams that inhibition of PKC with either staurosporine or PKCα-targeted ribozyme causes apoptosis [29, 30]. If PKCα is indeed a downstream target of ERK1/2, then the activity of this protein should be regulated by ERK1/2. Our immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that 8-OH-DPAT treatment of HN2–5 cells indeed causes activation of PKCα via ERK1/2 (Fig. 6). If this occurs by direct ERK1/2-catalyzed phosphorylation of PKC, then the particular PKC isozyme involved should have one or more consensus ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites. Earlier studies have revealed that the PKCα molecule is phosphorylated at Thr<sup>497</sup>, Thr<sup>638</sup>, and S<sup>657</sup> residues. Following activation by membrane attachment, these phosphate groups are removed by a PKCα-activated phosphatase and the dephosphorylated

PKCα is rapidly degraded [31]. Thus phosphorylation is important for proper activation and turnover of the PKCα molecule. Of these phosphorylation sites, the Thr<sup>638</sup> residue is within a MAPK recognition sequence. Therefore, it is possible that the PKCα molecule is regulated by ERK1/2 through direct phosphorylation.

The mechanism of PKCα mediated caspase-3 inhibition also requires further analysis. Earlier studies have shown that drugs which activate PKC promote cell survival [32], and inhibitors of PKC, such as staurosporin, induce apoptosis [29, 33, 34]. It has also been observed that activators of PKC stimulate phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112, indirectly, through a downstream target, p90<sup>Rsk</sup> [35]. Although each of Bad, caspase-9 and caspase-3 harbors one or more copies of the PKC phosphorylation sequence (S/TXR/K), recent studies have shown that a PKC substrate, p90<sup>Rsk</sup>, actually catalyzes PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Bad at Ser<sup>112</sup>, which ablates interactions of Bad with Bcl-2, thus blocking apoptosis [35, 36]. Therefore, phosphorylation of Bad, caspase-3 or caspase-9 could be a reason for the inhibition of caspase-3.

Caspases are kept under check in some viruses that harbor genes encoding caspase inhibitory proteins. In this way, such viruses suppress host defense mechanisms that otherwise would eliminate virus-infected cells by apoptosis. The first inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) was discovered in baculoviruses [37]. Subsequently, cellular IAP homologs were found in many animal species [38, 39]. Each IAP molecule contains one to three copies of an 80-amino acid baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR), which are potentially involved in Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination via a DX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>C/HX<sub>6</sub>C consensus [40]. Additionally, BIR proteins also contain a C<sub>3</sub>HC<sub>4</sub> RING finger [39]. Mammalian IAP proteins (XIAP, NAIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and survivin) block apoptosis by inactivating the terminal effector caspases caspase-3 and -7 and by interfering with upstream activation of caspase-9 [39, 41, 42].

A likely mechanism of inhibition of caspase-3 involves NFκB mediated induction of IAP expression. Cowen et al. [43] have shown that agonist activation of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-R causes activation of NFκB. Also, it has been reported that PKC activation could cause stimulation of the transcription factor NFκB, which in turn causes induced expression of the IAPs [44, 45]. As discussed earlier, the IAPs are known to block caspase-3 activity and apoptosis. Therefore, it is possible that a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-R-mediated NFκB activation causes induced expression of IAPs, thereby resulting in an inhibition of caspase-3.

There has been a considerable debate over the molecular signals that relay the effect of any receptor-mediated increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) to the MAPK pathway in various cell types (Fig. 5). Our earlier studies had implicated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-R → MAPK signaling in HN2–5 cells [11]. Other reports in diverse cell types have shown the involvement of the calcium-sensitive signaling molecules like Src and Pyk2 in receptor-mediated MAPK

signaling [9,46]. Our investigations to complete this link between the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-R-mediated increase in \[Ca<sup>2+</sup>\]<sub>i</sub> and the MAPK pathway in the HN2–5 cells will be reported elsewhere.

We have demonstrated that the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-mediated blockage of insult-triggered caspase-3 activation requires PKCα. Collectively, this study elucidates a novel, neuroprotective pathway, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-R → G protein → PLCβ → Ca<sup>2+</sup> → → → MAPK → PKCα → caspase-3 (inhibition), placing PKCα in a novel role as a signaling molecule linking the MAPK pathway to caspase-3. Selective activation of PKCα over PKCβ in the HN2–5 cells indicates that specific PKC molecules are sequestered in the cytosol as a sequel to agonist activation of a receptor. Current literature is replete with examples of such channeled transmission of molecular signals in the neural and other cell types. Further investigation of this pathway would reveal new mechanisms and proteins linking G protein-coupled receptors to ERK1/2 activation and caspase-3 inhibition in neuronal cells.
