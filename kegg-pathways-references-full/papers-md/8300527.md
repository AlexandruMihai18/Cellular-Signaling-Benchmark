Malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) decarboxylase is widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the biological function of this enzyme has not been established in any organism. To elucidate the structure and function of this enzyme, the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene from *Saccharopolyspora erythraea* (formerly *Streptomyces erythraeus*) was cloned and sequenced. This gene would encode a polypeptide of 417 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence matched the experimentally determined amino acid sequences of 25 N-terminal residues each of the enzyme and of an internal peptide obtained by proteolysis of the purified enzyme. This decarboxylase showed homology with aminoglycoside N6′-acetyltransferases of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Serratia marcescens*, and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a single transcript. The transcription initiation site was 220 bp upstream of the start codon. When expressed in *Escherichia coli*, the *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene yielded a protein that cross-reacted with antiserum prepared against *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and catalyzed decarboxylation of [3-¹⁴C] malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and ¹⁴CO₂. The *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was disrupted by homologous recombination using an integrating vector pWHM3. The gene-disrupted transformant did not produce immunologically cross-reacting 45-kDa decarboxylase, lacked malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity, and could not produce erythromycin. Exogenous propionate restored the ability to produce erythromycin. These results strongly suggest that the decarboxylase provides propionyl-CoA for erythromycin synthesis probably via decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA derived from succinyl-CoA, and therefore the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene is designated *eryM*. The gene disrupted mutants also did not produce pigments.

The aglycone portion of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A produced by *Saccharopolyspora erythraea* (formerly *Streptomyces erythraeus*) is probably synthesized from one molecule of propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) and six molecules of methylmalonyl-CoA. The biosynthesis of this macrocyclic lactone is analogous to fatty acid biosynthesis (10, 11, 14, 22, 37). The multimethyl-branched fatty acids, the major product of the uropygial glands of waterfowl such as geese and ducks (4, 7), are generated from acetyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA by fatty acid synthase, while the tissue-specific presence of a very active malonyl-CoA decarboxylase ensures that only methylmalonyl-CoA is available for fatty acid synthesis. The presence of malonyl-CoA severely interferes with the production of multimethyl-branched fatty acids, and the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase prevents such interference (5, 6, 27, 29). The multimethyl-branched aglycone of erythromycin A is produced by polyketide synthase (11, 14), a fatty acid synthase-like enzyme, through a process similar to that observed with the multimethyl-branched fatty acids in vertebrates. The time course of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase production corresponded to that of erythromycin production, suggesting the possibility that the decarboxylase in *S. erythraea* plays a role similar to that suggested for the vertebrate system. The stereospecificity of the decarboxylase from *S. erythraea* for (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA (unlike the vertebrate enzyme) (23) suggested another possible role for the decarboxylase in erythromycin production. This decarboxylase might generate propionyl-CoA from (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA generated from succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (24). Succinyl-CoA could be generated from carbohydrate in the medium that is known to support erythromycin production by furnishing the carbon source for erythromycin (12). This view has been supported by the isolation of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from *S. erythraea* (24). In support of such a possibility, in a sucrose-alanine medium, erythromycin was produced in large quantities without any growth of the organism, and the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity increased dramatically just prior to the rapid production of erythromycin (23). However, no direct evidence is available for a role for malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in erythromycin production. In fact, no definitive evidence for a biological function for malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in any organism has been presented. A 20-kb malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene from a vertebrate has been cloned and sequenced, but the gene has not been cloned from any prokaryote (13).

In this report, we describe the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the structural gene for malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from *S. erythraea* and provide evidence for a biological function of this gene. We report that disruption of this malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene inhibits the biosynthesis of erythromycin. Propionate provided in the medium restores the ability of the gene-disrupted mutant to produce erythromycin.

*MATERIALS AND METHODS*

Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions. *S. erythraea* CA340, obtained from C. R. Hutchinson (University of Wisconsin, Madison), was maintained in R2T agar medium described by Weber et al. (49) and grown in SGGP medium (4

g of peptone, 4 g of yeast extract, 2 g of glycine, 0.5 g of MgSO₄·7H₂O, 20 ml of 50% glucose solution, 20 ml of 0.5 M KH₂PO₄; made up to 1 liter with water) at 32°C (50). For vegetative growth of *S. erythraea*, a medium containing 15 g of sucrose, 5 g of peptone, 2.5 g of yeast extract, and 0.5 g of L-arginine, made up to 1 liter with water (pH 7.0), was used (23). *Escherichia coli* DH5αF′ was used as the host strain for both M13mp18 derivatives subcloning and sequencing work. *E. coli* Y1090 was used to host λgt11 phage infection and its propagation. The bacterial host for expression of *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was *E. coli* pLysS, which is a derivative of *E. coli* BL21(DE3) with a cloned T7 lysozyme gene. *E. coli* BL21(DE3) is deficient in the *lon* protease and carries the structural gene for T7 RNA polymerase under control of the *lacUV5* promoter. Plasmid pET-3a, used for expression of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene in *E. coli*, carries the bacteriophage T7 φ10 promoter and terminator and the translation initiation region S₁₀ for the T7 gene 10 protein (45). The integration vector pWHM3 (49) was obtained from C. R. Hutchinson. pWHM3 has both *E. coli* and *Streptomyces* origins of replication. Ampicillin and thiostrepton resistance genes were used as selectable markers in *E. coli* and *S. erythraea*, respectively. pWHM3 also has multiple cloning sites within the β-galactosidase gene.

DNA isolation and manipulation. Minipreparations of M13 phage and lambda DNA were done as described by Maniatis et al. (33). Digestions with restriction endonucleases and ligation experiments were carried out by standard procedures (33). *S. erythraea* chromosomal DNA was prepared by lysozyme treatment and phenol-chloroform extraction as described elsewhere (26).

Determination of N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was purified from cultures of *S. erythraea* as previously described (23). Additional purification was performed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins in the fraction with the highest malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity were separated by native PAGE. This native gel was cut into small slices (5 mm in length). Each slice was macerated in 10 mM citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.5)–1 mM dithioerythritol (DTE)–5 mM EDTA, kept overnight at 4°C, and then assayed for decarboxylase activity. Proteins from the slice containing decarboxylase activity were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE. The purified malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was separated by SDS-PAGE, using the discontinuous buffer system described by Laemmli (31), and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie blue as described by Matsudaira (34). The protein band corresponding to the 45-kDa malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing.

The internal peptides were obtained from *Staphylococcus aureus* V8 protease treatment of purified 45-kDa malonyl-CoA decarboxylase as described by Cleveland et al. (9) and electroblotted onto a Problot membrane (34). A 31-kDa peptide band was cut out and subjected to amino acid sequencing. Both N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation with an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer.

Preparation of antiserum. Antiserum against malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was raised in a New Zealand White rabbit. Purified 45-kDa malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was injected subcutaneously in Rabi adjuvant. Booster injections were administered every 10 to 14 days. The rabbit was bled by heart puncture 12 days after the second booster, and the serum was decanted after clot formation.

Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. Proteins separated by

SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto Nytran membranes and detected by reaction with anti-malonyl-CoA decarboxylase serum as indicated by Burnette (8), using ¹²⁵I-protein A.

Construction of the genomic library. Chromosomal DNA isolated from *S. erythraea* was partially digested with Sau3A. DNA fragments of the desired size range (1 to 3 kb) were selected, electroeluted, and precipitated in ethanol. The DNA fragments were blunt ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, methylated with EcoRI methylase, and ligated with three different phosphorylated EcoRI linkers [d(pGGAAATTC), d(pCCGAATTGG) and d(pCCCGAATCGGG)] as described by Maniatis et al. (33). Linker-ligated DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and separated on an agarose gel to remove excess linkers. The recovered EcoRI-digested DNA fragments were ligated into dephosphorylated EcoRI-digested λgt11 vector. The ligation mixture was packaged in vitro, and the titer was determined.

Cloning of the *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene. An 18-mer synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-GACGT(C/G)GA(A/G)CT(C/G)GC(C/G)GAC-3′, with 16-fold degeneracy was designed and synthesized on the basis of the biased codon usage typical of *Streptomyces* genes (35). This oligonucleotide encoding amino acids 4 to 9 of the N-terminal sequence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was end labeled with [γ-³²P]ATP and used to screen the *S. erythraea* genomic library in λgt11 vector. Hybridization was carried out in a solution containing 6 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate [pH 7.0]), 1 × Denhardt’s solution (33), 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.1 mg of denatured salmon sperm DNA per ml at 42°C overnight. Filters were washed in 6 × SSC–0.05% sodium pyrophosphate for two 10-min periods at room temperature, 60 min at 42°C, and 30 min at 45 to 47°C. Filters were dried and exposed to an X-ray film; one clone, λSDC1 was obtained.

To obtain more nucleotide sequences of 5′ untranslated region of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene, a 90-bp DNA fragment containing the 5′ region of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene and a 500-bp DNA fragment containing the 3′ untranslated region of the decarboxylase gene were used as hybridization probes to screen the *S. erythraea* genomic library. Four positive plaques (λSDC2, λSDC3, λSDC4, and λSDC5) that hybridized with the 90-bp DNA fragment but not the 500-bp DNA fragment were picked, and phage DNAs from these clones were isolated.

DNA sequencing. The 1.9-kb EcoRI-restricted DNA fragment from λSDC1 containing the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was subcloned into M13mp18 to create SDC1. The EcoRI-restricted DNA fragments from λSDC2, λSDC3, λSDC4, and λSDC5 were subcloned into M13mp18 to create SDC2, SDC3, SDC4, and SDC5, respectively. Nested deletions were created by treating PstI-XbaI-digested SDC1 sequentially with exonuclease III and S1 nuclease as described by Henikoff (18). The nucleotide sequence of the resulting single-stranded DNA was determined by the dideoxy-chain termination method (41), using the Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemicals) as instructed by the manufacturer. An M13 universal primer was used to obtain the nucleotide sequences of all deletion clones of SDC1. A unique synthetic 30-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-CACGTCGCCC GCCACGCCGTTCACTCCATC-3′, complementary to the first five amino acids of the N terminus and 15 bp upstream from the start codon GTG was used as a sequencing primer for SDC2, SDC3, SDC4, and SDC5 to obtain the 5′ untranslated DNA sequence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene. The sequence data were analyzed by the computer program FASTA and compared with the GenBank data base for sequence homologies.

RNA isolation and Northern (RNA) blotting. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium-cesium chloride method (1) from *S. erythraea* cells (containing no recombinant plasmids) collected after different periods of growth (12, 24, 36, and 48 h) following inoculation of the fresh medium with a 2- to 3-day-old seed culture. Total RNA (30 μg) from each time interval was separated through a 1% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel as described by Fourney et al. (16). Hybridization was performed at 42°C in the presence of 50% formamide (33). The membrane was washed for two 10-min periods at room temperature in 1× SSPE (32)—0.1% SDS and then for 30 min at 55°C in 0.3× SSPE—0.1% SDS, after which autoradiography was performed. X-ray film was scanned on an Eikonix 78/99 digital scanner. Optical density values computed in relative units were plotted.

Primer extension. The primer extension reaction was performed as described by Maniatis et al. (33), with 50 to 60 μg of template RNA, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and the unique 30-mer oligonucleotide end labeled with [γ-³²P]ATP. The extension products were analyzed on a 5% denaturing sequencing gel.

Construction and use of *E. coli* expression plasmid pET-3a(B). The NdeI- and BamHI-digested ligation mixture of the 1.9-kb EcoRI fragment of SDC1 and NdeI linker [d(pCC ATATGG)] was ligated into pET-3a digested with both NdeI and BamHI to give the expression plasmid pET-3a(B), which was used to transform *E. coli* pLysS.

For expression of recombinant malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, *E. coli* pLysS/pET-3a(B) was grown at 37°C on LB medium containing 25 μg of chloramphenicol and 50 μg of ampicillin per ml. When the cultures reached an *A*₆₀₀ of 0.3 to 0.4, they were induced with 0.5 mM isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and grown at 37°C for a further 2 to 3 h to induce malonyl-CoA decarboxylase production. Small portions of the induced and uninduced cultures were analyzed by Western blotting.

Purification of recombinant malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from *E. coli*. The recombinant malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was purified by a modification of the procedure of Hunaiti and Kolattukudy (23). The cells were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTE, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication (six 15-s pulses). After centrifugation at 20,000 × *g* for 20 min at 4°C, the supernatant was passed through DEAE-cellulose column and then dialyzed against 10 mM citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTE. After removal of the precipitate, the supernatant was subjected to SP Sephadex column chromatography followed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-150 column. As a final purification step, fractions with malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity were separated by nondenaturing PAGE, and each macerated slice (5 mm in length) cut from the native gel was subjected to a decarboxylase activity assay. The macerated slice containing malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity was subjected to SDS-PAGE.

Integrative transformation of *S. erythraea* protoplasts. The *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was disrupted through homologous recombination by an integration construct containing an internal segment of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene. An internal 665-bp fragment of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was excised from an exonuclease III deletion clone of SDC1~opp~ and subcloned into the HindIII site of pWHM3 to create pSDC~int~. SDC1~opp~ is the opposite orientation of SDC1. pSDC~int~ was used to transform *S. erythraea* protoplasts. Transformants were selected on the basis of the ability conferred by the thiostrepton resistance gene of pWHM3 to grow on thiostrepton-containing plates.

Integrative transformation of *S. erythraea* protoplasts was done by the polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation procedure of Weber and Losick (47). Spores of strain CA340 were inoculated into 50 ml of SGGP medium and grown for 4 days at 32°C. The mycelia were harvested, washed in 10.3% sucrose, resuspended in 25 ml of 1XPT buffer [100 g of sucrose, 0.25 g of K₂SO₄, 5.1 g of MgCl₂·6H₂O, 2 ml of trace elements solution, 25 ml of 1 M CaCl₂, 100 ml of 0.25 M N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES) buffer (pH 7.2); made up to 1 liter with water] containing 5 mg of lysozyme per ml and incubated at 30°C for 1 h, triturated occasionally. After the contents settled (in 15 min), the top protoplast layer was withdrawn with a pipette, pelleted gently (2,500 rpm, 15 min), washed in 10 ml of 1XPT buffer, and resuspended in 1 ml of 1XPT buffer. Aliquots (100 μl) of the protoplasts were mixed with 5 μl of DNA and 500 μl of 25% polyethylene glycol in 1XPT buffer, and then 5 ml of 1XPT buffer was added. The transformed protoplasts were gently pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of 1XPT buffer, and 0.5-ml aliquots were plated out on R2T2 (R2T agar medium without peptone). After 24 h, the plates were overlaid with 3.5 ml of nutrient agar containing 250 μg of thiostrepton and incubated further for 10 days at 32°C. A portion of the combined primary transformants was plated onto R2T2 plates. After 10 days of growth at 32°C, the lawn of transformants was harvested, and a portion of that was replated onto R2T2-thiostrepton plates (20 μg/ml). After 10 days of growth at 32°C, thiostrepton-resistant colonies were individually passed through one more step of single-colony purification on R2T2-thiostrepton plates.

Time course of appearance of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity and erythromycin production of the transformant. Both the parental strain and the transformant were grown for 5 days in vegetative growth medium and then transferred to medium containing 1.5% sucrose and 0.2% alanine. Cells collected from aliquots of the culture, withdrawn at 8-h intervals, were ruptured by glass beads in 10 mM citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTE, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity was measured in crude extracts. Erythromycin was extracted with ethyl acetate from the culture filtrate (pH 9 to 10) obtained from each culture aliquot. Erythromycin was measured colorimetrically as described previously (15).

**RESULTS**

Amino acid sequence determination and oligonucleotide design. The published procedure for purifying malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from *S. erythraea* (23) was modified by inclusion of another step to avoid impurities that were sometimes found. The purified preparation resulting from the previously described procedure was subjected to nondenaturing PAGE, and the protein from the slice that contained the decarboxylase activity was recovered and subjected to SDS-PAGE. A single band at 45 kDa was found (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) of crude extracts of *S. erythraea* with rabbit antibodies prepared against the purified malonyl-CoA decarboxylase showed a strongly cross-reacting band at 45 kDa that matched the Coomassie blue-staining band; in addition, a higher-molecular-weight doublet in the crude extract showed cross-reactivity for reasons that are not understood. Amino-terminal sequence determination of the purified malonyl-CoA decarboxylase revealed the identity of 25 amino acid residues. The Streptomyces genome typically has a base composition of 69 to 74 mol% G+C, and therefore the protein-encoding open reading frames tend to have a very strong biased usage (over

otide 1471, encodes a polypeptide of 417 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45,169 Da. A putative ribosome-binding site (GGAG) was found 8 bp upstream from the start codon. The codon usage pattern of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene shows that the G+C contents in the first, second, and third positions of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase codons are 78.5, 54.5, and 89.7 mol%, respectively, with an overall average of 74.2 mol% G+C content.

Sequence homology studies. A computer search of the GenBank data base with the FASTA program revealed that the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene product presents significant similarity to the product of the aminoglycoside N6'-acetyltransferase genes of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Serratia marcescens*, and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* (Fig. 3), which specify resistance to amikacin and related aminoglycoside antibiotics via drug modification by N acetylation (36). The deduced amino acid sequence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene also bears homology with the C-terminal sequence of the kanamycin resistance gene product of *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* (Fig. 3) but not to the only vertebrate malonyl-CoA decarboxylase that had been sequenced (13, 25).

Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis of total RNA by using an [α-³²P]dCTP-labeled DNA fragment containing only the coding region of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene and 55 bp upstream from the start codon as the probe revealed a single RNA band which has the same size as 16S rRNA (1.54 kb). A time course of appearance of the decarboxylase mRNA suggested that the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene started to express very early, reached the maximum by 12 to 24 h, and then disappeared (Fig. 4). Since the cells from which RNA was isolated did not contain any recombinant plasmids, the decarboxylase mRNA was transcribed from the bacterial chromosome and not plasmids.

Transcription initiation site determination. A primer extension experiment was performed to determine the transcription initiation sites of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene. A 30-mer oligonucleotide end labeled with [γ-³²P]ATP was annealed to the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase RNA and extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The result indicated that the transcription started mainly at around 220 bp upstream of the start codon, which corresponds to the adenine residue (Fig. 5). A few longer transcripts with weak signals were also observed.

Genomic Southern blot analysis. To estimate the number of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase genes present in the *S. erythraea* genome, genomic DNA prepared from *S. erythraea* was cleaved with several different restriction endonucleases and subjected to Southern blot analysis with an [α-³²P]dCTP-labeled DNA fragment containing the coding region as the probe. A single band appeared on the autoradiogram when genomic DNA was cleaved with either *Bam*HI or *Xho*I, and two bands appeared when the DNA was cleaved with either *Sst*I or *Kpn*I (Fig. 6); the cloned decarboxylase gene contains one internal *Sst*I and *Kpn*I site. The results confirmed that the cloned malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene had originated from the genome of *S. erythraea* and suggest that there is only one copy of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene in the *S. erythraea* genome.

Expression of the *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene in *E. coli*. To confirm that the cloned DNA represents the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene, the cloned malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was expressed in *E. coli*. The *Nde*I linker was used to correct the reading frame when the 1.9-kb fragment containing the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was ligated into the expression plasmid pET-3a at the *Nde*I and *Bam*HI sites, which placed the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene under control of the T7 promoter. The expression of S.

Comparison of protein sequences of (from top to bottom) malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from *S. erythraea*, aminoglycoside N6'-acetyltransferases from *P. aeruginosa*, *S. marcescens*, and *K. pneumoniae*, and kanamycin resistance gene product from *A. tumefaciens*. Boldface letters indicate residues that are identical.

erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in *E. coli* pLysS/pET-3a(B) after IPTG induction was monitored by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7). The expressed malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was recognized by anti-malonyl-CoA decarboxylase serum in the induced culture but not in the uninduced culture. Another cross-reacting 65-kDa protein band was detected in the crude extracts of both induced and uninduced cultures just as observed in *S. erythraea* extracts shown in Fig. 1B. The identity of this protein remains obscure.

Purification of the recombinant malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from *E. coli*. The *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was purified from *E. coli* pLysS/pET-3a(B) by combined column chromatography and native PAGE. The degree of purification achieved by each step is shown in Fig. 8A. This purified protein catalyzed conversion of [3-¹⁴C]malonyl-CoA to ¹⁴CO₂ and acetyl-CoA. The molecular weight of the expressed malonyl-CoA decarboxylase estimated from the SDS-PAGE is consistent with that calculated on the basis of the amino acid sequence predicted from the open reading frame in the 1.9-kb genomic DNA fragment. That the 35-kDa protein band probably represents a degradation product of the expressed malonyl-CoA decarboxylase is indicated by the observation that the intensity of 35-kDa protein band increased as that of the expressed malonyl-CoA decarboxylase band decreased. Furthermore, this 35-kDa protein undetected in crude extract of the induced culture (see above) was recognized by the anti-malonyl-CoA decarboxylase serum (Fig. 8B).

Disruption of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene. To test for any possible role for malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in the biosynthesis of erythromycin, gene disruption was carried out in *S. erythraea*. The malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was disrupted by homologous recombination (Fig. 9A). After several steps of antibiotic selection, stably integrated transformants were selected. Southern hybridization analysis of chromosomal DNAs isolated from the parental strain and the

The fragment containing the coding region and 55 bp upstream of the GTG start codon, labeled with ³²P, was used as the probe. The autoradiogram was scanned by a digital scanner, and the relative units are plotted.

FIG. 5. Primer extension of the 5′ terminus of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase RNA. A [γ-³²P]-end-labeled 30-mer oligonucleotide was hybridized with 50 to 60 μg of RNA purified from 24-h-old cultures for the primer extension (33).

FIG. 6. Southern blot analysis of total genomic DNA isolated from *S. erythraea*. DNA samples (10 μg) were digested with several different restriction enzymes, electrophoresed, and analyzed by hybridization. The fragment containing the coding region and 55 bp upstream of the GTG start codon, labeled with <sup>32</sup>P, was used as the probe.

transformant, using the vector pWHM3 as the probe, showed that the parental strain revealed no hybridization signal and the transformant revealed two hybridizing bands for *Bam*HI and *Xho*I digestion (Fig. 9B). This result indicated that pWHM3 has been integrated into the genome of the transformant. The malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene contained neither *Bam*HI nor *Xho*I internal sites, and pWHM3 had one of each site. Integration of pWHM3 into the decarboxylase gene would generate three *Bam*HI-*Xho*I fragments. Only two of them would contain pWHM3 sequence. The sizes of two hybridizing bands in the transformant (Fig. 9B) matched the sizes of these two pWHM3-containing *Bam*HI-*Xho*I fragments (3.6 and 5.1 kb; Fig. 9A). Additional data on the disruption of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene came from Southern hybridization using the 1.9-kb *Eco*RI fragment as the probe. The parental strain showed one band at about 2.2 kb, and the transformant showed two bands at 1.4 and 5.1 kb for *Bam*HI and *Xho*I digestion (Fig. 9C). The sizes of these two bands in the transformant matched the sizes produced from the integration of the vector (Fig. 9A).

Disruption of the production of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase protein in the transformant. To test whether malonyl-CoA decarboxylase protein was present in the transformant,

(B) Western blot of purified *S. erythraea* malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from *E. coli* with anti-malonyl-CoA decarboxylase antibodies.

crude extracts of the parental and transformant strains were examined by Western blot analysis with the antiserum prepared against malonyl-CoA decarboxylase purified from *S. erythraea*. The result showed that the immunologically cross-reacting 45-kDa malonyl-CoA decarboxylase band was present in the parental strain but not in the transformant (Fig. 10).

Analysis of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity and erythromycin production of the gene-disrupted transformant. To determine whether disruption of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene affected the production of erythromycin, a time course analysis of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity and erythromycin production of the parental strain and the transformant was performed. The results revealed that the gene-disrupted transformant showed little malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity in comparison with the wild type (Fig. 11A), and this gene-disrupted mutant failed to produce erythromycin (Fig. 11B). Surprisingly, the disruption of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene also prevented the development of aerial mycelia and spores from substrate mycelia. When grown on an agar plate, the mutant remained as substrate mycelia instead differentiating into aerial mycelia and spores (Fig. 12B). The mutant also lost the ability to produce red pigment. The cell culture medium of the mutant remained yellow, while the medium of the parental strain became red as the cultures grew dense (Fig. 12A).

Effect of propionate on erythromycin production of the transformant. To test whether propionate can restore the ability of the transformant to produce erythromycin, erythromycin was extracted from culture filtrates of transformants grown in the presence of propionate. Without propionate, the transformant produced no erythromycin within 24 h of growth. Upon addition of propionate, erythromycin production by the transformant was restored to a level comparable to that of the wild type (Fig. 13). However, the red pigment synthesis was not restored by the exogenous propionate.

genome that was sequenced was the 1,251-bp coding sequence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene. This gene encodes a protein of 417 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45,169 Da, which is consistent with the molecular mass (45 kDa) of the purified decarboxylase as determined by SDS-PAGE. That this is the authentic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was shown by the fact that the deduced amino acid sequence exactly matched the N-terminal and the internal

the eryG gene, which is required for the terminal step in erythromycin A biosynthesis (48).

The transcription initiation site determined by primer extension analysis is at an adenine residue which is located about 220 bp upstream of the start codon. In such experiments, the possibility that because of the high G+C content, the reverse transcriptase could have paused at G+C-rich region cannot be ruled out. However, the major transcription initiation site revealed by primer extension is consistent with the size of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase RNA (1.54 kb) and with the size of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase-coding region (1,251 bp). Further, the nucleotide sequence (-35 region, TTGGCT) of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase promoter was found to be similar to the consensus sequence (TTGACA) for E. coli-like Streptomyces promoters, but the nucleotide sequence of the -10 region (AGGTCT) was less homologous to that (TAGGAT) for E. coli-like Streptomyces promoters (2, 19). However, with TAGGTC as the -10 region TCGACC found slightly upstream as the -35 region would give the more normal spacing for these elements.

A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene with sequences in the GenBank data base showed that the C-terminal portion of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase protein had a high degree of homology with the aminoglycoside N6'-acetyltransferase gene products of P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens, and K. pneumoniae. Although the significance of this homology is not known, it can be speculated that this similarity reflects a commonality in mechanism. On the basis of some inhibition studies, it was previously postulated that malonyl-CoA decarboxylation might involve a malonyl enzyme intermediate which upon decarboxylation would yield an acetyl enzyme intermediate that could then transfer the acetyl group back to CoA (39). If such transacylation processes are involved as an integral part of the decarboxylation mechanism, the sequence similarity detected with the acetyltransferases might reflect this mechanistic similarity.

Transformants of S. erythraea in which the coding region of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene has been disrupted by an integration vector have been produced. Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA yielded fragments of the predicted sizes, confirming the integration. Western blot analysis with S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase antiserum showed that the 45-kDa malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was present in the crude extract of the parental strain but was absent in the transformant. The transformant did not show any malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity, whereas the parental strain showed increasing decarboxylase activity with increasing time of growth. Thus, the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was truly disrupted in this mutant, and no other enzyme was decarboxylating malonyl-CoA. Therefore, this mutant was suitable for testing for the biological function of this enzyme.

In transformants, the block of aerial mycelium formation and the disappearance of red pigment were associated with integration of pSDCint into the chromosomal DNA of S. erythraea and the resulting disruption of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene function. When observed on solid media, colonies of the parental strain developed aerial mycelia and spores within several days, but colonies of transformants remained in the undifferentiated state. The transformant had the same phenotype as that of bldA mutant of Streptomyces coelicolor, but the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene does not contain any TTA codon which is translated by the bldA gene product (20, 32). It is possible that malonyl-CoA decarboxylase is somehow involved in the transition from the vegetative to the differentiated colonies through an alternative control mechanism.

Thus, the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene seems to be involved in several developmentally controlled pathways.

In the parental strain, the activity of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase increased rapidly as the production of the red pigment began. Since the time course of production of erythromycin was quite similar to that of pigment production, the correlation with the appearance of decarboxylase applies to both processes. The present results indicated that the decarboxylase is in some manner involved in the production of the pigments. Although various pigments from *Streptomyces* spp. have been identified (17, 38, 42, 43, 46), it is not possible to assign any specific function for the decarboxylase in pigment biosynthesis. In view of the observation that the pigment deficiency phenotype of mutants can be complemented by pleiotropic regulatory effects (21, 44), it is also possible that the decarboxylase gene disruption inhibited the synthesis of the pigment indirectly.

Our finding that the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene-disrupted mutant could not produce erythromycin when grown in sucrose-alanine medium but could produce the antibiotic when exogenous propionate was provided suggests a previously unsuspected role for the decarboxylase. In this medium, succinate is probably the source of propionyl-CoA that would be generated by the action of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and of the decarboxylase that has been shown to be specific for (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA, the same stereoisomer produced by the mutase (24). Such a role for the decarboxylase provides a biological meaning for our previous finding that the decarboxylase from *S. erythraea* showed the opposite stereospecificity (23) from the vertebrate decarboxylase (28). This role for the decarboxylase was strongly supported by our finding that the ability of the decarboxylase gene-disrupted mutant to produce erythromycin was restored when exogenous propionate was provided in the medium. Removal of malonyl-CoA as the main function of the decarboxylase may be confined to specialized vertebrate tissues, in which the same enzyme catalyzed synthesis of *n*-acyl and multiple methyl-branched acids (4, 7, 30), and mitochondria, in which malonyl-CoA generated by propionyl-CoA carboxylase would inhibit key enzymes. It is not surprising that the role of the decarboxylase is different in cases such as mycobacterial production of mycocerosic acids (40) and erythronolide B production, which involve preferential use of methylmalonyl-CoA. Under normal growth conditions used for erythromycin production, what limits the production of this antibiotic is not well understood. If availability of substrates such as methylmalonyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA is limiting, it might be possible to enhance antibiotic production by overexpressing genes that encode enzymes such as the carboxylase and/or the decarboxylase. The enzyme to be overexpressed for beneficial effects could depend on the substrates supplied in the growth medium.
