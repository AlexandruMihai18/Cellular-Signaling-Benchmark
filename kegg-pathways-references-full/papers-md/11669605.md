# LMP1 structure and signal transduction

**Aristides G. Eliopoulos* and Lawrence S. Young**

The oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has structural features and functions reminiscent of a constitutively active TNF family receptor. LMP1 aggregates at the plasma membrane and initiates the activation of signalling pathways, such as NF-κB, the mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK and p38, the small GTPase Cdc42 and the JAK/STAT cascade. The constitutive engagement of these signals and the characteristic molecular interactions that regulate them provide the basis for the molecular explanation of the transforming properties of this key EBV protein.

## The role of EBV-encoded LMP1 in cellular transformation

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a γ-herpes virus that widely infects human populations predominantly at an early age but remains mostly asymptomatic. Viral infection during adolescence or adulthood may however lead to infectious mononucleosis, a disease characterized by a variety of symptoms, including fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy and the presence of atypical dividing lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Experimental and clinical evidence also implicate EBV in the aetiology of human malignancies, both of lymphoid and epithelial origin, such as Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease, lymphoproliferative disorders in immunocompromised individuals and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. These tumours highlight the lymphotropic nature of EBV, which is further emphasized by the ability of this virus to infect and immortalize normal resting B cells in vitro, converting them into permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). LCLs express nine viral proteins, one of which is the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). The presence of LMP1 in tumour biopsies from patients with certain EBV-associated malignancies, such as Hodgkin’s disease, immunoblastic lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas suggests that it may contribute to EBV-mediated tumourigenesis.

The first experimental evidence to support such a role was provided in a landmark study by Wang *et al.* who demonstrated that expression of this viral protein induces a transformed phenotype in rodent fibroblasts, characterized by significant morphological changes, anchorage independent growth and tumour formation in nude mice. Subsequent studies established an essential role for LMP1 in EBV-mediated B cell transformation, as recombinant virus lacking LMP1 is unable to immortalize resting B lymphocytes in vitro. Importantly, not only is LMP1 essential for the outgrowth of LCLs, but it is also required for the continued proliferation of these cells. In epithelial cultures, LMP1 expression blocks the normal process of differentiation, a property which may explain the undifferentiated epithelial phenotype frequently observed in nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Consistent with these in vitro findings, targeted expression of LMP1 in the skin or B cell compartment of transgenic mice induces hyperproliferation of epithelium and lymphomagenesis, respectively.

This oncogenic ability of LMP1 can be attributed to at least four of its functions. Firstly, transient expression of LMP1 in primary resting B cells induces DNA synthesis, a process reminiscent of antigen-mediated B cell-activation. LMP1 can also suppress cell death induced by a variety of stimuli through the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bfl-1, A20 and cIAPs. Recent

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the molecular interactions and signalling pathways engaged by LMP1. LMP1 has a short cytoplasmic N-terminus, six transmembrane segments which confer aggregation and oligomerization at the plasma membrane and a long cytoplasmic C-tail containing two effector domains, CTAR1/TES1 (aa 194–232) and CTAR2/TES2 (aa 351–386). CTAR1, which is essential for EBV-mediated B cell immortalization, binds TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3 and TRAF5 through a P204xQ206xxD209 motif and activates the NF-κB and p38 signalling pathways. CTAR2 supports the long-term growth of immortalized B cells and recruits TRADD through a YYD386 motif to activate downstream signals, such as NF-κB, JNK and p38. Both LMP1 C-terminal domains also mediate the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, although an intermediate region enclosing two copies of a proline-rich PxxPxP sequence has been shown to bind JAK3 and induce STAT binding activity independently of CTAR1/CTAR2. The transmembrane domains of LMP1 are responsible for the activation of the small GTPase Cdc42 leading to cytoskeletal changes.

findings also suggest that LMP1 promotes the growth of primary embryo fibroblasts by interfering with the machinery regulating cellular senescence.¹⁴ Finally, expression of this EBV-encoded protein in carcinoma cell lines induces IL-8 production¹⁵ and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases,¹⁶ suggesting that in addition to its transforming potential, LMP1 may influence angiogenesis and metastasis in EBV-associated tumours. Consistent with this notion, LMP1 expression in MDCK canine cells results in increased cell motility and invasive growth.¹⁷ LMP1 modulates a plethora of additional activities, such as cytokine production (i.e. IL-6, IL-10) and up-regulation of cell surface markers (i.e. ICAM1, CD40, CD44, etc.), some of which may also contribute to the transformation process *in vitro* and *in vivo*.

sequences responsible for tethering and orientating the protein to the plasma membrane where the transmembrane loops promote constitutive aggregation and oligomerization. A proportion of LMP1 molecules is identified within glycosphingolipid-rich membrane domains (also known as membrane rafts), which play an important role in the initiation of receptor signalling.¹⁸ These topological and structural characteristics are critical for most LMP1 functions. Thus, a naturally occurring LMP1 mutant that lacks the N-terminal cytosolic region and the first transmembrane loop (referred to as D1LMP1) does not aggregate and lacks the transforming and cell-activating properties of the wild-type protein.¹⁹ However, it is the cytoplasmic C-terminus of LMP1 which is responsible for transduction of signals leading to primary B cell transformation and phenotypic changes. Indeed, removal of this LMP1 domain in the context of EBV abrogates the ability of the virus to immortalize B lymphocytes.²⁰ Mutational analysis has identified two distinct functional regions within the LMP1 C-terminus with respect to induction of phenotypic markers, such as CD40 and CD54 (ICAM1): the membrane proximal C-terminus activating region-1 (CTAR1, aa 194–232) and the distal CTAR2 (aa 351–386; Figure 1).²¹

### LMP1 structure and molecular interactions

The structural features of LMP1 enable it to function as a constitutively active receptor. LMP1 comprises a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 17 amino acids (aa), six hydrophobic transmembrane segments and a long C-terminal cytosolic region of 200 aa (Figure 1). The N-terminal tail of LMP1 contains
These two regions coincide with the transformation effector sites TES1 and TES2, respectively, which are critical for EBV-mediated B cell immortalization.²² Thus, recombinant EBV carrying LMP1 deleted for CTAR1/TES1 lacks transforming capacity.²³,²⁴ Furthermore, although an EBV mutant that expresses LMP1 truncated for CTAR2/TES2 is capable of immortalizing primary B lymphocytes, the long-term in vitro growth of these cells is compromised.²⁵

The molecular connections between LMP1 and the cellular transcriptional machinery utilized to regulate these phenomena have recently started to emerge. In a seminal study, Mosialos and colleagues²⁶ first showed, using yeast two-hybrid analysis, that the CTAR1 domain of LMP1 recruits two members of the TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) family, namely TRAF1 and TRAF3. This finding set the scene for the molecular explanation of the pleiotropic LMP1-induced activities and suggested that common signalling pathways may exist between LMP1 and members of the TNF receptor superfamily, such as CD40 and TNFRII, which also bind TRAFs. Indeed, in a transgenic mouse model, LMP1 appears to recapitulate many of the functions of CD40.²⁷ TRAF2 and TRAF5 were also described to interact with the same LMP1 domain.²⁸⁻³⁰

Initial evidence indicated that the presence of a P₂₀₄xQ₂₀₆xT₂₀₈ motif in CTAR1 is critical for TRAF binding to occur, as mutation of Pro₂₀₄ or Glu₂₀₆ to alanine impairs this association.²⁸,³¹ In addition, PxQxT/S motifs (where x is any amino acid) are found in the cytoplasmic tails of CD40 and certain other members of the TNF receptor superfamily which interact with TRAFs. Whilst this motif is important for TRAF1 binding to LMP1 CTAR1, the PxQxT domain of CD40 does not interact directly with TRAF1.³² Furthermore, certain PxQxT containing regions in the rhesus LMP1 homologue or a PxQxS sequence at the extreme C-terminus of B95.8 (aa 379–383) or rhesus (aa 581–585) proteins fail to associate with TRAF2 or TRAF3.²⁹,³³ Therefore, the presence of a PxQxT/S sequence does not determine TRAF binding *per se*. More recently, structural analysis of the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF2 in complex with peptides from LMP1 or various TNFR family members has identified two TRAF2-binding motifs, a major (P/S/A/T)x(Q/E)E consensus which is common to CD40, TNFRII, CD30 and CD27 and a minor PxQxxD, common to LMP1 and TANK, a TRAF-interacting protein.³⁴ Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis showed that the LMP1 peptide has by far the weakest monovalent affinity to TRAF2

in vitro,³⁵ consistent with the relatively modest in vivo interaction of TRAF2 and LMP1 observed in LCLs.²⁸ Thus, whilst the presence of the PxQxxD motif in CTAR1LMP1 guarantees TRAF2 binding, its primary structure appears to allow only weak interactions to occur.

Yeast two-hybrid and biochemical analyses have recently identified TRADD and RIP associating with the CTAR2 region of LMP1.²²,²⁵ These two proteins are known by virtue of their role in TNFRI signalling. TNFRI possesses a death domain region in its cytoplasmic tail which, following receptor aggregation, interacts with a homologous sequence in the carboxy-terminus of TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain protein). This interaction is responsible for transmission of pro-apoptotic signals and can also serve as a platform for recruitment of other molecules, such as RIP (receptor-interacting protein) and TRAF2. However, LMP1 does not possess a death domain homology region, suggesting that the nature of the TRADD interactions with LMP1 and TNFRI may differ. Consistent with this notion, over-expression of LMP1 CTAR2 does not induce apoptosis in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and only part of the TRADD C-terminal death domain appears to be required for functional interaction with LMP1.²² Another report also points to different topologies of the proximal signalling complexes of LMP1 and TNFRI but identified the N-terminus rather than part of the death domain of TRADD as being responsible for LMP1 binding.³⁶ Both TRADD and RIP interactions require an intact YYD₃₈₆ motif at the cytoplasmic end of LMP1 but a wider region of LMP1 appears to be responsible for binding RIP (aa 351–386), compared to TRADD (aa 375–386).²² Interestingly, both the PxQxxD and YYD motifs are conserved among human LMP1 variants and the monkey homologues (Table 1), further emphasizing the significance of these molecular interactions for LMP1 function. Indeed, a recombinant virus lacking the core LMP1 TRAF-binding site and some adjacent sequences (aa 185–211) is unable to transform primary B cells in vitro, whilst a YYD₃₈₆ → ID mutation significantly impairs the outgrowth of LCLs.²³,²⁵

Unlike CTAR1 and CTAR2, the intermediate domain of B95.8 LMP1 (aa 232–351) does not affect the ability of EBV to immortalize B cells in vitro.³⁷ This domain contains a 33 bp repeat region enclosing two copies of a proline-rich PxxPxP sequence (aa 275–280 and 302–307, respectively) which has been reported to serve as a docking site

for the Janus kinase 3 (JAK3). Although one of these motifs is absent in most LMP1 variants other than B95.8 (Fielding CA, Sandvej K, Mehl A, Brennan P, Jones M, Rowe M, unpublished results), there is evidence to suggest that the PxxPxP copy number does not significantly affect JAK3 binding.

### LMP1 signalling cascades

Similarly to the TNFR superfamily of receptors, LMP1 activates a complex range of signalling cascades. Our current understanding of the signals activated by LMP1 is summarized in the following sections.

#### Activation of the NF-κB pathway

The Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors includes five members, RelA (p65), RelB, NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52) and c-Rel, which form homo- or heterodimers to regulate gene expression. The ongoing characterization of NF-κB signalling has revealed its critical role in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, and inflammation. The list of potent activators of NF-κB is also diverse and includes pro-inflammatory stimuli such as TNF, cytokines such as CD40L and interleukin 1 (IL-1), bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as stress signals. In addition, many viruses, including HTLV-1, HSV-8 and EBV, utilize this pathway to promote survival and transformation of infected target cells. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that suppression of EBV-mediated NF-κB activation compromises the viability of virus-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines. LMP1 is the major effector of EBV-induced NF-κB and this activity is critical for the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene products, such as A20 and cIAPs, cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8, as well as cell surface antigens such as CD40 and CD54 (ICAM1). Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB impairs the ability of LMP1 to promote transformation and tumourigenicity in Rat-1 fibroblasts. This effect is consistent with the observation that the LMP1 domains which are critical for immortalization of EBV-infected B cells, namely CTAR1 and CTAR2, are also solely responsible for NF-κB signalling (Figure 1). The relative contribution of CTAR1 versus CTAR2 to LMP1-induced NF-κB depends on the cell line tested, with CTAR2 being the major effector site particularly in epithelial cell lines and fibroblasts. Although these two regions are essential for downstream signalling, NF-κB activation also requires clustering of LMP1 at the cell membrane, as the D1LMP1 mutant is significantly impaired in its ability to signal on the NF-κB axis. Furthermore, a recombinant chimeric molecule comprising the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD2 (aa 1–212) and the cytoplasmic C-terminus of LMP1 (aa 192–386) activates NF-κB only following CD2 receptor cross-linking. Recent work in our laboratory also points to an important

regulatory role for the LMP1 transmembrane domains in NF-κB signalling through modulation of LMP1 protein turnover.⁴⁵

Analysis of nuclear extracts isolated from LMP1-expressing cells or from cells transfected with LMP1 mutants lacking CTAR1 or CTAR2 has demonstrated the presence of a variety of NF-κB complexes bound to NF-κB specific sequences. These include p50/p50 homodimers and p52/p65 and p65/p50 heterodimers, the latter being the most well characterized.⁴⁶⁻⁴⁸ The cascade of signalling events which is initiated at the cell membrane following LMP1 expression and ends in the translocation of active p65/p50 NF-κB to the nucleus has been extensively studied and shares similarities to the pathways activated by clustered TNF receptors or CD40. Thus, the interactions of TRAF2 and TRAF5 with CTAR1 appear to be critical for its ability to signal on the NF-κB axis, as alanine mutations in the core TRAF binding motif or over-expression of dominant negative TRAF2 or TRAF5 molecules abrogate CTAR1-mediated NF-κB activation.²⁸,²⁹,³¹,⁴⁹ In addition, TRAF3 and TRAF1 may influence these signals indirectly by competing or synergizing with TRAF2, respectively. Therefore, whilst TRAF1 is unable to induce NF-κB *per se*, its over-expression significantly augments CTAR1-induced NF-κB activation.²⁸ Interestingly, epithelial cell lines are deficient for TRAF1 and, unlike B cells, do not up-regulate TRAF1 in response to LMP1 expression.³¹ The significance of these observations for the nature of CTAR1-mediated signals in different cell types remains to be determined.

The ability of TRAF2 or TRAF5 to recruit NIK (NF-κB inducing kinase) initiates an established cascade of phosphorylation events in which IkB-regulatory kinases (IKKα, IKKβ and IKKγ) are activated downstream of NIK and, in turn, promote phosphorylation of IkBa and other IkB proteins (see Figure 1). IkBa sequesters latent p65/p50 in an inactive form in the cytoplasm but its phosphorylation and subsequent degradation allows translocation of active NF-κB to the nucleus and activation of target genes. NIK appears to be responsible for these LMP1 signals in as much as expression of a kinase-inactive NIK mutant functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of CTAR1-mediated NF-κB activation *in vitro*.⁵⁰,⁵² Similar experiments using dominant negative mutants of IKKα and IKKβ have demonstrated their contribution to CTAR1-emanating signals⁵⁰ and the ability of LMP1 to promote phosphorylation and degradation

of IkBa has long been recognized.⁴⁶ Thus, the experimental evidence so far suggests that the CTAR1 domain of LMP1 activates NF-κB through a TRAF2→NIK→IKK→IkBa pathway. Other kinases, such as MEKK1, have also been reported to interact with TRAF2 and to influence NF-κB signalling in response to certain stimuli, but their contribution to LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation remains to be examined. In addition, the current debate on the physiological role of NIK in IKK phosphorylation highlights the need to re-assess its contribution to LMP1-induced NF-κB signalling in appropriate knock-out cell systems.⁵²

The CTAR2 region of LMP1 requires TRADD but not RIP for NF-κB activation.²² The N-terminus of TRADD strongly binds TRAF2 and it is possible that this interaction initiates a TRAF2→NIK→IKK→IkBa cascade similar to that engaged by CTAR1. Indeed, dominant-negative mutants of TRAF2, NIK and IKKs inhibit CTAR2-induced NF-κB signalling, and similar results have been obtained following over-expression of TANK or A20, two TRAF2-interacting proteins which antagonize its NF-κB activating function.²⁹,⁵⁰,⁵² Thus, the available experimental evidence so far suggests that a TRADD→TRAF2→NIK→IKK→IkBa pathway is responsible for NF-κB activation by the CTAR2 domain of LMP1.

### Activation of MAPK pathways

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which includes the ERK, p38 and JNK kinases, plays an important role in regulating cellular responses to a multitude of environmental stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines and stress signals. These pathways involve a core cascade of events in which an upstream MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) is activated by extracellular stimuli or intracellular effector molecules and, in turn, phosphorylates a MAPKK, leading eventually to the activation of a MAPK. A large number of upstream MAPKKK has been identified, probably reflecting a cell type and stimulus-dependent tuning of intracellular signalling. The list of MAPK targets is also diverse and includes transcription factors, such as c-jun/AP-1 for JNK, Elk-1 for ERK and STAT1 for p38, as well as various kinases, such as MAPKAP-2 for p38 and Msk-1 for both p38 and ERK.

Recent work from a number of groups has demonstrated that stable or transient expression of B95.8 LMP1 activates the JNK (cJun N-terminal kinase, also known as stress activated protein kinase-SAPK) pathway and its downstream target, the pleiotropic

transcription factor AP-1.53–55 Other LMP1 variants, such as CAO and the monkey homologues can also engage JNK/AP-1,45,54 suggesting that this phenomenon is an important, *bona fide* effect of LMP1. Interestingly, LMP1-induced JNK/AP-1 activation in HEK 293 cells occurs exclusively through the CTAR2 region and can be dissociated from NF-κB induction (Figure 1). Thus, inhibition of JNK by expression of a dominant negative form of its upstream kinase SEK/JNKK, does not affect NF-κB binding and, conversely, a constitutively active IkBa suppresses LMP1-induced NF-κB but not JNK activity.54 These observations raise the question of how JNK signalling is regulated in response to LMP1 expression. Fine mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that amino acid substitutions which abolish CTAR2-mediated NF-κB also abrogate JNK signalling. For example, a Y384 → G mutation in the critical TRADD-interacting YYD386 motif has a deleterious effect on both CTAR2-mediated JNK and NF-κB activities,52,56 suggesting that the proximal components of these events are similar or identical. However, the contribution of TRADD and TRAF2 to LMP1-mediated JNK signalling is still unresolved. One study showed that whilst expression of dominant negative TRAF2 inhibits CD40-induced JNK, it has no effect on the ability of LMP1 to engage this pathway.36 Our work in a panel of established cell lines, such as HEK 293, SV 40-transformed human keratinocytes and COS-1 mouse fibroblasts, demonstrates that expression of N-terminus deleted TRAF2 partially suppresses LMP1-induced JNK signals52 (Eliopoulos, Blake and Young, unpublished observations). This phenomenon is reminiscent of the reported partial effect of dominant negative TRAF2 on CTAR2-induced NF-κB activation29 and suggests that TRAF2 is a component of LMP1-mediated JNK signalling.

Bifurcation of JNK and NF-κB signals is presumed to occur downstream of TRAF2. Consistent with these findings, A20 has been reported to disrupt the TRADD/TRAF2 complex57 and to inhibit both CTAR2-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation.52 However, the existence of additional molecules which regulate LMP1-induced JNK cannot be excluded. The inability of CTAR1 to engage JNK is intriguing and requires further evaluation. However, it is tempting to speculate that the weak binding of TRAF2 to CTAR1, although sufficient to initiate NF-κB signalling, is unable to engage components of the JNK cascade. These interesting observations and important questions warrant further studies on the molecular interactions and signalling components

involved in LMP1-induced JNK signalling.

In addition to JNK, LMP1 has been recently shown to induce p38 activation in HEK 293 and Rat-1 cells, leading to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF-2, an established p38 target.15 This effect is mediated through both the CTAR1 and CTAR2 domains and involves TRAF2, as a dominant negative N-terminus deleted TRAF2 mutant suppresses LMP1-induced p38 kinase activity *in vitro*. In agreement with the requirement of LMP1 protein oligomerization for efficient NF-κB signalling, Rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing a CD2 (aa 1–212)/LMP1 (aa 192–386) chimera can only induce p38 activation following CD2 receptor cross-linking. Interestingly, p38 and NF-κB signals appear to diverge, presumably downstream of TRAF2, as the chemical inhibitor SB203580, which targets p38, has no effect on LMP1-mediated NF-κB binding activity, and blockade of NF-κB by the metabolic inhibitor D609 does not suppress p38 signalling.15 However, both p38 and NF-κB contribute to the transactivation of certain LMP1-inducible genes, such as IL-6, IL-8 and, more recently, IL-10, through co-regulation of their promoter sequences.15,58

The ability of LMP1 to engage the ERK MAPK pathway is yet inconclusive. Elevated ERK kinase activity has been demonstrated in one LMP1-transfected Rat-1 clone,59 while another study showed that transient expression of LMP1 in HEK 293 cells fails to activate this pathway.53 Activated ERK targets multiple cytoplasmic and nuclear targets, many of which play an important role in the regulation of cell growth and transformation. Thus, it is not surprising that viruses, including EBV,59,60 induce ERK and that tumour cell lines often possess constitutively active ERK signalling either as a result of activating mutations in its upstream kinases and effector molecules, such as Ras, Raf and Tpl-2 or of inactivating mutations targeting ERK phosphatases, such as PP2A. For this reason, caution should be exercised when using established cell lines to study ERK signalling as small but significant effects could be masked by constitutive activity.

### Other LMP1-activated signalling pathways

The JAK/STAT pathway is activated by a number of growth factors and cytokines to regulate transcription and to control diverse cellular functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis and cell surface marker expression. Consistent with the ability of LMP1 to bind JAK3, expression of this viral protein in B cells leads to the rapid increase in STAT1 DNA-binding activity

and this effect maps to the 33bp repeat region.³⁸ Thus, deletion of this domain was found to abolish JAK3 tyrosine phosphorylation whilst re-introduction of the PxxP consensus motif restored JAK3 activity. In these experiments, JNK or NF-κB signalling remained unaffected. Interestingly, a more recent study demonstrates that a fine LMP1 mutant lacking functional CTAR1 and CTAR2 is unable to induce STAT transcriptional activity, despite the presence of an intact 33bp repeat region, perhaps indicating dual regulation of this signalling pathway.⁵⁶ Thus, whilst JAK3 binding to LMP1 controls STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, CTAR1/CTAR2 may be required for other signals leading to serine phosphorylation of STATs and increased transcriptional activity.⁵⁶ Alternatively, it is possible that TRAFs and/or RIP/TRADD may act as critical accessory molecules to facilitate binding of JAK3 to the C-terminus of LMP1. Consistent with this possibility, a physical co-operation between CTAR1 and CTAR2 has been reported,⁶¹ but the ability of LMP1 to interact with JAK3 in the absence of these two key functional domains remains to be determined.

LMP1 expression in serum-starved mouse fibroblasts has been shown to induce dramatic re-organization of their cytoskeleton,⁶² a phenomenon which is known to occur following stimulation with a variety of growth factors and cytokines. We have recently extended this observation to the immortalized but non-tumourigenic SCC12F squamous cell carcinoma cell line carrying a tetracycline-inducible LMP1 (Figure 2). These cytoskeletal changes are known to relate to cell cycle progression, cytokinesis and adhesion and are regulated by members of the Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), such as Rho, Rac and Cdc42. Thus, whilst micro-injection of LMP1 in 3T3 cells was found to induce filopodia formation and actin polymerization, both effects were blocked by a dominant negative Cdc42.⁶² Importantly, this dominant negative molecule failed to inhibit LMP1-induced JNK or NF-κB activation in this cell line, suggesting that activation of small GTPases and NF-κB/JNK signals occur through distinct pathways. Consistent with this notion, micro-injection of TRAFs or TRADD is unable to promote filopodia formation, and deletion of the cytoplasmic C-tail of LMP1 (aa 194–386), which renders it inactive for NF-κB or MAPK signalling, does not influence its effects on cdc42 activation.⁶² These findings also suggest that aggregation of LMP1 on the cell membrane is important for activation

of small GTPases. Whilst the possibility of direct interactions of the LMP1 transmembrane domains with components of Rho/Rac/Cdc42 signalling machinery cannot be excluded, it is tempting to speculate that the reported localization of LMP1 into glycosphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains¹⁸ may indirectly regulate this effect.

### Summary and future prospects

In this paper we have summarized the current knowledge of the signalling pathways activated by the EBV-encoded LMP1. This knowledge emanates from work largely performed in established EBV-negative B cell lines, carcinoma cells and fibroblasts, and emphasizes the importance of the cytoplasmic C-terminus of LMP1 in signal activation. Thus, NF-κB, JNK, p38 and JAK/STAT, but not Cdc42 signalling is mediated entirely through the LMP1 carboxy tail and may account for most of the pleiotropic effects of this key viral protein. Within the C-terminus of LMP1 two functional regions exist, namely CTAR1 and CTAR2, both of which activate the NF-κB, JAK/STAT and p38 MAPK pathways (see Figure 1). However, the unique ability of CTAR1 to promote B cell immortalization points to qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the signals mediated by these LMP1 regions. In this regard, it is of interest that CTAR1 but not CTAR2 can induce the up-regulation of EGF receptor and TRAF1 in certain cell lines.³¹,⁶³ The existence of additional LMP1-activated signals is therefore possible. Our recent work has identified a novel signalling pathway, namely the PI3K/Akt which is engaged by LMP1 and underlines the significance of this effect in the morphological changes associated with LMP1-mediated Rat-1 transformation (Dawson, Eliopoulos and Young, in preparation).

Further analysis is required to understand the complex molecular interactions occurring downstream of CTAR1 and CTAR2. The affinity and avidity of TRAF and TRADD binding to LMP1 and the precise topologies of these interactions need to be addressed and may elucidate important questions related to the function and signalling capacity of CTAR1, CTAR2 and LMP1 as a whole. The molecular mapping of these cascades which are initiated by recruitment of TRAFs and TRADD to LMP1 and lead to activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB, AP-1 and ATF2 will further expand our understanding of the function of LMP1 in different cell types. While the available experimental cell

Figure 2. Inducible expression of LMP1 promotes filopodia formation and actin polymerization. SCC12F squamous cell carcinoma cells carrying a tetracycline-regulatable LMP1 were maintained in tetracycline to repress LMP1 expression ((a),(b)) or induced to express the LMP1 protein by washing out the tetracycline ((c),(d)). Expression of LMP1 was examined by staining with CS.1-4 antibodies and a FITC conjugated secondary antibody ((a),(c)), and cytoskeletal changes were visualized by TRITC-conjugated phalloidin staining ((b),(d)), as previously described.^[62]

systems have been invaluable for these studies, they may however prove insufficient to answer certain key signalling questions. Unlike normal B lymphocytes, for example, many established EBV-negative B cell lines which are routinely used to assess the effects of LMP1 on signal activation, possess constitutive high basal NF-$\kappa$B and MAPK activities. Thus, the regulatory switches and the wiring of LMP1 signalling in these cells may differ from a normal physiological target. Recent studies suggest co-operation of CTAR1 and CTAR2 for the integration of LMP1 signals, as evident by the requirement for CTAR1 and CTAR2 to be in the same oligomeric complex in order to activate NF-$\kappa$B and up-regulate CD54 or IL-10 to wild-type levels.^[58,61] The mechanism of this interesting cross-talk and the conformational requirements for efficient signalling also need to be evaluated. Finally, additional studies are required to determine the contribution of these signalling pathways to the oncogenic properties of LMP1 *in vitro* and *in vivo*.
