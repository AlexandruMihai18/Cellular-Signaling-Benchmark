Summary: In this review, we discuss recent data from our laboratory  
that address two aspects of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  
class I-restricted antigen processing. First, we consider the nature of the  
peptide-loading complex, which is the assembly of proteins in the  
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into which newly synthesized MHC class I-  
β₂ microglobulin (β₂m) heterodimers are incorporated, and the mechan-  
isms involved in MHC class I assembly and peptide loading that are  
facilitated by the peptide-loading complex. Second, we discuss mechan-  
isms of cross-presentation, the phenomenon whereby extracellular and  
luminal protein antigens can be processed by antigen-presenting cells,  
particularly dendritic cells, and presented by MHC class I molecules to  
CD8⁺ T cells. The focus of the discussion is mainly on the human MHC  
class I system.  

The peptide-loading complex  

We have had a general, if mechanistically superficial, under-  
standing of the biosynthesis and assembly of major histocom-  
patibility complex (MHC) class I molecules for a number of  
years (1). The MHC class I heavy chain, a transmembrane  
glycoprotein of approximately 44 kDa, binds upon synthesis  
to the membrane-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  
chaperone, calnexin (CNX). Folding and intrachain disulfide  
bond formation occurs at this stage. Upon dissociation from  
CNX, the heavy chain binds β₂ microglobulin (β₂m) and is  
incorporated into the peptide-loading complex (Fig. 1). The  
other constituents of the complex are the two subunits of the  
transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1 and  
TAP2), the transmembrane glycoprotein tapasin, the soluble  
ER chaperone calreticulin (CRT), and the soluble thiol oxidor-  
eductase ERp57. Peptides are transported into the ER from the  
cytosol via TAP, and, if necessary, they are trimmed by an ER-  
associated aminopeptidase (ERAAP or ERAP1) (2–4) to 8–10  
amino acids, the length that is generally required for associa-  
tion with class I molecules. If the peptide has the appropriate  
sequence, it binds to the MHC class I-β₂m heterodimer,

Fig. 1. Schematic view of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I assembly and loading pathway. The MHC class I heavy chain initially associates with the chaperone calnexin (CNX), initiating folding and disulfide bond formation. Together with β₂ microglobulin (β₂m), it is then incorporated into the peptide-loading complex, which is released from the peptide-loading complex. The fully assembled class I molecule then leaves the ER and travels via the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, where it is accessible to CD8⁺ T cells.

As indicated in Fig. 1, we have a good appreciation of the individual interactions that hold the peptide-loading complex together. Tapasin associates with TAP via its transmembrane domain (5, 6), and tapasin stabilizes the TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer, particularly in the mouse where cellular TAP levels are dramatically reduced in the absence of tapasin (7). There appear to be four tapasin molecules per TAP dimer (8), and tapasin can associate with individual TAP1 or TAP2 molecules in cells lacking the other TAP subunit (9–11). The MHC class I heavy chain interacts with tapasin via a loop in the α₂ domain [best defined by a mutation in residue 134 of human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2)] (12, 13) and by a region in the membrane-proximal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like α₃ domain (14–16). This interaction requires the N-terminal 50 residues of tapasin (5, 6). CRT is a lectin specific for monoglucosylated N-linked glycans (17) that binds to the MHC class I molecule via its carbohydrate side chain (18). It also associates non-covalently with ERp57 in an interaction involving the so-called P-domain, or proline-rich domain, of CRT (19–21). A few years ago, we found an unexpected covalent interaction that holds two loading complex components together; ERp57 and tapasin are connected by a disulfide bond between Cys 95 of tapasin and Cys 57 of ERp57 (22).

Involves TAP, tapasin, CRT, and ERp57. Peptides generated in the cytosol are translocated via TAP into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen where they may be trimmed by ERAP-1 to the correct length of 8–10 amino acids. A peptide of the appropriate sequence binds to the class I molecule, initiating its dissociation from the peptide-loading complex.

The combination of these individual interactions within the peptide-loading complex, some of which are of quite low affinity, e.g., those between CRT and the class I glycan and between CRT and ERp57, provides sufficient overall stability to allow the biochemical purification of the intact assembly.

Tapasin and ERp57 association with the peptide-loading complex

The picture of the peptide-loading complex presented in Fig. 1 is static, representing a metastable intermediate in a dynamic process in which assembled peptide-free MHC class I-β₂m dimers enter the complex and then dissociate as they bind peptides. How is this process regulated, and are the class I molecules the only components that are dynamically associated? What are the core components of the peptide-loading complex that remain together as the class I molecules pass through? Until recently, we believed that the only constants were tapasin and the TAP heterodimer. We now believe that ERp57 is also a core, unchanging, component and that CRT as well as the MHC class I-β₂m dimer cycles through the loading complex during peptide loading. The elements of this hypothetical cycle are presented in Fig. 2.

ERp57 is a disulfide isomerase that cooperates with CRT or CNX in assisting the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins (17). CRT and CNX interact with substrate glycoproteins via their N-linked glycans, which must be in the

Fig. 2. A major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptide-binding cycle. Assembly of the core of the peptide-loading complex, containing TAP and the ERp57–tapasin disulfide-linked conjugate, is shown on the left of the figure, with tapasin associating with TAP prior to oxidation of the Cys 7–Cys 71 internal disulfide bond and prior to formation of the ERp57–tapasin conjugate. MHC class I molecules, together with CRT, bind to the core, peptides bind, and dissociation of the loaded MHC class I-β₂ microglobulin (β₂m) dimer and CRT follows. Deglucosylation of the N-linked glycan of the class I heavy chain is indicated. Additional cycles of MHC class I and CRT binding to the core of the peptide-loading complex then follow.

disulfide bond. The second reduction step, which resolves the mixed disulfide, is referred to as the escape pathway and can be inhibited by mutating the C-terminal Cys residue.

We originally isolated ERp57 as a non-covalently associated component of the loading complex (23). The disulfide linkage to tapasin was later discovered when cells were pretreated with the membrane-permeable sulfhydryl-reactive reagent N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) prior to solubilization in detergent (22). More recently, we found that a second thiol-reactive reagent, methyl methioninethiosulfonate (MMTS), preserves the tapasin–ERp57 conjugate more efficiently. Mutation of Cys 95 of tapasin eliminated both the covalent and noncovalent association of ERp57 with the loading complex.

Cresswell et al · MHC class I assembly and cross-presentation

Mutation of Cys 60 in the C<sub>57</sub>XxC<sub>60</sub> Trx motif of ERp57 to alanine preserved the disulfide bond between tapasin and ERp57 even without the use of NEM, while mutation of Cys 57 eliminated it (22). This finding is consistent with the idea that tapasin and ERp57 are covalently linked via a disulfide bond between Cys 95 of tapasin and Cys 57 of ERp57 and that Cys 60 of ERp57 is responsible for activating the escape pathway to release tapasin, a step which is blocked by its reaction with NEM or MMTS.

Why is the disulfide bond between tapasin and ERp57 not detected in cells unless they are treated with NEM or MMTS? We originally supposed that simple reduction upon detergent extraction, caused by exposing the contents of the ER to the more reducing environment of the cytosol, was responsible. However, if membranes were prepared from cells and separated from the cytosol by centrifugation prior to MMTS treatment, the ERp57–tapasin conjugate was preserved (D. Peaper, manuscript submitted). To our surprise, we found that it is denaturation of the ERp57–tapasin conjugate that breaks the disulfide bond. This does not happen under normal circumstances until the conjugate is separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the very last stage of the analysis. Reduction under these conditions does not require the addition of a reducing agent, but it occurs because denaturation activates the escape pathway, the final step in the disulfide-isomerization reaction described above. This was perhaps best demonstrated using a disulfide-linked conjugate between recombinant soluble tapasin, missing the transmembrane and cytosolic regions, and recombinant ERp57 (D. Peaper, manuscript submitted). This conjugate formed spontaneously in vitro but was disrupted immediately upon denaturation by 8 M urea. The most likely explanation for these results is that formation of the disulfide bond between Cys 95 of tapasin and Cys 57 of the N-terminal Trx motif of ERp57 is spontaneous and that the tapasin interaction with ERp57 inhibits the escape pathway. Perhaps, the C-terminal Cys residue (Cys 60) of the Trx motif is ‘buried’ when tapasin binds so that its sulfhydryl group is unavailable for the required intramolecular reduction step. Denaturation releases this inhibition, exposing Cys 60 and activating the escape pathway. Fig. 3 indicates how this might occur. Adaptation of the ERp57 disulfide-isomerization reaction to provide a stable disulfide bond with tapasin rather than a transient one implies that tapasin has evolved a specific mechanism to trap ERp57. This finding suggests that there must be a significant selective advantage in recruiting ERp57 to the peptide-loading complex.

Our original view was that a stable ERp57 interaction with the peptide-loading complex depended on the recruitment of MHC class I molecules. The major reason for this supposition was that ERp57 association is absent or weak in cells lacking β<sub>2</sub>m that are not treated with NEM or MMTS. In such cells, an interaction of MHC class I heavy chains with the loading complex is barely detectable (5). Even when β<sub>2</sub>m<sup>-</sup> cells are treated with NEM prior to isolation of the loading complex, ERp57–tapasin disulfide linkage is undetectable or dramatically reduced compared to wildtype cells (22). However, when we re-examined this issue using MMTS to pretreat β<sub>2</sub>m<sup>-</sup> or MHC class I<sup>-</sup> cells prior to isolation of the loading complex, we found that all the tapasin in the cells was disulfide-linked to ERp57 (D. Peaper, manuscript submitted). A possible, but untested, reason for this outcome is that the differential reactivity of the Cys 60 residue to MMTS and NEM is exacerbated when MHC class I molecules are not present in the loading complex. The implication of such a finding would be that the tapasin–ERp57 conjugate undergoes a significant conformational change upon MHC class I association.

Pulse-chase labeling analysis showed that conjugation with ERp57 occurs very rapidly after tapasin association with TAP, regardless of the presence of MHC class I-β<sub>2</sub>m dimers. We also found that the formation of the tapasin–ERp57 disulfide bond is independent of CRT and CNX and in fact does not depend at all on the availability of monoglucosylated N-linked glycans (D. Peaper, manuscript submitted). Interestingly, these experiments also revealed that tapasin associates with TAP within a few minutes of synthesis, before it is completely

Native tapasin obstructs access of the second cysteine (60) in the N-terminal ER<sub>p</sub>57 CXXC motif to the first (Cys 57) when the heterodimer is formed. Denaturation relieves the steric inhibition and allows activation of the escape pathway, which breaks the tapasin–ERp57 disulfide bond in the absence of an added reducing agent.
oxidized. We propose that the N-terminal intrachain disulfide bond of tapasin (Cys 7–Cys 71) is formed after binding to TAP, because disruption by mutation of the other disulfide bond, in the membrane-proximal Ig domain, prevents TAP association (24), while disruption of the Cys 7–Cys 71 disulfide bond does not (22). Oxidation of the Cys 7–Cys 71 bond may occur after ERp57 association. Whether or not this is true, these experiments, incorporated in the model presented in Fig. 2, clearly distinguish formation of the ERp57–tapasin–TAP complex from MHC class I and CRT binding, and the overall conclusion is that tapasin is a unique ERp57 substrate. The disulfide bond connecting tapasin and ERp57 is structural rather than transient, even though the ERp57 cysteine residue involved lies within an enzymatically active Trx site that normally plays a role in disulfide isomerization.

Entry of MHC class I molecules and CRT into the peptide-loading complex

CRT and CNX interactions with folding glycoproteins in the ER are generally glycan dependent. Both molecules are lectins with dissociation constants (Kds) in the order of 1–2 μM for substrates with monoglucosylated N-linked glycans (18, 25). One branch of the glycan, initially transferred in the ER to a newly synthesized glycoprotein from a dolichol phosphate-linked precursor, terminates in three glucose residues. Removal of two of the glucose residues by ER glucosidases I and II generates the monoglucosylated glycan, a step which can be inhibited using inhibitors such as castanospermine. In early experiments, where we first demonstrated that CRT was associated with the peptide-loading complex, we showed that the association was inhibited by castanospermine treatment, consistent with the known specificity of CRT–glycan interactions (26). Castanospermine also inhibited the MHC class I interaction with the loading complex. This combination of findings suggested that CRT interacted with the loading complex via an N-linked glycan and that its association was required for stable binding of the MHC class I–β2m heterodimer. Glycan analysis of the two glycoproteins in the loading complex, tapasin and the MHC class I heavy chain, showed that very little of the tapasin N-linked glycan was monoglucosylated, whereas approximately 50% of the class I glycan was in this state (27). The residual class I glycans were of the high-mannose variety. These data suggested that it was the MHC class I molecule, and not tapasin, that was the target for CRT lectin-like binding. More recent data, from experiments in which we have used MMTS to stabilize the complex prior to a more rapid purification step, have shown that virtually all of

the MHC class I heavy chains in the peptide-loading complex have monoglucosylated N-linked glycans (P. Wearsch, manuscript in preparation). These experiments involved a classical analysis of the class I glycan by jack bean mannosidase as well as by a novel approach using CRT–glutathione transferase (GST) fusion proteins in pull-down experiments (P. Wearsch, manuscript in preparation). Nearly all of the MHC class I heavy chains released from the peptide-loading complex upon denaturation could bind to the CRT–GST fusion protein in a glycan-dependent manner.

We studied the interaction of CRT with recombinant MHC class I molecules produced in a mutant yeast strain in which the biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan terminates at the monoglucosylated stage and in which ER glucosidase activity was eliminated. We showed that the in vitro interaction of the class I molecule with recombinant CRT depended upon the N-linked glycan being monoglucosylated but was independent of the assembly and folding status of the class I heavy chain (18). In vivo, however, there is a clear distinction, in that CNX interacts with free class I heavy chains, while CRT interacts with the MHC class I–β2m heterodimer in the context of the loading complex. By using a chemical cross-linker, we have recently found that in the tapasin– cell .220.B8, the endogenous HLA-B8 heavy chain–β2m dimers associate with CRT (P. Wearsch, manuscript in preparation). On the basis of this observation and data from pulse-chase labeling experiments from normal tapasin-positive cells, CRT could interact with an MHC class I–β2m dimer, and the two components could bind to the core of the loading complex (ERp57–tapasin–TAP) together (Fig. 3). The intact loading complex, stabilized by MMTS and purified by affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation, contains equimolar amounts of MHC class I heavy chain, CRT, tapasin, and ERp57 (P. Wearsch, manuscript in preparation).

Peptide loading and MHC class I dissociation from the peptide-loading complex

Having established that the core of the loading complex is a stable scaffold comprised of ERp57, tapasin, and TAP molecules and that MHC class I and CRT reversibly associate with this structure, the major question that remains is what regulates peptide binding and MHC class I release? As described earlier, CRT and ERp57 generally function together to facilitate the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the ER. They are believed to do this in a tightly orchestrated quality control cycle that depends on the affinity of CRT for monoglucosylated glycans (17). CRT (or CNX in the more

Immunological Reviews 207/2005 149generalized form of the model) binds to an unfolded substrate via its lectin-like binding site and recruits ERp57, which facilitates disulfide-bond isomerization by transiently forming mixed disulfides with the substrate. Release of the glycoprotein in the native state either precedes or follows de-glucosylation of the substrate glycan, and the substrate protein exits the ER. Release of the substrate in a misfolded state results in its re-glucosylation by UDP-glucose glycoprotein transferase (UGT), a remarkable enzyme that can discriminate between misfolded and native glycoproteins. Re-glucosylation leads to re-association of the substrate with CRT and ERp57 and further attempts at folding. Repeated entries into this cycle are terminated when excessive mannose removal from the glycan by mannosidases in the ER and cis Golgi prevents re-glucosylation. The glycoprotein is then proteolyzed by proteasomes following translocation into the cytosol. This form of degradation is termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (28). The peptide-loading complex may have co-opted CRT-and ERp57-dependent folding and the UGT-dependent testing mechanism of this quality-control cycle for the purpose of loading optimal peptides into MHC class I molecules. Within the complex, however, we have a unique situation where the glycan interacting with CRT is on a different glycoprotein from that forming a disulfide bond with ERp57. There is, as mentioned above, no evidence that tapasin is folding in a CRT-dependent manner, and the ERp57–tapasin disulfide bond is not the transient enzyme-substrate mixed disulfide associated with isomerization. It appears to be a structural feature like a conventional disulfide bond.

The MHC class I heavy chain has two intrachain disulfide bonds; one is within the membrane-proximal Ig-like domain and the other is within the peptide-binding groove, connecting the α₂ domain α-helix to the β-sheet forming the floor of the groove. Does the peptide-loading complex, particularly ERp57 within it, affect disulfide bond formation within the associated MHC class I molecules? Within the peptide-loading complex, the MHC class I heavy chains are normally completely oxidized. However, mutation of any of three cysteine residues in tapasin results in the accumulation within the loading complex of class I molecules that are partially reduced (22). Two of these cysteines (Cys 7 and Cys 71) form a disulfide bond, while the third (Cys 95) is disulfide linked to tapasin and appears essential for the stable association of ERp57 with the peptide-loading complex. We have suggested that the disulfide bond within the peptide-binding groove of the class I molecule is likely to be the one that is unstable in loading complexes containing the tapasin mutants, and that tapasin and ERp57 together are involved in maintaining the

oxidized status of this bond, likely necessary for peptide binding. Even though the N-terminal Trx motif is permanently involved in the tapasin interaction, there is a second Trx site available in ERp57, and this site could be involved in such a process. However, further studies are needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis.

Is there a role for the de-glucosylation/re-glucosylation cycle in peptide loading? A mechanism in which CRT together with UGT determines whether the MHC class I molecule contains an associated peptide and is therefore correctly folded would be consistent with the normal functions of these molecules. No definitive data in support of this idea are, however, available. As indicated above, it is unclear from published data whether removal of the terminal glucose required for CRT binding could occur while CRT is actually bound to an N-linked glycan. It seems more likely, however, that association with CRT would sterically prevent access of the glucosidase, and therefore the most tenable hypothesis is that CRT should dissociate first. Because of the low affinity of CRT (Kd = approximately 1–2 μM), this dissociation happens readily for most CRT–glycoprotein complexes, so that one can imagine an equilibrium between bound and free CRT, where the glucosidase can act during glycan exposure. However, the interaction of CRT with the purified peptide-loading complex is quite robust, and perhaps because of this we have been unable to enzymatically remove the glucose residues from the N-linked glycans of the MHC class I heavy chains within the loading complex (P. Wearsch, manuscript in preparation).

In summary, the peptide-loading complex, as represented in Figs 1 and 2, is a relatively stable structure, and when purified, the MHC class I molecules are tightly associated. As indicated in Fig. 2, we believe that in vivo the class I molecules dissociate, together with CRT, after binding peptides. To date, however, we have been unable to demonstrate any effects of adding peptides to the purified complex. We see no peptide binding to the MHC class I molecules within the complex, and we cannot induce dissociation of the class I molecules from the complex by peptide addition. Others have reported success in similar or related experiments. For example, Knittler et al. (29) were able to induce dissociation of MHC class I molecules from unpurified peptide-loading complexes containing rat TAP1 and TAP2 molecules by adding peptides to cell extracts. Dissociation was adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent, and the authors suggested a fascinating connection between ATP hydrolysis by TAP and class I loading and dissociation. If confirmed, this finding would suggest that the peptide-loading complex is a molecular machine thatcoordinates peptide translocation into the ER with conformational changes that allow peptide loading to tapasin- and TAP-associated MHC class I molecules and governs their subsequent dissociation from the complex. Detergent-induced structural changes may prevent the required conformational changes from occurring, explaining our inability to replicate the in vivo situation with purified peptide-loading complexes. This remains unknown, and we are unfortunately a long way from understanding how this particular molecular machine works.

### Cross-presentation: exogenous antigens and the MHC class I pathway

It has been known for a number of years that the conventional rule that presentation of exogenous antigens is restricted to MHC class II molecules, while true in general, is not absolute. In primary immune responses, stimulation of naïve CD8⁺ T cells requires costimulatory molecules, such as CD86, that are absent from the majority of cell types. Thus, initiation of a primary CD8⁺ T-cell response to viruses that infect cells lacking such costimulators requires that the viral antigens be processed and presented by costimulator-positive antigen-presenting cells. These cells acquire the viral antigens from the infected cell, predominantly by phagocytosis but perhaps in some cases by receptor-mediated or fluid-phase endocytosis (30, 31). The dominant cell type that can perform this function is the dendritic cell (32), and understanding exactly how dendritic cells do this has been a preoccupation of the antigen-processing field since the early in vivo and in vitro cellular experiments argued that it must happen.

In essence, there are two possible ways in which peptides from exogenous proteins could be made and bound to MHC class I molecules: either they can be generated after internalization by lysosomal proteases and bind to MHC class I molecules recycling through, or delivered to, the endocytic pathway, or the proteins could enter the cytosol and be degraded into peptides, transported by TAP, and associate with MHC class I molecules in the normal way (33). Logic argues that endocytic generation of MHC class I-associated viral peptides is unlikely to explain cross-presentation in general, because for a successful CD8⁺ T-cell response it is essential that the MHC class I-peptide complexes generated by the antigen-presenting cells that prime the T cells are the same as those that are available on the surface of the infected cell. If this was not the case, the T-cell response generated would be useless for clearing the virus from the infected host. Lysosomal proteolysis is a very different process from that responsible for generating conventional MHC class I-associated peptides, which involves proteasomes and additional cytosolic proteases as well as cytosolic and ER-based amino-peptidases. It is unlikely that the two proteolytic systems would reproducibly generate the same peptides from a given protein.

#### Phagosomes and cross-presentation

If the second idea is indeed correct, by what mechanism do exogenous proteins enter the cytosol? A series of observations by Desjardins and colleagues suggested a way in which this might occur for phagocytosed antigens; antigens internalized by phagocytosis have long been known to be much more efficiently cross-presented than those internalized by fluid-phase endocytosis. These workers were initially interested in determining the protein composition of phagosomes. Using a mouse macrophage cell line and latex beads as a phagocytic substrate, they were able to purify phagosomes from homogenized cells by flotation in a sucrose gradient (latex beads are buoyant, making the phagosomes containing them lighter than normal cellular membranes). They were then able to separate phagosomal proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis and identify them using tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, they found ER proteins in early phagosomes. During phagosomal maturation, these proteins were degraded and replaced by lysosomal proteins, presumably during phagosome–lysosome fusion (34). Later they went on to suggest that the ER was a membrane donor when phagocytosis was initiated; in electron microscopic studies, the ER marker enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase was found surrounding phagocytosed particles and was even present in the ‘phagocytic cup’ formed upon initiation of phagocytosis (35). Green fluorescent protein-tagged ER markers, such as CNX, have been observed in phagosomes from the slime mold Dictostelium discoides, arguing that ER-mediated phagocytosis might be an evolutionarily ancient phenomenon (36). The likely presence of ER components in phagosomal membranes suggested to three laboratories, including ours and that of Desjardins, a potential mechanism whereby phagocytosed proteins could gain access to the cytosol and therefore the MHC class I antigen-processing machinery. This is the ERAD system, introduced earlier, which is used for the degradation of misfolded ER proteins.

Retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins from the ER into the cytosol for proteasomal degradation was first observed in mammalian cells, and the substrates, ironically enough, were MHC class I molecules. Cells expressing theCresswell et al · MHC class I assembly and cross-presentation

human cytomegalovirus proteins US2 or US11 were shown to lose expression of MHC class I molecules, because the former specifically target the latter for retrotranslocation into the cytosol (37, 38). There they are deglycosylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded by proteasomes. Subsequently, we showed that free MHC class I heavy chains in β₂m⁻ cells as well as MHC class I molecules in TAP⁻ cells that fail to load with peptides are degraded by a similar mechanism (23). Considerable work in both mammalian cells and yeast has established that this pathway, now referred to as ERAD, is the normal way for proteins confined to the ER to be degraded.

The nature of the retrotranslocation apparatus used to transfer misfolded glycoproteins from the ER to the cytosol is currently under debate, and in fact may differ depending on the substrate protein. Work in yeast, using temperature-sensitive mutants of Sec61, suggested that this multicomponent channel, used for the import into the ER of proteins synthesized on membrane-associated ribosomes, is also the channel used for export during ERAD (39, 40). Recently, other candidate channel components have been described, including the protein Derlin-1 that interacts with US2-associated, but not US11-associated, MHC class I heavy chains during their retrotranslocation into the cytosol (41, 42). The yeast homolog of Derlin-1 is also implicated in ERAD (43). From the point of view of the arguments raised here, the precise nature of the channel is less critical than the likelihood that, when ER membrane is recruited to the phagosome, the channel would be incorporated into the phagosomal membrane. This provides a readymade mechanism for export of proteins present in the phagosome into the cytosol. Once achieved, the other requirements for cross-presentation of exogenous protein antigens by MHC class I molecules fall naturally into place. Proteasomes would degrade the protein, TAP would transport the derived peptides into the ER, and appropriate peptides would bind to MHC class I molecules that would then be transported to the cell surface and be recognized by CD8⁺T cells.

The data in support of this hypothesis are indirect. Sec61 components are present in purified phagosomes from dendritic cells (44), and we have recently also found Derlin-1 in them (Ackerman and Cresswell, unpublished results). Proteasomes and ubiquitinated proteins have also been found associated with phagosomes (45). However, no definitive experiment showing controlled export of internalized proteins from phagosomes to cytosol has been published, although experiments have been described arguing that dextran can be (46), nor has a clear demonstration of the possible export mechanism. Support for the hypothesis comes from corollary evidence, namely that after export of protein antigens from the phagosome into the cytosol, peptides derived from them can be translocated back into phagosomes by TAP. We and others showed that TAP and the other components of the peptide-loading complex as well as ERAP-1 are also present in purified phagosomes (44, 45, 47). We demonstrated that TAP is functional in purified phagosomes, capable of translocating radiolabeled peptides, and that the translocated peptides could bind to MHC class I molecules associated with the phagosome. This finding led us and other groups to suggest that phagosomes might be a specialized organelle capable of mediating cross-presentation without the involvement of the normal ER. Amigorena and coworkers (44) provided perhaps the best evidence for this idea when they demonstrated that phagosomes containing ovalbumin (OVA) also contained MHC class I molecules with a bound OVA-derived peptide, while phagosomes in the same cell containing bovine serum albumin did not. This concept has been previously reviewed (48) and is discussed in other articles in this volume. It will not be further considered here.

Pinocytosis, endocytosis, and cross-presentation

We extended our studies of cross-presentation by dendritic cells to antigens internalized by fluid-phase mechanisms, initially suspecting that macropinosomes, which can serve as an efficient vehicle for cross-presentation (49), might recruit ER membrane in a similar manner to phagosomes. Indeed, immunofluorescence experiments suggested that some macropinosomes in dendritic cells contain CNX (47). To study cross-presentation of fluid-phase antigens, we made use of a recombinant soluble version of the product of a human cytomegalovirus immune-evasion gene called US6. US6 is normally an ER-retained transmembrane glycoprotein that blocks peptide translocation by TAP (50–52). A truncated soluble version was also found to block TAP when expressed in human cells or when incorporated as a purified protein into liposomes containing TAP, arguing that US6 prevents peptide translocation by interacting with TAP in the lumen of the ER (51, 53). We reasoned that if TAP in macropinosomes was being used to load cross-presented peptides onto MHC class I molecules in dendritic cells, soluble US6 supplied externally and mixed with a soluble antigen should block cross-presentation of the latter, because it would prevent peptides generated in the cytosol from being imported back into the macropinosome by TAP. Because US6 is inactive on mouse TAP, we used a human cell line with many of the properties of dendritic cells, called KG-1, in which we stably expressed the

We indeed found that KG-1.K<sup>b</sup> cells could cross-present soluble OVA to the T-cell hybridoma B3Z, specific for K<sup>b</sup> plus the OVA peptide SIINFEKL, and that presentation was blocked by the simultaneous addition of soluble US6 (47). We confirmed this result by flow cytometry analysis, using the 25D1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complex as a fluorescent-detection agent. We also added soluble US6 to dendritic cells together with latex beads, purified the phagosomes containing the beads, and showed that US6 was non-covalently associated with TAP by solubilizing the phagosomes and performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments. All of these experiments indicated that exogenous soluble US6 could indeed enter a cellular compartment that contains TAP, putatively macropinosomes.

A consequence of expressing US6 in human cells is that MHC class I expression on the surface of the cell is dramatically reduced (51, 52). MHC class I–β<sub>2</sub>m dimers are continuously being loaded with peptides from cytosolic proteins, and inhibition of TAP function prevents this loading. Class I molecules without bound peptides are considered misfolded by the ER-quality control system. They are unstable, fail to leave the ER, and are degraded by ERAD. We reasoned that if US6 added to dendritic cells blocks TAP function exclusively in macropinosomes and if MHC class I loading in these compartments is a constitutive process as it is in the ER, we should be able to estimate the percentage of MHC class I molecules loaded by this pathway by measuring the effect of exogenous US6 on surface MHC class I expression. When this experiment was performed, we were surprised to find that surface MHC class I expression was reduced dramatically. For human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, downregulation ranged from 60 to 90% when they were incubated overnight at 37° with soluble US6 (54, 55). For KG-1 cells, there was an approximate 50% reduction in HLA class I surface expression. The effect was specific for MHC class I molecules; no effect was observed on surface expression of MHC class II molecules or transferrin receptors. The effect was also specific for dendritic cells; no downregulation was seen in peripheral blood-derived macrophages or B lymphocytes. In the case of B cells, we assume that this result is because they are poorly endocytic compared to dendritic cells. For macrophages, we showed that although they initially internalize US6 as well as dendritic cells, they rapidly degrade it. This result is consistent with the observations of Delamarre et al. (56) on the relative proteolytic activities of the endocytic pathways of dendritic cells and macrophages, and we suggest that rapid proteolysis may

Cresswell et al. · MHC class I assembly and cross-presentation prevent access of sufficient US6 to the TAP molecules of the macrophage to efficiently prevent peptide translocation.

The surprisingly efficient downregulation of surface MHC class I expression on dendritic cells by exogenous US6 made us question our original assumptions regarding the role in cross-presentation of TAP present in macropinosomes. Adding to the quandary was a quantitative analysis of the amount of TAP we could actually detect in phagosomes; at best only approximately 10% of total cellular TAP could be recruited to a latex bead-containing phagosomal preparation. This percentage is far less than the percentage downregulation of surface MHC class I molecules induced by soluble US6 in dendritic cells, and ER membrane is certainly more efficiently recruited to phagosomes than it is to macropinosomes. These data therefore led us to the hypothesis that US6, rather than simply blocking TAP in endocytic pathways, was actually capable of reaching the lumen of the ER. This model is schematically presented in Fig. 4.

ER access of exogenous proteins in dendritic cells

Accessibility of exogenous proteins and peptides to the ER is not a totally novel concept. Some viruses, for example SV-40, are transported to the ER after internalization into caveolae at the plasma membrane (57). Certain toxins that act in the cytosol, such as cholera toxin, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* exotoxin, as well as the plant toxin ricin, are transported after endocytosis via the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the ER, where they then enter the cytosol, presumably by the same channel(s) involved in the ERAD pathway (58, 59). The transport process may be inefficient, but cells are sensitive even to the few molecules of the imported toxins that reach the cytosol. However, the level of access to the ER of US6 in dendritic cells would have to be reasonably high, sufficient to block the majority of the total TAP transporters present.

Could we provide evidence for this hypothesis? We have made a number of attempts to persuade endocytosed exogenous macromolecules to localize to the ER in such a way that they could be detected by immunofluorescence. We were unable to do this with fluorescent standard proteins such as OVA. We reasoned that this inability might be because of dilution of the proteins within the ER, transport back through the secretory pathway if they indeed reach the ER, degradation by ERAD, or simply because the process is too inefficient. Alternatively, the proteins might be too readily degraded in the endocytic pathway by dendritic cells, as we surmise is the problem with US6 in macrophages. In trying to choose the optimal system for looking at this issue, we settled on β<sub>2</sub>m as

Cresswell et al · MHC class I assembly and cross-presentation

Fig. 4. A schematic representation of two experimental results that argue that dendritic cells allow exogenous protein antigen's access to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently to the cytosol. On the left, a soluble antigen, OVA, is cointernalized with a soluble version of the TAP inhibitor US6. Both enter the ER, whereupon OVA is retrotranslocated into the cytosol and degraded into peptides by the proteasome. Re-entry of the OVA-derived peptides for loading onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules is prevented, because the cointernalized US6 binds to TAP and blocks peptide translocation. On the right, $\beta_2$ microglobulin ($\beta_2$m) is internalized and binds to free MHC class I heavy chains present in the ER of a $\beta_2$m$^-$ dendritic cell. This permits MHC class I assembly and incorporation into the peptide-loading complex. Peptides from OVA expressed in the cytosol transported by TAP can now bind to the MHC class I heterodimers, which have incorporated the exogenously supplied $\beta_2$m.

a possible candidate. $\beta_2$m is small (approximately 12 kDa), and, being a single Ig family C-type domain, it is also highly resistant to proteolysis. Furthermore, we expected that if we supplied $\beta_2$m to bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from $\beta_2$m-knockout mice, it might transiently accumulate in the ER by binding to MHC class I heavy chains being synthesized there, making its detection more likely. This approach was successful. Human $\beta_2$m visibly accumulated in the ER of mouse $\beta_2$m$^-$ dendritic cells within 3 h of incubation at 37°C, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence (55). We were also able to show by radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation experiments that H2-K$^b$ heavy chains present in the ER, determined by their sensitivity to the enzyme endoglycosidase H, bound the added $\beta_2$m.

An additional observation we made was that the addition of human $\beta_2$m to $\beta_2$m$^-$ mouse dendritic cells induced the expression of MHC class I molecules on the surface. Significant surface expression was not induced on $\beta_2$m$^-$ macrophages. In the absence of $\beta_2$m, MHC class I molecules fail to assemble with peptides in the ER, are not exported to the plasma membrane, and are not recognized by CD8$^+$ T cells. The induction of surface expression when $\beta_2$m is added exogenously implies that assembly and transport is being restored, which in turn suggests that MHC class I function, i.e. peptide binding, might be restored. Indeed, when we supplied $\beta_2$m$^-$ mouse dendritic cells with exogenous $\beta_2$m and infected them with recombinant vaccinia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing OVA, we were able to restore the ability of the dendritic cells to be recognized by a T-cell hybridoma specific for the K$^b$-SIINFEKL epitope (55). In other words, we restored the ability of the cells to perform classical processing and presentation of a cytosolic protein antigen by adding $\beta_2$m from the outside (Fig. 4). This experiment lent strong immunological support to the immunofluorescence and biochemical data that showed that exogenous $\beta_2$m could access the lumen of the ER in dendritic cells.

The finding that exogenous $\beta_2$m could enter the ER gave us confidence in our hypothesis that soluble US6 caused such a

dramatic downregulation of MHC class I surface expression in human dendritic cells because it can also enter the ER. If this prevents peptide translocation into the ER via TAP, then an obvious prediction is that soluble US6 should not only prevent cross-presentation but also should prevent classical MHC class I-restricted presentation of cytosolic antigens. We tested this hypothesis using the same recombinant viruses expressing OVA that we used for the experiments with the mouse β₂m⁻ dendritic cells and human β₂m. In these experiments, we infected the human KG-1.Kᵇ cells introduced earlier, again because US6 does not inhibit peptide transport by mouse TAP. The results were conclusive; exogenous soluble US6 could completely prevent the presentation of virally expressed OVA by the KG-1.Kᵇ cells, measured both by the T-cell hybridoma assay and by the expression of the Kᵇ-SIINFEKL epitope measured by the 25D1 monoclonal antibody (55).

Direct ER access and cross-presentation

We now have two examples of proteins that can enter the ER of dendritic cells from the outside: β₂m, which can be directly demonstrated, and US6, which can be inferred. The precise route is unknown. It seems likely that macropinocytosis initiates the process, because it does not happen in lymphocytes, which do not indulge in macropinocytosis. Further work is clearly required to establish this route. Both of these proteins interact with ER components: MHC class I heavy chains confined to the ER in the case of β₂m, and TAP in the case of US6. Conceivably, some kind of receptor-ligand interaction may facilitate the process. For example, our original idea that ER membranes can fuse with the macropinosome remains a possibility. A cycle could be imagined in which ER membrane fuses with macropinosomal membranes, delivering class I heavy chain and TAP molecules, which are then retrieved. Data from Desjardins and colleagues (35) suggest that such a phenomenon can be observed with ER and phagosomal membranes. However, the observations do suggest that soluble antigens could also directly access the ER of dendritic cells, explaining the ability of these cells to cross-present them to CD8⁺ T cells. The ERAD retrotranslocation pathway(s) would

be available, allowing antigen entry into the cytosol, and, as described earlier for the proposed phagosome to cytosol pathway, the rest of the MHC class I antigen-processing machinery then becomes immediately accessible. Suggestive evidence that OVA interacts with Sec61 in the ER has in fact been published (60).

How significant is this process likely to be? Phagocytosis is certainly more efficient than endocytosis in inducing cross-presentation, and this fact suggests that fluid-phase entry of foreign antigens into dendritic cells may not be particularly important for priming a CD8⁺ T-cell response. It may, however, be important for the maintenance of tolerance; soluble components, proteins in serum and lymph, for example, may continuously be fluxing through immature dendritic cells in the thymus and in peripheral tissues, so that peptides derived from them are continuously presented to CD8⁺ T cells. This presentation may tolerate such T cells, preventing incidental priming to such proteins when they are co-internalized with genuine foreign antigens during an infection. This possibility currently remains unknown.

Concluding remarks

MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation to T cells is the end result of an extremely complicated series of events. Many aspects of cell biology impact the process, including cytoplasmic proteolysis of perhaps a subset of imperfect translation products (61, 62), the ATP-dependent translocation of peptides into the ER by a dedicated transporter, and an adaptation, still only partially understood, of the quality-control processes involved in glycoprotein folding in the ER. When cross-priming and cross-presentation by dendritic cells are included in the mix, then we also have to consider mechanisms of phagocytosis and endocytosis, coupled with an ill-defined pathway that allows access of exogenous proteins to the ER. All these processes are critically intertwined with antigen-processing pathways. Perhaps, it is not surprising that we still do not understand all the details of these pathways and mechanisms. It is clear that much more work will be required before we do.
