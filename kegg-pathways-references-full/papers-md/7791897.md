# The synaptic vesicle cycle: a cascade of protein–protein interactions

**Thomas C. Südhof**

The synaptic vesicle cycle at the nerve terminal consists of vesicle exocytosis with neurotransmitter release, endocytosis of empty vesicles, and regeneration of fresh vesicles. Of all cellular transport pathways, the synaptic vesicle cycle is the fastest and the most tightly regulated. A convergence of results now allows formulation of molecular models for key steps of the cycle. These developments may form the basis for a mechanistic understanding of higher neural function.

SYNAPTIC transmission is the currency of information exchange in the brain. Billions of neurons each form thousands of synapses, each of which in turn is independently regulated. The resulting complexity vastly surpasses, for example, the complexity of the human genome. From this apparent chaos emerges the pristine order of information processing by the brain. The organizing principles that govern synaptic transmission are now coming into view.

The key event in the synaptic vesicle (SV) cycle is exocytosis by membrane fusion. Membrane fusion occurs by a similar mechanism in organisms from yeast to man, and in organelles from the nuclear envelope to SVs¹². The special needs of a synapse, however, create unique requirements. Synaptic transmission requires a localized and rapid signal that can be repeated at high frequency and up- or downregulated with time³. These needs are satisfied by three unique events in the cycle: (1) before exocytosis, SVs are predocked at a specialized area of the presynaptic plasma membrane called the active zone; (2) the probability that a single docked SV will undergo exocytosis in response to Ca²⁺ is low and can be modulated over a wide range; and (3) after exocytosis, SVs quickly undergo endocytosis and recycle locally close to the site of exocytosis.

These properties require a level of control over the fusion process that is more complex than is observed in other fusion events. Insight into the special features of the SV cycle have recently been gained from four major approaches: (1) study of synaptic protein–protein interactions; (2) study of mechanisms by which botulinum and tetanus toxins inhibit neurotransmitter release; (3) study of invertebrate preparations with disrupted SV traffic; and (4) study of mutations in mice induced by the 'gene knockout' technology. The current review explores the implications of these studies for the molecular steps underlying SV traffic.

## The synaptic vesicle cycle

The SV cycle can be divided into 9 steps (Fig. 1).

(1) Docking. SVs that are filled with neurotransmitters dock at the active zone. Docking, defined as the initial contact between the membranes, occurs only at the active zone opposite to the synaptic cleft, implicating a targeting process.

(2) Priming. After docking, SVs go through a maturation process that makes them competent for fast Ca²⁺-triggered membrane fusion. Such a priming step is suggested by three observations: first, the speed of Ca²⁺-triggered SV exocytosis which is too fast for a complex multistep reaction⁴; second, most of the docked SVs cannot be triggered to fuse by Ca²⁺ immediately and therefore appear to be not yet competent to fuse⁵⁷; and third, during extensive repetitive stimulation, SV exocytosis slows down before the number of docked SVs declines⁸. These results suggest that docking is not rate limiting and that SVs are not immediately competent to fuse after docking and need to go through a rate-limiting priming step. Priming may initiate exocytosis by executing a partial fusion process. At this point SVs arrest, awaiting a Ca²⁺ signal.

(3) Fusion/exocytosis. Primed SVs are stimulated for rapid fusion/exocytosis by a Ca²⁺ spike during an action potential. Although Ca²⁺-triggered exocytosis requires less than 0.3 ms (ref. 4), Ca²⁺ triggering is inefficient: only one of many docked SVs fuses, and only one in every three to ten action potentials leads to exocytosis⁵⁻⁷.

(4) Endocytosis. Empty SV membranes are rapidly internalized, probably by way of clathrin-coated pits which become coated vesicles⁹.

(5) Translocation. Coated vesicles shed their coats, acidify and translocate into the interior, becoming recycling SVs.

(6) Endosome fusion. Recycling SVs fuse with early endosomes, as suggested by the high content in SVs of rab5, an endosomal marker, and by the labelling of synaptic endosomes with soluble markers during stimulation⁹,¹⁰.

(7) Budding. SVs are regenerated primarily by budding from endosomes.

(8) Neurotransmitter uptake. SVs accumulate neurotransmitters by active transport driven by an electrochemical gradient created by a proton pump.

(9) Translocation. SVs filled with neurotransmitters translocate back to the active zone either by diffusion or by a cytoskeleton-based transport process.

The entire SV cycle takes approximately 1 min¹¹,¹². Exocytosis/fusion occurs in less than 1 ms, endocytosis in less than 5 s, and the remaining 55 s are used for the other steps of the cycle. The SV cycle resembles other transport pathways that shuttle membranes between the cell surface and endosomes, in particular receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, the SV cycle is unique in its speed and its tight regulation.

Selected properties of central synapses are summarized in Box 1. Although SVs are heterogeneous in size, there is no heterogeneity in function, as revealed by direct observation of recycling SVs using fluorescent dyes¹¹. The paucity of cytoskeletal elements close to the active zone indicates that SVs translocate by diffusion¹³, although the cytoskeleton could have an important regulatory role. In the nerve terminal, free SVs are linked into clusters by thin strands. The strands were originally thought to be composed of the SV protein synapsin I, but are also present in ribbon synapses which lack synapsins¹⁴, suggesting that they are made up of a different protein.

The entire SV cycle takes place locally in nerve terminals. This autonomy allows synapses to function at long distances from the cell body, a prerequisite for fast exocytosis and recycling. For example, the synapses of spinal cord neurons that innervate calf muscles are 1 m from the cell body, a distance that would take weeks to cover by organelle transport. The autonomy of nerve terminals makes it possible to regulate different synapses.

of the same neuron independently. This forms the basis for the selective modulation of subsets of synapses¹⁵, a process that integrates synaptic circuits.

The small size and simple protein composition of SVs has allowed their detailed characterization. The proteins of SVs can be divided into two functional classes: proteins involved in the uptake of neurotransmitters (transport proteins), and proteins that mediate SV membrane traffic, such as docking, fusion and budding (trafficking proteins)¹⁶. The structures of the major trafficking proteins of SVs are depicted in Fig. 2. A glossary of the proteins of SVs and their interacting partners at the synapse is given in Box 2. Major insights into the functions of synaptic proteins have been gained by studies of mutations and of toxins, which are summarized in Box 3. Although most SV proteins are specific for SVs, they contain no common motif that would suggest a sorting mechanism. Confusingly, but interestingly, SV proteins are present in multiple isoforms that are differentially expressed in subsets of neurons. No two protein families show the same distributions, and there is no correlation between their distributions and known functional differences of synapses.

**Rab3 function in exocytosis**

Rab proteins (rabs) are GTP-binding proteins of low molecular mass which direct membrane traffic¹⁷,¹⁸. So far, more than 30 rabs have been identified. SVs contain at least two major rab families: rab3A and 3C, which are specific for SVs and secretory granules¹⁹, and rab5, which is required for endosome fusion in all cells²⁰. Rab3A is the most abundant rab protein in the brain, accounting for approximately 25% of its rab GTP-binding capacity²¹. Although most neurons express rab3A, a subpopulation of neurons also synthesizes high levels of rab3C (ref. 22).

At the carboxy terminus, rab3 and other rabs contain two hydrophobic geranylgeranyl groups that tightly attach them to membranes. Nevertheless, a sizeable fraction of rab3 in brain is present in the cytosol, where it is complexed with GDI, an abundant protein that binds to most rabs in the GDP-bound state²³. These findings suggest the model shown in Fig. 3: at rest, SVs contain GTP-bound rab3. When rab3 function is stimulated, its GTP is hydrolysed to GDP. GDP-rab3 is removed from the SV membrane by GDI, and rebound to new SVs under GDP-GTP exchange.

The tight regulation of membrane transport in the nerve terminal made it possible to test this model. Triggering of SV exocytosis led to the dissociation of rab3A and rab3C from SVs¹⁹ and dramatically increased the GDP:GTP ratio of rab3A (ref. 24). These findings indicated a role for rab3 in SV exocytosis, and it was surprising to find that rab3A knockout mice have no fundamental defects in SV exocytosis²¹. Synapses from rab3A-deficient mice released neurotransmitters normally when stimulated. However, when rab3A-deficient synapses were stimulated repetitively they exhibited profound synaptic depression. Thus rab3A is not essential for docking or fusion of SVs. However, rab3A is required to maintain a normal reserve of SVs for accelerated exocytosis during repetitive stimulation when SV recycling becomes rate limiting.

The action of rab3s during repetitive stimulation may be performed in collaboration with another SV protein, rabphilin-3A, which binds rab3A and rab3C in a GTP-dependent manner²²,²⁵. In rab3A-deficient mice the levels of rabphilin-3A are decreased by more than 70%, but only in the synapses of neurons that do not make rab3C. In these neurons, rabphilin-3A remains in the cell bodies and is degraded, whereas neurons that contain rab3C transport rabphilin-3A to nerve terminals²². Thus a major function of rab3A and rab3C may be to recruit rabphilin-3A to SVs where rabphilin-3A could act as an effector for rab3s (Fig. 3).

**Priming vesicles for fusion**

A convergence of recent results from biochemical and genetic studies²⁶⁻³⁰ allows formulation of a model which, although incomplete, may approximate the molecular events in SV exocytosis (Fig. 4). According to this model, SVs dock and then proceed through a partial fusion reaction, priming, to make them

competent for the final Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered step. During priming, a complex called the core complex is assembled by three abundant synaptic proteins, two from the plasma membrane (syntaxin and SNAP-25) and one from SVs (synaptobrevin/VAMP). The core complex forms the anchor for a cascade of protein-protein interactions required for exocytosis to occur.

Syntaxin and SNAP-25 bind tightly to each other and form a high-affinity binding site for synaptobrevin/VAMP. The resulting core complex has a 1:1:1 stoichiometry and is SDS resistant<sup>27</sup>. Under steady-state conditions, most syntaxin, synaptobrevin and SNAP-25 in the nerve terminal are not assembled together. Synaptobrevin is largely bound to synaptophysin, an SV protein<sup>31–33</sup>. At least some of the syntaxin is bound to munc18 (ref. 34) (also called n-sec1<sup>35</sup> and rb-sec1<sup>36</sup>) over the entire plasma membrane.

Munc18 is the mammalian homologue of the proteins encoded by the *Caenorhabditis elegans unc-18* and the *Drosophila rop* genes and is distantly related to the yeast SEC1, SLY1 and SLP1 proteins<sup>34–36</sup>. Mutations in the *Drosophila* and *C. elegans* munc18 homologues lead to severe synaptic defects, suggesting an essential function of munc18 in SV exocytosis<sup>37,38</sup>. One of the functions of the munc18/syntaxin and the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin interactions may be to inhibit the formation of the synaptic core complex which would otherwise assemble spontaneously and indiscriminately outside the active zone<sup>27</sup>. Binding of munc18 to syntaxin inhibits its interaction with SNAP-25 (ref. 29), and the interaction of synaptophysin with synaptobrevin is incompatible with the binding of synaptobrevin to the SNAP-25/syntaxin complex<sup>33</sup>. This suggests that synaptophysin and munc18 have to dissociate from synaptobrevin and syntaxin, respectively, before the core complex can assemble.

After SV docking, munc18 probably dissociates from syntaxin, and synaptophysin from synaptobrevin (Fig. 4a, b). This allows assembly of the synaptic core complex, which spontaneously transforms into an SDS-resistant conformation (Fig. 4c, d)<sup>27</sup>. The phenotype of the munc18 mutants in *Drosophila* and *C. elegans* suggests that munc18 is important in the assembly<sup>38</sup>. Munc18 may collaborate with rab3 and/or other rab proteins to ensure that the synaptic core complex is assembled only at the active zone. This hypothesis is suggested by genetic interactions between homologues for these proteins in yeast<sup>39,40</sup>, and by the similarity between rab3A-deficient mice and *Drosophila*

† Neurexin Iα constitutes a high-affinity cell-surface receptor for α-latrotoxin which binds α-latrotoxin in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner but α-latrotoxin also stimulates release in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, making it unclear if neurexin Iα constitutes the receptor responsible for release.

overexpressing the munc18-homologue rop. Both of these exhibit a synaptic depression during repetitive stimulation which is indicative of a defect in docking and fusion of SVs<sup>21,41</sup>.

Once the trimeric core complex has assembled, it serves as a receptor for SNAP and NSF (SNARE)<sup>26,30</sup> (Fig. 4e, f). NSF is a N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase with a universal function in membrane fusion<sup>42</sup>. α-, β- and γ-SNAPs are soluble NSF-attachment proteins that are not related to SNAP-25 (see Box 2) (ref. 43). Synaptobrevin, syntaxin and SNAP-25 were affinity purified on immobilized α-SNAP (ref. 26), but individually bind only weakly to α-SNAP. Only their assembly into the core complex results in the formation of a high-affinity binding site for α-SNAP<sup>30</sup> which in turn creates a receptor site for NSF. As a trimer, NSF then probably multimerizes core complexes and disrupts them under ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4g)<sup>28,42</sup>. Thus an ordered sequence of protein-protein interactions leads to the assembly of a multimeric complex that is then disrupted by the enzymatic activity of NSF.

### Inhibition of priming by toxins

Botulinum and tetanus toxins enter nerve terminals and irreversibly inhibit SV exocytosis, thereby incapacitating the victim. The toxins are proteases, each of which cleaves a single target at a single site. Of eight toxins, five digest synaptobrevin, two SNAP-25 and one syntaxin<sup>44,45</sup>. Even although the eight different toxins are homologous to each other, their target proteins are not. Moreover, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin are cleaved by multiple toxins at distinct sites that are not similar.

Protein cleavages by different toxins exert distinct effects on the formation of the synaptic core complex. The cleavages either sever one of the membrane anchors of the core complex, block its assembly, or inhibit its transformation into an SDS-resistant form<sup>27</sup>. This suggests that the formation of the synaptic core complex is essential for SV exocytosis. The core complex bridges the space between SVs and the plasma membrane, suggesting that the interactions between syntaxin, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin may determine the specificity of docking (the SNARE hypothesis<sup>46</sup>). However, nerve terminals poisoned by botulinum or tetanus toxins exhibit a normal morphology with slightly increased, not decreased, numbers of docked SVs, despite low levels of continued release<sup>47,48</sup>, and the distribution of syntaxin and SNAP-25 show little specificity for the site of exocytosis, the active zone<sup>49</sup>. Thus the primary function of the core complex seems to be SV fusion and not docking.

Several observations suggest that NSF disrupts the core complex under ATP hydrolysis before the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered final fusion step. In adrenal chromaffin cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis does not require ATP initially, but ‘priming’ of continuous exocytosis does<sup>50</sup>. ATP-independent exocytosis is not inhibited by tetanus or botulinum A toxin, but ATP-primed exocytosis is blocked<sup>51</sup>. Furthermore, the components of the core complex can only be cleaved by tetanus or botulinum toxins before assembly, but not in the complex<sup>27</sup>. Thus a model emerges whereby SVs are first docked by an unidentified mechanism that generates specificity, are then primed in a partial fusion reaction that involves assembly of the synaptic core complex and its disruption by NSF, and are finally triggered to fuse by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 4).

The synaptic core complex probably consists of a stable coiled-coil structure<sup>27</sup>. Why is such a tight complex first assembled and then disrupted? It is possible that the disruption of multimerized core complexes by NSF takes the fusion reaction up to the point of hemifusion, a state where one of the two leaves of the bilayer has fused. Recent experiments using mutant influenza haemagglutinin demonstrated that hemifusion states are stable<sup>52</sup>. This speculative hemifusion state is drawn in Fig. 4h as mediated by synaptobrevin, which has a highly amphipathic amino-terminal sequence resembling fusion peptides of viral fusion proteins. Hemifused SVs at the active zone would allow fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion because half of the fusion reaction would already have been completed.

### Synaptotagmins

SVs are docked close to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the active zone. This arrangement facilitates rapid exocytosis by high local concentration.

tions of Ca²⁺ during an action potential. However, signal transduction leading to exocytosis is inefficient. On average, 3 to 10 pulses of Ca²⁺ are required to trigger the exocytosis of a single SV, although 10 to 30 SVs are docked at most synapses at any given time⁵⁻⁷. The probability of exocytosis exhibits a nonlinear dependence on the Ca²⁺ concentration with an apparent cooperativity of 4 (ref. 53).

To trigger the final stage of the fusion reaction, a Ca²⁺ sensor is required at the site of exocytosis. This sensor must bind Ca²⁺ cooperatively and undergo a Ca²⁺-dependent conformational change. If this Ca²⁺ sensor could be identified, it would give the first mechanistic clue to the regulation of the fusion reaction.

Five lines of evidence suggest that synaptotagmins function as such sensors in the final fusion step. (1) Biochemically, synaptotagmins are SV proteins that bind Ca²⁺ cooperatively and undergo a Ca²⁺-dependent conformational change⁵⁴⁻⁵⁶. (2) In synaptotagmin-I knockout mice, Ca²⁺-dependent neurotransmitter release is severely impaired⁵⁷. The fast, synchronous component of Ca²⁺-triggered release is inhibited, but the slow, asynchronous component is unimpaired. (3) In the synaptotagmin-I knockouts, release can still be triggered normally by agents that act by Ca²⁺-independent mechanisms, such as hypertonic sucrose or α-latrotoxin⁵⁷. However, in nerve terminals poisoned by tetanus and botulinum A toxins, the response to

FIG. 3 The rab3 cycle. GTP-bound rab3A or rab3C (rab3A/C) associates with SVs (top). SVs then bind rabphilin-3A (left). When GTP is hydrolysed to GDP, rabphilin-3A dissociates from rab3 (bottom; it is uncertain if rabphilin-3A physically dissociates from SVs). GTP hydrolysis is shown here to be associated with docking, but rab3A function in SV traffic could also occur at a later stage of the cycle. After GTP hydrolysis, GDI binds to GDP-rab3 and removes it from the membrane (bottom middle). The Rab3-GDP/GDI complex reassociates with SVs at an unknown stage of the pathway (top), resulting in GDP/GTP exchange and dissociation of GDI. Thus the rab3 cycle contains four nested cycles that are identified by different colours: the SV cycle (blue), the rab3 cycle (red), the rabphilin-3A cycle (gold) and the GDI cycle (pink).

FIG. 4 Protein-protein interaction cascades that mediate SV exo- and endocytosis. Top panels (A–G) show a model for the assembly and disruption of the synaptic core complex. The bottom panels (H–J) exhibit a speculative proposal for a string of reactions mediating Ca²⁺-triggered exocytosis and rapid endocytosis. Top panels. When docking occurs, syntaxin is complexed to munc18, and synaptobrevin to synaptophysin (A). These complexes dissociate during or after docking by an unknown mechanism (B). SNAP-25 then forms a complex with syntaxin, thereby creating a high affinity binding site for synaptobrevin which results in the synaptic core complex (C) which becomes SDS-resistant (D). The synaptic core complex serves as a receptor for SNAREs (E), which in turn binds NSF (F). NSF as a trimer crosslinks multiple core complexes into a network and disrupts the core complex with ATP hydrolysis (G). Botulinum and tetanus toxins would inhibit C, and N-ethylmaleimide stage G. Bottom panels. ATP hydrolysis by NSF disrupts the core complex and leads to hemifusion, possibly by means of the amphipathic N terminus of synaptobrevin (H). Synaptotagmin then acts as a Ca²⁺ sensor in completing the fusion reaction by a Ca²⁺-triggered interaction with syntaxin (J). Immediately after fusion, synaptotagmin acts as a nucleus for clathrin coat assembly by serving as an AP2 receptor (J). Clathrin and/or dynamin binding to AP2 then drive endocytosis. Hypertonic sucrose and α-latrotoxin probably activate Ca²⁺-independent fusion after stage C but before the action of synaptotagmin (stage H–J).
hypertonic sucrose is blocked<sup>47</sup>. This suggests that synaptotagmin I acts after the core complex that is inhibited by these toxins. (4) In squid nerve terminals injected with synaptotagmin peptides, release is inhibited and SVs accumulate at the active zone<sup>58</sup>. This presumably results from competition by the peptides for synaptotagmin effectors. (5) Synaptotagmin mutants in *Drosophila* show a severe but incomplete block of neurotransmission with an altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence in some mutants<sup>59,60</sup>. Similar changes are also observed with manipulations of synaptic transmission that are unrelated to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, making an interpretation of such changes difficult.

How do synaptotagmins trigger fast release? No changes in the frequency of spontaneous SV exocytosis ('minis') were observed in synaptotagmin-I knockouts, suggesting that synaptotagmin is not simply arresting membrane fusion but plays an active role<sup>58</sup>. Synaptotagmin I binds phospholipids as a function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with half-maximal binding at 3–6 μM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, an affinity that is higher than the low apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor in SV exocytosis (>100 μM)<sup>54-56,61</sup>. Syntaxin, a component of the synaptic core complex involved in priming, directly interacts with synaptotagmin I (refs 62, 63). Recent studies showed that syntaxin binding to synaptotagmin I is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> but requires more than 200 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> for half-maximal binding<sup>64</sup>. This approximates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement of SV exocytosis and suggests a mechanism whereby Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers SV exocytosis by regulating synaptotagmin-I interaction with syntaxin or other target proteins. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phospholipid binding by synaptotagmin may remodel membrane phospholipids during exocytosis and transform a hemifused into a fused membrane. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion is probably a complex reaction involving multiple proteins and not only the interaction of synaptotagmins with syntaxins. In addition to phospholipids and syntaxins, synaptotagmin I binds to the cytoplasmic domains of neurexins, which are polymorphic cell-surface proteins that are expressed exclusively in neurons (Box 3) (refs 65, 66). The neurexins and other, as yet unidentified, interacting molecules may contribute to shaping the fusion reaction.

Surprisingly, brain expresses at least seven other synaptotagmins in addition to synaptotagmin I, four of which are also present in non-neural cells<sup>64,67-70</sup>. The different synaptotagmins are differentially expressed in neurons with partly overlapping patterns, suggesting that different synaptotagmins may have distinct functions. Such a functional heterogeneity is supported by the differential Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties of synaptotagmins<sup>64</sup>. Some synaptotagmins appear to be independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (synaptotagmins IV, VI and VIII), others exhibit a similar high Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity for syntaxin and for phospholipid binding (synaptotagmins III and VII), and a third class binds syntaxin only at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations but phospholipids at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (synaptotagmins I and II). Interestingly, all three classes appear to be coexpressed in neurons, suggesting functional differentiation. This is supported by the inability of synaptotagmin III, which is coexpressed with synaptotagmin I in the hippocampal neurons analysed in the synaptotagmin I knockout, to substitute for synaptotagmin I. The first two classes of synaptotagmins are also present in non-neural cells, whereas the last class, exemplified by synaptotagmin I, is specialized for fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis. Together these findings suggest that synaptotagmins may have a general function in cellular membrane fusion in collaboration with non-neural isoforms of syntaxin, with different synaptotagmins being specialized for distinct reactions.

### Endocytosis of synaptic vesicles

Empty SV membranes are taken up after exocytosis in 1 to 5 s (ref. 71), much faster than most endocytic events. Similar endocytosis is also observed in neuroendocrine cells<sup>72</sup>. Two mechanisms have been proposed: endocytosis via coated pits akin to receptor-mediated endocytosis<sup>73</sup>, or coupled exo- and

endocytosis ('kiss-and-run')<sup>74</sup>. Rapid endocytosis is faster than receptor-mediated endocytosis in fibroblasts and is not inhibited by decreases in the pH or the K<sup>+</sup> concentration which disrupt receptor-mediated endocytosis<sup>72</sup>. These findings suggest that receptor-mediated endocytosis in fibroblasts and rapid endocytosis of SVs are different processes. Nevertheless, three observations support a general role for clathrin-coated vesicles in SV endocytosis. (1) Coated vesicles from brain are largely coated SVs<sup>75,76</sup>. Moreover, coated vesicles are abundant in nerve terminals and increase more than tenfold after stimulation<sup>8</sup>. (2) Endocytosis of SVs and other membranes is disrupted in the paralytic *Drosophila* mutant *shibire*<sup>77</sup>. Paralysis correlates with a loss of SVs, an increase in the nerve terminal area, and the appearance on the plasma membrane of coated pits that do not bud. Cloning of the *shibire* gene demonstrated that it encodes a *Drosophila* homologue of dynamin<sup>78,79</sup>, a protein that functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. (3) Dynamin 1 is a major phosphoprotein of the synapse that is quantitatively dephosphorylated in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner upon depolarization<sup>80</sup>. Dephosphorylation inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin 1, suggesting that dynamin 1 is regulated in conjunction with SV endocytosis. Furthermore, incubation of permeabilized synaptosomes with a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP (GTP-γS) results in the assembly of dynamin coats on invaginated empty SVs on the plasma membrane<sup>81</sup>.

The most plausible hypothesis to resolve the different findings is that nerve terminals utilize a novel type of clathrin-mediated endocytosis that has kinetics and biochemical characteristics distinct from receptor-mediated endocytosis in fibroblasts. This hypothesis is supported by the presence in nerve terminals of special clathrin-associated proteins, such as AP180 and auxilin<sup>82</sup>, which might modify the pH and K<sup>+</sup> sensitivity and the kinetics of clathrin assembly. SV exocytosis is stimulated by α-latrotoxin, a component of black-widow spider venom. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, α-latrotoxin still stimulates exocytosis but subsequent endocytosis is inhibited<sup>83</sup>. A Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent step in endocytosis could consist of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dephosphorylation of dynamin 1 (ref. 80).

Fast clathrin-mediated endocytosis would require clathrin assembly. Assembly of clathrin coats is thought to be initiated by binding of the AP2 adaptor protein complex to membrane receptors. A search for such a receptor on SVs revealed that AP2 binds to synaptotagmin with high affinity<sup>84</sup>. The AP2 binding suggests a role for synaptotagmin in the endocytic reaction that immediately follows exocytosis. Because SVs only have a limited number of proteins to guide them through a complex life cycle, it would be economical for a single protein to function both in the last step of exocytosis and the first step of endocytosis, and to couple exo- and endocytosis to each other. The ubiquitously distributed synaptotagmins may serve as general AP2 receptors in all cells<sup>64</sup>. AP2 also binds a dynamin 1, AP180 and amphiphysin, suggesting that AP2 may be the linchpin of a macromolecular complex that attaches to synaptotagmin and mediates fast clathrin-dependent endocytosis<sup>85</sup>.

Cysteine string proteins (CSPs) are SV proteins that are attached to SVs by a string of more than ten palmitoylated cysteines. Mutations in the *Drosophila* homologue of CSP lead to a decrease in evoked neurotransmitter release<sup>86</sup>. CSP contains a DNA-J homology domain that in other proteins acts cooperatively with heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) as a molecular chaperone. The only known function for an Hsp70 in the SV pathway is the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, which is thought to be mediated by Hsp70 (ref. 87). CSP may facilitate rapid decoating by cooperating with Hsp70. Such a function would be consistent with a decrease in SVs in the nerve terminal of CSP mutants.

### Synaptic plasticity

Alterations in synaptic strength, referred to as synaptic plasticity, have presynaptic and postsynaptic origins. Elegant *in vivo*
experiments revealed an important role for protein kinases in initiating synaptic plasticity<sup>88,91</sup>. However, long-term changes are unlikely to be maintained by covalent modifications of a few proteins; they are more likely to involve restructuring of synapses and changes in gene expression. Although such changes require nuclear signals, they nevertheless remain restricted to a few selected synapses of a given neuron.

On the presynaptic side, synaptic plasticity is characterized by changes in neurotransmitter release. These could be caused by changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during an action potential, or by direct effects on the fusion machinery which modulate neurotransmitter release probability. Several protein kinase substrates have been characterized that may function in synaptic plasticity: most prominent among these are the synapsins, a class of abundant membrane proteins of SVs (Fig. 2)<sup>92</sup>.

Synapsins Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb are the alternatively spliced products of two genes, and together account for approximately 9% of the SV protein<sup>93</sup>. Synapsins are phosphorylated at their N terminus by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaM KI) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition, synapsin I but not II contains C-terminal phosphorylation sites for CaM KII. Synapsin I binds with high affinity to several proteins *in vitro*, including neurofilaments, actin filaments, spectrin, annexin VI, grb2, calmodulin, CaM KII and tubulin<sup>94-100</sup>. Synapsin interactions with actin filaments and neurofilaments are regulated by the C-terminal CaM KII phosphorylation, and annexin VI binding by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In squid neurons, injection of synapsin I that was not phosphorylated at the C terminus resulted in inhibition of neurotransmitter release, whereas injection of phosphorylated synapsin I had no effect<sup>101</sup>. This suggests that an excess of synapsin I 'freezes' the nerve terminal in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Conversely, injections of synapsin II into Xenopus oocytes resulted in strengthening of the synapses formed by their developing neurons<sup>102</sup>. Together these data indicate positive and negative roles for synapsins in regulating SV traffic. This was confirmed in studies of gene-targeted mice lacking one or both synapsins<sup>103,104</sup>.

Mice lacking synapsins are viable and fertile, and have a normal synaptic architecture. However, they are prone to seizures and are unable to regulate synaptic transmission properly. In mice lacking synapsin I, a selective increase in paired pulse facilitation is observed, but not in other forms of synaptic plasticity. Paired pulse facilitation consists of the potentiation of release during the second of two closely spaced action potentials and occurs on a millisecond timescale. Mice lacking synapsin II had normal paired pulse facilitation but exhibited a major decrease in a different form of short-term synaptic plasticity, post-tetanic potentiation<sup>103</sup>. This is the potentiation of neurotransmission that is induced by tetanic stimulation, and lasts for several seconds. In addition, repetitive stimulation of synapses at physiological frequencies caused massive synaptic depression. This suggests that the SV cycle is unable to accelerate appropriately upon repetitive stimulation in the synapsin-II knockout<sup>104</sup>. The synapsin-I knockout did not exhibit decreased post-tetanic potentiation or synaptic depression upon repetitive stimulation, but aggravated this phenotype in the double knockout.

Thus synapsins are not essential for synaptic development or SV traffic but are required for synaptic regulation. The most plausible model to explain the results of the synapsin-II knockout and injections is that synapsin II is a positive regulator of neurotransmitter release which is activated during accelerated SV traffic by repetitive firing. Synaptic depression during repetitive stimulation was even more severe in the double knockout when expression of both synapsins was deleted, suggesting that synapsin I, like synapsin II, also functions as a positive regulator. Repetitive stimulation increases nerve terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and activates CaM kinases. That synaptic depression is observed in the synapsin knockouts under these conditions raises the possibility that positive regulation of release by synapsins involves

the N-terminal phosphorylation sites for CaM KI in synapsins I and II.

Why then does the synapsin I knockout not show the same synaptic depression that it aggravates in the synapsin II knockout, and why is paired pulse facilitation not affected in the double knockout? There is currently no conclusive answer to this puzzle. In a knockout, the phenotype observed is the sum of all biological activities for which a given protein is essential but does not report redundant functions. The increase in paired pulse facilitation in the synapsin-I knockout suggests that synapsin I normally inhibits neurotransmitter release on a millisecond timescale immediately after a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, possibly by means of the C-terminal phosphorylation by CaM KII. This effect may not be apparent in the double knockout because the depression of release may already occur in the second stimulus. Conversely, the synapsin-I knockout may not exhibit synaptic depression during repetitive stimulation because the inhibitory effect of synapsin I that documents itself in increased paired pulse facilitation may balance its positive effect.

The essential function of the synapsins is restricted to regulating SV traffic. Thus an understanding of their mechanism of action would give insights into synaptic regulatory mechanisms. In the synapsin double knockout, no major redistribution of SVs was observed<sup>104</sup>. The regulatory changes of release in the synapsin knockouts set in very rapidly during repetitive stimulation, long before docked SVs are exhausted. These observations suggest that the action of synapsins occurs after docking of SVs. Interestingly, in the synapsin knockouts the impaired regulation of SV traffic leads to a destabilization of SVs and a decrease in the levels of some but not all SV proteins. Intrinsic membrane proteins are decreased, but rab3A and rabphilin-3a (which dissociate from SVs during or after docking and/or exocytosis; see Fig. 3) are not. Rab5, which has a probable function in the endosome, is even increased<sup>104</sup>. This pattern also supports the idea that the impairment of SV traffic in the knockouts is localized to a step distal to docking but does not exclude a role for the cytoskeleton in this regulation.

### Perspectives

Synaptic connections between neurons are specific and not formed at random. They consist of precisely aligned pre- and postsynaptic specializations. There must be a recognition process that establishes the first contact, and a reinforcement process that maintains it. Different synapses formed by a neuron have distinct release probabilities regulated by the target. Thus synapses not only mediate fast, point-to-point transmission of an intercellular signal in a single direction but also represent bidirectional junctions that are plastic. Structurally they resemble tight junctions in which the cytoplasmic domains of intercellular adhesion molecules are nucleating submembrane coats. The cell-adhesion mechanisms involved are asymmetric and heterotypic. They must at least partly explain the specificity of synapse formation that discriminates among millions of neurons. A recently identified family of polymorphic cell-surface proteins comprising more than 1000 isoforms, the neurexins<sup>66</sup>, may represent the first candidates for cell-surface proteins that could confer such specificity.

Insight into the SV pathway is important for our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of membrane transport and the design and properties of neural networks. At this point, the molecular description of the SV pathway has reached the sophistication of early cartography: we can delineate contours of continents but the interiors are largely blank. Proteins such as synaptotagmin or dynamin have been identified that perform functions localized to distinct steps in the pathway. However, it is unknown how these proteins act. Moreover, the functions of several important synaptic proteins, for example that of synaptophysin or SV2s, remain to be explored, whereas no candidate proteins have been proposed for many steps in the pathway (Fig.

l and Box 2). Clearly we are only beginning to understand the SV cycle, its regulation and its topologic specificity. Several major problems must be addressed, including: (1) how specificity is achieved in the docking of SVs; (2) how membranes fuse, and how different steps of the fusion reaction (priming, Ca²⁺-triggered fusion) are regulated; (3) what the composition of the active zone is, and how it is assembled in complementarity with the postsynaptic specializations; and (4) what proteins function during SV recycling, and how many proteins are required for each distinct step in the SV cycle.

Decisive solutions should emerge from biochemical, morphological and electrophysiological analyses of the appropriate genetic models in mice, *Drosophila* and *C. elegans.*
