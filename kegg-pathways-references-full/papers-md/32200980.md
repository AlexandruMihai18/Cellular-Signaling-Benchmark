Clinical Implications of Folate Transport in the Central Nervous System

Camille Alam,¹ Misaki Kondo,¹ Deborah L. O'Connor,²,³ and Reina Bendayan¹,*


Folates are essential for key biosynthetic processes in mammalian cells and play a crucial role in the maintenance of central nervous system homeostasis. Mammals lack the metabolic capacity for folate biosynthesis; hence, folate requirements are largely met through dietary sources. To date, three major folate transport pathways have been characterized: the folate receptors (FRs), reduced folate carrier (RFC), and proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT). This article reviews current knowledge on the role of folate transport systems in mediating folate delivery to vital tissues, particularly the brain, and how these pathways are modulated by various regulatory mechanisms. We will also briefly highlight the clinical significance of cerebral folate transport in relation to neurodevelopmental disorders associated with folate deficiency.

### Highlights

- Folate transport in mammalian brain is mediated by three major pathways: folate receptor alpha (FRα; FOLR1), proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT; SLC46A1), and reduced folate carrier (RFC; SLC19A1).
- Folate delivery to the brain primarily occurs at the choroid plexus through FRα and PCFT.
- Loss-of-function mutations in these transport systems have been implicated in a number of childhood neurological disorders, including cerebral folate deficiency, hereditary folate malabsorption, and autism.
- Currently, there is limited knowledge on the contribution of other brain regions (i.e., blood–brain barrier) to overall brain folate uptake.
- Increasing folate permeability into the brain or finding alternative routes for effective brain folate transport could lead to significant therapeutic benefits.


### Physiological Importance of Folates

Folates (see Glossary) play a central role in the regulation of cell function in all tissues. Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is involved in three major metabolic cycles required for: (i) *de novo* synthesis of DNA or RNA; (ii) amino acid production; and (iii) biosynthesis of the universal methylating agent, S-adenosylmethionine (*Figure 1*) [1]. Traditionally, folates were acquired from food such as liver and green leafy vegetables; however, folic acid fortification of white wheat flour and select grain products in North America and other developed countries now represents a predominant source of dietary folate. Emerging evidence also suggests that microbial folate biosynthesis in the colon likely plays a role in meeting folate requirements of mammals [2,3].

Folates are important in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Abnormalities in brain folate transport have been implicated in several childhood neurological disorders, including neural tube defects (NTDs) [4], cerebral folate deficiency syndrome [5], and hereditary folate malabsorption [6]. These disorders have devastating effects in young children and current therapeutic approaches are not sufficiently effective. The purpose of this review is to discuss current knowledge on the role of specific folate transport systems in folate delivery to vital tissues, such as the brain, and how these pathways are modulated by various regulatory mechanisms. We will also briefly highlight the clinical significance of cerebral folate transport in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with folate deficiency.

### Folate Derivatives

The folate molecule consists of a *p*-aminobenzoic acid core linked to a pteridine ring at one end and to glutamic acid at the other (*Figure 2*) [7,8]. Dietary folates exist as folic acid, an oxidized synthetic form often used in supplements and food fortification, or as naturally occurring forms which may carry a carbon substitution, are reduced, and often have a polyglutamate tail. Folic acid itself is not biologically active, but it is readily reduced and converted into active, one-carbon carrying tetrahydrofolate (THF) molecules, such as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF) and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF). THF derivatives associate with different one-carbon moieties (i.e., methyl, methylene, methenyl, or formyl) enabling

them to serve as one-carbon donors in cellular biosynthetic processes (Figure 2) [7,8]. Structural analogs of folates, known as antifolates, were also developed for anticancer therapy. These compounds inhibit enzymes involved in crucial metabolic pathways in cancer cells, particularly DNA synthesis. Clinically relevant antifolates include methotrexate and pemetrexed [9]. These compounds utilize the same transport pathways as physiological folates to enter tumor cells.

### Folate Transport Pathways: Role in Folate Absorption and Distribution to Vital Organs

Most naturally occurring dietary folates contain a polyglutamate tail that must be hydrolyzed into monoglutamate prior to gastrointestinal absorption [10,11]. Dietary folates are metabolized into THF derivatives during transit through the intestinal mucosa (in rodents) and/or the liver (in humans) [12]. Folates in the liver are either stored in polyglutamate forms, secreted into the bile, or enter the systemic circulation for tissue distribution. 5-methylTHF is the predominant form of folate in the blood. Unbound circulating folates are delivered to the kidneys for reabsorption. Since folates are anionic at physiological pH, they cannot cross biological membranes through diffusion and must rely on specific transport systems for their permeability into cells and across epithelia. Three major folate transport pathways have been characterized in mammalian tissues: folate receptors (FRs), reduced folate carrier (RFC), and proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) [13]. Proposed cellular localization of folate transport pathways in select tissues is illustrated in Figure 3.

#### Folate Receptors (FR)

FR isoforms (α, β, γ), encoded by the *FOLR* multigene family (*FOLR1-3*), can mediate cellular uptake of folates [14]. FRα and FRβ are cell surface glycoproteins involved in transport, whereas FRγ is a secreted protein [14]. FRα and FRβ bind folic acid and its reduced derivatives with high affinity (*K*~m~ = 1–10 nM) at neutral pH and facilitate transport through receptor-mediated endocytosis [15,16]. FRs contain restricted pattern of tissue expression. FRα is predominantly localized in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, proximal kidney tubules, uterus, placenta, and retina (Figure 3) [17,18]. Significant levels of FRβ is present in human placenta, hematopoietic cells (i.e., CD34⁺) and tissues (i.e., spleen, thymus) [14]. Furthermore, FRγ is constitutively secreted at low levels from normal and leukemic hematopoietic tissues [14].

Of the three FR isoforms, FRα has been the most characterized in terms of function. In the kidney, FRα constitutes an efficient reabsorption mechanism for filtered folates [19]. In choroid plexus epithelial cells, FRα serves as the primary route for 5-methylTHF uptake into the CNS [18]. Inactivation of this receptor can lead to perturbations in normal folate homeostasis, causing increased renal clearance of folates [19] as well as cerebral folate deficiency during early childhood [5]. Several groups have shown using *Folr1⁻/⁻* mice that loss of FRα produces embryos with severe growth retardation and multiple developmental abnormalities leading to embryonic lethality [20–22]. However, supplementation of pregnant dams with high doses of 5-methylTHF or 5-formylTHF during gestation enables live birth of *Folr1⁻/⁻* animals with normal phenotype [20–22].

#### Reduced Folate Carrier (RFC)

The RFC, a member of the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily of transporters and product of the *SLC19A1* gene, constitutes an effective route for folate delivery to cells and tissues. It is a transmembrane protein consisting of 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs), cytoplasmically oriented N and C termini, and a single N-glycosylation site located in the loop connecting TMD1 and TMD2 [23,24]. RFC functions optimally at pH 7.4 as a bidirectional antiporter exchanging folates with intracellular organic phosphates [23]. Compared with FRα, RFC exhibits a relatively lower affinity

Figure 1. Folate-Mediated One-Carbon Metabolism. Folate metabolism (green) is at the branch of two major metabolic cycles: DNA/RNA cycle (blue) and methylation cycle (pink). This set of reactions, collectively known as folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, are essential for the production of: (i) thymidine and purine precursors of nucleic acids required for DNA/RNA synthesis and repair; (ii) several amino acids required for protein synthesis, including serine, glycine, and methionine; and (iii) the universal methylation agent, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), an important methyl donor for the methylation of DNA, proteins, and neurotransmitters. Folate derivatives are crucial components of cell growth and survival; hence, alterations in folate status can disrupt normal cellular processes.

for 5-methylTHF and other reduced folate derivatives ($K_{\mathrm{m}} = 2$–7 μM) and an even lower affinity for folic acid ($K_{\mathrm{m}} \approx 200$ μM) [23,24]. RFC is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, particularly the kidney, small intestine, colon, placenta, and various areas of the CNS (Figure 3) [23,25–28]. Specific cellular localization of RFC enables it to perform specialized tissue functions, including folate absorption in the colon, renal secretion of antifolates, transplacental folate transport, and a potential role in brain folate uptake [7,27–29]. Alterations in RFC functional expression can exacerbate the effects of folate deficiency and contribute to the development of fetal abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. In fact, inactivation of the Slc19a1 gene is embryonic lethal in mice [24].

### Proton-Coupled Folate Transporter (PCFT)

The PCFT, encoded by the SLC46A1 gene, offers another transmembrane route for folate uptake. PCFT is an integral membrane protein comprised of 12 TMDs, cytoplasmically directed N and C termini, and two N-glycosylation sites located in the loop connecting TMD1 and TMD2 [24]. It functions as a symporter, cotransporting folates along with protons into the cell, and operates optimally at pH 5.0–5.5 with a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of ~1 μM for folic acid and reduced folates.

[24]. In humans and rodents, PCFT is abundantly expressed at the apical brush-border membrane of the duodenum and proximal jejunum, serving as a principal mechanism for gastrointestinal absorption of folate [30]. High levels of PCFT were also reported in the kidney, liver, placenta, retinal pigment epithelium, and to a lesser extent in the colon, testis, and brain (Figure 3) [23]. PCFT has been proposed to play a role in 5-methylTHF uptake at the choroid plexus [6,18]. Loss-of-function mutations in the SLC46A1 gene can lead to severely low folate levels in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infants [31]. These symptoms were confirmed in Slc46a1⁻/⁻ mice, which showed systemic folate deficiency, macrocytic anemia, and elevated levels of homocysteine in plasma and brain tissues [30].

### Other Folate Transporters

Efflux transporters from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, particularly breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; ABCG2) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP; ABCC), were identified as low affinity transporters of folates ($K_{\text{m}} = 0.2–2 \, \text{mM}$) [32]. ABC transporters are expressed in various tissues and may acquire secretory or absorptive function depending on their cellular localization (Figure 3). MRP2 and BCRP at the apical membrane of the small intestine can export folates into the intestinal lumen, whereas basolaterally localized MRP3 mediates folate absorption across enterocytes [30]. In the liver, biliary secretion of folates is primarily mediated by MRP2 and BCRP at the hepatocyte canalicular membrane [30,33]. Several ABC transporters are also present in the kidney and may facilitate folate export into the systemic circulation (MRP1, MRP3, MRP5) [34] or folate secretion into the urine (MRP2, MRP4) [35]. The presence of BCRP and MRP isoforms in brain barrier sites, such as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB), can further influence folate delivery to the CNS [36,37].

Specific cellular localization of folate receptors and transporters are depicted in intestinal epithelia (A), liver hepatocytes (B), kidney proximal tubules (C), brain capillary endothelial cells (D), choroid plexus epithelia (E), and placental syncytiotrophoblast (F). Depending on their cellular localization, folate receptors or transporters may display secretory or absorptive function. Influx transporters (green) primarily mediate folate uptake into cells, while efflux transporters (blue) mediate cellular export of folates. Abbreviations: BBB, Blood-brain barrier; BCRP, breast cancer resistance protein; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; FR, folate receptor; MRP, multidrug resistance-associated protein; OAT, organic anion transporter; OATP, organic anion-transporting polypeptide; PCFT, proton-coupled folate transporter; RFC, reduced folate carrier.

Other members of the SLC superfamily of influx transporters have been implicated in folate transport (Figure 3). Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP; SLCO), OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, mediate folate uptake from the hepatic portal system for subsequent excretion into the bile [38]. OATP2B1 acts as a low-affinity transporter of antifolates in the intestine [39]. In the kidney, OATP1A2 facilitates methotrexate transport (Km = 450 μM) across the apical membrane of distal nephrons [40]. Furthermore, organic anion transporters (OAT; SLC22), OAT1–3, are expressed at the basolateral side of renal proximal epithelium and favor urinary secretion of methotrexate (Km = 10–700 μM) [41,42]. In contrast, OAT4 is present at the apical membrane of the renal proximal tubule with a Km of 18 μM for methotrexate [42]. Additionally, specific cellular localization of OATP and OAT isoforms at the choroid plexus or BBB could further influence folate homeostasis in the brain [37].

**Regulation of Major Folate Transport Pathways**

Various molecular mechanisms exist to positively or negatively regulate the expression and/or function of the three major folate transport pathways. This section will briefly discuss four major regulatory mechanisms of these pathways.

**Dietary/Supplemental Folate Levels**

Dietary levels of folate can modulate folate transporter expression *in vitro* and *in vivo*. Traditionally, it was observed that low extracellular levels of folate can upregulate FR/transporter expression.
human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, FRα expression is upregulated under folate deficient conditions due to increased FRα stability resulting from either increased receptor half-life or rate of receptor synthesis [43]. In mice, significant induction of RFC and FRα were observed in the small intestine or kidney of animals fed with a folate-deficient diet [44]. In rats, dietary folate deficiency was also shown to upregulate RFC and PCFT expression at the intestinal brush-border membrane [45]. In contrast, oversupplementation of rats with folate led to decreased RFC and PCFT protein expression in intestinal cells [46].

### Alcohol/Ethanol

Alcohol consumption also regulates the functional expression of folate transport systems. In rodent models, chronic consumption of ethanol negatively regulates intestinal folate transport by decreasing the functional expression of folate transporters, PCFT and RFC [47,48]. Ethanol consumption may also deplete folate stores in the liver by downregulating the expression of folylpolyglutamate synthetase, an essential enzyme for the addition of glutamate groups to 5-methylTHF so it can be retained in tissues [49,50]. Ethanol can further regulate systemic folate levels by increasing urinary or fecal folate excretion, as observed in rats and monkeys placed on an ethanol-based diet [49,51]. Several human studies have also seen ~20–40% increase in urinary folate excretion in chronic alcoholic patients [59,51].

### Transcription Factors

Numerous studies have demonstrated the role of **transcription factors** in modulating FR or transporter expression (Table 1). Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is a transcription factor that binds to GC-rich sequences in the promoter of FOLR genes and upregulates transcription of FRα, β, and γ [52–54]. Nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) can also positively regulate the FOLR2 gene through concerted actions with Sp1 [55,56]. In contrast, activating protein 1 (AP1), represses FOLR2 promoter activity [57].

6 Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, Month 2020, Vol. xx, No. xxThe SLC19A1 gene, which encodes for RFC, is regulated by a host of transcription factors via six promoter regions. Sp1 remains an important regulatory factor for RFC and transactivates the promoter A region of SLC19A1 [45]. Transcription factors, AP2, activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1), cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB-1), USF1, and USF2a, can modulate RFC expression via promoter region B [85]. USF1 and GATA1 were also shown to synergistically increase SLC19A1 promoter activity at A1/A2 regions [58]. Promoter region C is transactivated by Sp1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) [25]. RFC is also upregulated by E2F-1, although the specific promoter region involved has not been characterized [59]. A significant decrease in SLC19A1 mRNA was also observed following NRF-1 knockdown in HeLa cells [60]. Similarly, in vivo NRF-1 silencing showed significant reduction of RFC protein levels in mouse hepatocytes [61]. In contrast, activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) represses RFC functional expression [62].

Furthermore, the SLC46A1 gene encoding for PCFT has one known promoter with several regulatory sites for transcription factors. Two trans-activating transcription factors, AP1 and yin-yang 1 (YY1), were discovered in human cervical carcinoma cells after reportedly observing a ~50% decrease in SLC46A1 promoter activity following their inactivation [63]. Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) were shown to synergistically transactivate SLC46A1 [64]. NRF-1 was also shown to bind to the SLC46A1 promoter and increase transcriptional activity [70].

### Nuclear Receptors

Another family of transcription factors, known as nuclear receptors, has been reported to modulate cellular or tissue expression of folate transport pathways (Table 1) [65]. The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) was shown to upregulate FRβ expression in human myeloid leukemia cells following treatment with the RAR agonist, all-trans retinoic acid [66]. Tran et al. demonstrated that activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by dexamethasone resulted in increased mRNA expression of FRα [67]. Cotransfection experiments in embryo carcinoma cells also showed that HNF4α binds strongly to the FOLR1 promoter and increases activity [68]. In contrast, the estrogen receptor (ER) was found to negatively regulate FOLR1 transcription in human cervical carcinoma cells [69]. PCFT is positively regulated by the nuclear receptors HNF4α and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) [64,70]. As mentioned previously, HNF4α upregulates PCFT expression by transactivating the SLC46A1 gene with KLF4 [64]. Treatment of human intestinal cells with the VDR activating ligand, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ or calcitriol, also increased PCFT mRNA expression and function [30,70]. Recently, our laboratory examined the role of VDR in the regulation of RFC at the BBB [27,28]. We provided in vitro and in vivo evidence that activation of VDR through calcitriol upregulates RFC expression and function at the BBB. We also demonstrated in mice that loss of Folr1 substantially decreased brain folate delivery, but transport was restored following calcitriol administration [28]. These results suggest a potential alternative treatment strategy for neurological disorders caused by folate deficiency.

### Folate Transport in the Central Nervous System (CNS)

Folate concentration in the CSF is twofold to threefold greater than in blood. Folate delivery to the brain has been primarily investigated at the BCSFB or choroid plexus. As shown in Figure 3, folate transport pathways have distinct polarized distribution within the choroid plexus epithelium. FRα constitutes a major transcytosis route for folate uptake into the CSF [18]. The high folate binding affinity of FRα (Km = 1–10 nM) corresponds to physiological plasma concentrations of 5-methylTHF (4–20 nM) [6]. Under conditions of abundant folate supply (i.e., high extracellular folate concentrations), cellular transport of 5-methylTHF could also be mediated by lower affinity transporters, such as PCFT or RFC [71]. PCFT contributes to FRα-mediated transport by providinga route for folate export from exosomes in the CSF and from acidified endosomes within the choroid plexus epithelium [18]. Loss of FRα or PCFT function severely compromises brain folate transport. The presence of RFC in choroid plexus epithelial cells may also facilitate folate uptake into the CNS [24].

The cerebral vasculature endothelium or BBB represents another route for brain folate delivery. Studies from our laboratory and others have reported the presence of RFC and PCFT in human and rodent BBB (Figure 2) [26,27,72]. Recent data from single-cell RNA sequencing have also demonstrated high levels of RFC expression in pericytes and smooth muscle cells of the mouse cerebral vasculature, with lower expression in brain capillary endothelial cells [73,74]. Emerging evidence in the literature and clinic further support the role of the BBB in folate transport. Multiple groups, including ours, have demonstrated uptake of folates (i.e., methotrexate, 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF) in various *in vitro* and *in vivo* BBB models [11,12,13]. Reports from the clinic have also indicated that patients with FRα or PCFT mutations can sometimes present with mild neurological deficits despite suboptimal CSF folate levels, suggesting that in the absence of choroid plexus function, brain folate uptake can still occur via the BBB, however, the efficiency of transport varies among patients [5]. In light of these findings, additional research on the mechanisms of brain folate transport is needed.

### Neurological Consequences of Folate Deficiency

Impaired cerebral folate transport is associated with various types of neurological and neurodevelopmental complications. This section will briefly discuss five neurological disorders that have been linked to folate deficiency (see Box 1 for additional information).

#### Box 1. Neurological Disorders Associated with Folate Deficiency

Impaired brain folate transport can result in suboptimal folate levels in the CSF. Folate deficiency has been implicated in the following neurological conditions.

- **Neural tube defects (NTDs):** the prevalence of NTDs (i.e., spina bifida and anencephaly) in the United States is approximately 5.5 to 6.5 per 10,000 births [4]. Genetic polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or MTHFR (i.e., 677C>T, 1298A>C), an enzyme that functions at a crucial junction in the folate cycle (Figure 1), serve as an important genetic risk for NTDs [5].
  
- **Hereditary folate malabsorption:** this is a rare disorder that has only been observed in ~37 patients [6]. Current therapeutic strategies for increasing brain folate levels (i.e., parenteral administration of 5-formylTHF) are not sufficiently effective. Folate concentration in the CSF varies with age and is at its highest during infancy and early childhood at ~100–150 nM, then decreasing to ~50–90 nM by age 6 years, and >60 nM during puberty [80,81]. These levels are difficult to achieve even with the administration of high folate doses [82].
  
- **Cerebral folate deficiency:** this is a very rare disorder with only 13 confirmed cases to date. Current treatment methods lead to variable patient response. For some, administration of high oral doses of 5-formylTHF result in increased CSF 5-methylTHF concentrations and dramatic improvements in neurological outcomes, including normalization of appearance and speech, improved motor skills, and reduced frequency of epileptic seizures [83]. In other cases, treatment response is either minimal or requires a considerable amount of time to take effect (i.e., 3 years to reverse cortical white matter changes) [83].
  
- **Kearns-Sayre syndrome:** this disorder is primarily characterized by chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia with drooping and paralysis of the eyelids and pigmentary retinopathy that can lead to mild impaired vision. As the disease progresses, other associated symptoms develop, including cardiac conduction disorders, muscle weakness, neurologic dysfunction, endocrine disorders, and cerebral folate deficiency [86].
  
- **Autism spectrum disorders:** several human trials worldwide have shown that maternal folic acid supplementation can decrease the risk of autism in the offspring. A prospective study in Norway found that women who consumed 400 μg folic acid/day, starting from 4 weeks before and 8 weeks after conception, were 39% less likely to experience an autism-affected pregnancy [91]. In the United States, children who were born to mothers that consumed 600 μg folic acid/day during the first month of pregnancy had 38% lower risk of developing autism [92]. Another case-control cohort study carried out in Israel showed that use of folic acid or folic acid-containing multivitamin supplements before and/or during pregnancy can significantly decrease autism risk [93].

Neural Tube Defects (NTDs)

Suboptimal folate status in women of childbearing age has been linked to NTD-affected pregnancies (Box 1). NTDs are severe birth defects that arise during embryogenesis due to failure of the neural tube to close properly, leaving parts of the CNS exposed [75]. NTDs may progress into spina bifida, affecting the spine, or into anencephaly, which is characterized by reduced or completely missing cerebral hemispheres [8,75]. Evidence suggests that periconceptional supplementation with folic acid can reduce the incidence of these birth defects [4]. A prevention trial in the UK initially revealed that folic acid supplementation (4 mg/day) during the periconceptional period had a 72% protective effect in women who previously experienced NTD-affected pregnancies [76]. Follow-up trials further demonstrated that NTD occurrence was fully abolished with the use of folate-containing (0.8 mg folic acid) multivitamin-mineral supplements compared with placebo control [77]. In light of these findings, mandatory fortification of white wheat flour and grain products was implemented in the United States and Canada. Women planning a pregnancy were further advised to consume multivitamin supplements containing different doses of folic acid (400–5000 μg/day), depending on their NTD risk [78], for at least 3 months before conception and throughout the first trimester of pregnancy, in addition to the consumption of folate-rich foods.

Hereditary Folate Malabsorption

Folate deficiency in the CNS, denoted by low CSF 5-methylTHF concentrations, has been implicated in disorders involving defects in folate transport systems. Hereditary folate malabsorption is caused by impaired folate transport across the intestine and choroid plexus epithelia resulting from mutations in the SLC46A1 gene [6,31]. It manifests a few months after birth, causing newborns to develop anemia, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and stomatitis, recurrent infections due to immune deficiency, and neurologic manifestations, including developmental delays, peripheral neuropathies, motor impairment, ataxia, and mental retardation [5,79]. The severity of neurological symptoms may vary between patients, but if left untreated, they further experience recurrent seizures. Treatment for this disorder involves parenteral administration of 5-formylTHF. While this treatment approach is sufficient to correct for peripheral symptoms (i.e., anemia), the accompanying neurological defects are not easily addressed since physiological levels of CSF folate are difficult to achieve (Box 1) [80–82]. Thus, increasing folate permeability into the brain or finding alternative routes for brain folate transport can lead to significant therapeutic benefits.

Cerebral Folate Deficiency

Cerebral folate deficiency is a neurological syndrome caused by: (i) inactivating mutations in *FOLR1*, or (ii) the generation of autoantibodies against FRα [83]. The pathophysiology of this disorder is attributed to impaired folate transport across the choroid plexus; patients have normal concentrations of blood folate, but very low levels of 5-methylTHF in CSF (<5 nM). Patients appear normal at birth and throughout infancy and only exhibit neurological symptoms (i.e., abnormal brain myelination, psychomotor regression, epilepsy, ataxia) at 2–3 years of age. The late onset of cerebral folate deficiency compared with hereditary folate malabsorption could be due to the presence of normal blood folate levels, which allow for folate transport at the BBB [83]. In contrast, in hereditary folate malabsorption, the presence of severe systemic folate deficiency may limit the protective effect of the BBB. It should also be noted that despite normal folate uptake across the BBB, loss of FRα activity in patients with cerebral folate deficiency ultimately leads to neurological deficits. These findings suggest that there may be insufficient folate transport at the BBB to sustain normal brain development [84,85]. Current treatment strategies include administration of high oral doses of 5-formylTHF. It has been shown in mice that loss of FRα can be rescued by folate supplementation [20–22], but this is not the case for humans. Due to variability in patient response (Box 1), there is a need for more standardized optimal therapy [83].

Trends in Pharmacological Sciences

Kearns-Sayre Syndrome
Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder caused by deletions in mitochondrial DNA (Box 1) [86]. Initial reports from the 1980s noted an association between Kearns-Sayre syndrome and folate deficiency; specifically, female patients exhibited low plasma and CSF folate levels [37]. This observation was confirmed by Serrano *et al.*, where they showed that individuals with Kearns-Sayre syndrome had low total folate and 5-methylTHF levels in their CSF [88]. Interestingly, it was further reported that choroid plexus epithelial cells collected from these patients exhibited an enlarged and granular phenotype, which may cause the failure of folate transport into the CSF [89].

Autism Spectrum Disorders
Several lines of evidence suggest that periconceptional folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of autism spectrum disorders by ~40% (Box 1) [100–93]. While these studies present a potential link between maternal folate status and autism, the exact mechanisms pertaining to the protective role of folate remains unknown. In recent years, low CSF folate was observed in children with autism spectrum disorders, particularly Rett syndrome [124] and infantile low-functioning autism [95]. These individuals present with FRα autoantibodies, which block folate binding to FRα or disrupt receptor function [96]. Frye and colleagues reported a high prevalence (50–75%) of FRα autoantibodies in serum of autistic patients compared with control [96–98]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated in rodent models that supplementation with 5-formylTHF could prevent autism-related cognitive and behavioral deficits resulting from *in utero* exposure to FRα autoantibodies [99]. Human trials involving high oral dosing of 5-formylTHF have also shown partial recovery of neurological and social impairments in patients with infantile autism [95]. Marked improvements in attention, language, and stereotypical behavior was further reported in over 60% of patients treated with 5-formylTHF (2 mg/kg/day) compared with nontreated controls [98]. In a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 5-formylTHF supplementation (2 mg/kg/day) significantly improved verbal communication of patients expressing FRα autoantibodies [100]. Despite the promising effects of folate intervention in autism, there is still a need to establish more effective therapies. As noted in these trials, prolonged intake of 5-formylTHF at such high doses could result in adverse events, including insomnia, gastroesophageal reflux, and worsening aggression [98]. Since autism is a lifelong disorder, finding an optimal therapeutic approach with limited adverse effects is vital.

Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives
Folates are essential for brain development and function. Abnormalities in brain folate transport is associated with a number of neurodevelopmental conditions [6,83,96] and current therapeutic approaches are not sufficiently effective. Current treatment strategies involve administration of high doses of 5-formylTHF in order to deliver sufficient folate to the brain to sustain neural development. Despite achieving high blood folate levels, CSF folate concentrations can remain below the normal range and neurological signs, particularly seizures, are difficult to control [6,82]. Thus, identifying new strategies for enhancing folate permeability to the CNS is important.

To date, brain folate transport has been primarily characterized at the choroid plexus where folate uptake is mediated by FRα and PCFT [6,18]. Inactivation of these folate transport systems can severely compromise folate permeability into the CNS [6,83]. Recently, our group has shown that the cerebral vasculature endothelium or BBB could constitute an alternative route for folate delivery [27,28]. In particular, we demonstrated that upregulating RFC through activation of the VDR nuclear receptor can significantly increase folate transport across the BBB [27,28]. These findings suggest that modulating folate uptake at other brain barrier sites (i.e., BBB) could represent a novel treatment approach for neurological disorders associated with folate deficiency.

Furthermore, recent single-cell RNA sequencing data from mice detected RFC and PCFT expression in leptomeningeal cells of the arachnoid barrier and in brain parenchymal cells, respectively, suggesting a potential role for other brain regions in maintaining CNS folate homeostasis. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of cerebral folate transport is needed (see Outstanding Questions).
