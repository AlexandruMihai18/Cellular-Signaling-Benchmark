ABSTRACT

A common set of functional characteristics of cancer cells is that cancer cells consume a large amount of glucose, maintain high rate of glycolysis and convert a majority of glucose into lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen compared to that of normal cells (Warburg's Effects). In addition, cancer cells exhibit substantial alterations in several energy metabolism pathways including glucose transport, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutaminolysis, mitochondrial respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In the present work, we focused on reviewing the current knowledge about the dysregulation of the proteins/enzymes involved in the key regulatory steps of glucose transport, glycolysis, TCA cycle and glutaminolysis by several oncogenes including c-Myc and hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and tumor suppressor, p53, in cancer cells. The dysregulation of glucose transport and energy metabolism pathways by oncogenes and lost functions of the tumor suppressors have been implicated as important biomarkers for cancer detection and as valuable targets for the development of new anticancer therapies.

### 1. Introduction

Cancer cells exhibit a common set of functional characteristics, i.e., they consume a larger amount of glucose, maintain a much higher rate of glycolysis, and convert a majority of glucose into lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen compared to that of normal cells. This phenomenon was first described over 70 years ago [1,2] and has been known as the Warburg's Effect (aerobic glycolysis) [3]. The tumor cells preferentially use glycolysis over mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for glucose-dependent ATP production. This deviant energetic metabolism is a potential hallmark of cancer cells and has been thought to be the root of tumor formation and growth [4]. While the mechanisms underlying the Warburg's Effects have not been completely understood, a number of oncogenes including C-Myc and hypoxia-inducible factors-1 (HIF-1) and tumor suppressors such as p53 have been known to be involved in the regulation of energy metabolism (for review see [5,6]). The notable factors crucial for cancer metabolic phenotype are oncogenic mutations that alter growth factor signaling through the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (Protein Kinase B, PKB)/the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [7]. Activation of this pathway enhances metabolic activities of glycolysis by two major events. First, the synthesis of the sugar transporter GLUT-1 is induced to facilitate glucose uptake by the cells [6,8,9]. Second, the activity of transcription complex HIF-1α is increased, which in cooperation with transcription factor c-Myc enhances the synthesis of the majority of glycolytic enzymes [10]. The distinct phenotype of high glucose uptake in cancer cells has important clinical implications in that it can be documented by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of human cancers with radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose and 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose [11,12].

Based on Warburg's hypothesis, glycolysis is predominantly used in cancer cells because of a dysregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. However, not all cancers are PET-positive, and not all models of neoplastic transformation are associated with increased aerobic glycolysis. While hypoxic cells exhibit a shift toward glycolytic metabolism [13], a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain and a glutamine-derived carbon are required for proliferation of most transformed cells [14]. It has been known that most cancer cells do not have defects in mitochondrial metabolism [2], except for rare mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) or fumarate hydratase (FH), both are enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [6,15,16]. The oncogene c-Myc is known to be involved not only in regulation of glycolysis but also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis [17] and glutamine catabolism [6,18,19]. Furthermore, a proteomic study of breast cancer brain metastases detected increases in expression of enzymes/proteins involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP) [20]. Consistent with this, it has been observed that metabolic changes accompanying transformation and acquisition of metastatic potential in a syngeneic mouse mammary tumor model [21] and in human triple negative breast cancer cell lines MCF-10F series [22] included changes not only in the key metabolites in glycolysis but also in TCA cycle, PPP, and fatty acid/nucleotide biosynthesis. These observations indicate the need of rethinking the prevailing models of cancer metabolism, particularly if these alterations are exploited for therapeutic purposes [6,11].

Oncogenes and tumor suppressors have been linked to the regulation of glucose and energy metabolism, thereby connecting genetic alterations in cancers to their glucose metabolic phenotype [23,24]. A number of the metabolic changes can be attributed to the activation and/or malfunction of oncogenes, and/or loss of tumor suppressors. In this work, we focused on reviewing the current knowledge about the dysregulation of glucose transport, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis by tumor suppressor p53 and oncogenes, c-Myc, and HIF-1α, in cancer cells, and then pointed out the potential implications of these biomarkers/targets for cancer detection and for the development of new anticancer therapies.

### 2. p53, C-Myc, and HIF-1 involved in the regulation of glucose transport, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis

#### 2.1. p53

p53, a well-studied tumor suppressor, plays critical roles in the control of a number of cellular processes including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, genomic stability, and angiogenesis. In its anti-cancer role, p53 works through several mechanisms. It can initiate apoptosis if DNA damage proves to be irreparable and it can induce growth arrest by holding the cell cycle at the G1/S regulation point on DNA damage recognition [25,26]. p53 mainly exerts its tumor suppression function through the transcriptional regulation of its target genes. Upon its activation induced by oxidative stress, p53 binds to DNA and induces the expression of several different sets of genes including those involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, and oxidative stress response [25]. Notably, activation of the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1/CLIP1</sup> by p53 plays an important role in induction of G1 cell cycle arrest [27,28]. Another important function of p53 is its involvement in the regulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, playing an important role in determining the death or survival of cells [29]. p53 can activate numerous genes that result in increased generation of ROS, which contribute to apoptosis [27]. It also functions in a feedback loop in which ROS can signal to further activation of p53 [30]. On the other hand, p53 can induce the expression of proteins that function to lower ROS levels and this antioxidant function of p53 is important in preventing DNA damage and tumor development under low stress conditions [31]. Recent studies have revealed a number of new functions of p53 in the regulation of glucose metabolism and energy metabolism pathways including glucose transport [32], glycolysis [33], TCA cycle [34], glutaminolysis [35,36], mitochondrial respiratory chain/oxidative phosphorylation [37], and PPP [38,39], which will be described below.

#### 2.2. c-Myc

The proto-oncogene c-Myc encodes a transcription factor involved in many cellular processes, including proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell growth, metabolism, angiogenesis, differentiation, cell adhesion, and mobility primarily through transcriptional regulation of

large gene networks that ultimately results in activation or repression of target genes. Because of its broad regulatory scope, the expression of the c-Myc gene itself needs to be tightly controlled. Dysregulated expression and/or malfunction of c-Myc are one of the most common abnormalities in human malignancy. The c-Myc is involved in regulation of a large number of genes involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes and mitochondria, and regulation of glucose and glutamine metabolism as well as microRNAs (miRNA). With E2F1, c-Myc induces genes involved in nucleotide metabolism and DNA replication, and microRNAs that homeostatically attenuate E2F1 expression. With the HIF-1, ectopic c-Myc cooperatively induces a transcriptional program for hypoxic adaptation. The c-Myc regulates gene expression either directly, such as glycolytic genes including lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) [40]. The c-Myc gene is frequently activated in many different human cancers, which are highly dependent on sustained c-Myc expression whereas c-Myc inactivation results in desirable anticancer effects, such as cell death, differentiation, and/or senescence. Thus, c-Myc has emerged as an attractive target for cancer therapy [41,42].

In addition to its known functions mentioned above, recent studies have documented a new role for c-Myc in stimulating glutamine catabolism, in part through activation of proteins necessary for cells to engage in glutamine catabolism [11,40,43] (see Section 6.1.1).

### 2.3. HIF-1 and its regulation by SIRT3

Hypoxia is the result of an imbalance between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption, causing a reduction of oxygen tension below the normal level for a specific tissue. Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and is associated with their malignant phenotype [44]. HIF-1 is a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays essential roles in mammalian development and physiology. HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits. The expression and activity of the HIF-1α subunit are tightly regulated by cellular O₂ concentration. The levels of α subunit increase during hypoxia whereas the β subunit is constitutively expressed. The HIF-1α subunit has been used as a marker for hypoxia. HIF-1 is essential for embryonic vascularization/survival, neovascularization in ischemic myocardium, hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling, and tumor vascularization. HIF-1α is over-expressed in the majority of common human cancers and their metastases, due to the presence of intratumoral hypoxia and as a result of mutations in genes encoding oncproteins and tumor suppressors [45]. It has been known that HIF-1α is involved in the control of the expression of genes involved in glucose transport [46], glycolysis [45,47], TCA cycle [48,49] and glutaminolysis [11].

The sirtuin gene (SIRT) family is the mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase that mediates metabolic reprogramming by destabilizing HIF-1α [50,51]. It has been shown [51,52] that SIRT3 loss increases ROS production, leading to HIF-1α stabilization. SIRT3 expression is reduced in human breast cancers and several other malignancies and its loss correlates with the up-regulation of HIF-1α target genes. Loss of SIRT3 results in aberrant mitochondrial metabolism and genomic instability, while its over-expression represses glycolysis and proliferation in breast cancer cells, providing a metabolic mechanism for tumor suppression [50]. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts or tumor cell lines expressing SIRT3 short-hairpin RNA exhibited a greater potential to proliferate, and augmented HIF-1α protein stabilization and transcriptional activity in hypoxic conditions. Knocking down SIRT3 increases tumorigenesis in mouse xenograft models, and this is abolished by the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine. Moreover, over-expression of SIRT3 inhibits stabilization of HIF-1α protein in hypoxia and attenuates increases in HIF-1α transcriptional activity. Critically, over-expression of SIRT3 decreased tumorigenesis in xenografts, even when induction of the sirtuin occurred after tumor initiation. These data suggest that SIRT3 acts to suppress the growth of tumors, in part, through its ability to suppress ROS and HIF-1α [51].

### 3. Regulation of glucose transporters in cancer cells by p53 and HIF-1α

#### 3.1. Glucose transporter systems

Glucose enters cells via a family of twelve functional glucose transporters (GLUTs), designated GLUT-1 to GLUT-12. The majority of which are tissue-specific, for example, GLUT-1 (all tissues but abundance in brain and erythrocyte), GLUT-2 (liver), GLUT-3 (brain), GLUT-4 (muscle/fat), and GLUT-5 (small intestine) [53]. GLUTs are integral membrane proteins that contain 12 membrane-spanning helices with both the amino and carboxyl termini exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. GLUT proteins transport glucose and related hexoses according to a model of alternate conformation, which predicts that the transporter exposes a single substrate binding site toward either the outside or the inside of the cell [54–56]. Binding of glucose to one site provokes a conformational change associated with transport, and releases glucose to the other side of the membrane. The inner and outer glucose-binding sites are located in transmembrane segments 9, 10, 11 [57] and the glutamine-leucine-serine motif located in the seventh transmembrane segment could be involved in the selection and affinity of transported substrate [58,59].

Among the GLUTs, GLUT-1 is a rate-limiting transporter for glucose uptake, and its expression correlates with anaerobic glycolysis. GLUT-1 has an influence not only on glucose uptake/utilization but also on tumorigenic features, including metastasis, chemoresistance and escape from immune surveillance. Increased expression of GLUT-1 has been observed in breast, lung, colorectal cancers and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [53,60–63].

Higher GLUT-1 expression by breast cancer cells compared with the healthy breast tissue is common [60,62]. Brown et al. [60] examined the expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-2, GLUT-3, GLUT-4 and GLUT-5 in paraffin sections from 12 primary human breast cancers and 8 lymph node metastases from 2 patients. They detected GLUT-1 in all the primary breast cancers and the lymph node metastases where GLUT-1 was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells, but exhibited marked intratumoral and intertumoral variability in the proportions of positive cells and the intensity of staining. Its expression was much lower in the normal mammary epithelium than in tumor cells from the same patient. While GLUT-2 was expressed in all of the tumors, its staining intensity was not consistently stronger than that seen in healthy breast. Clusters of GLUT-4-positive granule were observed in cells in six of the tumors but none of the tumors or the healthy breast in the tissues tested expressed GLUT-3 or GLUT-5.

Grover-McKay et al. [61] observed that cell surface GLUT-1 expression was associated with the increasing invasive ability of the human breast cancer lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231. However, GLUT-2 and GLUT-5 were inversely associated with invasiveness; GLUT-3 expression was variable; and GLUT-4 was undetected. In a poorly differentiated human ductal breast cancer, in situ GLUT-1 staining was intense. Higher GLUT-1 expression was also observed in a large fraction of colorectal carcinomas from the patients. The patients with higher GLUT-1 staining were 2.3 times that in the group with low GLUT-1 staining GLUT-1. The expression was significantly correlated with female gender, non-mucinous tumor type, poorer differentiation, and lymph node metastasis [62,63]. HCC is one of the most fatal cancers in humans with rising incidence in many regions around the world. It has been shown [64,65] that the GLUT-1 expression is increased in a subset of HCC patients and functionally affects tumorigenicity. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of GLUT-1 expression in HCC cells resulted in reduced tumorigenicity whereas over-expression of GLUT-1 in bladder, breast, cervical, colorectal, gastric, lung and thyroid tumors is associated with metastasis and/or poor prognosis of these tumors (for review see [53]). Furthermore, increased expression of GLUT-1 protein is correlated with the increased uptake of

2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) by several types of tumors observed by PET imaging [66–68]. These findings suggest that GLUT-1 could be a therapeutic target for these cancers.

### 3.2. Regulation of glucose uptake and GLUT-1 expression by GSK-3/TSC2/mTOR/AKT

The expression and localization of glucose transporters are highly regulated in several ways dependent on the cell type and the stimuli involved. Several studies [69–71] have shown that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)/tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 (TSC2)/the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is one of the important pathways involved in the regulation of glucose transport.

GSK-3 (GSK-a/3β), an important signaling molecule that is ubiquitously expressed, has been implicated in the regulation of glucose transport and metabolism. GSK-3 is known to function downstream of phosphatidylinositol-kinase (P13K) and AKT [72]. Akt/PKA (Protein Kinase B) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a key role in multiple cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription, and cell migration. The tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 (TSC2) is a putative tumor suppressor, which has been shown to interact with GSK-3 [73]. mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis, and transcription. mTOR belongs to PI3K-related kinase protein family [74,75]. mTOR integrates the input from upstream pathways, including insulin, growth factors (such as IGF-1 and IGF-2), and amino acids [74]. mTOR also senses cellular nutrient and energy levels and redox status [76].

Buller et al. [71] have provided several lines of evidence indicating that GSK-3/TSC2/mTOR pathway is involved in regulation of GLUT-1 in several cell types. First, chronic inhibition of basal GSK-3 activity in several cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, resulted in increase in glucose uptake due to a similar increase in protein expression of GLUT1 while expression of a constitutively active form of GSK-3β resulted in decrease in GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake; Second, GSK-3 inhibits mTOR signaling via phosphorylation of TSC2 and the absence of functional TSC2 resulted in increase in glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression in multiple cell types, which were prevented by inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin. The effect of GSK-3 inhibition on GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake was restored in TSC2 mutant cells by transfection of a wild-type TSC2 vector, but not by a TSC2 construct with mutated GSK-3 phosphorylation sites. Third, GSK-3 inhibition had no effect on glucose uptake or GLUT-1 expression in TSC2 mutant cells. These results indicate that effects of GSK-3 on GLUT-1 and glucose uptake are mediated by a TSC2/mTOR-dependent pathway. GSK-3 suppresses glucose uptake via TSC2 and mTOR and may serve to match energy substrate utilization to cellular growth. It has also reported that HIF-1α levels were enhanced through an mTOR-dependent mechanism in cells derived from TSC2 negative mouse embryo fibroblast [77]. These studies suggest that TSC2 is an important negative regulator of GLUT-1 expression and glucose uptake. Inactivating mutations in TSC2 likely lead to enhanced GLUT-1 expression and basal glucose uptake in a non-insulin-sensitive manner [71]. On the other hand, GLUT-1 was found to enhance mTOR activity independently of TSC2 and AMPK [78].

It has been known that Akt/PKB is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle and adipose cells. Zhou et al. [70] have revealed a link between Akt activation and glucose transport regulation. Using proteomic and bioinformatic approaches, they identified the Rab GAP (GTPase-activating protein)-domain containing protein TBC1D1 [TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain family, member 1], which is closely related to TBC1D4 [TBC domain family, member 4], as an Akt substrate. RNA interference (siRNA)-mediated silencing of TBC1D1

elevated basal deoxyglucose uptake by approx. 61% in 3T3-L1 mouse embryo adipocytes, while the suppression of TBC1D4 under the same conditions had little effect on basal and insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake. Silencing of TBC1D1 strongly increased expression of GLUT1 glucose transporter but not GLUT4 in cultured adipocytes, whereas the decrease in TBC1D4 had no effect. Loss of TBC1D1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes activated the mTOR-p70 S6 protein kinase pathway, and the increase in GLUT-1 expression in the cells treated with TBC1D1 siRNA was blocked by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, over-expression of the mutant TBC1D1-T590A, lacking the putative Akt/PKB phosphorylation site, inhibited insulin stimulation of p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation, which is induced by mTOR. These data suggest that TBC1D1 may be involved in controlling GLUT-1 expression through the mTOR–p70 S6 kinase pathway. Akt regulates the transcription [79] and translation (through mTOR) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) [80] of GLUT-1. Because the mTOR pathway is dysregulated in certain cancers [75], its regulatory role on GLUT-1 might be lost.

### 3.3. Negative regulation of GLUT-1, GLUT-3 and GLUT-4 by p53

It has been shown that p53 is involved in down-regulation of glucose transport genes [32,81]. Schwartzenberg-Bar-Yoseph et al. [32] transiently co-transfected osteosarcoma-derived SaOS-2 cells, rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells, and C2C12 myotubes with GLUT1-P-Luc or GLUT4-P-Luc promoter-reporter constructs and wild-type p53 expression vectors. They observed that p53 expression dose dependently decreased both GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 promoter activity to approximately 50% of their basal levels. The inhibitory effect of wild-type p53 was greatly reduced or abolished when cells were transfected with p53 with mutations in amino acids 143, 248, or 273. A region spanning –66/+163bp of the GLUT-4 promoter was both necessary and sufficient to mediate the inhibitory effects of p53. Furthermore, in vitro translated p53 protein was found to bind directly to two sequences in that region and p53–DNA binding was completely abolished by excess unlabeled probe but not by nonspecific DNA, and was super-shifted by the addition of an anti-p53 antibody. These data suggest that wild-type p53 represses GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 gene transcription in a tissue-specific manner. Mutations within the DNA-binding domain of p53, which are usually associated with malignancy, were found to impair the repressive effect of p53 on transcriptional activity of the GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 gene promoters, thereby resulting in increased glucose metabolism and cell energy supply.

Kawauchi et al. [81] have found a link between p53, the transcription factor NF-κB and glycolysis. In p53-deficient primary cultured cells, kinase activities of IKKα and IKKβ and subsequent NF-κB activity were enhanced. Activation of NF-κB by loss of p53 caused an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis and up-regulation of GLUT3. Oncogenic Ras-induced cell transformation and acceleration of aerobic glycolysis in p53-deficient cells were suppressed in the absence of p65/NF-κB expression, and were restored by GLUT3 expression. It was also shown that a glycolytic inhibitor diminished the enhanced IKK activity in p53-deficient cells. Moreover, in Ras-expressing p53-deficient cells, IKK activity was suppressed by p65 deficiency and restored by GLUT3 expression. These data indicate that p53 restricts activation of the IKK–NF-κB pathway through suppression of glycolysis, suggesting the presence of a positive-feedback loop exists, whereby glycolysis drives IKK–NF-κB activation, and that hyperactivation of this loop by loss of p53 is important in oncogene-induced cell transformation.

### 3.4. Regulation of glucose transport by HIF-1α

Several studies [46,82–84] have shown that hypoxia induced an elevated expression level of GLUT-1 via HIF-1α. Chondrocytes reside in a hypoxic environment and utilize glucose as the main energy

source. Ren et al. [82] have demonstrated that hypoxia enhanced expression levels of GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 via HIF-1α in chondrocytes. In contrast, deletion of HIF-1α led to complete loss of the hypoxia-induced expression of GLUT-1 and GLUT-3. Similarly, induction of GLUT-1 expression in BeWo choriocarcinoma cells [84] and in trophoblast-derived cells [46] was found to be mediated by HIF-1α. HIF-1 has been known to play a key role in the reprogramming of cancer metabolism by activating transcription of a number of genes encoding glucose transporters as well as glycolytic enzymes (for review see [13]).

### 3.5. GLUT-1 as a potentially important anti-cancer target

Since GLUT-1 is over-expressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors, GLUT-1 has been proposed as a potentially important target for development of anti-cancer drugs. [64,85,86]. More recently, Liu et al. [87] identified a small molecule inhibitor of GLUT-1 named WZB117 that was shown to be effective not only in inhibition of cell growth in cancer cell lines but also in inhibition of cancer growth in a nude mouse model. Daily intraperitoneal injection of WZB117 at 10 mg/kg resulted in an over 70% reduction in the size of human lung cancer of A549 cell origin through decreasing the levels of GLUT-1 protein, intracellular ATP, and glycolytic enzymes. These changes were followed by increase in ATP-sensing enzyme AMPK and declines in cyclin E2 as well as phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, resulting in cell cycle arrest, senescence and necrosis. This study points to the possibility of using WZB117 as a prototype for development of anticancer therapeutics targeting GLUT-1-mediated glucose transport and glucose metabolism.

### 4. Dysregulation of enzymes/protein factors involved in glycolysis in cancer cells

Glycolysis is the integrate center of primary metabolism pathways. The rate of glucose utilization via the glycolytic pathway is highly regulated and depends upon the energetic and metabolic needs of the cell. It is coordinated with other pathways of energy generation and utilization, including gluconeogenesis, PPP, and the TCA cycle [88].

Glycolytic flux in eukaryotic organisms is tightly controlled by allosteric enzymes that retain their regulation by feedback inhibition in spite of the elevated activities of intermediary enzymes. This statement is supported by the experiments in Escherichia coli [89] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [90], where over-expression of all glycolytic enzymes had no significant effect on the rate of glucose consumption. Therefore, it is likely that important modifications of the kinetics of regulatory enzymes are also involved in metabolic changes that occur during the transformation of normal mammalian cells into cancer cells [91]. Glycolysis is tightly regulated by three key allosteric enzymes: hexokinase (HK), 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1) and pyruvate kinase (PK). Each catalyzes individual irreversible step (Fig. 1). These enzymes, in turn, are tightly regulated by a number of oncogenes and tumor suppressors and the normal control of these enzymes appears to be impaired in tumor cells.

#### 4.1. Regulation of hexose kinases

When it enters the cells via glucose transporters, hexose (glucose or fructose) is phosphorylated by hexose kinases (HK) (glucose kinase or fructose kinase) to a hexose phosphate (glucose-phosphate)

![Figure 1](#fig1)

**Fig. 1. Regulation of glucose transporters, glycolysis by GSK-3/(TSC2)/(mTOR)/AKT, C-Myc, HIF-1 and p53 HIF-1α: hypoxia inducible factor 1α; GSK-3: glycogen synthase kinase-3; GLUT1–4: glucose transporters 1–4; mTOR: the mammalian target of rapamycin; PFK1: phosphofructokinase-1; TGAR: TP53-induced glycolytic and apoptotic regulator; TSC2: tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2.**
or fructose phosphate). HK is the first regulatory step of glycolysis and is feedback inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P).

There are four important mammalian HK isozymes designated HKI, HKII, HKIII and HKIV. They vary in subcellular locations and kinetics with respect to different substrates and conditions, and physiological functions. HKI is found in all mammalian tissues and is considered a “housekeeping enzyme,” unaffected by most physiological, hormonal, and metabolic changes. HKII is the principal isoform regulated in many cell types. HKIII is substrate-inhibited by glucose at physiologic concentrations. Mammalian HKIV (also known as glucokinase) differs from other HKs in kinetics and functions. The location of the phosphorylation on a subcellular level occurs when glucokinase translocates between the cytoplasm and nucleus of liver cells. HKIV can only phosphorylate glucose if the concentration of this substrate is high enough because its Km for glucose is 100 times higher than that of other three HKs. It is monomeric, about 50kDa, displays positive cooperativity with glucose, and is not allosterically inhibited by G6P. It is present in the liver, pancreas, hypothalamus, small intestine, and perhaps certain other neuroendocrine cells, and plays an important regulatory role in glucose metabolism.

Among the HKs, HKII is the predominant isoform in tumor cells where it is bound to the mitochondrial outer membrane facing the cytosol [92]. Microlocation of this enzyme enables its preferential access to newly synthesized ATP for phosphorylating glucose, and it is resistant to product inhibition [92]. The association of HKII with mitochondria is activated by Akt, and the mitochondria-associated HKII is involved in inhibition of apoptosis [93,94] through its binding to the voltage-dependent anion channel, negatively modulating truncated BH3-interacting domain death agonist and perhaps to BCL1 antagonist of cell death (BAD) [95,96]. HKII promoter contains functionally active response elements for p53 and is up-regulated by p53 [97]. Mitochondrially-bound HKII is thought to be a key player in the growth and survival of many cancers and an ideal prospect for therapeutic intervention because drugs that disassociate HKII from mitochondrial membrane caused apoptosis and interfered with growth pathways [98].

### 4.2. Regulation of phosphofructokinase by TIGAR, HIF-1 and posttranslational modifications

6-Phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1) catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) using MgATP as a phosphoryl donor [99] (Fig. 1). PFK catalyzes the first irreversible, rate-limiting step and the most important control point unique to the glycolytic pathway, which surmounts the regulatory roles of the other two allosteric enzymes [100]. PFK1 is stimulated by ADP/AMP whereas citrate and ATP act as strong inhibitors [99,101]. Therefore, glycolysis is slowed when cellular ATP concentrations are high. ATP binds to a site on PFK distinct from the active site, causing a conformational change due to rotation of the positions of Arg<sup>162</sup> and Glu<sup>161</sup>. In the high-affinity state, the positive charge on Arg<sup>162</sup> stabilizes the negative charge on the phosphate of F6P, and Km is low. In the low-affinity state, the negative charge on Glu<sup>161</sup> repels F6P.

Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP) is a powerful allosteric regulator for controlling carbon flux through glycolysis by stimulating PFK to convert F6P to F1,6-P2. The synthesis and degradation of F-2,6-P2 depend upon 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase), which has both kinase and phosphatase activities [102–104]. This bifunctional enzyme is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that are dependent upon intracellular cAMP levels [105]. Furthermore, PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase synthesis can be induced by mitogens, growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines, implicating its role in setting the glycolytic rate under multiple physiologic and pathologic conditions [106]. This inducible gene for PFK-2 is expressed constitutively in several human cancer cell lines and is found to be required for tumor cell growth. Inhibition of inducible PFK-2 protein expression decreases the intracellular level of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, a product of the PPP and an important precursor of purines and pyrimidines for nucleic acid biosynthesis [106].

Four different genes coding different isozymes (PFKFB1–4) have been identified to date [107–110]. PFKFBs 1–4 differ not only in their tissue distribution but also in their kinetic and regulatory properties. The PFKFB3 isozyme has the highest kinase/phosphatase activity ratio and thus maintains elevated F-2,6-P2 levels, which in turn sustains high glycolytic rates [106,111]. Significantly, this isoform is constitutively expressed in several human cancer cell lines having high proliferative rates that require the elevated activity of the enzyme for the synthesis of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate [106,112,113]. The expression of PFKFB is highly elevated in multiple aggressive primary neoplasms, including colon, breast, ovarian, and thyroid carcinomas and is induced by hypoxia in cultured human colon adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, PFKFB3 and Fru-2,6-P2 levels increase specifically during S phase of the cell cycle in normal lung fibroblasts [114]. Thus, this could explain the high glycolytic rates present in transformed cells even under normal oxygen tension. It has been shown [113] that inhibition of glycolysis in tumor cells by three PFK-2 inhibitors, i.e. N-(2-methoxyethyl)-bromoacetamide, N-(2-ethoxyethyl)-bromoacetamide, and N-(3-methoxypropyl)-bromoacetamide, caused anticancer effects in P388 transplant BDF1 mice and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.

#### 4.2.1. Regulation of PFK-1 by TP53-induced glycolytic and apoptotic regulator (TIGAR)

Bensaad et al. [33] identified a p53-inducible regulator of glycolysis and apoptosis (TIGAR), which shares functional sequence similarities with the bisphosphate domain (FBPase) of PFK-2/FBPase-2 and can modulate apoptosis in a cell-type-dependent manner. It has been observed [115] that cells over-expressing Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase showed enhanced PPP flux and resistance to oxidative stress. Similarly, TIGAR causes decline in Fru-2,6-P2 levels and thereby blocks glycolysis at this step, directing the pathway into PPP to produce NADPH and nucleotides. Increasing TIGAR expression, thus, inhibits glycolysis and stimulates PPP. TIGAR can lower ROS levels and decrease sensitivity to p53 and other ROS-associated apoptotic signals, and could be a component in mediating the tumor-suppressing effects of p53 [33]. A model for TIGAR function in anti-oxidative respond has been proposed [33]: i.e. NADPH produced by PPP is required to generate reduced glutathione (GSH) and thereby decrease ROS levels. GSH, a tripeptide with free sulfhydryl group, is required to combat oxidative stress and maintain the normal reduced state in the cells [116]. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase using NADPH generated by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Glutathione peroxidase reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O by oxidizing GSH. Thus, the PPP plays an essential role in protection from oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis [117] and an ability of TIGAR to increase the flux through the PPP leads to the removal of intracellular ROS. Indeed, treatment of cells with trans-androsterone, a specific inhibitor of G6PDH, inhibited PPP and prevented the anti-apoptotic activity of TIGAR. Expression of TIGAR or the isolated FBPase-2 domain increased the GSH/GSSG ratio, while decrease of endogenous TIGAR expression lowered it [33].

In addition to regulation of PFK, p53 is also a transcriptional activator of the muscle-specific phosphoglycerate mutase gene and contributes in vivo to the control of its cardiac expression [118].

#### 4.2.2. Regulation of PFK-1 by HIF-1α

As mentioned above, the steady state levels of F-2,6-P2 are maintained by PFK-2/F2,6-Bpase. Minchenko et al. [88] showed that PFKFB3 was highly induced by hypoxia and that this induction could be replicated by the use of an inhibitor of the prolyl hydroxylase
enzymes responsible for the von Hippel Lindau (VHL)-dependent destabilization and tagging of HIF-1α. The dependence of the PFKFB3 gene on HIF-1 was confirmed by its over-expression in VHL-deficient cells and by the lack of hypoxic induction in mouse embryonic fibroblasts conditionally nullizygous for HIF-1α. Activation of glycolytic genes by HIF-1 is considered critical for metabolic adaptation to hypoxia through increased conversion of glucose to pyruvate and subsequently to lactate. Beside PFK-1, HIF-1α is involved in the regulation of almost all the other enzymes in glycolysis [119] (Fig. 1).

### 4.2.3. Posttranslational modifications of PFK1

In human tissues, three types of PFK proteins have been identified: the muscle type (PFK-M) (MW=85,051Da) [120], liver type (PFK-L) (MW=84,917Da) [121], and type-C (PFK-1, C-type) found in platelets, brain, and other tissues [122]. These isoenzymes are strongly inhibited by citrate, with IC₅₀ values of 0.08, 0.13 and 0.18 mM for brain (platelet), muscle, and liver PFK1, respectively [123]. PFK1 is normally under the control of feedback inhibition. All human PFK1 isoforms are intensely inhibited by ATP at concentrations higher than 0.05 mM. The negative effects of ATP can be antagonized by F-2,6-BP to some extent [124].

A PFK1 isoform less sensitive to citrate inhibition (Kᵢ=0.75 mM citrate) and more sensitive to activation by Fru-2, 6-P2 was seen in human glioma [125]. A PFK1 isoform with similar kinetic characteristics was also observed in the fast-growing rodent AS-30D hepatoma cells, which showed complete insensitivity toward its allosteric inhibitors, citrate and ATP, in the presence of physiological concentrations of F-2,6-BP. In addition, the enzyme was highly activated by its activators, NH₄⁺, AMP, and F-2,6-BP [126].

A citrate inhibition-resistant form of PFK1 that is activated to a higher level by allosteric activators has been identified in the fungus [127–129]. These kinetic characteristics are attributed to the 49-kDa subunits, which are relatively small PFK1 molecules with respect to other eukaryotic PFK1s of approximately 85 kDa. Further studies have shown that the shorter 49-kDa fragments are formed by a two-step posttranslational modification of the native 85-kDa enzyme [128–130]. More recently, Smerc et al. [91] reported that the native 85-kDa PFK1, which is normally under the control of feedback inhibition by citrate and ATP, is subjected to posttranslational modification. Proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal portion of the 85-kDa PFK1 led to an active, shorter 47-kDa fragment that was insensitive to citrate and ATP inhibition. More importantly, only the short 47-kDa fragment but not the native 85-kDa PFK1 was detected in tumorigenic cell lines including B16-F10 melanoma, HeLa cells carcinoma, Nb2-11 lymphoma and Tf-1 lymphoma. Similar fragments were also detected in a tumor tissue that developed in mice after the subcutaneous infection with tumorigenic B16-F10 cells. Limited proteolytic digestion of the rabbit muscle PFK-M generated an active citrate inhibition-resistant shorter form, indicating that a single posttranslational modification step exists. The insertion of modified truncated human *pfkM* genes also stimulated glucose consumption and lactate excretion in stable transfectants of non-tumorigenic human HEK cell, suggesting the important role of shorter PFK1 fragments in enhancing glycolytic flux. Thus, posttranslational modification of PFK1 enzyme might be the pivotal factor of deregulated glycolytic flux in tumors that in combination with altered signaling mechanisms essentially supports fast proliferation of cancer cells. The insertion of modified truncated human *pfkM* genes also stimulated glucose consumption and lactate excretion in stable transfectants of non-tumorigenic human HEK cell, suggesting the important role of shorter PFK1 fragments in enhancing glycolytic flux.

### 4.3. Dysregulation of pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase in cancer cells

#### 4.3.1. Dysregulation of pyruvate kinase

Pyruvate kinase (PK) (EC2.7.1.40) is an enzyme involved in the final step of glycolysis. It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP, yielding one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of ATP [131]. In anaerobic glycolysis, lactate dehydrogenase will utilize the NADH produced by glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase to reduce pyruvate to lactate. PK has four isozymes (L, R, M1, and M2) that are encoded by two different genes of PK L and M. Differential splicing produces L- and R-type PK mRNA and M1- and M2-type PK mRNA from the PK L gene and the PK M gene, respectively. They differ in primary structure and regulation [132].

It have been shown that tumor cells exclusively express the embryonic M2 isoform of PK (PK-M2) that can be activated by Fru-1,6-P2 while binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides to PK-M2 results in the release of the allosteric activator, leading to inhibition of enzymatic activity. PK-M2 has been known to play an important role in anaerobic glycolysis and cancer metabolism [133]. Deactivation of PK-M2 in tumor cells is believed to divert glucose metabolism from energy production to anabolic processes [133,134].

PK-M2 is important for the growth of several human cell lines including glioma cell lines, brain tumor stem cells, and transformed human astrocytes [135]. Decreased expression and activity of PK-M2 have been linked to cisplatin resistance in human gastric carcinoma cell lines [136] and oxaliplatin resistance in patients with colorectal cancer and in human cell lines [137]. PK-M2 has been identified as a direct target of the tumor-suppressive miR-326. Glioma cells with high levels of PK-M2 expressed lower levels of miR-326, suggestive of endogenous regulation of PKM2 by miR-326. It is also expressed in primary glioblastoma samples but absent in normal brain temporal lobe. siRNA knockdown of PK-M2 leads to decreased glioma cell and glioma stem cell proliferation, invasiveness, clonogenicity, and survival. Furthermore, PK-M2 knockdown impaired glioma cell metabolism, with decreased glutathione and ATP levels and increased activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. Since PK-M2 is expressed in glioma cells and is important for their survival, but is lacking in the normal brain, its manipulation may serve as a brain-sparing therapy for glioblastoma [135].

Two missense mutations, H391Y and K422R, in PK-M2 have been found in cells from Bloom syndrome patients, prone to develop cancer. The H391Y showed a 6-fold increase in affinity for its substrate PEP and behaved like a non-allosteric protein with compromised cooperative binding, whereas the affinity for PEP was lost significantly in K422R. Unlike K422R, H391Y showed enhanced thermal stability, stability over a range of pH values, a lesser effect of the allosteric inhibitor and resistance toward structural alteration upon binding of the activator (Fro-1,6-BP) and inhibitor Both mutants showed a slight shift in the pH optimum from 7.4 to 7.0 [138]. Gupta et al. [139] further investigated the mechanisms and functional implication of the H391Y and K422R mutations of PKM₂. They observed that the co-expression of homotetrameric wild type and mutant PKM₂ in the cellular milieu resulted in substantiated interaction between the two at the monomer level in vitro experiments and that the cross-monomer interaction significantly altered the oligomeric state of PK-M2 by favoring dimerization and heterotetramerization. In silico study provided an added support in showing that hetero-oligomerization was energetically favorable. The hetero-oligomeric populations of PK-M₂ showed altered activity and affinity, and their expression resulted in an increased growth rate of mammalian cells, along with an increased rate of polyploidy. These features are known to be essential to tumor progression.

### 4.3.2. Regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase

The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex contributes to transforming pyruvate into acetyl-CoA via pyruvate decarboxylation. Acetyl-CoA may then be used in the TCA cycle to carry out cellular respiration. Thus, PDH contributes to linking the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the TCA cycle and releasing energy via NADH.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) (EC 2.7.11.2) is a kinase enzyme which acts to inactivate the enzyme activity of PDH by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of three specific serine residues (site 1, Ser-264; site 2, Ser-271; site 3, Ser-203) of the α subunit of
the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component in PDH using ATP [140]. Normally, the active site of PDH is in a stabilized and ordered conformation supported by a network of hydrogen bonds. Phosphorylation at site 1 by PDK causes steric clashes with another nearby serine residue due to both the increased size and negative charges associated with the phosphorylated residue [141]. This disrupts the hydrogen bond network and disorders the conformation of two phosphorylation loops. These loops prevent the reductive acetylation step, thus halting overall activity of the enzyme [142]. By downregulating the activity of this complex, PDK decreases the oxidation of pyruvate in mitochondria and increases the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the cytosol.

Like PFK, PDK is regulated both by allosteric effectors and by covalent modifications such as phosphorylation. PDK is stimulated by ATP, NADH and acetyl-CoA but is inhibited by ADP, NAD+, CoA-SH, pyruvate, and alanine (a biosynthetic product of pyruvate) acting as allosteric inhibitors of PDK [143]. The activity of PDK has been shown to be consistently higher in cancer cells than in normal cells [144].

There are four known isoforms of PDK, namely PDK1, PDK2, PDK3 and PDK4, in humans and they share 70% identity but differ greatly near their N-terminus [145]. PDK1 is ample in heart cells. PDK3 is most abundant in testis. PDK2 is present in most tissues but low in spleen and lung cells. PDK4 is predominantly found in skeletal muscle and heart tissues [140].

It has been shown that HIF-1 is involved in regulation of PDK1 [146,147]. PDK1 has shown to have increased activity in hypoxic cancer cells due to the presence of HIF-1. Kim et al. [146] observed that HIF-1α suppresses metabolism through TCA cycle by directly trans-activating the PDK1. Forced PDK1 expression in hypoxia HIF-1α null cells increases ATP levels, attenuates hypoxic ROS generation, and rescues these cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These studies reveal a hypoxia-induced metabolic switch that shunts glucose metabolisms from the mitochondria to glycolysis to maintain ATP production and to prevent toxic ROS production.

Although hypoxic intratumoral conditions account for HIF-1α stabilization and induction of anaerobic metabolism, recent studies suggest that high pyruvate concentrations also result in HIF1α stabilization independently of hypoxia. Koukourakis et al. [147] observed that the PDH/PDK pathway is repressed in 73% of non-small cell lung carcinomas, which may be a key reason for HIF-1α stabilization and “aerobic glycolysis.” However, about half of PDH-deficient carcinomas are unable to switch on the HIF-1 pathway, and patients harboring these tumors have an excellent postoperative outcome. A small subgroup of clinically aggressive tumors maintains a coherent PDH and HIF/LDH5 expression. In contrast to cancer cells, fibroblasts in the tumor-supporting stroma exhibit an intense PDH but reduced PDK1 expression favoring maximum PDH activity. This means that stroma may use lactic acid produced by tumor cells, preventing the creation of an intolerable intratumoral acidic environment at the same time.

PDK1 inhibition has been suggested as an antitumor therapy since PDK1 prevents apoptosis in these cancerous cells [148]. Indeed, AZD7545 and dichloroacetate have been shown to bind to PDK1 and inhibit its kinase activity [149]. These inhibitors have the similar inhibitory effects on PDK3 [149], which are overexpressed in colon cancer cell lines [150]. An inhibitor of PK-M2, dichloroacetic acid (DCA), can block growth of tumors in xenograft models [34].

More recently, Contractor et al. [34] reported that p53 negatively regulated PDK transcription by decreasing levels of PDK-2 and its product, the inactive form of the PDH complex (P-Pdc), both of which are key regulators of pyruvate metabolism. Decreased levels of PDK2 and P-Pdc in turn promoted conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA instead of lactate. Thus, wild-type p53 limited lactate production in cancer cells unless Pdk2 could be elevated.

5. Altered expression/functions of enzymes/tumor suppressors involved TCA cycle

5.1. TCA cycle in cancer cells

TCA cycle (also known as citric acid cycle or the Krebs cycle) (Fig. 2) is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic living organisms to generate energy through the oxidation of pyruvate derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide and water. In addition, TCA cycle provides precursors for the biosynthesis of compounds including certain amino acids as well as the reducing agent NADH that is used in numerous biochemical reactions. It is central importance for many biochemical pathways. Because of its crucial role for basal metabolism of the cells, TCA cycle has long been considered as no significant and primary defect in its enzyme components. However, genetic studies have revealed that mutations in several mitochondrial proteins including succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (FH), which lead to dysfunction of TCA cycle, could be a cause of human diseases and tumor formation (for review see [16]).

5.2. Mutations of genes that encode enzymes in TCA cycle in cancer cells

Several mitochondrial proteins including SDH and FH, both are enzymes of TCA cycle, are tumor suppressors. It has been shown that a number mutations in genes that encode enzymes including aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1(IDH1), SDH and FH in TCA cycle lead to some types of cancer.

5.2.1. Mitochondrial aconitase in cancer cells

Aconitase is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the stereospecific isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate in the TCA cycle [151,152]. Aconitase is regarded as the key enzyme in citrate oxidation in human prostate epithelial cells, a unique organ that produces and releases large amounts of citrate. The abnormal expression and activity of aconitase have been implicated in tumorigenesis of the prostate [153]. It has been observed that the mRNA levels of mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitases and aconitase activity as well as fatty acid synthase are significantly higher in metastatic PC-3M cells than in normal human prostate cells (PNT2-C2) [153]. Using immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissue sections and malignant prostate cell lines, Singh et al. [154] detected the presence of mitochondrial-aconitase (m-aconitase) in the mitochondrial compartment in PC-3, LNCaP, and DU-145 malignant prostate cell lines and prostate tissue sections from prostate cancer subjects where mitochondrial aconitase enzyme is present in the glandular epithelium of normal glands, hyperplastic glands, adenocarcinomatous glands, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic foci. However, no significant difference in m-aconitase enzyme levels was seen in the glandular epithelium of citrate-producing adenomatous glands versus the citrate-oxidizing adenocarcinomatous glands. Tsui et al. [155] observed that p53 down-regulated the gene expression of m-aconitase in human prostate carcinoma cells.

5.2.2. Mutations of IDH1 in cancer cells

IDH1 converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (2-KG) with generation of NADH. Up to 12% of glioblastoma tumors have spontaneous point mutations in IDH1 genes [156]. Mutations that affected amino acid ${}^{132}$ of IDH1 have also been identified in grades II and III astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas that developed from these lower-grade lesions [157]. Similar mutations in IDH2 at residue Arg ${}^{172}$ in the active site have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia [158] and other diseases [159]. These mutations disable the enzyme's normal ability to convert isocitrate to 2-KG and confer on the enzymes a new function, i.e. the ability to convert 2-KG to d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) [159,160]. The elevated levels of

### 5.2.3. Mutations of SDHD in cancer cells

SDHD, an enzyme complex consisting of four subunits A, B, C and D, catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. SDHD is bound to the inner membrane of mammalian mitochondria. It is the only enzyme that participates in both the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain [161]. Inherited or somatic mutations in subunits B, C, or D of SDH have been associated with several types of cancers including pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma renal cell carcinoma and papillary thyroid cancers [162–166]. Reduced expression and loss of heterozygosity of SDHD gene are observed in gastric and colon carcinoma [167]. The R22X mutation of SDHD gene in hereditary paraganglioma abolishes the enzymatic activity of complex II of mitochondrial respiratory chain and activates HIF-1α, leading to increased expression of HIF-1α-regulated genes [168–170]. Selak et al. [171] have shown that succinate is accumulated due to SDHD down-regulation and transmits an “oncogenic” signal from mitochondria to the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, succinate inhibits HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylase, leading to HIF-1α stabilization under normoxic conditions. Thus, succinate can increase expression of genes that facilitate angiogenesis, metastasis, and glycolysis, ultimately leading to tumor progression. These results suggest a mechanistic link between SDHD mutations and HIF-1α induction, providing an explanation for the highly vascular tumors that develop in the absence of VHL mutations.

### 5.2.4. Mutations of FU in cancer cells

FH is an enzyme of the TCA cycle that catalyzes the reversible hydration/dehydration of fumarate to malate. Mutations in the FH gene have been identified in chromosome 1q42.3-43 mapped to the genetic locus for multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyoma syndrome (MCL), which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, manifesting as skin leiomyoma and uterine fibroids in affected individuals [172]. Germline mutations in the FH gene predispose to multiple MCL and MCL-associated renal cell cancer. Martinez-Mir et al. [173] performed the clinical and mutational analysis of five families with MCL. They identified five mutations that affect the highly conserved residues of the FH protein. These mutations include a nonsense mutation Q142X (amino acid residue 185 in the mitochondrial isoform); a deletion of four nucleotides in exon 7 and three missense mutations, i.e. a G>T transversion at nucleotide position 473 in exon 4, leading to the missense mutation S115I (mitochondrial amino acid residue 158; family MCL-4), a C>T transition at position 952 in exon 7 resulting in the missense mutation H275Y (mitochondrial amino acid residue 318; family MCL-1), and a G>C transversion at position 1180 in exon 8, creating the missense mutation V351L (mitochondrial amino acid residue 394; family MCL-3). These results provide evidence for the role of the FH gene in the pathogenesis of MCL. Reduced FH expression has been seen in clear cell renal cancer, the most common histologic variant of kidney cancer, leading to the accumulation of HIF-2α, which is known to promote renal carcinogenesis, migration and invasion whereas over-expression of FH in renal cancer cells inhibits cellular migration and invasion [174]. These data provide novel insights into the tumor suppressor functions of FH in sporadic kidney cancer.

FH-deficient cells and tissues accumulate high levels of fumarate, which may act as an oncometabolite and contribute to tumorigenesis. Fumarate has been proposed to have a role in the covalent modification of cysteine residues to S-(2-succinyl) cysteine (2SC) (termed protein succination). Bardella et al. [175] assessed 2SC levels in the models of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) syndrome. They observed robust detection of 2SC in Fh1 (murine FH)-deficient renal cysts and in a retrospective series of HLRCC tumors with established FH mutations. Importantly, 2SC was undetectable in normal

tissues and tumor types not associated with HLRCC. In a prospective evaluation of cases referred for genetic testing for HLRCC, the presence of 2SC-modified proteins (2SCP) correctly predicted genetic alterations in FH in every case. In two series of unselected type II papillary renal cancer (PRCC), prospectively analyzed by 2SCP staining followed by genetic analysis, the biomarker accurately identified FH mutations. More recent studies [69,176] have revealed that fumarate modifies cysteine residues within the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which inhibits the activity of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 has the ability to achieve cytoprotection by regulating the expression of antioxidative stress enzymes/proteins. Thus, this 2SCP modification in KEAP1 abrogates its ability to repress the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response pathway. These studies suggest a role for KEAP1/Nrf2 dysregulation in FH-associated tumors.

## 6. Regulation of glutaminolysis by C-Myc and p53

### 6.1. Glutamine and glutaminolysis

Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in the circulation and in intracellular pools. It is not only a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids, proteins, nucleotides, and a number of biologically important molecules, but also plays a regulatory role in several cell-specific processes including metabolism (e.g., oxidative fuel, gluconeogenic precursor, and lipogenic precursor), cell integrity (apoptosis and cell proliferation), protein synthesis, and degradation, contractile protein mass, redox potential, respiratory burst, insulin resistance, insulin secretion, and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis. Glutamine, an essential nutrient for cancer cell proliferation, has been shown to regulate the expression of many genes related to metabolism, signal transduction, cell defense and repair, and to activate intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, the function of glutamine goes beyond that of a simple metabolic fuel or protein precursor [177–180].

Glutaminolysis is a series of biochemical reactions by which glutamine is degraded to glutamate, aspartate, CO₂, pyruvate, lactate, alanine, and citrate. Glutamine is imported into cells through high-affinity surface glutamine importers such as ASCT2 and SN2 [18]. Once it enters the cells, the majority of glutamine either donates nitrogen to macromolecules or is deaminated by glutaminases, which converts glutamine to glutamate (Glu). Glu has several fates. It can be converted directly to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione cysteine ligase (GCL). The reduced GSH, one of the most abundant antioxidants present in mammalian cells, is vital to controlling the redox state of the subcellular compartments [181]. Glu can also be catabolized through removal of α-nitrogen by aminotransferases or glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) produces α-KG, an integral component of TCA cycle through the TCA cycle for the production of ATP or serves as substrate for biosynthesis of the polyglutamated folic acid or processed further in mitochondria. The cyclization of glutamate produces proline, an amino acid important for synthesis of collagen and connective tissue. Alternatively, some tissues e.g. rat liver and brown adipocyte cell lines can reductively carboxylate α-KG to generate citrate [182,183]. There is evidence indicating that a fraction glutamine-derived carbon can exit the TCA cycle as malate and serve as substrate of malic enzymes 1, which produces NADPH [184]. More recently, Metallo et al. [185] have shown that human cells use reductive metabolism of α-KG to synthesize acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis. This IDH1-dependent pathway is active in most cell lines under normal culture conditions, but cells grown under hypoxia rely almost exclusively on the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-KG for de novo lipogenesis. Furthermore, renal cell lines deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein preferentially use reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis even at normal oxygen levels. These results identify a critical role for oxygen in regulating carbon use to produce acetyl-CoA and support lipid synthesis in mammalian cells. It has been reported [186] that 17β-estradiol increased

the carbon flow through PPP and enhanced glutamine consumption primarily to provide biosynthetic precursors.

#### 6.1.1. Regulation of glutamine transport and glutaminase-1 by c-Myc

In order to compensate for “Warburg's Effect” and to help maintain a functioning TCA cycle, cancer cells often rely on elevated glutamine metabolism through a marked elevation of glutaminase activity [187]. Several studies [18,19,43] have revealed that c-Myc plays a major role in regulating glutaminolysis.

Le et al. [43] investigated the metabolic responses of a c-Myc-inducible human Burkitt lymphoma model P493 cell line to aerobic and hypoxic conditions, and to glucose deprivation, using [U-¹³C]-glucose as the tracer isotope for resolving metabolomics. They observed that glutamine import and metabolism through the TCA cycle persisted under hypoxia, and that glutamine contributed significantly to citrate carbons. Under glucose deprivation, glutamine-derived fumarate, malate, and citrate were significantly increased. The ¹³C-labeling patterns demonstrated an alternative energy-generating glutaminolysis pathway involving a glucose-independent TCA cycle.

There are three isoforms of glutaminases, GLS1, GLS2, and GLSC (a splice variant of GLS1) [180]. GLS1 is required for cell cycle progression through S phase to cell division [188]. GLS2 gene encodes a mitochondrial glutaminase, a key enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and thereby a regulator of glutathione (GSH) synthesis and energy production [189,190]. It has been shown that glutamine importers and GLS1 expression are up-regulated by c-Myc [18,19,191] and that GLS2 expression is up-regulated by p53 [35,36,192].

Wise et al. [18] reported that c-Myc activated the transcription of glutamine importers ASCT2 and SN2 by selectively binding to the promoter regions of both genes that are required for glutamine uptake and metabolism. A consequence of this c-Myc-dependent glutaminolysis is the reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism to depend on glutamine catabolism to sustain cellular viability and TCA cycle anaplerosis. The ability of c-Myc-expressing cells to engage in glutaminolysis does not depend on concomitant activation of PI3K or AKT. The stimulation of mitochondrial glutamine metabolism resulted in reduced glucose carbon entering the TCA cycle and a decreased contribution of glucose to the mitochondrial-dependent synthesis of phospholipids. c-Myc has been found to induce glutamine transporters SLC5A1 and SLC7A1 and thus directly increase glutamine uptake [6,19]. Gao et al. [19] reported that the c-Myc transcriptionally up-regulated the expression of mitochondrial glutaminase-1 in human P-493 B lymphoma cells and PC3 prostate cancer cells through repressing microRNAs miR-23a and miR-23b that target the GLS's 3′ untranslated regions and that glutamine and glutaminase are necessary for Myc-mediated cancer cell proliferation and survival. The unique means by which c-Myc regulates glutaminase uncovers a link between c-Myc regulation of miRNAs, glutamine metabolism, and ROS homeostasis. Together, these studies suggest that oncogenic levels of c-Myc induce a transcriptional program that promotes glutaminolysis and triggers cellular addiction to glutamine as a bioenergetic substrate.

### 6.2. Regulation of GLS2 by p53 and GLS2 as an potential target for cancer therapy

GLS2 regulates cellular energy metabolism by increasing production of glutamate and α-KG, which in turn results in enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. Furthermore, GLS2 also regulates antioxidant defense function in cells by increasing reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and decreasing ROS levels, which, in turn, protects cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. It has been shown that activation of p53 increases the GLS2 expression under both non-stressed and stressed conditions and increases the levels of glutamate and α-KG, mitochondrial respiration rate, and GSH levels, and decreases ROS levels in cells [35,36].

GSL2 has been identified as a unique p53 target gene to mediate the role of p53 in both cellular energy metabolism and antioxidant defense mechanism, as demonstrated by several lines of evidence [35,36,122]: a) human GLS2 gene promoter contains a p53 consensus DNA-binding element and its expression is induced in response to DNA damage or oxidative stress in a p53-dependent manner and p53 associates with the GLS2 promoter; b) p53 and GLS2 modulate intracellular ROS levels and GSH/GSSG ratio in the cells and elevated GLS2 levels facilitate glutamine metabolism and lowers intracellular ROS levels, resulting in an overall decrease in DNA oxidation, and GLS2 protect cells from DNA oxidation and ROS-sensitive apoptosis; c) the expression of GLS2 is loss in human liver tumors whereas GLS2 over-expression reduces tumor cell colony formation abilities. Furthermore, GLS2 expression is reduced in liver tumors compared with normal tissues. These results demonstrate that GLS2, as a unique p53 target gene, is a mediator of p53 for its roles in energy metabolism and antioxidant defense, which can contribute to its role in tumor suppression and repairable genotoxic stress

The essential role of glutamine metabolism in cell survival and proliferation under hypoxia and glucose deficiency makes these cancer cells susceptible to the glutaminase inhibitor BPTES and hence could be targeted for cancer therapy. For example, Wang et al. [193] identified a small molecule inhibitor that blocks oncogenic transformation induced by Rho GTPases in fibroblasts, and the growth of human breast cancer and B lymphoma cells, without affecting normal cells. The target of this inhibitor has been identified to be glutaminase. Transformed fibroblasts and breast cancer cells have been observed to exhibit elevated glutaminase activity, which is dependent on Rho GTPases and NF-κB activity and is blocked by the small molecule inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that targeting glutaminase activity can inhibit oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, a glutamine-analog, acivicin, has been found to inhibit tumor growth and tumor-induced angiogenesis in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. Toy et al. [194] reported that combination of acivicin with *E. coli* glutaminase synergistically reduced in vitro proliferation and matrigel invasion of human MCF-7 and OAW-42 cells through inhibiting the release of VEGF and MMP-9 by cells in culture supernatant significantly than single agent treatment.

### 7. Conclusion remarks

In this work, we described the current knowledge about the dysregulation of the key proteins/enzymes involved in glucose transport, glycolysis, TCA cycle and glutaminolysis by p53, c-Myc and HIF-1α in cancer cells, as summarized in Figs. 1 and 2. The tumor suppressor p53 is involved in negative regulation of the key enzymes/protein factors including GTUTs 1–4 in glucose transport, HK, PFK, phosphoglycerate mutase, and PDK in glycolysis, and aconitase in TCA cycle. P53 also acts as positive regulator of GLS2 in glutaminolysis. Because homozygous loss and mutations of p53 are frequently found in many types of cancers [195], p53 could lost its regulatory functions in controlling these energy metabolism pathways, leading to abnormal expression of the enzymes/proteins involved in the key steps of these metabolic pathways.

The oncogenes C-Myc and HIF-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of many human cancers through linking altered cellular metabolism to tumorigenesis. The c-Myc regulates the expression of GLUTs1–4 in glucose transport. The c-Myc and HIF-1 are involved in the regulation of almost of all the enzymes in glycolysis pathway [5,6]. The c-Myc also directly regulates the glutamine transporters, ASCT2 and SN2, and/or is indirectly involved in enhancing glutaminase protein expression and glutamine metabolism by repression of microRNA 2, 3a/b. In addition to playing an important role in regulation of almost all the glycolytic enzymes [5], HIF-1 is involved in regulation of TCA cycle by binding to succinate Co-A synthase.

The alterations to cellular metabolism in cancer cells have been increasingly recognized as a crucial hallmark of cancer [7,196]. The alterations in the key steps in glucose transport and energy metabolism pathways by abnormal functions of c-Myc, HIF-1 and the loss function of p53 and perhaps other oncogenes and tumor suppressors in cancer cells have been used as biomarkers for diagnostic tools. Indeed, it was recently reported that up regulation of GLUT-1, HK-I, and HIF-1α was closely related with ${}^{18}$F-FDG uptake into mesothelioma cells, and that mTOR inhibitor induced a decrease in GLUT-1 expression and ${}^{18}$F-FDG uptake [197,198]. Furthermore, these important biomarkers/targets have been proposed to be translated for the development of promising anticancer therapies [5,6,40].
