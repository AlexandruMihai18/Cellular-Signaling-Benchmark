# Threonine phosphorylation times bacterial secretion

Hemantha D. Kulasekara and Samuel I. Miller

Bacterial protein secretion is an important process necessary for adhesion, motility, communication, nutrient acquisition, and virulence. Secretion is energy intensive and time sensitive, so it needs to be tightly regulated. Recent work indicates that threonine phosphorylation can provide this control.

Dedicated protein secretion by bacteria is required for the assembly of surface organelles and for the delivery of enzymes to the extracellular milieu. Many of these secreted substrates are essential for bacterial virulence for plants and animals because the secreted proteins and their surface structures often interact with host cells and modify host-cell processes. Secretion is a diverse process, but it is most often accomplished by the assembly of multicomponent machines that deliver proteins across hydrophobic membranes. The secretion processes in Gram-negative bacteria have additional complexity because they possess both inner and outer membranes separated by a periplasmic space, which has an oxidizing environment like the endoplasmic reticulum. The complexity of delivering protein substrates from the reducing environment of the cytoplasm across both bacterial membranes has resulted in a number of diverse systems that are likely to be based on whether proteins are oxidized before secretion. A common feature of known secretion systems is that their transcription and translation are tightly regulated in response to specific environmental cues to maximize efficiency and minimize the energy expenditure for apparatus assembly.

On page 797 of this issue, Mougous *et al.* report a novel eukaryotic-like threonine kinase–phosphatase mechanism that controls substrate secretion in a recently identified bacterial secretion system. Despite the importance of specialized secretion in bacteria and the diversity of kinases in nature, prior to this work, no one had identified protein phosphorylation as a mechanism to regulate secretion-system assembly or function. As this secretion system has been discovered recently, greater definition of the functional elements of the secretion system will be needed before it is possible to fully understand the molecular implications of this novel finding. Nevertheless, this work represents a major breakthrough, both by demonstrating the presence of post-translational regulation of secretion, as well as by defining an important new function for a serine–threonine kinase family member. Despite the abundance of such kinase genes in bacterial genomes, understanding of their function has been limited.

Most bacterial kinases that have been studied belong to the sensor histidine kinase family of proteins that, in response to a signal, transfer a phosphate group from a histidine residue to an aspartate residue of transcriptional regulators. Many microbiologists believed that serine–threonine kinases would largely have host targets, given their similarity to mammalian proteins. In some cases, these proteins function as bacterial effector proteins that are delivered to eukaryotic cells to disrupt eukaryotic signalling. Nevertheless, some prior data existed to indicate that serine–threonine kinases function as signalling molecules within bacteria: for example, a serine–threonine protein kinase was known to regulate fruiting-body formation — a multicellular developmental phase of the soil bacterium *Myxococcus xanthus*.

Interestingly, a *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* serine–threonine kinase called PpkA, one of the proteins analysed by Mougous *et al.*, was shown to have kinase activity *in vitro* several years ago, but its physiological role remained unknown. The initial clues about the function of this kinase came from work by Roest *et al.* on the plant bacterial symbiont *Rhizobium leguminosarum*, which identified a genetic locus essential for secreting proteins that prevent *Pisum sativum* root-nodule formation. Similar proteins for this secretion locus were predicted to be encoded within more than 50 bacterial genomes, and this led the Mekalanos group, in previous work, to demonstrate that this locus represents a secretion system used by *P. aeruginosa* and *Vibrio cholerae*, termed the Type 6 secretion system (T6SS), which may function in bacterial pathogenesis for animals. A recent report suggests that one of the T6SS loci in *Burkholderia mallei* is essential for virulence in a hamster model of infection. Few details of the substrates and function of the secretion system are known, hence the physiological role of these systems and the mechanistic details of how they work are in an early phase of discovery.

Gram-negative bacterial secretion systems generally have five essential components: an inner membrane channel component, a cytoplasmic ATPase for generating energy-dependent coupled transport, periplasmic components or elements that bridge the outer and inner membrane, an outer membrane pore, and at least one secreted substrate. Most of these components have not been definitively identified for T6SS, though some candidates exist. A conserved protein homologous to the AAA ATPase protease ClpB, known as ClpV1, is the likely energy source for secretion. Outer-membrane protein candidates for forming these transporters also exist.

One conserved secretion substrate, Hcp1, is known. Hcp1 is found in the periplasm prior to extracellular secretion and forms a hexameric ring on purification, suggesting that it may be a functional component of the secretion apparatus as a polymeric ring, or organelle, similar to the type III secretion needle complex proteins of the PrgI/J family. Deletion of ClpV1, or mutations in its ATPase domain, abolish secretion of periplasm-localized Hcp1, which indicates a role for ClpV1 in ATP-driven protein translocation. It seems likely that ClpV1 mediates secretion of some important periplasmic proteins that rapidly convert the incompletely assembled T6SS apparatus to a competent state. This is plausible as ClpV1 localizes as punctate foci in the cell when Hcp1 is present. This suggests that Hcp1 and associated proteins form a complex, which may extend from the inner membrane cytoplasmic face into the periplasm. Dedicated inner membrane proteins would likely be involved in such a complex.

Figure 1 Phosphorylation switch in *P. aeruginosa* T6SS before and after the PpkA-mediated phosphorylation event. (a) The regulatory switch is made of PpkA (Ser–Thr kinase), Fha1 (the substrate for phosphorylation) and PppA (the cognate phosphatase for Fha1). In the OFF state, PpkA is inactive. Therefore, the phosphatase activity of PppA keeps Fha1 dephosphorylated. (b) When appropriate environmental signals activate PpkA by binding to its VW domain, PpkA phosphorylates a threonine residue on Fha1 and activates the switch. Activated Fha1 recruits the ATPase ClpV1 and other cytoplasmic components to the inner membrane channel of the T6SS. This recruitment initiates the final assembly of the periplasmic and outer membrane components of the T6SS. In this secretion-competent state, Hcp1 and other (unknown) T6SS substrates are secreted. Hcp1 rings may also participate as a structural scaffold in the secretion of other substrates.

Mougous et al. also studied additional genes encoded in the T6SS locus for a role in regulating secretion. They demonstrate that a triad of genes encoding a predicted Ser–Thr kinase PpkA, its cognate phosphatase PppA, and a forkhead-associated domain protein known as Fha1 (Fig. 1), are all required for Hcp1 secretion. Furthermore, they demonstrate that PpkA and PppA coordinately regulate the secretion of periplasm-localized Hcp1 by modulating the phosphorylation status of Fha1. Under laboratory conditions, the authors find that activity of PppA maintains Fha1 in a dephosphorylated state. Fha1, regardless of its phosphorylation status, is localized to a punctate locus in the cell. However, under activating conditions (which are not yet known), a threonine residue of Fha1 becomes phosphorylated by PpkA, leading to the recruitment of T6SS components to the inner membrane, including ClpV1 and other identified T6SS proteins, which results in secretion of periplasmic Hcp1 across the outer membrane. Although the authors have identified an important switch in the cytoplasm for secretion, their work raises the question of how a cytoplasmic signal would promote Hcp1 transit across the periplasm. It is conceivable that Hcp1 polymers and other T6SS-specific periplasmic proteins may span the two membranes, thus creating a dedicated channel for protein translocation (Fig. 1). If this were the case, then threonine phosphorylation of the Fha1 protein would generate a signal through the inner membrane components that would either complete the assembly of mature T6SS spanning both membranes, or remove an inhibitory factor that keeps the T6SS from functioning, which is analogous to that of flagella or PrgI protein secretion¹².

The results from Mougous et al. on the assembly and regulation of *P. aeruginosa* T6SS represent the first known example of post-translational control of a bacterial secretory system. It is tempting to speculate that this regulatory mechanism may be conserved. However, it is far from invariant, even for T6SS. Not all bacteria that harbour the T6SS locus contain the kinase, the phosphatase and the forkhead-associated domain protein, perhaps reflecting functional modifications of this secretory system to serve the needs of individual bacterial species within specific niches through genetic adaptation. The *Salmonella typhimurium* and *S. typhi* T6SS locus lacks

NEWS AND VIEWS

$fha1$, $ppkA$ and $pppA$. The T6SS loci in *V. cholerae* and *Yersinia* species lack homologous genes for both classical eukaryotic kinases and phosphatases, but an $fha1$ homologue is present, raising the question of whether Fha1 is phosphorylated in these bacteria; if not, an entirely new mechanism for Fha-domain protein activation remains to be identified. Therefore, more work will be required to define whether this type of post-translational regulation is common to only a subset of T6SS. Regardless of this diversity, the work by Mougous *et al.* is a breakthrough in defining the post-translational control of bacterial secretion. Future studies will define whether this is a general mechanism to control a common, highly regulated and important bacterial function, or whether it is unique to a few systems and species. It seems likely that similar to the diversity and complexity of bacterial signal transduction and transcription systems, which were previously thought to be much simpler than those of eukaryotes, more examples such as those discovered in this work will be found in which bacterial multiprotein machines are regulated by complex mechanisms.

### Centriole biogenesis: a tale of two pathways

#### Jadranka Loncarek, Greenfield Sluder and Alexey Khodjakov

Two recent studies in *Drosophila* demonstrate that overexpression of proteins required for centriole duplication can not only induce centriole over-duplication in cells containing centrioles, but can also drive *de novo* centriole assembly in unfertilized eggs that initially lack centrioles. These studies offer a new perspective on the mechanisms that control centriole duplication.

The animal cell’s primary microtubule-organizing centre, the centrosome, contains a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM). As the number of centriole pairs determines the number of centrosomes the cell contains, the assembly of new centrioles must be under tight temporal and numerical control. At the time of DNA synthesis, each centriole duplicates to produce a mother and daughter centriole pair, which form two centrosomes to organize the mitotic spindle poles. If more than two centrosomes are present in the cell at the onset of mitosis, the cell often assembles a multipolar mitotic spindle. This inevitably leads to unequal chromosome distribution and consequent aneuploidy and genomic instability, both hallmarks of aggressive tumour cells¹. The rules of centriole duplication seem to be quite simple: each mother centriole produces just one daughter, and it does so only once per cell cycle. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern centriole duplication have been an enduring mystery. Two recent reports²,³ shed new light on this subject and raise a number of fascinating questions.

Rodrigues-Martin *et al.*² overexpressed Sak/Plk4, a kinase known to be a positive regulator of normal centriole duplication⁴,⁵, in *Drosophila* embryos and unfertilized eggs. In early syncytial-stage embryos, increased levels of Plk4 caused the amplification of centrioles that seemed to arise from the reduplication of the sperm centrioles. Importantly, overexpression of Plk4 in unfertilized eggs, which have no pre-existing centrioles because they are naturally

**Figure 1** Effects of Sak/Plk4 overexpression in different cell types. (a) In unfertilized *Drosophila* eggs, or in cultured cells that lack resident centrioles, overexpression of Sak/Plk4 induces *de novo* assembly of centrioles. Subsequently, these centrioles duplicate. (b) In contrast, when Sak/Plk4 is overexpressed in centriolar cells the *de novo* pathway is not activated, although the resident centrioles overduplicate.
