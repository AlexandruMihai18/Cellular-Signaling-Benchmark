Abstract

The sialyl-T antigen, sialylα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc-, is a common O-glycan structure in human glycoproteins and is synthesized by sialyltransferase ST3GalI. The enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli serotype O104 has the rare ability to synthesize a sialyl-T antigen mimic. We showed here that the wbwA gene of the E. coli O104 antigen synthesis gene cluster encodes an α2,3-sialyltransferase WbwA that transfers sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to Galβ1-3GalNAca-diphosphate-lipid acceptor. The NMR analysis of purified WbwA enzyme reaction product indicated that the sialyl-T antigen, sialylα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAca-diphosphate-lipid, was synthesized. We showed that the conserved HP motif, and Glu/Asp residues of two EDG motifs in WbwA are important for the activity. The characterization studies showed that WbwA from E. coli O104 is a monofunctional α2,3-sialyltransferase, and is distinct from human ST3GalI as well as all other known sialyltransferases due to its unique acceptor specificity. This work contributes to knowledge of the biosynthesis of bacterial virulence factors.

Importance

This is the first characterization of a sialyltransferase involved in the synthesis of an O antigen in *E. coli*. The enzyme contributes to the mimicry of human sialyl-T antigen and has a unique substrate specificity but very little sequence identity with other sialyltransferases. Thus the bacterial sialyltransferase is related to the human counterpart only by the similarity of biochemical activity.

Introduction

Sialic acids are ubiquitous in nature and contribute to the acidity and hydration of a glycoprotein, metal ion binding and epitope exposure. Sialylation affects the adhesive properties

of cells and has been implicated in the functions of cell surface receptors (1). Sialic acids are also found in O antigens of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or lipo-oligosaccharides, for example in Neisseria, Campylobacter, Pasteurella or Photobacteria (2–5). In E. coli, O antigens containing sialic acid linkages are rare and have only been found in serotypes O24, O55, O104, O145 and O171 (ECODAB). Specific proteins in the mammalian nervous system as well as a number of bacterial capsules carry polysialic acids that regulate adhesive properties of the cell. Masking their own antigens with human-like structures derived from glycolipids and glycoproteins may help bacteria to escape the host immune system. For example, *Campylobacter jejuni* has lipo-oligosaccharides resembling human gangliosides (2). However, cross-reactivity in infected humans can lead to autoimmune disease affecting the nervous system, for example the Guillain-Barré syndrome (3). O-acetylation of sialic acids controls the exposure of sialyl- epitopes (1).

The enterohemorrhagic, Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli* serotype O104 is the causative agent of outbreaks of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome with significant mortality (6, 7). The *E. coli* O104 antigen has the unusual repeating unit structure [D-Galα1-4Neu5,7,9Ac~3~α2-3-D-Galβ1-3-D-GalNAcβ1-]~n~ (8, ECODAB) which mimics the human sialyl-T antigen (sialylα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc-R) found in high amounts on cancer cell and tumor glycoproteins. However, the sialic acid residue in the mature *E. coli* O104 antigen is 7- and 9-O-acetylated and the sialyl-T antigen is therefore masked. Although O antigens have a number of biological functions in bacterial adhesion, colonization and interactions with host defenses (4), the specific biological role of the mimicry of the sialyl-T antigen structure in *E. coli* O104 is not clear. The enzymes synthesizing the sialyl-T antigen in bacteria could be of interest in the synthesis of tumor-selective sialyl-T and T antigens.

Sialyltransferases (SiaT) are ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes and in certain bacteria (9).

The bacterial SiaTs share conserved Asp(Glu)-Asp(Glu)-Gly and His-Pro (HP) motifs which may contain the amino acids involved in substrate binding and catalysis (10). These bacterial SiaTs are diverse, inverting glycosyltransferases (GTs) classified in either the CAZy GT42 family with a GT-A fold, or GT52 or GT80 family with a predicted GT-B or unknown fold.

Polysialyltransferases are in the GT38 and GT4 families, possibly having a GT-B fold. Bacterial SiaTs act on terminal Gal or sialic acid residues and can be monofunctional (11). Certain SiaTs can be promiscuous with respect to their acceptor substrates or have multiple activities, e.g. α2,3-, α2,6- or α2,8-SiaT activities, or significant levels of CMP-sialic acid hydrolase, trans-sialidase and neuraminidase activities (12).

All of the known eukaryotic SiaTs are members of the large GT29 family of inverting GTs, having predicted variants of the GT-A fold, that transfer sialic acid to oligosaccharides. Four or more peptide sequences have been identified as sialyl-motifs in eukaryotic SiaTs: a large L, small S, very small VS motif and motif III (13). The catalytic acid/base residues in α2,3- and α2,6-sialyltransferases have been shown to include His residues. The major human SiaT that synthesizes the sialyl-T antigen from the T antigen, Galβ1-3GalNAc-, is the α2,3-sialyltransferase ST3GalI. The activity and expression of ST3GalI is increased in cancer cells and tissues, contributing to high levels of sialyl-T antigens of cancer glycoproteins and mucins, which appears to be related to cancer cell survival and tumorigenesis (14). The crystal structure of the soluble domain of porcine ST3GalI with CMP and Galβ1-3GalNAc- suggested that His319 is the catalytic base in motif III (15), proposed to interact with carbon-2 of the sialic acid moiety of CMP-sialic acid. The enzyme was shown to assume a GT-A fold. However, the

detailed substrate specificity and metal ion dependence of purified human ST3GalI have not yet been determined.

The O104 antigen synthesis gene cluster contains genes encoding GTs, O antigen processing enzymes and those involved in nucleotide sugar biosynthesis (16):  
GalF → wckD → nnaB → nnaC → nnaA → wbwA → wzy → wbwB → wzx → wbwC → gnd.

The GTs include previously characterized β1,3-Gal-transferase WbwC, putative α2,3-sialyltransferase WbwA and putative α1,4-Gal-transferase WbwB. The nnaA, nnaB and nnaC genes are expected to be involved in the synthesis of CMP-Neu5Ac donor substrate. GalF may also be involved in nucleotide sugar synthesis while gnd encodes a putative 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The acetyltransferase responsible for the acetylation of sialic acid appears to be encoded by the wckD gene. The presence of wzx and wzy genes that encode putative translocase and polymerase, respectively, suggests that the O104 antigen synthesis follows the Wzy polymerase dependent biosynthesis pathway (4,16). In this pathway, the natural acceptor substrate upon which the O antigen is assembled in the cytoplasmic compartment is membrane-bound undecaprenol-phosphate (Figure 1). The repeating units are initiated in the cytoplasm by the addition of sugar phosphate to undecaprenol-phosphate to form sugar-diphosphate-undecaprenol. This natural acceptor substrate is then extended by GTs that transfer individual sugar residues to form the O antigen repeating unit. These units are translocated across the membrane by Wzx to the periplasm where they are polymerized by Wzy before being ligated to the outer core structure linked to lipid A. The completed LPS molecule is then transported by the Lpt complex to the outer membrane where the O antigen is exposed to the environment. While the LPS is essential for maintenance of membrane structure and bacterial growth, O antigens are targets for protective immunity by the host and are important virulence factors.

In this paper, we identified the biochemical function of the SiaT WbwA<sup>O104</sup> encoded by

the wbwA gene of the O antigen synthesis gene cluster of the highly pathogenic *E. coli* strain

O104. We showed that the enzyme is a monofunctional α2,3-SiaT that transfers sialic acid from

CMP-sialic acid to Galβ1-3GalNAcα-diphosphate-phenylundecyl (Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU) to

synthesize the sialyl-T antigen. WbwA<sup>O104</sup> has a unique acceptor specificity for a diphosphate

aglycone group, not seen in any other SiaT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials. Reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.

Radioactive nucleotide sugars were from American Radiolabelled Chemicals. GalNAc- and

GlcNAc-derivatives and inhibitors were synthesized as described (17–21). Glycopeptides and

Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Bn derivatives were synthesized and kindly donated by Hans Paulsen,

University Hamburg, Germany. The WbwA substrate Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU was synthesized

using WbwC as described (20). Briefly, bacterial lysates containing Gal-transferase WbwC were

obtained by sonication in 50 mM sucrose. Lysates were incubated with 1 mM UDP-Gal and 0.1

mM GalNAc-PP-PhU, 0.125 M MES buffer, pH 7, and 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, for 1 h. Product was

prepurified by C18 Sep-Pak and purified by HPLC using a C18 column, and quantified by HPLC

in comparison to GalNAc-PP-PhU at known concentrations.

Expression, purification and assays of ST3GalI. The ST3GalI ectodomain,

including a portion of the stem and the entire catalytic domain, was expressed as an N-terminally

8X histidine-tagged product in the baculovirus-insect cell system (22). The supernatant from

infected cells was harvested at 48 hr post infection and the secreted product was isolated by

133 nickel-affinity chromatography using HisPur™ Ni-NTA resin (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). After
134 elution with imidazole, the purified enzyme was buffer-exchanged into 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7,
135 0.125% Triton X 100 on a Sephadex G 25 column (PD 10; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.).
136 SDS-PAGE and Western blots were carried out as described (20). The ST3Gal I assays were
137 carried out in at least duplicate determinations and contained in a total volume of 40 μl: 1 μl
138 enzyme (40 ng), 20 nmol Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Bn, 0.1 M Tris, pH 7, 0.8 mM CMP-[³H] sialic acid
139 (2400 cpm/nmol), and 5 mM MnCl₂. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Water was
140 added (700 μl) and mixtures passed through a C18 Sep-Pak column. CMP-sialic acid and sialic
141 acid were eluted with 4 mL water, and product was eluted with 3 mL MeOH and quantified by
142 scintillation counting as described (23). The inhibition was tested under the standard assay
143 conditions, having inhibitor with 10% MeOH in the assay mixture, and 10% MeOH in control
144 assays. ST3Gal I product using Galβ1-3GalNAc-Bn acceptor and non-radioactive CMP-sialic
145 acid was prepared as described above but using nonradioactive CMP-sialic acid, and subjected to
146 analysis by hydrophobic and anion exchange chromatography and mass spectrometry (ESI-
147 Orbitrap Velos Pro, positive ion mode). To determine the optimal pH for the enzyme, Tris buffer
148 was used at pH range 7 to 9 and MES buffer at pH 5 to 7 with overlap of both buffers at pH 7.
149 
150 Synthesis of the wbwA gene and expression of the WbwA protein.
151 Plasmid pRSETA having an ampicillin resistance gene and containing the wbwA gene was
152 obtained from GeneArts (Life Technologies). The WbwA protein had 6 His residues at the
153 amino terminus. Plasmid was transformed into BL21 bacteria, which were grown overnight for
154 16 h on a plate containing LB agar with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. A single colony was picked and
155 grown in 5 mL LB broth with ampicillin. Bacteria from a 6 mL overnight culture were grown in

250 mL of LB containing 100 μg/mL of ampicillin at 37°C with 200 rpm shaking until the  
optical density was 0.8 at 600 nm. The expression of His-tagged protein was induced with 1 mM  
isopropylthiogalactoside for 4 h at 37°C at 200 rpm shaking, and was confirmed by SDS-PAGE  
and Western blots as described before (20). Bacterial cells were obtained by centrifugation at  
3500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/20%  
glycerol and frozen in aliquots at -20°C. WbwA was solubilized and purified by affinity  
chromatography using Ni-NTA resin (20).

Bacterial sialyltransferase assays. WbwA-containing bacteria were stored at -  
20°C in 20% glycerol in PBS, thawed and isolated by centrifugation and then disrupted in either  
50 mM sucrose or PBS by sonication for 20 s (3 times) with 2 min intervals on ice (23). WbwA  
was assayed in a total volume of 40 μl containing 10 μl homogenate (3 to 4 mg protein), 5 mM  
MnCl₂, 0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.35 to 1 mM CMP-[³H]Neu5Ac (1450 cpm/nmol), 0.1 mM  
Galβ1-3GalNAcα-PP-PhU (prepared with β1,3-Gal-transferase WbwC⁰¹⁰⁴ and GalNAc-PP-PhU  
acceptor) (20). The incubation time was 30 min at 37°C. Controls lacked the acceptor substrate.  
The mixture was applied to C18 Sep-Pak columns in water; the reaction product was eluted with  
MeOH and quantified by scintillation counting as described before (23). Assays were carried out  
in duplicate determinations with <10% difference between assays. To determine the apparent \( K_M \)  
and \( V_{max} \) values for the acceptor, 0.8 mM CMP-sialic acid was used in the assays, and for the  
donor substrate, 0.1 mM acceptor substrate was used. Kinetic parameters were determined using  
the program GraphPad Prism. The inhibition of WbwA was tested under the standard assay  
conditions, as described above for ST3GalI.

179 Production of large scale WbwA enzyme product. A large scale production
180 of WbwA product was carried out in a one-pot, two-step reaction using WbwC to synthesize
181 Galβ1-3GalNAcα-PP-PhU from GalNAcα-PP-PhU, and WbwA to synthesize sialylα2-3Galβ1-
182 3GalNAcα-PP-PhU. The reaction tube contained 7 mL of WbwC homogenate in 50 mM
183 sucrose, 7 mL of WbwA homogenate in 50 mM sucrose, 7 μmoles GalNAcα-PP-PhU, 20
184 μmoles CMP-sialic acid, 28 μmoles UDP-Gal, 0.14 μmoles MnCl₂, and 3.5 μmoles MES buffer,
185 pH 7, in a total volume of 28 mL. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, 30 mL water were added; the
186 mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 x g and supernatants subjected to 60 Sep-Pak C18 columns.
187 Hydrophilic compounds were eluted from each column with 4 mL water. Fractions (3 mL) eluted
188 with MeOH were collected and MeOH removed by rotor evaporation followed by lyophilization.
189 Three mL water were added and insoluble residue removed by filtration through 0.45 μm syringe
190 filters. Aliquots were injected into HPLC using an analytical C18 column and acetonitrile/water
191 9/91 as the mobile phase at 1 mL/min. Product fractions were pooled, and concentrated by
192 lyophilization. Radioactive WbwA reaction product was prepared in parallel, but in a 70 times
193 smaller reaction volume and using radioactive CMP-[³H]sialic acid as the donor substrate and 8
194 Sep-Pak C18 columns. Purified WbwA product was analysed for its molecular mass by
195 electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode. To determine the linkage of
196 sialic acid synthesized by WbwA, product was analyzed by NMR. Product was dissolved and
197 concentrated 3 times in D₂O and analyzed as described before by 600 MHz NMR using a Bruker
198 spectrometer (20).

199 RESULTS

200 Sequence comparisons. WbwA⁰¹⁰⁴ (Supplementary Table I) has been classified in the
201 CAZy database as an inverting glycosyltransferase within family GT52 with a yet unknown

fold. This GT 52 family contains a number of characterized SiaTs with low sequence identities

(between 12.4 to 14.6) to WbwA (3,5). All of these SiaTs have HP and E(D)-E(D)-G motifs

which are conserved in bacterial SiaTs. WbwA<sup>O104</sup> also has low (13.6%) sequence identity to

human ST3Gal1.

In Gram negative bacteria, the GTs involved in O antigen synthesis appear to be

associated with the inner membrane. Thus, hydrophobicity plots indicate that WbwA<sup>O104</sup> has

short hydrophobic regions but does not have a significant transmembrane domain. As expected,

no mammalian sialyl-motifs were detected in WbwA<sup>O104</sup> but an HP motif (His236-Pro237) is

present near the N terminus (Supplementary Figure 1). An EDG motif (Glu206-Asp207-Gly208)

typical of bacterial SiaT is located more centrally in WbwA. An additional EDG motif (Glu111-

Asp112-Gly113) is found N-terminal to this motif. The two EDG motifs may potentially include

the catalytic base.

Analyses by PHYRE2 modeling (24) generated a model based on the template c2yk5A

with 98.9% confidence. The model covered 87% of the WbwA sequence (amino acid residues 6

to 283). The PHYRE2 model predicted that the structure of WbwA forms a GT-B fold, similar

to that of Neisseria lipo-oligosaccharide-specific bifunctional α2,3/α2,6-SiaT (NST2) in

complex with CMP, in spite of low (17%) sequence identity (Lin et al 2011). The HP and EDG

motifs of WbwA are within the peptide domains of similarity.

Development of sialyltransferase assays for WbwA<sup>O104</sup>. The molecular mass

of the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged WbwA<sup>O104</sup> was calculated to be 38.02 kDa. SDS-PAGE and Western blots,

before and after affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA showed that the enzyme indeed was

expressed with an approximate molecular mass of 38 kDa (Supplementary Figure 2).

The sialic acid residue of the O104 repeating unit is tri-acetylated (8) and it was not clear

if the sialic acid in the donor substrate had to be tri-acetylated as well. Known eukaryotic and

bacterial SiaT utilize oligosaccharides as acceptor substrates and do not require a diphosphate

group in the acceptor. Thus, it seemed feasible that the acceptor substrates would be Galβ1-

3GalNAcα- derivatives that served well as substrates for human ST3GalI. WbwA<sup>O104</sup> is the third

enzyme to act in the O104 repeating unit pathway. Previously studied GTs that act as the third

enzyme acted on mono-or oligo-saccharide acceptors and did not require the diphosphate-lipid

group (25, 26). To establish an assay for SiaT activity of WbwA<sup>O104</sup>, we first used CMP-

[<sup>3</sup>H]sialic acid as the donor substrate and Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Bn acceptor. To isolate the enzyme

product after the incubation, the assay mixture was separated using C18 Sep-Pak columns. These

assay conditions were appropriate for human ST3GalI. However, no SiaT activity of WbwA was

observed with 0.5 to 1 mM Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Bn or -p-nitrophenyl, Galβ1-3(6-deoxy)

GalNAcα-Bn, glycopeptide AHGVT-(Galβ1-3GalNAcα)SAPDTRPAPGSTAPNA or other

glycopeptides as acceptors in the presence or absence of 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the assay

mixture. It was therefore possible that WbwA<sup>O104</sup> required an acceptor having the diphosphate-

lipid structure expected in the natural acceptor substrate Galβ1-3GalNAcα-PO<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>3</sub>-

undecaprenol. To produce the natural WbwA acceptor analog Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU, we used

Gal-transferase WbwC<sup>O104</sup>, with UDP-Gal donor and GalNAc-PP-PhU acceptor (20), followed

by extensive purification. In contrast to all other Galβ1-3GalNAc- derivatives tested, Galβ1-

3GalNAc-PP-PhU at 0.1 mM concentration in the assay was very active as an acceptor for SiaT

WbwA. The WbwC substrate GalNAc-PP-PhU and its analog GlcNAc-PP-PhU did not serve as

substrates for WbwA at 0.1 to 1 mM concentrations, showing that the addition of sialic acid was

dependent on the presence of the Gal residue in Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU.

Characterization of WbwA<sup>O104</sup> activity. The SiaT activity in the bacterial lysate was linear up to 1 h incubation time and the activity was stable for several days at 4°C and for several weeks at -20°C. The apparent \( K_M \) value for the acceptor substrate Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU was 0.02 mM with an apparent \( V_{max} \) of 50 nmol/h/mg (Supplementary Figure 3A) for the activity in bacterial lysates. After passing the lysate through the Ni-NTA affinity column, SDS-PAGE showed a major band at about 38 kDa, and a single band was observed by Western blots (data not shown). Although the enzyme did not appear to be degraded after the purification procedure, it lost activity, and only 10% of the enzyme appeared to be soluble and adhering to the Ni-NTA column. It is possible that the enzyme in the lysate aggregated and precipitated or the protein structure was unstable and lacked components of the membrane necessary for its activity. Since the purified enzyme showed relatively low activity, and only a small amount of purified, soluble enzyme was isolated, we used the bacterial homogenate as the enzyme source for WbwA characterization. The apparent \( K_M \) value for CMP-sialic acid was 0.013 mM with an apparent \( V_{max} \) of 90 nmol/h/mg (Supplementary Figure 3B). UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-Fuc and GDP-Man could not substitute for CMP-sialic acid and were ineffective in transferring a sugar residue to Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU. This indicates that WbwA has a strict specificity for its donor substrate CMP-sialic acid.

To determine the requirement of WbwA for divalent metal ions, assays were carried out without metal ion addition, with 5 mM EDTA or with the addition of various metal ions at 5 mM concentration. Clearly, the activity was not metal ion-dependent but the activities varied, with MnCl<sub>2</sub> giving the highest activity with 169% of product yield and Cobalt acetate giving the lowest activity (77%) compared to assays without metal ion addition (Supplementary Figure 4).

It is therefore possible that the presence of metal ions affected protein structure and activity, or, alternatively, that metal ions differentially affected the structure of the negatively charged donor and/or acceptor substrates. We therefore added MnCl₂ in subsequent assays. The optimal pH of the buffer used in assays was 7 (Supplementary Figure 5). CMP-sialic acid hydrolase activity of WbwA was determined at pH 5 and 7 with CMP-[³H]sialic acid. CMP-[³H]sialic acid was separated from [³H]sialic acid by ascending paper chromatography in Leloir solvent (1M NH₄-acetate, pH 7.5 : 95% EtOH = 3:7). The amount of sialic acid released from CMP-[³H]sialic acid was at similar levels in controls and in assays containing WbwA, showing that WbwA is not an active CMP-sialic acid hydrolase. Neuraminidase activity of WbwA was tested in assays using radioactive WbwA and ST3Gal I products, [³H]sialylα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU and [³H]sialylα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Bn, respectively, as potential neuraminidase substrates at pH 5 and pH 7. The released [³H]sialic acid and uncleaved radioactive SiaT products were separated by C18 Sep-Pak columns. No significant release of [³H]sialic acid above background (lacking WbwA) was observed.

Bis-imidazolium chloride or mesylate salts (21) have two positively charged imidazolium groups linked by an aliphatic chain. For both enzymes, WbwA⁰¹⁰⁴ and hST3Gal I, very little or no inhibition was seen with chloride salts having an aliphatic linker chain of 4 to 14 carbons, at five times the acceptor concentration. However, compounds with at least 15 carbons in the linker chains inhibited WbwA and with at least 16 carbons inhibited ST3Gal I. The inhibitory activity of compounds increased with the number of carbons in the aliphatic linker chains and was highest with compounds having 20 or 22 carbons (Supplementary Table II). The mesylate salt having 22 carbons in the aliphatic linker chain had an IC₅₀ value of 0.2 mM for WbwA and 0.04 mM for ST3Gal I.

Analysis of WbwA<sup>O104</sup> reaction product. To produce several μmoles of

WbwA<sup>O104</sup> reaction product for structural analyses, WbwC product Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU

was used as an acceptor and CMP-sialic acid as a donor substrate. We observed that in a coupled

one-pot synthesis of WbwC and WbwA products, using both enzymes simultaneously with the

initial acceptor GalNAc-PP-PhU, UDP-Gal and radioactive CMP-[<sup>3</sup>H]sialic acid, about 4-times

more WbwA product was obtained, compared to the standard WbwA reaction. This highly

efficient synthesis was a strong indication that the combination of the two enzymes had a

stimulating effect on the conversion of GalNAc-PP-PhU to the first reaction product, Galβ1-

3GalNAc-PP-PhU, and subsequently to the second reaction product, [<sup>3</sup>H]sialyl-Galβ1-3GalNAc-

PP-PhU.

In the non-radioactive large scale production, a total of 3.6 μmoles of WbwA reaction

product was obtained in 1 h from 7 μmoles of GalNAc-PP-PhU (51% conversion of initial

acceptor to WbwA product). The WbwA product was isolated by C18 Sep-Pak followed by

HPLC. With acetonitrile/water (9/91) as the mobile phase, the sialylated product eluted in a

broad peak at 45 min. Electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS, negative ion mode) of the

reaction product sialyl-Gal-GalNAc-PP-PhU showed m/z of 1079.4 for [M-H]<sup>-</sup> and 1101.4 for

[M-H+Na]<sup>-</sup>, indicating that WbwA had added one residue of sialic acid to Gal-GalNAc-PP-PhU

(Figure 2).

NMR analysis of the WbwA<sup>O104</sup> reaction product. To determine the anomeric

linkage of the newly added sialic acid residue, the WbwA<sup>O104</sup> reaction product was dissolved in

D<sub>2</sub>O and subjected to 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral analyses (Table I,

Figure 3A-C, Supplementary Figure 6A,B). The proton and carbon shifts were obtained from

correlation spectroscopy (COSY), total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) and heteronuclear

single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC). Although the spectra indicated the presence of

a single compound, not all parameters could be assigned due to crowding and overlapping

signals. In nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY) and rotating frame Overhauser effect (ROESY)

spectra, cross peaks were found between the axial H-3 of sialic acid and the equatorial H-3, and

between the axial H-3 of sialic acid and the axial H-3 of Gal (Figure 3B,C). In addition, the

product spectrum, in comparison to that of the substrate (20), showed that the chemical shift of

Gal H-3 had changed most significantly, compared to the other Gal signals, from 3.55 ppm to

3.98 ppm. The ${}^{13}$C chemical shift of Gal C-3 also showed a large change from 72.1 ppm in the

substrate to 75.4 ppm in the product. These results strongly suggest that the WbwA${}^{O104}$ reaction

product is sialylα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα-PP-PhU and that WbwA is an α2,3-SiaT acting on the

Gal residue of Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU.

Role of the conserved HP and EDG motifs in WbwA${}^{O104}$: mutational

analyses. Six mutants of highly conserved residues with a focus on the HP and the two EDG

motifs were prepared and compared to the wild type WbwA${}^{O104}$ enzyme. All of the mutants and

wild type enzyme were well expressed and showed one band on Western blots using anti-His-tag

antibody (Supplementary Figure 2). The P237A and the H236A mutants were found to be

inactive, suggesting that His and Pro of the HP motif may be critical residues as is the case for

NST SiaT (27). In WbwA${}^{O104}$, there are two conserved D(E)-D(E)-G motifs (Supplementary

Figure 1). Point mutations of the acidic residues showed drastic decreases in activity, with

E111A and E112A having undetectable activity, and E206A and D207A having <12% activity

(Figure 4). This suggests that both EDG motifs in WbwA<sup>O104</sup> have an important function, either

in SiaT activity or in the proper folding of the protein.

Properties of human ST3Gal I. Human ST3Gal I has a similar activity to WbwA

in synthesizing the sialyl-T antigen with a low amino acid sequence identity. However, the

catalytic sites of these enzymes may have similar properties. Human ST3Gal I has not been

carefully characterized before. To compare the properties of the human enzyme to those of

WbwA, human ST3Gal I was expressed and purified. Purified His-tagged ST3Gal I showed a

single band at 37 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The activity of ST3Gal I was stable for several days at 4°C

and for several weeks at -20°C. No metal ions were required for activity and the enzyme was

fully active in the presence of EDTA. The buffer pH optimum for ST3Gal I activity was between

6 and 6.5.

An evaluation of the acceptor substrate specificity of ST3Gal I showed that the

enzyme is specific for the Galβ1-3GalNAc-structure of O-glycan core 1 (Galβ1-3GalNAc-) and

core 2 (GlcNAcβ1-6[Galβ1-3]GalNAc-). The exception was Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-PhU, the

acceptor substrate for WbwA, which has the core 1 structure but was not a substrate for ST3Gal I

(Table II), probably due to the negative charge of the diphosphate group. All other compounds

having different aglycone groups, including benzyl, p-nitrophenyl, allyl, or peptides were

ST3Gal I acceptors to varying degrees. Using glycopeptide acceptors, Galβ1-3GalNAc in both

α- and β-linkages to Thr and in α-linkage to Ser were similarly active, indicating that the

anomeric configuration of the GalNAc-residues or the O-glycosylated amino acid was not

important for ST3Gal I activity. However, glycopeptides having the core 1 structure linked to Ser

or Thr were generally not as effective as Galβ1-3GalNAc-Bn, suggesting that ST3Gal I preferred

the hydrophobic character of the aglycone group in the acceptor. The apparent \( K_M \) value for the

standard acceptor Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Bn was 0.05 mM with an apparent \( V_{max} \) value of 0.9

μmol/min/mg while the glycopeptide AHGVT-(Galβ3GalNAcα)SAPDTRPAPGSTAPTA had a

higher apparent \( K_M \) value of 0.2 mM with an apparent \( V_{max} \) value of 3 μmol/min/mg. For the

acceptor Galβ1-3(4-deoxy-)GalNAcα-Bn, the apparent \( K_M \) value was 0.09 mM, with an apparent

\( V_{max} \) value of 1 μmol/min/mg, whereas the acceptor Galβ1-3(6-deoxy-)GalNAcα-Bn had an

apparent \( K_M \) value of 0.07 mM and an apparent \( V_{max} \) value of 0.97 μmol/min/mg which was

similar to the values obtained for the standard acceptor Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Bn. Replacement of

the Gal moiety of the acceptor with GlcNAc or GalNAc, or changing the Gal linkage to β1-6

drastically reduced activity. However, Galβ1-6GalNAcα-Bn served as an acceptor substrate for

porcine ST3GalI. This is probably due to the fact that the human and porcine enzymes are

different proteins, having about 15% identity difference in their amino acid sequences, and

possibly having different properties of their acceptor binding sites. The 4-hydroxyl of the

GalNAc residue was also important since Galβ1-3GlcNAcα-Bn and Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ-Bn had

undetectable activity. Since Galβ1-3(6-deoxy-)GalNAcα-Bn and core 2-containing

glycopeptides were good substrates, the 6-hydroxyl of GalNAc was apparently not recognized by

the enzyme and could even be substituted with a large GlcNAc residue. These studies show

significant differences between the acceptor specificities of WbwA and ST3GalI.

DISCUSSION

This paper reports the first biochemical study of WbwA<sup>O104</sup>, a SiaT encoded by the O

antigen synthesis gene cluster of the pathogenic E. coli serotype O104. This work contributes to

the detailed understanding of the biosynthesis of an important virulence factor in an intestinal

pathogen. We have clearly shown that the WbwA enzyme transfers one sialic acid residue from

CMP-sialic acid to the terminal Gal residue of Galβ1-3GalNAcα-PP-PhU forming a sialylα2-3

linkage. The sialylα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα- structure of the reaction product is identical to the

human sialyl-T antigen and is consistent with the structure of the O104 antigen (8). The

diphosphate group can easily be removed with pyrophosphatases and phosphatases, thus creating

a reducing end of the sialyl-T antigen with a potential for further derivatization. For example,

tumour-selective epitopes could be created with the sialyl-T antigen linked to specific mucin

peptide which could increase its immunogenicity (28). Therefore, recombinant WbwA<sup>O104</sup> could

be used to synthesize stereo- and linkage-specific bacterial structures as well as the human sialyl-

T antigen for functional studies or development of a tumour-selective vaccine targeting the

sialyl-T epitope. Given the abundance of sialyl-T on cancer glycoproteins, the benefit of

immunogenicity toward sialyl-T might outweigh potential cross reactions towards normal

glycoproteins.

In the repeating unit synthesized on PP-Und the GalNAc residue at the non-reducing end

is present in an α-linkage (8). However, in the polymerized O antigen GalNAc is found in

β linkage. It is likely that polymerase Wzy links GalNAc of the oligosaccharide to the Galα

residue at the non-reducing end of another unit with inversion of configuration. This suggests

that Wzy from E.coli O104 is an inverting oligosaccharyltransferase.

WbwC<sup>O104</sup> is the second enzyme in the pathway of O104 antigen synthesis and requires

the diphosphate in the acceptor (GalNAc-PP-PhU). Thus far, the second enzymes in the

repeating unit assembly sequence have all been shown to have an absolute requirement for at

least one phosphate group in the acceptor (20, 23, 29-32). WbwA<sup>O104</sup> is the first example of the

408 third enzyme in the pathway, and of a eukaryotic or bacterial SiaT that has a requirement for
409 diphosphate in the acceptor. Future mutational and structural studies may identify the amino
410 acids responsible for the unique acceptor specificity of WbwA.
411 Similar to the sialic acid residue in the O antigen of E. coli serotype O171, the sialic acid
412 moiety of the O104 antigen is 7- and 9-O-acetylated. The gene responsible for O-acetylation in
413 E.coli O104 is likely to be wckD, which is found in the O104 antigen synthesis gene cluster (16)
414 and encodes a putative sialate O-acetyltransferase. O-acetyltransferases, including WckD<sup>O104</sup>, are
415 thought to transfer O-acetyl groups from acetyl-Coenzyme A to CMP-sialic acid. Acetylated
416 CMP-sialic acid would then be the donor substrate for WbwA to create a 7-, 9-di-O-acetyl-sialic
417 acid-containing oligosaccharide. Since CMP-sialic acid served as a donor substrate for WbwA,
418 the enzyme may have a relaxed specificity toward the structure of sialic acid in the donor
419 substrate and utilizes both, CMP-sialic acid and CMP-7-, 9-di-O-acetyl-sialic acid. Our
420 preliminary data showed that the next GT in the pathway, α4-Gal-transferase WbwB, acts on
421 sialyl-oligosaccharides. Thus, WbwB may also have a relaxed specificity towards sialyl- and
422 acetylated sialyl-oligosaccharides. However, the detailed substrate specificities of these enzymes
423 and biosynthetic pathways remain to be examined.
424 In SiaTs, His residues appear to complex the nucleotide sugar phosphate groups instead
425 of divalent metal ions that are used by many other GTs having a DXD motif (33). Indeed,
426 WbwA<sup>O104</sup> has a critically important His 236 residue within the HP sequence that is conserved in
427 bacterial SiaTs (10). The His 236 residue could be a general acid (27) or could be involved in
428 binding the donor substrate CMP-sialic acid. The Pro 237 residue, due to its unique properties in
429 affecting protein structure, may serve to ensure the function of the His 236 residue. Glu 111,
430 Glu 112 and Asp 206 residues in two of the conserved EDG motifs could possibly play a role in

431 substrate binding and catalysis or by ensuring the proper protein conformation. Future protein
432 structure and modeling studies could confirm the roles of acidic residues in WbwA<sup>O104</sup>.
433 In spite of the similarities, the analysis of amino acid sequences suggests that human
434 ST3GalI and WbwA<sup>O104</sup> do not have a common evolutionary origin. The overall protein
435 structure, the biochemical roles of critically important His, Asp, Glu and other residues that are
436 responsible for the unique acceptor specificity to WbwA remain to be determined. This may
437 confirm the hypothesis that bacterial enzymes and their mammalian counterparts can have
438 similar but characteristic geometry and functions of amino acids in the substrate binding and
439 catalytic sites in spite of different overall sequences and folds.
440 ST3Gall has an α2,3-SiaT activity that is similar to that of WbwA, and both enzymes
441 synthesize the common sialyl-T antigen, are mono-functional and do not require divalent metal
442 ions for activity. Both enzymes are inverting GTs (albeit of different GT families and having
443 different overall folds), bind to CMP-sialic acid donor substrate and Galβ1-3GalNAc-acceptor
444 substrates (17, 34) and are effectively inhibited by bis-imidazolium salts having at least 16
445 carbons in the aliphatic linker chain between positively charged groups. The mechanism by
446 which these inhibitors selectively block GT activities is currently under investigation and may
447 involve binding to anionic and hydrophobic pockets of the enzyme proteins. This knowledge
448 may be used in the development of antibacterial strategies.

FIGURE 1. Proposed O antigen repeating unit synthesis pathway of E. coli serotype O104 involving sialyltransferase WbwA. In the proposed O104 antigen pathway, WecA may transfer GalNAc-phosphate from UDP-GalNAc to undecaprenol-phosphate (P-Und). Alternatively, GlcNAc-phosphate is transferred and 4-epimerase forms GalNAca-PP-Und, the substrate for WbwC. WbwC then adds a Gal residue in β1-3 linkage to GalNAc-PP-Und. WbwA transfers sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to the Gal residue of Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-Und. Further conversion is catalysed by yet uncharacterized α4-Gal-transferase WbwB and putative sialate O-acetyl-transferase WckD to synthesize the O104 antigen repeating unit D-Gala1-4Neu5,7,9Ac3a2-3-D-Galβ1-3-D-GalNAc-. Flippase Wzx transfers the oligosaccharide to the periplasm where it is polymerized by polymerase Wzy to form the O antigen. Chain length terminator Wzz may help to restrict the number of repeating units assembled by polymerase. The O antigen is then ligated to the outer core structure of the growing lipopolysaccharide by ligase WaaL. The Lpt complex extrudes LPS to the outer membrane.

FIGURE 2. Mass spectrum for WbwA reaction product, sialyl-Galβ1-3GalNAca-PP-PhU. The purified WbwA<sup>O104</sup> reaction product was analysed by ESI-MS in the negative ion mode. The ion m/z 1079.4 indicates the presence of enzyme product sialyl-Gal-GalNAc-PP-PhU [M-H]<sup>-</sup>. The mono-sodium salt is seen as m/z 1101.4 [M-H+Na]<sup>-</sup>.

FIGURE 3A. 600 MHz COSY NMR spectrum of WbwA<sup>O104</sup> product Sialylα2-3Galβ1-  
3GalNAcα-PO<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>3</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>-O-Phenyl. WbwA product (structure shown) was isolated by  
HPLC as described in the Methods section, dissolved in D<sub>2</sub>O and analysed by 1D and 2D  
experiments. The axial H-3 of sialic acid appears to be close in space to the axial H-3 of Gal. SA,  
sialic acid.

FIGURE 3B. 600 MHz NOESY NMR spectrum of WbwA<sup>O104</sup> product Sialylα2-3Galβ1-  
3GalNAcα-PO<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>3</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>-O-Phenyl. The axial H-3 of sialic acid shows NOEs to the  
equatorial H-3 of sialic acid and to the H-3 of Gal.

FIGURE 3C. 600 MHz ROESY NMR spectrum of WbwA<sup>O104</sup> product Sialylα2-3Galβ1-  
3GalNAcα-PO<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>3</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>-O-Phenyl. As in the NOESY spectrum, the axial H-3 of sialic acid  
shows NOEs to the equatorial H-3 of sialic acid and to the H-3 of Gal.

FIGURE 4. Relative activities of site-specific WbwA mutants of the HP and EDG motifs.  
Mutants of WbwA<sup>O104</sup> were produced by replacing the His and Pro residues of the HP motif and  
Asp and Glu residues of the EDG motifs with Ala, as described in the Methods section. All  
mutants were then assayed as described in the Methods section in duplicate determinations. The  
error bars indicate the variation between duplicates. Western Blots confirmed that all mutants  
were expressed (data not shown). Mutants E206A and D207A had residual activities but H236A  
and P237A from the HP motif, as well as E111A and D112A mutants from the first EDG motif  
were inactive. Relative activities are shown.
