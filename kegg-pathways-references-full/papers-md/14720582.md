Recently, the term oncomodulation has been proposed to express the ability of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to modify tumor cell biology, a phenomenon that is independent from transformation. Because past studies have failed to show that HCMV can transform normal human cells, HCMV has not been regarded as an oncogenic tumor virus. However, recent investigations have revealed a high frequency of HCMV in tumor cells of malignancies such as colon cancer, malignant glioma, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and carcinoma. Data from experiments with HCMV-infected tumor cell lines have highlighted the oncomodulatory potential of HCMV and provided important insights into the patho-mechanisms associated with aberrant signaling pathways and/or transcription factor and/or tumor suppressor function of the host cell.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that leads to lifelong persistent infection. The frequency of infection ranges from 50% to 90% in the general adult population, and varies with socio-economic level and, to some extent, geographic location. HCMV causes severe and often fatal disease in immunocompromised individuals, including recipients of organ transplants and individuals with acquired immune deficiency virus. HCMV is among the viruses known to cause birth defects, and has also been associated with long-term diseases, such as atherosclerosis, malignancies, and chronic rejection following solid-organ transplantation. In the past 30 years, numerous reports on the detection of viral DNA, mRNA and/or antigens in tumor tissues, as well as sero-epidemiological evidence, have implicated HCMV in the etiology of several malignancies, including colon carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, cervical carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, and pediatric malignancies such as Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma (for review, see Ref. [1]). Despite these findings, the definitive establishment of a causative role for HCMV in the development of malignancies has remained elusive for several reasons. First, HCMV components were not detected following long-term subculture of tumor tissues. Second, inoculation of permissive normal human cells in culture with HCMV did not induce their transformation. Third, the presence of HCMV genetic information in human tumors growing in different organs was difficult to interpret because HCMV can infect these organs in a high number of healthy individuals. Fourth, sero-epidemiological studies linking HCMV infection with malignancies yielded conflicting results. Although HCMV might perturb the cell control mechanisms of various non-tumor cells, we postulate that tumor cells provide an appropriate genetic environment (with disturbed function of signaling pathways, transcription factors and tumor suppressor proteins) to facilitate the oncogenic potential of HCMV that cannot be manifested in normal cells [1]. This role of HCMV was defined as oncomodulation; that is, the ability of the virus to catalyze the oncogenic process. Our model suggests that persistent productive infection of tumor cells is essential for oncomodulation by HCMV [2,3].

To better understand the intricate relationship between HCMV and tumor cells and/or malignancies, the following sections summarize recent work on the molecular effects of HCMV that lead to oncomodulation.

Novel investigations reveal a high frequency of the HCMV genome and antigens in tumor tissues. Recent investigations have revealed a higher frequency of HCMV in tumor tissues of malignancies such as colon cancer [4], malignant glioma [5], Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Hodgkin’s disease [6], prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic carcinoma [7], than previously reported. In malignant glioma, 27 out of 27 biopsy specimens expressed HCMV DNA and proteins, including immediate-early 1 (IE1)-72 protein (UL123), p52/76 kDa delayed-early protein, and pp65 tegument protein [5]. Similarly, 22 out of 22 biopsy specimens from neoplastic prostate lesions, as well as 11 out of 12 colon adenocarcinomas, expressed UL123 and pp65 HCMV proteins [4,7]. HCMV DNA and proteins were found in the tumor cells of solid malignancies but not in normal adjacent tissue [4,5,7]. In EBV-negative Hodgkin’s disease, 11 out of 33 biopsy specimens expressed HCMV DNA and proteins in the neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells [6]. These pathological findings could be important for understanding the role of HCMV in tumor cell biology (oncomodulation). Moreover,

recent laboratory investigations implicate how HCMV infection might interfere with several key cellular pathways, leading to enhanced survival, angiogenesis, cell motility and adhesion.

Molecular mechanisms of oncomodulation by HCMV

Modulation of apoptosis
Recently, a HCMV cell-death suppressor (vICA) encoded by the viral UL36 gene has been identified. vICA binds to the prodomain of caspase-8 thus inhibiting Fas-mediated apoptosis [8]. Moreover, the IE anti-apoptotic UL37×1 gene product, viral mitochondrion-localized inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA), is currently a focus of intensive research [9]. These UL36- and UL37-mediated anti-apoptotic mechanisms might avoid immune clearance by cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells.
HCMV infection has been shown to protect tumor cells from apoptosis by the induction of cellular proteins, including Bcl-2, ΔNp73α and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT. Two independent laboratories reported increased Bcl-2 expression in cultures of neuroblastoma [2] and colon carcinoma [4] cell lines infected with different HCMV strains. Other observations showed that HCMV infection induced robust accumulation of the ΔNp73α isoform through virus-induced protein stabilization [10]. HCMV-induced ΔNp73α exerts a dominant-negative effect on both p73α- and p53-dependent apoptosis, as observed in both p53-negative glioblastoma cells and neuroblastoma cells expressing functional p53 [10]. Notably, both Bcl-2 and ΔNp73α overexpressing HCMV-infected tumor cells were resistant to chemotherapeutic agents when compared with parental (non-infected) cells [2,10]. In addition, it has been shown that induction of serine-threonine kinase AKT via PI3K in HCMV-infected cells might account for inhibition of apoptosis [11]. In glioblastoma cells, HCMV infection prevented TNF-α signaling by a virus-induced reduction of TNF receptor I (TNFRI) from the cell surface, which might also play an important role in the prevention of apoptosis [12].

Modulation of cell migration
Increased tumor cell motility, adhesion to the endothelium, and trans-endothelial migration are important features of metastases. HCMV infection has been linked to a significant increase of smooth muscle cell migration [13]. Moreover, migration of neuronal cells has been observed in developing mouse brain following infection with murine CMV [14]. In our model, neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with HCMV and co-cultured with monolayers of human endothelial cells expressed increased motility and adhesion of tumor cells to endothelium [15]. The adhesion of infected tumor cells to endothelium was mediated by β1α5 integrin and resulted in focal disruption of endothelial monolayer integrity, thus facilitating tumor cell transmigration [15]. In the presence of protease inhibitors, β1α5-mediated adhesion was not impaired, whereas tumor-cell-mediated endothelial monolayer permeability was inhibited. It is conceivable that the effects of HCMV infection on expression of integrins and proteases might be

owing to the effects of numerous cytokines that are produced from infected cells [16]. We conclude that HCMV infection contributes to augmented tumor invasiveness via increased motility, adhesion of cancer cells to endothelium, and digestion of extracellular matrix by proteases.

Modulation of angiogenesis
One of the most important features of malignant tumors is their ability to induce rapidly the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) by several mechanisms. In 1991, induction of an endothelial cell growth factor (basic fibroblast growth factor) by HCMV-infected fibroblasts was reported [17]. In the following years, the production of numerous positive regulators of angiogenesis from both normal and tumor cells was reported by several laboratories [1]. Findings from our laboratory demonstrated that HCMV infection results in vigorous downregulation of negative regulators of angiogenesis, such as thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and TSP-2 in glioma cells [18,19]. The effects of HCMV on TSP-1 in tumor cells did not depend on p53 status [18].
The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which is associated with HCMV infection, could be important for angiogenesis in HCMV-infected gliomas. TNF-α expression was found to be induced in cultures of HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells [12]. Moreover, treatment of glioblastoma cells with TNF-α stimulates the production of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-8, both recognized as major factors in sustaining the angiogenic phenotype of gliomas [20]. By contrast, HCMV prevents TNF-α signaling in the host cell by impairing TNFRI surface-membrane expression. Therefore, TNF-α secreted by HCMV-infected glioma cells might induce the production of angiogenic factors primarily in neighboring non-infected cells rather than in the infected host cell. HCMV was found to have a direct effect on IL-8 in infected glioma and other cell types by showing that viral IE proteins might transactivate IL-8 gene expression [16,21].
Another possible indirect contribution of HCMV infection to tumor angiogenesis is the ability of HCMV to induce CD40 on the surface of infected cells [22]. This mechanism could contribute to angiogenesis because ligation of CD40 with CD40L (e.g. expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) results in VEGF production. Overall, HCMV could induce an angiogenic switch during tumorigenesis owing to its ability to disturb the balance between activators and inhibitors of angiogenesis.

Modulation of signaling pathways and transcription factor activity
Several mechanisms could be involved in the regulation of cellular genes relevant for modulation of malignant properties in HCMV-infected tumors. HCMV UL123 and UL122 could play an important role owing to their ability to transactivate cellular genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and angiogenic regulators [16]. UL123 and UL122 HCMV proteins can individually activate the PI3K pathway and inhibit apoptosis [11]. By contrast, HCMV has the ability to influence distinct

Figure 1. Selected signaling pathways and transcription factors activated by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2. (a) After ligand binding, EGFR undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation, and initiates distinct signaling pathways by recruiting Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing effector proteins. The activated EGFR dimer complexes (either directly or indirectly through Shc) with the adaptor protein Grb2, coupled to the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor SOS. Subsequent Ras activation leads to activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via upstream kinases Raf, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK)-1/2, and to activation of the c-Jun NH₂-terminal kinase (JNK) via the upstream MEK/ERK kinase 1 (MEKK1) and MEKK4/7 signaling pathways. Phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) represent other SH2-containing effector proteins that can be recruited to activated EGFR, resulting in activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway via formation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP₂)/diacylglycerol (DAG), and activation of the protein kinase B (PKB) pathway, respectively. The distinct signaling pathways activate transcription factors such as c-Jun, Elk-1, SP-1 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). The inhibitor of NF-κB (I-κB) is linked to NF-κB heterodimers (e.g. p50 and p65; purple circles). (b) HCMV binding to TLR2 activates several signal transduction pathways that can be enhanced by CD14. Upon activation, the cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain of TLR recruits the adaptor MyD88. The death domain of MyD88 then recruits the downstream IL-1-receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), which becomes autophosphorylated and recruits the TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which, in turn, activates downstream kinases, for example by forming complexes with the adaptor protein evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways (ECSIT). Several kinases have been found to be involved in TLR/NF-κB signaling pathways, including NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and MEKK1. TRAF6 activates NIK through TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which binds to TRAF6 through the binding proteins TAB1 and TAB2. TAK1 and TAB1 are capable of activating the MEKKs MEKK3/6 and MEKK4/7, which, in turn, activate p38 and JNK. This results in activation of the transcription factors Elk-1, SP-1 and c-Jun.

molecular pathways, leading to activation of cellular transcription factors without the requirement for viral gene expression. HCMV initiates infection and intracellular signaling by binding to its cellular cognate receptor and by activating several signaling pathways, including those mediated by PI3K [23], mitogen-activated protein kinases [24–26], and G proteins [27]. The cellular signaling pathways activate multiple transcription factors, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), activator protein 1, SP-1 and Elk-1, which bind to promoters of cellular genes. Recent findings indicated that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a necessary component for HCMV-triggered signaling and viral entry [28]. Interaction of HCMV with Toll-like receptor (TLR) and CD14 was shown to activate cytokine responses through NF-κB [29]. Given that EGFR and TLR2 are expressed on tumor cells, these mechanisms could contribute to the modulation of gene expression in malignancies (Figure 1).

Concluding remarks
The most important question raised by many investigators is an old one: is there any role for HCMV in tumor cell biology or is the virus only a passenger in tumor cells? Of course, it is possible that viral genes expressed during abortive infection (e.g. when infection is limited to expression of transactivating viral immediate-early genes) might influence tumor cell growth. However, recent pathological examinations of tumor samples provide increasing evidence for persistent productive HCMV tumor cell infection [4–7]. Therefore, the availability of tumor cell lines persistently and productively infected with HCMV might help to study such problems [1]. We observed increased expression of Bcl-2 protein in persistently infected neuroblastoma cells, which are significantly less sensitive to the cytotoxic agents cisplatin and etoposide, compared with parental (non-infected) cells [2].

Figure 2. Tumor progression induced by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. HCMV infection is sustained in tumors because persistent productive infection is based on the balance between HCMV-infected and non-infected tumor cells (i.e. between virus replication and proliferation of non-infected cells). Growth of non-infected tumors is slow, with a relatively high rate of apoptosis and limited angiogenesis. The non-infected tumor is destroyed by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. HCMV infection results in tumor progression by induction of angiogenesis, and decreased sensitivity of the tumor cell to apoptotic stimuli. Thus, HCMV infection promotes the dissemination of tumor cells, and chemotherapy fails to induce tumor cell death. Treatment with antiviral agents such as ganciclovir suppresses HCMV proliferation, which restores the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli and the inhibition of angiogenesis and invasive behavior of tumor cells.

neuroblastoma cells with the antiviral agent, ganciclovir, restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy, lowered Bcl-2 expression, and facilitated sensitivity of apoptosis to the level of parental cells [2]. By contrast, it is possible that HCMV infection provides selective pressure for tumor cell populations with increased malignant potential. Apart from the mechanism involved, virus suppression by antiviral agents would prevent such virus-induced changes from promoting malignancy (Figure 2). Based on the novel pathological and experimental findings outlined here, we conclude that: (i) HCMV mediates oncomodulation that might result in a more malignant phenotype; and (ii) future research needs to define oncomodulatory mechanisms for distinct tumor entities and clinical settings. From a therapeutic point of view, it is feasible to show whether patients with HCMV-positive tumors experience a benefit from a combination of antiviral and anti-tumor therapy.
