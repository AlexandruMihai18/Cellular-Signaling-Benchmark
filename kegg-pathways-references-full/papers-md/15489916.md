# Function of the Src-family kinases, Lck and Fyn, in T-cell development and activation

The function of the Src-family kinases (SFKs) Lck and Fyn in T cells has been intensively studied over the past 15 years. Animal models and cell line studies both indicate a critical role for Lck and Fyn in proximal T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signal transduction. Recruited SFKs phosphorylate TCR ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) in the CD3 and ζ chains, which then serve as docking sites for Syk-family kinases. SFKs then phosphorylate and activate the recruited Syk-family kinase. Lck and Fyn are spatially segregated in cell membranes due to differential lipid raft localization, and may undergo sequential activation. In addition to the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors, a recently described adaptor, Unc119, may link SFKs to the TCR. CD45 and Csk provide positive and negative regulatory control of SFK functions, respectively, and Csk is constitutively bound to the transmembrane adapter protein, PAG/Cbp. TCR-based signaling is required at several stages of T-cell development, including at least pre-TCR signaling, positive selection, peripheral maintenance of naive T cells, and lymphopenia-induced proliferation. SFKs are required for each of these TCR-based signals, and Lck seems to be the major contributor.

function within immune cells under different physiologic circumstances (i.e. development or disease). Our current understanding of the function of Lck and Fyn, the Src-family kinases (SFKs) expressed in T cells, exemplifies this trend.

In T cells, the function of SFKs is largely described at a biochemical level. Recent work correlates these biochemical characteristics with cellular functions relevant to the organism. This review presents a summary of SFK regulation and function in T-cell development, homeostasis, and activation. First, we present an overview of the distribution of SFK within the hematopoietic system, including T cells. Then, we discuss the biochemical properties of Lck and Fyn and how they are activated in the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway. Finally, we explore the functions of Lck and Fyn during thymocyte developmental and in peripheral T cells.

## SFK hematopoietic distribution

The hematopoietic system has evolved to contain several SFK members to perform functions that are highly specialized to serve the various lineages. Among those uniquely expressed at high levels in the various hematopoietic lineages are Lck, Lyn, Blk, Fgr, and Hck (Thomas and Brugge, 1997). Myeloid lineage cells primarily express Hck, Fgr, and Lyn. B cells primarily express Lyn, Fyn, and Blk. Src, Yes, and Fyn are usually described as ‘ubiquitously’ expressed. Like other hematopoietic cells, T cells have their specific complement of SFKs. T cells primarily express Lck and Fyn-T (a hematopoietic cell-specific isoform which contains an alternatively spliced form of exon 7 that encodes a part of the kinase domain (Cooke and Perlmutter, 1989)). Lck and Fyn are expressed through most of the lifespan of a T cell and the predominant mechanisms of action and function of these kinases in T-cell activation are well understood. Lck protein is expressed at a fairly constant level throughout development. Fyn protein is transiently decreased at the double positive (DP; CD4+/CD8+) stage of thymocyte development (see below), but increases thereafter in more mature cells (Olszowy *et al.*, 1995). The expression of Src and Yes and most other SFKs has not been rigorously characterized in all

Introduction

Progress towards understanding the basic mechanisms of the mammalian immune system has rapidly advanced over the past 20 years. Whereas many immunologists focused on understanding which cell populations perform specific functions, others focused on elucidating the molecular aspects of cellular activation. Current immunological research is often expected to do both, explain a physiological phenomenon in the context of a proposed biochemical mechanism. As the technologies for studying cellular and molecular immunology continue to improve, so do the models of how molecules

stages of T-cell development using contemporary sensitive serologic reagents. The expression of Src and Yes is thought to be low in T cells, although a function for these SFKs within the T-cell lineage might be subtle or masked by redundancy.

### Lck and Fyn domain structure and function

Lck and Fyn are 56 and 59 kDa proteins, respectively, with a domain organization similar to other SFK members. Both molecules have the following domains in common: N-terminal attachment sites for saturated fatty acid addition, a unique region, a Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, an SH2 domain, a tyrosine kinase domain (SH1), and a C-terminal negative regulatory domain.
- The N-terminal attachment sites allow covalent addition of the saturated fatty acid chains from myristic and palmitic acid moieties. All SFKs have a conserved glycine residue immediately after the start methionine. The start methionine is removed and myristate is cotranslationally fused to the glycine at position 2 (Johnson *et al.*, 1994). Myristoylation engenders SFKs with the ability to attach to cellular membranes after the new lipid moiety is inserted into the inner membrane leaflet. Most SFKs, including Lck and Fyn, also undergo reversible palmitoylation at cysteine 3 and at either cysteine 5 (Lck) or cysteine 6 (Fyn) (Paige *et al.*, 1993; Koegl *et al.*, 1994). While Lck and Fyn are both myristoylated and palmitoylated, their localization is nonoverlapping within T cells, suggesting that other domains further regulate localization (Ley *et al.*, 1994; Lin *et al.*, 2000). Whereas Lck is more abundantly found at the plasma membrane, Fyn largely colocalizes with centrosomal and mitotic structures. The unique domain, as discussed below, is likely to contribute to their differential localization within the T cell.
- Unlike the unique domain of all other SFKs, whose functions are unclear, that of Lck is known to mediate its interaction with the coreceptors CD4 and CD8. CD4 and CD8 are T-cell-specific transmembrane proteins that bind to invariant regions of class II and class I major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules, respectively. Lck specifically interacts with the coreceptors CD4 and CD8 through a dicysteine motif present in its unique N-terminal domain and with two cysteines in the cytoplasmic domains of CD4 and CD8 (Turner *et al.*, 1990). Recent structural studies have revealed that the cysteine-dependent interaction involves a 'zinc clasp'-like structure, as originally speculated on by Turner *et al.* (1990) (Kim *et al.*, 2003). As discussed below, the interaction of Lck with these coreceptors facilitates its participation in the initiation of TCR signal transduction during antigen recognition.
- As with other SFKs, the SH3 and SH2 domains are involved in intramolecular and intermolecular regulation (see below) by mediating protein-protein interactions via poly-proline and phosphotyrosine-specific interactions, respectively. The binding specificities of

the SH2 and SH3 domains of Lck and Fyn are considerably different. The combinatorial interactions of these paired domains could contribute to differences in the binding specificities and the distinct substrate profile of these SFKs. Specific interactions for either Lck or Fyn have been reported (reviewed in Zamoyska *et al.*, 2003). Distinct localization patterns also may contribute to the distinct specificities of these kinases. Of note, Fyn localization suggests interactions with cytoskeletal regulators. Indeed, Fyn specifically interacts with the focal adhesion kinase family (Kanazawa *et al.*, 1996; Qian *et al.*, 1997) and was recently shown to bind, phosphorylate, and enhance WASP activity in T cells (Badour *et al.*, 2004).

#### Model of regulation and activation

It has been more than 15 years since Rudd *et al.* (1989) and Veillette *et al.* (1988) first demonstrated that Lck is noncovalently associated the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors in T cells. Soon thereafter, biochemical work in the somatically mutated leukemic T-cell line Jurkat (J.CaM1) firmly established the role of SFK in proximal TCR signal transduction (Goldsmith and Weiss, 1987; Straus and Weiss, 1992). Here, we briefly summarize what has been learned since then (Figure 1).
- Lck is regulated like other SFKs, via its C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine. In normal thymocytes or T cells, this site is normally not phosphorylated, rendering Lck in a so-called ‘primed’ state, ready to be activated. During TCR-MHC/peptide interactions, Lck is recruited to the complex via its noncovalent association with either CD8 or CD4 coreceptors. It is likely that Lck molecules transphosphorylate their activation loop tyrosines (Y394) upon clustering of the coreceptors during antigen recognition. After coligation of the TCR and either of the coreceptors, active Lck is proximally positioned to phosphorylate-specific tyrosine residues within ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) located within the CD3 and TCRζ signaling chains of the TCR, including the three tandem ITAMs within each of the covalently linked TCRζ chains. ITAMs consist of evolutionarily conserved amino-acid sequence motifs of D/ExYxxLx(6–8)YxxL (Reth, 1989). Sufficient clustering leads to doubly phosphorylated ITAMs and recruitment of Syk-family kinases (ZAP-70 in T cells) to the ITAMs via their tandem SH2 domains. Lck then phosphorylates and activates ZAP-70, which then is likely to trans-autophosphorylate to achieve its full activation. Subsequently, ZAP-70 phosphorylates T-cell-specific adapters, such as LAT and SLP-76 leading to the recruitment and activation of other kinase families and enzymes, resulting in secondary messenger generation and culminating in T-cell activation. T-cell activation is characterized by entry into cell cycle and changes in gene expression consistent with T cells achieving full effector function. While the generalities of this pathway have been delineated, many questions remain. The major findings that have led to this model

Figure 1 Recruitment and activation of SFKs during initial canonical TCR stimulation. Lck and Fyn are both involved in early TCR signal transduction events. Associated with CD4 and CD8, Lck is recruited to the TCR–MHC interactions. In TCR-expressing cells, Lck is activated outside of lipid rafts, and then is recruited into rafts, concurrent with Fyn activation within lipid rafts. It is unclear where the pool of Fyn that is initially activated is localized within the cell, but it appears to reside in rafts. ZAP-70 subsequently binds doubly phosphorylated ITAMs via its tandem SH2 domains. SFKs phosphorylate and activate recruited ZAP-70. ZAP-70 then phosphorylates the T-cell specific adapters LAT and SLP-76, which leads to recruitment of other enzymes and adapters, resulting in second messenger generation. Fyn is necessary for IL-2 induction and can specifically phosphorylate cytoskeletal regulators, including WASP, FAK, and Pyk2. See the text for details.

of SFK involvement in TCR signaling will now be reviewed in more detail.
Lck adopts specific conformations that largely dictate its level of activity. When the crystal structures of inactive Hck and Src and active Lck were solved, a common mechanism of activation was proposed (Sicheri and Kuriyan, 1997; Xu et al., 1999). The structures indicate that when the C-terminal 505 tyrosine residue (Y505) is phosphorylated, Lck adopts a closed conformation, where the pY505 residue creates an intramolecular binding motif for the SH2 domain, effectively inactivating the kinase domain. Additionally, the SH3 domain of Src also forms intramolecular interactions with the linker between the SH2 and kinase domains, further stabilizing a ‘closed’ conformation. This mode of regulation likely applies to Lck and Fyn (Sicheri and Kuriyan, 1997; Xu et al., 1999). In contrast, phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine (Y394 in Lck) of the kinase domains of ‘primed’ Lck and Fyn promotes an active conformation and increases their catalytic activity 2–4-fold. Thus, the interactions of the SH2 and SH3 domains as well as phosphorylation status of the activation loop tyrosine control the conformation and activity of these kinases.
In addition to the crystallographic studies, many biochemical studies also support the interpretation that transphosphorylation between different Lck molecules is inhibited when Y505 is phosphorylated, because the enzyme is conformationally closed. As occurs in v-Src (Tanaka and Fujita, 1986), deletion or mutation of Y505 in Lck results in a ‘constitutively’ active enzyme (Marth et al., 1988). The transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) RPTPα is thought to dephosphorylate the analogous C-terminal regulatory tyrosine of c-Src and may also dephosphorylate Fyn (Su et al., 1999). In contrast, Lck and Fyn are dephosphorylated by the highly expressed and hematopoietic-specific PTP, CD45, and not RPTPα. CD45 specifically dephosphorylates the C-terminal Y505 residue of Lck and is thought to be a critical positive regulator of Lck and Fyn in T cells (Hermiston et al., 2003). Studies in T-cell lines and in the CD45-deficient mouse, both argue for the importance of CD45 for SFK activity. CD45-deficient T-cell lines contain Lck and Fyn molecules that are hyperphosphorylated at their C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosines and exhibit a drastic reduction in TCR-stimulated phosphotyrosine induction (Ostergaard et al., 1989; Koretzky et al., 1991; Stone et al., 1997). CD45-deficient mice have few peripheral T cells since TCR signaling during thymic development is greatly impaired (Kishihara et al., 1993; Byth et al., 1996). As is true for c-Src, Csk is thought to be the kinase that phosphorylates Y505 of Lck, driving Lck towards an inactive state. Thus, CD45 and Csk function to positively and negatively regulate SFK function in T cells, respectively, with directly antagonistic actions. Conformationally, Lck may therefore exist in an equilibrium state, where subpopulations of molecules simultaneously exist as (1) open and activated (phosphorylated on Y394), (2) open and not activated—or ‘primed’, and (3) closed and not activated (Hermiston et al., 2003). CD4 or CD8 coreceptor ligation might shift the equilibrium toward open and activated states by clustering and activating Lck molecules, culminating in a tyrosine kinase cascade.
How CD45 and Csk are themselves regulated and the impact on Lck and Fyn activation is only beginning to be understood. Forced dimerization of chimeric CD45 phosphatase molecules inhibits CD45 function, resulting in blunted TCR signaling (Desai et al., 1993). This appears to be mediated by a juxtamembrane wedge-like structure that can interact with and block the catalytic

site of the partner phosphatase during dimerization (Majeti et al., 1998; Majeti et al., 2000). Disruption of this regulatory mechanism leads to lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity in mice (Majeti et al., 2000). No ligand has been found for CD45. However, the CD45 RNA is differentially spliced in a highly regulated manner during various stages of thymocyte development and peripheral T-cell activation. This results in significantly different extracellular domains encoding different numbers of O-glycosylation modifications that may regulate spontaneous homodimerization and, thus, the activity of the phosphatase (Xu and Weiss, 2002). For instance, smaller molecular isoforms that are less heavily O-glycosylated spontaneously dimerize more efficiently.

Csk, via its SH2 domain, constitutively associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated PAG/Cbp (PAG), a lipid raft targeted transmembrane adapter protein (Brdicka et al., 2000; Kawabuchi et al., 2000). PAG expression and localization should therefore affect SFK function (Lindquist et al., 2003). TCR stimulation appears to induce the transient dephosphorylation of PAG, thereby releasing Csk from its plasma membrane anchor (Torgersen et al., 2001; Davidson et al., 2003). The release of Csk from its proximity with Lck may serve to facilitate and/or sustain the activation of Lck and Fyn.

For Lck and Fyn to be involved in TCR signal transduction, they must each be recruited to the stimulated receptor complex and then activated. The interaction of Lck with the coreceptors CD4 and CD8 plays a role here. The TCR scans MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells within a peripheral lymphoid organ until it is stabilized by specific recognition of a foreign peptide antigen bound in an MHC molecule groove. Further stabilization of TCR with the MHC/peptide occurs when CD4 or CD8 bind the nonvariable regions of MHC. This also results in clustering and activation of Lck molecules and juxtapositioning active Lck to tyrosine residues within CD3 and TCRζ ITAMs. In contrast to Lck, Fyn can instead interact directly with the CD3 subunits, although this is of low stoichiometry (Timson Gauen et al., 1992). One recent report suggested that the adaptor Unc119 may link both Lck and Fyn to TCRζ and CD4. Recombinant Unc119 could activate Lck and Fyn and bind to their SH3 domains, perhaps facilitating an ‘open’ and active confirmation (Gorska et al., 2004). Thus, the coreceptors CD4 or CD8, perhaps together with Unc119, may participate in the recruitment and clustering of Lck and/or Fyn with CD3 and TCRζ ITAMs.

Lck and Fyn localization within a lymphocyte is largely different. Yet, each is activated by the TCR, with overlapping, yet distinct functionality. Therefore, it is unclear how the TCR initially recruits and activates each kinase. They may function redundantly and independently. However, Julius and co-workers recently proposed a mechanistic link for activation of each kinase, involving differences in their lipid raft localization (Filipp et al., 2003). After crosslinking primary T cells with anti-TCR and anti-CD4 antibodies, they

observed a kinetic discrepancy in kinase activation, with Lck activity peaking early and Fyn lagging behind, all within the first 2 min after stimulation. Lck catalytic activity initially increased outside lipid rafts, then quickly increased in the raft fraction. Fyn activation (both in and out of rafts) markedly increased after initial Lck activity and even increased after Lck activity had waned. Importantly, Filipp et al. (2003) showed that Fyn could not be activated in Lck-deficient T cells. This study suggests a model whereby Lck: (1) is initially activated outside of rafts; (2) then translocates into rafts; and (3) then activates Fyn molecules already residing in rafts. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant Lck that predominantly localizes to rafts resulted in an increased basal Fyn kinase activity, while overexpression of a nonraft associating Lck did not (Filipp et al., 2004). However, the translocation of activated Lck into lipid rafts was not directly shown to be necessary for Fyn activation in rafts. Clearly, Fyn activation depends on Lck when TCR and CD4 are crosslinked, but more research needs to be carried out to clarify the role of Lck in Fyn activation.

Work in this laboratory and others established that after SFKs are recruited and activated by TCR ligation, they have two important functions for propagating and amplifying TCR signaling. First, SFKs must phosphorylate ITAMS within the TCR signaling complex and then must phosphorylate and activate Syk-family kinases, which are recruited via their tandem SH2 domains to the ITAMs. Lck was established as the kinase responsible for phosphorylating tyrosines within TCRζ ITAMs in T cell lines and later in thymocytes and primary T lymphocytes. In the stimulated Lck-deficient Jurkat derivative, JCaM1, there is a complete lack of detectable inducible tyrosine phosphorylation, including that on TCRζ (Straus and Weiss, 1992). ITAM tyrosine phosphorylation was restored when Lck was reintroduced back into these cells. In fact, ITAMs are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in primary cells, including in thymocytes and peripheral T cells (van Oers et al., 1993; Pitcher et al., 2003). Studies of the Lck-deficient mouse revealed that levels of TCRζ phosphorylation in resting or stimulated thymocytes was severely reduced (primarily DP thymocytes, see below). Peripheral T cells also had a more moderate decrease in constitutively phosphorylated TCRζ chains (van Oers et al., 1996a). Both observations are consistent with the lower Fyn expression in DP thymocytes and higher Fyn expression in mature T cells. These data suggest that the major initial downstream targets of Lck are the TCRζ chain ITAMs, and that Fyn can substitute for Lck in peripheral T cells but to a lesser extent.

Finally, after SFKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues within ITAMs, Syk-family kinases are recruited via their tandem SH2 domains to the doubly phosphorylated ITAMs. Once recruited into the TCR complex, SFKs then phosphorylate the Syk kinases and thereby activate the recruited Syk-family kinase member. ZAP-70 is the Syk-family kinase primarily expressed in T cells and is highly dependent on Src kinases for its activation (Iwashima et al., 1994). Syk may be less dependent on

SFKs for its catalytic activation, as it is able to trans-
autophosphorylate and activate itself, although its
activation is clearly facilitated by SFK (Chu *et al.*, 1998; Turner *et al.*, 2000). This two-step model of
recruitment of Src- and then Syk-family kinases is a
fundamental feature of the TCR tyrosine kinase cascade
and has proven generally applicable to all ITAM-
based immunoreceptor signaling systems (Latour and
Veillette, 2001).

These studies raise various other issues that have
not been fully resolved. For example, in resting primary
T cells and thymocytes, ZAP-70 is associated with
phosphorylated TCRζ chains, yet it itself is not
phosphorylated, nor activated, until crosslinking of the
TCR. Additionally, despite constitutive TCRζ ITAM
phosphorylation, ITAMs within other CD3 chains are
not phosphorylated in *ex vivo* T cells (Pitcher *et al.*, 2003). Current data suggest that constitutively phos-
phorylated TCRζ and bound ZAP-70 may transduce
low level signals necessary for mature T-cell survival,
for lymphopenic expansion within the periphery, or for
sensitizing the TCR for antigen stimulation (see below
within *Mature T-cell function*).

**A primer on T-cell development**

It is becoming clear that TCR signaling affects the
selection and survival of T cells at every stage of
development. Since the TCR signaling pathway critically
depends on the function of SFKs, a broad understanding
of T-cell development is necessary in order to appreciate
the varying functions of SFKs in the T lineage (Figure 2).
Thymocyte development proceeds through well-defined
stages and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere (Short-
man and Wu, 1996; Sebzda *et al.*, 1999). Briefly,
lymphocyte progenitor cells (that retain B, T, natural
killer, and dendritic cell potential) migrate from the bone
marrow to the thymus via the bloodstream. In the
thymus, these 'DN1' cells ('double-negative', as they do
not yet express the T-cell coreceptors CD4 or CD8)
receive survival and instructive signals to initiate the αβ
T-cell developmental pathway. Initially, at least, Notch
and IL-7 signals are required to proceed from the DN1
to the DN2 and DN3 stages.

After instructive signals from Notch ligands, the DN3
stage is where the first critical checkpoint during
thymocyte development occurs. Progression and expan-
sion past the DN3 stage requires surface expression of
the product of a productive chromosomally rearranged
TCRβ chain. This newly formed TCRβ chain pairs with
an invariant pre-Tα chain. This heterodimer then
associates and is transported to the plasma membrane
with the CD3 and TCRζ chains in order to produce a
TCR-like signal. This 'pre-TCR' signal requires the
same adapter proteins, LAT and SLP-76, that are
required for TCR signaling in model cell lines. The pre-
TCR signal fulfills at least four separable functions:
(1) rescue from apoptosis, (2) differentiation, (3) entry
into cell cycle, and (4) allelic exclusion (reviewed

![Figure 2](#)

Figure 2 TCR-based signaling uses SFKs and is necessary
throughout T-cell development. The canonical TCR signaling
mechanism is fundamental to all stages of T-cell development and
peripheral function. Lck and Fyn are critically involved at each
stage, but their overlapping function has made accurate assess-
ments of their individual contributions difficult. Animal studies
with kinases that are deleted, overexpressed, dominant negative,
and dominant active suggest that Lck primarily mediates ITAM
phosphorylation throughout the T-cell lineage. However, Lck and
Fyn seem equally capable of low-level basal ITAM phosphoryla-
tion during nonspecific self-MHC recognition in lymphoid tissue,
which is necessary for naïve T-cell survival. Thus, the relative
contributions of each kinase presented here are inferred from the
currently reported *ex vivo* studies. A direct measurement of SFK
contribution for TCR activation awaits direct analysis in single
cells at different stages of development. In addition to cytokines,
it is unclear whether TCR signals contribute to memory T-cell
survival. Lck also seems most important for negative selection at
the DP stage (not depicted here). See the text for details

in Kruisbeek *et al.*, 2000). Cells unable to generate a
proper pre-TCR signal are arrested and die at the DN3
stage (technically, this is the TCRβ selection stage, but
we will refer to all stages by their 'DN' or 'DP'
nomenclature for convenience). Proper signaling allows
progression through the DN4 stage and to the DP stage
('double-positive', as they now express both CD4 and
CD8). The next critical checkpoint occurs during the
DP stage and is also dependent on a TCR-based
signal. Thymocytes are 'educated', which means they
are selected for nonautoreactivity and proper MHC-
restricted usefulness at the DP stage. This stage requires
that a newly and properly rearranged TCRα chain pairs
with the previously expressed TCRβ chain. Since the
repertoire of TCRs is stochastically generated via
random rearrangements of gene segments and the
random pairing of TCRα and β chains, selection for a
useful repertoire of TCR-bearing cells is critical. This
newly formed TCRαβ interacts with complexes of self-
MHC molecules that have bound self-peptides and are
expressed on stromal or antigen-presenting cells, result-
ing in one of three outcomes. Very strong interactions
are likely representative of autoreactivity; these cells are
'negatively' selected and die via apoptosis. Medium
strength signals are likely to be useful and these cells are
'positively' selected. These DP thymocytes downregulate

either CD4 or CD8, becoming ‘single-positive’ (SP) thymocytes, and eventually migrate to the periphery. Cells expressing TCRs unable to generate a positively selecting signal are arrested and die at the DP stage.

### SFK function during the DN to DP transition

Lck and Fyn are critical during thymocyte development as evidenced by genetic studies. The Lck-deficient mouse has a specific and significant, although incomplete, block in T-cell development at the DN3 stage, where pre-TCR signaling is required to transit this developmental checkpoint (Molina et al., 1992). Equal numbers of DN3 cells are generated in the Lck-deficient mouse, but DP cells are reduced >10-fold and SP cells are almost undetectable. Thus, Lck appears necessary for proper progression through the DN3 stage and for efficient pre-TCR signaling. Fyn-deficient mice appear to have no block in pre-TCR signaling, since the absolute number and frequencies of all thymic subpopulations are relatively intact (Appleby et al., 1992; Stein et al., 1992). This could suggest that pre-TCR signaling is somewhat SFK independent. However, a strict requirement for SFK activity was discovered after Lck and Fyn-deficient mice were crossed together (Groves et al., 1996; van Oers et al., 1996b). The double knockout mice exhibited an absolute block at the transition from the DN3 to DN4 stage of thymocyte development.

Interestingly, when Lck/Fyn doubly deficient mice were injected with anti-CD3 antibodies, thymocytes could be induced to differentiate to the DP stage, along with a modest expansion in cell number (Chu et al., 1999). When this treatment is given to Rag-deficient mice (whose thymocytes are also blocked at this stage due to an inability to rearrange TCRβ chains), DP cells are generated to wild-type levels (Levelt and Eichmann, 1995). The antibody is thought to crosslink very low levels of CD3 molecules that are able to reach the surface of Rag DN3 cells that lack a pre-TCR. This treatment has no effect in LAT (Zhang et al., 1999)- or SLP-76 (Pivniouk et al., 1998)-deficient mice, indicating that these adaptor proteins are nonredundant and play critical signaling functions needed for pre-TCR signaling and β-selection. When Chu et al., assayed DN3 cells from Lck/Fyn double knockouts or from Rag mice for expression of other SFKs, they noted specific expression of Fgr—normally expressed in myeloid cells—in Lck/ Fyn-deficient mice. Therefore, Fgr can be expressed at the DN3 stage (though this was not assayed in wild-type DN3s), but is not sufficient for initiating pre-TCR signaling under physiologic conditions.

Differences between Lck and Fyn function during pre-TCR signaling are also evident in several transgenic studies. Activated Lck (Y505F) functions much like activated Src in fibroblasts, inducing spontaneous cell cycling that can ultimately lead to transformation. Lck has different effects depending on the level of transgene expression and activity. When expressed in

Rag-deficient mice, LckY505F can confer thymocyte differentiation and proliferative activity beyond the DN3 stage, to near wild-type numbers of thymocytes (Mombaerts et al., 1994). Similar results were seen when CD4 was expressed in Rag-deficient thymocytes, suggesting Lck could be activated by crosslinking CD4 with endogenous MHC Class II molecules and drive downstream signaling events in the absence of the pre-TCR (Norment et al., 1997). However, greater activity from high levels of normal Lck or active LckY505F can inhibit normal pre-TCR signaling because it can induce allelic exclusion by shutting off the recombination mechanism before a TCRβ can be properly rearranged and expressed on the plasma membrane (Abraham et al., 1991a; Anderson et al., 1992). From these studies, it remains unclear why the activated Lck does not cause greater expansion of the allelically excluded DN cells, but perhaps increasing levels of Lck have different effects. Low levels of Lck activity may be sufficient for allelic exclusion, whereas increased levels may be required for pre-TCR-independent cell cycle progression. Even greater amounts of transgenic active Lck results in thymic lymphomas (Abraham et al., 1991b), as might be expected from an activated and unregulatable SFK. Dominant negative transgenic LckR273 effectively inhibits all αβ T-cell development by blocking production at the DN3 stage (Levin et al., 1993). As the dominant negative Lck molecule used (kinase inactive) would likely inhibit Fyn function in pre-TCR signaling, these results suggest that appropriate levels of SFK activity are critical for pre-TCR signaling and is consistent with the Lck/Fyn double knockout phenotype. A similar dominant negative Fyn (kinase inactive) construct had mild inhibitory effects on early T-cell development when overexpressed at 5–7-fold (Cooke et al., 1991), perhaps indicating that Fyn may not be able to cross inhibit all of Lck activity. Increased levels of Fyn could only partially rescue the developmental block seen in Lck-deficient mice and hardly perturbed normal development, further underscoring their overlapping but unique function (Anderson et al., 1992; Groves et al., 1996). Finally, it should be noted that chimeric experiments swapping the kinase domains of Lck and Fyn suggest that Lck activity is greatly influenced by its N-terminal, SH3, and SH2 domains (Lin et al., 2000).

The regulation of Lck and Fyn during pre-TCR signaling is poorly understood. Classically, in mature T cells, Lck is purportedly recruited and crosslinked via its association with CD4 and/or CD8, combined with TCR-peptide/MHC interactions. DN3 cells have no CD4 or CD8 to recruit Lck. Fyn can associate with the TCR in hybridoma cell lines independently of coreceptors (Samelson et al., 1990), but the stoichiometry is low and the Fyn-deficient mouse has no obvious block, suggesting that Fyn is not critical for DN to DP progression. Moreover, Fyn does not localize to the plasma membrane in T lymphocytes (although Fyn localization in DN3 cells has not been reported). The pre-TCR requires plasma membrane expression for signaling (O'Shea et al., 1997). DN3 cell membranes

are reported to be highly enriched for lipid rafts suggesting an equilibrium shift from elemental to coalescent rafts as a potential mechanism for spontaneous Lck clustering and activation once the ITAM-containing pre-TCR is expressed (Saint-Ruf *et al.*, 2000; Dykstra *et al.*, 2003; Haks *et al.*, 2003). One study reported constitutive recruitment of Lck and phosphorylation of ZAP-70 in cells expressing a pre-TCR (Saint-Ruf *et al.*, 2000). However, it should be noted that transformed cell lines used in that study may not reflect physiologic DN3 cells newly expressing a TCRβ chain. A definitive understanding of Src- and Syk-family kinase recruitment and activation during pre-TCR signaling will require analysis of endogenous DN3 cells, either by biochemical or by single-cell analysis. Moreover, when pre-TCR signaling has been studied in developing cells, most investigators have either inactivated or overexpressed proteins early in the T-cell lineage to understand their function. Thus, while we know what can affect pre-TCR signaling, it is not clear what actually happens in the normally developing cell. A biochemical understanding of how SFK activity is regulated in pre-T cells is also lacking. For example, the positive SFK regulator CD45 is highly expressed at this stage, yet the CD45-deficient mouse only has a partial block in development (Kishihara *et al.*, 1993; Byth *et al.*, 1996), even though SFK function is critical at this stage. While CD45, Csk, and PAG are all expected to affect SFK function, little is known of their activity, localization, and recruitment dynamics in the DN subset of cells.

yield any DP thymocytes, making loss-of-function studies of these classes of enzymes or adaptor proteins at the DP checkpoint impossible. To address such questions, conditional deletion of specific molecules is needed.

Efforts to explain the nature of the signals involved in thymocyte selection and distinct lineage commitment (CD4 vs CD8 lineages) have reached the status of immunology lore, where paradigms have shifted from 'classic' models of instructive to stochastic and back to instructive. The complex nature of CD4 and CD8 regulation during thymocyte selection obscured early models of lineage commitment (Germain, 2002). Nowadays, the large amount of empirical data that have emerged suggest models that are not so different and are all based on the strength of the TCR signal, in some form. It should be pointed out, however, that differences in duration of the TCR signal as opposed to the intensity of the signal may instead underlie lineage commitment of CD4 vs CD8 cells (Singer, 2002). The existing data on SFK involvement in thymocyte selection cannot distinguish between these two models.

Since CD4 and CD8 associate with and recruit Lck, and CD4 and CD8 coreceptors are required to direct cells into their respective lineages, it was quickly inferred that Lck transduces signals of positive selection. The Lck knockout mouse supports this idea, as SP CD4s and CD8s are vastly reduced (1% of wild type), even relative to DP cells (~10% of wild type) (Molina *et al.*, 1992). Fusing the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of CD4 to the extracellular domain of CD8 diverted a transgenic MHC-I-restricted TCR into the CD4 lineage (Seong *et al.*, 1992), suggesting that CD4's stronger association with Lck 'instructed' a CD4 SP lineage commitment. Transgenic studies reintroducing Lck with different activities have provided good evidence that increasing Lck activity is sufficient to promote CD4 commitment and, conversely, decreasing Lck activity can promote CD8 commitment (Hernandez-Hoyos *et al.*, 2000; Legname *et al.*, 2000). Moreover, until recently, it was not formally known if other upstream molecules are involved. When the SFK negative regulator Csk was deleted from the T-cell lineage, all TCRs were directed to the CD4 lineage, regardless of MHC restriction or even in the absence of MHC molecules (Schmedt *et al.*, 1998; Schmedt and Tarakhovsky, 2001). However, the effects of losing Csk on the Lck/Fyn double knockout were not directly addressed in the DP fraction. Nevertheless, the effects of Csk, and by extension SFK, on positive selection and lineage commitment are apparent. Taken together, these studies strongly indicate that Lck is primarily responsible for transmitting to downstream pathways the positive selection signal and that this signal also determines CD4 vs CD8 lineage fate.

The strength of signal theory of thymocyte selection also postulates that the strongest TCR signals generated at the DP stage may signify that the TCR would be autoreactive and, therefore, cells bearing this receptor need to be deleted. Lck is expected to be required in this process (Hashimoto *et al.*, 1996; Schmedt *et al.*, 1998;

SFK function during the DP to SP transition

After early thymocytes pass the pre-TCR signaling checkpoint, they clonally proliferate, upregulate the coreceptors CD4 and CD8 and wait to be selected or deleted at the DP selection stage. The DP thymocyte is the stage where autoreactive T cells are deleted, useful self-MHC restricted T cells are selected to progress to the most mature SP stage of development, and useless cells die by neglect. It is also a stage where each individual cell is truly bipotential, able to become either a CD4+ or CD8+ T cell, under proper stimulation. While very distinct, these two theoretically intriguing concepts have fueled intense study and have been extensively reviewed (Sebzda *et al.*, 1999; Germain, 2002; Singer, 2002). Knockouts of the coreceptors, MHC molecules, ZAP-70, and CD45 (among others) have clearly established that TCR signaling, after proper self-peptide/MHC molecule interactions, is necessary for positive and negative selection. However, a major problem with studying TCR signaling during DP selection is that when a mouse is made germ-line deficient in a critical adapter protein or an entire kinase family, it usually exhibits a complete block in thymocyte development at the earlier, pre-TCR signaling stage. Thus, the compound knockouts of Lck/Fyn or Syk/ZAP-70, or the unique adapters LAT, or SLP-76 do not

Trobridge *et al.*, 2001), but data on this point are conflicting (Nakayama and Loh, 1992; Penninger *et al.*, 1996). Again, the low expression of Fyn may be enough to impact selection (Utting *et al.*, 1998). As in early pre- TCR signaling, positive and negative selection signaling may employ either Lck or Fyn or both, making the definitive role of each difficult to determine due to their partially redundant nature.

### Mature T-cell function

After cells are positively selected in the thymus, they are ultimately released to the periphery as CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells. There, they migrate through lymph nodes and spleen, and other secondary lymphoid organs, scanning antigen-presenting cells for their cognate self-MHC + foreign peptide ligand so that they can be quickly activated during an infection. After a naïve T cell encounters its cognate MHC + foreign peptide during an infection, it becomes activated through signals delivered by the TCR, undergoing clonal proliferation and acquiring effector functions. Some of these T cells also become long-lived memory cells. In addition to recognition of foreign antigen peptide, survival signals are generated that depend upon low-affinity interactions of the TCR and coreceptors with self-MHC molecules. Recent work illustrates how SFK activity is important for many of these events.

Direct analysis of SFK function in peripheral T cells required the advent of systems that allow for manipulation of SFK expression and/or function in intact mature T cells because of the developmental blocks in SFK-deficient mice. Gene-targeting studies allowed some analysis of peripheral T cells from mice that are either Lck or Fyn deficient. Peripheral T cells in Lck-deficient mice are greatly reduced in number, reaching only 5–10% wild-type levels (Molina *et al.*, 1992). Unfortunately, it remains unclear whether compensatory mechanisms have allowed these T cells to develop. Nevertheless, after CD3 stimulation, Lck-deficient T cells have a 10-fold decreased proliferative response, which is largely ameliorated when exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) is added to cultures (Molina *et al.*, 1992). Fyn-deficient splenic T cells show only mild impairment in CD3-stimulated proliferation, support relatively normal T-helper cell function, but secrete little, if any, IL-2 (Appleby *et al.*, 1992; Stein *et al.*, 1992). Importantly, Fyn-deficient mice have normal absolute numbers of peripheral T cells. These data suggest that Lck has a greater, more unique role throughout T-cell development and function. Fyn function appears to be less globally critical for mature T-cell generation and function.

As naïve cells circulate through secondary lymphoid tissues, they are in a fairly quiescent state. However, a role for SFK function during naïve T-cell maintenance/ survival was still expected. For example, the phosphorylated TCRζ chains found in *ex vivo* peripheral T cells and thymocytes suggest that low-level signaling may continually be occurring in lymphoid tissues (Pitcher *et al.*, 2003). Two functions for constitutively phosphorylated TCRζ have been proposed. One line of study suggests that such constitutive phosphorylation of the TCRζ chain serves to prime the TCR and increase its sensitivity to encounter with foreign antigen (Stefanova *et al.*, 2002). It has also been recently proposed that naïve T-cell survival and lymphopenic expansion in the periphery may depend on constitutive SFK phosphorylation of TCRζ chains. This work has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Zamoyska *et al.*, 2003) and will only be highlighted here.

Previous work indicates that naïve T-cell survival in the periphery is dependent on TCR signals as well as the cytokine IL-7 (Jameson, 2002). CD4+ T cells, which seed MHC-class II-deficient peripheral tissues, do not survive nearly as long as CD4+ T cells seeded into MHC-II-expressing peripheral hosts (Takeda *et al.*, 1996). It is now clear that expression of MHC molecules, the TCR and the CD4 coreceptor (CD8 has not been as thoroughly addressed) are all necessary for long-term survival of naïve T cells and for their homeostatic proliferation in lymphopenic hosts. From this it follows that Lck and Fyn are also likely to serve a role. Through an elegant series of experiments, Zamoyska and co-workers have addressed this question. Using the background of Lck- and Lck/Fyn-double-deficient mice, thymocyte development was restored to somewhat normal levels by expression of a tetracycline-inducible Lck transgene, albeit the transgene was expressed at lower than wild-type levels. The function of Lck in the periphery was then addressed by removal of the induced Lck protein. These researchers have used this approach to study the roles of Lck and Fyn in CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T-cell survival and also to study their roles in lymphopenic-induced naïve T-cell proliferation.

After demonstrating loss of Lck and cessation of thymic output within 7 days of doxycycline withdrawal, these investigators assayed peripheral lymphoid organs for naïve T cells and found that they remained unchanged in number greater than 9 weeks after loss of Lck, with no detectable loss in TCRζ phosphorylation (Seddon *et al.*, 2000). Previous work had demonstrated that T cells with inducible TCR or MHC deletion resulted in half-lives of about 3 weeks (Jameson, 2002). Indeed, when MHC was deleted, TCRζ phosphorylation was also quickly lost (Witherden *et al.*, 2000). Thus, it appeared that Lck was not required for TCRζ phosphorylation and TCR-MHC-dependent long-term survival of naïve T cells. However, when the experiment was performed in Lck/Fyn double knockout background mice, reconstitution with inducible Lck yielded relatively normal numbers of peripheral T cells. However, loss of transgenic Lck now resulted in rapid loss of peripheral naïve T cells, with a half-life of only about 3 weeks (Seddon and Zamoyska, 2002a). This correlated with a complete loss of detectable TCRζ phosphorylation in *ex vivo* T cells (Seddon and Zamoyska, 2002b). These experiments strongly implicate a requirement for SFK phosphorylation of TCRζ in TCR-mediated naïve T-cell survival in peripheral tissues. They also suggest that either Lck or Fyn can fulfill this function equally well.

Naïve T cells must proliferate to fill the peripheral pool during times of lymphopenia, as might occur during acute viral infections or after rapid blood loss (Jameson, 2002). Indeed, these same mechanisms also promote naïve T-cell expansion after cancer chemotherapy or irradiation. Using the same tet-regulated system just described, Seddon *et al.* (2000) investigated the requirement of SFK for lymphopenia-induced proliferation. Loss of Lck prevented naïve T-cell expansion after transfer into a mildly lymphopenic host. Interestingly, Fyn deficiency had little effect on this proliferation. IL-7 could synergize with the TCR-mediated expansion. Thus, there is a discord in Lck and Fyn function in naïve T cells. Either Lck or Fyn can support TCR-dependent naïve T-cell survival, but only Lck (and not Fyn) can support TCR-dependent homeostatic proliferation.

After naïve cells encounter their cognate peptide plus self-MHC, they become activated through the TCR, as detailed above in the *Model of regulation and activation* section. After activation, they proliferate, differentiate and become effector cells, thereby helping to mount an immune response to the pathogen in question. A small fraction of these effector cells will return to a quiescent state and become long-lived memory cells. Memory T cells rely less on MHC/self-peptide-TCR interactions and more on cytokine influence for their long life (Marrack *et al.*, 2000). A recent publication by Zamoyska and co-workers suggests that TCR signals mediated through Lck can affect the CD4+ memory pool (Seddon *et al.*, 2003). As this issue relates to vaccine development and immune reconstitution therapies, more work is needed to answer this definitively.

### Conclusions

SFK appear to be involved in nearly all stages of T-lymphocyte development and function. Whereas much is known of SFK mechanism and activity, a complete understanding of SFK activity in individual cells that are developing, surviving, and responding in the animal is still lacking. Moreover, we are only beginning to understand the real-time effects of modifiers of SFK function, whose activity may also change during development and upon activation.

Interestingly, of the SFK, at least three, Lck, Fyn, and Fgr, are expressed early in T-cell development and both Syk-family kinase members, ZAP-70 and Syk, are expressed in DN cells (Chan *et al.*, 1994). Similarly, three different SFK members are functional in early B development, and recent work suggests that very low levels of ZAP-70 are expressed in addition to Syk at this same stage (Saijo *et al.*, 2003; Schweighoffer *et al.*, 2003). Additionally, LAT and SLP-76 are expressed in early B-lineage cells and CD79β in T-lineage cells (Wang *et al.*, 1998; Su and Jumaa, 2003). One explanation for such redundancy and plasticity during early lineage commitment is that loci are slowly being turned off during development (Rothenberg and Dionne, 2002). An alternative explanation is that redundant families of proteins are purposefully expressed in these early precursors so that the cell can optimally sense a newly synthesized TCRβ or IgH chain and efficiently signal to differentiate and expand selectable cells past this critical checkpoint. This would allow fast and efficient seeding to the periphery whenever organisms need it most.
