A *Burkholderia* strain (JT 1500), able to use 2-naphthoate as the sole source of carbon, was isolated from soil. On the basis of growth characteristics, oxygen uptake experiments, enzyme assays, and detection of intermediates, a degradation pathway of 2-naphthoate is proposed. The features of this pathway are convergent with those for phenanthrene. We propose a pathway for the conversion of 2-naphthoate to 1 mol (each) of pyruvate, succinate, and acetyl coenzyme A and 2 mol of CO₂. During growth in the presence of 2-naphthoate, six metabolites were detected by thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and spectroscopy. 1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate accumulated in the culture broth during growth on 2-naphthoate. Also, the formation of 2′-carboxybenzalpyruvate, phthalaldehyde, phthalate, protocatechuate, and β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid was demonstrated. (1R,2S)-cis-1,2-Dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate was thus considered an intermediate between 2-naphthoate and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, but it was not transformed by whole cells or their extracts. We conclude that this diol is not responsible for the formation of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate from 2-naphthoate but that one of the other three diastereomers is not eliminated as a potential intermediate for a dehydration reaction.

## Fused carbo- and heterocyclic ring systems are a class of aromatic compounds which are of great concern because of their toxicity, carcinogenicity, and resistance to biodegradation (7, 8, 28). As products of combustion and industrial synthesis and as components of fossil fuels, aromatic ring systems are ubiquitous environmental pollutants and are abundant near urban and industrial centers.

In bacterial systems, naphthoic acids were shown to accumulate in the medium when some strains of *Pseudomonas putida* were grown in the presence of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene (20) or 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene (21). Involvement of several hydroxylated naphthoic acids as intermediates in the bacterial degradation of anthracene and phenanthrene is well documented (7, 14). However, there are a few reports on the complete bacterial metabolism of naphthoic acids. Recently Phale et al. (29) described a pathway for biodegradation of 1-naphthoic acid by *Pseudomonas maltophilia* CSV 89. They proposed a pathway including 1,2-dihydroxy-8-carboxynaphthalene, 3-formylsalicyclic acid, and salicylic acid as intermediates.

This report deals with the bacterial oxidation of 2-naphthoate (1) by a *Burkholderia* sp. The pathway is convergent with those for phenanthrene, described elsewhere (12, 13, 18, 32, 33). These proposed pathways involve the formation, accumulation, and utilization of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate (compound 2 [2] [Fig. 1]) (during the transient formation of a slight orange color of the media), which is converted successively to 2′-carboxybenzalpyruvate [3], phthalaldehyde [5], phthalate [6], and protocatechuate [9] (Fig. 1). This report provides evidence for a 13-step catabolic route of 2-naphthoate by *Burkholderia* sp. strain JT 1500 as shown in Fig. 1, part of which we described before (22).

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Bacteria and culture conditions.
A *Burkholderia* strain, JT 1500, isolated from Miami soil and able to grow on 2-naphthoate as the sole source of carbon, was used (identification was provided by the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen, Braunschweig, Germany). Cultures were grown at 30°C in shaking flasks in mineral medium supplemented with 3 mM 2-naphthoate. The composition of the mineral medium (pH 7.0) prepared in deionized water, per liter, was as follows: KH₂PO₄, 6.8 g; (NH₄)₂SO₄, 1.2 g; NaOH, 1.5 g; MgSO₄·7H₂O, 0.25 g; citric acid, 1 g; FeSO₄·7H₂O, 80 mg; CuSO₄·5H₂O, 4 mg; CoSO₄·H₂O, 0.4 mg; MnSO₄·H₂O, 4 mg; NaMoO₄, 0.4 mg; H₃BO₃, 0.4 mg; and ZnSO₄·5H₂O, 2 mg. Growth carbon sources were glucose (15 mM) and/or 2-naphthoate. Inocula (10%) of 15- to 18-h cultures grown in nutrient broth were used.

Mineral agar plates (pH 7.0) contained, per liter of deionized water, the following: KH₂PO₄, 6.8 g; (NH₄)₂SO₄, 1.2 g; NaOH, 1.35 g; MgSO₄·7H₂O, 0.56 g; FeSO₄·7H₂O, 14 mg; and concentrated HCl, 28 μl. Growth substrates were added at a concentration of 5 mM.

### Chemicals.
2-Naphthoate and o-phthalate (Fluka Chemical Co.) and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, phthalaldehyde (2-formylbenzoate), and protocatechuate (Aldrich Chemical Co.) were used. cis-1,2-Dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate was obtained by a transformation of 2-naphthoate by *Pseudomonas testosteroni* A3C (6, 22, 23). 3,4-Dihydroxy-o-phthalate and 4,5-dihydroxy-o-phthalate were prepared by microbial transformations as described previously (10, 24).

### Preparation of cell extracts.
Extracts were prepared by the suspension of harvested cells in 50 mM KH₂PO₄-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), disintegration in a French press at 12,000 lb/in², and centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 20 min and then at 100,000 × g for 1 h.

### Manometric measurements.
The oxidative abilities of several potential metabolic intermediates by whole cells, which were grown with 2-naphthoate, glucose, or phthalate, were examined by conventional Warburg manometry. The main compartment contained 50 mM KH₂PO₄-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) (2.7 ml) and cell suspension (0.2 ml), with 25 mM substrates in the side arm (80 μl) and 20% KOH (0.2 ml) in the center wall.

Oxygen consumption was also measured at 30°C with a Clarke electrode in reaction mixtures containing 50 mM KH₂PO₄-NaOH (pH 7.0) (2.9 ml), washed cell suspensions or extracts (10 to 100 μl), and 25 mM substrate solutions (25 to 50 μl). After measurements of the endogenous rates, the increase in rate due to added substrate was recorded.

### Measurements of enzymatic activities.
1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase (enzyme b [b] [Fig. 1]) activity was assayed by polarographic oxygen uptake with cell extracts in phosphate buffer (air saturated, 50 mM, 2.9 ml), 25 mM substrate (50 μl), extract (100 μl), and FeSO₄·7H₂O (1 mM) at 30°C.

Phthalaldehyde dehydrogenase activity (e) was assayed by NADH formation at 340 nm in reaction mixtures containing 50 mM KH₂PO₄-NaOH buffer (pH

7.0) (0.9 ml), cell extract (100 μl), 25 mM NAD (10 μl), and 25 mM phthalaldehyde (10 μl).

o-Phthalate-4,5-dioxygenase (f) and 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxy-o-phthalate dehydrogenase (g) activities were detected by the conversion of quinate to 2,3-dihydroxyquinolate (λ<sub>max</sub> = 315 nm) as described previously (26). Organisms grown on minimal medium supplemented with 5 mM quinolinic acid were challenged with the addition of a diazotized p-nitroaniline reagent (50 volumes of a 0.3% [wt/vol] solution of p-nitroaniline in 0.8 M HCl and 3 volumes of 5% [wt/vol] NaNO<sub>2</sub> solution mixed immediately before use). The production of an immediate red color (λ<sub>max</sub> = 512 nm) indicates the generation of 2,3-pyrindinediol from quinate, a reaction that has been shown to be catalyzed by phthalate 4,5-dioxygenase (26).

4,5-Dihydroxy-o-phthalate decarboxylase (h) and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase activity (i) activities were assayed by oxygen uptake experiments in a reaction chamber containing air-saturated 50 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) (2.9 ml), 25 mM 4,5-dihydroxyphtalate or 25 mM protocatechuate (30 μl), and cell extract (300 μl) at 30°C.

Analyses. Protein concentration in cell extracts was measured by the method of Bradford (5), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The weight of dry whole cells was determined by optical density at 570 nm in relation to a calibration curve.

2-Naphthoate degradation products were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cold culture supernatants were injected directly onto a HPLC C<sub>18</sub> column system (model S1000, SYKNM), eluted with isopropanol–methanol–1% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (1:5:4 [vol/vol/vol]), and detected at A<sub>254</sub> (model UVIS 204, linear).

To confirm the identities of metabolites, they were isolated by ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extraction of acidified culture supernatants. The extracts and standards were applied to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates, developed in EtOAc-methanol (4:1 [vol/vol]), and detected by UV.

1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate was identified by <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Gemini 200; Varian) with CDCl<sub>3</sub> as an internal standard and solvent and by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (Hewlett Packard).

The whole-cell proton NMR experiments were analyzed with a Bruker 300-MHz spectrometer with H<sub>2</sub>O as the solvent. D<sub>2</sub>O (20% [vol/vol]) was added as a lock.

RESULTS

Identification of the organism. The organism used for the biodegradation studies was identified as a species of *Burkhold*

absorbing intermediates were present in only minor amounts insufficient for characterization.

Proton NMR experiments to follow carbon substrate utilization during growth. As our mineral medium in some growth experiments contained a multitude of substrates, i.e., glucose, citrate, and 2-naphthoate, we used proton NMR (normal one-dimensional Fourier transformation) to analyze the carbon substrate concentrations. We have been developing this method for several fermentations. The data shown in Fig. 3 present the power of this noninvasive method for multiple analyses in single-fermentation samples. In one growth experiment, clear preferences are shown for C utilization by Burkholderia sp. strain JT 1500.

2-Naphthoate (3 mM) is almost completely oxidized within 3 h, whereas glucose (15 mM) added as an additional carbon and energy source is reduced by only 5%, to 14.25 mM. A revealing feature is that citrate was present, putatively only as a chelating agent (5 mM) which was reduced by 50% (deduced from the 2.39-ppm signal). Neither the cells present (2.2 and 9.4 mg [dry weight] ml${}^{-1}$ [Fig. 3B, C, E, and F] in the samples nor the massive H${}_{2}$O signal significantly affected the integrations of signals from 2-naphthoate, glucose, and citrate present at high concentrations (0.2 to 15 mM).

Oxygen uptake experiments. The immediate oxidation of metabolic intermediates by whole cells grown with 2-naphthoate, phthalaldehyde, phthalate, and protocatechuate was examined polarographically. Cells grown on 2-naphthoate oxidized 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, phthalaldehyde, and protocatechuate, but not phthalate and 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate, very rapidly. Oxygen consumption was also shown by cells grown on phthalaldehyde, phthalate, and protocatechuate (Table 2). None of these cells, even phthalate-grown cells, revealed ox-

absorbance at 300 nm is consistent with the presence of a double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring as shown by Barnsley (2) for the phenanthrene pathway and is also consistent with the consumption of oxygen for its formation from 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate (Table 3).

Phthalaldehyde [5] was detected by UV ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 295$ nm) and TLC as a later product of the oxidation of compound 2 by cell extracts, as was phthalate [6] as a product of oxidation of phthalaldehyde [5] by cell extracts when NAD⁺ was used as a cofactor under nitrogen to avoid further reactions.

Protocatechuate [9] was detected by UV ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 287$, 250 nm) and TLC after reaction of 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate with cell extracts under nitrogen.

$\beta$-Carboxy-$cis,cis$-muconic acid [10] ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 260$ nm) and $\gamma$-carboxymuconolactone ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 230$ nm) were shown to be products of the oxidation of protocatechuate [9] by cell extracts

dation of phthalate. This phenomenon could be explained by poor transport of phthalate into the cells when only phosphate buffer was present. None of the following compounds stimulated oxygen uptake with 2-naphthoate-grown cells: catechol, salicylate, gentisate, benzoate, $p$-toluate, 3,5-dimethylbenzoate, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, and 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate.

It is apparent that the 2-naphthoate pathway enzymes are not constitutive since immediate activity is not observed with any of the substrates with glucose-grown cells, as revealed by manometry (Fig. 4) and polarography (data not shown).

Washed suspensions of cells grown with 2-naphthoate and phthalate (data not shown) oxidized 2-naphthoate, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, phthalaldehyde, and protocatechuate immediately. Oxidation of phthalate was slow and occurred to only a very limited extent. Glucose-grown cells consumed O₂ only after a lag time of about 20 min. After 1 to 2 h, the initial fairly rapid oxidation rate diminished considerably; subsequently, a low level of O₂ uptake continued for a much longer period (Fig. 4). This result possibly indicates that intermediates accumulating at the end of the rapid oxidation phase are slowly oxidized further.

The stoichiometry of oxygen consumption of the 2-naphthoate-grown cells has been computed to the end of the rapid oxidation stage, and the data are summarized in Table 3. The oxygen uptake observed corresponds to approximately 50% of the theoretical value for complete combustion. This result is similar for most experiments of this kind and is attributed to carbon assimilation.

Identification of intermediates. It has been reported by other workers that phenanthrene-assimilating bacteria produced and accumulated compound 2 from phenanthrene in their culture media. The production of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate [2] by Burkholderia sp. strain JT 1500 was examined. When the strain was grown in 2-naphthoate medium, the culture developed a slight orange color. Accumulation of compound 2 could be detected by HPLC 8 to 23 h after inoculation (Fig. 5). Phthalaldehyde [5], phthalate [6], and protocatechuate [9] were not detectable. 1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate was isolated by extraction with EtOAc. The ${}^{1}$H NMR spectrum in CDCl₃ showed protons with chemical shifts of 7.35 (1H, d, $J = 7$ Hz); 7.55 (1H, dd, $J = 6; 1$ Hz); 7.65 (1H, dd, $J = 6; 1$ Hz); 7.8 (1H, d, $J = 6$ Hz); 7.85 (1H, d, $J = 6$ Hz); 8.45 (1H, d, $J = 7$ Hz); 11.7 (1H, s). The mass spectrum gave major ions (percentage of intensity) of $m/z$ 188 (21.3%, M⁺), 170 (100%), 144 (10%), 114 (40%).

When limiting quantities of compound 2 were oxidized in the presence of a cell extract, there was an uptake of 9.4 nmol of O₂ min⁻¹ mg of protein⁻¹. 2′-Carboxybenzalpyruvate [3] was determined by UV ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 300$ nm [Fig. 6]). The large

When limiting quantities of protocatechuate [9] were oxidized in the presence of cell extracts, there was an O₂ uptake of 87 nmol min⁻¹ mg of protein⁻¹ (enzyme activities are summarized in Table 4).

The subsequent enzymatic reaction of β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid to γ-carboxymuconolactone, β-ketoadipate, succinate, and acetyl coenzyme A is well described by Ornston and Stanier (27).

Possible role of a 2-naphthoate-cis-1,2-dihydrodiol as an intermediate. (1R,2S)-cis-1,2-Dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate [1a] was considered an intermediate between 2-naphthoate [1] and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate [2] (Fig. 7). The assumption was that 2-naphthoate would be dihydroxylated by a 1,2-dioxygenase to the 1,2-diol followed by a dehydration to 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate (Fig. 7), similar to the formation of cis-1,2-dihydro-1,2-diols in other bacteria from, e.g., benzoate and toluates, but with dehydration rather than dehydrogenation to give either compound 2 or 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene when NAD was also supplied.

The 1,2-diol was prepared as described by Brilon et al. (6), and the absolute structure was determined (23). This specimen of 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate was not transformed by whole cells grown on 2-naphthoate or by their extracts. It is possible that a monooxygenase reaction at C-1 occurs.

DISCUSSION

The organism used in this work was a Burkholderia sp. selected for its ability to grow on 2-naphthoate. The degradation of 2-naphthoate by this strain was examined to confirm and further elucidate the pathway. On the basis of data obtained by isolation of metabolites from the media, monitoring of enzyme activities in cell extracts, and oxygen uptake studies with various metabolic intermediates, we propose a 13-step pathway for

2-naphthoate is 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate degraded, indicating more than one regulatory unit for this pathway (16).

On the basis of published spectroscopic data (2, 11), we could detect 2′-carboxybenzalpyruvate (Fig. 6) and phthalaldehyde (data not shown) as products of the 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate 1,2-dioxygenase activity. This 1,2-dioxygenase is a thermolabile enzyme, which lost about 50% of its activity after 5 min at 30°C. In contrast to results of Barnsley (2), there was no stimulation by Fe²⁺ ions or other metal ions (Mn²⁺ or Mg²⁺) or by mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, and glutathione. 1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate is metabolized to 2′-carboxybenzalpyruvate by a 1,2-ring cleavage. The benzalpyruvate is presumably hydrated and undergoes aldol cleavage to give phthalaldehyde [5] and pyruvate, both of which were formed in equimolar amounts in the absence of NAD⁺. In the subsequent steps, phthalaldehyde is metabolized to phthalate [6] and protocatechuate [9] via 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate [8]. We were able to demonstrate the conversion of phthalaldehyde to phthalate, 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate to protocatechuate, and protocatechuate to β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid [10]. The evidence for involvement of 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate is provided by the following observations: (i) oxygen uptake by a cell extract of 2-naphthoate-grown cells in the presence of 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate occurred, and (ii) phthalate 4,5-dioxygenase and 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxyphthalate dehydrogenase activities were demonstrated with whole cells grown on 2-naphthoate and phthalate. In previous experiments (15), we had also observed a facile decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxy-o-phthalate to protocatechuate with extracts of 2-naphthoate-grown cells, as in o-phthalate-grown *Micrococcus* sp. (10). This result could not be repeated in this series of experiments and is possibly due to a genetic change during this time interval of 8 years, as plasmid and chromosomal DNA sequence exchange is a frequent event in *Burkholderia* sp.

Proton NMR measurements of 2-naphthoate utilization did not reveal identifiable intermediates, although new signals appeared with lower intensities at 7.4 to 7.5 ppm (Fig. 3). We believe that this is the first application of single direct-pulse one-dimensional Fourier transformation NMR spectrometry to examine a biotransformation in vivo and in aqua. This technique is discussed elsewhere for other biotransformations, for transhydroxynitrilase activities of the cloned purified enzyme from *Blevea brasiliensis* (rubber tree) (17) and growing bacterial cultures (31).

Proton NMR measurements revealed a correlation to the

The present data show that the degradative mechanism for the utilization of 2-naphthoate is very similar to those of phenanthrene and 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene (4). 2-Naphthoate is degraded via 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, phthalaldehyde, phthalate, 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate, and protocatechuate as intermediates. With 2-naphthoate, phthalaldehyde, phthalate, and protocatechuate as growth substrates, high oxygen uptake rates were observed with compounds 1, 2, 5, and 9. Oxygen uptake was not detectable with phthalate as a substrate, although it is a good growth substrate. This phenomenon could be explained by poor transport of phthalate into the cells in the absence of a complete growth medium. In addition, the enzymes responsible for the degradation of 2-naphthoate were shown after growth on compounds 1, 5, 6, and 9 but not on glucose by the oxygen uptake studies with whole cells, evidence also for nonconstitutive enzymes of the pathway. Oxygen consumption was not detectable with catechol or salicylate. The Warburg experiments revealed that the enzymes of the 2-naphthoate pathway are inducible with glucose-grown cells after a lag time of about 20 min. We were unable to detect a 2-naphthoate-1-hydroxylase in cell extracts of 2-naphthoate-grown cells with NAD(P)H as a cosubstrate.

Metabolite accumulation is a common characteristic of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon catabolism by bacteria (1). The well-studied transformations involving phenanthrene have shown 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate [2] to be a major transformation product (19). We could also detect an accumulation of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate in the mineral media of 2-naphthoate-grown cells. Compound 2 is produced more rapidly than it is oxidized during the first stage of growth. Only on depletion of

results given in Fig. 2 showing growth and degradation of 2-naphthoate. Two quite independent experiments show that no growth occurs until the degradation of 2-naphthoate starts, although glucose and citrate as carbon sources are also present in the media.
