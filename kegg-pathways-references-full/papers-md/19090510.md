**Evidence that Thienamycin Biosynthesis Proceeds via C-5 Epimerization: ThnE Catalyzes the Formation of (2S,5S)-trans-Carboxymethylproline**

Refaat B. Hamed, Edward T. Batchelor, Jasmin Mecinović, Timothy D. W. Claridge, and Christopher J. Schofield*[a]*

The biosynthetic pathways leading to most clinically important families of bicyclic β-lactam antibiotics and β-lactamase inhibitors involve epimerization steps.[1] In the penicillin/cephalosporin[2–4] and norcardicin[5] biosynthetic pathways, amino acid side chain epimerization can be catalyzed by enzymes from the well characterized pyridoxal phosphate-utilizing family. However, in the case of the pathways leading to clavulanic acid and the simplest naturally occurring carbapenem, (5R)-carbapenem-3-carboxylate, epimerization at the bridgehead C-5 position is likely to occur through unusual, if not unprecedented, reactions (for review see ref. [1]).

The biosynthesis of (5R)-carbapenem-3-carboxylate occurs in three steps[6,7] from malonyl-CoA and L-glutamate semialdehyde 5-hydroxyproline pyrroline-5-carboxylate (L-GHP), with the epimerization step being catalyzed by the 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenase carbapenem synthase (CarC)[8–10] (Scheme 1). The first step in (5R)-carbapenem-3-carboxylate biosynthesis is catalyzed by the unusual crotonase superfamily (CS) enzyme carboxymethylproline synthase (CarB), which produces (2S,5S)-t-carboxymethylproline (t-CMP) from malonyl-CoA and L-GHP.[11–13] Carbapenam synthetase (CarA) then catalyzes the ATP-dependent β-lactam ring formation.[14–16] In the case of C-6 and C-2 functionalized carbapenems such as thienamycin, one of the most potent antibacterials known,[17] it is unclear whether C-5 epimerization is involved.

The gene cluster for thienamycin biosynthesis has recently been sequenced and this sequencing revealed ThnE and ThnM as likely homologues of CarB and CarA, respectively.[13,18] However, a clear homologue of CarC was not identified.[19] Recently, evidence to support the incorporation of coenzyme A into the C-2 side chain of thienamycin after construction of the bicyclic nucleus has been reported.[20] Here, we report studies on recombinant ThnE. Like CarB, ThnE catalyzes the production of (2S,5S)-t-CMP derivatives; this implies a need for a subsequent C-5 epimerization step in thienamycin biosynthesis.

Initially, we cloned the wildtype (wt) *thnE* gene and expressed it in *E. coli* using the pET24a(+) expression vector to give, after purification, wt ThnE that was subsequently shown

Spectra C) and D) represent the mixture of the two C-6 epimers of 6-methyl-t-CMP produced by CarB and ThnE, respectively. Note the different ratios of the two C-6 epimers produced by CarB and ThnE. Spectrum E) is (6R)-6-ethyl-t-CMP produced by CarB.

contrast, incubation of D-GHP with ThnE produced low levels of a product with m/z 174 Da [M+H]+ corresponding to t-CMP, possibly arising from partial epimerization under the acidic deprotection conditions employed in the final step of D-GHP synthesis. These results, together with kinetic analyses using 'H NMR spectroscopy (Table S4 and Figure S15), revealed that ThnE catalyzes the conversion of L-GHP and malonyl-CoA to t-CMP with a similar efficiency to CarB. [25] The production of t-CMP by ThnE implies that the thienamycin biosynthesis pathway, like that leading to (5R)-carbapenem-3-carboxylate, involves a (5S)- to (5R)-epimerization step.

Despite the lack of a clear CarC homologue in the thienamycin gene cluster, bioinformatic analyses indicate that it contains two potential 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases (ThnG

and ThnQ).$^{[19]}$ Given the unusual nature of the CarC epimerization reaction, it is reasonable to propose that one of these oxygenases catalyzes the epimerization step in thienamycin biosynthesis. (The other might catalyze a hydroxylation reaction to produce the 6-hydroxyethyl side chain). However, the lack of close similarity between ThnG or ThnQ and CarC suggests that a single enzyme might not be responsible for both epimerization and desaturation activities in thienamycin biosynthesis.

It has been proposed 1) that the two carbon atoms of the C-6 hydroxyethyl side chain of thienamycin are introduced through separate methyl transfers,$^{[26,27]}$ and 2) that C-6 side chain hydroxylation occurs after introduction of at least one of the C-6 carbons because C-6 hydroxymethyl, ethyl and isopropyl carbapenems have been isolated from Streptomyces sp.$^{[28,29]}$ (Figure 3). The possibility that the C-6 (hydroxy)ethyl group of thienamycin is introduced at an early stage in the pathway led us to test whether ThnE could accept C-2 alkylated malonyl-CoA derivatives. Like CarB, ThnE was found to catalyze the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to a mixture of C-6 methyl t-CMP epimers. However, whereas CarB gave a 55:45 ratio of (6R)-(6S)-epimers, ThnE gave an 80:20 ratio (60% diastereomeric excess) of the same epimers (determined by $^1$H NMR analyses, Figures 2 and S8–9). This result is interesting because the stereochemistry at C-6 of the major epimer is consistent with the C-6 stereochemistry found in thienamycin (Figure 3).$^{[30]}$

Ethylmalonyl-CoA was not converted by ThnE into the anticipated 6-ethyl-t-CMP under our standard conditions (Scheme 2); instead ThnE catalyzed decarboxylation of ethylmalonyl-CoA and hydrolysis of the resultant *n*-butyryl-CoA into

CoASH and *n*-butyric acid. Interestingly, CarB catalyzed the conversion of ethylmalonyl-CoA into the two C-6 epimers of 6-ethyl-t-CMP (~20% yield) in a 2:1 ratio of (6R)-(6S)-epimers (ratio determined by LC-MS, Figure S5) with the stereochemistry of the epimers determined by $^1$H NMR analyses (Figures 2 and S10–14). This result contrasts with that for CarB and methylmalonyl-CoA where an 11:9 ratio of (6R)-(6S)-epimers was observed.$^{[25]}$ Similarly to ethylmalonyl-CoA, dimethylmalonyl-CoA was not converted by ThnE into the anticipated 6,6′-dimethyl-t-CMP, whereas CarB did catalyze the conversion of dimethylmalonyl-CoA to 6,6′-dimethyl-t-CMP.$^{[25]}$ ThnE did, however, catalyze decarboxylation of dimethylmalonyl-CoA and hydrolysis of the resultant isobutyryl-CoA into CoASH and isobutyric acid. Incubation of isopropyl malonyl-CoA with either ThnE or CarB

did not lead to production of 6-isopropyl- *t*-CMP. We also investigated the ability of ThnE to catalyze reactions with other coenzyme A derivatives. Incubation of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA or isobutyryl-CoA with ThnE in the presence of *L*-GHP did not produce any *t*-CMP derivatives. Instead, ThnE catalyzed hydrolysis of these coenzyme A derivatives into CoASH and the corresponding organic acid. The specific activities for the decarboxylation and/or hydrolysis reactions of malonyl-, methylmalonyl-, acetyl- and propionyl-CoA were calculated by using ${}^{1}$H NMR in the presence or absence of *L*-GHP (Scheme 2, Table S4, Figure S15).

Overall, our results reveal that thienamycin biosynthesis likely requires a C-5 epimerization step analogous to that occurring in the biosynthesis of (*5R*)-carbapenem-3-carboxylate. The ThnE catalyzed conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to (*6R*)-methyl-*t*-CMP as the major product (60% *de*) suggests it is possible that the C-6 alkyl group is introduced at an early stage. However, the lack of conversion of ethylmalonyl-CoA to 6-ethyl-*t*-CMP by ThnE suggests subsequent further methylation and/or hydroxylation steps would be required if ThnE is responsible for the final C-6 stereochemistry in thienamycin. Attention can now focus on identification of the C-5 epimerase likely to be present in thienamycin biosynthesis; this epimerase might be encoded for by either *thnG* or *thnQ*.

### Experimental Section

**wt *thnE* cloning, expression, and purification:** A PCR-amplified DNA product corresponding to the *Streptomyces cattleya thnE* gene was engineered as an NdeI-EcoRI fragment into the pET24a(+) expression vector (Novagen, Nottingham, UK) using the following primers: forward, 5′-gag gag gcc ata tga tgg gcg ccg ccg gcg-3′; reverse, 5′-gtg gtg gcg aat tct cag ctc cgc ccg acg-3′. The assigned *thnE* stop codon was mutated from UGA into UAA using the following primers: forward, 5′-gag ctc gaa ttc tta gct ccg ccc gat gac-3′; reverse, 5′-cgg gcg gag cta aga att cga gct ccg tcg-3′. The pET24a/*thnE* plasmid was transformed into *E. coli* BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RP competent cells (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cells were grown in shaken flasks at $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ using 2TY medium containing $50 \mu \mathrm{g} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ kanamycin and $50 \mu \mathrm{g} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ chloramphenicol. When the cells had grown so that the media had an optical density $\mathrm{OD}_{600} 0.7$, the temperature was reduced to $15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, isopropyl-1-thio-$\beta$-D-galactopyranoside ($0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$) was added and cells were allowed to grow for a further 16 h before harvesting by centrifugation at $9000 \mathrm{rpm}$ for 15 min at $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The harvested cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl ($50 \mathrm{~mm}, \mathrm{pH} 7.5$), with addition of protease inhibition cocktail (Sigma) and DNase (Roche), before sonication and centrifugation. The resultant supernatant was filtered and then applied directly to a Q-Sepharose FF column, pre-equilibrated with Tris-HCl ($50 \mathrm{~mm}, \mathrm{pH} 7.5$). Protein was eluted using a $0.0-0.6 \mathrm{M}$ gradient of NaCl in Tris-HCl ($50 \mathrm{~mm}, \mathrm{pH} 7.5$). The ThnE containing fractions, as judged by activity assays and SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled. An equal volume of ammonium sulfate ($2 \mathrm{M}$) was added to a final concentration of $1 \mathrm{M}$. This solution was applied to a phenyl-sepharose HP column, pre-equilibrated with Tris-HCl ($50 \mathrm{~mm}, \mathrm{pH} 7.5$) containing ammonium sulfate ($1 \mathrm{M}$). Protein was then eluted using a $1.0-0.0 \mathrm{M}$ gradient of ammonium sulfate in Tris-HCl ($50 \mathrm{~mm}, \mathrm{pH} 7.5$). ThnE containing fractions were identified by activity assays and SDS-PAGE analysis, and fractions greater than $90 \%$ pure (as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis)

were pooled. The resultant protein solution was exchanged into Tris-HCl, ($50 \mathrm{~mm}, \mathrm{pH} 7.5$), using a PD-10 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), concentrated to $20 \mathrm{mg} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ and stored at $-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until further use.

**Construction of *thnEΔ2–46*, expression and purification:** To generate the N-terminal deletion ThnE variant (Figure 1), the 135 nucleotides (corresponding to the 45 amino acid residues at the N terminus of the protein) after the start codon of pET24a/*thnE* were deleted using the QuikChange® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Protocol (Stratagene). A pET24a/ThnEΔ2–46 plasmid was generated by PCR amplification using the pET24a/*thnE* plasmid as a template and the following primers: forward, 5′-ctt taa gaa gga gat ata cat atg atc gag tgc tcg cgg ctc ggc gac gg-3′; reverse, 5′-ccg tcg ccg agc cgc gag cac tcg atc ata tgt ata tct tct taa ag-3′ and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression and purification of ThnEΔ2–46 was as for wt ThnE.

**ThnE assays and spectral characterization of the products from ThnE and CarB catalyzed reactions:** ThnE incubations and LC-MS analyses were performed as reported for CarB.[13] See the Supporting Information for details of spectroscopic characterization of products. ${}^{1}$H NMR monitoring of wt ThnE and ThnEΔ2–46 catalyzed reactions for specific activity determination was performed as described.[25]
