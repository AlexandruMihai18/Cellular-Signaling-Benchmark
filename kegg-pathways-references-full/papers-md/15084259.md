## Summary

FoxO Forkhead transcription factors are shown here to act as signal transducers at the confluence of Smad, PI3K, and FoxG1 pathways. Smad proteins activated by TGF-β form a complex with FoxO proteins to turn on the growth inhibitory gene $p21Cip1$. This process is negatively controlled by the PI3K pathway, a known inhibitor of FoxO localization in the nucleus, and by the telencephalic development factor FoxG1, which we show binds to FoxO-Smad complexes and blocks $p21Cip1$ expression. We suggest that the activity of this network confers resistance to TGF-β-mediated cytostasis during the development of the telencephalic neuroepithelium and in glioblastoma brain tumor cells.

## Introduction

TGF-β is a pleiotropic cytokine that delivers cytostatic signals to epithelial, neuronal, and immune cells (Siegel and Massagué, 2003; Wakefield and Roberts, 2002). TGF-β activates a membrane receptor serine/threonine kinase complex that phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 (Shi and Massagué, 2003). Once activated, Smads accumulate in the nucleus and form transcriptional complexes with Smad4 and different DNA binding partners, coactivators, and corepressors. These complexes target different genes, depending on their composition (Derynck et al., 1998; Massagué and Wotton, 2000; Miyazawa et al., 2002), and collectively generate hundreds of immediate gene responses (Kang et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003). Identifying these Smad partners, therefore, is essential for delineating cell-specific programs of TGF-β action and their integration in signaling networks.

The TGF-β cytostatic response is of interest, because its loss contributes to tumor development (Dumont and Arteaga, 2003; Siegel and Massagué, 2003; Wakefield and Roberts, 2002). Carcinoma and glioblastoma cells that avert TGF-β-mediated cytostasis may use this factor with impunity to exacerbate their own proliferative, invasive, and metastatic behavior (Derynck et al., 2001).

Jennings and Pietenpol, 1998; Siegel and Massagué, 2003). The TGF-β cytostatic program involves transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors $p21Cip1$ and $p15Ink4b$ and repression of the growth-promoting transcription factors c-myc and Id1-Id3 (Alexandrow and Moses, 1995; Kang et al., 2003; Siegel and Massagué, 2003). Cooperatively, these gene responses mediate cell cycle arrest at G1.

Mechanisms for Smad-mediated repression of c-myc and Id have been elucidated (Chen et al., 2002; Kang et al., 2003; Siegel et al., 2003), but less is known about Smad complexes mediating $p21Cip1$ and $p15Ink4b$ activation. c-Myc levels must be below a certain threshold in order for $p21Cip1$ and $p15Ink4b$ to be activated by TGF-β and other cytostatic signals. When present at high levels, as in mitogen-stimulated cells, c-Myc binds to the $p21Cip1$ and $p15Ink4b$ promoters via the zinc finger protein Miz-1, interfering with activation of these genes by TGF-β (Seoane et al., 2002, 2001; Staller et al., 2001), the tumor suppressor p53 (Seoane et al., 2002), and other signals (Herold et al., 2002; van de Wetering et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2003). c-Myc downregulation by TGF-β renders $p21Cip1$ and $p15Ink4b$ competent for activation. However, relief from c-Myc repression is not sufficient for activation (Seoane et al., 2002, 2001). It has been proposed that activation of $p21Cip1$ and $p15Ink4b$ by TGF-β additionally requires the input of a transactivation complex (Feng et al., 2000; Moustakas and Kardassis, 1998; Seoane et al., 2001).

Here, we identify FoxO proteins as key partners of Smad3 and Smad4 in the TGF-β-dependent generation of a $p21Cip1$ activation complex. FoxO factors are members of the Forkhead box (Fox) family, which figures prominently in the control of cell and organismal growth, development, metabolism, and longevity (Lee et al., 2003; Libina et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2003; Tran et al., 2003; Czech, 2003). FoxO factors are under negative control by the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) growth-promoting pathway (Tran et al., 2003; Czech, 2003; Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002). In response to mitogenic signals, PI3K activates Akt (or PKB), a protein kinase that phosphorylates FoxO proteins, barring them from the nucleus and thus from target genes (Brunet et al., 1999). The present identification of FoxO factors as Smad partners in $p21Cip1$ activation provides a link between the TGF-β/Smad and PI3K/Akt pathways and suggests a broader role for FoxO proteins as signal transducers.

Our analysis further reveals that FoxO-Smad complexes are also inhibited by FoxG1, a distinct Forkhead family member that is essential for neuroepithelial development during telencephalon formation in the mouse (Xuan et al., 1995) and suppresses early cortical cell fate (Hanashima et al., 2004, 2002). Further, the combined actions of FoxG1 and PI3K mediate the intrinsic resistance of human glioblastoma cells to TGF-β induction of $p21Cip1$ and growth inhibition. Thus, three pathways—the Smad, PI3K, and FoxG1 pathways—converge on FoxO factors to influence epithelial and neuronal growth and oncogenesis.

**Results**

**A Smad Input Controlling p21Cip1**

In mitogen-stimulated epithelial cells, a c-Myc-Miz complex binds to the proximal region in the p21Cip1 promoter and inhibits transcription (Herold et al., 2002; Seoane et al., 2002; van de Wetering et al., 2002) (summarized in Figure 1A). On TGF-β addition, Smad3 and Smad4 form a complex with E2F4/5 and p107 to repress c-myc (Chen et al., 2002). The ensuing drop in c-Myc levels relieves p21Cip1 from inhibition, enabling its transactivation by a hypothetical TGF-β-dependent Smad complex (Seoane et al., 2002). We searched for such a complex.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we verified that TGF-β action removes c-Myc from the p21Cip1 proximal promoter (Figure 1B). Simultaneously, TGF-β stimulated the binding of Smad2/3 and Smad4 to a more distal portion of this promoter (Figure 1B). Note that immunoprecipitating antibodies do not distinguish between Smad2 and Smad3. Within this distal portion,

we identified a Smad binding region (SBR) that contains four Smad binding elements (SBE, 5′-AGAC-3′ [Zawel et al., 1998]) (Figure 1A). As a synthetic oligonucleotide, this region binds to an endogenous TGF-β-dependent Smad complex (Figure 1C), and in front of a reporter gene, it mediates TGF-β-dependent transactivation (Figure 1D). Both activities require the integrity of the SBEs, as determined using SBE mutant versions (Figures 1C and 1D).

Although c-Myc inhibited the TGF-β response of the p21Cip1 promoter, it had no effect on the response of the isolated SBR (Figure 1E) and did not diminish Smad binding to the SBR (Figure 1F). Collectively, these results argue that besides relieving Myc-mediated repression from the proximal p21Cip1 promoter, TGF-β induces the formation of a Smad complex that transactivates p21Cip1 from the SBR (summarized in Figure 1A).

suggests that in response to TGF-β, endogenous FoxO and Smad proteins rapidly and specifically bind to contiguous sites on the p21Cip1 promoter and mediate p21Cip1 activation.

A FoxO-Smad Complex

The cooperation of Smad and Fox proteins in p21Cip1 activation suggested that these proteins may form a TGF-β-regulated complex. Indeed, coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HaCaT cells showed that endogenous FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 bind to endogenous Smad2/3 and Smad4 (Figures 3A and 3B). Formation of these complexes was absolutely dependent on TGF-β stimulation, as was the formation of a Smad2/3-Smad4 complex (Lagna et al., 1996) used here as an internal control (Figure 3A). When the Smad binding ability of individual FoxO proteins was examined in TGF-β-treated cells, FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 bound to Smad3 and Smad4 but not to Smad1 (a mediator of BMP signals, a separate branch of the TGF-β family) or Smad2 (Figure 3C). Smad2 is very similar in sequence to Smad3, except that it contains an insert in the MH1 domain that blocks DNA binding (Shi et al., 1998). The Smad2 splice variant that lacks this insert (Yagi et al., 1999) did bind FoxO proteins (data not shown).

The FoxO binding region was mapped to the MH1 domain of Smads 3 and 4 (see Supplemental Figure S2A

at http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/117/2/211/DC1). For contrast, we reproduced the ability of Smads 2 and 3 to bind FoxH1 via the MH2 domain (see Supplemental Figure S2A) (Chen et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1997). The Smad-interacting region was mapped to the FoxO3 domain that includes the DNA binding site (see Supplemental Figures S2B and S2C). These interactions were direct, as determined using purified GST fusion proteins (see Supplemental Figure S2D). In sum, FoxO proteins directly contact Smads 3 and 4, and this involves the domains of FoxO and Smad that contain the DNA binding site (Figure 3D).

FoxO Requirement for p21Cip1 Induction

We used two different approaches to test the requirement for FoxO in p21Cip1 activation by TGF-β. In the first, we used the FoxO1 deletion mutant dnFoxO1 (Nakae et al., 2001) that includes the Smad and DNA binding domain but lacks a transactivation domain (Figure 3E). This mutant should compete with endogenous FoxO by taking its place in contacting both Smads and the SBR but without enabling transactivation. Indeed, expression of dnFoxO via an adenovirus vector in HaCaT cells inhibited the formation of an endogenous FoxO-Smad complex (Figure 3E, top) and completely eliminated the induction of p21Cip1 by TGF-β (Figure 3E, bottom). dnFoxO did not alter the activation of two other TGF-β/

Smad target genes, Smad7 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (Figure 3E, bottom). The selectivity of this effect argued that dnFoxO1 did not sequester Smads in general but rather targeted the p21Cip1 response by interfering with the Smad-FoxO-SBR interaction. Furthermore, dnFoxO1 did not prevent the downregulation of c-myc by TGF-β (Figure 3E, bottom), providing evidence that the drop in c-myc is not sufficient for p21Cip1 induction when the FoxO-Smad complex is disabled.

In the second approach, we knocked down the expression of endogenous FoxO using RNAi. Three FoxO proteins (FoxO1, 3, and 4) redundantly mediate p21Cip1 activation in HaCaT cells, and our attempts at a triple FoxO knockdown in this cell line were ineffective. However, the U87MG human glioblastoma cell line expresses FoxO3 predominantly. TGF-β activates p21Cip1 expression in these cells in the presence of a PI3K inhibitor (Figure 3F, and see below). When foxo3 expression was targeted in these cells using a short hairpin RNA, the induction of p21Cip1 by TGF-β was specifically lost (Figure 3F). In the same cells and conditions, engaging the RNAi machinery in general by targeting a different transcript did not result in a blockade of p21Cip1 expression (refer to Figure 6D). These results suggest that endogenous FoxO is required for p21Cip1 induction by TGF-β.

Integration of Smad and PI3K Pathways in p21Cip1 Control

FoxO proteins are negatively regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is activated by growth and survival cytokines such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002). The product of PI3K, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP₃), activates Akt, which then phosphorylates FoxO proteins, forcing them out of the nucleus (Brunet et al., 1999). The PI3K/Akt pathway is overactive in a wide range of tumors, owing to hyperactivation of PI3K or Akt or inactivation of the PIP₃ phosphatase tumor suppressor PTEN (Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002). As Smad partners in p21Cip1 activation and cell cycle control, FoxO proteins might therefore provide a node for the antagonistic convergence of the PI3K/Akt and TGF-β/Smad pathways.

We tested the effects of IGF-1 and the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 (Vlahos et al., 1994) on the p21Cip1 response to TGF-β in HaCaT cells. As seen by indirect immunofluorescence, endogenous FoxO3 protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus and became concentrated in the nucleus upon cell treatment with LY294002 (Figure 4A) (Brunet et al., 1999). TGF-β had no discernable effect on the subcellular distribution of FoxO3 (Figure 4A). Western immunoblotting using antiphospho-Akt antibodies revealed a minimal increase in the level of phosphorylated (activated) Akt in response to IGF-1 (these cells were already stimulated by serum factors), whereas LY294002 caused a marked decrease in phospho-Akt, and TGF-β had no effect (Figure 4B and data not shown). LY294002 strongly increased the sensitivity of these cells to the cytostatic action of TGF-β (data not shown), as reported (Liang et al., 2002).

LY294002 potentiated the induction of p21Cip1 by submaximal concentrations of TGF-β (Figure 4B). In the same experiments, LY294002 did not augment the PAI-1 response, indicating that its effect on p21Cip1 is selective (Figure 4B). LY294002 potentiated the p21Cip1 response in other human cell types, including primary keratinocytes, a prostate carcinoma cell line expressing PTEN, and Pten-defective prostate carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and glioblastoma cell lines (Figure 4C).

A FoxO1 construct carrying mutations in the Akt phosphorylation sites and thus resistant to inhibition by the PI3K/Akt pathway (Nakae et al., 2001) rescued the p21Cip1 response to TGF-β and the cytostatic response in the Pten-defective glioblastoma cell line U87MG (Figure 4D). This suggests that FoxO proteins are also targets of inhibition by the PI3K/Akt pathway when acting as mediators of TGF-β action.

FoxG1 Is a FoxO Antagonist that Suppresses p21Cip1 Induction

In light of the role of FoxO factors as Smad partners in p21Cip1 induction, we investigated whether FoxO would be the long-sought target of the Forkhead family member FoxG1 (formerly Brain Factor-1, BF1). FoxG1 is a transcriptional repressor that protects neuroepithelial progenitor cells from cytostatic and differentiative signals (Hanashima et al., 2002, 2004; Xuan et al., 1995). FoxG1 expression is restricted to the neuroepithelial progenitor population that comprises the telencephalon in the developing mouse (Tao and Lai, 1992), and it is essential for forebrain formation (Hanashima et al., 2002, 2004; Xuan et al., 1995). Between embryonic day 11 (E11) and E18, an increasing fraction of neuroepithelial progenitor cells in the dorsal telencephalon stop dividing and undergo differentiation (Takahashi et al., 1993, 1996). Embryos lacking foxg1 suffer hypoplasia of the cerebral hemispheres, owing to a premature decay in telencephalic progenitor cell proliferation (Xuan et al., 1995). foxg1⁻/⁻ mouse neuroepithelial cells are hypersensitive to the cytostatic action of TGF-β (Dou et al., 2000). FoxG1 was shown to bind FoxH1 and Smads when these proteins were overexpressed in lung epithelial cell lines (Dou et al., 2000; Rodriguez et al., 2001). Physiologically, however, FoxH1 is an unlikely target of FoxG1, because these proteins are not expressed in the same cells. The mechanism of FoxG1 action and the relevance of its anti-TGF-β effects therefore have remained unknown.

To determine whether FoxG1 may function as a physiological suppressor of p21Cip1 expression, we conducted anti-p21Cip1 immunohistochemistry assays on the dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium of wild-type and foxg1 null mouse embryos at E12.5. The results revealed that the mantle zone of the medial and dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium in foxg1⁻/⁻ embryos contains a high level of p21Cip1 compared to that of foxg1⁺/⁺ littermates (Figure 5A).

Next, we investigated whether the high expression of p21Cip1 in foxg1 null telencephalon could be due to TGF-β action. TGF-β1 is expressed by the meninges overlying the dorsal telencephalon as well as by scattered cells in the ventricular zone and cortical plate (Miller, 2003). TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 are expressed by radial glia (Flanders et al., 1991; Miller, 2003), cells that appear to be the primary neuronal progenitors in the

(B) HaCaT cells were incubated for 2 hr with LY294002 or 100 ng/ml IGF-1 or left untreated, then treated with the indicated concentrations of TGF-β for 3 hr prior to Northern blotting assays or for 5 hr prior to immunoblotting assays.

dorsal telencephalon (Tamamaki et al., 2001; Noctor et al., 2002; Malatesta et al., 2003). Furthermore, activated (receptor phosphorylated) Smad2 is present in the dorsal telencephalon (de Sousa Lopes et al., 2003), a point that we confirmed by antiphospho-Smad2 immunohistochemistry (data not shown). Thus, the developing telencephalon is exposed to Smad-activating TGF-β signals. To determine if such signals can increase p21Cip1 levels when FoxG1 is absent, neuroepithelial progenitor cells were isolated from the telencephalon of E10.5 mice and treated with TGF-β (Figure 5B). At E10.5, there is no major difference yet in brain development between the wild-type and foxg1 null mice (Xuan et al., 1995). TGF-β induced the expression of p21Cip1 and inhibited cell proliferation in foxg1 null neuroepithelial cells but not in their wild-type or heterozygote counterparts (Figure 5B). Thus, loss of FoxG1 enables the induction of p21Cip1 and growth inhibition by TGF-β.

To determine how FoxG1 interferes with p21Cip1 by TGF-β, we overexpressed FoxG1 in HaCaT keratinocytes and DU145 prostate carcinoma cells. FoxG1 over-
expression selectively blocked the induction of p21Cip1 by TGF-β (Figure 5C), and it also blocked transactivation from the p21Cip1 SBR by TGF-β and FoxO proteins (Figure 5D). Another Fox family member with transcriptional repressor activities, FoxN3 (Scott and Plon, 2003), did not affect the SBR response to TGF-β (data not shown).

Evidence that FoxG1 can directly target FoxO proteins was provided by the ability to coimmunoprecipitate these proteins from transfected cells (Figure 5E) or endogenously (see Figure 6C). These interactions were independent of TGF-β addition. Using FoxO3 and FoxG1 deletion constructs, the interacting domains were mapped to the N-terminal half of FoxO3 and the C-terminal region of FoxG1 (Figure 5F and see Supplemental Figure S3 at http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/117/2/211/DC1). FoxG1 did not compete with Smad3 or Smad4 for binding to FoxO3 (Figure 5G) but rather formed a complex with these three proteins, as determined by sequential coimmunoprecipitation (see Supplemental Figure S3E). These results suggest that FoxG1 is a direct inhibitor of

FoxG1 and PI3K Mediate Glioblastoma Resistance to TGF-β Cytostasis

Given the ability of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the FoxG1 pathway to inhibit p21Cip1 induction by a TGF-β-activated Smad-FoxO complex, we asked whether these activities underlie the resistance of brain tumor cells to the cytostatic action of TGF-β. Brain tumor progression to the most aggressive stage, glioblastoma multiforme, occurs with a loss of TGF-β-mediated p21Cip1 induction and cytostasis (Jennings and Pietenpol, 1998;

Rich et al., 1999) and a gain of TGF-β-mediated PDGF production and cell proliferation (Jennings et al., 1997). Analysis of several human grade II glioma (oligodendrocytoma, astrocytoma) and glioblastoma multiforme tumor samples (Figure 6A) and glioblastoma cell lines (Figure 6B) confirmed our suspicion that many of these tumors express FoxG1. U87MG glioblastoma cells respond to TGF-β with PAI-1 induction but not p21Cip1 induction (refer to Figure 4D) and are resistant to growth inhibition (Figure 6F). Using U87MG cells as a model system, we verified that the endogenous FoxG1 and FoxO3 proteins are in a complex (Figure 6C). Additionally, U87MG cells have a hyperactive PI3K pathway, owing to the loss of Pten function (Li et al., 1997), which

(C) Anti-FoxO3 and control (IgG) immunoprecipitates from U87MG cells were subjected to anti-FoxG1 immunoblotting. (D) Subconfluent or (E) confluent U87MG cell cultures were transfected with foxg1 siRNA or with a control siRNA. After 48 hr, cells were serum starved for 16 hr and incubated with LY294002 or DMSO for 2 hr and then with TGF-β for 3 hr or the indicated times. Samples were subjected to Northern blot or protein immunoblot assays. (F) Subconfluent U87MG cells transfected with foxg1 siRNA or mock transfected were incubated for 20 hr with 2 μM LY294002 and either anti-TGF-β antibody or the indicated concentrations of TGF-β. ¹²⁵I-BrdU incorporation was determined.

is characteristic of many glioblastomas (Holland, 2001; Zhu and Parada, 2002). TGF-β induced p21Cip1 expression and growth inhibition when U87MG cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor (Figures 4C and 6D). To investigate the involvement of FoxG1, we treated these cells with foxg1 siRNA. Individually, and more so when combined, foxg1 siRNA and LY294002 rescued a strong p21Cip1 response to TGF-β (Figure 6D). The strength of this response varied depending on culture conditions, being strongest in confluent cell monolayers (Figure 6E). This p21Cip1 induction was accompanied by a rescue of TGF-β growth inhibitory effect (Figure 6F). Addition of anti-TGF-β blocking antibodies to the media showed that autocrine TGF-β may stimulate U87MG cell proliferation under basal conditions but suppresses proliferation in the presence of foxg1 siRNA and PI3K inhibitors (Figure 6F). Collectively, these results suggest that FoxG1 and a hyperactive PI3K pathway cooperate to block p21Cip1 induction and cytostasis by the TGF-β pathway in these human glioblastoma cells.

Discussion

Transcriptional induction of p21Cip1 is central to the TGF-β cytostatic program and is under tight control

Figure 7. Model of FoxO Factors as a Node for Integration of TGF-β/Smad, PI3K/Akt, and FoxG1 Pathways

TGF-β receptor activation leads to Smad3 phosphorylation (P) and assembly of a Smad3-Smad4 complex in the nucleus. This complex associates with FoxO proteins to target the p21Cip1 promoter for activation. IGF-1-like proliferative signals activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, which phosphorylates FoxO, leading to their exclusion from the nucleus (Brunet et al., 1999) and preventing Smad-FoxO-dependent gene activation. Expressed as part of a neural progenitor proliferation program, FoxG1 binds to the FoxO-Smad complex, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Thus, three countervailing pathways converge on FoxO to tightly regulate the expression of p21Cip1 and cell proliferation.

15 out of a total of 118 TGF-β early gene activation responses in HaCaT cells. Thus, the results suggest that FoxO mediates a small subset of TGF-β gene responses, including p21Cip1 activation.

TGF-β stimulates the binding of FoxO and Smad proteins to the p21Cip1 promoter while relieving it from c-Myc-mediated inhibition. The FoxO-Smad binding region defined here, the SBR, is separate from the c-Myc-Miz binding region. c-Myc does not interfere with Smad binding or transactivation when the SBR is isolated from the natural promoter. c-Myc downregulation alone does not suffice for p21Cip1 activation, arguing that the FoxO-Smad complex mediates p21Cip1 transactivation once repression by c-Myc is removed. In this regard, the FoxO-Smad complex acts similarly to p53 activated by DNA damage (Seoane et al., 2002).

FoxO proteins might act as signal transducers in other pathways as well. Although FoxO proteins can bind to the FHBE in vitro without other participating factors (Brunet et al., 1999), their binding to the p21Cip1 FHBE in vivo is dependent on TGF-β stimulation and involves Smad proteins. The same or a very similar FHBE is present in many actual or predicted FoxO target genes (Furuyama et al., 2000; Samatar et al., 2002). FoxO binding to other target promoters may also require the participation of signal-regulated factors, much like FoxO binding to the p21Cip1 promoter requires TGF-β-activated Smads.

Another Forkhead family member, FoxH1, serves as a Smad partner in the activation of Mix.2 (Chen et al., 1996), goosecoid (Labbé et al., 1998), and other genes (Watanabe and Whitman, 1999; Hoodless et al., 2001) during mesoderm formation in vertebrates. However, FoxH1 and FoxO act differently as Smad partners. FoxH1 is a partner of Smad2 (Chen et al., 1996), and the binding is via their C-terminal domains (Chen et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1997). In contrast, FoxO proteins act as partners of Smad3 (and Smad4) via the FoxO and Smad N-terminal domains.

(Figure 7). The involvement of FoxO factors in the TGF-β pathway is inhibited by the PI3K/Akt and FoxG1 pathways, each acting by a distinct mechanism. Akt is known to phosphorylate FoxO proteins and induce their exclusion from the nucleus (Brunet et al., 1999). We provide evidence that FoxO proteins are also targets of inhibition by the PI3K/Akt pathway when acting as mediators of TGF-β action. FoxG1, on the other hand, binds to the FoxO-Smad complex, blocking its ability to activate p21Cip1. FoxG1 can recruit corepressors (Tan et al., 2003; Yao et al., 2001), so its presence may turn a FoxO-Smad into a repressor complex.

Inhibition of the p21Cip1 transcriptional response to TGF-β is one of several actions by which the PI3K/Akt pathway protects the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. Akt may also phosphorylate p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 and force these Cdk inhibitors out of the nucleus (Li et al., 2002; Liang et al., 2002; Shin et al., 2002; Viglietto et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2001). The Ras/MAPK pathway downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases also interferes with TGF-β signaling, but in this case, Smads are the direct targets (Massagué, 2003). Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO proteins provides a more selective node for the integration of mitogenic signals and TGF-β cytostatic signals. Based on genetic evidence, it was proposed that TGF-β signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans affects the PI3K pathway upstream of the FoxO ortholog and longevity regulator daf-16 (Lee et al., 2001). In human keratinocytes and glioblastoma cells studied here, however, TGF-β does not alter the level of phospho-Akt or the subcellular localization of FoxO.

Evasion of Cytostasis in Neuroepithelial Development and Glioblastoma Progression

We provide evidence for the involvement of the Smad/PI3K/FoxG1 node in the evasion of TGF-β cytostatic effects in telencephalic neuroepithelial progenitors and in glioblastoma cells. FoxG1 is essential for forebrain formation, because it protects neuroepithelial progenitor cells from premature growth arrest and differentiation (Hanashima et al., 2004, 2002; Xuan et al., 1995). TGF-β expression (Flanders et al., 1991; Miller, 2003)

FoxO as a Node for Integration of Three Pathways

FoxO factors are shown to act as a nodal point for the integration of the Smad, PI3K, and FoxG1 pathways

and Smad activation (de Sousa Lopes et al., 2003) are present in the dorsal telencephalon at E12.5. At this stage, *foxg1* null mice suffer a sharp decline in telencephalic growth (Xuan et al., 1995). We show here that the underdeveloped telencephalic neuroepithelium of these mice contains a high level of p21Cip1, compared to the neuroepithelium of wild-type littermates. Moreover, neuroepithelial progenitor cells from *foxg1* null mice but not their heterozygous counterparts respond to TGF-β with p21Cip1 induction and growth arrest. We suggest that during the development of the telencephalon, FoxG1 prevents endogenous TGF-β signals from triggering p21Cip1 expression and cytostasis in the neuroepithelium.

Selective pressure against TGF-β cytostatic responses is strong during tumor progression (Derynck et al., 2001; Dumont and Arteaga, 2003; Massagué et al., 2000; Wakefield and Roberts, 2002). Mutational inactivation of TGF-β receptors or Smad4 occurs in a significant proportion of pancreatic and gastrointestinal cancers, but it is relatively rare in other cancers. More commonly, tumor cells selectively lose cytostatic responsiveness while retaining a functional TGF-β receptor and Smad system. The molecular basis for this selective loss is unknown in most instances. With the cytostatic action disabled, TGF-β may go on to stimulate proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. Glioblastomas go through such a transition by suffering a selective loss of cytostatic responsiveness while still producing autocrine PDGF in response to TGF-β (Jennings et al., 1997; Jennings and Pietenpol, 1998; Rich, 2003). Glioblastoma tumor formation is driven by a combination of hyperactive PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways together with frequent inactivation of *Pten* and *Ink4-Arf* tumor suppressor genes (Holland, 2001; Zhu and Parada, 2002). Here, we have shown that a hyperactive PI3K/Akt pathway and high levels of FoxG1 in glioblastoma cells cooperate to prevent p21Cip1 induction and cytostasis by the TGF-β/Smad-FoxO pathway. By attenuating PI3K and FoxG1 functions, we have been able to restore TGF-β cytostatic action to glioblastoma cells. These observations lend support to the idea of therapeutically targeting the PI3K pathway (Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002) and FoxG1 in glioblastoma, one of the most devastating human malignancies.

### Experimental Procedures

#### Cell Lines
Cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary keratinocytes were purchased from Cambrex and maintained in the manufacturer’s medium. PC3 cells were maintained in F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. BT549 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and insulin 0.02IU. The HaCaT-tetMyc cell line has been described (Seoane et al., 2002).

#### Isolation and Culture of Primary Neuroepithelial Cells
Telencephalic neuroepithelial cells were isolated from E10.5 C57BL6 mouse as previously described (Dou et al., 2000). Embryos from *foxg1*<sup>+/−</sup> × *foxg1*<sup>+/−</sup> heterozygote matings were dissected in ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution. The epidermis of the head was removed, and the neuroepithelium of the telencephalon was dissected. The isolated neuroepithelium was dissociated into a cell suspension by repeated pipetting in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated on poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated dishes with DMEM-F12 media containing 1% FBS and 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 2. TGF-β (100 pM) was added as indicated.

#### Transfections and Infections
DU145 cells were transfected with pCMV-GFP and Flag-FoxG1 as indicated. HaCaT cells were transfected with pIRE2-EGFP or pFoxG1-IRE-GFP, and GFP positive cells were sorted on a Vantage cell sorter before analysis. Cos-1 and DU-145 cell transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Adenovirus Ad-dnFoxO1(FoxO1Δ256), Ad-FoxO1ADA, and Ad-GFP were amplified and titrated. Cells were grown to 70% confluence and infected with recombinant adenovirus at a MOI of 20 for 3 hr. Twenty-four hours after the infection, cells were treated as described.

#### Immunoprecipitation and Oligonucleotide Precipitation Assays
Assays were performed as previously described (Seoane et al., 2001) in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 10 mM NaF, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.05% NP-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail).

#### Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
Whole-cell extracts from HaCaT or COS-1 cells were prepared by lysing the cells in a Triton X-100-containing buffer (Pagès et al., 1994). Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the p21SBR and its mutants were annealed and end labeled with γ<sup>32</sup>P-ATP. The binding reactions were performed and analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing gel (Brunet et al., 1999). For supershift studies, 1 μl of antibody against Smad2/3, Smad4, FoxO1, FoxO3, or FoxO4 was preincubated for 5 min on ice with the cell extract. DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography.

#### Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Cells were grown to 70% confluence, treated with TGF-β for 60 min, and then crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. ChIP assays were performed as previously described (Shang et al., 2000).

#### In Vitro Protein Binding Assay
Bacterially-expressed Smad domain and FoxO domain GST-fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using Glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology). Recombinant His-tagged full-length FoxO3 was purified with Ni-NTA Agarose Beads (Qiagen). GST-fusion protein (15 μg) was incubated with either 15 μg or 45 μg of His-tagged FoxO3 in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40, 0.2 mg/ml BSA) for 3 hr at 4°C. GST-fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione sepharose beads, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-His antibody.

#### Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence
E12.5 embryos were fixed and embedded in paraffin as described (Xuan et al., 1995). Immunohistochemical detection was performed with an automated Discovery Staining Module (Ventana Medical systems, Tucson, AZ) using an anti-p21 antibody (F-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, 10 mg/ml) and hematoxilin counterstaining. Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out with anti-FoxO3 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch).

#### Small Interfering RNA
siRNA duplexes targeting *foxg1* were purchased from Dharmacon Research. The coding strand of the siRNA was UCUGUCCCUCACAAAGUGCGdTdT. U87MG cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and used 48 hr after transfection. FoxO3 was targeted with pSUPERFoxO3 kindly provided by A. Brunet (Harvard Medical School). pSUPERFoxO3 or pSUPER-scrambled that contains an unrelated sequence was transfected into U87MG cells using Lipofectamine2000. Forty hours after transfection, cells were lysed and processed for Northern blotting.
