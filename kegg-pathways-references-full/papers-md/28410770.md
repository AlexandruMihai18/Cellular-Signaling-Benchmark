Calcium and senescence

ABSTRACT

Cellular senescence is a stable cell proliferation arrest induced by a variety of stresses including telomere shortening, oncogene activation and oxidative stress. This process plays a crucial role in many physiopathological contexts, especially during aging when cellular senescence favors development of age-related diseases, shortening lifespan. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling senescence are still a matter of active research. In the last decade, there has been emerging literature indicating a key involvement of calcium signaling in cellular senescence. In this review we will initially give an account of the direct evidence linking calcium and the regulation of senescence. We will then review our current knowledge on the role of calcium in some senescence-associated features and physiopathological conditions, which will shed light on additional ways in which calcium signaling is implicated in cellular senescence.

1. Definition of cellular senescence  

Cellular senescence was originally described five decades ago as the proliferation arrest that accompanies the exhaustion of replicative potential in primary human fibroblasts after extended culture *in vitro*. Telomere attrition is the main trigger of this so-called replicative senescence. However, a number of other stimuli such as oncogenic signals, oxidative stress and

genotoxic agents can also induce a senescent phenotype, known as premature senescence. Cellular senescence is thus generally defined as a cellular response to stresses. Although originally observed in primary human fibroblasts, cellular senescence has now been observed in most human cell types and in many species [1-4].

The two main features of senescent cells are their stable cell cycle arrest and their distinct, often pro-inflammatory, secretome or senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). P53 and RB (retinoblastoma) are master regulators of senescence implementing the stable cell cycle arrest. Upon stresses, p53 is activated and induces the expression of genes such as CDKN1A encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. P21 and p16 (CDKN2A), another inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, then inhibit the phosphorylation of RB. RB consequently represses the expression of pro-proliferative genes such as E2F target genes promoting the cell cycle G1-S transition (Figure 1) [5; 6].

The SASP comprises many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, various growth factors and proteases. This secretome is regulated both at the transcriptional level, the expression of numerous SASP components being induced by transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBP-β), and at the translational level by pathways such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The SASP displays autocrine activities reinforcing senescence as well as several paracrine activities, sometime having opposite effects: activating the immune system, spreading senescence and/or promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration and invasion in neighboring cells (Figure 1) [7-14].

Besides these two main features, senescent cells acquire other characteristics. They undergo changes in their morphology, which often become flat and enlarged. They exhibit senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, which is experimentally used as a marker of senescence. They display increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which could result

Calcium and senescence

from altered mitochondrial activity and lead to DNA damage. They may also accumulate unrepaired DNA damages, which activate the ATM/ATR-p53-p21-RB DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, as well as senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) repressing proliferative E2F targets, both participating in the implementation of cell cycle arrest (Figure 1) [1;2;5;6].

Calcium critically controls many molecular processes and cellular functions and there is accumulating evidence indicating that calcium signaling plays a key role in cellular senescence. We will present the current knowledge on its implication in senescence, as well as in the main senescence-associated features and in some physiopathological contexts in which senescence is involved.

2. Direct evidence of the role of calcium in senescence

2.1. Increase in intracellular calcium levels in senescent cells

An elevation of intracellular calcium levels has been observed in response to different types of senescence-inducing stresses (telomere shortening, oncogene activation, rotenone or oxidative stress) and in several cell types. This increase in calcium concentration has been attributed to calcium influx through plasma membrane calcium channels or to calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depending on the context. Indeed, it has been shown that isradipine, a CaV1.3 L-type channel antagonist, prevents the rise in rotenone-induced calcium that accelerates senescence in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells [15]. In human mammary epithelial cells and primary human fibroblasts, oncogene activation and telomere shortening trigger calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum stores, through the activation of the PLC/IP3/IP3R pathway [16]. In H₂O₂-induced senescence in human endometrium-derived stem cells, this IP3R-mediated calcium release from the ER causes the rapid increase in cytosolic calcium concentration [17]. Treatment with uridine triphosphate or thapsigargin, which deplete the

Calcium and senescence

ER calcium store, significantly impaired the rise H₂O₂-induced intracellular calcium. High concentrations of intracellular calcium are sustained during senescence. Chelation of this calcium with BAPTA [17] or knockdown of the ER calcium release channels IP3R [16] foster escape from senescence, demonstrating that elevation of intracellular calcium levels triggers cellular senescence.

Interestingly, several oncogenes and tumor suppressors regulating cellular senescence physically interact with IP3Rs and, by modulating the activity of these channels, exploit calcium signaling [18]. For example, it has been shown that IP3R3 is targeted by PKB/AKT pro-survival serine/threonine kinase [19]. This oncogene inhibits IP3R3-mediated ER calcium release by phosphorylating this channel [20]. The tumor suppressor PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein), a well-known senescence inducer [21], forms a complex with IP3R3 and PKB/AKT and recruits the PP2A phosphatase to counteract PKB/AKT-induced IP3R3 phosphorylation and inhibition. The resulting increase in ER calcium release is instrumental in PML-induced apoptosis [22]. It can be hypothesized that it may also be involved in PML-induced senescence.

### 2.2. Calcium-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production in senescence

Calcium released from the ER in response to senescence-inducing stresses mainly exerts its effects through reactive oxygen species (ROS). It has been shown upon oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) in mammary epithelial cells and upon replicative senescence in primary human fibroblasts that calcium release from the ER is followed by its accumulation in the mitochondria. The increase in mitochondrial calcium concentration leads to a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential and in the enhanced production of ROS, which triggers senescence. Knockdown of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCU fosters escape from senescence [16]. The ER and mitochondria can be spatially and functionally coupled through mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) which favor the transfer of calcium from the ER to mitochondria [23]. A role for these structures in the regulation of cellular senescence can be speculated but remains to be

assessed.

### 2.3. SASP regulation by calcium

The observed rise in intracellular calcium in response to senescence-inducing signals regulates the SASP through interleukin 1α (IL1α), a pro-inflammatory cytokine which acts as a key SASP initiator [24]. IL1α is synthesized as a precursor and then processed by the calcium-activated protease calpain. In senescent cells, the rise in intracellular levels of calcium, which is the co-factor of calpain, activates this protease. This leads to increased IL1α proteolytic cleavage and enhanced expression of downstream SASP cytokines, such as IL6 and IL8.

### 2.4. Role of the calcium/NFAT signaling pathway in senescence

The calcium-dependent transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) is activated through the calcium/calmodulin/calcineurin pathway [25]. Upon cytosolic calcium increase, calmodulin, a calcium sensor protein, binds to calcium and activates calcineurin. This phosphatase triggers NFAT dephosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of its target genes [26]. Several studies have shown that NFAT plays a crucial role in cellular senescence. Indeed, the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway is critically required for p53-dependent senescence in skin [27]. NFATc1 directly represses the expression of ATF3, a transcription factor related to the AP-1 family which inhibits the expression of p53 and other senescence-associated genes. Impairment of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway suppresses p53-dependent senescence and promotes tumor formation of H-RAS<sup>V12</sup>-expressing primary human keratinocytes or keratinocyte-derived squamous cell carcinoma cells. However, it has also been shown that NFATc1 activation in prostate epithelium promotes prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate adenocarcinoma [28]. Moreover, NFATc1 accelerates PTEN null-driven prostate tumorigenesis. NFATc1 overcomes PTEN loss-induced cellular senescence by downregulating the cell cycle inhibitor p21 [28]. Altogether, it seems that the calcineurin/NFAT

pathway displays senescence-promoting or -suppressing functions depending on the cell type and context. Interestingly, NFATc1 has also been described to activate the expression of the ER calcium release channel IP3R2, which could be an additional way for the calcineurin/NFAT pathway to impact senescence [29]. Of course, calcium/calmodulin/calcineurin/NFAT pathway can also exert effects independently of its effect on cellular senescence, such as promoting T cell clonal expansion [30].

In addition to these reports which clearly demonstrate a direct role for calcium signaling in cellular senescence (Figure 2), there is extensive literature on the involvement of calcium in features associated with senescence. The main implications of calcium in this context will be reviewed in the next section.

## 3. Other roles for calcium in the main senescence-associated features

### 3.1. Cell proliferation

One of the two functionally crucial features of senescent cells is their state of stable proliferation arrest. Cell proliferation is directly linked to cell cycle progression. Calcium signaling plays a key role throughout the mammalian cell cycle. Intracellular calcium concentration is modulated during the G1 phase, G1/S transition and mitosis [31]. Calcium is important in early G1 for the expression of genes such as FOS, JUN and MYC and later for RB phosphorylation. Antagonists of calmodulin trigger cell cycle arrest in G1 [32]. Calmodulin kinase (CaMK) and calcineurin, downstream targets of calmodulin, are required for cyclin D1 expression [33; 34]. The calcium/calmodulin pathway regulates several transcription factors such as NFAT or the cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) which target genes that control cell cycle progression from G1 to S. Direct upregulation of MYC expression by calcineurin-activated NFATc1 induces an increase in the expression of MYC target genes, cyclin E and E2F [35]. CREB undergoes calcium-induced phosphorylation by CAMK2 and 4. Once phosphorylated CREB binds to the cAMP

response element (CRE) on the promoter of target genes, such as cyclin D1, and recruits co-
activators, including the histone acetyl-transferases CBP and p300 which activate gene
transcription [36]. CDK2 activity is also increased by calcineurin. In addition, the
calcium/calmodulin pathway promotes RB phosphorylation by enhancing p34 Cdc2 kinase
(CDK1) activation [37]. P53, similarly to RB, may also be regulated by calcium. P53 was shown to
bind to several members of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins in a calcium-dependent
manner. These interactions can regulate the stability and transcriptional activity of p53. For
instance, S100B binds to p53 in melanoma, reduces p53 protein levels and thus represses the
function of p53 [38]. The interaction between p53 and some calcium-binding proteins may thus
influence cell cycle progression. However, a comprehensive analysis of the direct impact of
calcium on the two key master regulators of cellular senescence p53 and RB in primary cells is
currently lacking. During mitosis, a rise in cytosolic calcium at the onset of anaphase, just
preceding nuclear envelope breakdown, has been observed in cultured mammalian fibroblasts
and epithelial cells as well as in embryos [39-41]. Mimicking this cytosolic calcium increase by
artificially injecting calcium into the embryo causes early nuclear envelope breakdown, whereas
chelating it prevents this breakdown and suspends mitosis [40]. In addition, defects in calcium-
and CAMK2-mediated control of centrosome duplication (in G1/S) and separation (in G2/M) result
in aberrant mitotic spindles, genetic instability and aneuploidy [42; 43]. Modulation of cytosolic
calcium concentration is therefore a crucial regulatory step for cell cycle progression. Calcium
signaling is not only pivotal for cell cycle progression but more generally for the survival and proper
functioning of cells. For example, calcium is required for energy production and acts at several
levels in the mitochondria to stimulate ATP synthesis. In addition, calcium controls many other
aspects of cellular metabolism [44]. In conclusion, calcium is required for cell cycle progression,
proliferation and survival.

Calcium and senescence

These latter observations appear to be contradictory with the pro-senescence effect of calcium described in section 2. We can speculate that a spatio-temporal elevation of calcium concentration might switch the effect of calcium from a pro-proliferative/survival effect to a cytostatic/toxic effect. Beyond the literature presented in section 2, showing an involvement of calcium in senescence, a rapid rise in mitochondrial calcium levels precedes cell death and contributes to its induction [45; 46]. Changes in calcium homeostasis may therefore drive cells to enter either senescence or cell death, probably depending on the characteristics of the spatio-temporal elevation of calcium concentrations (site and level of accumulation as well as kinetic and duration of the increase).

Still in some circumstances increased calcium might not exert cytostatic/toxic effects if the effector pathways like p53, RB or caspases are not functional. It is tempting to speculate that it is what happens in cancer cells, where these pathways are altered and increased calcium reported. Then in these specific conditions increased calcium might promote survival, proliferation, migration and invasion phenotypes (Figure 3) [47-49].

### 3.2. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype

Beside the cell proliferation arrest, the other functionally crucial feature of senescent cells is their distinct pro-inflammatory secretome (SASP). The SASP is regulated at the transcriptional level by the NFκB pathway, which induces the expression of SASP components such as IL6 and IL8 pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of the NFκB pathway depends on intracellular free calcium under certain circumstances. Activation of calmodulin has been shown to inhibit c-REL and allow RELA to translocate into the nucleus [50-52].

The SASP is also induced at the translational level by the mTOR pathway. It has recently been demonstrated that mTORC1 activation requires lysosomal calcium release through the calcium channel TRPML1. Lysosomal calcium activates mTORC1 through calmodulin, which

Calcium and senescence

associates with mTORC1 and stimulates its kinase activity [53]. Calcium and calmodulin have also been shown to promote the secretion of IL1β, another component of the SASP. Calmodulin binds to IL1β precursors and IL1β-processing and -release depends on this calcium-mediated interaction [54].

For the sake of clarity we have only discussed the role of calcium signaling on cell proliferation and SASP, the two main hallmarks of senescent cells explaining its role in various physiopathological responses. However, calcium signaling plays a key role in many other senescence-associated features such as DNA damage response and autophagy, suggesting that calcium may also impact senescence in many additional ways than the ones we focused on.

4. Role of calcium in senescence-associated physiopathological conditions

4.1. Role of cellular senescence in vivo

Senescent cells accumulate with age and contribute to age-related diseases and organismal aging. Although a matter of debate for many years, this role for senescence has definitely been demonstrated the last few years by the evidence that elimination of senescent cells during accelerated or normal aging extends lifespan and improves numerous age-associated pathologies such as atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, glomerulosclerosis, cardiac aging, lung degenerative diseases, cancer relapse and progression, as well as immunosenescence [8; 55-61].

Senescent cells are also observed in the organism at various stages of life during which senescence can have beneficial health effects. Cellular senescence is activated during normal embryonic development, where it contributes to embryonic growth and patterning [62; 63]. It is also involved in various responses, from promoting wound healing [64] to increasing insulin secretion [65]. In the context of tumor initiation, cellular senescence is a major failsafe program that is activated upon oncogenic stresses, short telomeres and mutagenic signals, to eliminate cells at risk of transformation. In benign preneoplastic lesions, oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) limits

the proliferation of these cells and triggers their clearance by the immune system. OIS is therefore
a potent protective barrier in the initial steps of tumorigenesis [9; 66; 67].

Altogether age-related chronic senescence is thought to exert detrimental effects on
health, whereas timely-regulated senescence is thought to exert beneficial effects (Figure 4)
[57; 68; 69].

### 4.2. Implication of calcium in some physiopathological responses controlled by
senescence

Calcium plays a pivotal role in several physiopathological contexts in which senescence is
involved, suggesting a functional link between calcium and senescence *in vivo*. Cellular
senescence is critically implicated in wound healing. Appearance of senescent fibroblasts and
endothelial cells is observed soon after skin wounding. These cells accelerate wound closure by
triggering myofibroblast differentiation through the secretion of platelet-derived growth factor AA
(PDGF-AA) [64]. Calcium is an essential regulator of wound responses [70]. Epithelial wounds
trigger intercellular calcium waves which propagate through the wounded epithelium. Wounds
induce an elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels through the opening of plasma membrane
channels such as TRPs or through calcium release from intracellular stores. This increase in
intracellular calcium concentrations induces ROS production by activating the epithelial NADPH-
oxidase DUOX or by triggering mitochondrial permeability transition. Calcium also guides the
secretion of paracrine mediators and is required for epithelial sheet motility and integrity. In
addition to their coordinated role during wound healing, migration and invasion contribute to tumor
progression. Senescent cells owing to their SASP have been proposed to favor cell migration and
invasion of neighboring tissues [8]. In particular, senescent fibroblasts in the tumor stroma
promote, through their SASP, cancer cell migration [71-73]. Calcium directly controls the cell
migration process, by impacting cytoskeleton organization as well as signaling pathways [47].

Calcium and senescence

Altogether, this suggests that calcium can promote cell migration and contribute to the pro-
migratory effect of the SASP, thus impacting neighboring cells.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic lung disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Levels of senescence markers such as p16, phospho-histone H2A.X (γH2A.X) and phospho-
checkpoint 2 kinase (phospho-Chk2) are increased in this pathology [74]. An upregulation of intracellular calcium concentration and a calcium-dependent activation of the NFκB pathway, which is a key SASP regulator, are also observed in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells [75]. These findings suggest that senescence could be implicated in this disease and that calcium could regulate senescence in this context.

It has been shown that p16-induced senescence in pancreatic β cells enhances insulin secretion, partly through mTOR and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) [65]. β cell-specific deletion of the calcineurin regulatory subunit calcineurin b1 provokes age-
dependent diabetes in mice due to decreased β cell proliferation, decreased pancreatic insulin content and hypoinsulinaemia. Consistently, conditional NFAT activation in normal adult β cells increases their proliferation and mass, provoking hyperinsulinemia, and induces the expression of genes which are critical for the endocrine function of β cells [76]. Thus, calcium signaling and β-
cell senescence promotes insulin secretion.

Even though senescence appears to promote β-cell insulin secretion, senescence in insulin sensitive organs might render them insulin resistant. Indeed, high fat diets and obesity, which are known to result in insulin resistance, promote senescence of adipocytes and hepatocytes, two cell types responding to insulin to metabolize circulating glucose. Decreasing senescence by depleting p53 restores the response to insulin, demonstrating that in that given context senescence provokes insulin resistance [60; 77]. Accumulation of mitochondrial calcium is observed during obesity and has been shown to promote insulin resistance [78], as does

accumulation of senescent cells, once again supporting a functional link between calcium, and in particular mitochondrial calcium, and senescence. However, the role of calcium is not that simple as cytosolic calcium can both decrease or increase insulin sensitivity [79; 80]. We can speculate that the effect of calcium on insulin sensitivity depends on its spatio-temporal regulation and then on its ability to induce or not senescence as previously discussed.

Together, calcium might exert some of its effects on health and diseases through its ability to control cellular senescence.

5. Concluding remarks

Cellular senescence is a cellular response to a wide variety of stresses that plays a key role in development, aging and diseases. Identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling this process is currently a key challenge to improve our understanding of these physiopathological conditions and be able to envision ways to impact them. In the last decade the concept that calcium signaling is a key regulator of cellular senescence has emerged. Thus, calcium signaling appears to be an important effector of cellular senescence.

However, it is very likely that our current knowledge is only the tip of the iceberg and that many more implications of calcium signaling in cellular senescence will be discovered in the near future. To date only a few members of the calcium signaling pathway have been identified as senescence regulators. Calcium signaling implicates many players and signaling cascades. According to the KEGG pathway database, 180 proteins participate in the calcium signaling pathway. It includes a large variety of proteins, among which numerous calcium channels from diverse families and calcium-binding proteins. Assessing the involvement of each of these factors in cellular senescence would improve our understanding of the role of calcium signaling in this process. To this end, regulation of their expression and activity as well as their functional impact on senescence should be investigated.

Calcium and senescence

With regards to a more applied perspective, dissecting the role of players of the calcium signaling pathway in senescence may reveal targets of interest for medical purposes. This could allow the identification of new early diagnostic markers and shed light on innovative therapeutic strategies. Indeed, impacting senescence can be beneficial in some physiopathological contexts such as aging and aging-related diseases. A possible avenue for modulating senescence could be to manipulate calcium levels or calcium signaling. In this context calcium channels would be good druggable candidates to target.

FIGURE;1; LEGENDS

Figure 1. Main molecular basis of cellular senescence. A wide variety of stresses activate effector pathways implementing cellular senescence. Note that only the main and best characterized effectors are depicted here and that these pathways intricately interplay. Their activation leads to the establishment of senescence features, among which the cell cycle arrest and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) are the main features causing physiopathological effects.

Figure 2. Known roles of calcium in cellular senescence. In response to senescence-inducing stresses, intracellular calcium levels increase and promote senescence through several calcium-dependent mechanisms triggering cell cycle arrest and SASP production. Only direct roles of calcium in senescence are depicted here.

Figure 3. Dual effects of calcium on cellular life. Calcium has pleiotropic effects on cellular life depending on its intracellular levels, the regulation of these levels, and the status of the cells.

Figure 4. Dual effects of cellular senescence on organismal health. Based on its dual effects, cellular senescence has been proposed to be an example of antagonistic pleiotropy.
