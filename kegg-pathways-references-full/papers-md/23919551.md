# A review of ceramide analogs as potential anticancer agents

Ceramide serves as a central mediator in sphingolipid metabolism and signaling pathways, regulating many fundamental cellular responses. It is referred to as a ‘tumor suppressor lipid’, since it powerfully potentiates signaling events that drive apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and autophagic responses. In the typical cancer cell, ceramide levels and signaling are usually suppressed by overexpression of ceramide-metabolizing enzymes or downregulation of ceramide-generating enzymes. However, chemotherapeutic drugs as well as radiotherapy increase intracellular ceramide levels, while exogenously treating cancer cells with short-chain ceramides leads to anticancer effects. All evidence currently points to the fact that the upregulation of ceramide levels is a promising anticancer strategy. In this review, we exhibit many anticancer ceramide analogs as downstream receptor agonists and ceramide-metabolizing enzyme inhibitors.

## Anticancer targets in the ceramide signaling pathway

- **Ceramide signaling pathway**

There are two major pathways known to trigger the generation of ceramide. In the SMase pathway, hydrolysis of plasma membrane sphingomyelin or lysosomal sphingomyelin by SMases produces ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Exposure of cells to stress factors, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative and nitrosative stress, UV- and γ-irradiation, or chemotherapeutic agents has been reported to rapidly activate SMase activity, resulting in increased ceramide formation [1].

The *de novo* synthesis of ceramide begins with the condensation of palmitate and serine by serine palmitoyltransferase to yield 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine, which is, in turn, reduced to dihydrosphingosine and acylated by dihydroceramide synthase to produce dihydroceramide. Finally, desaturation of dihydroceramide by dihydroceramide desaturase generates ceramide. The *de novo* synthesis of ceramide occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the newly formed ceramide does not enter cytosol immediately. On the contrary, it is subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus by either vesicular trafficking or the ceramide transfer protein CERT. Once in the Golgi, ceramide is converted to sphingomyelin by sphingomyelin synthase on the luminal side of the Golgi, or to glucosylceramide (GluCer) by GCS on the cytosolic surface of the Golgi, and in turn to the complex glycosphingolipids [2]. The *de novo* formation of ceramide can be induced by several

- **Ceramide & apoptosis**

Whether through endogenous elevation of ceramide level or exogenous treatment with cell-permeable short-chain ceramides, a series of biological effects, denoted as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, differentiation and autophagy, can be triggered.

In the past two decades, numerous studies have focused on the ceramide-induced apoptosis pathway in the fields of physiology, biochemistry, pathophysiology and pharmacology. A classic mitochondria-dependent apoptosis can be triggered by endogenous and exogenous ceramide signaling. An immediate downstream target of ceramide is known to be CAPPs, such as PP2A. The effect of ceramide on CAPPs leads to inactivation of an anti-apoptotic kinase, AKT (a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase), through protein dephosphorylation [5]. Activation of PKCζ by ceramide has been implicated in the regulation of membrane potential, inhibition of AKT and pro-apoptotic functions [6,7]. JNK and p38 can also be activated by ceramide through ASK1. JNK and p38 increase the level of BAX, a pro-apoptotic protein in mitochondrial pathway, while p38 also contributes to the

inactivation of AKT. Thus, the downgrading of  
AKT by several signals (PP2A, PKCζ and p38)  
decreases the phosphorylation of BCL-2. At the  
same time, PP2A’s catalytic subunit (PP2Ac)  
also inhibits BCL-2 phosphorylation, leading  
to increased p53/BCL-2 binding. Finally,  
downgraded BCL-2 levels and a suppressed  
BCL-2/BAX ratio results in intrinsic apoptosis  
[8]. Cathepsin D is considered as a specific target  
for lysosomally generated ceramide, and is  
involved in both mitochondria-dependent and  
-independent apoptosis pathways [9]. Therefore,  
ceramide analogs can act on the ceramide  
downstream targets, imitating ceramide-like  
apoptosis.

The permeability of mitochondria is the critical  
factor inducing the release of apoptotic proteins,  
such as cytochrome c, in turn leading to  
apoptosis. Ceramide can directly induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization,

which is a key event in apoptotic signaling,  
through the formation of ceramide channels.  
This mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization process is concomitant with and promoted by pro-apoptotic BAX translocation to  
mitochondria [10,11]. This is why a group of positively charged ceramide analogs was developed  
to target ceramide-induced apoptosis [12,13].

■ Ceramide metabolism & cancer  
In vitro assays have demonstrated that a short-chain ceramide molecule, C6-ceramide, modestly  
activates the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac),  
an immediate ceramide downstream target. In  
contrast, the 4–5 double-bond saturated analog, C6-dihydroceramide (C6-dhCer), inhibits PP2Ac. Further studies demonstrated the strict structural requirements for interaction of ceramide with PP2A (an amide group, a primary hydroxyl group and a secondary hydroxyl group)

[14]. However, many ceramide analogs that do not activate or even inhibit PP2A, do exhibit apoptotic activity in cancer cells (such as D-e-MAPP and 3-keto-C6-ceramide) [15,16]. Thus, other agents inducing apoptosis in ceramide signaling pathways are expected to exist.

Multiple enzymes are directly involved in regulating intracellular ceramide concentrations. These include ceramide-generating enzymes, such as ceramide synthase, cerebrosidase, SMase, and ceramide-metabolizing enzymes, such as CDase, GCS, SMS and CerK. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis or ceramide degradation gives rise to an elevation of endogenous ceramide level. Among these enzymes, CDase and GCS play important roles in regulating ceramide levels.

### CDase

CDase hydrolyzes the amide bond of ceramide-producing sphingosine (Sph) and a fatty acid. According to their optimum activity pH, CDases are classified into acid [17], neutral [18,19] and alkaline CDases [20]. They modulate the intracellular ceramide levels, especially regulating the lysosomal pool of ceramide (by acid CDases). A large amount of evidence supports the notion that CDase inhibitors serve as potential ceramide-increasing agents useful for cancer chemotherapy. Ceramide analogs such as B13 [21,22] and AD2646 [23] can antagonize CDase, exhibiting interesting activities in cancer chemotherapy and have been widely used in research on ceramide signaling pathways.

### GCS

GCS, also called UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase, is another important ceramide-metabolizing enzyme. GCS, located on the cytosolic surface of the Golgi apparatus, catalyzes the conversion of ceramide into GluCer [24]. Generally, upregulation of GCS levels prevents the accumulation of a ceramide pool, which reduces ceramide-induced apoptosis in response to certain cytotoxic drugs [25–27]. On the other hand, evidence also illustrated a close relationship between GCS and P-glycoprotein (P-gp; an important multidrug-resistance protein). Overexpression of P-gp in resistant cancer cells is concomitant with high GCS expression [28,29]. GCS inhibitor treatment in multidrug-resistant cancer cells downregulates the expression of *MDR1* (a P-gp-encoding gene) [30]. Furthermore, drug-resistant cancer cells exposed to GCS inhibitors become sensitive to anticancer agents [30–32]. These results strengthen the notion that inhibition of GCS is a promising therapeutic strategy for combating multidrug-resistance, thus, promoting the design of ceramide analogs as GCS inhibitors.

#### CerK and ceramide-1-phosphate

Phosphorylation of ceramide by the CerK produces ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), which plays an opposing physiological role compared with ceramide. C1P is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis, which blocks apoptosis through inhibition of acid SMase and serine palmitoyltransferase in macrophages [33,34]. C1P also stimulates cell proliferation through activation of the PI3-kinase/AKT, JNK and ERK1/2 pathways [35,36]. Therefore, blocking CerK to decrease the generation of C1P is the third anticancer target of ceramide analogs as enzyme inhibitors.

- SK, Sph-1-phosphate & Sph-1-phosphate receptors

Sph, the metabolite of ceramide generated by CDase, can be phosphorylated by SK to yield Sph-1-phosphate (S1P), another important signaling molecule in the ceramide pathway. S1P is implicated in many critical cellular processes. However, unlike ceramide, it promotes cell survival, proliferation and migration, as well as angiogenesis and allergic responses [2].

S1P mediates cell survival through different pathways, such as an intracellular signaling mechanism (e.g., regulation of BCL-2 family members) and an S1P receptor-dependent mechanism, referred to as ‘inside-out’ signaling. In the former pathway, S1P can negatively mediate apoptosis by upregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 [37], while downregulating the pro-apoptotic protein BAX [37,38]. It was also observed that exogenous S1P blocks the translocation of BAX to the mitochondria, which enhances the stability of mitochondrial membranes [39]. Furthermore, upregulated expression of BCL-2 family members can increase SK1 levels, which, in turn, generates more S1P from Sph, resulting in S1P signal amplification [40,41].

In the S1P receptor-dependent mechanism, intracellular S1P is transported to the outside of the cells by the members of ABC family transporters [42], and binds to and signals through S1P receptors located on the plasma membrane. To date, five S1P receptors have been identified, which are specific G protein-coupled receptors, designated as S1P1–5. Through these receptors, S1P regulates different cellular processes.

functions of S1P receptors are under investigation. Some results support that S1P<sub>1</sub> and S1P<sub>3</sub> mediate cell proliferation [43], migration [44,45], invasion [46,47] and angiogenesis [48].

S1P is interconvertible with ceramide, which is a negative mediator of apoptosis. It has been postulated that the ratio between S1P and ceramide determines cell fate. Targeting the conversion of ceramide to S1P is a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Since phosphorylation of Sph by SK is the sole known source of S1P, SK inhibitors are promising cancer chemotherapeutics.

As described above, two main approaches to promote anticancer activity in the ceramide–Sph–S1P axis have been identified as:

- Use of an exogenous supplement of ceramide to promote apoptosis;
- Inhibition of ceramide-metabolizing enzymes to regulate the ceramide/S1P rheostat.

Since both of these can be achieved by employing ceramide analogs (mimics or derivatives), these types of compounds have attracted a lot of attention in the past few years. Herein, we will review each step to discovery and development of anticancer ceramide analogs.

### Development of ceramide analogs

#### Structural characteristics of ceramide

Ceramide molecules contain a sphingoid long-chain base (Sph) backbone, linked to a fatty acid molecule through an amide bond (FIGURE 2). In earlier studies, the importance of the 4,5-trans-double bond was emphasized, and treated as the mark of Sph backbone. This conclusion was based on the notion that targeting ceramide-downstream effectors is the sole purpose to design ceramide analogs. With the development of ceramide-metabolizing enzyme inhibitors, many non-4,5-double bond agents such as S18 [49], PDMP [50] and FTY720 were designed [51]. To date, the 2-amino-1,3-propanediol or 2-amino-propanol moieties are considered as common characteristics of ceramide analogs.

In order to increase water solubility, the long-chain fatty acid of native ceramide structure is often replaced by short-chain fatty acids (acetic, hexanoic and octanoic acids) to form C<sub>2</sub>-, C<sub>6</sub>-, and C<sub>8</sub>-ceramides (C<sub>2</sub>-, C<sub>6</sub>-, and C<sub>8</sub>-Cer). Exposure of cells to short-chain ceramides has lead to ceramide-like anticancer activity in many preclinical studies [5,52–55]. Thus, in most studies short-chain ceramides, but not the naturally occurring ceramides, have been used as research tools.

##### Stereospecific apoptotic activity of short-chain ceramides

Since two chiral centers exist in the ceramide molecule, the natural D-erythro-ceramide has three stereoisomers, denoted as L-erythro-ceramide, D-threo-ceramide and L-threo-ceramide. To investigate the relationship between stereochemistry and activity, four C<sub>2</sub>-Cer isomers and four C<sub>2</sub>-dhCer isomers were synthesized and evaluated in leukemia cells (FIGURE 3) [56]. The four isomers of C<sub>2</sub>-Cer were active in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis with modest differences in potency (ranking as follows: L-threo-C<sub>2</sub>-Cer > D-erythro-C<sub>2</sub>-Cer = L-erythro-C<sub>2</sub>-Cer > D-threo-C<sub>2</sub>-Cer). This observation suggested that the non-natural stereoisomer L-threo-C<sub>2</sub>-Cer was more pro-apoptotic than the natural stereoisomer D-erythro-C<sub>2</sub>-Cer. On the other hand, with

Cer: Ceramide; dhCer: Dihydroceramide.

C₂-dhCer only the *three* compounds were active in these assays, whereas the *erythro* compounds were completely inactive. Thus, lack of the 4,5-double bond lead to inactivity in *erythro*-C₂-dhCer, but not in *threo*-C₂-dhCer. This systematic study provided a basic view of the relationship between ceramide stereoisomers and pro-apoptotic activities. Stereospecific activity is a common feature for ceramide analogs, suggesting that the targets of ceramide analogs also own specific spatial configurations. A large number of ceramide analog studies involve the investigation of stereostructure–activity relationships [14,57–62].

- **Discovery & development of B13 (inducing apoptosis and inhibiting CDase)**

In 1992, a group of phenyl-modified ceramide analogs (*L*-MAPPD, B13 [*D*-NMAPPD] and *D*-e-MAPP) was reported (FIGURE 4) [57]. The idea of this design approach might have been derived from a previous modification of GCS inhibitors (discussed below) [63]. In the original paper, this group of analogs demonstrated ceramide-like antiproliferation activity in human myelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Interestingly, this activity had stereospecific requirements. The *L*-isomer *L*-e-MAPP was found to be inactive, while *D*-e-MAPP was soon reported to be a neutral CDase inhibitor *in vitro* and induced a concentration- and time-dependent growth suppression accompanied by an arrest in the G₀/G₁ phase of the cell cycle [15]. In that paper, the explanation provided for the inactivity of *L*-e-MAPP was that *L*-e-MAPP is metabolized by alkaline CDase to an extent similar to that seen with C₁₆-ceramide. However, years later, B13 was found to be an acid CDase inhibitor, and induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines (FIGURE 4) [21,22,64]. Thus, *D*-e-MAPP and B13 not only upregulated ceramide levels in cultured cells but also potently induced apoptosis [1].

Almost at the same time, ceramide’s amide group proved not to be required for apoptosis, and the replacement of the carbonyl group by methylene group substantially decreased the time required for cells to die, with maximum DNA fragmentation occurring at 6 h as opposed to the 18 h as required by *d*-erythro-C₈-Cer [58]. The most potent compound (*d*-threo-C₈-Cer) in this group is illustrated in FIGURE 4. According to the structural features of B13 and *d*-threo-C₈-Cer, a group of ceramide analogs, including AD2646 (its hydrochloric salt was called LCL-204 by another group), AD2672 and AD2687, was created (FIGURE 4) [65]. When these compounds were applied to HL-60 cells, they inhibited the biosynthesis of sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids and induced apoptosis. AD2687 (trimethyl Sph analog) induced cell death at lower concentrations. An investigation of mechanisms involved found that these compounds were able to kill leukemic cells through distinct pathways implicating caspase activation and mitochondrial events [23,66].

Structural optimization of B13-like ceramides has been ongoing. The newest B13-like ceramide analogs are LCL-464 [67,68] and KPB-27 [69], which demonstrated potent inhibition of CDase as well as ceramide-like anticancer activities.

- **GCS inhibitors (PDMP family)**  
The investigation of GCS inhibitors was initiated prior to that of CDase inhibitors. The original purpose of these studies was to treat Gaucher's Disease, a genetic lack of adequate β-glucosidase activity [63]. The precursors of this family of compounds are *N*-decanoyl-2-amino-3-hydroxypropiophenone (RV-49, a 3-ketone-4-phenyl-ceramide) and *N*-acyl-norephedrine (a 1-dehydroxy-4-phenyl-ceramide) (FIGURE 5). Using RV-49 and *N*-acyl-norephedrine, 2-decanoylaminopropiophenone was yielded with a higher inhibition potency for GCS than the lead compounds. Introducing a morpholinyl group into the 1-position produced a noncompetitive GCS inhibitor, RV-378 (FIGURE 5). It inactivated the enzyme, probably by covalent reaction with the enzyme’s active site. Reduction of RV-378 at 3-ketone formed the more potent analog RV-583, which is a competitive GCS inhibitor [63,70]. When discovered, RV-583 was originally a mixture of four stereoisomers. After determination of each isomer, RV-583 acquired a new name, PDMP (FIGURE 5). It was found that only the *d*-three-PDMP (1S,2R) is active against GCS [71]. Shortly after, it was observed that *d*-three-PDMP caused growth inhibition and ceramide accumulation in cultured rabbit skin fibroblasts [72]. Replacement of the morphorlinyl group of RV-583 by a pyrrolidinyl group produced a pair of *erythro-* and *three-*isomers (BML-129 and BML-130). Both of these compounds demonstrated very effective growth inhibition of several kinds of cancer cells [73]. This was the first time that GCS inhibitors were linked to anticancer activities. Moreover, only *three-*isomer BML-130 inhibited GCS in MDCK cell homogenates, while *erythro-*isomer

BML-129 did not. Then, PPMP, PPPP and 4′-hydroxy-P4 were prepared based on the structural modification of D-threo-PDMP and BML-129/130 [50,74,75], leading to the discovery of the most potent GCS inhibitor, 4′-hydroxy-P4, at the end of the 20th century. In 2006, a group of PDMP-family analogs were reported by Hillaert *et al.* Among these, compounds 16c and 18 were derived from PPPP with the replacement

■ Derivatives of Sph as SK inhibitors

DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine & N,N-dimethylsphingosine

As a Sph derivative, DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DHS or safingol, FIGURE 6) was the first identified SK inhibitor. DHS was shown to be a competitive inhibitor for SK1, and a substrate for SK2 [61]. Shortly after, $N,N$-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) was proved to be more potent than DHS [78], and served as a competitive inhibitor for both SK1 and SK2 [79,80]. DMS induces apoptosis in both human epidermoid carcinoma KB-3–1 and its multidrug-resistant subclone KB-C2 cells *in vitro* [81]. Human colonic carcinoma cell lines HT29, HRTI8, MKN74 and COLO205 were reported to be more susceptible to apoptosis upon addition of DMS, with potency comparable to $C_2$-Cer [82]. DHS and DMS have since been intensively used in studies involving ceramide metabolism. However, neither DHS nor DMS were a specific SK inhibitor, since they also inhibited PKC [83] and CerK [84].

FTY720 (fingolimod)

When the long-chain hydrophobic group of Sph was shifted from the 3-position to the 2-position, a new group of Sph derivatives, 2-substituted 2-amino-1,3-propanediols, was developed. Among these analogs, FTY720 (2-amino-2-(2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl)-1,3-propanedial hydrochloride, FIGURE 6) has been the most investigated. This compound is known for its immunosuppressive properties. However, FTY720 is also able to induce growth arrest and apoptosis of various cancer cell lines, including human prostate cancer cells [51], bladder cancer cells [85], renal cancer cells [86], pancreatic cancer cells [87], breast cancer cells, colon cancer cells [88] and brain tumor stem cells [89]. The *in vivo* assays showed that FTY720 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis [90], and reduced tumor vascularization and angiogenesis [91]. The pro-apoptotic effect of FTY720 was demonstrated to be associated with mitochondria-dependent activation [51,92] as well as inhibition of SK1 [93]. It is very interesting that phosphorylation of FTY720 by SK2 produces a biologically active molecule, FTY720-phosphate (FTY720-P) [94,95] that could bind to and activate four of the five S1P receptors, S1P${}_{1,3-5}$ [96]. Although FTY720-P is an S1P${}_1$ receptor agonist, it leads to endocytosis

and proteasomal degradation of the S1P₁ receptor in T lymphocytes [97], thereby preventing their egress from lymph nodes [97]. It is unclear whether the antitumor activity of FTY720 is partly from downregulating the S1P₁ receptor. However, the structural optimization of FTY720 is in progress [98].

**ROME**

Since FTY720 is a substrate of SK2, it was O-mono-methylated, forming (S)- and (R)-FTY720-OMe (ROME) to avoid metabolism by SK2 (FIGURE 6). The inhibitory activity of ROME was stereospecific. (R)-FTY720-OMe specifically inhibited SK2, and not SK1, while (S)-FTY720-OMe failed to inhibit SK2. Prolonged treatment of HEK 293 cells with (R)-FTY720-OMe induced a reduction in SK2 expression and inhibited DNA synthesis in HEK 293 cells [60]. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with ROME prevented actin enrichment into lamellipodia in response to S1P, suggesting that metastasis could be inhibited. As a SK2-selective inhibitor, (R)-FTY720-OMe increased Sph and decreased S1P levels, but had no effect on ceramide levels and did not induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells [99].

**KRP-203**

Recently, a FTY720-like immunosuppressant, KRP-203 (FIGURE 6) has been reported to be a S1P₁ receptor-selective agonist in contrast to FTY720 [100]. Both of the compounds had a similar high affinity for the S1P₁ receptor with an ED₅₀ in the nanomolar range. However, for S1P₃ the FTY720-P displayed an ED₅₀ of 1.74 nM whereas KRP-203-P had an ED₅₀ of >1 mM [101]. KRP-203 proved to not only regulate T-cell responses but also those of B cells. The anticancer activity of KRP-203 is currently under investigation.

Cl6-serinol, Cl8-serinol & N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-oleoylamide

In contrast to FTY720, modification of 2-amino-1,3-propanediol on the amino group produced amidated 2-amino-1,3-propanediol derivatives (C16-serinol [S16], C18-serinol [S18], N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-myristoyl-amide [B16] and N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-oleoylamide [T18]; FIGURE 6). S16 was the first compound of this group. Incubation of neuroblastoma cells with S16 increased the concentration of endogenous ceramide by 50–80% and caused apoptosis in rapidly dividing low-density cells but not in confluent cells. Further studies indicated that apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells induced by S16 was at least partially mediated by activation of PKCζ, an important regulator in ceramide-induced apoptosis pathway (shown in FIGURE 1) [102]. Structural optimization of S16 created a new generation 2-amino-1,3-propanediol (S18; FIGURE 6), which induced apoptosis in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal cancer lines. S18 triggered pro-apoptotic signaling pathways without prior elevation of endogenous ceramide, suggesting that it probably replaced ceramide to activate downstream effectors [49]. However, unfortunately the SK inhibition activity of this group has not been investigated.

Other SK inhibitors, such as SKI-I, -II, -V [103], B-5354 [104], F-12509A, and S-15183-a and -b [104] do not belong to the ceramide structure system, and they are not discussed here.

- Multifarious modifications in the recent decade

Over the past 10 years, there have been a variety of approaches to the design of new ceramide analogs. According to the modification sites, these design approaches can be classified into Sph backbone modification, N-terminal side chain modification and mixed structural modification.

It is known that the Sph backbone is more important than the N-terminal side chain for the pro-apoptotic activity of ceramide. The purpose of backbone optimization is to discover a better pharmacophore than 3-hydroxy-4-ene (the main active moiety of ceramide), which can more effectively activate ceramide downstream effectors, inducing apoptosis. On the basis of the reported results, both the 3-hydroxy and the 4,5-double bond are replaceable. A relatively rigid structure with a conjugated system (such as a conjugated diene, an enone or an aromatic ring) in the Sph backbone improves the pro-apoptotic activities [16,64,105]. TABLE I provides information on a number of ceramide analogs and their activities [16,106–117].

Unlike the backbone modification, the N-terminal side chain modification focuses on the metabolic properties of ceramide, such as water/lipid solubility [118]. Modifying the N-terminal amide group could avoid ceramide analog metabolism by CDase [59,119] or inhibit CDase-metabolizing endogenous ceramide [120]. A major success of N-terminal side chain modification was the discovery of positively charged ceramide analogs (e.g., LCL124, LCL29 and LCL30) [118]. These analogs own a pyridinium functional group, which dramatically increases the water solubility of the whole molecule. Furthermore these positively charged ceramide analogs can target negatively charged intracellular compartments, and accumulate mainly in mitochondria-, and nuclei-enriched fractions, in turn increasing mitochondrial membrane permeability and triggering the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade. These compounds are displayed in TABLE 2 [12,13,59,118–125], with other

N-terminal side chain-modified ceramides in TABLE 3 [126–131].

The mixed modification on both chains of ceramide has been reported only in the past few years. However, the limited information available points to the fact that 1-position modification highly correlates with the inhibition of SK and GCS.

### Future perspective

To date, thousands of potential anticancer ceramide analogs have been synthesized and evaluated aiming at the diverse targets in the ceramide signaling pathway. Since ceramide is in the center of sphingolipid metabolism, its analogs are intrinsically involved in multiple mechanisms of action. Sometimes, multiple mechanisms point in the same direction, and we can obtain multi-action anticancer agents. However, most often, selective agents are more desirable. As in the case of any other anticancer agents, improving

the selectivity of the agent for a certain target over other targets, for a certain organ over other organs, and for tumor cells over normal cells, are the best approaches to develop new ceramide analogs. Thus, mechanism investigation is as important as activity screening for these chemicals and a multi-evaluation system around ceramide-related targets is desired. In recent years, the crystal structures of some ceramide targets, such as SK [132], neutral CDase [133] and PP2A [134] have been published. These developments prompted a change in the approach to the design of ceramide analogs from ligand-based optimization to ligand/protein-based optimization, and accelerated the development of ceramide-based anticancer agents.

### Executive summary

#### Anticancer target system surrounding ceramide pathway
- Ceramides drive apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and autophagic responses.
- Ceramide metabolites sphingosine-1-phosphate and ceramide-1-phosphate stimulate cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis.
- Ceramide-metabolizing enzyme glucosylceramide synthase positively correlates with cancer multidrug resistance.

#### Ceramide analogs as anticancer agents
- Ceramide analogs can activate ceramide downstream effectors like CAPPs inducing cell apoptosis.
- Ceramide analogs can block ceramide metabolism by inhibiting CDase, SK, CerK and GCS, elevating intracellular ceramide levels.

#### Structure–activity relationship of anticancer ceramide analogs
- Stereospecific activity is a common feature for ceramide analogs.
- Sphingosine backbone modification by a rigid or conjugated system increases apoptotic activity of ceramides.
- 1-position modification on ceramide leads to the inhibition of GCS.
- Introducing positively charged groups increases mitochondrial membrane permeability and triggers the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade.
