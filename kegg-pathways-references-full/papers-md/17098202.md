Signal transduction events leading to the survival, differentiation, or apoptosis of cells of the innate or adaptive immune system must be properly coordinated to ensure the normal mounting and termination of immune responses. One of the key transcription factors in immune responses is nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which has been the focus of intense investigation over the past two decades. With the identification of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex and ongoing progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms connecting T cell and B cell receptor proximal signals to the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, a cohesive model of antigen receptor (AgR)-dependent signaling to NF-κB activation is beginning to emerge. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of research into the mechanisms that regulate AgR-mediated NF-κB transcriptional activity, with particular focus on the events leading to activation of the IKK complex.

## Introduction

The transcription factor NF-κB regulates various aspects of immune-cell development, homeostasis, survival, and function. Pathogen recognition, whether mediated through the Toll-like receptors of the innate immune system (for detailed reviews see Kawai and Akira, 2006; West et al., 2006) or through the antigen-specific T and B cell receptors (TCR and BCR) of the adaptive immune system, triggers distinct signal-transduction pathways that lead to the activation of NF-κB. Numerous genetic models in mice have confirmed the essential role of this transcription factor in promoting T and B cell activation, expansion, and effector function in response to infection (Bonizzi and Karin, 2004; Hayden and Ghosh, 2004). Moreover, dysregulated NF-κB activation either via the amplification of Rel genes or via aberrant activation of upstream regulators contributes to the development of autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, and cancer (Karin, 2006; Karin and Greten, 2005). The molecular mechanisms controlling NF-κB activation in lymphocytes are therefore currently the focus of intense research.

First described in nuclei of B cells, NF-κB has since been shown to exist in an inactive cytosolic form in all cell types. Upon activation by any of a large number of inducers, NF-κB rapidly translocates into the nucleus and engages its cognate κB enhancer elements upstream of various target genes. NF-κB represents a group of structurally related and evolutionarily conserved proteins (also known as the Rel family) with five members in mammals: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel (REL),

NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p100). The proteins share an N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD) of approximately 300 amino acids, which includes sequences responsible for dimerization, interaction with inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) inhibitory proteins, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. In resting cells most members of this family form both homodimers and heterodimers bound to IκB family proteins in the cytosol and thereby prevent the complex from shuttling to the nucleus and hence maintain NF-κB in an inactive state.

The mammalian NF-κB proteins can be broadly classified into two groups. One group includes RelA, RelB, and c-Rel, which are expressed as mature proteins containing a C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) (Ghosh and Karin, 2002). The second group consists of NF-κB1 (p50) and NF-κB2 (p52), which are at first expressed as large precursor proteins of 105 and 100 kDa, respectively, and undergo proteolytic processing to generate the smaller forms. Both p50 and p52 lack transactivation domains, and therefore homodimers of these proteins cannot drive transcription. The NF-κB precursors p100 and p105 can also function as IκBs through their C-terminal ankyrin repeats and retain the Rel proteins in the cytoplasm (Ghosh and Karin, 2002). There are nine IκB family members, which can be divided into three subgroups: (1) the classical IκBs α, β, γ (p70), and ε; (2) the NF-κB precursors p105 and p100; and (3) the unusual IκBs, B cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL)-3, IκBζ and IκBNS. Inhibitory IκB proteins are characterized by the presence of five to seven ankyrin repeats that allow protein-protein interactions with NF-κB dimers, thereby masking at least one of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the RHD of NF-κBs. In addition, IκBα blocks DNA binding and promotes nuclear export of associated NF-κB dimers through an N-terminal export sequence (Hayden and Ghosh, 2004; Schmitz et al., 2004).

NF-κB signaling occurs through either the classical (also known as canonical) or alternative (also known as noncanonical, nonclassical, or novel) pathway (Bonizzi and Karin, 2004; Ghosh and Karin, 2002). Whereas the classical pathway is IκB kinase (IKK) β and IKKγ (also known as NF-κB essential modulator—NEMO) dependent and NF-κB activation occurs through IκB degradation (Li and Verma, 2002), the alternative pathway depends on IKKα- and NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and is based on regulated processing of the p100 precursor protein (Senftleben et al., 2001; Xiao et al., 2001). This alternative pathway is involved in NF-κB activation after stimulation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members B cell activating factor (BAFF), lymphotoxin β, and CD40 ligand and is particularly important for B cell maturation and lymphoid organ formation (Hayden et al., 2006).

Degradation of IκB is a tightly controlled process that is initiated upon specific phosphorylation on two conserved N-terminal serine residues by the activated IKK complex. This 700–900 kDa complex is composed of at least three subunits: two catalytic kinase subunits, IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), and a structural as well as regulatory subunit, IKKγ (NEMO). Phosphorylated IκB is

marked for E2- and E3-ligase-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequently for 26S proteosomal degradation, freeing and thereby activating NF-κB (Li and Verma, 2002). The function of the Rel protein TADs (e.g., recruitment of coactivators and displacement of repressors after DNA binding) is enhanced through direct post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (Zhong et al., 1998) and acetylation, and therefore provides another layer of regulation of NF-κB-mediated responses (for reviews, see Chen and Greene, 2004; Schmitz et al., 2004). It should be noted that the connection between TCR and BCR activation and specific nuclear modifications of NF-κB subunits is currently poorly understood.

Activated NF-κB can be downregulated through multiple mechanisms including the well-characterized feedback loop involving newly synthesized IκBα, which binds to nuclear NF-κB and thus removes it from DNA and exports it to the cytosol (Hayden and Ghosh, 2004). Eventually the quiescent state of the cell is restored, ensuring that the cell can respond to other extracellular stimuli (Bonizzi and Karin, 2004).

Various receptors activate NF-κB through signal-transduction pathways that appear to be quite distinct. A number of genetic studies have identified signaling intermediates involved in the BCR- and TCR-mediated activation of the IKK complex (Table 1). Numerous biochemical studies have established a putative model of IKK activation through these effectors; in this model, protein kinase C θ (PKCθ) in T cells and PKCβ in B cells act upstream of a trimolecular protein complex CARMA1 (also known as CARD11)-BCL10-MALT1 (referred to as the CBM complex) to promote NEMO polyubiquitination and consequent IKK activation. The events that occur downstream of the IKK complex, however, are not specific for lymphocytes and appear to be similar to those in most NF-κB-activating pathways. Therefore, we will primarily focus our discussion on events that link antigen receptors to the IKK complex during lymphocyte activation.

Proximal Signaling Components of TCR- and BCR-Induced NF-κB Activation

Engagement of TCRs induces the formation of an ordered, membrane-associated complex referred to as the immunological synapse in which a central signaling zone surrounds clustered TCRs. These “supramolecular activation clusters” (SMAC) can be subdivided into the central SMAC (cSMAC) and peripheral SMAC (pSMAC). The TCR-CD3 complex, as well as CD28, is localized to the cSMAC, whereas other signaling proteins appear to be recruited to one or the other of these distinct regions where they can transmit distinct signals ([Monks et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.187.6.1099)). Most of the signaling intermediates relevant to NF-κB activation become clustered in the cSMAC. It should be mentioned that a homologous synaptic structure is formed in B cells and that many highly similar molecular events are activated after BCR engagement ([Batista et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.194.11.1555)).

The antigen receptor complexes associate with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the Src family (SFKs): Lck (bound to the cytosolic site of CD4 or CD8 coreceptors) and Fyn in T cells and Blk, Fyn, and Lyn in B cells (Figure 1). SFKs in both cell types associate with the phosphatase CD45 that facilitates activation of SFKs by removing phosphates from inhibitory tyrosine residues. After receptor engagement, SFKs phosphorylate conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) on CD3 or Igα and Igβ chains. The cytoplasmic Syk family tyrosine kinases ZAP70 and Syk are then recruited via SH2 domains to the phosphorylated ITAMs of the TCR or BCR complexes, respectively. ZAP70 and Syk, in turn, phosphorylate several substrates, including the transmembrane adaptor molecules LAT and LAB and the cytosolic adaptor proteins SLP76 and SLP65 (also known as BLNK) in T and B lymphocytes ([Weil and Israel, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2004.04.001)). These proteins then serve as docking surfaces for other adaptors such as Grb2, GADS, Bam32, the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). Additionally, the Tec family members Itk and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) become activated. A multiprotein signaling complex is ultimately formed, and its formation leads to activation of the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP₃) and Ras family pathways (Figure 1).

The CD28 Coreceptor in TCR Signaling to NF-κB

Activation of only the TCR leads to weak activation of NF-κB, and signals from the CD28 coreceptor are necessary to produce full T cell and NF-κB activation ([Kane et al., 2002a](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.195.11.1447)). CD28 is engaged by its ligands B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on APCs and most likely helps augment the TCR signal rather than delivering a unique second signal ([Schmitz and Krappmann, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.016)).

The link between NF-κB and CD28 was suggested by the demonstration of NF-κB binding to the CD28-responsive element (CD28 RE) in the IL-2 promoter ([Verweij et al., 1991](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.174.5.1189)). It appears that CD28 coengagement can signal to NF-κB through two different pathways (Figure 1) ([Schmitz and Krappmann, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.016)). The first pathway involves PI3K-dependent signaling that is initiated upon recruitment of the p85 regulatory PI3K subunit to the CD28 coreceptor. This allows SH3 domain-dependent binding and activation of Rho-family GTPases as well as activation of PI3K. Activated PI3K leads to the generation of the second-messenger molecules PIP2 and PIP3, which are localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and bind various pleckstrin homology domain (PHD)-containing proteins, including phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1, discussed later), protein kinase B (PKB also known as Akt), and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav ([Lemon, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2005.02.010)). Transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of PKB show increased NF-κB activity after CD28 engagement, suggesting its importance in TCR-CD28-mediated NF-κB activation ([Jones et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.192.11.1615)). One pathway of transmitting PKB-derived signals to NF-κB starts with the phosphorylation of the serine-threonine kinase Cot (also known as Tpl2), which leads to NIK-dependent activation of the IKK signalosome ([Kane et al., 2002b](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.195.11.1447)). A study involving overexpression experiments suggested that NIK might control CD28-dependent transcription and T cell activation by modulating the phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of c-Rel ([Sanchez-Valdepenas et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20051964)). PKB in cooperation with activated PKCθ has also been implicated in TCR-CD28-mediated binding to CARMA1 by promoting the phosphorylation of BCL10 and thereby activating NF-κB ([Narayan et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20051964)). However, definitive demonstration of the importance of PKB in NF-κB signaling awaits the availability of cell-specific, PKB-deficient mouse models. MEKK1 and the BCL10-interacting kinase RIP2 have also been reported to be involved in CD28-triggered IKK-NF-κB activation; however, the exact molecular targets for these kinases remain undefined ([Ruefli-Brasse et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20031964); [Tao et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20011964)).

The second pathway linking CD28 to NF-κB activation utilizes the adaptor protein Grb2. Grb2 lacks any intrinsic enzymatic activity but connects signaling intermediates via its SH2 and SH3 domains. Most crucial for T cell costimulatory signals is the interaction of Grb2 and Vav ([Fujikawa et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20021964)). Costimulation results in prolonged and sustained tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane localization of Vav in comparison to TCR stimulation alone ([Hehner et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.192.11.1615)). Vav therefore seems to function as a signal integrator receiving input from CD28 as well as from the TCR. Once activated, Vav signals in many directions: The GEF activity leads through Rac and Rho to actin cytoskeleton reorganization, whereas the membrane-associated Vav-SLP76 complex leads to activation of PLCγ and consequent release of diacylglycerol (DAG), which is important for transmitting the TCR-CD28 signal to PKCθ ([Villalba et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.195.11.1447)). Vav binds to IKKα to recruit it to the membrane and activate it in response to CD28 stimulation ([Piccolella et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20021964)). In addition to its involvement in the TCR-CD28-mediated NF-κB pathway, Vav is also important for activation of NFAT, AP1, and JNK, as well as for sustained Ca²⁺ signaling ([Cao et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.195.11.1447); [Costello et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.195.11.1447)).

The Importance of PKC Members in Antigen-Receptor Signaling to NF-κB

Whereas the early Ag receptor signals are transduced by successive tyrosine phosphorylation events, generation of DAG and IP₃ by PLCγ leads to a shift in the nature of modifications used to transmit the signal further. Serine and threonine phosphorylation and lysine

Figure 1. Early Signaling Events in Antigen-Receptor-Mediated NF-κB Activation

(A) Binding of TCR to peptide-MHC and costimulation through CD28-B7 interaction leads to PKCθ-mediated CARMA1 phosphorylation. Through multiple steps, initial tyrosine phosphorylation events at the TCR complex lead to PLCγ1 and PI3K activation. PI3K promotes recruitment of PDK1, which in turn mediates recruitment of the IKK complex through PKCθ and CARMA1. PKCθ phosphorylates CARMA1, leading to an active CARMA1 conformation with accessible protein-interaction sites. At the same time, BCL10 is phosphorylated in cytosolic POLKADOTs, perhaps by RIP2, and starts to associate with MALT1.

(B) Receptor-proximal events of BCR activation are highly analogous to those of the TCR. Although the role of PDK1 in B cell signaling is not established, BCR signaling to NF-κB requires PLCγ2 and PKCβ as well as the CBM signalosome to achieve activation of IKK. Binding to antigens in the presence of costimulatory cytokines results in PKCβ-mediated CARMA1 phosphorylation in B cells.

ubiquitination become the key modifications that are then used to build up a cascade of progressive oligomerization events that ultimately culminate in activation of the IKK complex. The PKC isoforms that initiate this cascade (Figure 2) are the DAG-dependent, Ca²⁺-independent PKCθ in T cells and the conventional DAG-and Ca²⁺-dependent PKCβ in B cells (Su et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2000).

PKCθ in T Cells

PKCθ is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and T cells and has been selectively implicated in NF-κB and JNK activation. Among the several PKC isoforms expressed in T cells (PKCβ, δ, ε, η, ζ), PKCθ is the only PKC isoform that is translocated to the cytoplasmic side of the cSMAC after TCR stimulation (Monks et al., 1998); it there plays an absolutely essential role in

NF-κB activation (Bi et al., 2001). PKCθ is not involved in the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway because the induction of NF-κB by PKCθ is selectively mediated by IKKβ (Li et al., 2005). In the classical NF-κB signaling pathway, PKCθ has been shown to be required for TCR-CD28-induced degradation of IκBα and IκBε but not IκBβ (Li et al., 2005). Inactivation of murine PKCθ confirmed the importance of this kinase in the TCR-mediated NF-κB pathway, leading to IL-2 transcription in mature T lymphocytes (Sun et al., 2000). The activity of PKCθ is regulated by membrane recruitment and conformational changes, but the exact mechanism(s) remains elusive. It is believed that PKCθ catalytically matures through different phosphorylation events in a temporally and spatially segregated manner (Sedwick and Altman, 2004). There is also the possibility that PKCθ activity is modulated by interactions with other

PKC family members through its activation-loop region, as was shown for conventional PKCα ([Trushin et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200211069)). Vav and Lck are required for PKCθ membrane relocalization. Moreover, the physical association between PKCθ and Lck in lipid rafts promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ on amino acid 90 (Figure 2), which might be an important step in NF-κB activation ([Bi et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.153.4.801); [Huang et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050)).

Another molecule that has been suggested to play an important role in PKCθ recruitment is the protein kinase PDK1. Vav-dependent activation of PI3K after CD28 engagement induces PDK1 recruitment to the plasma membrane (Figure 1); PDK1 then phosphorylates PKCθ on threonine 538 (located in the activation loop, see Figure 2) and thereby promotes the recruitment of PKCθ to the lipid rafts and PKCθ’s subsequent activation ([Villalba et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050); [Villalba et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050)). Recently, we have provided evidence that PDK1 simultaneously recruits the CBM complex through binding to CARMA1 and PKCθ (Figure 1) ([Lee et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050)). Interestingly, it appears that although PKCθ is phosphorylated by PDK1, PKCθ in turn can also phosphorylate PDK1 (our unpublished observation). Despite the central role played by PDK1 in TCR-induced NF-κB activation, early embryonic lethality of PDK1 knockouts has prevented a straightforward genetic analysis of PDK1 function in T cell activation. In addition, conditional knockout of PDK1 in the T

cell lineage via the lck-cre transgene resulted in a block early in thymocyte development, and hence PDK1-deficient T cells suitable for studying TCR signaling have not yet been isolated ([Hinton et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050)). Therefore, the importance of PDK1 in T cell signaling remains to be established unequivocally.

IRAK-4, a kinase that is essential for signaling from Toll-like receptors (TLRs), may also play a critical role in TCR-mediated activation of NF-κB ([Suzuki et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050)). This study proposed that upon TCR stimulation ZAP70-associated IRAK-4 is recruited to the peripheral SMAC and phosphorylates PKCθ on threonine 538 and that this phosphorylation facilitates PKCθ-mediated IKK activation.

Several studies suggest that PKCθ most likely contributes to the dynamic organization of the immunological synapse by regulating the phosphorylation of actin-interacting proteins, for instance WASP and moesin ([Sasahara et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050); [Thome, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050)). In addition, SAP, a protein mutated in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), has been implicated in TCR and SLAM coreceptor-mediated PKCθ and BCL10 lipid-raft recruitment ([Cannons et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1084/jcb.200202050)). Because Fyn-deficient T cells show a phenotype similar to SAP-deficient T cells, these findings suggest the involvement of a SAP-Fyn pathway in the modulation of NF-κB activity in T cells. Therefore, it appears that signals from the TCR, CD28 (through

### PKCθ-Deficient Mouse Models

Despite accumulating evidence, including one deficient mouse model (by Sun et al., 2000) implicating a crucial and selective role for PKCθ in mediating NF-κB activation in response to TCR-CD28 stimulation, the exact role played by this kinase is not completely clear. An additional PKCθ-deficient mouse model generated by Baier and colleagues (Pfeifhofer et al., 2003) revealed marked phenotypic differences from the knockout mice previously reported by Littman and colleagues (Sun et al., 2000). This mouse displayed completely abrogated NFAT transactivation after CD3-CD28 engagement in mature T cells, whereas NF-κB and AP1 DNA binding in an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay were only partially impaired (Pfeifhofer et al., 2003). Because the genetic background of both mouse models are identical and both show impaired IL-2 secretion, the reason for these discrepancies remains unclear. However, they might result from differences in the targeting strategy. Sun et al. replaced exon 11 with a PGK neo insert that might have left a truncated 365 amino acid mutant PKCθ, whereas Pfeifhofer et al. deleted exons 3 and 4, which left only a 9 amino acid residual open reading frame. If there is a truncated PKCθ in the mouse model generated by Sun et al., it could function as a dominant-negative inhibitor under some circumstances and thereby affect the phenotype.

In this regard, it is interesting that a recent study implies a role for PKCθ in the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration in primary T cells via enhancement of PLCγ activity in a positive-feedback loop, where the Tec family kinase Itk has been proposed as the potential link between PKCθ and PLCγ (Manicassamy et al., 2006). Increased Ca²⁺ influx activates the phosphatase calcineurin, which in turn activates NFAT (Altman et al., 2004). Moreover, it was also shown that PDK1-activated PKA promotes NFAT-dependent transcription of the T helper 2 cytokine IL-4 in the D10 T cell line after TCR-CD28 stimulation (Nirula et al., 2006). Because PDK1 and PKCθ cooperate in NF-κB activation after TCR costimulation, one might speculate that the mutant PKCθ protein in the Sun et al. study is still capable of stimulating PDK1 and thereby activating NFAT.

Conformational changes of PKCθ have been suggested to be a key element in the regulation of this protein kinase. The amino (N)-terminal regulatory region with its pseudosubstrate sequence motif (Figure 2) is important for masking the carboxy (C)-terminal ATP binding site and thereby inactivating the catalytic kinase domain of cytosolic PKCθ under resting conditions (Sedwick and Altman, 2004). Constitutively active mutants of PKCθ can therefore be generated by replacement of critical alanines with glutamines (A148E or A152E) in the pseudosubstrate motif; this leaves the catalytic site free for interaction with its substrates (Baier-Bitterlich et al., 1996). Numerous overexpression studies with this constitutively active form have established the importance of PKCθ in activating NF-κB in a T cell- and stimulus-specific manner. Thus, the mutant protein

is not active in nonlymphoid cells, and a kinase-deficient (K409W or K409R) form of PKCθ (Figure 1) inhibits TCR-mediated, but not TNFα- or IL-1-mediated, NF-κB activity (Coudronniere et al., 2000; Khoshnan et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2000).

PKCθ contains a number of autophosphorylation sites, e.g., serines 676 and 695 (Figure 1), that influence its catalytic activity (Liu et al., 2002). Serine 695 seems to be required to trigger further phosphorylation events at adjacent threonine 692 and 703 residues (Thebault and Ochoa-Garay, 2004). Nevertheless, the biological role of these posttranslational modifications of PKCθ during TCR-CD28-mediated signaling remains largely elusive. There may be a major autophosphorylation site at threonine 219. Mutation of this site to alanine (T219A) abrogated NF-κB, NFAT, and IL-2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells (Thuille et al., 2005). Remarkably, this site does not affect catalytic activity or second-messenger lipid-binding activity of PKCθ in vitro, but it prevents recruitment of PKCθ to the immunological synapse in activated T cells and diminishes the crosstalk between PKCθ and PKB in NF-κB activation pathways (Thuille et al., 2005). The generation of PKCθ-deficient T cell lines, conditional knockout mice, and knockin mouse models with PKCθ mutants in a PKCθ-deficient background should be powerful tools for exploring the role of phosphorylation events in the regulation of PKCθ. It is also important to test the importance of the kinase domain and catalytic activity of PKCθ in the TCR-CD28-mediated signaling. Finally, in ZAP70-deficient T cells, NF-κB activity can be rescued by overexpression of a IKKγ-SH2-domain chimera, which directly targets IKKγ to the immunological synapse (Weil et al., 2003). This suggests that TCR signaling downstream of ZAP70 might only be necessary for proper IKK membrane recruitment.

### PKCβ in B Cells

As described for PKCθ in T cells, PKCβ (Figure 2) and IKK are recruited into lipid rafts of B lymphocytes during BCR stimulation (Saijo et al., 2002; Su et al., 2002). PKCβ-deficient mice show diminished BCR-mediated NF-κB activation and demonstrate a dramatic impact on IKKα phosphorylation. Also, B cell developmental defects that include reduced B cell numbers in follicular mature and peritoneal B1 cells are observed (Su et al., 2002). Because BCR-mediated IKK activation in PKCβ-deficient B cells cannot be rescued by phorbol ester treatment or by CD40 coreceptor engagement, as in Btk-deficient B cells, it has been suggested that PKCβ might act downstream of Btk (Figure 1) (Su et al., 2002).

### CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 Complex as the Central Signaling Module in Antigen-Receptor-Induced Activation of NF-κB

CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 were only recently identified as key components in the antigen receptor (AgR)-induced signaling pathway that leads to NF-κB activation downstream of PKCθ and PKCβ.

BCL10 was first described as a target of chromosomal translocation in certain aggressive B cell lymphomas (Willis et al., 1999). The resulting overexpression of BCL10 leads to constitutive NF-κB activation, which is a hallmark of many MALT lymphomas (Isaacson, 2005;

Thome and Tschopp, 2003). BCL10 belongs to the larger family of proteins that include caspase recruitment domains (CARD). Most CARD-containing proteins are involved in apoptosis, and it was therefore surprising that the phenotype of BCL10-deficient mice revealed defects in humoral and cellular immune responses, antigen-induced proliferation, and NF-κB activation in T and B cells (Ruland et al., 2001). The BCL10-deficient mice also exhibit impaired neuronal-tube closure and a reduced number of follicular and marginal-zone B cells (Xue et al., 2003), thus implicating BCL10 not only in lymphocyte activation but also in neural development and in the development of B cells (Thome, 2004). Because there are normal numbers of peripheral T cells in BCL10-deficient mice (Ruland et al., 2001), the role of this adaptor protein in the development of immune cells is still unclear and requires further analysis.

BCL10 has been reported to interact with numerous cytoplasmic signaling molecules, including MALT1 (Lucas et al., 2001; Uren et al., 2000), the CARD proteins RIP2 (Ruefli-Brasse et al., 2004), CARMA1 (also known as CARD11 or Bimp2) (Bertin et al., 2001; Gaide et al., 2001; Pomerantz et al., 2002), CARMA2 (also known as CARD14 or Bimp3) (Bertin et al., 2001), CARMA3 (also known as CARD10 or Bimp1) (McAllister-Lucas et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001b), and CARD9 (Bertin et al., 2000), and indirectly via MALT1 with TRAF6 (Sun et al., 2004), an E3 ubiquitin ligase.

The interaction with MALT1 and oligomerization (Zhou et al., 2004) under conditions that promote efficient NF-κB activation produce cytoplasmic structures called POLKADOTS (punctate and oligomeric killing or activating domains transducing signals, Figure 1). POLKADOTS contain both highly stable and rapidly equilibrating protein components (Schaefer et al., 2004). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses showed that POLKADOTS are sites of enhanced interactions between BCL10 and partner signaling proteins (Rossman et al., 2006). These observations strongly suggest that POLKADOTS are focal sites of dynamic information exchange between cytosolic intermediates involved in TCR-mediated activation of NF-κB. Another recent interesting finding is the CARMA1-dependent BCL10-mediated activation of JNK2 leading to elevated c-Jun transcriptional activity after TCR engagement (Blonska et al., personal communication). In this regard, BCL10 is proposed to act as a scaffold for CARMA1, JNK2, MKK7, and TAK1.

The adaptor CARMA1 was identified by several groups as a BCL10-interacting protein and is the only lymphocyte-specific member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family (Bertin et al., 2001; Gaide et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2002). CARMA1 shares with other MAGUK family members an N-terminal CARD domain, followed by a coiled-coil motif (CC) and a MAGUK motif containing PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains (Figure 2) (Thome, 2004).

The targets of PKCβ and PKCθ in BCR- and TCR-stimulated NF-κB activation pathways were unknown despite intense research for a number of years. Recently, two groups independently reported that the flexible linker region (located between the coiled-coil and PDZ domains) of murine CARMA1 is phosphorylated on at least three critical serine residues (Ser-564, -649, and

-657) by PKCθ after TCR engagement (Matsumoto et al., 2005) and by PKCβ after BCR activation (Sommer et al., 2005). These phosphorylation events appear to be the critical regulatory step that controls the assembly and oligomerization cascade of the CBM complex, allows the interaction of CARMA1 with BCL10-MALT1, and thereby triggers NF-κB activation (Figures 1 and 3). Hence, this region of CARMA1 was termed the PKC-regulated domain (PRD; Figure 2) (Sommer et al., 2005).

Lymphocytes from CARMA1-deficient mice (Egawa et al., 2003; Hara et al., 2003), mice lacking the CARD domain of CARMA1 (Newton and Dixit, 2003), or mice with a point mutation in the CARMA1 CC domain (“unmodulated,” L298Q substitution) (Jun et al., 2003) cannot proliferate or activate the IKK complex or JNK in response to AgR engagement. CARMA1-deficient mice exhibit profound defects in the development or survival of B1 and NK cells, or both, as well as a complete loss of B cell responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), anti-IgM, CD40L, and BCR engagement (Hara et al., 2003). They also show a decreased T cell response to TCR stimulation (Egawa et al., 2003). In contrast, the CC domain mutation in “unmodulated” mice has no effect on B cell proliferation in response to LPS (Jun et al., 2003). TCR-induced cell-cycle entry is also unaffected in “unmodulated” mice (Jun et al., 2003), whereas it is almost completely blocked in the CARMA1-deficient mice (Hara et al., 2003). Other domains of CARMA1 are therefore sufficient to mediate TCR signaling to NF-κB for the initial response. Nevertheless, the CC domain seems critical for the signal-enhancing and survival effects induced by CD28 costimulation. In this respect, the CARMA1 CC domain was proposed to be required for CD28-mediated clustering of lipid rafts, PKCθ, or a number of MAP3Ks that are implicated in CD28 signaling to NF-κB and JNK (Kane et al., 2002a).

An enormous amount of work has been carried out to show that CARMA1 connects PKC-derived signals to BCL10 in the AgR-mediated activation of the IKK complex (Wang et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2002; Weil and Israel, 2004). Overexpression of CARMA1 induces BCL10 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation (Gaide et al., 2001), which is blocked in BCL10-deficient mice (Ruland et al., 2001), suggesting CARMA1 is an upstream regulator of BCL10. A portion of CARMA1 is constitutively localized within lipid rafts, interacts with BCL10 and AgR upon stimulation, and is required for recruitment of BCL10 into lipid rafts and to clustered TCR complexes (Egawa et al., 2003; Gaide et al., 2002). BCL10 was further shown to relocalize to the cytoplasmic face of the cSMAC (Schaefer et al., 2004). CARMA1 interacts with BCL10 via its CARD domain because a CARD-domain mutant of CARMA1 (L39R) shows no TCR-mediated binding to BCL10 or IKK activation (Gaide et al., 2002). The inactivation of CARMA1 in cell lines by somatic mutagenesis or RNA interference results in impaired IKK activation after TCR-CD28 stimulation (Pomerantz et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004).

Phosphorylation of the PRD region of CARMA1 by PKCβ or PKCθ (Figure 1) enables CARMA1 to recruit BCL10, TAK1, and IKKγ into lipid rafts and to initiate IKK complex activation (Matsumoto et al., 2005; Shinohara et al., 2005; Sommer et al., 2005). Because deletion of the PRD from full-length CARMA1 results in high

Figure 3. The Antigen-Receptor-Mediated Oligomerization Cascade of the CBM Signalosome and K63-Linked Ubiquitination of IKKγ Culminates in Activation of NF-κB

BCL10-MALT1 complexes from POLKADOTS are recruited to PKC-phosphorylated, trimerized, and membrane-bound CARMA1, and the formed CBM complex proceeds to oligomerize further. TRAF2 and TRAF6 are recruited to MALT1, which trimerizes and mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of IKKγ (NEMO). The activated and recruited TAK1-TAB complex, possibly including RIP1 via interaction with the FADD-caspase 8 complex, phosphorylates IKKβ, and this phosphorylation leads to IKK complex activation, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα and IκBε. The phosphorylated IκBs are polyubiquitinated by K48 chains and degraded in the 26S proteasome. Free NF-κB complexes then translocate into the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes.

amounts of constitutively active NF-κB and because in vitro experiments showed that the intramolecular binding between the CARD and PRD of CARMA1 is abolished after PKC-mediated phosphorylation (Sommer et al., 2005), it has been proposed that PRD phosphorylation destabilizes an inhibitory CARMA1 conformation. Thus, PKC-mediated CARMA1 phosphorylation leads to an active CARMA1 conformation with accessible protein-interaction sites (Figure 3). Mutation of the PKC phosphorylation sites in the PRD completely abolishes the function of CARMA1 in T cells (Matsumoto et al., 2005). In line with this finding, constitutively active PKCθ is not able to induce NF-κB activity in CARMA1-deficient Jurkat T cells (JPM50.6, Wang et al., 2002). Altogether, these results provide clear evidence for the crucial role of CARMA1 downstream of PKC and upstream of BCL10 in the activation of the AgR-mediated NF-κB signal-transduction pathway.

Besides CARMA1 and BCL10, the human paracaspase MALT1 has been identified as a caspase-like BCL10-binding protein involved in NF-κB activation (Lucas et al., 2001; Uren et al., 2000). MALT1 is characterized by an N-terminal death domain (DD) followed by two Ig-like domains and a C-terminal caspase-like domain (Figure 2) that is unable to cleave caspase substrates or mediate apoptosis (Lucas et al., 2001; Uren et al., 2000). Like BCL10, MALT1 was shown to be targeted by chromosomal translocation in some MALT lymphomas, resulting in a chimeric fusion protein between the C terminus of MALT1 and the N-terminal portion of clAP2 (an anti-apoptotic protein), which activates NF-κB (Uren et al., 2000). Under physiological circumstances, BCL10 and MALT1 physically and functionally interact to synergistically activate NF-κB after AgR engagement. One interaction occurs 13 amino acids downstream of the BCL10 CARD with the Ig-like domain of MALT1.
(Lucas et al., 2001). An additional interaction between the helix 5–6 region of the BCL10 CARD and the MALT1 N terminus has been reported, and the DD of MALT1 contributes to this interaction (Langel et al., personal communication). It is possible that an unknown partner protein contacts and bridges both molecules. Together, these data demonstrate that the functionally critical association between BCL10 and MALT1 involves a complex interaction between multiple protein domains.

Two groups have reported conflicting results in independently generated MALT1-deficient mice (Ruefli-Brasse et al., 2003; Ruland et al., 2003). Although both show a defect in cellular proliferation, IL-2 production and IKK activation after TCR stimulation, as well as the absence of defects during neurodevelopment (in contrast to the phenotype of BCL10-deficient mice), they differ in the requirement of MALT1 for AgR-dependent JNK activation and BCR-mediated NF-κB activation. The reason for this difference is unclear, but the difference may once again be due to the different targeting strategies used.

In summary, the importance of CARMA1 in transmitting the PKC-derived AgR-initiated signal to the IKK complex is to act as a scaffold to allow assembly of the important signaling intermediates BCL10, MALT1, and IKKγ for activation of NF-κB in immune cells. This CARMA1-nucleated complex has been termed the CBM or CARMA1 signalosome (Rawlings et al., 2006).

### Regulation of CBM Signalosome Recruitment and Activity

Although a fraction of CARMA1 resides constitutively in lipid rafts, at least in B cells, there is rapid and substantial recruitment of additional CARMA1 to lipid rafts after AgR stimulation (Sommer et al., 2005). The SH3 domain of CARMA1 might be of particular importance for translocation to lipid rafts because a CARMA1 mutant lacking this region fails to be recruited to lipid rafts in Jurkat T cells (Wang et al., 2002).

The N-terminal proline-rich region of PDK1, a serine-threonine kinase that was shown to recruit CARMA1 and PKCθ into lipid rafts after CD3-CD28 costimulation in Jurkat T cells, seems to be a likely target site for the CARMA1 SH3 domain (Lee et al., 2005). PDK1 and maybe other unknown adaptor proteins bring PKCθ and CARMA1 into close proximity, facilitating PKC-mediated CARMA1 phosphorylation and consequent activation (Matsumoto et al., 2005). CARMA1 then oligomerizes, likely via its CC domain (Figure 2) because this is the principal oligomerization motif (Burkhard et al., 2001). CARMA1 is thought to oligomerize first as a trimer, which triggers a downstream oligomerization cascade (Figure 3) that is ultimately necessary for recruitment of IKK to the SMAC and IKK’s subsequent activation (Hara et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2004). Because the GUK domain in other MAGUK-family proteins mediates homotypic oligomerization, a similar role for the CARMA1 MAGUK region has been proposed (Rawlings et al., 2006). The latter could amplify the AgR signal by facilitating higher-order multimerization of CARMA1 proteins.

Several lines of evidence support an essential role of such a CBM-signalosome-induced oligomerization cascade in IKK activation: (1) Oligomerization of CARMA1, BCL10, or MALT1 is sufficient to induce downstream signaling for IKK activation (Newton and Dixit, 2003; Srinivasula et al., 1999; Stilo et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2004); (2) overexpression of several of the CBM-signalosome components results in their spontaneous oligomerization in cells or in vitro (Guiet and Vito, 2000; Rawlings et al., 2006; Srinivasula et al., 1999); and (3) Overexpression of CARMA1, BCL10, MALT1, or TRAF6 alone is sufficient to induce IKK activation in the absence of other stimuli (Bertin et al., 2001; Gaide et al., 2001; Ruefli-Brasse et al., 2003; Willis et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2004).

After CARMA1 activation and oligomerization, BCL10 gets recruited to the signalosome through a CARD-CARD interaction. Deletion of either the CARMA1 CARD or the BCL10 CARD domain abolishes AgR-mediated IKK activation (Bertin et al., 2001; Gaide et al., 2002). The mechanism by which BCL10 activity is regulated in the CBM signalosome is not fully understood. A number of studies have suggested that it involves phosphorylation events, but these findings are somewhat controversial because BCL10 phosphorylation has been suggested to have positive as well as negative effects on IKK activation. The kinase Receptor Interacting Protein (RIP) 2 can associate with and phosphorylate BCL10 in response to TCR costimulation (Ruefli-Brasse et al., 2004). RIP2 is a C-terminal CARD-containing serine-threonine kinase that is required for optimal TCR-mediated NF-κB activation and IL-2 production as well as T cell proliferation and Th1 differentiation (Chin et al., 2002; Kobayashi et al., 2002). Interestingly, because RIP2 also plays an important role in innate immune pathways, it is possible that the CBM signalosome might integrate signals of the adaptive and innate immune systems by regulating pathways that lead to the activation of NF-κB. It is possible that BCL10 gets phosphorylated by RIP2 or other kinases in the cytosolic POLKADOTS and that this phosphorylation allows subsequent trimerization and association with MALT1 (Figure 1). The region between amino acids 107 and 119 of BCL10 can bind to the two Ig-like domains of MALT1 (Lucas et al., 2001), the BCL10-MALT1 complex can be recruited to the activated oligomerized CARMA1 (Figure 3), and furthermore, as-yet-uncharacterized modifications of BCL10 can lead to oligomerization of the CBM complex.

### CBM Signalosome and TRAF in IKK Activation

A breakthrough in deciphering the connection between the CBM signalosome and IKK came with the discovery that BCL10-MALT1 mediates Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of IKKγ in a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13)-dependent manner (Zhou et al., 2004). In parallel, TRAF2 and TRAF6 (Figure 2), which play central roles in the innate immune responses, were implicated as proximal downstream effectors of MALT1 and were found to possibly have redundant functions in AgR-mediated NF-κB signaling (Sun et al., 2004). Interaction with the oligomerized MALT1 activates TRAF6, and possibly TRAF2, most likely by conformational changes and stabilization of a trimerized TRAF complex (Park et al., 1999). Indeed, it was shown that TRAF oligomerization is sufficient to induce IKK activation (Baud et al., 1999). Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of TRAF6, and also TRAF2, abolished TCR-induced IKK activation (Sun et al., 2004). Nevertheless, although the requirement of TRAF6 in TCR-mediated
NF-κB signaling is relatively well established, the role of TRAF2 is less well characterized. The minimal signaling pathway from activated BCL10 to IκBα phosphorylation has been reconstituted in vitro and consists of MALT1, the E3 ligase TRAF6, the E2 dimer UBC13 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1a (UEV1a), E1, ubiquitin, the TAK1 complex, and the IKK complex (Sun et al., 2004). However, further work will be required to definitively solve the spatial and temporal roles of these proteins in IKK-complex activation.

TRAF6, and possibly TRAF2, contribute to IKK activation in T cells (Figure 3). Activated TRAF2 potentially targets RIP1 for K63 polyubiquitination, whereas activated TRAF6 is auto-K63 polyubiquitinated and mediates K63 polyubiquitination of IKKγ at lysine 399, thereby facilitating IKK activation (Sun et al., 2004). IKK activation is thought to involve binding between ubiquitinated TRAF6, the TAK1 complex consisting of TAK1, and one or more TAK1 binding proteins (TAB1-3) and the IKK complex (Rawlings et al., 2006). The exact binding partners and domains responsible are presently unknown, but one possible mechanism involves binding of TAK1 to TRAF6, leading to K63 polyubiquitination of IKKγ. Activated TAK1 in the complex could phosphorylate IKKβ on serine residues 177 and 181 and thus activate IKK kinase activity, leading to IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation (Wang et al., 2001a). In chicken DT40 B cells, TAK1 is essential for IKK activation in response to BCR stimulation (Shinohara et al., 2005). TAK1 was shown to interact with PKCβ-phosphorylated CARMA1, placing TAK1 in the CBM signalosome in close proximity with the IKK complex and thereby making it capable of phosphorylating IKKβ (Shinohara et al., 2005). However, this general model has been challenged in two studies involving conditional TAK1-deficient mice. These studies showed normal IKK activation after AgR stimulation in B cells and effector T cells but impaired JNK activation in B cells (Sato et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2006). Nevertheless, TAK1 was clearly shown to be required for TCR-induced NF-κB activation in naïve T cells and thymocytes (Liu et al., 2006; Sato et al., 2006; Wan et al., 2006).

TRAF2 catalyzes RIP1 K63 polyubiquitination, and RIP1 could in turn associate with the TAK1 complex or with the FADD-caspase 8 complex and thereby activate NF-κB (Ishizawa et al., 2006; Su et al., 2005). Thus, the FADD-caspase 8 complex may bridge the CBM signalosome and IKKα-IKKβ and thereby allow phosphorylation of the IKK complex through RIP1 (Figure 3). However, in B cell-specific conditional caspase 8-deficient mice, there was no defect in NF-κB activation in response to BCR stimulation (Beisner et al., 2005). In addition, UBC13-deficient B cells showed almost normal NF-κB activation but impaired activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs after AgR stimulation (Yamamoto et al., 2006). Therefore, although there is a large body of in vitro biochemical and cell-culture experiments that implicate regulatory ubiquitination in AgR signaling to NF-κB, there is currently less convincing genetic evidence supporting such an essential role for regulatory ubiquitination in these signaling pathways. Clearly, further work will be necessary to clarify the role of UBC13 in TCR-mediated NF-κB activation and to determine whether other E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes compensate for the absence of UBC13 in transferring K63-linked

polyubiquitin chains from the CBM signalosome to the IKK complex.

Downregulation and Modulation of the AgR-Mediated IKK Activation

Downregulation of signaling after engagement of AgR utilizes multiple strategies, including well-characterized pathways involving receptor internalization. Indeed, PKCθ participates in downregulation of activated TCRs by the TCR-recycling pathway through phosphorylation of serine 126 and the di-leucine-based receptor-sorting motif of the CD3γ chain (Figure 4) (von Essen et al., 2006). Additionally, the termination of AgR-mediated NF-κB activation pathways also involves active mechanisms such as the degradation of key signaling molecules. It has been shown that the amount of BCL10 protein is markedly reduced after AgR signaling in a process dependent on the CARD domain of BCL10. NEDD4, Itch, and cIAP2 protein mediate ubiquitination of BCL10 and its subsequent lysosomal degradation, thus down-modulating NF-κB activation (Hu et al., 2006; Scharschmidt et al., 2004). Attachment of single ubiquitin molecules, rather than ubiquitin chains, to one or multiple lysines is sufficient to target proteins to a complex sorting apparatus on the endosome. This machinery selects ubiquitinated proteins for lysosomal sorting through consecutive interactions with a variety of ubiquitin-binding domains (Urbe, 2005). Interestingly, the cIAP2-BCL10 interaction appears to be regulated by BCL10 phosphorylation; phosphorylated BCL10 is bound much more strongly to cIAP2 than is unphosphorylated BCL10 (Hu et al., 2006). Upon T cell costimulation, CBM-signalosome-activated IKKβ phosphorylates the C terminus of BCL10 and thereby disrupts association between BCL10 and MALT1 (Wegener et al., 2006) (Figure 4).

An additional strategy of downregulating NF-κB-activating pathways is through deubiquitination of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by proteins such as the tumor suppressor cylindromatosis protein (CYLD) and A20, which have been up to now mainly studied in signaling pathways triggered during the innate immune response (Rawlings et al., 2006). CYLD was shown to inactivate TRAF2, TRAF6, and IKKγ by removing the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Kovalenko et al., 2003), whereas A20 removes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from TRAF2, TRAF6, and RIP1 (Wertz et al., 2004). A20 also catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1 and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Because TRAF2, TRAF6, and RIP1 have also been reported to function in lymphocyte-activation pathways, one might speculate that similar downregulatory pathways could operate in lymphocytes. However, this hypothesis needs to be proven experimentally.

The life and death of peripheral lymphocytes is strictly controlled to maintain appropriate numbers of T and B cells. Activation-Induced Cell Death (AICD) is a form of apoptosis that is of pivotal importance for the termination of the immune response and, therefore, homeostasis of the immune system. Although initial stimulation of peripheral primary T cells leads to proliferation, restimulation of expanded T cells results in AICD. The hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK) 1 was characterized as an immunoreceptor proximal signaling protein (Liou et al., 2000) involved in the regulation of AICD in primary

Figure 4. Downregulation of the CBM Signaloosome and IKK Activity

The antigen-receptor-mediated signal to NF-κB is downregulated to keep the immune cells responsive. Activated IKKβ phosphorylates BCL10, and this phosphorylation leads to dissociation of the BCL10-MALT1 complex, where cIAP2, Itch, and NEDD4 ubiquitination of phosphorylated BCL10 leads to lysosomal degradation of BCL10. RIP1 also undergoes polyubiquitination by K48 chains and is degraded in the proteasome. PKCθ was shown to play a role in downregulation of directly engaged TCR. In a feedback loop, newly synthesized IκB binds to nuclear NF-κB and thus removes it from DNA and exports it to the cytosol. During activation-induced cell death (AICD), the C-terminal cleavage product of HPK1 binds to inactive IKKα and IKKβ, which then sequester the IKK complex in the cytosol and thereby inhibit NF-κB.

T cells (Brenner et al., 2005; Schulze-Luehrmann et al., 2002). Although the full-length serine-threonine kinase is activated by AgR engagement and recruited into lipid rafts, where it has been shown to activate JNK and enhance IKKβ phosphorylation, the C-terminal HPK1 cleavage product that is generated in AICD-sensitive primary T cells sequesters the IKK complex by binding to IKKα-IKKβ, and its binding thus leads to inhibition of TCR-mediated NF-κB activation (Brenner et al., 2005). Furthermore, the cleaved N-terminal kinase domain of HPK1 can continue to activate JNK and thus further promote apoptosis of T cells (Schulze-Luehrmann et al., 2002).

Concluding Remarks

In antigen-stimulated lymphocytes, NF-κB controls the expression of multiple genes essential for survival, proliferation, and effector function. Signaling by AgR directs lymphocyte development at crucial checkpoints to shape the immune repertoire (Hayden et al., 2006). Tremendous progress has been made in the past few years in understanding the details of AgR-mediated activation and regulation of NF-κB. Such advances have included the discovery of the crucial role of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex and the role of oligomerization, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation events in immunoreceptor-mediated IKK and JNK activation.

Aberrant NF-κB signaling is an area of particularly intensive investigation because of the link between constitutive activation of NF-κB and various lymphomas and myelomas. Upregulation of both PKCβ and CARMA1 is detectable in different lymphomas (Hans et al., 2005; Nakamura et al., 2005; Ngo et al., 2006), and constitutive NF-κB activation due to chromosomal translocations of MALT1 and BCL10 genes is a causative event in MALT lymphomas (Farinha and Gascoyne, 2005; Isaacson, 2005; Karin, 2006). Therefore, pharmacological agents directed against PKCθ in T cells, against PKCβ in B cells, or against specific components of the CBM signaloosome

in both cell types could be useful in promoting immune tolerance or for treatment of certain autoimmune disorders and lymphoid malignancies. In this respect, it is interesting to note that PKCθ-deficient mice are resistant to Th1-dependent antigen-induced arthritis (Healy et al., 2006), whereas CARMA1 was shown to be critical for the development of allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma (Medoff et al., 2006).

In conclusion, despite the tremendous progress made in understanding how antigen receptors link to the IKK complex, a number of important, outstanding questions remain. For example, the precise functions of RIP2, TAK1, TRAF2 and TRAF6, BCL10 phosphorylation, and POLKADOT formation in the AgR-mediated signaling cascade to NF-κB activation remain to be fully clarified. Especially the specific roles for TRAF2 and TRAF6 in BCR signaling remain elusive. Many of the molecules involved in AgR-mediated NF-κB activation (PKCθ, PKCβ, CARMA1, RIP2, TAK1 complex) also play important roles in JNK activation. It is therefore crucial to identify the exact point of divergence between these two pathways and to clarify whether and how components specific for JNK activation are recruited into the CBM signalosome. This is particularly true because JNK and NF-κB can control the apoptotic response in an antagonistic manner. In B cells the coupling between the NF-κB and JNK pathways is important for the antigenic response because uncoupling both signal transduction pathways leads to clonal anergy, whereas the tolerogenic response to antigens in T cells is characterized by impaired JNK and NF-κB activation. Thus, the immunological response to pathogens is the result of a precisely balanced interaction among adaptors, kinases, other enzymes, and their downstream targets, and it is clear that the pathway leading to NF-κB plays an essential and central role.
