### Abstract

During the development of the nervous system, neurons respond to the coordinated action of a variety of attractive and repulsive signals from the embryonic environment. Netrins form a family of extracellular proteins that regulate the migration of neurons and axonal growth cones. These proteins are bifunctional signals that are chemoattractive for some neurons and chemorepellent for others. Netrins mainly interact with the specific receptors DCC and UNC-5 family. To date, several Netrins have been described in mouse and humans: Netrin-1, -3/NTL2, -4/β and G-Netrins.

Netrin-1 is the most studied member of the family. It is involved in the development many projections of the nervous system. When Netrin-1 interacts with its specific receptors, a cascade of local cytoplasmic events is triggered. Several signal transduction pathways and effector molecules have been implicated in the response to Netrin-1: small Rho-GTPases, MAP-Kinases, second messengers and the Microtubule Associated Protein 1B (MAP1B).

### 1. Introduction

Information processing in the brain is determined, to a great extent, by an intricate network of neuronal connections. The sheer dimension of the task of connecting the neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) is amazing. In the adult human brain, each of its almost \(10^{12}\) neurons connects to an average of 1000 target cells, thereby forming a specific circuit whose precise pattern is crucial for the correct function of the system. How is this pattern produced with the necessary precision and reliability during embryogenesis?

During morphogenesis of the nervous system, neurons are produced in specialized regions and then migrate through defined pathways until reaching their final location. Each neuron develops a group of dendrites that are characteristic of its phenotype and an axon that extends to form specific pathways to reach its synaptic target (Fig. 1). Precision is achieved through two kinds of processes: early neural activity-independent mechanisms and refinement mechanisms, which occur later and are activity-dependent [95,219,220,235]. This review will address the role of one family of guidance molecules, the Netrin family, in activity-independent mechanisms of neuronal organization.

#### 1.1. General mechanisms of axon guidance

Neuronal migration and the guidance of axons towards their targets are regulated by mechanisms which, in many aspects, are similar to those that occur in leucocyte chemotaxis and *Dictyostelium discoideum* amoebae [38,61,66]. Neuroblasts and axons travel through the embryonic "milieu" and are guided by local signals [88] through the formation of specialized cellular structures that "explore" their surrounding environment: the growth cone in axons and the leading edge in migrating neurons [22]. These hand- or fan-like structures contain the machinery necessary to detect and respond to extracellular guidance cues and to provide the motor energy necessary for the growth of neurites. In spite of similarities, there are differences between neuroblast migration and growth cone navigation. In the former, the cell nucleus translocates in the same direction as the leading edge, retracting the posterior region of the cell body. In contrast, in growth cone navigation, the cell nucleus remains stationary and the advance of the

### Neurogenesis and migration Growth of axons and dendrites Synaptogenesis and refinement of connections

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the main steps in nervous system development. The left panel shows a picture illustrating a region with three active neurogenic areas. Newly generated neuroblasts migrate towards their final destination, directed by their leading process. Next (middle panel), axons grow toward their specific target regions. Finally (right panel), axons reach their target and establish specific synapses, some of which are refined at later stages.
growth cone leaves an elongated process behind it. Once the cone reaches its target, a new group of mechanisms is set in motion that allows the establishment and maturation of synaptic connections (Fig. 1) [72,269].

Neuroblast migration and growth cone navigation occur in a stereotyped way with very few errors, even though the target is usually located quite far away. Two mechanisms guide neuroblasts and growth cones: simple linear growth along “highways” (on adhesive substrates that allow growth), alternated with more complex decision-making behaviors in intermediate targets (Fig. 2) [43,44, 226,235]. At very early embryonic stages, the first developing axons navigate through an axon-free environment. Later on, they grow through tissues crisscrossed by other projecting axons [9]. Developing axons and migrating neuroblasts move through fascicles of pre-existing axons, switching from one fascicle to another by a process known as selective fasciculation (Fig. 3) [195,245]. In addition, axons and neuroblasts move towards groups of specialized cells that form the intermediary targets (or choice points; Fig. 2). These targets provide the extracellular guidance cues that regulate navigation, but they can also provide the trophic support necessary for the survival of developing axons. This mechanism allows the removal

of axons that follow erroneous paths or do not reach their target [76,249].

Guidance requires the integration of local adhesive interactions of the substrate with the directional information from guidance cues. The adhesion receptors transduce the signals from the extracellular substrate to the cytoskeleton, thereby providing the traction necessary to move the growth cone, while guidance cues supply the directional information through attraction or repulsion [36,155,220,267]. However, this distinction does not appear to be so strict since adhesion molecules can also provide directional information that modifies the response to cues [28,48,220, 232,267]. The growth cone integrates this information and elaborates responses, which are then translated into the reorganization of the cell cytoskeleton [220,232,267]. The differences in the nature of the response appear to reside more in the functional properties of the growth cone than in the identity of the signals themselves. However, it is only recently that the complex interactions that occur in the growth cone are coming to light.

Growing neurites respond to the coordinated action of a great variety of attractive and repulsive signals [13,14,23, 24,95,222,235,236]. The term “attractive” refers to effects that range from allowing growth to attraction. The response

In other regions, extracellular matrix components may induce the defasciculation of the developing axons, which can then grow through specific trajectories (right; adapted from [235]).

to negative cues extends from a simple deviation of the growing axon to the collapse and retraction of the growth cone. In addition, these signals can be soluble, thereby acting over large distances, or be bound to cell membranes or to the extracellular matrix, operating by contact over short distances (revised in [235]; Fig. 4). However, many molecules do not adjust to a single guidance mechanism. Instead, it is the growth cone that interprets the signal as attractive or repulsive. Furthermore, a diffusible molecule may act over a short distance, restricting its diffusion by interaction with the extracellular matrix, or a molecule anchored to substrate can be expressed through gradients, thereby acting as a long-distance chemotropic signal [41,43,49,55,63,95,123,169, 209,212,220,234,235,267].

Many molecules have been implicated in guidance, including growth-promoting factors, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and extracellular matrix molecules (ECMs).

Some of these include Reelin, Neurotrophins, growth factors such as HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Scatter Factor) and members of the TGF-β family (Transforming Growth Factor β). Other candidates include the family of protocadherins, odorant receptors, Ig-CAMs and neurexins [7,8,36,59,67,74,162,173,248,267]. In addition to these molecules, genetic, biochemical and molecular approaches have identified four conserved families of guidance signals: Netrins, Slits, Semaphorins and Ephrins. One or more receptors have been identified for each of these cues: Deleted in Colorectal Cancer, DCC (Unc40) and UNC-5, Robo, Neuropilins and Plexins, and Ephs, respectively [18,38, 50,55,78,134,151,173,176,180,190,194,229,255,267].

Finally, growing axons and neuroblasts must select and enter their final targets [88,110,245]. Once there, axons grow to determined topographic locations or cell layer. Very often, the target establishes gradients and distinct layer-

distribution of local guidance cues that control the position of the developing axons [79,87,110,175,186,261,262]. When the growth cone finds its correct synaptic target, the terminal region of the axon branches and establishes synapses. The selection of post-synaptic cells, or of precise membrane domains within these cells, may involve several molecules that could be organized in a combinatorial code [69,110,119,172,235,243]. Several studies have proposed that the selection of the correct target area is independent of the formation of synapses [110,191,192,262]. Finally, neuronal activity drives the refining of axonal projections, although this takes place after synapse formation.

### 2. The Netrin family

For decades, developmental neurobiologists searched for the chemoattractive molecules that Ramón y Cajal described as fundamental axonal guidance mechanisms [22]. The first molecules were identified in chick embryo through biochemical purification of growth-promoting factors for commissural axons in the spinal cord [124,208]. These were named Netrins (“one who guides” in Sanskrit). Two proteins (Netrin-1 and -2), of about 80 kD and with 78% of homology, were isolated. These proteins are vertebrate homologues of the UNC-6 protein of *Caenorhabditis elegans* [104,115,167, 172], a molecule related to Laminin and involved in axonal guidance and cell migration [208,209].

Most of the components of the Netrin family are secreted proteins that govern the migration of neurons and growth cones [208,209] These proteins are bifunctional signals that are chemoattractive for some neurons and chemorepellent for others, and can act as long or short range signals [123] (for reviews: [49,50,123,151,173,193]). The secondary structure of the family is highly conserved in all species (Fig. 5). From the amino-terminal end, these proteins present a signal peptide, followed by a domain named VI, a homologue of the globular domain VI of Laminin, and three domains called V-1, V-2 and V-3, which are EGF repetitions found in region V of the Laminin chains. The C-terminal domain is the part that varies greatest between species. This part is called C or NTR domain and is related to a domain found in Frizzled and in some proteins of the Complement [208]. C-terminal sequences are rich in basic amino acids, which act as binding sites for Heparin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans or membrane glycolipids, thereby allowing interaction with components of the extracellular matrix or cell surface. Thus, the diffusion of secreted Netrins is determined by both their level of expression and the concentration of binding sites in the surrounding tissue [118,123].

In general, Netrins act during the development and control a wide range of outgrowing axons and migrating neurons (Fig. 6). To carry out their function, Netrins interact with specific receptors that belong to two protein families: DCC and UNC-5 [1,32,121,129,140]. Netrins act either over large (a few millimetres; [264]) or short distances [259], depending on their local affinity for the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix [123,124,208].

Netrins are expressed in the midline of all the animals with bilateral symmetry that have been studied. To date, several Netrins have been described in invertebrates: a single Netrin has been identified in *C. elegans* (Unc6; [115]), *Ciona intestinalis* (GI: 7544126) and in *Branchiostoma floridae* (amphinetrin, [213]), and two, Netrin-A and Netrin-B, have been reported in *Drosophila* [104,115,172]. Vertebrates show greater diversity. In Zebrafish and chicken, Netrin-1 and -2 have been reported [208], although only Netrin-1 has been described in *Xenopus laevis* [56]. In mice, humans and rats, Netrin-1, -3/NTL2, -4/β and G-Netrins have been cloned [127,147,167,177,178,193,209,244,251, 265,266] (Fig. 6). The classical Netrins (Netrin-1, -2, -3/ NTL2, -G) are more closely related to the Laminin γ chains than to other chains of this protein. In contrast, the Netrin-4/ β is more related to Laminin β chains (Fig. 5). Although

Classic Netrins (Netrin-1, -2 and -3) and Netrins-G present regions with high homology with the V and VI domains of Laminin γ chain. In contrast, Netrin-4/β is closely related to domains V and VI of the chain of Laminin. C, C′, C-terminal domains related to a domain found in Frizzled and in some proteins of the Complement.

mesoderm, mammary gland, pancreas, dorsal aorta and cardiac muscle. In the adult, it is highly expressed in spinal cord neurons and oligodendrocytes and in other organs such as the ovaries [54,124,151,159,160,223].

One of the clear functions of Netrin-1, both in vertebrates and invertebrates, is the demarcation of the midline, where it acts as a guide for distinct axon populations. In vitro, Netrin-1 attracts and stimulates the outgrowth of commissural axons at several levels of the CNS, such as commissural axons in the spinal cord [124,209], the internal arcuate fibers of the dorsal column-medial lemniscal system [133], the axons that leave the cerebellum to cross the floor plate [214] and inferior olivary axons [2,12,29]. The phenotype of *netrin-1*-deficient mice indicates the participation of Netrin-1 in axon guidance towards the midline, also at more rostral levels, since these mice lack the main forebrain commissures: the corpus callosum, the hippocampal commissure and the anterior commissure, although they conserve the habenular and posterior commissures [209].

Furthermore, in the midline, Netrin-1 may act as a barrier for those axons that must not cross the midline. In this regard, Netrin-1 repels trochlear [42] and cranial [100] motor axons in vitro, thereby mimicking the floor plate.

However, data in vivo obtained from mice deficient in *netrin-1* show that this scenario is more complex. As expected from the results in vitro, the mutation of the *netrin-1* gene in the mouse produces severe defects in the projection of commissural axons of the spinal cord. Although these axons growth ventrally, they do not reach the floor plate [209]. In vitro, floor plate explants from

Several families of vertebrate Netrin receptors are shown together with the homologous proteins in *C. elegans* and *Drosophila*. In addition, the receptor-specific responses and known modulators of each pathway are included (adapted from [267]).

**netrin-1** in mouse [209] and humans [167] is orthologous to chick *netrin-1*, in these organisms, no orthologous gene to chick *netrin-2* has been found (Fig. 7). The expression pattern of *netrin-1* in mouse appears to be the result of the distribution of mRNA of chick *netrin-1* and -2. This observation indicates that, in mouse and humans, Netrin-1 may perform the functions that correspond to chick Netrin-1 and -2 [124,193,208,209]. The proposed phylogenetic tree of several of these Netrins is shown in Fig. 7.

### 2.1. Netrin-1

Netrin-1 is the most studied member of the family. In all the vertebrates analyzed, it is expressed in the floor plate and in neuroepithelial cells of the ventral region of the spinal cord during development. In the brain, the expression pattern is also highly conserved [124,138,152,209]. In addition to the midline and the ventral ventricular zone, transcripts can be found in other structures, such as the ganglionic eminence, internal capsule, the fimbria, the lateral septum and the external germinal layer of the cerebellum [6,152,208]. Outside the nervous system, *netrin-1* is expressed in the limb-primordium, somatic

Fig. 7. Proposed phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of several Netrins described in distinct species (based on [178,265]). Phylogenetical analysis shows that Netrins-G form a subfamily, which seems to have evolved independently from the other Netrins ([178,265]). Netrin-4/β is more distantly related to Netrins 1-3 than any of these three Netrins are to each other ([265]).

netrin-1-deficient embryos do not stimulate the outgrowth of commissural axons in the spinal cord but still chemoattract them. This indicates that the floor plate produces other factors that participate in guiding commissural axons [209]. The same situation might occur during the guidance of trochlear axons, because their trajectory is correct in netrin-1 mutant mice [209]. The morphogen Sonic Hedgehog acts as a chemoattractant for spinal commissural axons through the Patched receptor, indicating that Netrin-1 and Sonic Hedgehog cooperate in guiding commissural axons in the spinal cord [34].

In addition to its function in the midline, Netrin-1 is involved in the development of other main projections of the nervous system. In vitro, Netrin-1 attracts and promotes the outgrowth of thalamo-cortical axons, and in vivo, it is required for their correct development [16]. In netrin-1-deficient mice, the growth of retinal ganglion cell axons to the optic disc is unaffected; however, axons fail to exit to the optic nerve, which results in optic nerve hypoplasia [58]. Netrin-1 is also involved in guiding cortical efferents [75,166]. Netrin-1 attracts the growth cones of corticofugal axons [166,196] and, as commented, this protein is also required for some of these axons to cross the midline, which then form the corpus callosum [166,209]. In addition, Netrin-1 is probably also necessary for the correct development of the cortico-spinal tract [75]. Furthermore, it plays a key role during the development of hippocampal projections: in vitro, it attracts hippocampal and septohippocampal axons, while its absence, in vivo, produces serious alterations not only in commissural fibers of the hippocampus but also in the entorhinohippocampal connection, and even in the connection that associates region CA3 with CA1 [6,185]. Netrin-1 also attracts circumferential habenular [82] and cerebellofugal axons [214], and in the cerebellum, it repels the parallel fibers of the cerebellar granule cells [2].

It is interesting that Netrin-1 acts not only as a bifunctional signalling molecule for repulsion or attraction, but also that the response to Netrin-1 changes throughout development in the same system. For instance, in retinal ganglion cells of Xenopus, while young retinal axons are attracted by Netrin-1, later on it repels the same axons, a change that has been proposed to depend on the maturation of the retinal ganglion cells, which down-regulate cAMP, and adenosine A2b and DCC receptors, as development progresses [41,212].

In addition to its functions in axonal guidance, there is some evidence on the involvement of Netrin-1 in neuronal migration. In nematodes, the only Netrin described, UNC-6, regulates the dorso-ventral migration of cells [32,247]. In vertebrates, Netrin-1 is involved in the development of the striatum [102]: in vitro, it repels the cells in the striatal ventricular zone, suggesting that in vivo it may direct them towards the striatal primordium, where they differentiate into striatal neurons. Netrin-1 may also play a crucial role in the migration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain [102,152], cerebellar granule cells [1] and of neurons that

release luteinizing, antidiuretic and oxytocin hormones in the hypothalamus [57,205]. It also regulates the migration of distinct populations of pre-cerebellar neurons such as inferior olive [12,29] and pontine neurons [2,12,29,264]. The function of Netrin-1 in cell migration in this region is supported, in vivo, by the absence of pontine nuclei and by the severe atrophy of the inferior olivary complex in netrin-1-deficient mice [12,209]. In the olfactory system, Netrin-1 may be involved in the rostral migratory pathway and possibly in the development and regeneration of the olfactory epithelium [4,174].

Recently, it has been described that Netrin-1 is a chemorepellent cue for oligodendrocyte precursors in the embryonic spinal cord, where it helps their initial dispersal by directing them in a dorsal direction [116,117,242]. Similarly, oligodendrocyte precursors in the developing optic nerve are repelled by Netrin-1 in the base of the third ventricle [116,221,227,241]. Interestingly, *netrin-1* is expressed in multiple types of neurons and in myelinated oligodendrocytes in the adult spinal cord. Here, Netrin-1 is not freely soluble but is associated with membranes or extracellular matrix. These data may indicate a short-range function of Netrin-1 in maintaining correct neuronal-oligodendrogial interactions in the mature nervous system [159]. Recently, it has been proposed that the main mode of Netrin-1 signalling in the adult spinal cord may be through UNC-5H receptors [160].

Finally, the involvement of Netrin-1 and its signalling pathway in non-neuronal tissue has received little attention. This protein is expressed in semicircular channels and in the cochlea, the surface of the developing tongue, in some groups of developing muscles in the neck, and also in osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Netrin-1 is essential for the morphogenesis of different branching structures such as semicircular channels in the inner ear, mammary gland, pancreas and lung [54,152,199,223,238]. For instance, Netrin-1 modulates the morphogenic response of lung endoderm to exogenous FGFs [150]. Similarly, this protein has been implicated in pancreatic development, where Netrin-1/integrin interactions induce the adhesion and migration of pancreatic progenitor cells [263].

### 2.2. Netrin-3/NTNL2

In 1997, Van Raay and collaborators identified the second human Netrin [244]. Initially, they believed that it was orthologous to chick Netrin-2 and it was named NTN2L (Netrin-2-like); however, it was later established that this second human Netrin was orthologous to murine Netrin-3 [154,193,251].

The properties of murine Netrin-3 differ markedly from other members of this family, like Netrin-1 and -2. Netrin-3 is also less similar to UNC-6 than these classical Netrins (Fig. 7). During the development of the peripheral nervous system, *netrin-3* is expressed in motor, sensory and sympathetic neurons, and in mesenchymal and muscle cells
[207,251]. However, it is largely absent in the embryonic CNS, with expression being restricted to the motor column in the ventral spinal cord (E11.5–E15.5) and to the embryonic thalamus (E11.5–E12.5). By Northern blot analysis, the expression of *netrin-3* has been described in the brain from E14.5 to adult stages [154,193,244,251] (Fig. 8).

Little is known about the role of Netrin-3 in axonal guidance. This protein promotes the axonal outgrowth of spinal commissural axons, with a lower efficiency than Netrin-1 [193,244,251]. This may be due to the fact that Netrin-3 binds to DCC receptors with lower affinity than to other Netrin receptors. This observation indicated that Netrin-3 acts mainly through Netrin receptors other than DCC [251]. In line with this, Netrin-3 repels trochlear axons [251], but there is no data available on other neural structures. Further in vitro experiments, extending the early data by Wang and co-workers [251], and in vivo analysis of mice lacking the *netrin-3* gene must be performed [193,244,251].

### 2.3. Netrin-4/β

The Netrins described above, together with Netrins-G (see below), have a greater homology with the Laminin γ chain than with chains α and β. Recently, a new member of the Netrin family, *netrin-4/β*, has been cloned in mammals (mice and humans; [127,265]): although the size and secondary structure predicted for this Netrin are almost identical to those described above, its amino acid sequence is more similar to the β chain than to the γ chain of Laminin (Figs. 5 and 7).

In mouse, *netrin-4/β* is expressed in basal membranes of several embryonic and adult tissues. In the embryonic CNS, its expression is high in the retina, the olfactory bulb and in some ventricular regions, and low in the embryonic spinal cord, where it is produced specifically by cells situated on the lateral margin of the floor plate. In the postnatal brain, it is expressed selectively in cerebellar granule cells and in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus; *netrin-4/β* is also found in a limited group of fiber tracts, including the lateral olfactory tract and the vomeronasal nerve (Fig. 8). In vitro, Netrin-4/β stimulates the neuritic outgrowth of explants of the olfactory bulb and probably stabilizes contacts between developing neurites, thereby contributing to fasciculation [127,265].

In the vascular system *netrin-4/β* is found in the basement membrane of blood vessels and may play a key role in angiogenesis. It is also expressed in large amounts in the basal membranes of other organs, predominantly in the kidney, ovary and the perimysium of the heart [127,265].

### 2.4. Netrins-G

Finally, Nakashiba and co-workers [177] described the Netrin-G subfamily. Characterized predominantly by their binding to the cell membrane via glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI), these Netrins present variants that are presumably generated by alternative splicing [177]. Neither

C. elegans nor *Drosophila melanogaster* have orthologous genes to Netrins-G. These proteins present greater homology with the γ chains of Laminin than with the β chains, but appear to have evolved independently from classic Netrins (Figs. 5 and 7).

To date, two members of this subfamily have been described, Netrin-G1 with six isoforms (Netrin-G1a-f) and Netrin-G2 with three isoforms (Netrin-G2a-c). These two genes are expressed preferentially in the CNS and show a complementary distribution in most areas of the brain (Fig. 8) [177,178]. They are expressed by E12 and reach their highest expression levels during perinatal stages in the thalamus, mitral cells of the olfactory bulb and cerebellar deep nuclei.

None of the multiple isoforms of Netrin-G1 bind any of the Netrin receptors (DCC or UNC-5). *netrin-G1* is highly expressed in thalamic axons, and in vitro, thalamic and neocortical neurons extended long neurites on immobilized recombinant Netrin-G1 or Netrin-G2 [147,177,178]. Recently, Lin and co-workers identified a human Netrin-G1 Ligand (NGL-1), a transmembrane protein containing LRR and Ig domains [147]. NGL-1 interacts with Netrin-G1 through its LRR region. NGL-1 is highly expressed in the striatum and the cerebral cortex (the intermediate and final target, respectively, of thalamocortical axons expressing Netrin-G1). Surface-bound NGL-1 stimulates the growth of embryonic thalamic axons. In addition, in vitro assays demonstrate that NGL-1 activity may be mediated at least partially by Netrin-G1. All these results indicate that Netrin-G1 may be a crucial component of the NGL-1 receptor complex to promote the outgrowth of thalamocortical axons. On the other hand, the Netrins-G may, like other molecules anchored to the membrane through GPI [20], trigger intracellular transduction cascades. Therefore, Netrins-G1/NGL-1 may act as a bi-directional signal, as previously proposed for the Ephrin/Eph system [53].

In the adult brain, *netrins-G1* and -G2 are expressed in the interneurons in the hippocampus, in the perforant pathway from the entorhinal cortex and in the olfactory pathways from the piriform cortex. They may be involved in neuronal plasticity in these circuits, which are associated with cognitive and sensorial functions [177,178].

Given that Netrins-G are found only in vertebrates and are predominantly bound to the cell surface, they may have arisen as precise, short-range bidirectional signals for the construction of the complex neuronal circuitries of the vertebrate brain [177,178].

## 3. Netrin receptors

The attraction and repulsion responses produced by Netrin-1 are mediated by two receptor families: DCC and UNC-5 proteins [99,151]. These two families belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and cross the membrane only once [56,111]. The DCC receptors mediate mainly attraction

but also participate in repulsion (Figs. 6 and 11). UNC-5 receptors appear to act in repulsion only, alone or in combination with DCC receptors. UNC-5 receptors may require the participation of DCC as a co-receptor when acting far from the source of Netrin-1 and when the concentration of the ligand is low. The current model proposes that the DCC/UNC-5 receptor complex mediates long-range repulsion, while UNC-5 homodimers (or heterodimers with unknown co-receptors) act for short distance repulsion (Fig. 11) [64, 106, 111, 122].

3.1. The DCC family

The *dcc* gene (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) was isolated when it was cloned from a region of the 18q chromosome, which is commonly deleted in metastatic colorectal cancer in humans [39, 71, 129]. The expression of *dcc* is very high in the CNS and it is normally associated with the basal lamina of several epithelia such as in the gastrointestinal tract, skin, lung and bladder [40, 107]; *dcc* is also expressed in the prostate [137]. DCC may participate in

axonal guidance, as suggested by its homology with the *unc-40* gene of *C. elegans*, a receptor of UNC-6 involved in guiding axons and migrating neurons [32, 106]. UNC-40 in *C. elegans*, Frazzled in *Drosophila* and DCC and Neogenin in vertebrates belong to the DCC family [32, 40, 45, 56, 121, 129, 246]. DCC and Neogenin are type I transmembrane receptors that share sequence similarity with NCAM [39, 121]. They contain four immunoglobulin domains, six type III Fibronectin repetitions and a cytoplasmic domain with no homology with other known proteins. The cytoplasmic domains of these receptors contain three regions with high homology between distinct species named P1, P2 and P3 [111, 129] (Fig. 10).

UNC-40, the only gene of the family present in *C. elegans*, guides mesodermic and neuronal cells [32, 106]. DCC and Neogenin appear to have diverged from a common ancestor to specialize in vertebrates. While the mRNA of *dcc* is predominantly expressed in the developing CNS and in epithelia, the mRNA of *neogenin* is detected in a wide range of embryonic tissues, mainly in those derived from the mesoderm (Fig. 9) [83].

In zebrafish, chicken, mouse and human, neogenin has been cloned [120, 167, 246]. Its involvement in axonal guidance has not been demonstrated, although its high expression in the axons of retinal ganglion cells at the beginning of their extension indicates that it may participate in this process [83, 84, 246]. In addition, the expression levels of neogenin in the nervous system tend to increase during development (in contrast to *dcc*, Fig. 9), suggesting that these two receptors perform complementary functions. Although neogenin-deficient mutant mice do not show severe defects in the nervous system, this receptor is required for the correct development of mammary glands [203, 223].

The DCC protein is detected in specific axon populations, in particular in those that form large tracts of fasciculated axons, such as the lateral olfactory tract, the internal capsule, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, the fimbria/fornix complex, the *fasciculus retroflexus* and the *estrius medularis* [6, 83, 151, 216].

Mice that are *dcc* deficient show a phenotype similar to netrin-1-deficient mice and lack the main commissures of the CNS [70]. Thus, mice deficient for *dcc* show alterations in commissural fibers in the spinal cord and lack the corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, pontine nuclei and a new ectopic commissure in the interface between the midbrain and the hind-brain [70]. The anterior commissure is present in this mutant, although it is severely reduced. In the habenular commissure, which remains intact in these mutants, *dcc* is highly expressed. This observation indicates that other guidance mechanisms may be involved in the development of this structure. Moreover, the wide expression pattern of *dcc* points to its possible involvement in the development of more axonal tracts than those demonstrated by the analysis of mice lacking the *dcc* [70].

The perinatal mortality of *dcc*- and netrin-1-deficient mutant mice makes the analysis of postnatal functions of the Netrin-1/DCC signalling system in these models impossible [70, 209]. The identification of a spontaneous mutation that truncates the *dcc* transcript (mutant *dcc*-kanga), viable until adulthood, has allowed the determination of the crucial role of these molecules in the postnatal development of the corticospinal projection and has opened up an array of possible studies [75]. This mutant lacks the corticospinal tract (from the funiculus), the corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, anterior commissure and the pontine nuclei. Furthermore, the observation that the absence of the exon that corresponds to the P3 domain in the kanga allele specifically prevents forebrain axons from crossing the midline, provides confirmation in vivo on the requirement of this DCC domain for Netrin-1-mediated attraction in the midline [75].

During the development of the visual and the olfactory systems, *dcc* is also expressed [4, 57, 84]. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), *dcc* is found in the developing spinal, segmental and sciatic nerves, and in sensory ganglia

and their associated axonal projections, as well as in the early developmental phase of the enteric nervous system [206].

Netrin-1 binds directly to DCC, specifically at the 5th repetition of the Fibronectin III motif [89], thereby inducing its multimerization through the association between the P3 domains, a process required for an attractive response [111, 225]. In vitro, DCC may be cleaved by metalloproteases in the region close to the plasma membrane, presumably originating a non-functional DCC form [86]. Therefore, metalloprotease inhibitors may stimulate the response to Netrin-1 and provide a possible regulatory mechanism for guiding axons and migrating neurons in vivo [86].

Corset and co-workers [46] postulate that the true Netrin-1 receptor is the adenosine receptor A2b, while DCC may act only as a co-receptor. According to their hypothesis, the activation of the A2b receptor (which is coupled to G proteins) induces the activation of adenylate cyclase and thus the accumulation of cAMP (revised by [73]), thereby triggering an attractive response. Stein and co-workers then showed that Netrin-1 binds directly to DCC, although they did not rule out the possibility that the A2b receptor acts as a co-receptor in some systems. In addition, it is likely that the activation of the A2b receptor enhances the chemotactic response to Netrin-1. Therefore, as we will discuss later, given that Netrin-1 belongs to the group I of guidance molecules (see Second messengers section, Fig. 15) and its activity is modulated by cAMP [170], increased levels of cAMP produced by activation of the A2b receptor would enhance the chemotactic response to Netrin-1.

It should be noted that DCC was initially isolated as a tumour suppressor gene [39, 71]. DCC has been shown to induce apoptosis conditionally, functioning as a dependence receptor. DCC induces apoptosis unless it is engaged by its ligand, Netrin-1. This notion is supported in vivo by massive neuronal death in the inferior olivary nucleus in the absence of Netrin-1 [153]. Recently, it has been reported that DCC functions as a conditional tumor suppressor, because it acquires their suppressive activity only in the context of regions with low ligand accessibility, whereas DCC accelerates tumor development in regions of high ligand concentration [161]. DCC participates in the regulation of apoptosis by mechanisms dependent on Caspases 3 and 9 that requires DIP13α as a mediator [17, 35, 149, 153, 163]. These observations open up the possibility that Netrin-1 may also regulate cell death in the developing nervous system.

### 3.2. The UNC-5 family

The receptors of the UNC-5 family include UNC-5 of *C. elegans* [141] and its four vertebrate homologues: UNC-5H1, UNC-5H2, UNC-5H3/RCM and UNC-5H4 [1, 68, 140]. These receptors also cross the membrane only

once (Fig. 10) and bind with high affinity to Netrins [121,140]. Their extracellular domains consist of two Ig domains, to which Netrin-1 binds [89], and two type I thrombospondin domains (TSP). The cytoplasmic domain of the UNC-5 receptors include at least three conserved regions: a ZU-5 domain (also found in *Zonula occludens-1*) [204], a DB motif [111] and a carboxy-terminal domain named “death domain” (DD) [109] (Fig. 10).

The data obtained to date converge in a model in which the DCC receptors mediate attraction and, in some cases, also repulsion, while the UNC-5 receptors act in repulsion only [64,111,122]. While attraction by Netrin-1 involves the multimerization of the DCC receptors through their association with their cytoplasmic P3 domain [224], repulsion depends on the interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of DCC (P1) and UNC-5 (CB domain) [111,224,225]. The formation of this complex produces a change in response to Netrin-1 from attraction to repulsion (Fig. 11; see last section of this review).

Like DCC, the presence UNC-5H1, UNC-5H2 or UNC-5H3 receptors induce apoptosis in the absence of Netrin-1 [35,153,164,237], whereas the presence of this ligand inhibits this process. To date, little is known about the

Netrin

Fig. 11. Model of attraction and repulsion mediated by Netrin-receptors. Netrin binding to DCC causes DCC clustering via its P3 domain and promotes attraction. To repel axons at low Netrin concentrations, UNC-5 uses DCC as a co-receptor and binds to the DCC P1 domain. UNC-5 can act independently of DCC to repel axons at higher Netrin concentrations. Adapted from [64].

molecular mechanisms involved in these responses. Like DCC, UNC-5H receptors are substrates of caspases in vitro, and this cleavage appears to be required for the induction of cell death. Proteins proposed to be involved in this process include p53 [233] and NRAGE, a protein of the MAGE family (Melanoma antigen), expressed in the proliferative cell populations in the early developing nervous system [256].

### 3.3. Integrins

The expression of vertebrate netrins has been detected not only in the nervous system, but also in a number of epithelial tissues, where their function has remained largely unknown [127, 199]. Using the embryonic pancreas as a model, Yebra and collaborators [263] recently provided evidence for Netrin-1/integrin interactions. They show that Netrin-1 is expressed in a discrete pancreatic cell population, binding to elements of the extracellular matrix. The study also identifies epithelial integrins α6β4 and α3β1 as Netrin-1 receptors in this system. This study demonstrates that the neural chemoattractant Netrin-1 is an adhesive and migratory cue for CK19+/PDX1+ pancreatic progenitors, thus indicating that Netrin-1/integrin interactions may regulate developmental processes in epithelial tissues [263].

### 4. Signalling pathways activated by Netrin-1

One hundred years after that Ramon y Cajal described the importance of the growth cone [22], numerous experiments have shown that its motility and guidance depend on the subjacent actin and microtubule cytoskeleton.

[63, 131, 220, 228]. When a guidance signal interacts with its specific receptor on the surface of the growth cone, a cascade of cytoplasmic events is triggered (Fig. 12), thereby promoting the reorganization of the associated cytoskeleton to generate a range of responses to the guidance cue: growth, retraction, arrest or reduction in speed, turning and fasciculation.

Growth cones are compartmentalized in subcellular structures: a peripheral domain that consists of filopodia and lamellipodia (made up mainly of actin), a central domain that contains microtubules and membranous organelles and a transition zone characterized by membrane rufflings in which both components of the cytoskeleton interact (Fig. 13; revised in: [131, 173, 228]).

Filopodia act as sensors: the contact of the leading edge of a single filopodium with the appropriate extracellular target is sufficient to alter the trajectory of the developing axon [37, 183]. When guidance cues interact with their receptors, a reorganization of actin filaments in the peripheral domain of the growth cone is produced, which induce microtubule reorganization. The asymmetric extension of the microtubules is followed by the invasion of organelles, thereby completing the turning. [200, 270].

Neuronal migration is more complex. After the leading edge advance, the nucleus translocates in the same direction and the trailing retraction. This process requires a wide range of cytoplasmic signals that differ from local transduction associated with growth cone motility. However, the structural, functional and molecular characteristics described for the growth cone guidance could be applicable to the leading edge of migrating neurons [105, 135, 184]. The leading edge of migrating neuroblasts and the axonal growth cone receive multiple signals simultaneously, which

When Netrin-1 interacts with its specific receptors (DCC or UNC-5), it activates downstream signaling molecules, thereby promoting the reorganization of the cytoskeleton (through Cytoskeleton associated proteins) to generate distinct guidance responses. cAMP/PKA: cAMP-protein kinase A pathway ([15, 219]), PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase pathway; ([170]) PLC: Phospholipase-C pathway ([170]); GTPases Rho pathway, activated by GEFs (Guanine nucleotide exchange factors; [143, 211]); MAPKs: MAP-Kinases pathway ([25]), MAP1B: Microtubule Associated Protein 1B ([60]); Unc115/AbLIM putative actin binding protein Unc115/AbLIM ([93]); cGMP/PKG: cGMP-Protein Kinase G pathway ([219]).

Fig. 13. Illustration summarizing the organization of the cytoskeleton at the growth cone. Actin filaments are organized into parallel filaments in filopodia and into networks in lamellipodia. Microtubules form stable bundles in the axon shaft. Single dynamic microtubule filaments also emerge into the body and filopodia of the growth cone, extending and retracting in response to several signals at the peripheral region of the growth cone (based in [65]).

must be integrated to produce a response [220,267]. Although the integration mechanisms are still unclear, several signal transduction pathways and effector molecules have been implicated in the guidance and motility of the growth cone (Fig. 12; revised in: [114,157,173,187,220]). These will be discussed in relation to the Netrin-1 signalling cascade.

### 4.1. Small Rho GTPases

Rho GTPases form a subfamily of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases (revised in: [3,157,179]). They are considered molecular switches that translate signals from the extracellular stimuli to the actin cytoskeleton and then to the nucleus. Rho GTPases cycle between active and inactive states through the binding of guanine nucleotides. In their GTP-bound state, Rho GTPases interact with effector proteins and are then considered active. Two types of protein facilitate the alternation between these two states: the GEFs (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors) stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating these factors, and GAPs (GTPase Activating Proteins), which contribute to the inactivation of Rho GTPases by increasing endogenous GTPase activity [157,228].

The interaction of guidance cues with their receptors activates certain members of this family, presumably through GAPs and GEFs (TRIO, Ephexin, etc.). However, most of the components involved in these pathways are still unknown. The best studied Rho GTPases, Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA, have been implicated in the control of lamellipodial and filopodial dynamics in fibroblasts. The activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulates the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, while RhoA enhances the formation of stress fibers and adhesion foci [132,182,197,198]. The filopodia and lamellipodia of the growth cone and leading edge are structurally analogous to those found in fibroblasts. Rho GTPases play a key role in the regulation of motility in both structures.

In neurons, the current model proposes that the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulates axonal growth while the

activation of RhoA inhibits growth or induces the collapse
of the growth cone (revised by [63,101,157,173,179]). The
activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 by an attractive signal is
translated through distinct effectors (PAK1, N-WASP,
ROCK, etc.) [3]. Active Cdc42 and Rac1 produce a
decrease in retrograde flow and in the depolymerization
rate of actin, thereby inducing an increase in the generation
of new filaments and, consequently, an induction of axonal
growth. In contrast, repulsive cues generally inhibit Rac1
and Cdc42 and activate RhoA, thus producing the opposite
effects.

Although Rho GTPases are considered key elements in
the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton from yeasts to
humans, several studies have shown that they can directly
regulate microtubules (revised in: [260]). Rac1 and Cdc42
stabilize microtubules through PAK by inhibiting Stathmin,
a microtubule-destabilizing protein [52]. In addition, these
two GTPases form a tripartite complex, Rac1/Cdc42 with
IQGAP1 and CLIP-170, which captures the positive edge of
the microtubules and stabilizes it [80,98].

The response of the growth cone to a guidance signal
may be determined more by the activation balance of Rho
GTPases than by the activation state of one of the members
of the family in particular [63,148,187]. Thus, the interaction
of guidance signals with their receptors on the surface
of the growth cone produces spatial differences in the
activation state of the members of the Rho family. This
stimulates the asymmetric activation of effector molecules,
which leads to the asymmetric reorganization of the
cytoskeleton, thereby determining the direction of the
movement of the migrating cell or axonal growth cone
[3,63,131,157,228,260].

Recent studies report that Rho GTPases are essential
components in axonal response to Netrin-1 during neuronal
development. Ectopic expression of DCC in neuroblastoma
cells produce a Netrin-1 dependent activation of Cdc42 and
Rac1 [211]. This activation increases the number of
filopodia (regulated by Cdc42) and the cell surface area
(dependent on Rac1) (Fig. 14). Therefore, DCC transduces
two simultaneous signals through Cdc42 and Rac1
[157,217,254]. This finding is consistent with the observation
that the formation of silencer receptor complex (Slit-
Robo-DCC, see later) blocks the turning response induced
by Netrin-1, whereas the induction of neuritic growth is
maintained. Shekarabi and Kennedy [211] proposed that the
Netrin-1/DCC system regulates the movement of axons
through asymmetric activation of the DCC molecules
present in the filopodia of the growth cone. This process
would lead to the asymmetric activation of GTPase
effectors, which may induce the neuritic outgrowth in a
particular direction. Li and co-workers [143] confirmed the
role of these two GTPases and provided evidence that the
inhibition of RhoA and its effector, Rho-Kinase A, increases
the capacity of DCC to induce neuritic growth (Fig. 14).

Therefore, the asymmetric binding of Netrin-1 to the
surface of the growth cone may lead to the local activation

Fig. 14. Netrin-1 acts through the small GTPases Rho: Rac1, Cdc42 and
RhoA. Local DCC activation by Netrin-1 promotes filopodia formation (via
Cdc42) and, simultaneously, neuritic outgrowth (via Rac1), which leads to
an attractive response. At the same time the Rho A-Rho-Kinase pathway is
inhibited, increasing the capacity of DCC to induce neuritic growth.

of Cdc42 and Rac1, thereby stimulating the reorganization
of the actin cytoskeleton and producing the turning of the
cone. However, the intermediary effector molecules of this
process are still unknown. The cytoplasmic domain of DCC
does not interact physically with Rac1 [143], although it
contains several PXXP domains that can bind to the SH3
domains of other proteins. Li and co-workers [143] first
suggested that UNC-73, an orthologous gene of TRIO, that
codifies for a GEF, acts on both Rac1 and Rho, playing a
crucial role during development and axonal guidance [10].
However, they later proposed the participation of the
adaptor molecule Nck1 [142]. These authors showed that
Nck1 interacts constitutively with DCC through its SH3 domain, so that Netrin-1 binding produces a DCC-dependent conformational change in Nck1, which activates Rac1 and stimulates neuritic outgrowth [142].

At the same time, Gitai and co-workers [93] analyzed the possible effector molecules in *C. elegans*. Their results are consistent with previous studies. They propose a model in which UNC-40 (orthologous to DCC) activates two independent pathways. One is activated from its P2 domain and involves the Rac GTPase of *C. elegans*, CED-10, and leads to the restructuring of actin through the UNC-115 effector (homologue of the vertebrate abLIM). The other pathway involves the P1 motif of UNC-40, which recruits (directly or indirectly) UNC-34 (homologue of Enable), a protein that acts on actin filaments in vitro [90,91] and that may participate in both UNC-40-mediated attraction and repulsion [93,268].

Consistent with this vision, the small Rho GTPases are also involved in Netrin-1-dependent neuronal migration. Causeret and co-workers [30] recently showed that Cdc42/Rac1 are required for the initial extension of the leading processes of precerebellar neurons, whereas nuclear migration depends on RhoA/B/C activity.

### 4.2. Second messengers

The levels of second messengers such as cAMP, cGMP and Ca²⁺ may regulate the response of the growth cone to a particular cue [112,169]. Studies on cultured spinal neurons from *Xenopus* have distinguished two groups of guidance molecules in the function of their dependence on second messengers (Fig. 14; [27,219]. Group I is formed by Netrin-1, Acetylcholine, BDNF, MAG (Myelin-associated-glycoprotein) and NGF; the response to these signals is dependent on intracellular Ca²⁺, requires the coactivation of PI₃K

(PI-3 Kinase) and PLCγ (Phospholipase C-γ), and the type of response depends on the levels of cAMP and on the activation of PKA (Protein Kinase A). In group II, composed of Sema 3A and NT3, the response is independent of Ca²⁺ and PI₃K and is regulated by cGMP and PKG (Protein Kinase G). This indicates the presence of two separate groups of guidance signals with specific transduction pathways [219] (Fig. 15).

Netrin-1 has been included in the Group I of guidance molecules (Fig. 15) [27,169]. Thus, increased levels of cAMP enhance attraction, while low levels induce repulsion [169,181], although Netrin-1 does not activate PKA in embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons [15]. In the same study, Bouchard and co-workers identify a novel modulatory role for PKA in the growth cone, which regulates the translocation of DCC to the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing axonal extension in response to Netrin-1. This study proposes that axons modulate receptor availability at the cell surface, in response to concentrations of guidance cues.

PI₃K has been implicated in the Netrin-1 transduction pathway in neurons [170]. Although PI₃K activates Rac1 in many cell types [101], it remains to be determined whether it is an intermediary between DCC and Rac1. The demonstration that PKA inhibition converts the Netrin-1-mediated attraction in repulsion is coherent with this model [169]. The activation of RhoA is inhibited after phosphorylation by PKA [136], which stimulates the attraction to Netrin-1 [211].

Recent data in *Xenopus* show that while DCC-mediated attraction by Netrin-1 is regulated only by cAMP, Netrin-1 chemorepulsion mediated by the DCC/Unc5 receptor complex is regulated also by cGMP. Both nucleotides alter the level of intracellular Ca²⁺ by modulating type L-type Ca²⁺ channels. Thus, the cAMP/cGMP ratio might set the polarity

![Figure 15](attachment:figure_15.png)

Fig. 15. cAMP and Ca²⁺ modulate growth cone response to define two groups of guidance molecules. Group I: Netrin-1, Acetylcholine, BDNF, MAG (Myelin-associated-glycoprotein) and NGF; the response to these signals is dependent on intracellular Ca²⁺ and requires the co-activation of PI₃K (PI-3 Kinase) and PLCγ (Phospholipase C-γ); the sign of the response depends on the levels of cAMP and on the activation of PKA (Protein Kinase A). Group II: Sema3A and NT3; the response is independent of Ca²⁺ and PI₃K and is regulated by cGMP and PKG (Protein Kinase G; Based on [27]).
of Netrin-1-induced axon guidance: high ratios may enhance attraction, whereas low ratios may favor repulsion ([181]). Recently, Calcium-Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurine (CaN) phosphatase have been implicated in the control of Ca²⁺-dependent axonal guidance by Netrin-1. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that growth cone repulsion induced by Netrin-1 is converted to attraction by the inhibition of CaN [253].

### 4.3. MAP-kinases

The involvement of MAPKs (Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinases) pathways in Netrin-1-activated signalling has been reported. In commissural axons of the rodent spinal cord, the phosphorylation of MAPK ERK1/2 is required for both the stimulation of neuritic growth and the chemottractive response to Netrin-1 [77]. In addition, the phosphorylation of MAPK p38 and local activation of the Caspase 3-dependent apoptotic pathway are required for response to Netrin-1 in cultured retinal neurons of *Xenopus* (Fig. 16) [25]. These two studies propose that Netrin-1 also regulates the expression of certain genes in the growth cone by the activation of distinct transcription and transduction factors such as Elk-1, eIF-4EBP1, eIF-4E and NFAT. This transcriptional regulation is required for the response to Netrin-1, because it is blocked in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors.

MAPKs are also involved in the neuritic extension induced by neurotrophic factors and adhesion molecules such as L1, Laminin and N-cadherin [81,128,201,202] and are inhibited by some Eph receptors [168]. MAPKs may, therefore, constitute another level of integration and convergence for distinct guidance signals.

As mentioned previously, when DCC is unoccupied, it binds to DIP13α and interacts with Caspases 3 and 9, thereby defining a new apoptotic mechanism that is independent of Cytochrome-c and Apaf-1 [77,149,163]. Caspases also appear to play a role in the axonal guidance mediated by Netrin-1. Campbell and Holt [25,26] showed that the degradation of proteins by the proteasome is required for chemottractive and repulsive responses to Netrin-1. They proposed that the MAPK p38 induces the activation of Caspase 3 in the growth cone, thereby stimulating the local activation of protein degradation (Fig. 16). In contrast to the activation of the caspases involved in cell death, there is a local, transient activation of Caspase 1 in the growth cone, which is Caspase 9-independent [163,164].

The mechanisms by which DCC activates the MAPK pathways are still unknown. This activation may be mediated through monomeric GTPases, as occurs after the binding of GTP to Ras, which triggers the phosphorylation cascade through Raf1 and MEK1/2, which in turn, leads to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 [47].

**Fig. 16.** Netrin-1 acts through the small MAP-Kinase pathway. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and the local activation of the Caspase3-dependent apoptotic pathway are required for response to Netrin-1 in distinct culture models. Netrin-1 also regulates the expression of certain genes in the growth cone as it produces the activation of distinct transcription and transduction factors such as Elk-1, eIF-4EBP1 and eIF-4E. Protein degradation by the proteasome is also required. MAPK p38 induces the activation of Caspase3 in the growth cone, thereby stimulating local activation of protein degradation (based in [26]).

increasing concentrations of Netrin-1 [171]. MAPKs are also involved in this resensitization of the growth cone by mechanisms that remain largely unknown [77].

### 4.4. Microtubules and microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B)

Finally, the intracellular signalling cascades activated by the binding of Netrin-1 to DCC may result in molecules that modify the cell cytoskeleton to generate growth cone response. Traditionally, it has been accepted that the actin
cytoskeleton is the main structure responsible for initiating and directing the movement of the growth cone. However, many studies indicate that dynamic microtubules present in the peripheral domain of the growth cone may play a critical role in regulating cone navigation [139,271].

The navigation of the growth cone involves the stabilization and selective growth of microtubules in particular regions of the cone [31,144–146,183,231, 230,258]. In this regard, Buck et al. [21] showed that the stabilization and growth of the dynamic microtubules are sufficient to induce attractive-turning (towards the source of the stabilizer), while their destabilization and local disassembly lead to repulsive turning (away from the source of the destabilizing molecule) [31,158,230,231]. In the same study, these authors demonstrated that the dynamic microtubules present in the peripheral domain of the growth cone are required to generate a response to Netrin-1 [21].

The microtubule-associated protein MAP1B has been implicated in neuritic extension, in the control of microtubules dynamic stability and in the interaction between microtubules and actin filaments [94,156,158]. MAP1B is phosphorylated in multiple serines and threonines [108,239]. Mode I phosphorylation is characteristic of embryonic development and is mediated by the serine-threonine-kinases Cdk5 and Gsk3β. Although the precise function of MAP1B is a subject of controversy, its phosphorylation modifies its affinity for the cytoskeleton, so that its differential phosphorylation provides a precise mechanism to modify its function [188,189].

In the embryonic brain, MAP1B is enriched in the distal region of developing axons and growth cones ([11,96,165]; revised in [96]). Mack and co-workers [158] proposed that the local phosphorylation state of this protein is crucial during axon turning in retinal ganglion cells. Their results indicate that the mode I phosphorylated MAP1B isoform (MAP1B-P1) is restricted to stabilized regions of the growth cone that extend on permissive substrates. They suggested that the local activation of MAP1B in the growth cone, together with a selective inactivation of MAP1B in other regions, may induce a restricted stabilization of microtubules responsible for the re-direction of axonal growth. Similarly, the modification of the phosphorylation state of MAP1B appears to be sufficient to determine the direction to which the growth cone turns [158].

A recent study [60] has shown that Netrin-1 also modifies the phosphorylation state of MAP1B in cultured neurons via the serine-treonine-kinases Cdk5 and Gsk3. Moreover, the response to Netrin-1 is reduced in vitro in explants from different regions obtained from *map1b*-deficient embryos. In vivo, *map1b*-deficient mice show defects in some axonal pathways similar to the alterations described in mice lacking *netrin-1*. The brains from *map1b*-deficient mice have axonal deficits similar to those in *netrin-1* mutant mice. Together, these results indicate that the effects of Netrin-1 on axonal guidance may be mediated in part by microtubule reorganization through MAP1B.

It is interesting to note that NGF and BDNF, which belong to the same group of guidance molecules as Netrin-1 [27,169], also increase Cdk5 activity (for a revision, see [62,218]). In the case of NGF, in PC12 cells, the increase in Cdk5 activation is mediated by the MAP-Kinases Erk1/2 [103]. The activation of Cdk5 appears to be regulated by a negative feedback system, since active Cdk5 inhibits MEK1/2 [210], which blocks the MAPK pathway.

### 4.5. UNC-5 receptor-signalling

The signalling cascades induced by Netrin-1 through the UNC-5 receptors have been less studied. The *C. elegans* cytosolic protein MAX1 is required for the repulsive response to Netrin-1 [113]. In vivo, the binding of Netrin-1 to UNC-5 increases the phosphorylation of the receptor in its ZU-5 domain, which is required when UNC-5 acts independently of DCC [126]. This event enhances the binding of the receptor with the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, which interacts with the GTPases of the Rho family, thereby stimulating the reorganization of the cytoskeleton [130,240]. Similarly, the interaction of UNC-5H2 and Giα2 has also been reported [130], although it is necessary to identify the intracellular pathways that are activated by UNC-5H receptors upon Netrin-1 binding.

Recently, it has been described that the cell surface localization of UNC-5H1 is regulated in neurons by interaction with PICK1 (Protein Interacting with Protein Kinase C 1) and Protein Kinase C (PKC). PKC stimulation promotes the removal of UNC-5H1 from the cell surface of embryonic hippocampal neurons and decreases the capacity of Netrin-1 to induce the collapse of growth cones [257].

Similar to DCC, UNC-5H receptors are cleaved by caspases, and they are also dependence receptors [35,153,163,237]. The cleavage of UNC-5H2 and UNC-5H3 receptors, which allows the release of a death-domain, is required for cell death induction [153,233]. However, UNC-5H1 may differ from these receptors, as UNC-5H1-induced apoptosis is dependent of the ZU-5 domain rather than of the death domain [256], in a process that may require p53 [233] and/or NRAGE [256].

### 5. Receptors as the combinatorial sum of modules

How can the binding receptor-ligand produce such distinct functions? The response of a receptor after integration with its ligand is determined by the: (a) interaction of distinct receptors to form a multimeric receptor complex; (b) domains of each receptor that are activated within this complex and (c) intracellular molecules that couple to the activated receptor, thereby triggering distinct intracellular transduction pathways [267].

Receptors should be considered units comprised of modules or discrete domains that confer distinct properties. DCC binds to Netrin-1 and can trigger a range of intra-
cellular signalling pathways in response to this interaction. The DCC interaction with distinct receptors, together with the activation of different signalling pathways, greatly increases the versatility of the system.

When DCC binds to Netrin-1 through its 5th type FnIII repetition [89], it dimerizes through the P3 domain, an event that is necessary for its activation and to transmit the messages “attraction by Netrin-1” and “increase in neuritic growth”.

However, if the cell simultaneously expresses DCC and UNC-5H2, a heterologous receptor complex is formed by the interaction of the P1 domain of DCC with the CB domain of UNC-5H2 [111]. The formation of this receptor complex produces repulsive responses in the presence of Netrin-1.

Robo and DCC form a “silencer complex” in which the attractive response to Netrin-1 is silenced while the capacity to stimulate neuritic growth is maintained. The formation of this complex is dependent on the previous interaction between Robo and its ligand (Slit). In addition, the formation of this complex also requires interaction between the CC1 domain of Robo and the P3 domain of DCC (Fig. 17) [92,224].

The mechanism by which the components of the receptor complex determine the response to Netrin-1 remains to be elucidated. However, it is interesting that, in the silencing

complex, Robo binds to the domain that is required for DCC dimerization (P3 domain). This observation indicates that the silencing mechanism may consist of a blocking of DCC dimerization, which is consistent with the fact that DCC alone induces the stimulation of neuritic growth. Furthermore, the action of the distinct receptors inside the complex differs from their individual actions outside, as in the Robo/DCC silencing complex, Robo does not respond to Slit and DCC modifies its response to Netrin-1.

DCC may also act independently of Netrin-1. Mutations of loss- and gain-of-function in *C. elegans* support the hypothesis that UNC-40 (homologue of DCC) enhances the repulsive response mediated by SAX-3 (homologue of Robo) to its ligand Slit [268]. Therefore, combinatorial logic dictates alternative functions for DCC (UNC-40) that may act in attraction by Netrin-1 (UNC-6), repulsion by Netrin-1 (with UNC-5) or repulsion by Slit (with SAX-3).

After the activation of the receptors, intracellular signal transduction cascades are induced. This provides another level of regulation: the regulated expression of the components of the intracellular signalling machinery may determine the response to a receptor. The intracellular mechanisms, which are triggered after the activation of DCC by Netrin-1, are very complex (see above). Knowledge of the signalling

Fig. 17. Combinatorial logic dictates alternative functions for DCC: Summary of the distinct receptor complexes formed by DCC and the responses that they may transduce. Netrin-1 interaction with DCC produces attraction. The Unc5-DCC heteromeric receptor converts the response in repulsion. The interaction between DCC and Robo (activated by Netrin-1 and Slit respectively) results in the silencing of Netrin-1 attraction. DCC binds to Robo and potentiates Robo signaling in a Netrin-independent fashion. Finally, when DCC is unoccupied, it binds to DIP13α and interacts with Caspase 3, thereby inducing apoptosis (Based on [267]).

cascades induced is incomplete, which hinders the global design that explains their function.

Tyrosine kinases and phosphatases modulate DCC signalling in *C. elegans*. Chang et al. [33] propose a model in which an unknown protein tyrosine kinase is a positive regulator of Netrin-1-mediated attraction, with the phosphatase CLR-1 acting as a negative regulator by inhibiting DCC signalling.

Even when DCC is not bound to Netrin-1, it can transduce a signal: in this case, “cell death”. Since it is unoccupied, DCC binds to DIP13α to generate an intracellular apoptotic complex in which Caspases 3 and 9 interact (called the caspase activator complex); [149], thereby defining a new apoptotic mechanism that is independent of Cytochrome-c and Apaf-1. The expression or non-expression of DIP13α in a cell could, therefore, defines the dependence on or independence of DIP13α for Netrin-1 dependent cell survival.

However, during axonal guidance, the activation of MAPK p38 after interaction of Netrin-1 with DCC in the growth cone produces the local activation of the proteasome and the protein degradation pathway. Caspase 3, but not Caspase 9, is involved in this process, which is necessary for the attractive response to Netrin-1. Campbell and Holt [25,26,164] proposed that the differentiation between one process and the other lies in the fact that during axonal guidance, activation is local in the growth cone while global activation in the P38 cell leads to cell death.

In summary, we could consider receptor complexes as a set of pieces: receptors that can combine with each other and which, in turn, are formed by domains with a certain capacity for independent signalling. These domains may be activated, or not, within the distinct complexes, thereby conferring them distinct properties. The signalling capacities of these domains also depend on the availability of key intracellular molecules to trigger these cascades and which, in turn, are regulated by levels of second messengers (Fig. 17).

The formation of these heteromultimeric complexes allows the development of specificity through a combinatorial logic, in which the individual subunits act in complexes whose properties differ. In addition, the combinatorial assembly of receptors provides a system for the integration of signals, which allows the production of graduated responses to a single ligand and the conversion of responses to others of a distinct nature, the silencing between signals or a cooperative effect between them. The capacity to stimulate various responses in several settings is also observed in other guidance molecules such as semaphorins and slits [5,19,25,51,85,125,137,215,250,252]. This strategy is enhanced in evolutionary terms as it promotes the economy of mechanisms that has been so observed during evolution.
