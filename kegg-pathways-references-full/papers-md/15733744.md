### Abstract

This review will provide insight on the current understanding of the regulation of insulin signaling in both physiological and pathological conditions through modulations that occur with regards to the functions of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). While the phosphorylation of IRS1 on tyrosine residue is required for insulin-stimulated responses, the phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine residues has a dual role, either to enhance or to terminate the insulin effects. The activation of PKB in response to insulin propagates insulin signaling and promotes the phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine residue in turn generating a positive-feedback loop for insulin action. Insulin also activates several kinases and these kinases act to induce the phosphorylation of IRS1 on specific sites and inhibit its functions. This is part of the negative-feedback control mechanism induced by insulin that leads to termination of its action. Agents such as free fatty acids, cytokines, angiotensin II, endothelin-1, amino acids, cellular stress and hyperinsulinemia, which induce insulin resistance, lead to both activation of several serine/threonine kinases and phosphorylation of IRS1. These agents negatively regulate the IRS1 functions by phosphorylation but also via others molecular mechanisms (SOCS expression, IRS degradation, O-linked glycosylation) as summarized in this review. Understanding how these agents inhibit IRS1 functions as well as identification of kinases involved in these inhibitory effects may provide novel targets for development of strategies to prevent insulin resistance.

### 1. Introduction

Insulin is the primary hormone involved in glucose homeostasis and the stimulation of glucose transport. Circulating insulin rapidly reaches its target tissues, mainly liver, muscles, and adipose tissue, where it interacts with its receptor. The insulin receptor (IR) belongs to the family of cell surface receptors possessing intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. IR is composed of two extracellular α-subunits and two transmembrane β-subunits linked by disulfide bonds. Insulin binds to the α-subunit to induce tyrosine autophosphorylation of the IR β-subunit. The activated IR subsequently phosphorylates its substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, Shc (Src homology collagen) and APS (adaptor protein with a PH and SH2 domain). The phosphorylated proteins dock downstream effector molecules, which then are able to activate different signaling pathways. The ERK pathway is mainly involved in growth. By contrast, the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), mainly through IRS1, is preferentially involved in the metabolic actions of insulin. Recently, it has been shown that activation of TC10 pathway is also involved in insulin-mediated glucose uptake specifically in adipocytes [1].

IRS1 belongs to the IRS family of adaptor molecules and is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin, insulin growth factor-1 and cytokines. IRS1 plays a critical role in insulin signaling. IRS1 contains Pleckstrin homology (PH)

and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains at the N-terminus which couple IRS1 to phosphorylated IR. PTB domain binds specifically to phosphotyrosine Y⁹⁶⁰ of the juxtamembrane of the IR β-subunit (using rat IR numbering). IRS1 also contains several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites and 50 potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. In response to insulin, IRS1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and recruits a number of SH2 containing signal transducers including PI 3-kinase [2,3]. The phosphorylation of Tyr⁶⁰⁸ and Tyr⁶²⁸ (using rat IRS1 numbering), for instance, generates the major docking sites for the PI 3-kinase [4]. While the role of IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation has been largely elucidated, the role of serine/threonine phosphorylation has not been fully understood and further can play opposite roles.

Insulin resistance is a common pathological state in which target tissues fail to respond properly to normal levels of circulating insulin. The earliest abnormality observed in insulin resistance is a decrease in insulin-induced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and a reduced ability of the hormone to suppress glucose production by the liver [1,2]. At the early stage of the pathology, pancreatic β cells first compensate for peripheral insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion to maintain euglycemia. When chronic, this hyperinsulinemia exacerbates insulin resistance and contribute to β-cell failure leading to the development of impaired glucose tolerance and overt clinical type 2 diabetes [1,2]. At the molecular level, decrease in glucose uptake is linked to a reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and PI 3-kinase activation in animal models of insulin resistance but also in type 2 diabetic patients [3]. Moreover, low amounts of IRS1 and a decrease in its tyrosine phosphorylation have been reported in 30% of subjects at high risk for type 2 diabetes such as first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic and obese subjects [3,5]. While the mechanisms involved in the decrease in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation have not been completely identified, the involvement of serine phosphorylation of IRS1 in the desensitization of insulin action has been pointed out over the last decade [3]. This postulate has emerged when our laboratory has shown that a serine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, severely altered the effect of insulin on glucose transport and on Glut 4 translocation in adipocytes and skeletal muscles [6]. This alteration was correlated to a decrease in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation. In addition, we have found that okadaic acid markedly increased serine phosphorylation of IRS1 making this hyperphosphorylated form of IRS1 a “poor” IR substrate [6]. The same process occurred in cells treated with PDGF [7]. This indicates that a delicate balance between “positive” IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation vs. “negative” IRS1 serine phosphorylation could regulate the IRS1 functions. We would like to suggest that modification of this equilibrium could lead to pathological situations. Inhibition of IRS1 functions induces insulin resistance, while, in contrast, constitutive activation of IRS1 functions could promote sustained cell growth and anti-apoptotic responses. In favor of this hypothesis, it has been reported that the constitutive activation of IRS1 functions is a frequent event in human tumors [8]. Likewise, “Taxol”, a chemotherapy drug, which inhibits IGF-1 survival effect in human breast cancer cells, leads to serine phosphorylation of IRS1 [9]. It is also interesting to note that these post-translational modifications could be a general mechanism to regulate the functions of docking proteins since it also occurs with Gab1 and Gab2 [10–12].

Regarding insulin resistance, studies have suggested that agents such as tumor necrosis α (TNFα) [13], free fatty acids (FFA) [14,15], cellular stress [16–18], amino acids [19–21], endothelin-1 [22–24], angiotensin II [25] and hyperinsulinemia [26], which induce insulin resistance, can also activate serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate IRS1 and inhibit its function (Fig. 1). The plasma concentrations of FFA [14], amino acids [27,28], angiotensin II [29], and endothelin-1 [30,31] are elevated in insulin resistant, obese and type 2 diabetic patients. The inhibition of IRS1 functions could represent a unifying mechanistic link between all factors involved in insulin resistance.

### 2. TNFα induced IRS1 phosphorylation

The proinflammatory cytokine TNFα has been implicated as a link between obesity and insulin resistance although its precise role in humans is still controversial. TNFα interferes with early steps of insulin signaling, a major mechanism of

Fig. 1. The phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine residues regulates the IRS1 functions. The phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine residues plays a dual role to either enhance or terminate insulin effects. The activation of PKB in response to insulin propagates insulin signaling and promotes the phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine residues generating a positive-feedback loop for insulin action. Insulin also activates JNK, ERK, PKC and mTOR, which induce the phosphorylation of IRS1 on specific sites and inhibit its functions. This is a part of the negative-feedback control mechanism induced by insulin that terminates its action. There is thus a delicate balance existing between positive IRS1 tyrosine/serine phosphorylation and negative IRS1 serine phosphorylation, which can regulate the IRS1 function. Agents such as free fatty acids, cytokines, angiotensin II, endothelin-1, amino acids, cellular stress, and hyperinsulinemia could enhance the negative IRS1 serine phosphorylation which can lead to insulin resistance. These agents promote the activation of serine/threonine kinases (JNK, PKC, mTOR, S6K, IKK, ERK), which phosphorylate IRS1, and thereby inhibit the IRS1 functions.

TNFα-induced insulin resistance [32]. Treatment of cells with TNFα reduces the insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and, depending on the cell type, IR activation induced by insulin. TNFα neutralization in genetically obese fa/fa rats restores normal level of IR activation and IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation in muscle and adipose tissue. Several data have shown that TNFα inhibits IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation by promoting its serine phosphorylation [13,32]. The serine phosphorylation of IRS1 can induce its conformational change that in turn can lead to decrease its interaction with the IR and that may render IRS1 a poor substrate for the IR [33]. It has also been suggested that, once phosphorylated on serine residues, IRS1 binds unknown signaling molecules that hinder its interaction with the IR or inhibit the IR kinase activity. Recently, phosphopeptide mapping, mutational analysis and phosphospecific antibodies led to the observation that TNFα induced phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser³⁰⁷ (corresponding to Ser³¹² in human) that is located at the end of the PTB domain of IRS1, a domain involved in the binding of IRS1 to the IR [34]. White et al. demonstrated that phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser³⁰⁷ markedly reduced the interaction between IRS1 and the IR and that mutation of Ser³⁰⁷ to alanine impaired the inhibitory effect of TNFα on insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation [34]. From this study, it has been proposed that this phosphorylation induces a conformational change in the PTB domain of IRS1 that reduces its affinity for the IR (Fig. 2) [35]. Thus, TNFα leads to progressive accumulation of IRS1 molecules that are phosphorylated at Ser³⁰⁷ which are less efficient to couple to the IR.

Among the serine/threonine kinases activated by TNFα, c-Jun NH₂-terminal kinase (JNK) has been shown to be involved in this phosphorylation (Fig. 2) (Table 1)[34]. It was tempting to speculate that this kinase plays a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Studying the phenotype of JNK1-deficient mice was used to address this question. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Ser³⁰⁷ is increased in wild-type mice maintained on high-fat diet (HFD) but not in JNK1-knockout mice. Moreover, these knockout mice have decreased adiposity, resistance to HFD, an improved insulin sensitivity, and an enhanced IR signaling capacity. In addition, genetically obese (ob/ob) mice with targeted mutation in Jnk1 put on less weight than their relative control (ob/ob) mice and are partly protected against hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia [36]. Studies of db/db mouse treated with a JNK inhibitor revealed an improvement in glucose tolerance [37].

It has been recently shown that JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1), which binds components of JNK signaling module, is essential for JNK activation and inhibition of IRS1 functions in adipose tissue of obese mice [38]. In epididymal fat pads from JIP1-deficient mice, insulin-stimulated IRS1 function is enhanced and this is correlated with a reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser³⁰⁷. JIP1-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, the JIP–/– mice display the following phenotype: (1) decrease in fat accumulation in epididymal fat pads and liver; (2) reduced concentration of plasma leptin and increased concentrations of plasma adiponectin; and (3) abrogation of obesity-induced JNK activation and IRS1 Ser³⁰⁷ phosphorylation in fat and muscle [38]. It is of interest to note that an increased basal level of JNK has

Fig. 2. The phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser³⁰⁷, Ser⁶¹², and Ser⁶³² negatively regulates the functions of IRS1. IRS1 contains PH and PTB domains at the N-terminus which couple IRS1 to phosphorylated insulin receptor. The C-terminal domain of IRS1 contains a number of consensus tyrosine phosphorylation motifs, which are directly phosphorylated by insulin receptor. The phosphorylation of Tyr⁶⁰⁸ and Tyr⁶²⁸, for instance, generates docking sites for the PI 3-kinase. IRS1 also contains potential serine phosphorylation sites such as Ser³⁰⁷, Ser⁶¹², and Ser⁶³². The phosphorylation of Ser³⁰⁷ uncouples IRS1 from the IR, decreases its tyrosine phosphorylation and increases its degradation. Phosphorylation of Ser⁶¹² and Ser⁶³², which are located close to the tyrosine residues that are involved in the binding of PI 3-kinase, could reduce the PI 3-kinase association. (IRS1 numbering refers to the rat primary sequence).
been observed in adipocytes from type 2 diabetic patients in association with a reduction of IRS1 amount and tyrosine phosphorylation [39]. Altogether this evidence is highlighting JNK as a potential drug target for the treatment of obesity or type 2 diabetes.

In addition to the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>307</sup>, TNFα also induces the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>632</sup> in IRS1 (Table 1) [40]. This phosphorylation is sensitive to rapamycin indicating that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is involved in this process [40]. Ser<sup>632</sup> is located close to the major PI 3-kinase binding site and its phosphorylation could modulate the interaction between IRS1 and the PI 3-kinase.

### 3. Fatty acids and IRS1 phosphorylation

Increased plasma FFA concentrations are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Fasting and post-prandial FFA concentrations are elevated in both diabetes and in individuals at risk for the disease. An inverse relationship between fasting plasma FFA concentration and insulin sensitivity has been observed in young, normal-weight offspring of type 2 diabetic patients [41]. Muscle insulin resistance can be induced by infusion of lipid emulsion with heparin used to acutely raise plasma fatty acid concentrations (for review see [42]). Finally, strong evidence about a role of lipids in muscle insulin resistance has been obtained by studies with NMR spectroscopy showing a strong relationship between the accumulation of intramyocellular triglyceride content and insulin resistance [43–45]. Several years ago, Randle et al. speculated that FFAs compete with glucose for substrate oxidation and that increased fat oxidation causes the insulin resistance associated with obesity. They proposed that increased FFA levels lead to elevated mitochondrial acetylCoA/CoA and NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios that, in turn, inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and lead to an increase in citrate level that inhibits phosphofructokinase activity. This process induces an increase in glucose 6-phosphate concentration, which inhibits hexokinase and reduces glucose transport/phosphorylation activity [42]. Shulman et al. challenged the conventional Randle’s hypothesis [14,46]. By an elegant series of studies using NMR spectroscopy, they demonstrated that an elevation of plasma fatty acid concentrations results in a decrease rather than the expected increase in the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate concentration in muscle suggesting that the initial defect induced by FFA appears to be an alteration in glucose transport/phosphorylation in response to insulin [14,46]. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the rate limiting-step for fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in humans was glucose transport rather than glucose phosphorylation [47,48]. They proposed that this defect was due to fatty acid-induced alterations in upstream insulin signaling events. They found that elevation in plasma fatty acid concentrations abolished insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation [48]. Based on these data, Shulman and colleagues

proposed that fatty acids cause insulin resistance through inhibition of IRS1 signaling. This group demonstrated that the decrease in insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation provoked by FFAs was linked to an increase in the activity of PKC-θ [49]. Normally, PKC-θ activity is increased by diacylglycerol produced by the metabolism of muscle long-chain acyl CoA. Activation of PKC-θ acts to the Ser<sup>307</sup> phosphorylation of IRS1, and could explain the decrease in insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2) (Table 1) [15]. Interestingly, HFD also increases both long-chain acyl CoA muscles content, PKC-θ activity, and Ser<sup>307</sup> phosphorylation [15]. It has also been reported that PKC-θ negatively regulates the IRS1 functions in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [50]. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes and C2C12 myocytes, PKC-θ phosphorylates IRS1 at serine 1101 (Table 1) [51]. This event blocks IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of PKB pathway. FFAs but also insulin, TPA and TNFα promote the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>1101</sup>. Mutation of Ser<sup>1101</sup> to alanine makes IRS1 insensitive to the effect of PKC-θ and restores insulin signaling in cultured cells [51]. Finally, PKC-θ knockout mice are protected from fat-induced insulin resistance. Skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin action did not differ between Wt and PKC-θ null mice following saline infusion. Lipid infusion decreased insulin stimulated muscle glucose uptake in the Wt mice that was associated with a strong decrease in insulin-mediated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS1-associated PI3-kinase activity. On the contrary, PKC-θ inactivation prevented fat-induced defects in insulin signaling and glucose transport in skeletal muscle [52].

Inhibitor κB kinase-β (IKK-β) which is activated by PKC-θ could be involved in the phosphorylation of IRS1 in response to high FFA concentrations. IRS1 is a direct in vitro substrate of IKK-β [53], and a high-dose of salicylate, which improves glucose tolerance and inhibits IKK-β, prevents muscle insulin resistance and the decrease in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by lipid infusion [54]. Moreover, lipid infusion failed to alter insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of IKK-β heterozygous knockout mice, which are also protected against HFD-induced insulin resistance [54], although controversial findings have been recently published, against a substantial role of muscular IKK-β in mediating obesity-induced insulin resistance in muscle specific IKK-β knockout mice [55]. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with FFA leads also to PKC-θ activation and activation of downstream kinases IKK and JNK. IKK and JNK mediate PKC-θ signals for IRS1 serine phosphorylation and degradation [50]. The beneficial effect of salicylate in the treatment of insulin resistance was confirmed in studies of the effect of high-doses of aspirin in type 2 diabetic patients. A 2-week trial of high-dose aspirin treatment suggested a decrease in hepatic glucose production, fasting plasma glucose, fatty acids and triglycerides, and increased peripheral glucose disposal. Aspirin treatment also improved post-prandial hyperglycemia and reduced both fasting and post-prandial plasma fatty acid concentrations [56]. However, we would
like to underline the fact that aspirin or salicylate also alters the activity of JNK, ERK and S6K [57–59], which phosphorylate and inhibit the IRS1 functions (see next paragraph). Taken together, these observations indicate that intracellular fatty acid metabolites activate IKK-β that in turn phosphorylates IRS1 on Ser³⁰⁷(Fig. 2) (Table 1). Thus, IKK-β appears to be another candidate that plays a key role in the phosphorylation of IRS1 and in the regulation of insulin sensitivity.

## 4. Insulin-induced IRS1 phosphorylation

In addition to phosphorylation on tyrosines, IRS1 is also phosphorylated on serine residues following insulin stimulation. These phosphorylations can positively or negatively regulate insulin signaling (Fig. 1). Indeed, it has been shown that following insulin stimulation, IRS1 is phosphorylated on serine residues within the PTB domain by PKB/Akt a serine/threonine kinase that is activated downstream of PI 3-kinase. This phosphorylation protects IRS1 from the action of tyrosine phosphatases and maintains IRS1 in a phosphorylated active form [60].

Recently, a novel serine residue has been identified whose phosphorylation seems to regulate the IRS1 functions. Ser³⁰² is located just after the PTB domain, a domain which is required for the interaction of IRS1 with phosphorylated IR (Fig. 3). The group of M. White has reported that insulin promotes the phosphorylation of Ser³⁰² in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in murine muscle in vivo [61]. In cell lines, amino acids and glucose also stimulate this phosphorylation. Insulin-stimulated Ser³⁰² phosphorylation is dependent on the mTOR-signaling pathway. The substitution of Ser³⁰² with alanine significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, the amount of p85 associated to IRS1, activation of S6K and DNA synthesis in response to insulin suggesting that this phosphorylation would have positive effects (Table 1) [61]. However, the phosphorylation of Ser³⁰² in Fao hepatoma cells in response to agents which induce insulin resistance (PMA, chronic insulin treatment, anisomycin, calyculin A) seems to inhibit the IRS1 functions by disruption of the interaction of IRS1 with activated IR via a JNK1-dependent mechanism (Fig. 3) (Table 1) [62]. In diet-induced obese, leptin-deficient mice, and mice with hyperinsulinemia, Ser³⁰² is phosphorylated in liver. Ser³⁰² could also be phosphorylated by S6K in vitro. The phosphorylation of Ser³⁰² was found to be inhibited in cells after siRNA-mediated inhibition of S6K1 [63]. Thus, the exact role of the phosphorylation of Ser³⁰² in IRS1 functions requires further investigation. It should be noted that in most studies, authors have focused on one phosphorylation site. It is possible that controversial results are due to different combinations of phosphorylation of various additional sites.

Phosphorylation of IRS1 on other specific sites only serves as a negative-feedback control mechanism that decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 following prolonged insulin stimulation. Serine/threonine kinases downstream of PI 3-kinase seem to be involved in this feedback inhibitory loop since inhibitors of the PI 3-kinase pathway prevent the down-regulation of insulin action [64]. We and others have shown that insulin stimulation increases the phosphorylation of Ser³⁰⁷, Ser⁶¹² and Ser⁶³² in IRS1 [65,66] (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of Ser³⁰⁷ in response to insulin predominantly involves mTOR signaling pathway in adipocytes, muscles [65] and hepatocytes [67], although JNK could also play a role [68]. Interestingly, JNK activation could also promote the activation of mTOR, which, in turn, stimulates the Ser³⁰⁷ phosphorylation [21]. Hyperosmotic stress (see next paragraph), anisomycin, TNFα and okadaic acid, which induce insulin resistance, can also increase the phosphorylation of Ser³⁰⁷ by a mTOR-dependent pathway [16,17,21], indicating that mTOR plays a critical role in inhibition of IRS1 functions. In favor of the role of mTOR in a feedback mechanism used by insulin to terminate its action, we have shown that inhibition of this pathway prevents the rapid deactivation of PI 3-kinase in muscle when insulin stimulation is maintained [65]. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in hepatoma cell lines, mTOR inhibition prevents the insulin-induced degradation of IRS1 [67,69] that seems to be linked to the phosphorylation of Ser³⁰⁷. Indeed, IRS1 mutant lacking Ser³⁰⁷ is more resistant to degradation following long-term exposure to insulin [67]. While mTOR interacts with IRS1 and phosphorylates it [40,65], the phosphorylation of Ser³⁰⁷ could also be dependent on S6K1. Phosphorylation of S6K1 and IRS1 Ser³⁰⁷ in adipose tissue is elevated in wild-
type mice maintained on a HFD compared to mice maintained on a normal diet but also in two genetic models of obesity (\(K/K A^{y}\) and \(ob/ob\) mice). Furthermore, the increase in IRS1 Ser\(^{307}\) phosphorylation is absent in S6K1\(^{-/-}\)mice on a HFD [70].

The Ser\(^{612}\) and Ser\(^{632}\) residues are located in proximity to tyrosine residues, which, upon phosphorylation, generate binding sites for PI 3-kinase. The PI 3-kinase activation is required for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Fig. 2). In contrast, the role of phosphorylation of the two serine residues has not been firmly established but several studies suggest that it could modulate the interaction between IRS1 and PI 3-kinase and/or its activation [71,72]. ERK and/or mTOR signaling pathways in response to insulin mediate phosphorylation of these sites (Table 1) [65]. mTOR or downstream S6K could be responsible for this phosphorylation. In adipose tissue of various obese mice (HFD-induced obesity, \(K/K A^{y}\) and \(ob/ob\) mice), activation of S6K and phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser\(^{632}\) are highly elevated. Moreover, in fat from S6K1 null mice, HFD-induced S6K activation and IRS1 Ser\(^{632}\) phosphorylation are abrogated [70]. Interestingly, we recently reported that the basal level of IRS1 phosphorylation on Ser\(^{636}\) (corresponding to Ser\(^{632}\) in rodents) was abnormally high in primary cultures of skeletal muscle cells obtained from type 2 diabetic patients. Concomitantly, the basal activity of ERK was increased and insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation was altered. Moreover, inhibition of ERK normalized the level of IRS1 Ser\(^{636}\) phosphorylation [73]. It should be noted that an increased basal activity of ERK has been reported in adipocytes from type 2 diabetic patients [39]. While it remains to be determined whether normalization of ERK activity reverses the defect in insulin action, these results favor a role of ERK in the decrease in insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients.

Insulin also stimulates the phosphorylation of Ser\(^{318}\), which is mediated, at least partially by PKC \(\zeta\) (Table 1) (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of IRS1 by PKC \(\zeta\) blocks the interaction of IRS1 with IR and reduced its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues [72,74], which could be due to the phosphorylation of Ser\(^{318}\) [75].

In conclusion, the inhibition of IRS1 functions in response to insulin could depend on PKC, mTOR and JNK, which directly interacts with IRS1 [34,40,65,68,72], and ERK.

### 5. Cellular stress and insulin resistance

Hyperosmotic stress mimics insulin responses such as Glut 4 translocation and glucose transport [76] but also antagonizes insulin effects (see review [16]). Indeed, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, hyperosmotic stress inhibits the IRS1 functions in response to insulin. These inhibitory effects are associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser\(^{307}\) residue. This phosphorylation is dependent on mTOR activity. Inactivation of mTOR prevents the osmotic stress-induced phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser\(^{307}\) and reverses the inhibitory effect of hyperosmotic stress on insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation (Fig. 2) [17]. However, it is interesting to note that a supraphysiological concentration of insulin (100 nM), which leads to the activation of a high amount of IR, overcomes the inhibitory effect of osmotic stress on IRS1 function [17,77]. This is in favor of a delicate balance between positive IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation versus negative IRS1 serine phosphorylation which regulates IRS1 function. Our group has observed that hyperosmotic stress also promotes the phosphorylation of Ser\(^{632}\) (personal communication).

### 6. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase family members mediates IRS1 phosphorylation

Ser\(^{789}\) (corresponding to Ser\(^{794}\) in human) has been recently identified as a novel site phosphorylated in IRS1 (Fig. 3). Ser\(^{789}\) is phosphorylated in vitro by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and in cells treated with AICAR, an AMPK activator. This phosphorylation led to enhancement of insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation (Table 1) [78]. Since exercise activates AMPK, phosphorylation of Ser\(^{789}\) by exercise could improve IRS1 function and insulin-induced glucose disposal. However, other studies have reported an association of Ser\(^{789}\) phosphorylation with insulin resistance. Indeed, in livers from two rodent models of insulin resistance, the phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser\(^{789}\) and the activity of kinase responsible for its phosphorylation were increased [79]. It has been proposed that novel members of the AMP-activated protein kinase family, the salt-inducible kinases (SIK1 and SIK2), are responsible for this phosphorylation [80]. SIK2 is expressed preferentially in fat cells and can phosphorylate in vitro IRS1 on Ser\(^{789}\). Furthermore, in obese diabetic mice (\(db/db\)), the SIK1 and SIK2 protein levels are elevated in liver, skeletal muscle and in adipose tissue. SIK2 activity is also higher in white adipose tissue from diabetic mice compared to that from lean mice [81]. This could suggest that activation of these kinases leads to Ser\(^{789}\) phosphorylation, which, in turn, inhibits IRS1 functions that are involved in mediating insulin resistance. However, the role of Ser\(^{789}\) phosphorylation in IRS1 functions needs to be further determined.

### 7. Modification of the expression or activation of the serine/threonine kinases in humans

In muscle and adipose cells from type 2 diabetic patients, we and others have reported that the basal activity of serine/threonine kinases is abnormally elevated. In primary culture of skeletal muscle cells obtained from type 2 diabetic patients, as previously mentioned, the basal activity of ERK was increased [73]. Furthermore, an aberrant p38 mitogen-
activated protein kinase activity has been reported in skeletal muscle from diabetic patients [82]. In adipocytes isolated from moderately obese and diabetic patients, an enhanced basal activation of p38, ERK1/2, JNK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases has been detected [39]. An in vitro study has clearly shown that the constitutive activation of ERKs, p38 or JNK by overexpression of mutants of MEK1, MKK6 or MKK7, respectively, induces insulin resistance and inhibits the IRS functions to a different extent in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [83].

The molecular mechanisms responsible for the constitutive activation of these kinases are not yet fully understood. One possible mechanism could be that these kinases or the upstream kinases which activate them, are likely overexpressed leading thus to their aberrant activation. In favor of this hypothetical mechanism, it has been recently reported that the gene expression of ERK1, JNK2, of MEKK4 which activates JNK1-3, and of MKK6 which activates p38, are upregulated by 5.6 fold, 2.4 fold, 2.8 fold and 2.2 fold, respectively, in omental adipose tissue of severely obese patients compared with adipose tissues of lean patients [84]. Supplemental studies are required for the full understanding of this abnormal activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in pathology.

## 8. Inhibition of IRS1 functions by other mechanisms

Serine phosphorylation of IRS1 could induce conformational changes, steric hindrance, and cellular re-localization leading to decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation by IR, to reduce the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and to stimulate the IRS1 degradation pathway, respectively. Altogether, these events inhibit the IRS1 functions and promote insulin resistance. Other mechanisms including association of SOCS with IRS1, reduction of IRS1 expression (gene and protein), or other post-translational modifications of IRS1 (*O*-linked glycosylation), could modify the ability of IRS1 to fulfill its functions.

### 8.1. Role of SOCS

There is a growing body of evidence supporting the important role of suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS) in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome by concordantly modulating insulin and cytokine signaling (see review [85]). The expression of SOCS is enhanced by agents which induce insulin resistance such as chronic insulin stimulation, growth hormone, angiotensin II and proinflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-6 and IFNγ [85–88]. Recently, a central role of SOCS in hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome has been shown in mouse models. Overexpression or inhibition of expression of SOCS-1 or -3 in the liver of mice decreases or improves the insulin sensitivity, respectively [89,90]. SOCS proteins can attenuate insulin signaling by binding to the IR and by reducing their ability to phosphorylate IRS proteins [85,86,91]. The binding of SOCS to the Janus kinase can also inhibit its tyrosine kinase activity [85] and this could amplify the reduction in insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation [92]. SOCS proteins have also been suggested to interfere with insulin signaling by promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of IRS proteins [87,93].

### 8.2. Decrease in IRS1 expression

While serine phosphorylation is usually considered as a short-term inhibitory mechanism, regulated degradation of IRS protein might promote long-term insulin resistance. Adipocytes from type 2 diabetic subjects, obese patients and relatives of diabetic subjects display a 70% decrease in IRS1 protein expression, while no significant decrease in IRS2 protein expression has been reported. Likewise, IRS1 protein expression appears to be unchanged in skeletal muscle or primary cultures of skeletal muscle cells from either type 2 diabetic subjects or relatives of diabetic patients. A small (30%) reduction in IRS1 protein expression has been reported in morbidly obese subjects [5]. The decrease in IRS1 protein could result from its degradation or from alterations in its expression.

Cellular stress, chronic insulin exposure and proinflammatory cytokines can induce the degradation of IRS1 through proteasome-dependent or -independent processes. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, prolonged osmotic stress promotes the degradation not only of IRS1 but also of IRS-2 [17]. Oxidative stress, a putative causative factor for insulin resistance in cells [94,95] and in vivo [96], also leads to IRS1 degradation [18]. In contrast to recent data [97], we have shown that osmotic stress stimulates this degradation through a proteasome-independent process [17]. The decrease in IRS1 protein expression by oxidative stress is also insensitive to proteasome inhibitors [18]. This could indicate that both stresses elicit these effects through a lysosomal process. In contrast, the prolonged treatment of adipocytes with insulin reduces the level of IRS1 through a proteasome-dependent process. Moreover, it has been proposed that the mTOR-dependent IRS1 phosphorylation on serine residues could allow for its degradation [19,69,98,99]. In conclusion, although both insulin and stress (oxidative and osmotic) induce the serine phosphorylation of IRS1, other events activated only by insulin treatment may also be required to trigger IRS1 degradation by the proteasome. The chronic treatment with cytokine (TNFα and IL6) mediates the alteration of gene transcription of GLUT4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and also IRS1 and IRS2 resulting in the inhibition of IRS1 functions [100,101].

### 8.3. *O*-linked glycosylation of IRS

Hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance results, at least in part, from an increased flux of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which, in turn, increases the

tissue concentration of a hexosamine metabolite, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Accumulation of UDP-GlcNAc induces O-GlcNAc modification of proteins leading to defects in gene expression and protein function, and altogether contributing to insulin resistance [102]. Glucosamine infusion, for instance, induces the O-linked glycosylation on IRS1 and IRS2 in skeletal muscle [103]. This O-linked glycosylation may, thus, modulate global or site-specific phosphorylation of IRS, resulting in inhibition of IRS functions. Interestingly, O-GlcNAc transferases share substrate sequence similarities with serine/threonine kinases (PV(S/T) motif).

### 9. PPAR and retinoid X receptors agonists regulate the expression and/or the phosphorylation of IRS

Thiazolidinediones (TZD), the novel insulin sensitizers used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, are ligands for PPARγ which is predominantly expressed in the adipose tissue (see review [5]). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in human adipose tissue from lean and type 2 diabetic patients in culture, PPARγ agonists increase the gene and protein expression of IRS2 [5,104]. In contrast, in L6 muscle cells, PPARγ ligands rapidly increase the gene and protein expression of IRS1 but not of IRS2 [105]. The beneficial effects of TZD could occur by decreasing the FFA-induced inhibition of IRS1 functions in adipose tissue. Treatment of Zucker obese rats with rosiglitazone decreased the high FFA levels, the hyperactivation of both JNK and p38 MAPK, and decreased the phosphorylation of IRS1 Ser³⁰⁷ in adipose tissues [106]. It has been also reported that TZD improved downstream IR signaling in type 2 diabetic patients, in association with the decrease in fasting plasma FFA. As a possible consequence, TZD treatment increased insulin stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and p85 association of IRS1 [107].

Agonists of retinoid X receptors (RXR) could also improve the insulin effects. Treatment of db/db mice with RXR agonists (rexinoid) for 2 weeks increased the effect of insulin on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, with a concomitant decrease in IRS1 Ser³⁰⁷ phosphorylation [108]. In human skeletal muscle cells from healthy subjects and type 2 diabetic patients, co-treatment with agonists of PPARα and RXR, increased IRS2 and PI 3-kinase gene and protein expression. However, it did not overcome the impaired stimulation of the IRS1-dependent pathway and did not restore insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes from type 2 diabetic patients [109].

An attractive therapeutic approach would be a combination of agents or transcriptional factor ligands, which would increase both IRS1 and IRS2 expression. Indeed, IRS1 is the major activator of PI 3-kinase in response to insulin in human fat cells and is markedly reduced in adipocytes in insulin-resistant states while IRS2 plays a critical role in liver and β-cells.

### 10. Perspectives

Serine/threonine phosphorylation, interaction with SOCS, regulation of the expression, modification of the cellular localization, and degradation represent the molecular mechanisms stimulated by “diabetogenic” factors which induce insulin resistance through inhibition of IRS1 functions. The serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS1 inhibits its association with IR and furthermore its tyrosine phosphorylation, and promotes its de-localization and degradation. Serine phosphorylation of IRS1 is a key negative-feedback mechanism used by insulin under physiological conditions to terminate its action. In insulin resistant state characterized by chronic hyperinsulinemia, a signal, which inhibits insulin signaling, could be chronically activated. This imbalance between the positive IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation vs. the negative IRS1 serine phosphorylation is also strongly stimulated by “diabetogenic” factors including FFA, TNFα and cellular stress. This review points out the various serine phosphorylation sites and kinases (ERK, JNK, IKK-β, PKC-zeta, PKC theta, mTOR and S6K) involved in this process (Table 1). Future advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms implicated in insulin resistance might likely identify “key-regulatory” kinases and/or direct or indirect inhibitors of these kinases which are responsible for the inhibition of the functions of IRS1 but also of IRS2. The ultimate goal in such future studies is to define the novel targets for the treatment of insulin resistance.
