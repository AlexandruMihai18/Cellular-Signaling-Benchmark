## Pathogenetic mechanisms in thyroid follicular-cell neoplasia

**Tetsuo Kondo*†**, **Shereen Ezzat‡§** and **Sylvia L. Asa*†**

### Abstract | Thyroid cancer is one of the few malignancies that are increasing in incidence. Recent advances have improved our understanding of its pathogenesis; these include the identification of genetic alterations that activate a common effector pathway involving the RET–Ras–BRAF signalling cascade, and other unique chromosomal rearrangements. Some of these have been associated with radiation exposure as a pathogenetic mechanism. Defects in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of adhesion molecules and cell-cycle control elements seem to affect tumour progression. This information can provide powerful ancillary diagnostic tools and can also be used to identify new therapeutic targets.

#### C cells
Parafollicular cells of the thyroid that have a clear cytoplasm and are members of the peptide-hormone-secreting family (also known as ‘neuroendocrine’ cells). These cells are mainly involved in the production of calcitonin.

The thyroid gland, which is the largest endocrine organ in humans, regulates systemic metabolism through thyroid hormones (FIG. 1). It is composed of two distinct hormone-producing cell types that have been designated follicular cells and parafollicular C cells. Follicular cells comprise most of the epithelium and are responsible for iodine uptake and thyroid hormone synthesis. C cells are scattered intrafollicular or parafollicular cells that are dedicated to the production of the calcium-regulating hormone calcitonin.

Thyroid nodules can be hyperplastic benign adenomas or malignant lesions, and can be derived from thyroid follicular epithelial cells or C cells (BOX 1). Cancers that arise in the thyroid are the most common malignancy of endocrine organs¹⁻³. Age-adjusted global incidence rates vary from 0.5 to 10 cases per 100,000 population⁴. **Thyroid cancer** incidence rates have steadily increased over the past few decades⁵. More than 95% of thyroid carcinomas are derived from follicular cells (TABLE 1). A minority of tumours (3%), referred to as medullary thyroid carcinoma, are of C-cell origin. Most carcinomas that are derived from follicular epithelial cells are indolent tumours that can be effectively managed by surgical resection with or without radioactive-iodine ablation. However, a subset of these tumours can behave aggressively, and there is currently no effective form of treatment.

The pathogenesis of medullary thyroid carcinoma is well established and has been reviewed elsewhere⁶. This Review will focus on the mechanisms that underlie the initiation and progression of the more common neoplasms that arise from thyroid follicular cells.

#### Thyroid follicular-cell malignancies
Follicular-cell-derived carcinomas are broadly divided into well-differentiated, poorly differentiated and undifferentiated types on the basis of histological and clinical parameters (TABLE 1). Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma includes papillary and follicular types. Although initially defined by architectural criteria, the histological diagnosis of papillary carcinoma rests on a number of nuclear features that predict the propensity for metastasis to local lymph nodes⁴. The diagnosis of this most frequent type of thyroid malignancy (85–90% of thyroid malignancies) has been increasing, possibly owing to the changing recognition of nuclear morphological criteria. On the other hand, follicular thyroid carcinoma is characterized by haematogenous spread, and the frequency of its diagnosis has been decreasing⁷. Most well-differentiated thyroid cancers behave in an indolent manner and have an excellent prognosis.

By contrast, undifferentiated or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a highly aggressive and lethal tumour⁴,⁸. The presentation is dramatic, with a rapidly enlarging neck mass that invades adjacent tissues. There is currently no effective treatment and death usually occurs within 1 year of diagnosis. Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas are morphologically and behaviourally intermediate between well-differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas⁴,⁹,¹⁰ (TABLE 1).

The theory of sequential progression of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma through the spectrum of poorly differentiated to undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (FIG. 2) is supported by the presence of pre- or

Adenoma  
A benign epithelial tumour in which the cells form recognizable glandular (in this case follicular) structures or in which the cells are clearly derived from glandular (follicular) epithelium.

Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma  
A carcinoma that is composed of well-differentiated follicular epithelial cells. There are two main groups — papillary and follicular carcinoma — each of which has variants. These tumours generally have a good prognosis.

**At a glance**

- Thyroid tumours are the most common malignancy of endocrine organs, and incidence rates have steadily increased over recent decades.
- Most carcinomas that are derived from follicular epithelial cells are indolent tumours that can be effectively managed. However, a subset of these tumours can behave aggressively, and there is currently no effective form of treatment.
- Radiation exposure, iodine intake, lymphocytic thyroiditis, hormonal factors and family history all alter the risk of thyroid carcinoma.
- Alterations in key signalling effectors seem to be the hallmark of distinct forms of thyroid neoplasia.
- Mutations or rearrangements that involve mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathway effectors seem to be required for transformation.
- Signalling through growth factors and their receptors is considered essential for cancer progression, and some of these growth factors have been identified as modifiers of the behaviour of transformed thyroid cells.
- Cell-cycle regulators and adhesion molecules are altered in thyroid carcinomas, typically through epigenetic mechanisms that indicate progression to poorly differentiated or undifferentiated forms.
- Several molecules that are involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancers are emerging as diagnostic and/or prognostic tools for patient management.

**Risk factors**  
Radiation exposure, reduced iodine intake, lymphocytic thyroiditis, hormonal factors and family history are putative risk factors for thyroid carcinoma. Radiation exposure as a consequence of nuclear fallout is associated with papillary carcinoma, as evidenced by the sequelae of the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945), nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands (1954) and Nevada (1951–1962), and the more recent nuclear accident in Chernobyl (1986) ${}^{4,13}$. After the Chernobyl disaster, the effects of radiation exposure were most pronounced in children; it is not clear if this is because the thyroid is more susceptible to radiation damage in childhood, whether it is a reflection of the fact that children drank more contaminated milk, increasing their exposure to radioactive iodine, or both ${}^{14}$. External beam-radiation exposure in childhood for the treatment of benign conditions of the head and neck also increases the risk of papillary carcinoma ${}^{15}$. The predilection to radiation-induced injury seems to be closely linked to chromosomal rearrangement as opposed to intragenic point mutation as a mode of aberrant gene activation ${}^{14,16}$.

Iodine is required for thyroid hormone organization. Dietary iodine deficiency results in thyroid proliferation, known as goitre, as a compensatory mechanism. The incidence of follicular carcinoma in areas of iodine deficiency is higher than in areas of an iodine-rich diet ${}^{4,17}$. By contrast, papillary carcinoma is the most frequent type of thyroid cancer in iodine-sufficient regions ${}^{4,17}$. Interestingly, in animal models, iodine supplementation causes experimental thyroid cancers to change from follicular to papillary morphology, indicating that one of the roles of iodine in thyroid carcinogenesis is modulating tumour morphology, rather than cancer initiation ${}^{18}$. Despite these well-documented relationships, the role of iodine in thyroid carcinogenesis is still unclear.

Lymphocytic infiltration is frequently observed in papillary carcinoma, indicating that immunological factors might be involved in tumour progression. Recent molecular analyses indicate that chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis harbours potential precursor lesions of malignancy ${}^{19,20}$. Whether this represents a

**Figure 1 | The thyroid gland.** This butterfly-shaped organ that weighs 15–25 g is located on the anterior surface of the trachea at the base of the neck. It is comprised of aggregates or lobules of spherical follicles that are filled with colloid. The follicles range in size from 50–500 μm and are lined by cuboidal-to-flat follicular epithelial cells. C cells, which produce calcitonin, are found at the junction of the upper and middle third of both thyroid lobes, and are situated within follicles or in a parafollicular location. The main functions of the thyroid gland are synthesis, storage and secretion of thyroid hormones, $L$-triiodothyronine (T3) and $L$-thyroxine (T4), under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with negative feedback by the thyroid hormones. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is secreted from the hypothalamus, stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. TSH stimulates the follicular cells to synthesize and secrete thyroid hormones. Disruption of thyroid hormone homeostasis results in hypothyroidism and goitre, and in childhood cretinism.

**Box 1 | Clonality of thyroid tumour cells**

Clonal analyses have been used to distinguish between hyperplasia and neoplasia, as hyperplasia is considered to be polyclonal and neoplasia is thought to represent a monoclonal proliferation of a genetically transformed cell. In the thyroid, a monoclonal pattern has been identified in a subset of nodules that were previously considered hyperplastic. These data indicate that the disorder of unknown aetiology known as ‘sporadic nodular goitre’ — a form of goitre that is due to multiple nodular proliferations of thyroid follicular epithelial cells — might represent a transition from focal hyperplasia to frank neoplastic transformation. Although some investigators have argued that these data are due to large monoclonal patches of normal thyroid epithelium, the polyclonality of normal tissues in other studies makes this an unlikely explanation.

Most well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas manifest in patients who are 20–50 years of age, and the disease is 2–4 times more frequent in females than in males. These sex and age distributions of incidence indicate that female hormones might regulate thyroid carcinogenesis. Indeed, the oestrogen receptor is expressed by follicular cells, and oestrogen promotes the proliferation of these cells, and oestrogen promotes the proliferation of these cells. However, there is no clear causal relationship between thyroid cancer and pregnancy or the use of exogenous sex hormones.

There is also a genetic component to thyroid follicular-cell-derived carcinoma, as a family history increases risk 3.2- and 6.2-fold when a parent and a sibling, respectively, have had thyroid cancer. An idiopathic form of familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma accounts for 3.5–6.2% of thyroid cancers. Familial thyroid cancers associated with tumour syndromes that are due to known germline mutations include familial polyposis coli (associated with mutations in the adenomatosis polyposis coli gene (APC)), Cowden disease (associated with mutations in the phosphatase with tensin homology gene (PTEN)) and Werner syndrome (associated with mutations in the WRN gene). Several susceptibility gene loci have been identified in other familial tumour syndromes that predispose to papillary carcinoma associated with papillary renal-cell carcinoma (1q21), clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma ((3;8)(p14.2;q24.1)), and multinodular goitre (19p13.2). However, the far more common sporadic tumours do not harbour mutations in these loci.

**Genomic instability**

Thyroid cancers accumulate a number of alterations at the genomic level. Chromosome instability has been identified in follicular adenomas and carcinomas, which are frequently aneuploid with a high prevalence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving multiple chromosomal regions. This is in contrast to the diploid or near-diploid content of most papillary carcinomas, which generally show less frequent LOH. This contrasting pattern of chromosome instability indicates that these two distinct types of thyroid cancer occur through discrete molecular pathways. Microsatellite instability has been detected in benign as well as malignant thyroid lesions.

It has been proposed that genomic instability has a crucial role in the progression of thyroid neoplasms. Transfection of mutant HRAS or mutant BRAF induces genomic instability in the PCCL3 rat thyroid cell line, manifesting as loss of chromosomal material, mitotic bridge formation and misaligned chromosomes. These findings indicate that constitutive oncogenic activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway might further promote genomic instability of thyroid carcinoma cells, possibly causing additional somatic mutations during cancer progression. Such an integrated model is depicted in FIG. 2.

Other miscellaneous tumours — including squamous-cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, spindle-cell tumour with thymus-like differentiation, and carcinoma that shows thymus-like differentiation — are also rare in prevalence. Rare = <1%.

**Poorly-differentiated thyroid carcinoma**
A neoplasm derived from follicular epithelial cells that shows loss of structural and functional differentiation. Characteristically, these lesions show widely infiltrative growth, necrosis, vascular invasion and numerous mitotic figures.

**Undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma**
A tumour that is composed wholly or partially of undifferentiated cells without structural follicular-cell differentiation. There are three main morphological patterns: squamoid, pleomorphic giant cell and spindle cell. These tumours have a very poor prognosis.

**Papillary carcinoma**
Carcinomas that are composed of well-differentiated follicular epithelial cells and are characterized by distinctive nuclear features. Variants include classical forms with papillary architecture, follicular variants, oncocytic, tall-cell, solid and cribriform types, each with distinct growth patterns and behaviours.

**Follicular carcinoma**
A tumour that is composed of well-differentiated follicular epithelial cells and lacks nuclear features of papillary carcinoma. These tumours are capable of vascular invasion, which distinguishes them from follicular adenoma. Variants include oncocytic and clear-cell types.

**Thyroiditis**
A disease of the thyroid that is caused by inflammation.

**Goitre**
Enlargement of the thyroid gland. A goitre can be associated with normal, increased or decreased thyroid hormone levels in the blood, and might be due to primary thyroid disease or caused by infiltration or stimulation of the gland by hormones and other factors.

**Follicles**
The small spherical components of the thyroid gland that are lined by epithelium and contain colloid in varying amounts. The colloid provides storage for the thyroid-hormone precursor thyroglobulin.

Radiation and oestrogen, both of which are putative risk factors for thyroid cancer, have also been shown to induce genomic instability ${ }^{37-39}$. This might explain the relation of these risk factors to the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. However, there is considerable controversy as to whether genomic instability is

preceded by initial genetic mutations in various forms of sporadic human cancers ${ }^{40}$. The three-way interaction between environmental risk factors, genetic alterations and genomic instability will probably be a future focus in the study of thyroid cancer.

### Genetic alterations in signalling pathways

The principal cell-surface receptors that are involved in the regulation of thyroid follicular cell growth and function are shown in FIG. 3. Alterations in key signalling effectors seem to be the hallmark of distinct forms of thyroid neoplasia, as reviewed below.

#### Hyper-functioning thyroid nodules

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) activates the GSα–adenyl cyclase–cyclic AMP (cAMP) cascade on binding to the TSH receptor (TSHR) (FIG. 3), thereby regulating thyroid hormone synthesis and the growth of follicular cells ${ }^{41}$. TSHR is a classical seven-transmembrane-domain G-protein-coupled receptor. Gain-of-function mutations of TSHR (which is located on chromosome 14q31) and GNAS1 (which encodes GSα and is located on chromosome 20q13), both of which activate cAMP, occur in hyper-functioning thyroid adenomas ${ }^{42}$.

By contrast, activating mutations of TSHR and GNAS1 in thyroid malignancies are rare — this is consistent with the clinical observation that hyper-functioning thyroid nodules are unlikely to be malignant ${ }^{43,44}$. Accordingly, few reports have demonstrated the presence of GNAS1 mutations in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma ${ }^{45}$. This is also consistent with the low-incidence of thyroid cancer in patients with the McCune-Albright syndrome, which result from germline GNAS1 activation ${ }^{46}$. These observations indicate that constitutive activation of the cAMP cascade alone is insufficient for the malignant transformation of thyroid follicular cells.

#### Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma

In well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, which is the most common form of thyroid cancer, mutations or rearrangements in genes that encode MAPK pathway effectors seem to be required for transformation. Indeed, exclusive, non-overlapping, activating events that involve the genes RET, NTRK1 (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase 1), BRAF or Ras are detectable in nearly 70% of all cases ${ }^{47}$.

RET was the first activated receptor-tyrosine kinase to be identified in thyroid cancer. The proto-oncogene, located on chromosome 10q11.2, encodes a transmembrane receptor-tyrosine kinase with four cadherin-related motifs in the extracellular domain ${ }^{48}$. RET is normally expressed in the developing central and peripheral nervous systems and is an essential component of a signalling pathway that is required for renal organogenesis and enteric neurogenesis ${ }^{49}$. Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-family ligands and GDNF-family receptor-α (GFRα) bind the extracellular domain of RET to induce tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation that activates several signalling pathways, including extracellular regulated kinase (ERK, also known as MAPK kinase 1 and 3), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), MAPK p38 and C-JUN kinase (JNK, also known as MAPK kinase 8) ${ }^{50}$.

Figure 3 | Cell signalling pathways in follicular cells. Thyroid follicular cells express cell-surface receptors for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) — these receptors are seven-transmembrane-domain G-protein-coupled receptors. TSH activates this receptor and G proteins such as GSα at the cell surface of follicular cells, and induces intracellular production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) by adenylyl cyclase. cAMP stimulates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates cytoplasmic and nuclear target proteins. One PKA substrate is the nuclear transcription factor CREB, which activates the transcription of cAMP-responsive genes after being phosphorylated by PKA. Growth factors (GF) induce receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK) dimerization, resulting in phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail. In cooperation with receptor adaptors, phosphorylated RTK activates Ras by catalysing the replacement of GDP with GTP. In its GTP-bound form, Ras activates the kinase activity of BRAF and its downstream signalling cascade. BRAF phosphorylates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), which phosphorylates and activates extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Activated ERK migrates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates and activates various transcription factors that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, such as MYC and ELK1.

geographical location of patients^{51–56}; a reasonable range is 13–43%. More than 15 RET/PTC rearrangements have been described in sporadic and radiation-associated papillary carcinoma^{51}. The most common form is H4(CCDC6)-RET (also known as RET/PTC1) followed by ELE1-RET (also known as RET/PTC3) in sporadic papillary carcinoma^{56,57}.

The high incidence of RET rearrangements in childhood papillary carcinomas following the Chernobyl accident indicates a role for radiation damage in the genesis of these paracentric inversions^{14,58,59}. Analysis of chromatin patterns in thyroid follicular cells showed that the partners involved in the illegitimate rearrangements are in physical proximity in the chromatin distribution of follicular epithelial cells^{60}, providing a plausible scenario for radiation-related susceptibility.

Although thyroid-targeted expression of RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 induces thyroid neoplasms in transgenic mice^{61,62}, they do not recapitulate the metastatic phenotype without additional alterations^{63}. The high frequency of RET rearrangements in subclinical papillary microcarcinomas is also consistent with these changes representing early events in the neoplastic process^{57}. On the other hand, heterogeneity of RET rearrangements in a single large tumour has been interpreted as indicating a relatively late event^{64,65}. However, an alternative interpretation is that multiple and distinct rearrangements signify multifocal transforming events in benign clonal neoplasms^{66}. The low prevalence of expression of RET rearrangements in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma supports a minor role for the fusion proteins in tumour progression^{51,67–69}. However, the suggestion that RET/PTC rearrangements predict indolent behaviour must be interpreted with caution. This is because most studies have examined mRNA and protein expression in aggressive thyroid carcinomas^{68,69}, and it is clear that the promoters of the upstream genes that are involved in the translocations determine variable levels of expression and might be downregulated in de-differentiated cells, making this loss of expression an epiphenomenon.

RET/PTC rearrangements have also been reported in thyroids from patients with the autoimmune inflammatory condition known as Hashimoto thyroiditis^{70,71}. However, these findings are controversial and might reflect either PCR contamination or the presence of microscopic nodules of papillary carcinoma, as studies that have excluded these possibilities do not confirm the data^{57,72}. The presence of papillary microcarcinoma is not to be underestimated as a cause of this problem, as this is a common finding in up to 36% of autopsy thyroids and up to 24% of total thyroidectomies for disorders other than follicular-derived cancer^{73}. Indeed, the common occurrence of clinically insignificant papillary microcarcinomas might also be the explanation for the high frequency of multifocality in papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Mutations in BRAF were the most recently identified MAPK effector in thyroid cancer. The proto-oncogene form of BRAF situated on 7q24 encodes a serine/threonine kinase that transduces regulatory signals through the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Gain-of-function

Hypothyroidism
Results from a deficiency of thyroid hormone, and is characterized by a decrease in basal metabolic rate and by tiredness, lethargy and sensitivity to cold, as well as other, secondary symptoms.

Microcarcinoma
A tumour defined as less than 1 cm in maximum dimension. It is a recognized variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, is common, is often multifocal, and is usually considered to be an incidental finding that has no clinical significance.

Gain-of-function mutations of RET are involved in sporadic and familial C-cell-derived medullary thyroid carcinoma, including multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A (MEN2A), MEN2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma^{6}. By contrast, chimeric oncogenes, designated RET/PTC, are implicated in the development of papillary carcinoma^{51}. Somatic chromosomal rearrangement leads to fusion of the 3′-terminal sequence of RET, which encodes the tyrosine kinase domain, with the 5′-terminal sequences of heterologous genes. Although wild-type RET is not normally expressed in follicular cells, RET/PTC chimeric oncoproteins that lack a signal peptide and transmembrane domain are expressed in the cytoplasm of follicular cells, under the control of the newly acquired promoters. Ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation is induced by constitutive dimerization of the fusion proteins.

The reported overall prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements in papillary carcinomas varies from 3% to as high as 85%, depending on detection methods and the

BRAF mutation provides an alternative route for the aberrant activation of ERK signalling that is implicated in the tumorigenesis of several human cancers — for example, melanoma and colon carcinoma<sup>74</sup>. Among point mutations of exon 15 in thyroid cancers, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> is the most common alteration in sporadic papillary carcinoma<sup>47</sup>. By contrast, follicular variant papillary carcinomas show the BRAF<sup>K601E</sup> mutation, and the in-frame VK600-1E deletion (BRAF<sup>VK600-1E</sup>) has been detected in a solid variant papillary carcinoma, indicating possible phenotype–genotype correlations<sup>47,75,76</sup>.

BRAF mutations are found in 29–69% of papillary thyroid carcinoma but not in follicular thyroid carcinoma, and in up to 13% of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and 35% of undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma<sup>47,74,77–79</sup>. BRAF mutations in papillary thyroid carcinoma correlate with distant metastasis and more advanced clinical stage<sup>77</sup>, and occur at a significantly higher frequency in older patients; a gender difference is still controversial<sup>31,75,78,79</sup>. There is a high prevalence of BRAF mutations in the aggressive tall-cell variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (55–100%), whereas a relatively low prevalence has been reported in follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (7–14%)<sup>47,75,78,80</sup>. The frequency of BRAF mutations in undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas with a papillary thyroid carcinoma component is significantly higher (60–78%) than in those without such a component (0–4%)<sup>69,78</sup>. It has therefore been proposed that BRAF-mutated papillary thyroid carcinomas are more likely to behave aggressively<sup>69,78,79</sup>. Targeted expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyroid cells of transgenic mice results in papillary thyroid carcinoma with some tall-cell features and foci resembling those of poorly differentiated tumours<sup>81</sup>. By contrast, BRAF point mutations are not a significant event in post-Chernobyl (0–12%) and sporadic childhood papillary thyroid carcinomas (20%)<sup>82–84</sup>. Instead, a chromosomal rearrangement (AKAP9–BRAF) that represents yet another form of paracentric inversion has been identified in radiation-associated thyroid cancer<sup>16</sup>. Regardless of the mode of activation, these recent data highlight the crucial contribution of BRAF as an important effector in MAPK activation and thyroid tumorigenesis.

The neurotrophic receptor-tyrosine kinase NTRK1 (also known as TRK and TRKA) was the second identified subject of chromosomal rearrangement in thyroid tumorigenesis. The NTRK1 proto-oncogene (which is located on chromosome 1q22) encodes the transmembrane tyrosine-kinase receptor for nerve growth factor<sup>85</sup>. NTRK1 expression is typically restricted to neurons of the sensory spinal and cranial ganglia of neural-crest origin and regulates neuronal growth and survival<sup>86</sup>. The activated receptor initiates several signal-transduction cascades, including ERK, PI3K and the phospholipase-Cγ (PLCγ) pathways<sup>87</sup>. NTRK1 rearrangements — which show ectopic expression and constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase that are analogous to RET rearrangements — have been noted in 5–13% of sporadic but only 3% of post-Chernobyl childhood papillary thyroid carcinomas<sup>55,88–90</sup>. To date,

TPM3, TPR and TFG have been identified as fusion partners that form chimeric oncogenes, which are designated TRK, TRK-T1 and TRK-T2, and TRK-T3, in that order. The prevalence of each fusion type is nearly equal in sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas, whereas TPM3–NTRK1 is more frequent than other NTRK1 rearrangements in post-Chernobyl childhood papillary thyroid carcinomas<sup>55,89,91</sup>.

Unlike other solid neoplasms, Ras is the least prominent participant in thyroid carcinogenesis. Three Ras proto-oncogenes — HRAS (which is located on chromosome 11p11), KRAS (which is located on chromosome 12p12), and NRAS (which is located on chromosome 1p13) — are implicated in human tumorigenesis<sup>92</sup>. Mutations involving codon 61 of HRAS and NRAS have been reported with variable frequency in thyroid neoplasms<sup>93–99</sup>. Ras mutations are more common in iodine-deficient than iodine-sufficient areas and in lesions with follicular architecture (including follicular carcinoma and follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma) than in typical papillary thyroid carcinoma<sup>100,101</sup>. Interestingly, activating Ras mutations are rare in radiation-induced thyroid cancers of Chernobyl<sup>102</sup>.

Some have argued that the presence of Ras mutations in benign tumours implicates this as an early event in thyroid tumorigenesis<sup>94</sup>. However, the high degree of observer variation in the diagnosis of follicular adenoma and follicular-variant papillary thyroid carcinoma might explain this finding<sup>103,104</sup>. Moreover, there is considerable variability in the prevalence of Ras mutations in different series; this might be attributable to the techniques used. A low incidence of Ras mutation in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma was found using the most stringent techniques, and highly specific analysis indicates that Ras mutations are more common in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma, implicating this phenomenon in tumour progression<sup>96,105</sup>.

### Genetic alterations in differentiation factors

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is the subject of a unique and interesting rearrangement in follicular thyroid carcinoma. PPARγ, which is encoded by PPARG (located on chromosome 3p25), is a member of the steroid nuclear-hormone-receptor superfamily that forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptor. It is best known for its differentiating effects on adipocytes and insulin-mediated metabolic functions<sup>106</sup>. Paired-box gene 8 (PAX8)–PPARG rearrangements were first identified in thyroid neoplasms with a cytogenetically detectable translocation t(2;3)(q13;p25) that generates a chimeric gene encoding the DNA-binding domain of the thyroid-specific transcription factor PAX8 and domains A–F of PPARγ<sup>107</sup>. The PPARG rearrangement functions through a dominant-negative effect on the transcriptional activity of wild-type PPARγ<sup>107</sup>. The fusion oncprotein contributes to malignant transformation by targeting several cellular pathways, some of which are normally engaged by PPARγ<sup>108</sup>.

The PPARγ rearrangement seems to be almost restricted to follicular thyroid adenoma (0–31%) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (25–63%), with the initial indication that it correlates with a vasculo-invasive phenotype<sup>99,107,109–112</sup>. The presence of a PAX8–PPARγ rearrangement in follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma is controversial and it has not been detected in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas<sup>101,109,110,113</sup>. The extent to which these findings will broaden the application of PPARγ agonists in the treatment of follicular types of thyroid cancer remains to be determined.

### Genetic alterations in oncocytic tumours

Oncocytes are large cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm that is due to the accumulation of altered mitochondria. Proliferation of oncocytic follicular cells gives rise to hyperplasia, adenomas and carcinomas. Until recently, oncocytic thyroid neoplasms were considered distinct from other follicular-cell-derived tumours, and the criteria for malignancy were based solely on invasive behaviour. However, there were reports of non-invasive oncocytic neoplasms that were thought to be adenomas giving rise to lymph-node metastases<sup>114–116</sup>. The identification of RET/PTC rearrangements in oncocytic lesions was initially interpreted as indicative of a lack of diagnostic specificity of the rearrangements<sup>51</sup>. However, because the behaviour of such lesions includes lymph-node metastases, it should be considered a more accurate marker of metastatic potential and a diagnostic criterion of oncocytic papillary thyroid carcinoma<sup>4,116–118</sup>. Indeed, the identification of RET rearrangements and BRAF mutations in oncocytic tumours has resulted in the classification of some oncocytic neoplasms as variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma<sup>75,116</sup>. The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumours of endocrine organs has identified oncocytic neoplasms of thyroid follicular-cell differentiation as variants of papillary and follicular carcinoma<sup>4</sup>.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion and/or point mutation are common in non-neoplastic and neoplastic thyroid cells that show morphological oncocytic changes, indicating a contribution of mtDNA alterations to the oncocytic process<sup>119–121</sup>. However, it is not clear if this represents a separate and distinct process from neoplastic transformation. Several studies have demonstrated a positive effect of mtDNA mutation on cell growth and tumorigenicity<sup>122,123</sup>. The identification of somatic and germline missense mutations in GRIM19 (which is located on chromosome 19p13.2) in oncocytic follicular and papillary thyroid carcinoma, but not in oncocytic follicular adenoma or non-oncocytic thyroid carcinoma, is more consistent with a dual function of this gene in mitochondrial metabolism and cell death<sup>124</sup>. Clearly, further investigations are necessary to clarify whether mtDNA mutation truly contributes to initiation and/or progression, or principally to the oncocytic phenotype in thyroid neoplasia.

### Thyroid neoplasia progression

The genetic events that have been identified in thyroid cancer indicate a pattern of cumulative alterations that have a role in initiation, progression and de-differentiation (TABLE 2). However, there is a spectrum of biological behaviours of well-differentiated thyroid cancer; many are microscopic lesions identified incidentally, others are slow-growing but non-metastatic neoplasms, and some give rise to local and distant metastases. Signalling through growth factors and their receptors is considered essential for cancer progression, and some of these growth factors and receptors have been identified as modifiers of the behaviour of transformed thyroid cells (FIG. 4). Similarly, cell-cycle regulators and adhesion molecules are altered in thyroid carcinomas in conjunction with tumour progression. Fibroblast growth

De-differentiation  
Loss of the differentiated characteristics that define mature cells with the full capacity for normal physiological function. In the thyroid, these characteristics include formation of thyroid follicles and production of thyroglobulin and the sodium iodide symporter.

The receptor-tyrosine kinase **MET** (which is located on chromosome 7q31) is the main signalling receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (**HGF**). HGF–MET signalling regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in normal embryonic development<sup>133</sup>. MET is often overexpressed in papillary thyroid carcinomas (77–93%), but is rare in other histological types of thyroid tumour<sup>134–136</sup>. HGF–MET signalling in papillary thyroid carcinomas modulates thyroid cancer cell motility and invasiveness and promotes angiogenesis<sup>137,138</sup>. Point mutations involving **MET** were noted in 7% of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, either as somatic or germline mutations; no association was observed between **MET** mutation and protein level<sup>139</sup>. **MET** overexpression in thyroid carcinoma is thought to be regulated by transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms as a secondary effect. For example, mutant Ras or RET can induce **MET** overexpression in thyroid follicular cells<sup>140</sup>. Therefore, the pathogenetic significance of **MET** expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma remains to be identified<sup>135,141</sup>.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (**EGFR**) family includes **EGFR** (also known as ERBB1 and HER1), **ERBB2** (also known as HER2), **ERBB3** (also known as HER3) and **ERBB4** (also known as HER4). All are involved in the transmission of signals that control cell growth and differentiation<sup>142</sup>. Multiple ligands bind **EGFR**, **ERBB3** or **ERBB4**, inducing rapid receptor dimerization, with a marked preference for **ERBB2** as a dimer partner. Thyroid tumours overexpress **EGFRs** and ligands, implicating **EGFR** signalling in thyroid tumorigenesis<sup>143,144</sup>. Indeed, **EGF** stimulates the growth of human thyroid carcinoma cells and rat FRTL-5 cells *in vitro*<sup>145,146</sup>. Although **ERBB2** amplification is important in breast cancer, no activating mutations or DNA amplification of **EGFRs** were found in human thyroid neoplasia<sup>147,148</sup>. Increased expression of **EGFR** correlates with poor prognosis, whereas **ERBB2** has no clear prognostic significance<sup>148–150</sup>.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (**VEGF**) ligands — **VEGFA**, **VEGFB**, **VEGFC** and **VEGFD** — bind their cognate receptors and induce proliferation of endothelial and/or lymphatic cells. **VEGFA** and **VEGFB** are angiogenic proteins, whereas **VEGFC** and **VEGFD** are primarily lymphangiogenic proteins. Increased expression of **VEGFs** has been reported in thyroid carcinomas<sup>151–153</sup>. Overexpression of **VEGFC** and **VEGFD** in papillary thyroid carcinoma correlates with the density of lymphatics and lymph-node metastasis<sup>153–157</sup>. Increased expression of **VEGFA** might contribute to the papillary morphogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinomas<sup>158</sup>.

## Cell-cycle regulation

The growth activity of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma is low compared with poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas; the MIB-1 index is 1–3% in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, 6–7% in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas and 14–52% in undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas<sup>159–163</sup>. Altered cell-cycle regulators govern these differences in growth activity. Progression factors (for example, **cyclin D1**, **cyclin E1**, cyclin-dependent kinases (**CDKs**) and **E2Fs**) and competitor factors (for example, retinoblastoma

Figure 4 | Cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions in thyroid cancer cells. Autocrine and paracrine growth-factor signalling has been implicated in thyroid carcinogenesis. Growth factors and their receptors that signal between stromal and endothelial/ carcinoma cells include: fibroblast growth factor (**FGF**)–**FGF** receptor (**FGFR**), epidermal growth factor (**EGF**)–**EGF** receptor (**EGFR**), hepatocyte growth factor (**HGF**)–**MET**, and vascular endothelial growth factor (**VEGF**)–**VEGF** receptor (**VEGFR**). In normal endothelial cells, β-catenin binds the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin as an adhesive component, mediating the Wnt signalling pathway. Defects in Wnt signalling occur in carcinoma cells, resulting in β-catenin stabilization and translocation to the nucleus, and expression of cyclin D1 and MYC. Additionally, loss of E-cadherin is associated with increased invasion and cell motility. Fibronectin is upregulated at the protein and mRNA levels in papillary thyroid carcinoma, but its effect on tumour cell proliferation, adhesion and migration remains to be determined.

factors (**FGFs**) and **FGF** receptors (**FGFRs**) are important regulators of angiogenesis and tumorigenesis<sup>125</sup>. At least 23 **FGF** ligands that signal through a complex family of receptor-tyrosine kinases, encoded by four distinct **FGFR** genes, have been reported. Expression of **FGF2** (also known as basic **FGF**) is increased in thyroid cancer<sup>126</sup>. **FGF2** promotes mitogenic activity of rat thyroid follicular cells<sup>127,128</sup>. Contrasting expression patterns of **FGFRs** are identified in non-neoplastic and neoplastic thyroid<sup>129</sup>. Normal adult thyroid expresses **FGFR2**, and mice that are deficient for the **FGFR2**-IIIb variant show agenesis and dysgenesis of multiple organs, including thyroid<sup>130</sup>. By contrast, **FGFR1**, **FGFR3** and **FGFR4** are expressed in thyroid carcinoma<sup>129,131</sup>. **FGFR3** overexpression in a human thyroid carcinoma cell line results in overgrowth in confluent cultures<sup>132</sup>. **FGFR4** expression seems to be restricted to the aggressive phenotype, with conspicuous absence of **FGFR4** in more indolent forms of thyroid carcinoma<sup>129</sup>. So far, however, no mutations or rearrangements that involve members of the **FGFR** family have been identified in thyroid cancer.

Figure 5 | Cell-cycle regulation in follicular cells. Cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 cooperate to control the G1 to S phase transition through interactions with retinoblastoma protein (RB). Cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 heterodimerize with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 2, respectively, to inactivate the tumour suppressor RB by phosphorylation. Active RB functions as a repressor of E2F transcription factors, whereas inactivation (phosphorylation) of RB allows E2F transcriptional activity. E2F activates the transcription of genes that are involved in the G1 to S phase transition, such as DNA polymerase and thymidine kinase. The CDK inhibitors p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, p21<sup>CIP1</sup> and p27<sup>KIP1</sup> impair the activity of cyclin–CDK complexes, thereby preventing phosphorylation of RB. The CDK inhibitors therefore function as tumour suppressors. The tumour suppressor p53 induces cell-cycle arrest by upregulating p21<sup>CIP1</sup>, which initiates apoptosis. The function of p53 is controlled by negative regulators, including MDM2. The MDM2 protein targets p53 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, constituting a feedback loop to maintain a low concentration of p53 in the cells.

protein (RB), p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, p21<sup>CIP1</sup>, p27<sup>KIP1</sup> and p53 regulate the transition from G1 to S phase (FIG. 5).

Cyclin–CDK complexes promote cell-cycle progression through inactivation of RB. Although nuclear immunoreactivity for cyclin D1 (which is encoded by CCND1 on chromosome 11q13) and cyclin E1 (which is encoded by CCNE1 on chromosome 19q12) are not detectable in normal thyroid follicular cells, expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 is observed in approximately 30% and 76% of papillary thyroid carcinomas, respectively<sup>164-168</sup>. Furthermore, cyclin D1 overexpression correlates with metastatic spread in papillary thyroid carcinomas, and significant overexpression of cyclin D1 is observed in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma<sup>169-171</sup>. The copy number of CCND1 is amplified in a number of human neoplasms; however, neither major genetic alterations nor amplification of CCND1 and CCNE1 have been found in thyroid cancers<sup>165,166,169</sup>. So, overexpression of cyclins is probably a secondary effect that is induced by other genetic aberrations in thyroid tumours.

CDK inhibitors are commonly downregulated in thyroid neoplasia. There is progressive loss of p21<sup>CIP1</sup> (which is encoded by CDKN1A on chromosome 6p21) with advancing tumour stage of papillary thyroid carcinomas, and 13% of papillary thyroid carcinomas harbour CDKN1A deletions<sup>172,173</sup>. Normal and hyperplastic follicular cells show strong immunoreactivity for p27<sup>KIP1</sup> (which is encoded by CDKN1B on chromosome 12p13), whereas p27<sup>KIP1</sup> expression is significantly reduced in papillary thyroid carcinoma, mainly metastatic forms and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma<sup>162,169,174,175</sup>. Point mutations of CDKN2A (which encodes p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and is located on chromosome 9p21) are rare in thyroid tumours<sup>176-178</sup>. However, LOH in the region of CDKN2A is associated with follicular thyroid carcinoma (27%) and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (50%)<sup>177</sup>. Moreover, methylation of the 5′ CpG island of CDKN2A is detected in 30% of thyroid neoplasms<sup>178</sup>.

The E2F transcription-factor family — the main targets of RB — consists of six members: E2F1–E2F6. **E2F1**, but not other members of this family, is upregulated in 35–89% of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 34% of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and 67% of undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma<sup>162,179</sup>. In immunohistochemical analyses, E2F1 is detectable when cyclin D1 is overexpressed<sup>167</sup>. The expression pattern of RB in benign and malignant thyroid lesions is controversial<sup>179,180</sup>. Although one group reported mutant RB1 (which is located on chromosome 13q14) in 55% of thyroid carcinomas, this has not been confirmed by other investigators<sup>166</sup>.

The tumour-suppressor gene TP53 (which is located on chromosome 17p53) seems to be a crucial gatekeeper of progression from indolent to lethal thyroid cancers, as evidenced by the restricted mutation of TP53 in aggressive lesions (17–38% of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and 67–88% of undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma versus 0–9% of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma)<sup>181-187</sup>. Activation of wild-type p53 can lead to G1 cell-cycle arrest through p21<sup>CIP1</sup>, and apoptotic cell death, preventing replication of cells with damaged DNA. Conversely, loss-of-function mutation of TP53 induces genomic instability, owing to weakened DNA repair systems, and subsequent cancer progression.

Adhesion molecules and the extracellular matrix

Tumour cells are held together by direct cell–cell contact and by adhesion to the extracellular matrix (FIG. 4). Loss of adhesion is thought to promote tumour invasiveness and increase the metastatic potential of many human carcinomas.

Cadherins belong to a family of single-transmembrane calcium-dependent cell–cell adhesion proteins. There are three classical cadherins: neuronal (N)-, placental (P)- and epithelial (E)-cadherin. **E-cadherin** (which is encoded by CDH1 on chromosome 16q22) is highly expressed in normal thyroid and benign adenomas. Expression of E-cadherin is maintained in some well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, including minimally invasive lesions; however, in widely invasive, recurrent or metastatic thyroid carcinomas expression of E-cadherin is low or absent<sup>188-190</sup>. Expression of E-cadherin in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma is extremely low<sup>188</sup>. This is not likely to be attributable to mutation as somatic mutations of CDH1

are infrequent in thyroid cancers<sup>191,192</sup>. Methylation of the CDH1 promoter might underlie underexpression<sup>190,193</sup>. Cadherin switching is a documented phenomenon in cancer, and there is evidence for neo-expression of P-cadherin in areas of squamous metaplasia of papillary thyroid carcinoma<sup>193</sup>. N-cadherin expression is observed in several human thyroid carcinoma cell lines that lack E-cadherin<sup>194</sup>. However, this is not reflective of the *in vivo* situation, in which no N-cadherin expression has been detected in benign or malignant follicular epithelium<sup>192</sup>.

**β-Catenin** (which is encoded by CTNNB1 on chromosome 3p22–21.3) binds the cytoplasmic tail of cadherins, and has two main functions in cell regulation — as a cadherin-mediated adhesion regulator and as a mediator of Wnt–β-catenin signalling, which targets cyclin D1 and MYC. Normal thyroid follicular cells express membranous β-catenin, expression of which is progressively reduced with loss of tumour differentiation<sup>195,196</sup>. Although increased cytoplasmic β-catenin is observed in thyroid cancer cells, it seems that nuclear localization is restricted to poorly differentiated (21%) and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas (48%)<sup>195,197</sup>. Nuclear localization of β-catenin is induced by CTNNB1 mutations rather than APC mutation in thyroid cancers — mutations of CTNNB1 are observed in 0–25% of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas and up to 66% of undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas, but not in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas<sup>192,195,198,199</sup>. These observations indicate that CTNNB1 mutation contributes to progression towards poorly differentiated or undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas.

Somatic or germline mutations in the APC–β-catenin pathway were thought to underlie a peculiar histological subtype of papillary thyroid cancer designated the ‘cribriform’ variant<sup>4,200</sup>. In keeping with its classification as a variant of papillary carcinoma, this unusual tumour generally behaves in an indolent manner, and is more common in younger women. However it typically occurs in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and only rarely as a sporadic tumour<sup>4,201</sup>. Some investigators have questioned the role of APC–β-catenin in those lesions that also harbour RET/PTC gene rearrangements<sup>202</sup>. Therefore the implications of cribriform papillary carcinoma for understanding the role of aberrant APC–β-catenin signalling in tumour progression remain to be determined.

Fibronectin (which is encoded by FN1 on chromosome 2q35) is an extracellular matrix protein that regulates cell adhesion, migration, tumour invasion and metastasis. Fibronectin expression is upregulated in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma compared with normal thyroid tissue<sup>203,204</sup>. By contrast, reduced fibronectin expression is documented in transformed cell lines and at the periphery of invasive well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma<sup>205,206</sup>. Consistent with the presence of a vitamin-D response element in the FN1 promoter, vitamin-D compounds increase fibronectin expression and restore thyroid cancer cell adhesiveness, whereas downregulation of fibronectin expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) results in diminished cell adhesion<sup>207</sup>. Moreover, the tumour suppressor PTEN increases fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion, whereas siRNA-mediated downregulation of

PTEN attenuates fibronectin expression and adhesion<sup>207</sup>. The attenuated expression of fibronectin is associated with resistance to vitamin-D growth-suppressive action<sup>207</sup>. These findings underscore the significance of the adhesive functions of fibronectin in modulating neoplastic thyroid cancer cell behaviour.

Taken together, thyroid cancer represents a model of solid neoplasia in which the loss of adhesion serves to promote tumour invasiveness and increase metastatic potential. The frequently indolent nature of thyroid microcarcinomas that harbour genetic defects in initiation factors (for example, RET/PTC, Ras and BRAF), but lack defects in adhesive functions indicates the importance of progression factors, such as those that mediate cell adhesion, in dictating tumour behaviour.

### Biomarkers of thyroid cancer

Papillary thyroid carcinoma comprises more than 80% of thyroid epithelial malignancies in countries where goitre is not endemic. The architecture of these neoplasms varies from an almost pure papillary pattern to a pure follicular pattern; many tumours have a mixed papillary and follicular pattern. It is now recognized that the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma is based on cytological criteria — this is specified in the WHO classification on thyroid tumours as ‘a distinctive set of nuclear characteristics’<sup>4</sup>. However, no one specific feature is absolutely diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Until now, pathologists have had to rely on a constellation of nuclear features for the diagnosis, which has led to inconsistencies in diagnosing thyroid cancers<sup>104</sup>. Moreover, among the large group of papillary carcinomas there are few reliable features that distinguish the small subgroup of metastatic malignancies. Therefore, biomarkers are clearly needed as ancillary tools to aid in the cytological and pathological diagnosis of most thyroid tumours.

Several molecules that are involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancers are emerging as diagnostic and/or prognostic tools for patient management<sup>208</sup>. Genetic defects such as RET rearrangements and BRAF mutations can now be detected pre-operatively in cytological specimens to improve diagnosis and determine appropriate therapy<sup>80,209</sup>. Underexpression of p27<sup>KIP1</sup> and overexpression of cyclin D1 are strong independent predictors of lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid carcinomas<sup>170</sup>. Nuclear localization of β-catenin and stabilization of p53 are characteristics of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma, respectively<sup>181–186,195</sup>.

Controversies in patient management have also been addressed by the analysis of molecular changes that underlie tumorigenesis. As an example, multifocality is a unique and frequently encountered characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinomas<sup>73,210</sup>. The presence of multiple microcarcinomas in the same gland has been the rationale for aggressive surgery in patients with low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma, as it was thought to indicate intrathyroidal dissemination through the lymphatic system from a primary tumour. However, clonality assessment using RET/PTC rearrangements or X-chromosome-inactivation analyses has revealed

Immunopositive staining using HBME1 — an antibody that was raised against mesothelial cells — is seen in more than half of thyroid follicular-cell-derived malignancies in pathological thyroid specimens²¹⁸. However, its corresponding antigen, proteins or genes remain to be elucidated.

Distinctive gene-expression profiles are also observed between papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas²²⁰. Papillary thyroid carcinoma shows overexpression of CITED1, CLDN10 (which encodes claudin 10) and IGFBP6 (which encodes insulin-like-growth-factor-binding protein 6), whereas follicular thyroid carcinoma shows no expression of CLDN10 and underexpression of IGFBP6 and/or CAV1 (which encodes caveolin 1) and CAV2. Such sets of genes require wider validation to permit adoption as ancillary diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for thyroid cancer.

### Future directions

Thyroid neoplasms show a wide range of biological behaviours from indolence to highly aggressive, invasive and metastatic cancers. The identification in most sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas of exclusive, non-overlapping activating mutations or rearrangements along the MAPK pathway — including those of RET/PTC, NTRK1, Ras and BRAF — has greatly aided our understanding of thyroid cell transformation⁴⁷,⁷⁷.

The challenge now will be to identify modifying factors — particularly those that mediate tissue, vascular and lymphatic invasion — that represent features of virulent forms of the human disease. These studies will offer insights into the stepwise progression of neoplasia, providing unique signatures for accurate diagnosis and prognosis (FIG. 2). The molecular alterations that have been identified in this disease also represent targets for early clinical trials that are aimed at tailoring multimodal approaches to the treatment of thyroid cancers²²¹,²²².
