### Abstract

A defining feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of a nuclear envelope separating transcription and DNA replication in the nucleus from the site of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression relies in part on the controlled exchange of molecules between these two compartments. Factors implicated in transcription regulation and DNA replication have to be imported into the nucleus, whereas RNAs produced in the nucleus have to be exported, either to fulfill their function in protein synthesis or to mature into functional particles. This review summarizes studies performed over the last 15 years that led to the identification of cellular factors mediating nuclear export of the different classes of RNAs, including tRNAs, UsnRNAs, micro-RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and mRNAs. We also discuss recent evidence indicating that the nuclear transport step is intimately linked to RNA synthesis, processing and mRNP assembly, thus ensuring that only properly matured ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes reach the cytoplasm.

### 1. Overview on nuclear transport

#### 1.1. The nuclear pore complex

Bi-directional exchange between the nucleus and the cytoplasm occurs via nuclear pore complexes (NPC), huge macromolecular assemblies ranging from 50 MDa in yeast to 125 MDa in mammals, inserted in the nuclear envelope, as reviewed by (Suntharalingam, et al., 2003; Vasu, et al., 2001). The NPC channel allows passive diffusion of ions, small metabolites and proteins under 40 kDa. Larger proteins and RNA molecules, in the form of ribonucleoprotein complexes, are moved through the pore by virtue of an energy dependent and signal-mediated process, which involves specific and saturable transport receptors (Fried, et al., 2003).

The three-dimensional structure of the NPC is evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 1). It presents an 8-fold rotational symmetry perpendicular to the membrane, and is asymmetric with respect to the plane of the nuclear envelope. The NPC consists of three major parts. The central part or core of the NPC, which contains the 10 nm channel, appears as a cylindrical structure inserted in the nuclear envelope and is composed of 8 spoke-ring complexes sandwiched between nuclear and cytoplasmic rings. Flexible fibrils extend from the cytoplasmic ring, whereas filaments protrude from the nuclear face and connect at their distal end to a ring. This structure is termed the nuclear basket (Fahrenkrog, et al., 2001; Rout, et al., 2001). It appears that the nuclear basket and central channel dilate in response to the translocation of large cargoes increasing the effective diameter up to 40 nm (Kiseleva, et al., 1998).

Proteomic analyses of purified yeast or mammalian nuclear pores revealed that these huge complexes are composed of no more than 30 different nucleoporins or Nups, each present in 8 to 56 copies per pore consistent with its octagonal symmetry (Cronshaw, et al., 2002; Rout, et al., 2000). Nucleoporins belong to three main classes. The pore membrane proteins anchor the NPC within the double membrane system of the nuclear envelope. The FG-nucleoporins are characterized by the presence of repeats of the amino acid sequences FG, GLFG or FXFG separated by hydrophilic linkers. Yeast contains eleven FG-nucleoporins, which account for about half the NPC mass, as reviewed by (Fabre, et

**Fig. 1.** Schematic drawing of the conserved three-dimensional structure of the NPC. The main parts of the NPC are indicated. The central core consists of spokes (S) sandwiched between nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (R). FG-nucleoporins span the whole nuclear pore complex. Biochemically defined NPC sub-complexes containing FG-nucleoporins (red fonts) are drawn as boxes at their proposed location within the conserved three-dimensional structure of the NPC. Yeast NPC sub-complexes are indicated on the left and the functional homologues in metazoans on the right. NPC sub-complexes lacking FG-nucleoporins have been omitted. The small Ran-GTPase and its cytoplasmic effectors, RanBP1, the NPC-associated RanBP2 and the RanGAP, bound to RanBP2 *via* SUMO in higher eukaryotes, are shown in yellow.

al., 1997). FG-Nups are essential for translocation as their FG-repeats directly interact with transport receptors, i.e., importins or exportins (Bednenko, et al., 2003; Stewart, et al., 2001). Nucleoporins of the third class present a variety of motifs and are primarily structural components of the NPC. These Nups participate in transport indirectly probably by ensuring proper positioning of FG-nucleoporins within the pore. Noteworthy, only 10 of the yeast Nups are absolutely required for growth indicating extensive functional redundancy among NPC constituents (Fabre, et al., 1997; Suntharalingam, et al., 2003). Yeast and metazoan Nups show limited similarity and homologues were in part defined by virtue of similar localization or association with specific sub-complexes, as well as by functional criteria.

Tandem affinity purification (TAP-tag) strategies with pore constituents have been instrumental in identifying specific NPC sub-complexes and in constructing a nuclear pore complex interaction map (Siniossoglou, et al., 2000). Ge-

netic analyses and the identification of transport defects in conditional mutants in yeast allowed to assign primary roles in nuclear import or export to specific Nups or NPC subcomplexes (Amberg, et al., 1992; Cole, et al., 2002; Fabre, et al., 1997). The functional characterization of Nups in higher eukaryotes greatly relied on assaying pore assembly and nuclear transport in nuclei reconstituted from immunodepleted Xenopus egg extracts (Vasu, et al., 2001). These studies have more recently been complemented by RNAi based strategies in tissue-cultured cells (Harel, et al., 2003; Walther, et al., 2003).

An important step in the building of translocation models was the localization of all yeast nucleoporins within the yeast NPC three-dimensional structure by ProteinA tagging of individual Nups followed by immuno-electron microscopy (Rout, et al., 2000). This systematic approach revealed that, despite the apparent asymmetry of the NPC, most nucleoporins are symmetrically located on both sides of the pore. Only 5 FG-nucleoporins exhibited a fully asymmetrical distribution: Nup60p, Nup1p and Nup2p were found exclusively on the nuclear side probably in association with the basket, whereas Nup159 and Nup42 were present solely on the cytoplasmic side and presumed constituents of the cytoplasmic fibrils. The distribution of three other FG-nucleoporins, Nup100p, Nup116p and Nup145p, was either cytoplasmic- or nuclear-biased, whereas the last three FG-Nups, Nsp1p, Nup49p and Nup57p were fully symmetrical and proposed to be part of the central core. Most yeast FG-nucleoporins have metazoan homologues with comparable locations within the NPC. For example, Nup153, Nup62, and Nup214, corresponding to yeast Nup1p, Nsp1p and Nup159p, have been localized respectively to the nuclear basket, the central core and the cytoplasmic fibrils (Suntharalingam, et al., 2003; Vasu, et al., 2001) and (Fig. 1). One exception is Nup358/RanBP2, a metazoan specific FG-nucleoporin restricted to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC. Nup358/RanBP2 and all the other asymmetrically distributed FG-nucleoporins have been proposed to function in terminal steps of nucleocytoplasmic transport, by providing platforms for the dissociation of transport complexes, as reviewed by (Fried, et al., 2003; Macara, 2001) and see below.

### 1.2. General features of the GTPase Ran and transport receptors

Translocation of most proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes through the nuclear pores is a process that involves specific signals recognized by specific receptors. Car-goes contain targeting motifs (nuclear import or export signals) that correspond either to particular amino acid or nucleotide sequences or, alternatively, to conformational motifs. With the exception of mRNA (see part 3), these targeting signals are recognized by members of the karyopherin-β family of receptors (also named importins and exportins) that are responsible for the majority of nucleo-cytoplasmic exchanges in eukaryotes, reviewed in (Gorlich, et al., 1999;

Moore, et al., 1995). Besides their ability to bind their respective cargoes as well as the FG-repeats of nucleoporins, members of this family of receptors are characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain, which interacts with the GTP-bound form of the small GTPase Ran (Moore, et al., 1993). Ran is an abundant cellular GTPase and a member of the Ras superfamily. Like other GTPases, Ran exists in either a GDP- or a GTP-bound state and uses regulatory proteins to stimulate inter-conversion between the two guanine nucleotide forms. The Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RanGEF, also called RCC1) is located in the nucleus, where it associates with chromatin through binding to histones H2A and H2B (Nemergut, et al., 2001). The Ran GTPase activating protein (RanGAP) is located on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, as well as in the cytoplasm (Hopper, et al., 1990; Mahajan, et al., 1998; Matunis, et al., 1998). Similarly, the co-factors for RanGAP activation, RanBP2 and RanBP1, are located at the NPC and in the cytoplasm, respectively (Coutavas, et al., 1993; Wu, et al., 1995; Yokoyama, et al., 1995). Finally, NTF2, a RanGDP-binding protein, mediates the nuclear import of Ran in its GDP-bound form (Ribbeck, et al., 1998). The distribution of the Ran regulatory proteins results in efficient conversion of RanGDP to RanGTP in the nucleus, and RanGTP to RanGDP in the cytoplasm. The asymmetric distribution of the two guanine nucleotide forms of Ran is thought to impart directionality to nuclear transport because import and export complexes are regulated differently by RanGTP. Nuclear import complexes, upon arriving on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, are induced to disassemble when RanGTP binds to the receptor. In contrast, RanGTP binding to export receptors in the nucleus stimulates the assembly of export complexes, but GTP hydrolysis on Ran is not required for their translocation, reviewed in (Gorlich, et al., 1999; Mattaj, et al., 1998).

### 1.3. Translocation through the NPC and cargo release into the cytoplasm

Translocation of receptor-cargo complexes through the NPC channel per se, is independent of energy provided by NTP hydrolysis, and has been proposed to occur by a process of facilitated diffusion. The well-established requirement for RanGTP hydrolysis in multiple rounds of nuclear transport reflects the necessity to dissociate and recycle import and export receptors. Two main models have been proposed to explain how the selectivity of the central channel is established, and how interactions between receptor-cargo complexes and FG-nucleoporins generate directional movement through the NPC.

The “Brownian affinity gate model” by Rout and colleagues proposed that FG-nucleoporins form multiple waving filaments at both ends of the NPC. The affinity of importins or exportins for these flexible filaments, moved by Brownian motion, would increase the residence time of receptor-cargo complexes at the nuclear periphery and the probability of their access to the NPC central channel. Following initial docking, complexes would randomly move through the pores by a process of facilitated diffusion based on sequential low-affinity interactions with FG-nucleoporins spanning the central tube. Selectivity would be achieved by the inability of large and inert molecules to interact with FG-nucleoporins. The diffusive movement of filamentous FG-nucleoporins at the nuclear periphery would further contribute to this exclusion (Rout, et al., 2003; Rout, et al., 2000).

Another model for achieving selectivity of translocation through the NPC is the “selective phase model.” This proposes that the central channel is filled by a meshwork of nucleoporins that weakly interact via their FG-repeat domains, constituting the diffusion barrier. Transient and low-affinity interactions with FG-repeats would allow the carrier to partition and dissolve into that structure. In this case, facilitated diffusion of the transport complexes would involve relieving the interactions between nucleoporins and formation of the receptor-nucleoporin interactions (Ribbeck, et al., 2001; Ribbeck, et al., 2002).

The Ran GTPase system is clearly a key determinant of transport directionality, however, it was postulated that a gradient of increasing affinities of transport receptor binding sites along the translocation pathway through the pore contributes to directional movement of transport complexes (Bednenko, et al., 2003; Ben-Efraim, et al., 2001; Pyhtila, et al., 2003; Rexach, et al., 1995). Vectorial movement may therefore be enhanced by the trapping of import or export complexes at high-affinity terminal binding sites provided by the asymmetric FG-nucleoporins. Such trapping may enhance transport efficiency by preventing reverse movement of complexes and by coupling facilitated translocation through the pore to substrate dissociation from the carrier in the target compartment. For example, Nup358/RanBP2, Nup62, and Nup153 implicated in importin-β-dependent nuclear import, present increasing affinities for this receptor (Shah, et al., 1998). Interestingly, nuclei assembled in the absence of Nup358/RanBP2 still support importin-β-dependent nuclear import, whereas nuclei depleted of Nup153 do not. These observations indicate that docking on the cytoplasmic face is not essential for import. In contrast, binding to Nup153 on the nuclear basket is required, possibly because it helps import complexes to escape the central channel by increasing their chance of binding nuclear RanGTP (Walther, et al., 2001; Walther, et al., 2002). Conversely, the asymmetric FG-nucleoporins Nup214 and Nup358/RanBP2 located on the cytoplasmic filaments are likely to act as a terminal trap for export complexes.

In the case of karyopherin β-dependent export routes, the release of cargoes into the cytoplasm is induced by the dissociation of RanGTP from exportins through direct interaction with another class of RanGTP-binding proteins, RanBP1 and RanBP2. These proteins not only destabilize export complexes but also stimulate RanGAP-dependent hydrolysis of RanGTP to RanGDP, rendering the dissociation reaction irreversible, since exportins have no measurable

affinity for RanGDP (Kehlenbach, et al., 1999). RanBP2 is especially appealing, because it is a nucleoporin localized on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC that contains multiple FG-repeats thought to provide general binding sites for transport receptors, as well as zinc fingers, which may specifically bind exportins (Singh, et al., 1999; Wu, et al., 1995; Yaseen, et al., 1999; Yokoyama, et al., 1995). In addition, SUMO-modified RanGAP is physically bound to RanBP2 (Mahajan, et al., 1998). Therefore RanBP2 may provide a spatial control of the Ran dissociation reaction, ensuring that export complexes interact with the Ran-binding domains of RanBP2, facilitating RanGAP dependent GTP hydrolysis immediately after translocation through the nuclear pores.

a necessary, sufficient, and transferable signal capable of directing highly efficient nuclear export. Nuclear export mediated by the leucine-rich NES was shown to be saturable, suggesting it is a receptor-mediated process. A major clue to the identity of the NES receptor came from the finding that an anti-fungal antibiotic, leptomycin B (LMB), was able to inhibit both Rev and Rev-mediated RNA export in cultured cells (Wolff, et al., 1997). Additional data showed that LMB inhibits export of distinct NES-containing proteins in different experimental models, suggesting that the drug could directly affect a component of the export machinery (Fornerod, et al., 1997a; Fukuda, et al., 1997; Ossareh-Nazari, et al., 1997). The gene encoding the target protein inhibited by LMB was identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and shown to correspond to an essential nuclear protein termed Crm1, originally identified as a protein required for chromosome maintenance (Adachi, et al., 1989; Nishi, et al., 1994). Human CRM1 was identified based on its ability to bind nucleoporins and in particular Nup214 (Fornerod, et al., 1997b). The low but significant sequence relatedness between the N-terminal domains of CRM1 and the then-emerging members of the karyopherin/importin β family of import receptors suggested that CRM1 was likely to be a transport receptor. This property together with the LMB-sensitivity of Crm1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were consistent with the possibility that CRM1 could be the NES receptor. Ultimately, studies from different laboratories demonstrated that CRM1 directly interacts with the leucine-rich NES in a RanGTP dependent and LMB-sensitive manner (Fornerod, et al., 1997a; Fukuda, et al., 1997; Ossareh-Nazari, et al., 1997). NES-dependent nuclear export is also inhibited in strains of budding or fission yeast containing mutations in Crmlp (Fukuda, et al., 1997; Stade, et al., 1997) and the addition of LMB blocks NES-dependent export in S. pombe and in S. cerevisiae strains engineered to express an LMB sensitive Crmlp protein (Neville, et al., 1999). In summary, studies performed in yeast cells, frog oocytes, and permeabilized mammalian cells all indicated that CRM1 is a receptor for the leucine-rich NES, and that an interaction between CRM1 and the NES is essential for NES-mediated nuclear export (Table 1 and Figure 2).

2. Exportin-dependent nuclear export of RNAs

2.1. Crm1-dependent nuclear export

2.1.1. Historic

Use of indirect assays based on antibody microinjection, heterokaryon cell fusion (Borer, et al., 1989; Meier, et al., 1992) or microinjection into Xenopus oocyte nuclei (Schmidt-Zachmann, et al., 1993), led to the identification of diverse cellular or viral proteins, including hnRNP Al or the HIV-1 Rev protein, that are exported very rapidly from the nucleus (Meyer, et al., 1994; Pinol-Roma, et al., 1992). Detailed mutational analysis of these proteins allowed the identification of the signals that mediate nuclear export, called nuclear export signals (NES). The leucine-rich NES was discovered originally in two proteins, the cellular protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) that terminates PKA-dependent signaling to nuclear targets by exporting PKA out of the nucleus (Wen, et al., 1995), and the HIV-1 Rev protein (Fischer, et al., 1995). Rev binds to a cis-acting RNA sequence, the Rev-responsive element (RRE), which is present in unspliced and partially spliced viral mRNAs. Rev facilitates nuclear export of these RNAs to the cytoplasm of infected cells, a function that is necessary for viral protein expression and packaging of unspliced RNA into virions. In the absence of Rev, these viral transcripts are retained in the nucleus where they are either fully spliced or degraded. Two domains of Rev are necessary for its export activity. The first domain directly contacts the Rev-response element in the RNA, and the second domain contains a leucine-rich NES sequence similar to that found in PKI, reviewed in (Nigg, 1997). Competition experiments were used to show that injecting an excess of Rev NES into frog oocyte nuclei blocks Rev, as well as 5S ribosomal RNA and U1 snRNA export (Fischer, et al., 1995). This result suggested that several cellular RNA export pathways use components that are common to NES-dependent nuclear export. It would later be shown that one of the shared components is the NES receptor CRM1.

The NES characterized in Rev and PKI consists of a ten amino acid sequence enriched in hydrophobic residues, including leucines, essential for export function and represents

2.1.2. Export of pre-snRNAs

Major spliceosomal U snRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, but require to be exported to the cytoplasm to associate with Sm proteins and become hyper-methylated on their 5′ cap structure. Once mature, functional snRNPs are re-imported back into the nucleus (Hamm, et al., 1990a; Luhrmann, 1990). Both competition experiments with the Rev protein or NES peptides, and inhibition of export with leptomycin B revealed that CRM1 is responsible for the transport of UsnRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fischer, et al., 1995; Fornerod, et al., 1997a). However, CRM1 does not directly interact with snRNAs and therefore requires adaptor proteins to be recruited. The monomethylated cap structure represents a common export

signal for snRNAs and has been shown to be recognized by an heterodimeric cap-binding complex (CBC) composed of CBP20 and CBP80 (Hamm, et al., 1990b; Izaurralde, et al., 1995). An additional protein, PHAX (phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export), then mediates an interaction between the snRNA/CBC complex with CRM1 (Ohno, et al., 2000). Although PHAX presents a leucine-rich NES, its phosphorylation in the nucleus is essential for the formation of an export complex with CRM1 and RanGTP, possibly by inducing a conformational change that unmasks the NES. Once arrived on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, the concerted action of RanGAP and RanBPs leads to the release of RanGTP from the export complex and dissociation of CRM1 (Black, et al., 2001; Fornerod, et al., 1997a; Kehlenbach, et al., 1999; Singh, et al., 1999). Dephosphorylation of PHAX causes its disassembly and finally interaction of CBC with importin α allows CBC to be released from snRNAs (Gorlich, et al., 1996; Ohno, et al., 2000). PHAX and CBC are subsequently re-imported to the nucleus where they are available for a new round of transport.

### 2.1.3. Export of ribosomal subunits
Ribosomal subunits are assembled in the nucleolus from large 35S rRNA synthesized by RNA polymerase I, subsequent to processing into 28S, 18S, and 5.8S rRNAs. The 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits are exported through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) via specific pathways. The 60S subunit is exported by CRM1, while the 40S subunit uses a different export pathway involving other factors.

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 2. The different classes of RNAs are exported via distinct pathways. CRM1 mediates the export of UsnRNAs and ribosomal subunits through interaction with specific adaptor proteins containing a leucine-rich NES. CRM1 also exports HIV-1 viral transcripts containing an RRE (Rev response element) via interaction with the HIV-1 Rev adaptor protein. Exp-t and Exp-5 export tRNAs and endogenous micro-RNAs or the adenoviral VA transcripts, respectively, via direct interaction with the RNA substrates. CRM1, Exp-t and Exp-5 are members of the karyopherin-β family of export receptors and interact with their cargoes in a Ran-GTP dependent manner. mRNA export is mediated by the heterodimeric receptor TAP/NXF1-p15/Nxt1 (Mex67p-Mtr2p in yeast), unrelated to exportins. TAP/NXF1 is recruited to mRNP complexes probably via interaction with a variety of adaptor proteins, including Yra1p/Aly/REF. TAP/NXF1 promotes the export of RNAs from simple retroviruses through direct interaction with the CTE (constitutive transport element) present on these viral transcripts. See text for references.

quently cleaved into 18S, 5.8S and 28S RNAs molecules, and around 80 different ribosomal proteins. In addition, more than 100 non-ribosomal proteins take part in the maturation of ribosomal subunits and include a variety of RNases, helicases, ATPases, GTPases, and numerous RNA modifying activities (Fromont-Racine, et al., 2003). The understanding of ribosome biogenesis and export greatly progressed with the development of proteomic techniques, which allowed to analyse the complete set of proteins and processing state of RNA components associated with epitope-tagged proteins assumed to function in specific steps of the maturation process. These studies allowed to deduce the sequential association and dissociation of pre-ribosomal factors and to build a highly dynamic view of 60S and 40S ribosome biogenesis pathways (Tschochner, et al., 2003). Early steps of rRNA processing include the recruitment of U3 snoRNP and assembly of ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins to the 35S precursor rRNA to form a 90S pre-ribosomal particle (Dragon, et al., 2002; Grandi, et al., 2002). Whereas 40S maturation factors are already present in the early 90S ribosomal precursor particle, most of the 60S maturation factors are recruited to 60S pre-subunits after cleavage of the 35S rRNA precursor. These studies confirmed that the pathways leading to the 60S and 40S mature subunits proceed independently from each other and that the different steps in rRNA biogenesis and processing are tightly coupled to intranuclear transport and export to the cytoplasm (Fatica, et al., 2002; Grandi, et al., 2002).

In parallel to these proteomics studies, cellular approaches were used to more directly characterize factors involved in the export of ribosomal subunits. In particular, *in vivo* detection of functional GFP-tagged ribosomal protein reporters, which are incorporated into ribosomal subunits, or *in situ* localization of the pre-40S rRNA ITS1 spacer normally cleaved off in the cytoplasm, were used to screen yeast libraries of temperature sensitive mutants for ribosomal subunit export defects (Gadal, et al., 2001; Grandi, et al., 2002; Hurt, et al., 1999; Milkereit, et al., 2001; Moy, et al., 1999; Stage-Zimmermann, et al., 2000). These studies identified the Ran GTPase system, several nuclear pore complex proteins, as well as the export receptor Crm1p/Xpo1p, as factors essential for the export of both large and small ribosome subunits. CRM1 was also described as the export receptor for small and large rRNA subunits in higher eukaryotes (Thomas, et al., 2003; Trotta, et al., 2003).

Nmd3p was proposed to act as an adaptor for Crm1p on 60S ribosomal subunits. Nmd3p is a shuttling protein containing a leucine-rich NES and mutations in Crm1p result in the accumulation of Nmd3p in the nucleus. The deletion of the leucine-rich NES prevents the export of both Nmd3p and the 60S large subunit. Addition of a heterologous NES restores Nmd3p shuttling as well as large ribosomal subunit export indicating a coupling between Nmd3p and 60S rRNA export (Gadal, et al., 2001; Ho, et al., 1999; Ho, et al., 2000). In addition, human NMD3 directly interacts with CRM1 in a Ran-GTP dependent manner consistent with its proposed role as an adaptor (Thomas, et al., 2003). These observations together with the association of Nmd3p with pre-60S particles just before nuclear exit (Kallstrom, et al., 2003; Nissan, et al., 2002; Trotta, et al., 2003) provide evidence in favour of a direct role of Nmd3p in large ribosomal subunit export. It has not yet been demonstrated however, that Nmd3p can recruit Crm1p onto pre-60S subunits. Such experimental evidence may be difficult to obtain, as such complexes are likely to be transient or destabilized during purification (Thomas, et al., 2003).

Nmd3p is recruited to pre-60S subunits *via* interaction with the ribosomal protein Rpl10p (Gadal, et al., 2001). As Rpl10p is present in all pre-60S particles, it is possible that an Rpl10-binding site for Nmd3p is masked in earlier pre-60S ribosomes but made accessible through the action of later associating factors such as GTPases (Kallstrom, et al., 2003; Nissan, et al., 2002). The recruitment of the export adaptor and nuclear exit may therefore be linked to a structural proof-reading or quality control mechanism ensuring that only fully functional ribosomes get access to the cytoplasm, as discussed by (Johnson, et al., 2002).

The export of pre-40S subunits involves Crm1p, but a direct role of this receptor in small ribosomal subunit export has not been demonstrated. One possibility could be that Crm1p is required to deplete the nucleus of a pre-40S subunit export inhibitor. A better understanding of this export pathway awaits the identification of adaptor proteins mediating the recruitment of Crm1p to pre-40S subunits or the demonstration of a direct RanGTP dependent association of Crm1p with pre-40S ribosomes.

Using the ability of exportins to bind RanGTP in a cargo-dependent manner, a member of this family, exportin-t, was identified as the nuclear export receptor for tRNA in higher eukaryotes (Arts, et al., 1998a; Kutay, et al., 1998) and its yeast homolog Los1p was shown to display a similar function (Hellmuth, et al., 1998; Sarkar, et al., 1998). In contrast to CRM1-dependent export pathways, tRNAs directly bind exportin-t without requirement of any adaptor. Although antibodies against Nup153 or Nup98 do not affect tRNA export *in vivo* (Powers, et al., 1997; Ullman, et al., 1999), *in vitro* binding assays show that exportin-t is able to bind Nup153 and RanBP2 in a RanGTP-dependent manner, and Nup214 in a Ran-independent manner (Kuersten, et al., 2002). This suggests that both cargo-free and cargo/RanGTP-loaded exportin-t are concentrated at the vicinity of the NPC thus facilitating the shuttling of this receptor between nucleus and cytoplasm. Besides its strict role in transport, exportin-t also serves as a quality control checkpoint for tRNAs before their export. In particular pre-tRNA with unprocessed 3′ or 5′ ends, or mutant tRNAs with altered structure or incorrect extremities, are not exported because they poorly interact with exportin-t (Arts, et al., 1998b; Kutay, et al., 1998; Lund, et al., 1998). However, expression of an excess of exportin-t,

as well as the presence of high amounts of pre-tRNAs in the nucleus, allow intron-containing tRNAs to be exported. This means that unspliced tRNAs are normally retained in the nucleus (probably by the La protein), but this retention can be overcome by exportin-t which is unable to discriminate unspliced from spliced tRNAs. Nuclear retention would thus allow splicing to occur prior to tRNA end processing, exportin-t recognition and nuclear export (Arts, et al., 1998b; Lipowsky, et al., 1999; Lund, et al., 1998) and reviewed in (Wolin, et al., 1999). Finally aminoacylation of tRNA, although not essential for nuclear export, has been shown to increase export efficiency therefore contributing to a tRNA proofreading mechanism prior to nuclear exit (Azad, et al., 2001; Grosshans, et al., 2000; Lund, et al., 1998; Sarkar, et al., 1999).

### 2.3. Exportin-5

As mentioned previously, analysis of nuclear export pathways of diverse viral RNAs has greatly contributed to the identification of cellular factors implicated in nuclear transport processes. A recent study on the nuclear export mechanism of adenovirus VA1 RNA also identified Exp-5 as the receptor for these viral transcripts. This 160 nt long RNA is abundantly transcribed by RNA polymerase III and massively accumulates in the cytoplasm of infected cells in the late phase of viral infection. VA1 binds and inhibits the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), a key component of the interferon-induced antiviral defense system which otherwise phosphorylates eIF2α and leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis (O’Malley, et al., 1986; Reichel, et al., 1985). This RNA consists of three functional domains, an apical stem-loop required for PKR binding, a central domain responsible for PKR inhibition and a terminal stem, which brings together the 5′ and 3′ ends of the RNA. Molecular dissection of the determinant responsible for the nuclear export of the VA1 RNA identified a cis-acting RNA export motif within the terminal stem, called minihelix, present not only in VA1 but also in a large family of small viral and cellular RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III. This structural motif consists in a double-stranded stem (>14 nt) with a base-paired 5′ end and a 3-8 nt protruding 3′ end that can tolerate some mismatches and bends (Gwizdek, et al., 2001). RNA export mediated by the minihelix motif is Ran-dependent indicating the involvement of an exportin. Competition experiments led to the conclusion that this exportin was distinct from CRM1 and exportin-t (Gwizdek, et al., 2001; Rutjes, et al., 2001). Exportin-5 (Exp-5), a member of the karyopherin β family related to the S. cerevisiae protein, Msn5p/Kap142p (Yoshida, et al., 2001), was identified as the transport receptor for the minihelix-containing RNAs (Gwizdek, et al., 2003).

In addition to the minihelix-containing RNAs, exportin-5 has initially been reported to mediate the nuclear export of the interleukin enhancer binding factor (ILF3) and the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) (Bohnsack, et al.,

2002; Brownawell, et al., 2002; Calado, et al., 2002). eEF1A is a GTP-binding protein that interacts with aminoacylated tRNA and catalyzes their binding to the ribosome. Complex formation between eEF1A and exportin-5 was shown to be strictly dependent on aminoacylated tRNAs that bridge both proteins (Bohnsack, et al., 2002; Calado, et al., 2002). tRNAs present a highly degenerate minihelix motif able to directly interact with exportin-5, although with a weak affinity compared to an optimal minihelix structure. Consistently, tRNAs can be exported by exportin-5 but do not represent a preferential cargo for this export receptor. Consequently, exportin-5 was proposed to define an alternative tRNA export pathway, which is exploited to keep the translation factor eEF1A out of the cell nucleus (Bohnsack, et al., 2002; Calado, et al., 2002). ILF3 is a nuclear protein that presents two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) as well as an RGG domain. Although its nuclear export depends on exportin-5, ILF3 does not directly bind to exportin-5 but is recruited through its binding to a minihelix RNA moiety that bridges the interaction between ILF3 and exportin-5. Formation of the ILF3/RNA/exportin-5/RanGTP complex is facilitated by the ability of both exportin-5 and ILF3 to mutually increase their apparent affinity for minihelix RNA (Gwizdek, et al., 2004). Exportin-5 thus appears as the first example of a nuclear export receptor that mediates RNA export but also promotes transport of proteinaceous cargo through appropriate and specific RNA adaptors.

Interestingly, recent identification of microRNAs (Ambros, 2003) and analysis of their processing events indicated that maturation of these RNAs is first catalyzed in the nucleus by the RNaseIII endonuclease Drosha, leading to a 60-70 nt pre-miRNA presenting a minihelix structure (Lee, et al., 2003; Lee, et al., 2002), and then by a second cytoplasmic RNaseIII family member called Dicer, that cleaves pre-miRNA into final products of ~20-22 nt (Grishok, et al., 2001; Hutvagner, et al., 2001; Ketting, et al., 2001). Importantly, exportin-5 has been shown to promote efficient export of these minihelix-containing pre-miRNAs, which are likely to be the major endogenous cellular RNA cargoes for this export receptor. Exportin-5 is therefore key to miRNA biogenesis and may help coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic steps (Bohnsack, et al., 2004; Lund, et al., 2003; Yi, et al., 2003).

## 3. mRNA export

mRNA export requires that newly synthesized precursor mRNAs undergo several processing steps, which include 5′ capping, splicing, 3′end cleavage and polyadenylation. The formation of an export competent mRNP complex involves highly dynamic rearrangements of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, which result in the dissociation of nuclear retention factors and the addition of signals necessary for the interaction with the export machinery. A considerable number of factors, including numerous mRNA bind-

ing proteins, nucleoporins and ATPase/RNA helicases have been implicated in the export of mRNA (Table 2). The identification of most of them was based on genetic interactions with transport related factors or nucleoporins in *S. cerevisiae*, or by screening of conditional mutants that accumulate poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus at the restrictive temperature. Evidence accumulated over the last 10 years indicates that no karyopherin family member (importin or exportin) directly functions in a general mRNA export pathway. Instead, studies in yeast and metazoans have revealed several highly conserved proteins known as nuclear export factors (NXF) which are specifically required for mRNA export (Herold, et al., 2000).

### 3.1. mRNA export receptors and adaptors

The best-characterized member of the NXF family is the yeast *S. cerevisiae* protein Mex67p and the metazoan counterpart TAP/NXF1. Mex67p or TAP do not bind the GTPase Ran, but present the main features of mRNA export receptors, as they shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm, interact with FG-nucleoporins and cross-link to poly(A)+ RNA *in vivo* (Zenklu sen, et al., 2001a). Evidence that TAP/NXF1 is a key player in mRNA export in metazoans was first provided by studies of the constitutive transport element (CTE), an RNA element required for the export of unspliced genomic transcripts from simple retroviruses (Ernst, et al., 1997). Importantly, excess of CTE was shown to block mRNA export indicating that the CTE titrates a component of the mRNA export machinery (Pasquinelli, et al., 1997; Saavedra, et al., 1997). TAP/NXF1 was subsequently identified as a protein specifically interacting with the CTE (Gruter, et al., 1998). Other studies showed that over-expression of TAP/NXF1 in Xenopus oocytes or in cell cultures increases the export of transcripts that are otherwise inefficiently exported or retained within the nucleus providing support for a direct role of TAP/NXF1 in mRNA export (Braun, et al., 2001; Herold, et al., 2000; Kang, et al., 1999b). The initial evidence indicating that Mex67p was a nuclear mRNA export factor came from *in situ* hybridization experiments performed with conditional mutants that accumulate poly(A+) RNA in the nucleus at the restrictive temperature (Segref, et al., 1997).

NXF proteins share a similar architectural organization, as reviewed in (Conti, et al., 2001); they contain an N-terminal leucine-rich region (LRR), a central NTF2-like domain presenting structural similarity to the nuclear import receptor NTF2, and a C-terminal domain that displays a UBA (ubiquitin associated) fold (Suyama, et al., 2000). The LRR domain and more N-terminal regions of TAP/NXF1 are required for binding of CTE RNA and recruitment of TAP/NXF1 to cellular mRNAs (Braun, et al., 1999; Kang, et al., 1999a; Liker, et al., 2000; Zolotukhin, et al., 2002). The central NTF2-like domain of Mex67p and TAP/NXF1 heterodimerizes with Mtr2p and p15/Nxt1, respectively, two small proteins of unrelated primary sequence but of analogous function (Katahira, et al., 1999; Santos-Rosa, et al., 1998). Both Mtr2p and p15/Nxt1 are required for optimal binding of Mex67p and TAP/NXF1 to the nuclear pore complex, by facilitating the interaction of a hydrophobic pocket in the NTF2-like domain with FG-repeats (Fribourg, et al., 2001; Levesque, et al., 2001; Strasser, et al., 2000a; Wiegand, et al., 2002). Finally, the UBA domain provides a second site for interaction with FG-nucleoporins (Bachi, et al., 2000; Katahira, et al., 1999; Suyama, et al., 2000). Interestingly the capacity of the NTF2-like and UBA domains to bind nucleoporins appeared to be, at least in part, functionally equivalent as TAP/NXF1 variants containing two NTF2-like or two UBA domains are still able to mediate mRNA nuclear export (Braun, et al., 2002). Knockdown by RNA interference in
Drosophila or C. elegans also confirmed that TAP/NXF1 and p15/Nxt1, like Mex67p and Mtr2p, are essential for poly(A)+ RNA export in higher eukaryotes (Herold, et al., 2001; Tan, et al., 2000). In contrast, Mex67p is not essential in S. pombe, but the NPC-associated Gle2p/Rae1p is required for mRNA export (Yoon, et al., 2000). *S*. cerevisiae Gle2p or the human homologue hGle2/Rae1 are found in a complex with Mex67p or TAP/NXF1, and bind the NPC via a conserved sequence in Nup116p and hNup98 respectively (Bailer, et al., 1998; Pritchard, et al., 1999). hGle2/Rae1 was proposed to deliver TAP/NXF1 to hNup98 (Blevins, et al., 2003). Interestingly, mouse Gle2/Rae1 has also been implicated in cell cycle progression through binding to mitotic checkpoint proteins at kinetochores of prometaphase chromosomes (Wang, et al., 2001).

Although the role of TAP/NXF1 and Mex67p has been elucidated, the precise step and mechanism by which Mex67p-Mtr2p, or TAP/NXF1-p15/Nxt1, are recruited to mature nuclear mRNA is not clear. As both TAP/NXF1 and Mex67p exhibit low affinity for RNA, their interaction with mRNAs is likely to be mediated by adaptor proteins (Katahira, et al., 1999; Santos-Rosa, et al., 1998). The most conspicuous adaptor is the essential hnRNP-like protein Yra1p in yeast or Aly in higher eukaryotes. Yra1p and Aly belong to the evolutionarily conserved REF family of hnRNP-like proteins. REF proteins bind RNA and directly interact with the export receptors Mex67p and TAP/NXF1. Yra1p/REF is required for mRNA export in yeast (Strasser, et al., 2000b; Stutz, et al., 2000), and facilitates the recruitment of Mex67p to the mRNP (Zenklu sen, et al., 2001b). In higher eukaryotes, recombinant Aly/REF promotes export of mRNA in Xenopus oocytes and microinjection of antibodies to Aly blocks mRNA export without affecting other transport pathways (Rodrigues, et al., 2001; Zhou, et al., 2000).

Several shuttling hnRNP-like proteins in yeast, including Npl3p, Nab2p, Hrb1p, or Hrp1p are essential for yeast mRNA export. A recent study showed that the SR-like protein Npl3p directly interacts with Mex67p and acts as an additional adaptor for the export receptor (Gilbert, et al., 2004) and see below (section 3.3). There is no evidence so far that the other mRNA binding proteins have a direct role in Mex67p recruitment. Since the shuttling of these proteins is dependent on RNA synthesis, they may be passive cargoes of the mRNA and contribute to export indirectly, by ensuring proper processing and packaging of the mRNP complex, for review see (Zenklu sen, et al., 2001a).

Once recruited to the fully mature mRNP, the Mex67p-Mtr2p and TAP/NXF1-p15/Nxt1 heterodimers promote the export of the whole complex to the cytoplasm through direct interactions with FG-nucleoporins lining the NPC channel (Conti, et al., 2001). Several yeast NPC or NPC associated proteins with a primary role in mRNA export have been identified, which are conserved in higher eukaryotes (Fabre, et al., 1997; Stoffler, et al., 1999). Among these, the yeast Nup159p and mammalian Nup214 complexes were proposed to act in a terminal step of mRNA export by providing

a binding site for Dbp5p, an ATPase/RNA helicase essential for mRNA export (Hodge, et al., 1999; Schmitt, et al., 1999; Strahm, et al., 1999). Recent data indicate that Dbp5p is a shuttling protein that associates with mRNA early during transcription and remains associated with the mRNP during export (Estruch, et al., 2003; Hodge, et al., 1999; Zhao, et al., 2002). It is proposed that the strong association of Dbp5p with the cytoplasmic face of the NPC at a late stage of translocation contributes to mRNA export directionality by triggering the remodelling and release of mRNP particles into the cytoplasm (Snay-Hodge, et al., 1998; Tseng, et al., 1998) (Figs 1 and 3).

### 3.2. The multiple steps of mRNP biogenesis are functionally coupled

Evidence has been accumulating that the different steps of mRNP formation are linked to each other and often mediated by interactions with the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery, reviewed in (Maniatis, et al., 2002). The RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) mediates the recruitment of factors involved in 5′ capping, splicing and 3′end processing, thereby facilitating the recognition of nascent transcripts by these processing machineries, a topic addressed in several recent reviews (Bentley, 2002; Neuge bauer, 2002; Proudfoot, et al., 2002). Improperly spliced or 3′ end processed transcripts are retained within the nucleus, indicating that mRNP formation and export cannot be viewed independently (Brodsky, et al., 2000). All these functional couplings may be part of quality control mechanisms ensuring that only fully mature transcripts reach the cytoplasm, see (Stutz, et al., 2003) for review.

#### 3.2.1. Evidence for a functional coupling between mRNA splicing and export

In remarkable contrast to yeast, most metazoan genes contain introns. Very often, intron-containing genes generate higher levels of encoded protein than intron-less genes, suggesting that the presence of excisable introns may enhance gene expression. In Xenopus oocyte injection experiments, mRNAs generated through splicing are exported at higher rates than the corresponding synthetic non-intron-containing transcripts, suggesting that pre-mRNA splicing is biochemically coupled to mRNA export (Luo, et al., 1999). In higher eukaryotes, pre-mRNA splicing results in the deposition of the exon-junction complex (EJC), 20-24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junction (Le Hir, et al., 2000). Interestingly, the EJC contains Aly/REF and at least 6 other proteins. It was proposed that the EJC enhances mRNA export by facilitating the recruitment of TAP/NXF1 to the spliced mRNA via binding to Aly/REF (Le Hir, et al., 2001). More recently, UAP56, an ATPase/RNA helicase involved in early steps of spliceosome assembly (Zhang, et al., 2001), was shown to co-purify and directly interact with Aly/REF. Mutations in REF abolishing the interaction with UAP56 impede the association of REF with spliced mRNAs, suggesting that
Fig. 3. mRNA export is coupled to mRNA transcription and processing. In yeast, the THO complex, consisting of Hpr1p, Tho2p, Mft1p and Thp2p, associates with the transcription machinery during elongation and facilitates the recruitment of the mRNA export factors Sub2p and Yra1p to nascent transcripts, which in turn recruit Mex67p. Early mRNP assembly is subject to surveillance by the nuclear exosome. Dephosphorylation of the SR-like protein Npl3p, another adaptor for Mex67p, is required for the release of the mRNA from the 3′ end processing machinery and the recruitment of Mex67p to polyA+ RNA. The NPC associated Sac3p-Thp1p complex may interact with mRNPs at an early stage and contribute to the targeting of Mex67p containing complexes to the nuclear periphery. Mex67p mediates the translocation of the mRNP by interacting with FG-nucleoporins lining the central channel of the NPC. The DEAD-box ATPase/RNA helicase Dbp5p, recruited to the mRNP already in the nucleus (not shown) and stably interacting with the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, may contribute to directional transport by promoting conformational rearrangements during translocation and release of the mRNP particle into the cytoplasm. The mRNA export pathway is evolutionarily conserved. See text for references.

the interaction between the two proteins is required for recruiting the export factor REF to the mRNP (Luo, et al., 2001). UAP56 was proposed to functionally couple splicing to export by facilitating the recruitment of Aly/REF, which would in turn enhance the binding of the export receptor TAP/NXF1, as discussed by (Dreyfuss, et al., 2002).

Surprisingly the knock-down of REF and other EJC components in Drosophila and C. elegans only modestly affects mRNA export, suggesting that they may contribute but are not essential for this process. In contrast, TAP/NXF1 as well as UAP56 are essential for the export of spliced mRNAs and of mRNAs derived from intron-less genes (Gatfield, et al., 2002; Herold, et al., 2003; Longman, et al., 2003; MacMorris, et al., 2003). On one hand, the observations that Aly/REF and the EJC are dispensable for export indicated that essential mRNA export factors can be recruited to mRNA independently of splicing. On the other hand, the inessential nature of Aly/REF suggested that additional adaptor proteins mediate the interaction between NXF1 and cellular mRNAs in metazoa, and that the essential role of UAP56 in mRNA export may not be restricted to the recruitment of Aly/REF (Gatfield, et al., 2001). Accordingly, recent data indicate that multiple adaptors, including members of the SR (serine/arginine rich) family of splicing factors, most likely

cooperate to recruit TAP/NXF1 for efficient mRNA export (Huang, et al., 2003; Huang, et al., 2001).

In yeast, Yra1p/REF directly interacts with the functional homologue of UAP56, called Sub2p, which is also involved in early steps of spliceosome formation and essential for mRNA export (Jensen, et al., 2001; Strasser, et al., 2001). However, only 5% of yeast genes have introns and both Yra1p/REF and Sub2p are required for the export of mRNAs derived from intron-containing and intron-less genes, indicating that splicing is not essential for the efficient engagement of export factors, as discussed in (Linder, et al., 2001). Most recent evidence indicates that recruitment of export factors may occur during transcription.

### 3.2.2. Functional links between transcription and mRNA export

Several observations have pointed to a direct coupling between transcription and export. First, Npl3p, an RNA-binding protein essential for yeast mRNA export and recently identified as an additional adaptor for Mex67p (Gilbert, et al., 2004), is recruited to mRNAs at an early stage of transcription via interaction with the RNA polymerase II complex (Lei, et al., 2001). Furthermore, Yra1p/REF was shown to associate with transcriptionally active and intron-

less genes, indicating a co-transcriptional and splicing independent recruitment of this export factor to the growing mRNP (Lei, et al., 2001).

Recent findings from several labs, established a more direct link between Yralp, Sub2p and the transcription machinery. Indeed, Yralp and Sub2p genetically and physically interact with THO, an evolutionarily conserved tetrameric complex composed of Hprlp, Tho2p, Thp2p and Mftlp, implicated in transcription elongation and mRNA export (Chavez, et al., 2000; Libri, et al., 2002; Strasser, et al., 2002; Zenklusen, et al., 2002). Both Sub2p and Yralp co-purify with THO in a complex called TREX, proposed to couple transcription and export (Strasser, et al., 2002). THO, Sub2p and Yralp are recruited coincidentally to an active gene during transcription elongation. Sub2p may be recruited to the nascent transcript by virtue of a direct interaction with Hprlp, and in turn facilitate the binding of Yralp to the mRNA (Zenklusen, et al., 2002). It was proposed that the binding of Mex67p to Yralp/REF at a later step displaces Sub2p from Yralp prior mRNA export through the NPC (Reed, et al., 2002; Strasser, et al., 2001) (Fig 3).

Increasing evidence suggests that all mRNAs are not exported through a unique linear mRNA export pathway defined by THO, Sub2p, Yralp and Mex67p. Indeed, the co-transcriptionally recruited Npl3p SR-like protein is likely to provide an alternate recruitment site for Mex67p (Gilbert, et al., 2004). Furthermore, synthetic lethal interactions have recently been identified between Yralp and the conserved NPC-associated protein Sac3p, which also interacts with Sub2p (Fischer, et al., 2002; Lei, et al., 2003). Sac3p forms a stable complex with Thplp, a protein reported to function in transcription elongation, like THO (Gallardo, et al., 2001). Both Thplp and Sac3p are required for mRNA export and Sac3p also binds Mex67p. The data suggest that Thplp-Sac3p may functionally overlap with Yralp to couple intranuclear mRNA biogenesis with export (Fischer, et al., 2002). Interestingly, recent data show that Suslp, a functional component of the SAGA histone acetylase complex is important for mRNA export and co-purifies with Thplp-Sac3p. Therefore the Suslp-Thplp-Sac3p complex may function as an alternate adaptor linking the transcription and NPC-associated mRNA export machineries (Rodriguez-Navarro, 2004). Whether Thplp-Sac3p and TREX components bind distinct mRNAs or are sequentially recruited to the same transcript remains to be determined. Consistent with the existence of several adaptors and multiple export pathways, a first analysis at the genomic scale suggests that only a fraction of yeast transcripts are found in association with Yralp (Hieronymus, et al., 2003).

### 3.2.3. Correct 3′ end formation is a general requirement for mRNA export.

Substantial evidence indicates that correct 3′ end formation and polyadenylation is a general requirement for the export of all mRNAs, irrespective of whether they contain an intron. Components of the 3′ processing machinery are recruited co-transcriptionally. The deletion of the yeast RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) results in cleavage and polyadenylation defects and mutations in the 3′ end processing machinery interfere with transcription termination and export, as reviewed by (Proudfoot, et al., 2002). Earlier studies had shown that the addition of an artificial poly(A) tail or 3′end on RNAs lacking the proper signals to engage the cellular 3′end processing machinery is not sufficient to support nuclear export (Eckner, et al., 1991; Huang, et al., 1996). Therefore, the actual process of 3′ end formation is important for mRNA export, not simply the net result of these modifications. Disruption of 3′ cleavage and polyadenylation by cis- or trans-acting mutations results in nuclear accumulation and sometimes instability of transcripts (Brodsky, et al., 2000; Custodio, et al., 1999; Dower, et al., 2002; Hammell, et al., 2002; Libri, et al., 2002; Torchet, et al., 2002). Proper 3′ end formation may be required because some aspect of this process serves to remove factors that actively retain the transcripts. Alternatively, 3′ end processing may generate positive export signals that are recognized by the export machinery. Recent data provide evidence that Npl3p may function in coordinating 3′ end formation with the recruitment of the export receptor Mex67p (Gilbert, et al., 2004). This latter study starts to uncover the molecular mechanisms governing the tight connection between 3′end formation and mRNA export, see below (section 3.3).

#### 3.2.4. mRNP biogenesis is linked to mRNP surveillance

Recent data show that the exosome, a complex of 3′ to 5′ exonucleases, functions in an intranuclear mRNA surveillance mechanism degrading transcripts in response to defects in mRNA processing and export, as reviewed in (Butler, 2002; Mitchell, et al., 2000; Moore, 2002). All exosome components are present in both nucleus and cytoplasm, except Rrp6p, which is specific for the nuclear exosome. The nuclear exosome has been implicated in the degradation of nuclear pre-mRNAs, unadenylated and 3′ unprocessed pre-mRNAs (Bousquet-Antonelli, et al., 2000; Burkard, et al., 2000; Torchet, et al., 2002). More recently, both genetic and physical interactions have been identified between the nuclear exosome and all TREX components. Accordingly, mRNP complexes produced in THO, Sub2p or Yralp mutant backgrounds are susceptible to degradation by the nuclear exosome, presumably because they are improperly assembled and inefficiently recruiting subsequent maturation and export factors (Libri, et al., 2002; Zenklusen, et al., 2002).

Interestingly, defects in early mRNP assembly and mRNA 3′ end processing also result in the sequestration of newly synthesized transcripts within nuclear dots at or close to the site of transcription. The deletion of Rrp6p releases these transcripts from the nuclear foci and restores normal mRNA levels, suggesting that an exosome dependent quality control step retains and eliminates defective mRNPs (Hilleren, et al., 2001; Jensen, et al., 2001; Libri, et al., 2002; Zenklusen, et al., 2002). More recently, studies in Drosophila have shown
that the exosome is recruited to active genes through interactions with transcription elongation factors (Andrulis, et al., 2002). These data suggest that the exosome monitors mRNP assembly at an early step and that at least some destruction of mRNA takes place at sites of active transcription, as discussed by Jensen, et al. (2003) and Fig. 3.

mRNP quality control is not restricted to early steps of mRNA biogenesis. The NPC anchored yeast proteins Mlp1p and Mlp2p, homologous to hTpr, have been implicated in a step of mRNP surveillance prior to nuclear export. Indeed, a recent study shows that Mlp1p retains unspliced pre-mRNAs within the nucleus, preventing non-functional transcripts to reach the cytoplasm (Galy et al, 2004). Growing evidence suggests that Mlp proteins may induce the retention of a variety of unprocessed or malformed mRNP complexes and fulfil a more general role in monitoring mRNP quality at the nuclear periphery (F. Stutz, unpublished data).

### 3.3. Regulation of mRNA export

Diverse mechanisms regulate nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of proteins and RNAs. Earlier studies have indicated that mRNA export may be subject to regulation by the phospholipase C-dependent inositol phosphate signalling pathway (York, et al., 1999). The efficiency of mRNA export is also modulated by arginine methylation of shuttling mRNA binding proteins (Green, et al., 2002; Shen, et al., 1998).

mRNA export appears also to be regulated by phosphorylation. As mentioned above, a recent study identified the SR-like protein Npl3p as an additional adaptor for the export receptor Mex67p (Gilbert, et al., 2004). Npl3p is recruited to nascent mRNPs in its phosphorylated form, but interacts with Mex67p only in its unphosphorylated form. Importantly, the new data also show that Glc7p, a phosphatase essential for mRNA export, coordinates dephosphorylation of Npl3p with the release of the mRNP from the 3′ end processing machinery and the recruitment of Mex67p to the mRNP. Such a mechanism may ensure that only correctly 3′ end processed mRNPs become associated with the export receptor. After translocation, the cytoplasmic kinase Sky1p phosphorylates Npl3p (Gilbert, et al., 2001), presumably promoting the dissociation of Mex67p from the mRNP. These observations show that a cycle of cytoplasmic phosphorylation and nuclear dephosphorylation of Npl3p, and perhaps other shuttling SR proteins, regulates Mex67p-dependent mRNA export, as reviewed in (Izaurralde, 2004).

Modification by ubiquitin has also been implicated in mRNA export regulation. Mutations in Tom1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, block the efficient export of mRNP complexes associated with the mRNA binding protein Nab2p, but not those associated with Npl3p, suggesting differential regulation of mRNA export pathways by Tom1 (Duncan, et al., 2000). Moreover, mutations in another yeast ubiquitin E3 ligase, Rsp5p, have recently been shown to affect mRNA export (Rodriguez, et al., 2003), as well as tRNA and rRNA

processing and export (Neumann, et al., 2003), suggesting a role for this enzyme in coordinating the major nuclear RNA biogenesis pathways. Rsp5p could affect global nuclear RNA export by ubiquitinating a single component of the nuclear pore complex required by all three nuclear export systems. However, a more likely possibility is that Rsp5p has multiple targets, which are part of the individual RNA biogenesis/export machineries. The identification of specific targets for Rsp5p and Tom1p should reveal whether these two enzymes regulate the same or distinct mRNA export pathways and provide essential tools to study the role of ubiquitin in regulating the mRNA export assembly line.

## 4. Perspectives

Over the last 10 to 15 years, major progress has been achieved in the characterization of molecular machines involved in nuclear transport. The nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of many cargoes, including transcription, splicing or DNA replication factors, depends on the regulated accessibility of nuclear transport signals on the cargo to the cognate receptor. However, evidence suggests that transport factors as well as the nuclear pore complex may also be subject to regulation in diverse conditions such as development, cell cycle or differentiation (Callanan, et al., 2000; Feldherr, et al., 1993; Makhnevych, et al., 2003). In addition, recent data on the links between transcription, processing and RNA export illustrate that harmonious cell growth requires tight coordination between biogenesis and transport pathways. Future challenges rely in defining the mechanisms responsible for the regulation and integration of nuclear transport in the context of cell physiology.
