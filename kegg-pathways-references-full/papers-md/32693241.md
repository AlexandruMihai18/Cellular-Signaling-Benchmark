ABSTRACT

The world has witnessed a high morbidity and mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2, and global death toll is still rising. Exaggerated inflammatory responses are thought to be more responsible for infiltrated immune cells accumulation, organ damage especially lung, dyspnea, and respiratory failure rather than direct effect of viral replication. IL-6 and NLRP3 inflammasome are the major immune components in immune responses stimulation upon pathogen infection. It's noteworthy that the function and expression of these components are remarkably influenced by non-coding RNAs including long non-coding RNAs. Given the potential role of these components in organ damage and pathological manifestations of patients infected with COVID-19, their blockage might be a hopeful and promising treatment strategy. Notably, more study on long non-coding RNAs involved in inflammatory responses could elevate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapy. In this review we discuss the potential impact of IL-6 and NLRP3 inflammasome blocker drugs on inflammatory responses, viral clearance, and pathological and clinical manifestations. Collectively, anti-inflammatory strategy might pave the way to diminish clinical and pathological manifestations and thereby discharging patients infected with COVID-19 from hospital.

modulations such as non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation are implicated in inflammatory cytokine storm and inflammatory complex including IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and NLRP3 inflammasome [10,11]. Therefore, designing anti-inflammatory drugs to target inflammatory cytokines especially IL-6 and inflammatory complex including inflammasome could be a promising strategy to deal with SARS-CoV-2 [12,13]. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed down-regulation of the levels of acute-phase reactants including prototypic C-reactive protein (CRP) upon administration of tocilizumab [14]. Also, glyburide is a food and drug administration (FDA) approved drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes able to block NLRP3 inflammasome activation through inhibiting ATP sensitive K⁺ (KATP) channels, caspase-1, IL-1β, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) assembly, thereby halts inflammation responses and organ damage [15–18]. Furthermore, well recognition of non-coding RNAs involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation response could serve as new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 [10]. Collectively, co-administration of anti-IL-6 and inflammasome blocker drugs might improve clinical manifestations of

COVID-19 patients, and reduce morbidity and mortality through limiting COVID-19-mediated inflammation responses. In this review, we describe the mechanism of IL-6 and NLRP3 inflammasome in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and thereby clinical and pathological manifestations of the disease. Also, we review long non-coding RNAs implicated in IL-6 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, we discuss mechanism and pharmacokinetic properties of some reported pharmacological inhibitors targeting these most important inflammatory components.

### 2. Mechanism of IL-6 secretion and inflammatory cascade formation mediated by SARS-CoVs' infection

SARS-CoV-induced inflammatory responses largely cause organ damage especially lung, and thereby high mortality and morbidity [7,19]. Inflammatory cytokines comprising IL-6, and TNF-α and inflammatory complexes including inflammasome were activated following ACE-mediated SARS-CoVs' cell entry [20,21]. Studies carried out on human and animal models infected with SARS-CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-mediated fatal pneumonia might be due to immunopathological events [22–24]. Also, human lung fibroblasts infected with MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E were shown to cause a delayed, strong increase in the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, interferon (IFN)-β, and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10. However, the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IFN-β, and IP-10 were significantly higher in HCoV-229E-infected cells

relative to MERS-CoV-infected cells [25]. Moreover, the lungs' pathological study of patients who died of COVID-19 demonstrated the presence of infiltrated immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes, minimal lymphocytes including CD4⁺ T cells, eosinophils and neutrophils, alveolar exudative inflammation as well as interstitial inflammation (Fig. 2) [9]. Recent studies raised the possibility that inflammatory cytokine storm and inflammatory events may be responsible for the severe COVID-19 pathology [26,27].

#### 2.1. IL-6 secretion mediated by SARS-CoVs' infection

IL-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and viral infections [28]. Also, recently IL-6 have been identified in development of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses, and further affected patient's clinical manifestations [29]. Relatively, recent studies illustrated the remarkable, higher levels of IL-6 in patients with COVID-19 in comparison with those in control group. Also, the levels of IL-6 were strongly correlated with severity of patients' clinical manifestation, serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAemia), and mechanical ventilation requirement [14,30–32]. Moreover, the levels of IL-6 were increased up to 7-fold (*P* = 0.016) following human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treatment with SARS-CoVs' spike protein through activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway [33]. Correspondingly, treatment of murine macrophages cell line (RAW264.7) with

SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial type 2 cells through ACE2 receptor, leading to destruction and permeability of epithelial cells, and thereby virus release. Releasing of virus strongly activates innate and adaptive immune cells including macrophages, granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and also a large number of cytokines including IL-6. Furthermore, following the stimulation of inflammatory factors, a large number of inflammatory cells and erythrocytes enter the alveoli, and cause dyspnea and respiratory failure.

Moreover, IL-6 influences acute phase reactive protein production such as SAA and CRP from hepatocytes.

SARS-CoV spike protein led to NF-κB-induced IL-6 and TNF-α up-regulation [34]. IL-6 exerts its effects on target cells through three different mechanisms comprising binding directly to the membrane-bound glycoprotein 130 (gp130), also known as classical signal transduction; forming a complex with its receptor IL-6R and then binding to gp130; and binding to soluble gp130 in a trans presentation manner [35,36]. IL-6 influences immune processes via activating multiple downstream signaling pathways including janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STATA) (STAT1,3, and 5) [37,38], RAS-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAS-RAF) [37,39], SRC-yes-associated protein(YAP) -neurogenic locus notch homolog (NOTCH) [40], phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT [41,42]. IL-6 has a pivotal role in regulating the immune system and inflammatory pathways through several ways including promoting B lymphocytes proliferation and differentiation to induce antibody production (Fig. 3) [43], cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activating [44], inducing hepatocytes-mediated acute phase reactive proteins secretion [45], and hematopoietic stem cells differentiation [46]. Moreover, IL-6 could induce T helper-17 (Th-17) cells, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, via recruiting the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) [47,48]. It's noteworthy that IL-6 is also known as a major inducer of acute phase reactive protein that lead to acute phase reactive proteins secretion comprising serum amyloid A (SAA) and CRP from hepatocytes [45,49]. Recently, it was shown that IL-6 is a core regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, and vessel permeability in alveolar epithelial cells [50,51].

### 2.2. NLRP3 inflammasome formation upon SARS-CoVs' infection

SARS-CoV-2 induces IL-1 family members including IL-1β and IL-18 through activating an inflammatory protein complex named NLRP3 inflammasome [21,52]. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome occurs via two signaling mechanisms (Fig. 4). The first one also called priming signal is triggered via microbial agents sensing with toll like receptors (TLRs) or cytokines to NF-kB-induced pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 up-regulation. The second one is triggered by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) resulting in ASC and pro-caspase-1 assembly, and thereby activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [53,54]. Its noteworthy that NLRP3 inflammasome is also activated by ATP and K⁺ efflux in a P2X7 receptor and pannexin-1 dependent manner [54]. Inflammasome is a central inflammatory multimeric complex including pro-caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3 protein [55]. Inflammasome is activated via nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) upon sensing a wide stimuli spectrum comprising PAMPs, DAMPs, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [56,57]. Several types of NLRs, innate cytosolic receptors, including NLRP1–7, and NLRP12 could promote inflammasome assembly; nonetheless NLRP3 is more studied than other types [58,59]. Multiple lines of evidence illustrated that NLRP3 interacts with the pyrin domain (PYD) of ASC following sensing stimulus-mediated oligomerization, and then ASC recruits pro-caspase-1 via a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) [60]. Consequently, upon autocatalysis, activated caspase-1 cleaves pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18 into IL-1β and IL-18 respectively, resulting in inflammatory responses [61]. Recent in vitro study have illustrated that SARS-Coronavirus open reading frame-8b interacts with leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3 to activating NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to increasing levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in macrophages and probably lung epithelial cells [52]. Surprisingly, another recent study revealed that SARS-CoV open reading frame-3a protein activates both required signaling mechanisms to inflammasome activation independent of ion channel activity. Therefore, open reading frame-3a either activates NF-κB and thereby IL-1β transcription through inducing ubiquitination of p105 in a TRAF3-dependent manner, or it interacts with TRAF3 to induce K63-linked ubiquitination of ASC and consequently promotes caspase 1 activation and IL-1β maturation [62]. SARS-CoV 3a protein acts as a viroporin to

NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and thereby IL-1β and IL-18 secretion through K⁺ channel activity and mitochondrial ROS induction [63]. SARS-CoV E protein ion channel activity is associated to IL-1β secretion through acting as Ca²⁺ channel, and consequently forms NLRP3 inflammasome compartment [21]. Correspondingly, creation of N15A and V25F mutations in the transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV E protein abrogated the Ca²⁺ flux as well as K⁺, Na⁺, and Cl⁻ transportation [21,64]. Animals infected with SARS-CoV without E protein ion channel activity have shown decreased inflammasome-induced IL-1β highlighting the pivotal role of E protein in inflammasome formation. Consistently, mice infected with SARS-CoV containing E protein ion channel activity displayed swollen alveoli walls and leukocyte infiltration whereas those infected with SARS-CoV lacking E protein ion channel activity presented moderate swollen lung epithelia and leukocyte infiltration [64].

### 3. Role of LncRNAs implicated in IL-6 and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway

LncRNAs are a novel class of non-coding transcripts with longer than 200 nucleotides length, and play a crucial role in a broad spectrum of disorders [65–67]. A growing number of studies have indicated that ncRNAs play a crucial role in inflammatory disease progression [68–70]. LncRNAs have been strongly implicated in regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-6-associated inflammatory signaling [10,71,72].

#### 3.1. LncRNAs involved in IL-6 secretion

There is some evidence about the key role of lncRNAs in both down-and up-regulation of IL-6 [10]. As listed in Table 1, and Fig. 5 lncRNAs may regulate IL-6 expression via several pathways like JAK/STAT, NF-κB, HIF-1α, and MAPK. LncRNA/IL-6/STAT is one of the well-studied pathways involved in multiple malignancies such as gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, etc. [73–75]. Correspondingly, lncRNA down-regulated in liver cancer stem cells (lnc-DILC) suppresses IL-6 transcription and its downstream pathway, JAK2/STAT3, and also reduces spheroid formation by binding directly to IL-6 promoter in lnc-DILC overexpressing cells. Moreover, subcutaneous inoculation of hepatoma cells knocked down for lnc-DILC to mice resulted in a greater xenograft tumor growth, size, and weight, highlighting the fundamental role of lnc-DILC in restraining liver cancer stem cells and hepatocellular carcinoma progression. Also, patients with higher levels of lnc-DILC showed a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence and better survival following surgical resection [76]. Another regulator lncRNA is tumor-suppressive lncRNA on chromosome 8p12 (TSLNC8) that remarkably suppresses proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, and induces apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer through inactivating IL-6/STAT3/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) axis [77]. Contrary to lnc-DILC and TSLNC8, lncRNA regulating IL-6 transcription (LNRRIL6) demonstrated an oncogenic role by promoting IL-6/STAT3 axis and its downstream molecules including cell division cycle 25 A (CDC25A), cyclin D1, survivin, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). Relatively, injection of LNRRIL6 over-expression cells into athymic nude mice induced tumor growth [78]. Strikingly, lncRNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), also known as NEAT2, has indicated a dual role regarding inflammation responses and cytokine secretion especially IL-6 in different signaling pathways. Increased MALAT1 levels induced by acute kidney injury and cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia in mice suggested that it might have an anti-inflammatory role in acute kidney injury. Also, knocking down MALAT1 in HK2 cells led to NF-κB and HIF-1α activation, and consequent increase of many inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-a to promoting inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue damage [79]. Moreover, the inflammatory role of MALAT1 has been revealed upon its overexpression, and thereby

Fig. 4. NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is activated through signal 1 and signal 2. Signal 1 is mediated trough sensing microbial and virus ligands (PAMPs), DAMPS, and cytokines such as TNF-α by TLR and TNFR, respectively. Activation of signal 1 leads to NF-kB pathway activation, and thereby up-regulates pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and NLRP3 protein levels. Signal 2 is primed by extracellular ATP and K⁺ efflux leading to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via the P2X7 receptor. Also, calcium influx activates NLRP3 inflammasome by damaging mitochondria, and consequently releases the mitochondrial ROS. Different endogenous and exogenous agents including amyloid β, asbestos, uric acid crystal, cholesterol, silica crystal cause lysosome damage and cathepsin B release from lysosome into cytosol, promoting NLRP3 activation. Collectively, NLRP3 inflammasome activation leads to caspase 1 activation, and thereby converting pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into mature form. TNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor; TLR: toll-like receptors; DAMPs: damage-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs: pathogen associated molecular patterns; IkB: nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NLRP3: NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3; P2X7: P2X purinoceptor 7; IL: interleukin.

inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) up-regulation in LPS-induced acute lung injury. Correspondingly, histopathological investigation of the lung sections of MALAT1 knocked down rat demonstrated that LPS-induced lung injury was strongly diminished in comparison with the control group [80]. Furthermore, IL-6 up-regulation was shown to be tightly linked to T-cell proliferation blockage, accumulation of infiltration neutrophils in ovarian cancer tissue, and ovarian tumor growth through recruitment by lncRNA HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP). In view of these, NOD/SCID mice were injected by HOTTIP overexpressing SKOV3 cells demonstrated a higher tumor volume in comparison with those injected with normal SKOV3 cells [81]. Surprisingly, IL-6 was shown to be also regulated through NF-κB signaling following HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR)-mediated nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB in LPS-induced macrophages. In the light of this result, the levels of inflammatory response and cytokines induced by LPS potentially decreased upon HO-TAIR knock down in RAW264.7 cells [82]. Another oncogenic lncRNA that might be implicated in inflammatory cytokines regulation including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, and consequently neuropathic pain development in chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats model is lncRNA

nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1). Consistently, neuropathic pain has ameliorated in NEAT1 knocked down rat upon considerable down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α which suggested the crucial role of NEAT1 in regulation of IL-6 expression [83]. Current studies regarding osteoarthritis pathogenesis suggest that lncRNA cardiac autophagy inhibitory factor (CAIF) could restrain osteoarthritis progression through blocking miR-1246, and IL-6. Also, it was shown that the IL-6 and miR-1246 levels were remarkably up-regulated in synovial fluid of osteoarthritis patients whereas CAIF was significantly down-regulated, highlighting the potential role of IL-6 in osteoarthritis as an inflammatory disease [84].

3.2. LncRNAs implicated in NLRP3 inflammasome formation

Inflammasome, a multiprotein complex, is a core inflammatory component involved in innate immunity and inflammation responses upon induction with various stimuli [89]. Accumulating evidence has indicated that lncRNAs are implicated in inflammasome formation followed by severe disorders promotion (Table 2, Fig. 5) [72, 90]. Nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been associated with

### 4.1. IL-6 blocker drugs

Elevated plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines especially IL-6 in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 shed some light on efficacy of therapeutic strategy of IL-6 blockers in ameliorating of severe clinical manifestations induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection [14,29] (Fig. 3, Tables 3, 4). Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody also known as actemra, inhibited the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and thereby significantly decreased serum acute phase reactants such as CRP, and SAA in patients who were injected intravenously with 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg biweekly for 6 weeks [103–105]. Given the indirect inhibitory mechanism of tocilizumab through abrogating IL-6 signaling by binding to its receptor, unbound IL-6 serum levels are increased after initial drug administration but are gradually down-regulated upon immune activation abrogation [105,106]. Notably, after several clinical trial studies intravenous administration of tocilizumab was approved in Japan (2008), Europe (2009), and USA (2010) and further subcutaneous injection was also approved in USA (2013) and in Europe (2014) [107,108]. BML-111, a lipoxin receptor agonist, has an anti-inflammatory effect through several mechanisms. BML-111 potentially decreases TNF-α, inflammatory cells infiltration, NF-κB/DNA binding activity, and P65 nuclear translocation whereas it promotes IκB-α expression and consequently suppresses inflammation in rats with hemorrhagic shock-induced acute lung injury [109]. It also can alleviate inflammatory responses and inflammatory cells infiltration in acute lung injury by blocking MAPK/AP-1 pathways and interfering with IL-6, IL-8, AP-1/DNA interaction [110]. In this view, BML-111 was shown to cause a significant increase in MALAT1 levels which is down-regulated in rats with acute lung injury, and consequently MALAT1 reduces activation of NF-κB, MAPK, and expression of inflammatory factors including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-6 [86,109].

### 4.2. NLRP3 inflammasome blockers

A growing body of evidence highlights the potential role of inflammatory components such as NLRP3 inflammasome in inflammatory responses mediated by SARS-CoV-2's infection. Correspondingly, it's becoming increasingly evident that anti-NLRP3 inflammasome drugs could diminish the inflammatory responses, and consequently alleviate clinical manifestations of patients with inflammatory disorders [111–113] (Fig. 6, Tables 3, 4). Glyburide, also known as glibenclamide, have been long used for type 2 diabetes treatment by blocking ATP sensitive K⁺ (KATP) channels [16,17]. It potentially could inhibit caspase-1 and IL-1β activation following treatment of human trophoblasts with nigericin [15]. It also partially prevents ASC complex from aggregation, but doesn't show any effect on NLRC4 or NLRP1 [18]. Furthermore, glyburide impedes PAMP, DAMP, and crystal-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bone marrow-derived macrophages [114]. MCC950 is another small molecule that inhibits both canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation through interacting with a wide spectrum of components. Moreover, treating of bone marrow-derived macrophages with MCC950 caused inhibition of IL-1β secretion through abrogating of caspase-1 [18] or disrupting ASC oligomerization [18]. It's noteworthy that MCC950 blocks ATP hydrolysis ability of NLRP3, an essential process to activation of inflammasome, by direct binding to Walker B motif located in NLRP3 NACHT domain [115]. Notably, MCC950 couldn't influence NLRC4, AIM2, and NLRP3 or TLR signaling [18]. OLT1177 is a β-sulfonyl nitrile drug which is being investigated under phase II

Fig. 6. Mechanism of action of most potential pharmacological inhibitors for NLPR3 inflammasome blockage. Several chemical agents have been studied with inhibitory effects on different components of NLPR3 inflammasome pathway. OLT1177, BOT-4-one, parthenolide, BAY 11-7082, INF39, and MCC950 could inhibit ATPase activity of NLPR3. MCC950 and 16673-34-0 are able to inhibit NLPR3 oligomerization. Colchicine, glyburide, and MCC950 block NLPR3 inflammasome activation through disruption of ASC oligomerization. Colchicine could also halt lysosome damage and P2X7 receptor activity as well as AZD9056, consequently prevents from NLPR3 inflammasome activation.

clinical trial for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis [116]. In this regard, murine macrophages cell line J774A.1 treated with OLT1177 was shown to cause 50% decrease of IL-1β secretion induced by LPS/ATP stimulation. However, the IL-1β and IL-18 secretion were diminished by 60% and 70%, respectively following human monocyte derived macrophages treatment with OLT1177. Also, it reduced IL-1β secretion via disrupting ASC and caspase-1 recruitment by NLPR3, thereby blocking NLPR3 inflammasome formation. However, OLT1177 doesn't have any effect on NLRC4, AIM2, TNF-α, and ion flux. It's noteworthy that OLT1177 also decreased IL-6 by 44% in mice with LPS-induced systemic inflammation [117]. Taken together, anti-inflammatory agents raise hope for diminishing pathological and clinical manifestations, and consequently morbidity and mortality induced by SARA-CoV-2 through targeting the main components involved in cytokine storm including IL-6 and NLPR3 inflammasome.

5. Discussion

The ongoing high morbidity and mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2's pandemic pose a threat to global public health. SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has generated an urgent requirement to highly efficient with low side effect agents to combat it [131]. Recent studies have shown that exaggerated inflammatory responses and inflammatory cytokine storm might be the main cause of COVID-19 pathogenesis, and thereby fatality [27, 99, 132]. The potential role of IL-6 and NLPR3 inflammasome in immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection have emerged the hypothesis that blocking of these components could be a hopeful strategy to cope with it [14, 20, 21, 133]. However, concerns have been raised about the probable role of epigenetic modulations including DNA methylation, histone modification, and ncRNAs such as micro RNA, lncRNA, and circular RNA (circRNA) in controlling IL-6 and inflammasome expression [10, 134]. Therefore, designing and administration of potential drugs to target the wide spectrum molecules involved in IL-6 and inflammasome-associated epigenetic mechanisms along with IL-6 and inflammasome blockers may improve the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2's treatment [12, 13]. On the other hand, some of these ncRNAs have an anti-inflammatory effect through blocking IL-6 and inflammasome components whereas others promote inflammatory responses [77, 135]. Recently, it was reported that circRNA_100782, as an oncogene, promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma BxPC3 cells proliferation by counteracting inhibitory effects of miR-124 in IL6-JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Correspondingly, circRNA_100782 knocked down BxPC3 cells injected into BALB/c nude mice suppressed cell growth and IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway [136]. Contrary, circulating circ-DLGAP4 has an anti-inflammatory effect through sponging miR-143, and consequently decreases significantly CRP as well as inflammation cytokines including serum TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-22 without affecting ESR, IL-1β, and IL-17 serum levels [137]. Furthermore, down-regulated miR-149 in osteoarthritis chondrocytes, exacerbates osteoarthritis progression via increasing inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β [138]. Notably, GAS5 is widely down-regulated by epigenetic mechanisms resulting in tumor progression in various malignancies [94]. Also, GAS5 down-regulation following DNMT1-mediated methylation of its promoter promotes pyroptosis-related proteins caspase1 and NLPR3 up-regulation, and thereby cardiac fibrosis progression. In this view, inducing cardiac fibrosis in rats led to

Gas5 down-regulation and Nlrp3, caspase1, and Dnmt1 up-regulation [11]. Besides, some anti-inflammatory agents including emodin exert their effect via recruiting ncRNAs. Emodin, suppresses LPS-induced murines' ATDC5 cells apoptosis and inflammation by up-regulating lncRNA taurine-upregulated gene 1(Tug1), and thereby blocks NF-κB signaling and inflammatory cytokines especially Il-6 [139]. Discrepant results from several clinical trials about the efficacy of antiviral drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol in restraining COVID-19 infection and patients' manifestations raise the possibility that the pathological and clinical manifestations of infected patients might be due to virus-induced inflammatory cytokine storm and not only to virus replication [140]. Obtained results from a clinical trial including administration of tocilizumab for 20 patients with acute COVID-19 showed that 19 patients recovered from hospital within two weeks [141]. Tiziana Life Sciences (TZLS-501) is another fully-human anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody able to bind to both the membrane-bound and soluble forms of IL-6R, and thereby reduces circulating IL-6 levels in the blood and lung damage [142]. TJM2, a neutralizing antibody, is a promising agent to treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients through targeting human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and consequently diminishes inflammatory cytokine storm [141]. Furthermore, glyburide might be a useful drug to combat SARS-CoV-2 through blocking the wide spectrum of molecules related to inflammatory cascade including KATP channels, ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 and IL-1β, and it also could inhibit PAMP, DAMP, and crystal-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation [15–18]. Strikingly, lungs' pathological postmortem examination of SARS-CoV-2 patients have shown elevated infiltrating immune cells including macrophages and monocytes, minimal lymphocytes including CD4⁺ T cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils, highlighting the probable role of inflammatory cells in deterioration of patients' clinical manifestations [9]. Correspondingly, elevated IL-6 serum levels in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the IL-6 serum levels is remarkably associated with severity of patients' clinical manifestations, serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAemia), and mechanical ventilation requirement [14,30–32]. Moreover, results from recent studies shed some light on the importance of IL-6 serum levels as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [30,143]. Taken together, it seems that antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory agent's co-administration might be more efficient to reducing SARS-CoV-2 patient's clinical manifestations and inflammatory responses-induced organ damage. Further clinical trials should be performed to evaluate the efficiency and safety of anti-inflammatory agents targeting IL-6 and NLRP-inflammasome and also, identify COVID-19 patients that may benefit from anti-inflammatory therapy.
