ABSTRACT

Innate immunity consists of several kinds of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which participate in the recognition of pathogens and consequently activation of innate immune system against pathogens. Recently, several investigations reported that PRRs may also play key roles in the induction/stimulation of immune system related complications in microbial infections. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), as the main cause of viral hepatitis in human, can induce several clinical forms of hepatitis B and also might be associated with hepatic complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on the important roles of PRRs in the eradication of microbial infections including viral infections and their related complications, it appears that the molecules may be a main part of immune responses against viral infections including HBV and participate in the HBV related complications. Thus, this review article has brought together information regarding the roles of PRRs in immunity against HBV and its complications.

1. Introduction

Hepatitis B is a worldwide life threatening disease which is caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) ([Assar et al., 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2012.05.018); [Ayoobi et al., 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2013.01.018); [Khorramdelazad et al., 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2012.05.018)). Hepatitis B has several clinical presentations which are described in the next sections. Active and inactive chronic HBV infected patients are suffering from attenuated immune responses and, hence, are unable to detect and eradicate HBV completely ([Arababadi et al., 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2009.01.018); [Chan and Jia, 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2011.01.018)). Nowadays, our knowledge regarding the mechanisms which result in attenuation of immune responses in the patients is growing. Accordingly, it appears that both innate and adaptive immunities play critical roles in recognition and suppression of HBV. In the meantime, it seems that innate immunity significantly participates in the HBV antigens detection and suppression of the virus as well as activation of effector adaptive immune cells. The important roles played by innate immunity against HBV were highlighted considering the point that, recent data demonstrated several mechanisms in which HBV escapes from innate

Fig. 1. TLRs signaling and effects of HBV to inhibit the pathways. The figure illustrates that all TLRs use MYD88 dependent pathway, TLR4 uses both MYD88 and TRIF dependent pathways and TLR3 uses TRIF dependent pathway only. HBV related molecules including HBeAg, HBsAg and HBV polymerase inhibit the pathways in several stages.

immunity recognition (Ait-Goughoulte et al., 2010). Therefore, it conveys the idea that the innate immunity parameters are the crucial factors to determine the successful clearance of HBV infection. Innate immunity receptors play significant roles in recognition of HBV and consequently activation of intracellular signaling which leads to activation of innate immunity cells (Liu and Zhang, 2015). Thus, it can be hypothesized that HBV targets expression and functions of the receptors to overcome immune responses, based on the fact that innate immunity plays important roles in the fight against microbes either in the early or late phases of immune response. Immunity can complete immune responses via cross-talk with adaptive immunity. Additionally, innate immunity plays key roles in induction of fibrosis in the inflamed tissues and induction of damages to the tissues. Thus, innate immunity not only inhibits infections in the early phases of infection, but also participates in the clearance of microbe infection and their complications including tissue fibrosis. This review aimed to gather recent information regarding the status of innate immune receptors expression and their roles in the pathogenesis of chronic HBV infected patients in the current review article. This review also addresses the main mechanisms used by HBV to overcome the pathways.

2. Innate immune receptors categories

It has been demonstrated that innate immune cells apply several receptors which are known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), to recognize viral PAMPs (Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns),

including HBV (Leong et al., 2015). Accordingly, they have been categorized into two classes as cell-associated PRRs and soluble recognition molecules. The main cell-associated pattern recognition receptors are toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins, scavenger receptors, N-Formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI) which are also known as Z-form DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), pyrin and HIN domain (PYHIN) protein family, and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) (Bagheri et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2012c; Matsumiya et al., 2014; Zoulim et al., 2013). Moreover, the main soluble recognition molecules are classified as pentraxins, collectins and ficolins (Gedik et al., 2007; Miwata et al., 1993; Unterholzner et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2013). Chronic hepatitis B infected patients are not only unable to recognize and eradicate HBV completely, but also are suffering from the related complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Arababadi et al., 2012; Arababadi et al., 2010; Khorramdelazad et al., 2012). PRRs have become the target of recent investigations. Accordingly, the patterns of the PRRs in the chronic hepatitis B and also their relations with chronic hepatitis B complications will be discussed in the following sections.

3. Innate immunity sensors and chronic hepatitis B

3.1. Toll like receptors and chronic hepatitis B

There are several publications regarding the roles played by TLRs in
R. Nosratabadi et al.

the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B and its related complications (Chen et al., 2008a). Interestingly, most of them reported that expression levels of TLRs were decreased in/on the immune cells of chronic hepatitis B infected patients in the phases of HBV immune escape. For instance, down-regulation of TLR3 (Karimi-Googheri and Arababadi, 2014; Bourquin et al., 2009), TLR4 (Chen et al., 2008a) TLR7, (Lin et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2008) and TLR9 (Shahrakyvahed et al., 2014; Sajadi et al., 2013b) has been reported by investigators. Furthermore, it has been revealed that TLRs signaling pathways also are disrupted in chronic HBV infected patients (Ayoobi et al., 2013; Hirsch et al., 2010).

Several documents are also available which confirmed that TLRs play significant roles against HBV, because HBV is able to manipulate TLRs and their intracellular signaling molecules by its macromolecules including HBsAg, HBeAg, HBxAg and HBV polymerase in the phase of HBV immune escape. For example, it has been documented that HBsAg inhibits TLRs signaling by induction of monocytes to release IL-10 and also suppresses JNK and MAP kinases pathways (Fig. 1) (Shi et al., 2012a; Wu et al., 2009). Additionally, HBV polymerase interferes IRF3 activation (Yu et al., 2010) and HBeAg prevents phosphorylation of NF-kB in immune cells (Bagheri et al., 2014). Accordingly, there are some evidences which demonstrated that patients with chronic HBV infection are unable to phosphorylate IRF3 following HBV infection (An et al., 2008). Furthermore, a study by Lang et al. has shown that HBeAg can suppress TLR function through the inhibition of NF-kB activation (Lang et al., 2011). Additionally, one research indicated the expression of TLR 2 was reduced in hepatocyte and Kupffer cells isolated from HBeAg positive patients (Visvanathan et al., 2007). The inhibitory effect of HBV on TLRs has been indicated by other studies. Shi and Wang showed that HBsAg could inhibit TLR2 function by blocking JNK-MAPK signaling as well as release of IL-10 by monocytes (Lin et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2012b). Another study also showed that HBV polymerase inhibits NF-kB signaling following TLR3 and TLR4 activation in hepatoma cells (Liu et al., 2014). Additionally HBx protein leads to impaired TLR signaling pathway.

TLRs are also expressed by hepatic non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) such as Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the other cell types (Ma et al., 2015). These cells play essential roles in innate and early adaptive immune response against HBV infection in the phase of HBV immune recognition/clearance (Kimura et al., 2002; Knolle and Gerken, 2000). Accordingly, a study showed that TLR3 and TLR4 could activate NPCs to produce IFN-β during HBV infection (Wu et al., 2007). Additionally, an increase in expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II was observed by NPCs through their stimulation with TLR agonists (Wu et al., 2007). Isogawa et al. indicated that administration of TLR agonists in HBV transgenic mice induces antiviral response in the non-parenchymal cells (Isogawa et al., 2005).

Moreover, recent investigations showed that using TLR's ligands leads to improved immune responses against HBV in the phase of HBV immune recognition/clearance. For instance, it has been demonstrated that TLR3 ligands activate myeloid dendritic cell which result in promotion of NK cell function in chronic hepatitis B infected patients (Tjwa et al., 2012). Studies also demonstrated that using TLRs ligands led to production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in chronic hepatitis B infected patients (Guo and Friedman, 2010; Heiberg et al., 2012b; Ma et al., 2007). TLRs agonists also inhibit HBV proliferation, invasion and secretion as well as activation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses (Chen et al., 2012a; Martinet et al., 2012; Schwarz et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2012).

Therefore, due to the aforementioned inquiries it seems that TLRs are not only important extra/intra sensors for recognition of HBV but also play substantial roles in the activation of immune responses against HBV. Thus, scientists believe that TLRs can be considered as novel plans for treatment of chronic hepatitis B (Chang and Guo, 2015).

Importantly, the conclusion cannot be generalized for TLR2, because its roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B and also use of its related agonists as immunotherapy against HBV are controversial

(Bagheri et al., 2014). For instance, the positive roles played by TLR2 against HBV in the phase of HBV immune recognition/clearance have been reported previously (Cooper et al., 2005; Preiss et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012). Decreased expression of TLR2 and its related signaling molecules have also confirmed this role of TLR2 in prolonged forms of hepatitis B (Chen et al., 2008b; Momeni et al., 2014), while there are several studies which demonstrated that TLR2 is not only necessary for suppression of HBV but also participates in deterioration of chronic hepatitis B complications (Guo et al., 2007; Heiberg et al., 2012a; Soares et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2010; Wei et al., 2007; Yunwei et al., 2007). Therefore, it seems that, in contrast with other TLRs, the use of TLR2 ligands as an adjuvant for treatment of chronic hepatitis B is controversial. Currently, several animal and clinical trial studies are being performed to discover the roles of TLR ligands as therapeutic approaches for treatment of hepatitis B.

### 3.2. C-type lectins and chronic hepatitis B

C-type lectins are a type of molecule which contain a domain entitled carbohydrate-binding protein (lectin) and the C-type comes from their requirement for calcium to bind to their ligands (Dambuza and Brown, 2015). The superfamily that contains C-type lectin domains (CTLDs) plays important roles in cell functions including cell–cell adhesion, induction of immune response and apoptosis (Lichtenstein and Rabinovich, 2013). These proteins have been classified to 17 subgroups including lecticans, asialoglycoprotein and dendritic cell receptors, natural killer (NK) cell receptors, selectins, collectins, multi-CTLD endocytic receptors, polycystin, attractin, chondrolectin, tetranectin, DiGeorge syndrome critical region 2 (DGCR2), eosinophil major basic protein (EMBP), thrombomodulin, soluble protein containing sperm-coating glycoprotein domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and CTLD domains (SEEC), bimlec, alx-b and CTLD-containing protein (CBCP/Frem1/QBRICK) (Zelensky and Gready, 2005).

Previous investigations evaluated the status and roles of some of the C-type lectins containing proteins in the both phases of HBV immune recognition/clearance. For example, it has been documented that asialoglycoprotein receptor interacted directly with HBV preS1 domain and is considered as a receptor for either induction of phagocytosis of HBV or entrance of the virus to the hepatocytes (Owada et al., 2006; Treichel et al., 1994; Yang et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2011). Additionally, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important lectin molecule which participates in HBV recognition by DCs (Gui and Diao, 2010). Although HCV uses DC-SIGN as a receptor to introduce to the target cells (Lozach et al., 2003), the role of DC-SIGN as a receptor for HBV is not approved. Interestingly, HBV exploits mannose trimming as a critical mechanism to escape from recognition by DCs (Op den Brouw et al., 2008). Therefore, it seems that DC-SIGN plays an important role in recognition of HBV and induction of immune responses, while asialoglycoproteins mainly participate in the HBV attachment to the hepatocytes to infect the cells.

NK cell is an important cell against viral infections (Shabani et al., 2014). It has been demonstrated that NK cells express several C-type lectin receptors which recognize HBV (Schuch et al., 2014). NK cells express NKG2A, a C-type lectin, as inhibitory receptor which is covalently bound to another C-type lectin molecule entitled CD94 (Carretero et al., 1997). NKG2C and NKG2D are two C-type lectin receptors which are expressed on NK cells and their interaction with appropriate ligands leads to activation of NK cells. Due to the fact that NK cells play crucial roles against HBV (Shabani et al., 2014), the status and functions of the C-type lectin receptors on the NK cells may be considered as a potential factor to eradicate HBV. Accordingly, a study reported that NKG2A positive NK cells were significantly down-regulated in acute hepatitis B infected patients (Bonorino et al., 2009). Zheng et al., revealed that in parallel with decreased activity of NK cells, expression of NKG2D was also decreased in chronic hepatitis B infected patients withR. Nosratabadi et al.

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to healthy controls ([Zeng et al., 2009]). Up-regulation of TGF-β, as an immune inhibitory cytokine in chronic HBV infected patients who were in the phase of HBV immune escape, has been reported by researchers ([Khorramdelazad et al., 2012]). TGF-β down-regulates NKG2D on NK cells in chronic HBV patients ([Sun et al., 2012]). Therefore, it seems that there is a correlation between the increased expression of TGF-β and expression of NKG2D on NK cells as well as impaired NK cell function in persistent HBV infection. Additionally, NKG2A blocking leads to increased activity of NK cells and HBV clearance from the infected liver ([Sun et al., 2012]). Thus it seems that activities of NK cells, as important cells against HBV, are significantly dependent on their C-type lectin receptors.

Selectins are other members of C-type lectins, calcium-dependent type I transmembrane glycoproteins, which participate in the immune cells functions ([Ley, 2003]). E-selectin, P-selectin and L-Selectin are three important members of selectins. The selectins have similar structures containing N-terminal lectin-like domain, EGF-like domain, consensus repeats (CRs), transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail ([Ley, 2003]). L-Selectin is expressed by immune cells, while P and E selectins are expressed by endothelial cells and participate in several functions of the cells, especially migration of immune cells to the peripheral lymphoid tissues as well infected site ([Ley, 2003]). Interestingly, it has been reported that expression levels of L-Selectin are significantly associated with appropriate humoral and T cell responses to hepatitis B surface antigen ([Rosenberg et al., 2013]). Therefore, it appears that selectins may play key roles in induction of immune responses against HBV. Accordingly, a study by Gong and colleagues approved the hypothesis and demonstrated that serum levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble L-Selectin (sL-Selectin) significantly increased in the chronic hepatitis B infected patients and interferon-alpha-2a treatment led to decrease in expression of sE-selectin and sL-Selectin ([Gong et al., 2014]). This indicates that elevated serum levels of the selectins are associated with appropriate functions of T lymphocyte subsets and NK cells as well as liver inflammation in the phase of HBV immune recognition/clearance. Association between selectins polymorphisms and chronic hepatitis B also confirms such a relationship ([Cai et al., 2012]). Moreover, it seems that selectins may significantly participate in the pathogenesis of liver complications by activation of platelet and induction of inflammation ([Panasiuk et al., 2000]).

Collectins are classified as a family of collagenous calcium-dependent C-type lectin molecules ([Holmskov, 2000]). They are monomeric subunits which consist of cysteine-rich domain, collagen-like domain, coiled-coil neck domain and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) ([Holmskov, 2000]). Seven types of collectins have been identified in human including mannose-binding lectin (MBL), surfactant protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), collectin liver 1 (CL-L1), collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1), collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1) and conglutinin ([Hoppe and Reid, 1994]). MBL is an important collectin in the serum and lymph, while SP-A and SP-D are the key collectins in the lung ([Holmskov, 2000]). Previous investigations have evaluated the roles played by MBL in the chronic hepatitis B ([Seyfarth et al., 2006]). MBL can be synthesized in the liver and in other organs in the presence of inflammation ([Seyfarth et al., 2006]). MBL recognizes D-mannose and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine on the pathogens, such as HBV, in a calcium dependent manner, and subsequently activates complement system in lectin pathway and also induces phagocytosis by opsonization ([Bai et al., 2014]; [Brown et al., 2007]). Remarkably, MBL plays a crucial role in inhibition of intrauterine transmission of HBV ([Wu et al., 2013]).

The potential associations of MBL polymorphisms with the pathogenesis as well as recovery from chronic hepatitis B have also been reported in several populations ([Chong et al., 2005]; [Filho et al., 2010]; [Fletcher et al., 2010]; [Koutsounaki et al., 2008]; [Song et al., 2003]; [Thio et al., 2005]). The relation between MBL polymorphisms and chronic hepatitis B complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has also been reported ([Segat et al., 2008]; [Yuen et al., 1999]). Interestingly, immunotherapy with MBL has demonstrated that MBL could be used

a safe treatment to suppress HBV replication ([Valdimarsson et al., 2004]).

Thrombomodulin is another C-type lectin which participates in the coagulation pathway and also in the inflammatory conditions of liver ([Borawski et al., 2002]; [Tacke et al., 2003]; [Zeniya et al., 1995]). THBD gene is the gene responsible for coding thrombomodulin in humans. Thrombomodulin, a 74 kDa molecule, contains 5 distinct domains ([Wen et al., 1987]). It has been documented that thrombomodulin can be used as a marker for endothelial cells injuries which is reported during hepatitis B related liver cirrhosis and HCC ([Borawski et al., 2002]; [Tacke et al., 2003]; [Zeniya et al., 1995]). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that thrombomodulin is a marker of deterioration of liver during chronic hepatitis B.

There are several C-type lectin molecules, such as dectin-1 on DCs, CD280 on the macrophages and FCERII (CD23) on the mast cells and B lymphocytes, whose roles in the development and pathogenesis of hepatitis B have not been investigated. Further studies could improve our knowledge concerning the roles of C-type lectin in the chronic hepatitis B.

### 3.3. Scavenger receptors and chronic hepatitis B

Scavenger receptors (SRs) are a group of cell-associated innate immune receptors which participate in the recognition of many antigens, including host molecules (like collagen and thrombospondin), DAMPs (Damage Associated Molecular Patterns; e.g. oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDLs)) and PAMPs (such as microbial surface proteins, lypopolysacharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and CpG DNA) ([Murshid et al., 2016]). The scavenger receptors are the molecules responsible for participating in pathogenesis of several immune responses such as atherosclerosis and fibrosis ([Zani et al., 2015]). SRs are expressed on a wide range of parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells ([Armengol et al., 2013]). Based on the structural characteristics, scavenger receptors are classified into eight subgroups (classes A–H) ([Armengol et al., 2013]). Class A receptors are the first class of scavenger receptors which are mainly expressed on the macrophage and consist of scavenger receptors type 1 (SR-A1) and 2 (SR-A2) ([Armengol et al., 2013]). The molecules have a collagen-like domain, which is necessary for binding to their ligands (modified, acylated (acLDL) and oxLDL and also microbial surface proteins) ([Areschoug and Gordon, 2009]). CD36 (SCARB3) and scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI) are the main members of class B ([Armengol et al., 2013]). CD68 and Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) are also classified as scavenger receptors which, like other scavenger receptors participate in the phagocytosis of foreign substances and also pathology of immune responses including atherosclerosis and fibrosis ([Zani et al., 2015]). Additionally, it has been reported that scavenger receptors play key roles in induction of phagocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes during viral hepatitis by Kupffer cells ([Sitia et al., 2011]).

Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) is another member of SRs that participates in the phagocytosis of microbes and also induction of inflammation in the infected liver ([Deng et al., 2012]; [Wu et al., 1999]). This molecule is considered as a potential biomarker of hepatitis B related HCC progression ([Deng et al., 2012]).

Surprisingly, it has been reported that SR class A, member 5 (SCARA5), plays significant roles in inhibition of HCC during hepatitis B and is considered as a tumor suppressor ([Geninatti Crich et al., 2012]). It has also been demonstrated that expression of SCARA5 declined in 80% of HCCs ([Huang et al., 2010]). It seems that SCARA5 performs anti-tumor functions by means of interaction with the focal adhesion kinase and consequently modulates its tyrosine phosphorylation which results in downregulation of its downstream signaling pathway ([Geninatti Crich et al., 2012]; [Huang et al., 2010]). Several parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells including hepatocytes, endothelial cell, Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), biliary epithelial cells (BECs) and infiltrating immune cells express SRs ([Armengol et al., 2013]).
R. Nosratabadi et al.

Consequently, it may be hypothesized that SRs play key roles in the pathogenesis of hepatitis and liver complications such as liver cirrhosis and HCC. Accordingly, it has been reported that SRs are responsible receptors for activation of HSCs (Schneiderhan et al., 2001). HSCs are the important contributors of hepatic fibrogenesis (Zhao et al., 2013). It appears that this occurs via the capacity of SR-A, CD36 and LOX-1 to recognize apoptotic hepatocyte and modified lipoproteins (Plüddemann et al., 2007). Additionally, as mentioned previously, other liver cells also express SRs, hence, it seems that during chronic liver inflammation, hepatocytes would be damaged and undergo apoptosis and this leads to infiltration of activated lymphocytes into the hepatic parenchyma, activation of KCs and finally, release of fibrogenic mediators by KCs (Armengol et al., 2013).

Based on the information presented here and considering the roles of SRs in the immune responses against HBV, it seems that, although the receptors participate in the recognition of HBV, nevertheless, they mainly participate in the transforming hepatocytes as well as injuries of the cells to induce hepatitis B related cirrhosis and HCC.

### 3.4. Retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and chronic hepatitis B

RLRs are a category of innate immune receptors which recognize microbial RNAs and lead to activation of several transcription factors including IRF1, 3 and 7 (Yoshino et al., 2015). RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology-2 (LGP2) belong to the RLRs family (Eisenächer and Krug, 2012). MDA5 and RIG-I are also the main members of DExD/H box family which contain RNA helicase domains in the central portion of the molecules. MDA5 and RIG-I also have two domains at N-terminal section entitled G-terminal regulatory domain (CTD) and caspase recruitment and activation domains (CARDs) (Kato et al., 2011). Although MDA5 and RIG-I have the same structure and use a common signaling adapter, IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), their targets are different and recognize various ranges of viruses (Kato et al., 2006). Therefore, it seems that their roles in recognition of HBV and induction of immune responses against the virus might be different. Accordingly, previous studies confirmed the hypothesis. For instance, it has been documented that replication of hepatitis B virus in Huh7 cell lines and livers of mice resulted in increased expression of MDA5, but not RIG-I (Lu and Liao, 2013). Co-transfection of Huh7 cells with the plasmid contains MDA5 and RIG-I genes also revealed that, although RIG-I was unable to suppress HBV replication, MDA5 leads to inhibition of HBV replication (Lu and Liao, 2013). Moreover, knocking down of MDA5, but not RIG-I, has resulted in inhibition of HBV replication (Lu and Liao, 2013). A study by Mozer-Lisewska et al. on the patients suffering from chronic HBV infection in the HBV immune escape phase also revealed that expression of RIG-1 was not altered in the HBV infected hepatocytes but expression of MDA5 decreased (Mozer-Lisewska et al., 2011b). Interestingly, mRNA levels of MDA5, but not RIG-I, decreased in peripheral blood immune cells (PBIC) of chronic HBV infected patients in the HBV immune escape phase (Ebrahim et al., 2015). Based on the in vitro and in vivo investigations it may be hypothesized that MDA5 plays key roles in recognition of HBV and RIG-I might be unable to recognize HBV RNAs. Accordingly, it has been reported that HBV suppress function of IPS-1 via HBx protein and inhibits activation of IRF1, 3 and 7 (Kumar et al., 2011). It appears that more studies on the roles played by MDA5 in the modulation of immune responses versus HBV and also pathogenesis of the virus might lead researchers to design new methods for immunotherapy of hepatitis B and its complications.

### 3.5. DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI) and chronic hepatitis B

As mentioned previously, DAI is also known as DLM1 and ZBP1. This is another cytosolic DNA sensor, which in human is encoded by ZBP1 gene (Wang et al., 2008).

Recent studies have shown that DAI can initiate interferon response in innate immunity (Takaoka et al., 2007). DAI senses DNA in the cytosol when the cells are infected with intracellular pathogens. This protein contains four domains, two Z-DNA binding domains in the N-terminal region, called Zα and Zβ. The carboxyl terminal of DAI encompasses a domain interacting with TBK1/IRF3 (also known as TID) and a D3 domain which is able to bind B-form DNA (Takaoka et al., 2007). Furthermore, C-terminal domain of DAI is necessary for its cytoplasmic localization (Takaoka and Taniguchi, 2008). DAI such as stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an IFN-inducible protein and upon sensing of dsDNA by N-terminal region, the C-terminus binds to TBK1 (Tank binding kinase 1) and to IRF3 which subsequently leads to activation of IFN induction (Wang et al., 2008). STING is a transmembrane protein and is also known as TMEM173 and ERIS/MPYS/MITA (Ishikawa and Barber, 2009). Human STING protein contains an amino-terminal domain and includes four transmembrane domains (TMs) and a c-terminal domain which encompasses dimerization domain (DD) and c-terminal tail (CTT) (Ouyang et al., 2012; Shang et al., 2012). STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum of many cell types and binds to its ligand in dimer form (Sun et al., 2009).

Several studies have shown that STING is able to sense cytosolic nucleic acids, especially double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and cyclic dinucleotides (CDS) (Ishikawa et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2011). Upon sensing dsDNA and CDS from intracellular pathogens, STING relocates to perinuclear vesicles and interacts with TBK1. After TBK1 activation, it phosphorylates IRF3 which leads to translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus. In the nucleus IRF3 stimulates transcription of interferon β and other genes (Jin et al., 2008).

Therefore, it seems that this molecule can elucidate suitable anti-HBV responses. Accordingly, a study by Wieland et al. indicated DAI induces IFN responses in hepatitis B infected cells in in vitro condition (Wieland et al., 2003). Another in vitro study by Liu et al. revealed that HBV suppressed STING signaling pathway and IFN-β production (Liu et al., 2015) They showed that a protein of HBV called polymerase (pol) was responsible for inhibition of STING activation and IFN-β production.

Guo et al., using 5, 6-dimethylxanthone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), an agonist of STING, showed that type I interferons were the cytokine response of DMXAA against HBV infection in mouse hepatocytes (Guo et al., 2015). Chen et al., in a study on Huh7 cells demonstrated that DAI was capable of inhibiting HBV infection via activation of NF-κB but not IRF3 signaling (Chen et al., 2012b). Our previous investigations on the CHB patients in the phase of HBV immune escape demonstrated that mRNA levels of STING and NF-κB, but not IRF3, significantly decreased in the PBIC of CHB patients (Karimi-Googheri et al., 2015; Sajadi et al., 2013a). Collectively, based on the fact that IRF3 and NF-κB are the responsible transcription factors for transcription from type 1 interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively, it may be hypothesized that DAI molecules prefer to activate NF-κB and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines rather than type 1 interferons to fight against HBV by immune cells. It is worthy to note that, as mentioned in Weiland et al.'s investigation, non-immune cells such as hepatocytes also produce type 1 interferons in response to HBV infection in DAI dependent manner. Thus, it seems that the type 1 interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines induction are the most important roles of DAI in exposure with viral DNA in immune and non-immune cells, respectively. This suggests further investigations are warranted to understand the mechanisms of DAI molecules against HBV.

### 3.6. Pyrin and HIN domain protein family (PYHIN) and chronic hepatitis B

Pyrin and HIN domain protein family (PYHIN) are intracellular immune sensors for recognition of foreign DNA (Connolly and Bowie, 2014). The human proteins are encoded on interferon-inducible gene clusters which are located on chromosome 1q23. This region encodes

R. Nosratabadi et al.

Molecular Immunology 90 (2017) 64–73

four proteins: absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) and interferon-inducible protein X (IFIX), also known as PYHIN1 (Khare et al., 2014; Veeranki et al., 2011).

AIM2 is a part of inflammasome and plays a role in defense against viral and bacterial DNA (Rathinam et al., 2010). AIM2 contains an N-terminal region (pyrin domain) that binds ASC via PYD-PYD interactions and a C-terminal region (hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear proteins (HIN)-200 domain) which can bind dsDNA (Jin et al., 2013). This protein engages the adaptor protein ASC to form an inflammasome in response to cytosolic DNA. AIM2 inflammasome activates caspase1 and then leads to converting pro-IL1β and pro-IL-18 to active form. These inflammatory cytokines resulted in rapid lytic cell death called “pyroptosis” (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009).

The role of AIM2 in immunity to DNA viruses has been shown by Rathinam (Rathinam et al., 2010). Accordingly, a study by Han showed that the increased inflammation in chronic hepatitis B patients in the HBV immune tolerant phase was associated with high level of AIM2 expression (Guo et al., 2015). Another study also indicated that AIM2 increased inflammation in renal glomeruli of HBV infected patients in the HBV immune tolerant phase (Zhen et al., 2014). According to the studies, it seems that AIM2 plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of liver complications by activation of caspase1 and induction of inflammation. Our previous investigation also demonstrated that although the expression of ASC and caspase-1 was decreased in CHB patients in the HBV immune escape phase, mRNA levels of AIM2 were not altered in comparison to healthy controls (Hassanshahi et al., 2014). Therefore, it seems that effects of HBV on the expression of AIM2 in immune and non-immune cells are different and more investigations can improve our knowledge regarding the roles of the molecules against HBV.

IFI16 (interferon inducible protein 16, also known as PYHIN2; IFNGIP1) is another member of PYHIN protein family, which participates in intracellular DNA sensing with mediating interferon-β (IFNβ)-induction (Unterholzner et al., 2010). Upon sensing dsDNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm, IFI16 stimulates the IRF-3 pathway through the STING and finally induces the IFNs expression (Duan et al., 2011; Orzalli and Knipe, 2014). Therefore, IFI16 has the ability to recognize viruses which are replicated in the nucleus. IFI16 such as AIM2 has a similar structure, containing N-terminal PYD domain and two HIN domains (HIN A and HIN B) in C-terminal.

Although there are several investigations about the roles played by IFI16 against viruses (Singh et al., 2013), studies on the roles of the molecule in response to HBV are limited. Yan et al., through a research on woodchuck model (an animal model used studying HBV infection) showed that IFI16 and AIM2 have a crucial role in the induction of IFN and IL-1β responses, respectively (Yan et al., 2016). Additionally, Wieland et al., by genome analysis of host in response to HBV, identified that IFI16 gene was associated with viral clearance during HBV infection (Wieland et al., 2004). This evidence indicates the important roles of IFI16 in responses to HBV.

Human locus encodes two other members of PYHIN protein family, MNDA and IFIX, of which the latter is a novel member of the PYHIN protein family. MNDA and IFIX contain two domains, a pyrin domain in the N-terminal and a HIN-A domain in the C-terminal region (Diner et al., 2015). These proteins have a nuclear localization domain (Ludlow et al., 2005). MNDA and IFIX such as the other PYHIN members can be induced by interferon. MNDA also can interact with ASC and is capable of acting as a strong activator of ASC inflammasome, whereas IFIX is a potent activator of STING-dependent IFN signaling pathway (Brunette et al., 2012). Further studies revealed that MNDA binds and modulates the function of proteins that are involved in gene transcription. MNDA binds YY1 (Ying Yang 1, a transcription factor) and leads to YY1 interacting with its target DNA (Xie et al., 1998). The role of MNDA in autoimmune disorders has also been shown. A study by Peterson revealed the level of MNDA mRNA was increased in glomeruli from SLE patients (Peterson et al., 2004). IFIX also has potential roles in inhibition of tumor growth. The study by Ding showed the expression of IFIX is reduced in breast cancer and breast tumor cell lines (Ding et al., 2006). These data suggest MNDA and IFIX may also be involved in innate immune responses. However, their roles in HBV infection have not been examined.

### 3.7. Nod-like receptors and chronic hepatitis B

A novel class of PRRs is NLRs [nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors], which were discovered a decade ago. NLRs recognize several PAMP and DAMP molecules. There are 22 known NLRs, and their relation to human diseases indicates their essential roles in the immune system (Ting et al., 2008). NLR family has a common domain with a central NOD (NACHT), N-terminal (effector domain) and C-terminal (leucine-rich repeats domain) region. The NACHT domain has DNTPase activity and oligomerization, while the C-terminal is involved in ligand sensing (Koonin and Aravind, 2000).

Based on N-terminal region, NLRs were divided into four sub-families including NLRA (contain acidic transactivation domain), NLRB (contain the baculoviral inhibitory repeat-like domain), NLRC (contain the caspase activation and recruitment domain) and NLRP (contain the pyrin domain) (Kanneganti et al., 2007). Some NLRs have various functions such as inflammasome formation. The inflammasomes are formed by some NLR members such as NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP12, NLRC4 and NAIP (Davis et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2015).

Like AIM2, when NLRs recognize PAMPs or DAMPs, they recruit ASC via interaction between Pyrin domains. Then procaspase-1 binds to ASC via CARD-CARD domain which leads to inflammasome production (Shaw et al., 2010).

The other NLRs like NOD1, NOD2, NLRP10, NLRX1, NLRC5 and CIIA are involved in signal transduction and transcription activation. These NLRs activate NF-kB, IRFs and MAPKs to stimulate innate immune system (Motta et al., 2015).

Expression of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) has been evaluated in liver biopsies of patients with chronic HBV infection in the HBV immune tolerant phase. NOD1 and NLRP1 were shown to be highly expressed in infected hepatocytes of these patients (Mozer-Lisewska et al., 2011a).

Some studies have shown that NOD2 and NLRX1 are complicated in host antiviral responses (Sabbah et al., 2009; Tattoli et al., 2008). Zhao et al. indicated mutation in NLRX1 leads to susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B infection (Zhao et al., 2012). We have also reported an increased expression of NLRP3, but not NLRP1 and NLRC4, in the PBICs of CHB patients in the HBV immune recognition/clearance phase (Askari et al., 2016). It seems that the roles of NLRs in hepatitis B infection need to be studied to shed light on understanding their main mechanisms against HBV.

### 4. Concluding remarks

The information presented in this review article suggests that PRRs play crucial roles in the control and suppression of HBV infection. Although the roles of TLR2 in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B are controversial, it seems that the agonists of other PRRs including TLRs can be considered for immunotherapy of CHB. Accordingly, HBV uses some mechanisms to overcome innate immunity via targeting PRRs such as TLRs, NKG2D, etc. in a direct and indirect manner (Fig. 2).

Some PRRs not only participate in the induction of immunity against HBV but also may play roles in deterioration of the disease in several mechanisms, including helping HBV to enter into hepatocytes (such as asialoglycoprotein and may be DC-SIGN) and exploitation of mannose trimming to overcome DC responses. Additionally, PRRs might be considered as the important molecules involved in the induction of liver inflammation, cirrhosis and HCC in the CHB patients. Thus, they can be considered as a marker of deterioration of liver

Fig. 2. HBV and innate immunity sensors. The figure illustrates that HBV suppresses expression of TLRs and its signaling molecules. It also suppresses production of type 1 interferons (IFNs) via suppression of STING and MDA5 pathways. HBV decreases NK responses via down-regulation of NKG2D, an activator receptor, on the cell membrane. The virus can use C-type lectins, as co-receptors, to enter hepatocytes and induce hepatitis B complications, liver cirrhosis and HCC, in a direct and indirect manner.

function.

It looks as if the effects of HBV in the expressions and functions of PRRs in immune and non-immune cells are different.

Briefly, it seems that PRRs are important immune components whose roles in the suppression of HBV as well as their pathogenicity need to be evaluated by further studies to resolve the immunity-HBV interaction puzzle.
