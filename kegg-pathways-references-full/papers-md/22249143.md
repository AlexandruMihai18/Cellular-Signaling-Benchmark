ABSTRACT

Although frequently expressed in EBV-positive malignancies, the contribution of the oncogenic latent membrane proteins, LMP1 and LMP2, to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is not fully defined. As a key effector in EBV-driven B cell transformation and an established “transforming” gene, LMP1 displays oncogenic properties in rodent fibroblasts and induces profound morphological and phenotypic effects in epithelial cells. LMP1 functions as a viral mimic of the TNFR family member, CD40, engaging a number of signalling pathways that induce morphological and phenotypic alterations in epithelial cells. Although LMP2A plays an essential role in maintaining viral latency in EBV infected B cells, its role in epithelial cells is less clear. Unlike LMP1, LMP2A does not display “classical” transforming functions in rodent fibroblasts but its ability to engage a number of potentially oncogenic cell signalling pathways suggests that LMP2A can also participate in EBV-induced epithelial cell growth transformation. Here we review the effects of LMP1 and LMP2 on various aspects of epithelial cell behaviour highlighting key aspects that may contribute to the pathogenesis of NPC.

1. Introduction

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gammaherpesvirus found as a widespread and largely asymptomatic infection throughout the world. The virus exploits the physiology of normal B cell differentiation to persist within the memory B cell pool of the immunocompetent host as a life-long latent infection. EBV replication occurs in both B cells and in mucosal epithelium lining the nasopharynx. It is the aberrant establishment of latent EBV infection at these sites that results in the development of both lymphoid and epithelial tumours [1]. The oncogenic potential of EBV was demonstrated through its association with multiple human malignancies including Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL), NPC, Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), some NK/T-cell lymphomas, and a proportion of gastric carcinomas [1]. Different forms of EBV latent gene expression are observed in these tumours. In NPC EBV latent gene expression is restricted to EBNA1, the LMP2A/B proteins, the EBER and BamHIA transcripts with variable expression of the LMP1 protein [2]. The presence of monoclonal EBV episomes in NPC indicates that virus infection preceded the clonal expansion of the malignant cell population [2]. Limited analysis of premalignant lesions in the nasopharynx also found monoclonal EBV episomes along with

LMP1 expression suggesting a role for this viral oncogene in the early stages of NPC pathogenesis [3].

2. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)

LMP1 is one of five key EBV-encoded viral proteins required for B cell immortalisation [1]. While early experiments performed in rodent fibroblasts identified LMP1 as a viral “transforming” gene, the advent of recombinant EBV technology established the requirement for LMP1 in EBV-mediated B cell immortalisation [1]. While expression of LMP1 in human epithelial cells is not normally associated with growth transformation, LMP1 does exert a variety of growth-promoting effects in this cell type [4]. Whereas targeted expression to the epidermis of transgenic mice is associated with epidermal hyperplasia [5], expression in non-transformed epithelial cell lines induces a cellular phenotype similar to “wounded” or psoriatic keratinocytes [6]. When expressed in tumourigenic epithelial cells, LMP1 potentiates anchorage-independent growth and greatly enhances cell motility and invasion [4,7–9]. Taken as a whole, these findings demonstrate that LMP1 can induce profound effects in epithelial cells, many of which may account for its oncogenic properties.

2.1. LMP1 structure and function

Recent reviews have described in detail the structural and functional aspects of LMP1 signalling in epithelial cells [4,7–9].
Although showing no appreciable homology to known cellular proteins, LMP1 displays functional similarities to the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members: TNFR1 and CD40. These functional similarities are attributed to the recruitment of a number of TNFR-associated signalling proteins, which include TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) and the TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD), amongst others [7–9]. However, unlike TNFR1 and CD40, LMP1 signals in a constitutive, ligand independent manner.

LMP1 is a 66 kDa integral membrane protein comprising a short amino acid cytoplasmic N-terminus (amino acids 1–23), six hydrophobic alpha-helical transmembrane spanning regions (amino acids 24–186) and a large 200 amino acid cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (amino acids 187–386) (Fig. 1). While the cytosolic amino-terminus of LMP1 plays a role in the orientation and processing of LMP1, the hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) domains self-aggregate and participate in intermolecular oligomerisation. The TM domains recruit the RhoGTPase Cdc42, which induces cytoskeletal remodelling and engage signalling pathways that impact on cell proliferation and autophagy [10]. The large cytosolic C-terminus of LMP1 possesses most of the signalling capacity of the protein, containing three functional domains termed C-terminal activating regions 1–3 (CTAR1, CTAR2 and CTAR3). These domains provide docking sites for signalling adaptor proteins, which include the TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs), TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD), Receptor interacting protein kinase (RIP), BS69 and Janus kinase (JAK)-3 proteins, that transduce signals through the NF-κB, JNK/p38-SAPK, PI3-K/Akt, ERK-MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways [4,7–9]. The proximal signalling domain of LMP1, CTAR1, contains a PxQxT motif (amino acids 204–208), which binds a number of TRAF molecules, whereas the distal signalling domain, CTAR2, contains an YYD motif (amino acids 351–386) required for TRADD, RIP and BS69 binding. A poly-proline rich region located between CTAR1 and CTAR2, designated CTAR3 (amino acids 275–330) allegedly recruits JAK3 resulting in STAT3 activation [4,7–9].

### 2.2. Signalling pathways engaged by LMP1 in epithelial cells

The generation of LMP1 mutants has uncovered the relative contribution of individual LMP1 domains to cell signalling and their associated effects on epithelial cell growth. While the CTAR1 domain engages signalling pathways that cooperate to induce the morphological transformation of both Rat-1 fibroblasts and MDCK epithelial cells [11–14], the CTAR2 domain activates signalling pathways which regulate cytokine secretion and interferon responses [15,16].

Signalling from CTAR1 is mediated primarily through the binding of TRAF proteins. TRAF1/2/3/5 and possibly TRAF6, bind CTAR1 directly, resulting in activation of the non-canonical NF-κB2 pathway through a TRAF-NIK-IKKα pathway [17,18]. In epithelial cells, CTAR1 also engages the canonical NF-κB1 pathway to generate novel NF-κB complexes that influence the expression of epithelial specific genes [19,20]. In contrast to CTAR1, CTAR2-mediated activation of NF-κB occurs via indirect recruitment of TRAF2/6 to TRADD or BS69, and activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway through a TAB1-TAK1-IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ-mediated pathway [21,22]. While CTAR1 and CTAR2 both contribute to p38-SAPK activation, JNK/AP1 activation maps to CTAR2 [23,24]. Although a role for TRADD/TRAF2 in JNK activation has been described [25,26], recent studies show that JNK/AP1 activation requires BS69, a multi-domain adapter protein that binds TRAF6 and couples TAB1/TAK1 through JNKK to JNK/AP1 [27].

While NF-κB and p38-SAPK activation are mediated by both CTAR1 and CTAR2 domains, PI3-K and ERK-MAPK activation are mediated from CTAR1 alone [28,12,29,13]. The induction of EGFR also maps to CTAR1 and involves STAT3 induction of Bcl-3 and novel p50-Bcl-3 NF-κB complexes [30]. A recent study has identified protein kinase C-delta (PKCδ) as a key effector in CTAR1-mediated STAT3, ERK-MAPK activation and EGFR induction [31]. In addition to PKCδ, LMP1 also induces PKCa/β activity through a phospholipase-C (PLC)-dependent pathway in epithelial cells, possibly via CTAR1 [32]. The CTAR2 domain is responsible for inducing expression and activity of IRF7 [33] through a mechanism involving RIP and TRAF6 [34]. IRF7 activation may serve to auto regulate LMP1 expression in epithelial cells through the binding of IRF7 to an ISRE element within the LMP1 promoter [35]; IRF7 activity is subject to modulation by TNFAIP3/A20 [36]. Recent studies have identified a number of cellular proteins that function to limit LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation. Bone morphogenetic protein receptor IA-binding protein (BRAM1) and BS69 negatively regulate NF-κB1 activity by competing with TRADD and RIP for binding to CTAR2 [37,38], while BS69 inhibits CTAR1-mediated NF-κB2 activation through binding to TRAF3 [39]. CTAR1 and CTAR2 also recruit STAP2, which also functions to negatively regulate NF-κB by binding to TRAF1 and TRAF3 [40]. The signalling pathways engaged by LMP1 are summarised in Fig. 1.

#### 2.3. The role of LMP1 in epithelial cell transformation

While EBV plays an integral part in the aetiology of NPC, EBV infection alone is not sufficient to initiate NPC tumourigenesis. As with other squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC), NPC tumours overexpress oncogenes and harbour defective tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) [41,42]. The ability of LMP1 to modulate the expression or activity of a various oncogenes and TSGs suggests that LMP1 may circumvent the requirement for gene dysregulation during NPC pathogenesis.

##### 2.3.1. LMP1 modulates the expression of key tumour suppressor genes

Unlike other HNSCCs, the majority of NPC tumours contain intact p53 genes [43]. While this may be linked to expression of the p53 antagonist ΔNp63 [44], studies show that LMP1 can modulate p53 activity through additional mechanisms. The induction of TNFAIP3/A20 serves to blocks p53-mediated apoptosis [45], while MAPK/SAPK activation modulate p53 activity through phosphorylation [46]. LMP1 also stimulates expression of Mdm2, which promotes p53 turnover [47], and can repress p53 transcription through an as yet unidentified mechanism [6]. LMP1 can also synergise with Bcl-2 to override the growth suppression induced by wild-type p53 [48].

LMP1 has been shown to down regulate RASSF1A, a TSG commonly inactivated in NPC tumours [42], through mechanisms involving NF-κB [49]. This loss of expression is accompanied by aberrant mitotic spindle formation and disorganised interphase microtubules, all of which may promote cell transformation through the promotion of chromosome breaks [49]. As the loss of RASSF1A expression in NPC tumours occurs through promoter methylation [42]. LMP1 may play a role in down-regulating RASSF1A during the early stages of NPC pathogenesis.

##### 2.3.2. LMP1 modulates the G1-S cell-cycle checkpoint

NPC tumours frequently exhibit a loss in expression, either by deletion or methylation, of the INK4a locus, which encodes p16INK4a and p14Arf [50]. LMP1 has been shown to down regulate p16INK4a expression and block replicative senescence in rodent fibroblasts [51,52]. In epithelial cells, LMP1 down regulate p16INK4a and p21, and induces Cdk2 and cyclin D1 [53,54]. LMP1 also promotes CRM1-dependent nuclear export of Ets2 and E2F4/5, key downstream effectors of the p16INK4a pathway [55]. A level of cooperation exists between LMP1 and p16INK4a during epithelial carcinogenesis, as

**Fig. 1. Activation of cell signalling pathways by LMP1.** The carboxyl terminus of LMP1 contains three signalling domains, termed CTAR1, CTAR2 and CTAR3, which recruit TNFR-associated signalling adapter proteins (TRAF, TRADD, RIP), BS69 and Janus kinase (JAK)-3 proteins. These activate the NF-κB, JNK/SAPK, PI3-K/Akt, ERK-MAPK, PLC/PKC and JAK/STAT signalling pathways, which collectively induce the expression of numerous downstream effectors that impact on a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, motility and invasion.

crossing of LMP1-positive mice with p16<sup>INK4a</sup> null mice accelerates tumour formation [50]. An additional mechanism by which LMP1 can bypass the p16<sup>INK4a</sup> pathway involves the induction of the inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins, which function to inhibit p16<sup>INK4a</sup> function, blocking p27<sup>Kip1</sup> induction and maintaining CDK2 expression [56]. Whereas Id1 and Id3 induction in Rat1 fibroblasts contributes to cell transformation [56,57], LMP1 induction of Id1 in human epithelial cells promotes cell survival [58]. While an early study identified a role for NF-κB in Id1 induction [58], a recent report shows that Id1 induction relies on phosphorylation and inactivation of Foxo3a, an effect that promotes cell growth and imparts resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ [59].

### 2.3.3. LMP1 induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines

In addition to IL-1α/β, NPC tumours overexpress a number of cytokines and chemokines [60–62]. LMP1 stimulates the expression of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines that can influence epithelial cell behaviour [62,63]. IL-1α/β, IL-6/8, Rantes/CCL20, CXCL-1/2/3, GM-CSF, TNFα and TGFα, are of particular interest, given that they are over expressed in inflamed, hyperproliferative epithelium. Not only do these factors participate in leukocyte recruitment, but they also modulate epithelial cell migration and proliferation. Transcriptional profiling has revealed a striking level of overlap between LMP1-expressing epithelial cells and epithelial cells stimulated with IL-1α and TNFα [6,64], findings that indicate

### 2.3.4. LMP1 imparts resistance to apoptosis

One well-defined function of LMP1 that contributes to its oncogenic properties, is its ability to protect cells from apoptosis. Although LMP1 does not induce Bcl2 in epithelial cells, it does stimulate TNFAIP3/A20, Mcl-1, c-IAP2 (BIRC3) and Survivin (BIRC5), through NF-κB/AP-1-dependent mechanisms [4,7–9]. LMP1 engagement of the PI3-K/Akt pathway phosphorylates and inactivates the pro-apoptotic Bad and Foxo3a proteins [59]. LMP1 also protects epithelial cells against anchorage deprivation-induced apoptosis (anoikis) by upregulating α5β1 and αv containing integrins (e.g. αvβ6) [14]. The induction of interleukins (IL-1/6/10) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines may protect LMP1-expressing cells from apoptosis through sustained activation of NF-κB and STAT3 [67].

### 2.3.5. LMP1 induces an epithelial-mesenchyme-transition (EMT)

A key aspect of LMP1s transforming function is its ability to modulate epithelial cell morphology and motility. E-cadherin, a key cell adhesion molecule required for maintenance of tissue architectural integrity, is consistently down regulated in NPC [68]. LMP1 down regulates E-cadherin [69] through mechanisms that

involve either promoter methylation by DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) [70] or transcriptional repression by Twist, Snail (SNAI1) or Slug (SNAI2) [71]. These effects are accompanied by a profound morphological change, converting cuboidal epithelial cells to long spindle-shaped fibroblastic cells, a characteristic of cells undergoing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [6,11,69,71]. This is achieved in part through a mechanism involving cadherin “switching” and the up regulation of integrin receptors [11,72]. In many epithelial cell types, TGFβ co-operates with tyrosine kinase receptors or Ras to induce an EMT [73]. LMP1 has been shown to induce TGFβ [6] and to engage a number of signalling pathways (PI3-K/ERK-MAPK) that participate in the EMT process [14]. Indeed, TGFβ can synergise with LMP1 to induce an EMT in lung epithelial cells [74]. LMP1 induces the expression of Twist, Snail, Slug and Smad-interacting protein-1 (SIP1) [6,71,75], transcription factors that play key roles in the EMT response. These findings have direct relevance to NPC invasion and metastasis in vivo, as metastatic NPC have been found to overexpress Twist and Snail [71,75]. LMP1-induced EMT is also associated with the induction of Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and activation of the Ets1 transcription factor, whose activity promotes cell motility and invasion through effects on integrin signalling and the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [4,11]. Recent studies show that like other epithelial cells induced to undergo an EMT [76], LMP1-associated EMT is accompanied by the expression of cancer stem cell (CSC)/cancer progenitor cell (CPC) markers (CD44high/CD24low) and the acquisition of stem cell/progenitor cell-like properties [77]. These findings raise the possibility that in the appropriate cellular context, LMP1 can stimulate an EMT and may reprogramme EBV-infected epithelial cells to acquire stem cell or progenitor-like cell characteristics.

2.3.6. **LMP1 promotes cell motility, invasion and metastasis**

Compared to other types of HNSCC, NPC is a highly metastatic disease [42]. However, evidence regarding the role of LMP1 in NPC metastasis is controversial. While studies have identified positive correlations between LMP1 positivity and the degree of tumour metastasis [78–80], other studies have failed to identify such a link [82]. These conflicting reports are surprising given that LMP1 induces the expression of multiple factors that impact on cell motility and invasive cell growth [78,83]. In addition to its effects on cell-cell adhesion and cell motility, LMP1 modulates cell-matrix interactions through the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and downregulation of various metastasis suppressors. LMP1 upregulates the expression of ezrin, a cytoskeleton-related protein implicated in tumour invasion and metastasis, and down-regulates RECK1, an established metastasis suppressor [84,85]. LMP1 also promotes cell motility and invasive growth by modulating the levels of plakoglobin (γ-catenin) and promoting a switch in cadherin usage from E- to N-cadherin [86]. While LMP1 induces the expression of a number of MMPs in vitro [78,79,82], LMP1 positivity correlates with higher levels of MMP-1, 3 and 9 expression and lower levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) expression in metastatic NPC [78,80,81,87]. LMP1 induction of MMP-1 requires NF-κB and ERK-MAPK [88], while MMP-9 expression requires cross talk between AP-1 and the Ets1 transcription factor [89]. Interestingly, the levels of c-Met and Ets1 correlate with high levels of MMP expression in LMP1-positive metastatic NPC [90,91]. A recent study has also uncovered a role for IL6 and the ECM protein laminin in LMP1-mediated MMP-9 induction [92]. In addition to MMPs, LMP1 induces expression of Mucin 1 (MUC1), a mucinous glycoprotein expressed on many epithelial cells, which plays an essential role in tumour invasion and metastasis by opposing cell adhesions [93].

2.3.7. **LMP1 promotes angiogenesis**

The formation of new blood vessels to supply the tumours with oxygen and nutrients is an important facet of carcinogenesis. LMP1 has been shown to induce VEGF secretion in epithelial cells, through a mechanism involving the induction of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) [94–96] and MMP-9 [97]. The induction of IL-8 by LMP1 correlates with increased angiogenesis in NPC cases [98,99], an effect that is attributed, in part, to p38-SAPK activation and binding of NF-κB and ATF2 to the IL-8 promoter [100]. In addition, a clear correlation between LMP1 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been observed in NPC, an effect that may be linked to NF-κB. Interestingly, higher microvessel counts were observed in NPC tumours with high expression levels of either LMP1 or RAGE [101].

2.3.8. **LMP1 modulation of cellular micro-RNAs (miRs)**

Cellular microRNAs (miRs) have emerged as key regulators of essential biological processes. While many studies have focused on the expression and function of EBV-encoded miRs in NPC, comparatively few have focused on cellular miR expression. In one study, a number of oncogenic miR’s (miR-17-92 cluster and miR-155) were found to be up regulated, while a significant number of tumour-suppressor miR’s (miR-34 family, miR-143, and miR-145) were found to be significantly down regulated in NPC tumours compared to normal epithelium [102]. An additional study identified down-regulation of miR-29c, a negative regulator of ECM proteins, in NPC [103]. While roles for individual EBV genes in miR modulation were not assessed in these studies, several recent studies have identified LMP1 as a modulator of miR expression in both B cells and epithelial cells. LMP1 stimulates expression of miR-10b, a miR that promotes cell migration and invasion through transcriptional silencing of HOXD10, through a mechanism involving Twist [104]. LMP1 also stimulates expression of miR-155 through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism, an effect that is associated with down regulation of the lysine-specific demethylase, JMJD1A, and BACH1, a transcription factor involved in hypoxic regulation [105]; the same study confirmed expression of miR-155 in NPC tumours. A recent study has identified a reduction in expression of the miR-200 family in NPC. A role for miR200a modulation in NPC growth has been uncovered, and occurs through effects on ZEB2 and β-catenin expression [106]. Although data are not available, LMP1 may also influence expression of the miR-200 family given their key role in promoting an EMT [107].

2.3.9. **LMP1 strain variants and NPC**

The sequences of the LMP1 gene encoded by different EBV strains show a degree of variation in NPC. This, together with polymorphisms in other regions of the viral genome, raises the possibility of virus strain-specific disease associations. While point mutations have been identified in the c-terminus and transmembrane spanning domains of LMP1, the functionally important CTAR1 and CTAR2 domains remain relatively well conserved [108]. The lack of significant changes in these signalling domains is surprising given that a number of NPC-derived LMP1 variants (Cao-LMP1, C15-LMP1 and T510-LMP1) were found to be more oncogenic than the prototype B95.8-LMP1 strain in rodent fibroblasts and human epithelial cells [109–114]. These findings indicate that regions outside of identified signalling domains also impact on cell signalling. While original studies focussed on a region upstream of CTAR2 that was commonly deleted in more “oncogenic” LMP1 isolates [115], subsequent studies have confirmed that sequences within the transmembrane spanning domains influence LMP1 signalling [116]. The predominance of specific LMP1 variants in NPC may reflect differences in the biological or molecular properties of LMP1 variants, or may have evolved through immune selection [117].

### 3.1. Expression of LMP2 in NPC

Unlike LMP1, expression of LMP2A appears to be more consistent in NPC. Early studies confirmed expression of LMP2A mRNA in greater than 98% of NPC cases by RT-PCR, while expression of LMP2B appeared lower, and mirrored that of LMP1 [118,119]. Immunohistochemical staining has confirmed expression of LMP2A protein in greater than 50% of NPC cases [120,121], values which are probably an under-estimate due to the low levels of LMP2A expression in NPC.

### 3.2. LMP2 structure and localisation

The EBV-encoded LMP2 gene encodes two mRNAs that generate hydrophobic integral membrane proteins designated LMP2A and LMP2B. LMP2A and LMP2B are transcribed across the fused terminal repeats of the EBV episome from two different promoters 3 kb apart which generate mRNAs with 8 common exons, and a 5′ exon unique to each type. The 5′ exon of LMP2B is non-coding whereas the 5′ exon of LMP2A encodes an additional cytosolic sequence of 119 amino acids possessing signalling capabilities. The proteins share other structural properties including 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, and a 27 amino acid cytosolic carboxyl-terminus involved in intermolecular clustering of the LMP2 proteins [1,2,122–124] (Fig. 2). While LMP2A and LMP2B may share common or overlapping functions, studies suggest that the primary function of LMP2B is to negatively regulate LMP2A signalling [125].

Early studies indicated that LMP2A localised to the plasma membrane of B cells, co-localising with patches of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins [126]. However, investigations in non-B cells revealed that LMP2A and LMP2B localise to perinuclear endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the trans golgi network (TGN) and CD63-positive lysosomes [127–129]. Significant amounts of LMP2A localise to lipid rafts, microdomains that form membrane-associated signalling platforms [130]. A role for cholesterol in LMP2A stability and turnover has been identified, as cholesterol depletion, which disrupts lipid raft formation, blocks LMP2A endocytosis and turnover [131]. Although LMP2A is palmitoylated, the significance of this modification is unclear given that acylation is not required for LMP2A targeting to lipid raft microdomains [132].

### 3.3. LMP2A sequence motifs associated with signalling function

Extensive homology searches have failed to identify similarities between LMP2 and other human proteins. However, the cytosolic amino terminus of LMP2A contains numerous tyrosine residues, a number of which are contained within potential signalling motifs. These include tyrosines located within paired (YXXL) sequences at positions 74 and 85 (Y74/Y85), which constitute a putative immunoreceptor tyrosine activation (ITAM) motif, and a tyrosine at position 112 [Y112], within a YEEA sequence which forms a consensus c-Src binding site [123,124,133]. Additional tyrosines located upstream of the ITAM motif do not contribute to LMP2A signalling [134–136]. The amino terminus of LMP2A contains two proline-rich motifs (PPPPY) that constitute potential docking sites for cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases AIP4/Itchy, and two PY motifs (Y101, Y112) involved in recruitment of the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin protein ligases (Nedd-4 and HECT) [134,135]. The recruitment of ubiquitin ligases to LMP2A is essential for the turnover of LMP2A-associated proteins such as Lyn and Syk and the blockade of BCR signalling [135,136]. LMP2A signalling is also subjected to negative regulation through c-Cbl binding [137]. LMP2A is also phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP-kinases) and interacts with ERK1 directly [138]; however, the significance of this interaction is unknown.

### 3.4. LMP2A-associated signalling pathways – “The LMP2A signalosome”

Recent reviews regarding LMP2A signalling pathways have been detailed elsewhere [124,133]. While information regarding the nature of the LMP2A “signalosome” in epithelial cells is unknown, the composition of LMP2A signalling complexes in B cells is reasonably well defined. In B cells, the Src family kinase Lyn is recruited to motifs within the LMP2A amino terminus, resulting in phosphorylation of tyrosine 112 (Y112). In response to Lyn binding, additional tyrosine residues become phosphorylated, including those located within the ITAM motif (Y74/85). Once phosphorylated the ITAM motif (Y74/Y85) recruits the Syk PTK, resulting in the recruitment of a variety of adapter molecules (SLP-65, CrkL, Vav and Shb), which in turn recruit and activate PI3-kinase/Akt and other downstream signalling molecules [118,124,133]. Recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Itchy (Nedd-4), to poly-proline (PPPPY) motifs, and c-Cbl, down regulates LMP2A signalling [136,137]. While detailed information regarding the mechanisms of LMP2A activation in epithelial cells is not available, phosphorylation of the amino terminal tyrosine residues is triggered by cell adhesion to ECM, suggesting a role for integrin signalling in this process. Interestingly, a role for C-terminal c-Src kinase (Csk), rather than c-Src kinases in LMP2A phosphorylation has been identified [139]. The major signalling pathways engaged by LMP2 in epithelial cells are summarised in Fig. 2.

### 3.5. Functional studies on LMP2 expression in epithelial cells

While studies show that LMP2A and LMP2B are dispensable for EBV-mediated B cell transformation, it is now widely accepted that LMP2A functions to maintain EBV latency, an effect that is achieved through negative regulation of the BCR [140,141]. LMP2A blocks BCR signalling by physically excluding the BCR from lipid rafts [142] and by targeting BCR-associated tyrosine kinases (Lyn, Syk) for ubiquitin-mediated degradation [123,124,133,141]. This prevents BCR-mediated intracellular calcium release, protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) signalling, and the switch to lytic replication [123,124]. Although it is not clear whether LMP2A is required to maintain viral latency in EBV infected epithelial cells, LMP2A is required for the successful outgrowth of EBV-infected epithelial cells in vitro [143].

#### 3.5.1. LMP2 effects on epithelial cell growth and differentiation – a key role for PI3-kinase/Akt

Unlike B cells, comparatively little is known about the effects of LMP2A or LMP2B in epithelial cells. Whereas LMP1 induces epidermal hyperplasia in transgenic mice, epidermal targeting of LMP2A is not associated with gross alterations in tissue architecture [144]. However, when expressed in certain immortalised epithelial cell lines, LMP2A can induce anchorage-independent growth, enhance cell adhesion and cell motility, and inhibit epithelial cell differentiation [145–149]. While many of the effects of LMP2A on epithelial cell growth and differentiation are attributed to PI3-K/Akt activation, it is currently unknown which of the many PI3-K/Akt effectors are responsible for these various effects. For example, LMP2A has been shown to promote β-catenin signalling in epithelial cells, through a mechanism involving phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase (GSK3), a component of the β-catenin “destruction complex” [146]. While this ability requires PI3-K/Akt, it is currently unknown whether dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin plays a role in the differentiation blockade induced by LMP2A.

**Fig. 2.** Activation of cell signalling pathways by LMP2. The amino terminus of LMP2A contains motifs which provide docking sites for the tyrosine kinase Lyn, Syk, and the ubiquitin ligases Nedd4/Itchy. These activate the PI3-K/Akt, JNK/SAPK, ERK-MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways, which promote cell growth, inhibit apoptosis and differentiation, and contribute to cell transformation.

PI3-kinase/Akt signalling has also been shown to impart resistance to the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic actions of TGFβ in gastric epithelial cells [150], an effect that is relevant to epithelial growth transformation given that resistance to TGFβ plays a key role in epithelial carcinogenesis. LMP2A also stimulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, an effect that is also linked to PI3-K activation. This results in the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and the release of elongation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which combine to stimulate protein synthesis [151].

A number of studies clearly show that LMP2A can inhibit squamous epithelial cell differentiation, a phenomenon that may be linked to stabilisation of ΔNp63, a protein that plays a key role in maintaining the basal cell compartment in stratified squamous epithelium [152]. ΔNp63 has been shown to promote cell survival and maintain an undifferentiated state by regulating an epithelial “adhesion programme” [153]. As with the majority of LMP2A-mediated effects, this requires the ITAM and PY motifs and constitutive PI3-K/Akt signalling. Although the effects of ΔNp63 on epithelial cell adhesion has yet to be confirmed, it is supported by studies showing that LMP2A can promote epithelial cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and enhance cell migration in both primary and immortalised epithelial cell lines [148,149,154]. A recent study has shown that LMP2A can induce Notch activity in epithelial cells [155]. While the mechanisms involved in Notch activation are yet to be resolved, this effect is specific to LMP2A. This study has established that Notch activation serves to generate an auto-regulatory loop to regulate LMP2A expression. These findings may have direct relevance in vivo, as a recent report has found that Notch 3 is consistently over-expressed in NPC [156].

### 3.5.2. LMP2A induces an EMT
Recent studies show that LMP2A, like LMP1, can induce an EMT when expressed in certain nasopharyngeal epithelial cell lines. This effect is associated with the acquisition of stem cell-like properties and an increase in the number of cells displaying a side-population (SP)-like phenotype. Moreover, the same study identified a positive correlation between expression of LMP2A and expression of established epithelial stem cell markers in cell lines and NPC biopsies [157]. These findings raise the possibility that in the appropriate cellular context, LMP1 and LMP2A can stimulate an EMT and reprogramme EBV-infected epithelial cells to acquire stem cell-like characteristics.

### 3.5.3. LMP2A and LMP2B impart resistance to the anti-viral effects of IFN
While LMP1 has been shown to stimulate anti-viral responses in epithelial cells through the induction of IRF7 and the expression of a selected subset of ISGs [16], a recent study has shown that LMP2A and LMP2B can limit the actions of IFNα/β through

mechanisms that involve the increased turnover and degradation of IFNα/β and IFNγ receptors. This results in attenuation of GAF and ISGF3 complex formation and a “global” down regulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [158]. While these effects may serve to protect latently infected epithelial cells from the anti-viral action of IFNs, they may also antagonise LMP1’s ability to induce an anti-viral state and to establish latency. These findings suggest that optimal levels of LMP2A are required for successful latent infection and efficient clonal outgrowth [143]. The ability of LMP2A to attenuate IFN-signalling can be extended to the include effects on IL-6/STAT3 signalling. LMP2A has been shown to down regulate NF-κB and STAT signalling in EBV infected epithelial cells through effects on IL-6 transcription and secretion [159].

### 4. Conclusions

There is now strong evidence supporting a role for EBV in the pathogenesis of NPC. Although early studies on LMP1 and LMP2 function were performed in B cells and rodent fibroblast systems, it is now clear that both LMP1 and LMP2 exert profound effects on the behaviour of epithelial cells, impacting on a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, motility and invasion. The limited availability of appropriate epithelial cell lines and in vivo model systems has hampered research on LMP1 and LMP2 function in this cell type. As the cellular environment is likely to be an important factor when determining the biological output of LMP1 and LMP2 signalling, future work needs to focus on identifying the NPC progenitor cell and the key signalling pathways and downstream effectors that are targeted by LMP1 and LMP2 in this setting. Further unravelling of the interactions between LMP1, LMP2 and cellular processes will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of NPC and identify opportunities for targeted therapeutic intervention.
