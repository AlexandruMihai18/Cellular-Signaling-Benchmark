## ABSTRACT

The mechanisms underlying autoimmunity and cancer remain elusive. However, perpendicular evidence has been evolved in the past decade that T helper (Th)17 cells and their related molecules are implicated in initiation and induction of various disease settings including both diseases. Meanwhile, extensive research on Th17 cells elucidated various molecules including cytokines and transcription factors as well as signaling pathways involved in the differentiation, maturation, survival and ultimate commitment of Th17 cells. In the current review, we revise the mechanistic underpinnings delivered by recent research on these molecules in the Th17 differentiation/commitment concert. We emphasize on those molecules proposed as targets for attaining potential therapies of various autoimmune disorders and cancer, aiming both at dampening the dark-side of Th17 repertoire and simultaneously potentiating its benefits in the roster of the antimicrobial response.

## 1. Introduction

Differentiation of T cell begins after pathogen assault and antigen presentation via TCR, an event that probably determines the first decision of Tcell’s fate. According to the early paradigm of Mosmann and Coffman [1], naive CD4+ Th0 cells functionally diverse interferon (IFN)-γ-secreting Th1 or interleukin (IL)-4-secreting Th2 cells that provide help to the antibody-secreting B cells. This concept was held for years, before the emergence of recent updates that revolutionized this binary paradigm in the last decades. A third subset of Th cells are the Foxp3-expressing T regulatory cells (Tregs), that either derive from the thymus through IL-2 signaling (nTreg) or induced from Th0 cells in the periphery (iTreg) in presence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and IL-2 [2]. iTregs derive from Th0 under sub-immunogenic levels of antigen presentation, during chronic inflammation and normal gut homeostasis, and hence are essential in mucosal immune tolerance and in the control of severe chronic inflammation and likely constitute a barrier against eradication of tumors [3,4]. Further, following the discovery of a fourth uniquely defined subset of CD4+ Tcells, namely the IL-17-producing (Th17) cells, it became well-established that independent of the

cytokines IL-12/IFN-γ or IL-4 and the transcription factor (TF) T-bet or GATA3 that are indispensable for induction of Th1 and Th2, respectively, various cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, TGF-β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, orchestrate the differentiation, expansion, maintenance, survival and pathogenicity of Th17 cells. These cells constitute a subset that originates from CD161+ precursors in umbilical cord blood and newborn thymus [5]. The master TF of Th17 cells is the RORγt and their signature product is IL-17A (hereafter referred to as IL-17), that is also known to be produced by a variety of cell types including Th0/Th1 but not by Th2 cell lineages [6].

A major immunologic interest in the arena of T cell research has been to identify various traits of Th17 cells as well as factors required for their commitment and survival. This came up with the description of pathogenic and non-pathogenic subsets [7,8], as well as the high degree of Th17 cells’ plasticity that encompassed their conversion into IFN-γ or IFN-γ/IL-17 producers as in the progression course of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [9,10]; they were found to acquire their cytotoxic potential only following conversion into IFN-γ producers [11]. Key factors in the commitment program of Th17 cells included IL-23 signaling that was found to be indispensable for attaining pathogenic myelin-reactive Th17 cells [7] and to synergize with IL-1β for establishment of innate and adaptive inflammatory responses in gut; with IL-1R signaling exerting a vital role in attaining accumulation and survival of pathogenic Th17 responses [11]. On the other hand, it was found that is the contact with APC, not the presence of IL-23, that drives the pathogenicity of Th17 cells derived from naïve CD4+ cells [8],

proposing different prerequisites for acquiring pathogenicity of pre-
sensitized and naive cells. Meanwhile, many independent groups
have conducted studies to explore variations in the differentiation/
commitment program of murine and human Th17 lineages.
As we recently reviewed [12], in both cases, the presence of a pro-
inflammatory milieu represented by various cytokines including
IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, IL-1β and TNF-α is a common feature. However,
the main debate existed concerned whether the presence of TGF-β
is indispensable for the differentiation of human Th17 cells as in
case of mice.

Further research on Th17 cells has also assigned both innate
and adaptive subtypes based on detecting functional Th17 cells
and production of protective IL-17 during the early-phase of the
immune response [13–15], that even precedes the differentiation
of Th1 cells [13], together with the later contribution of Th17 [16].
Further, identifying heterogenic Th17 cells encompassed identification
of IL-17⁺, IL-21⁺ of IL-22⁺ subsets with diverse contributions
in defense mechanisms and associated with various disease settings.
Along this way, despite the development of autoimmune signs
in the absence of detectable IL-17 levels, as for instance in case
of choriomeningitis virus-induced model of type 1 diabetes [17],
a pivotal role of Th17 cells’ related products in various inflammatory
and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis
(MS) and EAE has been evidenced [12]. Beneficial functions of Th17
cells comprise production of IL-17 that is common with NK [18],
γδ T [19–21] CD8⁺ T and mast cells [12,22] and determines specialization
for oral immunity to attain a mucosal barrier against
intracellular (e.g. Citrobacter, Salmonella [15,20,23]) and extracellular
(e.g. Klebsiella [24]) bacteria, fungi (e.g. Candida [25,26])
and viruses (e.g. HSV-2) [19]. IL-21 production builds a positive autologous triggering loop of Th17 differentiation [27,28], supports B
and follicular Th cells [29–31], and hence contributes to anti-
infectious and anti-tumor mechanisms (e.g. against melanoma),
but also autoimmunity [32,33]. IL-22 is the main product of Th22
cells [34,35] that probably constitute a specialized Th17 subtype
homing the skin. Although both of IL-22 and IL-17 or IL-17F found
to synergize to stimulate expression of antimicrobial peptides [12],
IL-22, rather than IL-17, seems to contribute more to epidermal and
mucosal immunity [35,36], and synergizes with TNF-α to endow
antimicrobial response [37].

In the current review, we summarize the latest research findings
concerning molecules involved in the differentiation, maturation,
survival and final commitment of Th17 cells. We emphasize on
the redundancy of the role of TGF-β in combination to proinflammatory
cytokines in inducing differentiation of human Th17 cells on
the basis of results delivered from mouse studies. Furthermore, we
highlight factors proposed as targets for potential therapies aiming
at combating initiation and/or induction of various disease settings
known for their association with the potent inflammatory Th17
cells and related molecules.

side to inhibit Th17 and induces iTreg via inhibiting the TFs RORα
and RORγt [40,41]. A third cytokine in the interplay of Th17 and
iTregs is IL-10 that, together with TGF-β, constitutes a key regulator arm of Tregs’ development and regulates responses also
of Th17 cells [42,43]. The fourth cytokine in this concert is IL-2,
signaling via STAT5, that inhibits STAT3-mediated induction of IL-
17 [44]; see below for more details. An explanation for the finding
that exogenous IL-2 did not revert the induction of RORγt and
the accompanied IL-17 induced response [45] is that IL-2 may
have inhibitory effects only on earlier stages in the Th17 differentiation program. Interestingly, through consumption of IL-2 by
Tregs promoting thereby their own expansion, IL-2 is involved
indirectly in the in vivo and in vitro Tregs-mediated induction of
early Th17 cells [46,47]. The promoted Tregs then ensures attaining
the immune homeostasis following pathogen clearance, as shown
in case of *Candida albicans* oral infection in mice [46]. This may
underscore that certain factors mediated by the persistence of the
pathogen itself, comprising for instance the long exposure to proinflammatory cytokines, derive dysregulation of this balance yielding
chronic inflammation and ultimately autoimmunity induction.

An important factor in the Th17 regulation scenario is
the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-kynurenine pathway,
which comprise the aerobic metabolism of L-tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine catalyzed by one particular important (Th1)
immunosuppressive enzyme, IDO, that has a well established
ability in inducing immunological tolerance [48]. Elevation in
IDO levels is known to induce Tregs via inhibiting plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (pDCs) production of IL-6, and thereby inhibits conversion of Treg into Th17 cells [49]. Therefore, blocking of IDO
activity significantly abrogated pDCs-driven [50,51] and mucosal
CD103⁺ DCs-driven Treg cell generation [52], and induced Th1
and Th17 both in vitro and in vivo [52]. Up-regulation of IDO in
human MS patients-driven PBMCs leads to down-regulation of Th1
and Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α, G-CSF, and IL-12) [53],
in mouse spleen and peripheral lymph nodes after TLR9 ligation with
CpG that suppressed local T cell responses to exogenous antigens
and inhibited proinflammatory cytokines [54]. Increased IDO levels in myeloid DCs were associated with the loss of Th17 versus
increase in Tregs and plasma concentration of microbial products in HIV-seropositive subjects [55]. Such IDO-mediated Treg
induction could be prevented by CTLA4 or PD-1/PD-ligand co-
stimulatory blockade following CpG treatment [54]. In line with
this, up-regulation of IDO shown to be associated with ablated
release of IL-17 by NKp44⁺ NK cells in the gut during SIV-infection,
and treating same cells with IDO in vitro revealed same effect
dose-dependently [56]. In addition, kynurenine, the first metabolite in the IDO-kynurenine degradation pathway that undergoes a
transamination forming kynurenic acid (KA), induces the in vitro
generation of Treg involving induction of Cyp1A1 and Cyp1B1. The
latter event is mediated by activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that is indispensable for optimal TGF-β-mediated Treg
generation [57]. Nevertheless, KA mediates AhR-dependent induction of Cyp1A1 but probably also antagonizes the effect of IDO and
kynurenine by enhancing the production of IL-6 [58].

Another event in the reciprocal regulation of Th17 and Tregs
is the synergism between TGF-β and retinoic acid (RA), a vitamin
A metabolite, which is produced by mucosal DCs and antagonizes
the IL-6 effect in inducing Th17 cells [59,60]. Priming CD4⁺ T cells
at Th17 conditions in presence of mesenteric lymph node (MLN)
DCs derived Th17 differentiation with a higher efficiency that was
comparable to that attained in presence of splenic DCs only upon
addition of RA receptor antagonist (RAR) to the MLN cultures [59].
In absence of RAR, MLN cultures revealed a higher proportion of
CTLA-4high Foxp⁺ Tregs, induced by RA and TGF-β. The inhibitory
effect of RA on Th17 differentiation, mediated by inhibition of
RORγt, was dependent on endogenous IL-2, and contributes to

2. Reciprocal regulation of Th17 and Treg cells

An important balancing and triggering event in the regulation
program of Th17 and Tregs is that they reciprocally regulate
each other. It is likely that both cells share a common origin and
that there is indeed a substantial plasticity between them as both
require TGF-β for their differentiation [12,38]. IL-6, a key cytokine
of the acute phase response but also other circumstances, e.g. in
malignancies, plays a key role in attaining the balance between
Th17 and iTregs during infection [39], in the development of the
enteric innate Th17 cells [15], and in the conversion of iTreg into
Th17 cells [39]. The reciprocal regulation of both sets comprises
also TGF-β-mediated induction of Foxp3 that acts on the other

stable Foxp3 expression in Tregs. The authors [59] documented similar RA-elicited inhibition of IL-17⁺ CD8⁺ cells differentiation, as well as in both T cell phenotypes in APC-free conditions, and in mice orally infected with *Listeria monocytogenes*. Similarly, it was reported that IL-10-producing APCs induced TGF-β-mediated RA-dependent differentiation of Foxp3⁺ Tregs; their proportion is reduced by blocking RAR [43]. In line with this, administration of RA abrogated Th17-mediated allergic airway inflammation via induction of Tregs activity [61].

### 3. Key cytokines and cell receptors in the differentiation/regulation program of Th17

Until recently, whereas the mechanism underlying the innate IL-17 response were not fully clear, key factors taking part at the differentiation and maturation scenario of Th17 cells have been quite identified. These include the cytokines IL-6, TGF-β, IL-21, IL-1β and TNF-α together the various TFs (see below).

#### 3.1. IL-6 and TGF-β

Up-regulation of RORγt by antigens of *Toxoplasma* in NK cells as well as their production of IL-17 was dependent on the presence of IL-6, IL-23, and TGF-β, and inhibited by IL-2, IL-15 and IL-27 [18]. These findings have led to the conclusion that many of the same cytokines that (up-)regulate Th17 cells are part of a conserved pathway that also control innate IL-17 production. However, some inconsistencies exist, mainly due to the redundancy of the unique role of TGF-β for induction of human Th17 cells [62]. In mammals, TGF-β exists in three isoforms, of which TGF-β1 is the most prominent in the immune system playing a key role in the differentiation and maturation program of Th17 as well as Tregs, and hence also in the course of inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer; TGF-β1 deficiency in mice causes a multiorgan autoimmune inflammatory disease and an early postnatal mortality; for review see [63]. In line with the recently established findings, whereas TGF-β plays a key role in the generation of IL-17⁺ γδ T cells in the thymus during the postnatal period [64], it may exert an indirect effect in the differentiation program of Th17 cells by constraining the induction of Th1 and Th2 through blocking the expression of their prototypical TFs, namely STAT4 and GATA-3, respectively [65]. At higher concentrations, however, as in case of parasitic infection, TGF-β inhibits Th17 among other cell responses [66]. IL-6 singling alone was necessary and sufficient to reverse human T cell suppression by Tregs in vitro [67], and also to induce robust differentiation of Th17 from CD4⁺ T cells derived from STAT6⁻/⁻ T-bet⁻/⁻ mice (these cells could not produce signature Th1 and Th2 cytokines) [65]. The last authors found that addition of anti-TGF-β antibodies exerted no influence on IL-6-mediated effects, and that BALB/c STAT6⁻/⁻ T-bet⁻/⁻ mice, but not wild-type counterparts, were highly susceptible to the development of EAE that could be blocked by anti-IL-17 antibodies but not by anti-TGF-β treatment.

Consistent with the previous findings, recent studies reported that combination of IL-6 and IL-1β alone, or with IL-23, but independent of TGF-β, was adequate for differentiation of Th17 cells [68,69], and hence IL-1R⁻/⁻ mice revealed impaired Th17 cell response and reduced incidence of EAE [70], although IL-1 found to induce antigen-mediated expansion of in vitro primed Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells transferred to IL-1R1⁻/⁻ recipients [71]. These studies reveal that TGF-β may be dispensable, however, the presence of TGF-β in serum-enriched cell culture media used in many investigations, and the presence of other TGF-β resources such as thrombocytes [72,73] does not exclude the role played by TGF-β in human Th17 proliferation program. Moreover, unlike in case of TGF-β-deficient mice that lack Th17 cells [74], deletion of cell products like TGF-β in cell cultures by addition of neutralizing antibodies may not be complete. Besides, the production of cell-bound TGF-β form by activated CD4⁺ T cells that stimulate other cells in the vicinity in a paracrine fashion cannot be excluded [75]. This interpretation seems to be consistent with results of various independent groups who demonstrated the requirement of TGF-β for RORγt induction [76], and the induction of Th17 cells on adaptive transfer of Tregs, a source of TGF-β [77], though its earlier administration abrogates the disease due to suppressing T cell expansion. The same cytokine (TGF-β) is necessary for sustained expression of IL-17 and IL-17F by Th17 cells [78]; on its absence, however, both IL-23 and IL-12 acted to suppress IL-17 and enhance IFN-γ production in a STAT4- and T-bet-dependent manner. Similarly, IL-17 expression by in vitro generated Th17 cells was dependent on continued TGF-β/IL-6 or IL-23 signaling, and was blocked by IFN-γ and IL-4 signaling [79], endorsing indirect effects on Th17 cells exerted by TGF-β by constraining Th1 and Th2 responses.

As shown in Fig. 1, TGF-β acts through inhibiting the IL-6/IL-21-mediated induction of Socs3 promoter activity, and ultimately Socs3 expression, and thereby enhances STAT3 activation in Th0 cells [80]. On absence of TGF-β signaling, IL-6 mediates induction of Socs3 expression in CD4⁺ T cells and abrogates STAT3 activation [80]. SOCS3 was found to be a major regulator of IL-23-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation; SOCS3 deletion leads to enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-17 production [81]. With this regard, SOCS1 is also required by Th17 cells to inhibit IFN-γ-mediated STAT1 activation; otherwise activated STAT1 activates SOCS3 that in turn inhibits IL-6 mediated STAT3 induction [82]. The effect of TGF-β is further highlighted by a recent work revealing that in vitro Th17 responses to *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* could be diverted to Th1/Th2 by blockade of TGF-β, but not of IL-17 [83].

TGF-β signals through TGF-βR-activated SMAD proteins. SMAD2 is essential for Th17 cell differentiation acting, in part, by modulating the expression of IL-6R [84]. Mice lacking SMAD2 in T cells do not develop spontaneous lymphoproliferative autoimmunity [84]; however, the responsiveness of Smad2⁻/⁻ T cells to TGF-β in vitro was dose-dependent. Together with Smad3 [85], Smad2 is also essential for the TGF-β-induced Foxp3 expression [84,86]. Smad3, on the contrary, is involved in the reciprocal regulation of Th17 and Tregs through its interaction with RORγt inhibiting thereby Th17 differentiation [85]. Therefore, Smad2/3 double KO mice develop fatal inflammatory diseases, with reduced Foxp3 expression in CD4⁺ T cells at the periphery [87]. The latter authors found that TGF-β-mediated induction of RORγt was independent of Smad2/Smad3, but Foxp3 induction was dependent on both Smads as revealed by Smad2⁻/⁻ Smad3⁺/⁺ and Smad2⁺/⁺ Smad3⁻/⁻ CD4⁺ T cells. Similar to Smad3 [85], Smad4 deficiency attenuated TGF-β-mediated in vitro polarization of Foxp3⁺ CD4⁺ T cells, and induced Th17 cell differentiation that likely accounted for the formation of epithelial premalignant lesions of the gastro-duodenal region in mice [88]. Altogether, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on Th1 and Th2 may just constitute a secondary supportive effect, but it is indispensable for proliferation of Th17 cells from naive CD4⁺ T cells both in mice and man. This seems to be the same in case of induction of IL-17 secretion by γδT cells [64], but not as in case of CD8⁺ T cells that in the absence of TGF-β spontaneously acquire IL-17 production commitment [74]. Additionally, TGF-β induces Th17 cells through suppressing Eomes (a negative regulator of Th17 cells, see below) [89].

#### 3.2. IL-23

Again, in contrast to mice, the combination of IL-6 and TGF-β alone is not adequate for human Th17 differentiation; the cytokines IL-1, TNF-α and IL-23 are also key factors in the differentiation program of human Th17. In this regard, IL-23 may be responsible for

orchestrating the pathogenicity of IL-17 response, as it is known to be indispensable for the survival and expansion of Th17 as well as for the production of IL-22, and in particular IL-21 that constitutes an autocrine positive loop for Th17 induction in both mice and human, reviewed in [12]. Signaling of IL-23R potentiates the pathogenic potential of Th17 cells infiltrating the CNS via suppressing IL-10 expression and inducing the proinflammatory chemokine production [7], and induction of IL-22 expression [90]. Furthermore, IL-23 signaling is crucial factor regarding the plasticity of Th17 in vivo, as it drives the up-regulation of T-bet, and their cytokine production switch into IFN-γ producers [10]. Recently, a novel concept was delivered that an alternative co-stimulation through CD5, rather than CD28, primes Th0 cells for stable Th17 development through promoting the expression of IL-23R [91]. In the presence of Th17 differentiation factors, CD5 co-stimulation induced more Th17 cells with increased IL-17 production and pronounced upstream activation of STAT3 and RORγt.

### 3.3. BAFF

Another important cytokine participating in the differentiation program of Th17 is the B cell activating factor BAFF that is produced by many cells including macrophages, DCs, epithelial, and activated T cells. Elevated serum profiles of BAFF are association with increased auto-antibodies (AA) in patients with various autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis [92] and Sjögren’s syndrome [93], all known of higher Th17 cytokine production and especially of IL-17. A link between BAFF and Th17 cells was drawn by the finding that local gene silencing of BAFF suppressed Th17 cell generation and ameliorated autoimmune arthritis [92], indicating that targeting BAFF could deliver valuable benefits, probably also in other autoimmune settings.

### 3.4. ICOS

ICOS (inducible co-stimulator of T cells) is a co-stimulatory member of the CD28 superfamily known to regulate CD4⁺ cells. Deletion of ICOS in mice was linked to compromised Th17 after IL-23 stimulation, and TFH cells (that also produce IL-17), via ICOS-induced c-Maf regulation of IL-21 release [94]. Further, blockade of ICOS reduced disease severity in G6PI-induced arthritis by inhibiting accumulation of poly-functional Th1/Th17 cells [95]. This, however, cannot explain the decrease of ICOS in patients with lupus nephritis [96], which is known of its association with IL-17 response induction [97]. Apparently, ICOS is rather critical for the homeostasis and suppressive function of Tregs [98–101]. Therefore, ICOS deficiency resulted in increased *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* specific CD4⁺ Th1 response, due to reduced Tregs [102]. Also, the production of suppressive IL-10 by IFN-γ⁺ Th1 cells in a murine model of malaria infection was associated with increased ICOS expression [103]. The role of ICOS in autoimmunity, likely through induction of TFH cell expansion, is highlighted by its blockade that significantly reduced the hypergammaglobulinemia and dsDNA-specific AA production [104]. Similarly, in airway hyperresponsiveness mechanisms, where initial IL-17 release is known to participate in the pathology, ICOS was implicated in induction of TGF-β/IL-10/IL-35-producing Tregs that mediate decrease of airway hyperresponsiveness by suppressing IL-17 release after multiple daily allergen challenges [101]. Further, HCV elimination was found to occur more frequently in patients with lower ICOS expression levels upon RBV treatment, that was associated with decrease in IL-10 production by CD4⁺ T cells [105].

## 4. Transcription factors in differentiation/regulation program of Th17

Various TFs are key players in regulating of Th17 cell differentiation. These include the orphan nuclear receptor RORα and RORγt, AhR and the NF-κB family member IkBζ that are activated during differentiation of Th17 [106]. Other TFs are, however, not restricted to Th17 cells, include (i) positive regulators such as STAT3, the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)4, Runt-related TF (Runx1) and B-cell activating factor (BATF), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1α, members of the NF-κB family, and the cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM)α; and (ii) negative regulators, including STAT1 and STAT5, liver X receptor (LXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α, -β/γ and -δ, T cell factor (TCF)-1, and eomesodermin (Eomes).

### 4.1. RORα and RORγt

As mentioned above, the master TF of Th17 cells is the retinoid receptor RORγt, the counterpart for T-bet of Th1 and GATA3 of Th2 cells, a statement that relies on the finding that *RorC⁻/⁻* mice demonstrated reduced Th17 cell response with lower susceptibility to EAE [107], whereas over-expression of its product (RORγt) induced the response [108]. The latter author found that the induction of RORγt together with RORα by TGF-β and IL-6 is dependent on STAT3 signaling, and their co-expression synergistically led to greater Th17 differentiation, while depletion of both protected mice from EAE. It was found that RORγt acts by directly binding to *Il17* gene promoter, and RORγt-mediated promoter activation was suppressed by forced expression of Foxp3 [109]. Furthermore, Notch-signaling is one of the recently highlighted pathways involved in the differentiation program of Th17, which targets both RORγt and IL-17 [110]. Notch1 is activated in both mouse and human in vitro-polarized Th17 cells, therefore, inhibiting Notch signaling reduced IL-17 production and Th17-mediated EAE

Fig. 1. Schematic model demonstrating key molecules that are involved in promoting or inhibiting the differentiation, maturation and final commitment of IL-17-producing T helper (Th17) cells. Upon antigen recognition, TCR and cytokine signaling activate various transcription factors (TFs) including NFAT and NF-κB that further drive cell activation and proliferation. (A) At low levels of TGF-β, RORγt is encoded by *RorC* as an inactive form that become activated in presence of proinflammatory cytokines and controls the full transcript machinery of Th17 cells. TGF-β maintains cell responsiveness to IL-6 signaling that activates STAT3, which then acts by inhibiting SOCS3 and inducing both RORα and RORγt expression as well as up-regulation of IL-23R and activate autocrine regulation of Th17 cells via IL-21 release. IL-23 signaling is crucial for survival and effector functions of Th17, production of IL-22 and later production of IFN-γ. AhR positively regulates Th17 cells possibly by abrogating activation of STAT1 and STAT5, and is crucial for production of IL-22, that also necessitates IL-23 signaling. Key TFs include IRF4, BATF (that becomes activated by TCR and regulates the expression of RORγt and its target genes including *Il17, Il17f, Il21* and *Il22*), Runx1 (that promote Th17 differentiation by binding to and acting together with RORγt during *Il17* transcription), HIF1α (that is mTOR-dependent and regulates the balance between Th17 and Tregs by direct transcriptional activation of RORγt and attenuating Tregs by binding Foxp3 and enhancing its degradation) and members of NF-κB: IkBζ, RelA and IKKα as well as the GTPase Rheb-dependent mTOR complex mTORC1 (that is indispensable for Th17 differentiation). (B) At high levels, TGF-β alone (whilst the absence of proinflammatory signals), induces Foxp3 expression and hence T regulatory cell (Treg) differentiation. Various cytokines inhibit Th17 differentiation, these include IL-2 that signals via STAT5 and IL-10 (both of them induce Tregs), as well as IL-27 that induces STAT1 and inhibits SOCS1. SOCS1 is required by Th17 cells to inhibit STAT1 that otherwise activates SOCS3 and ultimately prevents STAT3 activation. Wnt/β-catenin signaling stabilizes β-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates TCF-1 that in turn activates the T-box TF Eomesodermin (Eomes), both TCF1 and Eomes inhibit *Il17* promoter. LXR is another negative regulator of Th17, which encodes another TF Srebp-1 that inhibits *Il17* promoter via binding its E-box element. PPARγ activation is mTORC1-mediated and intrinsically suppresses IL-17 gene transcription via blocking the activation-induced removal of repressor complexes from the *Il17* promoter as well as interfering with RORγt transcription).
progression. In addition, delta-like 4 (Dll4), which is a notch ligand inducible by pathogen-associated signals through TLR activation on DCs, inhibits Th2 cytokine production and in the presence of IL-6 and TGF-$\beta$ promotes generation of Th17 cells via targeting RorC and $il17$ promoters [111].

### 4.2. AhR

AhR, a member of the PAS-superfamily of proteins, is present in the cytoplasm as a complex with other molecules including its chaperones HSP90, and translocates into the nucleus upon activation to bind with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) yielding the complete TF, that subsequently activates the transcription of a growing list of genes, among them are those that encode xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as cytochromes P450 (Cyp)1A1, -A2 and Cyp1B1; for review see [112]. AhR is originally known to mediate metabolism of xenobiotics leading to their hydrolysis or their biotransformation and elimination [112], and sense a wide range of natural endogenous ligand including 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), prostaglandins and metabolites of tryptophan such as kynurenic acid as well as IDO enzyme, dietary flavonols and environmental toxins including TCDD, which probably displays the greatest affinity to AhR [58,113,114]. AhR ligation by dioxins mediates a variety of toxic responses including immune suppression, epithelial hyperplasia and carcinogenesis [112].

Among other cells, Th17 and $\gamma \delta$ T cells preferentially express AhR [115,116]. Despite the intensive research on AhR signaling with regard to development and functioning of Th17 cells, this issue remains largely elusive. It was found that ligand-specific activation of the AhR regulates the induction of Th17 versus Treg response in mice [113], probably dependent on the induction of IDO in DCs by various ligands [117]. AhR expression is proposed to be required for IL-22 but not for optimal IL-17 production in both Th17 cells [114,115] and $\gamma \delta$ T cells [116]. Whereas TCDD or FICZ alone could not induce Th17 cell development, but increased the percentage of IL-17-secreting cells induced by TGF-$\beta$ plus IL-6 in WT cells [118]; each enhanced IL-22, but simultaneously, in contrast PGE$_{2}$, decreased IL-17 production by CD4$^{+}$ T cells [114]. These ligands up-regulated AhR at Th17-polarizing conditions, and hence AhR$^{-/-}$ Th0 cells showed a compromised ability to differentiate into Th17 even at their presence [118,119]. CD4$^{+}$ T cells derived from AhR$^{-/-}$ mice could develop Th17 response, but when confronted with AhR ligand failed to produce IL-22, with no improvement of Th17 cell development, and hence a reduced onset of EAE in comparison to control littermates [115]. Parallel to this is the discovery that AhR agonists reduced RorC expression, without affecting T-bet, GATA-3 and Foxp3, and decreased the expression of IL-23R, and hence Th17 polarization and favored differentiation IL-22-producing CD4$^{+}$ T cells (Th22) independently of IL-17 or IFN-$\gamma$ production [114]. Therefore, it may be concluded that, beside inducing CD161$^{-}$ Th22 cell differentiation from Th0 cells, AhR ligation is sequential for mediating optimal IL-22 production by already established Th17 cells, as its activation does not change the expression of most early T cell differentiation genes [120], and indirectly affecting Th17 cells through ligand-specific regulation of Treg-Th17 cell balance [49,52–54,57,58,113,115,117], as will be discussed below in details. Whether that the inability to produce IL-22 might contribute to compromised stability of Th17 is not clear and warrants further investigations.

### 4.3. STATs

Among other STAT proteins that constitute a critical initiating step in the signaling cascades of many cellular events including cytokine production [121], activation of STAT3, acting via direct binding to $Il17$ and $Il17F$ promoters [81], is a key determinant of whether naive T cell differentiates into iTreg or into an inflammatory Th17 cells [122]. In hyper-IgE syndrome (Job’s syndrome) patients, there is a dominant-negative mutation in STAT3 [123] leading to compromised IL-17 production and increased susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus infection [124,125]. Also mice harboring STAT3$^{-/-}$ CD4$^{+}$ T cells do not develop EAE or EAU due to defective Th17 response [126]. Moreover, the requirement of TGF-$\beta$ in the pathogenesis of EAE relies on the finding that it activates STAT3, that in turn induces ROR$\alpha$ and ROR$\gamma$t [127]. Interestingly, similar to the need of Tregs for IRF4 to suppress Th2 [128] or the need for T-bet to suppress Th1 [129], STAT3 is also required by Tregs to suppress Th17 response [127], and this ensures lineage-specific control of immune response. STAT1 and STAT5 signaling, on the other hand, inhibit $Il17$ promoter activation (see below).

### 4.4. IRF4

Besides its critical role in controlling the function of mature T and B cells, especially its differential inhibiting effects in naive but promotion of Th2 cytokines in effector/memory CD4$^{+}$ T cells [130], the activity of IRF4 is found to regulate Th17 cell induction. IRF4 is found to be positively or negatively influenced by the serine-threonine kinase ROCK2 [131] or IRF4 binding protein [132], respectively. ROCK2, when activated, phosphorylates IRF4 that in turn regulates the synthesis of IL-17 and IL-21 and the differentiation of Th17 cells [131]. In line with this, IRF4$^{-/-}$ CD4$^{+}$ T cells revealed compromised ROR$\gamma$t and IL-17 but more Foxp3 expression in response to TGF-$\beta$ and IL-6, and IRF4$^{-/-}$ mice were resistant to EAE [133]. IRF4 acts likely via cooperation with STAT3 [134] to mediate induction of ROR$\gamma$t or cooperation with NFAT family members affecting thereby other Th cell types [130,135] as well.

### 4.5. HIF1$\alpha$

HIF-1$\alpha$ is a heterodimeric TF known as cancer marker strongly induced by hypoxia. It is known to potentiate aggressiveness of tumor cells, greatly affect their responsiveness to irradiation and chemotherapy and is associated with increased incidence of post-irradiation tumor recurrence [136–138]. The perception that mTOR is a central regulator of cellular metabolism was confirmed by finding that blocking glycolysis promoted Treg at the expense of Th17 response [139], and that HIF1$\alpha$ was selectively expressed by Th17 cells, where its signaling was mTOR-dependent and shown to be induced by IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, IL-17 proposed to synergize with TNF-$\alpha$ to induce HIF1$\alpha$ production [140]. In turn, HIF1$\alpha$ regulates the balance between Th17 and Tregs through direct transcriptional activation of ROR$\gamma$t and attenuating Tregs by binding Foxp3 and enhancing its proteasomal degradation [141]. That HIF1$\alpha$ deficiency reduced Th17 development and protected mice from neuro-inflammation [139] and EAE [141] may lead to the conclusion that induction of HIF1$\alpha$ by Th17 cells may constitute a positive loop that in turn magnifies IL-17 inflammatory response. These findings together with those derived from previous studies directed development of therapeutic strategies of HIF blockade against inflammatory/autoimmune diseases [142] as well as cancer [136–138,143]. Since induction of HIF-1 activity accompanies transformation of cells into a carcinogenic phenotype [144], the same mechanism is active during Th17 cell differentiation. These data highlight Th17 cells as mediators or at least contributors in HIF-1-induced carcinogenesis.

### 4.6. BATF

BATF is a member of the AP-1 family that was found to have a critical role in Th17 cell differentiation program, acting through maintaining expression of ROR$\alpha$ and ROR$\gamma$t and ROR$\gamma$t target genes
by binding to *Il17, Il17f, Il21* and *Il22* promoters \[145,146\]. It was also found to regulate class-switch recombination in both B and T cells \[147\]. *Batf*⁻/⁻ mice had normal Th1 and Th2 responses but lack Th17 cells and revealed resistance to EAE induction \[146\].

### 4.7. Runx1

Parallel to the ability of Runx1 to bind to and induce RORγt during *Il17* transcription and thereby promote Th17 differentiation, it is also required by Foxp3 \[148\] and by T-bet \[149\] to inhibit Th17 differentiation. T-bet interacts with the Runx1, and this interaction blocked Runx1-mediated trans-activation of *RorC* promoter \[149\]. The authors found also that Runx1 reverses the inhibitory effect of T-bet on Th17 polarization and recalled thereby the assumption that master regulators (i.e. lineage-specific TFs) shape the immune responses by activating one genetic program while simultaneously silencing the activity of other competing regulators in a common progenitor cell.

### 4.8. NF-κB

Great evidence exists that activation of members of NF-κB signaling pathway is a hallmark of various inflammatory processes including induction of IL-17 response \[70,150\], and is also prevalent in carcinomas, where it is proposed to be mainly driven by the inflammatory response within the tumor microenvironment, and hence considered a link between inflammation and cancer development \[151,152\]. Two classical examples of inflammation-associated cancer are colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) that appears in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC; a chronic IBD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), caused by either HBV or HCV infection. Activating NF-κB augments cell proliferation \[153\], migration and invasion \[154\], and inhibits apoptosis \[155,156\], all are features of inflammation as well as tumorigenesis. On the other hand, the role NF-κB in tumorigenesis may be rather controversial, e.g. by acting as a pro- or anti-apoptotic as in case of glioblastoma \[157,158\]. Furthermore, studies infer the involvement of various members of NF-κB in various inflammatory processes, e.g. for production of IL-17 from innate and adaptive cells, as in γδ but not in αβ T cells the NF-κB family member RelB and LTβR are required for induction of RORγt, and RelA, RelB and LTβR for production of IL-17 \[150\]. The impaired IL-17 production by γδ T cells deficient in RelA or RelB resulted in a diminished innate immune response to *Escherichia coli* infection \[150\]. RelC is required for IL-21 gene expression in T and TFH cells through binding to *il21* pro-motor \[159\]. Also, IKKα, that is selectively associated with *Il17* locus and activates *Il17* \[160\] and IkBζ that binds directly to the regulatory region of *Il17* \[161\], are positive regulators of Th17 cells.

### 4.9. CREMα

It is a widely expressed transcriptional factor, its dysregulation is linked to inhibition of APC function via suppressing CD86 expression \[162\] as well as abnormal T cell function during the pathogenesis of SLE \[163,164\]. CREMα mediates silencing of the *il2* \[45,164\], likely through histone deacetylation and CpG-DNA methylation \[164\], and induces Th17 response by binding to and activating the *Il17* promoter \[45\]. It also mediates DNA alteration triggering IL-17 expression \[165\], and therefore amplifies autoimmune signs in Fas⁻/⁻ CREM transgenic mice including up-regulation of anti-DNA AA titers \[45\]. Interestingly, over-expression of CREMα in human T lymphocytes contributes to reduced IL-17F expression through binding to *Il17f* promoter, and because of the reduced proinflammatory potential of IL-17–IL-17F heterodimers relative to IL-17 homodimers, it is proposed that an increased IL-17/IL-17F ratio may be linked to an aggravated SLE

### phenotype \[163\]. An indirect induction of IL-17 response may be result by augmenting IL-6 production as evidenced in synovial cells \[166\].

#### 4.10. LXR

Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that are involved in cholesterol homeostasis. LXR is a negative regulator of Th17 differentiation. LXR mediates its effect via encoding of the TF Srebp-1 that binds to the E-box element on the *Il17* promoter, and additionally interferes with the AhR-controlled *Il17* transcription \[167\]. The authors found that ectopic expression of LXR repressed mouse Th17 differentiation and that LXR-deficiency promotes Th17 response in vitro and exacerbated EAE.

#### 4.11. TCF1

T cell factor-1 (TCF1) regulates differentiation and long-term maintenance of memory CD8⁺ cells \[168\] and represses IL-17 directly by binding to the regulatory region of *Il17* and thereby inhibiting its transcription \[169\]. However, this effect is restricted to earlier stages of T cell differentiation, as inferred by the failure to restore normal Th17 differentiation levels upon expression of TCF-1 in TCF1 deficient T cells \[170\]. Induction of IL-17 in TCF1⁻/⁻ T cells was accompanied by up-regulation of STAT3 and RORγt plus hyper-acetylation and trimethylation of Lys-4 at the IL-17 locus in TCF1⁻/⁻ thymocytes \[170\]. Moreover, TCF1⁻/⁻ Th17 CD4 T cells express higher levels of IL-7Rα, which potentially promotes their survival and in vivo expansion \[169\], and therefore, TCF1⁻/⁻ mice are hyper-responsive to EAE \[169,170\]. Another mechanism by which TCF1 represses Th17 is through its induction of Eomes, where TCF1 binds to the regulator region of *Eomes* \[168\]. Upon Wnt-signaling and β-catenin activation, the latter translocates into the nucleus and activates TCF1 by displacing TCF1-repressor \[171\], and TCF1 ultimately induces *Eomes* expression.

#### 4.12. PPARs

PPARs are orphan members of nuclear receptor TFs that exist in three isoforms (PPAR-α, -β/γ and -δ) and play key roles in the regulation of metabolism and inflammation. Many groups have shown that treatment with PPARs agonists such as PPARα agonists gemfibrozil, ciprofibrate, and fenofibrate \[172\], or PPARγ agonists \[173\] exerts anti-inflammatory effects and ameliorates autoimmune diseases including EAE; PPARγ functions as a heterodimeric with retinoid X receptor. Raikwar et al. \[174\] reported that damping EAE in C57BL/6 wild-type and PPARγ⁺/⁻ mice by PPARγ agonists could be antagonized by applying PPARγ antagonists such as Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, an effect that was associated with Th1 response. Klotz et al. \[175\] found, however, that PPARγ selectively suppressed Th17 but not Th1, Th2 or Treg cell differentiation, and that PPARγ induction is mTORC1-mediated, and probably acts through interfering with RORγt transcription. With this notion, it seems that ex-Th17 cells are the cell source of IFN-γ in the EAE setting \[10\], whose pathology is widely accepted to be dependent on Th17 cells. This would indicate the negative regulatory effect of PPARγ on Th17 cells. Recently, PPARδ⁻/⁻ mice found to develop elevated Th1/Th17 responses and prolonged EAE, with impaired Th2/Treg responses compared to WT mice \[176\]. More recently, applying PPARγ antagonist GW9662 reversed the inhibition of Th17 and promoted Tregs proliferation in lymphocytes incubated with eicosapentaenoic acid \[177\]. Collectively, these studies raise PPARs as negative regulators of the Th17 cell differentiation.
Fig. 2. Mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in differentiation and maturation program of DCs and T cell subsets. It determines differentiation of effector T (Teff) versus T regulatory (Treg) cells, differentiation and functions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as maturation and function of DCs. Deleting mTOR or manipulating mTORC1 or mTORC2 results in defective differentiation of T cells, see text for details.

### 4.13. Eomes

Cytolytic activities of T cells are known to be controlled by T-box TFs, T-bet und Eomes, via activation of perforin expression, up-regulation of FasL [178] and granzyme B [179]; both factors are essential for development of NK cells [180]. In memory Th2 cells, Eomes interacts with GATA3 preventing thereby its binding to the Il5 promoter [181], and together with T-bet mediates generation and induction of IFN-γ production in CD8+ cells [182–184]. The reciprocal regulation of IL-17 and CD8+ cell toxicity via Eomes-mediated granzyme B production is evident through the impact of IL-17 on RSV [185]. In Th17 cells, over-expression of Eomes suppressed cell differentiation by directly binding to the proximal region of RorC and Il17 promoters, and ablation of Eomes expression could substitute for TGF-β in inducing Th17 cell differentiation [89].

### 5. mTOR as an important signaling pathway in the Th17 commitment program

On antigen recognition and co-signaling, the downstream activation of the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a 289-kDa serine/threonine protein of PI3-kinase family member, induces translation of multiple proteins required for regulating metabolism, cell division, maturation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), differentiation of effector and regulatory CD4+ T cells, directing the generation of CD8+ effector versus memory cells as well as directing cells either to full activation or anergy [186–190]. Based on the current knowledge, mTOR represents a central divergent regulator of T cell differentiation. The mTOR pathway signals via two distinct complexes: mTORC1 (which contains the regulatory associated protein of TOR – Raptor) and mTORC2 (which contains the Rapamycin-insensitive companion of TOR – Rictor) [115], and is a positive regulator of Notch-signaling acting through induction of the STAT3/p63/Jagged signaling cascade [191]. Rapamycin, also called sirolimus, was originally used as an anti-fungal and subsequently as an immunosuppressive and anti-cancer agent, inhibits mTORC1 function by disrupting the mTOR-Raptor interaction. The conditional deletion of Rictor impaired differentiation into Th1, Th2 and Foxp3+ Tregs but did not substantially affect Th17 cell differentiation [192]. In line with this, it was found that differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells is selectively regulated by signaling through GTPase Rheb-dependent mTORC1. Rheb-deficient T cells can differentiate into Th2 but not into Th1 or Th17 and hence failed to induce EAE; alternatively, on deletion of mTORC2, T cells can generate Th1 and Th17 but not Th2 [187], see Fig. 2. Interleukin-17-induced proliferation of fibroblast-like synovial cells is mTOR dependent [193]. An indirect regulatory role of mTOR on Th17 was described by Gulen et al. [189] who found that SIGIRR, a negative regulator of IL-1R, regulates Th17 cell expansion and effector function through IL-1-induced mTOR signaling pathway. Interestingly, a vital role of mTOR in CXCL12-induced migration of human T cells [194] as well as of human metastatic gastric cancer [195] has been recently described. Given the inhibitory effect of the anti-cancer agent Rapamycin on mTORC1, which induces cell cycle arrest [196], together with the involvement of mTORC1 in the differentiation of Th17 cells may infer the pro-tumor potency of

Th17 response, an aspect that will be dealt with in a separate review.

That CD4⁺ T cells deficient in mTOR fail to differentiate into effector (Th1, Th2 and Th17) but rather into Treg cells [197,198], which was associated with decreased STAT activation and failure to up-regulate lineage-specific TFs [198]. This indicates that targeting mTOR offers a great therapeutic potential for induction of tolerance but also treatment of cancer. In this regard, the basal role of TGF-β signaling in driving differentiation of Tregs in the absence of mTOR activity was emphasized [198]. Accordingly, given the activation of naïve CD4⁺ T cells is metabolically demanding, it seems logic that effector differentiation cannot occur in the absence of mTOR activation. mTOR was also found to perform a key role in mediating T-bet up-regulation and the anabolic processes during generation of CD8⁺ effector T cells, whereas at absence or low mTOR activity, they shift to memory cells [186,199]. Also in DCs, mTOR activity is likely an important factor in their maturation and function, reviewed in [200]. Studies mostly using Rapamycin revealed that mTORC1 is a key but rather not the sole actor in modulating maturation as well as activity of DCs (see Fig. 2); this varies however according to DC types and their maturation state. Activating mTOR induces DC capacity to stimulate CD4⁺ T cells, but limits the pro-inflammatory capacity of mature DCs via up-regulation of IL-10 and down-regulation of IL-12 production. A further link to the act of mTOR in CD4⁺ T cell differentiation is the transcriptional silencer T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) that exerts a dampening effect upon Th2 and Th17, but not Th1 [201]. The authors delivered their message that TIA-1⁻/⁻ lymph node cells and splenocytes transcribed and released more Th2/Th17 cytokines, an effect that requires inactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway [202].

IL-10 by Th17 themselves seems as a self regulatory mechanism that abrogates their pathogenicity [7].

A third cytokine of anti-inflammatory property is IL-27, a natural antagonist of Th17 development [208], that was recently found to act through induction of STAT1 and inhibition of SOCS protein 1 [209]. Interestingly, Kamiya et al. [210] revealed that IL-27 inhibits the primary expression of the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in naïve CD4⁺ T cells mediated by targeting STAT3, however, less efficiently in differentiated Th17 cells. In addition to this effect, IL-27 suppresses the responses of osteoclast precursors to RANKL and therefore plays a homeostatic role in restraining bone erosion; an effect that is compromised under conditions of chronic inflammation such as in rheumatoid arthritis synovitis [211], a finding that may be explained by an IL-17-mediated reciprocal regulation mechanism, where a single-chain human IL-27 inhibited xenogenic mouse Th17 cell differentiation in vitro and reflected its therapeutic efficacy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced mouse colitis even after active colitis [212].

### 7. Concluding remarks

Although the precise role of Th17 and their related molecules in various disease settings, e.g. in the context of mediating antimicrobial mechanisms as well as pro- or anti-tumor events remains elusive, there is no doubt about implication of Th17 cells as major players in inducing chronic inflammation and in initiation/induction of many autoimmune diseases. Therefore, various research directions gave more attention in the last years to identify molecules involved in the differentiation program of these cells to help attain and evaluate current therapeutic strategies. An important result has been the identification of heterogenic Th17 cell subtypes as well as the disclosure of T cell plasticity – a normal trait of Th17 cells that enable them to acquire pathogenicity mediated by further cytokine signaling (e.g. by IL-23) or contact with APC in presensitized or naïve CD4⁺ T cells, respectively.

The selective dependence of Th17 differentiation on certain molecules in their commitment programming such as IL-23 [213], HIF1α- [139], AhR [214] or mTOR [188], amongst others, suggests targeting these mediators to manipulate Th17 differentiation to combat their deleterious effects in the context of chronic inflammation and cancer. However, the heterogeneity and the intricate plasticity of these cells and the involvement of multiple players in their commitment program add to the complexities of current strategies. This highlights the need to further dissect the fine-tuning of the ultimate cell fate, particularly in vivo, in association with beneficial or pathogenic events in various disease contexts upon targeting various alternative developmental pathways simultaneously. Aiming at induction of tolerance via promoting naïve T cells anergy, for example by modifying certain TFs involved in the Th17/Treg regulation program and DCs’ function competence, inhibitors of mTOR and NF-κB are considered in therapeutic regimens to abrogate hyperactive inflammatory responses to minimize transplant rejections and combat chronic inflammations and autoimmune disorders but also in cancer. In addition, due to the dependence of Th17 response on commensal bacteria [215], manipulating them may elicit immune induction and be valuable for enhancing mucosal responses and treating autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, specific targeting of Th17 cells may be quite promising for developing therapeutic perspectives by applying immuno-suppressants such as cyclosporine A [216], anti-IL-17 (Secukinomab) therapy or IL-17R blockade [213,217], by manipulating the IDO-competent DCs-activated T cell interaction in lymphoid tissues [54], through dietary measures to inhibit IL-17⁺ T cells by applying RA [59] or plant extracts [218,219]. However, the risk of induction of cancer and vulnerability of

### 6. Though on guard, Th17 response are kept under control

Like other immune arms, Th17 cells are subjected to control of regulatory mechanisms. Various cytokines and TFs are implicated in inhibition of Th17 cells. These include IL-2 that modulates expression of cytokine receptors and TFs associated with various Th cell types [203]. Signaling through STAT5, IL-2 regulates the competition between STAT5 and STAT3 for binding to Il17 promoter [44,204]. Therefore, deleting STAT3-encoding gene in T cells abrogated production of IL-17 and attenuated autoimmunity elicited by IL-2-deficiency [44]. IL-2 acts also through repressing expression of both IL-6 receptor α-chain (encoded by Il6ra) and gp130 (encoded by Il6st), but also likely through receptor-independent mechanism [205]. Although, the expression of both IL-6 receptor subunits was augmented in Il2⁻/⁻ T cells and accompanied by higher IL-17RA expression, retroviral transduction of Il6st, but not of Il6ra, enhanced Th17 expression inferring that the amount of gp130 is the limiting factor [205]. However, finding that IL-2 inhibited Th17 differentiation even upon constitutive expression of Il6st indicates existence of IL-6R-independent pathway. Moreover, IL-2 together with IL-10 were found to induce Foxp3 expression in Th17 cells and induce Tregs [206]. Therefore, introduction of the TGF-β transgene into T cells of IL-2⁻/⁻ mice led to the induction of distinct CD25⁻Foxp3⁺ Tregs in the periphery that efficiently down-regulated T cell proliferation and rescued mice from lethal autoimmunity [207]. IL-2 induces Th1 differentiation through STAT5-mediated up-regulation of IL-12Rβ2 and T-bet expression [205]. Together with TGF-β, that is, as previously mentioned, a key regulator arm of Tregs that reciprocally regulate Th17 cells, IL-10 is the second cytokine in this concert that regulates such IL-10R-expression cells mediated by APC and Tregs [42,43]. T cell specific deletion or blockade of IL-10 or IL-10R led to selective increase of Th17 and Th17/Th1 responses during intestinal inflammation [42] or in ex vivo cultures [43]. In addition, production of
attacking infections should remain on focus, and this can be managed through prophylactic measures whilst targeting Th17 response.
