## ABSTRACT

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptides (PACAPs) share 68% identity at the amino acid level and belong to the secretin peptide family. Following the initial discovery of VIP almost four decades ago a substantial amount of knowledge has been presented describing the mechanisms of action, distribution and pleiotropic functions of these related peptides. It is now known that the physiological actions of these widely distributed peptides are produced through activation of three common G-protein coupled receptors (VPAC ${ }_{1}$, VPAC ${ }_{2}$ and PAC ${ }_{1} \mathrm{R}$ ) which preferentially stimulate adenylate cyclase and increase intracellular cAMP, although stimulation of other intracellular messengers, including calcium and phospholipase D, has been reported. Using a range of in vitro and in vivo approaches, including cell-based functional assays, transgenic animals and rodent models of disease, VPAC/PAC receptor activation has been associated with numerous physiological processes (e.g. control of circadian rhythms) and clinical conditions (e.g. pulmonary hypertension), which underlies on-going research efforts and makes these peptides and their cognate receptors attractive targets for the pharmaceutical industry. However, despite the considerable interest in VPAC/PAC receptors and the processes which they mediate, there is still a paucity of selective and available, non-peptide ligands, which has hindered further advances in this field both at the basic research and clinical level. This review summarises the current knowledge of VIP/PACAP and the VPAC/PAC receptors with regard to their distribution, pharmacology, signalling pathways, splice variants and finally, the utility of animal models in exploring their physiological roles.

1. VIP and PACAP

### 1.1. Isolation and characterisation of VIP

The isolation and purification of ‘vasoactive intestinal peptide’ (VIP) was reported almost 40 years ago by Said and Mutt (1970), who were investigating the high incidence of systemic hypotension in patients with severe lung injuries. Whilst trying to identify the vasoactive substance responsible for reducing blood pressure, a 28 amino acid (aa) vasoactive peptide (VIP) was isolated from pig small intestine, an organ which originates from the same embryonic bud as the lungs. Initial experiments showed the peptide had a diverse range of effects that included: increased vasodilatation and reduced arterial blood pressure (Said & Mutt, 1970), smooth muscle relaxation in respiratory and intestinal tissues (Piper et al., 1970), and stimulation of electrolyte secretion in the gut (Barbezat & Grossman, 1971). Details clarifying the mechanisms through which VIP mediated these diverse actions started to emerge a few years later and were reported to be primarily dependent upon the stimulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) and the resultant production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The first definitive link between VIP and AC stimulation was reported in 1973, with the peptide shown to increase enzyme activity in liver tissue (Desbuguois et al., 1973). During this period it was also reported that patients with tumours expressing high concentrations of VIP or with elevated plasma VIP also suffered with diarrhoea (Bloom et al., 1973; Said & Faloon, 1975). The secretory effects of VIP on the gut were likened to that of cholera endotoxin (thought to stimulate AC) and were ultimately proven to occur through stimulation of AC and cAMP (Schwartz et al., 1974; Swift et al., 1975). Since these early studies, many subsequent investigations have verified that the biological effects of VIP are generally associated with increased AC activity and cAMP concentrations.

As a consequence of VIP being isolated from the gut and its effect on electrolyte secretion, it was initially classified as a gut hormone. However, more extensive immunohistochemical and radioimmunoassays have since shown this peptide to have a much more widespread distribution, with a predominantly neuronal localisation shown throughout the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems in a variety of species (Larsson et al., 1976a,b). This led to the suggestion that VIP may also have a role as a neurotransmitter, in addition to being a gut hormone, with findings from many studies in the last 30 years supporting this assertion (Bryant et al., 1976; Duckles & Said, 1982; Fahrenkrug & Hannibal, 2004; Van Geldre & Lefebvre, 2004).

### 1.2. Cloning and processing of the VIP gene

It was a further 15 years before the human (h) VIP gene was cloned in 1985, after which it was subsequently mapped to chromosome 6, region q25 [Fig. 1; Entrez GeneID: 7432; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov] (Tsukada et al., 1985; Gozes et al., 1987). Some six years later the rat (r) and mouse VIP genes were both cloned and found to be localised to chromosomes 1p11 [Entrez GeneID: 117064] and 10A1 [Entrez GeneID: 22353] respectively (Fig. 1; Lamperti et al., 1991). Translation of the mRNA sequence produced from human VIP gene transcription yields a 170 aa precursor named prepro-VIP. Post-translational processing of the precursor yields the 28 aa peptide VIP, in addition to the 27 aa peptide histidine methionine (PHM) in humans, or peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) in rodents (Fig. 1; Itoh et al., 1983). Two alternatively processed forms of the latter peptide have been identified, namely peptide histidine valine (PHV-42) and PHI-GLY (Yiangou et al., 1986; Cauvin et al., 1990b). The peptides VIP and PHM/PHI are located on two adjacent exons and share 48% aa sequence identity (Tatemoto & Mutt, 1981; Bodner et al., 1985).

The rate of transcription of the VIP gene is regulated by many factors. One of the first reported VIP gene regulators was cAMP, which acts via a 17 base pair cAMP response element (CRE) in the VIP gene sequence (Hayakawa et al., 1984; Ohsawa et al., 1985; Tsukada et al., 1987). Transcription of the VIP gene has also been shown to be enhanced by protein kinase C activation, an effect which may partly be mediated by CRE, although this been debated (Ohsawa et al., 1985; Hahm & Eiden, 1996). In addition, the VIP gene was reported to contain a 180 base pair cytokine-responsive region, which is sensitive to factors such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor (Symes et al., 1994). G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) can also alter VIP gene expression, with the cholinergic agonist carbachol increasing VIP mRNA expression in neuroblastoma cell lines via M₁, M₃ or M₅ muscarinic receptors (Kristensen et al., 1997). Furthermore, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) increased the rate of VIP gene transcription in NB-OK-1 cells, rapidly increasing intracellular VIP concentrations in a reportedly cAMP independent manner (Georg & Fahrenkrug, 2000). Indeed, Adler and Fink (1993) showed that the VIP mRNA levels in SHSY-5Y cells were increased by calcium and cAMP independently, with only the calcium mediated pathway involving new protein synthesis.

### 1.3. Isolation and characterisation of PACAP

Whilst attempting to isolate ovine hypothalamic hypophysiotropic hormones capable of stimulating AC, Arimura and colleagues discovered a novel 38 aa peptide, which potently activated AC in ovine pituitary extracts and in equivalent rat tissue (Miyata et al., 1989). As a consequence, this peptide was named PACAP-38 (Miyata et al., 1989). Less than a year later a second peptide, produced as a side product of PACAP-38 purification, was also shown to potently stimulate AC (EC₅₀ for both: 0.3 nM), with a comparable maximal response (Miyata et al., 1990). Following sequence analysis, this second peptide was demonstrated to be a C-terminally truncated form of PACAP-38 that was 27 aa in length and was aptly named PACAP-27. The PACAP peptides were suggested to be related to VIP as a result of the high level of aa homology (68%; Table 1; Miyata et al., 1990). In the initial in vitro studies which directly compared the three peptides in cultured rat pituitary cells, both PACAP peptides were found to be 1000 times more potent than VIP in their ability to activate AC (Miyata et al., 1990).

### 1.4. The PACAP gene

The human PACAP gene was finally cloned in 1992 and mapped to the p11 region of chromosome 18 [Fig. 1; Entrez GeneID: 116] (Hosoya et al., 1992). Subsequently the rat PACAP gene has been mapped to 9q37 [Entrez GeneID: 24166], with the mouse gene also cloned and mapped to chromosome 17 [Entrez GeneID: 11516] (Fig. 1; Cai et al., 1995; Okazaki et al., 1995; Yamamoto et al., 1998).

Transcription of the human PACAP gene and subsequent translation of the mRNA product yields a 176 aa precursor called prepro-PACAP (Hosoya et al., 1992). This precursor is cleaved and modified (Fig. 1) to produce PACAP-27 and PACAP-38, as well as a third PACAP-related peptide (PRP; 29 aa) which shares just over 20% homology with the PACAP peptides (Okazaki et al., 1992). The PACAP and VIP precursor peptides are relatively similar in terms of general structure and processing, which is shown in Fig. 1 (Vaudry et al., 2000). As for VIP, multiple factors are known to stimulate PACAP gene expression, including PACAP-38, phorbol esters and cAMP analogues (Suzuki et al., 1994; Yamamoto et al., 1998).

### 1.5. VIP and PACAP distribution in the CNS and periphery

Since their discovery and isolation, many studies have investigated the distribution of VIP and PACAP in a variety of species. In general, these peptides are found throughout the body, including in the brain and in nerves innervating peripheral organs, as well as in non-
neuronal cells and tissues in the periphery. There is a generally distinct pattern of distribution for VIP and PACAP in the CNS, however the peptides appear to be more co-localised in the periphery (Fahrenkrug & Hannibal, 2004). The distribution of the peptides shall be discussed here in brief, however detailed reviews can be found elsewhere (Arimura et al., 1991; Masuo et al., 1993; Vaudry et al., 2000; Fahrenkrug & Hannibal, 2004).

In the CNS, VIP and PACAP are generally found in different layers or cells of particular structures, with few reports describing any co-localisation (Fahrenkrug & Hannibal, 2004). VIP is widely distributed throughout the brain, with considerable expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and hypothalamus (Koves et al., 1991; Mikkelsen & Fahrenkrug, 1994; Acsady et al., 1996; Fahrenkrug & Hannibal, 2004). The majority of reports examining PACAP expression in the CNS have focused on PACAP-38, as this is the predominant form found in the brain, with some studies suggesting that PACAP-27 accounts for only 10% of total brain PACAP content (Arimura et al., 1991). In the CNS, the highest levels of PACAP-38 expression have been shown to occur in the hypothalamus, particularly in the paraventricular and periventricular nuclei and the SCN (Arimura et al., 1991; Masuo et al., 1993). Other brain areas in which PACAP-38 is clearly expressed include multiple brainstem nuclei, the arcuate nucleus, the amygdala, thalamic nuclei, the cerebral cortex, the medulla oblongata and the posterior pituitary (Arimura et al., 1991; Ghatei et al., 1993; Masuo et al., 1993; Fukuhara et al., 1997). Although PACAP expression in neurons has been well documented, the peptide is also expressed in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes (Jaworski, 2000). Finally, both VIP and PACAP have also been localised to nerve fibres that innervate cerebral blood vessels (Miao & Lee, 1990; Uddman et al., 1993). It should be noted that whilst many studies have detailed the neuroanatomical distribution of VIP/PACAP in the CNS of several species, in depth studies for the mouse, for which VIP/PACAP transgenic models are available (Section 3), remain relatively scarce.

Co-expression of the VIP and PACAP peptides has been well documented for many peripheral tissues, although it is not always clear from these studies whether the peptides are found within the innervating nerves or within non-neuronal cells of particular organs. However, both peptides are expressed throughout the digestive and genito-urinary tracts, as well as in multiple exocrine glands (Ghatei et al., 1993; Werkstrom et al., 1998; Vaudry et al., 2000). As was found for brain tissue, PACAP-38 is the predominant form of PACAP expressed in peripheral tissues and organs (Arimura et al., 1991). A

particularly high expression of PACAP-38 was detected in germ cells of rat testis, with the total amount of PACAP-38 greater than that found in the entire rat brain (Arimura et al., 1991).

In contrast to the distinct localisation of VIP and PACAP in the CNS, their distribution is very similar in cells and tissues of the immune system. Both VIP and PACAP have been detected in the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes (Gaytan et al., 1994; Leceta et al., 1994; Abad et al., 2002). In addition, VIP and PACAP expression has been detected in lymphocytes and thymocytes (Delgado et al., 1996b; Gomariz et al., 2001; Abad et al., 2002). However, in agreement with the general distribution of these peptides in the body, PACAP-38 was again reported to be the predominant form of PACAP expressed in the immune system (Gaytan et al., 1994).

### 1.6. Conservation of VIP and PACAP

The sequences of VIP and the PACAP peptides are highly conserved across species. The VIP aa sequence is identical in humans (Bunnett et al., 1984), cows (Carlquist et al., 1979), rats (Dimaline et al., 1984), goats (Eng et al., 1986), rabbits (Gossen et al., 1990), pigs (Mutt & Said, 1974) and dogs (Wang et al., 1985). Both guinea pig and chicken VIP deviate from the conserved sequence by four aa (Du et al., 1985; McFarlin et al., 1995). The PACAPs are similar to VIP, with their aa sequences identical in humans (Kimura et al., 1990), sheep (Miyata et al., 1989, 1990), rats (Ogi et al., 1990) and mice (Okazaki et al., 1995), with the chicken (McRory et al., 1997) and frog (Chartrel et al., 1991) sequences differing by only a single aa residue. Interestingly, PACAP has also been identified in a group of ancient protochordates—the tunicates or sea squirts (a group that is suggested to have given rise to the vertebrates), and has been shown to differ by only one aa when compared to the human form, suggesting a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the PACAP sequence (McRory & Sherwood, 1997). The finding that PACAP has been so well conserved over 700 million years of evolution, has led to the suggestion that it is the ‘most likely ancestral molecule for the superfamily’ to which it belongs (Sherwood et al., 2000); this superfamily of peptides is discussed in the following section.

### 1.7. The VIP/PACAP peptide family

Due to the degree of sequence similarity with peptides such as secretin and glucagon, VIP and the PACAP peptides have been classed as members of the secretin peptide family, named after the

first member discovered (Bayliss & Starling, 1902). As shown for VIP and PACAP (Fig. 1), the precursor peptides of this family characteristically have a signal peptide, 1–3 bioactive peptides and both N- and C-terminal peptides (Sherwood et al., 2000). The superfamily contains mature, linear peptides of between ~25–50 aa in length (Table 1). In addition to considerable sequence homology, the majority of peptides in this family also share certain primary (C-terminal amide) and secondary structural similarities, with disordered random coil structures at the N-termini and extended α-helical regions at the C-termini (Clore et al., 1986; Gronenborn et al., 1987; Theriault et al., 1991; Wray et al., 1998). For example, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) derived structure of PACAP-27 published by Inooka et al. (2001), was shown to contain a disordered N-terminal sequence (residues: 1–4) and an adjoining C-terminal α-helix (residues: 5–27). The structure of VIP, as determined by NMR, also contains an N-terminal disordered region (residues: 1–6) and an α-helix (residues: 7–24), with the remaining residues in the C-terminal region appearing to form a helical shape (Tan et al., 2006). There is evidence suggesting that both the N- and C-terminal regions are important for the biological activity of the peptides and for specific receptor recognition (Onoue et al., 2001, 2004). For PACAP-27, the C-terminal region has been shown to be important for receptor binding, whilst the N-terminal region may influence ligand efficacy as truncated PACAPs such as PACAP(6–27), are competitive antagonists of PACAP receptors (Gourlet et al., 1991; Robberecht et al., 1992). It has also been proposed that a hydrophobic β-coil may form in the N-terminal region (for which His¹, Phe⁶ and Thr⁷ may be involved) and that this structure may be important for receptor binding affinity (Inooka et al., 2001). The peptides in this family have wide ranging functions, with the majority of these physiological actions mediated by GPCRs (vide infra).

### 2. VIP and PACAP receptors

#### 2.1. VIP and PACAP interactions with G-proteins

Prior to cloning, VIP and PACAP receptors were postulated to stimulate AC by interacting with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins (G-proteins), with GTP, Gpp(nH)p and guanosine diphosphate all shown to inhibit iodinated VIP binding to rat prostate and liver membranes (Ramirez-Cardenas et al., 1981; Carmena & Prieto, 1985). In addition, Couvineau et al. (1986) isolated a soluble VIP receptor complex from rat liver membranes that was associated with a GTP regulatory protein. From studies using cholera toxin to induce [³²P]ADP ribosylation in the membrane preparations, these authors suggested that the G-protein associated with the VIP receptors was Gαₛ (Couvineau et al., 1986). At the same time and facilitated by protein isolation and the development of specific antisera, detailed studies emerged regarding the control of AC activity by guanine nucleotides (Mumby et al., 1986). Subsequently in 1992, Kermode and colleagues used cross-linking studies and antisera for different G-protein subunits to show a direct physical interaction between VIP, VIP receptors and Gαₛ subunits, with it now well established that VIP and PACAP interact with GPCRs to stimulate intracellular signalling cascades.

#### 2.2. GPCR families

GPCRs are heptahelical membrane proteins that have been described as the ‘most important set of targets for research aimed at the design of new medicines’ (Horn et al., 1998), and account for 30–45% of modern drug targets (Drews, 2000; Hopkins & Groom, 2002). The human genome has been estimated to contain ~950 GPCRs (Takeda et al., 2002), which is approximately 5% of the total estimated protein encoding gene repertoire (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004; http://ensembl.lcb.uu.se:8080/Homo_sapiens/). 7-TM receptors are generally assigned into one of 5–6 families (depending on the classification system) based on protein sequence similarities, with members of each family generally sharing over 25% sequence identity in the 7-TM region (Fredriksson et al., 2003b; Jacoby et al., 2006). The three main GPCR families (A, B and C) encompass the mammalian GPCRs, with the other smaller families generally considered to contain pheromone and cAMP receptors found only in fungi and moulds (Gether, 2000; Harmar, 2001; Fredriksson et al., 2003b). Group A or the ‘rhodopsin receptor family’ includes amine, chemokine and purinergic receptors amongst its members (Foord et al., 2005) and is the largest GPCR superfamily, with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) receptor database currently incorporating ~270 members (http://www.iuphar-db.org). The smaller group B or ‘secretin receptor family’ predominantly consists of peptide hormone and neuropeptide receptors such as the secretin, calcitonin, VIP and PACAP receptors, with ~55 members of this group currently recognised by IUPHAR. The group C family is the ‘metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) family’ which in addition to mGluR, contains GABA_B, calcium-sensing receptors and some taste receptors amongst its members. There are ~25 members of the group C family in the IUPHAR database, with all members having distinct, long N-terminal domains of approximately 500–600 aa (Takahashi et al., 1993). Another group of mammalian GPCRs is the small ‘frizzled’ receptor family, of which 11 members are currently listed in the IUPHAR database. These receptors bind ‘Wnt’ secreted glycoprotein ligands and are most closely related to the group B family, as a result of certain sequence similarities shared between the groups (Barnes et al., 1998; Harmar, 2001). As VIP/PACAP receptors are members of the group B GPCR family, the following section focuses on this sub-family, however for excellent general reviews of GPCRs please see Gether (2000), Pierce et al. (2002), Kristiansen (2004) and Fredholm et al. (2007).

#### 2.3. The group B GPCR family

The GPCR for the brain/gut peptide secretin was cloned in 1991 and subsequent sequence analysis found little homology to any of the previously identified GPCRs (Ishihara et al., 1991). Hence, the secretin receptor became the first member of a new GPCR family, later designated as group B. Many members of this family are activated by

peptides and have the same general structural features described in the preceding section, with ~30% homology within the 7-TM region (McKnight & Gordon, 1998; Stacey et al., 2000). The majority of group B receptors have an N-terminal domain of >120 residues which contains a hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide and the putative ‘hormone binding domain’ which contains numerous conserved aa, including several cysteine residues (Harmar, 2001; Laburthe & Couvineau, 2002). The receptors' N-termini alone are not sufficient for ligand binding with the binding domain appearing discontinuous, with contact points also on the EC loops (Lins et al., 2001; Unson, 2002). The group B GPCRs have been further categorised into three sub-families: B1, B2 and B3 (Harmar, 2001). The ‘B1’ sub-family contains the classical peptide hormone receptors such as those for glucagon-like peptide (GLP), VIP, PACAP and growth-hormone-releasing factor (GRF), i.e. the secretin family of peptides described earlier. All receptors in this subfamily signal through Ga$_s$-AC to increase cAMP, although coupling to additional pathways, including calcium signalling, has been reported (Aiyar et al., 1999; McCulloch et al., 2002; Dickson et al., 2006a). The ‘B2’ sub-family is the largest of the group and encompasses several sets of receptors, including the orphan receptors described as LN-TM7 (Zendman et al., 1999) or LNB-TM7 (Stacey et al., 2000). The members of this group have very long N-terminal domains, which can be up to 2000–3000 residues in length (Fredriksson et al., 2003a) and a 7-TM region which shows considerable homology to other group B receptors. Additional characteristics of receptors in the B2 family include a region composed of ~20% SER/THR residues and a CYS-box, both of which are found on the EC terminal just prior to the first TM domain (Stacey et al., 2000). The B2 family also includes the EGF-TM7 group, found almost exclusively on immune cells, with distinct long N-terminal domains that contain variable numbers of tandemly repeated endothelial growth factor (EGF) domains (McKnight & Gordon, 1998; Kwakkenbos et al., 2004). Despite showing significant homology to other group B GPCRs in the 7-TM region, evidence for G-protein coupling and transduction mechanisms for B2 receptors is scarce, with only four members reported to couple to specific G-proteins (Lelianova et al., 1997; Foord et al., 2002). The third sub-family is the ‘B3’ or ‘Methuselah-like’ GPCRs, aptly named after the P-element insertion gene mutation in drosophila which generates mutant 7-TM receptors associated with extended life-span (Lin et al., 1998). Methuselah receptors have some homology to the other group B receptors in the 7-TM region, however they do not have a SER/THR rich region or CYS-box (Stacey et al., 2000).

In the last few years a generally accepted model of ligand binding and receptor activation of group B GPCRs has emerged. This model proposes that the C-terminus of the activating peptide binds to the long EC N-terminal domain of the receptor, after which the N-terminus of the ligand docks to the body of the receptor (transmembrane regions and intervening loops), causing a conformational change that allows intracellular loops to trigger signal transduction cascades (Laburthe & Couvineau, 2002; Hoare, 2005). However, an interesting alternative model has been proposed by Dong and colleagues (Dong et al., 2006), who suggested that the hormone (secretin in this case) may expose a hidden, built-in agonist epitope in the amino-terminus of the GPCR which interacts with specific regions in the body of the receptor (TM6 for secretin) to cause activation. However, it remains to be seen whether this mechanism will apply to other members of the group B GPCR family.

(Christophe et al., 1976; Robberecht et al., 1976), rat brain and liver membranes (Taylor & Pert, 1979; Guerrero et al., 1981b), neonatal astrocytes (Magistretti et al., 1983), multiple areas of the adult rat CNS (Staun-Olsen et al., 1985), human lymphocytes (Guerrero et al., 1981a; O'Dorisio et al., 1981), lymphoblasts (Beed et al., 1983) and gallbladder and colonic epithelial cells (Broyart et al., 1981; Dupont et al., 1981). ‘VIP receptors’ were also identified in various human carcinoma cell lines, including those derived from gut (Laburthe et al., 1978), cervical (Prieto et al., 1981), lung (Laburthe et al., 1981), breast (Gespach et al., 1988) and pancreatic tissues (Estival et al., 1983). During the same period many autoradiographic studies were published, in which iodinated VIP was used to identify the anatomical distribution of non-specific VIP receptors in a variety of central and peripheral tissues, from a range of species (Besson et al., 1984; Farmery et al., 1984; Leroux et al., 1984; Carstairs & Barnes, 1986; Shaffer & Moody, 1986; Power et al., 1988). The specific distribution of each receptor subtype shall be discussed further in Section 2.9.

The VIP receptors characterised in these tissues using VIP and the VIP-like peptides available at that time, showed variations in pharmacology, due in part, to the presence of multiple receptors and because of the lack of suitable ligands. It was not until ligands were identified which appeared to discriminate between receptors, that distinct subtypes of VIP receptors could be clearly defined and characterised. In 1982, Raufman and colleagues identified a bioactive peptide from the venom of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) that was able to stimulate AC and cAMP in guinea-pig acinar cells, in a manner similar to VIP and secretin; hence the action of the venom was attributed to secretin/VIP receptor activation (Raufman et al., 1982). In further studies on intestinal epithelial cells (which are devoid of secretin receptors), new data indicated that the action of the venom was specific for VIP receptors and that it had a similar affinity and potency at both rat and human receptors (Amiranoff et al., 1983). These studies distinguished the pharmacology of this ligand from other VIP like peptides, such as PHI and secretin, which differed in their affinity and potency for the VIP receptors of the two species (Laburthe et al., 1983). The active peptide in the venom, helodermin, was subsequently isolated and purified (Vandermeers et al., 1984), leading to an extensive analysis of its properties and the demonstration of many VIP-like physiological effects (Blank et al., 1986; Naruse et al., 1986; Koshiyama et al., 1987). However, differences in the peptides’ properties began to emerge in terms of potency/binding characteristics, with a study by Robberecht et al. (1984) clearly showing that helodermin, VIP and secretin differed in their ability to stimulate cAMP production in membranes from several rat and human organs. These researchers tentatively suggested that the distinct actions of helodermin (from both secretin and VIP) may be a consequence of activating specific helodermin receptors (Robberecht et al., 1984). Four years later, the same group used iodinated helodermin and human T-cell lymphoma SUP-T1 cells, to provide further evidence for a single population of helodermin-prefering VIP receptors (Robberecht et al., 1988). In this study, the rank order of potency (ROP) of the various VIP-like peptides examined was distinct from all other VIP receptors previously described, with helodermin having a higher affinity (~6 fold) than VIP in radioligand binding studies. In parallel cAMP studies, the same ROP was produced, with helodermin being ~3 fold more potent than VIP (Robberecht et al., 1988). Around the same time, Turner and colleagues (1986) reported that rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells produce an N-terminally truncated VIP fragment, VIP(10–28), that was functionally distinct from normal VIP (Turner et al., 1986). This peptide was shown to inhibit VIP binding and VIP induced AC activity in HT-29 cells, whilst having no effect alone on AC activity and it was therefore suggested to be a VIP receptor antagonist. More interestingly, this peptide had no affinity for, or effect on, agonist stimulated responses from VIP receptors in SUP-T1 cells (Robberecht et al., 1989), again suggesting a degree of diversity in the VIP receptor population.

2.4. VIP and PACAP receptor classification

Initial pharmacological studies characterising putative VIP receptors generally involved either cAMP or radioligand binding assays (using iodinated VIP), with these approaches available long before modern advances in molecular biological techniques, such as receptor cloning. These studies identified generic ‘VIP receptors’ in a variety of tissues and cell types, including guinea pig pancreatic acinar cells
The gradual accumulation of pharmacological evidence leading to the eventual acceptance of distinct VIP receptors contrasted with the rapid identification of a selective PACAP receptor following the isolation of PACAP-27 and PACAP-38. Immediately after the isolation of both peptides (Miyata et al., 1989, 1990), high affinity selective PACAP receptors were identified in the rat AR4-2 J pancreatic cancer acinar cell line (Buscail et al., 1990). Initially, PACAP was tested in this cell line as it expressed VIP receptors, and because of the sequence similarities between the peptides, it was suggested that PACAP may interact with VIP receptors (Svoboda et al., 1988; Buscail et al., 1990). However, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 were shown to have an equally high affinity for PACAP binding sites in these cells, with both VIP and helodermin being of much lower (~1000 fold) affinity (Buscail et al., 1990). Similarly, these studies also showed that the PACAPs potently stimulated AC ($EC_{50}$: 0.2 nM for both peptides) in AR4-2 J cells, with VIP and helodermin again being much less potent. In contrast to PACAP-27 and PACAP-38, VIP and helodermin actually appeared to be partial agonists in the AC assay (Buscail et al., 1990). In the same year, similar high affinity PACAP-prefering binding sites were also identified in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes (Tatsuno et al., 1990), bovine brain membranes (Ohtaki et al., 1990), rat hypothalamus, brain stem, cerebellum and lung membranes (Lam et al., 1990) and in the NB-OK-1 human neuroblastoma cell line (Cauvin et al., 1990a).

Around this time, data from many studies using a combination of VIP, PACAP-27, PACAP-38 and helodermin amongst others (e.g. secretin and PHI) began to identify differences in pharmacology, clearly distinguishing distinct receptor subtypes. For example, PACAP and helodermin were found to bind with equal affinity to the VIP-helodermin preferring receptors in SUP-T1 cells (Gourlet et al., 1991). Autoradiography studies using numerous rat tissues clearly identified two PACAP binding sites, one of which was PACAP preferring, whereas VIP and PACAP had equal affinity for the second site (Shivers et al., 1991). PACAP and VIP also bound equally well to receptors in jejunal epithelial plasma membranes, with helodermin being less potent (Salomon et al., 1993). The emerging pattern suggested there were two classes of VIP receptors, both of which PACAP bound to with high affinity, however the two subtypes could be distinguished by examining the potency of other ligands, including helodermin. In addition, a third receptor class was more easily recognisable by its clear preference for PACAP compared to VIP. These three receptor subtypes were later classified by IUPHAR into ‘VPAC receptors’ for VIP and PACAP, and ‘PAC₁ receptors’ which were the PACAP-prefering subtype (Harmar et al., 1998). The VPAC receptors were divided further into VPAC₁R and VPAC₂R subtypes, based upon helodermin binding/potency (VPAC₂R being helodermin preferring).

### 2.5. Cloning of VPAC/PAC receptors

The VPAC₁R was initially cloned from a rat lung cDNA library by Ishihara and colleagues in 1991, the human homologue was then cloned from the HT-29 colon carcinoma cell line (Sreedharan et al., 1993) and finally, the mouse sequence was cloned from mouse lymphoid cells in 1996 (Johnson et al., 1996). When examined in stably transfected cell lines, the general agonist ROP for this receptor subtype (in cAMP studies) is VIP=PACAP-27=PACAP-38=PHM>secretin, with $EC_{50}$ values for the first four agonists being approximately 0.01–0.1 nM (Ishihara et al., 1992; Sreedharan et al., 1993; Dickson et al., 2006a,b). A small number of studies have examined endogenous VPAC₁R function in HT-29 cells and have also shown VIP and the PACAP peptides to be equipotent with low nanomolar potency in cAMP assays and with secretin again being considerably less potent (Laburthe et al., 1978; Mangeat et al., 1981; Lelievre et al., 1998; Summers et al., 2003). Additional human cell lines in which endogenous VPAC₁R function has been studied include the LoVo (colon adenocarcinoma: Yu et al., 1992; Gourlet et al., 1997a) and HeLa (cervical carcinoma: Laburthe et al., 1980; Prieto et al., 1981) cell lines.

The VPAC₂R was first cloned by Lutz and co-workers from a rat pituitary cDNA library (Lutz et al., 1993). This was quickly followed by a report describing the cloning of the human receptor from SUP-T1 cells (Svoboda et al., 1994) and then the mouse transcript from MIN-6 insulin secreting β-cells (Inagaki et al., 1994). When expressed in COS-7 and CHO cells, the general ROP for the VPAC₂R in cAMP studies is VIP=PACAP-27=PACAP-38=helodermin>PHI/PHM, with very little response to secretin observed even at micromolar concentrations (Lutz et al., 1993; Inagaki et al., 1994; Svoboda et al., 1994; Dickson et al., 2006a). The majority of cell based studies examining endogenously expressed hVPAC₂R receptors have focused on SUP-T1 cells, however some have used Molt-4b lymphoblastic leukaemia cells (Summers et al., 2003) and THP-1 monocytic leukaemia cells (Chedeville et al., 1993). From the SUP-T1 studies, the generally observed ROP is helodermin>VIP=PACAP=PHI>>secretin, although a degree of variability is evident between studies (Robberecht et al., 1988, 1989; Xia et al., 1996; Gourlet et al., 1997c; Igarashi et al., 2002). Average $EC_{50}$ values reported in these studies from the examination of cAMP production, were ~0.3 nM for helodermin and ~10 nM for VIP and the PACAPs.

Finally, the rat PAC₁R was simultaneously cloned by several groups within just a few weeks of each other (Hashimoto et al., 1993; Hosoya et al., 1993; Morrow et al., 1993; Pisegna & Wank, 1993; Spengler et al., 1993; Svoboda et al., 1993), either from rat brain cDNA libraries or the rat AR4-2J cell line. The human transcript was cloned in the same year, whereas the mouse variant was cloned three years later (Ogi et al., 1993; Hashimoto et al., 1996b). When expressed in various host cell lines for functional assessment of receptor activity, the clear ROP for the PAC₁R is PACAP-27=PACAP-38>VIP (Pisegna & Wank, 1993; Spengler et al., 1993; Dickson et al., 2006a). In terms of cell lines endogenously expressing PAC₁, receptor pharmacology has been examined using AR4-2J cells and the human neuroblastoma cell line NB-OK-1, with many studies also performed using rat phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells (Buscail et al., 1990; Cauvin et al., 1990a; Deutsch & Sun, 1992). In general, data from PAC₁R expressing cell lines (cAMP assays) has shown the PACAPs and VIP to have $EC_{50}$ values of ~0.2 nM and ~40 nM respectively (Buscail et al., 1990; Cauvin et al., 1990a; Spengler et al., 1993; Dickson et al., 2006a).

#### 2.6. Pharmacology of VPAC/PACR

##### 2.6.1. Generic VPAC/PACR ligands

Prior to cloning of the individual VPAC/PAC receptor subtypes, multiple non-selective ‘VIP receptor’ ligands were reported, in addition to the endogenous peptides. Several of these ligands were ‘VIP receptor’ antagonists and have proven to be useful in defining receptor function, although the majority of these ligands are modified analogues of endogenous agonists. These analogues fall into three main categories: C-terminal fragments of VIP/PACAP, chimeric or hybrid peptides and finally, D-enantiomer substituted peptides. Some of the better characterised receptor antagonists are (N-Ac-Tyr¹, D-Phe²)-GRF(1–29)-NH₂ (Waelbroeck et al., 1985), [4Cl-D-Phe⁶, Leu¹⁷] VIP (Pandol et al., 1986), VIP(10–28) (Turner et al., 1986), stearyl-Nle¹⁷-Neurotensin(6–11)-VIP(7–28) (Gozes et al., 1995; Moody et al., 2002), PACAP(6–27) (Robberecht et al., 1991) and PACAP(6–38) (Robberecht et al., 1992). Most of these early ligands had relatively low affinity (µM) for VIP receptors and have now been superseded by new ligands of higher potency and selectivity following receptor cloning and novel methods of peptide synthesis. Some of these selective ligands have proven to be useful in defining the physiological functions of the VPAC/PAC receptors, with BAY 55–9837 for example, highlighting important roles for the VPAC₂R in glucose homeostasis (Tsutsumi et al., 2002). However, almost all of the ligands reported to date (vide infra) are peptides and are predominantly modified
versions of VIP and the PACAPs (sequences provided in Table 2), with only a single recent report describing non-peptide ligands for this receptor family (PAC₁R; Beebe et al., 2008).

### 2.6.2. VPAC/PACR selective peptides

A highly potent and selective agonist and antagonist have been described for the VPAC₁R. In 1997, Gourlet and colleagues described a modified hybrid peptide of VIP and GRF which was reported to be a selective VPAC₁R antagonist (Gourlet et al., 1997). This peptide, PG97-269, has been shown to inhibit agonist induced cAMP responses in r/hVPAC₁R expressing CHO cells with IC₅₀ values of ~40 nM (Gourlet et al., 1997a; Juarranz et al., 1999; Dickson et al., 2006a). When tested at concentrations up to 3 μM, PG97–269 had no effect alone, or on any agonist induced response in h/rVPAC₂ or PAC₁ receptor expressing cell lines (Gourlet et al., 1997a; Dickson et al., 2006a).

Three years later in 2000, the generation of a VPAC₁R selective agonist [Ala¹¹,²²,²⁸]VIP was reported, following structure–function studies examining VIP binding to VPAC receptors (Nicole et al., 2000). In AC/cAMP stimulation studies, this modified VIP analogue has been observed to have low nanomolar potency at hVPAC₁R (EC₅₀: 0.06–0.4 nM) and to have no considerable agonist effect at VPAC₂R (>1 μM; Nicole et al., 2000; Dickson et al., 2006a). Until recently the potency of [Ala¹¹,²²,²⁸]VIP at the PAC₁R was unknown, however studies have now shown this peptide to be a full agonist of micromolar potency in an hPAC₁R expressing cell line (cAMP, EC₅₀: 1.5 μM; Dickson et al., 2006a). Igarashi et al. (2005) similarly developed polyalinated VIP analogues as VPAC₁R agonists, with [Ala²,⁸,⁹,¹¹,¹⁹,²²,²⁴,²⁵,²⁷,²⁸]VIP being of low nanomolar potency in AC stimulation studies (EC₅₀: 0.7–2 nM) and selective for hVPAC₁R relative to hVPAC₂R (EC₅₀>10 μM). A hybrid peptide, [K¹⁵,R¹⁶,L²⁷]-VIP(1–7)/GRF(8–27) has also been reported as a potent and selective VPAC₁R agonist (AC studies, EC₅₀ VPAC₁R 0.5–1.9 nM, VPAC₂R>1 μM; Gourlet et al., 1997b; Langer et al., 2006).

The first of the putatively selective and potent VPAC₂R agonists were developed by Roche in the mid 1990s, as potential bronchodilators (Bolin et al., 1995; Xia et al., 1997). Two cyclic peptide analogues of VIP, Ro25–1553 and Ro25–1392 were described, both of which stimulated cAMP production in CHO cells expressing the human VPAC₂R, with EC₅₀ values of ~1 nM (Gourlet et al., 1997c; Xia et al., 1997). The peptides were found to be 300–1000 fold selective for the VPAC₂R, however both compounds also showed clear agonist activity at VPAC₁R, albeit when applied at micromolar concentrations. A number of VPAC₂R agonists have been developed by Bayer in an attempt to determine whether they might serve as potential therapeutic agents for type II diabetes, with the most potent ligands being BAY 55–9837 and R3P65 (Tsutsumi et al., 2002; Yung et al., 2003). Both peptides were produced from site directed mutagenesis studies of VIP, PACAP and Ro25–1553 and are potent VPAC₂R agonists (cAMP stimulation, EC₅₀: ~0.3 nM). BAY 55–9837 was shown to be 100 fold selective for VPAC₂R over VPAC₁R (EC₅₀: 30 nM; Tsutsumi et al., 2002). R3P65, which differs from VIP by only 4 aa, was slightly more selective (~200 fold) for VPAC₂R than BAY 55–9837, however at higher concentrations R3P65 stimulated both VPAC₁ (EC₅₀: 90 nM) and PAC₁ receptors (partial agonist at micromolar concentrations; Yung et al., 2003). However, in a more recent study (cAMP stimulation; Dickson et al., 2006a) although R3P65 was indeed a potent hVPAC₂R agonist (EC₅₀: ~2 nM), this peptide was shown to be even more potent at hVPAC₁R (EC₅₀: 0.3 nM) and to be a full agonist at hPAC₁ receptors (EC₅₀: 64 nM).

In attempting to develop VPAC₂R selective antagonists, Moreno et al. (2000) investigated the potency and binding affinity of modified VPAC₂R agonists, such as Ro25–1553. Following acylation of the amino-terminus of the extended VIP(1–26)KKGGT peptide with myristic acid (C14 fatty acid), the resulting peptide, named PG99–465 was reported to be the first selective VPAC₂R antagonist (Moreno et al., 2000). In AC studies, these authors showed that PG99–465 was a potent VPAC₂R antagonist (IC₅₀: 2 nM), however partial agonism at VPAC₁R was also observed (EC₅₀: 200 nM), making this peptide 100 fold selective (Moreno et al.,

2000). However, other studies have shown the activity of this peptide to be considerably more complex, with partial agonism shown at VPAC₂R (EC₅₀: 5 nM) and full agonism at VPAC₁ and PAC₁ receptors (EC₅₀ values: 8 and 70 nM respectively) in cAMP studies (Dickson et al., 2006a).

In contrast to the studies described above for VPAC receptors, the peptides reported to be PAC₁R selective ligands have no significant sequence homology to VIP, PACAP or any other member of this peptide family. Maxadilan, the first truly selective PAC₁R agonist, was extracted from the salivary gland of sand flies (*Lutzomyia longipalpis*) and was found to be a potent vasodilator (Lerner et al., 1991; Moro & Lerner, 1997). Upon cloning, maxadilan was shown to be 63 aa in length (Table 2) and is processed by C-terminal amidation to give a mature 61 aa peptide (Lerner et al., 2007). This peptide was originally found to have similar biological effects to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and was therefore initially evaluated for binding site interactions on rat and rabbit brain membranes with other peptides in that family, including VIP, PACAP, glucagon and secretin (Moro & Lerner, 1997). From these and additional studies, maxadilan has been demonstrated to specifically bind to and activate the PAC₁R, being equipotent with the PACAPs in stimulating cAMP production (EC₅₀: 0.05–1 nM; Moro & Lerner, 1997; Dickson et al., 2006a). No interactions (binding or functional studies) have been observed for maxadilan at either of the VPAC receptor subtypes (Moro & Lerner, 1997; Dickson et al., 2006a).

Structure–function studies using maxadilan have identified two deletion variants that are PAC₁R selective antagonists (Table 2). The first, M65, was described by Tajima and colleagues following the deletion of the 25–41 aa region of the maxadilan sequence (Uchida et al., 1998). M65 was shown to inhibit PACAP stimulated PAC₁R responses in a concentration dependent manner, however no IC₅₀ values or graphical data was presented for the cAMP studies described (Uchida et al., 1998). However, in two recent studies the potency (IC₅₀) of M65 to antagonise PAC₁R agonist induced responses has been reported to be 4 and 150 nM, with the first study examining pigment dispersion in *Xenopus* melanophores expressing PAC₁R (Reddy et al., 2006) and the second, cAMP production in PAC₁R expressing CHO cells (Dickson et al., 2006a). Tajima’s group also reported a second deletion variant of maxadilan, max.d.4. (Table 2), with residues 24–42 omitted from the parent peptide, which inhibited PACAP-38 simulated cAMP production in PAC₁R expressing stable cell lines with an IC₅₀ of ~0.3 nM (Moro et al., 1999), however these peptides remain relatively uncharacterised. Very recently, Beebe and colleagues reported the development of the first small molecule, non-peptide antagonists for PAC₁R (Beebe et al., 2008). These hydrazide compounds were produced during structure–activity studies of two glucagon antagonists and were reported to be of nanomolar binding affinity at PAC₁R, although very little data was presented. In addition, no information regarding the selectivity of the compounds for the receptor or their activities in functional studies was shown (Beebe et al., 2008). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether these compounds will prove to be useful in further delineating PAC₁R function.

Therefore, despite intensive investigation in the last 20 years only a limited number of truly selective VPAC/PACR ligands have been reported in the literature, including PG97–269, maxadilan and M65 (Table 3). However the majority of VPAC/PACR ligands interact with more than one receptor subtype (at least at higher concentrations) and additionally, some of these ligands remain only partially characterised for the three receptor subtypes.

### 2.7. VPAC/PACR signalling pathways

As members of the group B GPCR family, activation of VPAC/PAC receptors characteristically produces a Gαₛ dependent increase in [cAMP]ᵢ as described previously (Section 2.3, Fig. 2). However, VPAC/ PAC receptors can also stimulate the production of additional second messengers, a trait which is also observed for other GPCRs including β₂ adrenoceptors and calcitonin receptors (Zhu et al., 1994; Aiyar et al.,

1999; Xiao et al., 1999). In addition to cAMP, VPAC/PAC receptor activation can reportedly stimulate the production of intracellular calcium ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ; Dickson et al., 2006a, Fig. 2), as well as modulating the activity of phospholipase D (PLD; McCulloch et al., 2000), tyrosine kinases (Morisset et al., 1995), calcium channels (Chatterjee et al., 1996; Tompkins et al., 2006), RhoA GTPases (Henle et al., 2006), MAPK (Moroo et al., 1998), carbon monoxide (Watkins et al., 2004) and Src (Macdonald et al., 2005) amongst others. Although several years have passed since the VPAC/PAC receptors were linked with these additional transduction mechanisms few studies have systematically explored the coupling of all three receptors to these pathways and the associated pharmacology. Two of the slightly better studied VPAC/PAC stimulated second messengers ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ and PLD) shall be discussed further below.

#### 2.7.1. VPAC/PACR stimulation of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ and PLD

Prior to VPAC/PAC receptor cloning, several groups reported that VIP and PACAP were capable of stimulating calcium levels in a variety of cell types, including rat superior cervical ganglion (Audigier et al., 1986), adrenal medullary (Malhotra et al., 1988), pituitary (Canny et al., 1992) and PC12 cells (Deutsch & Sun, 1992), hippocampal neurons (Tatsuno et al., 1992), and SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells (Oettling et al., 1990). The specific interaction of VPAC/PAC receptors with G-proteins coupling to intracellular calcium ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ) pathways was reported soon after the cloning of each receptor subtype (VPAC₁R: Sreedharan et al., 1994; VPAC₂R: Xia et al., 1996; PAC₁R: Spengler et al., 1993). Despite these early observations, only a limited number of studies have since investigated VPAC receptor mediated increases in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ either in cells endogenously expressing hVPAC receptors (HT-29, Sreedharan et al., 1994; SUP-T1, Xia et al., 1996) or in transfected cell lines (HEK-293, Sreedharan et al., 1994; CHO, Xia et al., 1997; Langer et al., 2002, Dickson et al., 2006a). The transduction mechanisms which contribute to the rise in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ reportedly include both Gαᵢ and Gαq coupled pathways, with the Gαᵢ contribution estimated to account for ~40% of the total [Ca²⁺]ᵢ response in VPAC receptor stable cell lines (human and rat receptors; MacKenzie et al., 1996; Langer & Robberecht, 2005). In contrast, although hPAC₁R mediated stimulation of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ has also been reported in native (SHSY-5Y: Eggenberger et al., 1999, Dickson et al., 2006a; NBOK-1: Delporte et al., 1993) and recombinant cell lines (CHO: McCulloch et al., 2000, Dickson et al., 2006a), this calcium transduction pathway appears to be exclusively mediated via Gαq (MacKenzie et al., 1996; Van Rampelbergh et al., 1997). The complex and differential coupling of VPAC/PACR to pathways stimulating [Ca²⁺]ᵢ (Fig. 2) is paralleled in the mechanisms involved in VPAC/PACR stimulation of PLD (Morisset et al., 1995; McCulloch et al., 2000). For VPAC₁, VPAC₂ and a splice variant of PAC₁ (hop1, Section 2.8.2), receptor mediated elevations in PLD activity have been shown to be dependent on the small G-protein ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor; McCulloch et al., 2000). In contrast, PLD stimulation produced from activation of the PAC₁-null receptor was shown to be entirely independent of ARF, with a component of the response identified as phospholipase C (PLC) dependent (McCulloch et al., 2000). Very few studies have examined PLD stimulation produced by VPAC/PACR activation and whilst increased enzyme activity has been observed in cells transfected with rat VPAC/PACR (McCulloch et al., 2000), PLD stimulation resulting from endogenous receptor activity has only been reported for PAC₁R in the rat pancreatic tumour cell line AR4-2J and for unspecified VPAC/PACR subtypes in primary rat glial cultures (Morisset et al., 1995; Dejda et al., 2006).

#### 2.7.2. Agonist potencies for VPAC/PACR signalling pathways

In general, although cAMP, calcium and PLD can all be stimulated by VIP/PACAP activation of VPAC/PAC receptors when expressed in CHO cells, production of the former second messenger occurs more readily than the latter two. In the few studies in which PLD responses have been examined, VPAC/PAC receptor agonists were on average ~70 fold less potent in stimulating PLD activity than cAMP production in CHO cells expressing the rVPAC₁, rVPAC₂ and rPAC₁ receptors (McCulloch

The ligands described in Section 2.6 are shown along with relevant activities at the different receptor subtypes.

et al., 2000, 2001). However, for VPAC receptors even in the presence of a considerable agonist induced cAMP response, sometimes no alteration in calcium is observed (McCulloch et al., 2000, 2001). Moreover, when a VPAC receptor mediated calcium signal can be detected, the agonist concentration required to elicit this response (EC₅₀) varies considerably, ranging from at least one to two orders of magnitude greater than that required for cAMP (Sreedharan et al., 1994; Xia et al., 1996; Langer et al., 2001; MacKenzie et al., 2001; Dickson et al., 2006a). This difference in agonist potency in stimulating cAMP and calcium responses can also be seen for PAC₁ receptors in both stable cell lines (Deutsch & Sun, 1992; Spengler et al., 1993; McCulloch et al., 2001; Dickson et al., 2006a) and cells endogenously expressing the receptor (Dickson et al., 2006a).

As assay methodologies, cell type and receptor expression levels have varied considerably in studies of VPAC/PAC receptor signalling and pharmacology, it is therefore difficult to conclude exactly what underlies the different agonist potencies for the various transduction pathways (Ciccarelli et al., 1994; Laburthe & Couvineau, 2002). Whether in cell lines in which the receptors are endogenously expressed or in cells in which the receptors are stably transfected, changing levels of receptor expression may influence the characteristics of the responses observed (Langer et al., 2002; Langer & Robberecht, 2005). In transfected cell lines, the identity of the host cell line may influence the repertoire of agonist induced responses observed following VPAC/PAC receptor activation. For example, hVPAC₁R have been shown to mediate calcium responses via coupling to Gαq and Gαi (pertussis toxin sensitive) proteins in stably transfected CHO cells (Langer & Robberecht, 2005). However, in HEK-293 cells expressing the hVPAC₁R, no coupling to pertussis toxin sensitive Gαi was observed, despite the demonstration of agonist induced calcium responses in that cell line (Sreedharan et al., 1994; Shreeve et al., 2000). These findings indicate that the specific G-protein/second messenger complement of the cell line being examined could alter the transduction pathways/pharmacology observed for VPAC/PAC receptors (Laburthe & Couvineau, 2002; Langer et al., 2002). It is well known that VIP and PACAP are rapidly metabolised and although not extensively characterised, it is not inconceivable that their degradation products may contribute to the plethora of VPAC/PACR mediated signalling (Bourgault et al., 2008; Onoue et al., 2008).

Further variability in VPAC/PAC receptor pharmacology between different cell types could also involve the interesting interactions between these receptors and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs). The RAMPs are single transmembrane proteins which are reported to alter the trafficking, pharmacology, and signalling characteristics of GPCRs (Hay et al., 2006). Sexton and colleagues have shown that the VPAC₁R strongly interacts with RAMPs, with the specific interaction with RAMP2 demonstrated to enhance VIP induced inositol phosphate hydrolysis with no corresponding effect on cAMP responses (Christopoulos et al., 2003; Sexton et al., 2006). In contrast, these authors showed no significant interaction of VPAC₂R with RAMPs, with no examination of the PAC₁R reported (Sexton et al., 2006). With the RAMPs shown to have a widespread distribution throughout the nervous system and peripheral tissues, their potential influence on VPAC/PACR pharmacology and signalling merits continued evaluation (Hay et al., 2006).

Fig. 2. Intracellular signalling pathways stimulated by VPAC/PACR activation. The figure highlights the principal transduction pathways activated by VPAC₁, VPAC₂ and PAC₁-null receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins. Upon activation, all three receptors are capable of coupling to Gαₛ leading to downstream production of cAMP. In addition, the three receptors can also activate PLC leading to an increase in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ, via coupling to Gαq (all three receptors) and Gαi (VPAC₁ and VPAC₂ only). PLD activity can also be stimulated by the three receptor subtypes via ARF (VPACR) and PKC (PAC₁R) sensitive pathways.

Although the specific VIP/PACAP signalling pathways which lead to the production of \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) and PLD have been partially delineated (\([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\): VPAC\(_{1/2}\) partly \(G\alpha_{q}\) mediated, PAC\(_{1}\)-null \(G\alpha_{i}\) mediated; PLD: VPAC\(_{1/2}\) partly ARF mediated, PAC\(_{1}\)-null partly PKC mediated), a proportion of the responses mediated by the different receptor subtypes arise from currently uncharacterised pathways. It is possible that a degree of \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) and PLD stimulation arises from non-conventional VIP/PACAP modulated pathways/proteins, such as those involving acetylcholine (Choi et al., 2007), calmodulin, (Stallwood et al., 1992; Mahon & Shimada, 2005), FPRL1 (Kim et al., 2006) and carbon monoxide (Watkins et al., 2004) amongst others.

### 2.8. VPAC/PACR variants

Although many of the mammalian genes encoding GPCRs are intronless, the VPAC/PAC receptors and other group B receptors including the calcitonin and GRF receptors are exceptions (Gentles & Karlín, 1999). The presence of introns introduces the possibility of genes being processed differently (e.g. alternative splicing, exon skipping), thereby generating receptor splice variants, which could lead to alterations in pharmacology and signal transduction mechanisms (Kilpatrick et al., 1999). Until recently VPAC receptors splice variants were not thought to occur, contrasting with the multiple PAC\(_{1}R\) variants already identified (Table 4).

#### 2.8.1. Variants of the VPAC receptors

A recent report using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and SUP-T1 cells, described putative 5-TM variants of both the VPAC\(_{1}R\) (88 aa deletion) and VPAC\(_{2}R\) (74 aa deletion; Bokaei et al., 2006). Both of these variants were postulated to lack sections of the third IC loop, the third EC loop and the TM domains 6–7 (Bokaei et al., 2006). These authors examined the functional properties of the truncated VPAC\(_{1}R\) variant in CHO cells and demonstrated poor coupling to cAMP pathways. As this was the first report of a functional VPAC\(_{1}R\) variant, and the first report of 5-TM VPAC/PAC variants, it is clear further studies are required to determine the distribution and physiological relevance of such receptor variants. In addition, two naturally occurring deletion variants of the VPAC\(_{2}R\) have been identified in recent years by Goetzl and colleagues. The first, VPAC\(_{2}\)de367–380, was identified in mouse thymus and spleen, having a 42 base pair deletion in exon 12 that resulted in a 14 aa omission (367–380) at the C-terminal end of the seventh TM domain (Grinninger et al., 2004). It has been postulated that this variant may be a 6-TM receptor with an extracellular C-terminal, however how this variant arises is unknown and its distribution and physiological function remain unclear (Huang et al., 2006). Following transfection of the mutant receptor into Jurkat T cells, VIP bound with the same affinity as the standard VPAC\(_{2}\) receptor, however modulation of intracellular signalling molecules, including cAMP and interleukin-2 (IL-2), was not observed (Grinninger et al., 2004). In addition, T-cells transfected with the mutant receptor secrete less IL-4 upon VIP stimulation than cells transfected with the standard VPAC\(_{2}R\) receptor (Huang et al., 2006). The second VPAC\(_{2}R\) variant identified was found in a human malignant T-cell line and activated normal T-cells, and was produced as a consequence of the deletion of exon 11, which resulted in the loss of 114 aa (from 325–438) and 10 new aa in positions 325–334 (Miller et al., 2006). This created a frame shift and introduced a premature stop codon, with the resulting VPAC\(_{2}\) variant (VPAC\(_{2}\)de325–438(i325–334)), suggested to be a 5-TM receptor. In preliminary studies these authors found that VIP had a lower affinity for the mutant variant compared to the wild type VPAC\(_{2}R\) and that the mutant receptor was less sensitive to agonist-induced down regulation with weaker coupling to intracellular signalling pathways (Miller et al., 2006).

In 2001, Murthy and co-workers reported the presence of a VIP receptor in guinea-pig smooth muscle cells which was essentially VIP specific, with PACAP having very low affinity (Teng et al., 2001). The same authors have recently reported the cloning of this ‘VIPs’ receptor and have confirmed that PACAP has a much lower affinity and efficacy (cAMP studies) than VIP for this receptor when expressed in COS-1 cells (Zhou et al., 2006). The sequence of ‘VIPs’ was shown to differ from the VPAC\(_{2}R\) by only two residues, with both located in the N-terminal ligand binding domain (Zhou et al., 2006). The existence of a putative VIP selective receptor has been previously suggested by other groups, with Gressens and colleagues suggesting that a VIP selective receptor was responsible for mediating the neuroprotective effects of VIP following ibotenate induced brain lesions in newborn mice (Gressens et al., 1999; Rangon et al., 2006). In this model, VIP was a potent neuroprotectant, as were other VPAC\(_{2}R\) agonists and PHI, however VPAC\(_{1}R\) agonists and the PACAP peptides were without effect (Rangon et al., 2006). The presence of a ‘VIPs’ receptor was also postulated sometime ago by Ekblad and colleagues when investigating the properties of VPAC/PAC receptors in the mouse intestine (Ekblad & Sundler, 1997; Ekblad et al., 2000). Therefore the cloning of the ‘VIPs’ receptor may facilitate more extensive studies into the distribution and function of this novel receptor variant and help confirm whether it is the same VIP selective receptor proposed in these earlier studies.

##### 2.8.2. PAC\(_{1}R\) variants

The PAC\(_{1}R\) has been described as ‘one of the most extensively spliced GPCRs known’, with variants carrying changes in the IC loops, TM domains, and N-terminal regions (Dautzenberg et al., 1999). Although the presence of potential splice sites in such a range of regions is not common, a similar pattern has been reported for calcitonin and GRF receptors (Kilpatrick et al., 1999). In contrast to the VPAC receptors, the first PAC\(_{1}R\) variants were identified at the time of the initial receptor cloning by Spengler et al. (1993). These authors reported the cloning of five distinct PAC\(_{1}\) receptor variants from a newborn rat colliculi cDNA library, which were named null, hip, hop1, hop2 and hiphop1, according to the presence of two 28 aa cassettes (hip and hop) in the third IC loop (Fig. 3). The PAC\(_{1}\)-hop1 (28 residue insertion) and hop2 (27 residue insertion) variants were suggested to originate from the alternative use of splice acceptor sites in the hop cassette. The null and hop1 variants were shown to be the predominant PAC\(_{1}R\) variants found in several rat brain regions (Spengler et al., 1993). Using the same techniques, these authors subsequently reported the cloning of the sixth and final combination of these cassettes, the PAC\(_{1}\)-hiphop2 receptor (Journot et al., 1995). When expressed in a porcine kidney epithelial cell line (LLC PK1), the presence of the hip cassette was generally shown to reduce agonist induced AC stimulation and abolish calcium responses following agonist stimulation, whereas the hop cassette appeared to have no influence on the ability of the agonist to increase cAMP or calcium concentrations (Spengler et al., 1993; Journot et al., 1995). The receptors which contained both cassettes were shown to have an intermediate phenotype, with agonists having a marginally reduced potency and producing a smaller peak calcium response for the PAC\(_{1}\)-hiphop1 receptor (compared to PAC\(_{1}\)-null; Journot et al., 1995). More recently, Mustafa et al. (2007) expressed bovine PAC\(_{1}\)-hop1 and PAC\(_{1}\)-null in NG108-15 (neuroblastoma-glioma fusion) and PC-12G (pheochromocytoma) cells and reported that whereas PACAP treatment of cells expressing either variant increased \([cAMP]_{i}\), elevation of \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) was only detected in cells expressing the hop variant. The lack of PAC\(_{1}\)-null \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) stimulation is in contrast with previous reports (Spengler et al., 1993; Dickson et al., 2006a), with the authors suggesting such differences may be a result of using neuroendocrine rather than non-neuroendocrine cells to examine receptor signalling (Mustafa et al., 2007). These studies highlight the need to examine receptor signalling in a variety of cell types, particularly human, in order to gain a full understanding of their signalling properties.

Following on from Spengler and co-workers initial reports describing PAC\(_{1}R\) variants, the same group also identified an N-

terminal PAC₁R variant from a mouse genomic library, with the corresponding human sequence isolated from a fetal brain cDNA library (Pantaloni et al., 1996). They suggested this variant was produced from alternative exon splicing, resulting in a 21 aa deletion in the N-terminal region (Fig. 3; residues 89–109). At that time, the variant was referred to as the ‘very short’ (vs) PAC₁R and the only apparent functional consequence was a marginal increase in the potency with which PACAP-27 activated phospholipase C (VIP was not tested). In a subsequent study, VIP and PACAP stimulation was compared in HEK-293 cells expressing the ‘vs’ variant, and in contrast to the PACAP preferring null receptors, both peptides were equipotent (Dautzenberg et al., 1999). In later studies, a PAC₁R mutant equivalent to the ‘vs’ 21 aa deletion variant combined with the hop1 cassette was shown to be the predominantly expressed PAC₁R variant in rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons (Braas & May, 1999). In accompanying pharmacological studies (cAMP and inositol phosphate assays) using cultured SCG neurons, the PACAPs had similar potencies in both assays and were over 1000 fold more potent than VIP. In both of these assays, the maximum PACAP-27 induced responses were slightly larger than those of PACAP-38 (Braas & May, 1999).

Following on from the cloning of the rat hip and hop splice variants, Piseagna and Wank identified four human homologues from a

Fig. 3. Variants of the $PAC_{1}R$. The schematic illustrates the multiple sites in the $PAC_{1}R$ sequence which can be alternatively processed to produce $PAC_{1}R$ variants. For each cassette, the number of deleted (-) or inserted (+) residues (as compared to $PAC_{1}$-null) is shown in parenthesis. For the ‘very short’ variant*, the total number of deleted residues includes those omitted from the ‘short’ variant**, in addition to the preceding 36 residues. The numbers of the alternatively processed exons are shown in parenthesis next to the approximate location of the corresponding sequence alteration. Further details regarding sequence changes and functional characteristics for the $PAC_{1}R$ (and VPACR) variants are shown in Table 4.

frontal cortex cDNA library (Pisegna & Wank, 1996). As for the rat receptors, the human variants were distinguished by the presence of two exons, SV-1 and SV-2 (corresponding to two 28 aa insertions), which were suggested to be equivalent to the hip and hop cassettes respectively. In addition to human $PAC_{1}$-null, SV-1, SV-2 (of which there are two potential variants arising from alternative splice acceptor sites) and SV-3 (combined presence of SV-1 and SV-2) variants were identified and when stably expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH/3 T3), all four variants were shown to couple to pathways that increased cAMP and calcium following agonist addition (Pisegna & Wank, 1996). In these studies, the PACAP peptides were equipotent at all four variants, being approximately 50 fold less potent in the calcium assay, which is consistent with other studies comparing VPAC/PAC stimulation of these signalling pathways (Deutsch & Sun, 1992; Spengler et al., 1993; Dickson et al., 2006a). Maximal cAMP responses were similar for all four variants, however maximum calcium responses varied (Pisegna & Wank, 1996). The PACAP-38 calcium response from the SV-2 variant was approximately 8 fold higher than the null or SV-1 responses, with the SV-3 variant showing an intermediate level of calcium stimulation (normalised for varying levels of receptor expression). The null variant was found to be the predominant form expressed in a human brain (frontal cortex) cDNA library, with the rank order of expression being: null > SV-2 > SV-1 > SV-3 (Pisegna & Wank, 1996). In agreement with the larger calcium responses observed for the SV-2 receptor, further studies demonstrated that this variant also produced a greater stimulation of immediate early gene expression (c-fos and c-myc) when compared to the other splice variants (Pisegna et al., 1996).

The final $PAC_{1}R$ variant reported that year was cloned from rat cerebellar cDNA and was shown to differ from the null receptor at several residues, primarily in the fourth TM domain and was consequently called PACAP-TM4 (Chatterjee et al., 1996). The substitution and deletion of two aa in the fourth TM region (CVTV to SA-; residues 279–283), was in addition to the D136 N (N-terminal) and N190D substitutions (second TM domain). When expressed in a hamster kidney fibroblast cell line BHK-21, this receptor did not elicit any increase in cAMP or inositol phosphate concentrations following PACAP stimulation, although interestingly a clear calcium influx through L-type calcium channels was observed (Chatterjee et al., 1996). Mustafa and colleagues recently disputed the existence of this variant from both a structural and genetic point of view and in addition, (as discussed above) reported the hop cassette to be a crucial determinant of PAC1R calcium signalling (Mustafa et al., 2007). To date, PACAP-TM4 has not been examined in any other studies, however it would be of interest to study its signalling patterns in neuroendocrine cells to compare with the studies by Mustafa et al. (2007).

Three years after identification of the TM4 variant, Dautzenberg et al. (1999) identified a $PAC_{1}R$ variant in which 57 aa were deleted from the N-terminus. The deleted sequence was comprised of the 21 aa from the ‘vs’ variant described by Pantaloni et al. (1996), in addition to the preceding 36 residues (i.e. a deletion of residues 53–109; Fig. 3). This variant was subsequently isolated from human cerebellar tissue and Y-79 retinoblastoma cells and was described as the ‘vs’ variant, with these authors referring to the receptor described by Pantaloni et al. (1996) as the short or ‘s’ variant (Dautzenberg et al., 1999). From reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, mRNA for the null, short and very short variants was identified in human cerebellar and cortical tissues, and in Y-79 retinoblastoma cells (Dautzenberg et al., 1999). The PACAP peptides were shown to be less potent at the ‘vs’ receptor (~40 fold; cAMP assay) compared to the null or short variants, although the ‘vs’ variant remained a PACAP selective receptor with only a small VIP induced response detected at micromolar concentrations. In addition, the maximum VIP induced cAMP responses from both the null and ‘vs’ receptor expressing cells, were reported to be two thirds smaller than those from the short variant (in which the VIP and PACAP-38 responses were equivalent; Dautzenberg et al., 1999).

In 2001, Daniel and colleagues described a splice variant identified in rat testis, which had an additional 24 aa in the N-terminal ligand binding domain, arising from inclusion of a cassette between exons 3 and 4, and was consequently called $PAC_{1}R$(3a) (Daniel et al., 2001). The exact location of the insert in the $PAC_{1}R$ sequence has not been described, but it lies in the N-terminal region, near the deletion site for the ‘vs’ and ‘s’ variants. In functional studies (cAMP and inositol phosphate assays) using transfected HEK-293 cells, both PACAPs were slightly less potent at the (3a) variant compared to the null receptor. More recently the (3a) variant has also been identified in newborn rat cortical astrocytes (Pilzer & Gozes, 2006).

The range of PAC₁R variants was recently further extended by Lutz and co-workers, who identified fourteen different human PAC₁R splice variants in the SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cell line (Lutz et al., 2006). The most abundant variants detected were the ‘short’ (Pantaloni et al., 1996; referred to as δ5, 6+ null), the short-hop1 (Braas & May, 1999; δ5, 6 + hop) and the ‘very short’ variants (Dautzenberg et al., 1999; δ4, 5, 6+ null). These authors also compared the ability of the variants to couple to cAMP and calcium signalling pathways when expressed in COS7 cells. In cAMP and inositol phosphate studies, PACAP-38 was ~30 fold more potent than VIP in activating the δ5, 6+ null variant, which contrasts to the previous data (cAMP) showing these peptides were equipotent (Dautzenberg et al., 1999). Although the agonist ROP for this variant was similar in both assays, there was a shift to lower agonist potencies (~140 fold) in the inositol phosphate studies. For the δ5, 6+ hop variant, VIP was less potent than PACAP-38 in both assays as reported by Braas & May (1999), although the reduction in potency was only about 50 fold, in contrast to the 1000 fold difference described previously. In addition, there was a small shift to lower agonist potency in the inositol phosphate assay (~25 fold on average) which was not reported in the original studies. Finally, the δ4, 5, 6+ null variant was confirmed to be a PACAP preferring receptor in cAMP studies and as reported previously, agonists were less potent at this variant when compared to the PAC₁-null receptor (Dautzenberg et al., 1999).

As the majority of the studies described above were performed in cell lines, it remains difficult to definitively predict what the in vivo significance of these receptor variants might be. Although altered receptor pharmacology and signalling are likely to affect cellular functions, more in depth information, e.g. tissue/cellular distribution and expression levels, is still needed to delineate what physiological effects might be altered by the presence of these receptor variants.

### 2.9. Distribution of VPAC/PACR

The distribution of VPAC/PAC receptors has been thoroughly investigated in several species, using a range of techniques such as autoradiography and in situ hybridisation (ISH) studies. Below is a short summary of VPAC/PAC receptor distribution, however more detailed reviews are available elsewhere (Usdin et al., 1994; Sheward et al., 1995; Vertongen et al., 1998; Vaudry et al., 2000; Harmar et al., 2004).

Following the cloning of the VPAC₁R, initial ISH and northern blotting studies demonstrated expression in brain, heart, lung, kidney, small intestine, hippocampus and cerebral cortex (Ishihara et al., 1992; Sreedharan et al., 1993). More detailed studies of VPAC₁R expression in the CNS found the receptor localised to the pyrifom cortex, cerebral cortex, dentate gyrus, lateral amygdaloid nucleus, caudate putamen, supraoptic nucleus, choroid plexus, dentate gyrus and the pineal gland (Usdin et al., 1994; Vertongen et al., 1998; Vaudry et al., 2000). In peripheral tissues, the VPAC₁R has been shown to be expressed in numerous tissues and organs, including liver, kidney, prostate, breast, spleen, lung, mucosa of the gastro-intestinal tract and also on lymphocytes in lymph nodes and in almost all human epithelial tissues (Reubi, 2000).

At the time of VPAC₂R cloning, initial studies demonstrated that this subtype was expressed in the hippocampus, thalamus, SCN, olfactory bulb, lung and colon (Lutz et al., 1993; Inagaki et al., 1994). Additional studies examining VPAC₂R distribution in the CNS revealed a considerable expression in the cerebral cortex, periventricular nucleus, SCN, thalamus, hypothalamus and amygdala (Sheward et al., 1995; Vertongen et al., 1998; Vaudry et al., 2000). Although both VPACR subtypes are reported to be co-expressed in many areas of the CNS, studies do however suggest that when this occurs the two subtypes have a complementary distribution, being found in different areas or layers of cells, e.g. in the olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex (Usdin et al., 1994; Vaudry et al., 2000). In 2004, Harmar and co-workers performed an extensive study of VPAC₂R distribution in mouse peripheral tissues and reported that this subtype was predominantly expressed in smooth muscle layers of organs and blood vessels. Moreover, the VPAC₂R was also expressed in colonic mucosal epithelia, pancreatic acinar and thyroid follicular cells, the adrenal medulla, the retina and in lung alveoli as well as in blood vessels from many tissues (Harmar et al., 2004).

In 1993 when the PAC₁R was first cloned, considerable receptor expression was observed in the brain (Hashimoto et al., 1993; Ogi et al., 1993), with a lower expression detected in lung and liver (Hosoya et al., 1993). Several detailed studies of PAC₁R distribution have since been reported, most of which have investigated the expression of generic PAC₁R, with limited studies examining the distribution of specific splice variants. In the CNS, PAC₁R expression has been reported in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, area postrema, in cerebral, cerebellar, cingulate and entorhinal cortices, as well as in hypothalamic, amygdaloid, thalamic, raphe and SCN (Hashimoto et al., 1996a; Vaudry et al., 2000; Joo et al., 2004; Kalamatianos et al., 2004). In peripheral tissues PAC₁R expression has been reported in the pituitary, adrenal medulla, uterus, lymphoid tissue of the gut, testes and epididymis (Shivers et al., 1991; Reubi et al., 2000; Vaudry et al., 2000). From the limited studies investigating the localisation of specific PAC₁R variants, PAC₁-null and PAC₁-hop were shown to be the most highly expressed variants in brain tissue, with PAC₁-hop specifically and predominantly expressed in the testes, olfactory bulb and adrenal glands (Spengler et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 2000). These studies also showed the PAC₁-hop receptor to be expressed, albeit at lower levels than the null or hop variants, in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. The PAC₁-TM4 mRNA transcript was detected in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, vas deferens, lung and pancreatic β-cells (Chatterjee et al., 1996), with the 21 aa ‘short’ deletion variant (Pantaloni et al., 1996) restricted to the pituitary, adrenal gland, hypothalamus and thalamus. The combined short-hop1 variant described by Braas and May (1999), is the predominant variant expressed in SCG neurons, however the expression of this receptor in other tissues has not been examined. Finally, the PAC₁(3a) variant was originally localised to the testes by Daniel et al. (2001), however a more recent study detected its presence in cultured newborn rat cortical astrocytes (Pilzer & Gozes, 2006).

#### 2.9.1. VPAC/PACR distribution in cells of the nervous system

Following the isolation of the PACAP peptides, but prior to VPAC/PAC receptors cloning, PACAP binding sites were identified on rat astrocytes (Tatsuno et al., 1990). Since then, several studies (RT-PCR, ISH) have demonstrated the expression of VPAC₁R, VPAC₂R and PAC₁R (null, hop-1, hop-2, and (3a) splice variants) in cultured rat astrocytes (Ashur-Fabian et al., 1997; Grimaldi & Cavallaro, 1999; Jaworski, 2000; Pilzer & Gozes, 2006). Cultured rat neurons have been shown to express VPAC₂ and PAC₁-hop1 receptors (Grimaldi & Cavallaro, 1999), with microglia expressing VPAC₁R and PAC₁R, although the specific PAC₁R variants have not yet been investigated (Kim et al., 2000; Delgado et al., 2002). Finally, Joo et al. (2004) have shown that PAC₁R are expressed on oligodendrocytes, although this has yet to be confirmed by any other study.

#### 2.9.2. Cancerous cells expressing VPAC/PACR

As discussed earlier VPAC/PAC receptors appear to be highly expressed in a number of cancerous cell lines (VPAC₁R: HT-29, LoVo, HeLa cells; VPAC₁R: SUP-T1, Molt-4b, THP-1; PAC₁R: AR4-2 J, NB-OK-1, PC12). In addition, epithelial neoplasms originating from a variety of organs express VIP/PACAP binding sites (Vaudry et al., 2000). VPAC₁R are the most commonly expressed VPAC/PACR in several malignant neoplasms, including those found in the lung, GI tract, breast, pancreas and liver (Reubi, 2000; Busto et al., 2003; Moody & Jensen, 2006). In contrast, VPAC₂R expression only predominates in a limited number of tumours, including benign smooth muscle tumours (leiomyomas; Reubi, 2000). The PAC₁R is predominantly expressed in several neuronal and endocrine tumours including gliomas, neuroblastomas, pituitary adenomas, phaeochromocytomas and prostate tumours
(L. Dickson, K. Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 (2009) 294–316)

(Vertongen et al., 1996; Reubi, 2000; Lieu et al., 2006; Mammi et al., 2006; Muller et al., 2006). Several studies have investigated VPAC/PACR expression in neuroblastoma biopsies, where a high expression of PAC₁R variants are generally found (Vertongen et al., 1996; Jaworski, 2000; Lutz et al., 2006), however there does appear to be considerable variability between samples. Isobe et al. (2004) described VPAC₁R mRNA expression in a number of neuroblastoma biopsies (100% of samples), with lower expression of VPAC₂R (~30%) and PAC₁R (~40%). In immortalised cell lines derived from neuroblastomas, e.g. the SHSY-5Y cell line, PAC₁R appear to predominate (Vertongen et al., 1996; Lutz et al., 2006), with the latter study reporting that the PAC₁ δ5, 6+ null variant (21 aa deletion variant originally identified by Pantaloni) was the principal isoform expressed.

### 2.9.3. Distribution of VPAC/PACR in cells of the immune system

Generic VIP receptors were identified on several types of immune cells, including lymphocytes and lymphoblasts prior to receptor cloning (Section 2.5). The identity of the VPAC/PAC receptors present on such cell types has since been clarified, with extensive studies performed by Delgado and colleagues (reviewed by Gomariz et al., 2001). In summary, specific and constitutive VPAC₁R expression has been demonstrated on thymocytes (CD4+, CD8+), peripheral lymphocytes and macrophages (Delgado et al., 1996b,c). In other studies by the same group, VPAC₂R expression was only found on lymphocytes or macrophages following bacterial or viral exposure (Delgado et al., 1996a; Lara-Marquez et al., 2000). Finally, PAC₁R expression in the immune system appears very limited, with macrophages being the only cells shown to constitutively express this receptor subtype (Pozo et al., 1997).

## 3. Functions and roles of VIP/PACAP and their receptors

Given the widespread distribution of VIP, PACAP and their cognate receptors, it is not surprising that they produce an extensive range of physiological effects. Early reports suggested that VIP and PACAP exerted a multitude of effects on cardiovascular, circulatory and respiratory systems and on metabolic function (Said & Mutt, 1970; McCulloch & Edvinsson, 1980; Miyata et al., 1989, 1990), with a number of more recent studies pointing to a plethora of putative roles in the nervous (Dickinson & Fleetwood-Walker, 1999; Harmar et al., 2002) and immune systems (Pozo & Delgado, 2004; Gomariz et al., 2001; Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2007). However, a large proportion of these studies have focused upon a limited number of areas, including circadian function, glucose homeostasis, neuroprotection and the modulation of the immune system.

As for many peptides and their cognate receptors, clear insights into their physiological roles have recently been gained following the generation of transgenic animals. This has proven important in the VPAC/PACR field, particularly in the absence of low molecular weight, selective, non-peptide ligands. To date, transgenic mice have been developed with altered gene expression for VIP, PACAP, VPAC₂R and PAC₁R, with the outcomes discussed below.

### 3.1. VIP transgenics

Several different types of VIP transgenic mice have been reported, ranging from mice over-expressing (OE) the peptide to mice with reduced VIP expression and complete knock-outs (KO) (Gozes et al., 1993; Kato et al., 1994; Colwell et al., 2003). Studies using these mice have focused primarily on their impact on pulmonary hypertension and on circadian function, of which the major findings shall be briefly discussed below.

Mice selectively over-expressing the human VIP gene in pancreatic β-cells (the VIP gene was linked to an insulin promoter) were generated by Kato and colleagues (1994), with over-expression of VIP found to enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion, which led to a significant reduction in blood glucose. In addition, VIP OE abolished glucose intolerance in mice that had a reduced functional pancreatic islet cell mass (70% of pancreatic tissue had been removed). From these findings, the authors suggested that VIP-like peptides may be of therapeutic value in enhancing insulin secretion in diabetes (Kato et al., 1994).

The first of the VIP transgenic mouse lines with a reduced peptide expression was reported by Gozes et al. (1993). In a mouse line with a 20% reduction in brain VIP expression, the animals exhibited learning impairments including retardation in memory acquisition, with the male mice also showing reduced sexual activity (Gozes et al., 1993). The first line of VIP KO mice was reported ten years later in 2003 by Waschek and colleagues, with the use of targeted homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells leading to complete disruption of the VIP gene. The resulting mice appeared healthy and fertile and were subsequently used in circadian function studies to determine the role of VIP in sleep/wake cycles. The intrinsic circadian rhythms of the KO mice (determined under constant darkness) were found to be weaker than wild-type (WT) littermates, with some cases of complete arrhythmicity (Colwell et al., 2003). The KO mice also displayed altered entrainment to light cues, with these animals showing no phase shift in response to light pulses, highlighting the critical involvement of VIP in the mammalian circadian system. Extensive in vitro studies comparing activities of SCN neurons from these VIP KO with VPAC₂R KO and WT mice have further detailed the role of VIP in controlling circadian cycles and shall be discussed in more detail in Section 3.3 (Aton et al., 2005). Further studies using the same VIP KO line of mice suggested that these animals were more likely to die from experimentally induced endotoxemia than their WT littermates, to display symptoms of bronchial asthma and to develop pulmonary hypertension (Hamidi et al., 2006). With respect to pulmonary hypertension, further studies by this group demonstrated that the KO mice had thickened muscle layers and a narrowed lumen in pulmonary arteries, as well as ventricular hypertrophy (Said et al., 2007). Interestingly, these physical changes were reduced with VIP treatment (over a 4 week period), with the authors subsequently suggesting VIP replacement therapy as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension. These results are supported by the earlier work of Petkov et al. (2003), who reported that patients with pulmonary hypertension had low levels of VIP in both serum and lung tissue, and that VIP treatment (over 3 months, daily inhalation of a total of 200 μg VIP) reduced pulmonary arterial pressure (Petkov et al., 2003). The importance of normal VIP expression in gut function has also been recently highlighted, with altered intestinal morphology, reduced intestinal motility and a higher risk of death from gut stenosis evident in this line of VIP KO mice (Lelievre et al., 2007). In addition, studies have shown that although breeding success is not altered, male VIP KO mice have lower circulating concentrations of testosterone and in fact the altered hormone production appears to reduce normal testicular degeneration associated with ageing (Lacombe et al., 2007).

### 3.2. PACAP transgenics

Studies describing PACAP transgenic mice have focused primarily on KO animals, with several groups generating independent lines through targeted disruption of the PACAP gene in ES cells. One of the first PACAP KO lines was described by Sherwood and colleagues (2001), with these authors reporting that the KO mice appeared normal at birth, however the majority of pups died in the second postnatal week (Gray et al., 2001). Interestingly, these KO were subsequently shown to be temperature sensitive, with the majority of mice surviving past weaning when housed in warmer conditions (Gray et al., 2002). Following analysis of adipose tissue from the KO mice, the authors attributed this effect to a dependency on PACAP for normal adrenaline release from nerves in adipose tissue and subsequent stimulation of adipocyte thermogenesis. In the original
study, the KO pups had difficulties in gaining weight, with these authors suggesting that PACAP played a role in lipid metabolism, given the observation that there was an accumulation of lipids in the heart, skeletal muscle and liver of the KO mice (Gray et al., 2001). Recently published work by this group has shown that the decreased fat mass originally observed for the PACAP KO mice was not apparent when a high fat diet or warmer housing conditions were used (28 °C versus 21 °C; Adams et al., 2008). The temperature sensitivity of the mice was shown not to be a result of altered food intake or levels of physical activity. From these studies, the authors concluded that PACAP was essential for normal energy homeostasis, playing a particularly important role in thermoregulation (Adams et al., 2008).

In agreement with Gray et al. (2001), pups from a second KO line were also reported to have a considerable mortality rate, with ~50% dying before weaning (Hashimoto et al., 2001). Surviving adult mice exhibited hyperactive-like behaviours that included increased locomotor activity, enhanced novelty related exploration and explosive jumping, leading to the proposal that PACAP may regulate psychomotor responsiveness. In addition, homozygous matings of KO mice generally resulted in fewer successful pregnancies, with a specific role for PACAP in the female reproductive cycle subsequently delineated, with female mice shown to be less fertile, mating less frequently and also showing reduced crouching behaviour (Shintani et al., 2002). The same group also examined circadian function in the KO mice, with these mice shown to have an intact SCN, no developmental complications and a similar free running period to their WT littermates (Kawaguchi et al., 2003). These findings suggested that PACAP was unlikely to be necessary for the generation of endogenous circadian rhythms. However these studies did highlight an important role for PACAP in the light induced phase advance mechanism of the circadian clock (Kawaguchi et al., 2003). More recently this group also investigated the role that PACAP plays in neuroprotection, by comparing the extent of damage in WT mice with PACAP heterozygotes and KO animals, following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (Ohtaki et al., 2006). The infarct volume and neurological damage observed post insult was significantly higher in the KO mice, suggesting a role for endogenous PACAP in preventing neuronal damage. Further studies indicated that the neuroprotective effect of PACAP may involve IL-6 modulation of mitochondrial bcl-2 expression and cytochrome C release (Ohtaki et al., 2006). Baba’s group also examined the role of PACAP in pancreatic function by generating another transgenic line specifically OE the peptide in pancreatic β-cells, akin to the VIP line described earlier (Kato et al., 1994; Yamamoto et al., 2003). In contrast to the VIP OE mice, glucose levels were normal in the PACAP transgenics, suggesting a distinct role for the peptides in pancreatic function. Earlier studies with these mice which suggested a role for PACAP in stimulating feeding and energy homeostasis (Nakata et al., 2004), have recently been presented in more detail (Tomimoto et al., 2008). These authors described a crucial role for PACAP in energy homeostasis, with particular reference to lipid metabolism and body weight regulation. Consistent with Gray et al. (2001), these KO mice had decreased adipose tissue mass, however, in contrast to Sherwood's group, reduced food intake and no accumulation of fat in organs was reported for the KO mice. Although both groups therefore agree that PACAP regulates energy homeostasis, further studies are needed to reconcile the different observations reported and to clearly define the role of PACAP. Additional studies using Baba's line of PACAP KO mice have also suggested a role for PACAP in inflammatory and neuropathic pain (Mabuchi et al., 2004) and in regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Azuma et al., 2008).

In a third line of PACAP KO mice, Hamelink et al. (2002) examined adrenal function, as PACAP had been proposed to act as co-transmitter with acetylcholine. This group found that despite basal adrenaline secretions appearing normal, the transgenic mice were unable to survive following a metabolic stress (insulin induced hypoglycaemia)

which should stimulate prolonged adrenaline secretion (Hamelink et al., 2002). The authors suggested that the mice were unable to recover from the initial hypoglycaemia and proposed a role for PACAP as an emergency response hormone during prolonged episodes of metabolic stress (Hamelink et al., 2002). In the same mouse line, Chen and colleagues also investigated cerebral artery occlusion induced damage in PACAP KO and WT mice, however unlike Ohtaki et al. (2006) they also examined the effect of PACAP treatment following injury (given 1 h post insult; Chen et al., 2006). In WT mice, PACAP treatment reduced infarct volume and alleviated motor deficits. In agreement with Ohtaki et al. (2006), infarct volume and motor deficits observed post insult were more severe in KO than WT mice (Chen et al., 2006). However, upon PACAP treatment, these differences were no longer observed and the extent of damage was comparable in both lines of mice. PACAP treatment therefore appeared to reduce neuronal damage resulting from a lack of endogenous PACAP expression in the KO animals and afforded a degree of extra protection, equivalent to that observed with the WT mice (Chen et al., 2006). This work was extended by comparing the transcriptome from cortical samples from both lines of mice (PACAP treated and control) taken at 1 h and 24 h post insult. Multiple transcripts were reported to be PACAP dependent, with a larger number identified in samples from the 24 h time-point; these authors suggest a potential role for PACAP in late response to injury (Chen et al., 2006).

Following on from their circadian function studies in VIP KO mice (2003), Colwell and colleagues performed similar investigations with PACAP KO mice (Colwell et al., 2004). These mice showed less robust phase shifts (approximately 50% reduction compared to WT) in response to light pulses, highlighting a specific role for the peptide in modulating advances and delays in the sleep/wake cycle in response to light and agreeing with a previous study (Kawaguchi et al., 2003). The role of PACAP in inflammation was also investigated using animals from this KO line in a model of colitis (Nemetz et al., 2007). The KO mice were reported to develop more severe symptoms including colonic inflammation and in addition, were much more prone to developing colorectal tumours than WT littermates (Nemetz et al., 2007). This group recently explored the links between PACAP and tumour growth in more detail (Waschek et al., 2006; Lelievre et al., 2008). In these studies, PACAP KO mice were crossed with ptc1 mice, which have a mutation in a single copy of the sonic hedgehog receptor gene patched-1. The ptc1 mice have been used as a model of Gorlin's syndrome as they phenotypically have a higher incidence of developing certain tumours, including medulloblastoma (Lelievre et al., 2008). PACAP gene disruption was reported to further increase the prevalence of this tumour type in the double mutant mice (double heterozygotes), pointing to an inhibitory role for the peptide in tumour development/growth. PACAP was also shown to inhibit, in a PKA dependent manner, proliferation of cells derived from tumours (Lelievre et al., 2008). Future studies delineating the mechanisms involved in the PACAP, and presumed GPCR, interaction with this sonic hedgehog pathway, will be of interest, particularly given the high expression of VPAC/PACR in cancerous cells (Section 2.9.2).

In summary, multiple studies using PACAP transgenic mice have highlighted roles for the peptide in hyperactive psychomotor behaviours, mortality rates, energy homeostasis, tumour growth, lipid and glucose homeostasis, reproductive function, sleep/wake cycles, inflammation and neuroprotection. These studies clearly demonstrate important and complex roles for this peptide in a multitude of physiological processes and highlight the potential clinical opportunities for novel, non-peptide, selective ligands.

### 3.3. VPAC₂R transgenics

The first VPAC₂R transgenic animals were reported in 2000 by Harmar and colleagues, who generated mice OE the human receptor (Shen et al., 2000). The pattern of receptor distribution was similar to
that found in WT mice, with the highest levels of expression detected in the SCN. A role for the VPAC₂R in controlling circadian cycles was presented, with the OE mice shown to adjust more rapidly than WT littermates to an 8 h phase advance in the light/dark cycle (OE: 3.86 days; WT: 5.4 days). In addition, the hVPAC₂R-OE mice displayed a shorter circadian free running period (OE: 23.36 h; WT 23.59 h) when assessed under conditions of constant darkness (Shen et al., 2000).

The following year, Voice et al. (2001) reported the generation of a second hVPAC₂R transgenic mouse line, in which the T-cells of the mice constitutively expressed hVPAC₂R. This expression contrasts with standard WT mice, with VPAC₂R normally only detected upon T-cell stimulation (see Section 2.9.3; Lara-Marquez et al., 2000). The highest levels of hVPAC₂R expression were detected in the spleen and thymus, with splenic T-cells exhibiting a higher expression than B-lymphocytes or macrophages (Voice et al., 2001). Elevated serum levels of IgE, IgG1 and eosinophils were detected in these mice and were attributed to an increase in the effective ratio of functional Th2 and Th1 T-cells and associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and interferon-γ). These authors showed that the altered balance in cytokine production resulted in a depression of delayed hypersensitivity reactions (Voice et al., 2001).

The first VPAC₂R KO animals were described by Harmar and colleagues in 2001 and appeared normal in terms of general health, social behaviour and breeding patterns, although the mice were reported to show altered immune responses (Goetzl et al., 2001). However, when delayed-type hypersensitive responses were induced in these mice (through subcutaneous administration of the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetic acid active ester), an enhanced responsiveness was observed, in contrast to the results of Voice et al. (2001). It was suggested that the differences resulted from an inability of VIP to increase the level of Th2 cells and associated cytokines (relative to Th1) in these mice. It is clear that the VPAC₂R plays an important role in immune hypersensitivity.

Harmar and colleagues also examined the circadian characteristics of the VPAC₂R KO mice and identified a critical role for the receptor in the maintenance and expression of normal circadian activity (Harmar et al., 2002). Under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle, VPAC₂R KO mice had a similar pattern of activity to WT mice, however their overall activity levels were reduced. When exposed to a phase advance in the light/dark cycle the KO mice entrained to the new cycle much faster than WT animals (KO: 2.4 days; WT: 6.7 days). In addition, when exposed to brief periods of darkness during the daytime the KO mice became active, which contrasts with their WT littermates and demonstrated that masking by light was the principal factor governing their activity cycles. This finding was underlined by the observation that under constant darkness the KO mice expressed very weak endogenous rhythms and lacked a coordinated clock gene expression in the SCN. Subsequent in vitro electrophysiological studies using tissue from these mice indicated there was a loss of electrical activity rhythms in SCN neurons, an observation that was mimicked in WT tissue following application of the putatively selective VPAC₂R antagonist PG99–465 (Cutler et al., 2003). Disruption to normal SCN function at the cellular level was also observed in the KO, with immunohistochemical studies showing the mice had no rhythmic expression of p-ERK or c-fos in SCN cells, which contrasts with WT littermates (Hughes et al., 2004). Studies comparing SCN neuronal firing rates from these mice with those from VIP KO and WT mice have further defined the importance of VIP and VPAC₂R in normal circadian function (Aton et al., 2005). Examination of neuronal firing rhythms from both KO lines demonstrated that the majority of cells had multiple periods and impaired synchrony, in contrast to WT neurons which generally expressed a single period and synchronised firing rhythms. Furthermore, application of the VPAC₂R agonist Ro25–1553 restored rhythmicity to 71% of VIP KO arrhythmic neurons. These studies highlight the VIP/VPAC₂R contribution to circadian rhythm generation as being two fold—firstly, maintaining rhythmicity in subsets of cells and secondly, maintaining synchrony between rhythmic neurons (Aton et al., 2005). The most recent studies using this line of mice have explored the link between circadian cycles in the SCN and those in peripheral tissues (Sheward et al., 2007). These studies demonstrated that in the absence of rhythmic SCN outputs, blood corticosterone levels, locomotor activities and hepatic clock gene expression of the KO mice were all rhythmic only when following a restricted feeding schedule. These authors suggest that the cycles observed are due to the influence of a ‘food entrainable oscillator’, which can control peripheral circadian cycles independently of the SCN (Sheward et al., 2007).

A second line of VPAC₂R KO mice were independently generated by Asnicar and colleagues in 2002, with these authors investigating the role of the VPAC₂ receptor in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. These mice had reduced levels of body fat and became progressively leaner than their WT littermates with age. These authors also reported reduced fertility rates in older male mice, due to degeneration of seminiferous tubules (Asnicar et al., 2002), an effect not noted in the original studies (Goetzl et al., 2001).

### 3.4. PAC₁R transgenics

The first reported PAC₁R KO mice were created by Jamen et al. (2000), following targeted homologous recombination in ES cells. These authors found that the KO mice had impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion and increased glucose intolerance. The KO mice also weighed significantly less (~10%) than their WT counterparts, clearly highlighting the importance of the PAC₁R in glucose homeostasis. Interestingly, although the PAC₁R KO mice appeared normal at birth, ~60% died from unknown causes at about four weeks of age (Jamen et al., 2000). These mice were also tested in a range of behavioural tasks to determine the effect of removing PAC₁R from the hippocampus (Sauvage et al., 2000). The KO mice displayed no deficits in accuracy in water maze tasks, suggesting that the PAC₁R does not have a critical or major role in memory formation. However, a more subtle role for the PAC₁R was identified, with minor differences observed in contextual fear conditioning studies. The circadian activity of these mice was also examined and in a 12 h light/dark cycle, the circadian pattern of activity of KO and WT mice was similar, however in constant darkness, the KO mice had a significantly shorter period length (KO: 23.3±0.1 h; WT: 23.7±0.1 h; Hannibal et al., 2001). In response to light pulses in the early night, KO mice demonstrated large phase delays, which were more pronounced than WT mice, suggesting the SCN of the KO mice was more sensitive to light stimulation. In addition, the normal increase in clock genes (e.g. c-fos, mPer2) in response to light was not observed in KO mice following light stimulated phase shifts, indicating that altered cycles of clock gene expression are not always observed in response to phase shifts in the sleep/wake cycle (Hannibal et al., 2001). In more recent studies, the same group have extended their characterisation of this PAC₁R KO line by examining the effect on VIP rhythms in the SCN (Georg et al., 2007). In a 12 h light/dark cycle, the pattern of VIP mRNA expression in the SCN was identical in both PAC₁R KO and WT mice, being diurnal in both groups. Under constant darkness, the VIP mRNA expression in both groups of mice remained diurnal, however a shorter phase delay was observed in the KO mice compared to WT littermates. These authors suggested that the shorter phase delay may be related to their previous findings demonstrating PAC₁R KO mice to have shorter free running period (Hannibal et al., 2001). The amplitude of VIP mRNA expression in 24 h darkness was also considerably lower in the KO mice, indicating that signalling via PAC₁R in the SCN may influence VIP gene transcription (Georg et al., 2007). The modulation of VIP expression by PAC₁R is consistent with earlier studies from the group which showed that PACAP could increase VIP gene transcription in the predominantly PAC₁R expressing NB-OK-1 cell line (Georg & Fahrenkrug, 2000).
In 2001, Otto and co-workers also described two PAC₁R transgenic mouse lines and studied the role of this receptor in synaptic plasticity. The first was a full KO mouse line and the second was a novel transgenic in which only the PAC₁R of the olfactory bulbs, cortical forebrain and hippocampus were inactive (under the control of the Cre/loxP recombination system). In hippocampal slices from KO and WT mice, post tetanic stimulation was observed in the mossy fibre pathway, although sustained stimulation i.e. long term potentiation (LTP), was only observed for WT mice (Otto et al., 2001). In addition, both lines of transgenic mice showed impairments in contextual fear conditioning, whilst exhibiting no deficits in spatial learning, consistent with the earlier findings of Sauvage et al. (2000). These authors also noted differences in body weight between the KO and WT mice, with many transgenic animals dying within the second postnatal week (Otto et al., 2004), again consistent with the original observations (Jamen et al., 2000). Interestingly, the cause of death was suggested to be selective right heart failure, with these mice shown to have a high incidence of cardiac hypertrophy and a particularly pronounced dilatation of the right ventricle (Otto et al., 2004).

The most recent study describing PAC₁R transgenic mice identified a putative role for these receptors in the development of hydrocephalus (Lang et al., 2006). In three lines of transgenic mice OE PAC₁R to different extents, enlarged ventricles and a reduced cerebral cortex mass was observed, with the severity being proportional to the degree of receptor OE. PAC₁R OE in the developing embryo was also associated with a decrease in neuronal proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. The presence of abnormal cilia (shorter and more disorganised than in WT) in the ventricular ependyma was suggested to be partially responsible for the hydrocephalus-like effects seen in the transgenic mice. Interestingly, the PAC₁R OE mice demonstrated growth retardation and high pre-weaning death rates, two observations also reported for two lines of PAC₁R KO mice (Jamen et al., 2000; Otto et al., 2004). Therefore the generation and characterisation of VIP/PACAP and VPAC/PACR transgenic mice have proven to be extremely useful in delineating some of their physiological roles. It is likely that further examination of the behaviour and physiology of these transgenic mice will provide new insights into VIP/PACAP and VPAC/PACR function. It is however intriguing to note that the PAC₁R gain (OE) and loss of function (KO) mice both exhibit similar phenotypes in exhibiting growth retardation and high pre-weaning death rates; a similar observation was made for VPAC2R transgenic lines, in their abilities to rapidly adapt to advances in light/dark cycles (Shen et al., 2000; Harmar et al., 2002). These observations are indicative of the complex and diverse physiological roles elicited by these receptor subtypes and how compensatory/alternative mechanisms are probably also evoked by genetic manipulation.

family, and have been unprepared to take non-Lipinski like molecules through discovery and development (Hoare, 2005, Macarron, 2006). With small molecule drug discovery pipelines drying up and many new peptide therapeutics appearing, it is likely that Pharma companies will re-evaluate peptide receptors as potential druggable targets. Indeed, several companies including Bayer, Senju, Abbot Laboratories and Senetek have developed interests in VIP and PACAP receptors in the last few years. Therefore, interest in VIP, PACAP and the VPAC/PAC receptors remains strong and future research should provide the information required for the development of such non-peptide ligands and facilitate the further understanding of the functions and roles of these interesting peptides and their cognate receptors.
