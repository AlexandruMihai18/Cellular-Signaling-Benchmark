### Summary

Enteric pathogens finely regulate the expression of virulence genes in reply to stimuli generated by the intestinal environment. This minireview focuses on recently discovered strategies developed by enteric bacteria to cause intestinal secretion through the elaboration of factors that share structure and function with specific host counterparts. Such bacterial antigens appear to interfere largely with the epithelial cell signalling that physiologically regulates the numerous and, as yet not fully elucidated, mechanisms controlling both the transcellular and the paracellular secretion pathways. Heat-stable enterotoxins (STs) elaborated by enterotoxigenic *Escherichia coli* and the enteroaggregative *E. coli* enterotoxin (EAST1) are both typical examples of enteric toxins that activate the transcellular secretion pathway by mimicking guanylin, the endogenous modulator of cGMP signalling. Alternative strategies have been developed by *Salmonella* to induce intestinal secretion through the elaboration of a factor (SopB) that resembles at least two of the host cell 4-phosphatases, enzymes that activate the Ca-dependent transcellular secretion pathway. Finally, *Vibrio cholerae* has developed innovative tactics to activate the paracellular secretion pathway through the elaboration of Zonula occludens toxin (Zot), a factor that mimics a recently described physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions.

### Introduction

A new discipline, cellular microbiology, is emerging at the interface between cell biology and microbiology (Cossart *et al.*, 1996). One of the most remarkable examples of this new approach to the study of mammalian cell biology is the cross-talk between enteric pathogens and intestinal cells. Studies on this interaction are providing tools to study the pathophysiology of the regulation of intestinal fluid accumulation, permeability and antigen uptake.

In recent years, the attention of scientists has been attracted by the ‘intelligence’ of enteric pathogens or, in better words, by the subtle subversion of the eukaryotic cell functions exploited by microorganisms to achieve their own profit. In this learning process, enteric pathogens have selected their strategies to mimic eukaryotic cell signalling factors and, therefore, innovative ways to finely ‘tune’ the activity of the host cell regulatory pathways. This knowledge is contributing to our understanding of the complex host–parasite relationship and may lead to the development of innovative strategies for the treatment and prevention of human diseases. This review will present a brief synopsis of the most recently characterized bacterial factors that share structure and function with eukaryotic modulators of the transcellular and paracellular pathways involved in the regulation of intestinal secretory processes.

#### The transcellular secretion pathway

The epithelial cells lining the intestine primarily function to absorb nutrients, electrolytes and water from the intestinal lumen. During the digestive processes, fluid is secreted into the intestinal lumen to facilitate the mixing of digestive enzymes with nutrients and to promote the presentation of nutrients to the absorptive epithelial cells. The net intraluminal secretion of electrolytes [particularly chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>)] drives this fluid accumulation. Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion is activated by a number of secretory agonists that bind to the cell basolateral membrane receptors and lead to changes in intracellular second messenger levels (Table 1). The final result of this activation is the phosphorylation of specific apical Cl<sup>-</sup> channels. Many pathogens induce Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion by exploiting these host signalings (Table 2; Fig. 1) using specific toxins ‘engineered’ during bacteria evolution that affect different steps of the cellular control of Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion. In this section, we highlight two of the most recently described strategies used by enteric pathogens to activate

These proteins show minimal similarities in their extracellular domains, while there is a higher degree of similarity of their intracellular domains. This finding suggests that the extracellular portion of the GC molecules represents the ligand-binding domain (Schulz et al., 1991). The physiological role of STₐ receptors in the mammalian intestine was unknown until 8 years ago, when Currie et al. (1992) extracted and purified from the rat small intestine a peptide that is homologous to STₐ. This endogenous peptide hormone, named guanylin, stimulates Cl⁻ secretion via activation of intestinal GC. Guanylin shares 50% homology with STₐ and binds competitively to the STₐ binding site on T84 cells (Currie et al., 1992). Our group described a heat-stable enterotoxin (named EAST1) elaborated by enteraggregative E. coli (EaggEC) (Savarino et al., 1991) that was structurally and functionally similar to guanylin (Savarino et al., 1993). Studies on T84 cells and COS cells transfected with GC-C suggest that EAST1 interacts with GC-C to elicit an increase in cyclic GMP (D. Robertson, A. Fasano and S. Savarino, personal communication). The relation of guanylin to STₐ and EAST1 requires close scrutiny. Given that these three moieties all act by means of the GC/cyclic GMP system and all share significant amino acid sequence homology, a comparison of their primary structure may provide insight into the absolute requirements of the receptor-ligand interaction involved in the enterocyte cyclic GMP-mediated signal transduction. Certain structural

the transcellular pathway through the elaboration of factors that mimic the action of specific host counterparts. These factors act on Cl⁻ transport at the cell membrane level affecting, respectively, the cyclic GMP signalling and the phosphatidylinositol signalling.

The cGMP signalling

Cyclic GMP, like cyclic AMP, evokes Cl⁻ secretion and diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and a variety of other enteric pathogens exploit this signalling by elaborating a family of heat-stable enterotoxins (STs) that activate the cyclic GMP pathway (Table 2). The ST epithelial surface receptor coincides with the guanylate cyclase (GC) activity (Giannella et al., 1983). GC exists in two major forms, soluble and particulate. Soluble GC is a dimeric cytosolic protein that is activated by nitric oxide (Giannella, 1995). Particulate GC is a family of brush-border membrane glycoproteins that are activated by only two classes of substances, atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) (Table 1) and STₐ. So far, three different members of the particulate GC family have been cloned (Singh et al., 1988; Chinkers et al., 1989; Schulz et al., 1990). GC-A and GC-B are ANP receptor cyclases, while GC-C is the specific receptor for STₐ. All three members of the GC family share the property of being proteins that span the cell membrane.

Cross-talk between enteric pathogens and the intestine 85

Fig. 1. Enterocyte intracellular signalling leading to intestinal secretion. Four main pathways seems to be involved in the intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes: cAMP, cGMP, Ca and cytoskeleton. These pathways are activated by several enteric pathogens, either directly or through the elaboration of enterotoxic products. CT, cholera toxin; LT, heat-labile enterotoxin; TDH, thermostable direct haemolysin; C.D., *Clostridium difficile*; EAST1, enteroaggregative *E. coli* heat-stable toxin 1; STa, heat-stable toxin a; AC, adenylate cyclase; GC, guanylate cyclase; CM, calmodulin; PKC, protein kinase C; ZOT, Zonula occludens toxin; EGF-r, epidermal growth factor receptor; ECM, extracellular matrix. Partially modified from Cossart *et al.* (1996) (with permission).

elements within the C-terminal tridecapeptide of ST<sub>a</sub> are functionally critical, one of which is the occurrence of six cysteine residues participating in three disulphide bridges. Listed in descending order of importance in terms of their respective contribution to enterotoxic activity, the predicted disulphide linkages between Cys-7 and Cys-15, Cys-6 and Cys-11, and Cys-10 and Cys-18 (referring to ST<sub>a</sub>) are all involved in the biological activity of the molecule (Gariepy *et al.*, 1987). In contrast, EAST1 and guanylin possess only four cysteine residues. Their four cysteine residues align with Cys-7, Cys-10, Cys-15 and Cys-18. Based on this evidence, it is attractive to predict that the cysteine residues of EAST1 and guanylin form the same bridge pairs as in ST<sub>a</sub>. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments, in which the Cys-7 (as referred to ST<sub>a</sub>) of EAST1 was replaced with an alanine residue, confirmed the key role of the disulphide bridge between Cys-7 and Cys-15 in GC/cyclic GMP activation and subsequent enterotoxic activity of EAST1 (D. Robertson, A. Fasano and S. Savarino, personal communication).

The EAST1 genotype is not restricted to EaggEC, being detected with notable frequency in enterohaemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC), ETEC and enteropathogenic *E. coli* (EPEC) (Savarino *et al.*, 1996). The high prevalence of the EAST1 genotype in EHEC, particularly in serogroups O157:H7 (100%) and O26 (89%), is striking. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the EAST1 gene present in EHEC is chromosomally encoded, while this gene is plasmid encoded in ETEC (41%), EPEC (21.5%) and EaggEC (41.4%) (Savarino *et al.*, 1996). These data suggest that EAST1 was acquired by O157 EHEC early in its clonal lineage and that some selective edge is maintained by its conservation. Based on these findings, it is also tantalizing to postulate that the transfection of EHEC by a bacteriophage was responsible for the translocation of the EAST1 gene on plasmid(s) subsequently acquired by other pathogenic *E. coli*.

The cyclic GMP signalling is a typical example of how microorganisms have been able to adapt to the intestinal physiology of complex animals and to elaborate ‘by chance

and necessity’ the agonist (i.e. EAST1) of guanylin, the natural ligand of the GC/cyclic GMP signalling. Even more remarkable is the observation that some microorganisms synthesize a long-lived superagonist of guanylin, as STa turned out to be 40-fold more active than guanylin (Carpick and Gariepy, 1993). Given the time needed by prokaryotic organisms to assemble new genes, to maintain them in their limited genome and to share this information with other microorganisms, it follows that bacteria probably learned about the cyclic GMP pathway thousands, if not millions, of years before us.

### The phosphatidylinositol signalling

Phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PIP) are increasingly recognized as crucial elements in many signalling pathways, which are activated by extracellular stimuli as diverse as growth and differentiation factors, inflammatory cytokines (Brennan et al., 1999; Jones et al., 1999), and apoptotic stimuli (Lin et al., 1999) (Table 1). Multiple sensors can interact with these intracellular signal transducers leading to the modulation of intestinal secretion through the Ca²⁺-dependent Cl⁻ secretion pathway (Kachintorn et al., 1993; Uribe et al., 1996; Xie et al., 1996; Eckmann et al., 1997; Norris et al., 1998). In particular, several studies have demonstrated that PI(3,4,5,6)P₄ and PI(3,4,5)P₃ participate in various physiological activities. These activities are regulated by the Ca²⁺-dependent Cl⁻ channel activation controlling salt and fluid secretion, pH balance and osmoregulation, and mediate the action of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Xie et al., 1996; Eckmann et al., 1997). It has been shown recently that Salmonella dublin alters the metabolism of phosphoinositides by the elaboration of SopB, a protein secreted through the Salmonella type III system (Norris et al., 1998). The strategy elaborated by Salmonella implies solid knowledge of the epithelial cell inositol phosphate-signalling pathway. In fact, SopB presents conserved amino acid sequence motifs that are related to the sequences of at least two of the host cell 4-phosphatases. The phosphatase activity of SopB affects Cl⁻ secretion by at least two different actions on phosphatidylinositol signalling. The first of these actions, observed both *in vitro* and *in vivo*, is the hydrolysis of an inositol pentakisphosphate isomer to obtain PI(1,4,5,6)P₄, an antagonist of the inositol phosphate PI(3,4,5)P₃ implicated in closing the Cl⁻ channel. A second action is the hydrolysis of PI(3,4,5)P₃ (Norris et al., 1998). The antagonist effect on PI(3,4,5)P₃ and the hydrolysis of this isomer both enhance Cl⁻ secretion and may therefore produce intestinal fluid accumulation. This evidence suggests that Salmonella has learned a very original way to keep ‘open’ the Ca-dependent Cl⁻ channel (and therefore to induce diarrhoea) by mimicking epithelial cell phosphatases. According to the sequence homologies observed between

SopB and IpgD of Shigella, Norris et al. (1998) postulated that Shigella is also able to subvert the inositol phosphate cell signalling.

#### The paracellular secretion pathway

A century ago, tight junctions (tjs) were thought to be a secreted extracellular cement forming an absolute and unregulated barrier within the paracellular space. There is now abundant evidence that tjs are dynamic structures that adapt readily to a variety of developmental (Magnuson et al., 1978), physiological (Madara and Pappenheimer, 1987) and pathological (Milks et al., 1986) circumstances. These structures play a major role in regulating epithelial permeability by influencing paracellular flow of fluid and solutes. Moreover, structural features of tjs, such as strand number, often correlate inversely with the permeability of epithelia, as measured electrophysiologically. In recent years, much has been discovered about the structure, function and regulation of tjs. However, the precise mechanism(s) through which they operate are still incompletely understood.

Several microorganisms exert a cytopathic, pathological effect on epithelial cells that involves the cytoskeletal structure, and the tjs function in an irreversible manner (Table 2). These bacteria alter intestinal permeability through the elaboration of toxins (i.e. Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis) (Sears et al., 1995) or by recruitment of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells that migrate across the epithelium (i.e. Salmonella, Shigella and EPEC) (McCormick et al., 1993; Perdomo et al., 1994; Savkovic et al., 1996). In addition, EPEC enhance junctional permeability by inducing myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). During EPEC infection, phosphorylated myosin light-chain (MLC) shifts from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton, where it induces the contraction of the cytoskeletal protein ring beneath the tjs, so increasing paracellular permeability.

A physiological regulatory mechanism of tj permeability has been proposed, with more details, for the Zonula occludens toxin (Zot) elaborated by Vibrio cholerae (Fasano et al., 1991). Our group identified this toxin while searching for other factors responsible for the residual diarrhoea observed in CT⁻ V. cholerae vaccine candidates. We have subsequently demonstrated that Zot increases the permeability of the small intestine by promoting a dose- and time-dependent PKCα-related polymerization of actin filaments strategically localized to regulate the paracellular pathway (Fasano et al., 1995). These changes are a prerequisite to the opening of tjs and are evident at a toxin concentration as low as 1.1 × 10⁻¹³ M (Fasano et al., 1997). The toxin exerts its effect by interacting with a specific surface receptor that is present on mature cells of small intestinal villi, but not in the colon (Fasano et al., 1997). The regional distribution of Zot receptor(s) coincides with the different

permeabilizing effect of the toxin on the various tracts
of intestine tested. Based on these observations, it was
hypothesized that Zot may mimic the effect of a function-
ally and immunologically related endogenous modulator
of epithelial tjs (Fasano *et al.*, 1997). Our recent findings
corroborated this hypothesis. Zot was found to be located
in the outer membrane of *V. cholerae*, where it is exposed
to the extracellular milieu and subjected to processing
(Uzzau *et al.*, 1999). We hypothesize that Zot possesses
a modular structure in which an N-terminal cleavage pro-
duct of 33 kDa remains associated with the bacterial
envelope and a carboxyl-terminal fragment of 12 kDa,
or smaller, is secreted extracellularly and causes tj dis-
assembly (Fig. 2) (Uzzau *et al.*, 1999). The Zot N-terminal
sequence possesses evident homology with pl proteins
of filamentous bacteriophages, a family of phage products
involved in bacteriophage morphogenesis. Such homology
would account for the role played by Zot in the assembly
of *V. cholerae* CTXΦ (Fig. 2) (Waldor and Mekalanos,
1996). However, a key question remains: does the extracel-
lularly released C-terminal fragment mimic a physiological

**Cross-talk between enteric pathogens and the intestine** 87
modulator of intestinal tjs? The answer came from the identification of an intestinal Zot analogue that we named zonu-
lin (Fasano *et al.*, 1998). N-terminal sequence analysis of
purified zonulin was found to share a motif (GxxxVQxG)
corresponding to the N-terminus of the ≈12 kDa extracel-
lular fragment of Zot (amino acids 291–298). When zonu-
lin was studied in a non-human primate model, it opened
intestinal tjs reversibly (Fasano *et al.*, 1998). As *V. cholerae*
infections are strictly confined to the gastrointestinal tract,
we anticipated an exclusively intraintestinal role for zonulin.
Much to our surprise, this protein(s) was detected in a wide
range of extraintestinal tissues and has now been purified
from human intestine, heart and brain. The physiological
function of the zonulins remains to be established. How-
ever, it is likely that they are involved in tj regulation respon-
sible for the movement of fluid, macromolecules and
leukocytes between body compartments.

cascade of events that regulate intestinal permeability (Fasano *et al.*, 1995; 1997) prompted our group to explore the possibility of modulating tj permeability in order to deliver orally molecules normally not absorbed through the gut mucosa. The oral administration of Zot with biologically active compounds was able to enhance intestinal absorption of the active molecule, and this enhancement seemed to be effective for both relatively small (5733 Da: insulin) and large molecules (140–160 kDa: IgG) (Fasano and Uzzau, 1997). Furthermore, experiments in BB/Wor diabetic rats demonstrated that orally delivered insulin retains its biological activity, as this treatment was as efficient as the parenteral administration of the hormone in controlling the high blood glucose level of treated animals (Fasano and Uzzau, 1997).

Zot-dependent delivery of soluble antigens was also investigated to assess the potential adjuvanticity of this molecule (Marinaro *et al.*, 1999). Intranasal immunization of mice with ovalbumin induced a mucosal specific immune response that increased strongly when ovalbumin and Zot were co-administered. These results suggest that Zot action on mucosal tjs can be exploited for the development of more effective mucosal vaccines.

### Conclusions

Studies of the cross-talk between pathogens and the host intestine are entering a new phase, in which the definition of their molecular basis is providing powerful tools for dissecting the functions of various eukaryotic cell signalling pathways. The few examples of bacteria-host interaction outlined in this review suggest that we can gain new insights into cell biology by studying those microorganisms that know how to communicate with their mammalian host.
