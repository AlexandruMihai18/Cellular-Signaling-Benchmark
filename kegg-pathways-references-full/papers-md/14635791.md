# β-Catenin and Tcfs in Mammary Development and Cancer

Sarah Hatsell,$^{1}$ Tracey Rowlands,$^{1}$ Minoti Hiremath,$^{1}$ and Pamela Cowin$^{1,2}$

---

β-Catenin regulates cell–cell adhesion and transduces signals from many pathways to regulate the transcriptional activities of Tcf/Lef DNA binding factors. Gene ablation and transgenic expression studies strongly support the concept that β-catenin together with Lef/Tcf factors act as a switch to determine cell fate and promote cell survival and proliferation at several stages during mammary gland development. Mice expressing the negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (K14-Dkk) fail to form mammary buds, and those lacking Lef-1 show an early arrest in this process at stage E13.5. Stabilized ΔN89β-catenin initiates precocious alveologenesis during pubertal development, and negative regulators of endogenous β-catenin signaling suppress normal alveogenesis during pregnancy. Stabilized β-catenin induces hyperplasia and mammary tumors in mice. Each of the β-catenin-induced phenotypes is accompanied by upregulation of the target genes cyclin D1 and c-myc. Cyclin D1, however, is dispensable for tumor formation and the initiation of alveologenesis but is essential for later alveolar expansion.

## β-CATENIN LINKS CADHERINS TO THE CYTOSKELETON

β-catenin was first identified as one of several proteins that were tightly bound to the C-terminus of classical cadherins (1). As its name suggests (Latin *catena*, meaning chain), it provides a critical link in a chain of proteins that strengthen cell–cell adhesion by coupling cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (see Fig. 1). In addition to creating and stabilizing the mammary gland architecture, cadherin–catenin complexes also exert effects on cell fate, survival, polarity, and motility. For example, inactivation of E-cadherin, which mediates adhesion between luminal cells of the mammary gland, is associated with invasive lobular breast cancer in women and premature apoptosis and involution in mice (2,3). Conversely, N-cadherin

expression in mammary cell lines induces a highly invasive and motile phenotype by stabilizing FGF receptors and eliciting expression of MMPs (4,5). Ablation of the myoepithelial cadherin, P-cadherin, induces precocious mammary development (6). Overexpression of the E-cadherin catenin-binding domain has the same phenotype and additionally disturbs epithelial polarity during lactation (7).

β-Catenin binds to cadherins immediately upon their synthesis and insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This association promotes the correct folding of the cadherin cytoplasmic domain, and chauffeurs the complex to the cell membrane (8). At the cell surface β-catenin binds α-catenin, which links the complex to the actin cytoskeleton and recruits actin-remodeling agents. These actions initiate cell contact by linking adhesion proteins to the propulsive force of actin polymerization (9). Cadherin- and catenin-mediated cell contacts are initially discrete and transient and remain this way in mesenchymal and myoepithelial cells. In epithelial cells cadherin–catenin contacts coalesce into adherens junctions and promote the assembly of neighboring desmosomes (9). β-Catenin also associates with several tight

Tiam-1 activation of the G-proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 removes IQGAP from β-catenin thereby permitting association of α-catenin (α-cat). α-Catenin binds to F-actin, vinculin and α-actinin, which bind to actin remodeling components VASP and Mena. Other ARM family proteins, plakoglobin and p120 also associate with cadherins. MUC-1 does not bind β-catenin when phosphorylated on serine 44 by GSK-3β. (B) ErbB-ligand stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB receptors and of MUC1 causes c-src to bind to MUC1 and displace GSK-3β. Under these circumstances both ErbB receptors and MUC1 bind β-catenin and potentially titrate it away from cadherins, resulting in loss of cell adhesion and motile invasive behavior.

junction proteins, thereby orchestrating the formation of terminal bar complexes that are crucial for the luminal integrity of secretory epithelia (10).

**β-CATENIN: A PIVOTAL ELEMENT IN THE REGULATION OF CELL ADHESION**

A key feature of β-catenin is that its linkages can be modulated. This attribute permits cells to change their adhesive status in response to both internal and external signals from G-proteins and kinases. Cytoskeletal association is negatively regulated by the competitive binding of IQGAP to the α-catenin binding site on β-catenin and positively regulated by sequestration of IQGAP by Tiam1-activated Rac/Cdc42 (11). β-Catenin also recruits the tyrosine kinases and breast oncogenes pp60src, EGF-R, and ErbB2 to cadherin complexes (12,13). Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin by these kinases results in loss of attachment to the cytoskeleton, poor cell adhesion, cell scattering and, in some instances, promotion of β-catenin signaling (14). ErbB-catenin complexes are particularly abundant in murine Wnt-1-induced mammary tumors as well as in infiltrating ductal carcinomas and metastases in humans (15). Recent structural and mutational analyses of β-catenin have elucidated the mechanism by which phosphorylation affects cell adhesion. β-Catenin comprises head and tail domains flanking a central block of twelve 42 amino acid ARM repeats. These repeats fold and stack together to form a positively charged concave binding surface for negatively charged partners (16). Phosphorylation of the ARM repeat domain by pp60src diminishes its positive charge, leading to partner repulsion (17). Conversely, phosphorylation of partner proteins, such as E-cadherin by CKII/GSK-3β, increases their negative charge and hence their affinity for β-catenin (18). In normal cells, cadherin-catenin complexes recruit several receptor tyrosine phosphatases to counter the action of kinases

(19). Predictably, several breast cancer cell lines show aberrant phosphorylation of $\beta$-catenin (20).

### Reciprocal and Antagonistic Associations Among $\beta$-Catenin, MUC1, and E-Cadherin

An additional $\beta$-catenin interaction that is likely to be important for mammary gland morphogenesis and neoplasia is with the transmembrane mucin, DF3/MUC1/episialin (21–23). MUC1 is an antiadhesive protein that sterically hinders cadherin adhesion. It also associates with and promotes the signaling of ErbB receptors and is overexpressed in many carcinomas (22, 23). MUC1 and E-cadherin binding to $\beta$-catenin appears to be reciprocally regulated by phosphorylation (see Fig. 1). GSK3-$\beta$ phosphorylation of MUC1 and E-cadherin inhibits and promotes their association with $\beta$-catenin, respectively, thereby enhancing adhesion (18, 24). In contrast, phosphorylation of MUC1 by EGF-R, $c-src$, and PKC$\delta$ promotes $\beta$-catenin-MUC1 association, in the case of $c-src$ by inhibiting the GSK3$\beta$-MUC1 association (25). Thus, cadherins, mucins, and growth factor receptors are engaged in a complex interplay whereby competition for $\beta$-catenin appears to be crucial to their impact on adhesion and tumor progression.

### $\beta$-Catenin at the Hub of Signal Transduction Pathways

The second major role for $\beta$-catenin lies in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. $\beta$-Catenin is present in a wide variety of protein complexes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Recent studies show that it lies at the hub of many signal transduction cascades that can be categorized into those that influence the stability of cytosolic $\beta$-catenin and those that impinge upon the activity of nuclear $\beta$-catenin/LEF complexes (see Fig. 2) (26–37). Of these, the one that has received the most intense scrutiny and has clear relevance for the mammary gland development and neoplasia is the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway (see Fig. 3).

### Wnt SIGNALING IN THE MAMMARY GLAND

Wnts were independently discovered as *wingless* (*wg*), a segment polarity gene regulating patterning of denticle belts in the abdominal segments of the fly larvae cuticle and *Int-1*, one of six transforming genes that were interrupted and expressed in the mammary gland by proviral insertion of the mouse mammary tumor virus (38). Wnts constitute a large family of secreted proteins and Wnts-1, -3 and -10b have transforming properties when overexpressed in the mammary gland (39–41). Although Wnt-1 and -3 are normally silent in this gland, Wnt-10b and six other Wnt genes show dynamic temporal and spatial expression patterns compatible with potential roles in regulating mammary development (42–44). The best studied of these is Wnt-4, which when ablated shows a phenotype of impaired side-branching that is also seen in progesterone receptor null (PR$--$) mice (45, 46). PR positive cells have been shown to induce side branching by a paracrine action; this signal is probably mediated by endogenous Wnts, as ectopic Wnt-1 can rescue the defect (45, 46). Significantly, progesterone induces Wnt-4 expression in mammary cells (45, 46).

#### THE CANONICAL Wnt PATHWAY

Genetic experiments linking *wg* expression to posttranscriptional upregulation of Armadillo, a protein with 65% identity to $\beta$-catenin, implicated $\beta$-catenin as a Wnt transducer. Recent studies have shown that Wnt actions are more complex and can elicit up to four pathways. Hence the $\beta$-catenin pathway is now the canonical Wnt pathway (47). A model of the canonical pathway, drawn from composite findings from fly and various vertebrate systems is shown in Fig. 3. Secreted Wnts bind to specific members of the Frizzled family of transmembrane receptors leading to the formation of a ternary complex with the LDL-receptor related protein, LRP/Arrow. Binding of Wnts to frizzleds is regulated positively through presentation by proteoglycan receptors, such as Dally, and negatively by secreted factors, such as FRP, WIF, cerberos, and dickkopf, that competitively bind Wnt ligands or inhibit assembly of the coreceptor complex. Wnt signals activate the disheveled family of PDZ-containing proteins to bind LRP and axin, an element of a destruction complex. This complex also contains the colonic tumor suppressor protein, APC, and kinases GSK3-$\beta$ and CKI$\alpha$ that phosphorylate $\beta$-catenin, thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation (Fig. 3(a)). Disheveled’s recruitment of a GSK3-$\beta$ binding protein (GBP) to the destruction complex inhibits GSK3-$\beta$, thereby stabilizing cytosolic $\beta$-catenin (Fig. 3(b)). The mechanism by which stabilized/activated $\beta$-catenin modulates the expression of genes that are regulated by members of the Lef/Tcf family of transcription factors is currently controversial. One model posits that the $\beta$-catenin C-terminal

Fig. 2. Signaling pathways converging on β-catenin. β-Catenin lies at the hub of many signal transduction pathways. Many modulate β-catenin stability via regulation of GSK-3β, which targets β-catenin for proteasomal destruction. Others regulate β-catenin stability by GSK-3β-independent mechanisms (Pin-1, p53; Siah; IKKα, IKKβ). ICAT and NLK suppress transcription by inhibiting assembly of the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex, while others compete for association with β-catenin (Sox, Tcf-1, RAR) or with Lef/Tcf (plakoglobin). Various basal transcription factors and histone-remodeling proteins inhibit (pontin52, reptin52) or promote (Grg-1, CBP, p300,TBP) β-catenin-dependent transcription and a final set (NFκB, Smads) exert combinatorial effects on target gene read-out (in all cases arrows indicate stimulation and bars indicates inhibition of downstream elements in the pathways) (see wnt website http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html for specific information and refs).

domain transactivates genes (Fig. 3(b)) (48). A second view holds that β-catenin displaces corepressors, such as groucho/TLE, that bind Lef/Tcf and recruit activators (Fig. 3(b)) (49,50). A third model proposes that β-catenin exports repressive and imports activated forms of Lef/Tcf (Fig. 3(c)) (51). Regardless of the mechanism, a plethora of genes are modulated in response to β-catenin expression (for pathway refs. see http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wnt window.html).

### β-CATENIN IN EARLY EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAMMARY BUDS

Compelling evidence for β-catenin signaling in the mammary gland comes from mice lacking the putative transcription partner Lef-1. Lef-1 null mice show arrest in mammary development at the early mammary bud stage E13 and fail to form mammary glands and other skin appendages, such as hair and

Fig. 3. Schematic of the canonical Wnt pathway. In the absence of Wnt signals (Left), $\beta$-catenin is targeted for proteasomal degradation by phosphorylation by CK1$\alpha$ and GSK-3$\beta$ within the destruction complex that also includes axin and APC. (Center) Wnt binding to frizzled (Fz) receptors and LRP coreceptors on the cell surface activates dishevelled (Dsh), which inactivates GSK by recruiting GSK-binding protein (GBP). Stabilized $\beta$-catenin enters the nucleus and, in concert with Tcf/Lef, promotes, directly transactivates or displaces repressor and recruits transcriptional activators (+) to modulate target genes. (Right) Alternative models suggest that in the presence of Wnt, $\beta$-catenin shuttles repressive Lef/Tcfs out of and activated Lef/Tcfs into the nucleus.

teeth, that require epithelial-mesenchymal signaling (52). Lef-1 is first expressed in cells in the basal layer of the epidermis and in the epithelial cells of the mammary buds. However, it is downregulated in keratinocytes that are destined to form the nipple and is instead expressed in the underlying condensing mammary mesenchyme (53). Although Lef-1 can act independently of $\beta$-catenin by cooperating with smads, $\beta$-catenin is observed in regions of Lef-1 expression and they are concomitantly perturbed by ablation or misexpression of PTHrP (53). Specifically, PTHrP null mice continue to express epithelial Lef-1 and $\beta$-catenin but fail to upregulate them in the mammary mesenchyme and lack mammary glands. Conversely, constitutive overexpression of PTHrP in the basal epidermal layer under the control of the keratin 14 promoter leads to loss of Lef-1 expression in epidermal

cells and inappropriate induction of Lef-1/$\beta$-catenin expression in the underlying ventral dermis. This alteration transforms the entire ventral epidermal surface into nipple skin (53). Consistent with the hypothesis that a Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway governs cell fate determination at this early stage, mice expressing dickkopf, a secreted and specific inhibitor of the canonical Wnt pathway, fail to form mammary buds (54).

$\beta$-CATENIN SIGNALING IN DUCTAL EXTENSION

Two studies have explored the effect of $\beta$-catenin on ductal extension during puberty. Mice expressing MMTV-$\Delta$N89$\beta$-catenin, a stabilized/activated form of $\beta$-catenin, displayed a mild retardation of ductal

extension (55). A similar phenotype was seen in mice expressing an inactivated mutant form of the negative regulator, APC<sup>580s</sup>, produced by expression of cre recombinase in early puberty under the control of the β-lactoglobulin promoter (56). In both studies the phenotype observed was self-correcting. The mechanism, though unclear, may involve inhibition of the APC-catenin association with microtubules at the leading edge of migrating cells, which has previously been shown to be essential for tubulogenesis in MDCK cysts.

### β-CATENIN SIGNALING IN ALVEOLOGENESIS

A role for β-catenin signaling in alveologenesis has recently been established. The first hint that β-catenin could play such a role came from the phenotype of MMTV-ΔN89β-catenin mice (55). These mice show hyperplastic eruptions along the ducts of young virgin females that display structural and biochemical features of early alveologenesis. Specifically, these structures enclose fluid-filled lumena containing fat droplets and staining positively for casein expression (55). Structures with these features also develop de novo in males, further suggesting that β-catenin signaling is sufficient to initiate precocious alveologenesis in the absence of the hormonal milieu associated with pregnancy (55, 57). ΔN89β-catenin mice display no obvious further perturbation in the morphology of their mammary glands during pregnancy, lactation, and the early apoptotic stages of involution. However, they maintain an early pregnancy phenotype in late-stage involution, which may signify either failure to undergo the second stage of MMP-driven remodeling or the reemergence of the transgenic phenotype in response to the resumption of estrus. This hyperplasia worsens with each pregnancy. A total of 100% of breeding females develop multiple adenocarcinomas around 4<sup>1/2</sup> months of age and at 7 months in virgin animals; with longer latency tumors develop in a small percentage of males (55). Similar observations of hyperplasia and tumor formation were made in a second study using a slightly different transgenic construct, ΔN90β-catenin (58). Both of these studies further established that upregulation of β-catenin target genes cyclin D1 and c-myc accompanied each of these phenotypes, thus implicating β-catenin signaling in both the developmental and neoplastic changes (55, 58). A comparison showed that ΔN89/ΔN90β-catenin and Wnt-1 tumors are indistinguishable. This similarity

Hatsell, Rowlands, Hiremath, and Cowin

strongly suggests that stabilization of endogenous β-catenin is the most likely explanation for the oncogenicity of Wnt-1 in mammary gland, as is the case in many other tissues (55, 58).

#### DISTINCT ASPECTS OF THE MMTV-Wnt-1 PHENOTYPE

Although this description of the early developmental phenotypes of the MMTV-ΔN89/ΔN90β-catenin superficially resembles that described for MMTV-Wnt-1 mice, a closer inspection reveals a significant difference (55). Early pubertal precocious hyperplasia induced in MMTV-Wnt-1 mice exhibits both hyperbranching and alveologenesis (40, 55). In contrast, MMTV-ΔN89β-catenin glands show only precocious alveologenesis, with no effect on side-branching (55) (see Fig. 4). Wnt-1 is a secreted product that can exert paracrine effects, but the effects of ΔN89β-catenin are restricted to the luminal epithelium. From this behavior, it can be deduced that elevation of lumenal cell β-catenin levels induces alveolar development. However, Wnt-1’s additional ability to cause hyperbranching in MMTV-Wnt-1 mice and to rescue side-branching in PR−/− mice must depend on its paracrine effects on neighboring myoepithelial and/or stromal cell populations and/or its capacity to elicit noncanonical signaling pathways that operate independently of β-catenin (47) (see Fig. 4).

#### SUPPRESSORS OF β-CATENIN SIGNALING INHIBIT ALVEOLOGENESIS

Studies in which β-catenin signaling was suppressed have firmly established an essential role for endogenous β-catenin in alveologenesis (59, 60). As β-catenin plays critical roles in cell adhesion, two strategies were used to interfere specifically with β-catenin signaling. In the first study, axin, a component of the destruction complex that downregulates cytosolic β-catenin, was expressed in a tetracycline-regulated manner (59). This modification had no effect on ductal side-branching, but specifically inhibited alveolar development. These glands showed a marked reduction in cyclin D1, which is normally upregulated during mid-pregnancy concurrent with alveolar expansion. Predictably, these compromised glands were unable to sustain lactation and underwent premature postpartum apoptosis. Although these conclusions are consistent with the overexpression studies, it may

be argued that axin can act through JNK pathways instead of, or in addition to, depressing β-catenin signaling. A second study, taking a more direct and specific approach to repress β-catenin signaling, has established that β-catenin is essential for alveolar cell survival (60). This study employed a dominant negative chimera in which the engrailed repressor domain replaced the C-terminal region of β-catenin that silences β-catenin signaling in Xenopus embryos without affecting cell adhesion (61). Transgene expression was detected only during days 10–12 of pregnancy in approximately 50% of alveolar clusters, which underwent apoptosis. The severe reduction in alveolae number compromised lactational capability, resulting in pup death. Cyclin D1 levels were depressed in these glands. Thus, loss of function and gain of function studies are consistent and, taken together, strongly support the concept that β-catenin is required for specification, survival, and proliferation of alveolar progenitors and for the subsequent upregulation of cyclin D1 expression, which is required for their further expansion.

## PARSING THE ROLES OF β-CATENIN AND CYCLIN D1 IN ALVEOLOGENESIS

A functional connection between β-catenin and cyclin D1 during alveologenesis is strongly suggested by the similarity in phenotypes of mice overexpressing or suppressing these proteins and the fact that in such mice increases and decreases in expression of β-catenin are always accompanied by similar changes in cyclin D1 (55,59,60,62–64). Observations on mice expressing MMTV-ΔN89β-catenin on a cyclin D1 null background (CycD1--/−Δβ-cat) suggest

that alveogenesis involves two distinct stages (57). CycD1$-/-\Delta\beta$-cat mice undergo precocious development, showing that cyclin D1 is dispensable for the initiation of alveologenesis (57). However, later alveolar expansion during pregnancy in these mice remains cyclin D1-dependent (57). Mice expressing the $\beta$-catenin suppressor (axin) fail to produce alveoli even though cyclin D1 is present (59). These observations indicate that both $\beta$-catenin and cyclin D1 are essential for alveologenesis and act sequentially during pregnancy (Fig. 4).

One question that arises is whether the cell that requires $\beta$-catenin signaling is a mammary stem cell, an alveolar progenitor or differentiated alveolar progeny? This question has been addressed by using the tetracycline inducible system to express axin (59). This study asked whether alveoli were irrevocably lost from the gland by a single round of axin suppression during the first pregnancy or if they could be restored when axin expression was withdrawn during subsequent mammary cycles. Alveoli were regenerated following silencing of the transgene during a subsequent pregnancy. From this we may conclude that $\beta$-catenin is not required for survival of mammary stem cells but for an alveolar progenitor population that transiently forms with each mammary cycle.

The actions of $\beta$-catenin during alveologenesis suggest a model that could link alveolar development to predisposition to breast cancer (Fig. 5). Paracrine pathways from hormone receptor-bearing cells activate $\beta$-catenin within a stem cell. This cell undergoes an asymmetric division to regenerate itself and to produce an alveolar progenitor daughter that requires $\beta$-catenin for survival. $\beta$-Catenin induction of a cyclin D1-mediated cell cycle during pregnancy converts this progenitor into a pair of transit-amplifying daughters that proliferate extensively but are removed at the end of lactation. In this model the alveolar progenitor would be the equivalent of cells generated during each burst of estrus. MMTV-$\Delta$N89$\beta$-catenin tumors are seen as arising from a constitutive hormone-independent estrus due to continuous expression of $\beta$-catenin resulting in accumulation of alveolar progenitors. Significantly, the incidence of breast cancer in humans is known to positively correlate with estrus number. This model predicts full penetrance and early tumor onset in $\beta$-catenin-mediated tumorigenesis where a second hit for division but not for immortalization is required, and much slower and less penetrant tumor predisposition resulting from cyclin D1-stimulation of proliferation, which would require a second hit specifically for immortalization.


$\beta$-CATENIN AS A DEVELOPMENTAL SWITCH

Although phenotypes of the $\Delta$N89/$\Delta$N90 w$\beta$-catenin mice are consistent with those that upregulate (Wnt-1, -3, -10b), and suppress (axin and $\Delta$N$\beta$-catEN) endogenous $\beta$-catenin, other studies have suggested that $\beta$-catenin signaling in the mammary gland must be suppressed to maintain a secretory phenotype (65). In one study, conditional ablation of exon 3, encoding amino acids 5–80 of $\beta$-catenin, resulted in expression of $\Delta$Ex3-$\beta$-catenin under the control of the endogenous $\beta$-catenin promoter, but with the timing and tissue expression pattern determined by hormonal regulation cues and mosaic expression patterns of the WAP-cre or MMTV-cre transgenes. These mice developed small focal mammary cysts that showed loss of alveolar differentiation markers and gain of epidermal keratin 1 expression and progressed to form squamous metaplasia (65). Differences in constructs, timing or levels of expression have been proposed to explain this discrepancy. Mice expressing a $\beta$-lactoglobulin-cre-induced mutant APC${}^{580s}$ also develop numerous small metaplasias similar to adenosquamous carcinomas (56). A total of 18% of mice null for TCF-1, a target of $\beta$-catenin/TCF 4 signaling that does not contain a $\beta$-catenin binding domain and thus acts as a negative regulator, form adenoacanthomas. TCF-1$-/-$/APC${}^{580s}$ or APC${}^{\text{min}}$ mice lack normal mammary epithelia and show increased and accelerated adenoacanthoma formation (56). An analysis of other transgenic/mutant mice that express elements that impinge on $\beta$-catenin signaling and many other pathways reveals a spectrum from hyperplasia to metaplasia to adenocarcinoma (66). Although the discrepancy between the phenotypes observed in MMTV-$\Delta$N89/$\Delta$N90 and $\Delta$Ex3-$\beta$-catenin remains obscure, contextual dependencies of $\beta$-catenin and its regulators have been extensively reported in other systems. For example, APC mutations potently predispose human and mouse intestine to neoplasia, but have far less effect in mammary gland (67). Precedent also exists in studies on other epidermal appendages. Expression of stabilized $\beta$-catenin in the basal layer of skin leads to extra hair follicles arising from both hair and epidermal stem cells (68). Conversely, conditional ablation of $\beta$-catenin or Lef-1 leads to loss of hair and formation of epidermal cysts (69). Expression of a putative dominant negative form of $\beta$-catenin, K14-$\Delta$N/$\Delta$C, promoted the conversion of hair stem cells into cysts with epidermal or sebaceous characteristics, as expected, but

Fig. 5. Model for the roles of $\beta$-catenin and cyclin D1 during alveologenesis. Hormone receptor-positive cells are envisaged to represent a stem cell niche (NICHE) located in proximity to hormone receptor-negative stem cells (STEM). Hormonal signals received by receptor-bearing cells are converted to signals (Wnts) that induce neighboring stem cells to undergo an asymmetric division in a cyclin D1-independent manner (D1–). This division results in regeneration of the stem cell and production of a daughter cell (Progenitor) with side-branching and alveolar capabilities. Further cyclin D1-dependent divisions of this cell (D1+) produce a lineage of “transit amplifying” cells (TA) that, while expansive, ultimately undergoes terminal differentiation. Absence of cyclin D1 would prevent cell divisions that lead to the terminally differentiated gland. Activation of $\beta$-catenin signaling ($\beta$) would result in expansion of the stem/progenitor cell compartment, and may lead to hyperplasia and tumor formation which would be further accentuated in the absence of cyclin D1. Dashed arrows represent lineages that may encompass multiple cell divisions.

surprisingly induced de novo hair follicle formation from epidermal stem cells in a manner reminiscent of $\beta$-catenin overexpression (70). The explanation for this conundrum appears to be differential effects of the transgene on the levels and localization of endogenous $\beta$-catenin in different cell types. Thus, the emerging picture is that $\beta$-catenin acts as switch to establish lineage choices at critical junctures in developmental pathways. The outcome depends on the timing of its expression, previous lineage history of the cell, and status of positive and negative $\beta$-catenin regulators within this cell. In the case of the mammary gland this takes the form of a choice between mammary and other epidermal appendage differentiation programs.

$\beta$-CATENIN AND CANCER

Although the proto-oncogenic effects of Wnts and $\beta$-catenin have been firmly established in the mouse mammary gland, no activating mutations have been described for these genes in human breast cancer. Nevertheless, changes in Wnts, FrzB, Axin, and APC have been reported in breast tumors and cell lines (see Table I), suggesting that the pathway is activated in some breast cancers. Several observations suggest a pathway between $\beta$-catenin and cyclin D1 upregulation in tumorigenesis. Transcriptional regulation of *cyclin D1* by $\beta$-catenin signaling has been demonstrated in colonic, cervical and breast

tumor cells, and coincident elevation of β-catenin and cyclin D1 has been demonstrated in breast cancer and correlated with poor clinical outcome (83, 91, 92). Mice overexpressing β-catenin or cyclin D1 form tumors, albeit with different latency; the β-catenin-induced tumors consistently display upregulation of cyclin D1 (55, 86). Despite this body of literature linking cyclin D1 upregulation to the oncogenic effects of β-catenin, MMTV-ΔN89-β-catenin induces tumors on cyclin D1−/− backgrounds (57). Surprisingly, MMTV-ΔN89-β-catenin phenotypes are accentuated rather than impaired by loss of cyclin D1, raising the possibility that although cyclin D1 elevation accompanies and appears to be induced by β-catenin activation, cyclin D1 may nevertheless provide a negative feedback on other β-catenin-stimulated proliferative pathways (see Figs. 4 and 5) (57). The model proposed for β-catenin and cyclin D1 during development suggests that this scenario might occur by preventing the clearance of progenitors by transcriptional amplification and conversion into differentiated daughters and loss during involution. c-myc, which is also upregulated in a significant proportion of human breast cancers, is elevated in MMTV-ΔN89β-catenin uninvolved hyperplastic glands and tumors regardless of their cyclin D1 status and is likely to provide an alternative oncogenic route (93).

**OTHER PATHWAYS REGULATING β-CATENIN**

In addition to its involvement in Wnt signaling, recent studies have shown that β-catenin is a key player in several other major signal transduction pathways (see Fig. 2) (26–37). Many elements of these pathways play roles in mammary gland development and oncogenesis (see Table II), and thus

for shared cofactors. The TGF-β pathway impinges via smads and by TAK activation of nemo-like kinase (NLK), which phosphorylates TCFs, disrupting their DNA-binding and transcriptional capacity (94). Interestingly, this cascade can be activated by the Wnt/calcium pathway and therefore represents a mechanism of antagonistic crosstalk between different classes of Wnt signals (94). Finally, several pathways, such as those mediated by smads and NFκB, converge on target gene promoters, and β-catenin repression of NFκB target genes may represent an additional mechanism whereby β-catenin promotes oncogenic transformation (95).

### CONCLUSIONS

In summary, β-catenin plays multiple roles in the mammary gland. It clearly participates in cell adhesion, is strongly implicated as a messenger of cell fate determination during embryonic development and is now established as a key factor in the generation and survival of alveolar progenitors. In the mouse, ectopic elevation of β-catenin levels induces mammary hyperplasia, metaplasia, and neoplasia in a fashion that supports a strong link between the misactivation of developmental pathways and tumor progression. Despite the high degree of conservation of Wnt/catenin signaling, issues concerning the cell-type specific contextual readout and the physiological relevance of many putative target genes of these pathways remain largely unresolved. The increasing availability of genetically engineered mice with mammary phenotypes will permit dissection of these pathways, thereby providing a physiological framework within which the links between mammary development and the etiology of human breast cancer can be understood.
