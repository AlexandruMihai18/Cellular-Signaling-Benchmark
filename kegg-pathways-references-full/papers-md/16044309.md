Abstract Many physiological functions rely on the exact maintenance of body Ca²⁺ balance. Therefore, the extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration is tightly regulated by the concerted actions of intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption, exchange of Ca²⁺ to and from bone, and renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption. Renal distal convoluted and connecting tubular cells as well as duodenal epithelial cells are unique in their ability to mediate transcellular (re)absorption of Ca²⁺ at large and highly variable rates. Two members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily, TRP vanilloid (TRPV) 5 and TRPV 6, are specialized epithelial Ca²⁺ channels responsible for the critical Ca²⁺ entry step in transcellular Ca²⁺ (re)absorption in intestine and kidney, respectively. Because transcellular Ca²⁺ transport is fine-tuned to the body's specific requirements, regulation of the transmembrane Ca²⁺ flux through TRPV 5/6 is of particular importance and has, therefore, to be conspicuously controlled. We present an overview of the current knowledge and recent advances concerning the coordinated regulation of Ca²⁺ influx through the epithelial Ca²⁺ channels TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 in transcellular Ca²⁺ (re)absorption.

muscle contraction and bone formation. Extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration is regulated by a homeostatic mechanism tightly controlling the concerted actions of intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption, exchange of Ca²⁺ to and from bone and renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption [1]. Renal distal convoluted (DCT) and connecting tubular (CNT) cells as well as intestinal epithelial cells are unique in their ability to mediate transcellular transport of Ca²⁺ between the luminal and basolateral compartments, whereas the free cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration is generally maintained at low resting values. The latter implies that these cells are capable of sustaining large rates of transcellular Ca²⁺ fluxes, dependent on the tight regulation of the plasma Ca²⁺ concentration, without interfering with intracellular signalling. This transport is mediated by Ca²⁺ entry across the apical membrane through the specialized epithelial Ca²⁺ channels, transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 and 6 (TRPV 5 and TRPV 6), intracellular buffering and facilitated diffusion bound to Ca²⁺-binding proteins (calbindins) and extrusion across the basolateral membrane by a Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX1) and/or plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase (Fig. 1) [1–3]. Regulation of Ca²⁺ influx across the luminal membrane through TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 is particularly important, because it occurs down a steep concentration gradient and, therefore, these channels are generally considered as the gatekeepers of transcellular Ca²⁺ transport.

Introduction

Maintenance of body Ca²⁺ homeostasis is of vital importance for many physiological functions including intracellular signalling processes, neuronal excitability,

Two unique TRP channels facilitating epithelial Ca²⁺ transport

The epithelial Ca²⁺ channel family is restricted to two distinct members, TRPV 5 and TRPV 6, which are juxtaposed on the human chromosome 7q 35 with a distance of only 22 kb, suggesting an evolutionary gene duplication event [4–6]. TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 were originally cloned from rabbit kidney and rat small intestine, respectively, and were identified in many additional species including fish, rabbit, rat, mouse and human [4, 7]. TRPV 5 and TRPV 6

Fig. 1 Transcellular Ca²⁺ transport in kidney and small intestine. Schematic representation of transcellular Ca²⁺ transport consisting of apical entry of Ca²⁺ through the epithelial Ca²⁺ channels transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 and 6 (TRPV5 and TRPV6), cytosolic diffusion bound to Ca²⁺-binding proteins (calbindins) and extrusion across the basolateral membrane by a Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX1) and/or a plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase (PMCA1b). Transcellular Ca²⁺ (re)absorption occurs in the distal convoluted and connecting tubules in kidney involving TRPV5 as well as in duodenum involving TRPV6.

are ~730 amino acids, along with a predicted molecular mass around 83 kDa, containing six transmembrane (TM) segments and large cytosolic N- and C-tails, the former containing ankyrin repeats (Fig. 2a). A short hydrophobic stretch between TM5 and TM6 was predicted to be the pore-forming region. Later studies showed that the six-TM unit is one of four subunits presumed to surround the central pore in a tetrameric configuration (Fig. 2b) [8]. Detailed expression and (co)localization studies suggested that TRPV5 comprises the epithelial Ca²⁺ channel predominantly involved in renal transcellular Ca²⁺ transport in DCT/CNT, whereas TRPV6 was postulated to mediate intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption [2, 9–11]. TRPV5 and TRPV6 are so far the only known highly Ca²⁺-selective channels in the TRP superfamily. Even the closely related TRPV subfamily members, which are all Ca²⁺ permeable, discriminate much less between divalent and monovalent cations [12–15]. Functional data on TRPV5 included ⁴⁵Ca²⁺ uptake measurements, electrophysiological data using voltage-clamp and patch-clamp experiments and fluorimetric measurements in several mammalian cell lines. In short, the permeation sequence for the TRPV5/6 pore is Ca²⁺ > barium (Ba²⁺) > strontium (Sr²⁺) > Mn²⁺, and the channels are inhibited in order of potency by lanthanum (La³⁺) > cadmium (Cd²⁺) > Mn²⁺. Permeability to Na⁺ was negligible in the situation where Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ were both present, whereas Ba²⁺ and Sr²⁺ did not affect the Ca²⁺ influx. We have demonstrated that the molecular determinants of the Ca²⁺ selectivity and permeation of TRPV5/6 reside at a single aspartate residue (TRPV5-D542 and TRPV6-D541) present in the pore-forming region [16, 17]. A nearly complete inward rectification is another characteristic hallmark of the TRPV5/6 channels in addition to the high Ca²⁺ selectivity. This intrinsic rectification of the channels is significantly reduced by neutralization of D542/D541, indicating that this site is also involved in rectification [17]. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that the characteristics of TRPV6 are roughly comparable to those measured for TRPV5. However, differences exist with respect to Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation, Ba²⁺ selectivity and sensitivity for inhibition by the potent channel blocker ruthenium red. Importantly, the current through TRPV5 and TRPV6 is carried exclusively by Ca²⁺ at physiological extracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations. Thus, the functional properties of TRPV5 and TRPV6 and their in vivo localization are in line with a role in epithelial Ca²⁺ (re)absorption, providing the first line of evidence that these channels are responsible for the Ca²⁺ influx step in the process of transcellular Ca²⁺ transport [18, 19].

Subsequently, TRPV5 knockout (TRPV5⁻/⁻) mice were generated in our laboratory by ablation of the TRPV5 gene to substantiate the in vivo function of this channel in Ca²⁺ (re)absorption [6]. TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice showed robust renal Ca²⁺ wasting, and micropuncture experiments were performed to pinpoint the defective

site of Ca²⁺ reabsorption along the nephron (Fig. 3a). Quantitative free-flow collections of tubular fluid revealed unaffected Ca²⁺ absorption up to the last loop of the late proximal tubule, whereas Ca²⁺ delivery to puncturing sites within DCT/CNT was significantly enhanced. Because K⁺ secretion occurs along the distal part of the nephron, the luminal K⁺ concentration serves as an indicator of the collection site in the distal convolution. The inverse relationship between distal luminal K⁺ concentration and fractional Ca²⁺ delivery indicated that active Ca²⁺ reabsorption in DCT/CNT is effectively abolished in TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice (Fig. 3b). In addition, the expression of proteins involved in transcellular Ca²⁺ transport, downstream from apical Ca²⁺ entry through TRPV5, was significantly reduced (Fig. 3c). In contrast, TRPV5 mRNA expression levels were not affected in calbindin-D₂₈K knockout mice [20, 21]. Taken together, these findings confirm the crucial role of TRPV5 as the gatekeeper of renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption. Furthermore, TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice displayed a compensatory intestinal Ca²⁺ hyperabsorption accompanied by significantly enhanced duodenal TRPV6 expression (Fig. 3d, e). These data suggest that, in contrast to the kidney, TRPV6 is predominantly involved in Ca²⁺ absorption in the small intestine. Recently, Hedi- ger and co-workers evaluated the functional role of TRPV6 in Ca²⁺ absorption by inactivation of the mouse TRPV6 gene [22]. Initial data showed that TRPV6 knockout (TRPV6⁻/⁻) mice placed on a Ca²⁺-deficient diet display a consistent decrease in Ca²⁺ absorption over time. These data indicate that TRPV6 indeed constitutes the Ca²⁺-entry step in intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption. In addition, bone thickness was reduced in TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice [6]. This bone phenotype could either

result from the renal Ca²⁺ wasting or indicate a direct effect of TRPV5 ablation on bone, because TRPV5 was previously shown to be expressed in this tissue [23].

Regulation of epithelial Ca²⁺ channels

Transcellular Ca²⁺ transport is a highly coordinated and regulated process, which can be fine-tuned to the body’s specific requirements. In line with their central role in the aforementioned process, TRPV5/6 expression and channel activity has to be conspicuously controlled. This regulation occurs at different levels, including (1) transcriptional and translational regulation, (2) the tetrametric channel stoichiometry, (3) trafficking of channels to and from the plasma membrane and (4) modulation of channel activity at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4).

Transcriptional and translational regulation

Parathyroid hormone

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the biologically active form of vitamin D [1,25-(OH)₂D₃] are the main calcitropic hormones controlling Ca²⁺ balance [1, 24, 25]. The parathyroid gland plays a key role through the capacity to sense minute changes in the extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration. Upon a decrease in the extracellular Ca²⁺ level, PTH is secreted into the circulation, and then acts primarily on the kidney and bone, where it activates the PTH/PTHrP receptor [26]. Early studies using micropuncture and cell preparations demonstrated that PTH directly stimulates active Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the distal part of the nephron [27, 28]. In addition to

enhancing tubular Ca$^{2+}$ reabsorption, PTH stimulates the activity of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D$_3$-1$\alpha$-hydroxylase (1$\alpha$-OHase), a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of 1,25-(OH)$_2$D$_3$ and, thereby, increases the 1,25-(OH)$_2$D$_3$-dependent absorption of Ca$^{2+}$ in the small intestine [29]. Preliminary studies from our lab demonstrated that parathyroidectomy in rats results in decreased serum PTH levels and hypocalcaemia, which was accompanied by decreased TRPV5 mRNA levels and protein abundance [30]. Supplementation with PTH restored serum Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations and TRPV5 abundance in kidney, suggesting that PTH affects renal Ca$^{2+}$ handling through the regulation of TRPV5. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of PTH on TRPV5/6 expression in more detail.

Vitamin D

Various studies have provided evidence that the expression of TRPV5 and TRPV6 is tightly controlled by 1,25-(OH)$_2$D$_3$ [31–42]. Analysis of putative promoter regions of human and murine TRPV5/6 genes revealed potential vitamin D-response elements [32, 41]. Studies in several cell models suggested that 1,25-(OH)$_2$D$_3$ enhances epithelial Ca$^{2+}$ channel expression [38, 40]. Woods et al. [40] showed that upon addition of 1,25-(OH)$_2$D$_3$ to Caco-2 cells, TRPV6 expression is enhanced within 24 h, preceding an increase in calbindin expression levels. In vivo, the vitamin D sensitivity of epithelial Ca$^{2+}$ channel expression was first determined when repletion of vitamin D-depleted rats normalized the plasma Ca$^{2+}$ concentration and increased the amount of TRPV5 mRNA and protein expression in the kidney [32]. In mice, a single dose of 1,25-(OH)$_2$D$_3$ up-regulated renal TRPV5 mRNA expression and TRPV6 mRNA levels in duodenum, illustrating the genomic vitamin D response [34, 41]. Time-dependent studies following a single dose of 1,25-(OH)$_2$D$_3$ showed that induction of duodenal TRPV6 mRNA occurs within 3–6 h and precedes the stimulation of intestinal Ca$^{2+}$ absorption [35]. Several

genetically modified mouse models in which vitamin D regulation was inactivated were used to further study the regulation of TRPV5/6 by 1,25-(OH)₂D₃. In vitamin D receptor (VDR) knockout mice, duodenal TRPV6 mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated and associated with decreased intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption and hypocalcemia [34, 43]. Targeted ablation of 1α-OHase in mice, resulting in impairment of 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ biosynthesis, was shown to result in severe hypocalcemia and down-regulation of both renal TRPV5 and intestinal TRPV6 expression. Repletion with 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ restored Ca²⁺ channel expression levels and normalized serum Ca²⁺ levels. Furthermore, additional studies demonstrated differential up-regulation of TRPV5/6 by vitamin D analogues, which were developed in an effort to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism without the hypercalcemic side-effects of conventional vitamin D treatment [44]. In particular, the time course of up-regulation of TRPV5/6 correlated with serum levels of active vitamin D metabolites. Thus, the ameliorated calcemic effects appeared to result from differential stimulation of Ca²⁺ channel expression. Taken together, the transcriptional and translational regulation of TRPV5 and TRPV6 by 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ was consistently established.

**Dietary Ca²⁺**

In addition to the calciotropic hormones, there are indications that Ca²⁺ itself can affect TRPV5/6 expression. It is, however, difficult to study the effects of, e.g., hypocalcemia, without affecting serum 1,25-(OH)₂D₃

levels. In an effort to surpass this interrelationship, studies were performed in VDR⁻/⁻ and 1α-OHase⁻/⁻ mice fed normal and high-Ca²⁺-rescue diets [31, 34]. Importantly, high dietary Ca²⁺ intake restored the reduced expression levels of renal TRPV5 and intestinal TRPV6 in 1α-OHase⁻/⁻ mice, which was accompanied by normalization of the plasma Ca²⁺. Furthermore, Dardenne et al. showed that these effects cured rickets and osteomalacia, a hallmark of 1α-OHase⁻/⁻ mice, resulting in a partial rescue of the bone phenotype [45]. In contrast, the Ca²⁺-enriched rescue diet reduced the expression of renal TRPV5 and calbindin-D₂₈K in wild-type (1α-OHase⁺/⁻) mice that exhibit normal serum vitamin D and Ca²⁺ levels [31, 33, 34]. The latter illustrated the physiological mechanism whereby plasma Ca²⁺ acts via a negative feedback mechanism, eventually leading to the suppression of 1α-OHase activity, which decreases expression of Ca²⁺ transport proteins and Ca²⁺ reabsorption. Similarly, dietary rescue of the hypocalcemic state in VDR⁻/⁻ mice up-regulated the significantly decreased duodenal TRPV6 mRNA expression, whereas in wild-type mice high dietary Ca²⁺ content decreased TRPV6 expression due to a decrease of serum 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ [34]. Thus, these studies showed that Ca²⁺ supplementation can up-regulate TRPV5/6 gene transcription in the absence of circulating 1,25-(OH)₂D₃. Hypothetically, Ca²⁺-responsive elements are present in the TRPV5/6 promoter regions, but detailed promoter analyses are needed to investigate this vitamin D-independent Ca²⁺-sensitive regulation of TRPV5 and TRPV6.
Oestrogens and androgens

It is generally accepted that oestrogens affect Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Postmenopausal oestrogen deficiency is associated with increased renal Ca²⁺ loss, which can be corrected by oestrogen replacement therapy [46, 47]. Furthermore, oestrogen receptors were shown to reside in DCT/CNT [48]. Van Abel et al. [48, 49] showed that in ovariectomized rats and 1α-OH⁻/⁻ mice, 17β-estradiol replacement therapy results in up-regulation of renal TRPV5 mRNA and protein levels as well as duodenal TRPV6 mRNA expression, accompanied by normalization of plasma Ca²⁺ levels. These data demonstrated that oestrogens regulate the expression of TRPV5/6 in a 1,25-(OH)₂D₃-independent manner. Van Cromphaut and co-workers [50] reported that renal TRPV5 and duodenal TRPV6 expression was reduced in oestrogen receptor-α knockout mice and could be up-regulated by oestrogen treatment. Interestingly, Weber et al. [51] described an oestrogen-responsive element in the promoter sequence of the mouse TRPV6 gene, which was, however, absent or not conserved in the mouse TRPV5 gene. Taken together, oestrogen seems to harbour calciotropic hormone characteristics, which physiological relevance is readily exemplified by the increased risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In addition, TRPV6 was shown to be expressed in murine prostate tissue, being up-regulated in prostate cancer cell lines and in vivo in prostate carcinoma correlating with tumour grade [52–54]. Peng and co-workers [52] showed that TRPV6 expression is particularly increased in androgen-sensitive as compared to androgen-insensitive prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines. Di-hydrotestosteron and androgen-receptor antagonists were shown to regulate TRPV6 in these cell lines. Thus, in addition to oestrogens, androgens also appear to regulate TRPV6 expression. However, it is unclear whether androgens control duodenal TRPV6 expression and intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption. Fixemer and co-workers [55] showed that TRPV6 expression is absent in normal human prostate tissue, benign prostate hyperplasia and premalignant prostatic lesions. However, TRPV6 expression correlated with clinical progression scores, pathological stage and extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer, suggesting TRPV6 could be used as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer.

Immunosuppressive agents

Various drugs used in clinical practice are known to affect Ca²⁺ homeostasis, among which immunosuppressants like the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporine A as well as glucocorticoids such as prednisone and dexamethasone. These drugs are associated with an increased bone turnover, a negative Ca²⁺ balance and hypercalciuria [56–58]. Recently, we showed that FK506 treatment in mice reduced renal TRPV5 mRNA and protein expression associated with

renal Ca²⁺ wasting, suggesting that down-regulation of Ca²⁺ channel abundance provides the molecular mechanism for FK506-induced hypercalciuria [59]. The immunosuppressive action of tacrolimus depends on the inhibition of the Ca²⁺-dependent phosphatase calcineurin in T lymphocytes [60–62]. Calcineurin is not known to be involved in renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption, but another calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A, increased urinary Ca²⁺ excretion and decreased calbindin-D₂₈K protein levels [63, 64]. This suggested that calcineurin inhibition may play a role in the impairment of Ca²⁺ reabsorption by this class of drugs. In addition, tacrolimus binds to intracellular immunophilins called FKBP4 [65–68]. Of note, microarray analysis showed that FKBP4 was regulated by 1α-OHase ablation and Ca²⁺ supplementation in 1α-OHase⁻/⁻ mice [69]. In contrast to FK506, the glucocorticoid agent dexamethasone increased renal TRPV5 as well as duodenal TRPV6 expression, suggesting that stimulation of corticoid receptors positively affects TRPV5/6 transcription, counteracting the negative Ca²⁺ balance during treatment with these compounds.

Thiazide diuretics

Thiazide diuretics are among the most commonly prescribed drugs employed in the treatment of arterial hypertension. These diuretics enhance renal Na⁺ excretion through inhibition of the Na⁺/Cl⁻ cotransporter (NCC) present in the apical membrane of DCT cells [70]. In addition, these drugs are known to induce hypocalciuria and mutations in the gene encoding NCC were shown to cause Gitelman's syndrome, a recessive disorder with a phenotype resembling chronic thiazide administration including hypocalciuria [1, 71–80]. The hypocalciuric effect was suggested to result from direct stimulation of transcellular Ca²⁺ transport and, in particular, apical Ca²⁺ entry through TRPV5 [81–85]. Alternatively, hypocalciuria was proposed to result from enhancement of passive paracellular Ca²⁺ reabsorption in proximal tubules secondary to extracellular volume (ECV) contraction, distinct from any effect on transcellular Ca²⁺ transport [78, 86, 87]. Previously, we reported that thiazide-induced hypocalciuria occurs in spite of reduced renal expression of Ca²⁺ transport proteins in rat [78]. In addition, we showed that ECV contraction mimics the hypocalciuria, and volume repletion completely reverses thiazide-induced hypocalciuria in these rats. We recently demonstrated in micropuncture experiments that reabsorption of Na⁺ and, importantly, Ca²⁺ in the proximal tubule is increased during chronic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) treatment, whereas Ca²⁺ reabsorption in DCT/CNT appeared unaffected [88]. Furthermore, we showed that chronic HCTZ administration still induces hypocalciuriain TRPV5$^{-/-}$ mice, in which active Ca$^{2+}$ reabsorption is abolished. HCTZ did not affect renal expression of the proteins involved in active Ca$^{2+}$ transport, including TRPV5 mRNA and protein expression in wild-type mice. Lee et al. confirmed that thiazide treatment in mice does not affect renal TRPV5 expression, except when thiazide treatment is combined with salt repletion [89]. However, salt repletion alone induced TRPV5 mRNA expression to a similar extent, suggesting that this effect is not thiazide-specific. Loffing and co-workers [90, 91] recently demonstrated that renal TRPV5 expression is unaffected in NCC knockout mice, an animal model for Gitelman's syndrome. In accordance, micropuncture experiments in these mice showed that active Ca$^{2+}$ reabsorption is unaltered in DCT/CNT and indicated increased fractional absorption of both Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ upstream of DCT [91]. These studies demonstrated that thiazides do not directly affect TRPV5 expression and transcellular Ca$^{2+}$ reabsorption, whereas increased passive Ca$^{2+}$ reabsorption in the proximal tubule explains the Ca$^{2+}$-sparing during thiazide treatment and Gitelman's syndrome.

Tetrameric channel stoichiometry

Assembly domains

Another level at which epithelial Ca$^{2+}$ channels may be regulated is during the assembly into a functional channel complex. By analogy with other cation channel subunits comprising six transmembrane domains, TRP members are hypothesized to assemble into homo- and/or heterotetrameric complexes. Niemeyer et al. [92] identified the third ankyrin repeat being a stringent requirement for physical assembly of TRPV6 subunits. Subsequent studies by our group showed that at least two regions in the cytosolic tails are involved in channel assembly [93]. Physical interactions between the N-tail/N-tail, N-tail/C-tail and C-tail/C-tail were demonstrated by pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitations. TRPV5 truncants lacking either the N-tail or C-tail showed dominant-negative effects on channel activity. Detailed mapping assays identified two critical regions in the N-tail and C-tail involved in assembly which, when mutated, abolished the interactions between the tails. In addition, the identified N-tail assembly domain included an ankyrin repeat, substantiating the involvement of these protein-protein binding modules in TRPV5 assembly. The importance of both the N and C termini in TRPV channel oligomerization, including TRPV5 and TRPV6, was recently confirmed by Hellwig et al. [94].

Heterotetrameric TRPV5/6 channels

Recently, we confirmed by co-immunoprecipitations and molecular mass determination of TRPV5 and TRPV6 complexes using sucrose gradient sedimentation that

these channels can indeed form homo- and heterotetrameric channel complexes [8]. Because TRPV5 and TRPV6 exhibit different channel kinetics, the influence of the heterotetramer composition on channel properties was investigated [8]. When concatemeric channels were constructed consisting of four TRPV5 and/or TRPV6 subunits, differences in the ratio of TRPV5 and TRPV6 subunits resulted in mixed properties of TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels [8]. Recently, Hellwig and co-workers showed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation experiments that, whereas the other TRPV channels preferentially form homotetramers, TRPV5 and TRPV6 seem to be unique in forming heterotetramers [94]. Thus, regulation of the relative expression levels of TRPV5 and TRPV6 may be a mechanism to fine-tune the Ca$^{2+}$ transport kinetics in TRPV5/6-co-expressing tissues. Indeed, several studies indicated that certain tissues co-express TRPV5 and TRPV6, including kidney and small intestine, which would allow oligomerization of these channels in vivo [1, 10, 41, 95]. Recently, Clapham and co-workers produced an extensive analysis of TRP channel tissue distribution, showing that TRPV5 and TRPV6 are co-expressed in brain, kidney, pancreas, small intestine, colon, prostate and testis (http://www.clapham.tch.harvard.edu).

Trafficking to the plasma membrane

S100A10-annexin 2 complex

Accurate trafficking of channels and transporters to the plasma membrane is essential for transcellular ion transport. Van de graaf et al. [96] provided the first evidence of a regulatory role for the S100A10-annexin 2 heterotetramer in the trafficking of TRPV5 and TRPV6. S100A10, a 97-amino acid protein member of the S100 superfamily, was identified as an associated protein of TRPV5 and TRPV6 using the yeast two-hybrid technique. S100A10 is found tightly associated with annexin 2, a member of the Ca$^{2+}$ and phospholipids-binding proteins which is implicated in numerous biological processes including exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane-cytoskeleton interactions [97]. The association of S100A10 with TRPV5 and TRPV6 was restricted to a short conserved peptide sequence located in the C-tail of these channels. The first threonine of this sequence was identified as a crucial amino acid for binding and channel function. When this particular threonine was mutated, the activity of TRPV5 and TRPV6 was abolished accompanied by a major disturbance in their subcellular localization. This indicated that the S100A10-annexin 2 heterotetramer facilitates the translocation of TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels towards the plasma membrane. The importance of annexin 2 in this process was demonstrated by showing that small interfering RNA-based down-regulation of annexin 2 significantly inhibits TRPV5 and TRPV6 currents. The latter demonstrated that annexin 2 in conjunction withS100A10 is crucial for TRPV5 and TRPV6 activity. Interestingly, S100A10 as well as annexin 2 appear to be regulated by 1,25-(OH)₂D₃, further supporting the importance of the S100A10-annexin-2 complex in the regulation of 1,25-(OH)₂D₃-dependent TRPV5/6-mediated Ca²⁺ influx [96, 98].

Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger regulating factor 2 and serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase

Embark and co-workers [99, 100] recently demonstrated that TRPV5 activity is increased upon co-expression with the Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger regulating factor 2 (NHERF2) and the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1) in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Using GST pull-down and overlay assays, the specific interaction of NHERF2 with the last three amino acids in the C-tail of TRPV5 was demonstrated (S.F. van de Graaf, unpublished results). This suggested that the NHERF2/SGK1 protein pair affects TRPV5 in a direct fashion via protein-protein interaction. The last three amino acids of TRPV5 resemble a PDZ motif, which allows binding to PDZ domain-harbouring proteins, including NHERF2. Of note, co-expression of SGK1 with NHERF2 stimulated the activity of the renal outer medullary K⁺ channel (ROMK1), a K⁺ channel involved in renal K⁺ handling, by stabilization of ROMK1 in the plasma membrane [101, 102]. Currently, it is not known whether an identical mechanism is applicable for TRPV5. It is tempting to speculate that a stimulatory effect on TRPV5 trafficking towards the plasma membrane reflects SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV5, but this also remains to be demonstrated.

Modulation of TRPV5/6 channel activity at the plasma membrane

Ca²⁺-dependent feedback inhibition

In mammalian cells heterogeneously overexpressing the epithelial Ca²⁺ channels, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are constitutively open at a low-intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration and a negative membrane potential [103]. Extrapolating these findings to the in vivo situation suggests that additional regulatory factors or at least an increased Ca²⁺ buffer capacity is a necessity for TRPV5/6-expressing cells, in particular because TRPV5 and TRPV6 are controlled by Ca²⁺-dependent feedback inhibition. Both Ca²⁺ channels rapidly inactivate during hyperpolarizing voltage-steps and this inhibition is reduced when Ca²⁺ is substituted for Ba²⁺ or Sr²⁺ as charge carriers. The inactivation is dependent on the extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration and also occurs in cells buffered intracellularly with 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid [103]. Ca²⁺ influx is a prerequisite for this phenomenon because the Ca²⁺-impermeable D542A TRPV5 mutant lacks a monovalent current decay in response to repetitive stimulation [104]. These data suggested that TRPV5/6 activity is inhibited by Ca²⁺ influx through the channel, most likely by increasing the Ca²⁺ concentration in a microdomain near the pore region, thereby inducing feedback inhibition of the channel. This could be a crucial mechanism for the regulation of TRPV5 and TRPV6 at the plasma membrane under physiological conditions. Considering the high affinity mechanism of Ca²⁺-dependent TRPV5/6 inhibition, the presence of intracellular Ca²⁺ buffering proteins such as calbindins, is of pivotal importance to maintain channel activity [18, 105, 106].

Calmodulin

Ca²⁺-dependent regulation is not restricted to TRPV5/6, but also occurs in L-type and P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, where facilitation and inactivation of the current is mediated by the ubiquitously expressed Ca²⁺-sensor calmodulin (CaM) [107, 108]. Niemeyer et al. [107] showed that CaM binds to the C-tail of human TRPV6 in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner. In addition, Nilius et al. [109] demonstrated that the rabbit TRPV5 C-tail is important for the Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation process. Recently, CaM was shown to bind to the CaM-binding motifs in the C- and N-tails of TRPV5 and TRPV6 as well as the transmembrane domain of TRPV6 in a Ca²⁺-dependent fashion [110, 111]. Electrophysiological measurements of HEK293 cells heterologously co-expressing Ca²⁺-insensitive CaM mutants along with TRPV5 or TRPV6 revealed a significantly reduced inward Ca²⁺ current through TRPV6, whereas no effect was demonstrated on TRPV5. This effect was localized to the high Ca²⁺-affinity EF-hand structures of CaM. Thus, these data demonstrated a regulatory role of CaM in TRPV6-mediated Ca²⁺ influx. It remains to be established whether CaM functions as a general Ca²⁺ sensor in TRPV5/6 channels or, alternatively, might explain the differences in Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation between TRPV5 and TRPV6.

80K-H

In an effort to identify novel regulators of Ca²⁺ reabsorption by TRPV5, we used cDNA microarray analysis which identified the protein kinase C substrate 80K-H as a potential associated protein [110]. In a recent study, we demonstrated a specific interaction between 80K-H and TRPV5 and showed that a highly conserved short peptide sequence in the TRPV5 C-tail was necessary for 80K-H binding [110]. Furthermore, 80K-H was shown to bind Ca²⁺ directly and inactivation of its two EF-hand structures totally abolished Ca²⁺ binding. Electrophysiological studies using 80K-H mutants showed that three domains of 80K-H (the two EF-hand structures, a highly acidic glutamic stretch and a His-Asp-Glu-Leu sequence) are critical determinants for TRPV5 activity. Importantly, inactivation of the EF-hand pair
reduced the TRPV5-mediated Ca²⁺ current and increased the TRPV5 sensitivity for intracellular Ca²⁺, accelerating the feedback inhibition of the channel. None of the 80K-H mutants altered the TRPV5 plasma membrane localization or the association of 80K-H with TRPV5, suggesting that 80K-H has a direct effect on TRPV5 activity at the plasma membrane. It was shown that both proteins co-localized in the distal part of the nephron, indicating that regulation of TRPV5 by 80K-H could occur in vivo. Furthermore, parallel transcriptional regulation of both proteins by 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ and dietary Ca²⁺ was demonstrated [112]. Taken together, 80K-H might act as novel Ca²⁺ sensor controlling TRPV5 channel activity at the plasma membrane.

$pH$

It is well known that metabolic acidosis and alkalosis influence Ca²⁺ homeostasis and studies using primary cultures of rabbit CNT and cortical collecting duct cells indicated that acidification of the apical medium inhibits transcellular Ca²⁺ absorption [2, 113, 114]. Therefore, pH might directly influence TRPV5/6 channel activity at the apical plasma membrane. Indeed, TRPV5 expressing *X. laevis* oocytes showed decreased ⁴⁵Ca²⁺ uptake when the incubation medium was acidified and extracellular acidification significantly reduced currents through TRPV5 [115]. In addition, extracellular pH also affected current kinetics including extracellular Mg²⁺ blockade and Ca²⁺ affinity. The mean current density decreased at acidic pH and increased at alkaline pH. Recently, Yeh and co-workers [115] showed that mutation of the Glu residue at position 522 to Gln near the pore helix decreased the inhibition of TRPV5 by extracellular acidification. This Glu-522 in the extracellular loop between TM5 and the pore region, appears to mediate pH sensitivity and, therefore, acts as the pH sensor in TRPV5. The exact mechanism explaining these effects, possibly by a conformational change upon titration of this amino acid or owing to the neutralization of its negative charge, is unknown. Alternatively, pH could also affect channel insertion and/or retrieval from the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data suggest that the luminal pH directly regulates Ca²⁺ entry through the epithelial Ca²⁺ channels in vivo.

Conclusion and future directions

This review has focused on the unique characteristics and regulation of the two most Ca²⁺-selective TRP members, TRPV5 and TRPV6. These channels facilitate the Ca²⁺ entry step in transcellular Ca²⁺ (re)absorption in kidney and intestine, and thereby determine the net Ca²⁺ flux to the extracellular compartment. Regulation of the membrane permeability for Ca²⁺ through TRPV5 and TRPV6 is of particular physiological importance, and we have presented an overview of the current knowledge of these regulatory processes. The transcriptional and translational regulation by 1,25-(OH)₂D₃, PTH, dietary Ca²⁺, oestrogens and the influence of drugs were established over the last years. Data on the mechanisms and importance of channel assembly and trafficking to the plasma membrane, including the role of auxiliary proteins, were recently investigated. The complex process from gene transcription to activation of channels at the plasma membrane remains, however, incompletely understood. Because the regulation at several discrete levels has now been demonstrated, future studies should focus on establishing a comprehensive and integrated model of TRPV5/6 regulation and transcellular Ca²⁺ transport. Consequently, processes including trafficking of channels towards and from the plasma membrane have to be studied in detail. The role of the epithelial Ca²⁺ channels in human disease also remains to be defined. The phenotypes of TRPV5⁻/⁻ and TRPV6⁻/⁻ mice, including a profound renal Ca²⁺ leak and disturbed intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption, suggest that these channels are interesting candidate genes for several disorders including genetic hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis and Ca²⁺ malabsorption syndromes. Finally, the significant bone abnormalities in TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice, along with the demonstration of TRPV5 and TRPV6 expression in bone, suggest that these epithelial Ca²⁺ channels have additional physiological functions in bone dynamics.
