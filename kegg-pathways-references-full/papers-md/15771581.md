■ Abstract The Tec family tyrosine kinases are now recognized as important mediators of antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes. Three members of this family, Itk, Rlk, and Tec, are expressed in T cells and activated in response to T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. Although initial studies demonstrated a role for these proteins in TCR-mediated activation of phospholipase C-$\gamma$, recent data indicate that Tec family kinases also regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular adhesion following TCR stimulation. In addition, Tec family kinases are activated downstream of G protein-coupled chemokine receptors, where they play parallel roles in the regulation of Rho GTPases, cell polarization, adhesion, and migration. In all these systems, however, Tec family kinases are not essential signaling components, but instead function to modulate or amplify signaling pathways. Although they quantitatively reduce proximal signaling, mutations that eliminate Tec family kinases in T cells nonetheless qualitatively alter T cell development and differentiation.

INTRODUCTION

The Tec family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have recently emerged as key regulators of signaling pathways in T lymphocytes. The importance of this family was first established in 1993 when mutations affecting Btk were found to be associated with the human genetic disorder X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) and the murine mutant X-linked immunodeficiency ($xid$), immunodeficiencies associated with decreased serum immunoglobulins and impaired B cell development (1–4).${}^{1}$ XLA provided the first example of mutations affecting a tyrosine kinase linked to a primary human immunodeficiency, highlighting the importance of tyrosine kinases

for antigen receptor signaling pathways and their roles in lymphocyte development and function.

The Tec family of kinases now consists of five family members, which are expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells: Tec, Btk, Itk (also known as Tsk and Emt), Rlk (also known as Txk), and Bmx (also known as Etk). Additional related Tec family kinases have been found in *Drosophila melanogaster*, zebrafish (*Danio rerio*), skate (*Raja eglanteria*), and sea urchin (*Anthocidaris crassispina*) (5). Although the Tec family kinases resemble Src family kinases, having tyrosine kinase catalytic and Src homology protein interaction domains, they are notable in that most family members possess a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to the products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The Tec family kinases are the only tyrosine kinases that possess PH domains and that can be regulated by PI3K. In T lymphocytes, three major Tec kinases are expressed: Itk, Rlk, and Tec, all of which are tyrosine phosphorylated upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation (6–9).

Although mutations of the Tec family kinases have not yet been associated with T cell defects in humans, in mice mutations affecting Itk or Itk and Rlk lead to decreased responses to TCR stimulation, including proliferation, IL-2 production, and production of effector cytokines (10–14). Mutations affecting these kinases are thus associated with a variety of biochemical defects downstream of TCR signaling (10, 11, 13, 15), as well as with impaired thymic development (12, 16, 17) and altered mature T cell effector functions (14, 17, 18). In this review, we cover the structure and mechanism of activation of Tec family kinases, the roles of Tec kinases in T lymphocyte signaling pathways, and the functional importance of these molecules for lymphocyte development and immune responses.

## EXPRESSION OF THE TEC KINASES IN LYMPHOCYTES

T lymphocytes express at least three Tec family kinases: Itk, Rlk, and Tec. Additionally, one report (19) mentions that Bmx/Etk expression can be detected in the Jurkat lymphoma cell line. Each of the three major T cell Tec family kinases exhibits distinct patterns and levels of expression that may reflect their functional importance in different T cell subsets and stages of development.

Itk (inducible T cell kinase; also known as Emt, expressed in mast cells and T lymphocytes, and Tsk, T cell-specific kinase) is the predominant Tec kinase in T cells and was first cloned by degenerate PCR of T cell-specific tyrosine kinases (20–24). At least two forms of Itk have been cloned from mouse, which vary by inclusion or deletion of a sequence encoding six amino acids (20, 21, 24). The longer version, which appears to be a splice variant, is not detected in human cells. Itk expression is found in thymocytes and mature T cells, mast cells, natural killer cells, and NKT cells, with the highest levels of expression in the mature adult thymus (20, 21, 23, 24). Expression of Itk is induced upon T cell activation and treatment with IL-2 (20, 22, 23). Two recent reports demonstrate higher levels of Itk mRNA and protein in Th2 cells relative to Th1 cells, perhaps reflecting Itk's

importance in the development of Th2 responses (25, 26). Mature T cells and thymocytes from mice deficient in Itk show impaired activation of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), defective actin reorganization, and multiple functional defects in response to TCR stimulation (10–15, 17, 27, 28).

Rlk (resting lymphocyte kinase; also known as Txk) was also cloned in degenerate PCR screens for novel tyrosine kinases expressed in T lymphocytes (29–32). Like Itk, Rlk expression is found in thymocytes, mature resting T cells, and mast cells (31, 32). Real-time RT-PCR demonstrates that Rlk mRNA is expressed at 3- to 10-fold lower levels than Itk in resting mature T cells (25, 26). Expression of Rlk drops dramatically upon T cell receptor stimulation (31, 32). Rlk expression increases again in primary differentiated Th1 cells and Th1 cell clones, but it remains very low in differentiated Th2 cells and cell clones (25, 26, 31, 33), suggesting that Rlk is functionally more important for Th1 cell function. Consistent with these observations, IL-12 was shown to increase and IL-4 to decrease expression of Rlk in peripheral blood CD4+ cells (33). Although two forms of Rlk have been detected, there are no clear differences in the ratio of these isoforms in different T cell populations (6). Mutation of *Rlk* leads to minimal T cell defects, yet it can exacerbate defects observed in Itk-deficient T cells (10, 11).

Tec (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma), the founding member of this family, was originally cloned from a mouse liver cDNA library. Tec has a more broad pattern of expression both in hematopoietic and other cell types (34). Tec is expressed at relatively low levels in resting T cells. Real-time RT-PCR studies suggest its mRNA is 100-fold lower than that of Itk. However, Tec expression is induced after stimulation of T cells for 2–3 days (35), suggesting that it may be more important for effector cell function or upon restimulation of preactivated cells. Like Itk, Tec is expressed at slightly higher levels (twofold) in Th2 cells than in Th1 cells (35). No functional defects have been reported to date in Tec-deficient T cells. However, in mouse B cells, mutation of Tec worsens defects associated with Btk deficiency (36), suggesting functional redundancy with other family members. Multiple splice forms of Tec have been reported (37), but their functional differences in T cells remain unknown.

Of note, Btk, the most famous Tec family kinase, is broadly expressed in most hematopoietic cells, but it is not expressed in T cells. For excellent reviews of the Tec kinases in other cell types, we refer the readers to References 38–40.

## DOMAIN STRUCTURES OF TEC KINASE FAMILY MEMBERS

The five mammalian Tec kinases share an overall similar domain organization that closely resembles the organization of the Src family tyrosine kinases (5) (Figure 1). Starting at the carboxy-terminus is the kinase domain, followed by a single Src homology (SH)-2 and then a single SH3 domain. At this point, the Tec kinase structures diverge from the Src family kinases. Specifically, at the amino-terminal

side of the SH3 domain, all Tec kinases except Bmx have a proline-rich region (PRR). Btk and Tec share a second tandem PRR, adjacent to a Zn²⁺-binding region known as the Btk homology (BH) motif. The BH motif is also found in Itk, adjacent to its single PRR. For Itk, Btk, and Tec, the combined Btk motif and the single or double PRRs are often referred to as the Tec homology (TH) domain. Finally, at the very amino-terminus of the protein, Itk, Btk, Tec, and Bmx share a PH domain, whereas Rlk contains a cysteine-string motif.

The individual functions of each of these protein domains are well established. The kinase domains have catalytic activity for transferring phosphate onto tyrosine residues of substrate proteins. These domains share the conserved structural features of all catalytically active kinases, and in the cases of Btk and Itk, X-ray crystallographic data confirm the close similarity between the Btk and Itk kinase domains and those of the Src family kinases (41, 42).

The SH2, SH3, PRR, and BH domains all mediate protein-protein interactions that regulate the binding partners of the Tec kinases and thus determine their proximity to signaling complexes and potential substrates. Numerous independent biochemical approaches have been used to identify binding partners for these Tec family kinase domains, including pull-down assays with GST-fusion proteins, yeast two-hybrid assays, and the testing of candidate molecules initially identified as binding partners of proteins with related domains (Table 1). Overall, these strategies have yielded a substantial list of proteins that can interact with individual domains of Tec kinase family members, or in some cases with full-length Tec kinase proteins. Although not all these potential binding partners have been confirmed in

Figure 1 Domain structures and domain interactions of Tec family tyrosine kinases. (A) Tec family tyrosine kinases share an overall similar organizational structure to kinases of the Src family (bottom). (B) Among the Tec family kinases found in T cells, Itk has the most well-characterized domain structures and interactions. An intramolecular interaction between the Itk SH3 domain and PRR can occur. At higher protein concentrations, an intermolecular dimer formed by reciprocal interactions between the Itk SH2 and SH3 domains is favored over the intramolecular interaction seen in the monomer. In addition, the SH2 domain of Itk contains a proline residue that undergoes cis-trans isomerization, causing a global conformational change in the SH2 domain structure. In the cis form, the SH2 domain interacts preferentially with the Itk SH3 domain; in the trans form, the SH2 domain binds preferentially to phosphotyrosine-containing ligands, such as phospho-SLP-76, which also binds cooperatively to the Itk SH3 domain. Similarly to Itk, Tec can undergo an intramolecular association involving the Tec SH3 and PRR domains. However, the preferred structure for Tec is an intermolecular dimer formed by reciprocal interactions between SH3 and PRR regions on two different Tec molecules. For Rlk, intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and PRR regions does not occur; instead, Rlk only forms a symmetric homodimer via intermolecular SH3-PRR interactions. The arrows represent likely interconversions between protein conformations, with the dark arrow indicating the more favored conformation.

physiologically relevant assays, a significant number have. In the sections below, this review highlights the interactions that have garnered additional support from functional, as well as biochemical, assays.

The amino-terminal domains of all five mammalian Tec family kinases contain the major determinants of the subcellular localization of the proteins. For Itk, Btk, Tec, and Bmx, this region includes a PH domain that preferentially binds to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PI$_{(3,4,5)}$P$_3$) (43–46). As a result, the PH domain-containing Tec kinases are predominantly cytosolic in resting lymphocytes, where levels of PI$_{(3,4,5)}$P$_3$ are low. However, following activation, PI$_{(3,4,5)}$P$_3$ levels in the plasma membrane increase dramatically, leading to the recruitment of these kinases to the membrane. In contrast, Rlk lacks a PH domain; in addition, two isoforms of the Rlk protein are expressed in cells (6). The longer Rlk isoform contains a cysteine-string motif that becomes palmitoylated and recruits Rlk to the lipid raft compartment of the plasma membrane. The shorter form of Rlk lacks both a PH domain as well as the cysteine-string motif; this isoform of Rlk is constitutively localized in the nucleus when expressed in isolation.

RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ACTIVATION OF TEC KINASES IN T CELLS

Itk is Activated by Signaling through Multiple T Cell Surface Receptors

Tec kinases have been implicated in signaling downstream of a variety of receptors in multiple cell types. In T cells, the pathway most heavily studied is the activation of Tec kinases via signaling through the TCR. Initial studies, performed in Jurkat cells, demonstrated that Itk is tyrosine phosphorylated following TCR crosslinking (7, 9). Although the relevance of this phosphorylation could not be discerned from
these studies, the conclusion that Itk is involved in TCR signaling was generally accepted on the basis of the known role of Btk in BCR signaling (47). More definitive evidence that Itk functions as a transducer of TCR signals came from biochemical and cellular studies performed on T cells from Itk-deficient mice (12, 13). As shown first by D. Littman and colleagues (12), T cells lacking Itk are impaired in proliferative responses to TCR crosslinking but respond normally to pharmacological stimulation with a phorbol ester plus a calcium ionophore. These findings were then complemented by a later study demonstrating that TCR-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ1 are defective in T cells lacking Itk, firmly establishing Itk as an intermediate in the pathway from the TCR to PLC-γ1 (13).

In addition to a role in TCR signaling, Itk may be important in signaling downstream of the T cell costimulatory receptor CD28, according to several reports (48–53). These data primarily demonstrate biochemical interactions between Itk and CD28. The initial study on this topic showed that, following CD28 stimulation of Jurkat T cells, Itk binds to CD28 and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated (48). Further in vitro studies using recombinant proteins concluded that Itk binding to CD28 requires the presence of the Src family tyrosine kinase p56lck (Lck) (49), a finding that was then confirmed using Lck-deficient Jurkat T cells (50). Structure-function analysis of the tyrosine residues in the CD28 cytoplasmic tail also provided support for the close association between Lck and Itk activities following CD28 stimulation (51).

In an effort to map the binding interaction between Itk and CD28, R. Rottapel and colleagues (52) showed that the SH3 domain of Itk binds to proline-rich sequences in the CD28 cytoplasmic tail. Interestingly, this study also indicated that peptides corresponding to this region of CD28 would activate Itk kinase activity in vitro, providing a potential mechanism by which CD28 stimulation might activate a downstream tyrosine kinase (52). Finally, Itk was shown to phosphorylate all four tyrosine residues of the CD28 cytoplasmic tail in in vitro kinase assays (53), providing evidence for another potential role of Itk in CD28 signaling. However, despite this wealth of biochemical data, evidence substantiating a functional role for Itk in CD28 signaling is still lacking (see below).

Itk is also implicated in signaling downstream of the T cell surface receptor CD2. Like the studies of CD28 signaling, studies of Itk signaling demonstrate that Itk is tyrosine phosphorylated following CD2 crosslinking on Jurkat cells or peripheral blood T cells (54). Furthermore, Itk activation following CD2 stimulation requires the activity of Lck (54) and depends on the PRR of the CD2 cytoplasmic tail (55). Finally, studies in transfected Jurkat cells indicate that a kinase-inactive mutant of Itk can inhibit CD2-mediated activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor, as assessed by a reporter assay (56). Nonetheless, functional data substantiating a role for Itk in CD2 signaling in primary T cells is still lacking.

Two recent studies also report a role for Itk in signaling downstream of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (57, 58). Itk and Rlk tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as Itk translocation to the plasma membrane, are induced following chemokine
stimulation of T cells (57, 58). Similar to the activation of Itk downstream of the TCR, chemokine-induced Itk phosphorylation and membrane localization are inhibited by Src family kinase and PI3K inhibitors, respectively (57, 58). Moreover, these studies demonstrate defective cell migration, as well as impaired actin polymerization, in Itk-deficient T cells responding to SDF-1α (CXCL12). Interestingly, these defects are further diminished in the absence of both Itk and Rlk (58), suggesting that both Tec kinase family members contribute to chemokine responses in T cells.

# Rlk is Activated by TCR and Chemokine Receptor Signaling

Unlike Itk, Rlk's precise role in T cell signaling has been more difficult to discern. *Rlk*⁻/⁻ T cells show only mild impairments in TCR signaling, but the absence of both Itk and Rlk leads to a dramatic deficiency in TCR signaling compared with that observed in T cells lacking Itk alone (10, 11). These genetic data, suggesting that Rlk can contribute to the TCR signal transduction pathway, are complemented by biochemical data, indicating that Rlk is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to TCR stimulation and that this phosphorylation depends on a Src family kinase such as Lck (6, 59). Rlk has also been shown to phosphorylate SLP-76, a T cell adapter protein required for TCR signal transduction (60). Additional genetic data also indicate that ectopic expression of Rlk can replace Itk or Btk and restore functional antigen receptor signaling in either T cells or B cells, respectively (61, 62). However, as described above, *Rlk*⁻/⁻*Itk*⁻/⁻ T cells show greatly impaired responses to the chemokines SDF-1α and MIP3-β compared with *Itk*⁻/⁻ T cells, suggesting an additional role for Rlk in chemokine receptor signaling (58).

# In T Cells, Tec is Activated by TCR and CD28 Signaling

To date, experiments to determine the role of Tec in T cells have not provided a clear answer regarding whether Tec is required for TCR and CD28 signaling. Biochemical studies and assays based on transfection of Tec into Jurkat cells indicate that Tec is activated in response to TCR stimulation, and that Tec overexpression can potentiate TCR-mediated PLC-γ1 phosphorylation and NFAT activation (8, 35, 63). Like Itk, Tec is phosphorylated in response to CD28 crosslinking and associates with CD28 via an interaction between the Tec SH3 domain and a PRR in the CD28 cytoplasmic tail (8, 64). One functional study using an antisense approach showed that primary T cells that express reduced amounts of Tec produced less IL-2 than control antisense-treated T cells (63). Despite these data, T cells from Tec-deficient mice have no detectable defects in TCR or CD28 signaling (36). Thus, a more definitive conclusion concerning the role of Tec in T cells may require the generation and analysis of mice lacking both Tec and Itk, or Tec and Rlk.

Although the role of Tec in T cells has remained elusive, numerous studies have documented an important role of Tec in signaling downstream of cytokine receptors in other cell types. These data indicate that Tec is involved in signaling

downstream of the IL-3 receptor, the IL-5 receptor, the prolactin receptor, the ery-
thropoietin receptor, the G-CSF receptor, c-kit, and the IL-6 family of receptors
(using the shared receptor subunit gp130) (reviewed in 38–40, 65). Several studies
have also indicated that Tec is phosphorylated and activated by the Jak kinases that
are associated with these cytokine receptors (66, 67). One potential function of
Tec downstream of cytokine receptors is the activation of the guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF), Vav1, suggesting a role for Tec in cytoskeletal reorganiza-
tion in response to cytokines (68, 69). Interestingly, additional Tec kinase family
members, such as Btk and Bmx, are also implicated in cytokine receptor signaling
pathways (38, 39). Thus, the investigation of Tec kinases as potential mediators of
cytokine receptor signaling in T cells may be a fruitful area for future research.

# REGULATION OF TEC KINASE ACTIVITY
## BY SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION

Several critical components are required for the activation of Tec kinases down-
stream of cell surface receptors (Figure 2). These components include recruitment
of the kinase to the plasma membrane at the site of the activated receptor, colo-
calization of the kinase with receptor-associated adapter proteins and substrates,
and, finally, tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase by an upstream activator, most
frequently a Src family kinase. As far as is known, membrane recruitment is the
first step of activation.

## Membrane Localization via Pleckstrin Homology (PH)
### Domains is Regulated by PI3K Activity

For two of the Tec kinases present in T cells, Itk and Tec, membrane recruitment
is mediated by their amino-terminal PH domains. The importance of the PH do-
main was highlighted by the discovery that the naturally occurring *xid* defect in
mice results from a point mutation in the Btk PH domain (3, 4), a conclusion
subsequently reinforced by the finding of similar PH domain mutations as genetic
defects resulting in XLA in humans (70).

The PH domain generally consists of a β-barrel formed by two β-sheets, fol-
lowed by a carboxy-terminal α-helix (43, 71). As first shown for the PH domain
of Btk (43–45, 72), the PH domains of both Itk and Tec also bind to phospho-
inositides, with a preference for inositides phosphorylated at the D3 position of
the inositol ring (19, 43, 46). These findings initially suggested that Tec kinases
may be regulated by the activity of PI3K, a suggestion that has been verified in
a number of studies (19, 46, 63, 73–75). The importance of PI3K activity for
Itk and Tec activation in response to TCR stimulation is also highlighted by the
requirement for the Rho family GTP exchange factor Vav1 in this process (76).
This requirement is attributed to the role of Vav1 in TCR-induced PI3K activation,
which is potentially mediated by the small GTPase Rac1, a known target of the
Vav1 exchange factor activity (76).

Figure 2 Mechanisms of activation and inactivation of Tec family kinases downstream of surface receptors, such as the TCR. The activation of Tec family tyrosine kinases downstream of T cell surface receptors requires at least three distinct steps: (A) Localization of the kinase to the plasma membrane at the site of the activated receptor. For Itk and Tec, this localization requires the PH domain and depends on receptor-mediated activation of PI3K and generation of PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\). For Rlk, membrane localization is mediated by palmitoylation of the cysteine-string motif and is independent of PI3K activity; (B) transphosphorylation of the kinase by a Src family kinase, such as Lck; (C) association of the kinase with adapter proteins, such as SLP-76, GADS, and LAT, that form a complex in response to receptor stimulation. The precise order of these steps in the activation process has not been established. Potential mechanisms by which Tec family tyrosine kinases are inactivated include (numbers in red) (1) PTEN, a lipid phosphatase that hydrolyzes PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\) into PI\(_{(4,5)}\)P\(_{2}\), and SHIP (not shown), which hydrolyzes PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\) into PI\(_{(3,4)}\)P\(_{2}\); and (2) CD148, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that has been implicated in dephosphorylation of T cell signaling proteins such as SLP-76 and LAT, which would eliminate the docking sites for Tec family kinases.

Together, these data lead to a model wherein receptor stimulation leads to activation of PI3K, resulting in the accumulation of PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\) in the plasma membrane. The PH domain-containing Tec kinases are then recruited to the membrane at the site of the activated receptor. This localization is essential for the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of the Tec family kinase (3, 4, 46, 63, 77, 78). Furthermore, replacement of the Itk PH domain with an alternative membrane localization signal, such as a myristoylation and acylation target sequence, produces an Itk protein that can localize to the plasma membrane but cannot be
tyrosine phosphorylated following TCR stimulation (78). These data indicate a critical role for the PH domain in Itk activation beyond simple membrane recruitment. Furthermore, recent data on the membrane localization of Tec indicates an important role for the SH2 and SH3 domains in addition to the Tec PH domain (63, 79, 80).

Additional differences in the functional properties of the distinct Tec family kinase PH domains have also been observed. For instance, an activating mutation was identified in the Btk PH domain involving substitution of glutamic acid with lysine at residue 41 (81). This activating mutation (E41K) leads to increased PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\)-binding of the mutant PH domain (63) and thus generates a Btk protein that exhibits increased localization to the membrane compared with wild-type Btk (81). In contrast, however, the comparable amino acid substitution in the Tec PH domain (E42K) leads to reduced binding to PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\) in vitro and reduced functional activity in T cells (63), indicating a significant structural difference between the Btk and Tec PH domains.

The dependence of Tec kinase activation on PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\) levels in the plasma membrane also implicates additional regulators of inositol phosphates in the modulation of Tec kinase activity (Figure 2). For instance, in B cells, Btk activity is downregulated by the enzyme SHIP, an SH2-containing inositol phosphatase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\) to PI\(_{(3,4)}\)P\(_{2}\) (73). SHIP may also contribute to the regulation of Tec in T cells (81a). A second mechanism that downregulates Tec kinase activity is the hydrolysis of PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\) into PI\(_{(4,5)}\)P\(_{2}\) by the dual specificity phosphatase, PTEN. This pathway’s importance in T cells was demonstrated by the discovery that the Jurkat tumor line, commonly used for signal transduction studies, has a naturally occurring deficiency in PTEN (82, 83); interestingly, this lack of PTEN leads to constitutively high levels of PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\) in Jurkat cells and, consequently, to a constitutive localization of Itk to the plasma membrane in these cells (77, 82).

A very recent study has also provided intriguing evidence that in B cells, Btk participates in a positive feedback loop to promote the production of PI\(_{(4,5)}\)P\(_{2}\), the substrate for both PI3K and PLC-γ (84). In this pathway, Btk binds to PIP5 kinase and shuttles this enzyme to the plasma membrane where it converts PI\(_{(4)}\)P into PI\(_{(4,5)}\)P\(_{2}\). By this mechanism, the activated B cell is ensured of an ongoing supply of PI\(_{(4,5)}\)P\(_{2}\) to drive the further production of PI\(_{(3,4,5)}\)P\(_{3}\), as well as the second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP\(_{3}\)). To date, no similar mechanism has been described for a Tec kinase in T cells.

One final mechanism regulating Tec family kinase membrane localization mediated by the PH domain is the phosphorylation of this domain by protein kinase C (PKC). Early studies first indicated that the PH domains of Btk and Itk directly bind to PKCβ, and that the association between Btk or Itk and PKCβ could be detected by coimmunoprecipitation from mast cells (85, 86). The Btk and Itk PH domains were then shown to be substrates for PKC phosphorylation in vitro (85, 86). A functional connection between Tec kinases and PKC was first suggested by data
showing that PKC depletion in mast cells led to increased phosphorylation of Btk but to decreased phosphorylation of Itk following FcεRI crosslinking (85, 86). The findings on Btk were further reinforced by genetic data indicating that targeted mutation of the PKCβ gene in mice results in a B cell immunodeficiency remarkably similar to that seen in the absence of Btk activity (87). Paradoxically, biochemical studies demonstrate that PKC phosphorylation of Btk leads to enhanced Btk membrane localization and tyrosine phosphorylation and to augmented antigen receptor signaling in both B cells and mast cells (88). Together, these data suggest that precise modulation of Tec kinase membrane localization is critical for optimal levels of antigen receptor signaling. Whether Itk and Tec are similarly regulated by PKC phosphorylation in T cells remains to be determined.

# Membrane Localization of Rlk is Mediated by a Palmitoylated Cysteine-String Motif

Two distinct isoforms of the Rlk protein have been identified that arise by translation initiation from two different sites on the same cDNA molecule (6). Interestingly, both isoforms of Rlk lack the amino-terminal PH domain found in Itk and Tec. Instead, the larger isoform of Rlk contains an amino-terminal cysteine-string motif that directs palmitoylation of the protein (6), leading to constitutive localization of Rlk to the membrane and, specifically, to lipid rafts (59). The shorter isoform of Rlk lacks the cysteine-string motif and fatty acid modification. This shorter isoform colocalizes with the longer isoform when the two proteins are coexpressed, but it constitutively translocates to the nucleus when expressed alone (6). The precise function of the nuclear form of Rlk is not known, but one report indicates that Rlk may function as a transcription factor for the IFN-γ gene (89). Interestingly, Itk has also been reported to localize to the nucleus, a process that is enhanced by its interaction with the nuclear import chaperone, karyopherin α (Rch1α) (90).

# REGULATION OF TEC FAMILY KINASE ACTIVITY BY COLOCALIZATION WITH RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED ADAPTER PROTEINS AND SUBSTRATES

A second major mechanism for regulating Tec family kinase activity downstream of activated receptors in T cells is via the localization of the kinase with receptor-associated adapter proteins and substrates. On this topic, the majority of data focus on Itk and its interaction with proteins in the TCR signaling pathway. Several studies have demonstrated that Itk binds directly to SLP-76 via the Itk-SH2 domain, binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in SLP-76 (77, 91). In addition, the Itk-SH3 domain and the PRR of SLP-76 also interact, providing cooperative binding of two domains of Itk to SLP-76, thus potentially increasing the stability of this

interaction (77). Interestingly, the Itk-SH2 domain appears to be remarkably selective, as it binds only SLP-76 in activated T cells; similarly, the Btk-SH2 domain also selectively binds to the SLP-65 adapter protein in activated B cells (91, 92). Because a functional SH2 domain is critical for TCR-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Itk, the localization of Itk to the SLP-76 adapter protein is an essential aspect of the signal transduction pathway (93).

Itk also interacts with the adapter protein LAT (linker for activation of T cells) (77, 93, 94). Currently, it is not clear whether this interaction is direct or indirect. If indirect, the binding of Itk to LAT may be mediated via the adapter protein GRB-2, which binds to the Itk PRR and also to tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (77, 95, 95a). Alternatively, Itk binding to SLP-76 may be required for its interaction with LAT. Regardless of the detailed mechanism, the association of Itk with LAT is clearly a critical component of the signal transduction pathway leading from the TCR to Itk. This conclusion is supported by studies performed in Jurkat T cells lacking LAT, in which TCR stimulation fails to activate Itk (93, 94).

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk in response to TCR stimulation also depends on the tyrosine kinase Zap-70 (94). Because Zap-70 does not directly phosphorylate Itk (94), this requirement is most likely indirect, via the need to recruit Itk to the Zap-70-dependent SLP-76/LAT adapter complex (77, 93, 94). The requirement for Itk to colocalize with the LAT/SLP-76 adapter complex also provides a potential mechanism to terminate Itk signaling. For instance, overexpression of the tyrosine phosphatase CD148 leads to reduced phosphorylation of LAT and PLC-γ1 in activated Jurkat T cells; this pathway is also expected to downregulate Itk activity, further attenuating the signals downstream of the TCR (96) (Figure 2).

In addition to interactions with the LAT/SLP-76 adapter complex, Tec kinases bind to other T cell signaling proteins that may regulate their activity in response to receptor stimulation. For instance, Itk binds directly to PLC-γ1 (97), its most well-documented substrate following TCR stimulation (10, 13, 98). A T cell adapter protein, RIBP, has been identified on the basis of a screen for Rlk-binding proteins (99). RIBP, which also binds to Itk, plays a role in T cell activation, based on the findings that RIBP-deficient T cells show reduced proliferation and IL-2 secretion following TCR plus CD28 stimulation (99). Another interesting set of Tec kinase-interacting proteins is the heterotrimeric G proteins. Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins bind to PH domains, as first described for the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (100) and for Btk (101). Subsequently, the Gβγ subunits were shown to bind to Itk and to stimulate Itk kinase activity in vitro (102). These findings were then extended to Ga subunits of the Gq class, which were shown to bind to Btk and to stimulate Btk activity both in vitro and in intact chicken DT-40 B cells (103). Given the suggestive data that TCR signaling leads to heterotrimeric G protein activation (104), and further that this pathway regulates TCR proximal events such as TCRζ, CD3ε, as well as Zap-70 phosphorylation (105), the interactions of Tec kinases with these proteins may be important components of the TCR signaling pathway.

REGULATION OF TEC FAMILY KINASE ACTIVITY  
BY PHOSPHORYLATION  

The third mechanism regulating Tec family kinase activity downstream of receptor stimulation in T cells is through the tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme. As was first demonstrated for Btk (106–109), Tec kinases are phosphorylated on a conserved activation loop tyrosine in the kinase domain, and this phosphorylation enhances enzymatic activity of the kinase. This mechanism, which is common to multiple families of protein kinases, results in a conformational change in the kinase domain that provides substrates access to the catalytic site (110). However, unlike the closely related Src family tyrosine kinases, Tec kinases do not autophosphorylate this activation loop tyrosine. Instead, phosphorylation of Y551 in Btk (107, 109), Y511 in Itk (9), and Y420 in Rlk (6, 59) are mediated by Src family tyrosine kinases in a transphosphorylation reaction. Tec has also been shown to be directly phosphorylated and activated by the Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn, although the identity of the activating tyrosine in Tec has not been rigorously identified (111).

Transphosphorylation of Tec family kinases on the activation loop tyrosine in the kinase domain leads to increased Tec kinase activity in vitro and is critical for Tec kinase-mediated signal transduction in intact T cells. For Itk and Rlk, substitution of Y511 or Y420, respectively, with phenylalanine produces a protein that has impaired in vitro kinase activity (9, 59). In contrast, phosphorylation of the wild-type Itk protein at Y511 by Lck, or of the wild-type Rlk protein at Y420 by Fyn, increases Itk and Rlk in vitro kinase activity (9, 59). Furthermore, Jurkat T cells lacking Lck show no TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk, indicating a critical role for Lck in Itk activation in intact cells (7, 9). For Rlk, Y420 is critical for tyrosine phosphorylation of Rlk following TCR stimulation (59).

The functional significance of phosphorylation on the activation loop tyrosine has been demonstrated for Btk as well as Itk. For Btk, a study using the chicken DT-40B cell tumor line showed that Y551 in Btk is essential for Btk-mediated calcium mobilization downstream of the B cell antigen receptor (112). Interestingly, this study also demonstrated that functional Btk activity depends on the presence of both the Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases (112), suggesting a common mechanism for activating Btk and Itk in response to antigen receptor stimulation in B and T cells, respectively. In the case of T cells, data addressing the functional significance of tyrosine phosphorylation sites is restricted to Itk, where Y511 was shown to be essential for Itk-dependent signaling downstream of the TCR (98).

Following transphosphorylation by a Src family kinase, Tec kinases then autophosphorylate on a conserved tyrosine in the SH3 domain, as has been most notably demonstrated for Btk and Itk (98, 108, 109, 113, 114). Although well-documented at the biochemical level, the functional significance of this autophosphorylation activity has been more difficult to discern. For Btk, mutation of the autophosphorylation site Y223 to phenylalanine has little effect on the ability of

Btk to restore normal calcium mobilization, IP3 production, or PLC-γ2 phosphorylation responses to Btk-deficient DT-40 chicken B cells (112), although it potentiated Btk activity in fibroblasts (108). In contrast, in primary T cells, mutation of the Itk autophosphorylation site Y180 leads to partially impaired Itk activity in response to TCR stimulation (98). Interestingly, these tyrosines are positioned within the substrate-binding surface of the SH3 domains of Btk and Itk (115, 116). This intriguing location suggests that autophosphorylation at this site may be more critical for modulating protein-protein interactions with the Tec kinases, rather than as a mechanism to regulate enzymatic activity. Support for this notion is provided by one study documenting altered ligand-binding properties of the phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated Btk SH3 domain (117). For instance, c-cbl binding to the Btk SH3 domain is unaffected by phosphorylation at Y223, whereas binding of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is completely restricted to the nonphosphorylated Btk SH3 domain. In contrast, only the phosphorylated Btk SH3 domain binds to the tyrosine kinase Syk in lysates from activated B cells (117).

# REGULATION OF TEC FAMILY KINASE ACTIVITY BY INTRA- AND INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS AMONG TEC KINASE PROTEIN DOMAINS

One additional mechanism regulating Tec family kinase activity is reversible alterations in the tertiary structure of the enzyme. Conformational changes play a critical role in regulating the activities of Src family tyrosine kinases as well as Syk family tyrosine kinases in lymphocytes (118, 119). The most well-characterized of these conformational changes are those described for the Src family tyrosine kinases, where multiple intramolecular interactions serve to stabilize the binding of the C-terminal negative regulatory phosphotyrosine to the SH2 domain of the enzyme (118). In this way, the Src family kinases are maintained in a folded, inactive state prior to receptor stimulation. For Tec family kinases, the regulation of kinase activity by intramolecular domain associations is likely to be distinct from that of Src family kinases, as Tec kinases lack the conserved carboxy-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site common to Src family kinases. Nonetheless, several pieces of evidence suggest that Tec kinases may also be regulated by conformational changes following receptor stimulation (Figure 1B).

The original finding that suggested an important role for conformational changes regulating Tec kinase activity was the observation that the Itk SH3 and PRR domains fold into an intramolecular structure (115). This intramolecular interaction between the Itk SH3 and PRR regions was also shown to prevent the binding of each domain to its respective ligands (115). Subsequent structural studies demonstrated that Btk and Tec also form intramolecular SH3-PRR complexes, whereas Rlk does not. However, for Btk, Tec, and Rlk, the preferred structure is a homodimer formed via reciprocal SH3-PRR intermolecular interactions, a structure that is not formed

by the Itk SH3-PRR protein fragment (120–125). Further complicating this issue, a fragment of Itk containing both the SH2 and SH3 domains, rather than the SH3 and PRR domains, does dimerize in solution in a manner that would preclude the intramolecular association of the Itk PRR to the SH3 domain aromatic binding pocket (126). Thus, for Itk these data suggest the possibility that the dimerization of two Itk molecules by reciprocal SH2-SH3 domain interactions may be an intermediate step in activating the kinase, by displacing the intramolecular SH3 domain-PRR interaction (126).

Alternatively, for Itk as well as for the other Tec kinases, dimerization via reciprocal SH3-SH2 or SH3-PRR associations may represent the inactive state of the enzyme. This latter possibility is supported by data indicating that, for both Btk and Tec, deletion of the SH3 domain results in a dramatic increase in kinase activity (81, 127). Additionally, the PRR regions of Btk, Itk, and Rlk bind to SH3 domains of Src family kinases such as Fyn (59, 77, 128, 129). This interaction is also predicted to disrupt intra- and intermolecular interactions, potentially providing an activation signal. However, unlike Btk and Tec, deletion of the Itk SH3 domain has only a modest effect on Itk kinase activity (130), and mutation of the conserved tryptophan (Itk-W208) that is essential for SH3 domain interactions with PRR ligands has little or no impact on Itk kinase activity (93, 98). An overall view of the domain interactions that regulate Tec kinase activity requires structural data on the full-length proteins to complement the structures already reported on individual Tec kinase domains (41, 42, 71, 115, 116, 120, 122, 123, 125, 126, 131–134).

Another interesting difference between Itk and the other Tec kinase family members is the recent description of a proline-dependent conformational switch within the Itk SH2 domain (132, 135). Surprisingly, the proline involved in this switch is not conserved in any of the other Tec kinase family members (132). However, for the Itk SH2 domain, this conformational switch mediates interconversion of the SH2 domain between one isomer that binds phosphotyrosine-containing ligands and the other isomer that undergoes intermolecular association with the Itk SH3 domain (126, 132, 135, 136). Consequently, this conformational switch has the potential to be a critical element in the regulation of Itk function by modulating the ability of Itk to bind ligands such as SLP-76 and thus to participate in the TCR signaling pathway. Of further interest, Itk was also recently shown to bind to the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A, an enzyme that catalyzes *cis-trans* proline isomerization, such as that described within the Itk SH2 domain (135). Itk kinase activity is also inhibited by this interaction with cyclophilin A, an effect that could be reversed by treatment with cyclosporine A (135). Consistent with this, T cells from cyclophilin A-deficient mice are hyperresponsive to TCR stimulation and show increased phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (25). These data suggest another level at which Itk activity might be regulated in T cells.

An X-ray crystal structure of the isolated Itk kinase domain has recently been reported (42). Structures of both the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated (Y511) kinase domain bound to the broadly active kinase inhibitor staurosporine were determined, in addition to a structure of the unliganded nonphosphorylated

kinase domain (42). These data revealed several surprising aspects of the Itk kinase domain structure. First, investigators did not observe any major conformational differences among these three structures of the Itk kinase domain, which indicates that, for Itk, phosphorylation of a residue on the activation loop does not induce a conformational change. However, because Y511 of Itk is absolutely essential for Itk functional activity in primary T cells (98), and phosphorylation of this residue enhances Itk kinase activity (9), there is likely an alternative role for this phosphorylation site in Itk activation.

A second surprising aspect of the Itk kinase domain structures is that all three of these structures resemble the active forms of other protein kinase domains, yet the isolated Itk kinase domain is catalytically inactive (42, 137). Similarly, the isolated kinase domain of Btk is also catalytically inactive (138), an obvious difference from that observed with Src family tyrosine kinases. Additionally, the X-ray crystal structure of the isolated nonphosphorylated Btk kinase domain is strikingly similar to those reported for the Itk kinase domain (41). Together these data suggest a role for additional Tec family kinase protein domains in the formation of a catalytically active enzyme. This notion is consistent with biochemical studies demonstrating that deletion of the Itk PH domain and part of the TH domain reduces Itk kinase activity by 10-fold, whereas mutation of two conserved prolines in the Itk PRR reduces Itk kinase activity by 100-fold (137). Resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the full-length Itk protein would likely explain these surprising findings.

# FUNCTIONS OF TEC FAMILY KINASES IN T CELL SIGNALING PATHWAYS

Mutations affecting the Tec family kinases Itk and Rlk lead to impaired responses to TCR stimulation, including proliferation, IL-2 production, and production of effector cytokines (10, 12–15, 25, 26). For proliferation and IL-2 production, defects are minimal in Rlk-deficient cells, moderately severe in \(Itk^{-/-}\)cells, and most severe in \(Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}\)cells (10). The rescue of these phenotypes by stimulation with phorbol esters and calcium ionophores suggests that these cells have relatively proximal defects in TCR signaling (10, 12, 13). Accordingly, mutation of these kinases is associated with a variety of biochemical defects downstream of the TCR (Tables 2, 3).

## TCR Signaling

Upon TCR stimulation, there is a rapid sequential activation of the Lck and Zap-70 tyrosine kinases, which in turn phosphorylate a number of molecules, including the adapter proteins LAT and SLP-76. These two key adapters serve as a platform for the recruitment of molecules into a signaling complex, including PLC-γ, GRB-2, GADS, ADAP, Vav, Nck, and the Tec kinase Itk (Figure 3) (reviewed in 95,

Figure 3 Tec kinases contribute to TCR-mediated signaling pathways. Engagement of the TCR leads to rapid activation of Lck and Zap-70, which phosphorylate numerous downstream targets, including the adapter molecules LAT and SLP-76. Together, these adapters form a platform for the accumulation of molecules into a signaling complex that includes PLC-$\gamma$, GRB-2, GADS, Nck, Vav1, ADAP, WASP, Tec family kinases, and other associated molecules. Itk and probably other Tec kinases physically interact with SLP-76 and possibly LAT, bringing it into this complex where it can phosphorylate PLC-$\gamma$. Recent data also suggest a role for Itk in regulating Vav1 localization, which further suggests that Itk supports the integrity of the TCR-induced signaling complex. This complex is important for transducing signals that regulate Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization (via PLC-$\gamma$ and IP$_3$), PKC and MAPK activation (via DAG and GRB-2-SOS pathways), transcriptional activation, and actin reorganization and cell adhesion (via Vav and its effectors, Rac, Cdc42, and Rho).

95a). For simplicity, we refer to this as one signaling complex, although there are likely multiple independent or linked complexes containing subsets of these and additional proteins. This T cell signaling complex is required for downstream activation of Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization and MAP kinases via activation of PLC-$\gamma$ and GRB-2-SOS pathways. Mutations affecting the proximal kinases Lck and Zap-70 or the adapters LAT and SLP-76 effectively prevent activation of Ca$^{2+}$ and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways downstream of the TCR in cell lines and block T cell development in mice (reviewed in 139). In addition,

components of this complex contribute to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (95).

In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated a number of potential interactions between the Tec family kinases and other components of this signaling complex, including an inducible interaction between the SH2 and SH3 domains of Itk and SLP-76 (77, 91) and interactions with LAT via SH2- and PRR-mediated mechanisms (77, 93, 94). Evidence also suggests potential interactions between Tec family kinases and Vav [via both the Tec TH (69) and Itk SH2 and SH3 domains (77)], GRB-2 [via the Itk and Rlk PRR domains (59, 77)], and PLC-$\gamma$ [via the Itk SH2 and SH3 domains (97)].

Consistent with a role for Tec kinases in the LAT-SLP-76 signaling complex, initial phosphorylation events, including tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR$\zeta$ chain and Zap-70, are normal in $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ cells (10, 13). Gross patterns of phosphorylation of many components of this signaling complex, including Vav, SLP-76, Cbl, and WASP, are also normal in these mutant cells (11, 140; L.D. Finkelstein, unpublished). However, the Tec family kinases play a role in the phosphorylation and regulation of PLC-$\gamma$1 (10, 13). Accordingly, stimulation of $Itk^{-/-}$ or $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ T cells with a phorbol ester plus Ca$^{2+}$ ionophore rescues many of their functional defects (10, 13).

REGULATION OF PLC-$\gamma$ AND Ca$^{2+}$ MOBILIZATION   PLC-$\gamma$ is a key cellular enzyme that cleaves PI$_{(4,5)}$P$_{2}$ to generate two key second messengers, IP$_{3}$ and DAG (141). IP$_{3}$ binds to receptors on intracellular organelles, leading to the release of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores, which then, via a poorly understood process, triggers the store-operated or Ca$^{2+}$-release-activated Ca$^{2+}$ channels (CRAC) on the plasma membrane, leading to a prolonged phase of Ca$^{2+}$ influx from extracellular stores (142). This prolonged influx is required for activation of downstream effectors, including the NFAT transcription factors (143). Accordingly, kinase-inactive mutants of either Itk or Tec, or antisense to Tec, block TCR-induced NFAT reporter activation (8, 56, 63, 77) (see Table 2).

Initial studies of B cells deficient in Btk or T cells deficient in Itk or Rlk and Itk suggest that these kinases play a major role in the regulation of PLC-$\gamma$ and IP$_{3}$ production. Btk-deficient clones of the DT-40 cell line show absent tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-$\gamma$2 (the major isoform in B cells) (144). Although cells from XLA patients do not necessarily show reduced levels of total tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-$\gamma$2, they do show defective phosphorylation of Y753 and Y759, two critical regulatory tyrosines (145, 146). Both thymocytes and mature T cells from $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ cells show reduced phosphorylation of PLC-$\gamma$1, particularly on the regulatory tyrosine Y783 (10, 11, 13, 98; P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished). Moreover, studies in heterologous cells argue that Rlk, Itk, and Btk can all directly phosphorylate PLC-$\gamma$1 (98, 145, 147).

Accordingly, T cells that are deficient in Itk or Itk and Rlk show reduced TCR-induced IP$_{3}$ production and Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization. In both thymocytes and mature T cells, Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization appears to be most affected in the late stage of prolonged

Ca²⁺ influx from extracellular stores (10, 11, 13). Stimulation in the presence of EGTA leads to similar intracellular Ca²⁺ levels in wild-type and mutant cells, parallel to findings in Btk-deficient B cells (145). Internal stores of Ca²⁺ appear to be intact, at least in Itk-deficient T cells (13), as demonstrated by studies using EGTA plus thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca²⁺ reuptake by the ER Ca²⁺-sensitive ATPase (148). Moreover, depletion of intracellular stores of Ca²⁺ with thapsigargin alone, which can stimulate CRAC channels and lead to an influx from extracellular sources, also gave similar responses in $Itk^{-/-}$, $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$, and wild-type T cells (13; E.M. Schaeffer & P.S. Schwartzberg, unpublished), suggesting that there is not a defect in the mechanism of coupling of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores to extracellular influx. The defect in Ca²⁺ influx has therefore been attributed to the decreased IP₃ production (13), which may not be sufficient to maintain depletion of intracellular stores required for prolonged triggering of CRAC channels in these cells (149).

Although studies of $Itk^{-/-}$ T cells argue that Itk is the major kinase involved in PLC-$\gamma$ regulation, mutation of both Rlk and Itk can worsen the Ca²⁺ defect in Itk-deficient cells, even though Rlk-deficient cells show little if any effects on Ca²⁺ in response to TCR stimulation (10). Similarly, overexpression of Rlk can partially rescue the Ca²⁺ defect in Itk-deficient cells, suggesting that there is some degree of functional redundancy between these kinases (61).

How Tec contributes to these pathways in T cells remains less clear. However, a recent paper argued that in preactivated cells, Tec participates in regulation of PLC-$\gamma$1 and Ca²⁺ mobilization downstream of PKC$\theta$ (150). Whether such a pathway operates in naive cells is not clear.

DAG-MEDIATED PATHWAYS The second major product of PLC-$\gamma$ is DAG, which can activate members of the PKC family (151). In B cells, numerous cross-regulatory connections between Btk and PKC family members have been demonstrated (see above). Although PKC activation has not been directly examined in T cells from $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice, PMA plus anti-CD3 stimulation can rescue proliferation of T cells from $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice, evidence of a major role for DAG-mediated defects in their phenotypes (10). As discussed above, a recent paper argues that Tec is involved in the impaired activation PLC-$\gamma$1 observed in $PKC\theta^{-/-}$ T cells (150). This same paper describes a downstream defect in the activation of PKC$\alpha$ in $PKC\theta^{-/-}$ cells, which the authors attribute to the defective PLC-$\gamma$ activation.

In T cells, another important effector of DAG is Ras-GRP, a novel activator of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway in T cells (95). Consistent with a predicted decrease in DAG production, T cells deficient in Itk or Rlk and Itk show reduced activation of ERK in response to either anti-CD3 or antigen stimulation (10, 11, 15). JNK activation was also abnormal in $Itk^{-/-}$ mature T lymphocytes after stimulation with antigen (15). In contrast, activation of the p38 MAPK, which may rely more on GRB-2-mediated pathways, appeared relatively normal in thymocytes of $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice (11), although this has not been examined in mature cells or under conditions of antigen stimulation.

Mutational analyses argue that kinase activity, the major Src family phosphorylation site in the kinase domain, and SH3 domains are all required for Itk function, including ERK activation and IL-2 production downstream of TCR signaling (98). Overexpression of kinase-inactive Itk constructs can block activation of a NFAT reporter construct and phosphorylation of PLC-$\gamma$1 (58, 77). Moreover, the autophosphorylation site contributes to the efficiency of proper Itk function (98). Together these data support the critical function of tyrosine phosphorylation for Itk function. For Btk, function of the SH2 domain, which interacts with BLNK/SLP-65, is also required for rescue of Btk-deficient cells (144). This is also likely to be the case for Itk, which requires a functional SH2 domain for its activation (93), suggesting that both phosphorylation and protein interactions are critical for Itk function.

OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PLC-$\gamma$ ACTIVATION Phosphorylation may not be the only mechanism by which Tec family kinases regulate PLC-$\gamma$. In B cells, overexpression of a kinase-inactive Btk can increase Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization in cell lines (152, 153). The recent finding that the PH domain of Btk can assist in the shuttling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) to the plasma membrane suggests that the Tec kinases may potentiate signaling by providing more PI$_{(4,5)}$P$_2$, the substrate for PLC-$\gamma$ (84). In this study, the PH domain of Tec was also found to bind PIP5K in vitro, suggesting that multiple Tec kinases may be able to influence this pathway of phosphoinositide regulation.

Tec kinases may also contribute to phosphorylation of other components in LAT-SLP-76 signaling complexes. Overexpression studies suggest that Rlk can phosphorylate SLP-76 and potentiate SLP-76-mediated activation of ERK and expression of an NFAT/AP1 reporter construct (60). In vitro expression studies suggest that Itk can phosphorylate LAT on Y171 and Y191, two distal tyrosines that may be involved in recruitment of Vav and GRB-2 (154). Expression of a kinase-inactive Itk decreased phosphorylation of LAT and the amount of Vav in LAT coimmunoprecipitates. These observations, combined with the multiple potential interactions of Tec kinases with other components of TCR signaling, suggest that the Tec kinases contribute to the integrity of signaling complexes, an idea that is revisited below in the discussion of actin cytoskeleton regulation.

TEC FAMILY KINASES AS MODULATORS OF TCR SIGNALING Mutations affecting both Rlk and Itk do not eliminate PLC-$\gamma$ phosphorylation and Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization but rather reduce the efficiency of these processes. These data may result from functional redundancy between Tec family kinases and the presence of Tec in the $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ cells. Alternatively, there may be multiple kinases that contribute to these activation pathways, including Lck, Fyn, and Zap-70. These observations have generated the notion that Tec kinases do not act as triggers of TCR signaling like the more proximal kinases Lck and Zap-70, nor as gatekeepers like the adapter molecules LAT and SLP-76. Rather, Tec family kinases modulate or amplify the efficiency of downstream TCR signaling (155, 156). Indeed, one study

using single-cell imaging of cells that express kinase-inactive mutants of Lck or Itk found that expression of these mutants produced very different responses. Cells that express kinase-inactive Lck either did not flux Ca²⁺ or fully fluxed Ca²⁺, depending on the amount of kinase-inactive Lck expressed (157). In contrast, cells that express kinase-inactive Itk had reduced Ca²⁺ flux per cell. Thus, Tec kinases may be seen as modulators of T cell responses, a view that is consistent with their effects on T cell development and mature T helper cell differentiation (see below).

There is some degree of functional redundancy among the Tec family kinases in the activation of PLC-γ, but evidence nonetheless suggests that Itk, Rlk, and Tec each have distinct properties and mechanisms of activation (Table 2). Rlk, Itk, Tec, and Bmx can all rescue PLC-γ phosphorylation and Ca²⁺ mobilization to varying degrees in Btk-deficient DT-40 cells, yet Rlk fails to rescue BCR-induced apoptosis, highlighting the differences between this kinase and the other Tec family members (62). Moreover, overexpression of Tec but not Itk can activate an NFAT reporter construct in Jurkat cells, and can do so independently of the LAT and SLP-76 adapters, which supports the view that Tec may interact in these pathways via different intermediates (8, 35). Such a view is consistent with the distinct patterns of localization and substrates for these kinases, including SLP-76 for Rlk and Dok1 and Dok2 for Tec (6, 8, 35, 60). A recent paper also raises the possibility that differential sensitivities to the inhibitors PTEN and SHIP may contribute to functional differences between Itk and Tec (81a).

## Tec Kinases and Actin Cytoskeletal Reorganization

Another major function of TCR signaling is the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which contributes to the accumulation of signaling molecules to the site of TCR stimulation and the generation of the immune synapse (158). Several recent reports have demonstrated that the Tec family kinase Itk is required for actin polymerization and polarization downstream of TCR engagement.

An initial study showed that expression of mutant forms of Itk, including a kinase-inactive mutant and the isolated PH domain, blocked anti-CD3-stimulated actin polymerization in Jurkat T cells (19). Similar results were reported for a mutant affecting the Itk SH2 domain (27). Importantly, actin polymerization and polarization to either anti-TCR-coated beads or peptide-pulsed antigen presenting cells (APCs) were markedly impaired in T cells from both *Itk⁻/⁻* and *Rlk⁻/⁻Itk⁻/⁻* mice (27, 28). In these systems, both *Itk⁻/⁻* and *Rlk⁻/⁻Itk⁻/⁻* T cells are equally defective, evidence that these phenotypes are attributable to the lack of Itk (28). Interestingly, these phenotypes appear more severe than the Ca²⁺ mobilization defects in *Itk⁻/⁻* cells, with virtually no increase in actin polarization observed upon exposure to antigen. Whether this is due to differences in the sensitivities of the actin polarization and Ca²⁺ assays remains to be evaluated.

The requirement of Itk for TCR-mediated actin polarization suggests that Itk deficiency may affect other actin-dependent processes, including the recruitment of proteins required for formation of the immune synapse. Indeed, polarization
of Vav1 to the site of contact with peptide-pulsed APCs was abnormal in $Itk^{-/-}$ T cells (28). In addition, studies using $Itk^{-/-}$ T cells conjugated to anti-TCR-coated beads reveal defective localization of multiple synapse-associated proteins, including PKCθ, the β2 integrin LFA-1, and the cytoskeletal protein talin (L.D. Finkelstein & P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished).

Another process that requires an intact actin cytoskeleton is the TCR-mediated increase in integrin adhesion. Upon engagement of the TCR, integrin-mediated adhesion is upregulated via a poorly understood process known as “inside-out” signaling, which involves PI3K, PKCs, the adapter molecule ADAP, the GTPase Rap1, Vav1, and actin cytoskeletal reorganization (159). Recent data also implicate the Tec family kinase Itk in this process. Jurkat T cells expressing either a kinase-inactive mutant or the PH domain of Itk were blocked in anti-CD3-stimulated β1 adhesion to the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (19). Expression of a membrane-targeted mutant of Itk could stimulate adhesion in cells stimulated with anti-CD4, which activates Lck but does not stimulate adhesion on its own. Conversely, expression of kinase-inactive Itk blocked adhesion that was stimulated by expression of an activated p110 PI3K construct in conjunction with anti-CD4 stimulation, evidence that Itk is a major effector of PI3K-mediated increases in adhesion. Itk is also critical for TCR-induced integrin adhesion in primary mouse T cells. Itk-deficient T cells show defective conjugate formation to antigen-pulsed APCs (28) and anti-CD3-stimulated upregulation of β2 integrin adhesion (L.D. Finkelstein & P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished). Similarly, Btk is required for integrin-mediated adhesion downstream of the B cell receptor by a process involving cytoskeletal reorganization (160). A role for Tec kinases in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton downstream from integrins is also suggested from studies of Etk/Bmx in other cell types (161, 162).

BIOCHEMICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ACTIN CYTOSKELETON REGULATION: EFFECTS ON THE WISKOTT-ALDRICH SYNDROME PROTEIN (WASP) Evidence suggests that Tec kinases can interact with several proteins involved in assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. WASP is a key actin regulatory protein. WASP activates the Arp2/3 complex that helps nucleate new actin filaments (163). In vitro data demonstrate that the SH3 domains of both Itk and Btk can interact with the PRR of WASP (117, 164, 165). Additionally, Btk was found to phosphorylate WASP in a Cdc42-dependent fashion, suggesting that WASP was a downstream effector of Tec family kinases (166, 167).

Evidence suggests that WASP may be activated by two mechanisms: $(a)$ binding of WASP to activated Cdc42-GTP, which induces an open conformation of the protein that can then bind to Arp2/3 (163); and/or $(b)$ phosphorylation of tyrosine 291 (140). A recent study demonstrated that $Itk^{-/-}$ T cells stimulated with APCs plus peptide show reduced binding to an antibody that recognizes the open conformation of WASP. Stimulated $Itk^{-/-}$ T cells also show defective activation of Cdc42 at the site of contact with the APC, as detected with a GFP fusion of the WASP GTPase-binding domain (28). However, another study has demonstratednormal phosphorylation of tyrosine 291 of WASP in $Itk^{-/-}$ T cells, suggesting that WASP activation is intact in these cells (140). Although the contributions of Cdc42 and tyrosine phosphorylation for activation of WASP in T cells merit further study, the data above suggest that Itk is unlikely to act directly on WASP but rather contributes to the regulation of Cdc42.

EFFECTS ON Vav In T cells, a critical factor for Cdc42 activation is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1, which is rapidly activated by tyrosine phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation (168). Vav1-deficient T cells have defective TCR-mediated activation of Rac and Cdc42 and, like $Itk^{-/-}$ cells, show defects in both TCR-driven actin polarization and integrin adhesion (76, 169, 170). In contrast, in at least one study, WASP was dispensable for regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion and clustering of integrins (169). Vav1 interacts with several signaling proteins involved in the T cell signaling complex, including SLP-76, LAT, and the Tec kinases (77, 95, 95a, 154). Data in other cell types suggest that Tec binds to Vav via its TH domain and can phosphorylate Vav, resulting in enhanced GEF activity for Rac (68, 69).

Although $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ T cells show normal gross patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav (11), studies of $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ T cells demonstrated a failure of Vav to localize to the site of contact with the APC (28). These data suggest that Itk may help control the recruitment or stabilization of Vav1 into the TCR signaling complex. Expression of a membrane-targeted prenylated mutant of Vav1 can partially rescue the actin polarization defect in Jurkat T cells treated with siRNA to Itk (212), supporting the idea that the defect in Vav1 localization directly contributes to the actin defects in Itk-deficient cells. Whether this altered localization affects activity or phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues of Vav1 in Itk-deficient cells remains to be determined.

Itk may assist in the regulation of Vav1 localization by several potential mechanisms. One study argues that Itk can phosphorylate LAT on tyrosines 171 and 191, thus promoting a Vav1-LAT interaction, which is impaired in cells expressing a kinase-inactive mutant of Itk (154). However, the requirement for Itk kinase catalytic activity in TCR-mediated actin polymerization is not clear (19, 27). One study reported that a kinase-inactivating point mutant of Itk blocks actin polymerization (19), while two other studies argue that kinase-inactivating point mutants do not block actin polarization and polymerization (27, 157). Indeed, such data was originally used to argue that Itk was not involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (157). Although it remains unclear why these studies vary from each other, differences may reflect levels of Itk mutants expressed or the cell lines and actual mutant constructs used.

The recent demonstration that an SH2 mutant of Itk can efficiently block actin polarization suggests that protein interactions may be important for Itk’s functions in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (27). Itk can interact with SLP-76 and potentially with LAT via its SH2 domain (95, 95a, 154). Vav also interacts with these molecules, raising the possibility that Itk functions as an adapter, helping to
stabilize interactions of Vav within this signaling complex. Vav and Itk directly bind each other, as do Vav and Tec (212). Whether Itk deficiency alters the interactions of Vav1 with another protein in this signaling complex awaits further experimental investigation.

OTHER POTENTIAL EFFECTORS OF ACTIN AND ADHESION DEFECTS  Whether mislocalization of Vav is the only cause of the actin and adhesion defects in Itk-deficient cells remains unclear. As discussed above, Tec kinases can also influence activation of PKCs, members of which affect actin cytoskeleton dynamics and T cell adhesion (86). Tec kinases also contribute to the regulation of PIP5K (84). Intriguingly, many actin regulatory proteins, including WASP, gelsolin, α-actinin, and profilin, are regulated by binding of PI(4,5)P₂, the product of PIP5K (171). Recruitment of PIP5K via its interactions with a Tec kinase could help recruit and locally activate actin-binding proteins at the site of TCR stimulation, thereby contributing to the establishment and stabilization of cell polarization (172).

Finally, the role of Ca²⁺ in these processes cannot be underestimated. Intracellular Ca²⁺ levels contribute to the regulation of actin reorganization and integrin adhesion, in part through the activation of the Ca²⁺-sensitive protease calpain. Calpain can cleave actin-binding proteins, which permits reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and clustering of integrins and thereby increases adhesive contacts (173). How Itk deficiency affects these processes has not yet been evaluated.

CONSEQUENCES FOR T CELL PHENOTYPES  The regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion by Itk suggests that the phenotypes of Itk-deficient cells may not solely arise from biochemical defects in PLC-γ activation. Although the biochemical defects in Itk-deficient T cells are less severe, they resemble those observed in Vav1-deficient T cells, including decreased activation of PLC-γ, ERK, and downstream transcription factors (168) (see Table 3). Moreover, many of the phenotypes of Itk-deficient T cells, including impaired thymic selection, altered CD4:CD8 ratios, and decreased proliferation and cytokine production (10–12, 15, 16), may be accounted for by decreased duration of signaling that results from decreased actin polarization and integrin-mediated adhesion (Figure 4). Nonetheless, Itk activation is also impaired in Vav-deficient cells (76), highlighting the many levels of feedback among molecules in TCR signaling, where linear relationships are not always easily drawn. Whether Tec kinases contribute to the regulation of Vav family members in B cells and how this may influence the phenotype of Btk-deficient B cells remains an intriguing question. Overexpression of activated Btk, Itk, or Tec can increase membrane ruffle/lamellipodia and actin stress fiber formation (82, 174, 175). Evidence from *Drosophila* also demonstrates a role for Tec29 in formation of an actin-based structure, the ring canal (176). Finally, Btk can associate with F-actin itself via basic residues in the Btk PH domain (177).

Figure 4 Multiple cell surface receptors signal via Tec family kinases. Tec kinases are activated downstream of antigen receptors (TCR and surface immunoglobulin) and G protein-coupled chemokine receptors through the actions of PI3K and Src family kinases. In other cell types, Tec family kinases are also activated by integrins and growth factor receptors. Tec kinases regulate multiple cellular functions, including activation of PLC-γ and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which in turn help to regulate Ca²⁺ mobilization, activation of PKCs, MAPK, and downstream transcription factors, as well as cell adhesion and migration.

## CD28 Signaling

As with TCR engagement, stimulation through the CD28 receptor induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Itk (see above and Table 2) (48–51). A recent study suggests that Itk activation downstream of CD28 is involved in the amplification of TCR-mediated signals, leading to Ca²⁺ mobilization (178). Stimulation of Jurkat cells expressing a tail-less mutant of CD28 led to impaired PLC-γ phosphorylation and Ca²⁺ mobilization, which correlated with decreased phosphorylation of Itk and could be partially overcome by overexpression of Itk. Nonetheless, data from another study showed increased responsiveness of Itk-deficient T cells to anti-CD28 stimulation, supporting the idea that Itk plays a negative regulatory role in CD28 signaling (179). Although this study did not examine the biochemical mechanism of this response, this work suggests that Itk may have distinct roles

downstream of CD3 and CD28. However, interpretations of this study may be complicated by the high numbers of previously activated or memory (i.e., CD44<sup>hi</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells present in *Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> compared with wild-type mice. CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are hyperresponsive to stimulation relative to naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and may thus have biased the outcome of the proliferation assays performed in this study (C.M. Li & L.J. Berg, unpublished observation). Thus, the precise role of Itk in CD28 signaling awaits further study.

Although an initial study cited normal responses to CD28 costimulation in Tec-deficient T cells (36), other reports have shown that Tec, like Itk, is capable of binding CD28 and is activated upon CD28 engagement (8, 64) (see Table 2). One of the proteins phosphorylated in response to CD28 stimulation is p62Dok (Dok1), a RasGAP-associated adapter (8). Tec and Dok1 interact in heterologous cells, and kinase-inactive Tec can block tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok1 downstream of growth factor receptors and the BCR (180, 181). Recent data suggest that Dok1 may participate in negative feedback regulation of Tec (80). Co-expression in heterologous cells demonstrates that Tec but not Itk can tyrosine phosphorylate Dok1 (8). Overexpression of Tec, but not Itk, also enhances transcription of an IL-2 reporter construct in response to anti-CD28 plus PMA stimulation (8). Moreover, only kinase-inactive Tec, not kinase-inactive Itk, could block expression of the IL-2 reporter construct and IL-2 production in response to anti-CD28 plus PMA stimulation. Thus, Tec kinases are implicated in signaling pathways emanating from both the TCR and costimulatory receptors, although their actions may differ downstream in these signaling pathways.

Finally, there are conflicting reports on the ability of Rlk to phosphorylate CTLA-4 in vitro and coexpression systems (60, 182). As discussed above, Itk is also activated in response to CD2 and may participate in NFAT activation downstream of this adhesive receptor (54, 56). However, the in vivo functional correlates of these observations are unclear.

## Effects on Transcription

As described above, T cells containing mutations of Itk or Itk and Rlk exhibit defective activation of TCR signaling intermediates. Accordingly, these mutant T cells also display defective nuclear localization and activation of multiple transcription factors. Consistent with their defects in prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, both *Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> and *Rlk*<sup>−/−</sup>*Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> T cells show decreased activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive NFAT transcription factors (14, 17). In particular, activation of both NFATc1, which is important for Th2 cytokine production, and NFATc2, which regulates transcription of the Egr family of transcription factors are severely impaired in both *Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> and *Rlk*<sup>−/−</sup>*Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> T cells. Indeed, phenotypes of *Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> and *Rlk*<sup>−/−</sup>*Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> mice resemble those of mice harboring mutations in some NFAT family members (183) (Table 3). Consistent with the decreased ERK and JNK phosphorylation observed in *Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> and *Rlk*<sup>−/−</sup>*Itk*<sup>−/−</sup> T cells (15, 17), decreased activation of AP-1 has also been observed (17).

Although activation of NF-$\kappa$B is defective in Btk-deficient B cells (38), the role of Tec kinases in activation of NF-$\kappa$B in T lymphocytes is less clear. Two groups have reported relatively normal activation of this transcription factor in $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ T cells, which has been attributed to their less severe effects on early Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization (10, 14). However, this question may need to be readdressed under different conditions of stimulation given defective localization of PKC$\theta$ observed in $Itk^{-/-}$ cells (L.D. Finkelstein & P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished) and the importance of PKC$\theta$ for NF-$\kappa$B activation in T cells (95, 95a).

A recent paper has demonstrated that Tec kinases also contribute to the BCR-mediated activation of serum response factor (SRF) in B cells via a Lyn-Syk-Btk-PLC-$\gamma$-mediated pathway that requires Rho family GTPases (184). The role of Tec kinases in regulation of SRF in T cells has not yet been examined.

Finally, studies of T helper cell differentiation have implicated both Itk and Rlk in the regulation of GATA-3 and T-bet (see below), although these effects are likely to be secondary to their effects on activation of the above transcriptional pathways (17, 26).

DIRECT EFFECTS ON TRANSCRIPTION In addition to these indirect effects on transcription factor activation, Tec kinases may also directly influence transcription in the nucleus. Upon TCR stimulation, a major portion of Rlk traffics to the nucleus (6). Kashiwakura and colleagues (33, 185) have found that overexpression of Rlk can transactivate an IFN-$\gamma$ reporter construct, an effect that requires nuclear localization and phosphorylation of Rlk. A subsequent study from this group has demonstrated direct binding of Rlk to a region of the IFN-$\gamma$ promoter (89). Whether Rlk phosphorylates another protein binding to the IFN-$\gamma$ promoter or has a direct effect on transcription is not clear.

Although nuclear localization is most dramatic for Rlk, other studies have suggested that both Btk and Itk can also translocate to the nucleus (90, 186). For Itk, an interaction with the nuclear import chaperone karyopherin/Rch1$\alpha$ has been demonstrated (90). This interaction requires proline 242 of Rch1$\alpha$. Expression of a P242A mutant of Rch1$\alpha$ decreased both nuclear localization of Itk and CD3-mediated IL-2 production. Btk has been shown to phosphorylate two transcription factors, the basal transcription factor TF-IIi and Bright, which contributes to Ig gene transcription (186, 187).

## Chemokine Signaling

Recent studies have demonstrated that stimulation of cells with the chemokine SDF-1$\alpha$ or the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) can induce translocation and activation of Tec kinases, including Btk, Tec, and Itk (57, 58, 174, 188, 189). Accordingly, Itk is required for T cell migration and increased adhesion in response to SDF-1$\alpha$ (57, 58). Defects in migration are worsened by lack of both Itk and Rlk, similar to findings in TCR signaling (58). In vivo data demonstrate defective recruitment of Itk-deficient cells into airways in an allergic asthma model or in

response to SDF-1α (18, 57). Other data show defective localization of Rlk⁻/⁻ Itk⁻/⁻ cells in lymphoid organs upon transfer to intact wild-type animals (58). Moreover, although Rlk⁻/⁻Itk⁻/⁻ mice have normal numbers of thymocytes, they show decreased T cell numbers in peripheral lymph nodes (58), supporting a defect in T cell migration in vivo. Similarly, a Btk inhibitor decreases neutrophil migration in response to fMLP (188).

Cellular and biochemical studies have demonstrated that overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of Itk in Jurkat cells blocked SDF-1α-induced cell polarization and activation of Rac and Cdc42 (58). Thus, Tec kinases play a role in regulating Rho family GTPases, cell polarization, and adhesion downstream of chemokine receptors as well as the TCR. These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating a role for Tec kinases in regulating Rho family GTPases during chemotaxis, collagen signaling, and integrin signaling in non-T cell systems, such as neutrophils and platelets (65). Although it is not clear how Tec kinases influence activation of Rho family GTPases in chemokine signaling, it is of interest whether this involves the regulation of Vav or another GEF. Tec is implicated in the activation of the leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) (190), suggesting that Tec kinases contribute to the regulation of multiple Rho family GTPases.

## TEC KINASES IN T CELL DEVELOPMENT

A critical role for Tec family kinases in lymphocyte development first became evident with the discovery of Btk. Although investigators have not found naturally occurring mutations in Itk, Rlk, or Tec, mice deficient in one or more of these Tec kinase family members have been generated, confirming a role for these proteins in T cell development (10–13).

### Roles in Positive Selection

The generation of mice deficient in Itk, (12, 13), Rlk (10), or Tec (36) demonstrate that Itk is the dominant Tec kinase in T cell development and function. Initial analyses of Itk-deficient mice revealed a normal distribution of all T cell subsets, except for a smaller percentage and total number of CD4⁺ T cells in both the thymus and periphery (12). Thus, there were not any profound blocks in T cell development in the absence of Itk. However, when Itk-deficient mice were crossed to either AND (H2ᵇ) or H-Y TCR transgenic lines, very few CD4 or CD8 single positive (SP) thymocytes, respectively, developed, indicating a role for Itk in positive selection events in the thymus (12). Mice deficient in both Itk and Rlk were subsequently crossed to the same TCR transgenic lines. In this case, an even more profound defect in CD4 or CD8 SP maturation was observed, providing evidence that a deficiency in Rlk exacerbates the defects in positive selection seen in the absence of Itk (11). A later study examining the role of Itk in the thymic selection of a wider array of TCR specificities confirmed that positive selection into

the CD4 lineage is always less efficient in the absence of Itk than in its presence, although the magnitude of the defect varied with the avidity of each TCR analyzed (16).

# Roles in Negative Selection

Several independent lines of evidence indicate that Tec family kinases are also important for TCR signaling, leading to negative selection in the thymus. The first studies of this issue examined H-Y TCR transgenic male mice, in which the MHC class I–restricted male-specific antigen is ubiquitously expressed. Examination of Itk-deficient H-Y TCR transgenic male mice initially suggested that the absence of Itk had virtually no effect on negative selection (12). However, a subsequent study of $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ H-Y TCR transgenic male mice indicated that, in the absence of Itk or both Itk and Rlk, there is a decreased efficiency of negative selection (11). This latter study demonstrated that the absolute numbers of CD8$^+$ H-Y$^+$ peripheral T cells increased in $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice compared with controls, indicating a true failure of negative selection. Overall, these data suggest that in the absence of both Itk and Rlk, reduced TCR signaling results in a switch from negative selection to positive selection of H-Y$^+$ thymocytes (11).

The results of studies on negative selection were less clear-cut for several MHC class II–specific systems. For example, several V$\beta 3^+$ TCR transgenic lines (AND, 2B4, 5C.C7) were crossed to $Itk^{-/-}$ mice, and negative selection mediated by an endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus superantigen was examined (183). In addition, negative selection of 5C.C7 TCR transgenic thymocytes was examined in $Itk^{-/-}$ mice that were also expressing a low level of the cognate antigen for this TCR, moth cytochrome c (183, 191). In none of these cases did the number of TCR transgenic peripheral CD4$^+$ T cells ever increase in mice lacking Itk compared with wild-type controls. These findings indicated that, for the MHC class II–specific self-reactive TCRs examined, a deficiency in Itk may delay, but does not block, negative selection. Clear defects in negative selection may only result from the simultaneous absence of Itk and Rlk.

The defects in both positive and negative selection observed in the absence of Itk and/or Rlk are consistent with the known functions of Tec family kinases in T cell signaling and the role of these signaling pathways in thymic selection. As had first been described for peripheral T cells, $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ thymocytes have impaired calcium mobilization and reduced activation of the ERK MAP-kinases in response to TCR stimulation (11). Optimal calcium signaling is required for both positive and negative selection, whereas the activation of ERK1/2 is essential only for positive selection (139). Interestingly, the activation of another MAP-kinase, p38, is important for negative selection, but not positive selection (192). In contrast to the ERK MAP-kinases, p38 activation in response to TCR stimulation in thymocytes does not require the Tec family kinases Itk or Rlk (11). Overall, these data predict that positive selection is more impaired than negative selection in Tec
family kinase–deficient mice, a prediction that seems supported by the available data on this topic.

# Effects on Lineage Development and Commitment

Concurrent with repertoire selection, signaling through the TCR is also thought to influence the commitment of thymocytes to either the CD8 or CD4 lineage, depending on the MHC class I versus class II specificity of their TCR. Signaling proteins both upstream and downstream of Itk, such as Lck and ERK1/2, respectively, are important in the CD4/CD8 lineage decision (193). These data, along with the observation that $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice have altered CD4:CD8 ratios in the thymus and periphery (10, 12, 13, 155), raise the question of whether Tec family kinases are involved in this developmental process. However, in five separate model systems studied, researchers did not detect any alterations in CD4/CD8 lineage commitment (16).

Aspects of T cell differentiation other than CD4/CD8 lineage commitment are altered in $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice. For instance, $Itk^{-/-}$ mice have roughly one half the normal numbers of CD4⁺ T cells (12). In light of recent evidence that CD4⁺ T cell differentiation depends not only on the strength of the TCR signal but also on the consistency and duration of that signal (194), the disruption of this process in the absence of Itk seems reasonable. However, $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice have no reductions in the percentage or numbers of CD4⁺ T cells compared with wild-type mice (10). This latter observation may reflect that defects in negative selection balance out defects in CD4⁺ T cell selection and differentiation in $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice, which results in an overall similar frequency of selectable TCRs in these mice compared with wild-type controls. This notion also predicts that the CD4⁺ T cells present in $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice are comprised of a different repertoire of TCR specificities than is seen in wild-type mice. In contrast, $Itk^{-/-}$ mice have near-normal numbers of CD8⁺ peripheral T cells and a higher percentage and total number of CD8 SP cells in the thymus. Even more strikingly, $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice have increased numbers of CD8⁺ thymocytes and peripheral T cells. Furthermore, the phenotypes of the CD8⁺ thymocytes and T cells in both $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice are unique in that they have a memory or previously activated T cell phenotype (16). These latter findings indicate that Itk and/or Rlk play an as-yet-undefined role in CD8⁺ T cell differentiation and homeostasis.

A role for Itk and/or Rlk in CD4⁺ T cell homeostasis is also likely as $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice have two- to threefold increases in the percentage of memory/activated-phenotype peripheral CD4⁺ T cells (15, 183). One recent study reports that the development and survival of a nonconventional T cell subset, NKT cells, is also impaired in the absence of Itk (195). Interestingly, this defect manifested as an accumulation of immature NKT cells in $Itk^{-/-}$ mice. This study also concluded that Itk may be important in the peripheral homeostasis of
NKT cells, on the basis of the findings that NKT cells are progressively lost as $Itk^{-/-}$ mice age.

# Effects on Pre-TCR Signaling

Although an important role for Tec family kinases in the later, TCR-dependent stages of T cell development in the thymus has been clearly demonstrated, no obvious defects in pre-TCR signaling have been observed in the absence of Itk and/or Rlk (10, 12, 16, 155). At the CD3$^-$CD4$^-$CD8$^-$ (triple negative; TN) stage of thymocyte development, proper signals downstream of the pre-TCR are required for cells to progress to the double positive (DP) stage. Numerous signaling proteins, such as Lck, LAT, and SLP-76, all of which are part of the same TCR signaling pathway as the Tec family kinases, are crucial for proper T cell development at this stage (196). Interference with, or elimination of, any of these proteins generally leads to a severe block in T cell development at the TN-DP transition (Table 3). In both $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice, approximately normal numbers of DP thymocytes are observed; furthermore, closer inspection of the TN stages of thymocyte development in these mice reveals a normal distribution of four described TN subsets (TN1–TN4). An impairment in pre-TCR-dependent thymocyte maturation signals is only detected in mixed bone marrow chimeras, in which $Itk^{-/-}$ or $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ bone marrow is competing with wild-type bone marrow to repopulate the thymus of an irradiated host. However, even in these latter experiments, the defect observed in the $Itk^{-/-}$ or $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ thymocytes is not absolute but rather results in a selective reduction of the Tec family kinase-deficient cells at the TN-DP transition (J.A. Lucas & L.J. Berg, unpublished observation).

One potential explanation for why pre-TCR signaling is not significantly impaired in the absence of Itk and/or Rlk is that Tec family kinase-dependent signaling may not be completely abolished in these cells, owing to the presence of Tec. An alternative explanation is that an independent pathway for PLC-$\gamma$1 activation, such as potential phosphorylation by the Syk tyrosine kinase, may be upregulated in TN thymocytes compared with later stages of T cell development.

## ROLE OF TEC FAMILY KINASES IN T CELL EFFECTOR FUNCTIONS

### Proliferation and IL-2 Production

The importance of the Tec kinases in T cells is underscored by the effects of these kinases on mature T cell function. In particular, mutations affecting Itk reduce T cell proliferation in response to anti-CD3 antibodies, concanavalin A, allogeneic MHC, or peptide antigen (for TCR transgenic cells) (10, 12, 13, 15). Decreased IL-2 production from $Itk^{-/-}$ T cells has been documented in response to anti-CD3 antibodies or upon antigen stimulation (10, 13, 15, 98). Accordingly, IL-2 can substantially rescue proliferative defects in Itk-deficient T cells (10, 12). Defects
in proliferation and IL-2 production are worse in T cells lacking both Itk and Rlk, supporting a degree of genetic redundancy between these two kinases (10). In contrast to observations with $Itk^{-/-}$ cells, however, high-dose IL-2 failed to rescue fully the proliferative defects of $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ splenocytes. This observation likely results from the more severe defects in CD25 induction in $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ T cells, even in the presence of exogenous IL-2 (10).

Nonetheless, costimulation with anti-CD28 can improve many of these responses, particularly in $Itk^{-/-}$ cells. Indeed, stimulation of total splenocytes with anti-CD3 minimizes the proliferative defects associated with Itk deficiency (compare References 10 and 12). Similarly, stimulation of Itk-deficient T cells with antigen in the context of APCs reveals less severe reductions in proliferation than is seen with anti-CD3 stimulation of purified CD4 cells, again supporting the role of costimulation in rescuing defects associated with Itk deficiency (15).

## Tec Family Kinases and T Helper Cell Differentiation

As discussed above, mutations affecting the Tec kinases do not prevent T cell development or T cell responses, but instead appear to modify or decrease the efficiency of activation, leading to altered development and function. Whether this is solely due to genetic redundancy between the kinases is not known. However, in mature CD4+ T helper cell effector functions, distinct phenotypes associated with the individual kinases have emerged (Table 3).

### Rlk AND Th1 DIFFERENTIATION

A role for Tec kinases in T helper cell differentiation and function was first suggested by the expression pattern of Rlk, which is preferentially found in both mouse and human Th1 but not Th2 cell clones (31, 33). This finding has been recently confirmed by real-time PCR and protein analyses in primary mouse T helper cells differentiated in culture (25, 26). Further experiments have shown that overexpression of Rlk can activate an IFN-$\gamma$ reporter construct and increase expression of IFN-$\gamma$ but not IL-4 in Jurkat cells (33). Conversely, antisense oligonucleotides to the Rlk message reduced IFN-$\gamma$ production in peripheral blood T cells and T cell clones. Induction of IFN-$\gamma$ required nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of Rlk. Moreover, a second paper from this group demonstrated that Rlk could directly bind to a sequence upstream of the IFN-$\gamma$ gene start site, as well as to a related sequence in the promoters of CCR5 and TNF-$\alpha$ (89). Intriguingly, gene delivery of a Rlk expression plasmid with a hemagglutinin virus of Japan (HVJ) envelope vector in mice was found to increase expression of IFN-$\gamma$, but not of IL-4 or IL-2, from splenocytes and to decrease IgE production (197). However, comparisons with other Tec family kinases were not reported in these studies. One should note that $Rlk^{-/-}$ mouse T cells do not exhibit obvious defects in IFN-$\gamma$ production or responses to a Th1-inducing pathogen, *Toxoplasma gondii* (10, 17). Mutation of the adapter molecule RIBP/TSAd/LAD, which interacts with both Rlk and Itk, decreases production of IL-2 and IFN-$\gamma$, but not of IL-4 (99).
Itk AND Th2 DIFFERENTIATION In vitro stimulation of cells from Tec family kinase–deficient mice initially suggested that $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ T cells exhibit global defects in cytokine production (10, 17; J. Debnath & P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished). Moreover, TGF-$\beta$ treatment of T cells, which represses expression of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, is associated with decreased Ca${}^{2+}$ mobilization and phosphorylation of Itk (198). However, several studies now argue that Itk plays a specific role in regulating Th2 cytokine production. Stimulation of naive CD4 cells from Itk-deficient mice demonstrates reduced production of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 (14, 26). Conversely, T cells from mice deficient in cyclophilin A, a negative regulator of Itk activity, exhibit increased production of Th2 cytokines, although increased Itk activity in these T cells has not been directly demonstrated (25). Under certain conditions, including stimulation with low-dose antigen or altered peptide ligands, Itk-deficient cells show increased production of IFN-$\gamma$ (26). A recent study suggests that this increase in IFN-$\gamma$ may result from abnormal regulation of T-bet expression, which is elevated after stimulation of Itk-deficient CD4 cells (26).

Multiple examples of defective Th2 responses in vivo have been reported in Itk-deficient mice. These include challenge with Th2-inducing parasites such as *Nippostrongylus brasiliensis*, *Leishmania major*, and *Schistosome mansoni* (14, 17). For both *L. major* and *S. mansoni*, Itk deficiency was associated with a change to a Th1 response, consistent with the in vitro T-bet findings. This defect in Th2 responses is not limited to responses to parasitic infections; $Itk^{-/-}$ animals also show impaired responses, including decreased T cell infiltration, mucus production, and local Th2 cytokine production in an inhaled Ova-induced model of allergic asthma (18). A recently described inhibitor of Itk decreased lung inflammation in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced allergy/asthma (198a). Increased Itk expression has also been observed in humans with atopic dermatitis (199).

Surprisingly, mutation of both Rlk and Itk reverses the Itk Th2 defect in response to *S. mansoni* eggs (17). A clue to understanding this observation came from the finding that $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ cells appear to have a defect in GATA-3 regulation and fail to downregulate GATA-3 upon TCR stimulation (17). Stimulation of cells with PMA and ionomycin can rescue GATA-3 repression, suggesting that the impaired GATA-3 regulation is secondary to their TCR signaling defects.

Nonetheless, the roles of the Tec family kinases in T helper cell responses may be more complex. A recent paper demonstrates that Itk can phosphorylate T-bet and that mutation of this T-bet phosphorylation site prevents the ability of T-bet to bind to GATA-3 and repress its DNA binding activity (199a). Phosphorylation of T-bet was reduced in Itk-deficient T cells. Although it is difficult to resolve these data with the Th2 defect in Itk-deficient mice, both $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice have many mature cells that express memory phenotype markers (16; P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished) and these cells can produce elevated levels of Th2 cytokines. The regulation of cytokine production by these cells and its influence on in vivo responses remains to be evaluated. $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ mice show increased IgE levels both at baseline and after challenge (17, 18), and $Itk^{-/-}$ mice

show evidence of eosinophilia, suggesting complex effects that may influence multiple cell types. Whether defects in cytokine production from naive cells are the only cause of the altered responses to Th2-inducing agents in $Itk^{-/-}$ mice is also unclear. Two recent reports demonstrate defective recruitment of Itk-deficient T cells into the lung either in response to inhaled Ova or SDF-1α, suggesting that migration defects could contribute to the Th2 defects in these mice (18, 57). Nonetheless, on the basis of in vitro migration results, one might predict even more impaired migration of $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ T cells (58). Yet these cells do mount some Th2 responses.

The effects of other cell types on these phenotypes also remain to be addressed. In particular, Itk-deficient mice have altered development and decreased numbers of NKT cells, a known early source of IL-4 production (195). Altered responses of NK cells and mast cells could also contribute to these defects in vivo (183). Thus, at this time, it remains unclear whether the Th2 defect in Itk-deficient cells result from a specific function of Itk required for Th2 differentiation, the distinct patterns of expression of Rlk and Itk in T helper cells, or other factors.

Finally, there is increased expression of Tec in Th2 cells compared with Th1 cells (35). Interestingly, overexpression of Tec can enhance, and kinase-inactive Tec can inhibit, PMA or PMA plus CD28-induced activation of both IL-2 and IL-4 reporter constructs (64), again supporting distinct functions for this family member.

## Effects on CD8 Cell Function and Responses to Viral Infection

Although most studies have concentrated on the role of the Tec family kinases in CD4 effector cells, CD8-mediated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are also impaired by mutations affecting the Tec kinases. Again, Itk appears to be the major player, with reduced cytotoxicity to allogeneic splenocytes that is worsened by mutation of both Rlk and Itk (P.L. Schwartzberg & J. Debnath, unpublished). An initial report suggested that after infection with viral agents, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), vaccinia, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Itk-deficient animals show a two- to sixfold decrease in antiviral cytolytic activity (200). Defects were most pronounced in response to VSV, which is less virulent and more dependent on IL-2 and CD28 stimulation for optimal response. In vitro proliferation assays reveal that defects could be partially rescued with addition of IL-2. Despite the defects in CTL activity, clearance of LCMV appeared normal, whereas clearance of vaccinia was more variable. A more recent study of LCMV infection, however, suggests that viral clearance is delayed (L. Atherly & L.J. Berg, unpublished). Moreover, this study showed no difference in the cytolytic activity of $Itk^{-/-}$ and $Rlk^{-/-}Itk^{-/-}$ cells relative to wild-type cells on a per cell basis, but rather showed decreased expansion of viral-specific cells and IFN-γ production in response to infection. Surprisingly, in the initial study, anti-VSV-specific antibody titres and VSV clearance appeared normal in $Itk^{-/-}$ mice, suggesting normal T cell help for immunoglobulin production (200).

Effects on Cell Survival

In B and mast cells, multiple lines of evidence suggest that Btk participates in cell survival pathways. Btk-deficient cells show reduced susceptibility to BCR-, IL-3-withdrawal-, and radiation-induced apoptosis but increased susceptibility to anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis (201). These findings may seem paradoxical, but they likely result from the effects of Btk on multiple signaling pathways. Thus, defects in BCR signaling in Btk-deficient cells likely prevent effective BCR-induced apoptosis. In contrast, a direct influence on Fas-mediated pathways is suggested by a study showing that Btk can bind Fas and prevent interaction of Fas with FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) (202). Given recent evidence for defective TCR signaling and Ca²⁺ mobilization in patients harboring a mutation of caspase 8 (203), it is intriguing to speculate that Tec family kinases may be involved in common pathways downstream from antigen and TNF family receptors.

In T cells, deficiency of Itk or both Itk and Rlk decreases TCR-stimulated or antigen-induced cell death of mature cells (10, 15). Similar findings were reported for SEB-induced deletion of peripheral T cells in *Itk⁻/⁻* animals (15). For *Itk⁻/⁻* and *Rlk⁻/⁻Itk⁻/⁻* thymocytes, investigators have also reported defective anti-CD3-plus anti-CD28-mediated killing of DP cells, an in vitro model of thymocyte deletion (11). *Rlk⁻/⁻Itk⁻/⁻* T cells and thymocytes exhibited the most severe defects in these processes. The defect in activation-induced cell death in mature cells has been extensively examined in Itk-deficient cells and correlates with abnormal induction of FasL, which is likely to be secondary to decreased induction of NFATc2 and altered regulation of Egr2 and Egr3 (15). Investigators have not observed defects in response to anti-Fas engagement in either mature cells from Itk-deficient mice or DP thymocytes from *Itk⁻/⁻* or *Rlk⁻/⁻Itk⁻/⁻* mice, suggesting that, in T cells, these Tec family kinases do not directly affect Fas signaling (11, 15). How these defects in activation-induced cell death and survival contribute to the phenotypes associated with mutations of these kinases, particularly in T helper cell differentiation and abnormal responses to infectious agents, has not been examined. Furthermore, whether defects in antigen-induced cell death contribute to the generation of the large population of “memory” phenotype cells in *Itk⁻/⁻* and *Rlk⁻/⁻Itk⁻/⁻* mice is not known.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Over the past several years, Tec family kinases have emerged as important regulators of TCR signaling that contribute to the activation of PLC-γ1. Recent studies suggest that these kinases also play important roles in pathways controlling actin cytoskeleton reorganization and adhesion (Figure 4, Table 3). In these pathways, Itk appears to be the major player, perhaps reflecting its high levels of expression in T cells. However, unlike the proximal kinases and adapters, Tec kinases are not absolutely required for T cell development or signaling, giving rise to the idea that
Tec kinases are modulators or amplifiers of these signals. This type of modulatory effect on signaling could result in part from the requirement for Tec kinases for prolonged Ca²⁺ influx, actin reorganization, and adhesion, all of which can influence the duration of TCR contacts and signaling.

Mutations affecting Tec kinases, therefore, do not prevent T cell development nor block TCR signaling but rather reduce TCR signaling in a manner that can alter thymocyte development and mature T cell differentiation and function. Indeed, perhaps some of the most interesting aspects of Tec family kinase biology in T cells are their effects on T helper cells. Although these kinases are at least partially functionally redundant for Ca²⁺ signaling pathways, an emerging theme is that each of these kinases also has distinct roles in T cell biology, particularly in Thelper cell differentiation, where Itk has emerged as an important regulator of Th2 differentiation and Rlk as a potential regulator of Th1 differentiation. Although the effects of these kinases are complex, these studies suggest that Tec family kinases are potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

Finally, although in T cells the roles of Tec kinases have been best studied in TCR and costimulatory pathways, new data suggest that these kinases also participate in similar signaling pathways regulating Rho GTPases, cell polarization, and migration downstream from G protein-coupled chemokine receptors (Figure 4). The functions of Tec family kinases in other signaling pathways, including those from growth factor and cytokine receptors, and how these may affect T cell functional responses, await further study.
