# Regulation of tumour necrosis factor signalling: live or let die

**Dirk Brenner**${}^{1*}$, **Heiko Blaser**${}^{2*}$ and **Tak W. Mak**${}^{2-4}$

**Abstract** | Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has important roles in mammalian immunity and cellular homeostasis. Deregulation of TNF receptor (TNFR) signalling is associated with many inflammatory disorders, including various types of arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and targeting TNF has been an effective therapeutic strategy in these diseases. This Review focuses on the recent advances that have been made in understanding TNFR signalling and the consequences of its deregulation for cellular survival, apoptosis and regulated necrosis. We discuss how TNF-induced survival signals are distinguished from those that lead to cell death. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the role of TNF in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and we discuss up-to-date and future treatment strategies for these disorders.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is one of the most intensively studied cytokines of the immune system. Decades of work has established that TNF is a central player within a complicated network of cytokines, and that it regulates not only pro-inflammatory responses but also processes as diverse as cellular communication, cell differentiation and cell death. It is due to these far-reaching and important regulatory functions of TNF that alterations to its biology have been associated with multiple diseases, including autoimmunity and cancer.

TNF activity was described by Carswell in 1975, and the molecule was later cloned, purified and initially characterized by Aggarwal and colleagues in the mid-1980s${}^{1-3}$. These important discoveries were the first steps in characterizing two prominent protein superfamilies: the TNF superfamily (TNFSF) and the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). To date, 19 ligands and 29 receptors of the TNFSF and TNFRSF, respectively, have been identified${}^{2}$. A characteristic hallmark of members of the TNFSF is their ability to promote pro-inflammatory signalling${}^{3}$.

Of all of the members of the TNFSF and TNFRSF, TNF and its two receptors — TNFR1 and TNFR2 — are the best characterized. TNF is initially expressed as a trimeric type II transmembrane protein. This can be cleaved by the metalloproteinase TNF-converting enzyme (TACE; also known as ADAM17), which is controlled by inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRHOM2), to give rise to soluble extracellular TNF${}^{4-9}$. The expression of membrane-bound TNF and the generation of its soluble form are tightly regulated processes that occur in response to diverse stimuli. Soluble TNF can bind to either TNFR1 or TNFR2, which differ in their structure and expression pattern, as well as in the signalling pathways that they induce once they are engaged${}^{10}$. Although TNFR1 is expressed by almost every mammalian cell type, TNFR2 expression is essentially restricted to immune cells and endothelial cells${}^{10}$. The binding of TNF to either TNFR1 or TNFR2 can ultimately activate the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), but the signalling cascades that lead from each receptor to NF-κB activation are markedly different. These complexities, together with the diverse regulation of the expression of TNF itself, result in finely tuned, cell type-specific responses to TNF. In this Review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of TNFR signalling and explain how this knowledge can be used to design novel therapies.

## TNF signalling in NF-κB activation

### TNFR1 and TNFR2 signalling elements

The extracellular domains of both TNFR1 and TNFR2 are rich in cysteine and able to bind to the same TNF ligand. However, their intracellular domains are strikingly different. TNFR1 contains a cytoplasmic ‘death domain’, which is a conserved sequence of 80 amino acids that forms a distinctive fold${}^{11,12}$. This death domain enables TNFR1 to recruit the adaptor molecule TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which is a crucial component of the TNFR1 signalling complex${}^{13}$ (FIG. 1). By contrast, TNFR2 lacks the cytoplasmic death domain sequence and recruits TNFR-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) and TRAF2 rather than TRADD${}^{12-14}$. Both TNFR1–TRADD signalling and TNFR2 signalling through TRAF1 and TRAF2 can lead to NF-κB activation, but whereas TNFR2 engagement

in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor that enables the recruitment of TRADD, which in turn recruits receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)¹³,¹⁸,¹⁹. Once bound together, TNFR1, TRADD and RIPK1 initiate the assembly of TNFR1 complex I, which directs downstream signalling events.

The next step in complex I formation is the recruitment of TRAF2, which binds to the amino-terminal TRAF-binding domain of TRADD²⁰. At this point, the signalling cascades downstream of TNFR1–TRADD–RIPK1–TRAF2 and TNFR2–TRAF2 become similar again, but the binding of TRAF2 to TNFR2 is much weaker than that of TRAF2 to TRADD²¹. This difference suggests that an affinity-based regulatory mechanism may exist to control these two TNF-induced pathways. It is tempting to speculate that, at a certain TNF concentration, TNFR2 might act as a signalling dampener to attenuate or alter the strength or outcome of signalling by TNFR1 in the same cell²¹⁻²³. Downstream of this, TRAF2 binds to cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1; also known as BIRC2) and cIAP2 (also known as BIRC3). However, studies in mice suggest that TRADD, TRAF2, RIPK1 and the cIAPs are all important, but not indispensable, for TNFR1-induced NF-κB activation²⁴⁻³⁰.

Role of ubiquitylation. Post-translational modification of the proteins involved in TNF signalling cascades has a major role in determining TNF-induced outcomes. The primary modification relevant to our discussion here is ubiquitylation, which involves the covalent linkage of the highly conserved ubiquitin protein to a target protein. The molecular details of ubiquitylation have been reviewed extensively elsewhere³¹,³². Briefly, it is a hierarchical three-step process involving E1 ubiquitin-activating, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating and E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes attaching defined strings of ubiquitin molecules to target proteins to form polyubiquitylated conjugates³³. The length of the attached ubiquitin chain may alter the fate of the target protein, as may the nature of the covalent bond linkage between ubiquitin proteins itself. These polyubiquitin linkages usually involve specific lysine or methionine residues. For TNF-induced signalling, polyubiquitylation via K11, K48 or K63 branched linkages, or alternatively via M1 linear linkages, has a predominant role in determining target protein fate. For example, proteins that are attached to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains are targeted for degradation³¹; such destruction of a signalling mediator contributes to the shutdown of intracellular signalling. By contrast, K63- and M1-linked polyubiquitylation events reinforce protein scaffolding and cellular activation. Both degradative and activating functions have been described for K11-linked polyubiquitin chains³².

With respect to TNF-induced NF-κB activation, it was originally thought that the creation of a K63-linked ubiquitylated scaffold containing RIPK1 was crucial for recruiting downstream signalling mediators. Both cIAP1 and cIAP2 were shown to add K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1 at its acceptor site K377 (REFS 34,35),

Figure 1 | TNFR1 complex I contains ubiquitylated RIPK1 and activates nuclear factor-κB, JNK and p38 signalling. Following the binding of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNFR1 binds to TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which recruits receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) or TRAF5 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) or cIAP2 to form TNFR1 signalling complex I. TNFR2 binds to TRAF1 or TRAF2 directly to recruit cIAP1 or cIAP2. Both cIAP1 and cIAP2 are E3 ubiquitin ligases that add K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1 and other components of the signalling complex. The ubiquitin ligase activity of the cIAPs is needed to recruit the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which adds M1-linked linear polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1. K63-polyubiquitylated RIPK1 recruits TGFβ-activated kinase 1 and MAP3K7-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TAB3 and TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which activate signalling mediated by JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, as well as the IkB kinase (IKK) complex. The IKK complex then activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling, which leads to the transcription of anti-apoptotic factors — such as the long isoform of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP_L) and BCL-XL (also known as BCL2L1) — that promote cell survival. NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator.

promotes cell survival via this pathway, TNFR1–TRADD signalling can result in either cell survival or cell death depending on downstream signalling events and cellular context. It is still not entirely clear how TNFR1 and TNFR2 signalling are regulated, apart from through the differential expression patterns of TNFR1 and TNFR2 themselves. In many cases, immune cells that express TNFR2 also express TNFR1, and this makes predicting the outcome of TNF-mediated signalling a challenge. It has been shown that the relative levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 on the surface of such cells and their activation status in a specific context have an important role in determining cell fate¹⁵,¹⁶. However, crosstalk between these receptors is also possible, and the past decade has seen the formulation of several new concepts that have broadened our view of the effects of TNF-induced signalling.

Upon engagement by TNF, TNFR1 translocates to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, and this is crucial for NF-κB activation¹⁷. The binding of TNF to the pre-assembled TNFR1 induces a conformational change

and TRAF2 and TRAF5 were also thought to function as E3 ligases that attached K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1 (REF. 36). However, whether TRAF2 truly has an E3 ligase function is the subject of much debate^{37–39}, leaving cIAP1 and cIAP2 as the most likely candidates. Interestingly, some cells (for example, mouse embryonic fibroblasts) can recruit RIPK1 to TNFR1 independently of TRADD, but RIPK1 cannot be ubiquitylated because recruitment of the ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2 via TRAF2 requires TRADD^{26,27}.

In addition to controversy about the enzyme responsible, the relevance of the K63 linkage has been questioned. An elegant ubiquitin-replacement study showed that K63-linked polyubiquitin chains cannot be solely responsible for TNF-κB activation, implying the involvement of other linkages or mechanisms^{40}. Indeed, it was subsequently demonstrated that, in addition to K63-linked ubiquitin chains, RIPK1 simultaneously contains K11-, K48- and M1-linked polyubiquitin chains^{41–43}.

A major step in clarifying the role of ubiquitylation in TNF signalling was the identification and characterization of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC)^{41,44}. LUBAC consists of three proteins: haeme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL1; also known as RBCK1), HOIL1-interacting protein (HOIP; also known as RNF31) and SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting protein SHARPIN^{41,42,45–47}. Interestingly, the recruitment of LUBAC to complex I depends on the K63-polyubiquitylation activity of cIAP1 and cIAP2. LUBAC association with the TNFR signalling complex is not strictly RIPK1 dependent (RIPK1 is a prominent target of cIAP1 and cIAP2), but is increased in the presence of RIPK1. Once recruited, LUBAC stabilizes complex I by catalysing the attachment of a linear M1-linked polyubiquitin chain, usually to RIPK1 (REFS 18,41,45). The relevance of K63-linked as opposed to M1-linked linear polyubiquitylation events in TNFR1 signalling remains under debate. It is clear that both processes are involved in TNF-induced signal transduction, but their specific and relative contributions are not entirely defined. Nevertheless, it is currently generally accepted that RIPK1 is a central molecular switch in complex I, and that all downstream signalling by this complex depends on the ubiquitylation status of RIPK1 (see below).

**Role of NF-κB essential modulator.** Ubiquitin chains attached to RIPK1 by LUBAC recruit the IkB kinase (IKK) complex to the TNFR1 signalling core^{41,44}. The IKK complex consists of three subunits: two kinases called IKKα and IKKβ, and the regulatory subunit NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO; also known as IKKγ)^{48,49}. Once activated, IKK phosphorylates NF-κB inhibitor-α (IkBα), which binds to NF-κB during steady-state conditions and keeps it inactive in the cytoplasm. Upon its phosphorylation, IkBα is targeted for K48-linked ubiquitylation followed by degradation, which releases NF-κB from suppression. Newly freed NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of its numerous target genes, which are involved in cell survival and proliferation^{48,49}.

The details of IKK-driven NF-κB activation have been previously summarized in two comprehensive reviews and will not be discussed further here^{48,49}.

Membrane-proximal recruitment of NEMO to ubiquitylated RIPK1 is crucial for IKK activation and thus NF-κB activation, as has been particularly well demonstrated for the T cell receptor-dependent pathway of NF-κB activation in T cells^{50}. Accordingly, mutations in the ubiquitin-binding domain of NEMO blunt NF-κB activation in response to TNF^{34,51}. In binding to ubiquitylated RIPK1, NEMO shows significantly higher affinity for M1-linked linear polyubiquitin chains than for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains^{52,53}. In addition, NEMO can bind to K11-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK1 (REF. 43). As a result, NEMO recruitment might be modulated by the relative concentrations of the various types of polyubiquitylated chains present within complex I. The various types (K11-, K48-, K63- and M1-linked) and concentrations of polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK1 may permit multiple cooperative or parallel possibilities for recruiting NEMO. This mechanism opens up interesting options for fine-tuning ubiquitin-dependent signalling to modulate the activity of recruited targets, as one ubiquitin linkage might be more dominant in a specific pathway. Such factors might explain why K63-linked polyubiquitin chains seem to be dispensable for TNF-mediated NF-κB activation but not for interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-mediated NF-κB activation^{40}.

NEMO itself may undergo M1-linked linear polyubiquitylation, but it is unclear when or where this modification occurs^{42,44}. Based on signalling hierarchy, it seems unlikely that M1-linked linear polyubiquitylation of NEMO precedes its recruitment to the TNFR1 signalling core. In any case, the polyubiquitin chains present at NEMO and RIPK1 are bound by the ubiquitin-binding protein TGFβ-activated kinase 1 and MAP3K7-binding protein 2 (TAB2) or TAB3, which interact with TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). This binding is a crucial step in IKK activation because TAK1 is the direct initiator of this process^{34,54,55}. TAK1 also phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs), which trigger the activation of the JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways^{54–56}.

Intriguingly, the TAB–TAK1 complex binds to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of RIPK1 (FIG. 1) with higher affinity than to M1-linked polyubiquitin chains^{34,57}. To make matters more complex, there is recent evidence from studies of IL-1β-dependent signalling that hybrid K63- and M1-linked polyubiquitin chains may exist, which can recruit NEMO using the M1-linked polyubiquitin portion and simultaneously recruit TAB–TAK1 using the K63-linked polyubiquitin portion^{58}. Such a mechanism would allow the IKK complex to efficiently colocalize with and become activated within TNFR1 complex I by binding to the same polyubiquitin chain. However, to date, these hybrid polyubiquitin chains have only been detected in the IL-1β-dependent signalling pathway^{58}. It will be interesting to determine whether this mechanism operates in other pathways — particularly in TNF-mediated signalling — and whether hybrid polyubiquitin chains can in fact be attached to RIPK1.

TNF signalling in apoptosis

TNF is a very versatile cytokine with pleiotropic functions in immunity, inflammation and cell death³. Interestingly, the mechanism by which these various functions of TNF are mediated is not just a simple matter of binding to different receptors. In fact, the binding of TNF to TNFR1 can induce either cell survival or different forms of cell death; therefore, the regulation of TNF signal transduction is a constant balancing act between these opposing functions.

Classical apoptosis. As described above, TNF-induced TNFR1 signalling leading to the NF-κB activation that supports cell survival and inflammation is mediated by the membrane-bound TNFR1–TRADD–RIPK1–TRAF2 signalling core known as complex I⁵⁹. However, based on its structure, TNFR1 is classified as a death receptor and classical apoptosis was shown to occur upon TNF binding to TNFR1 (REFS 2,3). The signalling mediators of the classical apoptotic pathway were first defined by studying the death receptor FAS (also known as CD95 and TNFRSF6)¹¹. The death domain fold in the cytoplasmic portion of the FAS protein was shown to bind to FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD); this is the first step in the formation of a membrane-bound death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). The death effector domain of FADD then recruits procaspase 8 to form a homodimer that autocatalytically removes its pro-domains, stabilizing an active conformation and resulting in the release of an activated caspase 8 homodimer into the cytoplasm. This activated caspase 8 molecule uses its proteolytic activity to target and cleave numerous intracellular substrates, including the executioner caspases that drive classical apoptosis¹¹,⁶⁰. Depending on the situation, this cytoplasmic apoptotic signalling can be amplified or modified by the mitochondrial cell death pathway, which has been reviewed elsewhere⁶¹.

In contrast to FAS-mediated classical apoptosis, the apoptotic cascade initiated by TNF binding to TNFR1 is much more complicated. The process can be mediated by either one of two TNFR1 signalling complexes known as TNFR1 complex IIa and complex IIb. The initial assembly of these protein complexes upon TNFR1 stimulation occurs proximal to the membrane, but they translocate to the cytosol to continue further complex formation. As well as the apoptosis mediators mentioned above, the cytosolic complexes IIa and IIb contain additional components (FIG. 2).

and the cell dies. Non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 leads to dissociation of a RIPK1-containing complex from the membrane and the formation of protein complexes that promote cell death.

Several ubiquitin-modifying proteins can act on RIPK1. Both the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 (also known as TNFAIP3) and the deubiquitylating enzyme Cezanne (also known as OTUD7B) can remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1 (REFS 64,65). Subsequently, A20 and/or the E3 ubiquitin ligase caspase regulator 2 (CARP2; also known as RFFL) add K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1, which triggers its degradation and thus the suppression of TNF-induced NF-κB signalling⁶⁵,⁶⁶. In addition, A20 can use its carboxy-terminal zinc finger 7 domain to bind to M1-linked polyubiquitin chains, thereby preventing the binding of LUBAC to NEMO and blocking TNF-induced LUBAC-mediated NF-κB activation⁶⁷.

Another deubiquitylating enzyme that acts on RIPK1 and is crucial for shutting down TNF-induced NF-κB activation is cylindromatosis (CYLD)⁶⁸,⁶⁹. CYLD associates with complex I via TRAF2 and removes both K63- and M1-linked polyubiquitin chains from target proteins¹⁶²,⁵⁷,⁶⁸,⁷⁰. Recent evidence suggests that CYLD removes K63- and M1-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1, causing the deubiquitylated RIPK1 to dissociate from the membrane-bound TNFR1 signalling core⁶⁸. This freed and deubiquitylated RIPK1 then assembles in the cytosol with TRADD, FADD, a pro-caspase 8 homodimer, and a heterodimer of pro-caspase 8 and the long isoform of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP<sub>L</sub>; also known as the long isoform of CFLAR) to form complex IIa (FIG. 2). It is important to note that although RIPK1 initiates the assembly of complex IIa, RIPK1 is inactivated by a FLIP<sub>L</sub>-pro-caspase 8 heterodimer in order to proceed with the apoptotic programme (see below). Once complex IIa is assembled, pro-caspase 8 undergoes autocatalytic cleavage and activation, thereby releasing active caspase 8 into the cytosol to trigger the execution of the classical apoptotic programme⁵⁹,⁶².

Role of cIAPs and formation of complex IIb. An alternative independent complex IIb that also promotes classical apoptosis is assembled under conditions in which the E3 ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2 are depleted⁶⁸ (FIG. 2). The degradation or depletion of cIAPs reduces or prevents RIPK1 ubiquitylation³⁶,⁶⁸. This non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 soon dissociates from membrane-bound complex I. In a process that depends on the kinase activity of RIPK1 but does not involve TRADD recruitment, non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 assembles with RIPK3, pro-caspase 8 and FLIP<sub>L</sub> to form complex IIb, which then induces apoptosis in a manner similar to complex IIa⁶⁸,⁷¹. As complex IIb is nucleated by RIPK1 and does not require TRADD, it is also known as the ripoptosome. Similarly to complex IIa, cleavage and inactivation of cytosolic RIPK1 or RIPK3 (that is not incorporated into complex IIb) is essential for the apoptotic cascade (see below).

RIPK1 as a central molecular switch. An important molecular switch that determines whether TNF-TNFR1 signalling mediates cell survival or apoptosis seems to be the ubiquitylation status of RIPK1. Not only is the polyubiquitylation of RIPK1 bound to TRADD essential for NF-κB activation (as discussed above), but it also prevents the formation of complex IIa and complex IIb and thus death induction, such that the cell survives³⁴,³⁵,⁶²,⁶³. Conversely, when RIPK1 is not ubiquitylated, TNF-driven NF-κB signalling is turned off so that TNF-driven apoptotic signalling dominates

Figure 2 | TNF-induced apoptosis requires non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 and active caspases. The formation of cytosolic tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) complex IIa and complex IIb depends on non-ubiquitylated receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). For the formation of complex IIa, ubiquitylated RIPK1 in complex I is deubiquitylated by cylindromatosis (CYLD). This deubiquitylated RIPK1 dissociates from the membrane-bound complex and moves into the cytosol, where it interacts with TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), pro-caspase 8 and the long isoform of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP_L) to form complex IIa. By contrast, complex IIb is formed when the RIPK1 in complex I is not ubiquitylated in the first place owing to conditions that have resulted in the depletion of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs; which normally ubiquitylate RIPK1). This non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 dissociates from complex I, moves into the cytosol, and assembles with FADD, pro-caspase 8, FLIP_L and RIPK3 (but not TRADD) to form complex IIb. Formation of complex IIb, which has also been named the ripoptosome, depends on the kinase activity of RIPK1. In both complex IIa and complex IIb, pro-caspase 8 forms both homodimers and a heterodimer with FLIP_L. For either complex IIa or complex IIb to prevent necrosis, both RIPK1 and RIPK3 must be inactivated by the cleavage activity of the pro-caspase 8–FLIP_L heterodimer or fully activated caspase 8. The pro-caspase 8 homodimer generates active caspase 8, which is released from complex IIa and complex IIb. This active caspase 8 in the cytosol then carries out cleavage reactions to activate downstream executioner caspases and thus induce classical apoptosis.

The degradation of cIAP1 or cIAP2 can be induced by the release of second mitochondria-derived activator caspase (SMAC; also known as DIABLO) from the mitochondria<sup>72</sup>. In an experimental setting, SMAC mimetics bind to the baculovirus IAP repeat domain of cIAP1 and cIAP2 and thereby turn on their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity<sup>73</sup>. This action triggers auto-ubiquitylation of cIAP1 and cIAP2, followed by their degradation<sup>74–76</sup>. Interestingly, this degradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2 by SMAC mimetics also leads to the stabilization of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK; also known as MAP3K14)<sup>76</sup>. NIK is best known as a central inducer of the non-canonical NF-κB signalling pathway. Consequently, stabilization of NIK and the dissociation of non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 from complex I (as a result of cIAP1 and cIAP2 depletion) shifts the balance in the cell from canonical to non-canonical NF-κB signalling<sup>75,77</sup>. This latter pathway also induces autocrine TNF signalling, which stimulates and facilitates the formation of complex IIb and thus induces apoptosis<sup>68,78</sup>.

**The dual survival role of FLIP<sub>L</sub>.** Any push towards TNF-induced apoptosis is most often balanced by TNF-induced NF-κB activation<sup>79</sup>. In cells with sufficient complex I and NF-κB activity, canonical NF-κB signalling induces the upregulation of FLIP<sub>L</sub>, high levels of which exert potent inhibition of caspase 8 activation and, subsequently, apoptosis triggered by death receptor engagement<sup>59,80–82</sup>. Increased non-canonical NF-κB signalling can also lead to elevated FLIP<sub>L</sub> expression<sup>83</sup>. FLIP<sub>L</sub> is thus thought to be a key player that keeps the formation of the pro-apoptotic complex IIa and complex IIb in check<sup>59,68,83</sup>. Moreover, as FLIP<sub>L</sub> expression is induced by NF-κB signalling<sup>82</sup>, the inhibition of NF-κB activation or the functional inactivation of its targets is needed to induce apoptosis via complex IIa<sup>59,68</sup>. However, it should be noted that the anti-apoptotic programme of NF-κB is unlikely to rely solely on FLIP<sub>L</sub> upregulation as NF-κB is known to control the expression of multiple anti-apoptotic factors<sup>83</sup>. In addition, the synthesis of FLIP<sub>L</sub> is controlled not only by NF-κB-mediated regulation of gene expression but also at the level of protein stability. The stability of FLIP<sub>L</sub> is directly affected by complex I-mediated activation of JNK; JNK activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH, which mediates K48-linked polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of FLIP<sub>L</sub> (REF. 84). This mechanism influences cellular FLIP<sub>L</sub> levels in response to complex I formation and stress signalling.

Although high levels of FLIP<sub>L</sub> inhibit apoptosis, FLIP<sub>L</sub> is in fact vital for the parallel suppression of the necrotic cell death pathway. FLIP<sub>L</sub> resembles pro-caspase 8 in structure but lacks the catalytic domain<sup>11,80</sup>. Therefore, FLIP<sub>L</sub> can form a heterodimer with pro-caspase 8, preventing its homodimerization and inhibiting caspase 8 activation. Instead, the FLIP<sub>L</sub>–pro-caspase 8 heterodimer displays enzymatic activity that is different from that of the activated caspase 8 homodimer, and it cleaves only a subset of its substrates<sup>85</sup>. The formation of a FLIP<sub>L</sub>–pro-caspase 8 heterodimer in complex IIa and complex IIb or full activation of caspase 8 is crucial for cleaving and inactivating RIPK1 and RIPK3 (as well as CYLD in complex IIa), which inhibits the induction of the necrotic cell death pathway (see below)<sup>85–87</sup>. This has led to the intriguing hypothesis that the function of pro-caspase 8 is not exclusively linked with apoptosis, but that it also mediates survival by suppressing the necrotic cell death pathway<sup>86</sup>. However, more convincing data need to be provided to fully support a role for the FLIP<sub>L</sub>–pro-caspase 8 heterodimer and its substrates in preventing necrosis.

Compared with complex IIa, the situation for complex IIb-mediated cell death seems to even be more complicated owing to the existence of and regulation by three different FLIP isoforms: FLIP<sub>L</sub>, and the two short forms, FLIP<sub>S</sub> and FLIP<sub>R</sub> (REFS 81,88–90). Enforced FLIP<sub>L</sub> expression prevents the assembly of complex IIb, whereas overexpression of FLIP<sub>S</sub> (and potentially that of the closely related FLIP<sub>R</sub>) facilitates complex IIb formation<sup>71,91</sup>. All FLIP isoforms block the apoptotic programme of complex IIb, but FLIP<sub>S</sub> actively drives another pro-inflammatory cell death pathway, which is discussed in the next section.

### TNF signalling in necroptosis

#### Survival versus death decision making.
Although FLIP<sub>L</sub> is involved in regulating apoptosis, FLIP<sub>S</sub> actively drives another TNF-triggered cell death pathway that has been named regulated necrosis, or necroptosis<sup>91</sup>. Necroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of cell death in which the initiating events are caspase independent. Unlike the contained self-destruction of an apoptotic cell, a necrotic cell displays swelling of cellular organelles, rupture of the cell membrane and uncontrolled release of cellular contents into the surrounding tissue, followed ultimately by cell death<sup>92,93</sup>. At a molecular level, RIPK1 is the pivotal molecule in a complex and versatile signalling pathway that decides whether TNF–TNFR1 engagement will result in NF-κB activation (cell survival), apoptosis ('tidy' programmed cell death) or necroptosis ('messy' programmed cell death). As previously mentioned, if high levels of ubiquitylated RIPK1 are present, then membrane-bound complex I is formed, NF-κB activation proceeds and the cell survives. If the cytosolic complexes IIa and IIb have assembled, and deubiquitylated RIPK1 and RIPK3 are cleaved by an active FLIP<sub>L</sub>–pro-caspase 8 heterodimer, then other caspases become activated, apoptosis occurs and the cell dies a contained death<sup>59,68,74,75,86</sup>. However, if deubiquitylated RIPK1 is present but caspases are inactivated, such that RIPK1 and RIPK3 cannot be cleaved by a FLIP<sub>L</sub>–pro-caspase 8 heterodimer, the cell death programme switches from apoptosis to necroptosis<sup>62,94–97</sup>. This might explain why FLIP<sub>S</sub> promotes necroptosis but FLIP<sub>L</sub> does not. Similarly to FLIP<sub>L</sub>, FLIP<sub>S</sub> can also form a heterodimer with pro-caspase 8. However, based on structural differences, these FLIP<sub>S</sub>–pro-caspase 8 heterodimers are completely catalytically inactive and cannot inactivate RIPK1 or RIPK3 (REFS 91,98). This would serve as a valid hypothesis as to why the enforced expression of FLIP<sub>S</sub>, but not that of FLIP<sub>L</sub>, is associated with the RIPK1- and RIPK3-dependent necrotic cell death pathway.
REVIEW S

**Roles of RIPK1 and RIPK3.** Necroptosis depends mainly on the presence of significant levels of non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 and RIPK3 (REF. 99) (FIG. 3). Indeed, the level of RIPK3 expression in a cell largely determines its propensity to undergo necroptosis rather than apoptosis<sup>62</sup>. Similarly to RIPK1, RIPK3 belongs to the RIP family of serine-threonine kinases<sup>100,101</sup>. However, in contrast to RIPK1, RIPK3 is dispensable for TNF-induced NF-κB activation<sup>29,102</sup>. Instead, the interaction of multiple protein complexes of RIPK3 with non-ubiquitylated or deubiquitylated RIPK1 via their RHIM domains initiates the formation of a cytosolic amyloid signalling protein complex that has been named the necrosome<sup>99,103</sup>.

Proper necrosome formation is dependent on the kinase activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in combination with caspase inhibition<sup>63,103,104</sup>. Consequently, RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase activity is negatively regulated by caspase-mediated cleavage, which removes the kinase domains of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (REF. 105). Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase activities with necrostatin 1 abolishes necroptosis<sup>104</sup>. This crucial interplay between the inhibition of caspase activity and RIPK1- and RIPK3-mediated necrotic cell death has been clearly demonstrated by the finding that genetic deletion of RIPK1 and/or RIPK3 rescues the lethality observed in caspase 8-deficient or FADD-deficient mice<sup>86,87,106–108</sup>.

**Role of SHARPIN.** Necrosomes can also be formed when TNF stimulation, either in the presence of CYLD or in the absence of cIAP2, leads to the dissociation of non-ubiquitylated or deubiquitylated RIPK1 from complex I under conditions in which caspases have been inactivated. As noted above, LUBAC ubiquitylates RIPK1 via M1-linked linear linkages<sup>41</sup>, but whether M1-linked polyubiquitin chains of RIPK1 must be removed before necroptosis can occur is not entirely clear. Recent data indicate that LUBAC negatively affects necroptosis<sup>109</sup>. Deficiency of SHARPIN, a component of LUBAC, leads to instability of the remaining LUBAC components HOIL1 and HOIP, and thereby limits M1-linked polyubiquitylation<sup>42,46,47</sup>. In vivo, a naturally occurring mutation that ablates SHARPIN expression in the cpdm strain of mice results in chronic proliferative dermatitis<sup>110</sup>. This dermatitis can be prevented by crossing cpdm mutants with *Tnf*<sup>−/−</sup> or *Tnfr1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which indicates that this inflammatory disease is TNF dependent<sup>42,111</sup>. Moreover, the absence of SHARPIN in cpdm mice increases cell death in the skin, and the cell death that occurs at this site resembles necroptosis<sup>42</sup>. Accordingly, the inflammatory phenotype of cpdm mice can be rescued by crossing this strain with a mutant mouse expressing a kinase-inactive RIPK1 protein or with RIPK3-null or mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)-null mice<sup>111,112</sup>. However, a recent report shows that caspase 8 heterozygosity delays the onset of the inflammatory disease induced by the loss of SHARPIN, which indicates that, to a certain degree, apoptotic death also seems to be involved<sup>111</sup>. Taken together, these findings suggest that SHARPIN and thus M1-linked linear polyubiquitylation are involved as negative regulators of the RIPK1-dependent necroptosis signalling

Figure 3 | TNF-induced necroptosis requires non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 and inactive caspases. Formation of the necrosome is similar to complex IIa and complex IIb formation in that the dissociation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) from complex I and its movement into the cytosol is initiated either by RIPK1 deubiquitylation mediated by cylindromatosis (CYLD) or by RIPK1 non-ubiquitylation due to depletion of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs). Other components such as FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD) and pro-caspase 8 might also be present in the complex. RIPK1 recruits numerous RIPK3 molecules (denoted RIPK3<sub>n</sub> in the figure). Neither RIPK1 nor RIPK3 is cleaved owing to the prevailing state of caspase inhibition. Instead, RIPK1 and RIPK3 come together to form amyloid microfilaments called necrosomes in a reaction that is dependent on the kinase activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3. The participation of the phosphorylated form of the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is also crucial for the induction of necroptosis.

pathway. However, additional work on the role of linear polyubiquitylation in necroptosis is needed because SHARPIN deficiency suppresses, but does not entirely abrogate, M1-linked polyubiquitylation^{42,46,47}. When M1-linked linear polyubiquitylation is completely inhibited in mice by ablation of HOIP — the catalytic subunit of LUBAC — embryonic lethality is triggered at mid-gestation^{113}. Molecular analysis of these embryos has revealed the presence of an aberrant preassembled complex II that leads to a form of TNFR1-mediated cell death with both necrotic and apoptotic characteristics^{113}. This result emphasizes the importance of M1-linked linear polyubiquitylation as a regulator that balances apoptosis versus necroptosis.

MLKL: a crucial effector of necroptosis. It was recently discovered that treatment of human cells with the small molecule necrosulfonamide blocks necroptosis^{114}. Necrosulfonamide targets the human form of the pseudokinase MLKL^{114}. A similar block in TNF-induced necroptosis can be achieved by knocking down MLKL expression using RNA interference^{115}. The importance of MLKL in TNF signalling that leads to necroptosis has been confirmed by studies of a gene-deficient mouse model, which showed that ablation of *Mlkl* abrogates cellular necroptosis but not apoptosis^{116,117}. These data further support the idea that the apoptotic and necrotic cell death pathways are separated.

Within the necrosome, serine phosphorylation of RIPK3 is crucial for recruiting MLKL, but MLKL is dispensable for the stabilization of this complex^{115,118,119}. In addition, although the pseudokinase domain of MLKL binds to ATP, MLKL is catalytically inactive and serves instead as a phosphorylation target of RIPK3 that is important for downstream signalling^{115,116}. Intriguingly, MLKL is the only substrate of RIPK1 and RIPK3 that is relevant for the induction of necroptosis. This conclusion is based on the ability of a constitutively active mutant MLKL protein to stimulate the necrotic pathway either in the absence of RIPK3 or in the presence of the RIPK inhibitor necrostatin 1 (REF. 116). The intracellular location of MLKL may also be important. During the early phase of TNF-induced necroptosis, MLKL oligomers translocate to the plasma membrane where they seem to influence the location of the necrosome. Membrane localization of multimerized MLKL, which is achieved by binding to the membrane lipids phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin, is crucial for necroptosis^{120–122}. It is suggested that oligomerized MLKL forms pores that are essential for the influx of positively charged ions, such as Na⁺, K⁺ or Ca²⁺, which is known to be an early event in TNF-induced necroptosis^{120–122}. However, the molecular events downstream of MLKL activation are not completely defined, and substantial work is needed to unravel the signalling network that underlies this form of TNFR1-mediated cell death.

Box 1 | TNFR signalling in inflammatory disorders

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) was initially described as a factor that induces tumour cell death (by Carswell and Old in 1975), but it has since been shown to be heavily involved in diseases that are characterized by chronic inflammation. Prominent among these disorders is rheumatoid arthritis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the peripheral joints but can also damage the lungs, skin, kidneys and heart. In rheumatoid arthritis, leukocytes infiltrate the synovial membranes of the joints and secrete chemokines, prostaglandins and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF. In particular, TNF recruits osteoclast precursors from the bone marrow into synovial membranes, where these cells mediate the initial bone loss that is observed in patients. In addition, TNF-dependent signalling via receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK; also known as TNFRSF11A) and RANK ligand (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11) activates the downstream pathway mediated by TEC, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phospholipase C (PLC) that leads to the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), and subsequent osteoclast differentiation and activation. TNF also promotes NFATc1 expression by signalling through receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. Finally, TNF blocks the function of osteoblasts, which are the cells responsible for regenerating bone. It is this TNF-dependent dysregulation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts that is central to the imbalanced resorption of bone tissue in the joints that results in inflammation. Another inflammatory disorder involving TNF is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is a collection of maladies that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. IBD is caused by an abnormal immune response against certain bacterial species that are present among the normal intestinal flora. Serum TNF levels in patients with IBD positively correlate with the severity of clinical manifestations of ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, indicating that increased levels of TNF are probably a risk factor for these diseases. Macrophages, monocytes and T helper 1 (*T*~H~1) cells serve as direct sources of TNF in patients with IBD. Furthermore, *T*~H~17 cells producing interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17F can induce macrophages to synthesize various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1 and IL-6, which intensify the immune attack against the intestinal flora.

Targeting TNF in inflammatory diseases

TNF has long been associated with the clinical signs of various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), septic shock, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, respiratory diseases, vasculitis and type 1 diabetes (T1D)^{123,124} (BOX 1). Owing to the complexity of TNF signalling and the various roles of TNF in different diseases, current TNF-targeted therapies have resulted in remarkable successes, but also failures, in clinical applications.

Successes in targeting TNF. TNF is a key driver in promoting and sustaining inflammatory responses involving B cells and T cells of the adaptive immune system, as well as various cell types of the innate immune system. Blocking TNF signalling using biologics (for example, monoclonal antibodies) that directly bind to either TNF itself or TNFR is currently the most effective therapeutic approach for many inflammatory diseases. At this time, five inhibitors of TNF–TNFR signalling have been approved by various regulatory bodies around the world (namely, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab and certolizumab pegol)^{3}. As outlined below, these agents have had a profound positive impact on many patient outcomes over the last two decades. The pharmaceutical industry continues to introduce dozens of new therapeutics that modulate TNFRSF signalling, and many of these are undergoing testing in clinical trials^{125}.

TNF, tumour necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor.

As far back as 1985, Beutler and colleagues<sup>126</sup> showed that bacteria-induced sepsis in mice could be blocked by passive immunization with antibodies directed against TNF. Unfortunately, initial clinical trials using TNF-specific antibodies to treat patients with sepsis did not have the desired outcome<sup>127,128</sup>. More recent data have shown that TNF-specific antibodies can be beneficial for patients with sepsis but that success may depend on several factors, including exactly which therapeutic is used and how soon after infection the drug is administered<sup>129,130</sup>. With respect to rheumatoid arthritis, strong preclinical data from mouse models of arthritis supported the testing of TNF-specific antibodies in clinical trials and confirmed the effectiveness of blocking TNF-mediated signalling<sup>131</sup>. This approach efficiently slows or prevents the progression of bone and cartilage damage in many patients with rheumatoid arthritis<sup>132,133</sup>.

Currently, several biologics against TNF or TNFR have been approved for therapeutic use not only for various forms of arthritis but also for psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and IBD<sup>134–137</sup>. With respect to IBD, numerous studies have demonstrated that TNF-targeted therapies can restore T cell homeostasis, inhibit inflammation and support the healing of the intestinal mucosa. In particular, TNF-targeted therapy of patients with ulcerative colitis greatly inhibits the activation and proliferation of pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and their secretion of TNF and IL-17A<sup>138</sup>.

Failures in TNF targeting. Despite the above successes, TNF-targeted therapies sometimes have counterintuitive effects, and they have shown contradictory results in terms of efficacy (TABLE 1). For example, TNF inhibition has had a beneficial impact in children but not in older adults with T1D<sup>139,140</sup>, and on rare occasions, it has triggered new-onset T1D in patients who received TNF-targeted therapies for other inflammatory diseases<sup>141,142</sup>. As another example, although numerous studies have shown that TNF expression is enhanced in active lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis<sup>143,144</sup>, TNF inhibition in this group is detrimental<sup>145,146</sup>. This conundrum may be explained by the recent discovery that patients with multiple sclerosis express a novel truncated form of TNFRSF1A that is soluble and able to sequester TNF in the extracellular space, thereby antagonizing TNF signalling<sup>147</sup>. Treatment with TNF-specific antibodies that basically mimics the sequestration of TNF might explain why patients with multiple sclerosis deteriorate rather than improve. Similar to the role of TNF in multiple sclerosis, in the case of patients with SLE, it is hypothesized that TNF has an immunosuppressive rather than a pro-inflammatory role. Therefore, TNF inhibition would accelerate rather than slow SLE progression. Although TNF-targeted therapy has been efficacious in patients with SLE who also suffer from arthritis or nephritis, most clinical trials of TNF-targeted therapies in SLE have been discontinued owing to adverse events<sup>148</sup>.

These negative patient outcomes following TNF-targeted therapy imply that, at least for some inflammatory diseases (such as T1D, SLE and multiple sclerosis), treatment with soluble TNF might be beneficial. Indeed, there are initial data supporting this approach based on the ability of TNF to selectively induce the death of autoreactive T cells or to induce endotoxin tolerance in macrophages<sup>149,150</sup>. As TNF-mediated signalling is very important for many physiological functions in the body, it should not be surprising that the use of TNF-specific and TNFR-specific therapeutics sometimes cause adverse events, including the development of lymphomas and infections<sup>151,152</sup>. Other severe side effects (summarized in TABLE 2) that have been related to TNF inhibition include lupus-like syndrome, diabetes, the induction of autoantibodies, psoriasis, demyelinating diseases and congestive heart failure<sup>153–157</sup>.

New approaches in TNF targeting. The serious problems encountered using TNF-specific and TNFR1-specific antibodies to treat some patients with inflammatory conditions has spurred on the development of new strategies<sup>158,159</sup>. Although some efforts have turned to

*The five US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-specific biologics can cause various severe adverse events when used to treat patients with certain inflammatory diseases. However, the benefits of these treatments outweigh the rare occurrences of these side effects.

targeting interleukins<sup>160</sup>, many pharmaceutical companies are focusing on improving immunosuppressive therapies that target TNF. In addition, there remains interest in blocking TNF–TNFR signalling by using small-molecule inhibitors against kinases such as spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), Janus kinases and p38, which mediate signalling downstream of TNF; such inhibitors have shown benefits in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis<sup>161,162</sup>. Various types of JNK inhibitors are in early-phase clinical trials, as are inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme that is crucial for soluble TNF generation and release. Although PDE4 blockade was very effective in inflammatory diseases, first-generation PDE4 inhibitors failed in clinical trials owing to the high prevalence of nausea and emesis<sup>163</sup>. These adverse events could be explained by the importance of PDE4 function in modulating the central nervous system. The latest generation of PDE4 inhibitors, including roflumilast and apremilast, shows increased specificity towards individual PDE4 isoforms and is associated with fewer side effects. Roflumilast shows efficacy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and apremilast reduces inflammation in patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis<sup>164,165</sup>.

Another interesting concept is the development of small-molecule inhibitors that prevent TNF trimerization, which is an event that is crucial for TNF-induced signalling<sup>166</sup>. Finally, non-biologic interference with the binding of TNF to TNFR may be of benefit in some situations. In several mouse models of arthritis, treatment with the growth factor progranulin (PGRN) or with an engineered protein called atsttrin, which is composed

of three PGRN fragments, prevented TNF-mediated inflammation<sup>167</sup>. Alternatively, it may be possible to specifically activate the TNFR2 pathway in the autoreactive T cells that drive inflammatory diseases. In this case, TNF-mediated apoptosis might selectively kill these T cells but have no effect on other host cells<sup>10,125</sup>.

It should be noted that it is essential to test all new approaches for reducing TNF-associated inflammation in clinical trials to determine whether they can outperform treatments with currently approved TNF-targeted biologics. For instance, although small-molecule inhibitors of TACE showed promising preclinical results<sup>168</sup>, several clinical trials examining these agents were largely unsuccessful and had to be discontinued owing to severe liver toxicity<sup>169</sup>. Although treatment with TNF-specific antibodies occasionally results in serious adverse events, these biologics have been remarkably successful; therefore, developing improved biologics against TNF and TNFR may be the most promising strategy (for example, Atrosab (Baliopharm), which is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks TNFR1 but does not interfere with TNFR2 (REF. 170)). In any case, three decades of experience with the use of TNF-targeted biologics in the clinic has clearly shown that one therapeutic will not treat all inflammatory diseases. The challenge for the future lies in creating target-specific drugs that can be used in combination and can be tailored to a particular type of inflammatory disease. Ultimately, the goal is to devise treatments that carry a reduced risk of adverse events and provide more effective therapy for patients.
