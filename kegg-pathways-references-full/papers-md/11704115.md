**Objective:** To assess major physiological events underlying folliculogenesis, including FSH-dependent dominant follicle (DF) formation, LH/hCG signaling, and the role of novel regulatory molecules in these developmental processes.

**Design:** Review of some of the past and recent advances in ovarian biology, focusing attention on [1] two novel oocyte-derived growth factors, growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-15); and [2] a recently discovered follicular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4) protease, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), that can degrade the FSH antagonist IGFBP-4.

**Result(s):** Oocyte-derived GDF-9 and BMP-15 are obligatory for folliculogenesis and female fertility in laboratory animals through their ability to stimulate granulosa cell proliferation and modulate FSH-dependent cytodifferentiation. The expression of these growth factors in human primary oocytes supports the hypothesis that GDF-9 and BMP-15 could be involved in ovary function in women. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A is a marker for the human dominant follicle and its product the corpus luteum, raising the possibility that this putative FSH antagonist might regulate FSH bioactivity during folliculogenesis and luteogenesis.

**Conclusion(s):** Oocyte-derived and granulosa-derived regulatory proteins perform very important functions in FSH-dependent folliculogenesis. The current challenges are to understand the role of these novel proteins in ovary physiology and pathophysiology in women.

**Key Words:** FSH, LH, hCG, GDF-9, BMP-15, PAPP-A, folliculogenesis

Normally, the human ovaries are responsible for the regular production of a single dominant follicle (DF), which participates in a single ovulation each menstrual cycle. After the egg cumulus complex is secreted, the follicle wall transforms into an endocrine gland, the corpus luteum (CL). The CL secretes considerable quantities of progesterone (P⁴) and estradiol (E₂) which in turn act on uterine cells to promote pregnancy. In this capacity, the cells within the DF and its product, the CL, are the basis for female fertility. Given their paramount importance, understanding the mechanisms responsible for the control of DF and CL development is a major goal of reproductive research.

A fundamental principle of reproductive biology is that FSH is obligatory for DF formation. Thus, to understand the processes by which a DF and ultimately a CL are formed, one must understand the mechanisms underlying FSH action. Because FSH receptors are found only on granulosa cells (1, 2), the question of how FSH controls follicular development must be answered at the level of these cells. In a broad sense, the mechanistic basis of FSH action involves evoked changes in particular effector genes that coordinate cell proliferation, differentiation, and long-term survival of the granulosa cells (3, 4).

Although FSH is the primary regulator of DF development, it is now clear that growth factors (GFs) produced by the follicle itself can act by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms to modulate, either amplify or attenuate, FSH action. This body of evidence has led to the proposition that ovarian GFs might be important factors that control female fertility, for better or for worse. In this review, we will focus on the basis of DF formation in women and discuss the physiological role of oocyte GFs and the granulosa IGF system in this process. With respect to the latter, we will discuss a recently discovered insulin-like growth factor.

**Physiology of Dominant Follicle Formation**

In normal women, the DF originates from a primordial follicle that was recruited to grow almost 1 year earlier (Fig. 1). Thus, an important principle in human ovarian physiology is that folliculogenesis is a very long process (5). Folliculogenesis can be divided into two rather distinct stages: the gonadotropin-independent (preantral) and gonadotropin-dependent (antral or Graafian) periods (6). As seen in Figure 1, the gonadotropin-independent and gonadotropin-dependent steps in folliculogenesis occur over a period of about 300 and 50 days, respectively. Locally produced GFs are critically involved in controlling preantral follicle development during the gonadotropin-independent period. After antrum formation, the follicle becomes dependent on FSH stimulation for continued growth and development; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that long-term homeostasis of developing Graafian follicles also depends on positive influences evoked by GF-dependent signaling (6). Given the duration of human folliculogenesis, one can imagine many different potential mechanisms by which GFs could influence folliculogenesis, including selection and atresia.

**The Role of FSH**

The concept that FSH is obligatory for DF selection and development was arrived at almost 60 years ago. In a very real sense, it represents the cornerstone of our understanding of ovary physiology. The increase in plasma FSH that occurs during the late luteal and early follicular phases of the menstrual cycle is the basis for DF selection in women. The stringent requirement for this FSH rise in the selection process is demonstrated by the fact that in its absence, there is no DF and no ovulation (7, 8). The physiological consequence of this FSH rise is that a critical threshold concentration of FSH is achieved within the microenvironment of the chosen follicle. There is a consensus that the threshold level of FSH results in the expression of E₂, which in turn suppresses plasma FSH levels; this in turn causes the concentration of FSH in developing cohort follicles to fall below threshold levels. It is widely accepted that this FSH withdrawal phenomenon in cohort follicles is involved in the massive apoptosis of the granulosa cells that occurs during atresia. There is evidence that mitosis in cohort follicles can be markedly stimulated by treatment with hMG during the early follicular phase (9). One implication of this observation is that hMG-treatment might increase the number of presumptive DFs in women by rescuing cohort follicles from atresia.

Evidence from histomorphometric studies suggests that changes in granulosa mitosis might constitute one mechanism by which selection occurs (10). Shortly after the midluteal phase, the granulosa cells in all cohort follicles appear to show an increase (approximately twofold) in the rate of mitosis. One of the first indications that a DF has been selected is that the granulosa cells in the chosen follicle continue proliferating at a fast rate while the rate of proliferation slows in the non-DFs. Because this distinguishing event appears in the late luteal phase, it is likely that the DF is selected at this time of the cycle. Given the importance of FSH in the selection process, it is not unreasonable to assume that the basic mechanism underlying these changes in granulosa proliferation are functionally related to the relatively high threshold level of FSH in the microenvironment of the chosen follicle.

A fundamental question concerns the number of potential selectable follicles in any given cohort. The simple truth is that we do not know the answer to this basic question. There is evidence in women that death of the DF or CL leads to the immediate selection of a new DF (11, 12). This observation supports the conclusion that human ovaries always contain a pool of small Graafian (class 4 and 5) follicles (see Fig. 1) from which another DF can be selected. Although the precise number is unknown, Gougeon (13, 14) suggests that the ovaries of normal young women may contain a cohort of approximately four to six healthy class 4 to 5 follicles. In this regard, it is likely that the size of the pool is variable, being correlated with age and ovary reserve.

Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanism of FSH action in the DF. The fact that the granulosa cells are the only cell types known to express FSH receptors targets them as physiologically important in mediating FSH action in the ovary. The accumulated data from a large number of studies demonstrate that FSH receptor signaling plays a fundamental role in the growth and differentiation of the DF through its ability to promote follicular fluid formation, cell proliferation, E₂ production, and LH receptor expression (3, 6, 15). The temporal pattern and level of expression of these FSH-dependent genes are crucial for the expression of the normal physiological functions ascribed to the DF. It should be mentioned that the FSH stimulation of LH receptors in the granulosa cells is required for LH/hCG to induce ovulation and luteinization (16). A key feature of the temporal pattern of LH receptor expression is that it is suppressed throughout most of folliculogenesis. A high level of LH receptor expression is not induced in the granulosa cells until the DF reaches the preovulatory stage (17). This fact supports the possibility that when LH enters the follicular fluid during the late follicular phase it may be an important effector of granulosa function, perhaps even replacing FSH as the principle regulator of cytodifferentiation.

The Role of LH

Although FSH is the central regulator of DF survival and development, LH/hCG signaling pathways play fundamental physiological roles. Physiologically, LH-dependent signaling pathways in the theca interstitial cells elicit changes in gene expression that are critical for E₂ production (18). Specifically, activation of the LH receptors in theca cells leads directly to the stimulation of high levels of androstenedione production. The major physiological significance of this LH response is to provide aromatase substrate to the granulosa cells where it is metabolized by P450 aromatase to E₂; this is the two gonadotropin-two cell concept of DF estrogen biosynthesis (Fig. 2). Because E₂ production is unique to DFs, the level of plasma E₂ is a useful marker for monitoring the physiological responses of endogenous or exogenous gonadotropins in women.

There are three additional physiologically important func-

tions of LH/hCG in the DF and CL. First, the ovulatory dose of LH/hCG is responsible for ovulation and CL formation. Second, LH is essential for P4 and E2 production by the CL during the early and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle. And third, hCG is obligatory for transforming the CL of the cycle into the CL of pregnancy.

**The Role of the Oocyte**

One of the most exciting discoveries in the past few years is that the process of folliculogenesis is controlled by GFs secreted by the oocyte (19, 20). To date, five GFs have been identified in mammalian oocytes: growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) (21), bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15/GDF-9B) (22, 23), bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) (24), transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) (25), and fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF-8) (26). Much of our understanding of oocyte GFs comes from experiments on the effects of GDF-9 and BMP-15 in mice and sheep. The concept emerging from this seminal work is that oocyte-derived GDF-9 and BMP-15 are obligatory for normal folliculogenesis and female fertility. The clinical significance of this new concept (Fig. 3) is emphasized by the presence of GDF-9 and BMP-15 expression in oocytes of developing human follicles (27). It should be emphasized that in the ovaries of all mammals examined to date, the oocyte is the only cell type that expresses these genes (19).

The definitive evidence that GDF-9 and BMP-15 play critical roles in follicle development and female fertility comes from loss-of-function studies in laboratory animals. Experiments with knockout mice have demonstrated that in the absence of GDF-9, folliculogenesis is blocked at the primary preantral stage (28). Consequently, there are no Graafian follicles, no ovulations, and no pregnancies. A similar phenotype has been reported in homozygous sheep carrying a naturally occurring X-linked loss-of-function mu-

tation in BMP-15 (29). Regarding BMP-15, it is particularly significant that the heterozygotes exhibit increased ovulation rates (29). Collectively, these findings support the fascinating new concept that oocyte GDF-9 and BMP-15 are absolutely essential for folliculogenesis and fertility; and it is interesting that naturally occurring BMP-15 mutations can cause both infertility and superovulations (DF formation) in a dosage-sensitive manner. In a very real sense, this evidence supports the idea that the oocyte is the cornerstone underlying the physiological mechanisms that control DF formation and ovulation quota in mammals.

A fundamental question in understanding the functions of GDF-9 and BMP-15 in the follicle concern the identification of the target cells for these GFs. Several lines of evidence indicate that granulosa cells are target cells. In vivo studies of GDF-9 deficient mice have provided compelling evidence for a critical physiological role of GDF-9 in stimulating granulosa cell proliferation during the gonadotropin-independent period, specifically at the stages leading to the secondary stage (30). The fact that GDF-9 acts directly on granulosa cells from preantral as well as DFs to stimulate DNA synthesis provides unequivocal support for this important principle (31). The observation that GDF-9 also acts to stimulate preantral follicle growth in vitro is consistent with this conclusion (32). Interestingly, BMP-15 has also been found to be a potent stimulator of granulosa mitosis in vitro (33). An important aspect of the mitogenic effects of both GDF-9 and BMP-15 is that they are FSH independent. Collectively, these findings indicate a stimulatory role for GDF-9 and BMP-15 in mitogenic signaling in granulosa cells throughout the course of folliculogenesis. Thus GDF-9 and BMP-15 appear to be classic granulosa mitogens, at least in the murine.

GDF-9 and BMP-15 have also been shown to evoke
profound changes in FSH-stimulated granulosa cytodifferentiation. Although GDF-9 and BMP-15 alone have minimal effects on the differentiated state of cultured preantral granulosa cells, both factors markedly affect FSH action in these cells (31–33). With respect to GDF-9, Vitt et al. (31) demonstrated that GDF-9 inhibits FSH-induced LH-receptor, E₂, and P⁴ biosynthesis in these cells. Therefore, GDF-9 signaling pathways in undifferentiated granulosa cells appear to be involved in blocking FSH action. Regarding BMP-15, it has recently been shown that this GF (like GDF-9) decreases FSH-induced P⁴ production by undifferentiated granulosa cells; however, it is interesting that BMP-15 had no effect on FSH-induced E₂ production (33). These results with BMP-15 could have physiological relevance in terms of the selective ability of FSH to promote E₂, but not P⁴, production during the follicular phase of the cycle. Importantly, we have found recently that BMP-15 is a potent inhibitor of FSH-receptor expression (34). As such, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that oocyte-derived BMP-15 and GDF-9 may be critical determinants of FSH action during folliculogenesis.

There is also compelling evidence that GDF-9 is directly involved in the regulation of the differentiated state of granulosa cells in DFs. In contrast to undifferentiated granulosa cells, GDF-9 itself can elicit changes in the differentiated state of FSH/LH primed granulosa cells in preovulatory follicles; GDF-9 stimulates the expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2), and steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR) (35). The physiological relevance of the GDF-9-stimulated HAS2 and StAR appears to be associated with cumulus expansion (35) and P⁴ production, respectively. There is also evidence that GDF-9 is involved in the regulation of FSH action in DFs. Also, GDF-9 has been found to significantly decrease FSH-stimulated LH-receptor and P⁴ production by cultured granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles (31). The physiological relevance of this GDF-9 effect on FSH action appears to be linked to the known inhibitory effect of the oocyte on FSH-induced LH-receptor and P⁴ expression in the cumulus granulosa cells of DFs (19, 36). At present, nothing is known about the role of BMP-15 in regulating the functions of differentiated granulosa cells. The hypothesis that emerges from all this work is that the oocyte plays a major role in determining the way in which FSH acts in the follicle to regulate granulosa cytodifferentiation.

It was noted in the GDF-9 knockout animals that theca cell formation was impaired (28). This supported the possibility that GDF-9 may also be an effector of theca-interstitial cell development. Indeed, a recent study with cultured rat theca-interstitial cells indicates that GDF-9 amplifies basal and LH-stimulated androgen biosynthesis (37). This finding supports the intriguing hypothesis that theca-interstitial cells are targets for GDF-9, and that oocyte-derived GDF-9 might be an important determinant of androgen production by

ovarian follicles. Finally, there are data, albeit limited, suggesting GDF-9 may play a role in oocyte development, particularly in regulating oocyte size and cortical granule formation (38). The role of BMP-15 in the development of the theca and oocyte is unknown.

It will be of great interest to find out how specific GDF-9 and BMP-15 signaling pathways lead to activation and suppression of particular effector genes in human preantral and DF follicles and ultimately to fertility and infertility in women.

# The IGF System: The Role of PAPP-A

The GFs produced by the granulosa cells are also involved in many aspects of follicle growth and development. One of the best studied is the IGF system (39, 40). A functional link between the IGF system and FSH action has been demonstrated by the finding that IGFBP-4 is a potent inhibitor of FSH-induced estradiol production by murine (39, 41) and human (42) granulosa cells. Although the mechanism underlying the IGFBP-4 inhibition of FSH action remains to be elucidated, it appears to involve neutralization of intrinsic IGF bioactivity, such as IGF-1 and II in the murine and human, respectively (41, 43, 44). The physiological significance of this work is demonstrated by the finding that the gene encoding IGFBP-4 is expressed in atretic follicles *in vivo* (45–47). Together, these findings have implicated IGFBP-4 (through its FSH antagonist activities) in regulatory pathways that lead to follicle atresia.

Recently, much attention has been focused on several proteases that degrade IGFBP-4 into fragments that are devoid of FSH-inhibitory activity (48). An important role for FSH in stimulating the production a specific IGFBP-4 protease by rat granulosa cells has been reported (49). Because IGFBP-4ase could indirectly enhance FSH-mediated cell signaling, there has been great interest in identifying the nature of this key molecule. Recently, Lawrence et al. (50) identified pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) as an IGFBP-4ase. This protein is a member of the metzincin family of metalloproteases and appears to exist as a dimer with a molecular mass of ≈400 kd. The existence of PAPP-A (51) in human follicular fluid fits the hypothesis that PAPP-A may be responsible for the IGFBP-4 protease activity known to be present in follicular fluid (52). If true, then it is possible that PAPP-A is a critical determinant of FSH-dependent folliculogenesis in women.

Recent evidence indicates that the gene encoding PAPP-A is expressed in human ovaries, being restricted to granulosa cells in healthy Graafian follicles (DF) and granulosa lutein cells of healthy CL (53). The restricted pattern of PAPP-A expression in normal human ovaries suggests that PAPP-A may be a functional marker of the DF and its product, the CL. Although the physiological function of ovarian PAPP-A remains to be identified, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the regulated expression of

FERTILITY & STERILITY®   947PAPP-A might play a role in controlling survival, growth, and/or differentiation of the DF and CL by inactivating the gonadotropin antagonist IGFBP-4.

# CONCLUSION

There is no doubt that FSH, LH, and hCG play critical roles in directing the development, differentiation, and function of DF and CL in women. The FSH signaling pathways play an obligatory role in DF selection and survival; LH/hCG receptor signaling pathways in the theca-interstitial and granulosa cells play a fundamental role in the production of aromatase substrate and ovulation, respectively; and hCG transforms the CL of the cycle into the CL of pregnancy. It is becoming evident that the oocyte and granulosa cells produce a variety of GFs that act broadly to influence gonadotropin action in positive and negative ways. Obviously, alterations in the expression and actions of oocyte and granulosa GFs have far-reaching consequences for female fertility. The current challenges are to understand how oocyte-derived GDF-9 and BMP-15 and granulosa/CL-derived PAPP-A exert control of ovary functions and how these actions are integrated into the overall pattern of physiology and pathophysiology during the life of a woman.
