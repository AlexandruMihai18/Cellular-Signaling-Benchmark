**Protein translocation into and across the bacterial plasma membrane and the plant thylakoid membrane**

**Ross E. Dalbey and Colin Robinson**

Over the past decade, some familiar themes have emerged on how proteins are inserted into or translocated across the plant chloroplast thylakoid membrane and bacterial inner membranes. In the SecA and signal recognition particle (SRP) pathways, nucleotides and soluble factors are used to translocate proteins across the membrane bilayer in the unfolded state. However, the ΔpH-dependent pathway in thylak

membrane proteins to the thylakoid membrane. This is consistent with the observation that the SRP-dependent pathway seems to be critical only for membrane proteins.

**A novel type of protein translocase in thylakoids and eubacteria**

In some respects, the field of thylakoid protein targeting has followed in the footsteps of bacterial studies in that similar pathways have emerged. A prime example is the Sec pathway used for a subset of thylakoid lumen proteins. However, in one critical respect, ideas have flowed in the other direction, following

The Tat operon in *Escherichia coli*. The operon comprises four genes. The *tatA* gene is homologous to the maize *hcf106* gene, and a second Hcf106 homolog is encoded by the unlinked *tatE* gene. Note that TatA, TatB, TatC and TatE have been shown to be involved in Sec-independent protein export but that the role of the TatD protein has yet to be established.

Current data are also consistent with a spontaneous mechanism for integration of several thylakoid proteins. Three single-span thylakoid membrane proteins – CF<sub>II</sub>, and the W and X subunits of photosystem II (PsbX and PsbW) – all have cleavable signal-type peptides yet are inserted *in vitro* into thylakoids in the absence of stromal factors, nucleoside triphosphates or the thylakoid ΔpH<sup>46–48</sup>.
