### OPINION

#### The future of antigen-specific immunotherapy of allergy

##### Rudolf Valenta

More than 25% of the population in industrialized countries suffers from (immunoglobulin-E-dependent) allergy were understood, Leonard Noon immunized patients suffering from pollen-induced hayfever with subcutaneous injections of pollen extracts¹. Although this was based on the erroneous belief that seasonal hayfever might be caused by a grass-pollen toxin, successful outcomes were recorded and induced protection was found to last for at least one year after the treatment was discontinued.

Since then, many of the underlying immunological and molecular mechanisms, as well as environmental factors, that influence the development of allergy have been analysed². Type I allergy is a classical IgE-mediated disease, which, as shown by a landmark experiment by Prausnitz and Küstner in 1921, requires at least three components: a disease-eliciting antigen (allergen); a transferable serum factor that discriminates allergic patients from healthy individuals (IgE);

The antigen-specific immunotherapy that is in use at present involves the administration of allergen extracts to patients with the aim to cure allergic symptoms. However, the risk of therapy-induced side effects limits its broad application. Recent work indicates that the epitope complexity of natural allergen extracts can be recreated using recombinant allergens, and hypoallergenic derivatives of these can be engineered to increase treatment safety. It is proposed that these modified molecules will improve the current practice of specific immunotherapy and form a basis for prophylactic vaccination.

Ninety years ago, long before the immunopathological mechanisms that underlie type I

and a tissue component that is present in all individuals (mast cells)³.

The antigens that elicit IgE responses are mostly proteins or glycoproteins that have molecular masses of 5–80 kDa, which elute easily from respirable particles and are highly immunogenic⁴. However, molecular and structural analyses of allergens from various sources indicate that there are no apparent common structural motifs or biological properties that predict their allergenic nature. It is now becoming clear that the increased susceptibility

of allergic individuals to mount IgE responses compared with non-allergic individuals — termed atopy — is also controlled by several genetic factors⁵⁻⁷.

### Sensitization

In allergic individuals, specific IgE antibodies can be detected in the first few years after birth, and seem to be induced by early, postnatal allergen contact at mucosal surfaces⁸⁻¹⁰. This primary response to allergen is known as sensitization (FIG. 1a). In the case of respiratory

---

**Figure 1 | How allergens induce and maintain allergy.**

**a | Sensitization and memory.** Initial contact with minute amounts of intact, soluble allergen at mucosal surfaces, particularly of the respiratory tract, might favour allergen uptake by potent antigen-presenting cells (for example, dendritic cells) and/or immunoglobulin-mediated capture by specific B cells. If T helper 2 (T~H~2)-cell help is acquired, cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 will be produced that favour immunoglobulin-class switching of specific B cells to immunoglobulin E (that is, sensitization). Sensitization leads to the establishment of IgE⁺ memory B cells and allergen-specific memory T cells. Subsequent repeated allergen contact will boost IgE⁺ memory B cells that receive T-cell help to produce increased levels of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These are loaded by means of specific receptors (FcεRI, high-affinity IgE receptor; FcεRII, low-affinity IgE receptor) onto mast cells, basophils, monocytes, dendritic cells and B cells.

**b | Immediate reaction.** The crosslinking of effector-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy.

**c | Late reaction.** This is caused by the presentation of allergens to T cells, which become activated, proliferate and release proinflammatory cytokines (for example, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13). This process might be enhanced by the IgE-mediated presentation of allergens to T cells. T~H~2 cytokines (for example, IL-5) induce tissue eosinophilia and the release of inflammatory mediators from eosinophils. APC, antigen-presenting cell; DC, dendritic cell; TCR, T-cell receptor.

DCs) take up allergens and prime allergen-specific T cells, which can then help to activate allergen-specific B cells by means of cognate T-cell–B-cell interactions. This possibility is supported by a body of literature that shows that DCs can stimulate potent T<sub>H</sub>2 responses, and by a report that shows that lung DCs, but not B cells, stimulate strong ovalbumin-specific T-cell responses in mice<sup>12,13</sup>.

T<sub>H</sub>2 cells produce cytokines — such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 — that promote the immunoglobulin-class switching of B cells to IgE (FIG. 1a). The administration of IL-4 antagonists during primary sensitization prevents the development of IgE responses in mice, which shows the importance of IL-4 in controlling the class switch towards IgE production<sup>14</sup>. Continuing clinical trials are investigating the use of IL-4 and IL-13 antagonists for the treatment of allergic patients<sup>15</sup>.

In addition to IL-4 and IL-13, various other factors influence the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the T<sub>H</sub>2 phenotype, including the genetic background of the individual, the site of allergen contact, allergen dose and conformation, the nature and number of antigen-presenting cells, and the extent of T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation, as well as biological mediators (for example, histamine)<sup>16–20</sup>. As a result of sensitization, allergic patients produce IgE antibodies that are specific for allergens (FIG. 1a); by contrast, low levels of allergen-specific IgG antibodies are found in both allergic and non-allergic individuals<sup>10</sup>.

After sensitization, allergen-specific T cells form a pool of long-lived memory T cells that respond to repeated allergen contact<sup>21</sup>; these cells can be detected in the skin and peripheral blood of sensitized individuals by sequence analysis of their TCR hypervariable regions<sup>22,23</sup> (FIG. 1a). The sensitization process (that is, the primary response) also leads to the establishment of an allergen-specific IgE antibody memory<sup>10</sup>. Interestingly, allergen-specific IgE<sup>+</sup> antibody-producing cells are found in the mucosa of the respiratory tract (nasal and bronchial mucosa), where they are in contact with inhaled allergens<sup>24–26</sup>, but they are also present in the peripheral blood of allergic patients<sup>27–29</sup>. Levels of allergen-specific IgE and the sensitivity of patients to allergens are strongly enhanced 2–3 weeks after seasonal allergen contact<sup>30</sup> or nasal provocation with allergens<sup>31</sup> (V. Niederberger and R.V., unpublished observations). This finding, together with the fact that allergen contact is a potent stimulus for allergen-specific IgE production, indicates that allergen-specific IgE in allergic patients is produced mainly by IgE<sup>+</sup> memory B cells, which are strongly activated by contact with the allergen itself to produce increased levels of antibody (FIG. 1a). The available evidence indicates that these allergen-specific IgE<sup>+</sup> memory B cells must receive help from allergen-specific T cells to be activated. As has been shown for other disease models, it is also possible that certain subsets of regulatory T cells might be able to regulate allergen-specific antibody production and T-cell responses<sup>32–34</sup>.

induces the release of inflammatory mediators (for example, histamine and leukotrienes) which, in turn, cause, within minutes, the immediate symptoms of disease, such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis and **asthma** (FIG. 1b). Studies to analyse the mechanisms of action of anti-IgE-based therapies have now confirmed that for basophils, and perhaps also for mast cells, IgE antibodies are potent upregulators of the expression of FcεRI and the lower-affinity **FcεRII** (CD23) on the cell surface<sup>36–39</sup>. Moreover, there is evidence that the binding of monomeric IgE might increase the survival of mast cells by preventing their apoptosis<sup>40,41</sup>. Similar observations have been made for monocytes, which seem to escape apoptosis after IgE-mediated FcεRI ligation<sup>42</sup>. The expression of FcεRI has also been shown on various other cell types (such as eosinophils, thrombocytes and epithelial cells), but whether this contributes to the pathology of allergy is either a controversial issue or has not been investigated yet<sup>43–48</sup>. Recently, evidence was provided that regulatory T cells might influence mast-cell activity directly<sup>49</sup>. Conversely, it has been found that histamine, a mediator that is released by mast cells and basophils, can regulate T-cell responses by means of interactions with specific receptors<sup>50</sup>.

### The late-phase reaction

In allergic individuals that suffer from chronic manifestations of atopy (for example, chronic asthma and **atopic dermatitis**), late-phase reactions — which are caused by the activation of allergen-specific T cells after hours to days — are pronounced (FIG. 1c). These are characterized by a strong T-cell infiltration and eosinophil activation. A role for IgE antibodies in late-phase reactions has been suggested on the basis of several *in vitro* studies that show that antigen-presenting cells (for example, B cells, monocytes and DCs) can bind IgE antibodies by means of specific receptors (FcεRI and FcεRII), and that the presentation of allergens that are taken up by means of receptor-bound IgE antibodies is more potent at activating allergen-specific T-cell responses than antigen presentation that results from nonspecific antigen uptake<sup>51–54</sup>. This indicates that allergen-specific IgE antibodies might have an unexpected role in the activation of allergen-specific T cells, by means of facilitating antigen presentation (FIG. 1c). However, a recent study has shown that the activation of allergen-specific T cells can be achieved directly by T-cell-epitope-containing peptides that lack epitopes for binding to IgE<sup>55</sup>. This observation clearly shows that allergens can activate T cells in an IgE-independent manner and that these

### The immediate-phase reaction

It is becoming increasingly evident that IgE antibodies can have diverse pathological effects. It is well established that IgE binds tightly, by means of the high-affinity receptor FcεRI, to mast cells and basophils<sup>35</sup>. Cross-linking of receptors by allergen-bound IgE

allergen-specific T cells are important for the induction of late-phase symptoms (FIG. 1c). A possible role for DCs in the regulation of late-phase reactions is indicated by the finding that, depending on the cytokine milieu, DCs can either induce tolerance to respiratory antigens or strongly activate T<sub>H</sub>2 responses and eosinophils<sup>34,56,57</sup>. Eosinophil activity depends mainly on IL-5, and it is known that these cells can produce various inflammatory mediators and immunoregulatory cytokines that are implicated in the late asthmatic response<sup>58–60</sup>. Two recent clinical studies using recombinant human IL-12, which is known to suppress eosinophilic inflammation, and neutralizing IL-5 antibodies for the treatment of patients with allergic asthma have shown a strong reduction of tissue eosinophilia, but no effects on airway hyperresponsiveness and late asthmatic responses<sup>61,62</sup>.

### Immunotherapy of allergy

The differentiation, phenotype and activity of allergen-specific T cells are controlled by various allergen-specific factors, including antigen dose, antigen conformation and the site of antigen exposure<sup>11,16,63</sup>. It is, therefore, possible to modulate allergen-specific T cells using specific antigen. This, together with the finding that the profile of allergens and epitopes that are recognized by IgE does not change substantially during the natural course of allergic disease<sup>64</sup>, is an excellent basis for the antigen-targeted immunotherapy of allergy.

The clinically most effective and frequently used form of immunotherapy of allergy is injection immunotherapy<sup>65</sup>. It involves repeated subcutaneous injections of increasing doses of adjuvant-bound allergen extracts. Numerous clinical studies have documented the efficacy of immunotherapy, but the underlying immunological mechanisms remain a matter of controversy<sup>65,66</sup>. The potential mechanisms that have been identified are summarized in TABLE 1. In 1935, more than 30 years before the discovery of IgE antibodies, Robert A. Cooke provided the first insight into the mechanisms of injection immunotherapy by showing that the transfusion of blood from a patient who had been successfully treated with immunotherapy to an allergic recipient cured hayfever in the latter<sup>67</sup>. A few years later, the transferable factor was identified as IgG antibodies, which, owing to their ability to inhibit immediate skin reactions to allergen provocation, were designated blocking antibodies<sup>68</sup>. However, the importance of blocking antibodies has been questioned on the basis of the finding that the induction of IgG antibodies is not always associated with clinically successful immunotherapy<sup>69</sup>. Nevertheless, some

Recombinant allergen molecules

![Diagram](diagram_image)

Figure 2 | Assembling complete panels of hypoallergenic allergen derivatives for prophylactic vaccination against allergy. Recombinant allergens that contain most of the relevant epitopes that are present in various allergen sources have been produced by molecular cloning. The recombinant allergen molecules can be used to establish multi-allergen test systems (for example, allergen microarrays) that facilitate the determination of the reactivity profile of an allergic patient. On the basis of this information, it is possible to discriminate between those allergic patients who are sensitized against a few allergen components (oligosensitized patients) and those who react against many allergen components (polysensitized patients). Antigen-targeted immunotherapy of established allergy in oligosensitized patients can be carried out according to their reactivity profiles, whereas polysensitized patients might benefit more from symptomatic treatment. At present, hypoallergenic allergen derivatives are being developed for most of the important allergens, which can then be used for patient-tailored immunotherapy of oligosensitized patients with a reduced risk of inducing anaphylactic side effects. If hypoallergenic derivatives can be developed that comprise most of the relevant allergen sources, it will be possible to assemble prophylactic allergy vaccines.

recent studies carried out in defined molecular and cellular systems have rekindled interest in the concept of blocking antibodies<sup>64,70–72</sup>. First, it has been shown that immunotherapy-induced IgG antibodies (mainly IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub>)<sup>71</sup> compete with IgE for their binding sites on the allergens; this prevents the allergen-induced activation of basophils and, so, the release of biological mediators<sup>64,71</sup>. Second, it has been shown that blocking antibodies strongly inhibit the IgE-mediated presentation of allergens to T cells, which might reduce T<sub>H</sub>2 activation and the subsequent release of T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokines<sup>72</sup>.

Several findings indicate an important role for T cells in successful immunotherapy. They include reports of the generation of suppressor T cells during immunotherapy<sup>73</sup>, the observation that immunotherapy decreases the production of IL-4 by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup>74,75</sup>

study that reinvestigated T-cell-epitope-
containing peptides has shown a suppression
of T-cell-mediated late-phase responses
that was preceded by T-cell activation<sup>84</sup>, and another study reported the induction of
T-cell anergy in allergic patients that were
treated with T-cell-epitope-containing
peptides of **bee-venom phospholipase**<sup>85</sup>.

It has not been determined yet whether
immunotherapy-induced blocking antibodies
or T-cell-based downregulation can prevent
the continuous boosting of IgE production,
which otherwise might occur in allergic
patients through repeated allergen contact. It
is probable that several different mechanisms
are responsible for the observed long-term
effects (that is, prolonged clinical remission of
symptoms) of injection immunotherapy and
for the clinical observation that this form of
allergen-specific immunotherapy can prevent
the progression of allergic disease from less-
severe (such as hayfever) to more-severe
symptoms (such as asthma)<sup>65,66,86</sup>.

### Disadvantages of immunotherapy

One of the main problems of immunotherapy
is that the administration of allergens
might cause local and systemic side effects in
patients<sup>4</sup>, such as urticaria, asthma attacks
and life-threatening anaphylactic shock.
Therefore, several attempts have been made
to reduce therapy-induced anaphylactic side
effects. They include the adsorption of allergen
extracts to adjuvants to delay the systemic
release of allergenic material from the site of
administration and to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine<sup>65,87</sup>, and the chemical
modification of allergen extracts to reduce
their allergenic activity<sup>65,88,89</sup>.

Another problem concerning current forms of
immunotherapy relates to the use of
allergen extracts for diagnosis and therapy.
Allergen extracts are obtained from natural
allergen sources. They contain various allergenic, as well as non-allergenic, components
and might even be contaminated with allergens from other sources<sup>90</sup>. Furthermore, the
allergenic components of an allergen extract
might have different levels of immunogenicity, and the amount of allergen in the diagnostic and therapeutic extract preparation
can vary markedly<sup>65</sup>. Diagnoses using allergen extracts can identify allergen sources, but they cannot identify the disease-eliciting
allergen molecules<sup>91</sup>. So, it is impossible to
determine using allergen extracts whether
a patient is co-sensitized towards several
allergen sources or is cross-sensitized to an
allergen that is present in different allergen
sources (for example, profilin)<sup>92</sup>. Another
potentially important problem related to the

unpredictable complexity of allergen extracts
is that therapy-induced new IgE reactivities
towards extract components that were not
recognized before therapy can arise after
treatment<sup>71,93</sup>.

### Cloning complete allergen repertoires

During the past decade, several research
groups have succeeded in isolating and
cloning complementary DNAs that encode
most of the clinically relevant allergen molecules. These clones have been used to produce
panels of recombinant allergens that reproduce the epitope complexity that is present in
natural allergen extracts<sup>94</sup> (FIG. 2). Whether
recombinant allergens contain most of the
relevant IgE epitopes that are present in natural allergen sources can be easily tested by
immunological competition experiments. For
example, one can test whether a given panel
of recombinant allergens is sufficient to
deplete most of the IgE antibodies that are
specific for natural allergens from the sera of
allergic patients<sup>95–97</sup>.

The availability of recombinant allergens
also opens new opportunities for refined
allergy diagnosis. Whereas previously, only
allergen-containing sources could be defined, it
is now possible to identify the disease-eliciting
allergen molecules and, so, determine and
monitor the reactivity profile of a patient by
component-resolved diagnosis (CRD)<sup>91</sup> with
recombinant allergen molecules (FIG. 2). Using
allergen molecules that are present in the
most common allergen sources, miniaturized
allergy tests have been developed that are
based on microarray technology<sup>94</sup>. It is conceivable that such test systems will allow, in
the near future, the determination of reactivity profiles for allergic patients to large numbers of disease-causing allergens and epitopes, by means of a single assay that requires only
minute amounts of serum.

According to the test results that are
obtained by CRD, it will be possible to select
patients more effectively for specific immunotherapy. For example, it will enable oligosensitized patients (who would benefit from
immunotherapy treatment) to be distinguished from those patients who react against

many allergen components and, hence, might
be better treated by pharmacological therapy.
Extract-based immunotherapy can be monitored by recombinant-allergen-based assays
to detect new sensitizations, which might
allow treatment to be stopped before the new
sensitizations become clinically relevant<sup>71,93</sup>.

### ‘Detoxifying’ allergens

The application of recombinant-DNA technology to allergen characterization has revealed the molecular nature of many
important allergens and has advanced the
characterization of their immunological and
structural features<sup>4</sup>. On the basis of this work,
it has become possible to modify important
allergens in ways that simultaneously reduce
allergenic activity and preserve relevant T-cell
epitopes and structures that are necessary for
the induction of antibody responses<sup>98</sup>. Such
hypoallergenic allergen derivatives have been
generated mainly by recombinant-DNA technology by modifying the allergen-encoding cDNA or by synthetic peptide chemistry<sup>99–109</sup>. Hypoallergenic allergen derivatives have two
main advantages. First, it is possible to reduce
their allergenic activity in a defined and
reproducible manner. Second, they can be
engineered to target T cells and B cells simultaneously. The IgE-binding capacity and ability of these molecules to induce IgE-mediated immediate reactions has often been reduced
by the destruction of conformational IgE epitopes — by the production of recombinant
allergen fragments<sup>103,107,108</sup> or by introducing
mutations into the molecules by site-directed mutagenesis<sup>100,102,104,105</sup>. A strong reduction in
allergenic activity and the simultaneous
preservation of T-cell and B-cell epitopes has
also been obtained by recombinant oligomerization<sup>106</sup>. Unexpectedly, it was observed that
some of the recombinant hypoallergenic
derivatives had markedly altered immunogenic properties that might be advantageous
for immunotherapy (for example, increased
immunogenicity and increased induction of
T<sub>H</sub>1 cytokines)<sup>106,108,109</sup>. Molecular ‘architects’
can now engineer and evaluate a wide variety
of hypoallergenic allergen derivatives. They
can compare the modified allergens with wild-type allergens in terms of their IgE-
binding capacity, their ability to induce lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses, and
their potential to induce the release of biological mediators from effector cells<sup>106,107</sup>. Derivatives that have reduced allergenic activity *in vitro* are evaluated further for their ability to prevent or treat allergy in experimental animal models<sup>106–108,110</sup>. Recombinant hypoallergenic derivatives of the main birch-pollen allergen **Bet v 1** have already been evaluated in

the disease from moderate to severe symptoms of atopy (for example, asthma) (FIG. 3a). However, if prophylactic treatment can be given early in life, it might be possible to prevent the development of allergy^{115}. This might be achieved by prophylactic vaccination to induce ‘normal’, non-IgE-mediated, allergen-specific immune responses that are associated with the production of IgG antibody using protocols similar to those that are used for vaccination against infectious diseases (FIG. 3b). Alternatively, it might be possible to use recombinant hypoallergenic allergen derivatives for the induction of T-cell tolerance to prevent the development of allergen-specific immune responses^{110,115} (FIG. 3c).

Both prophylactic vaccination and tolerance induction against most allergen sources will require that a reasonably complete repertoire of relevant allergens can be assembled — a goal that, in view of the rapid progress in the field of molecular allergen characterization and recombinant allergens (see Further Information websites), seems feasible. To avoid unwanted sensitizations that might occur eventually during the course of prophylactic treatment, it will be necessary to use hypoallergenic derivatives that do not share IgE-binding epitopes with the wild-type allergens. Owing to the low allergenic activity of the modified allergens and the lack of a pre-existing IgE response to the derivatives in the individuals to be treated, it will be possible to administer high doses similar to those that are used in vaccination and tolerance-induction protocols. The fact that the current practice of vaccinating against infectious agents in early childhood does not induce allergic sensitization should mitigate any concern that prophylactic vaccination with hypoallergenic allergen derivatives might induce allergy. Nevertheless, experimental animal studies and clinical pilot studies will be required to assess the potential risks of prophylactic allergy vaccination. First, clinical studies might be conducted in non-atopic adults to exclude unwanted side effects (for example, the induction of allergic sensitization). If encouraging results are obtained and safety has been proven, it might be possible to vaccinate children that have a genetic predisposition for developing allergy.

Figure 3 | Proposed action of prophylactic allergy vaccines. **a** | In allergic individuals, sensitization occurs shortly after birth due to allergen contact. Repeated allergen contact during life might continuously boost allergen-specific immunoglobulin E production and, hence, might be responsible for the aggravation and spreading of allergic symptoms. In sensitized patients, allergen-specific IgG levels are low. Immunotherapy that counteracts established allergy is mostly associated with the strong induction of allergen-specific IgG antibodies and T-cell modulation. **b** | Prophylactic vaccination with hypoallergenic allergen derivatives shortly after birth might induce high levels of allergen-specific IgG antibodies, which will form complexes with allergens and, hence, probably prevent sensitization and/or the boosting of allergen-specific IgE production by natural allergen exposure. Consequently, IgE responses will not develop or will remain at low levels. **c** | Tolerance induction with hypoallergenic allergen derivatives early in life might prevent the development of IgE responses that otherwise would occur after allergen contact.

terms of their *in vivo* allergenic activity by skin testing of allergic patients^{111–114}, and some of the derivatives have been evaluated recently in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre (Vienna, Strasbourg and Stockholm) immunotherapy study of patients who are allergic to birch pollen.

Towards prophylactic vaccination

The conventional immunotherapy of allergic patients faces the inherent difficulty of attempting to counteract an already established pathological immune response. In addition to the treatment of established allergy, it might be necessary to consider prophylactic vaccination against allergy before initial sensitization has taken place and strong IgE responses and T-cell priming have been established. In untreated allergic patients, IgE and T-cell responses can be boosted continuously by allergen contact and, in severe cases, might lead to the inevitable progression of
