**Abstract** Platinum-based drugs cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are widely used in the therapy of human neoplasms. Their clinical success is, however, limited due to severe side effects and intrinsic or acquired resistance to the treatment. Much effort has been put into the development of new platinum anticancer complexes, but none of them has reached worldwide clinical application so far. Nedaplatin, lobaplatin and heptaplatin received only regional approval. Some new platinum complexes and platinum drug formulations are undergoing clinical trials. Here, we review the main classes of new platinum drug candidates, such as sterically hindered complexes, monofunctional platinum drugs, complexes with biologically active ligands, trans-configured and polynuclear platinum complexes, platinum(IV) prodrugs and platinum-based drug delivery systems. For each class of compounds, a detailed overview of the mechanism of action is given, the cytotoxicity is compared to that of the clinically used platinum drugs, and the clinical perspectives are discussed. A critical analysis of lessons to be learned is presented. Finally, a general outlook regarding future directions in the field of new platinum drugs is given.

**Cisplatin, the first platinum anticancer drug**

Cisplatin, *cis*-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (Fig. [1](#fig1)), is known as Peyrone’s chloride since the end of nineteenth century (named after Michele Peyrone, who synthesized it first). The cytostatic property of cisplatin was discovered by Barnett Rosenberg in the late 1960s, while he was doing experiments to analyze the effect of electric field on bacterial growth. He observed that bacterial proliferation was ceased and pinned down the cause of this phenomenon to the platinum electrode that was used. Rosenberg and colleagues identified cisplatin as a key compound responsible for the anti-proliferative effect. Clinical trials were initiated in 1971, and after circumventing a number of obstacles, cisplatin was finally approved for use in testicular and ovarian cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration and in several European countries in 1979 [1].

Cisplatin is active against a wide spectrum of solid neoplasms, including ovarian, testicular, bladder, colorectal, lung and head and neck cancers [2, 3]. The drug often leads to an initial therapeutic response associated with complete disease remission, partial response or disease stabilization. However, cisplatin therapy requires additional medication and is accompanied by severe side effects including dose-limiting nephrotoxicity, cumulative peripheral sensory neuropathy, ototoxicity due to irreversible damage of the hair cells in Corti organ, as well as nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, resistance to cisplatin represents a major hurdle to the success of the treatment. Many tumors are intrinsically resistant to the platinum drug. Moreover, many originally sensitive tumors develop resistance gradually after initial response [4].

Mechanism of action of cisplatin and resistance mechanisms

Multiple cellular events appear to contribute to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin, although DNA platination is seen as a crucial step. Alterations in any of these events manifest in drug resistance to the treatment (Fig. 2). The mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been classified into pre-target (i.e., those interfering with cisplatin transport prior to DNA binding), on-target (repair of Pt-DNA lesions), post-target (cellular events taking place after DNA platination) and off-target (alterations in signaling pathways not
directly engaged by cisplatin but interfering with cisplatin-induced proapoptotic events) [4].

Cisplatin had been long presumed to enter the cells by passive diffusion as its uptake is concentration-dependent and non-saturable. However, copper transporter 1 (CTR1), which is a transmembrane protein involved in copper homeostasis, was found to play an important role in the uptake of cisplatin as well [5, 6]. Ctrl−/− (CTR1-deficient) mouse embryonic fibroblasts accumulated much less cisplatin than their wild-type variants and were several times more resistant to the drug [7]. Downregulation of CTR1 is often observed in cisplatin-resistant cells [8]. In non-small cell lung cancer patients, low levels of CTR1 correlated with poor therapeutic response [9]. On the other hand, copper-extruding P-type ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B, were found to participate in cisplatin transport as well. Detailed studies showed that ATP7A sequences cisplatin in vesicular structures preventing further distribution of the drug, while ATP7B is responsible for cisplatin efflux [6, 10]. These transporters were reported to be upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells [11], and patients with high levels of ATP7A and ATP7B had significantly poorer overall survival [9, 12]. Other transporters appear to be involved, too. For instance, inhibition of Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase leads to a reduction in cisplatin accumulation, and the transporter is downregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells [13]. And although defects in cellular accumulation represent the most frequently and well-documented feature of cell lines selected for cisplatin resistance [6], we are still far from having a complete picture of transport mechanisms influencing tumor cell sensitivity to the drug. Very recently, the loss of LRRC8A and LRRC8D subunits of the heteromeric volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) was associated with resistance to cisplatin [14].

Once inside the cells, where the chloride concentration is much lower (4–20 mM) than in the bloodstream (100 mM), cisplatin is hydrolyzed yielding monoqua [Pt(NH₃)₂Cl(H₂O)]⁺ and diaqua complexes [Pt(NH₃)₂(H₂O)₂]²⁺ [15]. These reactive species bind to cytoplasmic nucleophiles such as glutathione (GSH), methionine, metallothioneins and other cysteine-rich proteins. This leads to the depletion of cytoplasmic antioxidant reserves resulting in the oxidative stress in cells. On the other hand, these nucleophilic species act as scavengers limiting the available reactive cisplatin and thus contributing to cisplatin resistance. Elevated levels of glutathione or glutathione-S-transferase, an enzyme mediating cisplatin coupling to GSH, were observed in cisplatin-resistant cells [4]. Platinum-glutathione conjugates were reported to be readily excreted out of the cells by multidrug resistance protein MRP2, a member of the ABC family ATPases. Thus, MRP2 also mediates cisplatin resistance

by increasing the efflux of drug [16]. Furthermore, overexpression of this transporter seems to correlate with poor prognosis [17].

The activated platinum species also react with nucleophilic centers on purine bases of DNA, in particular, N7 positions of guanosine and adenosine residues. The two reactive sites on the platinum center permit the formation of a cross-link between two adjacent guanines. In addition, platinum can coordinate to guanine bases of different DNA strands to form interstrand cross-links. The intrastrand 1,2-*d*(GpG) cross-linking induces a significant distortion in the DNA double helix [18]. This DNA lesion, which is assumed to largely account for cisplatin cytotoxicity, is recognized by several cellular proteins leading to the repair, replication bypass or initiation of apoptosis. Several protein families are involved in the recognition of Pt-DNA adducts including non-histone chromosomal high-mobility group proteins 1 and 2 (HMG1 and HMG2), nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.

HMG proteins are mainly involved in gene regulation and chromatin structure. HMG1 and HMG2 recognize intrastrand DNA adducts between adjacent guanines changing cell cycle events and subsequently inducing apoptosis [19]. HMG proteins also contribute to cisplatin cytotoxicity by shielding platinum-DNA adducts from repair [20]. On the contrary, NER is the pathway employed by cancer cells for removal of platinum-DNA adducts and for DNA damage repair. A cellular defect in this pathway resulted in hypersensitivity to cisplatin and the restoration of this pathway reversed the process [21]. On the other hand, enhanced NER activity is associated with cisplatin resistance [4]. Mismatch repair (MMR) protein complex does not actually repair cisplatin-DNA adducts, rather it tries to repair DNA damage, but after failing to do so, it initiates apoptosis. Downregulation or mutation of MMR genes is consistently documented in context of cisplatin resistance [22]. Another protein family, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins (PARP), critically involved in base excision repair, is getting attention, as PARP are highly expressed and constitutively hyperactivated in cisplatin-resistant cells [23].

DNA damage activates the signal transduction pathways that eventually lead to apoptosis. Post-target resistance results from defects in the signaling pathways as well as from problems with the cell death execution machinery itself. The inactivation of tumor suppressor p53 is one of the most predominant mechanisms of post-target resistance, as it is the case in half of the human neoplasms [24]. HMG1 and HMG2 facilitate the binding of p53 to DNA to induce the transactivation of several target genes involved in cell cycle progression (p21), DNA repair and apoptosis (Bax). Ovarian cancer patients with a wild-type p53 have a higher probability of recovering following cisplatin-basedtherapy than the patients with mutations in this protein [25]. Moreover, testicular neoplasms are particularly sensitive to cisplatin since they almost lack mutated p53 [26]. The contribution of the off-target mechanisms to cisplatin resistance is increasingly recognized. For example, overexpression of the ERBB2 protooncogene (also known as HER-2) encoding a member of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family was associated with resistance to cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer patients [4].

# Carboplatin and other second-generation drugs

The second-generation platinum drug carboplatin (*cis*-diammine(1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylato)platinum(II), Fig. 1) was developed in order to reduce the dose-limiting toxicity of cisplatin. Carboplatin’s mechanism of action is similar to that of cisplatin. However, the second-generation drug has a lower aquation rate due to the bidentate cyclobutane dicarboxylate ligand [27]. As a result of reduced reactivity, the neurotoxicity and ototoxicity after carboplatin treatment are much less pronounced. Due to its reduced toxicity profile, carboplatin is suitable for more aggressive high-dose chemotherapy. This drug is accepted worldwide and almost replaced cisplatin in combination regimens with paclitaxel for treatment of ovarian cancer [28]. But the dose is limited by myelosuppression, with thrombocytopenia being more severe than neutropenia and anemia. Carboplatin has limited efficacy against testicular germ-cell cancers, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and bladder cancer. As a consequence, cisplatin still remains the drug of choice for treating these diseases. As in the case of cisplatin, tumor resistance to carboplatin poses a major clinical problem. The mechanisms underlying carboplatin resistance are generally similar to the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance [29].

Nedaplatin (*cis*-diammineglycolatoplatinum(II), Fig. 1) has improved toxicity profile compared to cisplatin and pharmacokinetic properties similar to cisplatin [30]. It has limited regional approval (Japan) for treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck and esophageal cancer [15].

# Oxaliplatin and other third-generation drugs

The third-generation platinum drug oxaliplatin (Fig. 1) was developed to overcome resistance against cisplatin and carboplatin. In combination with 5-fluorouracil and folinate, this drug is used as an efficient treatment of adjuvant and metastatic colorectal cancer intrinsically insensitive to cisplatin [15]. Oxaliplatin is a platinum complex with (1R,2R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ligand and oxalate as a leaving group. The bidentate oxalate significantly reduces reactivity of oxaliplatin and thereby limits the toxic side effects to peripheral sensory neuropathy [15]. The DACH ligand is more lipophilic increasing passive uptake of oxaliplatin compared to cisplatin and carboplatin. Higher lipophilicity may also be a reason why oxaliplatin also employs some other routes of cellular entry than first- and second-generation drugs. Organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 have been implicated to mediate oxaliplatin uptake, as their overexpression significantly increases the cellular accumulation of oxaliplatin, but not cisplatin or carboplatin. Colorectal cancer cells overexpress organic cation transporters, which may explain the efficacy of the oxaliplatin in this particular type of cancer [31]. The clinical relevance of these transporters remains, however, unclear. In some clinical studies, increased expression of OCT2 correlated with prolonged progression-free survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [32]. On the other hand, OCT2 mRNA was barely expressed in nine colorectal cancer cell lines and in ovarian cancer patients [33]. Regarding CTR1, evidence that the transporter is involved in oxaliplatin uptake is not that strong as in the case of cisplatin; nevertheless, acquisition of oxaliplatin resistance was reported to be accompanied by CTR1 downregulation. Also reduced expression of the β1-subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was found in some oxaliplatin-resistant cells. Copper efflux transporters appear to play an important role in oxaliplatin sensitivity, too. Low levels of ATP7B in colorectal cancer patients were associated with a favorable outcome [33].

Similar to cisplatin, oxaliplatin mainly forms cross-links on the adjacent guanine bases or between guanine and adenine, however, to a lower extent. Nevertheless, oxaliplatin-DNA adducts are more efficient in inhibition of DNA synthesis. Due to the bulkier DACH ligand, oxaliplatin induces different conformational distortion on DNA. The bulkiness and lipophilicity of DACH are considered responsible for differential processing of oxaliplatin-DNA adducts. The latter are not recognized by MMR proteins. Interestingly, it does not lead to decreased cytotoxicity but makes oxaliplatin antitumor activity MMR independent. Besides, increase in replicative bypass, i.e., DNA synthesis bypassing platinum-DNA adducts, was reported not to correlate with cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin [34]. All these factors result in different activity spectrum of the drug compared to cisplatin or carboplatin. At present, oxaliplatin is being evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of gastric, pancreatic, breast and non-small cell lung cancers [15].

Among other third-generation drugs, lobaplatin and heptaplatin received only regional approval. Lobaplatin (Fig. 1) is approved in China for the therapy of metastatic breast cancer, chronic myelogenous leukemia and SCLC [15]. Its dose-limiting toxicity is thrombocytopenia. Heptaplatin (Fig. 1) has a bulkier amine ligand but is structurallysimilar to lobaplatin. The drug was demonstrated to be stable in solution, to have no remarkable toxicity and to retain cytotoxic activity in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. Heptaplatin is currently applied in the Republic of Korea for the treatment of gastric cancer. A Phase III study showed that heptaplatin combination with 5-fluorouracil is comparable to cisplatin/5-fluorouracil regimen with less severe hematological side effects [15].

# New platinum-based drugs

Given the toxic side effects and tumor cell resistance against clinically used platinum drugs, much effort was devoted to the development of platinum compounds, which would overcome these disadvantages. Numerous complexes have been synthesized, thoroughly investigated and evaluated in cancer cell lines and xenograft models. Some platinum drug candidates have reached clinical trials. Here, we review the main classes of platinum anticancer complexes in the context of their mechanism of action, cytotoxicity and clinical perspective.

## Sterically hindered platinum complexes

Since one of the resistance mechanisms is increased cytosolic deactivation of platinum drugs by sulfur-containing peptides and proteins, researchers aimed at decreasing reactivity through introduction of a bulky carrier ligand. Decreased reactivity was also expected to improve the toxicity profile, as was the case with carboplatin. The most prominent compound of this group is picoplatin, cis-[PtCl₂(NH₃)(2-methylpyridine)] (ZD0473, Fig. 3). This complex was indeed shown to be less susceptible to deactivation by intracellular thiols as compared to cisplatin [35]. Picoplatin retains its cytotoxicity in cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines independently of the resistance mechanisms prevailing [36]. An interesting feature of the drug is that it was the first platinum(II) complex, which could be administered orally. Applied either orally or intravenously it exhibits antitumor activity in vivo. The combination of picoplatin and paclitaxel was found to act synergistically [36]. Toxicity profile of picoplatin is similar to that of carboplatin, with thrombocytopenia being a dose-limiting factor. The new platinum drug showed antitumor activity against platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer in a Phase II clinical trial [36]. In a Phase II study in SCLC, the therapeutic effect of picoplatin in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant tumors was evaluated [37]. The observed overall response rates of 8.3 and 15.4 %, respectively, were modest. The median overall survival was 35.7 and 27.3 weeks, respectively. Following these studies, a larger Phase III SPEAR (Study of Picoplatin Efficacy After Relapse) trial has been launched. Unfortunately, it has not shown any advantage of the picoplatin arm over the control group (best supportive care) [38]. This disappointing outcome may have been caused, at least partly, by an unbalanced proportion of patients in the control group who received post-study chemotherapy. In addition, the subset analysis of refractory patients, i.e., those who showed no response or relapsed within 45 days after first line of platinum-based regimen, has shown a significant advantage of the picoplatin treatment in terms of progression-free survival [38]. It is unclear why best supportive care was chosen as control instead of drugs like topotecan known to show activity in the second-line treatment. Apparently, the choice of the control group has played a decisive role in the outcome of the SPEAR trial seriously damaging the clinical perspective of picoplatin.

Besides increasing steric hindrance of cisplatin, attempts to modify oxaliplatin in order to improve its therapeutic characteristics were made. For this purpose, a series of oxaliplatin analogs with various alkyl substituents was developed. A comparative study showed that oxaliplatin derivatives with higher lipophilicity had a potential to overcome oxaliplatin resistance; however, their absolute cytotoxicity was decreased [39]. Further evaluation revealed the methyl-substituted analogs {(1R,2R,4R)-4-methyl-1,2-cyclohexanediamine}oxalatoplatinum(II), KP1537, and {(1R,2R,4S)-4-methyl-1,2-cyclohexanediamine}oxalatoplatinum(II), KP1691 (Fig. 3), as the most promising candidates. Their activity in vitro was better than that of oxaliplatin in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant cell lines, with KP1691 being more cytotoxic than its isomer [40, 41]. Interestingly, of the two platinum complexes, KP1537 accumulated in human colon carcinoma cells to a much higher extent than KP1691. Even though KP1537 was susceptible to extensive

efflux in contrast to oxaliplatin and KP1691, it induced significantly higher amount of early apoptosis and more late apoptosis as compared to KP1691 [41]. These features of KP1537 are likely to account for its superior antitumor activity in vivo. In L1210 leukemia-bearing mice, KP1537 led to an increase in life span of more than 200 % with five out of six animals being long-term survivors, as compared to 152 and 122 % increase in life span for oxaliplatin and KP1691, respectively, and two out of six long-term survivors in each case. In another study, oxaliplatin derivatives were evaluated in colon cancer xenograft models [41]. Since the necessity of active immune response for oxaliplatin activity was recently shown [42], immunocompetent BALB/c mice have been compared with immunodeficient SCID/BALB/c animals. All three drugs have been active in immunocompetent mice and retarded tumor growth significantly, with KP1537 being the most potent compound. Oxaliplatin has shown no activity in immunodeficient mice; in contrast, tumor growth retardation has been significant for both oxaliplatin analogs with minor difference between them [41]. Both isomers have shown lower systemic toxicity, which allowed to increase the maximum tolerated dose [40, 41]. In spite of these promising findings, more detailed studies are needed to find out whether the methyl-substituted oxaliplatin derivatives are worth further clinical evaluation.

Platinum(II) complexes with biologically active ligands

Introduction of bulky ligands got a new twist with biologically active carriers. It was shown, for instance, that estrogen enhances cisplatin cytotoxicity by increasing the levels of HMG1 protein, which shields platinum-DNA adducts from repair [43]. As a number of human tumors have estrogen receptors, various platinum(II) complexes with receptors substrates were synthesized. The most interesting compound of this group is VP-128 (Fig. 4), an estradiol-tethered platinum complex with excellent receptor binding affinity [44]. In ovarian cancer cells, the complex induced caspase-independent apoptosis and autophagy due to the formation of acidic vesicular organelles [45]. Without an increase in systemic toxicity, VP-128 showed markedly improved in vitro and in vivo activity in ERα (+) breast cancer (MCF-7), which has weak sensitivity toward cisplatin. In ERα (-) breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-468), VP-128, and not cisplatin, resulted in nuclear accumulation of apoptosis-inducing factor. However, its in vivo activity was comparable to that of cisplatin [46].

A recent report has introduced a glucose-conjugated oxaliplatin-based complex Glu-Pt (Fig. 4) designed to

![9-aminoac-PtenCl₂ (n=2-5)](https://i.imgur.com/9-aminoac-PtenCl2-n-2-5.png)

specifically target glucose transporters (GLUTs). The compound shares the mechanistic principles with oxaliplatin but exhibits improved cytotoxicity. In DBA/2 mice bearing L1210 leukemia xenografts, maximum tolerated dose has been sixfold higher resulting in improved efficacy. The complex has also shown superior synergistic interaction with 5-fluorouracil and folinate making it interesting for further evaluation [47].

A widely studied group of biologically active ligands are intercalators. Combination of platinum with intercalators enables binding to DNA via two different sites—through covalent bonds of the platinum moiety and by intercalation of the ligand between DNA base pairs. It was expected that such bifunctional complexes would form DNA adducts, which would not be susceptible to the repair mechanisms. One of the first complexes was prepared by Lippard and co-workers and contained acridine orange (cis-[Pt{AO(CH₂)₆en}Cl₂]⁺, Fig. 4). It showed the same sequence selectivity in cross-linking DNA as cisplatin, and the ligand was found to intercalate into DNA in the distance of one or two base pairs from the Pt-DNA adduct [48]. Subsequently developed acridine-containing platinum complexes (9-aminoac-PtenCl₂, Fig. 4) had different sequence specificity [49] but failed to show an advantage over cisplatin in terms of biological activity. The acridine–platinum compounds were more active than cisplatin or than the corresponding free ligands in CH1 ovarian carcinoma cell lines. However, in contrast to the free acridines platinum complexes exhibited much lower activity in the cisplatin-resistant variant [50].

### Monofunctional platinum complexes

Later on, researchers turned to monofunctional platinum complexes, i.e., those featuring only one chloride as a leaving group. Such complexes had for a long time been considered inactive as the parent compound [Pt(dien)Cl] Cl (dien = diethylenetriamine) is not cytotoxic. However, when complexes with intercalators were concerned, it was presumed that a platinum moiety would be covalently linked to a nucleobase and an intercalator would additionally interact with DNA forming stable and structurally different adducts than cisplatin. This approach appeared to be fruitful and has produced many interesting compounds such as PT-ACRAMTU and its amide derivative (Fig. 5). These complexes rapidly intercalate into DNA followed by platination of a nucleobase at the intercalation pocket. This mechanism efficiently drives platinum away from the classical binding sites [51]. Such monofunctional-intercalative adducts induced much less distortion on DNA than cisplatin-d(GpG)-cross-link resulting in a decreased or negligible affinity of HMG domain proteins to recognize the adduct [52], which implies differences in adduct processing compared to cisplatin. The amide derivative formed DNA adducts faster than PT-ACRAMTU. Moreover, these adducts were repaired less efficiently. Rapid and irreversible DNA adduct formation correlated with higher cytotoxicity. In general, PT-ACRAMTU and especially its amide analog were more active in vitro than cisplatin and the free ligands with the most prominent results obtained in non-small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H460. Antitumor activity of the

hybrid compounds was attributed to higher cellular accumulation, faster formation and less efficient removal of DNA adducts as compared to cisplatin [51]. The monofunctional-intercalative adducts were capable of inducing cell cycle arrest in the S phase, while cisplatin causes cells to accumulate in G2/M phase [53]. Unfortunately, these advantages were not reflected in in vivo activity. PT-ACRAMTU failed to slow tumor growth in mice. Moreover, the compounds were quite toxic to animals with maximum tolerated doses an order of magnitude lower than in the case of cisplatin. Such lack of cancer cell selectivity makes these complexes unattractive for further clinical development. Specific delivery to cancer cells may significantly improve the therapeutic profile of the amidine analog of PT-ACRAMTU and lead to a promising antitumor drug candidate.

Another group of monofunctional compounds has been developed in the Lippard’s laboratory. They focused on complexes with a general formula cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂AmCl]⁺, where Am was a planar aromatic base like pyridine, purine, pyrimidine or an intercalator. The complexes with the latter (9-aminoacridine or chloroquine) were found highly toxic in preliminary animal studies and were not considered further [54]. Of these complexes, [Pt(NH₃)₂(pyridine)Cl]⁺, later referred to as pyriplatin (Fig. 5), had a remarkable affinity for organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2, which are believed to contribute to oxaliplatin influx. Interestingly, pyriplatin displayed higher cytotoxicity in the cells overexpressing OCT1 than in cells with low levels of the transporter [55]. The complex forms monofunctional adducts, which induce only little distortion on the DNA double helix [56]. Pyriplatin-DNA adducts are mainly repaired by NER and not by MMR or double-strand break repair. NER of the monofunctional adducts is, however, less efficient than in the case of cisplatin [54]. As a result, pyriplatin demonstrated a different in vitro activity spectrum as compared to the clinically used platinum drugs. But its cytotoxicity was much lower than that of cisplatin in all cell lines tested [57]. Since the studies with RNA polymerase II suggested the relevance of steric hindrance of the amine ligand for enzyme inhibition, the structure of the monofunctional complexes was varied to introduce a bulkier ligand. The platinum complex with phenanthridine, later called phenanthriplatin, turned out to be the most potent of the series (Fig. 5) [56]. Its cellular uptake is higher than that of cisplatin and pyriplatin, and the steric hindrance provides protection from thiol deactivation similar to that found for picoplatin [54]. Phenanthriplatin’s spectrum of antitumor activity on NCI panel of cell lines was different from other anticancer agents [56]. However, its activity in vivo has not been reported.

Platinum(II) complexes with trans-geometry

For a long time, *cis*-geometry was believed to be a necessary feature for platinum complexes to exhibit antitumor activity. However, increased repair of platinum-induced DNA damage by resistant cells turned researchers’ attention to platinum complexes able to build structurally different DNA adducts. Such unprecedented adducts were supposed to be processed by the cellular machinery in the other way compared to the cross-links formed by the conventional platinum drugs. Due to their geometry, *trans*-platinum complexes are predestined to interact differently with DNA than their *cis*-counterparts.

Transplatin (*trans*-[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂]) is known to lack antitumor activity, which has been attributed to the fast deactivation by sulfur proteins [58]. Interestingly, if transplatin is applied to the cells irradiated with UVA light, it forms interstrand cross-links and protein–DNA adducts and exerts cytotoxic effects comparable to those of cisplatin [59]. Introduction of the bulky ligands instead of ammonia decreased the rate of chloride exchange positively affecting the kinetics of DNA adduct formation and antitumor activity [58].

*Trans*-configured platinum anticancer complexes, apart from Pt(IV) and polynuclear platinum complexes, can be roughly divided into three groups: complexes with planar aromatic bases, with iminoethers and with aliphatic amines (Fig. 6). All three groups of compounds feature highly cytotoxic representatives, many of them retaining their activity in resistant cell lines [60–62]. A special subgroup of the complexes with planar aromatic bases was developed substituting chloride leaving groups by carboxylates, e.g., *trans*-[Pt(OAc)₂(NH₃)(3-pic)] (Fig. 6) [58]. The water-soluble carboxylate analogs were found to be slower in DNA binding than their chloride counterparts [61], which did not necessarily result in decreased antitumor activity [63]. Slower interaction with DNA may be compensated by enhanced cellular accumulation of these compounds [63].

As expected, *trans*-platinum complexes formed different DNA adducts than cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. Most of them first build monofunctional adducts, which tend to persist for a longer period of time. *Trans*-platinum complexes with planar aromatic bases later form interstrand cross-links to a higher degree than cisplatin. As compared to transplatin, the rate of monofunctional to bifunctional adduct conversion is much lower (*trans*-[PtCl₂(NH₃)(quin)] adducts persist for 48 h as monofunctional, whereas the conversion rate for transplatin reaches 70 %) [58]. In contrast, platinum complexes with iminoethers barely form interstrand cross-links; they build relatively stable monofunctional adducts first [60] later converting to protein–DNA cross-links [64]. The recognition and the processing

of the DNA adducts formed by trans-platinum complexes are also different from that of the conventional platinum drugs. Many of them are not recognized by HMG proteins and are not repaired by nuclear excision repair system [58, 64]. This explains antitumor activity of trans-complexes in platinum-resistant cell lines. Protein–DNA cross-links also appear to be of major importance for the anticancer activity of these compounds. The biological consequences of these cross-links are yet to be clarified.

A distinguishing feature of the trans complexes with planar aromatic bases is their ability to induce single-stranded protein-associated DNA strand breaks in a fashion similar to topoisomerase inhibitors. This group of platinum complexes forms DNA-topoisomerase I complexes. Interestingly, cis-counterparts barely produce DNA–protein cross-links and protein-associated strand breaks [58]. Furthermore, complexes with planar bases decrease telomerase activity. Noteworthy, many telomerase inhibitors also possess planar aromatic moieties [58].

As in vivo activity is concerned, there is little data available. Trans-[PtCl₂(NH₃)(tz)] was only moderately active against P388 leukemia. A platinum complex with iminoethers trans-[PtCl₂(E-iminoether)₂] (trans-EE) decreased the level of lung metastases but less efficiently than cisplatin. Treatment with this complex also did not lead to increased survival in mice compared to cisplatin. Trans-[PtCl₂(ipa)(dma)] exhibited no antitumor activity in the human ovarian CH1 xenograft, possibly due to its inactivation by plasma proteins [58]. Trans-[PtCl₂(NH₃)(pip-pip)] and trans-[PtCl₂(n-butyamine)(pip-pip)] were studied in BALB/c mice bearing A2780 ovarian carcinoma and mice with cisplatin-resistant counterpart A2780cisR. In spite of similar activity in vitro, trans-complexes extended life expectancy by 79 and 46 %, respectively, in contrast to 160 % increase by cisplatin. Being the most promising compound with respect to the cytotoxicity in cisplatin-resistant cell line, trans-[PtCl₂(NH₃)(pip-pip)] showed no activity in BALB/c mice with A2780cisR tumor. Trans-[PtCl₂(n-butyamine)(pip-pip)] was less effective than cisplatin [58].

Platinum complexes with trans-geometry do indeed form structurally different DNA adducts, which are also
processed in the other fashion than adducts of the conventional platinum drugs. *Trans*-configured complexes show promising activity in vitro, especially in platinum-resistant cells. Unfortunately, these findings do not transform into therapeutic efficacy in vivo. It is likely that altered biodistribution of *trans* complexes compared to the approved platinum drugs, e.g., fast deactivation by plasma proteins, is a key hurdle on the way to the clinical success.

### Polynuclear platinum complexes

As 1,2-*d*(GpG)-intrastrand cross-link induced by cisplatin causes DNA bending toward the major groove creating a kink susceptible to DNA damage recognition and repair proteins, the attention turned to polynuclear (also called multinuclear) platinum complexes. They were expected to form DNA adducts, which would span over several base pairs and would induce less distortion on the DNA double helix. One class of interesting anticancer polynuclear platinum compounds is represented by azolato-bridged dinuclear platinum complexes (Fig. 7).

Similarly to cisplatin, these compounds preferentially form intrastrand cross-links on adjacent guanines [65]. For the triazolato-bridged member of this compound class AMTA, additional electrostatic interaction with DNA was reported [66]. The DNA adducts of the dinuclear complexes partially unwind the double helix; however, in contrast to cisplatin, only a small extent of DNA bending is observed. These relatively little conformational changes result in the lack of recognition by HMG proteins [67]. The cross-links of the azolato-bridged complexes on DNA are also expected to be poor substrates for the NER enzymes [65]. These dinuclear complexes exhibit much higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin. They have a different spectrum of antitumor activity compared to the clinically approved platinum drugs as found on a panel of 39 tumor cell lines (JFCR39) [68]. The azolato-bridged complexes largely overcome resistance in PC-9 and PC-14 cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with resistance factors ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 for PC-9 cells and from 0.9 to 2.0 for PC-14 cells [69]. A tetrazolato-bridged dinuclear platinum complex 5-H-Y shows remarkably high antitumor activity in pancreatic cancer [70]. However, as these complexes were not patented, they have no chance to be developed for clinical use.

A different class of polynuclear platinum complexes was designed by Farrell and colleagues. They first focused on highly charged *trans*-configured complexes with aliphatic amines. The most prominent member of this class is the trinuclear complex BBR3464 (Fig. 7). This compound showed better uptake by tumor cells than cisplatin

Springerand overcame accumulation defects present in cisplatin-resistant cell lines [71]. As in the case of cisplatin, CTR1 is involved in cellular uptake of BBR3464. However, strong interaction of BBR3464 with phospholipid membrane models due to the high positive charge may point out at an alternative mechanism of the cellular entry [72]. BBR3464 was shown to platinate DNA to a higher extent than cisplatin [71]. The trinuclear complex forms long-range delocalized intra- and interstrand cross-links between guanines spanning up to six base pairs compared to a maximum of three base pairs in the case of cisplatin [73]. As a result of increased flexibility, DNA adducts induced by BBR3464 lack severe distortion due to bending and twisting. While both intra- and interstrand cross-links are not recognized by HMG proteins, intrastrand lesions are effectively removed by NER in contrast to the interstrand cross-links [74, 75]. The central tetraam(m)ineplatinum unit also plays an important role as it interacts with DNA by pre-association [76]. The trinuclear complex provokes differential cellular response to p53 activation and recognition, which is likely to account for its activity in cells featuring p53 mutations and therefore resistant to cisplatin [77]. All these properties are reflected in the cytotoxicity of BBR3464. The compound was found highly active in various cell lines (often more than 100-fold compared to cisplatin), and it overcame resistance in neuroblastoma, ovarian carcinoma and melanoma cells with different mechanisms of resistance [78]. Testing BBR3464 on the NCI cell line panel revealed a markedly different spectrum of activity compared to the clinically used drugs. The trinuclear complex was highly active in mice bearing GFX214 and MKN45 gastric carcinoma xenografts, which did not respond to cisplatin therapy. Interestingly, BBR3464 prolonged tumor growth inhibition even after the end of the treatment. However, the maximum tolerated dose of BBR3464 was tenfold to 15-fold lower than that of cisplatin [78]. In spite of these encouraging results, in Phase II trials in non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, ovarian and gastric cancer only sporadic response was observed [76]. The maximum tolerated dose was manifold lower than for cisplatin. The patients suffered from severe dose-limiting gastrointestinal and hematological side effects [85], which are likely to have resulted from higher plasma protein binding in human as compared to mice [79]. Apparently, progressive biotransformation and fast drug degradation facilitated by the trans-configuration of the chloride leaving groups are responsible for the disappointing results of the Phase II studies with BBR3464.

As the central platinum unit of BBR3464 interacts with DNA electrostatically, it was hypothesized that complexes with several tetraam(m)ineplatinum units may represent an inert alternative to BBR3464 in terms of reactivity. Moreover, a high positive charge would increase the

affinity for DNA. Such trinuclear platinum complex triplatin-NC (Fig. 7) showed higher accumulation in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells than BBR3464, supposedly due to the increased charge. The complex was reported to enter the cells via macropinocytosis facilitated by its interaction with cell surface glycosaminoglycans, which was observed to a lesser extent for BBR3464 and not at all for cisplatin and oxaliplatin [80]. Triplatin-NC appears to avoid deactivation by intracellular nucleophiles [81]. It binds to DNA in a non-covalent fashion: square planar tetraam(m) ineplatinum moieties form bidentate N–O–N complexes with phosphate oxygens through hydrogen bonding (phosphate clamps) [82]. Triplatin-NC also induces DNA condensation in nucleoli and transfer RNA aggregation leading to DNA transcription inhibition at the concentrations lower compared to the natural condensing agents like spermine [83]. The complex induces a robust G1 arrest in a p53-independent manner [80]. These features account for high cytotoxicity in various cancer cell lines, which is barely affected by p53 or Bax mutations [83]. Therefore, it is possible that triplatin-NC has overcome the limitations of BBR3464 and may represent a promising antitumor drug candidate.

### Platinum(IV) prodrugs

Platinum(IV) prodrugs are a new class of molecules that might improve the pharmacological properties of the platinum(II) anticancer agents currently in use. Platinum(IV) complexes feature additional ligands in the axial positions, which allows further chemical modification and adjusting properties. Platinum(IV) complexes are substitution inert. As a result, they are more stable in blood circulation due to decreased interaction with plasma proteins. Platinum(IV) prodrugs are activated by reduction transforming them into square planar platinum(II) complexes. Glutathione and ascorbate are believed to act as reducing agents, but substantial reduction by cellular proteins was also reported [84]. As the axial ligands are lost during activation step, they can be used to carry favorable pharmacological properties in the prodrugs, for instance, to maximize cellular uptake. In contrast, the nature and geometry of equatorial ligands determine cytotoxicity of platinum(IV) compounds. Platinum(IV) complexes have several advantages over their platinum(II) counterparts: (1) due to their high stability, they can be administered orally; (2) they have diminished side effects as they are less prone to react with proteins; (3) their axial ligands can be modified to improve the pharmacological properties, e.g., to target the platinum moiety to the tumor. Platinum(IV) anticancer complexes can be classified into three categories: complexes with axial ligands without any bioactivity

(hydroxides, chlorides, acetates, etc.), complexes with bioactive or targeting axial ligands and photoactivatable complexes (Fig. 8).

Platinum(IV) complexes without bioactive ligands

Tetraplatin, iproplatin, satraplatin (formerly JM-216) and LA-12 (Fig. 8) are platinum(IV) complexes without bioactive axial ligands that entered clinical trials. Tetraplatin was abandoned due to severe cumulative neurotoxicity, and iproplatin did not show any better activity than cisplatin or carboplatin [15]. Satraplatin was the first lipophilic platinum(IV) drug developed for oral administration. It is rapidly taken up by cells and overcomes accumulation defects in cisplatin-resistant cell lines [85]. In human, satraplatin is readily absorbed and yields several products upon reduction in the bloodstream, the most abundant and active species is thereby *cis*-amminedichlorido(cyclohexylamine)

platinum(II) [15]. In a Phase III trial in hormone-refracted prostate cancer, the complex led to an increase in progression-free survival and reduced the risk of disease progression by 40 %. However, because of the lack of convincing benefit in terms of overall survival, approval by the US Food and Drug Administration did not follow. It was attributed to the insufficient power of the study and/or difficulty to determine the actual reasons of death [15]. At present, satraplatin is undergoing Phase I, II and III clinical trials in combination with various drugs for treatment of prostate and non-small cell lung cancer as well as advanced solid tumors. However, as these studies are in a much earlier stage and will require further funding, it appears unlikely that the company would keep on developing satraplatin.

LA-12, an analog of satraplatin, showed higher uptake in A2780 and cisplatin-resistant A2780cisR cell lines than cisplatin, although its accumulation was reduced in A2780cisR cells compared to the sensitive counterparts.
The complex induced DNA lesions similar to those of cisplatin [85]. It overcame cisplatin resistance in A2780cisR cells caused by elevated GSH levels, as glutathione is responsible for activation of Pt(IV) complex through reduction, and not for deactivation as in the case of Pt(II) complexes [85]. LA-12 showed promising in vivo activity in mice bearing ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma and A2780 ovarian cancer [86] and has just finished Phase I clinical trials.

### Platinum(IV) complexes with bioactive ligands

The axial sites of platinum(IV) prodrugs offer the opportunity to increase the selectivity for cancerous tissue or intracellular targeting. As mentioned above, pre-treatment with estrogen increased cisplatin cytotoxicity in hormone-positive tumors [43]. Thus, estrogen receptor-positive [ER (+)] breast and ovarian cancer cells were targeted by a Pt(IV) complex with estradiol tethered to the axial positions (Fig. 8). However, an extracellular mixture of cisplatin and estrogen was more cytotoxic than the Pt(IV) prodrug indicating its inefficient cellular uptake or different pharmacokinetics [43].

Platinum(IV) complex with ethacrynic acid in axial position (Fig. 8) was developed to overcome glutathione-S-transferase (GST) resistance. Ethacrynic acid is an inhibitor of cytosolic GST. This prodrug was rapidly taken up and had higher efficacy than cisplatin after short incubation but only a moderate effect after 72 h [87]. A similar strategy was employed by Lippard and colleagues who added dichloroacetate ligands in axial positions of platinum(IV) prodrugs (mitaplatin, Fig. 8). Dichloroacetate alters the mitochondrial membrane potential in cancer cells. Subsequently, the cytochrome c is released and the apoptosis-inducing factor is translocated to nucleus. The cytotoxicity of mitaplatin is equivalent or exceeded that of other platinum compounds and comparable to that of cisplatin [88].

A Pt(IV) derivative of cisplatin-containing valproic acid (VPA) as axial ligands (Fig. 8) kills cancer cells more efficiently than cisplatin. VPA inhibits histone deacetylase activity to decondense chromatin and thereby increases the accessibility of DNA within chromatin for DNA-binding agents. The treatment of ovarian cancer cells with Pt(IV)-VPA complex resulted in enhanced histone H3 acetylation and decondensation of heterochromatin compared to free VPA. Pt(IV)-valproic acid conjugate binds to DNA to a higher extent than the complexes with biologically inactive ligands. Together with increased cellular accumulation, these factors seem to account for the enhanced cytotoxicity of Pt(IV)-VPA [89].

### Photoactivatable platinum(IV) prodrugs

Sadler and co-workers prepared a series of Pt(IV) complexes with azides (Fig. 8) to enable their selective activation in tumor tissue by radiation. The complexes are inert in the dark and stable toward deactivation by glutathione. Interestingly, *trans* isomers were more cytotoxic than their *cis*-counterparts. The use of pyridine ligands led to a marked increase in potency and activity at longer wavelengths [90]. When irradiated with blue light, the activity of *trans*, *trans*, *trans*-[Pt(N₃)₂(OH)₂(NH₃)(py)] (Fig. 8) toward esophageal cancer was enhanced in vivo [90]. The mechanism of action is distinct from that of conventional platinum drugs such as cisplatin. The photodecomposition route involves two one-electron transfers from azido ligands generating N₂ and Pt(II) species, which in turn form DNA lesions. These lesions are able to stall RNA polymerase II more efficiently than cisplatin [90].

Taken together, platinum(IV) prodrugs represent a promising class of anticancer compounds; especially, the employment of the axial ligands targeting the drug to the tumor has potential. In this case, it is important to ensure that the ligands stay attached to platinum all the way to the tumor but are cleaved off at the disease site. In general, many questions regarding cellular accumulation, bio-transformation in the bloodstream and inside the cells and in vivo activity of platinum(IV) prodrugs remain unanswered. Better understanding of how these complexes work may provide a key to the development of the first platinum(IV) compound in clinical use.

### Improved delivery

Although platinum drugs have brought major advances in oncology, their clinical success is often hindered by the adverse side effects and development of resistance. Additional obstacles include low bioavailability and low water solubility. Carrier-based delivery of platinum drugs specifically to the tumor is a strategy to overcome these limitations because of its potential to improve drug efficacy, reduce unwanted side effects and overcome defects in cellular accumulation accounting for drug resistance. Drug delivery systems often exploit the differences between healthy and tumor tissue in order to increase drug selectivity for the malignant tissue. Passive drug delivery is based on the ability of macromolecules to accumulate better in tumor tissue because of its increased permeability and poor lymphatic clearance, a phenomenon known as increased permeability and retention (EPR) effect [91]. Drugs coupled to liposomes, lipid particles, micelles and various other polymeric carriers selectively accumulate in tumors, while the clinically used cancer drugs have low molecular weight and easily pass through the membranes of cancerous as well as normal tissue. Therefore, the nanoscale size of the carrier is important, as it prevents extravasation in normal tissue and removal by renal clearance. Active drugdelivery achieves selectivity of a carrier-conjugated anticancer drug by using specific antibodies or ligands recognizing receptors present exclusively in tumor cells.

The most widely used motif in anticancer drug carriers is the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG). Due to its high aqueous solubility, high mobility and large exclusion volume, hydrated PEG forms a dense brush of polymer chains stretching out and covering the particle surface. Thus, PEG coating serves to decrease particle opsonization and thus make the carrier less recognizable by the reticuloendothelial system in the liver and spleen [92].

### Liposomal formulations of platinum drugs

Liposomes prepared from various amphiphilic phospholipids are lipid bilayer vesicles with an aqueous interior. The major advantage of this technique is that it can be used for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs utilizing the phospholipid bilayer and aqueous cavity, respectively.

LipoPlatin (Regulon, Inc.) is one of the most promising liposomal platinum drugs currently under investigation. This drug is prepared using soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC-3), cholesterol, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) and methoxy-PEG-distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (mPEG2000-DSPE). LipoPlatin comprises 9 % cisplatin and 91 % lipid (w/w) corresponding to drug-to-lipid ratio of 1:10. Preclinical studies of lipoPlatin in mice, rats and in severe combined immunodeficient mice revealed that it has lower side effects, especially nephrotoxicity, compared to cisplatin [93]. A Phase I clinical trial showed elevated accumulation of cisplatin in tumor tissues compared to normal tissue and did not show cisplatin-specific side effects such as nephro-, neuro-, ototoxicity and hair loss. Phase II studies of lipoPlatin in combination with gemcitabine showed significant clinical benefit in patients who were previously resistant to first- and second-line chemotherapy. Phase III trials in NSCLC and pancreatic cancer are ongoing. Moreover, lipoPlatin has obtained an orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma [93].

SPI-77 (Alza Pharmaceuticals, formerly Sequus Pharmaceuticals) is another liposomal formulation of cisplatin. In this case, cisplatin is encapsulated in stealth liposomes composed of hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-modified phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. The drug loading capacity of SPI-77 is very low (drug-to-lipid ratio ~1:70). Phase I studies of SPI-77 showed good tolerance in all patients with lack of toxicity typical for the cisplatin regimen [94]. But the trial was discontinued due to modest antitumor response. This could be due to low drug loading capacity and/or high stability of liposomes and inefficient release of the drug as was clear from low plasma concentration of free cisplatin and diminished platination

of DNA in tumor cells [95]. The example of SPI-77 shows that not only successful delivery but also efficient release of the drug is important for the efficacy of a drug delivery system.

Aroplatin (L-NDDP, originally Aronex Pharmaceuticals, now Agenus, Inc.) is a liposomal formulation of *cis*-bis-(neodecanoato)-{(1R,2R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane} platinum(II) (NDDP, Fig. 9), a structural analog of oxaliplatin with two branched aliphatic leaving groups of ten carbon atoms, incorporated in a matrix of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dimyristoyl phosphatidyl glycerol (DMPG). Due to high lipophilicity of the oxaliplatin analog, the drug-to-lipid ratio is 1:15 [96]. The liposomal carrier plays a crucial role in mediating the cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of the drug as the free drug itself has a very low cytotoxicity. It has been suggested that active intermediates are formed within a lipid bilayer. The activation appears to rely on the presence of DMPG and lipophilic leaving groups of NDDP [92]. A Phase II study showed significant but manageable toxicity in mesothelioma patients. In general, the response was promising; however, in some patients the areas of mesothelioma, which were not in direct contact with pleural space, were not exposed to the drug leading to poor efficacy [92].

Lipoxal (Regulon, Inc.) is another oxaliplatin formulation prepared in a manner similar to lipoPlatin. A Phase I study in advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients showed adequate effectiveness and greatly reduced side effects compared to oxaliplatin [97]. MBP-426 is an oxaliplatin formulation made of transferrin-conjugated *N*-glutaryl phosphatidylethanolamine. This drug binds preferentially to transferrin receptors expressed in tumor cells. Thus, the drug delivery is enhanced via uptake of MBP-426 by transferrin receptors in human cancer cells. This drug has shown encouraging anticancer activity in the preclinical setting and has entered clinical trials in gastric and esophageal cancer [92].

Cisplatin nanocapsules contain the platinum complex with high encapsulation efficiency (the average drug-to-lipid ratio exceeds 10:1). They are taken up by caveolae-mediated endocytosis or by the clathrin-mediated route in cells, which do not express caveolin-1. The cytotoxicity of cisplatin nanocapsules was twofold greater than that of the free drug [98]. This formulation did not show enhanced antitumor efficacy in animal models of ovarian cancer, which was attributed to insufficient accumulation of nanocapsules in the tumor tissue and disruption of the capsule structure due to the interaction with plasma proteins [99]. Nevertheless, this encapsulation strategy is rather encouraging, and if the problems of plasma stability and poor delivery can be properly addressed, for example, through active targeting, platinum drug nanocapsules may get a clinical perspective.

Platinum-polymer conjugates

This concept is based on covalent binding of the drug to a hydrophilic polymer. The most frequently used polymer for conjugation of anticancer compounds is the *N*-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA). AP5280 is one of the platinum-HPMA-copolymers (Fig. 9). It contains cisplatin linked to the polymer through a malonate end group. This conjugate with platinum loading capacity of 10 % by weight was 20-fold less toxic than cisplatin in vivo but showed 19-fold increase in platinum accumulation in B16 mouse tumors. Based on the improved therapeutic index in other mouse models, AP5280 advanced into Phase I/II clinical trials, which demonstrated promising efficacy and less platinum-based toxicity [100]. However, the company chose to proceed with a more promising conjugate AP5346 (Fig. 9), which represents an improved polymer carrier linked to a more potent oxaliplatin-like DACH-Pt moiety.

AP5346 or ProLindac (Access Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) consists of a biocompatible and water-soluble polymer bound to DACH-Pt via a pH-sensitive chelating group. The chelate is stable at physiological pH but releases the platinum moiety in more acidic environment of hypoxic tumors or endosomal/lysosomal vesicles inside the cells. ProLindac showed better tumor inhibition, reduced toxicity toward normal cells, increased and more sustained plasma

platinum levels and up to 16-fold increased platinum delivery to the tumor and 14-fold to tumor DNA. The conjugate works better than oxaliplatin in three colon xenograft models (Colo-26, HT-29 and HCT116), in the L1210 murine leukemia and 0157 hybridoma models [101]. ProLindac was well tolerated and showed no neutropenia or significant hematologic toxicity in patients with advanced solid tumors in Phase I trial [92]. Phase II study in recurrent ovarian cancer was initiated; however, in the last two years there has been no update on the status of the trial, which may indicate disappointing outcome. Interestingly, ProLindac is no longer listed as a drug under development by the company [102].

### Platinum delivery using dendrimers

Dendrimers are highly branched polymers with multiple end groups, which allow encapsulation or conjugation of various drug molecules in the core or at the surface. There is a wide variety of dendrimers, which are made from polyamidoamines, polyamines, polypeptides, polyesters, carbohydrates or DNA. The most frequently studied ones are polyamidoamines (PAMAM). PAMAM dendrimers can carry either amino groups or carboxylate groups at the end of their branches. Cisplatin conjugate with PAMAM dendrimers induced growth retardation of the subcutaneous B16F10 murine melanoma, while cisplatin alone had no antitumor activity [103]. Oxaliplatin conjugate with dendrimers has also been reported. The PAMAM dendrimers with carboxylic acid terminal group containing up to 40 DACH-Pt moieties at the surface retained water solubility and showed sustained release of active platinum species over 24 h at physiological conditions. But further study did not progress due to the modest efficiency of the conjugate [92]. A possible reason for this is irreversible binding of platinum to easily accessible amino groups abundantly present in the dendrimer. Two dendrimers featuring a PEG unit as a core and citric acid on the periphery with molecular weight of ca. 1000 Da and ca. 2000 Da, respectively, were synthesized. Cisplatin conjugate of the latter polymer demonstrated greater cytotoxicity in both sensitive and resistant HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, CT26 fibroblasts and SKOV3 human ovarian cells compared to cisplatin, while cisplatin conjugate of the former polymer demonstrated greater cytotoxicity toward HT1080 and CT26 cell lines. Increased cytotoxicity of both conjugates over the parent drug is encouraging for the possible use of dendrimer conjugates as carriers for platinum drugs [104].

### Platinum drugs in nanotubes

Nanotubes have tubular shape with one dimension in the nanometer scale, usually a diameter. Some examples of nanotubes are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), peptide nanotubes and template-synthesized nanotubes. The presence of open ends and a large inner volume facilitate incorporation of pharmaceutical species at high-loading capacities [92]. The possibility of incorporating and releasing cisplatin from SWCNTs was demonstrated. The released cisplatin retained the ability to kill human lung cancer cells, while the SWCNTs themselves were not toxic [105]. The cytotoxicity of *cis,cis*,*trans*-\[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂(OEt)(OOC-CH₂CH₂COOH)\], a platinum(IV) complex, was increased by >100-fold after it was tethered to a surface of carbon nanotubes (Fig. 9). The conjugate was taken up by endocytosis, and lower endosomal pH triggered the reduction and release of the active Pt(II) complex [106]. Targeted cisplatin–nanotube conjugates modified with folate or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Fig. 9) demonstrated selective accumulation and enhanced activity against folate receptor-positive tumor cells or EGF-overexpressing head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, respectively [107]. Ultra-short carbon nanotubes (USCNTs) of ca. 1.4-nm-diameter encapsulating cisplatin were more potent than the free platinum drug in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). Wrapping of USCNTs with a surfactant hindered the release of cisplatin resulting in higher cytotoxicity. For in vivo application, the surfactant molecules could be replaced with a cancer-specific protein [108].

### Platinum complexes in polymer micelles

Polymer micelles represent aggregates of block copolymers featuring core–shell architecture. They entrap drugs in the micelle core and increase the solubility of a drug. Poly(amino acid)-based copolymers, such as poly(aspartic acid), PAsp and poly(glutamic acid), PGlu, have been used most frequently for platinum drug delivery. Incorporation of cisplatin in such polymer micelles decreased nephrotoxicity, increased the circulation of micelle-bound drug in plasma and thereby increased exposure of the drug to the tumors. The size of cisplatin-containing micelles is about 30 nm, which allows them to penetrate into tumor tissues including poorly permeable tumors. PGlu-based cisplatin micelles incorporating cisplatin showed prolonged blood circulation and better accumulation in tumors. This formulation, called NC-6004 or Nanoplatin, led to complete tumor regression in some mice bearing C26 tumor, which was not accompanied by a significant weight loss [92]. The cytotoxicity of NC-4006 was comparable to that of free cisplatin in mice implanted with MKN-45 human gastric cancer cells [109]. A Phase I clinical trial of NC-6004 showed significantly better tolerability than free cisplatin with reduced side effects [110]. A Phase II study of the combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer patients
demonstrated that platinum hypersensitivity could be completely inhibited by prophylactic treatment and that there was no need for pre-hydration as required for the standard cisplatin regimen. Oxaliplatin-containing micelles (NC-4016) were also prepared and could overcome oxaliplatin resistance in vivo because of drug release in the perinuclear region targeting it directly to DNA. Clinical trials of NC-4016 are currently under way [92].

In summary, specific delivery of platinum drugs to the tumor is an attractive way to improve their therapeutic properties. A great diversity of carriers facilitates rapid design of new formulations. Although most of constructs under clinical evaluation rely on EPR effect, active targeting is likely to become a major strategy in the future. In the era of targeted drugs, this may be the best opportunity to bring a new platinum-based drug to the market. The available nanotechnology provides a good basis for the development in this direction.

## Novel combinations

Platinum drugs approved for clinical use are seldom given to patients as monotherapy. They are usually combined with other drugs in order to achieve a synergistic effect through different mechanisms of action and thereby to enable dose reduction for each drug. Good understanding of how platinum complexes work and which mechanisms are involved in platinum drug resistance paves the way for the development of new combination regimens. Here, we summarize the most interesting recent developments in this field.

As downregulation of copper transporter 1 is associated with cisplatin resistance, copper-chelating agents (e.g., trientine), which stimulate expression of this transporter, have been supposed to boost cisplatin uptake and thereby to sensitize tumor cells to the drug. Despite encouraging results in cell line models, therapeutic response in patients was low (19%). It may be due to the heterogeneous cohort of patients and tumor entities in the study resulting in different capacity of copper chelation to induce CTR1 [111].

Reports on synergistic interaction between platinum drugs and various inhibitors of EGFR signaling have drawn attention of clinicians to these combinations. However, so far the results have been mostly disappointing. Combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel with sorafenib even increased mortality in patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma in a Phase III trial [112]. Addition of gefitinib did not improve efficacy of the cisplatin/gemcitabine regimen in a Phase II study [113]. Nevertheless, compared to the standard pemetrexed/platinum treatment, gefitinib was able to improve progression-free survival in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations [114].

In addition, there is growing interest in combining platinum drugs with PARP inhibitors targeting DNA repair system. A combination of cisplatin with PARP inhibitors acted synergistically in several NSCLC cell lines independently of their p53 status, whereas treatment with either drug alone had no effect. Synergistic interaction was attributed to the induction of DNA damage foci, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, caspase activation and plasma membrane rupture [23]. In Phase I studies, combination of olaparib with cisplatin or cisplatin/gemcitabine regimen was not very well tolerated, but promising activity in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations warrants further investigation [115]. A Phase II randomized study in NSCLC showed no benefit from iniparib addition to the standard cisplatin/gemcitabine therapy. However, the results could have been influenced by imbalances in key baseline characteristics, such as performance status, gender and disease stage [116].

### Lessons to be learned and future directions

When considering efforts put into understanding how platinum drugs work and into development of new anticancer platinum complexes, one may wonder why we have not yet got another platinum drug approved for clinical use. A vast number of new compounds have been prepared and tested in cell line models. Unfortunately, the latter only poorly reflect the clinical situation. High cytotoxicity in tumor cell cultures should be in the first place viewed as a sign of general toxicity, and not of anticancer activity. And indeed some very promising drug candidates were abandoned due to their toxic effects (Table 1). Parallel testing on healthy cells (e.g., human fibroblasts) could help to discriminate between toxic and antitumor effects at the early stage. It is also important not to discard the compounds with moderate activity in vitro right in the beginning but to estimate the therapeutic window in the early animal studies. After all, the widely and successfully used carboplatin is only moderately cytotoxic. Regarding platinum drug delivery systems, which largely avoid the toxicity problems, not only successful delivery but also sufficient release of the drug at the tumor site is important (Table 1).

The differences between test animals and humans also need to be taken into account. Besides different pharmacokinetics, the perception of tolerability and efficacy in animal experiments is distinct from that in the clinical setting. The accepted level of toxicity is high (body weight loss ≤15% and lethality ≤10% [76]) and may result in severe intolerable side effects in patients. In animal studies, inhibition of tumor growth is seen as a sufficient endpoint, whereas therapeutic response in patients requires the reduction in tumor lesions.

should be carefully planned to avoid influence of external factors such as post-study chemotherapy within a control group (as in the case of picoplartin). Pharmaceutical companies sometimes tend to aim at wider indication than the drug candidate actually offers. On the contrary, clinical studies would benefit from the focus on the advantages of novel drugs. Satraplatin was developed as an oral platinum drug, which after reduction yields active platinum(II) species sharing mechanistic principles with cisplatin and carboplatin. It might have been advantageous to evaluate satraplatin in the salvage setting in platinum-sensitive tumors and not in refractory prostate cancer. Phase II trials in ovarian cancer suggested at least similar activity of satraplatin and approved platinum drugs. Even in the case of comparable efficacy an oral platinum drug could be a rational choice in the salvage therapy.

In the clinical trials, it is also of importance to choose the appropriate dosing. For instance, in the case of carboplatin the dose is calculated based on the target AUC (area under curve) of a plot of drug concentration versus time and based on the renal function represented by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the so-called Calvert formula. This dosing strategy helps to compensate for the interpatient variability. It relies on the specific pharmacokinetics of carboplatin, as nearly three quarters of the drug is excreted in the urine in the intact form. Such pharmacology-based dosing could be considered for new inert platinum complexes, since their plasma protein binding is expected to be low resulting in predominantly renal clearance. Nevertheless, the Calvert formula has its drawbacks. It does not cover specific patient groups such as older and overweight patients, as well as children. For children, for example, a modification of the equation by Newell has been introduced. Another problem is measurement or estimation of the GFR or creatinine clearance, which substitutes GFR in some new algorithms. Measurements are either inconvenient and expensive (radiotopic methods) or inaccurate (24-h urine collection). For this reason, several new methods of GFR estimation have been developed. At present, it is, however, inconclusive, which estimation formula is better [117].

Understanding the factors leading to the lack of clinical success holds a key to the rational design of new drugs. In the times of targeted drugs and personalized medicine, drug development relies on distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissue and between patients. Therefore, a new platinum drug featuring only a different activity profile would not have the potential to attract the sponsors. Consequently, compounds and formulations stable in the bloodstream and in healthy tissues releasing active species in tumor environment (e.g., carrier-based formulations or Pt(IV) prodrugs) appear the most promising. In the future, they will likely utilize active targeting strategies, e.g., through binding to cancer-specific receptors. It should be noted, however, that the issues of platinum drug attachment and controlled release still pose a challenge, since delivery vehicles are often peptides rich in nitrogen and sulfur donors with high affinity for platinum.

Development of platinum drug conjugates with biologically active molecules sometimes showed that the conjugates were less effective than a simple drug combination. The advantage of a combination is that active substances are not bound to each other and can exert their effect independently. Combination of platinum drugs with copper-chelating agents is worth further investigation because it could become a low-cost treatment option and because resistant cells with low CTR1 levels could be more susceptible to the induction of the transporter. This strategy would get more promising if CTR1 expression levels could be determined influencing the decision to use a copper chelator or not. Combing platinum complexes with inhibitors of EGFR signaling may be considered for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutations. Platinum combinations with PARP inhibitors, e.g., olaparib, show promise for the group of patients featuring BRCA1/2 mutations. In this case, sequential treatment may be beneficial as olaparib response correlated with prior platinum sensitivity [116].

The example of combinations clearly demonstrates interpatient variability and the necessity to identify predictive factors for therapeutic response and toxicity. Predictors of severe ototoxicity and of cisplatin efficacy in head and neck cancer have been reported, but many more are yet to be revealed [102]. Rapid development of functional genomics and imaging technology opens possibilities to personalize platinum-based treatment of cancer. The application of these techniques is likely to influence platinum chemotherapy to a similar extent as the development of new drugs or drug combinations.

Platinum drugs represent a cornerstone of treatment of various solid neoplasms. Although the interest in new platinum compounds has been fading in the era of targeted drugs, the potential to improve on platinum-based treatment has not yet been fully exploited. New drugs and formulations actively targeted to the tumors and successfully released there, but also new platinum-based drug combinations and identification of predictive markers for patient response and side effects are likely to shape future developments in the field.
