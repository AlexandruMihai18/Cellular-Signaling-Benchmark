Dysregulation of pleiotropic growth factors, receptors and their downstream signaling pathway components represent a central protumorigenic principle in human hepatocarcinogenesis. Especially the Insulin-like Growth Factor/IGF-1 receptor (IGF/IGF-1R), Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF/MET), Wingless (Wnt/β-catenin/FZD), Transforming Growth Factor α/Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (TGFα/EGFR) and Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ/TβR) pathways contribute to proliferation, antiapoptosis and invasive behavior of tumor cells. This review focuses on the relevant alterations in these pathways identified in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Resultant functional effects are modulated by multiple cross-talks between the different signaling pathways and additional tumor-relevant factors, such as cyclooxygenase-2 and p53. Several specific strategies are currently under development such as receptor kinase inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies and antagonistic proteins, which may improve the systemic treatment of human HCCs.

Factor (IGF)-, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)-, Wingless (Wnt)-, Transforming Growth Factor α (TGFα)/Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)- and Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) signaling. Therefore, these factors, their receptors and associated downstream signaling cascades represent prominent therapeutic targets. Growth factors exert their multiple, partially overlapping functions (mitogenic, motogenic, antiapoptotic and angiogenic) in a paracrine/autocrine manner via transmembranous receptors. Ligand binding results in receptor activation with phosphorylation of cytoplasmic components and induction of several signaling cascades. As growth factor signaling is instrumental for normal embryogenesis and organ development as well as tissue regeneration and repair, these pathways (Figure 1) are tightly regulated at several levels. Dysregulation of these factors and their pathway components has been connected with essential tumor properties such as tumor cell proliferation, antiapoptosis neo-angiogenesis, invasive behavior and chemotherapy resistance. This review focuses on the molecular and functional changes as well as the potential networks/cross-talks of these pathways in human hepatocarcinogenesis and the resulting therapeutic potential.

### Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is already the fifth most prevalent human malignancy worldwide and shows increasing incidence (El-Serag, 2002). In more than 80% of all cases, a well-defined etiology (e.g. viral infection, chronic alcohol abuse) is associated with its development. Because the current therapeutic options for HCC patients are sobering, there is a great need to analyse molecular oncogenic mechanisms in order to determine novel targets for specific systemic therapy. There is vast evidence for protumorigenic growth factor signaling dysregulation in human HCCs affecting different signaling systems such as Insulin-like Growth

### Signaling pathways and their dysregulation

#### Insulin-like Growth Factor signaling axis

The IGF signaling pathway is of central relevance in embryogenesis as well as lifespan regulation, and exhibits potent proliferative and antiapoptotic properties. Key regulatory molecules of this axis are small ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II, 7–8 kDa), IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1–6) and membrane-bound receptors (IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), as well as the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/M6PR, IGF-2R)). Bioavailability of both IGFs is influenced by the presence of secreted IGFBPs (Murphy, 1998) as well as IGF-2R, which directs IGFs to lysosomal degradation (Braulke, 1999). However, the system is far more complex, as both ligands not only bind to their conventional receptors (IGF-1R (Esposito *et al.*, 1997) and IGF-2R) but also to the insulin receptor (isoform A, INSR; Frasca *et al.*, 1999), and INSR/IGF-16F-1R hybrid molecules (Sakai and Clemmons, 2003). After ligand binding, rapid phosphorylation of distal intracellular targets

Predominantly dysregulated signaling components are highlighted in dark gray. Seldom regulated components (e.g. Smad2), molecules not expressed by tumor cells (e.g. HGF) and distinct protein family members dysregulated in HCCs (e.g. FZD-7) are highlighted in light gray.

commences specific cellular downstream effectors such as INSR-substrates IR5 (IRS1,2,4), leading to the activation of, for example, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT/PKB; Figure 1). Moreover, binding of the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) leads to the activation of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase family (MAPK) signaling pathway. Together, this regulatory network results in the transcriptional activation of numerous target genes including p27kip1, MYC, FOS, cyclin B and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF); (reviewed by Foulstone et al., 2005).

As far as we know, dysregulation of IGF signaling in HCC predominantly occurs at the level of IGF-II bioavailability. This potent growth factor is highly expressed in fetal liver, but strongly downregulated after birth. Its transcriptional regulation is complex and comprises four different tissue-specific and epigenetically regulated promoters (P1–P4; Vu and Hoffman, 1994), and two polyadenylation signals (Sussenbach et al., 1992). Although the physiological function of low-level IGF-II expression in adult liver has largely remained obscure, there is a large body of evidence for multiple protumorigenic functions during hepatocarcinogenesis such as antiapoptosis, stimulation of proliferation and activation of angiogenesis. IGF-II is overexpressed in 16–40% of human HCCs (Table 1), and possibly even in some premalignant lesions (Cariani et al., 1988; Ng et al., 1998; Aihara et al., 1996; Sohda et al., 1996; Breuhahn et al., 2004), in HCC cell lines (Li et al., 1997; Breuhahn et al., 2004; Lund et al., 2004) and in several HCC animal models (Schirmacher et al., 1991, 1992; Harris et al., 1998). Elevated expression in HCC cells results from transcriptional activation such as loss of promoter-specific imprinting or re-activation of the fetal promoter (P2–P4) pattern (Li et al., 1997; Vernucci et al., 2000). In keeping with the activation of the IGF-axis, IRS-1 (Nishiyama and Wands, 1992) and IRS-2 (Boissan et al., 2005) are frequently elevated in human HCCs. In vitro IGF-II treatment of IGF-II-overexpressing HCC cell lines has no functional effects, indicating maximal autocrine stimulation. This observation is further supported by the progressive accumulation of unbound, active IGF-II in HCC cell supernatants.

Inhibition of IGF-II in HCC cells reduces cell proliferation, increases apoptosis and improves chemotherapy response (Lund et al., 2004), whereas IGF-II overexpression correlates with high proliferation in HCC animal-models (Schirmacher et al., 1992).

In hepatitis B virus (HBV)-and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated HCCs, a possible mechanistic link between potentially oncogenic viral proteins and the IGF-II level in HCC cells has been described (Park et al., 1995; Nardone et al., 1996). The HBV-derived HBx protein in particular has been shown to increase IGF-II expression, presumably owing to SP1-mediated reactivation of fetal-type IGF-II promoters (Lee et al., 1998; Kang-Park et al., 2001). The HCV-derived core gene product also acts as a transactivator and therefore induces expression of IGF-II from P4 through SP1 and EGR-1 binding sites (Lee et al., 2001). However, elevated IGF-II levels owing to the presence of viral infections may represent a premalignant phenomenon as IGF-II expression correlates with HBV-and HCV-induced cirrhosis (Tanaka et al., 1996; Sedlaczek et al., 2003). Although a constitutive overexpression of IGF-1R in HCCs was not described, a correlation between IGF-1R gene expression and the presence of HBx protein has been proposed in HCC cell lines (Kim et al., 1996).

IGF-II bioavailability may also in part be regulated through IGF-2R; downregulation or deletion of this receptor should theoretically lead to locally increased concentrations of IGF-II molecules. Expression of IGF-2R has been described to be reduced in 63% of human HCC (Sue et al., 1995). Moreover, loss of heterozygosity at the igf-2r locus has been published for HCCs and its premalignant lesions (De Souza et al., 1995a; Oka et al., 2002), whereas inactivating mutations of the second allele have been detected in about 25% of the cases (De Souza et al., 1995b). Additionally, several missense mutations in the extracytoplasmic domain of IGF-2R efficiently disrupt receptor/ligand interaction, which is then followed by increased ligand bioavailability (Byrd et al., 1999; Devi et al., 1999). However, these results are still controversially discussed, as other studies failed to detect any genetic alterations at the igf-2r locus (Wada et al., 1999; Saeki et al., 2000; Enomoto et al., 2001), which might be owing to methodical or population-based differences.

More than 70% of IGF-II is bound to IGFBP3, the most abundant circulating binding protein for IGFs.
(Jones and Clemmons, 1995). Thus, downregulation of IGFBPs may contribute to elevated IGF bioavailability in tumor tissues. Indeed, expression of IGFBP1, -3 and -4 have been described to be frequently reduced in HCCs (Gong *et al.*, 2000; Huynh *et al.*, 2002). In addition, IGF-independent IGFBP functions on cell motility, cell cycle and apoptosis (Firth and Baxter, 2002; Mohan and Baylink, 2002) and the ability to concentrate IGFs near their receptor, consequently improving IGF bioactivity, are currently discussed. However, none of these hypotheses has been proven for HCC cells so far.

**Wingless/β-catenin signaling axis**

The Wnt signaling pathway is an evolutionary highly conserved pathway and involved in the regulation of proliferation, motility, cell/cell interaction, organogenesis and axis formation (reviewed by Wodarz and Nusse, 1998; Kikuchi, 2003). Nineteen different Wnt ligands (Wnt-type MMTV integration site) and 11 transmembranous frizzled receptors (FZD) have been described in humans (Figure 1). However, several extracellular antagonistic components like Wnt-binding elements (e.g. Cerberus) as well as FZD-receptor-binding elements (e.g. dickkopf (DKK)) further increase the complexity of this signaling network (reviewed by Behrens and Lustig, 2004). Combined with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6(LRP 5/6), the FZD receptor leads to differential phosphorylation of dishevelled (DSH), which in turn inhibits amino-terminal serine/threonine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic β-catenin by casein kinase-1α/ε and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). The tumor suppressor proteins axin-1/axin-2 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) interact with these kinases and facilitate phosphorylation of β-catenin, recognition of the E3-ubiquitin ligase receptor β-TrCP, polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition to this canonical degradation, an alternative pathway involving the p53-inducible E3-ubiquitin ligase seven in absentia homolog (SIAH) has been described, which permits β-catenin degradation independent of its phosphorylation status (Polakis, 2001). Stabilized, non-degraded β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus, forms complexes with LEF/TCF transcription factors and recruits chromatin-remodeling proteins such as CBP/p300 leading to the expression of numerous transcriptional targets. These Wnt/β-catenin targets include gene products responsible for proliferation (e.g. MYC), antiapoptosis (e.g. survivin), invasion (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)) and angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF). Thus, the activation of Wnt targets not only regulates tissue development and regeneration but it can also influence tumor growth and progression in the case of aberrant nuclear accumulation of β-catenin.

Depending on the study in 17–40% of human HCCs exhibit a nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (Nhieu *et al.*, 1999; Hsu *et al.*, 2000; Wong *et al.*, 2001; Prange *et al.*, 2003). Somatic APC mutations, which lead to an aberrant concentration of β-catenin, as shown in, for example, colon carcinomas (Ficari *et al.*, 2000), have seldom been described in HCCs. Instead, nuclear accumulation is in part explained by stabilizing point mutations and deletions in the N-terminal phosphorylation domain of β-catenin, which is observed in 19–44% of all cases (de La Coste *et al.*, 1998; Miyoshi *et al.*, 1998; Cui *et al.*, 2003; Prange *et al.*, 2003; Fujito *et al.*, 2004). In addition, mutational inactivation by deletions, missense and nonsense mutations has been described for axin-1 (5–14%), predominantly in the region responsible for β-catenin and GSK-3β interactions (Satoh *et al.*, 2000; Ishizaki *et al.*, 2004). Equally, axin-2 (Conductin), which also contains binding sites for β-catenin and GSK-3β, exhibits mutations in 3–10% of the HCCs (Taniguchi *et al.*, 2002; Ishizaki *et al.*, 2004).

Several additional factors have been described to increase β-catenin bioavailability and bioactivity in hepatocarcinogenesis. For example, PIN1 (a prolyl cis/trans isomerase), which has been shown to inhibit β-catenin/APC interaction (Ryo *et al.*, 2001), is upregulated with subsequent accumulation of β-catenin in more than 50% of all HCCs (Pang *et al.*, 2004). Ezrin-radixin-moesin binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), on the other hand, elevates β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription (Shibata *et al.*, 2003). Equally, FZD-7 is frequently overexpressed in HCCs (Merle *et al.*, 2004). Dapper homolog 1 (HDPR1), an inhibitor of DSH, has been described to be downregulated in 58% of HCCs associated with the accumulation of β-catenin (Yau *et al.*, 2005). Lastly, DKK-1 and -3, potential inhibitors of Wnt signaling, are dysregulated to a different extent in HCCs; however, the biological function of DKK in hepatocarcinogenesis is currently unclear (Wirths *et al.*, 2003; Hsieh *et al.*, 2004). It is also worth mentioning that several studies do not show a correlation between the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and the expression of several canonical transcriptional targets in HCCs (e.g. cyclin D1; Inagawa *et al.*, 2002; Joo *et al.*, 2003; Prange *et al.*, 2003). Thus, tumor-entity-specific expression pattern and differential protumorigenic molecular mechanisms of the Wnt pathway (e.g. in colon vs. hepatocellular carcinogenesis) have to be considered (Prange *et al.*, 2003).

Taking these data together, it is likely that more than one single factor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has to be dysregulated in an individual liver tumor to achieve aberrant β-catenin enrichment. An explanation for this situation may be the fact that nuclear enrichment is not mandatory for stabilized β-catenin. In support of this theory, β-catenin can be tagged for proteasomal degradation without proper phosphorylation by SIAH E3-ubiquitin ligase family members (Liu *et al.*, 2001a; Matsuzawa and Reed, 2001). According to this model, phosphorylation of β-catenin is not sufficient for efficient ubiquitin-mediated protein destruction. Thus, in some cases accumulation of stabilized β-catenin may exert selective pressure on Wnt pathway components (e.g. SIAH-1 (Matsuo *et al.*, 2003) and EBP50) not involved in the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Whether or not this functional link is also of relevance in HCCs remains to be explored.
Dysregulation of growth factor signaling in HCC

Transforming Growth Factor β signaling axis
The TGFβ superfamily of polypeptide growth factors includes TGFβs (TGFβ-1–3), Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), nodals, activins, and other related factors, which are highly conserved throughout evolution (Massague, 1998). Equally, a group of the so-called type II (e.g. TGFβ receptor type II (TβR-II)) and type I (e.g. TGFβ receptor type I (TβR-I)) receptors have been described that contain extracellular binding domains and intracellular serine/threonine kinase domains (Massague, 1998). Additionally, a third receptor molecule (TβR-III) does not have intrinsic signaling function but mediates ligand/TβR-II/TβR-I interaction. After secretion, TGFβ is activated proteolytically (e.g. by the M6P/ insulin like growth factor II receptor) and binds to TβR-II, which in turn leads to the recruitment and transphosphorylation of TβR-I. Afterwards, the transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3 (R-Smads) are recruited to the receptor complex and become activated via phosphorylation (Figure 1). This results in their release from the receptor, heterodimerization with the signal mediator Smad4 and subsequent translocation into the nucleus (Liu et al., 1997). Here receptor-activated Smads and Smad4 form complexes with potential co-regulators of transcription such as CBP/p300 (Feng et al., 1998), FAST-1 (Chen et al., 1997) and SKI/SNO (Liu et al., 2001b). The composition of these transcriptional complexes is believed to be largely responsible for the cell-type-specific effects of TGFβ. The transcriptional targets of TGFβ include genes that are involved in negative feedback regulation such as the inhibitory Smad7, which participates in targeting TβR-I for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Nakao et al., 1997; Kavsak et al., 2000).

TGFβ is a potent growth inhibitor for hepatocytes; therefore, inhibition of TGFβ-signaling is believed to be a central pathway that has to be impaired during human hepatocarcinogenesis. Conversely, TGFβ serum and urine levels are increased in patients with HCC (Tsai et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2000). Immunohistochemically, it has been demonstrated that TGFβ is upregulated in up to 40% of HCCs (Bedossa et al., 1995; Abou-Shady et al., 1999). Moreover, expression levels of the receptors are published as unchanged (Abou-Shady et al., 1999), up- (TβR-I; Musch et al., 2005), and downregulated (TβR-II (Sue et al., 1995; Kiss et al., 1997; Musch et al., 2005); TβR-I (Sue et al., 1995)) in HCCs as compared to adjacent liver tissue; overall, most studies document a reduction of the receptors in HCCs (up to 70%). One explanation for this bewildering situation may be bifunctional properties of TGFs. Although TGFβ has been suggested to inhibit hepatocyte proliferation, a tumor-promoting/proinvasive role depending on the presence of oncogenic Ras has been shown (Gotzmann et al., 2002). Moreover, not only the presence of the ligands but the ratio between both TβR-I and TβR-II influences the cellular fate of a given signal (receptor degradation vs signal transduction; Huang and Huang, 2005). These data may explain that TGFβ serum and urine levels are increased in patients with HCC (Tsai et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2000). High TGFβ levels correlate with decreased median survival and have even been proposed as a serologic marker to support detection of HCCs (Song et al., 2002; Okumoto et al., 2004).

The Smad-mediated signaling cascade, which is impaired in other carcinomas (e.g. ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma with Smad4 mutations in about 50%), seems to be intact in the vast majority of human HCCs. Smad2 mutations (<5%) and loss of Smad4 expression (10%) are infrequent molecular events (Yakicier et al., 1999; Longerich et al., 2004). Smad3 mutations have not been described in human hepatocarcinogenesis yet; however, recently published data clearly show a physical interaction between Smad3 and the HCV core protein, consequently antagonizing DNA-binding capacity of Smad3 and therefore reducing TGFβ-dependent signaling (Cheng et al., 2004; Pavia et al., 2005). Furthermore, the inhibitory Smad7 has been found to be upregulated in about 60% of advanced HCCs, but not in dysplastic nodules and early HCCs (Park et al., 2004). Combined, these data suggest that the TGFβ signaling axis is impaired on a functional and not on a structural level in hepatocarcinogenesis. The structural integrity might be beneficiary for HCC cells, as protumorigenic aspects of the TGFβ pathway such as tumor cell migration are preserved.

In contrast, the other TGFβ superfamily members have only rarely been investigated in human HCCs. Whereas BMP signaling is not related to HCC development, similarities with classical TGFβ signaling have been suggested in activin signaling during human hepatocarcinogenesis, which also depends on Smads as downstream effectors. Patients with HCCs exhibit elevated serum levels of activin (Yuen et al., 2002).

Hepatocyte Growth Factor/MET signaling axis
The HGF (scatter factor) is the most potent growth factor for hepatocytes and binds to its only known high-affinity receptor MET. This receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is predominantly expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells and regulates proliferation (Efimova et al., 2004), migration (Monvoisin et al., 1999), cell survival (Suzuki et al., 2000), morphogenesis (Johnson et al., 1993), angiogenesis (Schmidt et al., 1995), as well as tissue regeneration (Borowiak et al., 2004). Hepatocyte growth factor binding and MET multimerization results in receptor auto- and paraphosphorylation of adaptor proteins (e.g. Gab-1 and Grb2; Figure 1), followed by the activation of cytoplasmic downstream effectors (e.g. phospholipase C (PLC)γ, Stats, PI3K and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2; reviewed by Stuart et al., 2000). Specificity of the HGF/MET signaling axis is achieved through the presence of unique adaptors (Gab-1; Sachs et al., 2000) and the interaction with various membranous binding partners (e.g. β4-integrins; Trusolino et al., 2001). Subsequent activation of distinct transcription factors (e.g. Ets-1 and activator protein-1; Johnson et al., 1995; Paumelle et al., 2002) leads to the expression of numerous target genes (e.g. MMPs and urokinase-type plasminogen
activator (uPA); Sato *et al.*, 1995; McCawley *et al.*, 1998; Jiang *et al.*, 2001; Monvoisin *et al.*, 2002; Ozaki *et al.*, 2003).

MET is detectable in most HCCs (~70%; Table 1; Suzuki *et al.*, 1994; Kiss *et al.*, 1997); however, overexpression of the receptor as compared to peritumorous liver tissue is observed in a lower number of tumor samples (20–48%; Boix *et al.*, 1994; Suzuki *et al.*, 1994; Kiss *et al.*, 1997; Ueki *et al.*, 1997; Tavian *et al.*, 2000). This induction in HCC cells may be attributed to different molecular mechanisms, such as genomic alterations (7q gains in 16.8%; Moinzadeh *et al.*, 2005), tumor hypoxia (Pennacchietti *et al.*, 2003) and growth factor-dependent transcriptional activation of MET (e.g. by HGF; Seol *et al.*, 2000). In addition, somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain have been detected in childhood HCCs (30%) but not in adult HCCs (Park *et al.*, 1999). Furthermore, receptor transactivation by EGF receptor (EGFR) and RON (Follenzi *et al.*, 2000; Jo *et al.*, 2000) or cell/cell contact (Wang *et al.*, 2001) represent potential molecular mechanisms for ligand-independent activation of this signaling pathway. Similarly, HGF has been shown to be overrepresented in HCCs as compared to the normal liver; however, it is not expressed by tumor cells themselves (Selden *et al.*, 1994; Noguchi *et al.*, 1996). Instead stellate cells and myofibroblasts are induced to secrete HGF by tumor cell products and HGF in turn stimulates tumor cell invasiveness (D'Errico *et al.*, 1996; Neaud *et al.*, 1997; Guirouilh *et al.*, 2000, 2001). Whether this indirect, paracrine interaction is sufficient to exert protumorigenic effects *in vivo* remains unclear. Hepatocyte growth factor is secreted in an inactive proform, which needs proteolytic cleavage for full bioactivity. Therefore, bioavailability of pro-HGF-activating proteins such as HGF activator inhibitor type 1 (Nagata *et al.*, 2001) and uPA (De Petro *et al.*, 1998) are required for ligand-induced onset of the HGF/MET signaling axis.

In the majority of the studies, increased levels of MET in HCCs do not correlate with tumor size or invasive behavior (Boix *et al.*, 1994; Okano *et al.*, 1999); however, one study links the expression of MET with increased intrahepatic metastasis and decreased 5-year survival of patients (Ueki *et al.*, 1997). Additionally, overexpression of MET is detected predominantly in poorly differentiated HCCs (Daveau *et al.*, 2003). Although one study does not demonstrate a correlation of HGF expression levels with patient survival or clinicopathological parameters (Ueki *et al.*, 1997), recently published data show that higher HGF serum levels negatively correlate with patient survival time (Vejchapipat *et al.*, 2004) and positively correlate with tumor size (Yamagamim *et al.*, 2002).

heparin-binding EGF, amphiregulin, betacellulin, epiregulin, epigen and crypto. These growth factors represent a family of transmembrane-anchored molecules, which can be cleaved by ectodomain (proteolytic) shedding (e.g. by tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17 (TACE/ADAM17); Sunnarborg *et al.*, 2002). This process regulates, for example, bioavailability (and therefore bioactivity) of the ligands and signal duration (Massague and Pandiella, 1993). The tyrosine receptor kinase family consists of four known members (EGFR (Her1/ErbB-1), neu/Her2/ErbB-2, Her3/ErbB-3 and Her4/ErbB-4). Upon ligand binding, the receptors form either homo- or heterodimers and initiate signal transduction.

Depending on the kind of ligand and its concentration differential phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues at the intracytoplasmic portion of the molecule has been described (Guo *et al.*, 2003). This receptor region in turn serves as a docking site for recruitment of proteins with Src homology 2 domains such as Grb2 (Zhang *et al.*, 2003) and Shc, which activate multiple downstream pathways (Figure 1). For EGFR, several distinct signaling pathways have been described, which can be directly or indirectly activated by specific MAPK kinases (e.g. ERK, JUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) and ERK5). Whereas MEK1/2 activates ERK1/2, MKK3/6 is responsible for p38 phosphorylation, MKK4/7 regulates JNK MAPKs and MEK5 is responsible for ERK5 activation (reviewed by Chang and Karin, 2001). This network is further complicated by several regulatory feedback mechanisms (Sugiura *et al.*, 2003; Sweeney and Carraway, 2004).

TGFα and EGF stimulate hepatocellular DNA synthesis and act as potent mitogens for hepatocytes (Mead and Fausto, 1989; Rescan *et al.*, 2001). Overexpression of TGFα is frequently observed in human HCCs and patients suffering from HCC may have elevated urinary TGFα levels (Yeh *et al.*, 1987; Chuang *et al.*, 1991). TGFα is also expressed at high levels in HCC cell lines and all downstream signaling components have been described to be structurally intact (Hisaka *et al.*, 1999). However, the published data are not unequivocal, as immunhistochemical analyses of TGFα also found decreased protein levels in HCCs (Table 1) as compared to surrounding non-tumorous liver tissue (Kiss *et al.*, 1997). Because staining intensity of TGFα does not necessarily represent ligand bioactivity (proteolytic shedding of membrane-bound TGFα by, for example, ADAMs), the immunhistochemistry may still depict inactive TGFα in the liver tissue and bioactive (cleaved) TGFα in the tumor. In addition, TGFα seems to act during the early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis and has been described to correlate with tumor differentiation and proliferation (Kira *et al.*, 1997; Zhang *et al.*, 2004). Interestingly, accumulation of pro-TGFα has recently been found in human and rat hepatocyte nuclei suggesting a direct role of pro-TGFα in mitosis (Grasl-Kraupp *et al.*, 2002). Furthermore, pro-TGFα concentrations increase from normal liver

Transforming Growth Factor α/Epidermal Growth Factor signaling axis

The TGFα/EGF cytokine family includes several ligands that bind to the EGFR. In humans, at least eight known ligands for EGFR have been described: TGFα, EGF,
over premalignant lesions to HCCs (Schausberger *et al.*, 2004).

Heparin-binding EGF, which has been shown to be a more potent mitogen for hepatocytes than EGF, can be detected immunohistologically in 59–100% of HCCs, but not or only weakly in the surrounding parenchyma (Inui *et al.*, 1994). Heparin-binding EGF expression appears to be a prognostic marker for disease-free survival and thus may be involved in early hepatocarcinogenesis (Ito *et al.*, 2001a).

The receptors EGFR/ErbB-1 (Nakopoulou *et al.*, 1994; Kira *et al.*, 1997; Ito *et al.*, 2001b), neu/Her2/ErbB-2 (Nakopoulou *et al.*, 1994; Ito *et al.*, 2001b), Her3/ErbB-3 (Ito *et al.*, 2001b) and Her4/ErbB-4 (Ito *et al.*, 2001b) are expressed in HCCs; however, staining frequency and intensity of the tumor tissues in comparison to the surrounding non-tumorous liver tissues differ between these studies (Table 1). It is noteworthy that in contrast to other carcinomas (e.g. breast cancer), amplification of the ErbB2 gene is considered uncommon in human HCCs (Prange *et al.*, 2003; Xian *et al.*, 2005).

Multiple links between chronic HBV infection and expression of TGF signaling components have been described. Firstly, intracellular TGFα co-localizes with the HBV-surface antigen (pre-S1) in liver tissues with chronic HBV infection, presumably owing to nonspecific retention in the endoplasmatic reticulum by pre-S1 (Schirmacher *et al.*, 1996). Secondly, in HCC cells HBV-DNA induces TGFα expression (Tabor *et al.*, 1992). Thirdly, TGFα levels in HCCs correlate with the presence of viral polypeptide (HBs and HBc) in the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (Hsia *et al.*, 1992). Whether this is owing to HBx-mediated transactivation of TGFα promoter activity is currently unknown (Kim and Rho, 2002).

### Cross-talk with protumorigenic factors

Potential cross-talks of the different growth factor signaling pathways with each other and with other protumorigenic factors have been shown to promote tumor growth and tumor progression. Functions of distinct signaling pathways can be amplified (e.g. increased proliferation) and even novel protumorigenic qualities may be acquired and might further facilitate tumor progression (e.g. via p53-mediated chromosomal stability/instability). In turn, the bioactivity of growth factor pathways may be the target of other oncogenic pathways (e.g. p53-induced expression of growth factor components).

### Interaction of growth factor signaling with other oncogenic pathways

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 catalyses the enzymatic conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (e.g. prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂)) and is frequently over-expressed in HCCs (Shiota *et al.*, 1999; Bae *et al.*, 2001). Cyclooxygenase-2 also interacts with several growth factor pathways (reviewed by Wu, 2006).

Dysregulation of growth factor signaling in HCC  
K Breuhahn *et al.*

Elevated COX-2 levels may be owing to IGF-II/IGF-1R-mediated induction of COX-2 expression as was already shown in colon carcinoma cells (Di Popolo *et al.*, 2000). *Vice versa*, selective inhibition of COX-2 bioactivity by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; for example, celecoxib) leads to reduced IGF-1R expression in HCC cells (unpublished own data), which may in part explain the observed proapoptotic effects of celecoxib on these cells (Kern *et al.*, 2002, 2004).

Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and mutant Ras increase COX-2 expression in HCC cell lines, followed by elevated PGE-2 level in the cell culture supernatant (Araki *et al.*, 2003). Because there is evidence for the existence of Ras mutations in rare vinyl chloride-dependent HCCs (Weihrauch *et al.*, 2001a, b), the combination of nuclear β-catenin enrichment and K-RAS mutations may account for the induction of COX-2 in a small subgroup of HCCs.

Hepatocyte growth factor induces the expression of COX-2 and synthesis of PGE₂ in gastric mucosa cells (Chen *et al.*, 2005). In turn, it has been shown that COX-2/PGE₂ activates the MET signaling axis via transactivation of EGFR in HCC cells (Han *et al.*, 2006. In HCC cells, selective NSAIDs such as NS-398 reduce HGF-mediated effects such as invasiveness and expression of MMPs (Abiru *et al.*, 2002).

There are also multiple interactions of growth factor signaling pathways with p53, a central regulator of apoptosis, cell cycle and genomic stability (reviewed by Sherr and McCormick, 2002). Loss of function as well as gain of function of p53 by point mutations, deletions or interaction with viral proteins enable cancer cells to escape p53-dependent growth control.

*In vitro* IGF-II promoter activity and protein biosynthesis is repressed by p53<sup>w</sup> (Zhang *et al.*, 1996; Lee *et al.*, 2000), whereas the aflatoxin-induced p53 mutation (p53<sup>mut(249)</sup>) markedly induces IGF-II accumulation through enhanced formation of transcriptional complexes in HCC cells (Lee *et al.*, 2000) and increases IGF-1R expression in HCC cells (Lee *et al.*, 2003). However, as IGF-1R overexpression was not described in human HCCs, further regulatory elements may inhibit IGF-1R enrichment *in vivo*. In addition, induction of IGFBP-3 expression by p53<sup>w</sup> but not by p53<sup>mut</sup> suggests that regulation of IGF-II bioavailability is a relevant effector mechanism of p53 in hepatocarcinogenesis (Buckbinder *et al.*, 1995).

A significant correlation between the nuclear accumulation of p53 (indicative for mutations) and β-catenin has been shown (Prange *et al.*, 2003) and several links exist between the p53 pathway and wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC cells to explain this phenomenon. Firstly, p53-induced SIAH expression may participate in the phosphorylation-independent degradation of β-catenin; however, its relevance in HCCs has not been shown until now (Matsuzawa *et al.*, 1998; Liu *et al.*, 2001a; Matsuzawa and Reed, 2001). Secondly, accumulation of β-catenin<sup>w</sup> correlates positively with a high exposure of aflatoxin B1 (Devereux *et al.*, 2001) and with mutational inactivation of p53 in HCCs (Cagatay

and Ozturk, 2002); however, a direct connection between all three parameters (aflatoxin intoxication, aflatoxin-specific G/T mutation in p53<sup>mut/249</sup> and β-catenin enrichment) has not been shown so far.

The growth inhibitory and proapoptotic properties of TGFβ in HCC cells are at least in part mediated through the dephosphorylation of p53 and subsequent activation of caspase-3. Moreover, the expression of several cell cycle regulators (cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins) are reduced (Fan *et al.*, 2004). Thus, inactivation of TGFβ signaling might be one possibility for cancer cells to bypass the TGFβ-mediated and p53-dependent growth control. A correlation between the downregulation of TβR-II and nuclear p53 has been published independently of these results (Kiss *et al.*, 1997).

### Cross-talk between different growth factor signaling pathways

As cytoplasmic downstream components of most growth factor ligand/receptor complexes (e.g., adaptor proteins, kinases, and transcription factors) are frequently utilized by more than one signaling pathway, numerous cross-talks and redundancies between these pathways exist (Figure 1). There is, for example, rising evidence that TGFβ signal transduction is mediated through Smad-independent pathways (reviewed by Derynck and Zhang, 2003); however, whether all of these functional links are of relevance in HCC cells remains to be explored. For instance, the TGFα/EGF/EGFR as well as the HGF/MET signaling axis causes phosphorylation of Smad2 potentially via MAPK (Kretzschmar *et al.*, 1999). Additional signaling molecules that have been described to interact with the canonical TGFβ/Smad signaling axis include p38-MAPK (Bakin *et al.*, 2002), Rho guanosine triphosphatases (Bhowmick *et al.*, 2001), PI3K (Bakin *et al.*, 2000)), protein phosphatase 2A (Petritsch *et al.*, 2000) and probably many more.

In HCC cells, TGFβ signaling has been reported to correlate with the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and epithelial/mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tumor growth factor β induces the expression of snail and slug, two transcription factors that induce EMT via downregulation of E-cadherin (Miyoshi *et al.*, 2004). E-cadherin reduction is considered a hallmark of EMT in hepatocarcinogenesis, leading to the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (Xu *et al.*, 2003). Consequently, in HCC cells upregulation of snail/slug correlates with the nuclear translocation of β-catenin (Giannelli *et al.*, 2005).

MET co-immunoprecipitates with EGFR in protein extracts from HCC cells but not in extracts from normal hepatocytes, suggesting a new tumor-specific cross-talk for the activation of HGF/MET signaling by the TGFα/EGFR axis (Jo *et al.*, 2000).

A potential link between the EGFR axis and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been discussed for some tumor entities (e.g., breast cancer cells; Civenni *et al.*, 2003; Musgrove, 2004). Recently published data on transgenic mice overexpressing β-catenin strengthen this

assumption, as increased β-catenin expression leads to elevated EGFR levels in hepatocytes. Moreover, immunohistological analyses show a high correlation between the expression of nuclear/cytoplasmic β-catenin and EGFR in most hepatoblastomas (Tan *et al.*, 2005).

### Therapeutic approaches

Given the relevance of growth factor signaling pathways in human hepatocarcinogenesis, it is encouraging that numerous experimental strategies aiming these targets are currently under investigation, although most of them still await preclinical and clinical testing. Some pathways offer several opportunities for specific therapeutic intervention (e.g., IGF/IGF-1R signaling with RTK inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and dominant-negative (dn) receptor isoforms), whereas other signaling cascades lack valid potential target structures until now (e.g., Wnt/FZD signaling).

#### Receptor tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors

Different types of RTK inhibitors have been shown to specifically reduce receptor signaling. In the case of IGF-mediated signal transduction, highly specific RTK inhibitors are necessary to discriminate between IGF-1R and INSR (Pautsch *et al.*, 2001) to prevent diabetogenic effects. Several highly selective inhibitors such as tyrphostins (Ohmichi *et al.*, 1993; Parrizas *et al.*, 1997; Blum *et al.*, 2000, 2003), NVP-AEW541 (Garcia-Echeverria *et al.*, 2004; Scotlandi *et al.*, 2005), NVP-ADW742 (Mitsiades *et al.*, 2004; Warshamana-Greene *et al.*, 2004, 2005) and cyclolignans (Girnita *et al.*, 2004; Vasilcanu *et al.*, 2004; Menu *et al.*, 2005) reduce the activation of IGF-1R and downstream effectors such as AKT/PKB. In vitro as well as in vivo, these substances efficiently reduce tumor cell growth, often in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (Mitsiades *et al.*, 2004; Scotlandi *et al.*, 2005).

PHA-665752 efficiently reduces MET phosphorylation and the subsequent activation of downstream effectors such as AKT/PKB, Gab-1, PLCγ and Stat3. Binding of PHA-665752 to MET results in decreased proliferation, cell motility and invasion of different types of tumor cells; in vivo administration in mice bearing tumor xenografts leads to a marked reduction of tumor volume, probably via intensive cell death (Christensen *et al.*, 2003; Hov *et al.*, 2004). SU11271, SU11274 and SU11606 block MET receptor autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, followed by a decreased activation of the adapter Gab-1. Treatment with these substances is associated with diminished cell proliferation and cell motility (Wang *et al.*, 2003; Berthou *et al.*, 2004). Lastly, SU5416 is an efficient inhibitor of several RTKs such as the VEGF receptor (VEGF-R; (Mendel *et al.*, 2000). Similarly, phosphorylation of MET and activation of ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB are reduced after treatment of HCC cells with SU5416 (Wang *et al.*, 2004).

Equally, inhibition of RTK activity involved in the TGFα/EGFR signaling cascade can be achieved. In HCC cells, ZD1839 (Iressa; Baselga and Averbuch, 2000), which has been primarily applied in lung and breast cancer efficiently reduces tumor cell growth and induces apoptosis (Hopfner *et al.*, 2004) and appears to inhibit metastatic activity of HCC cells (Ueno *et al.*, 2005). Also, OSI-774 (erlotinib; Pollack *et al.*, 1999) inhibits tumor cell growth of HCC cells based on elevated apoptosis (Huether *et al.*, 2005b). *In vivo*, these data are supported by a recently published clinical trial, which suggest a benefit of specific EGFR inhibition by the RTK inhibitor erlotinib in HCC patients (Philip *et al.*, 2005). Multiple other potent small molecule inhibitors of TGFα/EGF receptors (reviewed by Arteaga, 2003) such as GW2016 (Rusnak *et al.*, 2001) and CI-1033 (Slichenmyer *et al.*, 2001) await testing in HCC cells.

For the TGFβ signaling pathway, serine/threonine kinase inhibitors (RSTK) have been developed. The small molecule inhibitor SB-431542 blocks signal transduction of several TGFβ family members (e.g. TGFβ (Hjelmeland *et al.*, 2004) and activin (Inman *et al.*, 2002)) followed by reduced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smads and diminished TGFβ-evoked protumorigenic cellular effects (Halder *et al.*, 2005). Equally, SD-208 inhibits TGFβ-mediated migration and invasion; however, viability and proliferation are not reduced in all the tumor cell models studied so far (Hayashi *et al.*, 2004; Uhl *et al.*, 2004). Additional small molecule inhibitors of TGFβ-signaling such as SB-505124 (DaCosta Byfield *et al.*, 2004) and A-83-01 (Tojo *et al.*, 2005) have been shown to modulate TGF-family-member-mediated signaling, but the applicability of these substances for the treatment of HCC cells has not been shown so far.

The Ras/VEGF-R inhibitor BAY 43-9006 reduces proliferation and angiogenesis in different tumor cells (Lee and McCubrey, 2003). Moreover, effects of BAY 43-9006 are observed on further (receptor) tyrosine kinases such as VEGF-R2, PDGF-R, c-KIT and FLT-3 (Wilhelm *et al.*, 2004). Recently published data of a phase II clinical trial with HCC patients are very promising, as 43% of all patients experienced stable disease or tumor shrinkage (in 9%; Onxy-homepage) after treatment with BAY 43-9006.

### Other approaches

Neutralizing antibodies against IGF-1R such as alpha-IR3 (Jacobs *et al.*, 1986; Arteaga and Osborne, 1989; Kato *et al.*, 1993; Scotlandi *et al.*, 1998) and CP-751,871 (Cohen *et al.*, 2005) diminish receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent signaling owing to receptor internalization and lysosomal degradation (Hailey *et al.*, 2002; Sachdev *et al.*, 2003). dnIGF-1R isoforms with deletions in the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain such as dnIGF-1R⁹⁵⁰ and dnIGF-1R⁹⁵² (Adachi *et al.*, 2002; Min *et al.*, 2003, 2005) and also secreted isoforms like dnIGF-1R⁴⁸⁶ and dnIGF-1R⁴⁸² (Reiss *et al.*, 1998, 2001; Min *et al.*, 2003) mediate antineoplastic effects based on

the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and growth inhibition. Moreover, specific mutations in the important carboxy-terminal domain (Tyr1250 and Tyr1251) and the tyrosine kinase domain (Tyr1131, Tyr1135 and Tyr1136) reduce proliferation, tumor cell survival and migration (Gronborg *et al.*, 1993; Baserga *et al.*, 1997; Brodt *et al.*, 2001). Several investigators also employed antisense RNA and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide techniques to block IGF-1R synthesis (Trojan *et al.*, 1993; Resnicoff *et al.*, 1994, 1995; Lafarge-Frayssinet *et al.*, 1997), leading to increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation. However, an incomplete reduction of IGF-1R expression as well as unwanted effects on INSR levels have been described, which is possibly owing to the poor accessibility of the target transcripts by the oligonucleotides (Bohula *et al.*, 2003). Besides targeting the bioactivity and bioavailability of IGF-1R, several approaches are aimed to modulate the ligand (IGF-I and IGF-II) expression and bioavailability using antisense techniques (Trojan *et al.*, 1992, 1993), neutralizing antibodies (Su *et al.*, 1999; Goya *et al.*, 2004; Lund *et al.*, 2004; Miyamoto *et al.*, 2005) and induction of IGF-BPs (Martin *et al.*, 1999; Gray *et al.*, 2000; Zi *et al.*, 2000).

Several approaches for the modulation of HGF/MET signaling in various tumor entities have been published in the last years (e.g. neutralizing antibodies against HGF and MET, expression of antagonistic HGF variants (e.g. NK4), dnMET and decoy receptors; reviewed by Christensen *et al.*, 2005). Most of them clearly show antineoplastic effects on various tumor cell types *in vitro* and *in vivo* such as decreased proliferation, migration and metastasis potential. Some of these experimental approaches such as adenoviral-mediated NK4 expression (Heideman *et al.*, 2005) and antisense techniques (Chen *et al.*, 2003) have been successfully applied on HCC cells.

Therapeutic options for the modulation of the Wnt pathway are limited. Nonspecific inhibition (bystander effect) has been described for NSAIDs (aspirin and sulindac; Nath *et al.*, 2003; Boon *et al.*, 2004) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (Gleevec; Zhou *et al.*, 2003). More specific approaches may employ small molecule antagonists that reduce β-catenin interaction to its binding partners (CREB (Emami *et al.*, 2004) and TCF (Lepourcelet *et al.*, 2004)) as well as antibodies against Wnts (e.g. Wnt-1; Mikami *et al.*, 2005). Recently, synthetic β-catenin-responsive promoter constructs (CTP4) have been used for adenoviral transfer of therapeutic gene products, which allow the expression of cytotoxic proteins (e.g. diphtheria toxin A) selectively in cells with increased β-catenin transcriptional activity (Lipinski *et al.*, 2004).

Several neutralizing antibodies against TGFα/EGF receptors recognize the extracellular ligand binding domain of the molecules (Arteaga, 2003). Trastuzumab (herceptin; Harries and Smith, 2002) and 2C4 (pertuzumab; Spicer, 2004), two anti-neu/Her2/ErbB-2 antibodies efficiently block ligand binding and mediate receptor endocytosis (Arteaga, 2001). However, initial studies did not exhibit any significant benefit of this

anti-Her2/neu treatment in HCC patients (Hsu *et al.*, 2002; Xian *et al.*, 2005), which is in keeping with the lack of significant membranous Her2 expression in HCCs in one study (Prange and Schirmacher, 2001). In contrast, anti-EGFR/Her1/ErbB-1 antibodies such as cetuximab (erbitux) have recently been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis in HCC cells (Huether *et al.*, 2005a).

### Conclusions and future perspectives

Research on growth factors has made great progress over the last few years and has established the essential role and function of these signaling mechanisms in human hepatocarcinogenesis:

1. From many expression analyses in human HCCs, it has become evident that constitutive activation of growth factor signaling is extremely common. It is probably fair to state that in molecular hepatocarcinogenesis at least one of the discussed pathways has to be activated in a protumorigenic manner and that their multiple functions are indispensable for the development of the complete malignant phenotype. This hypothesis is strongly supported by several animal models. Nevertheless, future research will have to prove this hypothesis using representative HCC panels. Furthermore, it has to be tested whether the different pathways are completely redundant in terms of malignant progression and may freely compensate each other or whether certain specificities exist.

2. Constitutive activation multiple growth factor signaling pathways occurs at different levels. All the different types of changes have been observed in human HCCs, but pathway-specific patterns have appeared. Activation of IGF-II/IGFR/INSR signaling relies on increased ligand availability, whereas induction of the HGF/MET system is based on constitutive receptor activation either by overexpression or mutation. The physiological ligand HGF is of minor relevance. In contrast to this scenario, TGFβ and Wnt pathways are typically dysregulated in downstream signaling components, for example, by mutations. The reasons for these pathway-dependent differences are largely unknown so far; solving these questions is likely to offer new insights into the oncogenic mechanisms of growth factor dysregulation.

3. It has become clear that oncogenic growth factor signaling cannot be understood in the monodimensional manner of their canonical intracellular signaling pathways alone. Many different examples of cross-talk in growth factor signaling pathways with each other or with other oncogenic pathways, such as p53 or COX-2, have been demonstrated meanwhile. These connections are just beginning to unravel and will be a challenge to future functional studies and therapeutic interventions.

4. Several oncogenic dysregulations of growth factor signaling pathways offer promising therapeutic accessibility. These therapeutic interferences to date concentrate mainly on receptor kinases and may use small molecule inhibitors, inhibitory antibodies, specific chemotherapeutic agents, and even gene therapy. These approaches have entered the clinic in various other malignancies and are likely to revolutionize the currently disappointing systemic therapy of HCC in many aspects, such as neoadjuvant therapy before resection and transplantation, adjuvant therapy, and palliative treatment. The first functional studies have demonstrated the necessity to combine different approaches for optimal results and dose reduction.

Dysregulation of growth factor signaling in HCC has come a long way from a phenomenon seen as a curiosity without relevance or a reappearance of a fetal phenotype, comparable to AFP (alpha-Fetoprotein) expression, to an accepted protumorigenic mechanism worth being tackled by pharmaceutical approaches. Further surprises are likely to come.
