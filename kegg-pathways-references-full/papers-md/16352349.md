Several herpesviruses encode G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) proteins that are homologous to human chemokine receptors. In contrast to chemokine receptors, many vGPCRs signal in a ligand-independent (constitutive) manner. Such constitutive signaling is of major significance because various pathologies are associated with activating GPCR mutations. Constitutive activity of the human herpesvirus 8-encoded GPCR (ORF74), for example, is essential for its oncogenic potential to cause angioproliferative Kaposi's sarcoma-like lesions. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes four GPCRs, of which US28 and UL33 display constitutive activity in transfected, but also HCMV-infected, cells. In addition, US28 is activated by a broad spectrum of chemokines. Furthermore, both US28 and UL33 show promiscuous G-protein coupling, whereas chemokine receptors activate primarily Gi/o proteins. Thus, these vGPCRs are versatile signaling devices, reprogramming cellular signaling networks to modulate cellular function after infection. By these means, these HCMV-encoded receptors might contribute to HCMV-related pathologies.

HCMV entry into host cells requires a series of events to take place between viral and cellular proteins. Glycoproteins gB and gH residing on the virion appear to interact first with cellular heparan sulfates and then with additional host membrane proteins [3,4]. HCMV infection increases host-cell responses, such as inositol phosphate hydrolysis, cAMP production, metabolism of arachidonic acid and activation of several transcription factors, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and cAMP response element (CRE) [3]. Similar to other human β- and γ-herpesviruses, HCMV appears to have ‘pirated’ genes encoding key regulatory cellular proteins, several of which exhibit high homology to cellular G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) [5,6]. Because GPCRs are key regulators of cellular signaling, the HCMV-encoded GPCRs appear to be prime candidates for the observed increase of cellular signaling after infection. Thus, HCMV-encoded receptors can be regarded as an effective strategy of HCMV to elude the immune system, redirect cellular signaling networks, modulate cellular function and thus contribute to pathology. Studies using recombinant mouse and rat CMV strains (MCMV and RCMV, respectively) that lack GPCR-encoding genes support this hypothesis because reduced replication of the virus in salivary glands and a lower mortality in infected animals is observed [7–9].

**HCMV-encoded GPCRs**

Increasing evidence suggests that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) contributes to the onset or progression of chronic inflammation, vascular diseases and infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1]. HCMV is a widely spread β-herpesvirus, infecting 50–80% of the general population, and can persist lifelong in an asymptomatic latent form. However, primary infection or reactivation of the virus in immunocompromised hosts, such as the developing fetus, transplant recipients or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, can have severe implications and be fatal [1]. In fact, co-infection with HCMV and HIV accelerates the progression to AIDS [2].

**Evolution of HCMV-encoded GPCRs**

GPCRs have key roles in cellular (patho)-physiology by responding to a diversity of external stimuli to generate an integrated cellular response via activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, which in turn can either stimulate or inhibit the activity of a wide range of cellular effectors [10]. In addition, many GPCRs can constitutively activate intracellular signaling pathways in the absence of external stimuli [11] (Box 1). Constitutive GPCR signaling is of major patho-physiological significance because various proliferative diseases are attributed to activating GPCR mutations [12]. The constitutive activity of the human herpesvirus 8-encoded receptor ORF74, for example, appears to have an essential role in the initiation and progression of Kaposi’s sarcoma-like lesions in ORF74

Box 1. HCMV-encoded G-protein-coupled receptor US28

GPCRs constitute the largest family of membrane-associated proteins involved in regulating intracellular signaling in response to chemically diverse extracellular stimuli [10]. All GPCRs are characterized by the presence of seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices, each consisting of ~25–38 consecutive amino acid residues, linked by alternating intracellular or extracellular loops, and an extracellular N-terminus and intracellular C-terminus (Figure I).

GPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins consisting of an α-and a βγ-subunit, which stimulate effector proteins and result in the activation or inhibition of the production of various second messengers. GPCRs can spontaneously adopt at least two different conformations: an inactive conformation in which receptors do not activate G proteins, and an active conformation in which receptors do activate G proteins to initiate an intracellular response [11]. These receptor conformations exist in an equilibrium in which the inactive conformations are usually prevalent. Different classes of ligands can either stabilize the inactive receptor conformation (inverse agonists) or stabilize the active receptor conformation (agonists), resulting in decreased or increased receptor-mediated signaling, respectively. Interestingly, for some (mutant) receptors this equilibrium is shifted towards the active conformation, resulting in constitutive ligand-independent signaling, a condition that has been shown to cause pathological conditions. Currently, it is acknowledged that GPCRs bind, in addition to G proteins, GPCR-interacting proteins and multidomain scaffolding proteins that might regulate intracellular signaling and provide new ways to govern ligand recognition, signaling specificity and receptor trafficking.

**Figure I.** Two-dimensional serpentine representation of the HCMV-encoded US28 receptor, illustrating the N-terminal extracellular domain, the putative seven transmembrane helices and the C-terminal intracellular domain, as determined by amino acid alignment with the bovine rhodopsin structure. Conserved disulfide bridges present in chemokine receptors between the N-terminus and the third extracellular loop, and between the first and second extracellular loops, are indicated by filled circles and a connecting line. A conserved hexad motif present in the N-terminus of US28, and also found in CCR1, CCR2 and CX3CR1, is indicated by a grey box. The three amino acid residues (T12, F14 and Y16) within this motif that cooperatively contribute to the binding of CC-chemokines are highlighted in blue; only Y16 interacts with CX3CL1 [33]. Putative glycosylation sites are marked by a 'Y', whereas sulfation of Y16 is indicated by an exposed black circle. Acidic Glu277 (green) in transmembrane helix 7 is conserved in the majority of chemokine receptors and might represent a common interaction point for the basic region (e.g. piperidine) of non-peptide compounds acting at chemokine receptors. The constitutive activity of US28 is abrogated upon mutation of Arg129 (purple) to alanine, within the 'DRY' motif. Mutational and phosphoamino acid analyses reveal that serine residues 323 and 350 are major phosphorylation sites [54,55].

HCMV encodes four GPCRs referred to as US27, US28, UL33 and UL78 [1], which show highest homology to the family of chemokine receptors (Figure 1). Chemokine receptors are involved in the regulation of the immune system [13,14] but are also implicated in various pathological processes (e.g. inflammation, atherosclerosis and oncogenesis); furthermore, some of these receptors act as crucial cellular entry factors for HIV [15]. In view of the fundamental role of GPCRs in general, and chemokine receptors in particular, the CMV-encoded receptors might be crucial determinants in CMV pathogenesis and chronic diseases.

The GPCR-encoding gene clusters UL33 and UL78 are conserved in all sequenced CMVs, and have presumably been pirated from an ancient host by an ancestral CMV.

UL33 orthologs (M33 and R33 in MCMV and RCMV, respectively) are fairly well conserved, whereas amino acid sequences have diverged considerably among UL78 orthologs (M78 and R78 in MCMV and RCMV, respectively) [9,16–19]. Interestingly, only primate CMVs contain an additional GPCR-encoding gene cluster, which consists of two adjacent genes in human (H)CMV and chimpanzee (C)CMV (US27 and US28), and five juxtaposed genes in the rhesus macaque (Rh)CMV and African green monkey (S)CMV [16,18,19] (Figure 1). The strict human tropism of HCMV in combination with the uniqueness of two of the four HCMV-encoded GPCRs hampers the experimental analysis of their role in virulence *in vivo*. HCMV-encoded US27 and US28 proteins display highest sequence identity to the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, whereas UL33 is most similar to the chemokine receptor CCR10 (Figure 1). By contrast, UL78 has limited sequence identity to chemokine

receptors or any other GPCR, but shares some general conserved GPCR features.

Spatiotemporal expression of HCMV-encoded GPCRs HCMV enters the body naturally via epithelial cells of the upper gastrointestinal, respiratory or urogenital tracts [1], and disseminates throughout the body by latently infected monocytes in the blood (see references in [20]). Allogenic stimulation of monocytes induces their differentiation into macrophages, which in latently infected

cells is accompanied by reactivation of HCMV, leading to the release of infectious virions [20]. Viral replication in permissive cells follows a well-orchestrated sequential cascade of gene expression. The US28-and UL78- encoding genes are expressed with early kinetics and require immediate-early-protein-mediated transcriptional activation, whereas US27 and UL33 genes are transcribed with late kinetics after the onset of viral replication [21]. In addition, US28 transcripts have been detected in latently infected monocytic cells in vivo and

in vitro [22], suggesting that US28 has a prominent role in immune evasion and HCMV dissemination.

Moreover, UL33 [23], UL78 [9], US28, rhUS28.5 [24] and presumably US27 are constituents of the virion. Colocalization of US28 [25], US27 and UL33 [26] with HCMV-encoded envelope glycoproteins gB and gH on virus-wrapping membranes in transfected or HCMV-infected cells indicates that these GPCRs are incorporated in the viral envelope. Although expression of CMV-encoded GPCRs on the virion does not appear to be essential for infection of permissive cells in vitro, deletion of either R33/M33 [7,17] or R78/M78 [9,27] has a significant impact on viral dissemination in vivo.

Ligands that bind HCMV-encoded GPCRs

Despite their sequence similarity to chemokine receptors, UL33 [28] and US27 do not seem to interact with chemokines, and both receptors in addition to UL78 still need to be 'deorphanized' (i.e. their natural ligand identified). Interestingly, M33-mediated signaling was recently reported in response to mouse CCL5 [29]. By contrast, US28 binds CX3CL1 in addition to several inflammatory CC-chemokines (i.e. CCLs: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 26 and 28) [24]. The capacity of US28 to interact with a broad range of chemokines might contribute to efficient dissemination of HCMV throughout the body via migration of US28-expressing cells along multiple chemokine gradients. Moreover, adhesion of US28-expressing cells [30] and HCMV-virions [24,31] to membrane-associated CX3CL1 molecules, which are expressed on vascular endothelial cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines [32], might facilitate the extravasation of latently infected, US28-expressing monocytes into inflamed tissue [22] and viral infection of endothelial cells, respectively (Figure 2).

Chemokines bind with high affinity to the conserved hexad motif within the N-terminus of US28 [33].

**Figure 2. Putative roles of the HCMV-encoded US28 receptor. Expression of US28 on the virion envelope might facilitate viral infection by US28-mediated high-affinity binding to host-cell-expressing membrane-associated CX3CL1 (1) [24,31]. US28 modulates cellular signaling networks by constitutive (2) and/or chemokine-induced (3) activation of multiple signaling pathways by coupling to a variety of G proteins [35,42]. In addition, constitutive US28 signaling can potentiate signaling of G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors (7) [49]. US28 is constitutively phosphorylated by GRKs and internalized via AP-2 adaptor complexes (4) [25,61]. In addition, binding of β-arrestins to the phosphorylated C-terminus of US28 enables the formation of scaffolding complexes that influence activation of several signaling pathways (4) [54]. The rapid and constitutive internalization of US28 enables the sequestration of a wide variety of US28-bound inflammatory chemokines from the surroundings of HCMV-infected cells, thereby limiting the inflammatory immune response (3). The interaction between membrane-associated CX3CL1 and US28 increases the adhesion of US28-expressing monocytes to vascular endothelial cells and facilitates their extravasation (5) [22,32]. US28 induces chemokine-directed chemotaxis of vascular smooth muscle cells (6), and might be involved in the migration of these cells into the vascular intima [36,66]. Both HIV R5 and X4 strains can use US28, when coexpressed with CD4, as a co-receptor for cellular entry (8) [5], which might account for the positive synergism between HCMV and HIV pathologies.

express US 28 [35]. CCL2 and CCL5 are also able to induce migration of US28-expressing or HCMV-infected vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), providing a molecular basis for the involvement of HCMV in the progression of atherosclerosis [36]. Moreover, R33-induced vSMC migration contributes crucially to RCMV-accelerated cardiac allograft atherosclerosis and chronic rejection [37]. US28-mediated vSMC migration involves activation of Src and focal adhesion kinase [38], an important mediator of cytoskeletal rearrangement, in addition to activation of RhoA via G12/13α proteins [39]. MCMV-induced vSMC migration is mediated by M33 in response to mouse CCL5 through activation of Rac1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, 2 (ERK-1, 2) [29].

Importantly, both US28 and UL33 also alter cellular signaling, including inositol phosphate production and activation of NF-κB, CRE and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), in a constitutive manner (Figure 2), whereas host chemokine receptors do not display, or display only limited, ligand-independent signaling [28, 40–42]. This constitutive signaling is not only apparent in transfected cells but also 24–48 h after HCMV infection, as shown by impaired inositol phosphate production and activation of CRE mediated by US28 or UL33 gene knockout viruses, respectively (Figure 3). Thus, HCMV can effectively use these receptors, without the need of a ligand, to modulate multiple signaling networks via activation of effectors and transcription factors within infected cells. Importantly, the repertoire of intracellular signaling pathways activated by HCMV-encoded GPCRs (constitutively or ligand induced) is cell-type specific and dependent on the cellular signalosome.

Moreover, because both receptors reside on the virion [24], they are likely to be incorporated into the membrane immediately after viral infection, and thus constitutive activation of these pathways, early after infection, might be of pathophysiological significance. Importantly, the immediate early promoter of HCMV, constituting the genetic switch for progression of viral infection and reactivation, contains four consensus CRE-binding sites and four NF-κB-binding sites. Binding of cognate transcription factors to these sites is required for efficient transactivation of the immediate early promoter [21, 43, 44]. Moreover, NF-κB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that has a crucial role in the regulation of inducible genes involved in the immune response and inflammatory events associated with, for example, atherosclerosis [45]. NFAT is an important regulator of immune responses, developmental processes and angiogenesis [46]. US28, through constitutive activation of these transcription factors, might induce expression of viral immediate-early proteins and cellular proteins, leading to the alteration of the immune response in favor of viral survival and spreading, and thus might contribute to the onset, progression or enhancement of inflammatory disorders (Figure 2). Unexpectedly, however, US28-mediated constitutive signaling via multiple pathways does not modulate cellular gene expression significantly in HCMV-infected fibroblasts during the late phase of infection (50–98 hours post-infection) [47]. Moreover, US28 appears to activate

Reproduced, with permission, from [28]. Cellular responses in AD169- and ΔUS28-or ΔUL33-infected cells indicate that US28 is responsible for virus-induced InsP accumulation whereas UL33 is at least in part responsible for virus-induced CRE activation.

Importantly, post-translational sulfation and O-glycosylation of tyrosine and threonine residues, respectively, within this motif is essential for chemokine recognition and the binding kinetics of US28 [33] and host chemokine receptors [34].

### Versatile signaling devices
#### Ligand-induced and constitutive signaling activity via promiscuous G-protein coupling
To date, no constitutive and/or ligand-induced signaling has been reported for US27 and UL78. However, their presence on the virion either suggests a role during early stages of infection or infers modulation of cellular signaling pathways upon infection. Signaling has been reported for US28 and UL33 (Figure 2). CC chemokines, shown to bind to US28, induce increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ levels and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in cells that

pro-apoptotic signaling pathways in several cell types, providing US28 with an additional functional property [48].

Interestingly, US28-mediated constitutive signaling potentiates chemokine-induced signaling of the G<sub>i</sub>-coupled CCR1 [49] (Figure 2). Because chemokine receptors are key components in leukocytes, smooth muscle and endothelial cells, all primary sites of HCMV infection, HCMV-encoded receptor expression might alter ligand-induced signaling via these receptors and contribute to the onset of CMV pathology.

Characteristically, the CMV-encoded receptors show promiscuous G-protein coupling, whereas host chemokine receptors activate primarily G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins [10]. The constitutive activation of inositol phosphate production and NF-κB activity by US28 and UL33 involve primarily activation of G<sub>q</sub> proteins, whereas CRE-mediated gene transcription is G<sub>s</sub> dependent [28,41,42]. R33 and M33 are also able to signal in a constitutively active manner [41,50]. The constitutive signaling of R33 differs from that of UL33 because R33 is only able to couple to G<sub>i/o</sub> and G<sub>q</sub>, whereas UL33 can activate the G<sub>q</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> classes. Interestingly, CC chemokines do not modulate the constitutive signaling of US28 in the inositol phosphate, NF-κB and CRE assays [42,51]. By contrast, CX3CL1 acts as inverse agonist in these assays [42]. Surprisingly, however, the same chemokines activate these signaling pathways when US28 loses its capacity to constitutively internalize (see later), while maintaining its constitutive signaling capacity, upon deletion of its C-terminal tail [52]. Hence, differential modulation of constitutive US28 internalization kinetics determines the efficacy of chemokines that act at this receptor. This implies that the cellular context in which US28 is expressed and the presence of differentially expressed adaptor, sorting and/or scaffolding proteins that interact with the C-terminal tail can, in principle, modulate chemokine responsiveness through the regulation of US28 internalization.

Dynamic regulation of US28

Ligand-induced GPCR activation is usually followed by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor and the subsequent recruitment of β-arrestins to attenuate G-protein coupling [53]. Interestingly, the C-terminal tail of US28 is constitutively phosphorylated by GRK2 and GRK5, which attenuates G<sub>q</sub>-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) signaling [54]. By contrast, US28-mediated constitutive activation of NF-κB appears to be unaffected by receptor phosphorylation [55]. Importantly, constitutive phosphorylation of the US28 is associated with rapid, agonist-independent receptor endocytosis (Figure 2) [25,55], and is independent of constitutive signaling [52,56]. Consequently, US28 is located primarily in perinuclear endosomes. Truncation or substitution of phosphorylation sites in the US28 C-terminal tail impairs internalization and leads to increased expression in the membrane. Moreover, the constitutive endocytic property of the US28 C-tail is transposable to other GPCRs [52]. The broad chemokine binding profile in combination with rapid and constitutive internalization kinetics [25] enables US28 to sequester inflammatory chemokines efficiently from the environment of HCMV-infected cells [57–59] and might thereby reduce the recruitment of leukocytes and limit the inflammatory response (Figure 2) as recently described for the D6 chemokine decoy receptor [60]. US28 internalization is mediated via clathrin-coated vesicles and to a lesser extent via caveolae or lipid rafts, and requires the AP-2 adaptor complex and dynamin [56,61]. Interestingly, US28 internalization is independent of β-arrestins [56,61]. Nevertheless, β-arrestins are recruited to the phosphorylated US28 C-terminus and are required for maximal activation of the p38 signaling pathway [54]. Scaffolding proteins, such as G-protein-coupled-associated sorting protein (GASP) and sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), also bind the C-terminus, presumably regulating intracellular signaling and in particular receptor trafficking [62].

HCMV-encoded GPCRs: potential anti-viral drug targets?

GPCRs constitute a highly ‘druggable’ class of membrane-associated proteins and account for ~50% of protein targets for therapeutic interventions. The awareness that chemokines and their cognate receptors have a prominent role in numerous pathophysiological processes urges the quest for bioavailable small-molecule antagonists that specifically block chemokine receptor functioning [15]. The identification of non-peptide chemokine receptor antagonists is proceeding at a rapid pace, with some compounds entering Phase II or III clinical trials.

In addition to CCR5 and CXCR4, other chemokine receptors, including US28, can serve as a co-receptor for HIV-1 infection in vitro (Figure 2) (see references in [5]). Co-infection of HIV and CMV has been detected in vivo in brain cells devoid of CCR5 expression, which suggests that a direct role exists for herpesviruses and, in particular, US28 in the pathogenesis of AIDS [63].

In view of the potential roles of CMV-encoded chemokine receptor homologs in viral dissemination, redirecting intracellular signaling pathways and immune evasion (Figure 2), small non-peptide compounds that inhibit constitutive signaling of UL33 or US28 and thus act as inverse agonists and/or inhibit chemokine or HIV binding to US28 can be considered as promising therapeutics for clinical anti-viral intervention.

Recently, small non-peptide inverse agonists [e.g. VUF2274 (see Chemical names)] derived from a CCR1 antagonist {5-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-yl)-2,2-diphenylpentane-nitrile} have been identified [64,65] that dose-dependently inhibit: (i) US28-mediated constitutive activation of PLC in both transiently transfected cells and HCMV-infected fibroblasts; (ii) CCL5 binding to US28; and (iii) US28-mediated HIV entry in cells cotransfected with CD4. Importantly, VUF2274 inhibits CCL5 binding in a noncompetitive manner, thus acting as an allosteric modulator.

Future perspectives
Exploitation of the chemokine receptor system through molecular mimicry appears to be an effective means to assist viruses in evading immune surveillance, contribute to viral dissemination and receptor-mediated entry. US28 is by far the best-characterized receptor. In accordance with the ability of US28 to respond to a broad spectrum of chemokines, and the ability of US28 and UL33 to signal in a constitutively active manner, these receptors appear to be versatile signaling devices that modulate cellular signaling networks, thereby reprogramming the cellular machinery to modulate cellular function after infection. The fact that US27 and UL78 both reside within the virion implies a potential role for these receptors, either early after infection or indirectly as modulators of cellular signaling. Further research needs to be performed to reveal their role.

Although many attractive roles have been attributed to this class of receptors, little is known about their true (patho) physiological potential. The biological significance of members of the UL33 and UL78 family in the pathogenesis of CMV infections has been demonstrated in studies using recombinant rodent CMVs that carry a disrupted gene or lack the respective gene [7–9,17,27,37]. However, *in vivo* analysis of US27 and US28 is hampered by the strict higher primate tropism of the CMVs that acquired these genes. Development of adequate model systems that enable *in vivo* analyses of the (H)CMV-encoded receptors, together with the availability of vGPCR-knockout strains of (H/C)CMV and specific inhibitors [inverse agonists or small interfering RNA (siRNA)], are essential to elucidate the contribution of HCMV-encoded receptors and their constitutive activity to HCMV pathogenesis.
