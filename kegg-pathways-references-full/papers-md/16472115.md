Abstract: The primary mechanism by which mutations in Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) contribute to progressive motor neuron loss in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) remains unknown. Misfolded protein aggregates, ubiquitin-proteasome system impairment and neuronal apoptosis mediated by death receptor or mitochondrial-dependent pathways are implicated in mutant SOD1-induced toxicity. Recent evidence from cellular and transgenic rodent models of FALS proposes activation of a third apoptotic pathway linked to sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, we review the emerging role of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the pathogenesis of mutant SOD1-linked FALS. The UPR observed in FALS rodents is described which encompasses induction of key ER-resident chaperones during presymptomatic disease, leading to activation of stress transducers and pro-apoptotic molecules by late stage disease. Importantly, mutant SOD1 co-aggregates with UPR components and recruits to the ER, suggesting a direct adverse effect on ER function. By contrast, the opposing neuroprotective effects of wild-type SOD1 overexpression on UPR signalling are also highlighted. In addition, the potential impact of neuronal Golgi apparatus (GA) fragmentation and subsequent disturbances in intracellular protein trafficking on motor neuron survival in FALS is also discussed. We propose that ER stress and UPR may be coupled to GA dysfunction in mutant SOD1-mediated toxicity, promoting ER-initiated cell death signalling in FALS.

INTRODUCTION

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Charcot's disease in Europe or Lou Gehrig's disease in America, is a progressive and deadly adult-onset motor neuron disease (MND) characterised by muscle weakness, spasticity, atrophy, paralysis and premature death. The pathological hallmark of ALS is the selective degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal ventral horns, most brainstem nuclei and cerebral cortex [1]. Motor neuron loss is associated with perikaryal and neuritic neurofilament pathology, abnormal protein deposition and widespread reactive gliosis [2]. Four major proteinaceous inclusions are recognised in ALS, including ubiquitinated Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions (LBHIs), skein-like deposits, Bunina bodies and hyaline conglomerates [3]. ALS has an average age of onset around 50 years and the annual incidence is estimated at 1-2 per 100,000 individuals [4]. ALS is presently incurable with a mean survival time of 1-5 years from diagnosis, often resulting in fatal respiratory dysfunction [2].

The majority of ALS cases lack a defined hereditary genetic component and are considered sporadic (SALS), while approximately 10% of cases are familial (FALS). A further subtype of SALS is Guamanian-ALS parkinsonism-dementia-complex or endemic ALS affecting ethnic minorities [5]. The etiology of SALS is linked to neurotropic viruses,

autoimmunity, environmental neurotoxins and neurofilament gene deletions [5]. In FALS, at least 12 genetic loci have been discerned by linkage analysis, involving autosomal dominant, recessive and X-linked dominant inheritance, with juvenile and adult-onset. At present, 6 disease causative genes have been identified including Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), alsin (ALS2), senataxin (SETX), vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAPB), tau (MAPT) and the p150 subunit of dynactin (DCTN1) [6]. Around 20% of FALS cases are attributed primarily to dominant heterozygous mutations in SOD1, a ubiquitously expressed 153-residue enzyme that catalyses the antioxidant reaction 2·O₂⁻ + 2H⁺ → H₂O₂ + O₂ [6]. Over 100 mutations including missense substitutions and C-terminal truncating frameshift deletions or insertions in SOD1 are currently known [6]. FALS-linked SOD1 variants exhibit divergent enzymic activities in vitro, ranging from zero to full specific-activity, suggesting that loss-of-function may not account for neurotoxicity [7]. As further evidence, mice genetically deficient for SOD1 develop normally without obvious motor abnormalities [8]. However, it should be emphasised that aged SOD1 knockout mice were hypersensitive to axotomy-induced degeneration and developed peripheral hindlimb axonopathy with skeletal muscle denervation and subtle motor deficits [8,9]. Thus, SOD1 is implicated in preservation, but not survival of hindlimb neuromuscular synapses, suggesting that loss-of-function may still be relevant to FALS pathogenesis [9].

In contrast, the overexpression of human FALS-linked SOD1 mutations in transgenic mice provoked

age-dependent paralysis and motor neuron degeneration [10]. At present, 14 transgenic mouse and 2 rat models based on overexpression of different SOD1 mutants exist. Despite variation in SOD1 transgene copy number, expression levels, biochemistry, activity and neuropathology, all models develop stereotyped FALS syndromes with different disease latencies and progression rates. Transgenic SOD1G93A mice and rats represent the foremost models used in FALS research [10, 11]. Importantly, these transgenic FALS rodents provide convincing evidence for a neurotoxic gain-of-function property of mutant SOD1, distinct from wild-type SOD1 overexpression which does not induce clinical MND [10].

Oxidants and Oligomers in Mutant SOD1-Mediated Toxicity

Although currently unresolved, two prevailing theories of mutant SOD1-mediated toxicity are enhanced copper-catalysed pro-oxidative chemistry and abnormal protein aggregation [2,6]. Despite variation in dismutase activity, a subset of SOD1 mutants exhibit increased peroxidase, nitrosative and reverse dismutase reactions in vitro [12, 13]. However the contribution of these reactions to neuropathology in transgenic FALS rodents is debated. In contrast, accumulation of abnormal misfolded mutant SOD1 aggregates is a salient feature of spinal cords from humans, transgenic mice and rats with FALS [11, 14]. Aggregates range from biochemically distinct detergent-insoluble oligomerised SOD1 species to large cytoplasmic inclusions immunoreactive for SOD1 present in motor neurons (LBHI) and glial cells [14, 15]. Mutant SOD1 aggregates also arise early in transgenic FALS mice and their abundance correlates with disease progression, suggesting a possible pathogenic role [15]. Potential cellular targets of aggregated SOD1 may include the proteasome, chaperones, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)- Golgi system as discussed later.

Mutant SOD1 aggregates are modified by ubiquitinating enzymes such as dorfin and the C- terminus of heat shock cognate protein 70 kDa- interacting protein, also known as CHIP, and undergo proteasomal-mediated degradation [16, 17]. However, mutant SOD1 induces proteasomal dysfunction in vitro [18] and in transgenic FALS mice, by inhibiting chymotrypsin-, trypsin- and caspase-like activities of the proteasome [19], suggesting that ubiquitin-proteasome system impairment may contribute to disease. Lastly, expression of a dominant-negative ubiquitin variant in transgenic SOD1G93A mice was modestly protective against disease progression [20]. Additional proposed mechanisms of toxicity in FALS include glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, defective axonal transport and neuroinflammation [2, 6]. An emerging role for pro-inflammatory processes, particularly from reactive

microglia, suggests a non-cell autonomous component in mutant SOD1-induced neurodegeneration [2].

Extrinsic and Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathways are Recruited in FALS

There is general consensus that programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis participates in motor neuron degeneration in FALS, at least in transgenic mutant SOD1 mice [21]. Evidence for both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways exists in FALS. The extrinsic or death receptor pathway is activated by ligand binding to cell surface receptors including Fas/CD95 and tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), inducing caspase-8 activation. The extrinsic pathway unites with the intrinsic pathway below via pro-apoptotic Bid cleavage and executioner caspase activation [21]. Fas/CD95 receptor stimulated caspase-8 activation was reported in motor neuron cultures from multiple transgenic SOD1 mouse models [22]. Induction of TNFR1 and p75 neurotrophin receptor expression was also described in transgenic SOD1G93A mouse spinal cords, however the downstream signalling events were not investigated or modulated in the context of FALS [23, 24]. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is mobilised in response to intracellular stress including trophic factor deprivation, DNA damage and protein unfolding. Stress signals are propagated through interactions of Bcl-2 family members including pro-apoptotic Bax and anti- apoptotic Bcl-2 which lead to disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and release of apoptogenic factors. These factors including cytochrome-c induce the caspase machinery and promote cell death [21]. Decreased Bcl-2 to Bax ratio, cytosolic cytochrome-c release, upstream caspase-1, -8 and -9 cleavage, as well as effector caspase-3, -7 and Bid activation was documented in spinal cords of transgenic mutant SOD1 mice [25-28]. Recent data also suggests that a second intrinsic pro-apoptotic pathway originating from the ER may contribute to FALS neurodegeneration which is the focus of this review.

The ER is the first compartment of the secretory pathway associated with protein synthesis, post- translational folding and modification. Aside from processing secretory and plasma membrane targeted proteins, the ER also regulates calcium storage and signalling, functions critical for resident calcium-dependent molecular chaperones [29]. Perturbations in ER calcium homeostasis or protein folding capacity result in a pathological state termed “ER stress” which activates two adaptive pathways known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). These pathways have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [29-31]. Briefly, UPR is induced when the ER luminal chaperone 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein/immunoglobulin binding protein (Grp78/Bip) dissociates from transmembrane stress sensors to engage newly synthesised unfolded or misfolded proteins. Three

major stress transducers, namely PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), subsequently activate and signal downstream molecular events to alleviate ER stress (Fig. 1). PERK phosphorylates and inactivates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) which represses global protein biosynthesis. IRE1 activation leads to alternative processing and subsequent synthesis of spliced X box protein 1 (XBP1-s) mRNA which is a strong transcription factor that upregulates UPR proteins necessary for ER expansion and chaperone expression. Lastly, ATF6 migrates to the Golgi apparatus (GA) where it is cleaved and further transported to the nucleus to upregulate ER-resident chaperone expression. All three signal transduction pathways also contribute to retrotranslocation of misfolded polypeptides to the proteosome via ERAD [29-31].

However, persistent protein misfolding and UPR initiates pro-apoptotic signalling mechanisms. eIF2α upregulates proteins such as ATF4 which induce growth arrest and DNA damage inducible proteins 34 (GADD34) and 153 (GADD153), the latter also known as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Although GADD34 dephosphorylates eIF2α and relieves translational arrest, reactivation of general protein synthesis during UPR may compound ER

stress, inducing oxidation and cell death [32]. CHOP expression enhances cell apoptosis by redistributing Bcl-2 and Bax as one of its functions, while c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase-12 are also recruited in ER stress [31]. Caspase-9 and -3 are sequentially activated by caspase-12 independent of mitochondrial cytochrome-c [30]. Increasing evidence suggests that ER stress-induced apoptosis may underlie many acute or chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and prion diseases [29]. Thus, ER stress-initiated PCD may present an alternative therapeutic target to classic mitochondrial pathways in these neurological diseases.

Mutant SOD1 Induces ER Expansion and Stress in Culture

Morphological and ultrastructural ER abnormalities are well documented in human patients and transgenic mice with ALS [33,34]. Abnormal ER dilation and recruitment into granular cytoplasmic aggregates was also reported in COS-7 cells expressing mutant SOD1 [35,36]. However, recent evidence indicates that the ER may be a critical determinant of SOD1 aggregation and toxicity. Mutant SOD1 induced and co-localised with Grp78 in

Fig. (1). Overview of molecular pathways underlying ER stress and UPR. In conditions of high protein load or misfolding within cells, the ER-resident chaperone Grp78 detaches from stress transducers, activating UPR signalling cascades. Activation of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 collectively leads to global translational attenuation with selective upregulation of gene expression for foldases, ER biogenesis and ERAD to alleviate stress. However, prolonged UPR leads to recruitment of pro-apoptotic molecules including CHOP, JNK and caspase-12, mediating the intrinsic PCD pathway in concert with mitochondrial caspases.

transfected fibroblasts, implying that SOD1 aggregates in the vicinity of the ER [36]. Interestingly, artificial ER retention of either wild-type or mutant SOD1 induced profound protein oligomerisation in cultured Neuro2A cells [37], suggesting that the ER environment is conducive to SOD1 aggregation when overexpression of protein occurs. Importantly, evidence for UPR signalling via phospho eIF2α, spliced XBP1 mRNA and ATF6 translocation leading to JNK and caspase-12 activation was also reported in Neuro2A cells transfected with mutant SOD1 [38]. Recently, the caspase activation cascade was characterised in a motor neuron cell line stably expressing SOD1 mutations [39]. Caspase-3, -8 and -9, but not caspase-12, were differentially cleaved in mutant SOD1 transfectants under basal or oxidative conditions. However, the presence of ER stress was not evaluated in parallel with caspase-12 activation and remains to be identified in this cell culture model.

ER Stress and UPR in Transgenic FALS Rodents

There is mounting evidence for ER stress in transgenic rodents chronically expressing different FALS-related SOD1 mutations. Presymptomatic upregulation of Grp78 was initially reported in spinal motor neurons of transgenic SOD1H46R and SOD1L84V mice [36]. However, this finding was not reproduced in transgenic SOD1G93A mice even at paralysis [40], despite the similar disease parameters between these three models. Recent observations suggest that Grp78 associates intimately with neuronal protein deposits in transgenic SOD1G93A mice, in contrast to whole spinal cord induction measured in the former study [41]. Grp78 co-localised with SOD1-immunoreactive LBHIs, non-classic eosinophilic deposits and neuritic inclusions in spinal motor neurons, implying a possible interaction with mutant SOD1 [41]. We recently screened transgenic SOD1G93A rodents for ER stress markers in spinal cords. Preliminary results suggest upregulation of numerous UPR elements occurs at disease endstage in these animals (Atkin et al. unpublished data). Further evidence for activation of all three major UPR components, particularly IRE1-mediated XBP1 mRNA processing and JNK phosphorylation, was documented in transgenic SOD1G93A rodents [42].

Support for ER stress-induced apoptosis is presently conflicting in transgenic FALS rodents. CHOP expression levels were originally reported as unchanged in spinal cords of transgenic SOD1G93A mice by immunoblot analysis [40]. However, a recent immunohistochemical study of the same model revealed CHOP induction in spinal motor neurons at disease onset, co-incident with ATF3 and phospho c-Jun expression [43]. ATF3 is induced downstream of ATF4 and regulates GADD34 and CHOP synthesis [31]. Regarding caspases, Przedborski and colleagues first proposed that caspase-12 expression was increased in degenerating motor neurons of transgenic FALS mice [44]. Caspase-12

induction and activation was later confirmed in spinal cords of transgenic SOD1G93A mice, co-incident with caspase-9 and -3 cleavage prior to disease onset [40]. However, a second study failed to document increased cleaved caspase-12 at various time points in the same mouse model [39]. Furthermore, the relevance of caspase-12 mediated apoptosis in mutant SOD1-linked FALS has been questioned due to lack of functional putative human caspase-12 [45, 46]. However, the precise human orthologue of murine caspase-12 has not been adequately described and alternate ER-localised caspase-4 may substitute in humans [47]. Ultimately, the generation of transgenic FALS mice on CHOP or caspase-12 null genetic backgrounds [48, 49] may help resolve these issues.

Overexpression of Wild-Type SOD1 Opposes ER Stress Signalling

In addressing the role of ER stress in the pathogenesis of transgenic FALS mice, it is important to discriminate the effects of SOD1 mutation from protein overexpression on UPR induction. This is best illustrated by rodent stroke models where transgenic overexpression of wild-type SOD1 actually counters ER stress. In a mouse model of focal brain ischemia, wild-type SOD1 elevation partially suppressed PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation, Grp78 detachment from stress sensors and rescued striatal neurons from degeneration [50, 51]. Furthermore, basal GADD34 protein levels were decreased in transgenic wild-type SOD1 rat brain with implications for post-ischemic translational recovery [52]. Thus, reactive oxygen species catalysed by wild-type SOD1 may be important mediators of ischemia-induced ER dysfunction [29]. These studies suggest that overexpressed wild-type and mutated SOD1 induce differential effects on the ER. Although the misfolded conformation of SOD1 mutants most likely elicits UPR, oxidant stress generated by select mutants within the ER may also contribute to GADD34 post-translational regulation and cell death.

GA Fragmentation is a Hallmark Feature of ALS Neurodegeneration

Like the ER, regressive changes in GA structure are also reported in ALS. Gonatas and researchers first implicated a role for the GA in the pathogenesis of chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS [53]. Fragmented and atrophic GA are consistently reported in spinal motor neurons of SALS, mutant SOD1-linked FALS and endemic ALS individuals [53-55]. Despite the emergence of similar GA pathology in other neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and tauopathy [56], GA fragmentation remains a characteristic feature of all major clinical ALS subtypes attributed to diverse etiologies. Importantly, lesions of the GA were detected in spinal motor neurons of presymptomatic transgenic SOD1G93A mice, suggesting that the GA

ER Stress and UPR in FALS

is targeted early in disease progression [57]. The relationship between mutant SOD1 aggregation and GA fragmentation is unclear, specifically whether soluble, aggregated or ubiquitinated SOD1 is a causal factor [58, 59]. However, cytoskeletal derangement due to the accumulation of perikaryal neurofilament heavy subunits has been ruled out [60], although depletion of microtubule-associated proteins such as stathmin may have a role in GA pathology in transgenic FALS mice [56].

GA fragmentation may lead to functional impairment of intracellular protein trafficking essential for secretion and axonal transport [57]. Transfection of CHO cells with mutant SOD1 induced GA dispersion and dysfunction of the secretory pathway, as measured by attenuated cell surface expression of CD4 [61]. GA disruption was also described in primary motor neuron cultures expressing SOD1 mutations and linked to dynein mislocalisation, predicting defects in retrograde transport [62]. We recently confirmed GA fragmentation in the well established NSC-34 motor neuron cell line transfected with mutant SOD1 (Fig. 2). In contrast to untransfected or wild-type SOD1 transfected cells, the normal perinuclear GA structure was disrupted by mutant SOD1 expression. Notably, SOD1 co-localised with the trans-Golgi network protein GCC88, suggesting a putative involvement in the GA pathway.

A Potential Role for SOD1 Secretion in FALS Pathogenesis

Based on the evidence of neuronal GA and secretory pathway dysfunction in FALS, we recently hypothesised that secretion of mutant SOD1 may be relevant to neurotoxicity [63]. Despite the designation of SOD1 as an intracellular enzyme, Mondola and colleagues first demonstrated secretion of SOD1 into the culture medium from human fibroblast, hepatocyte, thymus and neuroblastoma cell lines [64-66]. Pharmacological inhibition of cellular SOD1 release was achieved using brefeldin-A (BFA) which disrupts ER to Golgi transport, but not methylamine which blocks unconventional protein secretion via endosomes [67]. However, SOD1 was localised to microvesicles characteristic of other non-classically secreted proteins, despite the inhibitory effects of BFA [67]. Furthermore, the mechanism of SOD1 export without an overt signal peptide remains unclear. We found that numerous FALS-linked SOD1 variants were secreted in vitro by NSC-34 cell transfectants. Consistent with GA abnormalities in these cells reported above, secretion of mutant SOD1 was impaired relative to wild-type enzyme, correlating with intracellular SOD1 aggregate burden and cytotoxicity [63]. Furthermore, BFA treatment exacerbated mutant SOD1-induced toxicity while artificial extracellular targeting of mutant SOD1 restored cell survival [63]. New evidence suggests that mutated SOD1 binds neurosecretory chromogranins to facilitate export, triggering microgliosis and potential motor neuron demise in conditioned culture medium experiments [68]. Thus, extracellular action of secreted SOD1 mutants interacting with chromogranins on glia may also influence motor neuron degeneration in FALS, consistent with a propagating mechanism for non-cell autonomous toxicity. However, the role of chromogranin-mediated secretion in vivo is unclear in ALS, since depletion of chromogranin A [69] and GA markers [53] occurs in affected spinal motor neurons, indicative of compromised secretory function [61, 63].

ER Stress and GA Fragmentation Occurs in Non SOD1-Linked ALS Models

It is noteworthy that ER stress and GA pathology also occur in neurotoxin-based models of SALS, suggesting a potential wider relevance in ALS pathophysiology. In a mixed spinal cell culture model of BFA toxicity, selective motor neuron death was linked to UPR and ER stress-induced apoptosis [70]. Acute BFA exposure induced fragmented GA, Grp78 expression, eIF2α phosphorylation and caspase-12 activation in spinal neurons. In a chick model of chronic excitotoxicity, ER and GA structural pathology developed early and conspicuously in spinal motor neurons [71]. In ovo administration of NMDA provoked abnormal protein retention and aggregation within the ER, although a typical UPR mediated by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and Grp94 was lacking [71]. These results suggest that the ER-Golgi system is targeted early in the degenerative cascade of motor neurons in ALS. Furthermore, disparate mechanisms including excitotoxicity and mutant SOD1 aggregation appear to converge on ER stress induction.

CONCLUSIONS

The mechanism of selective motor neuron degeneration in FALS is poorly understood. However, contribution from death receptor, mitochondrial and ER stress-dependent apoptotic pathways seems likely. Disturbances in organelles of the secretory pathway, including the ER-Golgi

Secretory pathway function is maintained in the presence of wild-type SOD1 which is exported from the cell to subserve extracellular physiological roles (left). In FALS, mutant SOD1 interacts with the GA, inducing fragmentation by an unclear mechanism possibly involving microtubule disruption, resulting in enhanced retrograde protein transport to the ER (right). Mutant SOD1-induced impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and ERAD may also contribute to ER protein accumulation. SOD1 uptake by the ER triggers aggregation, chaperone binding and UPR induction, leading to transduction of apoptotic signals that may contribute to motor neuron degeneration.

system, are early features of mutant SOD1-mediated toxicity. We propose an integration of ER stress, UPR and GA dysfunction in mutant SOD1-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 3). GA fragmentation promoted by mutant SOD1 may slow secretory protein trafficking, leading to increased retrograde flow of Golgi-associated membranes and proteins including mutant SOD1 into the ER. Subsequent accumulation of misfolded SOD1 and impaired retrotranslocation due to proteasomal inhibition may induce aggregation and binding to ER-resident chaperones such as Grp78, launching UPR signalling pathways ultimately leading to apoptosis. Future experimental manipulation of UPR and ERAD components in mutant SOD1 models using transgenic and knockout intercrosses, as well as knockdown technologies is therefore essential to determine the significance of ER stress-initiated PCD in FALS. Based on these outcomes, we speculate several potential therapeutic strategies targeting ER stress in FALS. Pharmacological induction or activation of endogenous ER-resident chaperones or administration of chemical foldases may counter mutant SOD1 aggregate burden. Furthermore, anti-apoptotic agents and caspase inhibitors targeting ER-related PCD may have therapeutic value. Finally, extracellular administration of secretory proteins affected by GA fragmentation and presumably deficient in FALS, including wild-type SOD1 as previously tested in transgenic SOD1G93A rats [63], may also provide some positive benefit.
