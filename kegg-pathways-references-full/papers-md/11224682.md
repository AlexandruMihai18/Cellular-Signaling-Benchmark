Chetan E. Chitnis, PhD

The invasion of erythrocytes by malaria parasites is a multi-step process that requires a series of highly specific molecular interactions. Here, the authors review what has been learned about receptor-ligand interactions that mediate erythrocyte invasion. Parasite proteins involved in these interactions are promising candidates for malaria vaccines. Clear understanding of these interactions is important for the rational design of vaccines that attempt to inhibit invasion and prevent malaria.

Erythrocyte invasion by malaria parasites is a multi-step process. After the initial interaction with an erythrocyte, which can take place on any part of the merozoite surface, the merozoite reorients itself so that its apical end faces the erythrocyte. After apical reorientation, an irreversible junction develops between the apical surface of the merozoite and the erythrocyte, and apical organelles such as the rhoptries and micronemes discharge their contents to create an invagination in the erythrocyte surface. As the merozoite moves into this invagination, the junction at the apical end transforms into a circumferential ring that moves around the merozoite and pinches closed behind the merozoite when invasion is complete. Here, we will review what has been learned about the molecular interactions that mediate this complex process and discuss implications for the development of vaccines that attempt to block invasion and prevent malaria.

**Erythrocyte receptors used for invasion**

The human malaria parasite, *Plasmodium vivax*, and the simian malaria parasite, *P. knowlesi*, are completely dependent on interaction with the Duffy blood group antigen for invasion of human erythrocytes [1,2]. Electron-microscopy studies have shown that when *P. knowlesi* merozoites interact with Duffy negative erythrocytes, the initial interaction and apical reorientation take place normally but a junction does not develop and invasion does not proceed [3]. *P. knowlesi* and, by analogy, *P. vivax* thus use the Duffy antigen as a receptor for junction formation during invasion. The Duffy blood group antigen is a 38-kD glycoprotein with seven putative transmembrane segments and 66 extracellular amino acids at the N-terminus [4]. The binding site for *P. vivax* and *P. knowlesi* has been mapped to a 35-amino-acid segment of the extracellular region at the N-terminus of the Duffy antigen [5].

The Duffy antigen serves as a receptor for a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines that includes the chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8), melanoma growth stimulating activity, monocyte chemotactic peptide-1, and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted [6]. The chemokines IL-8 and melanoma growth stimulating activity inhibit invasion of Duffy positive human erythrocytes by *P. knowlesi* with 50% inhibition achieved at nanomolar concentration in in vitro invasion assays [6]. These data illustrate the feasibility of

inhibiting invasion by blocking the critical step of junction formation during invasion.

Unlike *P. vivax* and *P. knowlesi*, *P. falciparum* does not use the Duffy antigen as a receptor for invasion. Initial studies identified sialic acid residues of glycoprotein A as invasion receptors for *P. falciparum* [7-9]. A 175-kD *P. falciparum* sialic acid binding protein, also known as EBA-175, binds sialic acid residues on glycoprotein A during invasion [10]. EBA-175 does not bind En(a-) erythrocytes, which lack glycoprotein A but retain glycoprotein B as well as other sialo-glycoproteins. This implies that both sialic acid residues and the peptide backbone of glycoprotein A are required for binding [11]. A 63-amino-acid tryptic glycopeptide from the extracellular region of glycoprotein A, which blocks binding of EBA-175 to human erythrocytes, serves as the binding site [11]. It is unknown whether EBA-175 makes contact with the peptide backbone of glycoprotein A or whether the peptide backbone is needed to present sialic acid residues in the correct conformation for binding.

Unlike *P. vivax*, which is completely dependent on a single receptor for invasion, *P. knowlesi* and *P. falciparum* use multiple invasion pathways. *P. knowlesi* invades chymotrypsin-treated rhesus erythrocytes that have lost the Duffy antigen, indicating that *P. knowlesi* can use Duffy-independent invasion pathways [12]. *P. falciparum* can also use multiple invasion pathways and is not completely dependent on sialic acid residues of glycoprotein A [13-16]. Some *P. falciparum* laboratory strains use sialic acid residues on alternative sialo-glycoproteins—such as glycoprotein B—as invasion receptors [16]. Others invade neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes using sialic acid–independent receptors [16]. A study using *P. falciparum* isolates collected from patients with malaria showed that field isolates commonly use alternative invasion pathways independent of sialic acid residues of glycoprotein A [17•]. The use of multiple invasion pathways may provide *P. falciparum* with a survival advantage when faced with host immune responses or receptor heterogeneity in host populations.

## Parasite proteins that bind erythrocyte receptors during invasion

### Erythrocyte binding protein family

Parasite proteins that bind erythrocyte receptors during invasion belong to the erythrocyte binding protein family (EBP family) (Fig. 1). The EBP family includes *P. vivax* and *P. knowlesi* Duffy binding proteins (PvDBP and PkDBP), *P. knowlesi* β and γ proteins, which bind Duffy-independent receptors on rhesus erythrocytes, and *P. falciparum* EBA-175 [18-22]. The extracellular region of each EBP contains two conserved cysteine-rich domains, regions II and VI, which contain conserved cysteines and hydrophobic amino acids.

Bar diagrams represent various protein families found in apical organelles of *Plasmodium* species merozoites that mediate erythrocyte invasion. Noteworthy features such as signal peptides; transmembrane domains; and conserved cysteine-rich regions are marked with different patterns as indicated.

residues (Fig. 1). *P. falciparum* EBA-175 contains a tandem duplication (F1 and F2) of the N-terminal, cysteine-rich region (Fig. 1). The functional receptor-binding domain of each EBP maps to region II. Region II of PvDBP binds the human Duffy antigen, region II of PkDBP binds both human and rhesus Duffy antigens, *P. knowlesi* β region II binds sialic acid residues on rhesus erythrocytes and *P. knowlesi* γ region II binds as yet unidentified Duffy-independent receptors on rhesus erythrocytes [22, 23•]. *P. knowlesi* β and γ proteins may be responsible for the Duffy-independent invasion pathways of *P. knowlesi*. In the case of *P. falciparum* EBA-175, region F2 binds sialic acid residues on human glycoprotein A [11]. EBA-175 paralogues may mediate sialic acid–glycoprotein A-independent invasion pathways of *P. falciparum*. *P. falciparum* genes encoding EBA-175 paralogues have been identified, but EBA-175 binding to sialic acid–glycoprotein A-independent receptors has not been explicitly demonstrated [24, 25•].

It is important to understand the structural basis for the interaction of EBPs with host receptors. Regions containing binding residues have been mapped within binding domains of PvDBP and *P. knowlesi* β protein, which contain approximately 350 amino acids with 12 conserved cysteines. Chimeric binding domains containing stretches of *P. vivax* region II fused to stretches of *P. knowlesi* β region II were expressed on the surface of mammalian cells and tested in erythrocyte binding assays [23•]. Binding residues for the Duffy antigen map to a 170-amino-acid stretch between the fourth and
seventh cysteines of *P. vivax* region II and binding residues for sialic acid map to a 53-amino-acid stretch between the fourth and fifth cysteines of *P. knowlesi* β region II [23•]. It remains to be seen if binding residues of other EBPs also map to similar regions.

EBPs are localized in micronemes and have not been detected on the surface of merozoites [18, 20]. Invasion studies using another Apicomplexan parasite, *Toxoplasma gondii*, showed that discharge of microneme proteins such as MIC2 is regulated by cytoplasmic free Ca²⁺ [26•]. Discharge of MIC2 to the apical surface of *T. gondii* tachyzoites was triggered by Ca²⁺ ionophores, while chelation of intracellular Ca²⁺ prevented release. Initial interaction of *Plasmodium* merozoites with an erythrocyte may trigger the release of EBPs to the merozoite surface from micronemes by a similar signaling event. Such a strategy would limit exposure of EBPs to host antibodies and provide a survival advantage to the parasite.

The ability to transfect malaria parasites has provided a powerful tool for functional analysis of parasite genes. Replacement of the EBA-175 gene with a mutant copy encoding truncated EBA-175 lacking region VI and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments has no effect on localization of EBA-175 in micronemes [27, 28]. Disruption of the EBA-175 gene in the *P. falciparum* strain, Dd2/NM, which uses sialic acid–independent invasion pathways, has no effect on invasion or growth rates [27•]. However, when the EBA-175 gene is disrupted in the *P. falciparum* strain W2Mef, which is dependent on sialic acid residues on glycophorin A, invasion by this pathway is disrupted, implying loss of function [28•]. *P. falciparum* W2Mef transfectants expressing truncated EBA-175 use a sialic acid–independent invasion pathway, demonstrating that *P. falciparum* can switch to alternative invasion pathways. The ability to switch to alternative invasion pathways may allow *P. falciparum* to escape intervention strategies that target EBA-175.

Region II of EBA-175 and PvDBP have been expressed as secreted proteins in insect cells using baculoviral vectors [29–31]. The recombinant binding domains are functional in that they bind erythrocytes with the correct specificity. Antibodies directed against region II of PvDBP block the binding of PvDBP to erythrocytes, and antibodies to region II of EBA-175 inhibit the invasion of erythrocytes by *P. falciparum* in vitro, providing support for their development as malaria vaccines [31–33]. Antibodies to EBA-175 inhibit invasion by *P. falciparum* strains that use alternative, sialic acid–glycophorin A-independent invasion pathways [33]. It is not clear if antibodies directed against EBA-175 region II inhibit alternative invasion pathways by steric hindrance after binding to EBA-175 at the apical surface or if they cross-react with EBA-175 homologues that mediate alternative invasion pathways. Because immune pressure may select for variants with an EBA-175 gene deletion, a vaccine based on EBA-175 will be effective if the latter is true.

### MAEBL

Attempts to identify genes encoding EBP homologues from rodent malaria parasites led to the discovery of a related protein family called MAEBL from *P. yoelii* and *P. berghei* [34, 35]. MAEBL has a chimeric character in that it contains domains found in two different protein families (Fig. 1). The carboxyl end of MAEBL contains a cysteine-rich domain homologous to region VI of EBPs, and the N-terminal end contains paired duplicated cysteine-rich domains, M1 and M2, that share homology with *P. falciparum* apical merozoite antigen-1 (AMA-1). Domains M1 and M2 bind mouse erythrocytes [35]. MAEBL can be detected in the rhoptries early in schizogeny. It is also seen evenly distributed on the surface of mature merozoites in late-stage schizonts [36, 37]. This pattern of localization and the fact that regions M1 and M2 of MAEBL bind erythrocytes suggest that MAEBL plays a role in invasion, possibly in the initial interaction with erythrocytes prior to apical reorientation and junction formation. It may be useful to include binding domains of *P. falciparum* and *P. vivax* MAEBL homologues in a blood-stage malaria vaccine.

### Reticulocyte binding proteins from *Plasmodium vivax* and related rhoptry proteins from *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium oelii*

*P. vivax* preferentially invades reticulocytes. Two *P. vivax* reticulocyte-binding proteins (PvRBP-1 and PvRBP-2) that preferentially bind reticulocytes have been identified [38]. The reticulocyte binding proteins, PvRBP-1 and PvRBP-2, are localized at the apical surface of *P. vivax* merozoites and may be responsible for recognition of reticulocytes by *P. vivax* during invasion. The Duffy antigen is expressed on the surface of mature erythrocytes as well as reticulocytes, which account for only ~1% of the total erythrocyte population. An irreversible junction forms only when an invading *P. vivax* merozoite encounters a reticulocyte. Binding of PvRBP-1 and PvRBP-2 to receptors on reticulocytes may serve as the signal for translocation of PvDBP from the micronemes to the merozoite surface. *P. falciparum* PvRBP-2 orthologues, referred to as PfRBP2-Ha and PfRBP2-Hb, have been identified [39]. Like PvRBP-2, the *P. falciparum* orthologues are also localized at the apical surface of merozoites and may bind erythrocyte receptors to mediate invasion.

A large family of closely related, high molecular weight (~235 kD) *P. yoelii* rhoptry proteins collectively knownas the p235 family share homology with PvRBP-2 [40, 41] (Fig. 1). Each *P. yoelii* genome has as many as 50 copies of p235 rhoptry protein genes. Members of the p235 family bind mouse erythrocytes [42, 43]. Moreover, immunization with p235 and passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies directed against p235 limits *P. yoelii* infection to reticulocytes and protects mice from death upon challenge with the lethal *P. yoelii* YM strain, suggesting a role for the p235 family of proteins in erythrocyte invasion [44, 45]. Transcriptional studies using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on individual merozoites isolated from a single schizont have demonstrated that individual merozoites derived from the same *P. yoelii* schizont express distinct members of the p235 family [46•]. Individual merozoites released from the same schizont thus express different p235 proteins. Each p235 protein may have unique receptor-binding specificity. This unique method of clonal phenotypic variation allows a schizont to produce a set of merozoites, each possessing a unique antigenic character as well as a unique receptor-binding ability. Such a mechanism may allow the parasite to escape host immune responses or provide a survival advantage if faced with receptor-heterogeneity in host populations. Similar mechanisms for clonal phenotypic variation have not yet been found either in *P. falciparum* or *P. vivax*.

### Other parasite proteins localized in apical organelles involved in erythrocyte invasion

Apical merozoite antigen-1 (AMA-1), one of the well-characterized rhoptry proteins involved in invasion, is a leading malaria vaccine candidate. Sequence analysis of AMA-1 from different primate and rodent malaria parasites reveals the presence of 16 conserved cysteine residues. The pattern of disulfide linkages formed by these cysteine residues in *P. falciparum* AMA-1 has been experimentally determined [47]. Based on the pattern of disulfide linkages, AMA-1 can be divided into three domains (Fig. 1). As discussed earlier, regions M1 and M2, the N-terminal cysteine-rich regions of MAEBL, share homology with the first two domains of AMA-1 [35] (Fig. 1). Whereas domains M1 and M2 of MAEBL bind erythrocytes, there is no direct evidence yet for binding of AMA-1 to erythrocytes. AMA-1 is detected in the rhoptries of mature merozoites in late-stage schizonts. AMA-1 is proteolytically processed at the time of schizont rupture, and its subcellular distribution changes so that it is evenly distributed over the merozoite surface [48–50]. Antibodies directed against AMA-1 inhibit erythrocyte invasion, and immunization with purified AMA-1 provides protection against parasite challenge [51–53]. It has not been possible to knock out the *P. falciparum* AMA-1 gene using gene-replacement methods. This suggests that it plays a critical, nonredundant role in

invasion, validating its inclusion in a blood-stage malaria vaccine [54].

Two other rhoptry-associated proteins from *P. falciparum*, referred to as RAP-1 and RAP-2, are involved in erythrocyte invasion [55, 56]. Antibodies to RAP-1 immunoprecipitate RAP-1, RAP-2, and a third protein, RAP-3, suggesting that these rhoptry proteins associate to form a complex [57]. Antibodies directed against RAP-1 block erythrocyte invasion *in vitro*, and monkeys immunized with RAP-1 and RAP-2 are protected against parasite challenge, suggesting that these rhoptry proteins should be considered for malaria vaccine development [55, 56, 58–60]. Gene-replacement methods were used to disrupt the RAP-1 gene in *P. falciparum* and replace it with a mutant gene encoding truncated RAP-1 [61•]. Although truncated RAP-1 targets to the rhoptries it does not form a complex with RAP-2 and RAP-3. Moreover, RAP-2 does not localize to the rhoptries, indicating that RAP-2 must complex with RAP-1 to correctly target to the rhoptries. *P. falciparum* transfectants expressing truncated RAP-1 have normal growth and invasion rates *in vitro*, indicating that full-length RAP-1 and the presence of the rhoptry complex containing RAP-1, RAP-2, and RAP-3 are not necessary for invasion. *P. falciparum* thus appears to have redundant mechanisms that mediate invasion in the absence of the rhoptry protein complex, raising questions about the use of RAP-1 and RAP-2 for malaria vaccine development.

#### MSP-1, a merozoite surface protein involved in erythrocyte invasion

MSP-1, the first merozoite surface protein to be identified, has been extensively investigated. Homologues of MSP-1 have been identified from a number of primate malaria parasites as well as several rodent malaria parasites. Sequence analysis shows that, within a species, MSP-1 contains conserved regions interspersed with regions that are more polymorphic [62]. MSP-1 undergoes extensive proteolytic processing either during schizogony or soon after merozoite release. The four resulting proteolytic fragments of *P. falciparum* MSP-1, with sizes of 83 kD (N-terminus), 30 kD, 38 kD, and 42 kD (C-terminus) remain associated as a noncovalent complex at the merozoite surface [63–65]. The C-terminal 42-kD fragment is attached to the plasma membrane of the merozoite by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor [63]. A final processing step cleaves the 42-kD fragment into a 33-kD fragment and a 19-kD fragment, which remains anchored to the merozoite surface by the GPI anchor during invasion. Because MSP-1 is evenly distributed over the merozoite surface, it is suggested that MSP-1 may mediate the initial interaction with the erythrocyte. Full-length *P. falciparum* MSP-1 binds erythrocytes in a sialic acid-dependent manner [66].
However, it is unknown whether the processed fragments of MSP-1 retain erythrocyte binding activity.

Antibodies directed against MSP-1<sub>19</sub> block erythrocyte invasion, and immunization with recombinant MSP-1<sub>19</sub> protects mice as well as monkeys against parasite challenge, providing support for a blood-stage vaccine based on MSP-1 [67–71]. Invasion-inhibitory antibodies directed against *P. falciparum* MSP-1<sub>19</sub> block proteolytic processing of MSP-1 [72]. Following natural exposure to *P. falciparum* infections, individuals in endemic areas acquire antibodies that can block the binding of processing-inhibitory antibodies to MSP-1 [73]. It may be important to design a subunit vaccine based on MSP-1<sub>19</sub> that elicits processing-inhibitory antibodies without eliciting antibodies that block their binding to MSP-1.

It has not been possible to ‘knock out’ the *P. falciparum* MSP-1 gene using gene targeting methods, indicating that MSP-1 is essential for invasion and survival [74]. Moreover, *P. falciparum* MSP-1<sub>19</sub> has limited sequence diversity, possibly because of functional constraints, and this provides a further advantage for vaccine development [62, 75]. However, it has been shown that *P. chabaudi* MSP-1<sub>19</sub> can functionally replace the *P. falciparum* domain despite the fact that the two sequences are highly divergent, suggesting that the sequence of MSP-1<sub>19</sub> may not be tightly constrained by function [74•]. This observation raises the possibility that introduction of a vaccine based on MSP-1<sub>19</sub> may result in selection of *P. falciparum* parasites with mutant MSP-1<sub>19</sub> domains that are functional but antigenically divergent, allowing parasites to escape host immune responses.

## Conclusion

Erythrocyte invasion by malaria parasites is a multi-step process that is mediated by highly specific molecular interactions. The use of molecular, biochemical, and genetic approaches has yielded valuable insights into this complex process. We have seen how understanding the molecular basis of interactions that mediate invasion can help in the rational design of vaccines that attempt to block erythrocyte invasion and prevent malaria.

This elegant study, in which the EBA-175 gene is disrupted by transfection in the *P. falciparum* strain W2Mef, uses sialic acid-glycophorin A for invasion. *P. falciparum* W2Mef transfectants switch to sialic acid-independent invasion pathways. *P. falciparum*'s ability to switch to alternative invasion pathways raises questions about vaccines that target *P. falciparum* EB-175.

This suggests that functional constraints on *P. falciparum* MSP-1<sub>19</sub> may not be tight. This observation has important implications for a malaria vaccine based on MSP-1<sub>19</sub>.
