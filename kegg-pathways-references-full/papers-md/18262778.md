### ABSTRACT

Indole-diterpenes are a structurally diverse group of secondary metabolites with a common cyclic diterpene backbone derived from geranylgeranyl diphosphate and an indole group derived from indole-3-glycerol phosphate. Different types and patterns of ring substitutions and ring stereochemistry generate this structural diversity. This group of compounds is best known for their neurotoxic effects in mammals, causing syndromes such as ‘ryegrass staggers’ in sheep and cattle. Because many of the fungi that synthesise these compounds form symbiotic relationships with plants, insects, and other fungi, the synthesis of these compounds may confer an ecological advantage to these associations. Considerable recent progress has been made on understanding indole-diterpene biosynthesis in filamentous fungi, principally through the cloning and characterisation of the genes and gene products for paxilline biosynthesis in *Penicillium paxilli*. Important insights into how the indole-diterpene backbone is synthesised and decorated have been obtained using *P. paxilli* mutants in this pathway. This review provides an overview of these recent developments.

### Introduction

Indole-diterpenes are a large, structurally diverse group of fungal secondary metabolites, many of which are potent tremorgenic mammalian mycotoxins (*Steyn & Vleggaar 1985*). Metabolites of this group appear to be confined to a limited number of fungi within the ascomycetes, including *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus*, *Claviceps*, and *Epichloë* species (*Parker & Scott 2004*). These metabolites have a common core structure comprising of a cyclic diterpene skeleton derived from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) and an indole group that is most likely derived from indole-3-glycerol phosphate, a precursor of tryptophan (*Byrne et al. 2002; de Jesus et al. 1983*). Paspaline is proposed to be the first stable indole-diterpene intermediate from which many of the other metabolites of this class are derived (*Saikia et al. 2006*). The structural diversity observed within this group of metabolites is achieved by additional prenylations, different patterns of ring substitutions and different ring stereochemistry (*Parker & Scott 2004*).

The biological activities most commonly associated with these compounds are tremogenicity in mammals and toxicity in insects through modulation of various ion channels

(Knaus et al. 1994; Smith et al. 2000). Given many of the fungi that synthesise these compounds form symbiotic relationships with plants, insects, and other fungi, the synthesis of these compounds may confer an ecological advantage to these associations (Parker & Scott 2004). Sclerotia of Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. have been shown to be a rich source of indole-diterpenes with biological activity against insects (Gloer 1995), suggesting that these compounds may confer protection to the fungal reproductive structures. The potent biological activity of these compounds, particularly their pharmacological properties, has been a stimulus for elucidating the genetics and biochemistry of indole-diterpene biosynthesis.

Considerable recent progress has been made on understanding indole-diterpene biosynthesis in filamentous fungi, principally through the cloning and characterisation of a cluster of genes from Penicillium paxilli necessary for the biosynthesis of paxilline (McMillan et al. 2003; Saikia et al. 2006; Young et al. 1998; Young et al. 2001). Adoption of *P. paxilli* as a model experimental system has provided important insights into how the indole-diterpene backbone is synthesised and further decorated through the versatile catalytic action of various cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. These studies have led to the recent cloning of gene clusters from Neotyphodium lolii and Aspergillus flavus for the biosynthesis of lolitrem and aflatrem, respectively. This review provides an overview of these recent developments.

### Indole-diterpene chemical diversity

The indole-diterpenes can be divided into two classes, the paxilline-like compounds, and those that lack the paxilline-type core (Fig 1). The paxilline-like compounds comprise the majority of the more than seventy fungal indole-diterpenes isolated so far (Lane et al. 2000).

The paxilline-like indole-diterpenes include the six structural groups assigned by Steyn & Vleggaar (1985). These are the penitrem, janthitrem, lolitrem, aflatrem, paxilline, and the paspaline/paspaline/paspalitrem. In addition to these six groups, the paxilline-like indole-diterpenes include the more recently discovered terpendoles, isolated from perennial ryegrass infected with Neotyphodium lolii (Gatenby et al. 1999) and Albophoma yamanashiensis (syn. Chaunopycnis alba) (Huang et al. 1995; Tomoda et al. 1995), the shearaines from Eupenicillium shearii (Belofsky et al. 1995), and the sulpines from Aspergillus sulphureus (Laakso et al. 1992b).

The paxilline-like compounds share a tetracyclic diterpene core fused to an indole moiety. For the majority of these compounds, including paxilline, the tetracyclic portion of the diterpene-derived skeleton has 19 rather than 20 carbons. However, there are a smaller number of compounds, including paspaline, for which all 20 carbons are present. Paspaline has been shown to be a biosynthetic precursor to paxilline, and it is likely that it is a pivotal intermediate in the synthesis of all these paxilline-like compounds (McMillan et al. 2003). The structures of the more complex members of this class of fungal indole-diterpenes can be considered in relationship to the paspaline structure (Fig 2). The lolitrem, penitrem, janthitrem, and shearaines all have two additional isoprene units substituted onto the benzyl ring and consequently are more complex cyclic structures. The paspalitrem, aflatrem, and the sulpines have only a single additional benzyl isoprenoid substitution. The paspalitrem, paspaline, paspalicine, and aflatrem have an additional ring structure through oxidation and acetalisation at C-7. The terpendoles and the lolitrem have an additional isoprene unit added to the C-27 hydroxyl group. The structures of the compounds within the groups exhibit different patterns of hydroxylations, epoxidations, acetylations, and chlorinations and also differ in ring stereochemistry.

The class of fungal non-paxilline indole-diterpenes includes the emindoles, isolated from Emericella spp. (Nozawa et al. 1988a; Nozawa et al. 1988c), nodulisporic acid from Nodulisporium sp. (Hensens et al. 1999; Ondeyka et al. 1997), petromindole from Petromyces muricatus (Ooike et al. 1997; Xiong et al. 2003), nominine from sclerotia of Aspergillus nomius (Gloer et al. 1989), the aflavinines from sclerotia of A. flavus (Gloer et al. 1988), the radarins from sclerotia of Aspergillus sulphureus (Laakso et al. 1992a), and the thiersinines isolated from Penicillium thiersii (Li et al. 2002). Emindole SB (Nozawa et al. 1988a), nodulisporic acid A (Hensens et al. 1999; Ondeyka et al. 1997), and thiersinines A and B (Li et al. 2002) share the C, D, and E rings with paxilline, and it is likely that their biosynthesis is related to the cyclisation steps that form paspaline. However, a number of distinctive skeletal variations have been identified in this group, including emindoles DB, DA, and SA, which are bicyclic or tricyclic structures attached to the indole unit at only one position (Nozawa et al. 1988b; Nozawa et al. 1987; Nozawa et al. 1988c).

### Discontinuous taxonomic distribution of indole-diterpenes

Indole-diterpene production has been demonstrated for several species of ascomycete fungi belonging to the Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes (Parker & Scott 2004), which form a paraphyletic lineage within the Pezizomycotina (James et al. 2006). Fungi that are known to produce indole-diterpenes are limited to a relatively small number of species scattered disparately throughout these two classes. The Eurotiomycetes include the Penicillium and Aspergillus genera for which there are in excess of 100 and 200 recognised species, respectively, and a small number of species belonging to the Petromyces genus. However, indole-diterpene production has only been demonstrated for a total of 17 species belonging to these genera. For the Sordariomycetes, indole-diterpene production has been reported for only eight species belonging to six different genera in three orders. All of the indole-diterpene-producing fungi identified to date are listed in Table 1. For a comprehensive list of indole-diterpenes identified from filamentous fungi see Parker & Scott (2004). In support of the role of paxilline as a common intermediate in the production of many indole-diterpenes (Mantle & Weedon 1994), with the exception of Phomopsis, paxilline and/or its likely precursors have been identified in extracts of all genera of fungi that produce paxilline-like indole-diterpenes. However, the distribution of more highly 'decorated' indole-diterpenes is less continuous, and the relatedness of these more complex compounds tends to

be correlated with the phylogenetic relatedness of the fungi from which they are derived; for example, production of the lolitrem is confined to clavicipitaceous fungi (Epichloë and Neotyphodium spp.), whereas penitrem production is confined

to the Eurotiales (Penicillium and Aspergillus spp.). The discontinuous taxonomic distribution of indole-diterpene producing fungi and the occurrence of an increasing variety of indole-diterpenes from fungi within these classes make the genetic basis for indole-diterpene production an attractive model system for elucidation of the genetic mechanisms that drive the emergence, development, and decline of secondary metabolite gene clusters.

### Biological activity of indole-diterpenes

The production of indole-diterpenes by filamentous fungi has both beneficial and detrimental effects on animals mainly due to their anti-mammalian and anti-insectan bioactivities (Gloer 1995; Steyn & Vleggaar 1985). One of the better known biological effects is the disorder ‘ryegrass staggers’ in animals

quantities of paxilline in submerged cultures (Ibba et al. 1987). In addition, a high-frequency transformation system using the hygromycin resistance gene as a selectable marker is available allowing manipulations, such as gene replacements, to be routinely used for genetic analysis (Itoh et al. 1994; Young et al. 1998).

Using a combination of plasmid insertional mutagenesis and chromosome walking, a cluster of genes from *P. paxilli*

were isolated and shown to be required for paxilline biosynthesis (Young et al. 2001). The *pax* gene cluster contains at least seven genes including *paxG* (encoding a GGPP synthase), *paxC* (a prenyltransferase), *paxM* (a FAD-dependent monooxygenase), *paxP* and *paxQ* (two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases), and *paxA* and *paxB* (two putative membrane-associated proteins; Fig 3) (McMillan et al. 2003; Young et al. 2001). The role of these genes in paxilline biosynthesis been

confirmed by using gene inactivation and complementation approaches.

The first committed step in paxilline biosynthesis pathway is catalysed by PaxG forming GGPP. Targeted deletion of *paxG* (subsequent to the generation of the *paxG* deletion strain it was found that this deletion also included a part of the coding region of the adjacent *paxA* gene) resulted in mutant strains that were completely blocked for indole-diterpene biosynthesis (*Young et al.* 2001). In addition to *paxG*, the genome of *P. paxilli* contains another copy of GGPP synthase (*ggs1*) that could be specific for primary metabolism. Two copies of GGPP synthases are also present in other filamentous fungi, including *N. lolii* and *Fusarium fujikuroi* that produce lolitrem and gibberellins, respectively (*Tudzynski & Holter* 1998; *Young et al.* 2005). The presence of two copies of GGPP synthases is thought to be a ‘signature’ for fungi capable of producing diterpenes (*Parker & Scott* 2004).

Although the precise details of the steps leading from GGPP to the first identifiable indole-diterpene, paspaline, are not clear, PaxM, PaxC, and PaxB are required for these steps (*Saikia et al.* 2006) (Fig 3). PaxM is proposed to catalyse the epoxidation of the two terminal double bonds of the geranylgeranyl moiety of 3-geranylgeranyllindole (*Saikia et al.* 2006), which was shown previously to be incorporated into paxilline (*Fueki et al.* 2004). The resulting di-epoxide then cyclises to form paspaline, in a reaction that is proposed to be catalysed by the prenyltransferase, PaxC. PaxB is proposed to have a role in the transportation of substrate(s) to the vicinity of the biosynthetic enzyme complex. Although deletion of PaxA gave mutants that were blocked for paxilline biosynthesis (B.M., unpubl.), it was not required for paspaline biosynthesis (*Saikia et al.* 2006) suggesting that PaxA may have a role similar to PaxB in the paxilline biosynthesis pathway in steps post-paspaline.

Two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, PaxP and PaxQ, are involved in the later steps of the pathway in which paspaline is converted to paxilline. Deletion mutants of *paxP* and *paxQ* were blocked for paxilline biosynthesis and accumulated paspaline and 13-desoxypaxilline, respectively (*McMillan et al.* 2003). This confirmed that these two genes are required for paxilline biosynthesis and that paspaline and 13-desoxypaxilline are the most likely substrates for the corresponding enzymes. Precursor-feeding has been used as a method for testing whether proposed intermediates are true substrates or products of biosynthetic enzymes in filamentous fungi (*Rojas et al.* 2001; *Tudzynski et al.* 2001; *Tudzynski et al.* 2003; *Tudzynski et al.* 2002). In this method the potential intermediate or substrate is fed to a mutant deleted for the biosynthetic cluster, but containing introduced copies of the gene of interest (Fig 4). Recently, this approach was used to clearly establish the various steps catalysed by PaxP and PaxQ (*Saikia et al.* 2007). Based on these studies, it was found that PaxP was able to catalyse multiple oxidation steps resulting in the conversion of paspaline to 13-desoxypaxilline via β-PC-M6 (Fig 3). Similar catalytic activities by a P450 enzyme have been reported in other fungi, including *F. fujikuroi*, *Curvularia lunata* and *Phaeosphaeria sp.* wherein a single P450 enzyme catalyses multiple oxidation steps both at a single carbon atom and at different carbon atoms (*Kawaide* 2006; *Rojas et al.* 2001; *Suzuki et al.* 1993; *Tudzynski et al.* 2001). Although the proposed involvement of paspaline B as the first oxidised analogue of paspaline (*Munday-Finch et al.* 1996a) was not tested, at least one unknown indole-diterpene compound was consistently detected in extracts of wild-type *P. paxilli*. Contrary to a previous scheme in which paxilline was proposed to be synthesised either from β-paxitriol or 13-desoxypaxilline (*Munday-Finch et al.* 1996a), *Saikia et al.* (2007) have recently shown that the penultimate precursor of paxilline is 13-desoxypaxilline and that no bifurcation of the pathway to paxilline exists at PC-M6.

Although PaxP could catalyse the conversion of β-paxitriol to paxilline, β-paxitriol is not considered to be a pathway intermediate but it may be involved in steps that transform paxilline into other paxilline-like compounds

Strains containing ectopically-integrated copies of the gene of interest were selected by expression analysis for feeding precursors. The indole-diterpene products were analysed by tlc/hplc.
(Saikia et al. 2007). These studies also demonstrated that PaxQ was able to convert α-PC-M6 to α-paxitriol; this is also a reaction that is unlikely to be part of paxilline biosynthesis and may indicate substrate-promiscuous activity of PaxQ. In Penicillium janczewskii and Penicillium janthinellum, incorporation of labelled β-paxitriol and not α-paxitriol, into penitrem A and E and janthitrem B and C, respectively, suggests that β-paxitriol is an immediate precursor for the complex indole-diterpenes with β-stereochemistry at C-10 (Penn & Mantle 1994). Moreover, indole-diterpenes that have been reported from fungi belonging to the taxonomic order Eurotales (Aspergillus and Penicillium spp.) have β-stereochemistry, and those belonging to the order Hypocreales (Epichloë and Claviceps spp.) have α-stereochemistry at this position (Parker & Scott 2004; Spatafora et al. 2007). These observations highlight the substrate stereospecificity of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of indole-diterpenes. We propose that PaxP has a crucial role in determining the stereospecificity of indole-diterpene biosynthesis in filamentous fungi. This hypothesis can be tested by introducing either or both ltmP and ltmQ, the N. lolii orthologues of paxP and paxQ, respectively, into P. paxilli under the control of their respective pax gene promoter and check if P. paxilli transformants are able to form indole-diterpenes with α-stereochemistry. Such heterologous expression of ltm genes has been successfully used for functional characterisation of other ltm genes in P. paxilli (Young et al. 2006).

Recently, two other *pax* genes, *paxD* (encoding an aromatic prenyltransferase) and *paxO* (an oxidoreductase), that were earlier identified in the *pax* cluster (Young et al. 2001) have been found to be co-regulated with other *pax* genes (B.M., unpubl.). A *paxD* deletion mutant (C.Y., unpubl.) was found to accumulate indole-diterpenes that were not prenylated (Brian Tapper, pers. comm.) suggesting that PaxD may catalyse isoprenylation of the indole ring or the diterpene part of paxilline in steps post-paxilline.

### GGPP synthases in diterpene biosynthesis

GGPP synthases belong to a family of prenyltransferases that catalyse the sequential addition of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to allylic prenyl diphosphates, forming products of varying chain-lengths and double-bond stereochemistry that are specific to each enzyme. In eukaryotes, including mammals, GGPP synthases catalyse the synthesis of GGPP predominantly in a single-step reaction from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and IPP, or alternatively, in a sequence of reactions involving the addition of IPP to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP), and FPP (Jiang et al. 1995; Kavanagh et al. 2006a; Kuzuguchi et al. 1999; Sagami et al. 1994). These prenyltransferases contain five conserved regions, designated I–V (Fig 5A) (Chen et al. 1994). Based on three-dimensional structures (Chang et al. 2006; Gabelli et al. 2006; Hosfield et al. 2004;

Fungal indole-diterpenes

Kavanagh et al. 2006a; Kavanagh et al. 2006b; Rondeau et al. 2006; Tarshis et al. 1996; Tarshis et al. 1994) and site-directed mutagenesis (Joly & Edwards 1993; Marrero et al. 1992; Song & Poulter 1994; Tarshis et al. 1996) the importance of these five conserved regions in substrate binding and catalysis has become evident. The diphosphate moiety of the allylic substrates DMAPP/GPP/FPP bind through Mg²⁺ ions to the two aspartate-rich motifs DDXX(XX)D and DDXXD (where ‘X’ represents any amino acid residue) present in region II and V, respectively. Region III containing the GQXXD motif is also involved in the binding of the allylic substrates. Binding of the diphosphate moiety of the homoallylic substrate IPP involves two basic residues present in region I that has a GKXXR motif. The conserved lysine and threonine residues of the KT motif of region IV are involved in catalysis by activation of the diphosphate leaving group and subsequent stabilisation of the putative carbocation intermediate formed during catalysis. Binding of the substrates by the prenyltransferases is ordered, with the allylic substrate binding first followed by IPP.

In eukaryotes, FPP synthases have bulky amino acid residues at the fourth or fifth position before the first aspartate-rich motif (FARM) of region II whereas the GGPP, including *P. paxilli* Ggs1 and PaxG, and longer chain-length synthases have smaller amino acid residues in these positions (Fig 5B). Site-directed mutational studies in conjunction with three-dimensional structural studies implicated these large amino acid residues of FPP synthases in determining the product chain-length (Ohnuma et al. 1997; Ohnuma et al. 1996; Tarshis et al. 1996) by providing a ‘floor’ underneath the allylic substrate site and blocking the further elongation of the product. Replacement of bulky residues with smaller ones removes the blockage resulting in longer products. However, in GGPP and longer chain-length synthases specific amino acid residues at regions other than the FARM determine the product chain-length highlighting the presence of alternate mechanisms of product chain-length determination (Chang et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2004; Hemmi et al. 2003).

In the filamentous fungi, *P. paxilli*, *N. lolii*, *F. fujikuroi*, and *A. flavus*, two copies of GGPP synthases, one for primary metabolism (Ggs1-related proteins) and the other for secondary metabolism (PaxG-related proteins), are present (Tudzynski & Holter 1998; Young et al. 2001; Young et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2004). The genomes of *A. nidulans* and *F. graminearum* also contain two copies of genes homologous to *paxG*, although the diterpene phenotypes of these two fungi are not known. This presence of two copies of GGPP synthases across these genera suggests a molecular ‘signature’ for diterpene biosynthesis (Parker & Scott 2004) and could mean that biosynthetic pathways that utilise these enzymes are compartmentalised. Aligned GGPP synthase sequences from different filamentous fungi show greatest variation among the sequences at their N-terminal region (Saikia 2006). This variability suggests that the N-terminal region could harbour specific signals including those for protein targeting (Okada et al. 2000; Sitthithaworn et al. 2001; Zhu et al. 1997). Unlike the sequences of GGPP synthases involved in secondary metabolism, sequences of those involved in primary metabolism frequently contain a unique motif, IPPRTSS, which could be involved in anchoring or translocating Ggs1-related proteins into a subcellular compartment separate from PaxG-related

proteins (Young 2005). Based on subcellular localisation algorithms, Ggs1 and its *M. grisea* homologue appear to contain mitochondrial targeting peptides; however, PaxG and its homologues in *A. flavus*, *A. nidulans*, and *F. graminearum* appear to contain peroxisomal targeting signals (Saikia 2006). Peroxisomal targeting motifs have been reported for proteins involved in biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite AK-toxin in *Alternaria alternata* (Tanaka et al. 1999; Tanaka & Tsuge 2000). The acyltransferase enzyme catalysing the last step in penicillin biosynthesis was shown to localise to peroxisomes (Muller et al. 1992; Muller et al. 1991). In *Aspergillus* spp., the sterigmatocystin and aflatoxin precursor, norsolorinic acid, was shown to accumulate in peroxisomes (Maggio-Hall et al. 2005). These findings, on peroxisomal targeting of different proteins involved in secondary metabolism, emphasise the importance of subcellular localisation for secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

### Aflatrem biosynthesis in *Aspergillus flavus*

Aflatrem and its isomer β-aflatrem are paxilline-like indole-diterpenes produced by *Aspergillus flavus* and are potent mammalian tremorgens (Gallagher et al. 1980a; TePaske et al. 1992). The structures of aflatrem and related compounds suggest that they are derived from paxilline (Fig 6A). By comparison with the *pax* gene cluster in *P. paxilli*, therefore, a complete aflatrem biosynthesis gene cluster would be expected to contain homologues of all seven paxilline production genes (*paxG*, *paxA*, *paxM*, *paxB*, *paxC*, *paxP*, and *paxQ*), plus a small number of aflatrem-specific genes necessary for the subsequent conversion of paxilline to aflatrem. Identification of a secondary GGPP synthase-encoding gene and chromosome walking enabled the description of a gene cluster that is

**Fig 6 – Aflatrem biosynthesis in *Aspergillus flavus*.** (A) The chemical structures of aflatrem and β-aflatrem. (B) A gene cluster necessary for aflatrem production. *atmG*, *atmC*, and *atmM* are orthologues of paspaline production genes in *Penicillium paxilli* and encode a GGPP synthase, a prenyltransferase, and a FAD-dependent monooxygenase, respectively. AF109 encodes a putative Zn₂Cys₆ transcription factor which may be involved in regulation of the cluster. AF110 encodes a putative FAD-dependent monooxygenase that is likely to be involved in the conversion of paxilline to aflatrem.
thought to be necessary for aflatrem production in A. *flavus* NRRL 6541 (Zhang et al. 2004). This cluster contains homologues of *paxG*, *paxM*, and *paxC*, designated *atmG*, *atmM*, and *atmC*, respectively (Fig 6B). These three genes are clustered with several other genes that may also be involved in the aflatrem production pathway, including AF109, which encodes a putative Zn₂Cys₆ transcription factor, and AF110, which encodes a putative FAD-dependent monooxygenase. By complementation analysis *atmM* was shown to be a functional homologue of *paxM* and expression of *atmG*, *atmM*, and *atmC* was shown to be correlated with the onset of aflatrem biosynthesis. Although this cluster contains genes encoding candidate enzymes for some of the steps required for the production of paxilline and aflatrem, homologues of three genes known to be necessary for paxilline production in *P. paxilli* (*paxP*, *paxQ*, and *paxB*) were not identified.

Complete genome sequences for *A. flavus* NRRL 3357 and its close relative *Aspergillus oryzae* RIB40 are now available (Machida et al. 2005; Payne et al. 2006). Analysis of these genomic sequences has revealed the presence of an aflatrem cluster similar to that already identified in the genome of *A. flavus* NRRL 6541, both of which display high nucleotide identity and totally conserved synteny (M.J.N., unpubl.). These genomes also contain a second gene cluster at a separate chromosomal locus, which includes homologues of *paxP*, *paxQ*, *paxA*, *paxB*, and *paxD* (M.J.N., unpubl.). Thus, homologues of all seven genes necessary for paxilline production in *Penicillium paxilli* are present in the genomes of *A. flavus* and *A. oryzae*, supporting the proposal that aflatrem production proceeds via paspaline and paxilline intermediates. The enzymatically mediated conversion of paxilline to aflatrem requires oxidation and acetal formation at C-7 and prenylation of the C-20 carbon of the indole group (or C-21 for β-aflatrem). The most likely enzyme for the former step is a predicted FAD-dependent monooxygenase encoded by AF110 in the first *atm* cluster (Zhang et al. 2004) (Fig 6B). The latter step is likely to be mediated by a putative aromatic prenyltransferase encoded by *atmD*, a homologue of *paxD* identified in the *pax* gene cluster of *P. paxilli* (Young et al. 2001).

The regulatory control of indole-diterpene production is not yet clear as no transcription factor-like sequences have been identified in the *pax* and *ltm* gene clusters of *P. paxilli* (Saikia et al. 2007; Young et al. 2001) and *Neotyphodium lolii/Epicloë festucae* (Young et al. 2005; Young et al. 2006), respectively. The putative Zn₂Cys₆ transcription factor encoded by AF109 in the first aflatrem cluster (Zhang et al. 2004) may therefore represent the first pathway-specific regulator identified in any indole-diterpene gene cluster. A recent study has also demonstrated that expression of *atmG*, *atmM*, and *atmC* and aflatrem production are under the regulatory control of the product of *veA*, a gene which is necessary for the formation of sclerotia in *A. flavus* (Duran et al. 2007).

### Lolitrem biosynthesis in Neotyphodium lolii/Epicloë festucae

The lolitrem, identified from endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass, are a class of indole-diterpenes known for their tremorgenic properties (Gallagher et al. 1982; Gallagher et al. 1984). The link between lolitrem B and the mammalian mycotoxin disorder, ‘ryegrass staggers’, has encouraged a systematic analysis of the indole-diterpene profile in *Neotyphodium lolii*-infected perennial ryegrass seed that led to a proposed metabolic grid for the biosynthesis of lolitrem B and related indole-diterpenes (Gatenby et al. 1999; Munday-Finch et al. 1998; Munday-Finch et al. 1997). Indole-diterpenes that have been isolated and chemically characterised from endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass include paspaline (Gatenby et al. 1999), paspaline B (Munday-Finch et al. 1996a), 13-desoxypaxilline (Gatenby et al. 1999), terpendole M (Gatenby et al. 1999), lolicine A and B (Munday-Finch et al. 1998), lolilline (Munday-Finch et al. 1997), lolitriol (Miles et al. 1992; Munday-Finch et al. 1998), lolitrem A (Gallagher et al. 1981; Munday-Finch et al. 1995), lolitrem E (Miles et al. 1994), lolitrem N (Munday-Finch et al. 1998), and lolitrem F (Munday-Finch et al. 1996b). The structure of these indole-diterpenes and their biological activity are listed in Table 2. The structural similarity between these diverse indole-diterpenes and the precursors required for paxilline biosynthesis by *Penicillium paxilli* (Fig 3) suggest early key intermediates are synthesised via orthologous steps of the biosynthetic pathway.

The first *ltm* gene *ltmG*, a GGPP synthase from *N. lolii* and *E. festucae*, was cloned using a degenerate PCR strategy with primers designed to fungal GGPP synthases. This approach identified two independent *ggs* gene fragments from *ltmG* and *ggsA* of which only one, *ltmG*, hybridised to the lolitrem producing isolates Lp19 and Fl1, and was subsequently found to reside adjacent to two predicted homologous genes of the *P. paxilli pax* gene cluster (Young et al. 2005). The remaining seven *ltm* genes were identified using suppression subtractive hybridisation combined with chromosome walking. The *LTM* locus from Lp19 (Fig 7) spans ~100 kb consisting of three mini-gene clusters separated by AT-rich retrotransposon-like repetitive sequences. The Lp19 *LTM* locus differs from that of *E. festucae* Fl1 by the presence of two retrotransposon relics inserted in between *ltmK* and the *pks* pseudogene (Fig 7). Cluster 1 contains three genes, *ltmG*, *ltmM*, and *ltmK* (Young et al. 2005), cluster 2 contains five genes, *ltmB*, *ltmC*, *ltmF*, *ltmQ*, and *ltmP*, and cluster 3 contains two genes, *ltmJ* and *ltmE* (Young et al. 2006) (Fig 7). The predicted functions of the gene products are listed in Table 3. The repetitive nature of the sequence within the *LTM* locus has made it difficult to extend the sequence beyond the borders of *ltmE* and the *pks* pseudogene. Thus, it is possible that additional *ltm* genes remain to be identified in the lolitrem producing isolates such as *N. lolii* Lp19 and *E. festucae* Fl1. Six genes, *ltmG*, *ltmM*, *ltmB*, *ltmC*, *ltmP*, and *ltmQ*, appear to be functional orthologues of *paxG*, *paxM*, *paxB*, *paxC*, *paxP*, and *paxQ* from *P. paxilli*, genes shown to encode enzymes for paxilline biosynthesis (McMillan et al. 2003; Saikia et al. 2006; Young et al. 2001; Young et al. 2006) (Fig 3, Table 3). The remaining four genes, *ltmJ*, *ltmK*, *ltmE*, and *ltmF* are unique to lolitrem biosynthesis and are therefore predicted to encode for enzymes that catalyse the formation of the A, B, and I ring structures of lolitrem B (Fig 8).

The cloning of the *N. lolii ltm* genes now allows for elucidation of the biochemical function of the gene products.

a References in bold relate to isolation of compound from endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass.

Unfortunately, although *N. lolii* naturally associates with perennial ryegrass, it is intractable to genetic analysis due to its slow growth rate in culture. The genetically similar *E. festucae* isolate, Fl1, is able to synthesise lolitrem B, grows much faster, and is capable of forming a compatible association with perennial ryegrass. Therefore, this isolate has been utilised for functional analysis of the *ltm* genes by analysis of gene ‘knock-out’ mutants. However, functional analysis of these mutants still requires a lengthy process to assess the *in planta* phenotype of the gene deletion. Alternatively, we have utilised *P. paxilli* paxilline biosynthesis mutants to ectopically express *ltm* orthologues. In contrast to the expression profiles of the *pax* genes (Young et al. 2001), the *ltm* genes show little or no expression in culture but are highly expressed *in planta* (Young et al. 2005; Young et al. 2006). In order to ectopically express the *ltm* genes in *P. paxilli* it is essential they are under the control of a *pax* gene promoter. Complementation of *paxM* and *paxC* mutants with the reciprocal *ltm* orthologues, *ltmM* and *ltmC*, respectively, successfully demonstrated that *paxM/ltmM* and *paxM/ltmC* are true functional orthologous genes (Young et al. 2006). This approach can now be extended to other predicted orthologues such as *paxP/ltmP* and *paxQ/ltmQ* and could also be used for precursor-feeding studies (Saikia et al. 2007) to further dissect the pathway.

The chemical structure of the indole-diterpenes identified within *N. lolii*-infected perennial ryegrass, indicates that the formation of the A and B rings are independent of the I ring. This suggests that the lolitrem are able to form via an enzymatic metabolic grid with major and minor biosynthetic pathways where several compounds can serve as substrates for certain enzymatic steps. For example, the *paxQ* gene product has been shown to hydroxylate the C-13 position of the paspaline ring (Saikia et al. 2007). A similar pattern of hydroxylation is found in terpendole E and lolicine A, which suggests that these compounds could also serve as substrates for the *ltmQ* gene product.

### The genetic basis for indole-diterpene chemical diversity and evolution of gene clusters

The studies described here demonstrate that paspaline is likely to be the first stable indole-diterpene intermediate in the synthesis of paxilline in *Penicillium paxilli*, aflatrems in *Aspergillus flavus*, and lolitrem in *Neotyphodium lolii*. Reconstitution studies in *P. paxilli* established that four genes, *paxG*, *paxM*, *paxB*, and *paxC* are necessary and sufficient for the synthesis of paspaline. Homologues of these four genes are found in both *A. flavus* and *N. lolii*, indicating that these are the core gene products required to build an indole-diterpene molecule. Decoration of this core molecule through the action of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, FAD-dependent monooxygenases, and prenyltransferases

generates the indole-diterpene chemical diversity observed in these species.

Whereas the genes for the synthesis of these metabolites are organised in gene clusters in all three species, there is considerable diversity in both gene organisation and chromosome structure at each locus. The genes for paxilline biosynthesis in *P. paxilli* form a single gene cluster that appears to be part of a larger conditionally dispensable region of the genome. In *A. flavus* the genes for aflatrems biosynthesis are split into two distinct clusters located on two different chromosomes. The lolitrem biosynthetic cluster found in *N. lolii* is even more complex, being split into three mini-clusters, interspersed with large blocks of retrotransposon relic DNA. The complex structure and organisation of the LTM locus would suggest that it is located in a rapidly evolving region of the genome. The presence of multiple copies of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and prenyltransferase genes within all clusters suggest that gene duplication has played a key role in gene expansion and evolution. Gene duplication is a well-known process for evolution of new gene (enzyme) functions within genomes, as the duplicate copy is free to evolve new functions through the forces of mutation and natural selection (*Ohno 1970*). This gene expansion is particularly marked in *N. lolii*, where there are four cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Accompanying this gene expansion is an increase in

the indole-diterpene biosynthetic capability of *N. lolii*, compared with *A. flavus* and *P. paxilli*.
