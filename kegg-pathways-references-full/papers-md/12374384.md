(Received for publication April 10, 2002)

Using inverse PCR, two new genes (*btrN* and *btrS*) were identified upstream of the putative glycosyltransferase gene *btrM* in the butirosin-biosynthetic *btr* gene cluster of *Bacillus circulans*. The upstream gene *btrS* showed significant homology with *stsC* of *Streptomyces griseus*, which encodes L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase in the biosynthesis of streptomycin. The function of BtrS was further confirmed by heterologous expression in *Escherichia coli* and chemical identification of the conversion of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose into 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine. The identification of BtrS as L-glutamine:2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose aminotransferase is the first report of the aminotransferase gene responsible for 2-deoxystreptamine biosynthesis.

Aminoglycosides have been one of the most clinically-important groups of antibiotics for some time. Based on their chemical structures, aminoglycosides can be classified into two major groups. One has as aglycone a fully-substituted aminocyclitol which is believed to be synthesized from myo-inositol. Streptomycin, fortimicin, and spectinomycin are among this group, and genetic as well as enzymic analyses of their biosynthesis have been reported.$^{1\sim3)}$ The other group of aminoglycosides has the common aglycone of 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS), and, numerous clinically important compounds are included in this category, such as neomycin, kanamycin, ribostamycin, butirosin, gentamicin, tobramycin and sisomicin. The biosynthetic relationships between these two classes has been long recognized. However, no evidence to substantiate this has been presented on the enzymic or genetic level.

The biosynthesis of DOS-containing aminoglycosides has been studied mostly by the use of isotope-tracer technology with whole cell systems of producing organisms or their mutants.$^{4\sim8)}$ The biosynthetic pathway of butirosin, produced by a *Bacillus* species is proposed as shown in Fig. 1.$^{6)}$ However, a biosynthetic gene of DOS-containing aminoglycosides has only recently been identified. Genetic analysis had been carried out on the butirosin-producer

*Bacillus circulans* and a region around the self-resistance gene (*butA*) was analyzed.$^{9)}$ While a gene for butirosin-transport (*butB*) was found in this particular region, no biosynthetic gene was found. With respect to enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these antibiotics only transamination had been detected.$^{10,11)}$ In our laboratory, efforts were focused on the study of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (DOI) synthase, the key enzyme for the initial step of DOS biosynthesis using isotope-labeled substrates or substrate analogues.$^{12\sim17)}$ DOI synthase is thought to be essential for the biosynthesis of DOS-containing aminoglycosides.

DOI synthase from the butirosin-producer *Bacillus circulans* has been purified.$^{18)}$ The enzyme is composed of two subunits with molecular mass of 40 and 20 kDa, respectively. Subsequently, the gene for the larger subunit (*btrC*) was identified and over-expressed in *Escherichia coli* as confirmation of its catalytic function;$^{19)}$ a butirosin-biosynthetic gene cluster containing *btrC* identified.$^{20)}$ These results are the only report of the biosynthetic genes of DOS-containing aminoglycoside to date.

In the present study, we analyzed the genes upstream of *btrM* (putative glycosyltransferase gene)$^{20)}$ in the gene cluster, and found two additional ORFs. One of these, *btrS*, was cloned and expressed in *E. coli*, and its function as

The resulting circular DNAs were used as template for amplification. The PCR conditions were; 1 cycle at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 5 minutes, and then 72°C for 7 minutes, using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR product was subcloned into pT7-blue T vector (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid (pDS16) was sequenced. A minimum of 3 individual clones were so analyzed.

**Expression of *btrS* in *E. coli***

Primers *btrS*-f (TTCATATGACCATTCCATTTGACCA) and *btrS*-r (AAGGATCCTTCGTTAATGAGTCACG) were designed and used for PCR; 1 cycle at 98°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 seconds, 55°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 1.5 minutes, using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan). The PCR product was 5'-phosphorylated, and subcloned into the *Sma* I-site of pUC119 to yield pUCbtrS. *E. coli* JM109 carrying pUCbtrS was grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.6, and, isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 4 hours, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 minutes) and stored at −30°C until use.

**Enzyme Assay**

Cells of *E. coli*/pUCbtrS and *E. coli*/pUC119 (as a control) were separately suspended in 50 mM BES-NaOH (pH 7.7) buffer (5 g of wet cells in 50 ml), and the suspensions sonicated using a Branson sonifier Type-250 at 0°C for 2 minutes × 10 times in an ice-water bath. The sonicates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 minutes and the resulting cell-free extract used for enzyme analysis. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mM BES-NaOH (pH 7.7), 25 mM L-glutamine, 0.5 mM pyridoxal phosphate, 5 mM DOI and 100 μl cell-free extract in a total volume of 200 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours, and filtered through a Microcon YM-10 (Millipore, USA) to remove protein (>10,000 MW).

Dansyl chloride (10 mg/ml in CH<sub>3</sub>CN, 75 μl) and 2 N NaOH (15 μl) were added to an aliquot (25 μl) of each enzyme reaction mixture. Derivatization was carried out at 37°C for 1.5 hours, and 5 μl of the reaction mixture injected into a HPLC system equipped with a Senshu Pak ODS1251N column (4.6 mm i.d. × 25 cm, Senshu Scientific, Japan). The eluent was 20% CH<sub>3</sub>CN in 0.2 M sodium acetate with a flow rate of 1 ml/minute. HPLC was performed on a Hitachi L-7100 pump equipped with a Hitachi L-7485 FL-detector, a Hitachi column oven L-7300 and a Hitachi D-2500 integrator. Elution was monitored by fluorescence detection (excitation; 331 nm and fluorescence emission; 523 nm).

(±)-2-Deoxy-scyllo-inosamine HCl (5)

To a solution of 4 (304 mg, 0.553 mmol) dissolved in a minimal volume of EtOAc were added MeOH-H₂O-1N HCl (1.0 ml - 0.39 ml - 0.15 ml) and 1.11 g of 10% Pd-C (Aldrich, USA) and the mixture was placed in a pressure-reactor. The atmosphere was first replaced with hydrogen gas then filled with pressurized hydrogen gas (50 kgf/cm²). The mixture was vigorously stirred under these conditions at room temperature for 4 days. After renewal of catalyst, the same procedure was repeated. The catalyst was then removed by filtration, and the filtrate was evaporated *in vacuo* to give pale yellow solid 5. The solid was then suspended in acetone and filtered. The precipitate was further washed with MeOH to give 5 as a white solid (108 mg, 98%): ¹H-NMR (400 MHz, D₂O) δ 1.45 (1H, ddd, J=12.4, 12.4 and 4.4 Hz), 2.14 (1H, ddd, J=12.4, 4.4 and 4.4 Hz), 3.06 (1H, ddd, J=12.4, 10.6 and 4.4 Hz), 3.07 (1H, q, J=9.6 Hz), 3.16 (2H, m), 3.32 (1H, m), 3.47 (1H, m); ¹³C-NMR (D₂O) δ 33.2, 50.8, 69.4, 73.7, 75.2, 77.0.

**Results and Discussion**

**Identification of the Upstream Region of btrM**

The upstream region of btrM (putative glycosyl-transferase gene)²⁰⁾ was analyzed by inverse PCR (Fig. 2). The btrN gene located immediately upstream of btrM showed no similarity to any known sequences by FASTA or BLAST2 searches. Further upstream of btrN, the gene btrS was found. The latter showed significant homology to stsC of Streptomyces griseus, the gene encoding L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase in the biosynthesis of streptomycin³⁾, as shown in Fig. 3 (40% identity by FASTA). BtrS appeared to be a component of the butirosin-biosynthetic gene cluster, and the function of BtrS was deduced to be L-glutamine:DOI aminotransferase, catalyzing the reaction shown in Fig. 4. Previously, transamination activity of ketocyclitols from L-glutamine was described in cell-free extracts of several DOS-containing aminoglycoside producers¹⁰,¹¹,²³,²⁴⁾. However, neither the enzymes nor the corresponding genes were identified.

**Confirmation of L-Glutamine: DOI Aminotransferase Activity**

To establish the function of BtrS, the proposed product, authentic (±)-2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine was synthesized.

(Fig. 5). The amine was derivatized into a dansyl amide, used for fluorescence detection. The *btrS* gene was expressed using *E. coli*. The corresponding DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and inserted into an expression vector pUC119, and transformed into *E. coli* JM109. L-Glutamine:DOI aminotransferase activity of the cell-free extract from *E. coli*/pUCbtrS was examined as described in Materials and Methods. The enzyme reaction product was derivatized into a dansyl amide, and was compared with the authentic dansyl derivative of synthetic (±)-2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine by HPLC as shown in Fig. 6. Both the enzyme reaction product and the authentic sample eluted similarly at about 14 minutes; no peak was observed using the cell-free system of *E. coli*/pUC119. Furthermore, a large-scale incubation was also carried out as described in Materials and Methods. The 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine product was identified by 'H- and '3C-NMR as well as FAB-MS (*m/z* 164 [M+H+]). All the data were identical to those of the authentic standard. These results clearly showed that BtrS is the L-glutamine:DOI aminotransferase required for the biosynthesis of butirosin.

In the present study, we have identified the L-glutamine:DOI aminotransferase gene (*btrS*) of the butirosin-biosynthetic gene cluster of *B. circulans*, and confirmed its enzymatic activity with expressed protein. Because the transamination reaction to ketocyclitols is unique in the biosynthetic pathways of aminoglycoside antibiotics, similar genes should be expected in other DOS-containing aminoglycoside-producers. Consequently, this gene would appear to be a useful genetic marker for the screening of aminoglycoside-producers.
