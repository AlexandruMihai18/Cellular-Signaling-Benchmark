# Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a model for the pharmacogenomics of cancer therapy

**Meyling H. Cheok* and William E. Evans**

Abstract | The use of combination chemotherapy to cure acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children emerged in the 1980s as a paradigm for curing any disseminated cancer, and many of the therapeutic principles were subsequently applied to the treatment of other disseminated human cancers. Similarly, elucidation of the pharmacogenomics of ALL and its translation into new chemotherapeutic approaches might serve as a model for optimizing the treatment of other human cancers. Germline polymorphisms and gene-expression patterns in ALL cells have been linked to the toxicity and efficacy of chemotherapy for ALL and are beginning to emerge as useful clinical diagnostics.

### Pharmacogenomics
Often used synonymously with pharmacogenetics, but also used to refer to polygenic strategies within pharmacogenetics.

### Germline polymorphism
The existence of two or more variants of a gene locus (alleles, sequence variants or chromosomal structural variants) at significant frequencies (usually > 1%) in the population.

It is hard to imagine a therapeutic class that could benefit more from pharmacogenomics than cancer chemotherapy. Anticancer agents are generally toxic, are often given at doses near those that produce toxicity, show wide inter-patient variability in disposition and effects, and should be given at optimal doses for the best chance of cure. Pharmacogenomics is beginning to provide molecular diagnostics to guide the individualization of cancer chemotherapy to reduce toxicity and increase efficacy.

The use of combination chemotherapy to cure **acute lymphoblastic leukaemia** (ALL) in children emerged in the 1980s as a paradigm for curing disseminated cancers. Similarly, elucidation of the pharmacogenomics of ALL and its translation to the clinic exemplifies how pharmacogenomics can be used to optimize chemotherapy of human cancers<sup>1,2</sup>.

Over the past 4 decades, treatment of ALL in children has improved dramatically, with long-term event-free survival ('cure') increasing from less than 10% in the 1960s to more than 80% today<sup>3</sup>. ALL accounts for about 25% of all cancers in children, and despite the remarkable progress in treatment of ALL, cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease in children between 1 and 15 years of age in the USA, with leukaemia continuing to cause the highest proportion (33%) of these deaths. Advances in cure rates are largely attributable to the identification of prognostic features (to detect patients who are at high risk of treatment failure), to the intensification of combination chemotherapy (especially for patients with high-risk prognostic features), to improvements in treatment of disease in the CNS, and to improved supportive care (for example, antibiotics and antifungals). All modern ALL-treatment regimens, such as that outlined in TABLE 1a and TABLE 1b, comprise multiple antileukaemic agents for which there is growing evidence that deeper insights into the pathogenesis of leukaemia, the mechanisms of drug resistance and the genetic determinants of drug response will lead to increased efficacy and decreased toxicity of ALL chemotherapy<sup>4</sup>.

The genetics of leukaemia and normal cells currently has an important role in determining the optimal treatment of childhood ALL. This is because ALL is a genetically heterogeneous disease that is caused by aberrant gene fusions or inappropriate expression of oncogenes, and the prognosis for cure differs significantly among these genetic subtypes<sup>5,6</sup> (BOX 1). Germline polymorphisms in patients with ALL can alter drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters or drug targets, and can thereby influence the efficacy or toxicity (or both) of antileukaemic agents<sup>7–9</sup>. However, germline genotypes are only rarely used to individualize ALL treatment today. It is anticipated that identification of additional genes that are associated with altered drug-response and combined drug-response phenotypes might provide mechanistic insights into the pharmacological basis of *de novo* or acquired drug resistance.

Traditionally, pharmacogenetic studies have focused on single gene candidates identified on the basis of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a specific drug, on the basis of variability in drug response (for example,

## Pharmacogenetics

Focuses on the inherited variability in drug targets, target pathways, drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, transport and elimination, or in genes that indirectly influence drug response, and how these genetic variations influence drug-response phenotypes.

### At a glance

- Germline polymorphisms are known to influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects of a growing number of anticancer agents.
- Polymorphisms in the human thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) gene lead to loss of the functional protein and predispose with high penetrance to severe haematopoietic toxicity in TPMT-deficient patients, unless their dose of mercaptopurine is reduced by 90–95%.
- Candidate-gene strategies have shown that germline polymorphisms in additional genes — such as the glutathione S-transferase genes, the uridine-5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyl-transferase genes and the thymidylate synthetase gene — are associated with the efficacy or toxicity of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
- Recently, distinct gene-expression profiles of primary ALL cells have been linked to the sensitivity of leukaemia cells to several antileukaemic agents in vitro, and these expression signatures also predicted treatment outcome.
- These findings provide momentum for future genome-wide studies to identify additional genomic determinants of ALL-treatment responses. These will allow the development of polygenic models that can be used to optimize the treatment of ALL and other human cancers.

exaggerated toxicity or drug resistance), or both. The term pharmacogenomics is increasingly being used to describe a broader strategy to identify the entire set of genes that are relevant to the pharmacological effects of a given medication. This strategy includes identifying the effects of genetic variation in individual genes, assessing the interactions among gene products in biological and pharmacological pathways, and characterizing the drug-response phenotypes that emerge from these polygenic traits. Although pharmacogenomics has the potential to optimize drug therapy for individual patients¹⁰, it will never explain all of the differences in drug effects, given the large number of non-genetic factors that influence drug responses (for example, drug–drug interactions, environmental factors, and a patient’s age, sex, disease state and organ function).

The growing body of knowledge about childhood ALL represents one of the most well-developed areas of cancer pharmacogenomics, although there is an increasing amount of knowledge for many adult cancers as well¹¹,¹². In this review, we summarize recent progress and anticipated advances in the pharmacogenomics of ALL and discuss how further translation of these findings promises to improve the treatment of paediatric ALL. We also highlight strategies for overcoming these and other challenges in the future.

### Single-gene pharmacogenetics

Treatment response can be altered by polymorphisms in single genes encoding enzymes that metabolize (and thereby typically inactivate) chemotherapeutic agents that are used to treat ALL. This is illustrated by two extensively studied examples: thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs).

#### Thiopurine methyltransferase

TPMT catalyses the S-methylation of mercaptopurine and other thiopurine medications (for example, thioguanine) that are used to treat ALL, and the TPMT pathway is the principal mechanism of intracellular inactivation of thiopurines in haematopoietic tissues¹³,¹⁴ (FIG. 1).

The link between polymorphisms in TPMT and mercaptopurine toxicity is one of the best-studied examples in pharmacogenetics. In 1980, the polymorphic activity of TPMT was observed in normal volunteers¹⁵,¹⁶, followed by family studies that revealed autosomal co-dominant inheritance of TPMT phenotypes and clinical studies that linked TPMT deficiency with the haematopoietic toxicity of thiopurines¹⁷. These findings were followed by the discovery of the polymorphisms that are responsible for inherited differences in TPMT activity¹⁸–²¹, permitting the development of genetic tests to identify

patients who require significant dose reductions to avoid life-threatening toxicity²².

Although 17 variant alleles have been identified to date, 3 variant alleles (*TPMT*2, *TPMT*3A and *TPMT*3C) (FIG. 2a) account for >95% of low or intermediate TPMT enzyme activity¹³,¹⁴,²²⁻²⁴ (FIG. 2b). About 90% of individuals have two wild-type *TPMT* alleles (*TPMT*1) and high enzyme activity, about 10% of individuals inherit one wild-type *TPMT* allele and one non-functional variant allele and have intermediate activity, and the rare (1 in 300) person who inherits two non-functional variant alleles is completely TPMT-deficient²²,²⁴⁻²⁶.

Patients with very high TPMT activity might be at higher risk of ALL-treatment failure because high TPMT activity results in greater drug inactivation and lower exposure of leukaemia cells to the active thiopurines; these patients might benefit from higher doses of thiopurines¹⁴,¹⁷,²⁷,²⁸. By contrast, patients with inherited TPMT deficiency are exposed to more of the active drug and accumulate excessive cellular concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides, especially in haematopoietic tissues (FIG. 3a). This predisposes patients to severe haematopoietic toxicity²⁹⁻³¹, which can be fatal³² if TPMT-deficient patients are given conventional doses of mercaptopurine or other thiopurine drugs²⁹,³³. Patients who are heterozygous at the *TPMT* locus are at intermediate risk of dose-limiting toxicity³¹ and might require a modest dose reduction of approximately 35–50%, whereas TPMT-deficient patients require a dose reduction of >90% (FIG. 3b). Furthermore, when mercaptopurine doses that are given to TPMT-deficient patients are not adjusted, severe haematopoietic toxicity also requires the discontinuation of other cytotoxic agents until the absolute neutrophil count recovers, which might compromise overall treatment efficacy. Once the thiopurine dose is appropriately adjusted, these patients can generally tolerate full doses of their other ALL chemotherapeutic agents — a situation that is generally associated with greater therapeutic efficacy. However, TPMT deficiency has also been linked to a higher risk of second malignancies among patients with ALL, including therapy-related **acute myeloid leukaemia** (AML) (which is induced by topoisomerase II inhibitors)³⁴⁻³⁶ and radiation-induced brain tumours³⁷.

Recently, the *TPMT* genotype was linked to early ALL treatment response, which was determined by measuring minimal residual disease (MRD) on day 78 after remission-induction therapy that included mercaptopurine for 4 weeks (REF. 28). It is interesting that patients with 2 functional *TPMT* alleles had a 2.9-fold higher risk of positive MRD than did *TPMT*-heterozygous patients. This is consistent with higher systemic exposure to thiopurines as a result of lower mercaptopurine metabolism in heterozygous patients. It remains to be determined whether dose escalation in patients with wild-type *TPMT* would yield greater efficacy in protocols that routinely use lower mercaptopurine doses (50–60 mg m⁻² day⁻¹ versus 75 mg m⁻² day⁻¹).

Minimal residual disease  
Tumour cells remaining in patients after treatment (for example, surgical debulking, chemotherapy or radiotherapy), often at submicroscopic levels.

Dose escalation  
The administration of successively higher doses of drug to a cohort of patients until a subset of these patients experience unacceptable side effects. The highest dose at which patients do not experience serious side effects is the maximum tolerated dose.

Box 1 | Genetic subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

**T-lineage ALL**

T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) accounts for ~15% of ALL cases in children and is commonly considered a high-risk feature. Additionally, T-lineage ALL can be subdivided by T-cell genotype: T-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia 1 (TAL1) (58%), homeobox (HOX) genes (27%), lymphoblastic-leukaemia-derived sequence 1 (LYL1) (12%) and mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) (3%).

**B-lineage ALL**

In children, 85% of ALL cases are of B-lineage origin, and about 80% of these can be further classified by cytogenetics and characteristic genetic translocations:

- **t(9;22)(q34;q11)**  
  Translocation of parts of chromosomes 9 and 22 to create the BCR–ABL fusion, also called the Philadelphia chromosome. This genetic abnormality occurs in about 3% of ALL cases in children and is associated with an unfavourable prognosis.

- **t(1;19)(q23;p13.3)**  
  The $E2A-PBX1$ fusion occurs in about 5% of ALL in children, but might not affect prognosis.

- **t(4;11)(q21;q23)**  
  The rearrangement that involves MLL on chromosome 11 is the most common genetic abnormality in ALL cells in children younger than 1 year of age (85% of cases), and in all children with ALL the frequency of this abnormality is about 5%. The AF4 gene on chromosome 4 is most often the fusion partner, but about 40 different partners have been shown to fuse with MLL. Any rearrangement of MLL is commonly considered a high-risk feature in ALL.

- **t(12;21) (p13;q22)**  
  The t(12;21) translocation creates the TEL–AML1 fusion, the most common genetic abnormality in childhood ALL (about 22% of cases), and it is associated with a relatively favourable prognosis in most treatment protocols.

**Hyperdiploidy**

This is defined as ALL cells with more than 50 chromosomes. Hyperdiploidy is a relatively favourable prognostic feature and is found in about 25% of all cases of paediatric ALL.

The three signature single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the predominant non-functional TPMT allele identify >95% of TPMT-variant alleles, and this molecular diagnostic test has been available from reference laboratories since 2003. At our institution, TPMT genotypes are routinely determined before mercaptopurine administration, although the test is still not routinely used in many centres^{22,38,39}.

**Glutathione S-transferases.** Isoenzymes of the GST superfamily inactivate many electrophilic endogenous substances and xenobiotics — including antileukaemic agents such as cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines, topoisomerase II inhibitors, and their oxidative metabolites — by conjugation to glutathione. Their typical function is to detoxify reactive metabolites, but their role in the formation of cytotoxic metabolites has also been documented^{40–42}. Enzymes of the GST family — mainly those of the sub-families GSTµ, GSTτ and GSTπ — have been associated with increased cancer incidence, therapy-related cancers and toxicity following chemotherapy^{40–42}. Some GST polymorphisms have also been associated with chemotherapeutic efficacy, although this seems to be treatment-specific^{43–49}. The human genes that encode GSTs are highly polymorphic, and a homozygous deletion (GST-null genotype) of $GSTM1$ or $GSTT1$ is present in about 50% or 25%, respectively, of most populations^8.

In studies of paediatric patients with ALL and adult patients with AML, neither GST-null genotype (alone or combined) was associated with the occurrence of therapy-related AML^{42,50}. In another study, however, the low-activity polymorphism $GSTP1*B$

Figure 1 | The thiopurine pathway. After uptake, mercaptopurine is converted through the salvage pathway into thioguanine monophosphate (TIMP) by hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT1), with 5-phospho-D-ribose-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), a component of the de novo purine-synthesis (DNPS) pathway, as the phosphoribosyl donor. TIMP is converted first into thioxanthine monophosphate (TXMP), then to thioguanosine monophosphate (TGMP). Subsequently, TGMP can be converted into thioguanosine diphosphate (TGDP) and triphosphate (TGTP). Cytotoxic effects occur when deoxyTGTP or TGTP are incorporated into DNA or RNA, respectively, and when DNPS is inhibited, specifically when phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) is inhibited by methyl thionosine monophosphate (meTIMP). DNPS results in the production of the precursor purines inosine monophosphate (IMP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and, finally, inosine and adenosine. The inactivation of mercaptopurine, which is catalysed by xanthine oxidase (XDH) or the polymorphic thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), competes with the synthesis of the active metabolites of mercaptopurine (the thioguanine nucleotides TGDP and TGTP). Drugs and drug metabolites are indicated in yellow, transporters in pink, enzymes in green and cellular metabolites in blue. Figure modified with permission from REF. 115 © PharmGKB (2004).

Recently, it was reported that the GSTT1-null genotype is linked to a favourable early response to prednisolone in children with ALL<sup>52</sup>, and to a reduced risk of relapse<sup>44</sup>. By contrast, in a small study of ALL in Japanese children, those with the double-null (GSTM1 and GSTT1) genotypes were at higher risk of early ALL relapse<sup>49</sup>. However, in studies of largely non-Asian children with ALL, neither the GSTM1-null genotype nor the GSTT1-null genotype alone predicted treatment outcome<sup>40,48,53</sup>, although the GSTM1-null genotype seemed to protect against CNS relapse<sup>40</sup>. The importance of GST genotypes is probably treatment-specific and might also be influenced by other genotypes when considered in the context of a polygenic model<sup>54</sup>.

### Genes from candidate pathways

The biological and pharmacological pathways of two widely used antileukaemic agents, methotrexate and mercaptopurine, are used to illustrate the potential of a ‘candidate-pathway’ approach to identify genes and polymorphisms that influence the response to ALL chemotherapy. The main advantages of this strategy are that it combines information on several genes that are common in a pathway and it minimizes the ‘noise’ of a non-targeted genome-wide approach (see next section), although it probably excludes some genes of importance.

#### Thiopurines

The thiopurine drugs mercaptopurine and thioguanine are analogues of the purine nucleosides hypoxanthine and guanine, respectively, and one (or both) is an important component of essentially all protocols for the treatment of ALL (TABLE 1).

Cellular uptake of the parent thiopurine medications seems to be achieved partly through nucleoside transporters (for example, SLC23A and SLC29A), with subsequent metabolism mainly through phosphoribosylation and S-methylation in haematopoietic cells (FIG. 1). Phosphoribosylation activates mercaptopurine through the purine-salvage pathway to thioguanine nucleotides, the principal active metabolites<sup>55</sup>. The first essential activation step is catalysed by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (**HPRT**), but neither mercaptopurine resistance nor relapse in ALL patients has been associated with inherited differences in **HPRT**<sup>56</sup>.

Gene-expression profiles of primary ALL cells at the time of diagnosis have shown an inverse correlation between the baseline level of expression of the nucleoside transporter **SLC29A1** and thioguanine accumulation after mercaptopurine treatment, and inhibition of this transporter caused about 40% reduction of thioguanine levels in ALL cells<sup>57</sup>. This is consistent with results from the NCI60 panel of cell lines, in which baseline expression of SLC29A1 was negatively correlated with growth inhibition by these medications<sup>58</sup>.

The most abundant S-methylated mercaptopurine metabolite, methylthioguanine monophosphate, can inhibit phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase, an essential enzyme in the de novo purine-synthesis (DNPS) pathway. Inhibition of DNPS can lead to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death.

(A1578G, resulting in an Ile>Val substitution in the binding domain of the enzyme) was overrepresented in therapy-related AML compared with *de novo* AML cases in adults<sup>43</sup>. The GSTP1*B* polymorphism has been associated with faster etoposide clearance in African-American children with ALL who were also given steroids as part of their ALL therapy. This finding is consistent with low-activity GST resulting in higher steroid exposure and, therefore, greater steroid-induced etoposide metabolism<sup>47</sup>. In the absence of steroid treatment, a homozygous GSTP1*B* genotype was associated with better treatment outcome<sup>48</sup> and with reduced incidence of CNS relapse in patients with intermediate- or high-risk ALL<sup>51</sup>, putatively due to increased exposure to chemotherapy.

#### Purine-salvage pathway

The synthesis of nucleotides from purine bases, which are recycled to produce the corresponding nucleotides after phosphoribosylation. A key enzyme in this pathway is hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.

Figure 3 | Effects of thiopurine methyltransferase polymorphisms on the pharmacogenetics of mercaptopurine toxicity. When mercaptopurine (MP) treatment is given to a cohort of patients, dosing can be uniform (a) (that is, conventional doses of 200 mg m⁻² week⁻¹ are given to all patients) or individualized according to the patient’s genotype (b). Given conventional doses of mercaptopurine (a, left panel), thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)-deficient patients (v/v; pink) show a markedly (tenfold) higher systemic exposure (a, middle panel) to active thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) than do wild-type patients (wt/wt; green), and heterozygous patients (wt/v; blue) show about twofold higher TGN concentrations. The higher concentrations of TGN translate into a significantly higher frequency of haematopoietic toxicity (a, right panel). When genotype-specifically adjusted doses are given in an individualized therapeutic regimen (b, left panel), similar cellular TGN concentrations are achieved in all patients (b, middle panel), and all three TPMT phenotypes can be treated without acute toxicity (b, right panel).

In B-lineage ALL cells, the rate of DNPS is about threefold higher in those without than in those with the TEL–AML1 fusion⁵⁹. When the expression of 82 genes that are involved in the purine metabolic pathway was assessed for their relation to the rate of DNPS in leukaemia cells from children with B-lineage ALL, expression of 16 of these genes differed significantly between TEL–AML1-positive and TEL–AML1-negative ALL. Only two of the purine-pathway genes had previously been identified as characteristic of TEL–AML1-positive ALL⁵⁹,⁶⁰. It will be important to determine whether modulation of expression of these genes alters the sensitivity of ALL cells to agents that inhibit DNPS⁵⁹,⁶¹,⁶².

Methotrexate. Folates are essential co-factors in purine and pyrimidine synthesis⁶³, and the structural analogue methotrexate inhibits specific steps in these pathways (FIG. 4). The main mechanism by which methotrexate and natural folates enter cells is through the reduced folate carrier (RFC, also known as SLC19A1), especially when low-dose methotrexate (20–180 mg m⁻²) is given. Mutant SLC19A1 in tumour cell lines can lead to impaired methotrexate transport and drug resistance⁶⁴,⁶⁵, but these genetic variants have not been found in primary ALL cells. However, a common polymorphism of SLC19A1 (G80A; Arg>His) has been associated with altered folate levels⁶⁶, higher methotrexate plasma concentrations, and increased relapse rates in childhood ALL⁶⁷. Interestingly, the G80A SNP has not been associated with altered SLC19A1 function in any model system to date, leaving uncertainty about its effects on methotrexate distribution⁶⁸. Higher expression of SLC19A1 in leukaemia cells was related to better outcome in children with ALL who were given relatively low doses of methotrexate⁶⁹. Hyperdiploid ALL cells (~25% of cases) almost always have extra copies of chromosome 21 (where SLC19A1 is located) and therefore show higher expression of SLC19A1 and greater intracellular accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamate (MTXPG). However, this effect was significant only in patients given low-dose methotrexate and not in those given high-dose methotrexate, consistent with low-dose methotrexate being more dependent on SLC19A1 for cellular uptake⁷⁰,⁷¹.

Figure 4 | The folate pathway. Methotrexate enters cells through the reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1) or other transport systems. Its main intracellular target is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), inhibition of which results in accumulation of dihydrofolate (DHF) and depletion of cellular folates. Cytosolic folylpolyglutamyl synthase (FPGS) adds glutamate residues to methotrexate to produce methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPGs). Because these larger and more hydrophilic metabolites are not substrates of folate-transport systems, they are retained by the cell, and the resulting increase in the intracellular MTXPG concentration increases the efficacy of methotrexate. The addition of glutamate residues to methotrexate also increases its affinity for other target enzymes (that is, thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) and enzymes of the de novo purine-synthesis pathway: phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GART), and IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC)). Other enzymes that are indirectly affected by methotrexate are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1).

Methotrexate is a substrate for intracellular folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), which catalyses the formation of MTXPGs, which inhibit multiple target enzymes of thymidylate and DNPS. FPGS polymorphisms have not been definitively linked to methotrexate metabolism.

Cleavage of MTXPG to methotrexate by lysosomal γ-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) is the degradation pathway for MTXPG. A SNP in GGH (C452T; Thr>Ile) has been associated with MTXPG accumulation in ALL cells and with 67% lower catalytic activity in the degradation of long-chain MTXPG(4–6), but not short-chain MTXPG(2–3) (REF. 72). Acquisition of an additional chromosome 8 containing a wild-type GGH allele causes higher GGH catalytic activity in ALL cells²⁶.

A genetic variant with a triple repeat in the promoter region of the gene that encodes thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), another important target of methotrexate, is associated with higher TYMS expression and an increased risk of treatment failure in children with ALL⁵⁴,⁷³. However, a separate, matched case-control study did not confirm this finding, possibly because high-dose methotrexate can overcome the effects of the higher TYMS expression⁷⁴.

More recently, a candidate-gene approach was used to assess 16 common loci in 13 candidate genes in 246 children with ALL, using a polygenic model to determine the association of these genes with treatment outcome. In patients with high-risk ALL, the GSTM1 non-null genotype was associated with a significantly greater risk of haematological relapse after treatment that included etoposide and cyclophosphamide, both of which are GST substrates. The risk was higher again in patients who had the triple-repeat genotype that is associated with high expression of the TYMS gene. Greater metabolism (inactivation) of crucial treatment components in patients expressing GSTM1 (that is, non-null genotype) might increase the importance of methotrexate as a treatment component, which will mean that the TYMS genotype becomes more crucial⁵⁴. Importantly, the genotypes that were examined in this study were significant in a multivariate analysis that included known risk factors for ALL (that is, white-blood-cell count, ALL subtype and MRD).

Another important enzyme in the folate/methotrexate metabolism pathway is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (**MTHFR**). About 10% of Caucasians show a genotypic variant of *MTHFR* (C677T; Ala>Val), which encodes a protein with about 30% of the wild-type activity. Heterozygotes (40% of the population) have approximately 60% enzyme activity^{75,76}. This SNP has been linked to hepatotoxicity following methotrexate treatment^{77}, which might be overcome by supplementation with folic acid, a routine practice after treatment with high-dose methotrexate. Another lower-activity *MTHFR* variant results from the A1298C (Glu>Ala) SNP, which has been linked to leukaemia susceptibility^{78,79} but not to altered effects of methotrexate in leukaemia^{80}.

To identify additional candidate genes that influence the accumulation of MTXPG in ALL cells, the expression of 32 genes that are related to the folate pathway (FIG. 4) was assessed in ALL cells from children treated with high-dose methotrexate (1000 mg m⁻²). Hyperdiploid B-lineage ALL cells accumulate higher levels of MTXPGs than do non-hyperdiploid B-lineage ALL, T-lineage ALL and *E2A–PBX1*-positive ALL cells (BOX 1); *E2A–PBX1*-positive cells accumulate the lowest levels of MTXPGs^{81,82}. Lower expression of FPGS and higher expression of the ABC transporter (ATP-binding-cassette transporter) ABCC1 were found in T-lineage ALL, indicating two mechanisms for lower MTXPG accumulation in this ALL subtype^{71,81,83}. By contrast, low accumulation of MTXPG in ALL cells with either the *TEL–AML1* or *E2A–PBX1* fusions was related to higher expression of the gene that encodes the export pump ABCG2 or low expression of the gene that encodes the influx carrier SLC19A1, respectively. Differences in expression of these genes offer new insights into mechanisms of methotrexate resistance and point to subtype-specific strategies to circumvent the problem of low intracellular-MTXPG accumulation in different ALL subtypes^{71}.

These studies of candidate-pathway genes illustrate the potential importance of SNP–SNP and gene–gene interactions (for example, methotrexate in TABLE 2).

Such interactions might be of particular importance for genes that have low penetrance or only a slight influence on drug disposition or response, such that when several interactions occur in the same pathway, the combined effect becomes clinically significant.

### Genome-wide approach

Recent work indicates that global gene-expression profiling using DNA microarrays can identify genes with levels of expression that are related to drug response. An advantage of this strategy is that it includes all genes of potential importance and, therefore, might identify new therapeutic and diagnostic targets. Its disadvantage is that, as a non-targeted genome-wide approach, it is influenced by ‘noise’ (that is, expression signals of irrelevant genes) and increases the number of false positives (that is, unimportant genes that are identified by chance). Identification of genes on the basis of mRNA expression relative to drug response is complementary to the identification of SNPs in genes that alter protein function and drug response. Moreover, this might lead to the identification of SNPs that are associated with altered mRNA expression of genes associated with drug response.

ALL is an ideal model system in which to assess global gene expression in cancer, because it is a ‘liquid’ tumour and therefore relatively homogeneous within a patient, and because it is easy to isolate and characterize. Several pioneering global-gene-expression studies were first conducted in ALL and showed that specific subtypes of leukaemia have distinct gene-expression patterns (that is, AML and ALL have different patterns, as do different subtypes of ALL (BOX 1)). Accurate subtype classification is important because these subtypes of leukaemia differ in treatment response and outcome, a finding that is now widely used to guide treatment. Robust gene-expression profiling for diagnosis and classification of childhood ALL might ultimately represent a less labour-intensive and more automated alternative to the multiple methods that are currently used (for example, immunochemistry, cytogenetics and molecular diagnostics)^{84–88}.

**ABC transporters**

Transmembrane proteins that transport a wide variety of substrates (for example, metabolites, lipids, sterols and drugs). Overexpression can lead to drug-resistant cancer. There are 48 known human ABC transporters in 7 distinct subfamilies.

**Penetrance**

The proportion of individuals who develop a phenotype when they inherit a polymorphism that is associated with this phenotype. If a polymorphism has complete penetrance, the phenotype is present in all carriers, whereas reduced or incomplete penetrance exists if the phenotype is not always present.

Primary ALL cells

Gene-expression profile

Treatment outcome

Figure 5 | A gene-expression profile that is associated with drug sensitivity. A large set of primary acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells are subjected to gene-expression analysis and in vitro sensitivity to individual medications to identify gene-expression patterns that are related to in vitro drug sensitivity and potentially to treatment outcome. After prospective validation, these gene-expression patterns might identify patients at high risk of treatment failure and treatment can subsequently be adjusted. In addition, by linking genes to resistance to individual anticancer agents, this might provide insights into the mechanisms of resistance and point to strategies for overcoming drug resistance.

Studies of leukaemia-cell gene-expression patterns might also reveal new prognostic features and therapeutic targets. For instance, gene profiles might ultimately be able to identify children for whom therapy is likely to fail (that is, those who will experience relapse) or those who are at high risk of therapy-induced second cancers^{60,89–91}. Therapy-related AML in adults who had previously had ALL has been identified as a heterogeneous disease by global-gene-expression studies. Three subgroups showed specific patterns of up- and down-regulated genes, and potential treatment options were proposed according to the different pathways affected^{92} — for example, high expression of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (**FLT3**) was shown in one subgroup. FLT3 overexpression was also found in leukaemia cells from patients with *de novo* mixed-lineage leukaemia (*MLL*)-rearranged and hyperdiploid ALL, which led to the evaluation of the FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701. This agent was highly growth-inhibitory in ALL cell lines and primary ALL cells that overexpressed FLT3 (REF. 93). Although the clinical utility of FLT3 inhibitors remains to be defined, this illustrates the potential for genome-wide gene-expression analysis to reveal possible drug targets that might be ALL-subtype-specific^{59,61,62}. Another gene-expression study in ALL cells identified genes with levels of expression that differed depending on whether irradiation-induced brain tumours developed after otherwise successful ALL therapy in these children^{94}. This finding indicates that in addition to tissue-specific gene expression, germline-driven gene expression across different tissues might predict second malignancy following antileukaemic treatment.

In most cases, gene-expression profiles that have been associated with treatment outcome have yet to be independently verified. Conflicting results arise largely because of differences in patient populations, the analysis platforms and, most importantly, the treatment given. However, ALL subtype classification (for example,

Gene-expression patterns, ALL drug resistance and treatment response. Among many unanswered questions is whether the expression of specific genes is associated with ALL drug resistance (FIG. 5). If so, then why are these genes intrinsically expressed at different levels in treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant ALL? To address these questions, genome-wide assessments of gene expression have been used to identify gene-expression patterns that are significantly associated with sensitivity or resistance to individual antileukaemic agents^{58,95–97}. This work began in human tumour cell lines^{58,95} but has moved rapidly to the assessment of primary ALL cells^{96,97}.

To elucidate mechanisms of resistance to antileukaemic agents, gene-expression patterns that differ significantly in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ALL cells have been compared^{96}. This study revealed a distinct set of genes that is associated with drug resistance for each of four structurally different and widely used antileukaemic agents (prednisolone, vincristine, L-asparaginase and daunorubicin). There was very little overlap among genes associated with resistance to these four agents, indicating that there are different resistance mechanisms for each of the four agents. The concept that ALL cells might have different drug-resistance profiles in different individuals and within the same ALL subtype (for example, not all MLL-rearranged ALLs are resistant) supports the use of multi-agent combination chemotherapy for this disease. Importantly, these gene-expression patterns were also significantly related to treatment response in a multivariate

uridine-5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1*28), which is associated with higher activity of this enzyme, and/or the GSTM1-null genotype, had a pattern of gene expression that was distinct from patients with wild-type genotypes for these two germline polymorphisms<sup>98</sup>. Ongoing studies are focusing on germline polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of genes with expression that has been associated with drug resistance of ALL to determine whether germline polymorphisms are important determinants of drug resistance.

Mechanisms of drug action. Changes in gene expression in ALL cells after treatment with specific agents is another approach to gaining insights into the mechanisms of action of anticancer agents<sup>99</sup>. This has also been used as a strategy to screen candidate small molecules as potential new agents and might prove useful for early dose-finding studies of experimental compounds<sup>100,101</sup>. One study related initial resistance and later relapse (6–12 weeks after the end of therapy) to gene expression at diagnosis and gene-expression changes during imatinib treatment of BCR–ABL-positive ALL (t(9;22), BOX 1) *in vivo*, and identified genes that predict sensitivity<sup>102</sup>. A study of gene-expression changes in primary ALL cells taken from patients 42 hours after initial treatment showed that the pattern of changes in gene expression differed significantly depending on the initial treatment (high-dose methotrexate alone, high-dose methotrexate with mercaptopurine, low-dose methotrexate with mercaptopurine, or mercaptopurine alone). The expression of many genes changed after patients were given methotrexate with mercaptopurine, but this set of genes was different from the combined set of genes that changed after treatment with these agents alone. This finding indicates that the effects of combination therapy are not simply the sum of the effects of each single agent<sup>99,103</sup>. Although combination chemotherapy is essential to cure childhood ALL and is used to treat most other disseminated cancers, the selection of drug combinations has been largely empirical. A genome-wide assessment of treatment-induced changes in gene expression represents an additional strategy for understanding the effects of combination chemotherapy<sup>99</sup>.

Global SNP detection. Another global genomics approach, the oligonucleotide SNP array, has recently become available<sup>104</sup>. This approach was used to investigate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 10 children with ALL, using the 10K SNP array (11,555 SNPs)<sup>105</sup>. By comparing the LOH patterns at various time points, LOH was found only in the tumour (at diagnosis and at relapse, but not in normal leukocytes during remission) or only at relapse, indicating an association with treatment resistance or disease progression. A region on chromosome 9p was the most common site for LOH (21% of cases), consistent with a separate study that analysed 31 microsatellite markers<sup>106</sup>. This chromosomal region contains the tumour suppressor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A, also known as INK4A and p16), loss of which has been associated with tumour progression<sup>107</sup>. Future pharmacogenomic studies with

the newer-generation SNP arrays (for example, 500,000 SNPs) and larger cohorts of patients have the potential to identify additional polymorphisms and genes that are associated with ALL-treatment response⁹.

### Future directions

Pharmacogenomics holds great promise for improving leukaemia treatment (that is, reducing toxicity and increasing efficacy) by facilitating optimal treatment selection, appropriate dose individualization, and drug discovery. Such improvement has already been shown for mercaptopurine, and is almost certain to be important for other chemotherapeutic agents¹⁰⁸ and for medications that are used in the supportive care of patients with ALL. Primary ALL cells have proved highly amenable to gene-expression analyses, and such studies have revealed many new insights into the pathobiology and pharmacogenomics of this disease. These promising findings in ALL are fueling the application of similar technologies to many solid tumours in children and adults¹⁰⁹–¹¹², using laser-capture microdissection to isolate tumour tissue from surrounding normal tissue. Finally, because curative ALL therapy depends on the use of several anticancer agents in combination, and treatment is now successful in over 80% of patients, it provides a good model of combination chemotherapy for disseminated cancer in which responders and non-responders can be compared at the genomic level to identify determinants of treatment efficacy or toxicity.

A significant challenge in pharmacogenomics relates to the fact that most drug responses are influenced by multiple genes (FIG. 6), so polygenic studies and models will be increasingly required to fully elucidate the genetic determinants of drug response⁹. Interactions between genes, SNPs or both will probably be more informative than single-gene variants alone. Future approaches will also use large-scale public genetic databases such as the HapMap project to elucidate linkage of genetic markers and drug effects in different populations, towards the identification of new genes and the elucidation of polygenic determinants of drug responses.

In attempting to establish optimal treatment approaches, another challenge will be to determine how best to integrate genetic information with data on non-genetic causes of inter-patient variability in drug response. It is hoped that proteomic approaches will augment this process by providing insights into gene translation and post-translational modifications that alter drug response.

Another beneficial application of pharmacogenomics will be in the drug-development and drug-discovery process. Genetic profiling and proteomic studies of tumour and normal tissue should facilitate the identification of new targets for anticancer drugs and of previously unrecognized genomic determinants of cancer-drug resistance and host toxicity. Together, these approaches should facilitate further individualization and optimization of treatment and the discovery of novel agents.

Although it is now clear that polymorphisms are important determinants of drug disposition and drug effects in children with ALL, it must be recognized that a specific genotype might be important in determining the effects of a medication in one population or disease subtype but not in another. Therefore, before pharmacogenomics is used to guide treatment it must be extensively validated for each therapeutic indication and treatment context, as well as in different racial and ethnic groups, to ensure the accuracy of an association between polymorphisms and drug response. To this end, the norm should be to obtain genomic DNA from all patients who are enrolled in clinical trials, along with the appropriate consent to permit present and future pharmacogenetic analyses¹¹³, so that knowledge can continue to be generated as new findings emerge.
