Proposed Link Between Cytokines, Nitric Oxide and Human Cerebral Malaria

I.A. Clark, K.A. Rockett and W.B. Cowden

Nitric oxide (NO), also known as endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), is generated by a range of cell types including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and neurons, and mediates a range of different physiological functions, such as maintenance of vascular tone and neurotransmission. In this article, Ian Clark, Kirk Rockett and Bill Cowden propose that when vascular generation of NO is particularly high (for example, if local intravascular levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are markedly increased) this mediator could diffuse to nearby neurons, be misinterpreted as being of synaptic origin and thus interfere with orderly neurotransmission. NO of vascular origin could also, through vasodilation of cerebral vessels, contribute to increased intracranial pressure and thus to certain of the clinical signs seen in cerebral malaria. As well as contributing to cerebral malaria, these phenomena could also lead to the neurological changes observed in certain other systemic diseases.

There is no agreement on the mechanism of human cerebral malaria, since all the current ideas leave major questions unanswered. The conventional explanation is that the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply through the obstruction of small blood vessels by parasitized red blood cells (for review see Ref. 1), but the rarity of residual neurological deficit seen in patients who recover from prolonged cerebral malaria coma makes this mechanism difficult to accept. Even in children, who are more likely to retain neurological deficits, 88% of those examined in a recent large study² had no residual change. An explanation based on more subtle and reversible alterations to neurological function therefore seems called for.

### TNF and Malaria

As reviewed elsewhere (Ref. 3), evidence has accumulated that is consistent with the proposal that the illness and pathology of malaria, including its cerebral manifestations, might, in considerable part, be caused by excessive production of cytokines such as TNF. For example, TNF enhances slow-wave sleep⁴, and the malarial-like side effects observed when tumour patients are treated with low doses of TNF (so small that they induce serum levels much lower than those seen in cerebral malaria) include a degree of neurological involvement⁵. One aspect of these TNF-induced changes relevant to understanding the reversibility of cerebral malaria is that TNF-treated patients regain normal neurological function soon after treatment ceases⁵. This is also reported for the neurological changes seen in patients treated with interleukin 2 (IL-2) (Ref. 6), which induces systemic TNF generation in these individuals⁷.

Several studies of children in malarial areas⁸⁹ have failed to find a correlation between cerebral malaria and serum TNF levels but, inevitably, they have had to contend with variable individual histories of malaria, possibly associated with equally variable TNF tolerance and circulating levels of soluble TNF receptors. In contrast, a study of similar size conducted on adult European patients who had never before been exposed to malaria found that serum TNF levels correlated with disease complexity, and that cerebral malaria was the most consistent component of the multi-organ disease they observed¹⁰. One study in Malawi that reported a correlation between coma and TNF in childhood malaria did not separate severe hypoglycaemia (a possible cause of coma in paediatric malaria and an excellent correlate of TNF in this circumstance¹¹¹²) from normoglycaemic coma¹¹. Serum TNF levels correlated with normoglycaemic cerebral malaria in a subsequent study from The Gambia, which used a sample large enough to overcome the problems of mixed malarial backgrounds¹².

### Cytokines and NO

One of the ways in which cytokines such as TNF could influence neurological function is through their capacity to induce the release of NO from endothelial cells¹³ and vascular smooth muscle¹⁴. NO, or a molecule that can give rise to NO, is now recognized to be the true identity of EDRF, one of the major regulators of vascular tone¹⁵¹⁶. As reviewed by Garthwaite¹⁷¹⁸ and Crossin¹⁹, this molecule is also an essential link in the processes initiated by the activation of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In contrast to NO in other tissues, brain NO evidently is not inducible by cytokines²⁰. NO is evidently released after injection of TNF, since N⁶-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme that generates NO from L-arginine), reverses TNF-induced hypotension²¹. This suggests a possible role for NO in malarial hypotension, a long-recognized phenomenon²² that is a component of the complicated malaria syndrome that correlates with serum TNF levels¹⁰. As well as TNF, both IL-1 (Ref. 12) and, more recently, lymphotoxin (LT) levels (I.A. Clark et al., unpublished) are increased in the serum of patients with falciparum malaria (Fig. 1).

We have found considerable increases in NO generation (measured in plasma as total reactive nitrogen intermediates, or RNI) after injecting TNF, LT or IL-1 into mice, particularly animals with subclinical malaria (K.A. Rockett et al., unpublished). Simultaneous injection of L-NMMA blocked the production of NO, indicating that the RNI detected were derived from arginine. This arginine analogue also inhibits the release of NO from endothelial cells¹³, vascular smooth muscle¹⁴ and brain slices²³, in vitro, and it blocks the increase in brain cyclic GMP (cGMP) caused by agonists of receptors for excitatory amino acids²⁴, in vivo.

### Diffusion of NO

Since NO is a nonpolar gas, it can, like oxygen and carbon dioxide, diffuse freely across cell membranes in an isotropic fashion¹⁵¹⁸. This has been

demonstrated by showing that NO released from skeletal muscle venules can dilate adjacent arterioles²⁵. Similar synapse-to-synapse diffusion of NO has recently been proposed to explain how neural signalling can extend well beyond an interactive pair of neurons and cause a cluster of neurons to fire in unison²⁶. These authors²⁶ and others²⁷,²⁸ have suggested that NO produced within the cortex could, by a similar diffusion, cause relaxation of nearby vascular smooth muscle, thereby bringing about the regionally specific increase in blood flow that accompanies cerebral cortical activity²⁹.

Our suggestion as to how TNF may influence neurological function simply envisages this same isotropic diffusion, but in the opposite (vessel-to-neuron) direction. Normal regulation of brain microvascular tone has been demonstrated, *in vivo*, to involve release of an L-NMMA-sensitive molecule indistinguishable from EDRF (NO) (Ref. 30). NO released in high concentrations from vascular smooth muscle¹⁴ and endothelial cells¹³ under the influence of TNF, LT or IL-1 would, we predict, diffuse across membranes and influence adjacent neurons as if it were coming from a nearby synapse. Such 'nonsense' signals would be expected to disrupt local neurotransmission and thus interfere with neurological function for as long as the intense non-neuronal generation of NO continued.

As has been noted¹⁷, the neuronal death that follows ischaemia and hypoglycaemia is associated with glutamate and cGMP accumulation and is thus conceivably mediated by NO. Recent evidence, *in vitro*, is consistent with this proposal³¹. Additional NO, diffusing across from cytokine-stimulated blood vessels, could contribute to this neuronal death and thus to residual neurological deficit in particularly severe cerebral malaria. Our proposals are consistent with an intact blood-brain barrier, a reported characteristic of patients who survive cerebral malaria³².

**Sequestration and Rosetting of Plasmodium falciparum**

While high serum TNF levels in patients infected with *P. falciparum* are statistically associated with a high chance of succumbing to cerebral malaria¹², the correlation is not absolute. If the concepts outlined in this paper are correct, this incomplete correlation may be attributed, in part, to circulating TNF levels probably giving a poor indication of the concentration within the cerebral

**Increased Intracranial Pressure**

NO is a major regulator of tone in both large³⁸ and small³⁰ cerebral blood vessels, and cytokines can upregulate NO production in endothelial cells of cerebral origin¹³. Thus another possible role for cytokine-induced NO in cerebral malaria is a contribution, through vasodilation of cerebral vessels, to an acute increase in cerebral blood volume. In keeping with the recent proposal by Newton et al.³⁹, this could

vasculature. The best indicator of high local TNF levels (which can induce, in turn, high rates of NO diffusion from endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle) is, in our opinion, likely to be the accumulation of parasitized red blood cells in the cerebral vasculature. A combination of sequestration³³ or rosetting³⁴ of the red blood cells could induce these events and local accumulations of schizonts may not be necessary for cerebral symptoms to develop if the infection is very severe³⁵.

At schizogony, the material liberated from infected erythrocytes includes molecules able to trigger release of TNF⁸,³⁶. The local endothelial cells could be expected to be an excellent source of TNF³⁷ and, along with adjacent vascular smooth muscle¹⁴, of NO (Ref. 13). This non-neuronal NO could diffuse to nearby synapses and confuse normal neurotransmission. Only in this fashion, as distinct from physically obstructing blood flow, can we envisage how sequestered³³ or rosetting³⁴ parasitized red blood cells could contribute to long-term coma from which the patient can recover without stroke-like neurological deficits¹.

Other Infectious Diseases

Diffusion of vascular NO to neurons may also provide an explanation for the neurological changes that can accompany other infections such as severe typhoid⁴⁰, and acute viral diseases including dengue haemorrhagic syndrome⁴¹ and yellow fever⁴². The neurological involvement in these diseases can have a broad range of manifestations but typically does not attain the severity seen in cerebral malaria. This may reflect the absence of a local accumulation of the infectious agent acting as a trigger for TNF within the cerebral vasculature. As in cerebral malaria, the neurological changes accompanying such diseases typically clear without residual functional deficit. Another feature that these viral infections share with severe malaria is hypotension⁴¹,⁴² which, as noted, is

consistent with increased NO (EDRF) generation.

Finally, the concept of TNF-induced NO from extraneural sources being misinterpreted by the brain as genuine neurological signals may also, in a more mild and chronic form, be relevant to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia. TNF, reported to be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid in this condition<sup>43</sup>, can be expected to induce NO release from adjacent vascular smooth muscle<sup>14</sup> and endothelial cells<sup>13</sup>. Microglial cells are of macrophage lineage and, like macrophages<sup>44</sup>, might secrete NO as well as TNF. If NO from these sources began to influence neurons, we could expect these cells to be more sensitive to excitatory amino acids such as N-methyl-D-aspartate, since these agents induce brain slices to generate NO (Ref. 23). Such increased sensitivity has recently been reported (S.A. Lipton et al., abstract*). The temporary reversibility by azidothymidine (AZT) treatment of the early stages of AIDS dementia<sup>45</sup> is consistent with this type of functional derangement, rather than with neuronal damage.

# The Dynamics of Antigenic Variation and Growth of African Trypanosomes

## J.D. Barry and C.M.R. Turner

Antigenic variation in African trypanosomes, which is a simple strategy for survival in the immune host, is rendered complex by its magnitude. For protection from nonspecific immunity and escape from specific immunity, each trypanosome is covered by a replaceable surface coat composed of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which specifies the variable antigen type (VAT) of the trypanosome. Antigenic variation is the process by which the trypanosome switches from one coat to another. Here, David Barry and Michael Turner consider this phenomenon within the context of the course of trypanosome infection.

Trypanosomes display a continually relapsing growth pattern in the blood. Unfortunately, the data from one classic (drug-treated) human case<sup>1,2</sup> seem to have become popularly accepted as representative of all trypanosome infections, leading to the general misconception that the trypanosome parasitaemia is simple, consisting of peaks of regular height and periodicity, each containing just one or a few predominating VATs. On the contrary, there is a great variety of parasitaemic profiles, ranging from a few small, sharp peaks occasionally arising from a background of almost permanent subpatency, to a more complex pattern (Fig. 1 and Ref. 3), where the growth of matched inocula of trypanosomes in two host species is compared. There are major differences in the height, width, number, complexity and timing of the appearance of peaks. These differences are reproducible and occur over a number of species, and are not due to the host species directly influencing, by an inductive rather than a selective process, the order of VAT expression<sup>3</sup>. Intuitively, this variety is not altogether surprising, given the differences in size and physiology among host species and in the varying degrees of co-evolution between parasite-host
