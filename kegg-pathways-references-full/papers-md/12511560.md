From the ‡Department of Biochemistry, Sasaki Institute, Kanda-Surugadai 2-2, and Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) of the Japan Science and Technology Corporation, Kanda-Surugadai 2-3, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-0062, and §Biomolecular Characterization Division, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Hirosawa 2-1, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan

The Galβ1→4(SO₃⁻→6)GlcNAc moiety is present in various N-linked and O-linked glycans including keratan sulfate and 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X, an L-selectin ligand. We previously found β1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) activity in human colonic mucosa, which prefers GlcNAc 6-O-sulfate (6SGN) as an acceptor to non-substituted GlcNAc (Seko, A., Hara-Kuge, S., Nagata, K., Yonezawa, S., and Yamashita, K. (1998) FEBS Lett. 440, 307–310). To identify the gene for this enzyme, we purified the enzyme from porcine colonic mucosa. The purified enzyme had the characteristic requirement of basic lipids for catalytic activity. Analysis of the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme revealed that the purified β4GalT has a similar sequence to human β4GalT-IV. To confirm this result, we prepared cDNA for each of the seven β4GalTs cloned to date and examined substrate specificities using the membrane fractions derived from β4GalT-transfected COS-7 cells. When using several N-linked and O-linked glycans with or without 6SGN residues as acceptor substrates, only β4GalT-IV efficiently recognized 6SGN, keratan sulfate-related oligosaccharides, and Galβ1→3(SO₃⁻→6)GlcNAcβ1→6) GalNAcα1-O-pNP, a precursor for 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X. These results suggested that β4GalT-IV is a 6SGN-specific β4GalT and may be involved in the biosynthesis of various glycoproteins carrying a 6-O-sulfated N-acetyllactosamine moiety.

The Galβ1→4(SO₃⁻→6)GlcNAc structure has been found in N-linked and O-linked glycans of glycoproteins and is involved in various biological events (1, 2). The sulfated disaccharide unit has been believed to be biosynthesized by 6-O-sulfation of non-reducing terminal GlcNAc and, following β1,4-galactosylation, on the basis of the substrate specificities of GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferases (GlcNAc6STs)¹ so far reported (2–11).

glycans (23, 36) and was suggested to be involved in the biosynthesis of tumor-associated N-glycans in concert with $\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (37). Lactosylceramide synthase has been purified from rat brain, and its molecular cloning was performed based on partial amino acid sequences (25). The enzyme is an orthologue of human $\beta 4GalT$-VI (24, 27). $\beta 4GalT$-VII is a $\beta$-Xyl:$\beta 1,4GalT$, equal to galactosyltransferase-I which is involved in the synthesis of the proximal sequence in various glycosaminoglycans, Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow 3Gal\beta 1 \rightarrow 4Xyl\beta 1 \rightarrow$ Ser/Thr (28, 29). Although the substrate specificities of these seven $\beta 4GalTs$ have been extensively studied, it remained unclear which enzymes can act on 6SGN residues in KS, N-linked, and O-linked glycans, and whether or not 6SGN-specific $\beta 4GalT$ is encoded by a novel gene. This issue is important for studying the biological roles of 6-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine-containing glycans including KS and 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X.

In this study, we first purified 6SGN-specific $\beta 4GalT$ from porcine colonic mucosa and partially determined its amino acid sequence. We obtained a sequence similar to human $\beta 4GalT$-IV. Moreover, we isolated cDNA for each of the seven $\beta 4GalTs$ cloned to date, and we introduced expression vectors containing these cDNAs individually into COS-7 cells and prepared membrane fractions to study their substrate specificities. As a result, we found that among the seven $\beta 4GalTs$, $\beta 4GalT$-IV is the only enzyme to efficiently act on KS-related oligosaccharides and GlcNAc-6-O-sulfated core2, a precursor of 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X.

The constructed plasmids were named pcDNA3-$\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{I},-\mathrm{II},-\mathrm{III},-\mathrm{IV},-\mathrm{V},-\mathrm{VI}$, and -VII, respectively, and these sequences were confirmed using an Applied Biosystems PRISM ${ }^{\circledR} 310$ Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems).

Expression of $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalTs}$ in COS-7 Cells—The plasmids ($1 \mu \mathrm{g}$) were transfected into COS-7 cells on $35-\mathrm{mm}$ dishes using Lipofectin Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After $48 \mathrm{~h}$, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the dishes in $10 \mathrm{mM}$ HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) and $0.25 \mathrm{M}$ sucrose, and homogenized. The homogenates were ultracentrifuged at $100,000 \times g$ for $1 \mathrm{~h}$. The precipitated crude membranes were suspended in $20 \mathrm{mM}$ HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) and kept at $-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until use.

Synthesis of Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow 3(S O_{3}^{-} \rightarrow 6 \mathrm{GlcNAc} \beta 1 \rightarrow 6) \mathrm{GalNAcal}-O-p N P(6 S-$ core2-$O$-pNP)—The $6-O$-sulfation of the GlcNAc residue in core2-$O$-pNP was performed by GlcNAc6ST-1 (42). Briefly, $2 \mathrm{ml}$ of reaction mixture containing $0.1 \mathrm{M}$ sodium cacodylate (pH 6.8), $10 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MnCl}_{2}, 0.1 \%(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v})$ digitonin, $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaF}, 2 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Na}_{2}$-ATP, $0.2 \mathrm{mM}$ PAPS, $0.75 \mathrm{mM}$ core2-$O$-pNP, and a membrane fraction prepared from GlcNAc6ST-1-expressing COS-7 cells (11) (the specific activity was $8 \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{h}$ when using $1 \mathrm{mM}$ core2-$O$-pNP and $17 \mu \mathrm{M}$ PAPS) was incubated at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $24 \mathrm{~h}$ and subjected to paper electrophoresis. The product fractions were cut off and extracted with water. The extract was applied on a Sephadex G-25 column $(1.4 \times 68 \mathrm{~cm}$, equilibrated and eluted with EtOH/water, $5: 95(\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{v}))$. The sulfated oligosaccharide fractions were collected and concentrated. Finally, $150 \mathrm{nmol}$ of 6S-core2-$O$-pNP was obtained.

Assay of $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}$ Activity—Twenty $\mu \mathrm{l}$ of reaction mixture consisting of $50 \mathrm{mM}$ HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), $10 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MnCl}_{2}, 0.5 \%(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v})$ Triton X-100, $250 \mu \mathrm{M} \mathrm{UDP}-\mathrm{Gal}, 0.3 \mu \mathrm{M} \mathrm{UDP}-[^{3} \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{Gal}(4.9 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{dpm}), 0.5 \mathrm{mM}$ acceptor substrate, and the membrane fraction approximately diluted was incubated at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $1 \mathrm{~h}$. In the cases of purified porcine 6SGN-specific $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}, 0.5 \%(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v})$ Triton X-100 was replaced by $0.001 \%(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v})$ D-sphingosine and $0.05 \%(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v})$ Triton X-100. The $^{3} \mathrm{H}$-labeled products derived from biGP, 6SGN, GL, Xyl-$O$-pNP, core2-$O$-pNP, 6S-biGP, and KS were purified by paper electrophoresis (pyridine/ acetic acid/water, $3: 1: 387$, pH 5.4). The reaction mixtures in the case of agL2L2, agL2L4, and agLST-b were treated with $1 \mathrm{ml}$ of $0.01 \mathrm{N} \mathrm{HCl}$ at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $10 \mathrm{~min}$, neutralized with $1 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{NaOH}$, concentrated, and subjected to paper electrophoresis. The acid hydrolysis was necessary for the destruction of excess UDP-$[^{3} \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{Gal}$, which moves to a similar position as $^{3} \mathrm{H}$-galactosylated agL2L2 and agL2L4 and for removal of sialic acid residue in the case of agLST-b. After drying, in the cases of neutral substrates, the paper was further developed with a solvent system, pyridine/ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water $(5: 5: 1: 3)$. The paper was monitored for radioactivity with a radiochromatogram scanner, and the $^{3} \mathrm{H}$-labeled products were extracted with water and applied on a RCA-I-agarose column $(0.7 \times 2.5 \mathrm{~cm})$. Elution was started with $4 \mathrm{ml}$ of $10 \mathrm{mM}$ sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), $0.15 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl}$, followed by the same buffer containing $10 \mathrm{mM}$ lactose. The bound fractions (eluted with $10 \mathrm{mM}$ lactose) or retarded fractions were collected and measured for radioactivity. In the case of GlcCer, the reaction mixtures were directly applied on a high performance TLC silica gel plate (Kieselgel $60 \mathrm{~F}_{254}$) (Merck) and developed with a solvent system $(\mathrm{CHCl}_{3} / \mathrm{MeOH} / 0.2 \% \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}, 60: 35: 7)$. After drying, the plates were monitored for radioactivity, and the $^{3} \mathrm{H}$-labeled products were extracted with $\mathrm{CHCl}_{3} / \mathrm{MeOH}(1: 1)$ and counted. The membrane fraction derived from pcDNA3-transfected COS-7 cells (C-MF) was used as a control for intrinsic $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}$ activities. To calculate the amount of exogenous $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}$ activities, values of activities in C-MF were subtracted from those of apparent enzymatic activities obtained under the same conditions. Enzymatic activity values presented here were means of four independent experiments. Standard deviations were less than $5 \%$ in all cases. The concentration of KS was presented as moles of galactose.

Determination of Protein Concentrations—The protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard.

Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Coomassie-stained bands in SDS-PAGE gels were excised and treated with $0.2 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of Achromobacter protease I (a gift from Dr. Masaki, Ibaraki University) (43) at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $12 \mathrm{~h}$ in $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Tris}-\mathrm{HCl}$ (pH 9.0) containing $0.1 \% \mathrm{SDS}$. Peptides gener-

ated were extracted from the gel and separated on columns of DEAE-5PW (2 × 20 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo) and Mightysil RP-18 (2 × 50 mm; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo) connected in series with a model 1100 (Hewlett-Packard) liquid chromatography system. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0–60% solvent B, where solvents A and B were 0.09% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80%(v/v) acetonitrile, respectively. Selected peptides were subjected to Edman degradation using a model 477A automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) connected on-line to a model 120A PTH analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and to a Reflex matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear mode using 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (44) as a matrix.

Northern Blot Analysis—Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot membranes (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The mRNA content in each lane of the Northern blot membrane was normalized to the mRNA expression level of β-actin. 32P-Labeled probe was prepared from the cDNA fragment (excised from pcDNA3-β4GalT-IV by BamHI and EcoRV digestion) with a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics) using [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The membranes were pre-hybridized in ExpressHyb Solution (Clontech) at 68°C for 2 h and then hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe in the same solution at 68°C for 16 h. The Northern blot membranes were washed in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and then in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C. The radioactivity was detected with FLA-2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo).

**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

**Purification of 6SGN-specific β4GalT from Porcine Colonic Mucosa and Its Basic Lipid Requirement for Activity**—We showed previously (12) that a 6SGN-specific β4GalT exists in human colonic mucosa. To purify this enzyme and to isolate a corresponding cDNA based on partial amino acid sequences, we used porcine colonic mucosa as an enzyme source. Porcine colonic mucosa also contained 6SGN-specific β4GalT activity. When the enzyme was purified 2,300-fold by a second UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose column chromatography (Table I), the enzymatic activity disappeared (Fig. 1A). Because such a loss of enzymatic activity has been reported for a glucuronyl-transferase, which requires sphingomyelin for activity in a highly purified state (45), we added various lipid compounds to the enzyme reaction mixtures. As shown in Table II, most of the phospholipids and ceramides had no ability to restore the enzymatic activity, whereas the activity appeared in the presence of D-sphingosine and N,N-dimethylsphingosine. Stearylamine could also restore the activity, whereas octylamine could not, suggesting that basic, lipoidous compounds with long hydrophobic chains are essential at least for the in vitro enzymatic activity. The minimum concentrations of D-sphingosine, N,N-dimethylsphingosine, and stearylamine giving the maximal activity were ~10, 20, and 10 μM, respectively (Fig. 2).

After asialo-agalacto-ovomucin-Sepharose chromatography, 6SGN-specific β4GalT was purified 24,000-fold (Fig. 1B and Table I). We tried further purification by various chromatographic methods but were unsuccessful. The final enzyme fraction

tions contained two major (45kDa and 42kDa) and two minor (59kDa and 52kDa) proteins as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3). Each protein band was digested with a lysine-specific protease, and the peptide fragments were separated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and their amino acid sequence was analyzed. One or two peptide fragments from each band were sequenced (Table III), and the sequences were compared with known protein sequences using the BLAST search system. The band $a$ contained one sequence that is equal to that of human polypeptide:$N$-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-2 (46). The band $b$ contained two sequences that are very similar to that of human $N$-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (47, 48). Because the two enzymes utilize UDP-sugars as donor substrates, they may be co-purified with 6SGN-specific $\beta 4GalT$ by UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose column chromatographies. On the other hand, the bands $c$ and $d$ contained a common peptide sequence, which is similar to that of human $\beta 4GalT$-IV (24, 26). This result suggested that the purified 6SGN-specific $\beta 4GalT$ corresponds to $\beta 4GalT$-IV.

Expression of Seven $\beta 4GalTs$ in COS-7 Cells and Their Substrate Specificities—To confirm that $\beta 4GalT$-IV is 6SGN-specific, and the only 6SGN-specific $\beta 4GalT$ among the seven $\beta 4GalTs$ so far identified, we prepared expression vectors containing each $\beta 4GalT$ cDNA and analyzed substrate specificities using the membrane fractions derived from vector-transfected COS-7 cells. Seven $\beta 4GalT$ genes have been identified within the data bases provided by the human genome project to date (18–29). The membrane fraction derived from vacant pcDNA3-transfected COS-7 cells (C-MF) was used as a control for intrinsic $\beta 4GalT$ activities. C-MF had weak $\beta 4GalT$ activity; the specific activities using biGP, 6SGN, agL2L2, Xyl-$O$-pNP, GL, core2-$O$-pNP, GlcCer, and 6S-core2-$O$-pNP as acceptor substrates were 0.20, 0.34, 0.43, 0.20, 0.12, 0.47, 0, and 0.16 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. To calculate the amount of exogenous $\beta 4GalT$ activities, values derived from C-MF were subtracted from those of the apparent enzymatic activities obtained under the same conditions.

The specific activities of $\beta 4GalT$-I, -II, -III, -IV, -V, -VI, and -VII were 6.6 (using biGP as an acceptor), 3.4 (core2-$O$-pNP), 2.6 (core2-$O$-pNP), 1.5 (6SGN), 1.5 (GlcCer), 0.32 (GlcCer), and 3.7 nmol/min/mg of protein (Xyl-$O$-pNP), respectively. The relative activities of the seven $\beta 4GalTs$ for eight acceptor substrates are summarized in Table IV. Among the seven $\beta 4GalTs$, only $\beta 4GalT$-IV recognized 6SGN as a good acceptor in comparison with biGP and GL, and this profile of $\beta 4GalT$-IV was equal to the substrate specificity of human colonic 6SGN-specific $\beta 4GalT$ previously reported by us (12). The linkage position of $[^{3}H]$Gal in $[^{3}H]$Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow$agL2L2 and ($[^{3}H]$Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow$)6S-core2-$O$-pNP synthesized by $\beta 4GalT$-IV was confirmed to be the C-4 of GlcNAc by RCA-I-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 4), which binds to Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow$4GlcNAc (49). $[^{3}H]$Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow$agL2L2 (Fig. 4B, solid line) and ($[^{3}H]$Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow$)6S-core2-$O$-pNP (Fig. 4C, solid line) bound to the column weaker than ($[^{3}H]$Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow$)core2-$O$-pNP (Fig. 4A). To examine whether the weak binding is caused by the presence of 6-$O$-sulfate, the sulfated products were treated with mild methanolysis (0.05 N HCl/MeOH, 25 °C, 4 h) (50) and applied onto the lectin column. The digests bound to the column and were eluted with 10 mM

lactose (Fig. 4, $B$ and $C$, dotted lines), but the digests flowed through the column by digestion with Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow 4$GlcNAc-specific diplococcal $\beta$-galactosidase (data not shown), showing that ${ }^{[3]}$H]Gal is attached to the C-4 of GlcNAc in the sulfated products. 6SGN was a poor substrate at best for the other $\beta 4GalTs$ (Table IV) even at the lower concentrations, 0.1 or 0.2 mM (data not shown), excluding the possibility that the absence or low level of activity was due to the inhibitory effect of a high concentration of 6SGN; such as has been found in several $\beta 4GalTs$ (34, 51). These results indicated that $\beta 4GalT-IV$ is the only 6SGN-specific enzyme among the seven $\beta 4GalTs$, consistent with the amino acid sequence of the purified porcine 6SGN-specific $\beta 4GalT$ as described above.

$\beta 4GalT-III$ prefers O-linked type core2-O-pNP to N-linked type biGP, whereas $\beta 4GalT-I$ and -II recognize both biGP and core2-O-pNP as good acceptors. It has been shown that $\beta 4GalT-V$ acts on core2 (35) and a specific branching structure of N-linked glycans (36). As shown in Table IV, $\beta 4GalT-V$ could act on GlcCer, similar to $\beta 4GalT-VI$. Recently, Lee et al. (52) reported that $\beta 4GalT-VI$-deficient CHO cells have an ability to synthesize lactosylceramides, and they suggested the existence of a lactosylceramide synthase other than $\beta 4GalT-VI$. $\beta 4GalT-V$ may be the second lactosylceramide synthase.

$\beta 4GalT-IV$ recognizes several 6SGN-containing oligosaccharides as good acceptors (Table V). KS-related oligosaccharides, agL2L2 and agL2L4, were good substrates for $\beta 4GalT-IV$. AgL2L2 was a poor substrate at best for the other $\beta 4GalTs$ (Table IV). KS is also a substrate for $\beta 4GalT-IV$ with a specific activity of 0.045 nmol/min/mg of protein at 1 mM KS. To expose GlcNAc residues at the non-reducing termini of KS chains, we treated KS by mild acid hydrolysis to remove sialic acid and Streptococcus 6646K $\beta$-galactosidase digestion. The enzymatic activity for the asialo-agalacto-KS was 3.3-fold higher than that for intact KS. This result suggests that $\beta 4GalT-IV$ can also act on KS long chains. Because agLST-b was a poor substrate for $\beta 4GalT-IV$, sialic acid cannot replace sulfate at the C-6 of GlcNAc. This substrate selectivity is the same as for human colonic 6SGN-specific $\beta 4GalT$ (12). $\beta 4GalT-IV$ also efficiently acts on 6S-biGP and 6S-core2-O-pNP; the 6SGN moiety is present in N-linked and O-linked glycans in various glycoproteins (1). The 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X on core2 glycans, which is synthesized from 6S-core2 by $\beta 1 \rightarrow 4$-galactosylation, $\alpha 2 \rightarrow 3$-sialylation, and $\alpha 1 \rightarrow 3$-fucosylation, functions as an L-selectin ligand moiety in the early step of lymphocyte homing in lymph nodes (14–17). $\beta 4GalT-IV$ is the only enzyme recognizing 6S-core2-O-pNP as a good substrate among the seven $\beta 4GalTs$ (Table IV), suggesting that $\beta 4GalT-IV$ is involved in the synthesis of 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X.

Results of kinetic analysis of $\beta 4GalT-IV$ for several glycans with or without 6-O-sulfation at GlcNAc are summarized in Table VI. AgL2L4 and 6S-core2-O-pNP had an inhibitory effect on $\beta 4GalT-IV$ activities at high concentrations (Fig. 5), so that kinetic constants were calculated using only the data obtained with lower concentrations of these substrates. The $K_{m}$ value for 6SGN was lower than that for GlcNAc, and the $V_{\text{max}}/K_{m}$ value for 6SGN was 1900-fold higher than that for GlcNAc. Similarly,

the $V_{\text{max}}/K_{m}$ values for 6S-biGP and 6S-core2-O-pNP were much higher than those for biGP and core2-O-pNP, respectively. These results indicate that 6-$O$-sulfation of GlcNAc residues is important for efficient catalytic activity of $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$.

**Expression of $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ in Various Human Tissues—Lo et al. (24) and Schwientek et al. (26) reported the expression profile of $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ in human adult and fetal tissues, but they had not examined its expression in colon or lymph node, where 6SGN-specific $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}$ should be expressed. To clarify the expression pattern more extensively, we analyzed it using commercial Northern blot membranes. As shown in Fig. 6, a 2.4-kb transcript of $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ was expressed ubiquitously. Relatively high expression levels of the enzyme were observed in kidney, placenta, lymph node, prostate, stomach, thyroid, tongue, and trachea. Recently, it has been shown that the 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X determinant is present in colonic mucosa (53); in colon, $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ was also moderately expressed (Fig. 7).**

**General Discussion—In this study, we showed the following. (i) Porcine 6SGN-specific $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}$ was purified and identified as $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$. (ii) The substrate specificities of the seven $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalTs}$ so far cloned were investigated, and $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ is the only 6SGN-specific $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}$ among them and is involved in the synthesis of several 6-$O$-sulfated N-acetyllactosamine glycans. (iii) Porcine $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ requires basic lipidous compounds for the catalytic activity at least in a highly purified state. It has been reported that sphingosine increases several times the enzymatic activities of $\alpha 1 \rightarrow 3$-fucosyltransferase, GM2:$\beta 1 \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{GalT}$, GM3:$\beta 1 \rightarrow 4$-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (54), and glycoprotein sulfotransferase (55) and decreases that of $\beta 1 \rightarrow 3$-glucuronyltransferase (56). However, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that basic lipidous compounds are essential for the catalytic activity of glycosyltransferases. Sphingosine is an intermediate of the metabolism of sphingolipids and a precursor for sphingosine 1-phosphate, a second messenger molecule (reviewed in Refs. 57–59); however, it has been believed that sphingosine is present at quite low levels in living cells. The molecular aspect of the requirement is unclear, but one explanation is that in the process of purification, a certain basic compound, which binds to the enzyme in the crude extract, is detached from the enzyme protein. We are in the process of resolving this issue by analyzing biochemically the binding of recombinant $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ to various basic compounds.**

KS is poly-6-$O$-sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine (reviewed in Ref. 13). Several glyco- and sulfotransferases involved in KS synthesis have been reported. Five GlcNAc6ST genes have so far been identified, and all the enzymes can act on non-reducing terminal GlcNAc but not on internal GlcNAc such as Gal$\beta 1 \rightarrow 4 \mathrm{GlcNAc}$. Recently, Akama et al. (60) showed that GlcNAc6ST-5 (CGn6ST) is involved in KS synthesis. Fukuta et al. (61) identified a Gal6ST, which prefers an internal Gal residue in the di-N-acetyllactosamine chain (62), suggesting that 6-$O$-sulfation of Gal is a later step in KS synthesis. Among $\beta 3 \mathrm{GnTs}$ so far cloned, $\beta 3 \mathrm{GnT}-2$ has strong enzymatic activity for $p$-lacto-$N$-neohexaose (63), suggesting that the enzyme may be a candidate involved in the elongation of the KS backbone structure, although there is no evidence that $\beta 3 \mathrm{GnT}-2$ has $\beta 3 \mathrm{GnT}$ activity for KS elongation. In this study, we showed that among the seven $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalTs}$, only $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ acts on KS-related glycans, agL2L2 and agL2L4. From these results, it is proposed that KS is synthesized by the sequential actions of four enzymes, GlcNAc6ST-5, $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$, $\beta 3 \mathrm{GnT}$, and then Gal6ST (Fig. 7A).

On the other hand, 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X is synthesized by sequential reactions of GlcNAc6ST, $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}$, $\alpha 2,3$-sialyltransferase, and $\alpha 1,3$-fucosyltransferase. It has been shown that in lymph nodes, this structure is attached on $\beta 1,6$-branching

GlcNAc in $O$-linked core2 (14) or on elongated core1 (64) and that the GlcNAc 6-$O$-sulfation is performed by GlcNAc6ST-2. However, Uchimura et al. (10) showed that GlcNAc6ST-1 is responsible for the synthesis of 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X. Next, galactosylation may be catalyzed by $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ as indicated from our results that only $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ efficiently acts on 6S-core2-$O$-pNP among the seven $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalTs}$. Ujita et al. (34) reported that among $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{I}$ to -V, $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ efficiently acts on non-sulfated core2-$O$-pNP. Here we showed that 6S-core2-$O$-pNP is a better substrate for $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ than core2-$O$-pNP. From these results, a biosynthetic scheme for 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X is proposed as shown in Fig. 7B. $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ is extensively expressed in human tissues as shown in Fig. 6, and there seems to be no relationship between expression profiles of 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X and $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$. This indicates that $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ is not a rate-limiting enzyme for biosynthesis of 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X and that the preceding 6-$O$-sulfation of GlcNAc may be a rate-limiting step. The next subject of study should be whether 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X is synthesized in cultured cells defective in $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ expression.

$\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ is expressed in various human tissues including lymph node as shown in Fig. 6. This result indicates that the 6-$O$-sulfated N-acetyllactosamine structure occurs extensively. In fact, this sulfated glycan moiety has been shown to be present in various glycoproteins including ovomucin (65), glycoproteins derived from several culture cells (66), thyroglobulin (67), zona pellucida glycoproteins (68, 69), gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (70), respiratory mucins (71, 72), carcinoembryonic antigen (73), hyososphorin (74), and oviducal mucins (75). 6SGN-specific $\beta 4 \mathrm{GalT}-\mathrm{IV}$ identified in this study may be useful to elucidate the biological roles of these sulfated moieties.
