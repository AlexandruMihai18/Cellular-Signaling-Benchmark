**Abstract**  
The gastric parietal cell was the first system where a regulated membrane recycling hypothesis was proposed as the principal means for moving molecular transporters between cellular compartments. Upon stimulation, massive membrane flow from an endosomal compartment of tubulovesicle membranes to the apical secretory surface places the ATP-driven pumps in position to secrete a solution of strong acid in collaboration with several other membrane transporters. This review focuses on the membrane recycling pathway and proteins that support the recruitment and redistribution of H,K-ATPase-rich membranes, including those involved in signal transduction, membrane targeting, docking, and fusing, in addition to the integral role of the actin cytoskeleton and its associated proteins in the process of membrane recycling. Although much of the evidence discussed here comes from parietal cell studies, other physiological transport systems, as well as less complex cellular and in vitro models, are examined and cited for generality of principle.

# INTRODUCTION

## Membrane Recycling: A Way of Life

A fundamental process of all living organisms is the ability to conserve energy and mass by recycling. This occurs at every level of organization: molecular recycling for energy conservation, recycling across membranes to establish electrochemical gradients, and even recycling of whole cell parts between cellular compartments. Bidirectional intracellular membrane trafficking allows many cells to perform their specialized functions with an elegant and conservative strategy. We have long recognized the role of membrane recycling in secretory processes in which newly synthesized effector molecules are packaged into membrane vesicles/granules and stored until regulatory signals prompt migration and fusion with the plasma membrane for extracellular delivery of contents. There is another kind of membrane cycling in which actual membrane components (proteins and phospholipids) are shuttled about the cell to refresh and maintain cell functions. The shuttling process becomes more elaborate in cells in which membrane flow and trafficking are regulated to turn on and off molecular transport across the plasma membrane. This review concerns such intracellular membrane recycling, with special emphasis given to the mammalian gastric parietal cell, whose principle function is to secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl).

The first evidence to suggest a membrane recycling theory to account for gastric HCl secretion demonstrated the requisite morphological change for membrane recruitment, the turnover of specific membrane components, and the coordinated development of these processes in newly differentiating acid-secreting cells (1, 2). These early observations in amphibian stomach were clearly confirmed for the more structurally elaborate mammalian parietal cell whose distinct subcellular membrane organization made it the recycling champion (3). We now know that the membrane recycling theory is a recurring theme in the biology of many membrane protein transporters: for example,

the means for regulating insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4 in muscle and adipose tissue (4, 5), as in governing the biology of LDL receptors (6); and the regulation of urine volume and osmolarity via vasopressin-regulated water permeability channels (aquaporin 2) in cells of kidney collecting ducts (7).

Over the decades, understanding of membrane recycling in the gastric parietal cell has expanded in many aspects. Here we review discoveries made in the fields of (a) signal transduction in the parietal cell, (b) the synthetic pathway, (c) membrane targeting, docking and fusion, (d) endocytosis and quality control (degradation pathway) related to membrane recycling, and finally (e) the role of F-actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins that are indispensable components of membrane recycling.

## The Model of Membrane Trafficking of Massive Volume

A brief tour of parietal cell morphology and physiology will help to explain how the subcellular structure of the parietal cell is tailored to its special needs. The parietal cell secretes isotonic HCl (0.15 N), which kills most foodborne organisms, denatures protein for ease of proteolysis, and activates the proenzyme pepsinogen. The job of pumping acid against a huge gradient (greater than 10⁶-fold) is performed by ATP-driven exchange of one H⁺ for one K⁺ at the apical plasma membrane via the enzyme known as H,K-ATPase, which is an αβ heterodimeric membrane protein, highly expressed in the parietal cell (8–10). This transport work needs a high input of energy. Although there has been some argument, experimental and theoretical constraints demand that one ATP be consumed for every proton pumped (11), consistent with the large number of pumps in the cell. Estimates from Coomassie blue stained gels suggest that H,K-ATPase represents as much as 10% of parietal cell protein (12). To accommodate its secretory activity, the resting (nonsecret-ing) parietal cell takes two unique arrangements

of subcellular membranous structures: The apical plasma membrane is expanded in the form of numerous invaginations called apical canaliculi, which express relatively short microvilli, and a large compartment of cytoplasmic membranes, commonly called tubulovesicles (TV), which constitute ~50% of the total membrane mass (exclusive of mitochondria) and comprise the resting pool of H,K-ATPase (13). In fact, 3D reconstruction electron microscopy reveals that most H,K-rich TV membranes are in the form of flattened cisternae and only appear as tubules and vesicles as viewed by thin section electron microscopy (14). In response to extracellular stimuli, parietal cells take on a remarkably different form: The H,K-ATPase-rich TVs migrate and fuse to the canicular membrane, forming elongated microvilli and greatly increasing the apical membrane surface area (up to five-to tenfold), with a corresponding decrease of cytoplasmic TV membrane area (3, 13, 15, 16). Consequently, as depicted in Figure 1a, large numbers of pump molecules are allowed access to deliver HCl at the secretory membrane of the cells. When the stimulus is withdrawn, much of the massive amount of secretory membrane transforms back into TVs within the cytoplasm, thus providing a reliable mechanism to turn off the pump when acid is not needed (3, 15). Establishing the method for separating TV membranes from apical plasma membranes simultaneously provided biochemical evidence for the massive membrane recycling as well as greatly facilitating the study of the molecular events of intracellular trafficking in parietal cells (17). As noted in several reviews, the large volume of membrane recycling found within the parietal cell to accommodate acid secretion is much more profound than any other animal cell model (18).

As mentioned above, this review concerns the processes that direct and regulate membrane recycling in the parietal cell. The reader is directed to several excellent reviews that address the molecular nature of the H,K-ATPase, as well as the mechanism of action of proton pump inhibitors of proven great clinical significance in regulating excess acidity (19–21). A

model depicting various ion transporters and pathways that participate in electrochemical balance as the parietal cell undergoes transition from rest to stimulation is shown in Figure 1b. Experimental evidence and literature reviews that establish the principal pathways to account for electrical and ionic flows across parietal cells within the gastric epithelium can be found elsewhere (22–25).

**SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION LEADING TO THE STIMULATION OF ACID SECRETION**

**Stimulation Mediated by Three Receptors**

The extracellular signals for acid secretion are delivered to the parietal cell through receptors on the basolateral membrane. At present, three types of receptors are known to be involved in stimulating acid secretion: histamine H2 receptor (26), cholinergic muscarinic M3 receptor (27), and gastrin CCK-B receptor (28). The finding that histamine H2 receptor antagonists inhibit not only histaminergic but also gastrinergic and cholinergic stimulation of acid secretion suggests that histamine plays a central role in stimulated gastric acid secretion (29).

Although gastrin can directly stimulate parietal cells (30), the acid stimulatory response is much more prominent by the action of gastrin on the paracrine release of histamine from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells located subadjacent to glandular cells (31). ECL cells are rich in gastrin receptors (CCK-B) and circulating gastrin is a powerful stimulant for the production and secretion of histamine (31).

The muscarinic agent carbachol stimulates H,K-ATPase mRNA and acid secretion in vivo by a direct effect on the parietal cell (30), and by a path independent of histamine release from ECL cells (32). However, the magnitude of acid secretion obtained in vitro with carbachol is substantially lower than that with histamine (33).

Figure 1

Representation of the parietal cell in resting and stimulated states. (a) Cartoon depicting the morphological changes that occur with stimulation. In the resting state (left), the apical canaliculi extend into the cell, presenting short microvilli. Tubulovesicles containing cargo H,K-ATPase (H/K, red) abound in the cytoplasmic space. There are also many mitochondria. Stimulation of acid secretion (right) effects a recruitment and fusion of tubulovesicles at the apical membrane, greatly expanding the canicular micovilli (red membrane) and putting H/K pumps in place to power acid secretion. (b) Functional representation of ion transport pathways in resting and stimulated parietal cells. Na/K and H/K pumps are shown, as well as Na⁺/H⁺ and Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchangers and ion channels for K⁺ and Cl⁻; relative ionic concentrations are indicated by font size. In the resting state (left) the Na⁺ pump, coupled with basolateral ion exchangers and an apical Cl⁻ conductance, provides the electromotive driving force for electrogenic Cl⁻ transport across the cell. H,K exchange pumps (shown as solid red circles) are sequestered in cytoplasmic tubulovesicles but do not transport H⁺ because vesicular permeability to K⁺ is low. When cells are stimulated (right), H,K-containing tubulovesicles are recruited to the apical plasma membrane, and a significant apical K⁺ conductance (channel) is mobilized; K⁺ is recycled back into the cytoplasm by the ATP-powered H,K pump. Thus, there is apparent electrogenic H⁺ transport by the electroneutral H,K-ATPase (current across apical membrane carried by K⁺). Cl⁻ movement through enhanced Cl⁻ channels satisfies overall electroneutrality, resulting in net HCl secretion and osmotically driven water flow. The hydration of CO₂ is necessary for both resting and stimulated states, but it is greatly accelerated during stimulation.

### Signal Transduction Mediated by Histamine H2 Receptors

Studies on histamine receptor antagonists of different specificity led to the discovery of type II (H2) histamine receptors on gastric parietal cells (26). Histamine binds to basolateral Gs receptors, which in turn activate adenylate cyclase, leading to an increased level of cAMP

(34). The signal is then relayed to type I (35) and type II protein kinase A (PKA).

Gaps are still abundant in the signaling path from PKA activation to stimulated acid output. In the parietal cell, few proteins are known to be PKA effectors, and the kinases for many important phosphoproteins have not been determined. However, ezrin is one of

those PKA-related phosphoproteins, acting as  
a membrane-cytoskeleton linker at the apical  
canicular membrane: A full description of  
ezrin physiology and biochemistry is given be-  
low. Lasp-1 (LIM and SH3 domain contain-  
ing protein) seems to be another direct effector  
of PKA in response to histamine stimulation  
(36). Redistribution of Lasp-1 from basolateral  
to apical membrane upon stimulation indicates  
an important function of this protein in parietal  
cell secretion. A reasonable speculation is that  
Laspl may serve as an adaptor protein via its  
LIM and SH3 domains to recruit downstream  
effectors in PKA signaling (37). One puzzle  
about Laspl in the parietal cell is that its phos-  
phorylation leads to reduced binding to F-actin  
(36), instead of enhanced binding. Enhanced  
acid secretion observed with Laspl knockout  
mice suggests that this protein may impose a  
negative regulation on acid secretion (38).

Histamine stimulation of parietal cells  
also induces phosphorylation on parchorin  
(120-kDa phosphoprotein) (39), which co-  
incidentally migrated from cytosol to apical  
membranes upon stimulation (40). Parchorin  
is homologous to the CLIC (Cl⁻ intracellular  
channel) family. Additionally, parchorin was  
found to be mainly distributed in secreting  
epithelial cells (41), and is believed to play  
a facilitating role in Cl⁻ transport, but the  
precise role as a channel or channel regulator  
has yet to be defined.

An interesting difference in the H2  
receptor-mediated pathway exists among dif-  
ferent species. In rabbit parietal cells, activation  
of H2 receptor leads to an increase in intracel-  
lular Ca²⁺ (42), which does not occur in canine  
parietal cells (43). Subsequent studies revealed  
that both Ca²⁺-dependent and -independent  
pathways downstream of H2 receptor activa-  
tion exist in rabbit parietal cells (33), consistent  
with the notion of some interaction between  
intracellular Ca²⁺ and the cAMP pathway.

protein, which then activates PLCβ (β isoform  
of phospholipase C), the enzyme catalyzing the  
hydrolysis of PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-  
biphosphate) to produce IP3 (inositol-1,4,5-  
triphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol) (see  
Reference 44 for a review). IP3 then serves  
as a secondary messenger to increase intra-  
cellular Ca²⁺ concentration. The increased  
level of Ca²⁺ and DAG converge on the  
Ca²⁺- and DAG-dependent protein kinase  
PKC.

In gastric parietal cells, elevation of IP3 and  
intracellular Ca²⁺ occurs after stimulation with  
the cholinergic agonist carbachol (45). The im-  
portance of intracellular Ca²⁺ in M3-mediated  
signaling was also clearly demonstrated by the  
fact that the Ca²⁺-chelating reagent BAPTA  
could prevent carbachol stimulation of the pari-  
etal cell, but still permit histamine stimulation  
(33). Stimulation of PKC with the DAG ho-  
molog TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-  
acetate) did increase acid secretion in the in-  
teresting context that TPA and other phorbol  
esters inhibit histamine H2 receptor-mediated  
parietal cell stimulation (46, 47). The role of  
PKC in parietal cell biology is further com-  
plicated by the fact that many different iso-  
forms of PKC are expressed in abundance  
(48).

Stimulation of parietal cells with carbachol  
or TPA induced phosphorylation on pp66, sug-  
gesting this phosphoprotein to be a PKC ef-  
fector (49), in a Ca²⁺-independent manner  
(48). The pp66 gene has high homology with  
the actin-binding protein coronin, therefore  
named coroninse because of its high expression  
level in secretory epithelia (50).

### Inhibitory Signaling Pathways  
### in Parietal Cells

Several inhibitory pathways have been identi-  
fied in parietal cells, such as the direct and indi-  
rect effects of somatostatin (a local paracrine  
inhibitor) and inhibitory effects mediated by  
EGF/TGF-α on protein tyrosine kinase re-  
ceptors. These are not reviewed here, but see  
References 51 and 52.

**THE SYNTHETIC PATHWAY**

Synthesis and degradation of H,K-ATPase account for little of mature parietal cell activity in the “short term” of the secretory cycle. However, the existing pool of recycling membranes clearly originates from the rough ER and Golgi apparatus. The importance of the synthetic pathway for acid secretion was first noticed in studies of developing acid secreting cells (called oxyntic cells in amphibians) in metamorphosing bullfrog tadpoles. Tadpoles do not secrete HCl until the stage when tail reabsorption is almost complete near the conversion to adult frog morphology (1), which directly correlates with the appearance of H,K-ATPase and the distinct morphology of oxyntic cells in the tadpole stomach (2). Newly developed oxyntic cells at this developmental stage have two characteristic features: extremely elaborate and extensive Golgi complexes, and nascent accumulation of TVs emanating from the Golgi. In later developmental stages, Golgi complexes become less prominent, whereas TVs reach maximum prominence. These observations indicate the important role of Golgi complexes in the formation of TVs.

This ontogenetic hypothesis is in harmony with the fact that the TV pool is the membranous vector for densely packed membrane protein cargo (H,K-ATPase). The time course of H,K-ATPase synthesis and turnover was studied in rabbits pulse-labeled with \[^{35}S\]-cysteine/methionine, in which four sequential membrane compartments were identified (53). (a) The first peak occurred within 10–12 min and consisted of the nascent H,K-ATPase in the ER. (b) The second pool, which peaked 20–30 min after injection, consisted of a pubescent compartment within the Golgi. (c) Major incorporation into mature tubulovesicles was prominent by 90 min. (d) At further times (>90 min), a small peak emerged whose membrane permeability properties suggested a senescent pool of TVs. Based on these synthetic data, the half-life of H,K-ATPase in the rabbit was calculated to be about ~40 h.

**MEMBRANE TARGETING, DOCKING, AND FUSION**

The profound morphological change in parietal cells upon stimulation is mainly due to the insertion of intracellular tubulovesicles (TVs) onto the apical membrane. As this is a rapid procedure, homotypic fusion among TVs, as well as between TVs and apical membrane, is expected to be the outstanding feature of the parietal cell. The morphological transformation is a sophisticated process achieved by collaboration of numerous protein families.

**SNARES**

**SNAREs and Vesicle Targeting**

The specificity and driving force for membrane fusion have been a fascinating subject in cell biology, with a great deal of research centered on supporting or challenging what has become known as the SNARE hypothesis. SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are a group of proteins that reside on different membranes and subcellular locations. SDS-resistant SNARE complexes usually form between one SNARE protein on the vesicular membrane (v-SNARE) and several SNARE proteins on the target membrane (t-SNARE). Originally, the SNARE hypothesis held that each SNARE protein governs a different subcellular membrane (54). This view has been challenged and subsequently modified to read that specific combinations of SNARE proteins from both fusion partners dictate the specificity of membrane fusion (55). However, a body of evidence suggests that the SNARE contribution to membrane fusion per se may be small and prevalent in certain model systems that happen to be heavily studied (56, 57).

**SNAREs and Membrane Fusion**

The free energy released by the formation of the SNARE complex has been proposed as

the driving force for membrane fusion (58). In the most-studied SNARE complex, the v-SNARE protein on the presynaptic vesicle is VAMP2, which has a SNARE domain responsible for interaction with two corresponding t-SNAREs on the target presynaptic membrane: syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 (59). This “minimum fusion machinery” hypothesis faces some difficulties. For instance, less stable SNARE complexes formed with mutant SNARE proteins did not inhibit exocytosis in PC-12 cells (60). In addition, the in vitro systems leading to the minimum fusion machinery argument have typically measured fusion events requiring minutes or hours to complete (58), whereas fusion events in vivo are in the scale of milliseconds. Certainly, these difficulties have not prevented SNARE proteins from being widely accepted as the most important proteins in membrane trafficking/fusion.

### SNAREs in Gastric Parietal Cells

The initial search for SNARE proteins in the parietal cell detected six SNAREs: VAMP, syntaxins 1, 2, 3, and 4, and SNAP25 (61, 62). Available evidence is consistent with the suggestion that syntaxin 1, syntaxin 3, VAMP2, and SNAP25 are important for the insertion of TVs to the apical canalicular membrane. VAMP2 and syntaxin 3, but not syntaxin 1 or SNAP25, are localized to the intracellular TVs (61, 62). Live cell imaging with GFP-labeled VAMP2 tracked the translocation of VAMP2 from TV membranes onto the canalicular apical membrane upon stimulation of parietal cells (63). Clear evidence of the important function of VAMP2 in stimulated acid secretion was given by the treatment of parietal cells with tetanus neurotoxin, which cleaved VAMP2 and concomitantly inhibited acid secretion (63, 64).

Although VAMP2 is expected to be present in TVs as a v-SNARE, the detection of syntaxin 3 on TVs is remarkable. This so-called t-SNARE may mediate homotypic fusion among TVs, which is suggested by the rapid morphological changes when parietal cells are stimulated to active acid secretion. One study demonstrated a trafficking pathway for syntaxin 3, translocating from TV along with H,K-ATPase to the apical membrane, upon parietal cell stimulation (65). Finally, the functional importance of syntaxin 3 in supporting acid secretion was demonstrated with an SLO-permeabilized gastric gland model (66).

SNAP25 has been localized to the apical membrane by imaging and subcellular fractionation experiments (67). Expression of a mutant SNAP25, in which the syntaxin-interacting C terminus was deleted, inhibited acid secretion in parietal cells. Another role for SNAP25 was demonstrated in Foxl1 (a transcription factor)-deficient mice, in which parietal cells do not respond to cAMP-mediated stimulation (68). Ultrastructural analysis indicated that the membrane fusion mechanism was impaired in the Foxl1-deficient cells, along with decreased levels of SNAP25 mRNA expression. Finally, data with fluorescent labeled SNARE proteins and subcellular fractionation found SNAP25 (67) and syntaxin 1 (69) on the apical membrane of parietal cells. These results indicate that SNARE complexes composed of syntaxin 1, SNAP25, and VAMP2 participate in the fusion of TVs to the apical membrane.

Although the functional importance of syntaxin 3 in acid secretion was established, its mechanism of function remains a mystery. What are the cognate SNAREs for syntaxin 3? To what extent would the syntaxin 3/SNARE complex affect acid secretion? Possible cognate v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs for syntaxin 3 in parietal cells can be inferred from other model systems (70–72). A SNARE complex composed of syntaxin 3, SNAP-25, and VAMP2 was detected in parietal cells (73). As syntaxin 3 is a TV protein whereas SNAP-25 is an apical membrane SNARE, the formation of this SNARE complex is challenging the traditional view that cognate syntaxins and SNAPS are located on the same membrane. A model of parietal cell stimulation and reversal is shown in Figure 2, which indicates potential placement and interaction of several SNARE proteins, as well as other operators in the recruitment/recycling process.

Scheme of regulated membrane recycling in the parietal cell depicting the onset of secretion (blue area), and during the endocytic uptake from active secretion back to the inactive state (red area). Under the influence of cAMP-mediated stimulation, inactive tubulovesicles (TVs) containing the cargo pump protein, H,K-ATPase (H/K) and several docking/fusion proteins, such as syntaxin 3 (Stx3), VAMP and Rab11, are recruited from the cytoplasmic pool to the apical plasma membrane. Some of the TV proteins are likely involved in TV/TV intervesicular fusion (Stx3 and VAMP). The various TVs dock with the apical membrane. Steps at the apical membrane include formation of a SNARE complex consisting of Stx3/VAMP/SNAP/Munc18, possibly regulated by phosphorylation (74). ATP and/or Ca²⁺ promote the formation of a fusion pore positioning the pump at the apical surface, where ATP-mediated H/K pumping occurs in concert with K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels (latter not shown). Recycling occurs by withdrawal of the stimulus and massive endocytic uptake of apical plasma membrane into a pool of endosomal membranes that recycle H/K back into inactive TVs consistent with the resting state. Dynamin and clathrin assist with the uptake process. A small component of endocytosed membranes is processed via the lysosomal degradation pathway. (Adapted from Reference 74.)

Another extraordinary observation (75) has to be considered before we form an unbiased opinion about SNAREs. Isolated TVs have been shown to readily fuse with each other and even fuse with pure liposomes in response to Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺/ATP added at physiological concentrations. Apparently, fusion is possible even when one of the membranes does not carry any SNARE protein, and is enhanced when there is a negative membrane surface charge (76). Taking these results, together with the prevailing evidence supporting a role for SNAREs in parietal cells, we hypothesize that SNARE proteins may have a primary role in the recognition and docking events, but that an additional mechanism, possibly involving insertion of a hydrophobic protein domain from one membrane into a closely apposed membrane, provides the energy to form the fusion pore.

Rab GTPases

**Rab GTPases and Their Regulators**

Rab GTPases are Ras-like small GTPases that regulate many steps of membrane trafficking. Rabs are often found tethered to membrane through two prenyl groups at their C termini (77), and switch between GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms depending on a variety of activation, dissociation, displacement, and exchange factors (see Reference 78 for a review). Interaction with these proteins leads to the production of GTP-bound Rab, which then recruits Rab effector proteins for downstream activities. In time, GTPase activation factors (GAPs) will activate Rab GTPase, leading to the hydrolysis of GTP, and a new cycle of Rab activity. Cycling between GTP/GDP-bound and -unbound forms, the Rab GTPases may provide a temporal regulation to intracellular trafficking events (79).

**Rab GTPases in Mediating Membrane Targeting and Docking**

In yeast and mammalian systems Rab proteins recruit the tethering factor, such as p115, to mediate specific docking of ER-derived vesicles onto the Golgi membrane (80). Interaction between p115 and some SNARE proteins suggests that SNAREs are indirect effectors of Rab GTPases. In endocytosis, Rab5 effector EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1) mediates the tethering of clathrin-coated-vesicles to the early endosomes (81). When mediating homotypic fusion between endosomes, Rab5/EEA1 molecules are required on both donor and acceptor membranes (82).

**Rab GTPases in Powering Vesicle Motility**

Rab6 has a kinesin-like effector, Rabkinesin-6 (83). This protein is important for cytokinesis, and may also play a role in microtubule-dependent vesicle transport. Rab proteins are also implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton-directed vesicle transport, by virtue of their functional associations with nonconventional myosins in several systems (84).

**Rab11 and Other Rabs in Parietal Cells**

Rab11 regulates two different trafficking pathways. Rab11 has been implicated in regulating recycling endosomes in transferrin recycling models, and also found to be required for TGN-to-plasma membrane trafficking (85). Initial screening for Rab proteins in parietal cells identified Rab11 as the most abundant Rab at the mRNA level (86), and eventually localized Rab11 to the H,K-ATPase-enriched TVs (87).

Functional studies in parietal cells with a dominant-negative Rab11 mutant (N124I) revealed striking effects on acid secretion (88). Compared to control cells, N124I mutant expression caused a 60% inhibition in stimulated acid secretion. This inhibition was directly correlated with impaired membrane translocation from TVs to the apical plasma membrane. With a similar approach, Rab11 was also shown to mediate the trafficking of GLUT4 to plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation (89). Besides Rab11, other Rab proteins (Rab1a, Rab10, Rab14, and Rab25) are expressed in parietal cells (86), but their functional significance has not been elucidated.

Identifying Rab11 effectors is essential to unveil the molecular detail for regulating membrane recycling events. The first Rab11 effector, Rab11BP/Rabphilin-11, was isolated and cloned from brain tissue. Rip11 was later localized on TVs in gastric parietal cells (90), together with two other Rab11 effectors: Rab11-FIP1 (Rab11 family interacting protein 1, also called Rab-coupling protein, RCP) and Rab11-FIP2.

The interaction of Rab11-FIP2 with myosin Vb (91) suggests that Rab11 has a regulatory function on endosomal motility along actin cytoskeleton (92). Importantly, the regulation of myosin Vb by Rab11-FIP2 is an integral part

**Rab GTPases:**
a subgroup of Ras superfamily of small GTPases (“Ras-related in brain”)
of the membrane recycling of aquaporin 2 in  
renal collecting duct principal cells (93). Mutation analysis indicated that Rab11-FIP2 also  
regulates other steps in membrane trafficking  
(94).  

Both Rab11-FIP3 and FIP4 can form  
ternary complexes with Rab11 and Arf6 (95). Evidence suggests that Rab11-FIP3 and FIP4  
are involved in the membrane trafficking of cytokinesis via interaction with Arf6 and the exocyst. Interaction of Rab11 with syntaxin 4 is  
another exciting discovery. The interaction of  
Rab11 with this t-SNARE strengthens the notion that SNAREs could be regulated by Rab  
GTPases (96).  

Although many Rab11 effectors have been  
identified, and three of them are expressed in  
parietal cells, functional studies of these effectors in parietal cells have not been reported. Immediate questions are: Which Rab11 effectors are required for stimulated acid secretion? At which step do they regulate membrane recycling in parietal cells?  

**OTHER SNARE REGULATORS**  

Although many details are missing, the importance of the SM protein family (named for sec1p protein in yeast and munc18 in mammals) in  
membrane trafficking is established (see Reference 97 for a review). In mammals, munc18-1  
is the heavily studied member of the SM proteins. One striking discovery about munc18-1  
is that it binds to syntaxin 1 in its closed conformation thereby preventing the formation of  
SNARE complexes (98), supporting a negative role for munc18-1 in fusion. However, in  
munc18-1 knockout mice there is a complete loss of neurotransmitter secretion, suggesting  
the opposite scenario (99). This apparent conflict is addressed by the finding that munc18-1  
also binds syntaxin 1 in other ways, e.g., when syntaxin 1 is in complex with other SNARE  
proteins (100). To fully appreciate the function  
of SM protein in membrane trafficking, several immediate questions need to be addressed:  
(a) What is the cognate partner of munc18-1 on the vesicle membrane? (b) How does the  

SM-SNARE binding mode change from one  
to the other (mode 1: SM binding to closed syntaxin, precluding SNARE complex formation; mode 2: SM binding to open syntaxin, facilitating specific SNARE complex formation)?  
(c) Why is the stoichiometry of munc18-1 to syntaxin ~1:20 (101)?  

In the parietal cell, Munc18b stood out in an RNAi screening for proteins important for  
secretion (73). The binding of Munc18b specifically for syntaxin 3 was shown to be mediated  
by one N-terminal and one C-terminal domain, with the latter being specific for syntaxin 3, but  
not for other syntaxins. Phosphorylation mediated by CDK5 on T572 at the C-terminal  
domain of Munc18b attenuated its interaction with syntaxin 3; however, phosphorylated  
Munc18b was found to promote the assembly of a Munc18b-syntaxin 3-SNAP25-VAMP3  
membrane complex (73) in lysates from stimulated parietal cells. The authors speculated that  
this CDK5-regulated SNARE complex is the basis for docking and fusion in this system, but  
differences in complexity between resting and stimulated cells still need to be compared.  

**ENDOCYTOSIS**  

Although inhibitory signals for acid secretion do exist (e.g., somatostatin and EGF/TGF-α pathways), withdrawal of the stimulus alone seems to be sufficient to turn off parietal cell secretion. Withdrawal of stimulus leads to a progressive resequestration of the expanded apical membrane and H,K-ATPase pumps back into the cytoplasmic compartment (3, 102). According to the hypothesis of massive phagocytosis (18), there is a massive internalization of the apical canalicular membrane with the cessation of acid secretion, followed by the sorting and delivery of different cargos to different subcellular locations. Coat proteins, dynamin, and associated proteins are believed to play big roles in this process.  

**Clathrin and Coat Proteins**  

The formation of a coat at the location of  
vesicle budding helps the membrane deform  
into a pit. The clathrin coat is best characterized among three known vesicle coats (the others are COPI and COPII). The major component of the clathrin coat is clathrin. Each clathrin subunit consists of three heavy and three light chains that together form a three-legged structure called a triskelion, which could spontaneously form polyhedral cages in vitro in the absence of membrane vesicles (103), suggesting a decisive role for clathrin in vesicle formation.

Another major component of the clathrin coat is adaptin, also a multisubunit complex. Adaptin is the connection between clathrin and membrane proteins, including membrane cargo proteins (see Reference 104 for a review). Therefore, adaptin is part of the mechanism for cargo selection. There are four types of adaptor proteins for clathrin coat, AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4, each specific for a different set of membrane cargo proteins. In mammalian cells, clathrin-coated vesicle formation from plasma membrane is mediated by AP-2, whereas clathrin-coated vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network is mediated by other types of adaptins (105).

The abundance of clathrin in gastric epithelial cells suggested an important role for this protein complex in those cells (106). Clathrin has been localized to canalicular membranes and TVs in parietal cells (106). While the AP-2 is predictably localized to the canalicular plasma membrane, the localization of AP-1 on TVs is one of the first demonstrations of non-Golgi localization of AP-1 (106).

H,K-ATPase is the dominant membrane cargo protein being ferried around in parietal cells. It is therefore essential to know how this pump protein is selectively enriched in the clathrin-coated areas on membranes and whether it interacts with any of the clathrin adaptors. An initial step included the characterization of a tyrosine-containing internalization motif at the cytoplasmic tail of the beta subunit of H,K-ATPase (107). As shown with a transgenic mouse model, when this cytoplasmic tyrosine residue was mutated to alanine, the mutated H,K-ATPase was continuously expressed at the parietal cell surface with sustained secretion of acid, even causing gastric ulcers and hypertrophic gastropathy. The internalization of H,K-ATPase may also be facilitated by CD63, a tetraspan membrane protein also containing a tyrosine-based motif for interaction with adaptin complexes. Interaction between CD63 and H,K-ATPase beta subunit was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation (108). The striking observation with CD63 is that the coexpression of CD63 with H,K-ATPase beta subunit in fibroblast cells changes the subcellular distribution of the H,K-ATPase beta subunit from a predominantly cell-surface distribution to an intracellular one.

### ARF6

ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor) GTPases are a family of small, Ras-like GTPases known for regulating coat assemblies in vesicle formation and organization of cytoskeleton (109). ARF proteins are so named because they were first identified to be cellular protein factors required for cholera toxin to ADP-ribosylate the Gs heterotrimeric G proteins. However, endogenous roles of ARF proteins do not involve ADP-ribosylation or regulation of heterotrimeric Gs protein.

Like other small GTPases, ARFs switch between GDP- and GTP-bound states. GTP exchange factors (GEFs) are responsible to load ARFs with GTP, whereas GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) activate GTPase activity, causing GTP hydrolysis into GDP. These factors together dictate the timing of ARF6 switching between two states, therefore serving as timed switches for regulating cellular activities.

We are particularly interested in ARF6 because it localizes to the plasma membrane as well as to endosomal membranes. ARF6 directly interacts with AP-2 and recruits AP-2 onto the plasma membrane, supporting a direct role for ARF6 in clathrin/AP-2-mediated endocytosis (110). ARF6 also plays an indirect role in membrane recruitment of AP-2 by PIP2 (111).

ARF6 is expressed in parietal cells (112). The much more abundant expression of ARF6 in parietal cells than in other gastric epithelial cell types is consistent with the huge demand for endocytic machinery in parietal cell membrane recycling. Like H, K-ATPase, native ARF6 redistributes from predominantly cytoplasmic membranes to apical canalicular surface when cells are stimulated. Expression of the Q67L ARF6 mutant, which lacks GTP hydrolysis activity, caused inhibition of acid secretion in parietal cells, as did the locking of ARF6 in the active state by GTPγS. Examination of cellular localization found the active ARF6-GTPγS accumulated on TVs, suggesting that the major function of ARF6 in parietal cells is endocytosis. ARF6 is also involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton (113), which deserves further investigation in the parietal cell as actin filaments are the platform for many important cellular activities.

**Dynamim**

Dynamim is a large GTPase involved in many processes, including budding of transport vesicles (114), division of organelles, and cytokinesis (115). The pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain in the middle of the dynamim sequence renders it subject to regulations mediated by PIP2 (116), possibly involving ARF6, as discussed above. The C-terminal proline-rich domain of dynamim interacts with a myriad of SH3-domain-containing proteins that are involved in endocytosis and other cellular activities (117).

A more important role of dynamim in endocytosis comes from its unique property of self-assembling into spiral rod-like polymers, which constrict and become longer rods with a reduced diameter when GTP is hydrolyzed (118). An hypothetical model has been proposed to explain how dynamim causes membrane tubulation and fission of vesicles (119).

Dynamim in parietal cells was found associated with the apical canalicular membrane in both resting and stimulated cells (65, 106). Like ARF6, dynamim is much more abundant

in parietal cells than other cell types in gastric glands (106), which again is consistent with large volume of endocytosis on the apical canalicular membrane of parietal cells. However, the exact role for dynamim in parietal cell endocytosis or other cellular activity is still unclear before functional studies are performed, e.g., using dynamim mutants that constitutively activate or inactivate GTP hydrolytic activity.

**F-ACTIN AND ITS ASSOCIATED PROTEINS**

**Extraordinary Actin Filaments in Parietal Cells**

Specialized cell shapes are supported by the F-actin networks and F-actin bundles beneath plasma membranes. Staining stomach cryosections and isolated gastric glands with FITC-labeled phalloidin revealed that the F-actin filaments are primarily distributed along apical membranes of the epithelial cells, with a more sparse distribution near basolateral membranes (120). Parietal cells have a very elaborate apical membrane structure in the form of intracellular canalicular membranes carrying numerous microvilli. Thus it is no surprise they contain the majority of the total F-actin among gastric glandular cells (121). Examination of different isoforms of actin revealed two major isoforms in parietal cells (122). More importantly, there was a polarized distribution of the actin isoforms, with β-actin predominantly localized on canalicular apical membrane, whereas γ-actin was localized to the basolateral membrane.

Electron microscopy has shown that, in the resting state, abundant parietal cell microvilli on the apical canalicular membrane are short (~0.5 μm) and have distinct F-actin bundles that are radially organized along the length of the microvilli, including filamentous extensions from each microvillus projecting 1 or more μm into the cytosol (3, 123). After stimulation, and concomitant with massive TV fusion, the large increase in apical surface area is accommodated by unique expansion of the canalicular surface into the cell, rather than by projection from the cell. The radial F-actin bundles appear similar
to those seen in the resting state, providing structural support for the increased microvillar surface extensions. When the stimulus is withdrawn, the canalicular spaces collapse over the next 15–30 min as HCl secretion is turned off, and the extracellular surfaces of the elongated microvilli come into extremely close contact, forming the large pool of what will be the macroendocytosed pool of H,K-ATPase-rich membranes. At this point, F-actin filaments within the collapsed microvilli are no longer arranged in “neat” long bundles, but appear as short, “disorganized” extensions into the cytoplasm (3). At longer times after stimulus removal (30–45 min), there is a proliferation of intracellular structures arising from the endocytosed canaliculus, including many peritubular membrane vacuoles, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes, all of which contain H,K-ATPase. Finally (after 60–90 min), the cytoplasm becomes replete with TVs and the canalicular surface reverts to the morphology of the resting parietal (3, 102). Thus it appears that the reformed TV membrane pool arises relatively slowly from the larger endocytosed structures, although how this occurs is poorly understood. The relationships between actin filaments, apical microvilli, and TV membranes during stimulus-mediated transition from rest to maximal secretion and the subsequent recovery to the resting state when the stimulus is removed are shown in Figure 3, along with possible interactions with an actin-cytoskeleton linker protein, ezrin.

Biochemical measurements showed no significant difference in the ratio of polymerized F-actin versus actin monomer (G-actin) when resting and stimulated parietal cells were compared. F-actin consists of about 90% of total actin in both conditions (124). Given the fine structural data discussed above, these observations suggest the parietal cell is poised to maintain a high F/G-actin ratio during the resting-stimulation cycle. The more important changes, therefore, would seem to occur in the supramolecular organization of F-actin into the discrete filament bundles that provide the platform for interaction with the membrane

and surface plasticity, especially as the cells normally transit from active secretion to the resting state.

### Actin Inhibitors

Research with inhibitors supports the critical role for actin filaments in parietal cell membrane recycling, as well the importance of secondary organization of filament bundles. The cytochalasins (forms B, C, D, and E), which are microfilament disrupting agents, have inhibitory effects on acid secretion in various preparations, including isolated gastric epithelium (125), intact glands (126), and isolated parietal cells (127). In chambered piglet gastric mucosa, maximal inhibition of acid secretion occurred at the relatively high dose of \(5 \times 10^{-5} M\) (125). The resulting close apposition of apical microvillar surfaces as well as disruption of long microfilament bundles into short actin filaments were both reminiscent of the early transition in the recovery from the stimulated to resting state, with the notable difference that there was no further progression to the TV-rich resting parietal cell morphology.

Experiments with the actin monomer-sequestering reagent, latrunculin B (LatB), sheds some light on the mechanism of how microvillar F-actin resists the “recycling trend” in parietal cells (121). Fluorescent labeling of cultured parietal cells treated with LatB revealed two distinct pools of F-actin: (a) a fraction of total F-actin that is very sensitive to low-dose LatB (e.g., formation of lamellipodia at the basolateral membrane was inhibited at ~0.1 μM); and (b) an apical F-actin pool that is converted to G-actin only at much higher doses (10–70 μM), which also inhibits stimulation-dependent recruitment of TVs to the apical membrane. It was only at these high doses, which are two to three orders higher than the IC₅₀ (0.05–0.1 μM) measured in many other cells, where LatB produced a large shift from F- to G-actin as well as concomitant inhibition of acid secretion in isolated gastric glands and cultured parietal cells (121). When resting parietal cells were pretreated with high-dose LatB then washed in

Figure 3

Schematic drawing of the changes in apical microvilli (MV), actin microfilaments, and ezrin as the parietal cell undergoes the secretory cycle. In the resting state, MV are relatively short, actin filaments are highly organized, ezrin is primarily associated with the apical membrane [mostly in the dephosphorylated state (dephospho-ezrin)], and tubulovesicles (TV) abound in the cytoplasm. Stimulation to secrete acid results in recruitment and fusion of TV with apical plasma membrane, increased phosphorylation of ezrin on T567, and elongation of MV, with ezrin supporting the membrane-cytoskeleton interaction. Withdrawal of the stimulus turns off acid secretion. In the recovering cell, the canicular space collapses, bringing MV into very close contact, microfilaments become disorganized, ezrin appears in the cytoplasm predominantly dephosphorylated at T567, and large fragments of membrane whorls are taken into the cytoplasm, often appearing as pentalaminar membrane structures (3, 102). A slower recovery to the morphology of the resting cell occurs by endocytic reconstruction of cytoplasmic TV and short apical MV supported by reformed microfilaments and ezrin attachments. Both phases of the morphological change require a constant dissociation and reassociation between F-actin and MV membrane, which is made possible through the continuous turnover of ezrin T567 phosphorylation, the switch for ezrin-F-actin interaction.

fresh culture medium, the apical recruitment of TVs and morphological change in response to stimulation were the same as in control cells.

Phalloidin is an alternative reagent that alters actin cytoskeleton by binding much more tightly to F-actin filaments than to G-actin monomers, thus stabilizing the polymeric F-actin form. In studies on gastric glands and isolated parietal cells, permeabilized by α-toxin to allow reagent accessibility, phalloidin (up to 10 μM) did not significantly alter the measured F/G-actin ratio in resting versus stimulated cells, nor did it alter the acid secretion response to cAMP (124), consistent with the fact that parietal cell actin is primarily in the polymerized form.

Altogether, these results demonstrate the importance of a highly organized and complex F-actin cytoskeleton at the apical canicular surface to support the membrane recycling essential to turn parietal cell acid secretion on and off. All cells certainly have distinct pools of actin contributing to their many cytoskeleton-dependent functions; because of heavy commitment to regulated membrane recycling as its secretory mechanism, the parietal cell invests
a large component of total actin in the pool  
of microfilaments within apical microvilli. Fur-  
thermore, relatively little F- to G-actin tread-  
milling is required to support the structural  
changes in going from rest to maximal stimu-  
lation, as suggested by the relative insensitivity  
to phalloidin and LatB. However, when pari-  
etal cells are challenged with high doses of LatB  
or cytochalasin, acid secretion is depressed and  
there is concomitant loss of filamentous actin,  
as assessed by chemical and morphological ap-  
proaches. In the transition from secretion back  
to the resting state, the morphological changes  
in apical microvilli, as well as deteriorating actin  
filaments, suggest that there may be additional  
factors required to reassemble the supramolec-  
ular filaments characteristic of parietal cell mi-  
crovilli. As identified in other cells, these factors  
are likely to be F-actin-associated proteins re-  
sponsible for stabilizing, bundling, and capping  
of the complex filaments, as well as providing  
linkages with nearby membranes. Ezrin is a pro-  
tein of the latter class, and its potential inter-  
actions with apical membrane and microvillar  
actin filaments are indicated in Figure 3.

### Ezrin Is Essential for Apical  
Membrane Remodeling  

Substantial evidence suggests that the F-actin  
binding protein ezrin plays an essential role  
in apical membrane remodeling in the parietal  
cell: $(a)$ Ezrin is an abundant protein in parietal  
cells, but not detected in chief cells or mucous  
neck cells (128); $(b)$ ezrin is a major component  
on the apical membrane of parietal cells (39,  
129); $(c)$ the polarity of the parietal cell and di-  
rectional recruitment of H,K-ATPase-rich TVs  
are greatly affected by mutation of a phosphory-  
lation site (Thr567) on ezrin (130); $(d)$ destruc-  
tion of parietal cell ezrin by activating calpain  
abolished acid secretion (131); and finally $(e)$  
when ezrin was greatly lowered in a conditional  
knockout mouse model, insertion of TVs onto  
the apical canalicular membrane was blocked,  
leading to inhibition of acid secretion (132).  
Ezrin is a member of the ERM  
(ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of F-actin/  

membrane linker proteins (133). ERM pro-  
teins bind to F-actin through their C-terminal  
FERM (four point one, ezrin, radixin, and  
moesin) domain (134). The N-terminal domain  
of ezrin binds to plasma membrane via direct  
interaction with membrane proteins (135, 136)  
or lipid (137), or indirectly through adaptor  
proteins (138, 139). In vitro (140) and in vivo  
evidence (141) suggests that N- and C-terminal  
domains also bind to each other in a dormant  
state, preventing C-terminal ezrin interaction  
with F-actin, but the conformationally “closed”  
ezrin maintains interaction with the mem-  
brane, albeit with reduced affinity compared  
with “open” ezrin (142). Abundant evidence  
has shown that ezrin remains membrane bound  
to the apical microvillar membrane with no  
obvious redistribution when the parietal cell  
cycles from the resting to stimulated state (39,  
142–144). However, a recent report indicates  
that ezrin is released from apical plasma  
membrane to intracellular locations when  
stimulated parietal cells are in the process of  
returning to the resting state (102).  

Ezrin N-C intramolecular binding is mainly  
regulated by a phosphorylation event: FRET  
(fluorescence resonance energy transfer) anal-  
ysis with ezrin constructs carrying YFP at the  
N terminus and a GFP at the C terminus indi-  
cated that phosphorylation on threonine 567  
(T567) is sufficient to break apart the inter-  
nal N-C binding of ezrin (142), as predicted  
from a structural study (145) and in vitro stud-  
ies on other ERM proteins (146, 147). Stud-  
ies on parietal cell cultures, using fluorescent  
tagged ezrin constructs with point mutations  
of the T567 site, revealed that the nonphos-  
phorylatable T567A was still targeted to the  
apical canalicular membrane and these cells  
could be stimulated to secrete acid and process  
H,K-ATPase recruitment to near control lev-  
els, though these events may be supported by  
the residual endogenous ezrin.  

In contrast, the ezrin T567D mutant,  
mimicking the permanent phosphorylated  
state, caused an inhibition of acid secretion  
and unexpectedly produced a surprising  
repolarization of the cells, whereby ezrin,  

**ERM family:** ezrin/

F-actin, and H,K-ATPase all accumulated at the basolateral membrane in the form of extensive microvillar/filopodial extensions (130). Several groups, using various cell systems, had previously noted the T567D ezrin-enhanced surface projections (148, 149), but not much attention was given to specific membrane location. A membrane “fixation” effect of ezrin T567D was demonstrated by the FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching) technique, suggesting that these permanently “opened” mutant ezrin molecules were tightly bound to the basolateral sites (142). These somewhat disparate results were brought to congruence by time course experiments using kinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors, where high turnover of ezrin phosphorylation on threonine T567 was detected in three different tissue models (143). A relatively constant membrane binding and an ever-changing F-actin binding (as dictated by high turnover of T567 phosphorylation) were demonstrated in parietal cells, intestinal enterocytes, and proximal renal tubules, all preparations rich in apical microvilli and abundant microvillar ezrin. The turnover of the F-actin binding gives the ezrin molecule the power to associate and reassociate between membrane and cytoskeleton, thus enabling a dynamic reposition of membrane along the filamentous actin length, in a fashion similar to a rolling molecular motor attached to the cell membrane. Note that in the two brush border apical membrane models (enterocyte and proximal tubular cells), in which microvillar structure is very regular and highly stable, the steady state of ezrin is balanced toward the phosphorylated T567-P state. On the contrary, for parietal cells, where apical microvilli dynamically change with functional state and are often bent into different shapes, the steady state of ezrin T567 is primarily in the dephospho form. Though there is high turnover of T567 phosphorylation in all these systems, the steady state seen at any given time correlates to the apparent structural form and stability of the extant microvilli. Thus we propose this model of phosphorylation turnover as essential for surface plasticity in view of the growth

and repositioning required for cytoskeleton expansion, as well as the reestablishment of membrane surface forces as processes of recruitment and endocytosis occur (e.g., as shown in Figure 3). When turnover is prevented by incorporating the T567D mutant ezrin, the net binding forces change. We further posit that the unusual and eventual accumulation of T567D ezrin to the basolateral membrane of cultured parietal cells is fundamentally due to its sustained F-actin binding capability. High levels of the T567D mutant will seek F-actin binding sites that are in the basolateral as well as apical membrane. This may act as a T5678D ezrin sink that begins to accumulate membranes from other cellular locations. The membrane pool, we posit, includes cytoplasmic membranes (H,K-ATPase-rich TVs) as well as the apical membrane vacuoles. Thus for many cells one finds a high level of repolarized distribution of ezrin, F-actin, and H,K-ATPase to the basolateral membrane forming long microvillar- and filopodial-like extensions from the surface (130).

Despite extensive study on the T567 site, the ramifications of ezrin phosphorylation in the parietal cell remain a mystery as well as an exciting ongoing story. Ezrin stepped onto the parietal cell stage when stimulation was seen to effect a marked increase in phosphorylation of ezrin (known then as pp80) (39). Examination of phosphoisoforms by two-dimensional electrophoresis indicated multiple phosphorylation modifications on ezrin, and the majority of the phosphorylations were assigned to serine and threonine (12). This early observation was confirmed by more recent observations (142, 150), but we cannot rule out the possibility that some phosphoisoforms and functional activity may be due to tyrosine phosphorylation. Using epidermoid carcinoma A-431 cells, Bretscher and colleagues observed increased phosphorylation on Tyr145 and Tyr353 upon stimulation with EGF (151). Further investigation on ezrin Tyr phosphorylation in the parietal cell may help reveal ezrin function in parietal cell signaling and its function as an adaptor protein in both cell signaling and cytoskeleton organization.

SUMMARY POINTS

1. Massive membrane recycling is a striking feature of the gastric parietal cell.
2. Intracellular tubulovesicles are the resting pool of proton pumps.
3. The initial generation of tubulovesicles is the result of elevated activity of Golgi apparatus in developing parietal cells.
4. Several members of the SNARE family are indispensable for intracellular membrane trafficking and fusion in the parietal cell.
5. The abundance of syntaxin 3 on tubulovesicle membrane (usually considered vesicle membrane, compared to target membrane) supports a requirement for homotypic fusion during the fast transition from resting to stimulated state.
6. The small GTPase rab11, which is the most abundant rab in parietal cell and its localization on tubulovesicle membrane, suggests an important role in membrane trafficking, which was manifest by mutation experiments.
7. Microvillar F-actin filaments maintain a relatively stable structure in parietal cells during the cycle of rest and stimulation. An unknown factor fortifies F-actin bundles attenuating the destructive effects of F-actin depolymerizing reagents.
8. Membrane recycling in parietal cells demands a fast turnover of ezrin phosphorylation to allow a continuous readjustment of membrane-cytoskeleton interaction, which is required in both the resting and stimulation activities of parietal cells.

FUTURE ISSUES

1. How do different signal transduction pathways integrate in the parietal cell?
2. How does PKA signaling mobilize tubulovesicles?
3. What are the cognate partners for syntaxin 3, and Munc18, and how do they change in resting and stimulated conditions?
4. What is the physiological evidence to specify the functions of rab11 effectors in parietal cells?
5. What is the mechanism for protein sorting in the generation of tubulovesicles from endocytosed apical membrane during the recovery from stimulation?
6. What is the mysterious factor that maintains apical F-actin filaments more stably than other F-actin pools?
7. What are the reasons for ezrin being phosphorylated on multiple sites in addition to Thr567?
8. Why is the H,K-ATPase (H/K exchange pump) superior to other H-ATPase pumps in being evolutionarily selected for acid pumping in parietal cells? Is there a potential advantage in the location and recycling of potassium, e.g., conservation?
