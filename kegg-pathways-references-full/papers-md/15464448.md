Upon entering their host, *Plasmodium* sporozoites travel directly to the liver. Once there, they migrate through several hepatocytes before they infect a final one. During migration, sporozoites breach the plasma membrane of traversed hepatocytes, but to infect they must form a parasitophorous vacuole, in which the intra-hepatic form of the parasite grows and multiplies. During this period there is a remarkable parasite multiplication, but little is known about the requirements and strategies that are developed to be successful. Hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor on hepatocytes might enhance early *Plasmodium* development within these cells. We anticipate that this might be the basis for further studies on host-cell requirements for *Plasmodium* development.

Malaria remains the most devastating parasitic disease worldwide. In any year, ~10% of the global population will suffer from malaria – 500 million clinical cases – and more than one million will die as a result, corresponding to a death from malaria every 30 seconds. In Africa, malaria kills one child in 20 before five years of age. In addition to causing enormous human suffering, malaria impedes the economic development and stability of many developing countries. Various attempts at eradicating this disease have thus far been unsuccessful. In fact, things are getting worse, because malaria is undergoing a resurgence. This grim situation has led to the search for novel control and intervention strategies, particularly for a vaccine. These efforts have also met with limited success, highlighting the need for a detailed understanding of the basic biology and the complex life cycle of *Plasmodium* spp., the parasite that causes malaria. The biological processes that occur between the bite of a *Plasmodium*-infected mosquito and the release of merozoites into the host bloodstream remain poorly understood. These initial stages include several obligatory steps that are required to establish a successful malaria infection in a mammalian host and therefore constitute attractive targets for the development of new strategies against the disease. One such stage is the invasion and development inside hepatocytes. Although host-cell contribution in the development of intracellular pathogens (including virus,

bacteria and other protozoan parasites) is unequivocally important [1–5], little is known about *Plasmodium* sporozoite development inside hepatocytes. Experimental observations show that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor (MET) are important for early parasite development inside host cells [6]. This observation might pave the way for the understanding of other requirements for *Plasmodium* development inside host cells.

Initial steps for infection

In probing for a blood source during a bite, the infected mosquito deposits sporozoites, vasodilators and anticoagulants under the skin of the host. Each bite leaves ~15–200 sporozoites under the skin of the host [7–11], which remain in the area for ~15 min before reaching the circulatory system [12,13]. Sporozoites in the skin are believed to cross the endothelium of a blood vessel to reach the blood stream. However, it has also been proposed that sporozoites could travel via the lymphatic system [14,15]. Whatever the mechanism, sporozoites reach and recognize the liver very efficiently (reviewed in [16,17]), and have been found within hepatocytes as early as two minutes after intravenous injection into mice [18]. During this short time many things occur. Sporozoites are arrested in the liver sinusoids, after which they reach the hepatocytes for invasion. Liver endothelial cells are interspersed with Kupffer cells, which are liver-specific macrophages. Sporozoites appear to enter Kupffer cells from the circulatory system, forming an internalization vacuole; they then leave these cells from the side that is in contact with the space of Disse to reach hepatocytes [19,20]. The elimination of Kupffer cells, however, seems to enhance *Plasmodium* liver invasion [21], suggesting that if passage through Kupffer cells occurs, it is not essential for the establishment of a successful infection. Other authors have proposed that sporozoites could reach hepatocytes by squeezing between endothelial cells in a way that is similar to lymphocyte infiltration of tissues [22]. This hypothesis is based on the fact that a *Plasmodium* sporozoite molecule named TRAP (thrombospondin-related anonymous protein) possesses a type of domain that is also present in adhesion molecules and is involved in lymphocyte extravasation [23]. The precise mechanism of how sporozoites reach hepatocytes remains to be elucidated.
After crossing the sinusoids and the space of Disse in the liver, sporozoites finally reach hepatocytes, where sporozoites can develop further and produce thousands of merozoites, which will then initiate the blood stage of infection and the symptoms that are associated with malaria.

Sporozoites migrate through several hepatocytes before invading a final one with the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole, within which they develop and replicate [24]. The migration through hepatocytes occurs by breaching their plasma membranes, and the final infection takes place with the formation of an internalization vacuole around the sporozoite, which is essential for the further differentiation of the parasite. When tested *in vitro*, sporozoites from different *Plasmodium* spp. have the capacity to traverse different types of adherent cells, such as hepatocytes, fibroblasts and myocytes, from different mammalian species [24], suggesting that there are no host cell or parasite specificity requirements for this step.

It is not known why sporozoites have evolved the capacity to migrate through cells. Traversing cells is probably advantageous for a parasite that needs to reach its host cell in a very short period of time. The vast majority of sporozoites lose their invasive capacity when incubated at 37°C for 45–60 min. Therefore, the capacity to migrate through different cell types is probably essential during the initial infection in the skin of the host, where sporozoites need to cross the cells of the dermis and the endothelium to reach the lumen of a blood vessel. In addition, sporozoites might use this mechanism to cross endothelial or Kupffer cells to reach hepatocytes. It was recently described that *Plasmodium berghei* (a rodent *Plasmodium* spp.) mutant parasites, which were generated by the disruption of a gene called *spect* (sporozoite microneme protein essential for cell traversal), do not traverse cells *in vitro* and have reduced infectivity *in vivo* [25]. This suggests that traversing cells is a required feature for the malaria parasite to cross the liver sinusoidal cell layer [25].

Another step for which the migration through host cells seems to be required for malaria infection is the activation of sporozoites before hepatocyte invasion with the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole. Sporozoites possess two types of secretory apical organelles, micronemes and rhoptries [22]. Migration through cells activates the exocytosis of sporozoite apical organelles [26], which results in the release of parasite molecules, such as TRAP, that are essential for invasion. The incubation of sporozoites (from two different rodent *Plasmodium* species, *P. berghei* and *Plasmodium yoelii*) with host-cell lysates also induces the exocytosis of sporozoite apical organelles [26], suggesting that, during migration through cells, sporozoites contact host-cell cytosolic factors that activate exocytosis. Unpublished observations indicate that pyrimidine nucleotides, which are found in the cytosol of host cells in high concentrations, induce exocytosis in sporozoites through a Ca²⁺- and cAMP-mediated signaling pathway. Exocytosis is induced at least 10 min after incubation with the stimulus and it is probable that sporozoites have time to migrate through several cells before exocytosis is induced. It is not clear how sporozoites regulate exocytosis to prevent activation before reaching the host liver, because traversing the cytosol of cells in the skin would also be sufficient to trigger exocytosis. It is possible that the delay in the exocytic response might enable sufficient time for sporozoites to reach the liver. Alternatively, the parasite might have developed specific regulatory mechanisms to prevent exocytosis activation before reaching its target cell.

If exocytosis is induced by an alternative stimulus, such as Ca²⁺ ionophores or host-cell lysates, sporozoites reduce their migration through host cells and increase their infectivity, indicating that once exocytosis occurs, sporozoites are ready for hepatocyte infection [26]. The behavior of *spect*-deficient sporozoites [25] apparently contradicts this hypothesis, because they infect host cells *in vitro* without previous migration through cells. However, it is possible that the lack of SPECT affects the regulation of exocytosis and these parasites might be activated for infection by the same mechanism as sporozoites incubated with ionophores or host-cell lysates. In this case, *spect*-deficient sporozoites would not require further activation and would skip the activatory step of migration. Investigations are underway to address the involvement of SPECT in exocytosis.

Moreover, sporozoite migration through host cells leads to another aspect of liver infection: the development of the parasite inside infected hepatocytes. The wounding of hepatocytes by *P. berghei* and *P. yoelii* sporozoite migration induces the secretion of a host-cell factor, which renders neighboring hepatocytes susceptible to infection [6]. This factor is HGF, the release of which results in the activation of the cognate receptor, MET, a step that is crucial for infection [6]. Once more, the evidence provided by *spect*-deficient sporozoites seems to contradict these results. *Spect*-deficient parasites do not migrate through cells *in vitro* [25] and, therefore, would not induce host cells to produce HGF and infection would be inhibited. However, these sporozoites efficiently infect host cells *in vitro* [25]. The reason for this apparent discrepancy might be found in the particular characteristics of the *in vitro* cell system used for infection. The hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cells) already expresses a considerable level of HGF and presents a certain level of MET activation before sporozoite migration. These constitutive levels of HGF are probably enough to support sporozoite infection at a basal level; therefore, the additional production of HGF that is induced by migration would not be required. This is different from the situation *in vivo*, in which hepatocytes do not express HGF constitutively, but its expression is induced by the wounding that is caused by sporozoite migration [6]. It is still not known whether *spect*-deficient sporozoites migrate through hepatocytes *in vivo*.

Why is HGF-MET signaling important for the success of infection?

The answer to this apparently simple question is probably very complex. The stimulation of MET by its natural ligand, HGF, results in pleiotropic biological and biochemical effects within the cell, leading to cell scattering,
proliferation, enhanced cell motility, angiogenesis and the invasion of extracellular matrices. Under physiological conditions, MET activation is required for morphogenic cell movements through the matrix and for the ordered building of epithelial tubules. Upon HGF stimulation, two receptor molecules dimerize and cross-phosphorylate each other, thereby creating binding sites for signaling molecules within the cell. By recruiting adaptor proteins such as Gab1 and Grb2, the MET receptor induces the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-Akt, phospholipase Cγ and ERK 1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and the phosphorylation of several other signal transducers and activators of transcription factors (Figure 1).

The initial attempts to determine the role that HGF-MET signaling has on infection were based on the timescale of hepatocyte infection that required such signaling. Because *Listeria*, another intracellular pathogen, uses MET as a receptor to enter host cells [27,28], it was first examined whether the same was true for *P. berghei* sporozoites, but it has been unequivocally demonstrated that HGF-MET signaling is not required during hepatocyte invasion. Blocking antibodies against HGF significantly reduced infection when added to hepatocytes up to 4h post-infection [6]. These results seem to indicate a role for MET activation during the beginning of parasite development inside the host cell. During the first hour of incubation, sporozoites migrate through cells, inducing cell wounding, which causes the de novo expression and secretion of HGF ~1–3h later. Therefore, MET-dependent signaling in hepatocytes during early parasite development (1–3h) must be considered. It is known that HGF leads, within minutes of stimulation, to the transient activation of GTPases of the Rho family, which correlates with a profound remodeling of the cell actin cytoskeleton [29].

Upon HGF stimulation, two receptor molecules dimerize and cross-phosphorylate each other, thereby creating binding sites for signaling molecules within the cell. The role of the different signaling pathways activated has been investigated (reviewed in [44]); the main biological activities resulting from the activation of each of the transducers are shown.

pathogens subvert normal host-cell processes to create a specialized niche, which enhances their survival. A common and recurring target of pathogens is the host-cell cytoskeleton, which is used for many different purposes, including attachment, entry into cells, movement within and between cells, vacuole formation and remodeling, and the avoidance of phagocytosis and/or lysosomal fusion (reviewed in [3]).

A role for host-cell cytoskeleton in *Plasmodium* development inside host cells

The depolymerization of actin with cytochalasin-D significantly decreased the infection of hepatoma cell lines with *P. berghei* sporozoites when added to infected cells 2h post-infection [6]. Because cytochalasin-D is added to the culture that contains both host cells and parasites (the latter already inside the cells), it cannot be ruled out that the drug is affecting the parasite, thus impeding its development. However, the fact that the pre-treatment of host cells with HGF abrogates the cytochalasin-D effect [6] strongly suggests that the drug acts on the hepatoma cells and that the effect of HGF-MET on infection might be due to a host-cell actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Moreover, the staining of infected hepatocytes to visualize actin indicates that 2h after the infection of hepatocytes, several sporozoites show a recruitment of actin. This recruitment was observed consistently in all experiments performed (3–5 sporozoites in six distinct experiments) and was never detected in experiments with cells treated with cytochalasin-D [6]. Altogether, these results provide the first indication that the host-cell cytoskeleton has a relevant role in the outcome of a *Plasmodium* sporozoite infection [6].

Once inside a host cell, and although some intracellular pathogens (e.g. *Leishmania*) succeed in the harsh phagolysosomal environment and others (e.g. *Trypanosoma*) lyse their vacuole and escape to the host-cell cytoplasm, the majority of pathogens modify their vacuole to suit their needs [30–32]. Vacuole remodeling by pathogens is an active process that involves both the blocking of fusion with certain compartments and the promotion of fusion with others. Because the cytoskeleton is involved in membrane trafficking events, manipulation of the cytoskeleton is a potential instrument for pathogens to influence these processes. An interesting example is found with the bacteria *Salmonella*, in which actin and microtubules are also used for the remodeling of the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole, which is required for parasite replication [33]. Closer to the *Plasmodium* spp. is the protozoan parasite *Toxoplasma*, which is frequently used as a model organism for *Plasmodium*. *Toxoplasma* resides in a specially modified compartment that resists fusion with the host endocytic network and, as such, it is protected from digestion and remains segregated from antigen-processing pathways [34]. In *Toxoplasma*, the resistance to fusion is possibly mediated by a process generated at the time of entry that modifies the content of the vacuole to remove host-cell membrane proteins [35]. In addition, at the time of invasion there is the formation of empty vacuoles (evacuoles), created by the secretion of the apical organelle rhoptries in the host-cell cytoplasm that
fuse back with the *Toxoplasma*-containing vacuole [36]. This process has also been proposed to be important for modifying the components of the vacuole membrane in *Toxoplasma* [37]. It is unknown whether a similar mechanism takes place during *Plasmodium* infection.

### A role for host-cell apoptosis in *Plasmodium* infection maintenance

In addition to the influence that HGF has on the host-cell cytoskeleton that seems to be important during the early development of sporozoites inside hepatocytes, some observations also suggest an additional role for HGF in *Plasmodium* infections. Because the activation of HGF-MET signaling increases the number of cells infected without having a role in the invasive process, it is likely that it acts by preventing the death of infected cells. In fact, the number of infected cells by both *P. falciparum* and *P. berghei* sporozoites in vitro decreases over time after the infection of human primary hepatocyte and HepG2 cell cultures [38, 39]. Given that HGF-MET signaling promotes hepatocyte resistance to apoptosis [40, 41], it is likely that HGF-MET activation prevents the death of a proportion of infected cells that would otherwise undergo apoptosis. The inhibition of host-cell apoptosis is advantageous for an intracellular pathogen, enabling it to prolong its life in the infected cell and to complete proliferation. The inhibition of apoptosis by several bacteria and intracellular parasites, such as *Leishmania* and *Toxoplasma*, has also been documented [42, 43]. In malaria infections, however, *Plasmodium* sporozoites seem to use a unique feature, because they take advantage of a host molecule that is not secreted by the infected cell but by neighboring cells that have previously been traversed by the parasite.

Upon HGF ligation, MET mediates the coordinated execution of multiple cellular processes. It is conceivable that some of these processes might have a role during the development of *Plasmodium* sporozoites within cells. Studies performed on MET mutants, in which the tyrosines that are involved in signal transduction have been removed, have elucidated some of the signaling pathways that are required for the different biological responses elicited by HGF, enabling the identification of different signaling pathways for motility, growth and protection from apoptosis [44]. Thus, the use of these mutants could help to determine the influence that distinct pathways have on a malaria infection.

### Sporozoites from different *Plasmodium* spp. behave differently

*Plasmodium* includes ~100 different species that infect distinct vertebrate hosts. Four of these species can infect humans, of which *Plasmodium falciparum* is responsible for most of the mortality that is associated with malaria. Because dynamic studies of the human-*Plasmodium* interaction are not possible, the use of rodent malaria models is necessary. However, there are differences concerning infection requirements among different species of *Plasmodium* sporozoites. In fact, it has been known for more than 30 years that, unlike *P. falciparum*, *P. berghei* (a rodent malaria parasite) fully develops in the

human hepatoma cell line HepG2 [45]. In addition, *P. berghei* is much more promiscuous, because parasite development occurs in many cell types in which *P. falciparum* and *P. yoelii* sporozoites cannot replicate [6]. Recently, it has been shown that *P. yoelii* and *P. falciparum* invade hepatocytes by the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole through a CD81-dependent pathway, whereas *P. berghei* can infect cells that do not express CD81 [46]. This probably accounts for the observed differences among parasite species; however, it is still not known whether this discrepancy results from a distinct receptor usage or from different requirements concerning the conformation or activity of other receptors, or even because there is an alternative pathway for the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole. Special attention should be taken when extrapolating results obtained from animal models to the human infection.

#### New hints for prophylactic intervention?

The targets of vaccines, and of most antimalarial drugs, are components of the parasite. Many of these targets are involved in the host-parasite interactions that are essential for the survival and growth of the parasite and/or are involved in the pathology that is caused by the infection. A possible alternative to current strategies is to modulate the host components that are known to interact with molecules generated by the parasites. This strategy initially seems counterintuitive: an important requirement of traditional anti-microbial chemotherapy is not to interfere with functions of the host. However, the targeting of host components has the advantage that drug resistance cannot result from alterations of the drug target. Two important classes of antimalarial drugs, the quinolines and the artemisinins, are exceptional in that they target heme, a component of the host [47]. Resistance to quinolines developed very slowly because it required the selection of variants that affect drug transport [48]. Resistance is even less likely to occur if the targeted host component does not directly interact with the pathogen. In the specific case of HGF-MET, the target is generated by the host, is required by malaria parasites to establish an infection and is not enclosed within membranes of the parasite. The inactivation of the MET receptor results in the prevention of malaria infection, both in vitro and in vivo [6]. Therefore, HGF and MET are possible targets for a novel strategy for the prevention of malaria infections. Other molecules that are suitable for the reduction of infection would be those that interfere with HGF production by wounded hepatocytes, with the proteolytic cleavage of HGF into its active form or, more likely, with the binding of HGF to its receptor, MET. Some molecules have already been shown to act as HGF antagonists and can bind to the receptor without activating it, therefore further competing with HGF binding [49]. In addition, and because HGF-MET signaling is crucial for *Plasmodium* sporozoite development inside host cells, compounds that interfere with MET signal transduction should prevent the *Plasmodium* infection of hepatocytes and thus prevent a malaria infection. The ability of compounds, such as MET-specific protein tyrosine inhibitors or blocking antibodies, to prevent malaria infection by
targeting MET-induced signal transduction is a new and exciting challenge in this field.

**Concluding remarks**

Many questions remain regarding the first steps of malaria infection in mammalian hosts. In particular, the biological mechanisms of *Plasmodium* sporozoite development into merozoites inside hepatocytes remain poorly understood. This specific point of such a complex lifecycle presents an interesting intellectual challenge: to characterize and understand the crucial host–parasite interactions that are needed for a successful infection. However, novel strategies to prevent disease are needed. Only by conquering the first challenge will effective intervention become realistically attainable.
