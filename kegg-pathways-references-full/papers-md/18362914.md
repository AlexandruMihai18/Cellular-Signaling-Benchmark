The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor best known for mediating the toxicity of dioxin<sup>1</sup>. Environmental factors are believed to contribute to the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases, many of which are due to the activity of T<sub>H</sub>17 T cells, a new helper T-cell subset characterized by the production of the cytokine IL-17. Here we show that in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell lineage of mice AHR expression is restricted to the T<sub>H</sub>17 cell subset and its ligation results in the production of the T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokine interleukin (IL)-22. AHR is also expressed in human T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. Activation of AHR by a high-affinity ligand during T<sub>H</sub>17 cell development markedly increases the proportion of T<sub>H</sub>17 T cells and their production of cytokines. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from AHR-deficient mice can develop T<sub>H</sub>17 cell responses, but when confronted with AHR ligand fail to produce IL-22 and do not show enhanced T<sub>H</sub>17 cell development. AHR activation during induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis causes accelerated onset and increased pathology in wild-type mice, but not AHR-deficient mice. AHR ligands may therefore represent co-factors in the development of autoimmune diseases.

Although CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from AHR-deficient mice could differentiate into T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, they lacked the expression of IL-22 (Fig. 1c). IL-22, originally defined as a hepatocyte-stimulating factor<sup>7</sup>, is co-expressed with IL-17 by T<sub>H</sub>17 T cells and its expression is thought to be enhanced by dendritic-cell-derived IL-23 (refs 8, 9). The biological functions of IL-22 are not fully understood: on the one hand IL-22 seems to be pro-inflammatory, inducing dermal inflammation and pro-inflammatory gene expression in the skin<sup>8,10</sup>, on the other hand IL-22 delivery ameliorates T-cell-mediated liver injury in T-cell-mediated hepatitis<sup>11,12</sup>.

AHR resides in the cytoplasm in complex with Hsp90 until binding of ligand triggers conformational changes resulting in an exchange of Hsp90 for the nuclear translocation component ARNT (reviewed in ref. 1). *Arnt* was found expressed in all CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets (data not shown). Ligation of AHR by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a tryptophan-derived photoproduct that is thought to be an endogenous ligand with high affinity for the AHR receptor, upregulates genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes such as *Cyp1a1* (ref. 13).

To test whether exposure of T cells to FICZ influences differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to effector cells, we added FICZ during the *in vitro* differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T-cell subsets. The addition of FICZ did not induce *Ahr* expression or its downstream target *Cyp1a1* in T<sub>H</sub>0, T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2 and iT<sub>reg</sub> T-cell subsets (Fig. 2a) and did not alter their expression of *Ifng*, *Il4*, *Il21* nor their lineage-defining transcription factors (Supplementary Fig. 1c). However, the presence of FICZ during T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-inducing conditions led to strong upregulation of *Il17a*, *Il17f* and particularly of *Il22* mRNA expression (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a).

Comparison of T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from wild-type B6 and AHR-deficient mice by intracellular staining showed that exposure of B6 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to FICZ under T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-inducing conditions strongly enhanced IL-17A and IL-17F production and increased the proportion and staining intensity of cells producing IL-22 (Fig. 2b, top panels and Supplementary Fig. 2b). In contrast, IL-17A and IL-17F production was attenuated in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells from AHR-deficient mice and no IL-22 was detectable whether FICZ was present or not (Fig. 2b, bottom panels). A similar response was seen with another AHR ligand, β-naphthoflavone, which has lower affinity for AHR and consequently requires about a 10-fold higher dose compared with FICZ (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Similar to mouse, human T<sub>H</sub>17 cells reacted to AHR ligation with increased expression of *IL17A*, *IL17F* and *IL22* as well as induction of *CYP1A1* (Fig. 2c).

To test whether *Ahr* expression on its own is essential and sufficient to drive IL-22 expression, we performed retroviral transduction of sorted naive AHR-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with an AHR–green

fluorescent protein (GFP) construct or a GFP vector control construct. Transduction under neutral, T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2 or iT<sub>reg</sub> conditions did not reconstitute IL-22 expression even in the presence of FICZ (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, under T<sub>H</sub>17-cell-inducing conditions, reconstitution of AHR expression by retroviral transduction induced expression of IL-22 (Fig. 3a, top-right panel) and increased the proportion of IL-17-producing cells (Fig. 3b, top-right panel). Exposure to FICZ resulted in a substantial increase in IL-22 (Fig. 3a, bottom-right panel) as well as the enhanced expression of IL-17A (Fig. 3b, bottom right panel). PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) analysis of cultured *Ahr*-transduced T<sub>H</sub>17 cells confirmed the increase in *Il17* expression, the enhancement of *Il22* as well as the induction of the *Ahr* target *Cyp1a1* on exposure to FICZ (Fig. 3c). Thus, *Ahr* expression is only functional in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that have differentiated to the T<sub>H</sub>17 lineage.

Next we immunized B6 mice with myelin oligodendrocyte peptide 35–55 (MOG<sub>35–55</sub>) in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), removed draining lymph nodes 7 days later and isolated CCR6<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (which are enriched in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>14,15</sup>) to test whether *Ahr* is also

expressed in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells generated *in vivo*. CCR6<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed *Ahr*, *Il17a*, *Il17f*, *Il22* and *Rorc*, whereas the CCR6<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell fraction lacked expression of *Ahr* and T<sub>H</sub>17 markers, confirming that physiological differentiation *in vivo* recapitulates *in vitro* differentiation (Fig. 4a).

T<sub>H</sub>17 T cells have a prominent role in the pathology of autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is induced by immunization with MOG peptide 35–55 and CFA. Analysis of spinal cord at the height of the EAE response on day 18 showed increased numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IL-17 and IL-22 in B6 mice treated with MOG<sub>35–55</sub>/CFA and FICZ, whereas AHR-deficient mice showed reduced numbers of IL-17-producing T cells and minimal numbers of IL-22 producers (Fig. 4b). There was no difference in the numbers of *Foxp3*-expressing regulatory T cells in spinal cord in the three groups of mice.

Whereas B6 mice developed EAE with a mean day of onset of 13.9, AHR-deficient mice developed EAE with delayed kinetics (mean day of onset 15.6) in line with the attenuated T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation seen *in vitro*. Despite the delayed onset of EAE, most AHR-deficient mice succumbed to disease eventually (Fig. 4c, e). Stimulation of AHR by inclusion of FICZ in the antigen emulsion accelerated the onset (day 11.7) and increased the severity of EAE in B6 mice, but, as expected, did not influence the onset or severity of EAE in AHR-deficient mice

(day 15.8) (Fig. 4c, e). To assess the influence of AHR deficiency in haematopoietic or non-haematopoietic cells, we also induced EAE in chimaeras constructed either by injection of AHR-deficient bone marrow into irradiated wild-type mice (AHR-B6) or by injection of B6 wild-type bone marrow into irradiated AHR-deficient mice (B6-AHR). AHR-B6 chimaeras showed attenuated EAE like AHR-deficient mice, whereas B6-AHR chimaeras developed EAE with kinetics and severity similar to wild-type mice (Fig. 4d).

Studies on the effect of AHR stimulation on the immune system have so far focused exclusively on TCDD as a ligand because of its toxicological relevance. Although adverse effects of TCDD on immune responses are well documented$^{16}$, no direct measurements of AHR expression on highly purified polarized subsets of CD4${}^{+}$ T cells have been reported. TCDD, which cannot be metabolized and therefore causes prolonged stimulation of AHR in many cells of the body, is known to induce profound suppression of immune responses in wild-type, but not AHR-deficient, mice$^{16}$, but despite decades of research the underlying mechanisms for this profound toxicity remain unclear. More recently, it has been suggested that TCDD promotes the generation of regulatory T cells$^{17}$ while causing the premature decline of activated CD4${}^{+}$ T cells. In our hands, stimulation of AHR by FICZ did not influence the number of regulatory T cells during MOG${}_{35-55}$-induced EAE responses (see Fig. 4b). It is conceivable that the high toxicity of TCDD for effector cells causes a proportional shift in regulatory T cells—which are, in general, more resistant to many depletion regimes$^{18,19}$—due to the death of other cells, rather than an actual expansion in numbers. Although TCDD may be the classical AHR ligand used in the toxicology field to analyse the effects of AHR activation, it is clear that it is not a natural ligand and it is widely recognized that pollutants such as TCDD are unlikely to have provided the evolutionary pressure for the function of this highly conserved system. There is ongoing debate in the toxicology field about what is the most relevant physiological ligand for AHR$^{20}$. Nevertheless, compelling indirect evidence shows that ultraviolet photoproducts of tryptophan, such as the high-affinity ligand FICZ studied in our paper, could be synthesized *in vivo* as exposure of human skin to ultraviolet light induces CYP1A1 (ref. 21).

studies focusing on additional physiological ligands of AHR that can be metabolized by the CYP1 enzymes and therefore cause only transient AHR activation may give further insights into the consequences of AHR stimulation in T${}_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cells.

Our data show that AHR, in addition to promoting the expression of IL-22, enhances T${}_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cell development and the expression levels of IL-17A and IL-17F, and consequently increases autoimmune pathology. Blockade of IL-17A with an auto-vaccine as well as neutralizing antibody can completely prevent the development of EAE$^{22,23}$, emphasizing the central role of IL-17A in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease. Although it has been suggested that IL-22 may contribute to autoimmune pathology because, like IL-17, it disrupts blood-brain barrier tight junctions$^{24}$, IL-22-deficient mice do not seem to have altered susceptibility to EAE induction$^{25}$, suggesting that this cytokine may be dispensable for the development of pathology in EAE. Thus, the enhancement of IL-17 production by AHR ligation may be more crucial than the induction of IL-22 in determining disease severity.

It is currently thought that IL-22 expression depends on induction by IL-23 (refs 8, 9). Re-stimulation of lymph node cells from mice immunized with MOG${}_{35-55}$/CFA or MOG${}_{35-55}$/CFA and FICZ in the presence or absence of IL-23 showed that IL-23 increased the proportion of IL-17-producing cells both from wild-type and AHR-deficient mice (Supplementary Fig. 4, left), but only had a small effect on the production of IL-22 (Supplementary Fig. 4b, right), suggesting that IL-23 has some effect independent of AHR ligation, although clearly stimulation of AHR seems to be the dominant pathway for IL-22 production.

How AHR interacts with the T<sub>H</sub>17 pathway is currently unknown, but there is a substantial amount of literature (reviewed in ref. 26) describing interactions of AHR with other key regulatory proteins including nuclear factor-κB<sup>27</sup>, which has a role in the induction of EAE<sup>28</sup>. The core nucleotide sequence to which the nuclear AHR complex binds, also termed the ‘xenobiotic responsive element’<sup>29</sup>, occurs frequently in the mammalian genome and is also represented in IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22 and ROR-γt. Although basal expression of AHR and IL-22 is detectable in T<sub>H</sub>17 T cells in the apparent absence of a ligand, there are numerous endogenous agents that can activate AHR, such as prostaglandins, bilirubin at high concentration, modified low-density lipoprotein and various modifications of tryptophan, whose ultraviolet-light-irradiated photoconversion into the high-affinity ligand FICZ is only one example (reviewed in ref. 20). Autoimmune diseases are multifactorial, depending on intrinsic components such as genetics, hormones or age, and environmental factors, including infections, diet, drugs and chemicals. The increasing prevalence of certain autoimmune diseases in highly industrialized countries is probably connected to such environmental factors. Our data linking a transcription factor responsive to environmental pollutants to the T<sub>H</sub>17 programme open intriguing possibilities regarding the potential of such factors to initiate or augment autoimmune conditions, and warrant closer examination of a possible role of AHR in human autoimmune diseases.

### METHODS SUMMARY

**Mice.** C57BL/6 (B6) and AHR-deficient mice on a B6 background (B6 BRA AHRKO)<sup>3</sup>, originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory via A. Smith, were bred in the specified pathogen free (SPF) facility at NIMR. All animal experiments were done according to institutional guidelines and Home Office regulations.

**Human T-cell culture.** Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy volunteer were isolated by Ficoll/Paque, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified by magnetic sorting and cultured at 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in plates coated with anti-CD3 (1 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) and anti-CD28 (1 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) in the presence of 10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-1 and 40 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-6 (T<sub>H</sub>17 condition) or 3 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-12, 10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-2 and 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> anti-TGF-β (T<sub>H</sub>1 condition). Quantitative PCR analysis for T<sub>H</sub>17 markers and AHR expression was performed on day 4.

**In vitro T-cell differentiation and cytokine staining.** A detailed description of procedures is given in Methods.

**Real-time PCR.** The expression of mRNA for transcription factors and cytokines in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets was analysed 4–5 days after T-cell activation using specific primers from Applied Biosystems and expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene *Hprt*. More details and a list of primers used can be found in Methods.

**Retroviral transduction.** AHR was cloned into vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) generating a bicistronic mRNA encoding AHR and, separated by an IRES element, EGFP. Viruses were generated by simultaneous CaCl<sub>2</sub>-mediated transient transfections of 293T cells with three plasmids providing vector, Gag-Pol, and Env functions. Details of the transduction protocol are given in Methods.

**EAE induction.** EAE was induced and scored as described previously<sup>30</sup>. Some mice received 600 ng FICZ in the antigen emulsion. Draining lymph nodes were isolated 7 days after immunization. Spinal cord was isolated on day 18 after EAE induction for determination of cell numbers.

*In vitro* T-cell differentiation and cytokine staining. Naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a MoFlo sorter of lymph node cell suspensions for CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. Natural T<sub>reg</sub> cells were sorted from lymph node suspensions as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells.

Conditions for different cell subsets were: T<sub>H</sub>0 (anti-IFN-γ plus anti-IL-4 plus anti-TGF-β), T<sub>H</sub>1 (4 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-12), T<sub>H</sub>2 (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-4 and anti-IFN-γ), iT<sub>reg</sub> (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> TGF-β and anti-IFN-γ) or T<sub>H</sub>17 (20 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-6 plus 1 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> TGF-β plus 10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-1β and anti-IFN-γ). Neutralizing antibodies were used at a concentration of 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>: clone R46A2 anti-IFN-γ, clone 11B11 anti-IL-4 and clone 1D11 anti-TGF-β.

The AHR ligands FICZ (BioMol) or β-naphthoflavone (Sigma) were added in some experiments at the start of culture. For measurements of intracellular cytokines, T cells were re-stimulated with 500 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> phorbol dibutyrate and 500 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> ionomycin in the presence of brefeldin A for 4 h on day 5 after initiation of cultures. IL-17A antibody was obtained from eBioSciences; IL-17F antibody was from R&D. The anti-IL-22 antibody (MH22B2) was generated in IL-22 knockout BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant human IL-22 crosslinked to ovalbumin in the presence of glutaraldehyde and cross-reacts with human and murine IL-22.

Retroviral transduction. FACS-sorted naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were plated in antibody-coated wells as described above in the absence of cytokines on day 0. On day 1, fresh retrovirus supernatant was added together with cytokines for polarization and the cells were spun for 1 h at 1,200 r.p.m. Thereafter, the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 200 nM AHR ligand FICZ for another 4 days and then assayed by RT–PCR and intracellular staining.

Generation of bone marrow chimaeras. 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> bone marrow cells from B6 donors or AHR-deficient donors were injected into lethally (9.5 Gy) irradiated AHR-deficient hosts (B6-AHR chimaeras) or B6 hosts (AHR- B6 chimaeras). Bone marrow donors were differentiated from the hosts by an allotypic marker (CD45.1). Chimaeras were tested for reconstitution 8 weeks after bone marrow transfer.
