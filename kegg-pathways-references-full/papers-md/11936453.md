### Introduction

Mammalian salivary glands are mainly composed of two epithelial cell types, the acinar cells that secrete the salivary fluid as well as most of the salivary proteins, and the ductal cells that secrete some protein and modify the ionic composition of the saliva as they convey it to the mouth. For a variety of reasons, including their physiological interest, their relative abundance and ease of preparation, and their robust stimulation-secretion responses, salivary acinar cells have been intensively studied and many of their properties are well, albeit certainly not completely, understood. Although salivary ducts have also received considerable experimental attention, particularly over the past 10 years, less is known about their behavior. Because of this and because of the central role of the acinar cells in salivary fluid and protein secretion, we will concentrate almost exclusively on them in this article. For more information on salivary ducts, the interested reader is referred to several recent reviews and the references therein (Cook *et al.*, 1994; Young and Cook, 1996; Cook *et al.*, 1998). It is also worth mentioning at this point that most of the information presented below has been obtained from the salivary glands of experimental animals (mainly rats and rabbits). Except for morphologic studies and several non-invasive procedures, such as the collection of saliva after the application of various stimuli, experiments using human salivary tissues are rare. However, in those cases where the functional properties of human salivary acini have been investigated, they appear to conform well to the results and conclusions derived from animal studies.

### Salivary Fluid Secretion

The easiest way to understand the proposed mechanisms of salivary fluid secretion is to consider a specific model. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a salivary acinar cell. The cell contains four ion transporters: the Na⁺/K⁺ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), a Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ cotransporter, and a Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channel, all located in the basolateral membrane, and a Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channel located in the apical membrane. Fluid secretion is thought to arise from the concerted actions of these four transporters as follows. The Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase maintains intracellular Na⁺ concentration low and intracellular K⁺ concentration high relative to the interstitium by exchanging 3Na⁺ for 2K⁺ at the expense of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ cotransporter (also known as NKCC1) is a secondary active transport system that transports 1Na⁺, 1K⁺, and 2Cl⁻ into the cell in a tightly coupled fashion. Because of the extracellular to intracellular Na⁺ gradient maintained by the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase, Cl⁻ is likewise concentrated in the acinar cytoplasm above electrochemical equilibrium by NKCC1. In the resting (unstimulated) state, intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration is low, and the Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels are therefore closed. But when the cell is stimulated by secretagogues (*in situ*, typically the muscarinic agonist acetylcholine), intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration rises, and the K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels open. These Ca²⁺-associated changes in K⁺ and Cl⁻ conductance allow KCl to flow out of the cell, resulting in the accumulation of Cl⁻ ions and their associated negative electrical charge in the acinar lumen. Na⁺ is then thought to follow Cl⁻ by leaking from the interstitium through the tight junctions between the cells to preserve electroneutrality, and the resulting osmotic gradient for NaCl causes a transepithelial movement of water from interstitium to lumen. In the continued presence of the secretagogue, a net transepithelial Cl⁻ flux and a concomitant secretion of fluid is sustained as a result of Cl⁻ entry via NKCC1 and exit via the apical Cl⁻ channel. When the stimulus is removed, the secretory process ceases.

Figure 1 Model for salivary fluid secretion based on active transepithelial Cl⁻ transport and the osmotic coupling of salt and water fluxes (see text for details)

removed the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration falls to resting levels, the K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels close, and the cell returns to its resting state.

As discussed in more detail below, considerable experimental evidence indicates that the mechanism presented in Figure 1 can account for most of the salivary secretion from rat, rabbit and presumably human, major salivary glands. However, there is also evidence that two alternate mechanisms based on the same osmotic coupling principle outlined in Figure 1 (viz., transepithelial anion transport driving the secretion of salt followed by osmotically obliged water) can also make significant contributions to salivary fluid secretion. The first of these differs in the Cl⁻ entry step. Here, NKCC1 is replaced by a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger and a Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger (Figure 2a). In this model the decrease in intracellular Cl⁻ concentration resulting from secretagogue-induced KCl loss leads to increased Cl⁻ entry via the Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger. The HCO₃⁻ is then replaced by the diffusion of CO₂ into the cell and its conversion into HCO₃⁻ plus H⁺ by carbonic anhydrase (CA). Finally the H⁺ is pumped out of the cell by the Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger using the extracellular to intracellular Na⁺ gradient generated by Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase. The net result is the movement of NaCl into the cell in exchange for CO₂ that simply recycles across the basolateral membrane. The other alternate mechanism (Figure 2b) involves the secretion of HCO₃⁻ rather than Cl⁻. Here CO₂ enters the acinar cell across the basolateral membrane and is converted to HCO₃⁻ plus H⁺ by intracellular CA. HCO₃⁻ is secreted across the apical membrane via an anion channel, possibly the same channel involved in Cl⁻ secretion, and the H⁺ is extruded by the basolateral Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger. Recent data suggest that a basolateral Na⁺-HCO₃⁻ cotransporter may also be responsible for some of the HCO₃⁻ entry (Roussa et al., 1999) although this is still rather speculative.

Space does not permit us to review all of the experimental data related to the mechanism of salivary fluid secretion. Instead we will briefly discuss some of the early evidence that supports the involvement of the three mechanisms of fluid secretion introduced above and then mention some studies involving more recent experimental approaches. For more comprehensive treatments we suggest several review articles (Nauntofte, 1992; Turner, 1993; Cook et al., 1994; Young and Cook, 1996) as well as more recent original reports referenced below. Briefly stated, the existing data from whole animal studies, perfused glands, isolated acini, and acinar plasma membranes demonstrate that all of the membrane transport systems illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 are present in salivary acinar cells and function in a way consistent with the proposed mechanisms for fluid secretion. In addition they provide convincing evidence that these mechanisms can account for the fluid secretion observed.

As already alluded to above, salivary fluid secretion appears to be a two-stage process as first proposed by Thaysen, Thorn and Schwartz (1954); that is, saliva is initially formed as a near isotonic plasma-like primary secretion in the acinar lumen (the first stage), then the

salivary ducts modify this primary fluid by removing sodium and chloride and adding potassium and bicarbonate to produce a final hypotonic fluid that enters the mouth. The plasma-like ionic composition of the primary saliva has been confirmed by analysing the electrolyte content of fluid collected from the acinar lumen using micropuncture techniques (Young and Cook, 1996; Martinez, 1987). This property of the primary saliva is in general agreement with the operation of some combination of the secretory mechanisms discussed above and with the prevailing view that osmotically driven fluid transport is typically near isotonic owing to the relatively high water permeability of fluid transporting epithelia (Spring, 1999). The impermeability of the salivary ducts to water and their ability to modify the ionic composition of the primary fluid as required have also been confirmed (Martinez, 1987; Young and Cook, 1996).

A series of experiments with perfused rat and rabbit submandibular glands carried out in the 1980s were particularly important in focusing experimental attention on the mechanisms discussed above (see Turner, 1993 for a more detailed review and specific references). These studies showed that acetylcholine-induced salivary secretion is markedly reduced (~70%) when Cl⁻ is replaced in a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻-replete perfusate by a physiologically inert anion, or when inhibitors of NKCC1 were present in the perfusate. The effect of NKCC1 inhibitors was even more dramatic in HCO₃⁻-free media where the inhibition of fluid secretion was >95%. These results, taken together with other supporting data, strongly suggested that the mechanism illustrated in Figure 1 was responsible for most of the fluid secretion. In addition, the residual secretion observed in Cl⁻ free but HCO₃⁻ replete media was HCO₃⁻ rich and blocked by inhibitors of CA or the Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger. This component of fluid secretion was therefore consistent with the presence of the mechanism illustrated in Figure 2b. Other less direct observations indicated the operation of the mechanism illustrated in Figure 2a as well. In the perfused rat submandibular gland Pirani et al (1987) estimated that the mechanisms illustrated in Figures 1, 2a and b contributed to anion secretion and thus fluid secretion in the ratio 16:3:2.

Although there is convincing evidence that all three of the mechanisms discussed above make significant contributions to the fluid secreted by the rabbit submandibular, rat submandibular and rat parotid glands, this is not the case for all salivary glands. Thus, for example, the mechanisms shown in Figure 2a and b appear to play little if any role in fluid secretion from human labial glands (Paulais et al, 1996), while only the mechanism shown in Figure 2b is operative in the bovine parotid (Lee and Turner, 1993). This latter observation is consistent with the observation that ruminant saliva contains very high levels of bicarbonate (~100 mM), which is required to buffer the acid produced by microbial fermentation in the rumen.

The reason for the presence of three fluid secretory mechanisms in the same gland is still not yet clear. Moreover, somewhat surprisingly the available evidence

indicates that when multiple mechanisms are present they coexist in the same acinar cells (Turner and George, 1988; Lee and Turner, 1991). It is possible that the cell is able to modulate the contributions of the various mechanisms according to certain physiological circumstances, for example brief versus sustained periods of salivary flow. But at present there is no convincing evidence that anything like this occurs.

In a recent paper Evans et al (2000) have studied salivary secretion in mice in which the gene for NKCC1 has been disrupted and no expression of this protein is detectable. Stimulated salivary flow rates in these NKCC1 knockout mice are only 40% of those observed in normal littermates. Interestingly, these authors also found that the activity of the Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger was increased in parotid acinar cells from NKCC1 knockout mice suggesting that fluid secretion via the mechanism shown in Figure 2a is increased in these animals to compensate for the loss of NKCC1. In addition to reduced salivary flow, NKCC1 knockout mice also exhibited a number of other abnormalities, the most dramatic of which were profound deafness caused by a collapse of the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear (Delpire et al, 1999; Flagella et al, 1999) and male infertility because of defective spermatogenesis (Pace et al, 2000). Both of these problems are thought to result from fluid secretory defects in the respective tissues.

The mechanisms illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 do not address the question of whether the water that follows salt secretion flows between the cells (via the tight junctions) or through the cell body (via the cytoplasm). In fact this issue has been a source of considerable interest and experimentation in both secretory and absorptive epithelia for many years (Spring, 1999). In salivary acini this question is made more complicated by the pyramidal shape of the acinar cells that results in a rather small area for both the luminal membrane and the tight junctional complex. Thus whichever route the water takes would necessarily require a relatively high water permeability. A major milestone in the resolution of these problems was the discovery and cloning of the aquaporins, a family of plasma membrane water channel proteins (Borgnia et al, 1999). It had been known for some time that the membranes of many cells had very high water permeabilities while those of others were relatively water impermeant (e.g. the luminal membranes of salivary ducts, see above) and still others could regulate their water permeability according to need (Borgnia et al, 1999). It is now clear that cell membranes have very low intrinsic water permeabilities and that the large water permeabilities observed in the membranes of many tissues are because of the presence of aquaporins. Surprisingly, early studies failed to demonstrate the presence of any aquaporins in salivary acinar cell membranes, however, it was subsequently found that a new aquaporin isoform, AQP5, was localized to the apical membranes of many secretory epithelia, including salivary acinar cells (Raina et al, 1995). More recent experiments have shown that stimulated salivary flows are reduced >60% in AQP5 knockout mice relative to normal controls (Ma et al, 1999). Thus it would appear

that most, but probably not all of the secreted water flows through the acinar cells.

Consistent with its central role in salivary fluid secretion, the activity of NKCC1 has been shown to be dramatically up-regulated by secretagogues. Evans and Turner (1997) have demonstrated a 20-fold increase in the NKCC1 transport activity of rat parotid acinar cells following the application of muscarinic and other Ca²⁺ mobilizing stimuli. This effect appears to be mediated by a metabolite of arachadonic acid (Evans and Turner, 1997) but the exact mechanism is still uncertain. This observation is consistent with the idea that NKCC1 activity is down-regulated while the cell is at rest to prevent futile cycling of the transporter, then up-regulated during stimulation when its activity is required. Interestingly, in the rat parotid NKCC1 is also activated, although to a lesser degree, by β-adrenergic stimulation (Paulais and Turner, 1992) which increases intracellular cAMP levels without affecting intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration. This is because of a phosphorylation of NKCC1 that involves, but does not appear to be directly caused by, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (Tanimura *et al.*, 1995; Kurihara *et al.*, 1999). At first glance, it seems odd that NKCC1 would be up-regulated by such a stimulus because, as discussed in detail below, increased intracellular cAMP concentration results in robust acinar protein secretion but typically produces little salivary fluid. However, there is good evidence that sympathetic (adrenergic) stimulation, arising for example from mastication, when superimposed on parasympathetic (muscarinic) stimulation has a synergistic effect on salivary flow (Johnson, 1987). This synergistic effect may arise from the cAMP-dependent up regulation of NKCC1. It is also interesting to speculate that the unexplained symptoms of dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes that accompany the use of many commonly prescribed medications (Sreebny and Schwartz, 1986) may be related to interference with the secretagogue-induced up regulation of NKCC1. Indeed, among these drugs are a number of β-blockers (Sreebny and Schwartz, 1986).

Finally, we should mention that, although the osmotic coupling hypothesis (that water follows salt secretion osmotically) underlying the models in Figures 1 and 2 is widely accepted among physiologists, there are some dissenting views (Whittembury and Hill, 2000). One of the central problems here is that it has not been possible, to date, to experimentally demonstrate the existence of the osmotic gradient between the interstitium and lumen that is required for the functioning of the models. In terms of the osmotic coupling model, the explanation for this problem is that, because of the high water permeability of the epithelium, only a very small gradient is required to account for the water fluxes observed (Spring, 1999). The problem for the dissenting views, a major one in our opinion, is to account for the large body of existing evidence consistent with the osmotic gradient hypothesis not only in salivary glands but also in numerous other secretory and absorptive epithelia.


Salivary protein secretion

Saliva contains a wide variety of secreted proteins, including: α-amylase, an enzyme involved in the digestion of starch; lysozyme, peroxidase, immunoglobulins (IgA) and many additional proteins that have antibacterial and/or antiviral properties; and mucins, which are multifunctional glycoproteins involved in mechanical protection and prevention of dehydration of the oral epithelia, as well as in lubrication for solid food and trapping of microorganisms (Young and Cook, 1996; Amerongen & Veerman in press). As already indicated, most of the proteins in saliva are secreted by the acinar cells.

Salivary proteins exhibit vectorial transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where they are synthesized, through a succession of membrane-bounded compartments including the Golgi complex, condensing vacuoles, and secretory granules (Von Zastrow and Castle, 1987). The secretory granules migrate to particular locations within the cell close to the apical membrane prior to the release of their contents into the acinar lumen.

Exocytosis is the process by which cells release the contents of their secretory granules. This involves the fusion of the granule membrane with the luminal plasma membrane of the secretory cell followed by the rupture of the fused membranes. This process is continuous in most cells ('constitutive' exocytosis), but it can be greatly accelerated following an appropriate cellular signal such as neural stimulation ('regulatory' exocytosis). In the three major salivary glands, parotid, submandibular and sublingual, exocytotic protein secretion is primarily controlled by the autonomic nervous system; sympathetic stimulation elicits protein release from parotid and submandibular gland acini, and parasympathetic stimulation elicits protein release from sublingual gland acini as well as some release from parotid acini (Quissell and Tabak, 1989; Spearman and Butcher, 1989). We will focus here on amylase secretion from rat parotid acinar cells as recent studies on this system are promoting a better understanding of the cellular events involved in salivary gland exocytosis.

cAMP-dependent amylase secretion

Salivary protein secretion, like fluid secretion, is evoked when neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors on the basolateral membrane of the secretory cells and generate intracellular second messengers that, in turn, activate the cellular mechanisms responsible for secretion. cAMP is the primary second messenger for amylase secretion from rat parotid acinar cells (Butcher and Putney, 1980). Noradrenaline, released from sympathetic nerves, binds to and activates β-adrenergic receptors leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels. cAMP is thought to mediate most of its effects through the activation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, also known as PKA. In parotid acinar cells, PKA activation is essential for cAMP-dependent exocytotic secretion (Quissell, 1993; Takuma and Ichida, 1994). However, the target proteins phosphorylated by PKA have not yet been identified.

In contrast to rat parotid acini, in many other secretory cells Ca²⁺ has been found to be the primary intracellular second messenger for exocytosis. But it has been shown that cAMP mediates parotid amylase secretion without the elevation of cytosolic Ca²⁺ (Takuma and Ichida 1986). In addition, in permeabilized acinar cells significantly enhanced amylase release was observed at all concentrations of free Ca²⁺ tested (Baldys-Waglegorska et al., 1987).

### Ca²⁺-dependent amylase secretion

Stimulation of muscarinic, substance P peptidergic or α-adrenergic receptors also elicits significant amylase release from the rat parotid, albeit at levels that are significantly lower than those observed from a β-adrenergic receptor-mediated response. These receptors are activated by acetylcholine and substance P released from parasympathetic nerves, and by noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerves, respectively. The stimulation of these receptors activates phosphatidylinositol metabolism and induces an increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration without affecting intracellular cAMP levels (Butcher and Putney, 1980; Sugiya and Furuyama, 1989).

### Docking/priming and fusion

Yoshimura et al (Yoshimura and Nezu, 1992; Yoshimura, Hiramatsu and Murakami, 1998, Yoshimura, Murakami and Segawa, 2000) have developed a perfusion system for isolated rat parotid acinar cells that allows one to obtain a detailed time course for amylase release. They have demonstrated that the activation of the cAMP signaling pathway by β-adrenergic agonists results in a gradual increase in the rate of amylase secretion. On the other hand, the activation of Ca²⁺ mobilizing receptors evokes biphasic changes in amylase release consisting of an initial large but transient peak followed by a lower sustained plateau. In the absence of extracellular Ca²⁺, only the initial transient peak is seen. These time courses of amylase release parallel the agonist-induced responses in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, indicating that Ca²⁺ can play a significant role in the regulation of amylase secretion. Furthermore, the combined stimulation of both cAMP and Ca²⁺ mobilizing pathways results in responses that are larger than the sum of the responses induced by each stimulus alone. More detailed analyses discussed below suggest that this synergistic effect is caused by a cAMP-induced enhancement of the potency and efficacy of the process regulated by Ca²⁺.

It has been shown that the regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitters can be divided into three steps: (1) docking of vesicles to the plasma membrane (2) a 'priming' event accompanied by ATP hydrolysis, and (3) fusion/secretion triggered by the elevation of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations (Südhof, 1995). Yoshimura et al., (1998) hypothesized that Ca²⁺ triggers the final fusion process for parotid amylase release and that cAMP stimulates the formation of docked/primed secretory granules thus enhancing in the effect of Ca²⁺ as the trigger for fusion (Figure 3). Fujita-Yoshigaki

**Figure 3** A model for the mechanism of cAMP- and Ca²⁺ dependent amylase secretion in rat parotid acinar cells. cAMP stimulates the formation of docked/primed secretory granules and enhances the effect of Ca²⁺ as the trigger for fusion/secretion (see text for details)

(2000) confirmed that the experimental data on amylase release from the rat parotid could be accounted for by such a model. More specifically she modeled amylase release as two first order reactions, the first representing docking priming (cAMP-dependent) and the second fusion (Ca²⁺ dependent) of secretory granules. Analysis of the experimental data of Yoshimura et al (1998) with this model indicated that the number of docked primed granules is quite small in unstimulated cells. Thus considerable amylase release could be elicited by a cAMP-generating stimulus even at resting intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, accounting for the observation that amylase release appears to be mainly cAMP-dependent. It is also worth emphasizing that in vivo β-adrenergic stimulation (cAMP-generating) is due to noradrenaline which also results in the stimulation of α-adrenergic (Ca²⁺ mobilizing) receptors, so that acinar cells always experience a rise in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration along with that of cAMP.

#### Involvement of SNARE proteins in amylase secretion

In neuronal cells, Söllner et al (1993a, b) proposed the ‘SNARE hypothesis’, namely that synaptic vesicles dock to a target membrane through the interaction of vesicle and target membrane proteins referred to as SNAP receptors (SNAREs). VAMP2 is a vesicle-associated SNARE (v-SNARE), and syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 are target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs). Fujita-Yoshigaki et al (1996) identified an 18-kDa protein localized to the secretory granule membrane of rat parotid acinar cells as VAMP-2 by showing that it reacted with an antibody against VAMP2 and was cleaved by botulinum neurotoxin B, a metalloprotease specific for VAMP2. In rat parotid acinar cells permeabilized with streptolysin O, these authors also showed that botulinum neurotoxin B inhibited cAMP-induced amylase release, but not Ca²⁺ induced release, suggesting that VAMP-2 is involved in cAMP-mediated amylase exocytosis as a v-SNARE (Fujita-Yoshigaki et al, 1996). In parotid acinar cells, t-SNAREs such as syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25, which are found in neuronal cells, were not detected. In non-neuronal cells, syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23 are plausible candidates for t-SNAREs. Both of these proteins were detected in rat parotid acinar cells, but they were not coimmunoprecipitated with VAMP2, suggesting that their interactions with VAMP2 may be weak (Takuma, Arakawa and Tajima, 2000).

Fujita-Yoshigaki *et al* (1999) studied the immunoprecipitation of VAMP-2 using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to Arg<sup>47</sup>-Asp<sup>64</sup> of VAMP-2. This region of VAMP-2 overlaps the domain involved in the binding of t-SNAREs. This antibody was able to immunoprecipitate VAMP-2 from solubilized rat parotid secretory granule membranes prepared from unstimulated cells incubated in the presence of cAMP and acinar cytosol, but not in their absence, and this immunoprecipitation was prevented by H89, an inhibitor of PKA. These observations suggest that the site on VAMP-2 to which the antibody was raised is masked in resting cells and that PKA is able to dissociate this complex via the phosphorylation of some cytosolic protein(s) (Figure 4). Two 35 and 80 kDa proteins found to be coimmunoprecipitated with VAMP2 (Takuma *et al*, 2000) are potential candidates for these proteins, but additional studies are required to establish this as well as their identities.

**Involvement of small GTP-binding proteins in amylase secretion**

Two groups of GTP-binding proteins are known to be involved in signal transduction events, the 'heterotrimeric' GTP-binding proteins, which have well documented roles in receptor coupling interactions, and the 'monomeric' or 'small' GTP-binding proteins, which we discuss here. The small GTP-binding proteins have molecular masses in the range 18–30 kDa. In contrast to the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, they consist of a single subunit and have specific GTPase-activating proteins that enhance their intrinsic GTPase activity. The small GTP-binding proteins are classified into five groups, Ras, Rab, Arf, Rho and Ran. These species are involved in cell differentiation, secretion, membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, organization of microfilaments, and protein transport into the nucleus, respectively. Recently, it has been suggested that small GTP-binding proteins are involved in exocytotic processes in secretory cells, including parotid acinar cells (Watson, 1999).

Rap proteins are members of the Ras subfamily. Rap proteins are divided into two subgroups, Rap1 and Rap2. Rap1 has been identified in the secretory granule membrane, plasma membrane and cytosol of rat parotid acinar cells (Kameyama *et al*, 1994; D'Silva *et al*, 1997) and has been observed to translocate to the cytosol following β-adrenergic receptor activation (D'Silva *et al*, 1998).

Approximately 40 Rab proteins have been shown to be involved in the targeting and fusion of transport vesicles with acceptor membranes in various tissues and species (Martinez and Goud, 1998). Four Rab3 isoforms have been cloned. Rab3D has been identified in the secretory granule membrane, plasma membrane and cytosol of rat parotid acinar cells and, like Rap1, β-adrenergic receptor activation has been shown to induce the redistribution of Rab3D from the cytosol to the membrane fractions (Raffainiello *et al*, 1999). Rab26, another Rab protein, has been shown to be localized to secretory granules in rat parotid acinar cells and immunostaining of Rab26 disappeared from acinar cells following β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (Yoshie *et al*, 2000).

Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor, was originally characterized as a cofactor for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Now, six isoforms of Arf have been identified and recognized as multifunctional factors involved in a number of biological events such as membrane trafficking, exocytosis and endocytosis (Boman and Kahn, 1995). Dohke *et al* (1998) have investigated a possible involvement of Arf in exocytosis from rat parotid acinar cells. They have demonstrated that Arfl is mainly detected in the cytosolic fraction of these cells and is translocated to the secretory granule membrane in a GTP-dependent manner. Furthermore, a peptide from the N terminus of Arfl inhibited cAMP-induced amylase secretion when it was added to permeabilized rat parotid cells (Dohke *et al*, 2000).

The above observations strongly suggest the involvement of small GTP-binding proteins in the regulated exocytosis of amylase from rat parotid acinar cells. Possible roles for these proteins based on observations from other tissues are indicated below:

(i) Rab proteins cycle between a cytosolic GDP-bound state and a vesicular GTP-bound state with the aid of many accessory proteins. Repeated cycling between vesicle membranes and cytosol can be generated through GDP/GTP exchange. In neuronal cells, Rab3A proteins are thought to be

**Figure 4** A possible model for the mechanism of interaction between VAMP2 and t-SNAREs by the activation of the cAMP-dependent signaling system. VAMP2 may be masked by an as yet unidentified protein (X) under unstimulated conditions. Protein X is removed from VAMP2 as a result of the phosphorylation of a cytosolic protein (Y) by cAMP-dependent PKA. Removal of X from VAMP2 then allows it to interact with t-SNAREs.

regulators of SNARE complex assembly (Lin and Scheller, 2000).

(ii) Cytoskeletal reorganization is an important step in exocytosis. Segawa *et al* (1998) have proposed a role for the cytoskeleton in exocytosis in salivary glands. In human platelets, the association of Rap1 protein with cytoskeleton has been suggested to be involved in exocytosis via cytoskeletal reorganization (Fisher *et al*, 1990).

(iii) Membrane fusion may be modulated by the alteration of membrane lipid composition. Phosphatidic acid may be a fusogenic lipid. In chromaffin cells, Arf6 associated with secretory granules translocates to the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation, resulting in the activation of phospholipase D (Caumont *et al*, 1998) and its production of phosphatidic acid. Consequently, fusogenic lipids generated at exocytic sites appear to be involved in exocytosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is also thought to be a regulator of exocytosis. In mast cells, Arfl has been shown to contribute to the activation of exocytosis following the cross-linking IgE receptors by regulating the level of PIP₂ via an as yet incompletely understood mechanism (Way, O’luanaigh and Cockcroft, 2000).

Small GTP-binding proteins could have similar, in addition to as yet unidentified, roles to those mentioned above in protein secretion from salivary acinar cells. The precise roles of proteins such as SNAREs and small GTP-binding proteins in exocytosis from salivary gland cells remain to be determined. A number of new and exciting techniques are currently available to answer these questions; examples include, site-specific and other antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides which bind to cytosolic mRNA sense strands and block the synthesis of specific proteins, transient and stable expression systems for wild-type and mutant forms of specific proteins, and specific protein-deficient mice. Such strategies should help us to understand the functions of various candidate proteins in salivary protein exocytosis and as a consequence help us to elucidate their potential involvement in mechanisms of oral diseases.
