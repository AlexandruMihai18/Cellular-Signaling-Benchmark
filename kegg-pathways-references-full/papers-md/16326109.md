1. Introduction
that coxibs increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events limits their use as chemopreventive agents. Nevertheless, aspirin remains a drug of great interest as it is already known to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by up to 50%. The balance of evidence shows that high vegetable fibre diets can prevent colorectal cancer, probably via the fermentation of butyrate enhancing the apoptotic response to DNA damage.


There are a number of biological and clinical differences between colorectal cancer from the left and right colon [13]. While there is little doubt that left sided colorectal cancers develop from adenomas, it has been suggested that right sided cancers may develop de novo from depressed type lesions [14]. Also, there are significant differences in gene expression between right and left sided lesions [15]. Right sided cancers also have a better
the Cyp1A promoter [21,29]. Activation of the promoter by injecting the mice with β-naphthoflavone causes ablation of *apc* in intestinal epithelial cells. The effect of knock-out of *apc* on the structure of the intestinal epithelium in the adult mouse is spectacular. Migration of epithelial cells along the crypt/villus axis is disturbed, positional cues
about the role of the RAS–RAF–MAPK pathway in the regulation of cell number on the crypt/villus axis. Nevertheless, suppression of RAS by kinase suppressor of RAS-1 (KSR1) has an antiapoptotic effect [64]. Disruption of KSR1 increases apoptosis in TNF-treated intestinal epithelial cells [65] which may have an influence on cancer
induction of p53 by MYC, E2F and E1A is mediated by $p14^{ARF}$ [79,80] and elimination of $p14^{ARF}$ increases the promotion of carcinogenesis by Myc by eliminating the apoptotic response [81]. By contrast, induction of p53 by DNA damage is not mediated by $p14^{

lead to apoptosis resistance. Studies in *msh2* deficient mice have shown intestinal epithelial cells to be resistant to apoptosis induced by methylating agents such as temozolomide [107]. Genome wide DNA damage can signal apoptosis via hMSH2, hMSH6 and hMLH1 by pathways mediated by cABL, P73 and P53 [107–10
