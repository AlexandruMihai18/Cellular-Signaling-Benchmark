Gastric secretion
Mitchell L. Schubert

Purpose of review
The purpose of this chapter is to summarize and place into perspective the past year's literature regarding the regulation of gastric exocrine and endocrine secretion.

Recent findings
To prevent acid and pepsin from overwhelming mucosal defense mechanisms and causing injury, the secretion of gastric acid is precisely regulated by a variety of central (eg, neuropeptide Y, corticotropin-releasing factor, and neuromedin U) and peripheral (eg, gastrin, histamine, acetylcholine, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, calcitonin gene–related peptide, leptin, and parietal cell) pathways. These pathways regulate the acid-producing parietal cell directly and/or indirectly by regulating the secretion of histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells, gastrin from G cells, and somatostatin from D cells. Recently, genetically engineered mouse models have been used to reevaluate the neural, hormonal, and paracrine pathways that physiologically regulate acid secretion.

Summary
An improved understanding of the pathways and mechanisms regulating gastric acid secretion should lead to the development of novel therapies to prevent and treat acid-peptic disorders as well as circumvent the adverse effects of currently used antisecretory medications such as the acid rebound observed after discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors.

Introduction
One of the main functions of the stomach is production of acid. Gastric acid facilitates the digestion of proteins and the absorption of iron, calcium, and vitamin B₁₂, and it prevents bacterial overgrowth and enteric infection. However, when levels of acid and pepsin overwhelm mucosal defense mechanisms, ulcers occur. To prevent such damage, gastric acid secretion must be precisely regulated. This regulation involves afferent and efferent pathways of the central and enteric nervous systems as well as neuroendocrine and immune cells acting via autocrine, paracrine, and hormonal pathways. The regulatory pathways converge on four cells crucial for acid secretion: (1) the parietal cell of the oxyntic mucosa (corpus and fundus of the stomach), which produces hydrochloric acid; (2) the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell of the oxyntic mucosa, which produces histamine, the main paracrine stimulant of acid secretion; (3) the G cell of the pyloric mucosa (antrum), which produces gastrin, the main hormonal stimulant of acid secretion; and (4) the D cells of oxyntic and pyloric mucosa, which produce somatostatin, the main paracrine inhibitor of acid secretion. During the interdigestive phase, acid secretion is maintained at an economically low level by the tonic inhibitory restraint exerted by antral somatostatin on gastrin cells and oxyntic somatostatin on ECL and parietal cells. It is estimated that the human stomach contains 20 × 10⁶ G cells, 9 × 10⁹ ECL cells, 1 × 10⁹ parietal cells, 1 × 10⁷ antral D cells, and 3 × 10⁸ oxyntic D cells [1]. In rat, ECL cells constitute 66% of the oxyntic endocrine population, whereas they constitute only 30% in humans.

Parietal cells are derived from precursor cells in the isthmus of the oxyntic glands and have a turnover time of 54 days in mouse and 164 days in rat. In the unstimulated state, parietal cells contain abundant intracellular tubulovesicles that sequester H⁺K⁺-adenosine triphosphatase (H⁺K⁺-ATPase), the proton pump. On stimulation, the tubulovesicles fuse with the apical membrane, and the H⁺K⁺-ATPase becomes active, enabling acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors, the most frequently used anti-

secretory drugs for the treatment of acid-peptic disorders, exert their effect by binding to and inactivating H⁺K⁺-ATPase, but only those pumps that have been inserted into the apical membrane.

Parietal cell numbers are drastically reduced in the ulcer margin of acetic acid–produced ulcers in rats [2•]. Interestingly, this reduction is prevented by indomethacin, an effect that might contribute to the delay in ulcer healing observed in patients taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

Our current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling gastric acid secretion have been derived principally from various *in vivo* and *in vitro* animal models, including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans, in which specific agonists and selective antagonists have been used to identify the pathways active tonically and activated in response to physiologic stimuli. More recently, genetically engineered mouse models, such as transgenic and knockout mice, have been used to reevaluate and advance our understanding of the regulation of gastric acid secretion.

### Central mechanisms

The cephalic phase of acid secretion is induced by sensory inputs driven by the thought, sight, smell, taste, and swallowing of food. It contributes approximately 50% to the overall acid response to a meal. The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the medulla and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the hypothalamus play key roles in the integration of afferent and efferent information. The PVN is connected anatomically and functionally with the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Neuropeptide Y and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons are present in the ARC and PVN. In rat, microinjection of the neuropeptide Y receptor subtype Y1 antagonist, BIBP-3226, or the CRF1/2 antagonist, atressin, into the PVN abolishes the inhibition of acid secretion induced by activation of ARC neurons by the excitatory amino acid kainate, implying that neuropeptide Y and CRF neurons inhibit gastric acid secretion [3]. It is hypothesized that neuropeptide Y, released from neurons projecting from the ARC to the PVN, activates CRF neurons in this brain area.

Neuromedin U is also present in the ARC and, when administered intracerebroventricularly, inhibits gastric acid secretion in conscious rats [4]. The effect is mediated by CRF, given that CRF antibodies can block it. CRF, in turn, activates sympathetic noradrenergic neurons.

Capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot pepper, binds to the vanilloid receptor, VR1. VRI immunoreactivity has been localized to vagal afferent terminals as well as to the dorsal vagal complex, specifically the nucleus tractus solitarius and area postrema [5]. Intracerebroventricular injection of capsaicin stimulates gastric acid secretion in rats. The response involves VR1 receptors and release of tachykinins and calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) because it can be blocked by intracerebroventricular injection of a VR1 antagonist (capsazepine), tachykinin NK-2 antagonist (L-659877), or CGRP antagonist (CGRP8-27) [6]. The findings suggest that vagal afferent fibers may be involved in the transmission of painful stimuli, and perhaps also physiologic stimuli, from the stomach to the central nervous system [7,8]. The central nervous system interprets these signals and transmits efferent information back down the vagus nerve.

### Peripheral mechanisms

Peripheral mechanisms include stimulants and inhibitors.

#### Stimulants

Stimulants include gastrin, histamine, acetylcholine, and ghrelin.

##### Gastrin

Gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) possess identical carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide sequences (-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH₂). Two main classes of gastrin/CCK receptors have been characterized: CCK-1 (formerly CCK-A) and CCK-2 (formerly CCK-B or CCK-B/gastrin). Both receptors belong to the family of seven transmembrane receptors that are coupled to their intracellular effectors via G proteins. Mutational analysis of the CCK-2 receptor suggests that it is coupled to two different G proteins: one involved in phospholipase C generation of the signaling molecule inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate and the other phospholipase A2 generation of arachidonic acid [9]. CCK-1 receptors are specific for CCK, whereas CCK-2 receptors recognize both CCK and gastrin (Fig. 1).

Gastrin is the principal mediator of meal-stimulated acid secretion and is critical to mucosal growth of the stomach, notably the growth of parietal and ECL cells. Gastrin stimulates acid secretion directly via CCK-2 receptors on parietal cells and, more importantly, indirectly via CCK-2 receptors on ECL cells (Fig. 1). Histamine, released from ECL cells, then stimulates acid by activating histamine H-2 receptors on neighboring parietal cells. A feedback pathway involving acid-induced somatostatin secretion serves to attenuate acid secretion during the interdigestive period. That is, luminal acid stimulates antral somatostatin secretion, which, in turn, inhibits gastrin secretion. When acid secretion is diminished, by either antisecretory drugs or atrophic gastritis, somatostatin secretion is inhibited, and thus gastrin secretion is stimulated, resulting in hypergastrinemia.

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

During the interdigestive phase, acid secretion is maintained at an economically low level by the tonic paracrine restraint exerted by antral somatostatin (SST)-containing D cells on gastrin secretion from G cells and oxyntic SST-containing D cells on histamine secretion from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells and acid secretion from parietal cells. Gastrin, the main hormonal stimulant of acid secretion, stimulates the parietal cell directly via CCK-2 receptors and, more importantly, indirectly by binding to CCK-2 receptors on ECL cells coupled to histamine release. CCK, released from duodenal I cells in response to dietary nutrients, interacts with both CCK-1 receptors on antral and oxyntic D cells to release somatostatin and the aforementioned CCK-2 receptors on ECL and parietal cells. The effect of CCK-1 receptor activation predominates and, thus, the net effect of CCK, physiologically, is inhibition of acid secretion.

and ECL cells. The findings suggest that gastrin, acting via the CCK-2 receptor, is essential for the functional maturation of the acid secretory system and the differentiation of gastric mucosal cells, including parietal and ECL cells. Consistent with this concept, a CCK-2 receptor antagonist prevents the gastric mucosal proliferation, including ECL cells, observed during hypergastrinemia induced by omeprazole [15].

Insulin-gastrin transgenic mice that overexpress amidated gastrin in pancreatic islets initially demonstrate increased numbers of parietal and ECL cells and increased acid secretion. Unexpectedly, the mice later progress to hypochlorhydria with reduced numbers of parietal and ECL cells [11•,13••].

Human progastrin is an 80-residue polypeptide that is cleaved by prohormone convertases and then C-terminally trimmed by carboxypeptidase E. Subsequent α-amidation by the amidation enzyme complex, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase, generates the acid stimulatory gastrins, gastrin-17 and gastrin-34. In rat antrum, approximately 25% of gastrin content, previously ascribed to “minigastrin,” has now been identified as gastrin-16 [16]. Gastrin-16 is capable of binding to a CCK-2 receptor stably transfected in a CHO cell line and presumably is capable of stimulating acid secretion.

The mechanism by which progastrin is sorted to the regulated secretory pathway is not completely understood, but Bundgaard et al. [17], using N- and C-terminal truncations and amino acid substitutions, have implicated sorting domains localized in the C-terminal region of the prohormone.

Discontinuation of an 8-week course of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole is associated with rebound increased secretion of gastric acid in *Helicobacter pylori*-negative, but not *H. pylori*-positive, individuals and lasts at least 2 months [10••]. The median submaximal and maximal acid outputs 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of omeprazole were 50% higher than before omeprazole was begun. The findings are consistent with the trophic effects of omeprazole-induced hypergastrinemia on ECL and parietal cells. The half-life of the parietal cell is 54 days in mouse, 164 days in rat, and possibly longer than 1 year in humans. Acid rebound after the discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors may also be relevant to reports indicating that eradicating *H. pylori* increases the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease because many of the participants in those trials had been taking proton pump inhibitors.

Gastrin and CCK-2 receptor knockout mice have similar phenotypes, characterized by achlorhydria and failure to respond appropriately to exogenously administered histamine, carbachol, and gastrin [11•,12,13••,14•]. The animals have a reduced number of functional parietal

Histamine

In the stomach, histamine is stored mainly in ECL cells that reside in the lower third of the oxyntic gland [18•]. Histamine, synthesized by enzymatic decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine by histidine decarboxylase, is stored in secretory vesicles and is released upon stimulation by gastrin, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), vasoactive intestinal peptide, and pituitary adenyl cyclase–activating peptide [19,20]. Histamine diffuses to neighboring parietal cells and stimulates acid secretion by binding to H-2 receptors expressed on their surface.

Gastrin binds to CCK-2 receptors on ECL cells and elicits an increase in intracellular calcium, a portion of which results from influx of extracellular calcium through voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels. The increase in calcium promotes exocytosis and histamine release. TGF-α, a growth factor that is increased locally during gastric ulcer healing, binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor on ECL cells [21]. Pituitary adenyl cyclase–activating peptide, a member of the vasoactive intestinal peptide family of peptides, is present in gastric

mucosal neurons and binds to the PAC1 receptor on ECL cells. Gastrin, TGF-α, and pituitary adenyl cyclase–activating peptide also stimulate transcription and activity of histidine decarboxylase [21, 22]. Galanin, somatostatin, and prostaglandin E₂ inhibit histamine secretion, whereas acetylcholine has no direct effect.

Proton pump inhibitors induce hypergastrinemia by eliminating the acid feedback inhibition of gastrin secretion. Hypergastrinemia causes ECL hyperplasia, dysplasia, and neoplasia in rats; similar events may occur in humans [23]. Proton pump inhibitors, additionally, directly stimulate histamine release from isolated ECL cells, but unlike gastrin, this is not mediated via increased intracellular calcium levels or histamine synthesis [24]. It is suggested that proton pump inhibitors promote the transport of histamine from cytoplasm into vesicles by interaction with a V-type ATPase, vesicular monoamine transporter 2.

Two different histamine pathway mouse mutants have been generated: an H-2 receptor-deficient and a histamine decarboxylase-deficient strain. Histamine H-2 receptor knockout mice show mildly elevated gastric pH, hypergastrinemia, and hyperplasia of parietal and ECL cells [25]. As mentioned above, hypergastrinemia is a characteristic response to low acid secretion. However, in this case, the marked fourfold elevation in gastrin is disproportionate to the mild decrease in basal acid secretion, suggesting that other factors in the H-2 receptor knockout mice, unrelated to decreased acid secretion, can also induce hypergastrinemia [11•]. The morphology is similar to that observed in mice treated for 3 months with proton pump inhibitors, except that hyperplasia of surface mucus cells develops in the latter. As predicted, acid secretion in the H-2 knockout mice could be induced by carbachol but not histamine or gastrin. The findings are consistent with the concept that gastrin stimulates acid secretion primarily by releasing histamine from ECL cells, whereas carbachol acts directly on the parietal cell and/or indirectly by inhibiting somatostatin secretion. This concept is strengthened by the finding that gastrin is unable to stimulate acid secretion in histamine decarboxylase knockout mice [26, 27].

The stomachs of histamine H-2 receptor knockout mice are reported to resemble those of patients with Menetrier disease. That is, they manifest enlarged gastric folds with cystic dilatation, hypergastrinemia, hypoalbuminemia, increased mucus secretion, and overexpression of TGF-α [28].

Acetylcholine

Acetylcholine, released from postganglionic neurons of the enteric nervous system, stimulates acid secretion by activating M-3 receptors on parietal cells. M-3 knockout mice show lower acid output, lower proportion of active parietal cells, and higher serum gastrin levels than wild-type mice [29•]. Unexpectedly, acid secretion in response to histamine and gastrin is also impaired, and, despite hypergastrinemia, there is no trophic response in the oxyntic mucosa with respect to mucosal thickness, proliferation rate, or numbers of parietal and ECL cells.

Ghrelin

The greatest expression of ghrelin is in the stomach, in endocrine A-like cells in the oxyntic mucosa. In humans, ghrelin infusion increases appetite, food intake, and acid secretion. Ghrelin is released when the upper gastrointestinal tract is empty of calories and is inhibited by intragastric caloric load (protein, carbohydrate, or fat), CCK, somatostatin, and *H. pylori* infection [30–35]. Intravenous fat and dextrose also reduce ghrelin secretion [33].

Inhibitors

Inhibitors include somatostatin, CCK, CGRP and adrenomedullin, secretin, proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), and leptin.

Somatostatin

Somatostatin, which is present in gastric oxyntic and pyloric D cells, inhibits acid secretion by acting directly on parietal cells and indirectly by inhibiting histamine secretion from ECL cells and gastrin secretion from G cells (Fig. 1). The actions of somatostatin are mediated via five G protein–coupled receptor subtypes, termed SSTR1 to SSTR5. Pharmacologic and molecular studies, including studies on SSTR2 knockout mice, suggest that the SSTR2 receptor is the predominant receptor regulating acid secretion. Although acid secretion in SSTR2 knockout mice was tenfold higher than in wild-type mice, unexpectedly, there were no changes in circulating gastrin levels, suggesting that somatostatin inhibition of gastrin secretion may not occur via the SSTR2 receptor [13••]. In support of this concept, SSTR2 receptors were recently identified on parietal and ECL cells but not on gastrin cells [36].

In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric infection with *H. pylori* is associated with a decrease in somatostatin and increase in gastrin secretion. *H. pylori*–induced gastritis exhibits a T helper 1 lymphocyte response characterized by increased interferon-γ expressing T lymphocytes and low levels of T helper 2 lymphocytes expressing interleukin-4 (IL-4). In mice, interferon-γ decreased somatostatin and increased gastrin secretion, whereas IL-4 increased somatostatin and decreased gastrin secretion [37•]. Somatostatin-containing D cells possess IL-4 receptors, IL-4 stimulates somatostatin secretion from primary D cell cultures, and pretreatment with IL-4 prevents gastritis in *H. pylori*–infected wild-type mice but not in somatostatin knockout mice. The results suggest
that IL-4 may resolve gastric inflammation by stimulating somatostatin secretion.

Cholecystokinin

Within the gastrointestinal tract, CCK is found within enteric nerves and within endocrine cells, classified as I cells, in the duodenal and jejunal mucosa (Fig. 1). Basal plasma CCK concentrations are approximately 1 pM and rise to 5 to 8 pM after food ingestion. Dietary fat and protein, and less so carbohydrate, stimulate CCK release [38]. Although it is taught that CCK-8 is the major endocrine form of CCK, a recent study suggests that CCK-58 is the predominant form in rat and dog, and possibly human [39].

Cholecystokinin and gastrin are equally effective in stimulating ECL cells to secrete histamine via CCK-2 receptors, an effect that should promote acid secretion. However, CCK also activates CCK-1 receptors on D cells that are coupled to somatostatin secretion, an effect that should inhibit acid secretion. As discussed above, somatostatin inhibits ECL, gastrin, and parietal cells. The net effect of intravenous CCK is little or no change in acid secretion.

Unexpectedly, the reduced acid secretion observed in gastrin knockout mice is restored in gastrin-CCK double knockout mice, indicating that CCK plays a physiologic role as an inhibitor of acid secretion via the CCK-somatostatin pathway (Fig. 1) [12,14•]. This notion is supported by observations in CCK-1 receptor-deficient Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty rats, a strain with a spontaneous inactivation of the CCK-1 receptor gene. These rats have increased basal, gastrin-stimulated, and CCK-stimulated acid secretion.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide/adrenomedullin

Calcitonin gene–related peptide and adrenomedullin belong to the same family of related peptides and show cross-reactivity at each other’s receptors. Both peptides require the same 7 transmembrane protein, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR). By itself, CRLR is inactive; however, when it associates with a single transmembrane protein, receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP) 1, it functions as a CGRP receptor, and when it associates with RAMP 2 or RAMP 3, an adrenomedullin receptor results [40]. There is some evidence for the existence of a second CGRP receptor that does not involve CRLR [41].

BIBN4096BS is a selective nonpeptide antagonist at CRLR/RAMP 1 receptors, whereas adrenomedullin 22-52 selectively antagonizes CRLR/RAMP 2 and CRLR/RAMP 3 [42]. Human CGRP 8-37 is an antagonist at CRLR/RAMP 1 and CRLR/RAMP 3 [42].

In stomach, CGRP is present in extrinsic sensory neurons and adrenomedullin in ECL cells. Both CGRP and adrenomedullin stimulate gastric somatostatin secretion and thus inhibit histamine and acid secretion [43].

Secretin

Secretin-producing cells not only are found in the upper small intestine but have recently been identified in rat antral and oxyntic mucosa by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Southern blot analysis [44]. The secretin-containing cells are of the “closed” variety and appear to be distinct from G or D cells. It is postulated that gastric secretin may act in a paracrine manner, via release of somatostatin, to inhibit acid secretion.

Proteinase-activated receptors

Proteinase-activated receptors represent a unique class of G protein-coupled receptors in which receptor activation involves the proteolytic unmasking of a an N-terminal sequence buried in the “proreceptor,” which then acts as a “tethered” or anchored receptor-stimulating ligand. Four subtypes of PARs have been cloned, termed PAR-1 to PAR-4.

Messenger RNAs for PAR-1 and PAR-2 are detectable in the stomach. In pylorus-ligated rats, intravenous administration of the PAR-2–activating peptide, SLIGRL-NH₂, inhibits carbachol-, pentagastrin-, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose-stimulated acid secretion [45]. This effect appears to be independent of prostanoids or sensory neurons [46].

PAR-2 expression has been detected in chief cells, and PAR-2 activating peptide, as well as PAR-1 activating peptide, stimulates pepsinogen secretion in rats [46,47].

Leptin

Although adipose tissue is the main source of leptin, leptin is also present in chief cells of rat and human stomach. Gastric leptin is secreted in response to feeding as well as insulin, secretin, gastrin and CCK [48]. In isolated canine chief cells, CCK, acting via the CCK-1 receptor, stimulates leptin synthesis and secretion [49]. In a rat ischemia-reperfusion model, leptin stimulates histamine secretion [50]. In vivo, leptin inhibits basal acid secretion in rat and peptone-stimulated acid secretion in humans [51,52].

Intracellular mechanisms

Intracellular mechanisms include Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger, Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger, and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) 6.

Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger

Gastric acid secretion occurs when H⁺K⁺-ATPase, the proton pump, activates by trafficking to the apical surface of the parietal cell and begins to secrete protons into
the secretory canaliculi. During active acid secretion, the H⁺ activity in the canaliculi approaches 150 mEq/L. Recently, sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 has been localized to the apical membrane of the parietal cell by Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and functional studies [53••]. This sodium-dependent proton extrusion pathway is active in resting glands and is inhibited by histamine-induced H⁺K⁺-ATPase proton extrusion. Sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 3, which is active in resting conditions and in omeprazole-pretreated gastric glands, may provide a pathway for antisecretory drug resistance and/or acid breakthrough.

### Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger

Extrusion of acid across the parietal cell apical membrane results in the generation of intracellular hydroxyl ions (OH⁻), which are converted to HCO₃⁻ by intracellular carbonic anhydrase and then transported across the basolateral membrane via a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger. This exchanger prevents intracellular alkalinization and also provides intracellular Cl⁻ for maintaining HCl secretion during acid stimulation. Blockade of this exchanger inhibits acid secretion in rabbit parietal cells. Based on localization of the anion exchanger 2 on the basolateral membrane of parietal cells, it has been presumed that anion exchanger 2 is the major basolateral Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger in parietal cells. Recent studies suggest that another exchanger, SLC26A7, a member of the family of anion exchangers referred to as the SLC26A family, also functions as a basolateral Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger in parietal cells [54].

### ADP-ribosylation factor 6

The ARF family of proteins is monomeric GTPases that regulate endocytosis, exocytosis, and membrane recycling in various secretory cells. ARF6 is present in parietal cells and is translocated from the cytosol to the intracellular canaliculi when the cell is stimulated. In cultured gastric glands infected with an adenovirus expressing ARF6Q67L, a mutant lacking GTP hydrolysis activity, gastric acid secretion is inhibited. The findings suggest that ARF6 plays a role in vesicular fusion, a process essential for acid secretion [55].

### Conclusion

Our understanding of gastric acid secretion has come a long way since Prout’s discovery of hydrochloric acid in 1823. Gastric acid secretion is finely regulated by interdependent pathways that include the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and an intricate network of neuroendocrine and immune cells acting in paracrine and hormonal fashions. Genes for many of the key regulators of gastric acid secretion have been identified and cloned. As a result, genetically engineered animal models, such as knockout mice, have been developed that allow further insight into the mechanisms and pathways regulating acid secretion. Although most patients with acid-peptic disorders are effectively treated with H-2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, these medications are not ideal and are associated with side effects such as hypergastrinemia. It is hoped that a better understanding of the neural, hormonal, and paracrine pathways as well as the receptors and transduction pathways that regulate acid secretion will lead to improved therapies for acid disorders.
