### ABSTRACT

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health burden and the main risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. However, HBV is not directly cytopathic and liver injury appears to be mostly caused by repeated attempts of the host's immune responses to control the infection. Recent studies have shown that the unique replication strategy adopted by HBV enables it to survive within the infected hepatocyte while complex virus-host interplays ensure the virus is able to fulfil its replication requirements yet is still able to evade important host antiviral innate immune responses. Clearer understanding of the host and viral mechanisms affecting HBV replication and persistence is necessary to design more effective therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the management of patients with chronic HBV infection to eventually achieve viral eradication. This article focuses on summarising the current knowledge of factors influencing the course of HBV infection, giving emphasis on the use of novel assays and quantitative serological and intrahepatic biomarkers as tools for predicting treatment response and disease progression.

### HBV VIROLOGY

HBV is a member of the *Hepadnaviridae* family, which are the smallest DNA-containing, enveloped animal viruses known so far. Characteristic of HBV is its high tissue and species specificity, and a unique genomic organisation and replication mechanism. Despite decades of research, essential steps of the viral lifecycle, such as viral entry and organisation of the cccDNA minichromosome, are still poorly understood. Only recently, innovative infection models and molecular techniques have opened new possibilities to investigate specific steps of the lifecycle and virus-host interactions influencing viral activity in infected hepatocytes.

Infectious HBV has a spherical structure of 42–44 nm and the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) envelops the viral nucleocapsid, which is formed by the core protein (HBcAg). The encapsidated viral genome is typically organised as a relaxed circular partially double-stranded DNA (rcDNA) of around 3200 bp, covalently linked to the terminal protein of the viral polymerase (figure 1). The HBV genome displays four overlapping open reading frames (ORFs): the preS/S encoding the three viral surface proteins; the precore (PC)/core encoding the core protein and the nonstructural PC protein, also known as secreted e-antigen (HBeAg); the pol ORF encoding the viral polymerase, which possesses reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase and RNase H activities, and the terminal protein for priming; and the X ORF encoding the small regulatory X protein, which is essential in vivo for viral replication. All four ORFs use a single common polyadenylation signal motif; hence, the HBV-RNA transcripts are polyadenylated and capped.

All three envelope proteins, large (L), middle (M) and small (S) share the same C-terminal domain, which contains the HBsAg, while the L and M proteins display progressive N-terminal extensions. The anti-HBs neutralisation domain has been mapped to amino acids 99–170 of the S-protein and is referred to as the α or 'a'-determinant.

### INTRODUCTION

The human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small enveloped DNA virus causing acute and chronic hepatitis. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, more than 360 million people are chronically infected worldwide and about 1 million people die per year due to HBV-associated liver pathologies. Although HBV replication is not considered directly cytopathic, HBV infection leads to a wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from acute to chronic viral hepatitis, which often progresses to liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Even though numerous epidemiological studies indicated that chronic HBV (CHB) infection represents the main risk factor for liver cancer development, the molecular mechanisms determining HBV persistence and pathogenesis are still poorly defined. HBV displays a unique genomic organisation and replication strategy which confers on the virus the ability to persist in infected hepatocytes. A hallmark of HBV infection is the formation in hepatocyte nuclei of a stable HBV-DNA minichromosome, the so-called covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which serves as template to generate all RNAs necessary for protein production and viral replication. Even if it is known that failure of viral clearance and relapse of viral activity after cessation of antiviral therapy with polymerase inhibitors are mostly due

followed by an irreversible binding of the virus to  
a still unknown hepatocyte-specific receptor.⁵¹⁴  
Following viral entry, the capsids accumulate at  
the nuclear membrane, where interactions with the  
nuclear pore complex may favour the release of the  
HBV genome (rcDNA) into the cell nucleus.¹⁵ To  
establish a productive HBV infection host components  
of the cellular replicative machinery are  
needed to remove the covalently attached terminal  
protein and to complete the positive-DNA strand  
to form a super-coiled cccDNA molecule, which  
after being associated with histone and non-histone  
proteins, is incorporated into the host chromatin.⁶⁹¹⁶ Unlike the provirus DNA of retroviruses, the cccDNA does not need to be integrated  
into the host genome. Albeit integrations of HBV-  
DNA sequences do occur in infected hepatocytes,  
particularly in the presence of DNA damage¹⁷ and  
cell turnover,¹⁸¹⁹ these are typically truncated.

Camouflaged as a minichromosome, and hence  
undetectable by innate immune defense mechanisms, the cccDNA utilises the cellular transcriptional machinery to produce all transcripts  
necessary for protein production and viral replication, which takes place in the cytoplasm after reverse transcription (rt) of a over-length pregenomic RNA (pgRNA).⁹ Viral transcription is under  
the control of two enhancer elements and four distinct viral promoters. Similarly to cellular chromatin, the transcription of the different viral genes  
is regulated by the activity and dynamic interplay  
of numerous cellular transcription factors, coactivators, corepressors and chromatin modifying enzymes.⁶

Experimental studies in the duck model indicated  
that the cccDNA can be formed from incoming virions and from newly synthesised nucleocapsids,  
which instead of being enveloped and secreted into  
the blood, are rather transported into the nucleus to  
ensure accumulation, and later maintenance, of the  
cccDNA pool⁹²⁰ (see figure 1).

Although a high cccDNA copy number is detected in chronically infected ducks and woodchucks,²¹²² lower cccDNA intrahepatic loads are generally determined in human liver biopsies (median 0.1–1 cccDNA copy/cell)²³⁻²⁸ and in HBV chronically infected human liver chimeric uPA/ severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice,²⁹⁻³² suggesting that different viral and host mechanisms may control cccDNA dynamics and cccDNA pool size in human infected hepatocytes.⁶ In this regard, a recent study elegantly showed that HBV converted the rcDNA into cccDNA less efficiently than DHBV in the same human cell background.³³ Although the cccDNA pool appears to be very stable in the absence of cell division, accumulating evidence indicates that hepatocyte proliferation can induce drastic reduction of the intrahepatic cccDNA loads in vivo.¹⁹³² Since the cccDNA lacks centromere structures ensuring correct migration during mitosis, immune-mediated cell death and compensatory hepatocyte regeneration may facilitate cccDNA loss. This could represent a weak point in HBV persistence

Figure 1 The lifecycle of hepatitis B virus (HBV). After binding to still unknown hepatocyte-specific receptor(s), the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm and the HBV genome transferred to the cell nucleus, where it is converted into the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) minichromosome. Viral replication takes place in the cytoplasm after encapsidation and reverse transcription of a over-length pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Through Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum apparatus the core particles acquire the envelope and are secreted. Via viral entry and re-transporting of newly synthesised relaxed circular partially double-stranded DNA (rcDNA) into the cell nucleus, the cccDNA pool can be amplified. Transcription of the preS/S mRNAs leads to the production of L, M, S envelope proteins, which are needed for virion secretion and to produce the non-infectious spherical and filamentous subviral particles (SVPs). The regulatory HBx protein, which can affect gene expression and various cellular pathways, is translated from a shorter X mRNA and is essential for cccDNA-driven HBV replication. The secreted e-antigen (HBeAg) is a non-structural form of the nucleoprotein which, like the SVPs, was shown to display immunomodulating functions (see also figure 3).

presence of non-infectious structures, the spherical and filamentous subviral particles (SVPs), which are exclusively composed of viral envelope proteins and host-derived lipids⁵ and are secreted in a 10³–10⁶-fold excess into the blood of infected individuals (figure 1).

HBV also produces and secretes a non-structural form of the nucleoprotein, the PC protein or HBeAg, which is not required for viral replication, but displays immune-modulating functions and hence contributes to viral persistence. The HBeAg is translated initially as the PC protein P25, and then undergoes cleavage of the N-terminal signal sequence in the ER/Golgi complex, producing a 22 kDa protein (P22), which can either undergo further processing to form the secreted 17 kDa HBeAg (P17), or traffic to the cytosol where it remains localised.¹¹ Except for a 10-amino-acid N-terminal extension, which is highly conserved in all orthohepadnaviruses and contains a putative toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain,¹² HBeAg shares significant homology with the core protein (P21), which is translated using the core AUG codon of the same ORF.¹³

The first step in HBV infection involves a non-cell-type specific primary attachment which is then

deserving further investigation as new therapeutic concepts are explored.³²

The next crucial step in HBV replication is the packaging and rt of pgRNA within the newly formed capsids. After rt and concomitant degradation of the pgRNA, first a single-stranded DNA of minus polarity, whose 5' end remains covalently linked to the terminal protein of the polymerase, and then a complementary plus-strand DNA are synthesised to form the rcDNA.⁹³⁴ Assembly and release of the DNA-containing nucleocapsids appears to require a balanced co-expression of the small and large envelope proteins to recruit the nucleocapsid to the site of budding. Although the role of the envelope proteins in regulating viral particle release and cccDNA amplification is not well understood, recent studies indicate that the lack of envelope protein expression increases cccDNA levels, while co-expression of the envelope proteins favours viral secretion with limited completion of the plus strand.³⁵

PHASES OF CHB

The natural history of CHB

The immunopathogenesis of hepatitis B depends on a complex interplay of host and viral factors. Factors such as age, gender and immune status are important. Perinatal and childhood infection results

in chronic infection in 90–95% and 50% of cases respectively, whereas greater than 95% of immunocompetent adults with acute HBV spontaneously clear the infection. Furthermore, CHB infection is more common in immunocompromised hosts (eg, HIV infection). Viral factors such as HBeAg status are also important. Under normal circumstances viral replication is not cytopathic, and it is the host's immune response, which is typically ineffective and inappropriate, that causes much of the damage associated with CHB.

The natural history of CHB is generally regarded as consisting of four phases³⁶: immune tolerant; HBeAg-positive CHB (immune clearance); immune control (low or non-replicative); and HBeAg negative CHB (immune escape). These phases have been identified on the basis of specific biochemical, serological and virological characteristics, including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HBeAg serostatus, HBV DNA titre, and more recently, HBsAg level (figure 2). It is important to note that these phases do not occur in all individuals with CHB and do not always occur sequentially.³⁷ It is patients in either the immune clearance or immune escape phases that are potential candidates for the currently approved antiviral and immune modulatory treatments.

The immune tolerant phase is characterised by positivity for serum HBeAg, high levels of HBV DNA, normal serum ALT levels and normal/near normal histological profile in the liver. The levels of HBV DNA typically exceed 20000IU/ml while HBsAg levels range from 4.5 to 5.0logIU/ml.³⁸³⁹ Patients in the immune tolerant phase are usually young and were infected early in life. The immune tolerant phase can last for more than 20 years. In contrast, individuals progressing to chronic infection following adulthood infection do not typically undergo a prolonged immune tolerant phase, and may instead enter directly into the immune clearance phase.

When CHB infection is acquired from an early age, the immune clearance phase usually occurs between ages 20 and 40 years, and is characterised by HBeAg positivity, elevated serum ALT levels, fluctuating HBV DNA levels (>20000IU/ml), lower levels of HBsAg (approx 4.3logIU/ml) and histological damage. During this phase, the virus is under intense immune pressure and the emergence of dominant PC and/or basal core promoter (BCP) variants may occur, with eventual HBeAg sero-conversion (SC) and control of HBV replication. Alternatively, HBV escapes from immune clearance with the person then developing HBeAg-negative CHB (figure 3). Following successful HBeAg SC, the majority of patients enter an immune control or low/non-replicative phase, characterised by low/undetectable viral replication and normal ALT levels. A serum HBV DNA of <2000IU/ml and a quantitative HBsAg level of <1000IU/ml have been suggested to differentiate the immune control and escape phases.⁴⁰⁴¹ A subset of patients can enter into the HBeAg-negative hepatitis phase, whereby HBV DNA levels >2000IU/ml and

**Review**

Spontaneous HBV reactivation in the low/non-replicative phase is clinically significant, since this is typically followed by increased hepatitis activity and ALT flares. The annual incidence of hepatic flare has been reported to be over 10% in HBeAg-negative patients. These hepatic flares are due to the resurgence of host immunity against HBV-infected hepatocytes and severe hepatic flares can be complicated by hepatic decompensation in 2–3% of patients. These adverse events typically drive the development of advanced fibrosis, which in time, eventually leads to cirrhosis.

### Major virological events during the natural history of CHB

Viral evolution is important in the pathogenesis of chronic viral diseases such as hepatitis C, HIV and HBV. For example, during the immune clearance phase, Lim et al demonstrated that before HBeAg SC actually occurred, the viral sequence diversity in the PC/BCP region was significantly higher in HBeAg seroconverters compared with non-seroconverters. The selection pressure driving this diversity was found to be in effect at least 3 years before HBeAg SC actually occurred, and interestingly, the viral diversity increased further after viral load reduction. These results extended previous work demonstrating that viral mutation rates are increased in the immunoelimination phase compared with patients in the immunotolerant phase of CHB. Lim and colleagues also demonstrated that nucleotide substitution rates persisted at high levels after HBeAg SC, with viral diversity increasing further. Thus, it appears that this phase is far from being a 'non-replicative state', and that there is an ongoing dynamic post-SC process, albeit at lower levels of viral load, with viral diversity likely being driven by an immune-based selection pressure such as significant production of anti-HBe antibody.

### Occult HBV infection: the final phase of CHB?

Occult HBV infection (OBI) can be defined as the presence of HBV DNA in the liver (with detectable or undetectable HBV DNA in the serum) of individuals testing HBsAg negative by currently available assays. When detectable, the amount of serum HBV DNA is typically very low (<200 IU/ml). The molecular basis of OBI is related to the long-lasting persistence of HBV cccDNA in hepatocyte nuclei. Although some HBV isolates from OBI cases may harbour 'a'/α determinant mutations that prevent HBsAg detection by antibodies against the wild type virus, almost all OBI cases are infected with replication-competent HBV rather than escape variants, and so the lack of HBsAg in the peripheral compartment is regarded as a possible reflection of 'strong immune control' or suppression of viral gene expression of the infecting virus. The role of OBI in the development of chronic liver disease and as a risk factor for HCC development appears significant and further molecular studies are

Figure 3 Proposed interactions between hepatitis B virus (HBV) proteins and components of the innate immune system. The diagram shows the intracellular effects of the precore/hepatitis B secreted e-antigen (HBeAg) on hepatocyte signalling via the MyD88-dependent (toll-like receptor (TLR)-2) and MyD88-independent (TLR-4) pathways. The terminal protein of the HBV polymerase was also reported to hinder the type I interferon (IFN)-mediated transcription of IFN-stimulated genes by impairing nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, while HBx expression was shown to inhibit the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)—MAVS signalling. Circulating subviral particles (SVPs) were shown to repress TLR-9 signalling by enhancing SOCS expression in dendritic cells (pDCs). Furthermore, secreted HBeAg was shown to interact and downregulate TLR-2 expression on hepatocytes. In HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB), the absence of HBeAg results in upregulation of TLR-2 and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα).

increased quantitative HBsAg (3.5 log IU/ml) are found with increasing serum ALT levels and consequent further histological damage (figure 2).

It is generally accepted that the extent of chronic liver disease is directly linked to the frequency, duration and severity of hepatic flares occurring in either the HBeAg-positive (immune clearance) and/or HBeAg-negative phases. HBeAg SC is predictive of a sustained multi-log reduction in HBV DNA (>3 log₁₀ IU/ml), a decrease in intrahepatic inflammatory activity and an improved prognosis. For these reasons, HBeAg SC has been traditionally used as an important therapeutic endpoint in the management of HBeAg-positive CHB. Not surprisingly, then, delayed HBeAg SC, particularly in patients >40 years old, is associated with higher fibrosis scores on liver biopsy. HBsAg SC is associated with a favourable long-term clinical prognosis, but unfortunately, spontaneous HBsAg loss and/or SC, now regarded as an important immune control endpoint, is rare in CHB with approximately a 1% annual rate.

needed to elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.⁵¹

### VIRAL BIOMARKERS IN THE BLOOD COMPARTMENT: RESEARCH AND DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS

Specific serology has proven to be the mainstay of diagnostic testing for hepatitis B. Several commercial immunoassays are available for the various hepatitis B markers of viral antigens and antibodies.⁵² Recently, sensitive and reliable assays have been developed to quantify serum HBsAg and HBeAg. Quantitative HBsAg levels are reported in IU/ml, with 0.1IU/ml being equivalent to approximately 0.1 ng/ml of HBsAg,⁵³ which is in turn equivalent to 2 × 10⁷ subviral HBsAg particles or 5 × 10⁶ virions. For HBeAg measurement, most quantitative assays are modified by reference to an external standard, such as the Paul Ehrlich (PE) Institute reference standard for HBeAg, and results are expressed in PE IU/ml.⁵⁴

The presence of large amounts of HBsAg and HBeAg in the serum, however, may affect the ability to detect circulating antibodies and may obscure the onset of HBeAg or HBsAg SC. The available commercial assays usually detect anti-HBs and anti-HBe antibodies only after the respective antigens have been cleared from the serum. By using more sensitive immunoassays it was possible to detect antibody in the presence of excess serum antigen.⁵⁵ These approaches identified serological responses in the context of active viral replication. For example, all patients with ‘active’ CHB and the majority of patients in the so-called tolerant phase demonstrated ongoing humoral immune responses, including anti-HBe and anti-HBs production. Anti-HBe and anti-HBs production may coexist with virions and subviral HBsAg particles for many years before viral clearance and loss of antigenemia eventually occur. HBeAg SC almost certainly accounts for increased quasispecies diversity in PC/core and BCP regions.⁴⁸ The clinical picture of a relatively non-overlapping SC from HBeAg-positive to anti-HBe-positive status during CHB should be replaced by a more dynamic interplay of a potent host selection pressure (eg, B-cell response) targeted to key epitopes of HBV that result in emergence of escape variants that now have a replicative fitness advantage above the rest of the pool of HBV quasispecies.

The molecular detection tools for HBV DNA are useful for resolving ambiguous serological patterns, in staging patients in the various phases of CHB (see figure 3), and for monitoring patients undergoing antiviral therapy. Sustained suppression of HBV replication as assessed by HBV DNA measurement currently represents the cornerstone of evaluation of antiviral efficacy which must aim to reduce HBV DNA to as low a level as possible, ideally below the lower limit of detection by real-time PCR assays (<10–15IU/ml). Thus, the goal of antiviral therapy is to suppress viral replication to a level that will lead to biochemical remission,

histological improvement and prevention of disease progression.³⁶ However, recent studies have indicated that even potent nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy minimally impacts on the HBsAg levels in blood. This is not surprising since NAs block the HBV DNA replication pathway (via inhibiting rt) and have no direct effect on transcription or translation of the Pre-S1/Pre-S2/S, Pre-core and X genes.⁵⁶ In contrast, immune-based therapies do reduce transcription⁵⁷ and viral protein levels⁵⁸⁵⁹ through non-cytolytic and cytolytic⁶⁰ mechanisms, as part of their broader antiviral activity.

HBsAg SC is now being regarded as the new treatment endpoint because HBsAg loss has been associated with successful immunological control of HBV and durable suppression of viral replication, thereby representing an endpoint for patients to be able to cease oral NA or immune-based therapies. Assessment of on-treatment changes in HBsAg titres may facilitate new management algorithms and future trials aimed at achieving this important endpoint. For example, the role of quantitative HBsAg in predicting response to pegylated interferon (IFN) therapy has been the focus of several recent studies.⁶¹⁻⁶³ In HBeAg-positive patients, reduction of HBsAg levels to <1500IU/ml at week 12 has been shown to be an early favourable sign of future HBsAg clearance. Over 50% of patients on pegylated IFN who achieved this level at week 12 were found to have HBeAg SC 6 months post treatment and nearly 20% of these patients achieved subsequent HBsAg clearance at 6 months post treatment. In contrast, a HBsAg level of >20000IU/ml at week 12 was associated with a very low rate of HBeAg SC and so may become a potential stopping rule of therapy.⁶³⁶⁴ In HBeAg-negative patients treated with pegylated IFN, the decline in HBsAg titre at week 12 has also been shown to be a useful predictor of achieving an undetectable viral load at 24 weeks post therapy.⁶¹ Among patients who achieved HBsAg decline ≥10% from baseline at week 12 of treatment almost 50% achieved HBV DNA ≤2000IU/ml at 1 year post treatment and 40% of these individuals achieved HBsAg clearance at 5 years post treatment. Rijckborst and colleagues⁶⁵ proposed a clinically useful algorithm in HBeAg-negative CHB that any HBsAg decline at week 12 with a 2 log drop or more in HBV DNA could predict almost 40% of sustained responders in their cohort. If patients did not achieve a HBsAg decline or only had a <2 log drop in HBV DNA, then the chance of responding was 0%.

Quantitative HBeAg testing has proved to be more problematic mainly because of the lack of commercially available assays and studies have used mainly in-house techniques with reference to external standards such as the one available from the PE Institute. Fried and colleagues⁵⁴ demonstrated a moderately significant relationship between baseline HBeAg level and subsequent HBeAg SC in patients treated with pegylated IFN. A level of ≤31PEIU/ml at baseline was associated

with a greater than 50% chance of HBeAg SC. The
on-treatment week 12 and 24 HBeAg levels were
more likely to be associated with a negative
predictive response; for example, only 14% of
patients at week 12 with a qHBeAg of >100 PEIU/
ml went on to a HBeAg SC at week 72 whereas just
4% of patients with a qHBeAg of >100 PEIU/ml at
week 24 achieved HBeAg SC at week 72, possibly
forming the basis of another stopping rule.

VIRAL BIOMARKERS IN THE LIVER

The effects of antiviral therapy on serum HBV
DNA levels are well documented; while less information is available about their effects on intra-
hepatic virological parameters. The development of
highly selective quantitative real-time PCR assays
has provided the necessary tools to determine
intrahepatic HBV DNA levels, including the quanti-
fication of cccDNA loads²³²⁷²⁸⁶⁶⁶⁷ and transcrip-
tional activity²⁵²⁶ in liver biopsy specimens.
For example, by measuring ‘virion productivity’
(defined as the ratio of intrahepatic rcDNA/
cccDNA) and ‘transcriptional activity’ (defined as
the level of pgRNA) it was observed that patients
with HBeAg-negative CHB had significantly lower
levels of viraemia, intrahepatic cccDNA (>1 log
lower) and rcDNA (>2 log lower).²⁶ Furthermore,
virion productivity per cccDNA molecule was
found to be fivefold lower than in HBeAg-positive
disease. Levels of pgRNA were correspondingly
reduced, suggesting that the low virion produc-
tivity resulted from lower amounts of pgRNA. In
contrast to patients with HBeAg-positive CHB,
there was no correlation between serum viral load
and the amount of cccDNA in the HBeAg-negative
patients, consistent with the observed impairment
of virion productivity (figure 2). Although HBsAg
titres were significantly lower in the HBeAg-nega-
tive cohort, pre-S/S mRNA levels and HBsAg titres
per cccDNA molecule appeared similar between
HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients,
indicating that the production of SVPs was not
impaired in the HBeAg-negative phase, but rather
that the replication pathway might be selectively
blocked. The study of Volz and colleagues²⁶ also
indicated that patients’ transition through SC into
HBeAg-negative disease is clearly not a ‘black and
white’ immunological event, as suggested by
existing commercial serological assays. Rather,
a progressive increase in the viral diversity with
positive selection of viral quasi-species defective for
HBeAg production was observed. Identifying these
selection pressures will be essential for under-
standing the host-virus interplay determining the
course of CHB.
Although independent reports have shown that
cccDNA loads vary significantly in the different
phases of CHB infection, the correlation between
antigenemia and intrahepatic cccDNA levels has
not been well established and the results
conflicting.²⁶⁶⁸–⁷⁰ The reason for such discrepan-
cies may be multifactorial and due to virological
factors (HBV genotype differences, ⁷¹ emergence of

mutations⁷²⁷³) and host-mediated factors, which
may affect cccDNA activity causing fluctuations in
serum HBsAg concentrations among patients
presenting similar cccDNA levels. Differences in
cccDNA amounts determined by needle liver
biopsy may also reflect uneven distributions of the
cccDNA in different parts of the liver. The acquisition of viral DNA integrations containing an
intact preS/S ORF may also contribute to the
production of HBsAg and alter such correlations.
Polymerase inhibitors do not directly block
formation and activity of the cccDNA, a significant
decrease in cccDNA levels (approximately 1 log
reduction) has often been observed after 1 year of
therapy.²³²⁸⁶⁶⁶⁷ Such reduction is supposed to
derive from the lack of incoming viruses from the
blood and insufficient recycling of viral nucleocapsids to the nucleus, due to suppression of viral DNA
synthesis in the cytoplasm. However, mathematical modelling indicated that many years of nucleoside drug administration are needed to achieve
cccDNA depletion. Thus, persistence of the
cccDNA minichromosome remains the key factor
responsible for failure of viral clearance and relapse
of viral activity after cessation of antiviral therapy
with polymerase inhibitors in chronically infected
individuals. Furthermore, if viral suppression is not
complete, the selection of resistant variants
escaping antiviral therapy is likely to occur.²⁰⁷⁴ Under antiviral pressure, such variants will
contribute to the production and further selection
of replication-competent resistant mutants, which
will spread to other hepatocytes and, eventually,
may replace the wild-type cccDNA molecules in
the liver.
More potent HBV suppression using combination therapy has been achieved with 99% inhibition
of intrahepatic virion productivity in patients who
had received 1 year of pegylated IFNα and adefovirdipivoxil,²⁸ while viral suppression appeared
reduced to 76% during the following 2 years, after
patients were shifted to ADV monotherapy. Recent
studies also showed that reduction of circulating
HBsAg is more marked in patients treated with
pegylated IFNα alone or in combination with
nucleoside analogues, in comparison to patients
receiving monotherapy with polymerase inhibitors.⁶² Such differences are important and not
entirely surprising because IFNα displays immune-
modulating capacities and can induce direct antiviral effects, preventing the formation of viral
RNA-containing core particles, accelerating pgRNA
degradation and the decay of core particles.⁵⁹⁷⁵⁷⁶ Furthermore, the most recent studies performed in
vitro and in HBV-infected human-liver chimeric
uPA/SCID mice showed that IFNα administration
inhibits the transcription of all HBV-RNAs by
inducing epigenetic repression of the cccDNA.⁵⁷
Thus, these results identify a molecular mechanism
whereby IFNα can reduce virion DNA productivity
and the levels of HBsAg.
Although understanding of the molecular mechanisms influencing intrahepatic virion productivity
is just starting to emerge, these studies indicate

that quantitative measurements of serological viral
parameters may become useful to monitor and
predict treatment response within individual
patients, while further studies employing better
standardised intrahepatic assays and well characterised patient cohorts are needed to resolve
previous differences in particular studies.

FACTORS INFLUENCING HBV PATHOGENESIS
Persistence of chronic HBV infection is due to the
ability of the cccDNA to survive within the hepatocytes and to the successful establishment of
a complex network of virus-host interactions
permitting the virus to manipulate the cellular
machinery to meet its replication and propagation
requirements, and to evade the antiviral response of
the host. Over the years, mutual attempts to
control each other may set the stage for the
development of severe liver pathologies, such as
liver cirrhosis and HCC.

Immuno-pathogenesis of HBV infection: general considerations
The innate immune system represents an immediate, first-line defence against foreign pathogens
and plays a fundamental role in regulating the
adaptive immune response. While the role of the
adaptive immune system in the resolution of HBV
infection has been studied extensively,
knowledge of the innate immune processes occurring
in HBV infection has been limited by the
restricted availability of in vitro and in vivo infection systems and technical difficulties in recruiting
patients at the earlier stages of infection. Despite
these limitations, studies in acute infected
patients and chimpanzees documented a lack of
type I IFN induction and proinflammatory cytokine production in acute HBV infection. In
contrast to these observations, recent in vitro
studies indicated that the innate immune response
of the hepatocytes may sense the infection and
limit the spread of HBV. A modest activation
of IFN-stimulated genes was also shown in human
hepatocytes after HBV infection in chimeric mice.
Induction of the antiviral state and production of
type 1 IFN (α/β) can be mediated by pathogen
recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors
(TLRs). In turn, type 1 IFN production stimulates
antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and
Kupffer cells (resident intrahepatic macrophages) to
produce interleukins (IL-8, IL-12, IL-18) and other
cytokines. IL-12 and IL-18 subsequently induce
natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT)
cells. NK cells can also be activated by the major
histocompatibility complex I molecules on the
surface of infected hepatocytes or by recognition of
stress-induced molecules. Although NK and NKT
cells can promote liver damage through direct
cytotoxic effects, their role in HBV persistence
and mechanisms regulating NK cell function in
HBV infection are still controversial. The hepatocellular injury caused by HBV infection is predominantly immune mediated.

immune attack by the host against HBV is mainly
mediated by a cellular response to small epitopes of
HBV proteins, especially HBcAg, presented on the
surface of liver cells. HLA class I restricted CD8
cells recognise HBV peptide fragments derived from
intracellular processing and presentation on the
liver cell surface by class I molecules. This process
leads to direct cell killing by the CD8 cytotoxic
T lymphocytes. It is important to note that B and
T lymphocytes are only activated following recognition of HBV by the innate immune system.
Ultimately, it is the breadth and strength of this
specific adaptive immune response which determines the outcome of acute and chronic HBV
infection. Animal and clinical studies demonstrated
that in acute self-limited HBV infection, the CD8
T-cell and CD4 T-cell responses to HBV proteins are strong, polyclonal and multispecific, while in
chronic HBV infection, the responses are weak and
narrowly focused. Besides having a direct cytolytic effect, as discussed above, CD8 T cells also
have a non-cytolytic effect through the production
of IFNγ and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) (also
produced by NK and NKT cells), which are known
to elicit antiviral effects via multiple mechanisms.
Indeed, studies have shown that IFNα and IFNβ
significantly suppress HBV gene expression in vivo,
indicating that non-cytolytic direct antiviral effects
elicited by the immune response may play a determinant role in controlling HBV infection in
immunological normal adults. Thus the
current concept is that non-cytolytic and cytolytic
mechanisms are requisite for successful HBV
control and eventual clearance.

HBV interactions with innate immune responses
of the hepatocytes
The limited induction of innate immune responses
determined upon HBV infection may also be due to
recently recognised abilities of HBV to evade innate
immune recognition. TLRs are evolutionary
conserved germline-encoded pattern recognition
receptors that play a crucial role in early host
defences by recognising pathogen-associated
molecular patterns and also serve as an important
bridge between the innate and the adaptive
immune response. HBeAg was shown to act as an
immune decoy for the core antigen by depleting
HBeAg-specific and HBcAg-specific T-helper cells
and exerting a tolerogenic effect in utero.
Furthermore, HBeAg has been shown to potentially
downregulate genes involved in cell signalling, RNA
transport and processing, cytosol-nuclear trafficking and innate immune responses. Lang et al confirmed the presence of a Box-2-like TIR motif
within the unique N-terminal 10-amino-acid
sequence of PC/HBeAg protein which could
antagonise TLR signalling pathways via blocking
the adapter proteins Mal, TRAM and TRIF but not
MyD-88, thereby suppressing TIR-induced nuclear
factor kB and IFNβ activation (table 1). These
findings provide a possible mechanism of the
HBeAg immunomanipulation' of the innate
immune response, including the induction of

dendritic cells, probably via stimulation of suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 expression. Although most of these analyses were performed in systems that overexpressed HBx and further analyses are needed in more relevant infection systems, taken together, these studies suggest that distinct virus-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the limited effectiveness of the innate immune responses and subsequent adaptive immune responses in HBV infection and thereby may significantly contribute to viral persistence.

Mutual interplays influencing HBV activity and cellular pathways

The incidence of HCC development has been shown to correlate with the levels of HBV replicative activity. This highlights the importance of elucidating the mechanisms modulating viral activity because these factors will affect both cccDNA loads and cellular pathways, thus influencing the clinical course of infection.

Numerous transcription factors implicated in the activation of hepatic metabolic processes, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor, cAMP responsive element binding protein, retinoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, are known to bind the HBV genome and the recruitment of liver-enriched transcription factors on the cccDNA minichromosome appears essential for controlling viral gene expression. However, interactions between viral components and cellular factors may also impact the liver metabolism. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones playing major roles in glucose homeostasis and the presence of a glucocorticoid response element on HBV genome can explain the so-called HBV reactivation observed in patients receiving steroid-based immunosuppressive agents. Although a clinical association between HBV and glucose homeostasis is lacking, HBV was shown to promote lipogenesis and fatty acid accumulation in HBV-replicating transgenic mice and in the liver of HBV-infected patients. Such metabolic alterations are likely to contribute to disease progression. Furthermore, a multitude of in vitro transfection experiments showed that HBx can modify cellular pathways by altering the activity of numerous transcription factors, kinases of the Src family, of the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and members of the protein kinase C pathway, and by affecting mitochondria function and protein degradation. Whether HBx, expressed at levels comparable to those present in infected human livers, also similarly affects these cellular functions awaits further investigation.

CccDNA-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated a correlation between viraemia levels and acetylation status of cccDNA-bound histones, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may affect the cccDNA transcriptional status in the different phases of chronic infection. Using ChIP assays HBx was shown to be recruited to the cccDNA minichromosome, where by favouring cccDNA-bound histone

'tolerance' in the first phase of CHB, especially following perinatal HBV transmission. In patients with HBeAg-positive CHB, the expression of TLR-2 on hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and peripheral blood monocytes was shown to be significantly down-regulated, while upregulation of the TLR-2 pathway and increased TNFα production was found during HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis (Table 1). Although these clinical studies have indicated a role for HBeAg in downregulating immune surveillance of HBV, loss of HBeAg synthesis commonly occurs during chronic HBV infection and the emergence of HBeAg-negative variants may present selective advantages, possibly by limiting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated clearance of infected hepatocytes. However, the selection of HBeAg variants is associated with increased viral activity, more severe liver disease and worse prognosis.

In support of the concept that HBV has evolved mechanisms to sabotage pathways of the IFN response, a recent study in human-liver chimeric mice showed that administration of regular IFNα failed to promote detectable nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) in HBV-infected human hepatocytes, although STAT-1 nuclear accumulation and enhancement of antiviral defence mechanisms were promptly induced in uninfected human hepatocytes. Furthermore, in vitro studies indicated that HBV may affect STAT methylation and activity of cellular DNA methyltransferases (DNMT).

The non-structural HBx protein has been shown to also interfere with the innate immunity by down-regulating mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein by suppressing the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) pathway in vitro. Interactions between HBx, mitochondrial antiviral signalling and members of the cellular epigenetic machinery have been also reported. Furthermore, plasma-derived HBsAg SVPs were reported to inhibit TLR-9 mediated IFNα production by plasmacytoid

acetylation, HBx appears to play an essential role in initiating the cccDNA-driven transcription of the HBV RNAs (figure 1). However, epigenetic modifications, such as DNA hypermethylation, may induce suppression of cccDNA transcription, since increased expression of DNMTs has been correlated with increased cccDNA methylation and decreased HBV transcription in advanced HBV infection. Moreover, HBx was shown to act as a potent epigenetic modifying factor in human liver by modulating the transcription of DNMT required for maintenance of hypomethylation of tumour suppressor genes. The HBx-promoted hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes suggests a novel mechanism by which this promiscuous transactivating protein may accelerate hepatocarcinogenesis.

Numerous cellular factors, such as microRNAs, may affect HBV productivity by binding directly to HBV transcripts or by targeting cellular transcription factors relevant for cccDNA transcription. Further studies based on a combination of bioinformatic and miRNA expression screenings are needed to determine whether specific patterns of miRNA expression could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for liver disease prediction.

A number of studies identified host variations that may contribute to the outcome of HBV infection. Genome-wide association studies determined, for instance, polymorphisms in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) allele DRB1, HLA-DP and the oestrogen receptor that were associated with the susceptibility to HBV clearance or persistence. Similarly, naturally occurring sequence variations in the promoter region of CXCL10 gene were shown to result in the altered expression of the CXCL10 protein, which is important for the intrahepatic recruitment of inflammatory cells, thereby impacting disease progression of patients with chronic HBV infection.

**Emergence of virus quasi-species and infection with other viruses**

The selective pressure induced by host immune responses and/or during antiviral therapy with polymerase inhibitors promotes the emergence of mutations. For instance, single amino acid substitutions have been shown to impair HBsAg recognition and lead to the development of acute or chronic HBV infection despite immunoprophylaxis. The region of the genome encoding for the rt domain of the HBV polymerase overlaps completely with the envelope; therefore, mutations emerging during nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment may lead to changes in the viral envelope. In vitro studies have shown that the rtA181T mutation, which introduces a nonsense mutation in the overlapping envelope gene, leads to intracellular retention of the truncated surface proteins and viral particles. As discussed above, during the immune competent HBeAg-positive phase, the host immune system may set the stage for the selection of PC/BCP mutations with reduced or absent HBeAg secretion. Sequencing of cccDNA amplicons

indicated that the replacement of wild type cccDNA with populations of BCP mutations was associated with the re-establishment of high virion productivity (figure 3). In agreement with these observations, studies in chimpanzees indicated that HBeAg-negative viruses induce more severe hepatitis and the accumulation of BCP mutations have been shown to be associated with worsening of clinical manifestations and development of HCC.

HBV/HCV and HBV/hepatitis D virus (HDV) co-infection are known to lead to a rapid and more severe progression of chronic liver disease. Although the virological profiles in the setting of co-infection appears to be widely divergent and fluctuating levels of viraemia are observed, information about the mechanisms responsible for such variations are scant. Although immune-mediated mechanisms may play a major role in suppressing HBV replication in the setting of co-infection, recent studies in chimeric mice showed that HDV lowered HBV productivity even in the absence of adaptive immune responses, indicating that complex virus-virus and virus-host interactions may affect replication levels and disease progression in the course of HBV/HDV co-infection.

**CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE DIRECTION**

In the past decade, there has been an explosion of knowledge and research in the field of hepatitis B molecular diagnostics. The availability of innovative human hepatocyte-based HBV infection systems and the development of molecular techniques permitting molecular analysis, such as cccDNA quantification, ChIP and transcriptome assays, in patient liver biopsies have started to provide new insight about host and viral factors regulating the activity of the cccDNA mini-chromosome. Furthermore, results showing the existence of interferences between HBV and pathways of the innate immune response suggest that manipulation of TLRs via TLR ligands may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of CHB by reducing viral replication and by promoting improved immune control. Because of the limitations encountered by using different experimental systems, cellular and molecular analyses based on human blood and liver biopsy samples remain indispensable to improve our knowledge of the pathobiology of HBV infection. It can be envisaged that the future understanding of the natural history of CHB will continue to evolve and that management algorithms will become more individualised, incorporating quantitative serology and possibly genotyping and markers of the innate and adaptive immune responses.
