**Abstract** C-type lectins (CTLS) represent the most complex family of animal/human lectins that comprises 17 different groups. During evolution, CTLS have developed by diversification to cover a broad range of glycan ligands. However, ligand binding by CTLS is not necessarily restricted to glycans as some CTLS also bind to proteins, lipids, inorganic molecules, or ice crystals. CTLS share a common fold that harbors a Ca${}^{2+}$ for contact to the sugar and about 18 invariant residues in a phylogenetically conserved pattern. In vertebrates, CTLS have numerous functions, including serum glycoprotein homeostasis, pathogen sensing, and the initiation of immune responses. Myeloid CTLS in innate immunity are mainly expressed by antigen-presenting cells and play a prominent role in the recognition of a variety of pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, myeloid CTLS such as the macrophage inducible CTL (Mincle) or Clec-9a may also bind to self-antigens and thus contribute to immune homeostasis. While some CTLS induce pro-inflammatory responses and thereby lead to activation of adaptive immune responses, other CTLS act as inhibitory receptors and dampen cellular functions. Since CTLS are key players in pathogen recognition and innate immunity, targeting CTLS may be a promising strategy for cell-specific delivery of drugs or vaccine antigens and to modulate immune responses.

## Introduction

The pioneering work on the asialoglycoprotein receptor paved the way to the biochemical characterization of the first mammalian lectin (for further information, please see Manning et al. [2017]). The dependence of sugar binding on Ca${}^{2+}$ and its sequence were the starting point for suggesting a terminology (C-type for Ca${}^{2+}$ requirement) and building molecular relationships by sequence homology in a domain of 130 amino acids (Drickamer [1988]; Gready and Zelensky [2009]). Of note for histochemistry, C-type lectins (CTLS) are also represented among the well-known CD markers (Gabius [2015]; Gabius et al. [2016]). The CTL fold is the most frequent among the binding sites for glycans found in Nature [see gallery of animal/human (plant) lectins in Solis et al. [2015]; Manning et al. [2017]]. The special feature is the direct contact of the Ca${}^{2+}$ to the bound sugar via coordination bonds. Along with the topology of presentation of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), often in oligomers as in serum collectins or membrane-spanning CTLS, these lectins target distinct counter-receptors, that is, certain carbohydrate motifs presented by distinct glycoproteins or glycolipids (for the principles of the sugar code, see Gabius and Roth [2017]; for details on these glycoconjugates and their biosynthesis, see Bhide and Colley [2017], Corfield [2017], Higuero et al. [2017], Kopitz [2017]).

Although the majority of CTLS recognize glycan ligands in a Ca${}^{2+}$-dependent manner, binding is not necessarily

restricted to glycans, but may also include non-carbohydrate ligands such as proteins, lipids, inorganic molecules, or even ice crystals (Mitchell and Gibson 2015). According to their structure, the CTL superfamily has been classified into 17 different groups (Fig. 1) (Drickamer and Fadden 2002; Zelensky and Gready 2005). The CTL superfamily is highly diverse and includes secreted proteins as well as transmembrane proteins. This diversity among the different classes of CTLs is also reflected by their manifold functions in the cell where CTLs may mediate cell-cell interactions and are involved in signal transduction processes, pathogen recognition, and innate immunity (Fig. 2) (Drickamer and Taylor 2015).

In this review, we will briefly highlight relevant classes of CTLs, namely the collectins, endocytic receptors,

A major focus of this review will be on pathogen recognition by myeloid CTLs and their role in innate immunity and immune homeostasis. Finally, selected examples will be presented on cell-specific CTL targeting using multivalent glycan display.

### Collectins: the first line of host defense

Collectins (collagen-containing C-type lectins, group III according to the classification shown in Fig. 1) are oligomeric proteins that are characterized by a collagen-like domain with a short Cysteine-rich N-terminus (Drickamer et al. 1986). The N-terminal and collagen-like domains determine the quaternary structure of the collectins,

Fig. 2 Functions of C-type lectins in innate immunity. CTLs have multiple functions in innate immunity and contribute to the homing of leukocytes and immune cell trafficking (left) as well as pathogen recognition and subsequent T cell activation (right). Left during inflammatory processes, endothelial cells are activated which then up-regulate the expression of selectins and integrins. Leukocytes (such as neutrophils or T cells) bind to the endothelium through interaction of their surface protein PSGL-1 with P-selectin or E-selectin [so-called “rolling adhesion,” (1)]. Leukocyte–leukocyte interactions may also occur through PSGL-1/L-selectin interactions (2). These interactions enable tethering, rolling, and later on adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium (3). Right Myeloid CTLs expressed by antigen-presenting cells recognize pathogens or pathogen-derived ligands (1). Upon CTL engagement, pathogens are internalized via endocytosis (2), processed and peptides are presented by MHC class-II molecules to CD4⁺ T cells (3). CTL-mediated signaling leads to the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/86 (4) and the release of cytokines (5). T cells are subsequently activated by recognizing MHC-II/peptide complexes through their T cell receptor in the presence of co-stimulation (6). CD4⁺ T cells may further differentiate into Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells depending on the cytokines released by antigen-presenting cells (7)

whereas the CRD is responsible for glycan recognition. Due to the trimeric formation of the collectins, the CRD contains three carbohydrate binding sites. Since the quaternary structure impacts cooperative interactions among CRDs in a given collectin, differences in the N-terminal and collagen-like domains may markedly influence ligand binding. The first discovered collectin was the conglutinin that was originally described as a bovine serum component capable of agglutinating erythrocytes opsonized with antibodies and complement (Bordet and Gay 1906). To date, nine soluble and transmembrane collectins have been described, namely the mannan-binding lectin (MBL), also termed mannose-binding protein (MBP), the conglutinin, collectin (CL) of 43 kDa (CL-43), CL-46, collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1), collectin liver 1 (CL-L1), collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1), and the surfactant proteins (SP) SP-A and SP-D. Among those, the MBL is the best characterized (Dobó et al. 2016). The collectins act as mediators of host defense by recognizing a variety of microorganisms and interacting with effector proteins, including complement components, but they also participate in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis (Garred et al. 2016). Furthermore, they promote the production of cytokines and the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectins are key players in activating the humoral arm of innate immunity and play a crucial role in immunoregulation and disease modulation (Foo et al. 2015). In addition, they also contribute to the chemotaxis of numerous cell subsets such as neutrophils (Jaillon et al. 2016), macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) (Hansen et al. 2016). For SP-D, a key role was shown in DC homing to lymph nodes, since inhibition of SP-D-mediated homing during an acute inflammatory

response caused DC retention in the peripheral lung tissue (Ge et al. 2016).

### Asialoglycoprotein receptors: maintenance of body homeostasis

Asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) are type II transmembrane proteins, characterized by a short cytoplasmic tail followed by a transmembrane domain and an extracellular part carrying a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) which harbors the Ca²⁺/carbohydrate binding site (Zelen-sky and Gready 2005). It was demonstrated that ASGPRs contribute to the regulation of glycoprotein levels in serum, thus maintaining homeostasis (Cummings and McEver 2009). A major focus has been on the human ASGPR, a type II transmembrane protein consisting of two subunits, H1 and H2 (Manning et al. 2017). ASGPR regulates serum glycoprotein homeostasis by binding and uptake of desialylated glycoproteins (Rogers and Kornfeld 1971) with the H1 subunit mediating Ca²⁺-dependent galactose/GalNAc recognition. In addition, some α2,6-sialylated glycans are ligands for the ASGPR-mediated clearance of glycoproteins as well. To explore the role of ASGPR in serum glycoprotein levels, mice lacking the HL-2 gene encoding for the minor subunit of the ASGPR were generated (Ishibashi et al. 1994). Interestingly, although these mice were unable to clear the high affinity ASGPR ligand asialoorosomucoid, they did not exhibit an accumulation of desialylated glycoproteins or lipoproteins in their circulation. ASGPR is an attractive target for liver-specific drug and gene delivery because it is exclusively expressed by hepatocytes, thus numerous approaches have successfully been employed for ASGPR targeting (Kikkeri et al. 2009; Bernardes et al. 2010; Lepenies et al. 2013).

### Selectins: mediators of cell–cell interactions

The well-described group of selectins is divided into three subgroups: L-selectins, E-selectins, and P-selectins (CD62L, CD62E, CD62P, for an overview of the glycobiology of the CD system, see Gabius et al. 2015; McEver 2015). Selectins are type I transmembrane proteins; typical structural elements of selectins are the epidermal growth factor-like domain, several domain repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Angiari 2015). While L-selectins are expressed by leukocytes, E-selectins are mainly found on activated endothelial cells and P-selectins are predominantly expressed by platelets, but also by endothelial cells. Selectins act as cell adhesion molecules and control leukocyte trafficking in the early phase of an immune response. In this process, selectins facilitate interactions between circulating leukocytes and the vascular endothelium. As shown in Fig. 2, endothelial cells up-regulate the expression of selectins during inflammatory processes. Leukocytes such as neutrophils or T cells bind to the endothelium through the interaction of their surface glycoprotein P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1, also known as CD162) containing the tetrasaccharide sialyl-Le^x^ with P- or E-selectin on the endothelium (Zarbock et al. 2011).

### Natural killer cell receptors: license for killing

CTLD-containing natural killer (NK) cell receptors are divided into two subfamilies based on their ability to activate or inhibit NK cell functions. They are expressed by NK cells and bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I and -II molecules rather than to glycans. Consistently, most NK cell receptors lack a conserved Ca²⁺ binding site and other typical structural elements of CTLD-containing proteins. Since NK cell receptors are known to recognize self-ligands, they sense the body for abnormal cells such as virus-infected cells or tumor cells. NK cell activation, including target cell killing as well as the production of cytokines, is regulated by the integration of signals received via activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors (Vivier et al. 2004; Pegram et al. 2011).

### Lectin receptors in innate immunity

The immune system is a remarkable host defense system that enables detection and elimination of invading pathogens (Müller et al. 2008). Pathogen sensing by innate immunity is mediated by the recognition of conserved pathogen-derived ligands (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs) by so-called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) predominantly expressed by host immune cells (for an overview, see Kumagai and Akira 2010; Takeuchi and Akira 2010). Upon sensing of PAMPs, PRR engagement may induce immediate effector functions such as cell degranulation and phagocytosis, but it also impacts antigen presentation, co-stimulation and thereby initiates adaptive immune responses. Several classes of PRRs are known, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, and lectin receptors. While TLRs recognize a variety of microbial ligands, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide, lipopeptides, flagellin, or unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotide DNA, the intracellular NOD-like receptors NOD1 and NOD2 recognize peptidoglycan motifs from bacteria consisting of *N*-acetylglucosamine and *N*-acetylmuramic acid. In contrast, the intracellular RIG-I-like receptors sense dsRNA and play an essential role in viral recognition (Wu and Hur 2015). Among the lectin receptors in innate immunity, three major classes are well-described: siglecs, galectins, and CTLs (Gabius et al. 2015; Bhide and Colley 2017;

Manning et al. 2017). While siglecs bind to glycans carrying sialic acid residues, galectins represent a lectin superfamily defined by their specificity for β-galactoside sugars (for an overview, see Kaltner et al. 2017). In the following, this review will focus on myeloid CTLs, their role in pathogen recognition, and their functions in innate immunity.

### Myeloid CTLs: an overview

CTLD-containing proteins are phylogenetically conserved and already contribute to immunity in invertebrates, including insects, crustaceans, and nematodes (for an overview, see Pees et al. 2016). In vertebrates, myeloid CTLs are mainly expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as DCs and macrophages. APCs sense pathogens, internalize them by phagocytosis and present pathogen-derived peptides on MHC molecules to T cells, thereby initiating adaptive immune responses (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis 2016). Myeloid CTLs mainly belong to the groups II, V, and VI, according to the classification shown in Fig. 1. They can be further subdivided into two groups, type I or type II transmembrane receptors, which have their N-termini pointing outward or into the cytoplasm, respectively. While type I CTLs often carry a CTLD-containing multiple CRDs, type II CTLs comprise receptors with one single CRD (Figdor et al. 2002). Examples of type I CTLs include the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR), a tandem-repeat CTL, and mannose receptor 2 (also termed Endo-180), whereas other well-described CTLs such as dectin-1 and -2, the macrophage inducible CTL (Mincle), and the dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) belong to the type II CTLs (for details on these CTLs, see next sections). Pathogen recognition by myeloid CTLs often leads to internalization, whereupon antigens are processed and presented on MHC class-II molecules to CD4⁺ T cells and, through cross-presentation, on MHC class-I molecules to CD8⁺ T cells, respectively (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis 2016). In addition, CTL engagement by pathogen-derived ligands or self-ligands induces the expression of a diverse setup of downstream immune response genes (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis 2009). Finally, CTL-mediated signaling triggers various effector functions such as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus impacting subsequent T cell activation and polarization, and cross talk with other receptors such as TLRs (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis 2009; Kiefer and Lin 2012). Several CTLs signal via the Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a kinase that is well-known for its ability to couple immune cell receptors to intracellular signaling pathways, thus regulating cellular responses (Geahlen 2014). Syk phosphorylates tyrosine residues present in so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs

[ITAMs, consensus sequence: Yxx(L/I)₆₋₁₂ Yxx(L/I)] or inhibition motifs (ITIMs, S/I/V/LxYxxI/V/L) in the cytoplasmic tail of CTLs (Fig. 3) (Kerrigan and Brown 2011). As also shown in Fig. 3, other CLRs use the ITAM-bearing Fc receptor γ (FcRγ) chain as recruitment site for Syk (Underhill and Goodridge 2007). Alternatively, a single YxxL motif in the cytoplasmic tail of some CTLs, termed hemITAM, enables direct binding of Syk without involvement of an additional adaptor protein (Robinson et al. 2006; Osorio and Reis e Sousa 2011). As a consequence, Syk substrates and Syk itself are phosphorylated, thus initiating the assembly of a ternary protein complex consisting of the caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9), B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10), and the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT-1). As shown in Fig. 4, formation of the CARD9/Bcl10/MALT-1 complex finally leads to activation of transcription factors such as NFκB, NFAT, or AP-1 (Osorio and Reis e Sousa 2011). Thus, engagement of ITAM-coupled CTLs, such as dectin-2 or Mincle, and hemITAM-coupled CTLs, such as dectin-1, generally conveys activating signals into the cell. In contrast, ITIM-carrying CTLs, such as the dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR) (Kanazawa 2007) or the myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor (MICL) (Marshall et al. 2004) usually transmit inhibitory signals, thus dampening cellular functions (Fig. 3). Interestingly, there is also cross-talk between ITAM- and ITIM-dependent receptors highlighting the complexity of CTL-mediated signaling (Barrow and Trowsdale 2006; Robinson et al. 2006).

#### Pathogen sensing by CTLs

Microbes display a variety of PAMPs that are sensed by host PRRs. Through engagement of multiple CTLs by similar ligand structures on the one hand and the ability of one CTL to recognize different glycan ligands on the other hand, the immune system is able to react to a broad spectrum of pathogens (Lozach et al. 2007; Lugo-Villarino et al. 2011; Vautier et al. 2012; Klaver et al. 2013; Yabe et al. 2014). In the following, the review focuses on selected CTLs (dectin-1, dectin-2, Mincle, and DC-SIGN), and it presents examples on how these CTLs sense pathogens and contribute to immune defense against these pathogens (Fig. 4). A summary of the respective CTLs, their ligands, and their functions is presented in Table 1.

#### Dectin-1: a receptor recognizing β-1,3-glucans in fungi

CTLs have probably been studied most intensively in the context of fungal infections. One of the first discovered CTLs was dectin-1 that recognizes β-glucan, a main

Fig. 3 Myeloid C-type lectins and their signaling motifs. Upon CTL engagement, differential signaling pathways can be induced depending on the cytoplasmic signaling motif of each CTL. Activating signals are generally triggered by ITAM (YxxL–YxxL)- or hemITAM(LxxY)-coupled CTLs, whereas ITIM(V/LxxYxI/V)-bearing CTLs transmit inhibitory signals. Some CTLs have no intracellular signaling motifs and therefore act independently of ITAMs or ITIMs. ITAM immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, ITIM immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif.

component of the fungal cell wall. Dectin-1 is predominantly expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and DCs (Plato et al. 2013). Dectin-1 engagement by β-glucan leads to signaling via the Syk/CARD9 pathway and triggers a variety of cellular responses such as phagocytosis and the production of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-23 (Drummond and Brown 2013). In addition, dectin-1 is involved in Th17 and Th1 differentiation (Hardison and Brown 2012). *In vitro* studies using dectin-1 reporter cell lines as well as dectin-1−/− APCs showed that dectin-1 recognizes various fungal pathogens including *Pneumocystis carinii*, *Candida albicans*, *Aspergillus fumigatus*, and *Cryptococcus neoformans* (Fig. 4) (reviewed in Drummond and Brown 2011). Dectin-1-deficient mice infected with *P. carinii* and *C. albicans* were more susceptible to fungal infections compared to wild-type mice due to uncontrolled fungal growth (Saijo et al. 2007; Taylor et al. 2007). Consistently, a mutation in the *dectin-1* gene is associated with chronic mucosal candidiasis in humans (Ferwerda et al. 2009). These data illustrate an essential role for dectin-1 in fungal recognition and antifungal immune responses. Dectin-1−/− mice were found to be more susceptible to experimental colitis compared to wild-type control mice indicating that dectin-1 is involved in the recognition of intestinal fungi and contributes to gut homeostasis (Iliev et al. 2012). In addition, dectin-1 was reported to cross talk with TLR-2

Altered cytokine gene expression

Fig. 4 Pathogen recognition by myeloid C-type lectins. Myeloid CTLs recognize a variety of pathogens, such as bacteria, parasites, viruses, and fungi. Different signaling pathways are induced upon CTL engagement. One of the typical CTL signaling pathways is mediated by direct or indirect interaction of the kinase Syk with hemITAMs or ITAMs in the cytoplasmic tail of the respective CTL (shown here for dectin-1, dectin-2, and Mincle). Activation of Syk results in downstream signaling via the Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9)/B cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10)/

signaling. Simultaneous engagement of both receptors augmented the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-12 (Dennehy et al. 2008). Cross talk with other CTLs such as SIGNR1 in the context of fungal recognition has also been described for dectin-1 (Taylor et al. 2004).

### Dectin-2: a CTL recognizing α-mannan

Dectin-2 is a type II CTL that is associated with the ITAM-bearing FcRγ chain as adaptor molecule. This CTL is expressed by different cell subsets such as macrophages, DCs and, to a lesser extent, by Langerhans cells and monocytes (Taylor et al. 2005). Glycan array studies revealed

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1)-complex. Subsequently, transcription factors such as NFκB, NFAT, and AP-1 are activated and induce the expression of cytokine genes. Syk activation may also lead to the production of ROS, which induces inflammasome activation and subsequent production of IL-1β. However, CTL signaling can also be Syk-independent. DC-SIGN activates the Raf-1 kinase by different routes, finally leading to NFκB activation. For DC-SIGN, cross talk with TLR-mediated signaling has been shown

α-mannan as a ligand for dectin-2 that is present in fungi (Saijo et al. 2010). However, besides fungi such as *C. albicans* or *A. fumigatus*, dectin-2 recognizes other pathogens as well, for example helminths like *Schistosoma mansoni* that carry fucosylated glycans (Fig. 4) (Ritter et al. 2010; Kerscher et al. 2013; Mickum et al. 2016). A crucial role for dectin-2 in antifungal immunity was shown in different fungal infection models, including *C. albicans* and *C. glabrata* infection (Robinson et al. 2009; Saijo et al. 2010; Ifrim et al. 2014). Recently, it was described that dectin-2 binds to mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan, a major component of the cell wall of mycobacteria (Yonekawa et al. 2014). A recent study analyzed dectin-2 binding to several human pathogens such as *Hafnia alvei* and *Salmonella enterica* and

demonstrated that mannosylated O-antigens derived from these pathogens interact with dectin-2, thereby enhancing TLR-4-mediated responses (Wittmann et al. 2016).

### Mincle: a macrophage CTL with exogenous and endogenous ligands

Mincle is a type II transmembrane receptor expressed by human and mouse monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs (Richardson and Williams 2014). As for dectin-2, Mincle is associated with the ITAM-bearing FcRγ chain as adaptor molecule (Yamasaki et al. 2008). Upon Mincle engagement, the CARD9/Bcl10/MALT1 complex is assembled (Werninghaus et al. 2009) which finally leads to the production of chemokines and cytokines, T cell activation and CD4⁺ T cell differentiation into Th1 or Th17 effector T cell subsets (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis 2009). Although it is not yet completely understood how Mincle is able to bind to such a broad range of ligands, it has been clearly demonstrated that Mincle recognizes pathogen-derived ligands as well as endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) released by dead cells (Miyake et al. 2010). For instance, the spliceosome-associated protein 130 (SAP130) was shown to bind to Mincle and to activate Mincle-expressing cells (Yamasaki et al. 2008). In addition, Mincle plays a crucial role in antifungal and anti-mycobacterial immunity (Wells et al. 2008; Ishikawa et al. 2009; Yamasaki et al. 2009; da Glória Sousa et al. 2011). Mincle binds to mannose-containing glycoconjugates in *C. albicans*, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and *Malassezia*, thus inducing a strong pro-inflammatory response accompanied by TNF-α and IL-6 production (Yabe et al. 2014). Accordingly, Mincle-deficient mice were more susceptible to an infection with *C. albicans* compared to wild-type control mice supporting a critical role of Mincle in immunity against *C. albicans* infection in vitro and in vivo (Wells et al. 2008).

Among other components, the cell wall of mycobacteria is characterized by the presence of the glycolipid trehalose-6,6′-dimycolate (TDM, also termed cord factor) (Yabe et al. 2014). Mincle was shown to bind to various mycobacteria species such as *Mycobacterium smegmatis*, *M. bovis* and *M. tuberculosis* and was identified as the receptor for TDM (Ishikawa et al. 2009; Schoenen et al. 2010). Stimulation of macrophages with TDM and its synthetic analog trehalose-6,6′-dibehenate (TDB) led to Mincle up-regulation and induction of the Syk-CARD9 pathway (Schoenen et al. 2010). Besides mycobacteria, a role for Mincle in recognition of other bacteria species such as *Klebsiella pneumoniae* (Sharma et al. 2014), *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (Rabes et al. 2015), and *Helicobacter pylori* (Devi et al. 2015) has also been described. It was shown that Mincle forms a heterodimer with the CTL macrophage C-type lectin (MCL). Through this heterodimer formation, Mincle may serve as

bridge between MCL and the FcRγ chain, thus enabling
MCL-mediated signaling (Lobato-Pascual et al. 2013).

DC-SIGN: a human CTL recognizing a variety
of pathogens

DC-SIGN is a type II transmembrane receptor that is
mainly expressed by myeloid DCs, but also by dermal,
interstitial, and monocyte-derived DCs (Geijtenbeek et al.
2000c) and macrophages (Granelli-Piperno et al. 2005).
The CRD of DC-SIGN binds preferentially to high-mannose
and fucose-terminated glycan structures and Lewis-type
blood antigens in a Ca²⁺-dependent fashion (Švajger
et al. 2010). DC-SIGN was shown to act as a PRR, but it
also binds to endogenous ligands including the intercellular
adhesion molecules ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 (van Kooyk and
Geijtenbeek 2003). Thereby, DC-SIGN mediates binding
and trans-endothelial migration of DCs (Geijtenbeek et al.
2000a) and, through binding to ICAM-3, enables DC/T cell
clustering (Geijtenbeek et al. 2000c). Although the signaling
pathway initiated upon DC-SIGN engagement has not
yet been completely unraveled, it is known that the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 plays a central role in the intracellular
signaling cascade (Gringhuis et al. 2007). With regard
to its function as PRR, a range of pathogens were reported
to bind to DC-SIGN, including viruses, bacteria, parasites,
and fungi. Originally, DC-SIGN was identified as a receptor
for the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120 (Geijtenbeek et al.
2000b). It was shown that DC-SIGN is exploited by HIV-1
in that it captures and transmits HIV-1 to T cells (Geijtenbeek et al. 2000b), thus allowing the virus to escape antigen
processing. Upon HIV-1 uptake, virus particles are distributed
within DCs and assemble at the interface between DCs
and T cells (McDonald et al. 2003). Low viral amounts are
than transmitted to T cells thereby enabling trans-infection
of T cells (van Kooyk et al. 2004).

Numerous mycobacterial species such as *M. tuberculosis*
(Tailleux et al. 2003), *M. bovis* (Carroll et al. 2010), and
*M. leprae* (Barreiro et al. 2006) were shown to interact with
DC-SIGN. A study using *M. tuberculosis* showed that the
abundantly expressed mycobacterial cell wall component
mannosylated lipoarabinomannan is a DC-SIGN ligand
(Geijtenbeek et al. 2003). Furthermore, it was reported that
DC-SIGN differentially recognizes mycobacteria species
through their mannose caps present on the lipoarabinomannan (Maeda et al. 2003).

immune system to finally clear an infection. A wealth of
studies indicates that CTLs are not only involved in pathogen recognition and the induction of protective immune
responses, but may also modulate inflammatory processes
and maintain immune homeostasis. For instance, the MMR
acts as an endocytic receptor that recognizes mannose-terminated glycans on pathogens, but also on self-antigens. It
was shown that MMR-deficient mice exhibited an impaired
clearing of glycoproteins bearing accessible mannose and
N-acetylglucosamine residues indicating an important
function of the MMR in the regulation of serum glycoprotein homeostasis (Lee et al. 2002).

Necrotic and dead cells and their products such as heat-shock proteins and ribonucleoproteins are recognized by
CTLs. The CTL Mincle is activated in the presence of dead
cells through the release of the ribonucleoprotein component SAP130 which leads to pro-inflammatory cytokine
and chemokine production (Yamasaki et al. 2008). MICL
acts as a receptor for dead cells as well. Uric acid crystals
were identified as a ligand for human and mouse MICL that
serve as a danger signal for cell death-induced immunity
(Neumann et al. 2014). Consistently, MICL⁻/⁻ mice exhibited hyper-inflammatory responses after challenge with
uric acid crystals or dead cells (Neumann et al. 2014). This
study indicates that CTLs may fine-tune immune responses
to avoid overwhelming immune responses leading to
autoimmunity.

Another example is the inhibitory CTL DCIR that is
mainly expressed by DCs, monocytes, macrophages, B
cells, and neutrophils and was found to be overexpressed
in joints of mice during rheumatoid arthritis. It was shown
that aged DCIR-deficient mice spontaneously developed
autoimmune sialadenitis and enthesitis and that DCIR⁻/⁻
DCs displayed an increased proliferation and differentiation in vitro (Fujikado et al. 2008). These findings suggest that DCIR is involved in the maintenance of immune
homeostasis. However, depending on the context, DCIR
may not only down-regulate immune responses, but may
also have detrimental effects during inflammation. Interestingly, in a murine colitis model, DCIR⁻/⁻ mice exhibited
ameliorated symptoms compared to wild-type mice accompanied by reduced colonic inflammation (Tokieda et al.
2015). Another study showed that DCIR contributed positively to cerebral malaria development as demonstrated by
reduced brain inflammation, decreased TNF-α levels, and
modulated T cell activation in DCIR⁻/⁻ mice (Maglinao
et al. 2013).

Increasing evidence indicates that CTLs play an important role in gut homeostasis. In murine models of experimental colitis, the CTLs dectin-1 (Iliev et al. 2012), MCL,
DCIR (Hütter et al. 2014), and the specific intracellular
adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin homolog-related (SIGNR) 3, a murine ortholog of the human

CTLS in immune homeostasis

Immune responses to pathogens need to be tightly regulated to avoid overwhelming immune pathology, while
pathogen replication still has to be controlled by the

DC-SIGN (Eriksson et al. 2013; Lightfoot et al. 2015), were shown to recognize intestinal microbiota. Dectin-1$^{-/-}$ mice exhibited increased susceptibility to experimental colitis which was due to an altered response to commensal fungi (Iliev et al. 2012). Interestingly, a polymorphism in the *dectin-1* gene was detected in human patients with ulcerative colitis, providing further evidence for dectin-1 as a key player in gut homeostasis (Iliev et al. 2012). Notably, the functions of CTLs in immune homeostasis in the gut may be ambivalent: While deficiency for the macrophage galactose-type CTL 1 (MGL-1) led to more severe colitis in mice (Saba et al. 2009), mice lacking SIGNR-1 exhibited an ameliorated course of colitis (Saunders et al. 2010).

### CTL targeting to modulate immune responses

While antibody-mediated CTL targeting has been the preferred strategy for a long time, recent studies highlight the utility for glycan-based CTL targeting as a promising alternative (van Kooyk et al. 2013). Advantages of the multivalent glycan display are, for example, the possibility to vary ligand density and to modify the spatial orientation of ligands (Johannssen and Lepenies 2017). In addition, different glycan ligands can be presented on the same carrier which allows for targeting multiple CTLs simultaneously. A major focus in glycan-based CTL targeting has been on DC-SIGN, particularly due to its expression in a tetrameric fashion that favors multivalent targeting approaches. As shown in Fig. 5, a variety of carriers has been employed for the multivalent display of glycan ligands, including

Fig. 5 Targeting of C-type lectins using multivalent ligand display. Multivalent ligand presentation is a promising strategy for targeting CTLs. As CTL engagement influences intracellular signaling pathways, cell-specific drug delivery, but also the modulation of cellular functions may be mediated by CTL targeting. Numerous carrier systems were employed for targeting the CTL DC-SIGN, such as galactofuranose-coated gold nanoparticles (Chiodo et al. 2014), glycoliposomes carrying Lewis-b ($\text{Le}^b$) and Lewis-x ($\text{Le}^x$) glycans (Unger et al. 2012), or mannose-capped glyco-dendri-nanoparticles (Ribeiro-Viana et al. 2012)

glycan-modified antigens, glyconanoparticles, glycoliposomes, or glycodendrimers. Tumor antigens modified with glycan ligands for DC-SIGN were successfully employed for DC-SIGN targeting and led to enhanced anti-tumor responses (Aarnoudse et al. 2008). Gold glyconanoparticles displaying oligomannosides of the high-mannose HIV undecasaccharide Man₉GlcNAc₂ were shown to bind to DC-SIGN and efficiently inhibited DC-SIGN-mediated HIV trans-infection of T cells (Martínez-Ávila et al. 2009; Arnáiz et al. 2012). In a recent study, galactofuranose-coated gold nanoparticles were employed for DC-SIGN targeting (Fig. 5). Indeed, these particles exhibited binding to DC-SIGN and induced pro-inflammatory responses in monocyte-derived DCs (Chiodo et al. 2014). Furthermore, glycodendrimers were used for DC-SIGN targeting (Wang et al. 2008; García-Vallejo et al. 2013). A recent approach involved the generation of nested layers of multivalency by the preparation of mannose-capped glyco-dendri-protein-nanoparticles, thus enabling the display of up to 1620 glycans (Fig. 5) (Ribeiro-Viana et al. 2012). Liposomes modified with the DC-SIGN ligands Leᵇ or Leˣ were used for antigen targeting to DCs. Indeed, T cell priming was increased upon DC targeting with these glycoliposomes (Fig. 5) (Unger et al. 2012). The examples mentioned here highlight the utility of glycan-based CTL targeting. Further studies are needed to optimize ligand display on the carriers to increase the CTL targeting specificity.

### Concluding remarks

CTLs represent a large lectin superfamily with highly diverse functions in cells. In innate immunity, CTLs play crucial roles in pathogen recognition, but also in the regulation of immune responses. Further studies are needed to identify novel CTL ligands on pathogens, self-antigens, and in glycan libraries. To this end, CTLs have been used as tools in glycan/lectin arrays and in histochemistry to identify CTL ligands (Roth 2011; André et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2017). Comparative approaches using CTL libraries are useful to determine CTL binding profiles to pathogen collections or glycan libraries (Maglinao et al. 2014; Brzezicka et al. 2016). Despite major progress, still little is known about the role of CTLs in immunity during infections and autoimmune diseases. A focus should be on the cross talk of CTLs with other receptors in innate immunity, such as TLRs, and how interference with CTL signaling may modulate immune responses during infections and inflammation. To this end, multivalent CTL ligand display using nanocarrier systems may be a promising strategy. Such approaches may finally lead to novel immune therapies against infections, autoimmune diseases, or cancer.
