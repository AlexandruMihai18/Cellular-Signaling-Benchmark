Human primary immunodeficiency diseases: a perspective

Alain Fischer

Primary immunodeficiency diseases consist of a group of more than 100 inherited conditions, mostly monogenic, predisposing individuals to different sets of infections, allergy, autoimmunity and cancer. Primary immunodeficiencies therefore represent exquisite models of various immunopathological settings. The identification of the associated genes, 100 so far, has generated a plethora of information about the immune system and spurred the analysis of many aspects of the development, function and regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. These findings can potentially contribute to improved care of affected individuals by providing new diagnostic and/or therapeutic tools.

Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) represent a formidable challenge for both clinicians and scientists, because more than 100 described immunodeficiencies exist<sup>1–3</sup>, which can lead to defects in any aspect of the immune response. Clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from various patterns of microbial susceptibility to allergy, lymphoproliferation or autoimmune manifestations. Diagnostic procedures thus proceed along a kind of continuously revised algorithm. Conversely, refined phenotypic analysis, as pioneered 50 years ago by Janeway and Good<sup>4,5</sup>, provides a process by which PID studies nurture new avenues in immunological research.

In many cases, inherited diseases have led to the identification of new genes that are crucial in immune cell development or effector function or that contribute to homeostatic mechanisms that keep the immune system in check to prevent overt autoimmune disease. By using tools developed to study the human genome, approximately 100 genes associated with PIDs have been identified so far. In the last year alone, immunodeficiencies associated with mutations of 13 different genes have been identified (Table 1)<sup>6–19</sup>. This information not only provides basic clues as to how the immune system functions but also has important medical implications for diagnosis, genetic counseling, prognosis definition and the potential therapeutic intervention strategies that can be attempted in affected patients. This review focuses on some immunological insights provided by the correlation of genotype and phenotype in newly recognized human immunodeficiency syndromes.

### Primary immunodeficiencies affecting B cell development

Multiple examples exist in which primary immunodeficiency arises when B cell development is arrested at the pre-B stage<sup>20</sup>. Mutations that prevent signaling through the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) result in a lack of mature B cells and, thus, an inability to produce serum immunoglobulins. Deficiencies in either μ heavy chain, the λ5 component of the pre-BCR surrogate light chain, the coreceptor immunoglobulin α (Igα) or downstream signaling components, such as the adaptor BLNK (also known as SLP-65) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), all lead to a profound block at the pre-B cell stage (Fig. 1).

Recently, the study of a phenotype called hyper-IgM (HIGM) syndrome, characterized by defective immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR) and thus very low serum concentrations of IgG, IgA and IgE, attracted much attention and provided unexpected findings<sup>21</sup>. CSR requires T cell–B cell collaboration in response to cognate antigen recognition. It was first shown unequivocally in 1993 that CD40 ligand (CD154) is required to drive germinal center formation,

REVIEW

![Diagram](#)

loss-of-function recessive mutations of UNG strongly argue in favor of a direct DNA (dC)-deaminating function of AID<sup>13</sup>.

Thus, AID seems to be a 'master protein', initiating CSR and SHM. However, its DNA substrates and the DNA-repair mechanism involved in CSR and SHM differ (Fig. 2). Here again, study of HIGM phenotypes provides new insights, as a few mutants of AID were unexpectedly found to be associated with a nearly normal frequency of B cell SHM generation, whereas CSR was profoundly impaired<sup>33</sup>. The three human mutations associated with this unique phenotype lacked the 8–17 C-terminal residues of AID. Similarly, Barreto *et al.* found that an artificial AID deletion mutant missing the last 10 C-terminal residues shows the same functional characteristics<sup>34</sup>. These mutants are all able to deaminate DNA *in vitro*. Thus, the AID C terminus seems to be required in CSR but not in SHM, either by binding to a cofactor involved in DNA repair or recognizing a specific conformation of the DNA switch (S) region (Fig. 2). One such mutation, identified in a heterozygous individual, seems to be dominant to the wild-type allele, indicating that AID could form multimeric complexes<sup>33</sup>. In addition, a new subset of B cell-intrinsic defects was identified in HIGM4 patients with normal AICDA and UNG and was characterized by a selective CSR deficiency but normal SHM frequency and pattern<sup>35</sup>. AID-dependent S<sub>μ</sub> region-specific double-strand breaks can occur in B cells from HIGM4 patients, probably placing the defect in the DNA-repair pathway involved in joining broken ends of S<sub>μ</sub> and the downstream switch region (S<sub>x</sub>; Fig. 2). It can be inferred that an element (or several, as it is not known at present whether HIGM4 is genetically heterogeneous or not) specific to CSR is defective. The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is involved in the repair of CSR-associated double-strand breaks, but not of SHM-associated DNA breaks<sup>36</sup>. However, a defect in NHEJ is unlikely to account for HIGM4, as NHEJ is necessary for the V(D)J recombination process of both T and B cell receptor genes, whereas T cells in HIGM4 patients are normal in both number and function<sup>36</sup>. Thus, the description of HIGM4 leads to the postulation of the existence of CSR-specific protein(s) directly involved in DNA repair or indirectly as a synapsis factor between broken S ends<sup>37</sup>. In any case, studies based on this finding will contribute to a further understanding of the complex CSR machinery and mechanism.

Thus, four closely related but distinct HIGM conditions exist. All are characterized by a profound CSR deficiency but are associated with no generation of SHM (AID deficiency), a biased pattern (UNG deficiency) or preserved SHM (C-terminal mutation of AID or HIGM4). An in-depth comparison of patients' patterns of infections could elucidate whether affinity maturation of IgM-secreting cells has an important function in mediating immune responses and memory against infectious agents (Fig. 1). This question could also be extended to the function of unmutated IgM by comparison with B cell-negative agammaglobulinemic patients<sup>20</sup> (Fig. 1). Examination of the history of patients' antibody production and/or profiles after documented infections could shed insight. Microbial challenges of relevant mouse models (for example, Aicda<sup>-/-</sup>, AID C-terminal deletions, Ung<sup>-/-</sup> and H2afx<sup>-/-</sup>)<sup>38,39</sup> could also address this question. Harada *et al.* have shown that Aicda<sup>-/-</sup> and Aicda<sup>+/-</sup> mice survive equally well, although

with a distinct morbidity to influenza virus infection, indicating that the unmutated IgM antibodies specific to the influenza virus (detected in Aicda⁻/⁻ mice) do contribute to viral clearance⁴⁰.

### PID as models for the study of infectious immunity

Susceptibility to infections is the hallmark of PIDs. PIDs that impair different cell types or molecules have distinct consequences in determining infection profiles. Thus, the species of infecting microorganism, site of infection and clinical outcome can all vary substantially. The main utility of using natural models despite their obvious limitations is that they provide the 'real-life' consequences of known molecular defects compared with artificial challenges presented to immunodeficient mice. Two examples discussed below demonstrate the complexity of the immune response to natural infection with papilloma virus and *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.

#### Susceptibility to papilloma virus

Papilloma viruses (PVs) are double-stranded DNA viruses with a tropism to epithelia. These viruses are nonlytic and cause chronic skin and mucosal infection (warts and condyloma). Some of these, as a function of PV species, constitute premalignant lesions of the anogenital tract and the skin. PV infection is still fairly enigmatic, and its control by immunocompetent individuals is far from predictable. PVs have developed many immune evasion strategies that can account for this observation (reviewed in ref. 41). PV is shed only in desquamative keratinocytes, thus limiting the number of cell-free virus particles found in epithelia. A limited amount of PV protein is available to dendritic cells, as PV protein expression is low; capsid proteins are expressed only late in infection in differentiated keratinocytes, whereas 'early proteins' exert inhibitory activities on antigen presentation as well as on innate immune responses. Also, epidermal dendritic cells (Langerhans cells) have little involvement in inducing T cell responses to a skin herpes simplex virus infection, whereas dermal dendritic cells, which are more physically remote from PV-infected keratinocytes, do so⁴². This scenario leads to a form of global 'ignorance' of PV-infected cells by the immune system⁴³. Nevertheless, there is much evidence of efficient immune responses against PV. Chronic warts and relapses are more frequent in immunosuppressed patients. T cell infiltration of spontaneously regressive warts and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responsiveness has been documented. Topical drugs of the imidazoquinoline family, which bind Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), show activity against warts⁴⁴.

Recent findings identifying genetic factors that predispose to infection to PVs could lead to a much better understanding of how PVs resist both adaptive and innate immune responses. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive inherited condition characterized by chronic skin lesions caused by certain PV strains. Some of these can ultimately lead to malignancy. These patients are not prone to infectious diseases caused by other microorganisms, making this condition a rare but useful example of genetically determined susceptibility to a given pathogen. Descriptions of immune responses have not been very detailed in the few patients with EV. Nevertheless, it is possible that they develop a form of T cell anergy or 'ignorance' to PV⁴⁵. Loss-of-function mutations of either of two adjacent genes called *EVER1* and *EVER2* are associated with EV in four families¹⁸. The encoded proteins have multiple transmembrane domains and are found in the endoplasmic reticulum of both lymphocytes and keratinocytes¹⁸. This finding is fascinating, but the mechanism of how and in which cells the EVER1 and EVER2 proteins exert their activity against PV (for example, local immunity or recruitment of T cells) remains unknown.

### Figure 2 Immunoglobulin CSR and SHM: insight from the study of HIGM syndromes. Both immunoglobulin CSR and SHM are initiated by germline transcription of the relevant DNA region (through the target S region and V(D)J exon, respectively). CD40 activation leads to induction of AID expression. AID targets nontemplate single-stranded (ss)DNA. AID is thought to deaminate cytosine into uracil on ssDNA, leading to ssDNA break formation, after uracil removal by UNG. The SHM process is less well known. Error-prone repair of ssDNA breaks leads to point mutations transversions or transitions, whereas replication can lead to transitions at uracil sites. Repair of Sμ region and Sx broken ends involves the NHEJ pathway as well as mismatch repaired factors. Ovals indicate molecular or functional insight provided by HIGM study. The HIGM4-associated defect (to be determined) will probably contribute to the elucidation of the repair pathway involved in CSR (ds). ds, double strand.

Another rare condition called WHIM (an acronym for warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis, a form of neutropenia), inherited as autosomal dominant trait, predisposes to chronic PV disease, consisting of severe skin and cervical warts⁴⁶. Unlike in EV, however, susceptibility to infectious diseases is more complex and multifactorial, as these patients are prone to recurrent infections, including severe infections by the Epstein-Barr virus⁴⁷. The finding that this condition is caused by mutations of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 should elucidate how the immune system fights PV infection¹⁹. Affected individuals have mutations that variably truncate the cytoplasmic tail domain of CXCR4. CXCR4 is expressed by myeloid cells, B cells and T cells (especially naive T cells), as well as by neurons. It is suspected that WHIM mutations lead to gain of function, as indicated by increased calcium flux in WHIM lymphocytes compared with that of controls, in response to CXCL12 (also known as SDF-1), the CXCR4 ligand¹⁹. As antigen-specific cellular responses are impaired in patients with WHIM, one hypothesis is that defective T cell responses predispose to chronic PV disease. Abnormal migration of T cells toward the infected epithelia might be a relevant mechanism underlying this defect. That PV disease is much more prominent in WHIM than in other virus-associated diseases nevertheless points to a rather specific function of this chemoattractant receptor in anti-PV immunity. It is likely that further studies of models of chronic PV infections will

Two other primary immunodeficiencies that cause susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial pathogens have been characterized recently: X-linked anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (XL-EDA-ID), caused by hypomorphic mutations of IKBK, encoding IKKγ (also called NEMO, for NF-κB essential modulator)⁵⁰⁻⁵²; and IRAK-4 deficiency⁹⁻¹⁰. Both are potential prototypic examples of innate immunity defects. Indeed, IKKγ is an essential positive regulator of one main pathway of NF-κB activation. The IkB kinase (IKK complex), consisting of two catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ proteins) associated with the regulatory subunit IKKγ, phosphorylates NF-κB inhibitors (IkB), thus enabling NF-κB complexes to migrate to the nucleus, where they can activate gene transcription⁵³. NF-κB mediates many cellular immune responses, including inflammatory reactions induced by proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins 1 and 18 or tumor necrosis factor, as well as by microbial products that bind TLRs. IRAK-4 is a kinase involved in one of the activation pathways mediated by the binding of interleukin 1 to its receptor, as well as by some TLR-ligand interactions, such as the binding of lipopolysaccharide to TLR4 (ref. 54). After a ligand binds to its receptor, the MyD88 and Mal (also known as TIRAP) adaptor proteins are recruited to the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail, where they then attract IRAK molecules (including IRAK1 and IRAK4). IRAK4 can activate the adaptor TRAF6, leading to activation of MAP kinase and NF-κB⁵⁴.

Limited clinical and biological inflammatory reactions are often found in the context of severe infections caused by S. pneumoniae and other microorganisms in both IKKγ and IRAK-4 deficiencies. This finding fits well with the idea that these immunodeficiencies are the consequences of impaired responses to stimulation of innate immunity by bacterial products and proinflammatory cytokines. This situation, however, may not be as simple as in IKKγ deficiency, in which an antibody deficiency has also been documented⁵¹,⁵². Impairment of NF-κB in BCR- and CD40-mediated B cell activation and survival⁵⁵,⁵⁶ can account for the antibody deficiency. If so, NF-κB-dependent innate immunity is perhaps not involved mainly in defense against SPD. Despite the complexity of the NF-κB pathway⁵⁷, descriptions of new immunodeficiencies may further contribute to the elucidation of the respective functions of innate and adaptive responses in conferring protection against microbial infections, as recently shown by the finding of a T cell deficiency associated with a gain-of-function mutation of the NF-κB inhibitor IkBα¹⁶.

PID as models to immune system homeostasis

Genetically determined natural breaches in the homeostasis of the human system have attracted considerable interest. These deficiencies are much more numerous than previously thought. The molecular characterization of these defects is opening many new avenues and has raised unexpected questions. There are 18 identified monogenic diseases that disturb the immune system homeostasis of either innate⁵⁸ or adaptive immunity (Table 2). In this review, only the latter will be considered.

There are four clearly identified phenotypes associated with genetic defects of lymphocyte regulatory molecules (Table 2). These phenotypes are distinct from each other. Thus, careful analysis should tell us more about the regulatory pathways that control immune responses; for example, when, where and how these regulators act.

Defects in lymphocyte cytotoxicity

T cell– and natural killer (NK) cell–mediated cytotoxic activities are key effectors of antiviral and tumor immunity. Cytolytic granules contain the molecular effectors of cytotoxicity, which can be divided into two pathways: the perforin-dependent secretory pathway and the Fas-Fas ligand pathway. The former induces target cell death after secretion and endocytosis of death products by target cells<sup>59</sup>; the latter as expressed on plasma cell membranes triggers, in permissive cells, caspase-mediated cell death<sup>60</sup>. Genetic defects of both pathways are known, leading to completely distinct phenotypes, as discussed below.

At least four molecularly defined diseases, which include familial lymphohistiocytosis (FHL2 and 3), Griscelli syndrome and Chediak-Higashi syndrome, share a defect in T and NK perforin-dependent cytolytic responses and a phenotype called hemophagocytic syndrome, in which activated macrophages engulf blood cells<sup>61,62</sup>.

Defective cytotoxicity is caused either by a perforin deficiency<sup>63</sup> or by an inability of the secretory cytolytic granules to undergo exocytosis<sup>17,64,65</sup>. A defect in granule docking has been described in Griscelli syndrome, caused by RAB27A deficiency<sup>64</sup>. Rab27 is a small GTP-binding protein associated with cytolytic granules. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is associated with a deficiency in LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator), a cytolytic protein involved in granule fission<sup>65,66</sup>. The gene encoding LYST is the ortholog of the gene responsible for the mouse Beige mutant. What do these findings teach us? Whatever the mechanism by which perforin-dependent cytolysis is impaired, it results in unremitting CD8 (and CD4) T cell expansion and activation, despite the preserved ability of these T cells to undergo antigen-induced cell death<sup>67</sup>. Thus, cytolysis is important in T lymphocyte homeostasis after an antigenic challenge. It is well known that antigen stimulation, particularly viral infection, triggers massive CD8 T cell population expansion<sup>68</sup> followed by a programmed contraction<sup>69</sup>. It has been proposed that clearance of antigen-presenting cells, with or without associated cytokine withdrawal, causes substantial T cell population contraction<sup>68</sup>. However, these data do not fit with the antigen-presenting cell–independent fatal CD8 T cell population expansion in perforin-deficient mice when infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus<sup>70</sup>. These data strongly indicate that there is involvement of ‘fratricide’ killing in mediating the contraction phase. The *in vitro* observation of target cell membrane acquisition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes could account for fratricide killing induced by exposure to exogenous antigen–major histocompatibility complex class I complexes<sup>71,72</sup>. *In vivo* occurrences would fit with the observation of a dominant activity of normal CD8 T cells over mutant CD8 T cells in bone marrow–transplanted patients with an inherited hemophagocytic syndrome as a mechanism of killing in *trans* (fratricide) instead of *cis* (suicide)<sup>73</sup>. Thus, injection of gene-corrected peripheral T cells could potentially be a therapeutic option.

The apparent absence of autoimmune manifestations in defects associated with cytolytic granules contrasts with what is seen in patients (and mice) defective in the second cytolytic pathway mediated by the membrane receptor Fas<sup>74–76</sup>. This condition, called autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, associates polyclonal T and B cell proliferation and accumulation of T cell receptor αβ CD4−CD8− mature T cells with a possible ‘anergic’ phenotype and variable autoimmune manifestations. The latter is most frequently autoantibody mediated and directed against blood cells. Impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis caused by mutations in the gene encoding Fas1 (*TNFRSF6*)<sup>74,75</sup> and by mutations in the gene encoding caspase 10 (*CASP10*) in rare cases<sup>76</sup> or by an unknown genetic defect accounts for this phenotype. The magnitude of lymphoproliferation as well as the severity and localization of autoimmune manifestations seem to be under the control of as-yet-unknown modifier genes.

### Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome

Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis ectodermal dysplasia (APECED) is characterized by the variable occurrence of T cell– and B cell–mediated autoimmune disease targeting various endocrine glands (parathyroid, thyroid, adrenal glands, gonads, pancreas, liver, skin and erythrocytes) and is associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and ectodermal dysplasia<sup>79</sup>. It is a mendelian disease with autosomal recessive inheritance. Loss-of-function mutations in AIRE (autoimmune regulator gene) cause this disease<sup>80</sup>. A similar phenotype is noted in *Aire*<sup>−/−</sup> mice<sup>81,82</sup>. Considerable interest was sparked by the fact that Aire is expressed mainly in medullary thymic epithelial cells and that it encodes a protein with DNA-binding activity and gene transactivation capacity<sup>82</sup>. Recently, elegant experiments have demonstrated that Aire actually regulates the ectopic expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells of tissue-specific proteins normally

found in terminally differentially organs, such as preproinsulin and zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ref. 82). These results strongly indicate that Aire expression is key in central tolerance to a set of self proteins, although the mechanism by which Aire triggers their gene expression is still unknown. It has been suggested that induction of regulatory T cells could mediate this central tolerance. However, this hypothesis does not fit with the very different phenotype of FOXP3 deficiency, a condition called immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX), which causes a loss of regulatory T cells (discussed below), compared with that of APECED<sup>83</sup>. This idea is confirmed by the finding that Aire-dependent tolerance to pancreas-specific antigen is caused by deletion of self-reactive T cells in the thymus without a detectable change in the number of regulatory T cells<sup>84</sup> (Fig. 3). Three additional conclusions can be drawn from these remarkable studies that bridge human autoimmune diseases to mouse models. A defect in central T cell tolerance is accompanied by B cell-mediated autoimmunity, indicating that preserved central B cell tolerance is not sufficient to control potential antibody-mediated autoimmunity. Moreover, Aire does not control the entire set of ectopically expressed antigens in the thymus; thus it is likely that other similar factors exist. Searches for other inherited human conditions characterized by the occurrence of autoimmune manifestations in childhood could therefore be very helpful, as the study of APECED has been. Finally, Aire expression is controlled by local production of lymphotoxin by thymocytes<sup>85</sup>, indicating a regulatory mechanism by which activated self-reactive T cells in the thymus will induce higher Aire expression through lymphotoxin production. This hypothesis offers a potential mechanism to explain one of the most salient immunodeficiency phenotypes, known as the Omenn syndrome. This disease is characterized by early onset oligoclonal T cell infiltration of skin, gut and other organs. This phenotype is associated with hypomorphic mutations of recombination activation genes 1 and 2 (ref. 86). What triggers the apparent activation of these autoimmune T cell clones remains obscure. It could now be proposed that because T cells with productive T cell receptor rearrangements in the thymus are infrequent, ensuing low lymphotoxin production results in little or no upregulation in Aire expression, so that the very few self-reactive T cells escape negative selection and expand their populations in the periphery. This hypothesis can now be tested.

### IPEX

The IPEX syndrome is a multisystemic autoimmune disease with an early onset and an often fatal outcome<sup>83</sup>. Severe enteropathy with diffuse and massive T cell infiltration and mucosal destruction variably associated with diabetes, eczema and autoimmunity to blood cells are hallmarks of this condition. Loss-of-function mutations in *FOXP3* are causal<sup>87,88</sup>. *FOXP3* encodes a DNA-binding protein of the forkhead family with a winged-helix domain. It is expressed mainly by a subset of regulatory CD4 T cells that also express CD25<sup>89</sup>. There is a similar natural mutant in mice: the scurfy mice<sup>90</sup>. As Foxp3 expression is essential for regulatory T cell induction<sup>89,91,92</sup>, this phenotype seems to be the consequence of a deficiency in regulatory T cells. The dominance of normal over mutated cells in obligate carriers and after bone marrow transplantation, respectively, resulting in a mixed chimerism<sup>93–94</sup>, fits with this idea. As described above, the IPEX phenotype differs from that of APECED. These differences demonstrate the nonredundancy of the mechanism controlling autoimmune clones. They also could be related to the broader function of regulatory T cells, which control not only autoimmunity but also T cell responses to exogenous antigens. Gut disease might be triggered in part by microbial flora stimulation after birth. Nevertheless, the observation that the apparently preserved regulatory T cell compartment in AIRE deficiency does not maintain control of self-reactive T cell clones that escaped from central negative selection deserves further examination. Perhaps in the periphery, regulatory T cells cannot efficiently face a continuous flow of incoming self-reactive T cell clones. More generally, a reassessment of the diverse mediators of lymphocyte homeostasis is needed<sup>95</sup>. Natural models are likely to provide more clues to this complexity.

#### Is this the end of the study of inherited immunodeficiencies?

This question can be raised, as the molecular basis of many known PIDs has been discovered. Many facts indicate the opposite is true. Major immunodeficiency phenotypes have yet to be defined in molecular terms, such as the probably heterogeneous group of common variable immunodeficiency or the hyper-IgE syndrome. Identical phenotypes can be found with many possible genetic defects, as demonstrated by susceptibility to mycobacterial infections<sup>96</sup>, HIGM syndrome or immunodeficiency related to V(D)J recombination defects<sup>97</sup>. Mutation polymorphism of a given gene (loss-of-function versus gain-of-function) is also of interest, as shown in humans<sup>16,98</sup> and mice<sup>99</sup>. Conversely, modifier genes probably intervene, as has been demonstrated for chronic granulomatous diseases<sup>100</sup> and is suspected for X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Identification of modifier genes is of obvious value for both basic and medical purposes. The technology of DNA microarray is likely to provide important information. These ‘experiments of nature’ will continue to provide useful insights, complementing experimental approaches including the powerful generation of more mutants by targeted mutagenesis in the mouse<sup>101</sup>.

Finally, the human immunodeficiencies that have not yet been described can also, by default, be instructive. For instance, the phenotype of a deficiency in NK cell-activating receptors and adaptor DAP-12/KARAP (as well as a deficiency in TREM2) is salient. It consists of a bone and brain disease caused by defective osteoclasts and microglia (polycystic lipomembranous, osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy) but not a NK cell function deficiency<sup>102</sup>. Among many examples available, no deficiencies in TLR receptors (though polymorphisms were found associated to bacterial infections) or regulatory receptors like CTLA-4 have been found so far. Also, no clear-cut selective NK cell deficiency has been described. Early lethality but also redundancy, interspecies differences or misconceptions can be envisaged. These observations could stimulate the emergence of new ideas.
