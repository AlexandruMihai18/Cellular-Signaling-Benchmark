Salmonella is one of the most successful bacterial pathogens that infect humans in both developed and developing countries. In order to cause infection, Salmonella uses type III secretion systems to inject bacterial effector proteins into host cells. In the age of antibiotic resistance, researchers have been looking for new strategies to reduce Salmonella infection. To understand infection and to analyze type III secretion as a potential therapeutic target, research has focused on identification of effectors, characterization of effector functions and how they contribute to disease. Many effector-mediated processes have been identified that contribute to infection but thus far no specific treatment has been found. In this perspective we discuss our current understanding of effector-mediated processes and discuss new techniques and approaches that may help us to find a solution to this worldwide problem.

Many prevalent infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic bacteria that deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells using a type III secretion system (T3SS) [1–4]. Through the combined activity of these effectors, pathogens are able to alter host cell functions to enable infection, survival, replication and eventually transmission [1,4]. A well-studied example of a bacterial pathogen that uses T3SS is the intracellular Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella. Since a variety of classical and molecular genetic tools exist for the identification and characterization of Salmonella virulence genes, this pathogen is widely used as a model for bacterial pathogenesis [5]. Additionally, the availability of *in vitro* tissue culture models and at least three different murine models enable the study of intricate interactions between the host and pathogen during various stages of infection [6].

Salmonellae infect humans and cause an estimated 1.3 billion infections per year, ranging from gastroenteritis to typhoid fever, a potentially fatal systemic infection [5,7]. One of the most common Salmonella species to infect humans is *Salmonella enterica*, which is typically acquired through ingestion of contaminated food or water [8]. *S. enterica* has many serovars, including *S. enterica* Typhimurium, from which most of our current understanding comes from. *S.* Typhimurium can infect a wide variety of different hosts, causing a self-limiting gastroenteritis in healthy humans and a fatal typhoid-like disease in mice. Once *S.* Typhimurium enters the GI tract, it is able to invade microfold cells or it can be phagocytosed by dendritic cells [9].

After reaching the epithelial layer, it induces an inflammatory response, resulting in IL-8 secretion and stimulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) migration across the intestinal epithelium [10,11]. Both the ability to invade non-phagocytic cells and the ability to survive and replicate inside the host cell are essential aspects of *S.* Typhimurium infection.

*S.* Typhimurium can enter epithelial cells by ‘active’ remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton leading to the formation of membrane ruffles or through ‘passive’ uptake by immune cells with phagocytic properties [7,12]. The mechanisms by which uptake is facilitated have a dramatic impact on the further development of infection in the specific host cell [12]. After bacterial internalization *S.* Typhimurium resides in the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), where it creates a niche for survival and replication [13]. The SCV goes through different stages of maturation, all of which are associated with the presence of different sets of markers on the vacuole [14].

Overall, early SCV biogenesis (<30 min) is a process similar to maturation of nascent phagosomes, with *S.* Typhimurium controlling the abundance of various markers on the SCV [14]. Between 30 min and 5 h postinfection, the SCV moves to the perinuclear region of the host cell, where it positions in close proximity to the Golgi. The late stage of SCV development (>5 h) is characterized by the formation of Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs) [15]. SIFs are long tubules enriched in Lampl, and at approximately 8 h postinfection, these SIFs form stable networks that fuse with endocytic

vesicles. This fusion facilitates nutrient acquisition and is required for bacterial intracellular replication [16]. Throughout SCV biogenesis, the SCV membrane is enriched with cholesterol. Cholesterol is important for bacterial replication, since blocking cholesterol biosynthesis inhibits bacterial growth inside host cells [17]. The late stage of SCV maturation is also marked by vacuole-associated actin polymerization (VAP), a process involving the formation of F-actin around the SCV [18,19]. Inhibition of this process causes the release of bacteria into the cytosol [19].

All of these events result from the orchestrated activities of more than 30 effectors secreted by two T3SS [7]. Both T3SS-1 and T3SS-2 are associated with a set of effectors and are located in clusters on two *Salmonella* pathogenicity islands (SPI-1 and SPI-2, respectively) [20]. It is believed that SPI-1 and SPI-2 are acquired by horizontal gene transfer, and it is clear that both pathogenicity islands play a major role in the infection process [20,21]. Generally, SPI-1 effectors are secreted early in infection and are associated with bacterial internalization and early SCV biogenesis. T3SS-2 is induced in the lumen of the ileum and after bacterial internalization, and secreted SPI-2 effectors are mostly involved in late SCV maturation and intracellular survival [22–24]. Despite differences in temporal activation of the two T3SS, it has become clear that both systems have a much closer relationship than previously thought. This is highlighted by the finding that T3SS-2 is induced even before *S.* Typhimurium enters the cell [24], the existence of several effectors that are secreted by both T3SS [25], the requirement of both T3SS for intestinal inflammation *in vivo* [26] and by SPI-1 effectors that are present and active at late time-points postinfection [27].

Over the past two decades, research has focused on the identification of effectors and the characterization of their functions. The use of infection models with single deletion strains and mutants with distinct phenotypes led to the elucidation of some of the roles of effectors during infection [13,28,29]. Expression of single effectors in transiently transfected cells also resulted in characterization of specific effector roles [30]. The identification of host binding partners is another approach that has aided in the characterization of effector functions. Many host binding partners revealed important effector tasks and indicated targeted host signaling and immune pathways [31–33]. However, effectors exert their specific function in concert with other effectors and it is challenging to study effector functions

in the context of all others. A more systematic approach that combines new insights in effector dynamics, enzymatic activity, spatial segregation and identification of effector targets will likely help us to further unravel effector functions in order to gain a more complete understanding of the intricate process of *Salmonella* infection. In this perspective, we initially summarize our current understanding of effector-mediated processes during infection. The role of the different effectors is illustrated in FIGURES 1 & 2, and effector characteristics are shown in TABLE 1. In the second part of this perspective, we focus on new developments, with an emphasis on new systematic strategies that will further our understanding of effector-mediated *Salmonella* infection.

### Salmonella infection

Many important processes that occur during *Salmonella* infection are conducted by T3SS effectors. This is illustrated by the severe attenuation of *S.* Typhimurium mutants deficient in T3SS-1 and/or T3SS-2 secretion in murine and bovine models [34]. To summarize the current understanding of effector-mediated infection, we have divided the process into chronologically ordered events, starting with the induction of SPI-1 secretion. Many effectors have multiple functions and therefore will appear at several different time-points during infection.

### Regulation & induction of SPI-1 secretion

Changes in osmolarity, growth density, pH and aeration have all been proposed to induce T3SS-1 expression [35]. Several transcriptional regulators have been identified that activate HilA, which is the master regulator that drives transcription of T3SS-1 components and effectors [36]. The T3SS consists of an inner and outer membrane ring, a needle complex and the translocon pore through which effectors are translocated from the bacterial cytosol into the host cell. After assembly of the secretion system, intimate contact between bacteria and the host cell is required for the activation of T3SS-1 [37]. The formation of the translocon pore is required for intimate contact and effective secretion of T3SS-1 effectors. T3SS-1 effectors SipB, SipC and SipD, also known as translocases, are involved in the establishment of the bacterial-host cell connection. Each translocase is essential to facilitate injection of effector proteins, since *S.* Typhimurium mutant strains lacking any of the translocases are defective for intimate attachment and for translocation of all effector proteins [37]. SipD is present at the tip of the needle complex before

contact with host cells [37]. The binding of SipB to cholesterol is essential for the formation of the translocon, as cholesterol depletion has been shown to block effector translocation [38]. SipC binds Exo70, a component of the exocyst complex, which mediates docking and fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane. Exo70 is enriched at sites of bacterial attachment, suggesting that exocytic vesicles are targeted to sites of S. Typhimurium invasion [39].

**Nonphagocytic cellular invasion**

After the successful activation of T3SS-1, 11 effectors are known to be secreted into the host [40]. One of the most extensively studied processes in S. Typhimurium infection is its ability to invade nonphagocytic cells, of which the most studied examples are intestinal epithelial cells [41–43]. The combined action of five effectors (SipA, SipC, SopB, SopE and SopE2) is important for the induction of membrane ruffles and actin rearrangements leading to bacterial internalization [44]. SopE and SopE2 mimic the function of G-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), thereby activating Rho GTPases Rac-1 and Cdc42 and stimulating pathways that drive actin cytoskeletal assembly via Arp2/3 [44,45]. Another effector, SopB, an inositol phosphatase, activates the exchange factor RhoG through activation of the SH3-containing GEF that contributes to extensive actin remodeling [46]. A certain degree of redundancy of these three effectors is clearly shown by the fact that a single mutant is still invasive while mutants lacking all three effectors are defective in nonphagocytic invasion [47]. The two effectors SipA and SipC are involved in actin remodeling through direct binding of F-actin [48]. After binding, SipA bundles actin and promotes actin polymerization by decreasing the critical concentration of actin needed for actin assembly [7,11]. It also stabilizes actin filaments by enhancing the localized actin-bundling activity of T-plastin [44,49]. SipA works in concert with SipC, which also binds and bundles F-actin to facilitate the formation of actin filaments at the site of bacterial adhesion. Additionally, SipA and SipC work together to nucleate actin, and SipC prevents filament disassembly by host factors [25,50]. After bacterial engulfment, the host cytoskeleton returns to its resting state by the activity of effector SptP. This effector deactivates the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 by mimicking GAP, thereby reversing the cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by the SopE, SopE2 and SopB effectors [51].

**Generation of an inflammatory response**

Many effectors responsible for nonphagocytic cellular invasion are also involved in the induction of an inflammatory response. SopE activates Rac-1, and together SopE, SopB and SopE2 activate Cdc42 [45,52,53]. Activation of Rac-1 and Cdc42 induces MAPK signaling pathways that lead to the activation of AP-1 and NF-κB. The activation of these pathways results in the transcription and translation of proinflammatory cytokines [46,54]. The effectors SipA and SopA induce inflammation by triggering signal transduction cascades that stimulate PMN migration across the intestinal epithelium [10,11,55,56]. SipB induces inflammation by the binding and activation of caspase-1. Binding of caspase-1 leads to an increased production of IL-1β and IL-18 [25,57].

**Cell death regulation**

After induction of inflammation, *Salmonella* employs effectors that control and prevent the host cell from undergoing apoptosis [58]. Suppression of apoptosis may allow for the establishment of a stable intracellular niche inside the SCV. All effectors involved in cell death regulation inhibit NF-κB-dependent gene expression in a variety of ways. Effector SspH1 binds PKN1 to inhibit NF-κB-dependent gene expression [59], and AvrA contributes to host cell survival by the inhibition of JNK signaling [60]. In addition to reversing effects on actin rearrangement through its GAP activity, SptP works as a PTPase inactivating Raf1, which in turn downregulates MAPK signaling [61]. Effector SopB also activates Akt and thereby contributes to antiapoptotic signaling [62,63]. The phosphothreonine lyase SpvC is secreted by both T3SS and is found to inactivate MAPK through β-elimination. It also dephosphorylates ERK, leading to reduced mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines [64]. Finally, the SPI-2 effector SseL prevents the degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBa through its deubiquitinase activity, resulting in a decreased host inflammatory response [65].

By contrast, the E3 ubiquitin ligase SlrP promotes cell death by facilitating the ubiquitination of mammalian thioredoxin, thereby depleting thioredoxin levels in the host cell [66]. Depletion of thioredoxin makes a cell vulnerable to oxidative damage and can lead to apoptosis. SlrP also binds the human chaperone ERdj3, which is a protein that binds unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and targets them for proteasomal degradation. It has been postulated that by preventing the binding of unfolded proteins, SlrP may

lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that may eventually induce apoptosis [67]. SPI-2 effector SpvB exhibits a cytotoxic effect on infected cells and is required for delayed apoptosis following intracellular infection [68]. SpvB is an ADP ribosyl transferase, and deletion of SpvB results in attenuated virulence in the systemic mouse model [28].

### Early SCV biogenesis
Immediately after bacterial internalization, the SCV is formed and may function as a shelter for S. Typhimurium, preventing bacterial degradation and facilitating survival and replication [14]. The SCV undergoes different stages of maturation associated with the presence of different host cell markers. The early stage is mediated by SopB, which associates with vesicular membranes, where it recruits and activates Rab5 [7,14]. Rab5 in turn recruits the PI3K Vps34 that phosphorylates PI into PI(3)P. Generation of PI(3)P is necessary for the recruitment of EEA1, VAMP8 and Lampl [14]. The early SCV fuses with vesicles containing VAMP8 and PI(3)P. These vesicles most likely contain nutrients required for growth and replication of the bacteria within the SVC [69,70]. In addition, SopB enhances invasion by cleaving PI(4,5)P2 to promote membrane elasticity and vacuole formation. SopB recruits SNX-1, which contributes to the disappearance of late lysosomal markers on the SCV and inhibits the degradation of EGF receptors by lysosomes [7,71]. SopD and SipC act in concert with SopB during initial formation of the phagosome [14,72]. SopD plays a role in membrane fission and macropinosome formation [72], while SipC causes enhanced invasion through clustering of PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane [71]. Other effectors associated with SCV biogenesis and maturation are SopA and SptP [73]. The HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase SopA is associated with an increase in escape from the SCV, but the significance of this activity is unclear [55]. After formation of the SCV, the effector SptP associates with the SCV, where its PTPase activity increases pathogen replication [51]. Direct SptP binding and specific dephosphorylation of host VCP, a facilitator of cellular membrane fusion and protein degradation, enhances bacterial replication in the SCV [51].

### Regulation & initiation of SPI-2 secretion
After establishment of the SCV, the T3SS-2 is induced and secretion of SPI-2 effectors is facilitated. Recently, it became apparent that the acidification of the SCV through the actions of Toll-like receptors is essential for Salmonella virulence since defective acidification results in the lack of expression and secretion of SPI-2 effectors [74]. After acidification, several regulators activate the kinase SsrA, which is part of a two-component system with the transcriptional regulator SsrB. The transcription factor SsrB can bind and activate all promoters of the SPI-2 operons, leading to expression of SPI-2 effectors [75]. Similar to the T3SS-1, the T3SS-2 also requires the formation of a translocon, which is formed by SseB, SseC

and SseD. All three translocases are required for the secretion of SPI-2 effector proteins [76]. The contributions of individual SPI-2 effectors are not as well characterized as those of SPI-1 effectors, mainly owing to redundancy in function. Single deletions of SPI-2 effectors often have no effect on *Salmonella* virulence or are a minor phenotype [28]. Disruption of the complete T3SS-2 secretion shows, however, that this system is highly involved in intracellular survival and replication in macrophages, as well as virulence [28,73].

### Positioning & maturation of the SCV

After formation of the SCV, the vacuole moves to the perinuclear region of the host cell in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus. This position seems to be important for the supply of nutrients and cellular components through fusion of the SCV with vesicles. These vesicles travel along microtubules that are delivered by dynein motors [19]. The repositioning of the SCV is also dynein-dependent, and this process is facilitated by the recruitment of Rab7 together with the host protein RILP. Both Rab7 and RILP recruit the microtubule motor dynein. After reaching the perinuclear position, this position is maintained by the activity of effectors SseF and SseG, which interact and inhibit further movement of the SCV by manipulating dynein activity [77]. In addition, SifA plays a role in maintaining the perinuclear position by binding Rab7 and thereby blocking interaction between Rab7 and RILP, which leads to inhibition of dynein recruitment [13]. Finally, SpiC is found to control SCV trafficking through interactions with host proteins TassC and Hook3 [78].

Studies in cell cultures reveal that after proper localization of the SCV, tubular structures extending from the SCV form SIFs [19]. SIFs are enriched in Lampl and form stable networks that fuse with endocytic vesicles. This fusion is thought to occur in order to acquire nutrients for bacterial replication [16]. The effector SifA is required for the formation of SIFs. This formation involves interactions with host cell proteins kinesin-1 and SKIP [79]. Effector PipB2 is responsible for recruitment of kinesin-1 to the SCV and in absence of SifA or SKIP, the SCV accumulates excess amounts of kinesin-1 [19]. Excessive amounts of kinesin-1 result in the release of bacteria into the cytoplasm, which points towards a regulatory/controlling function of SifA for kinesin-1 recruitment. The interaction between SifA and SKIP also blocks SKIP from interacting with activated Rab9, which is essential for recruitment of Lampl to the SCV

[80]. Both effectors SifA and SseJ bind host Rho GTPase RhoA. Transfection of cells with SifA is sufficient to induce SIF formation [30], and transfection with effector SseJ can also induce SIF formation, but only when it is coexpressed with RhoA, B or C [80]. Complementation of this phenotype by combined activity of SseJ and RhoA, B or C indicates that it is likely that SifA mimics Rho GTPase activity [80]. Effector SseJ is a cholesterol acyltransferase that esterifies cholesterol during infection [81]. SCVs and SIFs are enriched in cholesterol and the function of SseJ is dependent on the interaction with RhoA [82]. SseJ is thought to control SIF formation, since SseJ expression inhibits SIF formation in wild-type *S.* Typhimurium and deletion of SseJ in the *sifA* background restores stability of the SCV and the formation of membrane tubular structures [83]. A similar function is assigned to effector SopD2, since deletion of SopD2 in a *sifA* strain also restores formation of SIFs and SCV stability [84]. The SPI-1 effector SipA is also found to cooperate with SifA to modulate SCV morphology and ensure perinuclear positioning [27]. A subpopulation of tubular filaments is enriched in SCAMP2 and SCAMP3 [85]. These proteins are mainly found on post-Golgi endocytic and exocytic membranes and perhaps function in the recycling of endocytosed receptors [19]. Currently, all SIFs and other *Salmonella*-induced tubules have only been found in *in vitro* studies, and their existence *in vivo* has not been confirmed.

After proper localization to the perinuclear region, an F-actin meshwork is created around the SCV. Inhibition of the VAP network leads to decreased bacterial replication [13]. SPI-2 effector SteC is a kinase and is essential for VAP network formation [86]. Other effectors involved in VAP are SspH2 and SseI. Both effectors colocalize to the actin cytoskeleton and bind the actin-binding protein filamin [87]. SspH2 also binds profilin and profilin interacts with G-actin and enhances actin polymerization [13]. *S.* Typhimurium strains mutated in both SspH2 and SseI still show normal actin polymerization, suggesting redundancy of these effectors [88]. SpvB reverses the formation of the meshwork by ribosylating actin monomers and preventing polymerization [68].

#### Lipid regulation

The two effectors SseJ and SseL are involved in host cell lipid and cholesterol regulation [89,90]. The binding of cholesterol to SipB is required for efficient cellular entry, but after bacterial internalization, high levels of cholesterol are present

around the SCV. The acyltransferase activity of SseJ esterifies cholesterol during infection and deletion of SseJ leads to decreased levels of lipid droplets and impaired bacterial replication [89]. In Salmonella Typhi, $SseJ$ is a pseudogene, and reintroduction of a functional $SseJ$ gene decreases the cytotoxicity towards cultured epithelial cells [91]. Work in our laboratory showed that deletion of SseL also leads to accumulation of lipid droplets [90, 92]. The $sseL$ phenotype was linked to the deubiquitinase activity of SseL, as a point mutation in the catalytic cysteine also resulted in lipid droplet accumulation [92]. SseL binds OSBP inside the host cell and affects its localization [92]. OSBP has been associated with non-vesicular cholesterol transport, signaling, lipid metabolism and vesicular trafficking, and is required for efficient replication of intracellular S. Typhimurium. The binding of SseL to OSBP likely affects OSBP-dependent pathways to benefit intracellular S. Typhimurium by affecting OSBP-mediated lipid metabolism [92].

Lipids are not the only small molecules that are important for the virulence strategies of S. Typhimurium. Copper, iron, zinc, manganese, nickel and cobalt have all been found to play significant roles in virulence strategies [93, 94]. None of these metals have been found to bind effectors, but it is likely that effectors are involved in regulation of availability of metals to compete with other commensal bacteria inside the host.

### What, when, where & with who?

Research over the past several years has generated a wealth of knowledge about effectors and their role in Salmonella infection. However, crucial parts of the puzzle are still missing. This is illustrated by the lack of any specific therapeutic or prophylactic treatments, and the incredibly high abundance of Salmonella infections in the developed world, as well as in developing countries. Since effectors act cooperatively to establish infection, the functional characterization of all or most effectors is required for a complete understanding of T3SS-mediated infection. A systems biology approach considering all effector functions in one model is now needed to further our understanding of the steps involved in Salmonella pathogenesis. The functional characterization of a specific effector needs at least four parameters to be considered: the enzymatic activities of an effector (what is the effector doing?), the temporal dynamics (when is it doing this?), the localization (where is the effector acting?) and the binding partners (what is the effector acting on?). Many effectors have already been found to perform multiple activities at different cellular compartments with different host partners at different time-points during infection. Regulation of these four parameters is crucial for the cooperative actions of effectors. Knowing all four parameters and understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling these four parameters contributes to a more complete understanding of Salmonella infection. In the next part of this perspective, we will discuss developments and recent advances in research leading to a better understanding of these four parameters and their regulatory mechanisms pertaining to Salmonella disease.

#### Effector activity

One of the parameters that needs to be considered for functional characterization of effectors is effector activity. There are three main strategies that effectors utilize to execute their tasks. The first strategy is the mimicking of endogenous host cell components, exemplified by SopE and SopE2 that mimic GEF, and SptP and SifA that mimic GAP activity. By mimicking host cell proteins, effectors target pathways and can reversibly regulate signaling cascades. The second strategy is the covalent modification of host cell proteins and binding targets. Many effectors possess phosphatase, kinase, deubiquitinase and E3 ubiquitin ligase activities (TABLE 1) and can therefore alter the activity of cellular targets. The third most common approach is binding host proteins directly in order to recruit or deplete proteins and metabolites in specific cellular compartments, or regulate their activity or localization. An example of this third strategy is the recruitment of Rab5 by SopB to the SCV. The recruitment of Rab5 leads to recruitment of Vps34 and is essential for early SCV biogenesis. Many effectors use more than one strategy and are found to possess multiple activities that are associated with specific domains.

A development of the past couple of years is the realization that different activities often correspond to separate functional domains within effectors [95]. Effectors can be involved in several, sometimes unrelated, processes at different time-points of infection. A clear example of a bifunctional effector is SipA [55]. This effector harbors two domains that are responsible for different functions and are separated by a caspase-3 cleavage site [55]. The C-terminal domain of SipA promotes actin polymerization and is involved in nonphagocytic cellular entry, while its N-terminal domain triggers signal transduction cascades that promote PMN migration across the

intestinal epithelium [11]. SptP is another effector that contains two domains [51]. The N-terminal domain reverses cytoskeletal rearrangements by deactivating Rac and Cdc42 immediately after bacterial internalization, while the C-terminal PTPase is associated with the SCV at a later time-point of infection [51]. At the SCV, the PTPase activity increases pathogen replication by binding and dephosphorylation of VCP. Many effectors such as SifA, SopD2 and SpvB have been described to consist of multiple domains that may also perform different activities at different time-points of infection (see TABLE 1).

Sometimes, prediction of potential biochemical activities can be done by comparing sequence and structural features with characterized proteins. Many effectors contain conserved eukaryotic motifs that provide effectors with their specific functions. However, effectors often have unique structures and, therefore, have as-yet uncharacterized structural motifs. Effectors are conserved among many Gram-negative bacteria and identification of homologs of effectors in other pathogens often contributes to the functional prediction of effectors in Salmonella. Salmonella effector SpvC and the related Shigella effector OspF have recently been shown to possess phosphothreonine lyase activity, which is a new and unique enzymatic activity in proteins. Another T3SS effector from *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* mediates the formerly unknown post-translational modification (PTM) AMPylation [96].

Many more effectors might harbor multiple domains corresponding with different activities. While many effector activities are conserved, some are unique and, therefore, discovery of new structural motifs with crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance and experimental identification of new enzymatic activities is critical for characterization of effector functions. Studies on effectors with unknown functional properties can reveal new biochemistry and new potential targets for therapeutics. Therefore, characterization of effector domains and their activities will not only aid effector characterization but might also reveal potential new biochemical activities and therapeutic targets.

### Timing of effector activity

Since effectors exert functions in concert with other effectors, timing of effector activity is crucial to the infection process. One way to regulate the timing of effector activity is the timing of effector secretion. Presently, not much is known about the timing of secretion, which is reflected by our poor understanding of SseJ secretion in the *ssaL* mutant [97]. SsaL is thought to be part of a protein complex that is responsible for switching from the secretion of translocon components to effectors [98]. In the *ssaL* mutant, SseJ expression is upregulated if the culture is grown under SPI-2-inducing conditions, and secretion of SseJ is detected at 8 and 16 h after inoculation. Simultaneous induction of T3SS-2 through an arabinose-inducible promoter results in secretion at earlier time-points, but no secretion at 8 or 16 h, even though SseJ expression was found to be more or less constant [97]. These results suggest a poorly understood regulatory mechanism of secretion, independent of expression.

The work done thus far that focuses on secretion dynamics shows sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that mediate the timing of secretion. A recent study describes the use of a sorting platform that ensures secretion of translocases before effectors [99]. Many effectors interact with chaperones inside the bacteria, and Lara-Tejero *et al.* propose that the hierarchy of secretion may reflect different binding affinities of the secreted protein–chaperone complexes with the sorting platform [99]. The results of another study strengthen this idea, since these authors tested the hierarchy of SipA and SptP secretion and found that the T3SS-1 recognizes SipA more efficiently, leading to faster secretion of SipA than SptP [100]. The authors determined that SipA and SptP are both stored in the bacterial cytosol before the initiation of secretion and proposed that both effectors SipA and SptP compete for transport via a limited number of TTSS-1.

Effector stability can also lead to well-timed effector interplay. This is shown for effectors SopE and SptP that are both delivered in equal amounts early in infection. However, SopE is quickly ubiquitinated and degraded through a proteasome-mediated pathway, while SptP is present and active long after translocation into the host cell [101]. These results are in line with the primary functions assigned to these effectors as SipA and SopE have been shown to be involved in actin rearrangements and cellular entry, while SptP restores actin rearrangements after bacterial internalization [44].

Overall, these results reflect complicated regulatory mechanisms to guarantee effector presence at specific time-points of infection. Secretion dynamics and effector stability are probably two main strategies to regulate effector concentration at specific chronological events in the host cell. A better understanding of temporal regulation will particularly contribute to the field of effector interplay.

Type III effector-mediated processes in *Salmonella* infection

### Effector localization

For some effectors, their localization changes over the course of infection. A dysfunctional localization often results in attenuated virulence and the inability to perform specific effector tasks at the right time and place [102, 103]. New techniques have recently been described by Van Engelenburg *et al.* that make it possible to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterial T3SS effectors inside living host cells [104]. By using a split GFP system, it was possible to follow translocation and colocalization of the three effectors PipB2, SteA and SteC within the host cell. The effectors were fused to the small 13-amino acid 11th strand of the GFP β-barrel while the first ten strands of GFP were transiently expressed in the host cell line. Upon translocation, the GFP forms a functional fluorescent protein and localization of the effectors can be determined. With this technique, colocalization of PipB2 to dynamic tubules projecting from the SCV was confirmed and PipB2 was found to move bidirectionally along the tubular structures. Subsets of SteA localized differently within the cell, with the majority localizing to the SCV and tubules enriched in host trans-Golgi marker [104].

Since effectors are secreted in very low amounts, mapping their localization has proven to be very difficult. In the past, terminally tagged effectors were expressed in cell culture and their localization was mapped after sufficient expression by immunofluorescence microscopy. In these types of experiments, the absence of the context of infection and the different manner and concentration in which the effectors are delivered inside the host cell might lead to artifacts. In addition, changes in effector localization at different time-points of infection are not shown by these types of experiments. The use of the split GFP system with increased sensitivity of microscopy and improved techniques to perform mass spectrometry analysis at different cellular compartments might help to determine localization dynamics over the course of infection.

### Interactions

Many effectors act as enzymes by binding and/or modifying host targets. Knowing the targets of effectors is essential to characterizing effector function and understanding which signaling pathways and cellular processes are affected by *Salmonella* infection. Recently in our laboratory, a screen has been performed to identify host protein binding partners for SPI-2 effectors with the use of stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture [31]. Eleven novel interactions were found, and thus far, three of these interactions were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Many of these 11 interactions indicate effector involvement in major cellular events; however, confirmation and characterization of these interactions is difficult as most SPI-2 effectors do not have a clear phenotype in single deletion mutants [28].

Considering the wide variety of cellular processes that are affected during *Salmonella* infection, one would expect many more effector-host protein interactions to occur than have been identified. One plausible explanation for the difficulties encountered in identifying interaction partners could be that many protein-protein interactions are short lived. Numerous effectors are known to possess catalytic domains with enzymatic activity to modify host cell targets. These enzymatic processes generally occur within a very short time frame. Binding of mutated effectors that are unable to execute the enzymatic process may result in frozen effector-host protein interactions. Therefore, the use of catalytically mutated effectors in interaction screens can be a solution for the detection of transient interactions. Modification of host cell proteins by one effector could also lead to interaction with another effector. Interaction studies in the presence of other effectors could overcome problems with false negatives.

Another approach could be to search for binding partners among other groups of molecules. Lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids or small molecules are all known to interact with proteins, and some of these molecules play an important role in infection. Interactions between effectors and lipids, for example, can have a profound effect on effector function, as is shown for SipB that binds cholesterol. Binding of SipB to cholesterol is found to be essential for effective translocation to the host cell [38].

The focus so far has been on the identification of host binding targets. Potential binding targets can also be found among other effectors and bacterial proteins. Effectors SseF and SseG are known to bind each other and seem to work cooperatively, since an *sseFG* double mutant does not reveal additive virulence defects compared with single mutants [105]. Although multiple experiments confirmed the binding of SseF and SseG, the role of this interaction is unknown so far. SseF and SseG have several predicted transmembrane regions, are hydrophobic and show exclusive membrane distribution [105]. We observed higher levels of SseG during expression in the *Escherichia coli* strain BL21(DE3) when

SseF was coexpressed. This observation might suggest a stabilizing role for SseF inside bacteria [VAN DER HEIJDEN *ET AL*. UNPUBLISHED DATA].

Thus far, identification of host components that are important for *Salmonella* infection has been approached from the perspective of bacterial effectors. Recently, siRNA screens in infected host cells have revealed host cell components that are important for infection with the intracellular pathogen *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* [106]. These siRNA screens expose important components from the perspective of the host cell that, if applied to *Salmonella*, might reveal new pathways and drug targets [106].

Binding partners indicate which pathways and processes are targeted by effectors and which host proteins play a role in *Salmonella* infection. Identifying binding partners is therefore crucial in order to understand the process of infection. Many more potential binding partners can be found among different families of molecules. Different methods often lead to different results and the use of new methods for identifying protein–protein interactions can therefore result in new insights. Expanding the search for potential binding partners to small molecules, lipids, RNA and other effectors might also yield new binding targets. The recent development of new sensitive techniques based on mass spectrometry allows for interaction screening in the context of infection. It is likely that new experiments in the next couple of years will generate a longer list of effector binding partners that will help us understand which cellular processes are targeted by which effectors.

### Regulating effector properties

Unveiling effector activity, timing of effector activity, localization and identification of effector interactions is the first step towards a better understanding of effector-mediated processes in *Salmonella* infection. One of the most significant recent developments in the field of effector research, however, is an increased understanding of the regulatory mechanisms behind these four effector properties. For some time, bacterial pathogens were known to interfere with host PTMs to promote bacterial survival and replication. Many effectors mimic host proteins involved in the host post-translational machinery to modify host proteins and signaling pathways. Recently, PTMs have also been found to play a major regulatory role in localization and activity of effectors.

Generally, most PTMs are restricted to eukaryotic proteins, but effectors have found ways to utilize the host cell machinery to regulate their own properties and characteristics. Thus far, effectors have been found to be lipidated, phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and cleaved by caspase-3. The occurrence of many more PTMs has not been investigated. Many of the PTMs affecting effectors that have been discovered so far play a profound role in the infection process. A model of effector characterization is shown in FIGURE 3.

The first PTM that was found to affect a *S.* Typhimurium effector was lipidation. The effector SifA was found to be lipidated on its C-terminal CAAX prenylation motif, which is required to target SifA to host cell membranes. This CAAX box mediates the covalent attachment of a lipid isoprenyl group to a cysteine residue. Prenylation is often followed by palmitoylation or myristoylation, but this has not been confirmed for SifA. While it was shown that removal of the CAAX box from SifA led to abolition of virulence [107], another group found that strains containing a point mutation in SifA, resulting in deficient S-acylation or prenylation, were comparable to the wild-type strain [108]. Although this is still a debated topic within the scientific community, it is likely that lipidation promotes activity of bacterial effectors by facilitating colocalization and interaction with host targets.

The two SPI-2 effectors SspH2 and SseI have also been found to undergo a form of lipidation inside the host cell [103]. After translocation, these proteins are S-palmitoylated by host-cell palmitoyltransferases, resulting in their colocalization to specific domains of the plasma membrane. While SspH2 localizes to the apical membrane, SseI is found mainly in the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells. The difference in localization indicates that S-palmitoylation is not the only factor that regulates localization of these effectors. SseI has been found to regulate cell migration and this activity has been found to be dependent on palmitoylation and plasma membrane targeting [103].

Many of these PTMs have been identified based on conserved motifs in effectors. Prediction tools based on recognition of these motifs could be of great help in identifying more PTMs, but are not always helpful in identifying modified effectors, as is demonstrated by effector AvrPphB from the plant pathogen *Pseudomonas syringae*. After translocation, AvrPphB undergoes

autoproteolysis to expose its formerly hidden myristoylation and palmitoylation motif, which results in lipidation and proper localization to the plasma membrane [109]. It is reasonable to assume that more effectors in different pathogens use similar strategies to uncover hidden lipidation motifs.

Protein phosphorylation is another PTM that often has a dramatic effect on protein properties. This includes alterations in the activity or interaction properties of a protein, and more recently, the subcellular localization of several proteins was shown to depend on tyrosine phosphorylation [110]. It is not surprising that many Salmonella effectors possess kinase or phosphatase activity in order to regulate host cell processes. Not much is known, however, about the phosphorylation of effectors themselves and the potential impact that phosphorylation may have on their activity. Currently, only one S. Typhimurium effector, AvrA, is known to be phosphorylated [111]. It was found that AvrA is phosphorylated at evolutionarily conserved residues. Even though the role of phosphorylation on AvrA function is still unclear, the conservation of these residues suggests a crucial role for phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of AvrA is dependent on the host ERK pathway that is activated by T3SS effectors [111]. It is fascinating that the activity of AvrA may be controlled by other S. Typhimurium effectors through the regulation of a host signaling pathway.

Although few Salmonella effectors are known to be phosphorylated, regulation of effector activity by phosphorylation is a common theme in other bacterial effectors. For example, the T3SS AvrPto effector of the plant pathogen *P. syringae* is phosphorylated when expressed in plant leaves [112]. Residue S149 was phosphorylated, and substitution of S149 by Ala significantly decreased the ability of AvrPto to enhance disease symptoms and promote growth of *P. syringae*, suggesting an important role for phosphorylation. Owing to the fact that an estimated one-third of proteins are thought to be in some way regulated by phosphorylation, it is likely that more Salmonella effectors undergo phosphorylation modifications.

The post-translational addition of ubiquitin to eukaryotic proteins regulates protein degradation by the proteasome and endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Bacteria do not carry the gene to express ubiquitin and generally do not use this system. Effectors such as SspH2 and SlrP mimic eukaryotic enzymes involved in the ubiquitination process to interfere with

Post-translational modifications potentially regulate all parameters. The combination of new insights in all four parameters and their regulatory mechanisms with a systems biology approach will likely lead to a better model of infection.

regulatory ubiquitin pathways in the host. By contrast, four S. Typhimurium effectors are also known to be ubiquitinated themselves, with important effects on their virulence properties. SopB is multi-monoubiquitinated on six lysine residues and the substitution of these residues almost completely eradicates SopB ubiquitination [102]. Nonubiquitinated SopB localizes to the plasma membrane where it stimulates actin rearrangements and activates Akt but does not localize to the SCV, which leads to impaired bacterial replication that is similar to that of a *sopB* mutant [102].

SopE and SptP are also ubiquitinated, with a regulatory role in temporal dynamics, as was discussed earlier in this perspective. The fourth effector, SopA, is ubiquitinated by E3 ubiquitin ligase HsRMA1, and ubiquitination of SopA leads to quick degradation by the proteasome [113]. SopA mediates bacterial escape from the SCV and, therefore, ubiquitination of SopA seems to be a way of regulating bacterial escape from the SCV [113].

Lipidation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and potential other PTMs to effectors take place after translocation into the host cell and could be a way to activate effectors. Cleavage by host protease caspase-3 is a PTM that was found to affect

Perspective

van der Heijden & Finlay

SipA. Effector SipA has two different domains that perform two different activities during the infection process. These domains are separated by a functional caspase-3 cleavage site [55]. SipA is involved in induction of caspase-3 activity within the host cell, and mutation of the caspase-3 cleavage site leads to attenuation of *S.* Typhimurium virulence in mice. SopA is another effector that has been shown to be cleaved by caspase-3. Mutation of the cleavage site of SopA leads to a significant reduction in the capacity to induce PMN transepithelial migration compared with wild-type *S.* Typhimurium [55]. Many more *Salmonella* effectors have a predicted caspase-3 cleavage site, suggesting a major role for caspase-3 cleavage as a common mechanism to regulate effector function in host cells [55].

---

### Cross-talk through PTMs?

Since the PTM of effectors occurs after translocation into the host cell, this is an ideal way for *Salmonella* to control effector properties. Properties of effectors can shift dramatically after a PTM takes place, which can affect localization, enzymatic activity and interaction properties. In this perspective, we have described a few PTMs that have been found to occur on *S.* Typhimurium effector proteins. Many more PTMs, such as SUMOylation, AMPylation, nitrosylation or disulfide bond formation/disruption, are known to regulate protein properties in general and might be involved in regulating *Salmonella* effectors during infection. The finding that PTMs are involved in numerous processes in a variety of different pathogens suggests that our current understanding of PTMs in effector regulation is just the tip of the iceberg. As more PTMs are discovered to play crucial roles in the regulation of effector activity, localization and target binding, it is intriguing to speculate about potential cross-talk between effectors. Many effectors mimic host enzymes involved in phosphorylation, ubiquitination and lipidation, and possess enzymatic activity to modify other proteins. These effectors could potentially also act directly or indirectly on other effectors that are present in the host cell. Modification of effectors by other bacterial effectors or modified host cell components could be an excellent way to coordinate the processes involved in *Salmonella* infection.

### Systems biology

The use of mass spectrometry and other sophisticated techniques to analyze *Salmonella* infections has generated an enormous amount of data in recent years. Examples are the use of stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture-based methods to analyze overall changes in protein levels [114] and the analysis of changes in small metabolites [115]. In addition, the generation of software for the prediction of effectors [116] has given us tools to identify important players and investigate the collective contribution of effectors to *Salmonella* infection. It is nearly impossible to evaluate the contribution of individual effectors to overall *Salmonella* virulence without a systematic approach. Since effectors work in concert with other effectors their respective tasks need to be examined collectively to create a model of infection. However, while combining effector tasks in a systematic approach, results that are obtained from experiments with different cell types and hosts should be carefully separated. *Salmonella* can infect many different cell types in many different hosts. In higher primates, cattle and rabbits, *S.* Typhimurium causes gastroenteritis, while in mice it causes a typhoid-like disease. In macrophages, *S.* Typhimurium can induce rapid cell death, whereas in epithelial cells, pro-survival pathways are activated and a delayed cell death can be induced. These differences clearly indicate that effector-mediated processes depend on the host, as well as cell type. Effectors likely have different roles and activities in certain cell types and, therefore, a model of infection should be created separately for every cell type and host. These models can then be interconnected to create an overall view of *Salmonella* infection in a respective host. However, there are even caveats with this approach, as cell types need to be integrated and host cells also work in concert with other cell types.

Another important consideration is that experimental findings from *in vitro* studies should, if possible, be tested in *in vivo* models to confirm clinical relevance, since regulation of the infection process *in vitro* often differs from regulatory mechanisms *in vivo*. It is important to use *in vitro* models that closely mimic *in vivo* findings. Much of our knowledge so far comes from cell tissue culturing with epithelial cells and cultured macrophages. Even though research has shown that *S.* Typhimurium has a surprisingly high preference for splenic neutrophils in *in vivo* mouse models [117], almost none of the experiments are carried out in cultured neutrophils. Expanding the variety of cell types used in *in vitro* studies might reveal new effector functions that were thus far overlooked in the existing *in vitro* models.

Type III effector-mediated processes in Salmonella infection

A great example of the use of *in vivo* models to investigate the role of effectors is a recent publication in which the authors performed real-time imaging of S. Typhimurium infection in a murine model [118]. Their results showed that S. Typhimurium needs both T3SS to effectively cross the mucosal barrier in the intestine [118]. The development of high-resolution live cell imaging and the use of more realistic 3D cultures and real-time *in vivo* microscopy are promising areas of research that allow for a view into effector strategies during infection of the host.

Another problem that is encountered when characterizing effector functions is the lack of specific phenotypes and redundancy. Many *in vivo* experiments with *Salmonella* infections to date analyze virulence and compare colony forming unit counts of *Salmonella* mutants at specific parts of the body. It is likely that the use of colony forming unit counts to measure virulence is too unspecific of a phenotype to evaluate the contribution of specific *Salmonella* effectors. The search for more specific phenotypes, such as histopathological changes or biomarkers, should lead to characterization of more effectors and a better understanding of infection.

---

### Future perspective

Although much work in recent years has uncovered many aspects of effector-mediated processes, *Salmonella* infection remains a major problem worldwide. Our understanding of the processes orchestrated by *Salmonella* T3SS effectors is starting to take shape, but many aspects remain poorly characterized. New techniques and approaches will enable us to gather more information about effector activity, effector dynamics, effector localization and interaction partners. Identification of PTMs as a regulatory mechanism for effector properties will likely reveal dynamics of infection and potential cross-talk between effectors. If results are differentiated by cell type and host and all knowledge is put together with the use of a systems biology approach, a model of infection can be created that will show us how these T3SS effectors make *Salmonella* into such a successful pathogen. The next decade might give us the answers that enable us to develop specific means to reduce the rate of *Salmonella* infections.

### Executive summary

#### Background
- The intracellular pathogen *Salmonella* uses two type III secretion systems to inject more than 30 bacterial effector proteins into host cells.
- Effectors mediate and regulate many processes, of which host cell entry, inflammation, cell death, the establishment of the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole, bacterial replication and lipid metabolism are the most important.
- A systems biology approach considering all effector functions in one model is now needed to further our understanding of the steps involved in *Salmonella* pathogenesis.

#### What, where, when & with who?
- For the functional characterization of a specific effector, at least four parameters need to be considered, namely effector activity, effector localization, timing of activity and their binding partners.
- These parameters all contribute to the function of effectors and all four parameters could be regulated to control effector-mediated processes at different time-points of infection.

#### Regulating effector properties
- Recently, several post-translational modifications to effectors were found to have profound effects on effector functions and the outcome of infection.
- Effectors have been found to be lipidated, phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and cleaved by caspase-3.
- Many more potential post-translational modifications could be involved in regulating effector-mediated processes.

#### Systems biology
- It is difficult to evaluate the contribution of individual effectors to overall *Salmonella* virulence without a systematic approach, but results that are obtained from experiments with different cell types and hosts should be carefully separated.
- Experimental findings from *in vitro* studies should, if possible, be tested in *in vivo* models to confirm clinical relevance.
- The search for more specific phenotypes, such as histopathological changes or biomarkers, should lead to the characterization of more effectors and a better understanding of infection.

#### Future perspective
- New techniques and approaches will enable us to gather more information about effector parameters and their regulatory mechanisms.
- The combination of this information in a systematic approach will likely lead to a better model of infection that will eventually enable us to develop specific means to reduce the rate of *Salmonella* infections.
