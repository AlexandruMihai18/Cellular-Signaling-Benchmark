**Background & Aims:** The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains poorly understood. Although apoptosis is a common mechanism of liver injury, the extent and clinical significance of apoptosis in NASH has not been examined. Thus, the aims of this study were to quantify hepatocyte apoptosis in NASH, correlate it with disease severity, and identify possible mechanisms of apoptosis induction.

**Methods:** Hepatocyte apoptosis was assessed in NASH, simple steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and controls without liver disease using the TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry for activated caspases 3 and 7. Liver specimens were also graded according to the magnitude of inflammation and fibrosis.

**Results:** TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in liver biopsy specimens from patients with NASH compared with simple steatosis and controls. Unexpectedly, TUNEL-positive cells were also greater in NASH vs. alcoholic hepatitis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated active caspases 3 and 7 in NASH specimens, confirming the occurrence of apoptosis in this disease. A positive correlation was observed between hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic fibrosis and inflammatory activity, respectively. The Fas receptor was strongly expressed in hepatocytes in liver specimens from NASH patients as compared with controls.

**Conclusions:** Hepatocyte apoptosis is significantly increased in patients with NASH and correlates with disease severity, suggesting that antiapoptotic therapy may be useful in this syndrome.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as one of the most common causes of liver disease in the United States and other countries. NAFLD is a clinicopathologic syndrome with a wide spectrum of liver damage ranging from simple, uncomplicated steatosis to steatohepatitis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a subset of NAFLD and is characterized by the presence of steatosis along with inflammatory activity with or without fibrosis, indicating the possibility of progressive liver disease. Although insulin resistance seems to play a pivotal role in the development of this syndrome, the pathogenesis of NASH as it relates to tissue injury remains poorly understood. It is not yet known why simple steatosis remains stable and nonprogressive in some patients, whereas steatohepatitis and fibrosis develops in others. Insight into the mechanisms responsible for the progression of NASH may be helpful in designing therapeutic strategies for this disease entity.

Hepatocellular apoptosis, a form of cell death, is emerging as an important, if not critical, mechanism contributing to the progression of human liver diseases. Indeed, hepatocyte apoptosis occurs in viral, alcohol-induced, Wilson's, and cholestatic liver diseases. Not only is hepatocyte apoptosis recognized as an important mechanism of liver injury, but it also may contribute to liver fibrogenesis and the development of cirrhosis. For instance, attenuation of hepatocyte apoptosis also reduces fibrogenesis in animal models of cholestasis. Engulfment of apoptotic bodies by hepatic stellate cells stimulates the fibrogenic activity of these cells and may be one mechanism by which hepatocyte apoptosis promotes fibrosis. Although hepatocyte apoptosis may occur by a variety of mechanisms, death receptor-mediated apoptosis is a particularly prominent process in the liver. The death receptor Fas is often up-regulated by hepatocytes in disease processes enhancing Fas-mediated apoptosis. However, the occurrence and significance of Fas upregulation and hepatocyte apoptosis has not been examined in humans with NASH.

The principal objectives of this study were to ascertain the occurrence and significance of apoptosis in NASH. To address these objectives, we formulated the following 3 questions: (1) Does hepatocyte apoptosis occur in humans with NASH? (2) Does hepatocyte apoptosis correlate with disease severity? (3) Is Fas expression upregulated in this disease? The results suggest that hepatocyte apoptosis is prominent in humans with this liver condition and correlates with disease severity, implicating a role for hepatocyte apoptosis in the pathogenesis and progression of NASH.

# Materials and Methods

## Patient Population

The study was approved by the Mayo Institutional Review Board, and all patients gave written informed consent for participation in medical research. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 34 untreated consecutive patients with NASH were collected prospectively. All these patients were seen at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The diagnosis of NASH was established based on the following criteria: (1) persistent abnormal liver tests for more than 3 months, (2) liver biopsy compatible with NASH, (3) alcohol consumption of <40 g/week, and (4) appropriate exclusion of other liver diseases. The control population consisted of 28 normal liver samples retrieved from the surgical pathology Mayo Clinic files from 28 patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal metastasis. For further comparison, we also retrieved from our pathology files 10 liver samples from patients with simple steatosis and 26 liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

## Liver Histology and Grading

Liver histology was graded according to the magnitude of steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis as proposed by Brunt et al. \({ }^{13}\) The degree of steatosis and inflammatory activity was measured using a standard 3-point scale (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The stage of fibrosis was measured using a 5-point scale (0 = none, 1 = perivenular and/or perisinusoidal fibrosis in zone 3, 2 = fibrosis affecting zones 3 and 2, 3 = septal/bridging fibrosis, 4 = cirrhosis). All liver biopsy specimens were reviewed by an experienced hepatopathologist blinded to the clinical context of the biopsy and laboratory parameters.

## TUNEL Assay

Hepatocyte apoptosis in liver sections were quantitated by counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells in 30 random microscopic fields (\(\times 400\)) as previously described by Miyoshi et al. in detail. \({ }^{14}\) Briefly, paraffin blocks were cut into 4-μm slices using a microtome; the sections were then deparaffinized by heating for 30 minutes at \(60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), followed by soaking them twice at room temperature in a xylene bath for 5 minutes. The tissue slices were hydrated by transferring them through the following solutions for 3 minutes at room temperature: 100% ethanol twice; 95%, 90%, 85%, 70%, 50%, and 30% ethanol; and double-distilled water. The TUNEL assay was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). The specimens were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axi overt 35; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The data were expressed as the number of TUNEL-positive cells/high-power field (\(\times 400\)).

### Immunohistochemistry for Activated Caspases 3 and 7 and Fas

Caspases, especially caspases 3 and 7, play a key role in the final or execution phase of apoptosis. \({ }^{15}\) When activated, these caspases are cleaved at aspartate residues, resulting in the formation of new antigenic sites, neoepitopes. One of these neoepitopes is shared between caspases 3 and 7 and can be used to identify caspases activation in tissues. Paraffin-embedded liver tissue was cut, deparaffinized and hydrated as described above for TUNEL assay. The sections were soaked in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes at room temperature and then incubated in blocking buffer (protein block, serum-free solution; DAKO corporation, Carpinteria, CA) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-caspase 3 and 7 neoepitope specific antisera (CM1 Ab; IDUN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., La Jolla, CA) or a monoclonal rabbit anti-Fas antibody (C-20 Ab; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The samples were incubated with primary antisera 1:100 for both caspases 3 and 7 and Fas in the blocking solution for 3 hours at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with the ready-to-use secondary antibody (biotin-labelled affinity isolated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, DAKO) for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the samples were incubated with a ready-to-use streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate in PBS containing carrier protein and antimicrobial agents (DAKO) for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the samples were stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector) for 2 to 5 minutes, washed in PBS, counterstained with hematoxylin for 2 to 3 minutes, and dehydrated by transferring them through increasing ethanol solutions (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100% ethanol). Following dehydration, the slices were soaked twice in a xylene bath at room temperature for 5 minutes, mounted and examined. Fas immunohistochemistry was semiquantitatively evaluated using a previously described 4-point scoring system (0 = no staining, 1 = positive staining in less than 30% of cells per high-power field, 2 = positive staining in more than 30% but less than 70% of cells per high-power field, and 3 = positive staining in more than 70% of cells per high-power field). \({ }^{16}\)

## Results

### Clinical and Laboratory Features for the NASH Population

The main demographic and clinical and laboratory data of the NASH population are summarized in Table 1. Among the 34 patients, 11 (32%) were male and 23 (68%) were female. The mean age at the time of liver biopsy was 46.2 ± 11 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.5 ± 4.4, with 21 patients having a BMI higher than 30. Four (12%) patients had cirrhosis, all Childs-Turcotte-Pugh class A. Seven (21%) patients had associated type 2 diabetes, with all 7 patients being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents and 2 patients requiring additional insulin supplementation. The mean serum ALT value was 114.9 ± 60.4 U/L, and the mean serum AST was 75.1 ± 49.3 U/L. Serum levels of albumin and bilirubin as well as prothrombin time were essentially within normal range in all patients.

### Hepatocyte Apoptosis Is Increased in NASH Patients

Hepatocyte apoptosis was assessed by the TUNEL assay and confirmed by performing immunohistochemistry for activated caspases 3 and 7. In liver specimens from control patients, only a few isolated TUNEL-positive cells were identified. In contrast, TUNEL-positive cells were readily observed in liver tissue from patients with NASH (Figure 1A). Quantitation of TUNEL-positive cells demonstrated a significant increase of hepatocyte apoptosis in patients with NASH vs. controls (4.0 ± 2.3 vs. 0.8 ± 0.2 apoptotic cells/×400 field, respectively, \(P < 0.01\)) (Figure 1B). The number of TUNEL-positive cells in liver specimens from patients with NASH was also significantly increased as compared with specimens from patients with simple steatosis (Figure 2); indeed, the number of TUNEL-positive cells in simple steatosis specimens was similar to controls (1.1 ± 0.4 vs. 0.8 ± 0.2 apoptotic cells/×400 field, respectively, \(P =\) NS). The magnitude of TUNEL-positive cells in NASH was next compared with an inflammatory liver disease also characterized by steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis (Figure 2). Unexpectedly, TUNEL-positive cells were increased in NASH vs. alcoholic hepatitis (4.0 ± 2.3 vs. 2.0 ± 0.31 apoptotic cells/×400 field, respectively, \(P \leq 0.05\)). These data provide strong morphologic evidence that hepatocyte apoptosis occurs and is increased in patients with NASH.

Immunohistochemistry for activated caspases 3 and 7 was performed using a selective antisera for the shared neoepitope. Immunoreactive product was readily identified in liver tissues from patients with NASH, but was not identified in controls (Figure 3). The immunoreactive product was selective for the caspase epitope because a reaction product was not obtained in the absence of the primary antibody. These data confirm the presence of hepatocyte apoptosis in patients with NASH by a complementary and highly specific technique.

### Hepatocyte Apoptosis Correlates With Disease Severity in NASH

Hepatocyte apoptosis was correlated with both biochemical markers of liver injury, as well as graded histopathologic alterations in patients with NASH. First, patients were divided into a group with an AST/ALT ratio lower than 1 (\(n = 22\)) and a group with an AST/ALT ratio higher than 1 (\(n = 12\)). This ratio and cutoff has been suggested to reflect severity of fibrosis in NASH.¹⁷ Hepatocyte apoptosis was significantly increased in patients with an AST/ALT ratio higher than 1 compared with those with an AST/ALT ratio lower than 1 (5.4 ± 2 vs. 2.9 ± 1.3, respectively, \(P < 0.05\)) (Figure 4A). Next, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was correlated with graded histopathologic alterations in patients with NASH (Figure 4B and C). A correlation was observed between the number of TUNEL-positive cells and the independent grading of fibrosis and steatohepatitis. Hepatocyte apoptosis was significantly higher in patients with advanced (stage 3-4) fibrosis compared with patients with early (stage 1-2) fibrosis (5.9 ± 2 vs. 3.2 ± 1 apoptotic cells/×400 field, respectively, \(P = 0.02\)) and vs. those patients without evidence of fibrosis (stage 0) (5.9 ± 2 vs. 1.9 ± 1.2 apoptotic cells/×400 field, respectively, \(P = 0.01\)) (Figure 4B). Finally, hepatocyte apoptosis was significantly increased in patients

with moderate to severe steatohepatitis compared with those patients with only mild steatohepatitis (5.8 ± 2.5 vs. 2.2 ± 0.9 apoptotic cells/×400 field, respectively, \( P = 0.02 \)) (Figure 4C). These results suggest that hepatocyte apoptosis is more prominent in patients with more advanced forms of NASH.

Fas Protein Expression Is Increased in NASH Patients

To gain insight into the mechanisms of apoptosis in NASH, Fas immunostaining was performed in the NASH specimens and compared with simple steatosis and normal control specimens. The immunoreactive product was readily identified in liver tissue from patients with NASH and to a lesser extent in liver tissue from patients with simple steatosis and was only weakly seen in control specimens (Figure 5A). The immunoreactive product was selective for the Fas epitope, in that reactive product was not observed in the absence of the primary antibody. Semiquantitative analysis showed that Fas-staining score was significantly higher in patients with NASH compared with patients with simple steatosis and to normal controls (1.8 ± 1.0 vs. 1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 0.3 ± 0.5, respectively, \( P \leq 0.01 \)) (Figure 5B). These data suggest that up-regulation of Fas may contribute to the hepatocyte apoptosis observed in NASH patients.

Discussion

The principal findings of this study relate to the occurrence and significance of apoptosis in NASH. The observations demonstrate the following in NASH as compared with controls: (1) hepatocyte apoptosis is prominent; (2) hepatocytes apoptosis is associated with advanced stages of the disease, implicating a role for hepatocytes apoptosis in disease progression; and (3) Fas expression is enhanced, suggesting a mechanistic role for this death receptor in this disease process. Taken together, these observations suggest a critical role for hepatocyte apoptosis in NASH. Each of these observations is discussed in greater detail below.

optosis in NASH. Although the TUNEL assay, employed for these studies to identify apoptotic cells, may under certain circumstances also label necrotic cell death,²⁰ we were also able to confirm caspase activation and enhanced Fas expression, both key and instrumental mediators of apoptosis. The occurrence of apoptosis in NASH is, therefore, firmly established by these studies. The magnitude of apoptosis may appear minor; however, apoptosis is difficult to detect in tissue, given the rapid disappearance and phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies in tissue.²¹ Schulte-Hermann et al. have suggested that a 4% rate of apoptosis would lead to a 25% reduction of the liver in 72 hours.²² Thus, the rates of apoptosis observed in this study imply a significant role for this process in the pathogenesis of NASH.

Our studies identified a relationship between hepatocyte apoptosis and fibrosis in NASH. Although enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis in fibrotic NASH may simply indicate disease severity, increasing evidence suggests a causal relationship between apoptosis and fibrosis. Indeed, inhibition of apoptosis attenuates hepatic fibrogenesis in animal models of cholestatic liver injury.⁹ We have recently reported the engulfment of hepatocyte apoptotic bodies by a human stellate cell line.¹⁰ The apoptotic body engulfment was associated with further activation of these cells as evidenced by enhanced transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and collagen generation. Hepatocyte apoptosis may also directly be associated with the generation of cellular mediators promoting inflammation and fibrosis in pathophysiologic conditions. For example, hepatocyte apoptosis does elicit an inflammatory response in the liver, which could secondarily induce stellate cell activation.²³ Although originally thought of as a “silent process” (i.e., a physiologic event without pathologic consequences), unorchestrated and continuous apoptosis in the liver likely contributes to liver disease progression in NASH.

An increase in Fas expression was observed in the NASH specimens. Given the nature of this translational study, it was not possible to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for enhanced Fas expression. This death receptor can be up-regulated at a transcriptional level by the transcription factors nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and p53.¹⁵ The role of insulin resistance, steatosis, redox status of the cell, and leptin on activity of these transcription factors need to be explored as mechanisms contributing to the enhanced expression of Fas in this disease. Given the prominent role of Fas in mediating hepatocytes apoptosis, the mechanisms contributing to Fas expression in the steatotic liver deserve further investigation.

Current concepts suggest that the clinical entity of NASH requires “two hits” to become manifest.²⁴ The “first hit” is the development of steatosis while the “second hit” induces cell injury and inflammation, the hepatitis component of steatohepatitis. Within this framework, hepatocyte apoptosis is likely a component of the second hit. Whether cellular apoptosis is a primary mechanism promoting steatohepatitis or is a secondary phenomenon resulting from tissue inflammation cannot be elucidated by the current study. Studies in animal models of NASH will be required, in part, to address this question, especially in that it has therapeutic implications (vide infra).

NASH and alcoholic hepatitis share many pathologic characteristics, including steatosis, inflammation, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis.²⁵ Indeed, there are no universal pathologic findings distinguishing these 2 disease entities.²⁵ Although, apoptosis has been well described in alcoholic hepatitis,²⁶ we observed enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis in NASH vs. alcoholic hepatitis. This observation suggests there are pathophysiologic differences in the mechanisms culminating in these 2 disease processes. Either additional proapoptotic forces exist in NASH, the magnitude of the apoptotic stimuli is greater, and/or antiapoptotic defenses are diminished in NASH compared with alcoholic steatohepatitis. Comparing and contrasting the apoptotic differences between these 2 diseases may help provide further mechanistic insight into the processes underlying these liver diseases.

In summary, our findings suggest that NASH is a proapoptotic disease, an observation that has mechanistic and therapeutic implications. Our working model is depicted in Figure 6. Fas-mediated signaling not only signals apoptosis but also mitochondrial dysfunction via caspase 8 cleavage of Bid, a proapoptotic molecule, which

translocates to mitochondria following truncation by caspase 8.²⁷ The resultant mitochondrial dysfunction generates reactive oxygen species and is also associated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases 3 and 7, and apoptosis, which further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation. The reactive oxygen species may also induce apoptosis. In this model, the apoptosis and formation of reactive oxygen species are caspase dependent. Recently, caspase inhibitors have been developed and given to humans in phase I trials.²⁸ If proven safe, these inhibitors would warrant evaluation in therapeutic trials for the treatment of NASH. These concepts merit further investigation as mechanism(s) contributing to the development of cirrhosis in NASH and as potential therapeutic strategies.
