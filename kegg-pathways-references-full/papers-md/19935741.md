Xiao-Jun Du, Ross A. D. Bathgate, Chrishan S. Samuel, Anthony M. Dart and Roger J. Summers

**Abstract** | Although substantial advances have been achieved in recent decades in the clinical management of heart diseases, new therapies that provide better or additional efficacy with minimal adverse effects are urgently required. Evidence that has accumulated since the 1990s indicates that the peptide hormone relaxin has multiple beneficial actions in the cardiovascular system under pathological conditions and, therefore, holds promise as a novel therapeutic intervention. Clinical trials for heart failure therapy using relaxin revealed several beneficial actions. Here we review findings from mechanistic and applied research in this field, comment on the outcomes of recent phase I/II clinical trails on patients with heart failure, and highlight settings of cardiovascular diseases where relaxin might be effective.

## Introduction

The peptide hormone relaxin was named for its action of relaxing the female reproductive tract,¹ and was first sequenced in the 1970s.² Early research on relaxin focused on extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the reproductive system, which promoted collagen degradation and smooth muscle hypertrophy or proliferation.¹ RLN1 and RLN2, the human relaxin genes encoding H1 and H2 relaxin, respectively, were discovered in the 1980s.³⁴ RLN2 is the equivalent of the single relaxin gene expressed in the corpus luteum or placenta during pregnancy of most other species and its product is generally referred to as relaxin.⁵

Over the past two decades, there has been rapid progress in our understanding of the pleiotropic actions of relaxin in the cardiovascular system. In addition to continuous research on the regulation of the vascular system by relaxin during the course of pregnancy, studies have examined cardiovascular pharmacology, signaling mechanisms and its protective effects against disease.¹⁶ Consequently, clinical studies were undertaken to examine changes in endogenous relaxin in patients with cardiovascular diseases and whether exogenously administered relaxin has beneficial therapeutic effects in patients with heart failure (HF).

Thus, it is timely to summarize progress in the field that indicates beneficial actions of relaxin in cardiovascular pathology. In this Review, we discuss basic knowledge of relaxin signaling mechanisms, findings from experimental animal models of cardiovascular diseases, and findings from clinical trials on relaxin. To facilitate translation of basic research into therapeutic use, we highlight areas where further research is warranted to address clinically crucial questions.

### Relaxin signaling: basic science

Relaxin consists of A and B chains connected by disulfide bonds. Relaxin is not only a hormone of pregnancy, but is a paracrine or autocrine factor in many tissues in males and females and acts in the endometrium, mammary gland, decidua, placenta, prostate and heart.¹⁵⁻⁷ Relaxin regulates collagen metabolism in many tissues,⁸ as well as gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, c-fos and cyclooxygenase 2.¹⁷⁻¹¹

#### Relaxin family peptide receptors

In 2002, the endogenous receptor for relaxin, relaxin family peptide receptor (RXFP) 1, was identified and deorphanized by searching genomic databases for related glycoprotein receptors.¹² The four currently identified receptors for relaxin family peptides are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),¹³ and are strikingly different from the tyrosine kinase receptors for the closely related insulin and IGF peptides (Box 1).¹⁴⁻¹⁶ Unlike these receptors, RXFP1 has a large extracellular domain with multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR) in addition to the seven transmembrane domain core of a typical GPCR.¹⁷

RXFP1 binds relaxin with high affinity,¹⁸¹⁹ and signaling involves three distinct mechanisms.¹⁹⁻²² Primary ligand binding involves the B-chain residues of the peptide and the LRRs of the ectodomain.²³ Lower affinity binding occurs in the transmembrane exoloops.²²²¹²⁴ Finally, activation of signaling depends on the low density lipoprotein class A (LDLa) module, as receptors lacking this region bind peptides, but do not generate cyclic AMP (cAMP).²²

High-affinity binding comprises an angle of 45° to five of the parallel pleated sheets of the LRRs and occurs

through a hydrogen-bonding network between the
receptor and two residues of the relaxin peptide-binding
motif, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the
relaxin peptide binding motif (Ile-B20) and a cluster of
residues from neighboring LRRs. Studies with chimeric
RXFP1/RXFP2, however, suggest that the secondary
binding sites reside in exoloop 2.²⁰,²¹ Both primary and
secondary binding are necessary for receptor activation
and it is likely that compounds that bind to the secondary
binding site alone will be receptor antagonists.

How the LDLa module directs cAMP signaling is
unknown, but probably involves specific side-chain
interactions. A mutant of RXFP1, which has the LDLa
module replaced by the second ligand binding domain
of the LDL receptor, LB2, binds relaxin normally but
does not activate cAMP signaling.²⁵ Additionally, mutations
in the RXFP1 LDLa module alter cAMP signaling
but not binding.²⁵ Importantly, isolated LDLa modules
do not rescue the function of LDLa-less RXFP1, but act as
RXFP1 antagonists.²² Thus, RXFP1 activation is complex
and creation of small molecule agonists may require
novel approaches that target the receptor–G-protein
interface directly or produce conformational changes
in receptor structure to cause or enhance signaling
by allosteric mechanisms.

### Signal transduction pathways

Multiple signal transduction pathways are induced in
response to relaxin (Figure 1). Many, but not all, pathways
involve interaction between relaxin and RXFP1.

#### cAMP signaling

cAMP is important for RXFP1 signaling in native cells
and cell lines that respond to relaxin, and involves distinct
patterns of G-protein coupling (Box 2).²⁶ RXFP1 initially
couples to Gaₛ to increase cAMP production,²⁶ and to
Gaₒᵅ to negatively modulate this effect. Subsequently, the
receptor recruits Gaᵢ₃ to activate a Gaᵢ₃-phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase C (PKC) ζ pathway,
producing a further surge in cAMP.²⁶⁻²⁸ Gaᵢ₃ recruitment
involves residues in the carboxy terminus of the
receptor.²⁹ Coupling occurs rapidly (within minutes) and
involves membrane lipid rafts; the delay in cAMP signaling
(about 20–30 min) might be related to the activation
of PI3K and the translocation of PKCζ to the cell surface
to activate adenylyl cyclase.²⁸

These pathways are activated in cells recombinantly
expressing RXFP1 and also in those that endogenously
express the receptors, including THP-1, MCF-7, pregnant
human myometrial and mouse mesangial cells.²⁸ In rat atria, the Gᵢ/Gₒ inhibitor pertussis toxin inhibited
relaxin-induced cAMP accumulation, as well as chronotropic and inotropic responses.³⁰ The cAMP response is
affected by the cell background on which the receptors
are expressed and often reflects a subset of these three
pathways. For example, relaxin activates only Gaₛ in
T-47D cells but both Gaₛ and Gaₒᵅ in Colo 16 and rat
renal fibroblasts.³¹ These differences may help to explain
the varied physiological responses exerted by relaxin in
different target tissues and among species.

### Key points

- Relaxin is a naturally occurring peptide hormone with a broad array
  of cardiovascular actions demonstrated in experimental models
- Cardiovascular tissues are equipped with relaxin receptors that are activated
  by circulating relaxin or regionally generated relaxin and mediate a range of
  bioactivities via diverse signaling pathways
- Experimental research has documented multiple cardioprotective actions
  of relaxin against key disease components, including myocardial injury,
  vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, fibrosis and inflammation
- Clinical trials have also documented vasodilatory action of relaxin in patients
  with acute heart failure
- Clinical trials have demonstrated that relaxin has a good safety profile when
  administered either intravenously or subcutaneously over a short or long period

### Box 1 | Receptors for relaxin family peptides

- The relaxin family peptide receptors (RXFPs) are family A, G-protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs)
- RXFP1 and RXFP2 are leucine rich repeat (LRR)-containing GPCRs whereas
  RXFP3 and RXFP4 are small peptide receptor-like GPCRs
- RXFP1 is the relaxin receptor and has 10 LRRs in the ectodomain and an amino
  terminal low density lipoprotein class A (LDLa) module
- Relaxin binds to RXFP1 via the Arg-X-X-Arg-X-X-Ile/Val motif in the peptide B
  chain, but signal activation involves three distinct mechanisms
- Primary ligand binding occurs between the peptide B-chain residues of relaxin
  and the LRRs of the receptor
- Secondary lower-affinity binding occurs between the transmembrane exoloops
  of the receptor and residues in the A chain of the peptide
- Finally, signal activation involves the LDLa module of the receptor

### MAPK signaling

Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated
by relaxin in human endothelial stromal cells, THP-1 cells
and primary human smooth muscle cells from coronary
artery and pulmonary artery that show increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation
and MAPK kinase phosphorylation with relaxin.³²,³³ In cardiac myocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide, there
is a protective decrease in apoptosis linked to increases in
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to relaxin.³⁴

### Tyrosine phosphorylation

In human lower uterine segment fibroblasts, relaxin
causes tyrosine phosphorylation of a 220 kDa protein
without associated increase in cAMP.³⁵ Tyrosine kinase
and MAPK inhibitors prevent relaxin-mediated increases
in cAMP accumulation (second wave) in ESC and
THP-1 cells,³⁵ indicating positive feedback from MAPK
into the cAMP response. This feedback may involve
transactivation of a tyrosine kinase receptor by RXFP1
and activation of adenylyl cyclase, but further work is
required to determine the exact mechanism.

### Altered gene transcription

VEGF expression in human endometrial cells is increased
by H2 relaxin and involves cAMP and, possibly, MAPKs.
VEGF is involved in regulating menstrual-cycle-specific
blood vessel growth in the uterine endometrium and

this finding is controversial.⁵⁰ The specific pathways involved in NOS activation still remain to be elucidated and are likely highly dependent on cell type.

**Interaction with GRs**

Relaxin upregulates glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression and the number of GR binding sites in human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), spleen fibroblasts and HEK293 cells.⁵¹ Porcine relaxin co-immunoprecipitates with GR in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions of HeLa cells. The effect is independent of RXFP1, as inactivated relaxin—which cannot interact with RXFP1—still causes this effect in intact cells.⁵¹ Comparison of porcine relaxin and a modified relaxin peptide that does not interact with RXFP1 shows that both molecules inhibited endotoxin-stimulated tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 secretion, effects mediated by GR.⁵² The full implications of this interaction remain to be elucidated.

**Cardiovascular effects of relaxin**

Relaxin helps maintain tissue homeostasis and protects the injured myocardium during various pathophysiological processes, underpinning the increasing interest in relaxin as a therapeutic agent. Experimental findings from animal models suggest that provision of relaxin aids in the protection and/or treatment of the failing heart through multiple actions, and clinical trials have revealed the efficacy of relaxin in patients with acute HF.

**Physiology and pathophysiology: animal studies**

Experimental studies in various animal models of cardiovascular disease have demonstrated cardioprotective effects of relaxin (Table 1, Figure 2). Most experimental animal studies to date involve provision of exogenous relaxin. Future studies of relaxin or relaxin receptor gene-targeted mice subjected to different disease models may provide further insight on the role of endogenous relaxin.

**Vasodilatory effects**

Relaxin promotes flow and vasodilation in rodent coronary arteries,⁴²,⁴⁵,⁴⁶ and in the vascular beds of other organs.⁵³,⁵⁴ Relaxin also vasodilates human systemic resistance arteries *in vitro*,⁵⁵ and reduces vascular resistance in rat models of hypertension.⁵⁶,⁵⁷ An earlier study showed that relaxin lowered blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, but not in control rats.⁵⁸ This vasodilation involves increased NO production from the endothelium via the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor, through ERK1/2 and NF-κB activation,⁴⁹ and is enhanced by antagonism of ET-1, catecholamine or angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction.³⁹,⁴⁹ Relaxin additionally vasodilates small renal arteries of pregnant and nonpregnant female rats and of male rats,⁵⁴,⁵⁹,⁶⁰ where low infusion rates produce vasodilation and hyperfiltration and reduce myogenic activity,⁶¹ causing increases in effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Activation of gelatinase activity in renal arteries during pregnancy cleaves big ET to form ET<sub>₁₋₃₂</sub>, which potently activates the endothelial ET<sub>B</sub> receptor–NO pathway.⁵⁴,⁵⁹,⁶⁰ These findings led to the clinical evaluation of relaxin as a

**Figure 1 |** Signaling pathways activated by the relaxin receptor RXFP1. Interaction of relaxin with RXFP1 causes coupling to Gα<sub>s</sub> that activates adenylyl cyclase to increase cAMP. RXFP1 also couples to Gα<sub>oB</sub> to modulate this effect and to Gα<sub>i3</sub> to release Gβγ to activate PI3K and cause translocation of PKCζ to the cell membrane, to activate adenylyl cyclase. The mechanism involving Gα<sub>i3</sub> involves lipid rich signaling platforms and an interaction with the carboxy terminus of the relaxin receptor. The activation of PI3K also results in ERK1/2 activation and an increase in eNOS expression. The rise in intracellular cAMP levels also activates PKA and CREB to cause changes in gene expression for various proteins, including iNOS. In addition there is evidence that RXFP1 transactivates tyrosine kinases and that relaxin directly interacts with the GR to alter gene transcription.

may also be important for maintaining the differentiated phenotype of these cells.¹¹

**NO signaling**

Relaxin increases levels of nitric oxide (NO) both acutely and chronically,³⁶ and several studies link this increase to therapeutically relevant outcomes.³⁷⁻⁴⁷ In a rat stroke model, relaxin reduces infarct size in a NO-dependent manner,⁴⁸ and decreases leukocyte recruitment to areas of inflammation. These effects may involve increased expression and activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS).³⁶ Relaxin can activate endothelial NOS (eNOS) directly by Gβγ subunits and the PI3K pathway, and inducible NOS (iNOS) by cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A, which inactivates IkB, thereby increasing iNOS expression via NFκB.³⁶ Relaxin also increases MMP activity, converting ‘big’ endothelin (ET) to ET<sub>₁₋₃₂</sub>, which acts on ET<sub>B</sub> receptors to increase NO production.³⁶ Relaxin may upregulate the endothelial ET<sub>B</sub> receptor;⁴⁹ however,
vasodilator in patients with acute HF,^{62,63} and in pre-eclampsia, characterized by hypertension, fluid retention and albuminuria during pregnancy.^{60}

### Angiogenic effects

Relaxin also increases expression of the angiogenic cytokine VEGF in a cAMP-dependent fashion.^{11} In *in vivo* experimental models, including the infarcted heart, relaxin stimulates angiogenesis at ischemic wound sites and induces expression of VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor isoforms in cells collected from wound sites.^{64,65} These studies indicate that relaxin speeds the healing process in ischemic wounds. Interestingly, studies in a mouse model of myocardial infarction show elevated vessel densities in the border regions after relaxin treatment.^{79}

### Chronotropic and inotropic effects

*In vitro* and *in vivo* studies in rodents show that relaxin causes concentration-dependent chronotropic and inotropic effects in the atria,^{46,66–70} which contain a high density of relaxin receptors.^{71} However, no positive inotropic effects were observed in atria from sheep^72 or humans,^6 consistent with a lack of relaxin binding in the atria of these species. Clinical studies do not report any relaxin-induced changes in heart rate of patients with acute HF.^{62,63}

### Effects on tissue injury

Relaxin is cardioprotective in guinea pig, rat and pig models of ischemia-reperfusion.^{41,42,45} Treatment with relaxin before ischemia-reperfusion reduced markers of inflammation, cell death, oxidative stress and calcium overload, and markedly reduced infarct size, ventricular arrhythmias and overall mortality.^{42,45} In a rat model of isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury, relaxin ameliorated myocardial injury, inflammatory cell infiltration and subsequent fibrosis, thereby alleviating severe ventricular dysfunction.^{39} In 2007, a study with cultured rat cardiomyocytes showed that apoptosis, in response to H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress, was significantly inhibited by relaxin at nanomolar concentrations, owing to an increased Bcl2/Bax ratio and increased Akt expression.^{34}

Another potentially beneficial cardioprotective effect of relaxin is its antifibrotic activity. Collagens are ECM proteins that tether beating myocytes, transfer contractile force and provide the tensile properties of the myocardium. Following injury, fibroblast activation and proliferation causes increased collagen production and, ultimately, interstitial fibrosis. Fibrosis is increased by hormonal factors (such as growth factors and cytokines), tissue injury or increased biomechanical overload, and influences ventricular dysfunction, remodeling, and arrhythmogenesis. Continuous infusion of relaxin for 2–4 weeks,^{39,73–75} or relaxin gene delivery by viral constructs,^{65,76,77} consistently inhibits or reverses cardiac fibrosis in models of transgenic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, isoprenaline-induced cardiac toxicity, diabetic cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction. Additionally, male relaxin gene-deficient mice develop age-related

**Box 2 | Relaxin family peptide receptor signaling via cyclic AMP**

- Cyclic AMP is a major signaling pathway activated in cells expressing relaxin family peptide receptor 1
- Cyclic AMP signaling is complex and may involve up to three G-proteins, Gαₛ, GαₒB and Gαᵢ₃
- The C-terminal 10 amino acids and Arg752, in particular, are required for Gαᵢ₃ signaling, which also involves interaction of the receptor with membrane lipid rafts
- The contribution of the various G-proteins to signaling varies with the cell type in which the receptor is expressed

cardiac fibrosis, ventricular stiffening and diastolic dysfunction,^{78} suggesting that relaxin is an important endogenous regulator of collagen turnover during ageing. Inhibition of fibrogenesis or reversal of established fibrosis can reduce ventricular stiffening and improve diastolic function.^{79} Notably, although relaxin reduces aberrant collagen accumulation, it does not affect basal collagen content in healthy tissues, highlighting its safety for therapeutic use.

The antifibrotic effects of relaxin provoke the suggestion that it may facilitate and improve stem-cell-based therapies for myocardial regeneration, particularly in ischemic heart disease. Stem cell survival in the infarcted heart is low and scar formation in the post-ischemic, infarcted myocardium limits stem-cell homing, proliferation and overall viability, and forms a barrier against the proper integration of implanted and native stem cells.^{80} Studies in pigs and rats with chronic myocardial infarction demonstrated that the addition of skeletal myoblasts virally transfected with relaxin lowered scar density, reduced apoptosis of engrafted cells and increased microvascular density in the infarcted region, effects associated with an improved ventricular contractile function.^{65,77} *In vitro* studies have demonstrated that relaxin, added to the culture system or secreted by virally transfected skeletal myoblasts,^{81,82} facilitates cell coupling, differentiation and functional maturation of neonatal cardiomyocytes.

### Changes in endogenous relaxin: clinical studies

Clinical studies have examined changes in circulating relaxin and its possible role as a diagnostic marker for patients with cardiovascular diseases (Table 2). Findings have been inconsistent, as described below.

In a study of 27 patients with moderate or severe HF (NYHA Class II or IV) owing to dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy, circulating relaxin levels were higher than that seen in the 13 control patients with suspected coronary artery disease but no structural cardiovascular disease, and correlated well with the severity of HF.^{83} An inverse correlation between relaxin plasma levels and levels of the vasoconstrictor ET-1 was also identified in the 14 patients with severe HF,^{83} implying an antivasoconstrictive action of relaxin. The relationship between the two proteins was confirmed in cell studies.^{49,83} Serial monitoring of relaxin levels showed good reproducibility, but also a significant decline of plasma relaxin levels after vasodilatory therapy and hemodynamic improvement in the 14 patients with

Changes in circulating relaxin levels in patients with HF, therefore, remain unclear and further investigation on the role of endogenous relaxin in heart disease is warranted. Clinical studies are necessary to confirm findings in patients with cardiomyopathy and severe HF, and to explore potential relationships in other settings of heart disease.⁸³ Given that circulating relaxin is eliminated mainly by the kidneys and, to a lesser extent, by the liver,⁹¹ elevated circulating relaxin observed in patients with renal failure⁸⁶ might in part be a result of reduced capacity for relaxin clearance. Changes in relaxin clearance in the setting of heart disease, and the potential contribution of these changes to levels of circulating relaxin remain to be addressed.

Therapeutic use of relaxin: clinical studies

In 11 healthy individuals enrolled in an open-label study in the UK, relaxin therapy (0.5–2 μg/kg/h intravenously for 5 h) caused no change in systolic blood pressure or GFR.⁹² In 92 patients with systemic sclerosis, however, relaxin therapy (25 μg/kg/day subcutaneously, 6–12 months) caused a fall in systolic blood pressure; this effect was particularly strong in the 10 patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg.⁹³ The vasodilator properties of relaxin, its antagonism of angiotensin II, and the possible beneficial effect of relaxin on renal function,³⁶ underpin its potential therapeutic benefit in patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly HF. The first reports of clinical trials of relaxin therapy in patients with HF were published in 2009.

Phase I clinical studies using relaxin investigated its vasodilator effects in patients with compensated or acute HF.⁶²,⁶³ A study enrolled 16 patients with stable NYHA Class II/III HF and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 35%.⁶² All patients received an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), as well as a β-blocker and diuretics, and received 24 h relaxin (intravenously) at one of three dosage regimens while undergoing hemodynamic monitoring. No adverse events occurred and hemodynamic measurements indicated a vasodilator action, with falls in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance with maintained systolic blood pressure, and a trend toward increased cardiac index attributable to higher stroke volume, since heart rate was unchanged. Creatinine levels also fell, but with a rebound elevation at day 9 in patients receiving the highest dose (960 μg/kg/day). The greatest effects on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and levels of N-terminal proBNP occurred at doses of 10–100 μg/kg/day whereas effects on cardiac index was more evident at higher doses.⁶² The trial investigators suggested that different dose-response curves for venous and arterial dilator properties of relaxin may explain the bell-shaped dose-response relationship.

In the recent Pre-RELAX-AHF study, 234 patients with acute HF and mild-to-moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30–75 ml/min/1.73m²) but maintained systolic blood pressure (>125 mmHg) were allocated to receive placebo or one of four relaxin intravenous dosage regimens.⁶³ Patients receiving inotropes or intravenous vasodilators were excluded. There was a high incidence of atrial fibrillation or flutter (39–60%) and about half the cohort had a baseline LVEF lower than 40% (not measured in approximately 30% of patients). ACE inhibitor or ARB use at enrollment was 60–70%, and β-blocker use was 50–60%, in keeping with the current standard management of patients without systolic dysfunction.⁶³ The trial assessed a composite of a number of clinical end points, including renal impairment and changes in blood pressure. Relaxin was associated with a borderline and significant improvement in self-reported breathlessness when administered at a dose of 30 μg/kg/day (intravenously). Cardiovascular death or readmission by day 60 or death by day 180 was also improved, although all-cause death or readmission rate was not. This dose was

also associated with a trend to clinical improvement of HF and reduced requirement for diuretics by day 5. No significant differences between serum creatinine at day 14 were apparent among the groups; however, the proportion with an increase in creatinine ≥26 μmol/l tended to be higher in groups treated with relaxin at higher doses, compared with those receiving the placebo control. All groups displayed a similar fall in systolic blood pressure by 10–20 mmHg. For all relaxin groups, survival or being out of hospital from baseline to day 60 was higher than for the placebo group, although this study was not powered to address this end point.

Taken together, these studies confirm the safety of relaxin infusion (up to 960 μg/kg/day) and are consistent with a vasodilator effect in patients with HF, but relaxin therapy was not consistently accompanied by improvement in renal function. The patient population enrolled in the Pre-RELAX-AHF study is a good representation of the general population of patients hospitalized with acute HF to date. Based on findings from the Pre-RELAX-AHF study, a further trial testing the dose of 30 μg/kg/day in acute HF is planned (RELAX AHF-1). It is important that patients in this trial receive current best practice management at baseline, including for hypertension (for example, ACE inhibitors if it is indicated and tolerated), and that the study is powered sufficiently to detect worthwhile changes in ‘hard’ end points.

The HF studies to date have sensibly addressed potential benefits from short-term treatment, but have not examined whether other properties of relaxin may be therapeutic. Indeed, relaxin treatment may also be beneficial for situations other than vasodilation, given that relaxin exerts other biological actions. The treatment of conditions where cardiac fibrosis is the major pathophysiology is intriguing, especially with the increasing availability of imaging techniques, such as MRI, allowing both patient selection and quantification of fibrosis in patchy or diffuse form as a surrogate end point.<sup>94</sup> Myocardial stiffness in hypertensive patients with left ventricular

hypertrophy and fibrosis and presenting as HF with normal LVEF is a situation with limited therapeutic options that might benefit from the use of relaxin. Such patients could be included in further relaxin trials since a substantial percentage of HF patients have a history of hypertension and may not have a markedly suppressed LVEF.

Research has established the pivotal role of cardiac fibrosis in initiation and maintenance of arrhythmias, owing to ectopic automaticity of myofibroblasts and aberrant conductance of fibrotic myocardium.<sup>95,96</sup> The possibility that inhibition or regression of fibrosis would be antiarrhythmic has never been examined. Whereas mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with one of the known antifibrotic drugs eplerenone or spironolactone is associated with 21–29% reduction in sudden cardiac death,<sup>97,98</sup> a direct antiarrhythmic effect cannot be excluded, since conditional overexpression of mineralocorticoid receptors in mouse hearts leads to channel remodeling and ventricular arrhythmias.<sup>99</sup>

Relaxin is also likely to be effective in patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving primary coronary intervention. This condition is associated with events in which relaxin has been shown to exert beneficial effects at therapeutic doses, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, cardiomyocyte death, arrhythmias, vasoconstriction, angiogenesis and reactive or replacing fibrosis.

### Pharmacology and clinical efficacy

#### Pleiotropic effects of relaxin

Relaxin clearly activates a wide range of signaling pathways, including those involving cAMP, ERK1/2, tyrosine kinases, NO, GR, VEGF and IGF binding protein-1. What is less clear, however, is which pathways are important for the improvements seen in relaxin-treated patients with acute HF. Possible properties of relaxin that may underpin its therapeutic effects include vasodilation, antagonism of angiotensin II and possible improvements in
renal function. Both cAMP and NO are vasodilators and would be expected to cause physiological antagonism of angiotensin II. The cAMP response is complex and, from the earliest studies of relaxin signaling, some cells and tissues were found not to show a cAMP response to relaxin whereas, in others, the response varies from poor to easily measureable.²⁶,²⁸,³⁰,¹⁰⁰ The changes in cAMP involve coupling of RXFP1 to at least three different G-proteins (as described above),²⁸,²⁹ but the contribution of each of these combinations varies with cell type, which explains some of the wide variations in responses to relaxin observed in different tissues.¹⁰¹ Determination of the role of cAMP in arteries and veins of different diameter should shed further light.

NO signaling is undoubtedly involved in the vasodilator effects of relaxin and its importance likely varies in different vessels. As described above, NOS isoforms are upregulated secondarily to activation of other signaling pathways. Two paradigms provide additional experimental support for the vasodilatory effects of relaxin in vascular beds and tissues. The first is relaxin-induced upregulation of vascular gelatinases in the kidney, increased conversion of big ET to ET₁₋₃₂, stimulation of endothelial ETB receptors, increased synthesis and release of NO, and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.³⁶,⁵⁴ Relaxin may also upregulate ETB receptors to enhance this response.⁴⁹ The second is upregulation of iNOS by relaxin in vascular tissues.⁷,⁴⁴,¹⁰²,¹⁰³ In pregnant and nonpregnant rats, relaxin causes renal vasodilation and increases in GFR and renal plasma flow.¹⁰⁴ In humans, the clinical trials on systemic sclerosis showed that relaxin increases GFR,¹⁰⁵ but more-recent studies in healthy humans showed markedly increased renal plasma flow without changes in GFR.¹⁰⁶ Improvements in kidney function seem more likely in patients with HF, who characteristically display strong activation of both the renin–angiotensin and adrenergic systems; however, this effect was not seen in a clinical trial with patients receiving relaxin in addition to current standard medications.⁶² Studies are clearly necessary to determine the mechanism responsible for vasodilator effects in humans.

### Pharmacodynamic effects of relaxin

One of the striking features of the clinical trial of relaxin in HF was the bell-shaped dose–response curve for the effects on dyspnoea and renal function.⁶²,⁶³ Such curves have been observed in a wide variety of preclinical studies, including cAMP responses in cells expressing RXFP1,²⁶,²⁹,¹⁰⁷ renal and cardiac hemodynamic responses,⁵⁶,⁶¹,¹⁰⁸ changes in plasma osmolality,¹⁰⁸ and MMP expression.¹⁰⁹ These phenomena have been explained in various ways.

The bell-shaped dose–response relationships observed in the studies with relaxin on renal hemodynamics in rats and renal performance in humans can be explained by relaxin exerting different effects in different vascular beds.⁶² In humans, the effect was suggested to result from relaxin having a greater vasodilatory effect in veins than in arteries, where lower doses would reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure without influencing cardiac index, which would be increased by higher doses.⁶² This phenomenon could exist if RXFP1 effector coupling is better in veins than arteries, perhaps owing to a higher RXFP1 density or a different pattern of G-protein coupling in veins versus arteries, as observed in a variety of other cell types.¹⁰¹

One of the problems in ascribing the bell-shaped dose–response curve exclusively to hemodynamic considerations is that similar phenomena occur in cells and tissues where altered blood flow is not a potential explanation. For example, as mentioned above, bell-shaped concentration–response curves are a common feature of cAMP responses in cell systems expressing RXFP1,²⁶,²⁹,¹⁰⁷ and of MMP expression in isolated fibroblasts.¹⁰⁹ Although the reason for the bell-shaped dose–response curve is not clear at present, the lower cAMP responses observed with higher concentrations of relaxin acting at RXFP1 are not a result of receptor desensitization, since RXFP1 does not undergo significant phosphorylation, interact with β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2, or become internalized.¹¹⁰

Evidence that RXFP1 receptors form oligomers is emerging and this oligomerization may be responsible for the negative cooperativity observed in receptor binding studies.¹¹¹⁻¹¹³ The accelerated dissociation of ligand that occurs at higher concentrations shortens the time the ligand remains bound to the receptor and may influence the pattern and degree of activation of signaling pathways.

#### Comparison of effects in humans and animals

The earliest experiments on reproduction clearly demonstrated that the role of relaxin in humans differs from that in many other species. In humans, plasma relaxin levels peak in the first trimester of pregnancy and probably have a role in implantation, whereas, plasma levels increase throughout pregnancy in many other species, to maintain the quiescence of the uterus and easy parturition.⁵ In the heart, relaxin produces powerful chronotropic effects in rats and mice where there is a correspondingly high concentration of RXFP1.⁶⁸,⁷¹,¹¹⁴ In human hearts, however, there is no equivalent response, despite the presence of mRNA for RXFP1.¹²

Nevertheless, in the cardiovascular system, some of the differences may be due, in part, to some confounding factors such as medication. For example, the beneficial effects of relaxin on the renal circulation seen in rats are not always apparent in humans; however, many of the human studies are conducted in patients treated with a variety of drugs including ACE inhibitors (or ARBs), vasodilators, β-blockers, diuretics and inotropes, all of which can influence renal function.⁶²,⁶³ Furthermore, treatment with ACE inhibitors influences the relaxin-induced vasodilator response to relaxin in human small systemic resistance arteries. In arteries from patients on ACE inhibitors, indomethacin blocked, and phosphodiesterase inhibition enhanced, responses to relaxin, indicating that prostanoids and cAMP were important for vasodilation. However, in patients not on ACE inhibitors, the NO pathway was much more important.⁵⁵

Development of novel ligands acting at RXFP1
As outlined previously, the interaction between relaxin and RXFP1 is complex and involves three stages; binding of the relaxin B-chain to the LRRs, interaction with the second extracellular loop of the seven transmembrane region and, finally, an unknown action of the LDLa module that is essential for signaling.²⁰,²² The complex binding process represents a major challenge for the development of nonpeptide orthosteric agonists at the RXFP1 as the three-stage binding process would be difficult to mimic with molecules other than peptides. Even simple alterations of the receptor cause major disruptions to RXFP1 signaling. Receptors lacking the LDLa module bind relaxin normally, but are unable to signal.²² However, coexpression of the receptor lacking the LDLa module and the LDLa module or addition of LDLa to LDLa-less receptors does not restore signaling, which suggests that the LDLa-receptor linkage is essential for conformations required for signaling.²² Perhaps the best approach to the development of nonpeptide agonists for RXFP1 lies with allosteric interactions with the receptor that may induce the correct conformations for signaling without interacting with the orthosteric binding sites. For development of antagonists, interaction with any of the three sites identified as important for relaxin binding and receptor signaling should block the response to relaxin; however, to date no orthosteric antagonists for RXFP1 have been successfully developed. The use of the soluble ectodomain of RXFP1 as an antagonist depends on high affinity binding to the LRR region, which acts as a scavenger for relaxin, and lowering its effective concentration at intact RXFP1.¹²

Conclusions
Over the 80 years since the discovery of relaxin as an endogenously produced reproductive peptide hormone, most of the research has involved its reproductive action and regulation of the ECM. However, the beneficial actions of relaxin on the cardiovascular system have been increasingly appreciated. Clinical trials for acute HF have confirmed the safety record of relaxin therapy and shown therapeutic efficacy. Clinical studies indicate relaxin as a vasodilator in HF, but we need to also consider other clinical situations suitable for relaxin therapy, taking into consideration the pleiotropic actions of the peptide. Acute myocardial infarction and cardiac fibrosis are clinical situations likely to benefit from relaxin therapy and worthy of further investigation. Research with relevant experimental models and selected patients is warranted to generate proof-of-concept evidence and define suitable conditions to fulfill the cardiovascular potential of relaxin.
