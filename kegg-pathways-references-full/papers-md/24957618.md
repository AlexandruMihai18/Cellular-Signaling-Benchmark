Running title: Characterization of two β1,3-Galactosyltransferases WbwC  

Keywords: *E. coli* O104 and O5; O antigen synthesis; TF antigen; Galactosyltransferase; Substrate  
specificity; Undecaprenol-pyrophosphate

Abstract

E. coli display O antigens on the outer membrane that play an important role in bacterial interactions with the environment. The O antigens of enterohemorrhagic E. coli O104 and O5 contain a Galβ1-3GalNAc- disaccharide at the reducing end of the repeating unit. Several other O antigens contain this disaccharide which is identical to the mammalian O-glycan core 1 or the cancer-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen. We identified the wbwC genes responsible for the synthesis of the disaccharide in E. coli serotypes O104 and O5. To functionally characterize WbwC, an acceptor substrate analog, GalNAca- diphosphate-phenylundecyl, was synthesized. WbwC reaction products were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, galactosidase and O-glycanase digestion and anti-TF antibody. The results clearly showed that the Galβ1-3GalNAca- linkage was synthesized, confirming WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ as UDP-Gal: GalNAca-diphosphate- lipid β1,3-Gal-transferases. Sequence analysis revealed a conserved DxDD motif, and mutagenesis showed the importance of these Asp residues in catalysis. The purified enzymes require divalent cations (Mn²⁺) for activity and are specific for UDP-Gal and GalNAc-diphosphate-lipid substrates. WbwC was inhibited by bis-imidazolium salts having aliphatic chains of 18 to 22 carbons. This work will help to elucidate mechanisms of polysaccharide synthesis in pathogenic bacteria and provide technology for vaccine synthesis.

Introduction

The O antigens of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram negative bacteria consist of many repeats of a specific oligosaccharide unit and are a major contributor to the antigenic variability of the bacterial cell surface, conferring defence to the bacteria against host killing mechanisms (1-5).

The O antigen gene clusters contain the corresponding glycosyltransferase (GT) genes, most of which have not yet been biochemically characterized. These GT are likely to be responsible for completing the synthesis of the O antigen repeating unit by adding sugars to the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide (6-7). The repeating units are thought to be preassembled on the cytosolic face of the inner membrane where the catalytic domains of GT are directed into the cytoplasm with access to the nucleotide sugar donor substrate pools, as well as to the membrane-bound undecaprenol-phosphate (P-Und) linked acceptor substrates (8-9).

The O104 and O5 strains of *E. coli* produce Shiga toxins (10) which are known to cause severe bloody diarrhea in humans, sometimes leading to hemolytic uremic syndrome and death (11,12). Shiga toxin producing *E. coli* O104 (STEC) have acquired a second gene encoding a Shiga toxin variant (13). Several outbreaks of O104 infections have been reported world-wide (12), for example in 2011 in Germany where thousands were infected, 53 people died and many still suffer from the consequences of infections. In light of growing world-wide antibiotic resistance, alternative therapies such as immune therapies become more important. *E. coli* O104 synthesize an O antigen with a tetrasaccharide repeating unit structure of [-4-D-Galα1-4Neu5,7,9Ac₃α2-3-D-Galβ1-3-D-GalNAcβ1-]ₙ (14) which could be the basis for a vaccine. The O5 antigen has the repeating unit structure [4-D-Quip3NAcβ1-3-D-Ribfβ1-4-D-Galpβ1-3-D-GalNAcal1-]ₙ (15). Thus both O antigens share the Galβ1-3GalNAca disaccharide sequence which is identical to O-glycan core 1 of mammalian glycoproteins and the cancer-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen (16,17). The genes of the O104 antigen gene cluster include three putative glycosyltransferase genes, *wbwA*, *wbwB*, *wbwC*, in addition to CMP-NeuNAc synthesis genes, O antigen polymerase *wzy* gene, and a flippase *wzx* gene (18). This suggests that O104 antigen synthesis follows the Wzy-dependent pathway. Since the *wbwC* gene from *E. coli* O104 has 44% identity to the *orf11* gene

from *E. coli* O5 we proposed that these genes encode orthologous enzymes that synthesize the Galβ1-3GalNAcα linkage.

The assembly of the O104 and O5-antigen repeating units is thought to be initiated by the transfer of GalNAcα-phosphate to Undecaprenol-phosphate (P-Und) by the membrane-bound enzyme GlcNAc/GalNAc-phosphotransferase WecA (*Suppl. Fig. 1*). Alternatively, GlcNAcα-phosphate may be transferred, followed by 4-epimerization of GlcNAc (19) to form the acceptor substrate for WbwC, GalNAcα-PP-Und. Membrane-associated GT then transfer sugar residues from nucleotide sugars to the PP-Und-linked acceptor substrates to complete the synthesis of the repeating unit. The lipid-linked saccharide is flipped across the inner membrane and repeating units are polymerized in the periplasmic space. The completed O antigen is then ligated to the lipid A-core moiety to synthesize LPS which is transported to the outer membrane by the Lpt complex (20,21).

Most of the bacterial GT are still ‘putative’ and require biochemical proof of activity. We have characterized several Gal- and Glc-transferases that catalyse the second step in O antigen repeating unit synthesis (22–25). The synthesis of a natural substrate analog, GlcNAcα-diphosphate phenylundecyl (GlcNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph, GlcNAc-PP-PhU, 14) was instrumental in these studies (26). We recently reported that the enzyme encoded by *orf11* from *E. coli* O5 was a Gal-transferase that utilized GalNAcα-diphosphate phenylundecyl (GalNAc-PP-PhU, 8) as acceptor, as well as the fluorescent acceptor GalNAcα-diphosphate (anthracen-9-ylmethoxy)undecyl, allowing both radioactive and fluorescence based activity assays (27). However, the enzyme had not been fully characterized. In this work, we report the thorough characterization of two WbwC Gal-transferases, the second enzymes in the assembly of repeating units from *E. coli* O104 and O5. We improved the syntheses of GalNAc-PP-PhU and GlcNAc-PP-PhU to achieve higher yields, and showed that WbwC enzymes synthesize the mammalian core 1/TF antigen and can be inhibited by imidazolium salts of specific structures. The enzymes are targets for the development of antibacterial compounds and are useful for the chemo-enzymatic synthesis of glycan-based vaccines that may help to prevent tumour growth.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials. Reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.

GalNAc- and GlcNAc-derivatives were synthesized as described below, in Supplementary material and in previous publications (26, 28–30). The synthesis of the undecyl (U)-containing fluorescent substrate P¹-[11-(anthracen-9-ylmethoxy)undecyl]-P²-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-D-galactopyranosyl) diphosphate (GalNAc-PP-AnthrU) was reported previously (27, 30). Glycopeptides and 4-deoxy-GalNacα-Bn were synthesized by Hans Paulsen, University Hamburg, Germany. GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ-Bn was synthesized by Khushi Matta at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY. Inhibitors were synthesized as described (28, 30, 31).

Chemical Synthesis. The syntheses of acceptor substrates 8 and 14 are shown in Scheme 1. The ether-alcohol 1 was synthesized from 11-bromoundecanol by treatment with phenol-potassium carbonate-potassium iodide in acetone, following a similar procedure by Visscher et al. (32). The phosphate 2 was synthesized by the treatment of alcohol 1 with phosphorus oxychloride in triethylamine-hexanes, by a modification of the procedure by Bernardes et al. (33) for the formation of citronellylphosphate. The acetylated compound 3 was synthesized by the treatment of D-galactosamine hydrochloride with acetic anhydride in pyridine. Treatment of 3 with trimethylsilyl triflate in 1,2-dichloroethane gave the oxazoline 4, following a similar procedure published by Nakabayashi et al. (34). The dibenzyl phosphate 5 was prepared by the treatment of oxazoline 4 with dibenzyl phosphate in 1,2-dichloroethane, following essentially the procedure of Bernardes et al. (33). Hydrogenolysis of 5 in MeOH using Pd/C as catalyst gave the debenzylated sugar-phosphate 6, following essentially the procedure of Montoya et al. (26). The coupling of the *in situ* generated diisopropylammonium salt of phosphate 2 and sugar-phosphate 6 using 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole in tetrahydrofuran to form 7, followed by deprotection of 7 using sodium methoxide in MeOH, gave the final acceptor substrate 8; the procedure followed was essentially that of Montoya et al. (26), but using the D-galactosamine derivative instead of the D-glucosamine derivative.
The purification procedure was altered and the enzyme-substrate reaction product was isolated and characterized in the disodium salt form. A similar synthetic strategy starting from D-glucosamine hydrochloride was followed to produce the GlcNAc-containing acceptor substrate 14 (see Scheme 1), also isolated and characterized in the disodium salt form. All procedures and purification methods were modified appropriately from the existing referenced procedures. Further characterizational data, and NMR spectroscopic data obtained in alternative solvent systems, have been obtained. These data and detailed synthetic procedures are documented in the Supplemental data Section.

Bacterial Growth, Plasmids and Protein Expression. The putative glycosyltransferase genes *wbwC* from *E. coli* O104 (strain G1629) and *orfI1* from *E. coli* O5 (strain G1675) ([Suppl. Fig. 2](Suppl. Fig. 2)) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using primer pairs wl-49644/wl-49645(5-CGGGATCCATGAAATTTAGCGTTCTGTT-3/5-CCGCTCGAGTTATTTCCGCAATATATT-3) and wl-11103/wl-11104 (5-CGGGATCCATGAATGATAGTTCAAGATCAT-3/5-CCGCTCGAGTTAATTCTTAGTCCTTGAAATAC-3), respectively. A total of 30 cycles were performed using the following conditions: denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min, in a final volume of 50 μl. The amplified genes were then cloned into expression plasmid vector pET28a (KanR), containing a cleavable His-tag-encoded sequence at the C-terminus, and the presence of the inserts was confirmed by sequencing using an ABI 3730 sequencer.

Plasmid constructs were transformed into *E. coli* BL21 for protein expression (26). For the induction of plasmid-derived enzyme, bacteria were grown overnight at 37°C in 5 ml of Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml of kanamycin with constant shaking at 150 rpm. The bacterial suspension (5 ml) was transferred to 125 ml of Luria-broth containing kanamycin and the mixture was incubated at 37°C. Isopropyl β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM when the suspension reached an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8. Cells were grown for an additional 4 h at 37°C and were then harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 2200 × g. Pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A total
of 10 ml of PBS containing 10% glycerol were added and aliquots of bacteria were stored at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for

enzyme assays.

Enzyme Purification. WbwC${}_{\text {ECO104 }}$ and WbwC${}_{\text {ECO5 }}$ proteins contained a His${}_{6}$-tag at the C terminus. After IPTG induction, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS (pH 7.4), resuspended into the same buffer and sonicated in four cycles for $30 \mathrm{~s}$ with $2 \mathrm{~min}$ intervals on ice (30). The homogenate was then centrifuged at $8,000 \times g$ in a Centronics M-1200 centrifuge (Boehringer-Mannheim) for $30 \mathrm{~min}$. The WbwC fusion proteins in the supernatant were purified using a HisPur Ni${}^{2+}-$ NTA Sepharose column (Thermo). Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of $200-400 \mathrm{mM}$ imidazole buffer in PBS. Each fraction was analyzed by sodium dodecyl-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) ($12 \%$ gel). The desired fractions that contained fusion protein were pooled and stored at $-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Western blot analysis was performed with rabbit antibody against the His${}_{6}$-tag as the primary antibody (Thermo) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Purified enzymes and cell lysates of the wild type or mutants ($0.5-0.7 \mu \mathrm{g}$ protein/$\mu \mathrm{l}$) were diluted $3: 1$ in $4 \times$ SDS loading buffer consisting of $40 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), $4 \%$ SDS, $8 \%$ glycerol, and $4 \% \beta$-mercaptoethanol, Bromophenol Blue and run on SDS-PAGE gels ($12 \%$ gel).

Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose and then probed sequentially with rabbit anti-His tag antibody $(1: 1,000)$ and anti-rabbit IgG $(1: 10,000)$. Alternatively, mouse anti-His antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody $(1: 5000)$ (Cell Biolabs Inc.) were used. Labeling was visualized with WEST-one spray (iNtRON) or Western lighting ECL Pro (Perkin-Elmer) and exposure of fluorescence on film. Prestained protein standards (GeneDirex) were used to calibrate the gels. The relative protein amounts were determined by densitometric analysis of the Western blot film, performed by using ImageJ 1.43 software. The enzyme activities of purified protein were normalized according to relative amounts of protein detected on Western blots. Protein contents were determined by measuring absorbance at $280 \mathrm{~nm}$ in a microvolume spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo). Purified enzyme (Suppl. Fig. 3, 4) was used for enzyme characterization.

Galactosyltransferase Assays. For Gal-transferase assays, bacterial homogenates were prepared by sonication as described before (23), or purified enzyme was used as indicated. The standard assay mixtures contained in a total of 40 μl: 0.1 mM acceptor substrate GalNAc-PP-PhU (8), 5 mM MnCl₂, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.125 M 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH 7, 10 μl purified enzyme homogenate (5–6 μg protein) and 0.44 mM UDP-[³H]Gal (2000–3500 cpm/nmol). Control assays lacked the acceptor. All assays were carried out in at least duplicate determinations and results were confirmed by repeating the experiments at least once. Mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37°C, and reactions quenched by the addition of 700 μl of ice-cold water and freezing. Enzyme reaction product was isolated using Sep-Pak C18 columns, eluted first in water, then in MeOH, and was quantified by scintillation counting as described (22,25). HPLC separations were carried out as described (24), using a C18 column and acetonitrile/water as the mobile phase. Peaks were monitored by measuring absorbance at 195 nm and scintillation counting of fractions. Kinetic parameters were determined using the program GraphPad Prism. In assays using potential hydrophobic inhibitors, mixtures contained 10% MeOH or EtOH in the assay.

Enzyme Reaction Product Identification by HPLC and Mass Spectrometry. The enzyme reaction products were prepared in large-scale radioactive and non-radioactive forms. The separation of substrates and enzyme reaction products was achieved by HPLC using a C18 column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and acetonitrile-water mixtures (27/73) as the mobile phase, monitored by absorbance at 195 nm. Product peaks were dried and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization – time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS or ESI-MS in the negative-ion mode, as described previously (30).

Identification of Enzyme Reaction Product Structure by NMR. To prepare large amounts of non-radioactive enzyme reaction product for NMR, WbwC assays were carried out as follows. The assay mixture (20 ml) contained 4 μmol GalNAc-PP-PhU 8, 30 μmol UDP-Gal, 5 ml bacterial cell homogenate

in 50 mM sucrose, 0.1 mmol MnCl₂ and 2.5 mmol MES-buffer, pH 7.0. After incubation for 60 min at 37

°C, 10 ml of cold water were added to stop the reaction. The reaction mixture was then applied in aliquots

to fifty C18 Sep-Pak columns and reaction products were eluted with MeOH. Following flash evaporation

and lyophilization of the eluates, reaction product was resuspended in water and further purified by

reversed-phase HPLC (24) using standard compounds. Pooled fractions containing product were flash

evaporated and lyophilized. Dried product was dissolved in D₂O and analyzed by 600-MHz NMR.

Spectra were collected in 1D and 2D experiments using a Bruker spectrometer as described (22).

Linkage Confirmation using Galactosidases or O-glycanase. The anomic configuration of the

linkage formed in the radioactive WbwC reaction product was confirmed by incubation with specific

galactosidases: Green Coffee Bean α-galactosidase (100 Units/ml), E.coli (β1-4-specific) β-galactosidase

(100 Units/ml), bovine testicular (β1-3,-4,-6-specific) β-galactosidase (100 Units/ml) or O-glycanase

(Glyko, 1.25 Units/ml). Aliquots of radioactive reaction product (2000 cpm) were treated in a total

volume of 100 μl with 25 μl MacIlvaine buffer (0.1 M citric acid / 0.2 M Na-phosphate, pH 4.3), 10 μl

0.1% bovine serum albumin and galactosidase or O-glycanase. The activities of galactosidases were

confirmed with Galα- and Galβ-p-nitrophenyl as substrates. Control incubations lacked the enzymes.

Mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, diluted with 800 μl of water, and applied to columns of 0.4

ml AG1x8 (Cl⁻-form). Released radioactivity was eluted with 2.8 ml water and counted, while unreacted

negatively charged WbwC reaction products stayed bound to the AG1x8 columns.

Test for TF Antigen Cross Reactivity. To test whether the enzyme reaction products represented the

cancer-associated TF antigen, JAAFII mouse monoclonal antibody against the TF antigen was used as the

primary antibody (kindly donated by K. Rittenhouse, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo NY, USA)

and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody (Santa Cruz

Biotechnology). 50 nmol of either WbwC_{ECO104} or WbwC_{ECO5} reaction products Galβ1-3GalNAcα-PP-

PhU, WbdN reaction product Glcβ1-3GlcNAcα-PP-PhU (23), compound 8 or its GlcNAc derivative 14,  
or Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Bn as the positive TF antigen control, were incubated with 0.5 ml 1:100 TF antigen-  
specific antibody (4 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline) overnight at 4°C. This was followed by incubation  
with 200 ng secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:1000) for 2 h at rt. 2 μl were saved as positive  
control for antibody, and the remainder was slowly loaded onto C18 Sep-Pak columns. Columns were  
washed first with 5 ml water and then with 5 ml MeOH. MeOH fractions were dried by rotary  
evaporation and dissolved in 500 μl H₂O. Samples were then transferred to small tubes, lyophilized and  
dissolved in 10 μl H₂O. Samples were spotted on Nitrocellulose membrane and dried. Labeling was  
visualized with WEST-one spray (iNtRON) and exposure of fluorescence on film.

**Effect of Amino Acid-specific Reagents.** To evaluate the role of amino acids in Gal-transferase  
activity, the purified enzyme preparations were incubated with amino acid-specific reagents prior to the  
assays for 10 min at rt in reaction mixtures lacking UDP-Gal. Reaction was initiated by the addition of  
UDP-Gal. p-Hydroxyphenylglyoxal (HPG, reacts with Arg), 5,5'-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB,  
reacts with Cys) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, reacts with Cys) were used at 0.2 mM concentration in the  
assay. Disulfide bond reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) was used at 0.1 to 4 mM in the assay, and β-  
mercaptoethanol (beta-ME) at 1 to 18 mM.

**Construction of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> Mutants.** The QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent,  
Santa Clara, CA) was used to construct mutants D91A and D125A of Wbw<sub>ECO104</sub>. Primers were designed  
using the Quikchange Primer Design program. For the D91A mutant, Forward primer was  
5'CAATGAACTGATTTTAGGATGGCTACTGATGATATTTGTTTGCCCTG<sup>3'</sup> and Reverse primer was  
5'CAGGCAAACAAATATCATCAGTAGCCATCCAAAAATCAGTTCATTG<sup>3'</sup>. For the D125A  
mutant, Forward primer was  
5'GGGAAGTGTGCATTGAAGAATTTGCTAATACAATGAAAATTAGGCAAG<sup>3'</sup>

and Reverse primer was 5'CTTGCCCTAATTTTCATTGTATTAGCAAATTCTTCAATGGCAC

TTCCC3'. Amplification was performed with a DNA thermal cycler (model Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient) by using a single denaturation step at 95°C for 1 min followed by an 18-cycle program, consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1.5 min and extension at 68°C for six min. A total of 10 μl of each reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel in 45 mM Tris-borate buffer/1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3, at 150 V for 1 h and stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR reaction mixture was transformed into Top10 cells. Bacterial colonies harbouring mutated genes were isolated and plasmids were isolated and sequenced (Robarts Research Institute, London, ON) to confirm the correct mutations. Mutants D45A, D46A, D93A, D94A, C21A, C82A and C96A of Wbw<sub>ECO104</sub> and mutants D96A, D98A and D99A of Wbw<sub>ECO5</sub> were constructed by Mutagenex (Hillsborough, New Jersey). Bacterial growth, enzyme activity assays, SDS-PAGE and Western blots were carried out as described above.

RESULTS

Sequence Comparisons of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>. A protein-protein BLAST comparison revealed that the amino acid sequences of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> have 47% identity (Suppl. Fig. 2). WbwC from *E. coli* O104 shares 42% identity with uncharacterized WbwC from *E. coli* O81, 99% identity with WbwC from *E. fergusonii* (35) and 79% identity with WfaM from *E. coli* O24 (36). Homologs of WbwC are also found in a number of other bacterial strains. None of these enzymes have been characterized. The other putative glycosyltransferases (WbwA and WbwB) encoded by genes located in the O104-antigen gene cluster (18) share only 13% and 11% identity, respectively, with WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub>. WbiP from *E. coli* O127 (37), which also synthesizes a Galβ1-3GalNAc linkage, shows only 22% and 25% sequence identity with WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> (Suppl. Fig. 2). WbbD from *E. coli* O7 (26) and WbgO from *E. coli* O55 (38) both form a Galβ1-3GlcNAc linkage. WbbD shares 37%

and 35% sequence identity with WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> respectively, whereas WbgO shares 23%

and 20% sequence identity with WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>. Human core 1 Gal-transferase (C1GalT1)

which also forms a Galβ1-3GalNAc linkage, shows very low sequence identity to WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> (12%) and

to WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> (11%). WbwC is predicted to form a GT-A glycosyltransferase fold, and has been classified

in the CAZy GT-2 family which includes many other bacterial and mammalian inverting β-

glycosyltransferases (22-24,37-39). All of the WbwC homologs have a DxD sequence that might be

involved in catalysis (40).

Properties of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>. Based on the amino acid composition, the molecular

masses of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> were calculated to be 31.2 and 31.4 kDa, respectively

(protein molecular mass calculator; Science Gateway, www.sciencegateway.org). The two recombinant

proteins from the bacterial lysate were induced by 1 mM IPTG in a 4 h incubation at 37°C, and showed

intense bands on SDS–PAGE at an apparent molecular mass of 30 to 32 kDa. Induction at room

temperature, overnight or after 6 h at 0.5 or 1 mM IPTG did not improve the level of expression. The

His<sub>6</sub>-tagged WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> were purified by NTA Sepharose affinity chromatography

(Suppl. Fig.3,4). Western blotting showed a major protein band at 30 kDa for WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> for both, the

cell lysate, and the purified enzyme at about 90 % purity. WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> was expressed and purified similarly

but was slightly larger (32 kDa). A single elution with 150 mM imidazole was optimal for eluting the

protein from the NTA column (about 50 % purity). The specific activities of purified WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and

WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> were enriched 49-fold and 14-fold, respectively. The final yield of purified WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and

WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> proteins obtained from 150 ml starting culture was 5 to 7 mg (0.6 mg/ml). Under standard

conditions, the transfer of Gal to GalNAca-O-PO<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>3</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>-O-Ph was linear up to 10 min incubation

time and up to 6 μg protein per assay for purified WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>. Gal-transferase activities

in the bacterial homogenates were stable for several days at rt, for at least 2 weeks at 4 °C and for at least

4 months at −20°C.
The presence of the conserved DxD motif (DTDD in the WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and DSDD in the

WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ sequence) suggested the involvement of divalent metal cations as cofactors in Gal-transferase catalysis ([40, 41]). No activity was observed in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. At 5 mM concentration,

Mn${}^{2+}$ was the most efficient cofactor among the divalent metal ions (set to 100% activity), but Mg${}^{2+}$ also

stimulated the activity (22% for WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and 15% for WbwC${}_{ECO5}$). The optimal concentration of

Mn${}^{2+}$ in the WbwC assays was between 2.5 and 5 mM (data not shown). None of the other metal ions

tested at 5 mM concentration (Co${}^{2+}$, Pb${}^{2+}$, Ca${}^{2+}$, Zn${}^{2+}$ and Cu${}^{2+}$) were effective in stimulating WbwC Gal-

transferase activity. Both WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ activities were shown to have a broad pH

optimum between 7 and 8 (data not shown).

### Effect of Detergents on WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ Activity.

The hydrophobicity plots of both

WbwC enzymes did not reveal any transmembrane domains, but *in vivo*, the enzymes could be loosely

associated with the bacterial membrane. Membrane components or detergents could also affect the

availability of the sugar-diphosphate-lipid acceptor substrate. We therefore determined whether the

purified WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ enzyme activity was affected by the presence of 0.125 to 0.5 % Triton X-100, NP-

40 (nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol), or n-octyl-$\beta$-D-glucoside (Octylglucoside). There was no effect

with NP-40 treatment but the presence of the other detergents reduced WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ Gal-transferase

activities to varying degrees (data not shown). Interestingly, the effect of detergents on WbwC${}_{ECO5}$

enzyme activity differed from the effect on WbwC${}_{ECO104}$, and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ activity was reduced by all

detergents tested. SDS at 0.005% in the reaction mixtures completely abolished both WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and

WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ activities.

### Acceptor Substrate Specificities of WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$.

The acceptor substrate

specificities of purified WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ were tested with a series of synthetic acceptor

substrate analogs, including 8 and 14, GalNAc$\alpha$-glycopeptides, GalNAc $\alpha$- and $\beta$-linked to a number of

different hydrophobic aglycone groups, and GlcNAc derivatives (Table 1). The only two compounds in
this series that could serve as acceptor substrates were GalNAc-PP-PhU (8) and a fluorescent acceptor  
(GalNAc-PP-AnthrU) but not the corresponding GlcNAc analog GlcNAc-PP-PhU or any other GalNAc  
or GlcNAc derivative. This suggested that the presence of a diphosphate bridge in the acceptor as well as  
the axial 4-hydroxyl of the acceptor sugar were required for the activity of both WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and  
WbwC${}_{ECO5}$. The kinetic parameters for purified WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ were similar with apparent  
$K_{M}$ values of 0.12 mM and 0.10 mM, respectively, for GalNAc-PP-PhU, and apparent $V_{\text{max}}$ values of 1.57  
$\mu$mol/h/mg for WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and 1.42 $\mu$mol/h/mg for WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ (Fig.1). For UDP-Gal, the apparent $K_{M}$  
values for WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ were 0.73 mM and 1.20 mM, respectively, with apparent $V_{\text{max}}$  
values of 0.87 $\mu$mol/h/mg and 2.67 $\mu$mol/h/mg, respectively. At high acceptor concentration, substrate  
inhibition was observed. These values were similar to those obtained with crude enzymes.

Donor Specificities of WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$. The donor specificities of purified WbwC${}_{ECO104}$  
and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ were examined by replacing 0.435 mM UDP-[${}^{3}$H]Gal with a number of other nucleotide  
sugars in the assay at the same concentration. No activities were observed with UDP-[${}^{3}$H]Glc, UDP-  
[${}^{3}$H]GalNAc, UDP-[${}^{3}$H]GlcNAc, CMP-[${}^{3}$H]sialic acid or GDP-[${}^{3}$H]Man. This was indicative of a strict  
specificity of WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ for UDP-Gal as the donor substrate.

Analysis of WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ Reaction Products. To determine the structures of  
WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ reaction products, aliquots of assay mixtures were applied to Sep-Pak C18  
columns and enzyme reaction product eluted with MeOH. MALDI-MS analysis of the MeOH eluates  
showed the presence of substrate ($m/z$ 626) and enzyme product ($m/z$ 788) (data not shown). The Sep-Pak  
step was required for the efficient HPLC separation of the reaction product. On reversed-phase HPLC,  
using 24% acetonitrile/76% water as the mobile phase, the product Gal-GalNAc-PP-PhU eluted between  
35 and 45 min, well separated from substrate. The radioactive product served as a standard for HPLC.  
Pooled fractions containing purified reaction products showed $m/z$ 788 for Gal-GalNAc-PP-PhU by
MALDI-MS. This demonstrated that one Gal residue ($m/z$ 162) had been added to the substrate by both,  
WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$.  

**NMR Analysis of WbwC Reaction Products.** The ${}^{1}$H-NMR spectrum of the WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ product showed a new doublet at 4.41 ppm for H-1 of Gal with a coupling constant of $J_{1,2} = 8.3$ Hz, which is indicative of Gal in $\beta$-linkage (Table 2, Fig.2). By comparison, the spectrum of the enzyme reaction product of $\beta$3-GalT WbbD (Gal$\beta$1-3GlcNAc-PP-PhU) showed a similar chemical shift for Gal H-1 at 4.35 ppm (24). To determine whether Gal was $\beta$1-3, $\beta$1-4, or $\beta$1-6 linked to GalNAc, we conducted two-dimensional NMR experiments, including rotating-frame nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy (ROESY) (Fig.3) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), which identified the carbon and proton chemical shifts of the Gal and GalNAc residues (Table 2). The GalNAc H-3 signal of the substrate 8 (3.78–3.88 ppm) shifted to 4.00 in the WbwC reaction product. A large difference between substrate and product in the ${}^{13}$C signals was also seen for the GalNAc C-3 signal which was 66.9 ppm in the substrate and 77.1 ppm in the product. However, the GalNAc H-4 signal also shifted from 3.90–3.94 to 4.19 ppm in the product but neither H-6 nor C-4 or C-6 signals showed large differences between substrate and product. A strong coupling between Gal H-1 and GalNAc H-3 was seen in the ROESY spectrum (Fig.3), showing that Gal was indeed linked to the 3 position of GalNAc. The NMR spectra of WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ reaction product (data not shown) were virtually identical to those from WbwC${}_{ECO104}$. This identifies the product structures as Gal$\beta$1-3GalNAc$\alpha$-PP-PhU and proves that WbwC is a UDP-Gal: GalNAc-diphosphate-R $\beta$1,3-Gal-transferase.

**Glycosidase Digestions of WbwC Enzyme - Reaction Products.** Glycosidase digestions were used to confirm the anomeric linkage between Gal and GalNAc in the ${}^{[3]}$H]Gal-GalNAc-PP-PhU enzyme reaction products synthesized by WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$. The released free ${}^{[3]}$H]Gal was separated by AG1x8 columns that bound the uncleaved reaction product. WbwC${}_{ECO104}$ and WbwC${}_{ECO5}$ reaction products were resistant to green coffee bean $\alpha$-galactosidase and to Jack bean ($\beta$1-4-specific) $\beta$-
galactosidase indicating that Gal was not α-linked or in β1-4 linkage (Fig. 4). In contrast, treatment with

bovine testicular β-galactosidase that cleaves Gal in β1-3-, β1-4-, and β1-6-linkages released 41% and

36% of the radioactivity from WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> reaction products, respectively. O-glycanase is

an enzyme that cleaves O-glycan core 1, Galβ1-3GalNAcα-, from glycopeptides and core 1–linked

hydrophobic compounds but it was not known if the enzyme also acts on diphosphate-linked core 1

structures. Indeed, O-glycanase released 29% and 32% of the radioactivity from the disaccharide reaction

products of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>. This enzyme therefore acts on a variety of core 1-containing

glycoconjugates including those with negatively charged diphosphates attached to core 1. These results

confirm that the WbwC reaction products have the structure Galβ1-3GalNAcα-PP-PhU.

Cross reactivity of WbwC Enzyme Reaction Products with TF Antigen-specific Antibody. To test

whether the enzyme reaction products represented the TF antigen in spite of the presence of the

diphosphate group, aliquots of reaction products (50 nmol) were incubated with TF antigen-specific

antibody as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as the secondary

antibody. The complexes were then separated by C18 Sep-Pak which binds the hydrophobic

phenylundecyl moiety. As a positive control, core 1–benzyl was used, and as negative controls, the

substrate GalNAc-PP-PhU, the corresponding GlcNAc-PP-PhU, as well as the WbdN reaction product

Glcβ1-3GalNAcα-PP-PhU (23). After washing with water, MeOH elution fractions were concentrated

and applied to nitrocellulose membrane and stained for peroxidase activity. The results showed that after

separation by C18 Sep-Pak, only the positive control and WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> reaction products

stained positively for the TF antigen (Suppl. Fig. 5). It is interesting that Gal-GalNAc-PP-PhU bound to

C18 Sep-Pak in the presence of antibodies and that the core 1 structure was clearly recognised by the

antibody as the TF antigen, in spite of being linked to a charged diphosphate-lipid group. This confirms

that both WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> synthesized the TF antigen.

Role of Specific Amino Acids in WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> Activities. There are many positively charged amino acid residues in WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> that may possibly be involved in the binding of the negatively charged substrates, and we previously identified an essential Lys residue in Gal-transferase WfeD (25). The inclusion of 0.2 mM HPG in the assay mixture (without DTT) for purified WbwC enzymes showed 22% inhibition of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> activity and minimal inhibition of WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> activity (Fig.5). This suggested a potential role of Arg in protein structure or catalysis of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub>.

There are a number of conserved Cys residues in WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub>. In the absence of DTT, DTNB (0.2 mM), which reacts with reduced SH-groups, inhibited WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> activities by 49% and 81%, respectively, while 0.2 mM NEM showed 10% and 45% inhibition, respectively. In contrast, DTT (0.2 mM), which reduces disulfide bonds, stimulated WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> activities. β-Mercaptoethanol (18 mM) also increased the activities of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> by 30% and 75%, respectively (Fig.5). This suggested that enzymes may have formed disulfide bonds upon storage that interfered with activity, although these cytosolic enzymes are expected to be naturally in the reduced state. All of the Cys mutants of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> (C21A, C82A, C96A) were fully active, indicating that these Cys residues are not required for activity. Reagents that covalently bind to Cys-SH groups may thus lead to less active enzyme by blocking the access of substrates.

Importance of a novel DxDD motif for WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> Activity. Most inverting glycosyltransferases have a DxD motif which can contain an Asp or Glu residue representing a catalytic base (40). The WbwC sequences contain a DxDD motif that had not yet been recognized and is conserved mainly in β3-glycosyltransferases within the GT-2 family. To evaluate the role of these acidic amino acids, Asp residues were mutated to the neutral Ala in WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>. Mutations of any of the Asp residues within the DTDD sequence in WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and the DSDD sequence in WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> were found to drastically reduce the activities of both WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> (residues D91, D93, D94), and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> (residues D96, D98, D99). No activity was detected with mutants lacking the first Asp residue of the DxDD motif (D91A mutant of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and D96A mutant of WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>) (Fig.6). In contrast, none of

the other conserved Asp residues in the WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> enzyme appeared to contribute to catalysis, and  
D45A, D46A and D125A mutants had activities comparable to that of the wild type enzyme. All mutants  
were well expressed, shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blots (data not shown). This suggests that the  
WbwC enzyme family has a novel DxDD motif where the first Asp residue is essential and the remaining  
Asp residues are important for catalysis.  

Inhibition of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> Activity. A number of di-imidazolium salts, i.e. those  
having two positively charged imidazolium groups linked by aliphatic chains of 20 to 22 carbons,  
strongly inhibited WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> activities in the absence of DTT in the assay (Table 3).  
The solvents alone, without inhibitors (up to 10% in the assay) showed no effect. Especially compound  
QT 149 [1,22-Bis-(3-methyl-1H-imidazolium-1-yl)docosane dimesylate], having an aliphatic chain of 22  
carbons in length, effectively inhibited purified WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 8.0 μM  
and 17.6 μM, respectively. In contrast, inhibitors of mammalian β1,4-Gal-transferase (N-butyryl-  
glucosamine-β-1-thio-2-naphthyl) (29) and core 1 β1,3-Gal-transferase (N-butyryl-galactosamineα-Bn)  
(39) showed no inhibition.  

DISCUSSION  

Two similar enzymes, WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>, have been identified as UDP-Gal: GalNAca-  
diphosphate-lipid β1,3-D-Gal-transferases that catalyze the second step of the O antigen repeating unit  
assembly in *E. coli* serotypes O104 and O5, respectively. The enzymes have the same function in  
synthesizing the Galβ1-3GalNAc linkage and have very similar properties although the amino acid  
sequences show only 47% identity.  

Analyses of the structures of the WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> enzyme reaction products by HPLC,  
MS and NMR spectroscopy, digestions with galactosidases and O-glycanase as well as Western blots  
using TF antigen-specific antibody clearly showed that both WbwC enzymes add one Gal residue in β1-3

linkage to GalNAc-PP-PhU, an analog of the natural undecaprenyl-linked substrate. The reaction product structure corresponds to the disaccharide at the reducing end of the O104 and O5 antigen repeating unit and establishes WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> as the second enzymes in the respective O104 and O5 antigen repeating unit biosynthesis pathways.

There are several bacterial strains that have the internal Galβ1-3GalNAc linkage in their O antigen structures (14, 15, 42). The β1,3-Gal-transferase WbiP has been characterized from *E. coli* O127 which contains the internal Galβ1-3GalNAcα structure in the O antigen (37). WbiP synthesizes the Galβ1-3GalNAcα linkage but does not have a requirement for the diphosphate group in the acceptor and can act on free GalNAc, with a preference for the GalNAcα-linkage. Thus, a number of simple oligosaccharides serve as WbiP substrate and these assays do not require extensive chemical synthesis of complex sugar-phosphates. We described here improved syntheses of GalNAc-PP-PhU and GlcNAc-PP-PhU in this paper, which should enhance the characterization of other bacterial enzymes with yet unknown function that may require the diphosphate group in the acceptor substrate.

Like other characterized members of the GT-2 family, WbwC enzymes are typical inverting transferases, requiring divalent metal ion for activity and having DxD motifs (40, 41). We have shown in this study that all three Asp residues of the DxDD motif are required for full activity in both, WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>, with the first Asp being essential for activity and likely representing the catalytic base, and the other two Asp residues likely contributing to the acidic properties of the first Asp residue. Thus we identified a new DxDD motif that is found in several members of the GT-2 family. These enzymes have a predicted GT-A fold with the conserved DxDD motif in the N-terminal half of the protein (between amino acids 85 to 102). Most of these enzymes are inverting β1,3-glycosyltransferases, including β3Gal-transferases WbwC, WbbD, WbiP, WbgO, CgtB, LsgF, WbnJ and Eps6, and the β1,3- Glc-transferases WbdN, WfaP, WfgD. In β3Gal-transferase WbiP from *E. coli* the first and second Asp of the DxDD motif (Asp88 and Asp90) were mutated and suggested to be involved in UDP-Gal binding (37). Our study is the first to examine all three Asp residues of the DxDD motif. Interestingly, other

483 enzymes of the GT2 family that are not β3-glycosyltransferases, e.g. β1,4-Gal- or β1,4-Glc-transferases,
484 do not possess the DxDD motif. This suggests a functional importance of DxDD in the transfer of a Gal
485 or Glc residue to the 3-position of either GalNAc- or GlcNAc-containing acceptor substrates. We are
486 awaiting the crystal structure of one of these enzymes in order to confirm the role of the DxDD motif in
487 catalysis.
488 Another class of enzymes, the terpenoid cyclases also has a conserved DxDD motif (43,44). In
489 these enzymes, the Asp residues are thought to cooperatively act as catalytic acids. The multiple Asp
490 residues may thus enhance the ability of the catalytic Asp to protonate and in addition, in the terpenoid
491 cyclases, are involved in binding the inhibitory metal ion Mg²⁺.
492 The TF (or T) antigen has been recognized as an important tumor antigen that can be targeted for
493 the clinical development of carbohydrate-based anticancer vaccines (16,45). Various chemical strategies
494 have been developed to synthesize TF antigen-containing glycopeptides (46). CgtB, a β1,3-Gal-
495 transferase involved in the synthesis of the ganglioside-like Galβ1-3GalNAcβ- linkage found in the
496 lipo oligosaccharides of *Campylobacter jejuni* (47), prefers the β-linkage in the GalNAc-R acceptor but
497 also acts on GalNAcα-R substrates and can synthesize the linkage of the TF antigen structure. WbiP also
498 synthesizes the TF antigen but direct proof using anti TF antibody has not been provided although it is
499 likely that anti TF antigen antibodies bind the disaccharide Galβ1-3GalNAcα linked to a variety of
500 structures including oligosaccharides, peptides and hydrophobic aglycones. We showed here that the TF
501 antigen can also be linked to a diphosphate group. Thus, WbwC can be regarded as a T synthase
502 (16,17,39), and may be useful for a chemo-enzymatic synthesis of the TF antigen. The diphosphate group
503 can easily be removed with pyrophosphatases and phosphatases to yield the reducing TF disaccharide that
504 could further be linked to an aglycone group suitable for vaccine synthesis.
505 Human T synthase (core 1 β1,3-Gal-transferase, classified in the GT31 family of inverting
506 glycosyltransferases) that synthesizes the TF antigen in mucin type O-glycans has minimal sequence
507 identity with WbwC but may have a similar architecture at the catalytic site which remains to be

elucidated. In spite of similar properties of mammalian and bacterial Gal-transferases, it is interesting that human core 1 β1,3-Gal-transferase which transfers Gal to GalNAcα-benzyl does not accept GalNAcα-PP-PhU as a substrate and prefers peptide aglycones (39). In contrast, WbwC uses GalNAcα-PP-PhU as acceptor but not GalNAcα-benzyl or GalNAcα-peptides. Another difference between the human and bacterial enzymes is the inhibition by bis-imidazolium salts that inhibit WbwC but not the human enzyme. In contrast, N-butyryl-galactosamineα-Bn only inhibits human T synthase and not WbwC.

Both, WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>, are specific for the axial 4-hydroxyl of the GalNAc and the diphosphate in the acceptor substrate. The requirement for the diphosphate linked to GalNAc or GlcNAc in the acceptors appears to be a characteristic of the second enzymes in the O antigen assembly pathways which includes WbwC (22–25, 48, 49). It is not known, however, if the α-linkage of GalNAc is required and if both phosphate groups are necessary for high activity. Based on our experience, we expect that at least one phosphate residue directly linked to GalNAcα- is an absolute requirement for WbwC but this remains to be shown upon synthesis of the appropriate acceptor analogs (26, 50, 51). Previous studies showed that different lipid chains in the acceptor were compatible with high activities of Gal- and Glc- transferases (22, 24, 48). In the current study we used two acceptors that differed in the terminal ring structure in the aglycone, suggesting that the structure of the lipid moiety may be of minor importance for in vitro activity. The acceptors may form micelles where GalNAc-PP is exposed while the lipid moiety is enclosed; this may mimic the in vivo Und-linked substrates that are embedded in the inner membrane.

There are two other putative glycosyltransferase genes in the E. coli O104-antigen gene cluster (wbwA and wbwB) that may encode the α2,3-NeuNAc-transferase and α1,4-Gal-transferase necessary to sequentially complete the assembly of the O104 repeating unit (18). WbwC can be used to synthesize the substrate for the next step in O104 antigen synthesis and to determine the functions of the enzymes encoded by the wbwA and wbwB genes. The wzx and wzy genes in the O104 gene cluster are expected to encode a flippase and polymerase, respectively (2, 18, 52, 53) which indicates that the O104 antigen biosynthesis is governed by the Wzy-polymerase-dependent pathway (8, 9, 52).

All of the bacterial enzymes characterized to date that assemble O antigens appeared to lack a

transmembrane domain and probably reside close to the cytosolic face of the inner membrane with access

to both the soluble nucleotide sugar pools and the membrane-bound Und-substrates. Enzymes may be

tethered to the membrane by a yet unknown mechanism, possibly by an enzyme complex formation that

maintains their high activity. In our *in vitro* assays of recombinant enzymes this organization is lacking,

explaining why these glycosyltransferases often show relatively low activity in the purified form. The

acceptor substrate has detergent-like properties and may form micelles together with added detergents *in*

*vitro*. The fact that the two WbwC enzymes differ in their response to detergents may be due to a

characteristic recognition of substrates by the enzymes. The amino acid sequences of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and

WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> differ by 47% and different hydrophobic sequences may be exposed. However, the

enzymes have very similar characteristics; thus the amino acids essential for substrate binding and

catalysis and the dimensions of the active sites may be identical in both enzymes which remains to be

shown by protein structure analyses.

As the second enzyme in the O104 biosynthesis pathway, WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> is a suitable target for

blocking O104-antigen synthesis and thus reducing a virulence factor. The bis-imidazolium inhibitors are

interesting drug candidates. Specific bis-imidazolium salts inhibit selected glycosyltransferases (8,17)

with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 20 and 250 μM while WbwC showed relatively low IC<sub>50</sub> values of 8 to 18.6 μM.

These inhibitors probably bind properly spaced negatively charged and hydrophobic patches on the

enzyme and may distort protein structure or block either substrate binding or catalysis. Since bis-

imidazolium salts inhibit only selected Gal-transferases, the mechanism of inhibition may not involve

binding to negatively charged donor or acceptor substrates. Current investigations are aimed at

elucidating the mode of inhibition *in vitro* and in bacteria.

Our present study shows the thorough characterization of two bacterial enzymes that synthesize a

human-like antigen. This work provides a possible biotechnology approach for the synthesis of

functionally important bacterial and mammalian oligosaccharides.

FIGURE 1. Kinetics of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> reactions. The standard assay as described in Material and Methods was used to measure Gal transfer by purified WbwC enzymes. (A) WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> reaction with acceptor 8 (0.25 mM) as a function of UDP-Gal concentration. The apparent *K*<sub>M</sub> for UDP-Gal was 0.73 mM with an apparent *V*<sub>max</sub> of 0.87 μmol/h/mg protein. (B) WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> reaction as a

function of acceptor 8 concentration. UDP-Gal concentration was 2.2 mM. The apparent \( K_{\mathrm{M}} \) for 8 was

0.12 mM with an apparent \( V_{\max } \) of 1.57 μmol/h/mg protein. (C) WbwC\(_{\mathrm{ECO}5}\) reaction with 0.25 mM

acceptor 8 as a function of UDP-Gal concentration. The apparent \( K_{\mathrm{M}} \) for UDP-Gal was 1.20 mM with an

apparent \( V_{\max } \) of 2.67 μmol/h/mg protein. (D) WbwC\(_{\mathrm{ECO}5}\) reaction as a function of acceptor 8. UDP-Gal

donor concentration was 1.09 mM. The apparent \( K_{\mathrm{M}} \) for 8 was 0.10 mM with an apparent \( V_{\max } \) of 1.42

μmol/h/mg protein. Substrate inhibition was apparent at high acceptor concentration (not shown). All

results were analyzed by regression analysis with GraphPad Prism.

FIGURE 2. One-dimensional 600 MHz \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{NMR}\) spectra of WbwC\(_{\mathrm{ECO}104}\) Gal-transferase reaction

product measured in D\(_{2}\)O. WbwC\(_{\mathrm{ECO}104}\) and WbwC\(_{\mathrm{ECO}5}\) reaction products have a virtually identical

spectrum. Sample preparation was described in the Material and Methods section.

FIGURE 3. Two-dimensional 600 MHz ROESY spectrum of WbwC\(_{\mathrm{ECO}104}\) Gal-transferase reaction

product measured in D\(_{2}\)O. Experiments were performed at rt. There is a clear correlation between the Gal

H-1 and GalNAc H-3 signals indicating the Gal1-3GalNAc linkage.

FIGURE 4. Glycosidase digestion of WbwC reaction products. Product linkage confirmation using

glycosidase digestion on WbwC reaction products. The anomeric configuration of the linkage formed in

the radioactive enzyme product was determined by incubation with specific galactosidases or O-

glycanase. Mixtures were incubated for 30 min at \( 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) and applied to AG1x8 columns. Released

radioactivity was eluted and counted. The percentages of release of radioactive Gal (or Gal-GalNAc for

O-glycanase) are shown relative to the total radioactivity of WbwC reaction products in the assay. The

bars indicate variations between duplicates.

FIGURE 5. Effect of amino acid-specific reagents on activity of WbwC. Amino acid-specific reagents

were pre-incubated with purified enzyme for 10 min, prior to the assays as described in Material and

Methods. The activities are shown, relative to the positive control set to 100 (no addition of amino acid reagent). The bars indicate variations between duplicates. HPG, 0.2 mM hydroxyphenylglyoxal; DTNB, 0.2 mM 5,5′-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid; NEM, 0.2 mM *N*-ethylmaleimide; DTT, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol; beta-ME, 18 mM beta-mercaptoethanol.

FIGURE 6. Relative activities of site specific mutants of the DxDD motif of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub>. Mutants of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> were produced by replacing Asp with Ala as indicated and assayed as described in Material and Methods. WT is the wild type (unaltered controls of WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> and WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> set to 100). Relative activities are shown with error bars indicating differences in activities between multiple assays. Western blots showed that all mutants were well expressed.

The substrate for the WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> reaction was GalNAct-PO<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>3</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>-O-Ph 8 as described in Material and Methods. Enzyme reaction product was purified by Sep-Pak C18 column and reversed-phase HPLC. 600 MHz NMR spectra were collected in 1D and 2D experiments in D<sub>2</sub>O. Assignments were made by HSQC and ROESY spectra. The coupling constants were difficult to determine with certainty due to crowding of signals. The spectra for the WbwC<sub>ECO5</sub> reaction product were virtually identical to those shown for the WbwC<sub>ECO104</sub> reaction product.
