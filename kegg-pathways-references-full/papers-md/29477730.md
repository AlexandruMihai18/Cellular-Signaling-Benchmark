Host Cell Targeting by Enteropathogenic Bacteria T3SS Effectors

Laurie Pinaud,${}^{1,2}$ Philippe J. Sansonetti,${}^{1,2,3}$ and Armelle Phalipon${}^{1,2,*}$

Microbial pathogens possess a diversity of weapons that disrupt host homeostasis and immune defenses, thus resulting in the establishment of infection. The best-characterized system mediating bacterial protein delivery into target eukaryotic cells is the type III secretion system (T3SS) expressed by Gram-negative bacteria, including the human enteric pathogens *Shigella*, *Salmonella*, *Yersinia*, and enteropathogenic/enterohemorrhagic *Escherichia coli* (EPEC/EHEC). The emerging global view is that these T3SS-bearing pathogens share similarities in their ability to target key cellular pathways such as the cell cytoskeleton, trafficking, cell death/survival, and the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In particular, multiple host proteins are targeted in a given pathway, and different T3SS effectors from various pathogens share functional similarities.

### T3SS Effectors Have Convergent Strategies to Target Host Cells

Contamination with *Shigella*, *Salmonella*, *Yersinia*, and EPEC/EHEC occurs via the fecal–oral route, through person-to-person transmission, and/or ingestion of contaminated food or water. These bacteria reach the gastrointestinal tract and cause a diversity of severe-to-moderate acute gastroenteritis. A key component of their pathogenicity relies on the presence of a type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) delivering bacterial proteins called effectors directly into the host cell cytoplasm. The T3SA and effectors constitute the T3SS [1]. *Shigella* and *Salmonella* invade a wide variety of cells. While *Shigella* T3SS mediates bacterial escape from the phagocytic vacuole and dissemination to neighboring cells [2], the successive action of *Salmonella* pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2 T3SS enables *Salmonella* to reside and replicate within an intracellular compartment named the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole (SCV) [3,4]. *Yersinia pseudotuberculosis* and *Yersinia enterocolitica* (hereafter often referred to as *Yersinia*) initially cross the epithelium lining, and then target the mesenteric lymph nodes where they remain mostly extracellular by preventing their phagocytosis through the action of translocated T3SS effectors [5]. By contrast, EPEC/EHEC do not cross the epithelium lining and reside on the apical side of enterocytes, from where their T3SS effectors mediate the formation of a characteristic pedestal [6].

Despite their different lifestyle, the above-mentioned enteropathogenic bacteria have developed similar strategies to modulate key host cell functions through the large panel of their T3SS effectors. These effectors may also display antagonistic effects towards a given pathway within the infection time course, demonstrating how much the targeting is temporally regulated. In the recent past, this topic was regularly covered by reviews that mostly focused either on one pathogen or on a given pathway. Putting into perspective the strategies displayed by these enterobacteria aims to illustrate the diversity of host protein–T3SS effector interactions with their similarities and differences. The previous review of that type dates from 2013 [7], and here we provide an update which focuses mainly on the targeting of host cell cytoskeleton,

**Highlights**

trafficking, death/survival pathways, and NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, we review the targeting mechanisms towards host immune cells required for mounting specific adaptive immunity.

# Targeting of the Host Cell Cytoskeleton

Several T3SS effectors modulate the host cell cytoskeleton to establish infection. The actin network is one of their main targets, through direct interactions or modulations of host proteins that regulate its dynamics. An important group of such proteins is the Rho family of small GTPases (sGTPases) that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form through the activities of guanine exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) [8]. The main purpose of bacteria-mediated modulations of actin is to favor or prevent bacterium internalization to establish the intracellular or extracellular niche. Therefore, the mechanisms modulated by *Salmonella* and *Shigella* to promote their internalization (Figure 1) and those developed by *Yersinia* and EPEC/EHEC to avoid phagocytosis are described separately (Figure 2).

*Shigella* IpgB1/IpgB2 and *Salmonella* SopE/SopE2 display a GEF activity towards sGTPases, thus promoting the actin-based plasma membrane (PM) ruffles required for bacterial internalization [9]. These ruffles are amplified by the phosphatase activity of *Shigella* IpgD and *Salmonella* SopB/SigD that induces activation at the PM of Arf6 [10,11], a sGTPase from the Arf family that participates in actin organization and endocytosis [8]. Afterwards, host cell recovery from ruffling is promoted by *Salmonella* SptP that displays a GAP activity [12]. Other host proteins modulating actin dynamics, and actin itself, are also targeted: *Salmonella* SipA stabilizes actin filaments and inhibits binding of actin depolymerization factors [13], while *Salmonella* SopB, *Shigella* IpaC, and IpaA recruit SNX18, Src, and vinculin, respectively, at the site of entry. The kinase activity of Src and the proposed role of SNX18 as a scaffold protein both favor actin polymerization for bacterial entry [14,15]. The capping of actin filaments by vinculin is suggested to prevent the growth of actin protrusions at the site of *Shigella*-cell contact that would otherwise repel the bacterium [16].

Interactions of T3SS effectors with the microtubule (MT) and intermediate filament (IF) networks have been poorly investigated to date. *Shigella* VirA has been suggested to induce MT depletion through proteolytic activity to facilitate bacterial movement within the host cytoplasm following vacuolar escape, but this remains controversial [17,18]. By contrast, *Salmonella* SseJ prevents MT collapse, providing a solid network around the SCV [19], whose perinuclear localization is facilitated by SifA interaction with the host protein SKIP that inactivates the MT motor kinesin [20]. In the case of IF, *Shigella* IpaC and *Salmonella* SptP and SipC bind the IF components vimentin and/or cytokeratins. *Shigella* IpaC/vimentin interaction participates in the docking of the T3SA to the PM [21], *Salmonella* SptP dephosphorylates vimentin to prevent formation of proinflammatory signaling complexes [22], and SipC/cytokeratin-18 interaction facilitates invasion through an unknown mechanism [23].

In contrast to *Salmonella* and *Shigella*, EPEC/EHEC and *Yersinia* remain extracellular by blocking phagocytosis through modulation of sGTPases and other actin regulators by their translocated T3SS effectors. Inactivation of sGTPases occurs by several mechanisms: EPEC/EHEC EspH binds and inhibits host GEFs [24], *Yersinia* YopE displays a GAP activity [25], *Yersinia* YopT cysteine protease removes sGTPase post-translational modifications necessary for their membrane attachment [26], and *Yersinia* YpkA/YopO sequesters GDP-bound Rho sGTPases [27]. Other host proteins, or actin itself, are also targeted to prevent phagocytosis. For instance, *Yersinia* YpkA/YopO binds actin monomers and displaces actin-binding proteins

Figure 1. *Shigella* and *Salmonella* Targeting of Cytoskeleton Components. Red: *Shigella* IpgB1 and IpgB2 activate sGTPases to induce actin-mediated PM ruffles, further promoted by IpaC recruitment of the Src kinase and IpgD-mediated modification of PM lipid composition and Arf6 recruitment. IpaA binds vinculin to prevent formation of repellent actin protrusions at bacteria–cell contacts. Docking of the T3SA could be favored by IpaC interaction with intermediate filament components. VirA is proposed to destabilize microtubules to promote bacterial entry and intracytoplasmic movements, but this remains controversial. Blue: *Salmonella* SopE and SopE2 activate sGTPases to promote actin-mediated PM ruffles, favored by SopB-mediated modification of PM lipid composition and Arf6 recruitment and SipA interaction with actin filaments that prevents ADF binding. At the bacterial entry site, SNX18 recruitment promotes actin rearrangements through a scaffolding activity, and SipC and SptP bind intermediate filament components, which is suggested to promote entry and shutdown of proinflammatory signaling complexes, respectively. Following internalization, SptP GAP activity reverses sGTPase activation to help the cell recover from membrane ruffling. The internalization vacuole matures into an intracellular replicative niche (the SCV) whose perinuclear positioning is ensured by SseJ that provides a solid network around the SCV. Broken lines indicate unknown mechanisms.

[28,29], EPEC/EHEC EspG sequesters Arf6 and Arf1 to prevent actin polymerization through their collaboration with the sGTPase Rac1 [30], and EspB binds to myosin to inhibit pseudopod extension and phagosome closure [31]. Lastly, phagocytosis signaling is directly blocked by *Yersinia* YopH phosphatase activity towards host proteins [32], EPEC/EHEC EspF-mediated inhibition of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) activation [33,34], and EPEC/EHEC EspJ blockage of Src kinase activity [35].

In addition to phagocytosis blocking, EPEC/EHEC T3SS effectors hijack cytoskeleton components to form the intracellular pedestal, allowing attachment of the extracellular bacterium. To this end, the T3SS effectors Tir, EspF, and EspH recruit host proteins, including N-WASP

Green: EPEC/EHEC Tir/TccP, EspF, and EspH recruit host proteins to mediate the formation of the characteristic actin-rich pedestal that is further regulated by EspW, EspM1/M2, and Map. Tir interaction with IF also contributes to pedestal formation, while binding of IF by EspF has unknown consequences. Actin stress fibers are induced upon RhoA activation by EspM GEF activity and MT destabilization by EspG/EspG2 that releases the host GEF GEF-H1. Transient filopodia are induced by Map GEF activity towards Cdc42, but Tir blocks ultimate bacterium uptake by M-cells. Actin rearrangements are further downregulated by EspH and EspB that binds and inhibits host GEFs and myosin, respectively. EspF and EspJ further block phagocytosis through inhibition of PI3K and Src signaling, respectively. Atypical EPEC strains mediate their invasion through EspT GEF activity towards Rac1 and Cdc42. Orange: *Yersinia* prevents its uptake by phagocytic cells through inactivation of sGTPases by YopT protease, YopE GAP, and YopO/YpkA sequestration of GDP-bound sGTPases. YopO/YpkA also sequesters actin monomers and deregulates actin-binding proteins to prevent actin rearrangements necessary for phagocytosis. In addition, YopH phosphatase shuts down phagocytosis by dephosphorylating key host proteins involved in signaling. Broken lines indicate unknown mechanisms.

and Arp2/3, to orchestrate actin polymerization beneath the point of contact between the bacterium and the host cell [36]. Recently, EHEC EspW has been shown to activate the sGTPase Rac1 by an unknown mechanism, participating in these actin rearrangements [37]. The IF network is also involved in the pedestal structure through binding of cytokeratin-18 by Tir [38]. Of note, EspF also interacts with cytokeratin-18, resulting in its redistribution, but the consequences of this phenomenon remain to be clarified [39]. Lastly, pedestal formation is regulated by EPEC/EHEC Map and EspM2 but the mechanisms remain unclear [40,41]. These T3SS effectors also display a GEF activity that induces transient filopodia, whose formation is downregulated by Tir to avoid internalization, and actin stress fibers at the basal pole of infected cells [42,43]. These actin stress fibers are reinforced through EspG/EspG2-mediated depletion of MTs by an unidentified mechanism, resulting in release of the host GEF GEF-H1 that activates the sGTPase RhoA [44]. Of note, EspT expressed by atypical invasive EPEC strains

displays a GEF activity that mediates actin-based PM ruffles allowing the bacterium to invade nonphagocytic cells [45].

This section illustrates the diversity of mechanisms leading to internalization of enterobacteria or prevention of their phagocytosis with some common host cell cytoskeleton components targeted by different T3SS effectors resulting in opposite effects.

**Targeting of Host Cell Trafficking**

Numerous T3SS effectors target trafficking pathways to modulate host cell surface receptor signaling, secretion of immunomodulatory molecules, and bacterial persistence in, or escape from, the phagocytic vacuole. Two main targets are the Rab and Arf families of sGTPases, governing membrane trafficking in host cells [8]. To our knowledge, there are no reports to date on the impact of *Yersinia* on host cell trafficking; thus, only T3SS effectors of *Shigella*, *Salmonella*, and EPEC/EHEC are discussed (Figure 3).

Endocytosis is promoted by *Shigella* IpgD phosphatase through modification of PM lipid composition. While maturation of ICAM-1-containing endosomes results in cargo degradation and downregulation of neutrophil adhesion to infected epithelial cells [46], maturation of EGFR-containing endosomes is delayed, inducing a sustained EGFR signaling that favors epithelial cell survival [47,48]. Of note, the phosphatase activity of *Shigella* IpgD, and of its *Salmonella* homolog SopB/SigD, decreases PM tension, contributing to bacterial entry [49,50]. Whether SopB modulates endocytosis similarly to IpgD is unknown.

Upon infection, blockage of the host secretory pathway is often observed as a result of T3SS effector-mediated alterations of the anterograde endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport. *Shigella* IpaJ impairs Arf1 anchorage at the Golgi [51], *Shigella* VirA, and EPEC/EHEC EspG GAPs inactivate Rab1 [52], and EPEC/EHEC NleA hijacks the Sec24 subunit of the COPII coat protein at the ER [53]. Cell-surface receptor recycling is also affected by T3SS effectors, such as EPEC/EHEC EspG-mediated inactivation of Rab35-recycling endosomes [54] and *Shigella* IpaB-induced massive recruitment of cholesterol to the site of bacterial entry, inducing Golgi fragmentation and recycling endosome tubulation [55]. Of note, IpaB-mediated fragmentation of the Golgi affects the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport, which is also slowed down by EHEC NleF interaction with the COPI receptor Tmp21 [56]. The functional consequence of this blocking in the infection context is unknown.

After their internalization, *Shigella* and *Salmonella* exhibit different strategies. On the one hand, several *Shigella* T3SS effectors contribute to the rupture of the vacuole membrane, leading to the release of the bacteria into the cytoplasm. Recently, the involvement of cellular components, such as Rab11, have been proposed but the molecular mechanism remains to be defined [57]. On the other hand, *Salmonella* replicates within the phagocytic vacuole, leading to the formation of the SCV. T3SS effectors mostly hijack the host endosomal system to establish this niche. At the site of bacterial entry, SipC redirects exocytic vesicles to locally increase the amount of PM available for the formation of invaginations, allowing bacterial uptake [58]. Similarly, at the SCV membrane, SopE GEF activity towards Rab5 promotes fusion with early endosomes, probably providing the membrane necessary to increase the SCV size as bacteria replicate [59]. SCV perinuclear positioning is at least in part due to SseF and SseG interaction with GCP60 at the Golgi [60]. Besides, SifA and SopD2 activities prevent bacterial degradation that would occur upon fusion of the SCV with late endosomes and lysosomes. SifA interaction with SKIP subverts the Rab9-dependent retrograde trafficking of mannose-6-phosphate receptors responsible for hydrolase transportation from the Golgi to endosomes,

Figure 3. *Shigella*, *Salmonella*, and Enteropathogenic/Enterohemorrhagic *Escherichia coli* (EPEC/EHEC) Targeting of Cell Trafficking.

Red: *Shigella* promotes bacterial entry through enhanced PM fluidity mediated by conversion of PIP₂ into PI5P by IpgD. This PI5P increase blocks EGFR into EE and mediates ICAM-1 degradation into lysosomes, resulting in sustained EGFR signaling and decreased neutrophil attachment to infected cells, respectively. Mechanisms of *Shigella* vacuolar rupture remain incompletely understood, but IpaH7.8, IpgD recruitment of Rab11 and IpaB/IpaC translocon proteins have been proposed to contribute to this process. The host secretory pathway is affected by IpaB-induced Golgi and recycling endosomes disruption, through cholesterol redistribution, and by VirA inactivation of Rab1 and IpaJ-mediated detachment of Arf1 from the Golgi apparatus.

Blue: *Salmonella* similarly promotes its uptake through a PM PI5P increase mediated by SopB/SigD. SipC/exocyst and SopE/Rab5 interactions are suggested to provide the membrane necessary for entry invaginations and SCV growth, respectively. SCV localization is promoted by SseF/SseG anchoring at the Golgi GCP60 protein. SifA/SKIP sequestration of Rab9 interferes with retrograde transport of MPR to the Golgi, thus impairing hydrolases addressing to endosomes, which are therefore less potent to lyse the SCV content. In addition, SopD2 interaction with Rab7 interferes with lysosome fusion to the SCV.

Green: EPEC/EHEC interfere with host trafficking pathways via EspG-mediated impairment of receptor recycling to the PM, EspG inactivation of Rab1, NleA interference with the COPII component Sec24, and NleF interaction with Tmp21. Broken lines indicate unknown mechanisms.

generating less potent lysosomes [61]. SopD2 binding to Rab7 prevents interaction with host proteins and MT motors that would otherwise direct the SCV towards late endosomes and lysosomes [62]. Lastly, *Salmonella* T3SS effectors are involved in the characteristic protrusions emanating from the SCV called SIFs (*Salmonella*-induced filaments), but neither the biogenesis nor the roles of these structures are clearly established [63].

Overall, modulation of endocytosis and interaction with intracellular compartments allow *Shigella* and *Salmonella* to deploy their intracellular cycle. The impairment of the secretary

pathway by the three pathogens is likely to limit the cell-to-cell dialog to delay their clearance by the host.

# Disruption of Epithelium Integrity, One Key Consequence of T3SS Targeting of the Cytoskeleton and Intracellular Trafficking

The cytoskeleton and intracellular trafficking contribute to the maintenance of the physical barrier formed by the epithelium through diverse cellular junctions between adjacent cells. Alteration of epithelium integrity by T3SS effectors mostly occurs through targeting of one type of these multiprotein complexes, the tight junctions (TJs). This has been reported in particular for several EPEC/EHEC T3SS effectors [64], Salmonella SopB, SopE/SopE2 and SipA [65], Shigella IpgB1/IpgB2 and IpaB [55,66], and Yersinia YopE [67] – through modulation of actin dynamics or protein trafficking. Sequestration of TJ proteins to the EPEC pedestal and Shigella actin comet tails also disrupts TJ structure [68], and the phosphatase activity of Salmonella SopB/SigD and Shigella IpgD mediates opening of TJs and inhibition of ion flux across membranes [69]. In fact, Shigella OspE1/E2 reinforce attachment of epithelial cells to the basement membrane by stabilizing focal adhesions [70], which might slow down epithelium destruction induced by Shigella-mediated TJ destabilization. Overall, alteration by T3SS effectors of the two other types of cell–cell junctions, desmosomes and adherens junctions, deserves further investigation.

# Targeting of Host Cell Death/Survival Pathways

T3SS-expressing enterobacteria have developed mechanisms that finely tune host cell death and survival pathways. Indeed, pathogen-mediated killing of immune and epithelial cells impairs the proper functioning of the immune system, but, in parallel, host cell survival has to be promoted to maintain a replicative niche for intracellular and PM-attached pathogens. Pyroptosis and apoptosis are the two main host cell death pathways targeted by T3SS effectors and are discussed below (Figures 4 and 5).

Pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death, is induced upon sensing of microbial components by cytoplasmic sensors such as Nod-like receptors (NLRs, including NLRP3 and NLRC4), pyrin, and caspases-4/5. These sensors mediate assembly of multiprotein complexes termed inflammasomes. The subsequent activation of caspase-1 leads to the cleavage of IL-1β and IL-18 precursors into their active forms, resulting in inflammation that is key for the host to combat infection, but that can also benefit the pathogen. In macrophages, inflammasome activation is triggered by detection of various T3SA components: Shigella MxiI/MxiH, Salmonella SPI-1 PrgJ/Prgl, Yersinia YopB/YopD, and EPEC/EHEC EscI [71–74]. Macrophage pyroptosis is further promoted by Shigella IpaH7.8 interference with glomulin-mediated repression of canonical inflammasome activation [71]. By contrast, Yersinia restricts macrophage pyroptosis through YopK blockage of YopB/YopD hyper-injection [73] and YopM inhibition of YopE- and YopT-mediated activation of pyrin [75,76]. Also, EPEC/EHEC NleA binds to NLRP3 to avoid its activation [74]. How the opposite effects of EPEC/EHEC T3SS effectors on NLRP3 and NLRP3 activation add up to affect macrophage pyroptosis is unknown. At later stages of infection, Salmonella dampens macrophage pyroptosis through downregulation of expression of genes encoded by SPI-1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) modifications, and absence of sensing of the SPI-2 T3SA component Ssal [72], highlighting the necessity for Salmonella to limit death of macrophages, a niche for its replication. In epithelial cells, engagement of cytoplasmic sensors is blocked by EPEC/EHEC NleF and Shigella OspC3 and IpgD, preserving this biological niche. NleF and OspC3 inhibit activation of caspase-4, and IpgD blocks release of extracellular ATP, which is a potent NLRP3 activator [71,74].

Red: Shigella mediates macrophage pyroptosis through MxiH/Mxil recognition by NLRC4, IpaH7.8 ubiquitination, and degradation of glomulin and IpaB-mediated activation of caspase-1. By contrast, Shigella OspC3 promotes epithelial cell resistance to noncanonical caspase-4-inflammasome activation, and IpgD prevents release of eATP that can be recognized by NLRP3. Blue: Salmonella induces macrophage pyroptosis through SPI-1 PrgJ/Prgl recognition by NLRC4, SipB activation of caspase-1, and SopE activation of sGTPases. Inflammasome activation in epithelial cells promotes expulsion of Salmonella-infected cells but has not been linked to particular T3SS effectors (not depicted here). Green: EPEC/EHEC Escl recognition by NLRC4 induces macrophage pyroptosis, while NleA counteracts EHEC-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In epithelial cells, NleF prevents noncanonical inflammasome activation through inhibition of caspase-4. Orange: Yersinia induces macrophage pyroptosis via YopB/YopD activation of canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes and T3SS-independent mechanisms, increasing IL-18 precursor expression. These effects are counteracted by YopK, YopH, YopE, and YopM at different steps of the inflammasome cascade, thus preventing inflammation. In addition, YopJ modulates pyroptosis in macrophages depending on macrophage activation status, and YopT/YopE activation of the canonical pyrin inflammasome is counteracted by YopM.

Red: *Shigella* IpgD inhibits apoptosis of epithelial cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway that blocks proapoptotic signaling to the mitochondria and induces Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. The p53 response induced by T3SS-dependent genotoxic stress is further blocked through VirA activation of calpain.

Blue: *Salmonella* also promotes epithelial cell survival via the PI3-K/Akt pathway stimulated by SopB phosphatase activity. In addition, SseK1/SseK3 inhibits TNFα-mediated apoptosis. By contrast, SipB induces macrophage apoptosis through activation of the initiator caspase-2.

Orange: *Yersinia* YopP/YopJ promotes macrophage apoptosis through activation of caspase-8. Proapoptotic effects mediated by YopM, YpkA, and YopH on macrophages, T cells, and epithelial cells have been reported for *Yersinia pestis*.

Green: EPEC/EHEC Map and EspF induce apoptosis through mitochondria destabilization and caspase-3 activation. By contrast, NleH, EspZ, and NleF inhibit proapoptotic signaling, and NleB1/NleB2 specifically block the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Broken lines indicate unknown mechanisms.

Abbreviations: PM, plasma membrane; PIP₂, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI5P, phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate; Cyt-c, cytochrome c; Casp, caspase; T3SS-dep, T3SS-dependent.

Steps downstream of inflammasome assembly are also targeted by T3SS effectors. In particular, in macrophages, binding of *Shigella* IpaB or *Salmonella* SPI-1 SipB to caspase-1 promotes its activation, in contrast to YopM from some *Yersinia* strains that inhibits it. YopJ is also involved but its action seems to depend on macrophage activation status [71–73]. In epithelial cells, modulation of sGTPases by T3SS effectors also affects caspase-1 activation. This has been shown for *Salmonella* SopE GEF [77], contributing to expulsion of infected cells into the intestinal lumen, and *Yersinia* YopE GAP that blocks NLRP3 inflammasome signaling.

[78]. This blockade is reinforced through YopH-mediated neutralization of an increase in IL-18 precursor expression induced independently from the T3SS [78].

Apoptosis is characterized by mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and/or activation of caspase-8, following intracellular signals and death receptor signaling, respectively. Both result in activation of effector caspases that lead to degradation of host proteins. Some T3SS effectors interfere with the initial steps of apoptosis in epithelial cells to promote the formation of a niche. For instance, EPEC/EHEC NleB1/NleB2 blocks death receptor signaling [79], Salmonella SseK1/Ssek3 inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis [80], and *Shigella* IpgD and *Salmonella* SopB/SigD antagonize the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through PI5P-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt [81,82]. Upon *Shigella* infection, p53 is activated by a T3SS-dependent genotoxic stress, proposed to induce NF-κB-mediated inhibition of antiapoptotic gene expression [83]. Akt activation by IpgD counteracts this p53 response through activation of the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, the main cellular antagonist of p53 [83]. *Shigella* VirA further promotes p53 degradation through calcium-dependent activation of the cysteine protease calpain [83], an effect that is restricted by IpgD activity at the early stages of infection [84].

In addition, some T3SS effectors modulate downstream steps of apoptosis at the level of mitochondria and caspases. For instance, *Yersinia* YopP/YopJ activates caspase-8 in nonactivated macrophages [73]. In *Yersinia pestis*, YopH mediates mitochondria-induced cell death of T lymphocytes and epithelial cells through unclear mechanisms [85], while YopM and YpkA activate the effector caspase-3 in macrophages and/or epithelial cells [5,86]. Whether the same effects are observed in *Y. enterocolitica* and/or *Y. pseudotuberculosis* remains to be determined. Besides, several EPEC/EHEC T3SS effectors target the mitochondrial pathway: Map disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) through an unidentified mechanism [87], and EspF inhibits Abcf2, a putative host factor interfering with caspase-3 cleavage [88]. These effects are limited by NleH interaction with the Bax inhibitor BI-1 [89], EspZ-mediated stabilization of MMP [90], and NleF inhibition of caspases-8/9 activity [91]. Lastly, *Salmonella* mediates cytochrome c release and macrophage apoptosis through SipB activation of caspase-2 via a still unclear mechanism [92].

In summary, three types of strategy emerge. *Shigella* and *Salmonella* trigger macrophage pyroptosis to promote an inflammatory response that contributes to efficient invasion of the intestinal barrier. By contrast, *Yersinia* avoids the triggering of an inflammatory response by limiting macrophage pyroptosis but favoring their apoptosis to survive extracellularly. EPEC/EHEC limits the induction of pyroptosis and controls epithelial cell apoptosis to ensure its niche.

**Manipulation of NF-κB and MAPK Signaling Pathways**

T3SS effectors modulate the critical NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades to regulate host inflammatory signals downstream of cytokine receptors or pathogen sensing (Figure 6).

The first step in the induction of these pathways is activation of the host kinase TAK1, which is mediated by adaptor proteins, cytoplasmic NLRs, kinases, and TNR receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). *Salmonella* SPI-1, SopE/E2, and SopB modulations of sGTPases mediate TAK1 activation in epithelial cells through NOD1 detection, contributing to the highly proinflammatory environment generated by macrophage pyroptosis upon infection [93,94]. Later on, intestinal inflammation is downregulated by *Salmonella* SPI-2 T3SS effectors (see below). Through the same NOD1-activation mechanism, EspT expressed by atypical invasive EPEC strains and *Shigella* OspB and IpgB2 are sensed in macrophages or epithelial cells and activate TAK1 [95,96]. Counteraction of this activation is mediated by other T3SS effectors. In

Figure 6. Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Enteropathogenic/Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC/EHEC) Targeting of NF-κB and MAPK Signaling Pathways. Red: At the early stages of infection, Shigella promotes inflammation through OspB and IpgB2 activation of sGTPases. OspB further activates p38 and ERK, inducing activation of cPLA2 that mediates the release of PMN chemoattractants. At later stages, Shigella dampens host immune responses through IpaH and Ospl blockage of steps upstream of TAK1, OspF inhibition of active MAPKs and OspG, IpaH4.5, OspZ and IpaH9.8 alteration of NF-κB signaling. Blue: Salmonella SPI-1-encoded SopB and SopE/E2 mediate initial activation of proinflammatory signals through sGTPase stimulation. Later on, SPI-1 AvrA, SPI-2 SpvC, SpvD, SseL, SspH1, and GogB dampen MAPK and NF-kB signals. Of note, in macrophages, SseK1/SseK3 blocks TNFα-induced signaling to TRAFs. Orange: Yersinia blocks MAPK and NF-κB signals at the level of TRAFs through the deubiquitinase activity of YopP/J. This effector also prevents IkBα degradation and has an acetyltransferase activity that interferes with JNK, p38, and IKK complex activation. YopE impairs MAPK activation via an unknown mechanism. Green: While atypical invasive EspT-expressing EPEC strains activate proinflammatory signals through sGTPase stimulation, Tir, NleB, and NleE interfere with TRAF signaling. The proteases NleD and NleC cleave activated MAPKs and the p65 subunit of NF-κB, respectively. Despite NleF promoting NF-κB signaling, NleH1 prevents nuclear translocation of RPS3, a component of NF-κB transcription complexes. Broken lines indicate unknown mechanisms.

macrophages, Salmonella SPI-2 SseK1/SseK3 block TNFα-induced signaling to TRAFs [80], EPEC/EHEC Tir interacts with TRAF6 to prevent its ubiquitination [97], and Yersinia YopP/YopJ deubiquitinates TRAF2/6 [98,99]. In epithelial cells, Shigella IpaH1 and EPEC/EHEC Tir mediate TRAF2 proteasomal degradation [100,101]. Downstream of TRAFs, Shigella OspI deamidase inhibits the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc13 [102], and EPEC/EHEC NleB glycosyltransferase targets GAPDH to prevent its interaction with TRAF2 [103]. Both processes impair polyubiquitination required for signaling. Lastly, EPEC NleE inactivates TAK1 directly through a methyltransferase activity [104].

The next steps in NF-κB and MAPK pathways are mediated by activated TAK1. On the one hand, TAK1 activates the regulatory IkB kinase (IKK) complex that releases the cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-κB by IkBa. In epithelial cells, IKK activation is prevented by Shigella IpaH9.8 ubiquitin ligase and Yersinia YopP/YopJ acetylase [105,106]. Salmonella SPI-2 SseL and GogB, Yersinia YopJ in macrophages, and Shigella OspG in epithelial cells interfere with the ubiquitination steps required for IkBa degradation after its phosphorylation by IKK [99,107–109]. NF-κB release is also directly affected in epithelial cells by the targeting of its p65 subunit by EPEC NleC protease and Shigella IpaH4.5 ubiquitin ligase [110,111]. On the other hand, TAK1 and the IKK complex activate the MAPKs p38/JNK and ERK1/2, respectively. Activation of JNK and p38 is impaired by EPEC/EHEC NleD protease [110] and by *Y*. enterocolitica YopJ and Salmonella SPI-1 AvrA acetyltransferase-mediated inhibition of kinases downstream of TAK1 [112]. *Y*. pseudotuberculosis YopE also inhibits activation of MAPKs, but the precise mechanism remains to be defined [113]. In contrast to these T3SS effectors, Shigella OspB mediates ERK1/2 and p38 activation, resulting in the stimulation of neutrophil chemoattractant release through activation of the cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) [114]. Recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection destabilizes the epithelial barrier, thus promoting Shigella invasion of the colonic mucosa.

The last step of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways consists in the translocation into the nucleus of freed NF-κB and active MAPKs, inducing transcription of proinflammatory, survival, and proliferative genes. While NF-κB nuclear translocation is promoted by EPEC/EHEC NleF via an unknown mechanism to favor IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells during early infection [115], it is blocked by the interaction of Salmonella SPI-2 SpvD with the nuclear transport machinery [116] and by Shigella OspZ [117]. Whether OspZ mediates this effect through targeting of TAK1, similarly to its EPEC NleE homolog [104], remains to be determined. NF-κB-dependent gene expression might be further inhibited by Shigella IpaH9.8 and Salmonella SPI-2 SspH1 ubiquitin ligases in the nucleus via an undefined mechanism [118], and by EPEC/EHEC NleH1 sequestration in the cytoplasm of the RPS3 subunit of NF-κB transcriptional complexes [119]. Moreover, Shigella OspF and Salmonella SPI-2 SpvC phosphothreonine lyases irreversibly inactivate MAPK in the nucleus [120]. This OspF activity impacts the phosphorylation status of epigenetic regulators and results in a decrease in chromatin accessibility to transcription factors such as NF-κB, thus dampening host immune responses [121,122].

Considering the multiple steps at which downregulation of these pathways occur, and the diversity of T3SS effectors involved, it turns out that controlling the level of inflammation during these infections is key to limit both bacteria killing and host death.

**Targeting of Host Immune Cells Required for Mounting Specific Adaptive Immunity**

Most of the studies on T3SS effectors rely on intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages, thus documenting essentially the manipulation of the host innate response. Nevertheless, the gut

mucosa is the largest immune organ of the human body, including dendritic cells (DCs) and B and T lymphocytes that are encountered by bacteria upon crossing the epithelial barrier. However, T3SS-mediated interference with the host adaptive immunity is less documented.

In vivo studies in mice have shown that T3SS-mediated targeting of lymphocytes occurs upon Yersinia and Salmonella infection. Whereas for Salmonella the functional impact of this targeting is unknown [123], in Yersinia it results in an increase of B cell-surface activation markers, but the effectors involved are unknown [124, 125]. In vivo, B cells are invaded by Salmonella in an SPI-1 T3SS-dependent manner, suggesting that they might thus serve as a reservoir for long-term infections [126]. T3SS-dependent targeting of B and T lymphocytes has also been observed upon Shigella infection using ex vivo infection of human colonic tissue explants [127] and in vivo infection of rabbit ligated ileal loops [128], respectively. In vitro, Shigella poorly infects B lymphocytes, but triggers their apoptotic death upon interaction of IpaD, the protein at the tip of the T3SA needle, with TLR2 expressed at the surface of some B cell subsets [127]. This in vitro-observed effect might recapitulate what is observed on infected patient biopsies [127]. Another T3SS-effector-mediated mechanism that directly modulates lymphocyte function is illustrated by *Y. pseudotuberculosis* YopH phosphatase. This effector induces suppression of B and T cell activation [129] by dephosphorylating SLP-76 and LAT, two crucial proteins for TCR signaling [130]. Recently, the impact of *Y. pseudotuberculosis* downstream of the TCR signaling pathway has been confirmed within naïve CD4⁺ T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs): T3SS-mediated modulation of naïve CD4⁺ T cells results in an enhanced Th17 differentiation and a decreased induction of Foxp3⁺ Tregs in vitro, but the T3SS-effector responsible for this effect has not been identified [131].

In addition, impairment of T cell activation occurring indirectly through action on antigen-presenting cells, such as DCs, has been reported. *Salmonella* escapes from antigen presentation by DCs by T3SS-mediated avoidance of lysosomal degradation [132]. *Y. enterocolitica* YopP targeting of DCs results in inhibition of costimulatory molecule expression, decrease in cytokine production, and blockage of antigen uptake [133, 134]. EPEC NleE and *Salmonella* SteD T3SS effectors also trigger depletion of surface MHC class II molecules and costimulatory molecules in infected DCs [135, 136]. Induction of DC apoptosis also occurs, mediated by *Y. enterocolitica* YopP [133, 134] and *Salmonella* SipB [137]. *Shigella* infection of DCs leads to rapid IpaB-dependent cell death triggered by both caspase-1-dependent and -independent cytotoxicity mechanisms [138].

Altered immune cell migration is another mechanism reported for T3SS effectors. *Salmonella* SPI-2 effector Ssel inhibits normal migration of DCs, thus contributing to the maintenance of long-term chronic systemic infection [139]. *Shigella* IpgD has also been shown to inhibit T cell migration by manipulating host phosphoinositide metabolism [128] with an as yet unknown impact on host immunity.

Overall, whereas impairment of B cell function is poorly documented, limiting T cell activation appears as a common theme for these bacteria that act either directly on these lymphocytes or indirectly via DCs. This might contribute to delay and/or restrict the priming of a specific response, thus favoring host reinfection.

## Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives

This Review summarizes the most recent advances in the targeting mechanisms mediated by T3SS effectors expressed by critical human enteropathogens. It highlights the impressive diversity of bacterial effector-cellular target interactions modulating host responses all along the

**Outstanding Questions**

For a given cellular pathway, some components are not reported to be targeted by T3SS effectors. Besides, targeting of some cell functions, such as metabolism, is unknown. Do cell components or key functions so far unidentified or rarely reported constitute additional potential targets of T3SS effectors?

In contrast to the T3SS-induced modulation of the host innate inflammatory response in favor of the enterobacteria, the requirement for manipulating the specific immune response, which protects against reinfection, is far less understood. Does the targeting of dendritic cells and B and T lymphocytes by T3SS effectors impact on the priming and the effector phases of the adaptive immune responses? Does T3SS-mediated dampening of specific immunity confer a selective advantage by allowing bacterial reinfection of the same host?

infectious process. As has been known for a long time for viruses, all the key cellular pathways can be hijacked. Nevertheless, in the case of the host cell cytoskeleton, targeting of actin is more common as compared to microtubules and intermediate filaments, for which data are scarce. Another example is the discrepancy between the large number of reports on T3SS-effector-mediated modulation of TJs as compared to desmosomes and adherens junctions, the two other types of molecular structure maintaining epithelium integrity. It might thus be interesting to investigate whether T3SS effectors target other critical components of the key cellular pathways presented in this review. In addition, cell cycle as well as cell metabolism might be other key cell functions possibly targeted by T3SS effectors. Of note, the cell cycle is targeted by *Shigella* and *Salmonella* through toxins delivered independently of the T3SA, and by EPEC/EHEC through the T3SS-effector Cif, for which a homolog exists in *Y. pseudotuberculosis* [140]. Considering the importance of pathogen manipulation of cell metabolism to promote immune evasion that has been recently highlighted [141], investigating the impact of T3SS effectors on such a key pathway deserves future studies (see Outstanding Questions).

Taking into consideration the effects of these T3SS effectors on the host responses all along the time course of infection is critical. Indeed, these enterobacteria are equipped with a diversity of weapons that act sequentially and in a spatiotemporal manner. This is particularly well documented for *Salmonella* and *Shigella*. *Salmonella*-induced inflammation relies on SPI-1 T3SS effectors (SopE, SopE2, and SopB) injected into host cells upon initial contact with the SPI-1 T3SA components PrgJ and SipB, while downregulation of proinflammatory signaling pathways required later, during the time course of infection, is ensured by SPI-2 T3SS-effectors (SseL, SspH1, SpvC) (Figure 5). For *Shigella*, the prestored ‘first wave’ of injected effectors essentially induce inflammation while the ‘second wave’ effectors, whose expression depends on T3SS activity, downregulate the proinflammatory pathways [142]. Interestingly, some effectors may ensure a diversity of action towards different cell types while infection proceeds. For instance, *Shigella* IpaB is not only required for bacterial entry into epithelial cells [143], and lysis of the phagocytic vacuole [57], but also for triggering pyroptosis of macrophages [71]. Another example is *Shigella* IpgD that acts on both epithelial cells [144] and T lymphocytes [128] to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, respectively.

Lastly, the long-standing model of T3SS-dependent effector delivery is that effectors located in the bacterial cytosol are translocated directly into the host cell through this ‘molecular syringe’ in a one-step process. Emerging data support an alternative model in which extracytoplasmic proteins can also be translocated into host cells in a T3SS-dependent manner, as shown recently for EPEC EspC [145]. Besides, the notion that injection of T3SS effectors into host cells by invasive enterobacteria such as *Shigella* necessarily results in bacterial internalization has to be revisited. Indeed, the study of interactions of *Shigella* with B and T lymphocytes has revealed that the major targeting mechanism towards these cells is the injection of T3SS effectors without concomitant invasion, in other words ‘injection-only’ [146]. Further studies are required in order to determine if this novel mechanism is shared with other invasive enterobacteria such as *Salmonella*.

In our opinion, the most critical future perspective is to understand the impact of T3SS effectors on the manipulation of adaptive immunity. Only a few pathways have been shown so far to be targeted in DCs, and in B and T lymphocytes. Whether all the pathways being manipulated in epithelial cells can also be targets of T3SS effectors in these cells, that are key for adaptive immunity, remains to be investigated, with a particular focus on the functional consequences in terms of efficient priming of adaptive immunity (see Outstanding Questions).
