The presence of the acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (acyl DHAP) pathway in yeasts was investigated by examining three key enzyme activities of this pathway in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. In the total membrane fraction of *S. cerevisiae*, we confirmed the presence of both DHAP acyltransferase (DHAPAT; \(K_m = 1.27 \, \text{mM}\); \(V_{\text{max}} = 5.9 \, \text{nmol/min/mg of protein}\)) and *sn*-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT; \(K_m = 0.28 \, \text{mM}\); \(V_{\text{max}} = 12.6 \, \text{nmol/min/mg of protein}\)). The properties of these two acyltransferases are similar with respect to thermal stability and optimum temperature of activity but differ with respect to pH optimum (6.5 for GPAT and 7.4 for DHAPAT) and sensitivity toward the sulfhydryl blocking agent *N*-ethylmaleimide. Total membrane fraction of *S. cerevisiae* also exhibited acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase (EC 1.1.1.101) activity, which has not been reported previously. The reductase has a \(V_{\text{max}}\) of 3.8 nmol/min/mg of protein for the reduction of hexadecyl DHAP (\(K_m = 15 \, \mu\text{M}\)) by NADPH (\(K_m = 20 \, \mu\text{M}\)). Both acyl DHAP and alkyl DHAP acted as substrates. NADPH was the specific cofactor. Divalent cations and *N*-ethylmaleimide inhibited the enzymatic reaction. Reductase activity in the total membrane fraction from aerobically grown yeast cells was twice that from anaerobically grown cells. Similarly, DHAPAT and GPAT activities were also greater in aerobically grown yeast cells. The presence of these enzymes, together with the absence of both ether glycerolipids and the ether lipid-synthesizing enzyme (alkyl DHAP synthase) in *S. cerevisiae*, indicates that non-ether glycerolipids are synthesized in this organism via the acyl DHAP pathway.

Biosynthesis of phosphatidic acid, the precursor of glycerolipids in all organisms, proceeds via two different routes. In the glycerol phosphate pathway, phosphatidic acid is biosynthesized via the stepwise enzymatic acylation of *sn*-glycerol 3-phosphate (GP) by long-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A's (acyl-CoAs). In animals, phosphatidate is also biosynthesized by an alternate pathway, the acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (acyl DHAP) pathway. In this pathway, DHAP is acylated by a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA to form acyl DHAP. This compound is then reduced to 1-acyl GP, which is further acylated to yield phosphatidate (Fig. 1). The GP pathway is universal to all organisms, including yeasts (19, 27). In contrast, the acyl DHAP pathway is absent in bacteria and plants (11, 41). In animals, the acyl DHAP pathway is obligatory for ether lipid biosynthesis; the ether bond is synthesized by the substitution of a long-chain alcohol for the acyl group of acyl DHAP, with the release of free fatty acid to form alkyl DHAP (13). The enzymatic conversion of alkyl DHAP to glycerol ether lipids proceeds via reduction of alkyl DHAP to 1-alkyl GP followed by acylation (13). The importance of the acyl DHAP pathway for the biosynthesis of non-ether glycerolipids is controversial (6, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35). Except for some anaerobic bacteria which contain plasmalogens but not alkyl glycerol ethers, both aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobes, as well as plants, lack ether lipids (9, 28). Consequently, it would seem that the key metabolic role of the acyl DHAP pathway is to provide the sole route for ether lipid biosynthesis.

Ether lipids have not been detected in yeasts (28), yet Johnston and Paltauf (20) have reported the presence of an acyl DHAP pathway enzyme, DHAP acyltransferase (DHAPAT), in the yeast *Saccharomyces carlsbergensis*. This finding has been confirmed by Schlossman and Bell (36) for the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. These authors have shown that the physical and biochemical properties of DHAPAT and GP acyltransferase (GPAT) are identical. However, they found no detectable acyl DHAP reductase activity in *S. cerevisiae*. On the basis of these findings, they ascribed the DHAPAT activity in yeasts to the nonspecificity of GPAT and concluded that the acyl DHAP pathway was absent in this organism. Nevertheless, we have shown that membranes prepared from commercial lyophilized *S. cerevisiae* contain acyl DHAP reductase (31). In the present report, we confirm the presence of this reductase in the membranes of freshly grown yeast cells and describe the properties of this enzyme in detail, along with those of DHAPAT and GPAT. Furthermore, we show that expression of these three enzymes is regulated to the same extent by oxygen. Our results indicate that the acyl DHAP pathway may be important for non-ether lipid biosynthesis in eukaryotes.

**β-mercaptoethanol (buffer 1), and pellets were immediately stored at −80°C. Frozen pellets were thawed and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)–20% glycerol–10 mM β-mercaptoethanol (buffer 2, 1 ml/g [wet weight]), and the cells were lysed by vortexing with approximately 0.5 volume of acid-washed glass beads for five 1-min intervals, with cooling of the cells on ice for 1 min between intervals (10). Mixtures were centrifuged in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 5,000 rpm (3,000 × g) for 5 min, and supernatants were saved. The pellets were resuspended in buffer 2, and the 5,000-rpm spin was repeated. The pellets were discarded, and supernatants were combined with the first supernatant. The pooled supernatants were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm (100,000 × g) in a Beckman L8-70 ultracentrifuge, using a Ti 70.1 rotor. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended and homogenized in ice-cold 0.25 M sucrose–10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)–1 mM EDTA buffer and then centrifuged as before. The supernatant was again discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in sucrose–Tris-HCl–EDTA buffer as described above. The membrane fractions isolated as described above were stored immediately at −20°C. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (26), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard.**

For studies of the effect of oxygen, strain D273-10B cells were inoculated into Erlenmeyer flasks containing synthetic minimal medium as described above. The cells were then grown, harvested, and fractionated as described for the ade5 cells. Anaerobic cells were grown under a continuous stream of deoxygenated nitrogen and chilled in ice water for 20 min prior to harvest. Nitrogen was deoxygenated by passage through alkaline dithionite (10 mg of sodium dithionite per ml in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0). Membrane fractions were isolated as described above and stored immediately at −80°C.

**Enzyme assays.** DHAPAT and GPAT were assayed by measuring the ³²P-labeled lipids formed from [³²P]DHAP and [³²P]GP, respectively, and palmitoyl-CoA (17). The assay mixture contained 75 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 μM palmitoyl-CoA, 8.3 mM NaF, 8.3 mM MgCl₂, 0.42 mM [³²P]DHAP or [³²P]GP (7,000 cpm/nmol), plus BSA (1.7 mg/ml for DHAPAT or 2.5 mg/ml for GPAT) in a total volume of 0.6 ml, including the subcellular membrane fraction. After a 20-min incubation with constant shaking at 30°C, lipids were extracted by an acidic Bligh and Dyer method and washed (1, 12), and aliquots of the CHCl₃ extracts were transferred to scintillation minivials. Solvents were removed by blowing a gentle stream of air at 35°C. To the dried radioactive products was added 2 ml of scintillation solvent (Universol; ICN/Schwarz-Mann), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.

Acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase was assayed by measuring the formation of ³H-labeled lipid from either O-hexadecyl DHAP or palmitoyl DHAP and B-[4-³H]NADPH (23). Hexadecyl DHAP emulsions were prepared by combining 35 nmol of hexadecyl DHAP in chloroform-methanol (24:1) with 20 μg of Tween 20 detergent in CHCl₃. The solvents were removed by evaporation with N₂, and the residue was emulsified in 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) by sonication before addition to the incubation mixture. The incubation mixture contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaF, 0.7 mM EDTA, 60 μM hexadecyl DHAP (emulsified as described above), B-[4-³H]NADPH (70 μM, 5,000 cpm/nmol), the subcellular membrane fraction, and water in a total volume of 0.6 ml. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 20 min with constant shaking, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 2.25 ml of chloroform-methanol (1:2). The product (1-O-...

### Results

#### Properties of the Yeast Total Membrane Fraction DHAPAT and GPAT Activities
Yeast total membrane fraction catalyzes the acylation of both DHAP and GP, as other workers (20, 36) have previously reported. Table 1 shows the requirements for the formation of \[^{32}P\]-labeled lipid from \[^{32}P\]DHAP and \[^{32}P\]GP. The formation of labeled lipid is completely dependent on the addition of palmitoyl-CoA. As in mammalian systems, the reactions were facilitated by BSA, presumably by binding palmitoyl-CoA. This lipid substrate is inhibitory at high concentrations (23). Both NaF and Mg²⁺ stimulate the reaction, probably by inhibiting the phosphatase present in the total membrane fraction (38).

At 80 μM palmitoyl-CoA, kinetic studies of the acyltransferases from yeast total membrane fraction disclose an apparent \( K_m \) of 1.27 mM for DHAP with a \( V_{max} \) of 5.9 nmol/min/mg of protein for DHAPAT (Fig. 2A and inset) and an apparent \( K_m \) of 0.28 mM for GP with a \( V_{max} \) of 12.6 nmol/min/mg of protein for GPAT (Fig. 2B and inset).

#### **FIG. 3. Thermolability and temperature optima of DHAPAT and GPAT.**

**(A)** Thermolability of DHAPAT and GPAT. Yeast total membrane fraction protein (10 and 20 μg) was preincubated at 42°C for intervals of 0, 1, 2, 5, or 10 min. The samples were then assayed under the conditions described in the text. The specific activities of untreated membrane fractions were 3.2 and 34.0 nmol/min/mg of protein for DHAPAT and GPAT, respectively.

**(B)** Temperature optima of DHAPAT and GPAT activities. Yeast total membrane fraction protein (16 and 33 μg) was assayed at temperatures from 10 to 50°C for 15 min. The radioactivity in lipid was then determined as described in Materials and Methods. Maximum specific activities were 1.6 nmol/min/mg of protein at 25°C for DHAPAT and 6.8 nmol/min per mg of protein at 35°C for GPAT.

The enzyme activity is also linear with respect to protein concentration up to 100 μg. The formation of \[^3^H\]-labeled lipid from \[^3^H\]NADPH was completely dependent on the addition of the lipid substrates. Fluoride and EDTA slightly inhibited (1 to 2%) both enzymatic reactions. However, fluoride was included in the reaction mixture to protect the lipid substrate and product from hydrolysis by lipid phosphomonoesterase (22), and EDTA was added to prevent inhibition of the reaction by the possible presence of different divalent cations (see below).

#### **FIG. 4. pH optima of DHAPAT and GPAT activities.**
Yeast total membrane fraction protein (10 and 20 μg) was assayed by using different buffers (75 mM) at pH 4.5 to 9.85 under the conditions described in the text. The buffers used were acetate (pH 4.5 to 5.0), 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES; pH 5.4 to 6.5), Tris-HCl (pH 6.8 to 8.9), and glycine (pH 9.4 to 9.85). The radioactivity in lipid was then determined as described in Materials and Methods.

The acyltransferases exhibited different inactivation kinetics after 15 min of exposure to various concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide, with both activities declining to less than 10% of their initial values (Fig. 5).

#### **Yeast membrane NADPH-alkyl DHAP reductase activity and requirements for incorporation of radioactivity into lipid from \[^3^H\]NADPH.**
Preliminary experiments with both lyophilized and freshly grown yeast cells established that the subcellular membrane fraction catalyzes the reduction of both acyl DHAP and alkyl DHAP (31). In subsequent experiments with freshly grown yeast cells, however, alkyl DHAP rather than acyl DHAP was used as the lipid substrate because the decomposition product of acyl DHAP, i.e., fatty acid, inhibits the reductase. Experiments with fresh yeast whole homogenate and total membrane fractions demonstrated that yeast membranes contain significant alkyl DHAP reductase activity, which is linear up to a period of 20 min.

#### **FIG. 5. Inhibition of DHAPAT and GPAT activities by N-ethylmaleimide.**
Yeast total membrane fraction protein (25 and 50 μg) was preincubated in the presence of 0 to 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide in 90 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in a total volume of 0.25 ml for 15 min on ice. After the preincubation step, the remainder of the assay incubation mixture was added to obtain a final volume of 0.6 ml, and the contents were assayed for DHAPAT and GPAT activities for 20 min at 30°C. The radioactivity in lipid was then determined as described in Materials and Methods.

- **Effect of oxygen.** To determine the effect of oxygen on alkyl DHAP reductase activity, cells were grown aerobically and anaerobically in a synthetic medium containing glucose and supplements required for anaerobic growth (ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids). Cytochrome oxidase, a mitochondrial marker enzyme repressed in the absence of oxygen (32), was assayed in both aerobically and anaerobically grown cells to confirm anaerobiosis. D273-10B cells grown aerobically in glucose exhibit measurable cytochrome oxidase activity, in contrast to other strains tested (7). Therefore, cells of this strain were used for oxygen regulation studies, since they offer the most sensitive test for confirmation of stringent anaerobic conditions. As Fig. 9 shows, measurements of cytochrome oxidase activity confirmed anaerobiosis for cells grown in the absence of oxygen. In contrast, the activities of the endoplasmic reticulum marker enzyme (NADPH-cytochrome \(c\) reductase) were similar in both aerobic and anaerobic cells (Fig. 9). Wild-type cells grown in the absence of oxygen showed significantly lower alkyl DHAP reductase activity than did aerobically grown cells. Anaerobic cells exhibited a similar decrease in both DHAPAT and GPAT activities, showing approximately half the activity of aerobic cells.

### Formation of phosphatidate from DHAP in yeast cells and characterization of labeled lipid products.

Figure 10 shows the formation of products from several \({}^{32}\)P-labeled precursors. Palmitoyl \({}^{[32]}\)P]DHAP was the only product formed from \({}^{[32]}\)P]DHAP (lane A), whereas both labeled lysophosphatidate and phosphatidate were obtained from \({}^{[32]}\)P]GP (lane B). Upon addition of NADPH to an incubation mixture containing palmitoyl-CoA and \({}^{[32]}\)P]DHAP, labeled products which comigrated with lysophosphatidate and phosphatidate

(lanes D and G). The small amount of phosphatidate formed from palmitoyl \[^{32}P\]DHAP and NADPH (lane D) probably resulted from endogenous palmitoyl-CoA in the rat liver membrane protein preparation. The labeled acyl \[^{32}P\]GP formed by incubating yeast membranes with palmitoyl \[^{32}P\]DHAP and NADPH was further characterized by subjecting the mixture (similar to that in lane C) to alkaline methanolysis and high-voltage paper electrophoresis of the water-soluble \[^{32}P\]-labeled products (14). Of the two products obtained, one comigrated with P<sub>i</sub> (the alkaline methanolysis product of palmitoyl \[^{32}P\]DHAP) and the other comigrated with GP (the hydrolytic product of palmitoyl \[^{32}P\]GP). The \[^3H\]- and \[^{32}P\]-labeled product formed from acyl \[^{32}P\]DHAP and B-[4-\[^3H\]]NADPH and purified by TLC had a molar \[^3H\]-to-\[^{32}P\] ratio of 1.05.

# DISCUSSION

In higher eukaryotes, the acyl DHAP pathway is essential for ether lipid biosynthesis (15). In this pathway, acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase converts acyl DHAP into glycerolipids and alkyl DHAP, synthesized by alkyl DHAP synthase, into ether lipids. In the eukaryote *S. cerevisiae*, however, neither alkyl DHAP synthase nor ether lipids have been detected (33a). Nevertheless, we have shown in this report that *S. cerevisiae* contains both DHAPAT and acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase activities. Furthermore, we have shown that these enzymes, along with GPAT, are similarly regulated by oxygen. These data suggest that the acyl DHAP pathway may play a role in glycerolipid synthesis in this organism. This is the first demonstration of the acyl DHAP pathway in an organism lacking ether lipids. Our results demonstrate that *S. cerevisiae* is an ideal eukaryote in which to study the role of the acyl DHAP pathway in non-ether lipid synthesis.

The first step in the acyl DHAP pathway is the DHAPAT-catalyzed conversion of DHAP to acyl DHAP (Fig. 1). While Tillman and Bell (40) presented compelling genetic evidence that both GPAT and DHAPAT are dual functions of one enzyme encoded by a single nuclear gene, certain physicochemical properties of the two acyltransferases described in this report are not easily explained by a single enzyme. First, in our study, the two activities exhibited different kinetics of inactivation by *N*-ethylmaleimide (Fig. 5). In contrast, Schlossman and Bell (36) observed similar inactivation kinetics for the two enzymes, with both activities declining to approximately 20% of their initial activities following 10 min of exposure to *N*-ethylmaleimide. Second, we observed different pH optima for the two activities (Fig. 4), in contrast to the study by Schlossman and Bell (36), which showed no differences in pH activity profiles for GPAT and DHAPAT. Tillman and Bell (40), however, did show a significant difference in pH optima for the two enzymes in the wild-type strain. Apparently, pH activity profiles differ from strain to strain and under different assay conditions. Our results also suggest that the two activities are considerably more thermolabile than those observed by Schlossman and Bell (30% versus 40% activity following pretreatment of membrane fraction protein at 42°C for 10 min versus 48°C for 15 min). Finally, the kinetic parameters obtained from the two studies vary somewhat with respect to GPAT activity (*V*<sub>max</sub> of 12.6 nmol/min per mg of protein and *K*<sub>m</sub> of 0.28 mM in this study [Fig. 2B], compared with 3.4 nmol/min per mg of protein and 0.05 mM, respectively). The reasons for these differences are unclear, although strain differences may play some role in explaining these discrepancies.

Interestingly, reductase expression was significantly reduced in the absence of oxygen (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the extent of regulation by oxygen was almost identical to that observed for both GPAT and DHAPAT and clearly different from that for the marker enzymes tested. Regulation of these enzymes by oxygen might be related to their subcellular localization. Zinser and coworkers (42) have shown that most of the phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, including GPAT, are present in both mitochondria and microsomes. Reduced enzyme expression may be due to reduced mitochondrial volume in anaerobically grown cells. Coordinate control of both GP and acyl DHAP pathway enzymes is consistent with the hypothesis that both pathways are utilized in phosphoglycerolipid synthesis. This is clearly seen in Fig. 10, which demonstrates that phosphatidate is formed from either DHAP or GP and necessary cofactors.

Certain properties of the yeast reductase resemble those of the corresponding mammalian enzymes. The apparent *K*<sub>m</sub>s of the yeast enzyme for its two substrates are similar to those of the guinea pig liver enzyme (apparent *K*<sub>m</sub>s of 15 μM for NADPH and 20 μM for hexadecyl DHAP for yeast cells [Fig. 6]), compared with *K*<sub>m</sub>s of 20 μM for NADPH and 21 μM for hexadecyl DHAP for guinea pig liver (4). Like the mammalian enzymes, NADPH, but not NADH, is the cofactor for the yeast enzyme (23; see above). The pH optima of both are about 6.5 (24; this study). However, the mammalian enzyme is more stable than its yeast counterpart. Peroxisomal and microsomal reductase activities from guinea pig liver were stable in the presence of high concentrations of *N*-ethylmaleimide (up to 10 mM). In addition, heating the mammalian enzymes for 15 min at 50°C failed to substantially diminish their activities (8).

This report is the first demonstration of acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase in yeast cells. These results show not only that acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase activity is present in yeast cells but that it is present in substantial quantity. Although the activity of the enzyme (or enzymes) varied from one preparation to another, activities in the range of 3 to 6 nmol/min/mg of protein were typical, and activities as high as 9 nmol/min/mg of protein were detected from some preparations. Other investigators did not detect this enzyme in membrane fractions of *S. cerevisiae* (36). At least three possibilities may account for this discrepancy. In the prior study (36), yeast cells were grown anaerobically and harvested in stationary phase. In this study, we showed that reductase activity was reduced in anaerobically grown yeast cells. Another possible explanation is that the assay system used by these workers was not sensitive enough to detect the lower levels of reductase activity present in membranes from anaerobically grown cells. In both direct and indirect assays for the enzyme, Schlossman and Bell (36) measured products by TLC. Furthermore, only a 5 μM concentration of the palmitoyl DHAP substrate was used, compared with 60 μM hexadecyl DHAP in our assay. Since the apparent *K*<sub>m</sub> of the yeast reductase is 20 μM (for hexadecyl DHAP; Fig. 6), the palmitoyl DHAP concentration used may have been too low to detect sufficient amounts of the radiolabeled lipid product. Additionally, the subsequent TLC extractions to quantify the product undoubtedly reduced the sensitivity even further. A third possibility is that the differences between these two studies may be accounted for by strain differences, as we have observed with other yeast enzymes (7).

The question of the relative contributions of the GP and acyl DHAP pathways to phosphoglycerolipid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis in eukaryotes remains an important one (6, 29, 30, 33). In this study, we demonstrated that both pathways are present in the simple eukaryote *S. cerevisiae*,

and we characterized the properties of the acyl DHAP pathway enzymes in membrane fractions of this organism. The data support the hypothesis that the acyl DHAP pathway is utilized in glycerolipid synthesis in this yeast. Because *S. cerevisiae* is easily amenable to genetic and biochemical analysis, it serves as an excellent model in which to explore the relative contributions of the GP and acyl DHAP pathways to glycerolipid synthesis.
