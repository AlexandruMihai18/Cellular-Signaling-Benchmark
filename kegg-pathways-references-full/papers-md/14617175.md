## Summary

Analysis of the regulation of plasmid transfer genes on the symbiotic plasmid pRL1JI in *Rhizobium leguminosarum* bv. *viciae* has revealed a novel regulatory relay that is specifically poised to detect an N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) made by different cells (potential recipients of pRL1JI). Adjacent to the *tral-trbBCDEJKLFGHI* plasmid transfer operon on pRL1JI are two regulatory genes, *bisR* and *traR*, which encode LuxR-type quorum-sensing regulators required for conjugation. Potential recipients of pRL1JI induce the *tral-trb* operon and plasmid transfer via a quorum-sensing relay involving BisR, TraR and the *tral-trb* operon in donor cells. BisR induces expression of *traR* in response to N-(3-hydroxy-7-cis-tetradecenoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL), which is produced by CinI in potential recipient strains. In donor strains (carrying pRL1JI), BisR represses the expression of the chromosomal gene *cinI*; this repression results in a very low level of formation of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL and hence relatively low levels of expression of *traR* and the *tral-trb* operon in strains carrying pRL1JI. However, if 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL from potential recipients is present, then *traR* and plasmid transfer are induced. The induction of *traR* occurs at very low concentrations of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (around 1 nM). TraR then induces the *tral-trb* operon in a quorum-sensing dependent manner in response to the Tral-made AHLs, N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and N-(octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone. The resulting autoinduction results in high levels of expression of the *tral-trb* operon. Premature expression of the *tral-trb* operon is reduced by TraM, which probably titres out TraR preventing expression of *tral* when there are low levels of *traR* expression.

Expression of *traR* in stationary phase cells is limited by feedback inhibition mediated by Tral-made AHLs.

## Introduction

The symbiotic plasmid pRL1JI from *Rhizobium leguminosarum* bv. *viciae* carries genes required for nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation on legumes such as pea, vetch and lentil. pRL1JI was one of the first identified plasmids in the rhizobia, based on its high frequency of transfer between different rhizobial strains (Johnston et al., 1978). pRL1JI is about 200 kb in size; in addition to nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes, it carries genes for the production of, and resistance to, ‘medium’ bacteriocin (Hirsch, 1979) as well as genes that confer sensitivity to ‘small’ bacteriocin. It is now evident that the growth inhibition attributed to small bacteriocin is bacteriostatic (Gray et al., 1996) and is actually due to an effect of multiple N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) (Wilkinson et al., 2002). One of these, N-(3-hydroxy-7-cis-tetradecenoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL), has been referred to as small bacteriocin (Gray et al., 1996; Schripsema et al., 1996) and is made by CinI (Lithgow et al., 2000). As shown in Fig. 1, *cinI* is induced by CinR in response to CinI-made 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (Lithgow et al., 2000).

Growth sensitivity to small bacteriocin was recently shown to require two quorum-sensing regulatory genes (*bisR* and *traR*), both of which encode LuxR-type AHL regulators (Wilkinson et al., 2002). (In that work *traR* was referred to as *triR*, but to simplify the nomenclature, we propose to rename *triR* as *traR*.) BisR induces *traR* in response to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (Fig. 1) and it is probable that the growth inhibition could be due to an effect of TraR on some target promoter(s). In line with that proposal, maximal growth inhibition required a second AHL such as N-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C<sub>8</sub>-HSL) or N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL), either of which were proposed to activate TraR causing growth inhibition when TraR was strongly induced (Wilkinson et al., 2002). Recent support for TraR-mediated growth inhibition comes from work on *Rhizobium* sp. NGR234, which also has a *traR* gene on the symbiotic plasmid. Expressing TraR from a multicopy plasmid in this strain resulted in 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL-dependent inhibition of growth.

Fig. 1. Model of the regulatory role of BisR. BisR induces traR in response to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL; BisR also acts to reduce the induction of cinI by CinR, greatly reducing the production of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (Lithgow et al., 2000; Wilkinson et al., 2002).

recognized by RhiR, resulting in population-density dependent induction of the rhiABC genes (Rodelas et al., 1999). The biochemical roles of RhiA, RhiB and RhiC are not known, but they play some role in the rhizosphere interaction of *R.* leguminosarum bv. viciae with peas and vetch (Cubo et al., 1992). The second pRL1JI-determined AHL synthase, is encoded by tral, which is located about 10 kb from bisR (Fig. 2), separated by the trbBCDEJKLF-GHI genes that are involved in plasmid transfer. Mutation of traR or bisR abolishes pRL1JI transfer and affects AHL production (Wilkinson et al., 2002). There is evidence for quorum-sensing regulation of tra gene expression in other rhizobia including *Rhizobium* sp. NGR234 (Freiberg et al., 1997; He et al., 2003), *Sinorhizobium meliloti* strain AK631 (Marketon and Gonzalez, 2002) and *Rhizobium etli* strain CFN42 (Tun-Garrido et al., 2003).

Plasmid transfer in the Rhizobiaceae has been most thoroughly characterized in strains of *A.* tumefaciens, in which transfer of Ti (tumour-inducing) plasmids is induced in response to two types of signals. The first signal is a metabolite (opine) made by plants that were naturally transformed by *A.* tumefaciens, and this opine induces the expression of traR, which encodes a LuxR-type regulator of plasmid transfer. When traR is induced, plasmid transfer is then regulated by a second signal; thus TraI-made 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL induces tral and the downstream trb plasmid transfer genes via quorum-sensing regulation. The resulting positive autoregulation results in high levels of induction of the tral-trb operon and other plasmid transfer genes (Farrand, 1998).

Two modes of induction of traR have been found on two Ti plasmids from different *A.* tumefaciens strains. On one plasmid, the traR gene is positively regulated by OccR a LysR-type regulator; thus, in the presence of octopine, OccR induces traR as one of several genes in an operon primarily involved in octopine transport and catabolism (Fuqua and Winans, 1994). On the other plasmid, traR is

(He et al., 2003). Neither study identified the target for TraR, but it is evident that the target is not on the symbiotic plasmids (Wilkinson et al., 2002; He et al., 2003). Similar growth inhibition can be seen with bisR and traR cloned in a strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which is cured of both its Ti and At plasmids and does not make AHLs (Wilkinson et al., 2002).

In addition to inducing traR, BisR represses cinI expression (Fig. 1), probably by competing with CinR for the promoter of cinI, or by forming inactive multimers with CinR (Wilkinson et al., 2002). Therefore, in addition to playing a role in conferring growth sensitivity to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (small bacteriocin), BisR represses the production of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (Wilkinson et al., 2002).

pRL1JI carries two loci that determine the production of AHLs. RhiI, the product of one of these, produces N-hexanoyl-, N-heptanoyl- and N-octanoyl-homoserine lactones (C<sub>6</sub>-HSL, C<sub>7</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL); these AHLs are

in an operon along with other genes whose functions remain to be determined and expression of this operon is repressed by AccR (Piper et al., 1999). Opines (such as agrocinopines) relieve the repressing effect of AccR (Beck von Bodman et al., 1992). TraR produced by either system induces expression of plasmid transfer operons after binding 3-O-C₈-HSL (Piper et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1993). The induction of the *tral-trb* operon results in positive autoregulation because 3-O-C₈-HSL made by Tral further increases expression of plasmid transfer genes, including *tral* (Hwang et al., 1994).

Expression of plasmid transfer in *A. tumefaciens* can be negatively regulated by TraM (Fuqua et al., 1995; Hwang et al., 1995) or TrlR (Oger et al., 1998), which act as anti-activators of TraR. TraM is an 11 kDa protein which binds to the DNA-binding domain of TraR thereby inhibiting its activity (Hwang et al., 1999; Luo et al., 2000; Swiderska et al., 2001). TraM inhibits the induction of *tral* by titering out TraR and hence preventing induction of plasmid transfer when only low levels of TraR are made. TrlR is very similar to the first 181 residues of TraR and *trlR* is induced by the opine mannopine. In the presence of mannopine, TrlR prevents gene induction by TraR by forming inactive TrlR/TraR dimers (Chai et al., 2001).

The organization of the *R. leguminosarum tral-trb* plasmid transfer operon on pRL1JI is identical to that seen in *A. tumefaciens* strains. However, instead of having *traR* located within an opine-inducible operon, *traR* in *R. leguminosarum* is in a single cistron located downstream of *bisR* (Wilkinson et al., 2002). A similar genetic arrangement appears to be present on plasmid p42a in *R. etli* strain CFN42 (Tun-Garrido et al., 2003).

In this work, we have analysed the regulation of the *tral-trb* operon and shown that it is specifically induced by an AHL signal produced by other bacteria (potential recipient strains lacking pRL1JI). The signal induces the pRL1JI regulatory gene *traR*, whose product then induces the *tral-trb* operon via quorum-sensing regulation.

region on plJ9036 and identified a Tn5 insertion located 18 nt downstream of the predicted translation start of *tral* (Fig. 2). The *tral* mutation was recombined onto pRL1JI in strain A34 by homologous recombination to make A782.

The *tral-trbBCDEJKLFGHI* genes are likely to be in an operon and so the Tn5 insertion in *tral* would be expected to be polar and to block plasmid transfer. We tested this by mating A782 (carrying *tral*:Tn5 on pRL1JI) with A73, a rifampicin-resistant strain of *R. leguminosarum*, which lacks a symbiotic plasmid. Normally pRL1JI is transferred to A73 at a frequency of about \(1 \times 10^{-2}\) per recipient (Lithgow et al., 2000), but no transconjugants were found with A782 as a donor (the transfer frequency was less than \(1 \times 10^{-8}\)). The cloned *tral-trbBCD* genes on plJ9300 did not complement plasmid transfer by A782, demonstrating that the *tral* mutation is polar. In *A. tumefaciens*, TraR binds to two regulatory elements called *tra*-boxes, which are located between *tral* and *repA* (Fuqua et al., 1996; Li and Farrand, 2000; Pappas and Winans, 2003). The *tral-repA* intergenic region of pRL1JI contains two potential *tra*-boxes, as illustrated in Fig. 3.

AHLs were extracted from the culture supernatants of the wild type (A34) and the *tral* mutant A782, separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and bioassayed using *A. tumefaciens* NT1/pZLR4 (Fig. 4). The amount of AHLs produced by A782 was greatly reduced (Fig. 4 lane 4) compared with the control A34 (Fig. 4 lane 3). Note that there is about twentyfold more sample loaded for the mutant in Fig. 4 lane 4, compared with the wild type in Fig. 4 lane 3. We expected that mutation of *tral* would not totally abolish AHL production because there are two other AHL synthases encoded by *rail* and *rhil* in this strain. The *tral* mutant makes an AHL that co-migrates with 3OH-C₈-HSL (made by Rail; Wisniewski-Dye et al., 2002) and ESMS revealed a *m/z* of 244.3 corresponding to 3-OH-C₈-HSL. The other AHLs produced by the *tral* mutant A782 and seen in Fig. 4 (lane 4) correspond to C₆-HSL, C₇-HSL and C₈-HSL, which were also identified as being produced by Rail (Wisniewski-Dye et al., 2002) and by RhiI (Rodelas et al., 1999).

Results

Effect of a *tral::Tn5* mutation on plasmid transfer and AHL production

Mutations in either of two LuxR-type quorum-sensing regulatory genes *bisR*, or *traR* (*traR* was previously referred to as *triR*; Wilkinson et al., 2002) on the symbiotic plasmid pRL1JI, block plasmid transfer and strongly reduce the levels of pRL1JI-dependent AHLs produced by *R. leguminosarum* strain A34 (Wilkinson et al., 2002). In that work, a gene (*tral*) was identified, which is located immediately upstream of the *trbBCDEJKLFGHI* genes (Fig. 2) and which encodes a protein with similarity to the LuxI family of AHL synthases. We mutagenized the *tral-trb* gene

of C₈-HSL. We conclude that C₈-HSL is also made by Tral. Fraction III (Fig. 4) produced a *m/z* peak of 270.3 which could correspond to the [M + H]⁺ of 3-O-C₁₀-HSL, but this was close to the detection limits and fragmentation ions could not be unambiguously ascribed. Other minor components were made at low levels based on the detection by *A. tumefaciens* NT1/pZLR4 and by the *Chromobacterium violaceum* CV026 detection system described by McClean et al. (1997), but we were unable to determine mass ions for these minor components (data not shown).

To estimate the relative amounts of the identified AHLs, an extract of AHLs from the culture supernatant was separated by TLC and then serial dilutions of synthetic standards of C₈-HSL, 3-O-C₈-HSL and 3-O-C₁₀-HSL were spotted onto the plates. The plates were then developed as before and the amounts of AHLs were estimated by comparing the intensities of the spots. Assuming 100% recovery, the concentration of AHLs produced by A676/plJ9265/plJ7867 were estimated to be: 3-O-C₈-HSL, 200–400 nM; C₈-HSL, 100–200 nM; 3-O-C₁₀-HSL, 4–8 nM.

tral expression is population density dependent and requires cinR, bisR and traR

The *trb* gene region was mutagenized with Tn5-lacZ and plJ7937 carrying Tn5-lacZ in the correct orientation within *trbL* was identified. DNA sequencing revealed that the transposon was inserted about 500 nt downstream of the predicted translation start of *trbL*. The *trbL2::Tn5-lacZ* allele was recombined into A34 to produce A683. The mutation abolished transfer of pRL1JI (the frequency of transfer was less than 1 × 10⁻⁸ per recipient), but the production of AHLs was unaffected (data not shown).

The *trbL-lacZ* fusion in A683 was induced towards the end of the exponential phase of growth (Fig. 5A). The *trbL2::Tn5-lacZ* allele was also recombined into strains carrying mutations in *bisR* or *cinI* to form A686 and A717 respectively. Assays of β-galactosidase in the double mutants showed that the *cinI* and *bisR* mutations blocked induction of the *tral-trb* operon (Fig. 5A).

A plasmid-borne *tral-lacZ* fusion (plJ9279) was also made and introduced into strain A34 and into derivatives of A34 carrying mutations in various quorum-sensing regulatory genes. Assays of β-galactosidase in A34/plJ9279 confirmed that *tral-lacZ* is induced in the late exponential phase of growth (Fig. 5B). There was no induction in strains carrying mutations in *cinI* (A664) (Fig. 5B), *cinR* (A621), *bisR* (A549) or *traR* (A627) (data not shown but as for A664 in Fig. 5B). In the *tral* mutant A782, the induction of *tral-lacZ* was delayed relative to wild type, but surprisingly the level of expression late in growth was two- to threefold higher than the level seen in the wild-type strain A34 (Fig. 5B). This increased expression suggested that the induction of *tral* by AHLs might be complex.

resulting strain was used to assay which AHLs activated TraR to induce *traI--lacZ*. At 1 μM, both 3-O-C₈-HSL and C₈-HSL strongly activated *traI--lacZ* expression and 1 μM 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL induced a low level of expression (Table 1). At 100 nM AHL, significant induction was seen with both 3-O-C₈-HSL and C₈-HSL (Table 1) demonstrating that *traI* is positively autoregulated. At lower concentrations, 3-O-C₈-HSL was a more potent inducer than C₈-HSL (Table 1), showing that 3-O-C₈-HSL is preferentially recognized by TraR.

Normally, *traI* induction requires both *bisR* and *traR* and so we also assayed *traI--lacZ* expression in Agrobacterium strain A676/plJ9279 carrying *bisR* and *traR* on plJ7867. In this case, the induction by 3-O-C₈-HSL and C₈-HSL was not as strong as seen with *traR* alone (Table 1), and this could reflect the relative levels of expression of *traR* in the two strains. With plJ7867 (*bisR* and *traR*) there was clear induction by 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL, even at 0.1 μM (Table 1). This may be due to strong *traR* induction by BisR in response to 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL (Wilkinson et al., 2002). Increased expression of the *A. tumefaciens traR* gene broadened the specificity of that TraR for AHLs (Zhu et al., 1998) and so the high level of BisR-induced *traR* in *R. leguminosarum* A676/plJ9279 may enable the *R. leguminosarum* TraR to respond to the lower concentration of 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL and induce the *traI-trb* operon. In this plasmid-based assay system, there is some induction of *traI--lacZ* by 3-O-C₈-HSL or C₈-HSL in the absence of 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL induction of *traR*; this could result from some expression of *traR* from the multicopy plasmid plJ9279.

Results similar to those seen with A664/plJ9279 were also seen with the mutants A621 (*cinR*), A549 (*bisR*) and A627 (*traR*), but the data are omitted for clarity.

and reproducible inhibitory effect on expression of the integrated *trbL2::lacZ* fusion in *R. leguminosarum* A683 (Table 2). This inhibition appears to be due to availability of TraR, because these two AHLs also reduced the expression to *traR-lacZ* (Table 2). In contrast, whereas 0.1 μM 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL did not induce expression of *tral-lacZ* in *A. tumefaciens* carrying *traR* (Table 1), it very strongly increased expression of the integrated *trbL2::lacZ* in *R. leguminosarum* A683 (Table 2). The level of induction seen was the highest we have ever observed for an integrated gene fusion in *R. leguminosarum* and is probably caused by the very strong induction of *traR* by 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL (Table 2) an observation described previously (Wilkinson et al., 2002). In line with these observations, an AHL extract from strain 8401 strongly induced *trbL-lacZ* in A683 and *traR-lacZ* in A34/pIJ7878, but an AHL extract from A34 did not increase expression over the level seen in the absence of added AHL (Table 2). Analysis of the AHL extracts by TLC confirmed that the A34 extract was rich in Tral-made AHLs but contained very little 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL and that the extract from strain 8401 (lacking pRL1JI) contained 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL (data not shown).

The high induction of the *tral-trb* operon in A683 by 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL is apparently due to a high level of BisR-induced *traR* expression followed by autoinduction of the *tral* promoter by TraR responding to 3-O-C₈-HSL, C₈-HSL and possibly 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL. In line with this explanation, mutations in *cinI*, *cinR*, *bisR* or *traR* strongly reduced expression of *tral-lacZ* and 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL-induced *tral-lacZ* expression in *cinI* or *cinR* mutants but not in *bisR* or *traR* mutants (Table 3). The lack of induction of *tral-lacZ* by 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL in the *cinR* mutant must be due to the lack of 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL and not due to the absence of CinR. The increase in *tral-lacZ* expression in the *tral* mutant compared with wild type (Table 3) will be dealt with below.

3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL induces plasmid transfer

A model for these observations on *tral* induction is that potential recipients (*R. leguminosarum* strains lacking pRL1JI, and hence BisR-mediated repression of *cinI*) produce 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL, which activates BisR to induce *traR* expression in strains carrying pRL1JI (Fig. 1). The resulting TraR could then induce *tral* by autoinduction via Tral-made AHLs (primarily 3-O-C₈-HSL and probably C₈-HSL) as the population density increases. Such a BisR-TraR quorum-sensing relay would enable pRL1JI-containing strains to induce conjugation in response to 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL made by strains of *R. leguminosarum* lacking pRL1JI (i.e. potential recipients of the plasmid).

To test this model, we measured the effects of added 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL on pRL1JI transfer between donor and recipient strains of *R. leguminosarum*, both mutated in *cinI*, and hence defective for 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL formation. Filter matings were carried out using strain A684 (carrying a mutation in *cinI* and a kanamycin-resistance marker on pRL1JI) and strain A643 (lacking pRL1JI and carrying a mutation in *cinI*). In the absence of added 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL, no significant transfer was observed, but with increasing concentrations of 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL (from 1 nM) increasing numbers of transconjugants were observed, reaching a maximum of around one transconjugant per 100 recipients (Fig. 6), close to what is observed for the maximal transfer frequency of pRL1JI between wild-type strains.

We also assayed transfer of pRL1JI between strains of *A. tumefaciens* that make no AHLs. We made A894, a derivative of *Agrobacterium* A677 carrying pRL1JI marked with kanamycin resistance and mated it with *Agrobacterium* A676. In the absence of added AHL no transconjugants (less than 1 per 10⁸ recipients) were obtained. Conjugation was clearly induced by as little as 1 nM 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL and increased with higher levels of this AHL. The requirement for added 3-OH-C₁₄:₁-HSL could be circumvented by adding the cloned *cinRI* genes. Thus if the recipient A676 carrying pIJ9574 (containing *cinR* and *cinI*) was mated with A894 we obtained 0.6 ± 0.2 transconjugants per 100 recipients, but if pIJ9574 was replaced with pIJ9149 (as pIJ9574 but with a deletion within *cinI*) no transconjugants (less than 1 per 10⁸ recipients) were obtained.

units. Similar results were seen with C<sub>8</sub>-HSL (data not shown). These observations suggest that 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL may antagonize the effect 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL has on BisR-mediated induction of *traR*. Such antagonistic effects of one AHL on the activation of gene expression by another have been clearly documented (Zhu *et al.*, 1998). The increased levels of *tral*–*lacZ* expression in a *tral* mutant late in growth could reflect increased induction of *traR* by 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL in the absence of Tral-made 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL. In this strain, two genes (*rail* and *rhil*) encoding AHL synthases are still present. Presumably AHLs made by Rail and Rhil accumulate late in growth, and these AHLs could account for the TraR-dependent induction of *tral*–*lacZ* in stationary phase growth of the *tral* mutant.

We assayed *traR*–*lacZ* expression using pIJ7878 in the *traR* and *tral* mutants A627 and A782 respectively. In the wild-type strain A34 carrying pIJ7878, we observed 4331 ± 127 units of β-galactosidase activity after 48 h of growth. However, there was much higher activity in both the *traR* mutant A627 (22 349 ± 262 units) and in the *tral* mutant A782 (21 580 ± 476 units). Addition of 1 μM 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL or C<sub>8</sub>-HSL reduced the level of *traR*–*lacZ* expression in the *traR* and *tral* mutants by 85–90% (data not shown), demonstrating that these AHLs can inhibit *traR* induction.

Competitive inhibitory effects of 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL on *traR*–*lacZ* induction by 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL were assayed using Agrobacterium strain A676 carrying *bisR* on pIJ9581 and *traR*–*lacZ* on pIJ7878. The apparent *K*<sub>m</sub> for 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL induction of *traR*–*lacZ* by BisR was estimated to be around 0.8 ± 0.5 nM (Fig. 7). Both 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL (Fig. 7A) and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL (Fig. 7B) acted as competitive inhibitors for induction of *traR*–*lacZ*, with apparent *K*<sub>i</sub> values of 0.9 and 0.6 μM respectively (Fig. 7C). C<sub>6</sub>-HSL did not inhibit induction (data not shown). Therefore, although Tral-made 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL induce *tral*–*lacZ*, they can also repress the expression of *traR*, whose product is required for *tral* induction. The net effect could be that, as *tral* is induced, Tral-made AHLs accumulate and these can have a negative feedback on expression of *tral*, via a reduction of *traR* expression. This may occur because BisR induces *traR* at a very low concentration of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL, but the strain carrying pRL1JI produces high levels of 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL.

### Tral-made AHLs reduce the level of *traR*–*lacZ* expression

The analyses of expression of the *tral-trb* operon resulted in two unexpected sets of observations. First, although the Tral-made AHLs 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL-induced *traR*-dependent *tral*–*lacZ* expression in Agrobacterium (Table 1), these same AHLs reduced expression of the *trbL*–*lacZ* fusion in *R.* leguminosarum (Table 3). Second, mutation of *tral* resulted in increased levels of *tral*–*lacZ* expression in late stationary phase *R.* leguminosarum (Fig. 5B and Table 2). Both of these observations suggest that Tral-made AHLs can have a negative feedback effect on the overall process of induction of the *tral-trb* operon. The data in Table 2 suggest that this negative feedback occurs at the level of *traR* induction, because both 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL inhibited expression of *traR*–*lacZ* on pIJ7878. The experiments showing inhibition of induction of *traR*–*lacZ* expression in A34/pIJ7878 by 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL shown in Table 2 were done with 1 μM 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL. Some inhibition was also seen with 0.5 μM 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL, but no significant inhibition was seen at lower concentrations (0.1 μM or less) of this AHL. When 30 nM 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL was added together with 1 μM 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL, expression of *traR*–*lacZ* in A34/pIJ7878 was induced to 25 107 ± 157

### traM attenuates tral expression

A colony of Agrobacterium A676 carrying *tral* on pIJ9071 and *bisR*, *traR* on pIJ7867 activated pigment production by the AHL detection strain *C.* violaceum CV026 (Fig. 8, top centre). However, if pIJ7867 was replaced by pIJ7665 (carrying *bisR* and *traR* on a larger fragment of DNA in the same vector) no pigment was produced

S. meliloti (Accessions AA043544, NP 443818 and AAL78510). In A. tumefaciens strains, TraM inhibits the induction of *traI* by the LuxR-type regulator TraR (Fuqua et al., 1995; Hwang et al., 1995). The *R. leguminosarum* bv. *viciae traM*-like gene was cloned on pIJ9379, and this plasmid inhibited AHL production by A676/pIJ7867(*bisR*, *traR*)/pIJ9071(*traI*) (Fig. 8, bottom left), demonstrating that the *R. leguminosarum traM* gene can inhibit the expression of *traI*.

In this assay of TraM function, *traI* expression depends totally on *traI*-made AHLs, whereas under normal circumstances, the induction of high levels of *traI* expression is dependent upon the induction of *traR*, which requires BisR and 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL. We tested the ability of a producer of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (strain 8401) to activate *traI* expression when *traM* was present, by growing a colony of 8401 (colonies D in Fig. 8) adjacent to the strains carrying *traM*. Strain 8401 produces a low amount of Rail-made AHLs (Wisniewski-dye et al., 2002), which very weakly activate the CV026 biosensor strain (Fig. 5, bottom right). However, strain 8401 grown adjacent to strain A676/pIJ7665 (*bisR*, *traR* and *traM*)/pIJ9071 (*traI*) (Fig. 8, top right) strongly activated pigment production by the bioassay strain CV026. Similarly, strain 8401 grown adjacent to A676/pIJ7867 (*bisR*, *traR*)/pIJ9071 (*traI*)/pIJ9379 (*traM*) activated pigment production by CV026 (Fig. 8, top left). These observations demonstrate that strain 8401 (producing 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL) overcomes *traM*-dependent inhibition of AHL production by TraI. No such cross-activation was seen with a *cinI* mutant derivative of 8401

(Fig. 8, bottom centre). This indicated that a linked gene (present on pIJ7665 but not pIJ7867) might inhibit *traI* expression.

The DNA flanking the *traI-traR* genes was sequenced and several additional genes were deduced to be present (Fig. 2). The gene adjacent to *traR* encodes a small predicted protein (107 residues), which has sequence similarity (19% and 24% identity) to two different TraM proteins from *A. tumefaciens* (GenBank Accession Nos. AF242881 and ATU16786). It has 55–60% sequence identity to TraM-like proteins in *R. etli*, *Rhizobium* sp. NGR 234 and

AHLs were added at the beginning of growth and cultures were grown for 24 h in TY medium.

The apparent *K*<sub>m</sub> for induction by 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL was calculated to be 0.8 ± 0.5 nM based on three different experiments similar to that shown. In A, C<sub>8</sub>-HSL was added, and in B, 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL was added at the following concentrations: 1 μM (●), 0.5 μM (▲) or 0.1 μM (■). The points on the graphs represent averages from three parallel experiments. C shows the plot used to calculate the apparent *K*<sub>i</sub> of 0.9 μM for C<sub>8</sub>-HSL (◇ and broken line) and the apparent *K*<sub>i</sub> of 0.6 μM for 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL (□ and continuous line).

Fig. 9. Model for the regulation of the *traI-trb* operon on pRL1JI. The effects of AHLs on activation or inhibition of regulators are shown as broken lines, and the inducing or repressing effects of regulators are shown as solid lines. (a) In cells that act as donors of pRL1JI, BisR induces *traR* in response to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL. This occurs predominantly in response to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL from potential recipients of pRL1JI. In the absence of this exogenously supplied AHL, there can be low levels of *traR* expression. (b) Induction of *traR* produces TraR, which induces the *traI-trb* operon in response to 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL, C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL. (c) There is autoinduction of the *traI-trb* operon by the Tral-made AHLs, 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL. (d) As Tral-made 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and C<sub>8</sub>-HSL accumulate late in growth, they reduce the BisR-mediated induction of *traR*. (e) Induction of the *traI-trb* operon by low levels of TraR is inhibited by TraM, which, by analogy with what is seen in *A. tumefaciens* (Hwang et al., 1999; Luo et al., 2000; Piper and Farrand, 2000; Swiderska et al., 2001), is proposed to titrate out TraR. However the TraM-mediated repression of *traI* expression is overcome after induction of *traR* by BisR (a), in response to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL from potential recipients. (f), endogenous production of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL is very greatly reduced because BisR represses the expression of the chromosomal gene *cinI*, whose product produces 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (Wilkinson et al., 2002). This repression enables the pRL1JI donors to respond primarily to potential recipient strains lacking *bisR* (and hence pRL1JI) but not to strains carrying pRL1JI.

that is defective for Cinl-made 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (data not shown). Furthermore, added synthetic 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL induced Tral-made AHLs (data not shown). These observations suggest that traM reduces *traI* induction when the level of TraR is low, but the induction of *traR* by BisR and 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL overcomes the inhibitory effect of TraM.

By analogy with what occurs in *A. tumefaciens* (Piper and Farrand, 2000; Swiderska et al., 2001), the effect of TraM could be to inhibit TraR induction of *traI*, or alternatively to inhibit BisR induction of *traR*. We tested these alternatives by introducing cloned *traM* on pIJ9379 into the wild-type *R. leguminosarum* bv. viciae strain A34 carrying *traI-lacZ* (pIJ9279) or *traR-lacZ* (pIJ7878). As expected *traI-lacZ* expression was repressed by cloned *traM*. Thus, after 24 h of growth, strain A34/pIJ9279 (*traI-lacZ*) had 10 120 (±265) units of β-galactosidase activity, whereas introduction of *traM* on pIJ9379 resulted in a 10-fold decrease in expression (to 1039 ± 46 units of activity). In contrast, the expression of *traR-lacZ* was increased when *traM* was present. Thus after 24 h of growth, A34/pIJ7878 had 4373 ± 143 units of activity, but *traM* on pIJ9379 resulted in an increase to 22 070 ± 92 units of activity. It is clear therefore that the effect of TraM cannot be to inhibit the induction of *traR* by BisR and so we conclude that TraM affects the activity of TraR. The increase of *traR-lacZ* expression seen when *traM* is present could be explained on the basis that, when *traI* expression is low due to direct inhibition of TraR by TraM, Tral-made AHLs would no longer inhibit BisR-dependent *traR-lacZ* expression, resulting in increased expression of *traR* (Fig. 9).

Discussion

A model for the regulation of *R. leguminosarum* bv. viciae pRL1JI *traI-trb* operon is shown in Fig. 9. Transfer of pRL1JI is strongly induced in response to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL made by potential recipient strains of *R. leguminosarum*. It is proposed that this mechanism of regulation has been achieved by placing the plasmid transfer regulatory gene *traR* under the control of BisR, which induces *traR* in response to externally produced 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (Fig. 9, step a). In order for recipient-induced transfer to operate, BisR also acts as a repressor, decreasing the expression of *cinI* (Fig. 9, step f), thereby greatly reducing the levels of endogenous 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL in strains carrying pRL1JI (Wilkinson et al., 2002). Once *traR* has been induced, the *traI-trb* operon is induced by TraR (Fig. 9, step b), and the positive quorum-sensing autoregulation by Tral-made AHLs results in high levels of expression of the *traI-trb* operon (Fig. 9, step c) and presumably other plasmid transfer operons. The high levels of C<sub>8</sub>-HSL and 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL, which are produced as a result of the strong induction of *traI*, can have a negative feedback effect by interfering with the induction of *traR* by BisR (Fig. 9, step d). This negative feedback is seen late in growth and may occur in part due to the very low level of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL required for the induction of *traR* by BisR, combined with the relatively high levels of Tral-made AHLs. In the absence of potential recipients, there is a low level of induction of the *traI-trb* operon, and this could be due to the very low level of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL that is produced in pRL1JI-containing strains (Lithgow et al., 2000; Wilkinson et al., 2002).

Recipient-induced plasmid transfer has been observed in *Enterococcus faecalis*, in which transfer of the sex plasmid to a potential recipient is dependent on the production of small peptides by the recipient (Dunny *et al.*, 1995). Once the sex plasmid has been transferred, production of the small peptides is inhibited as a result of the action of genes on the plasmid. In this way, plasmid transfer is only induced in the presence of potential recipients. There is a clear analogy in *R. leguminosarum*, because pRL1JI-determined BisR represses the production of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL produced by chromosomally determined CinI.

The mechanism of induction of pRL1JI transfer via induction of *traR* has a considerable degree of specificity, because, although AHLs are made by many diverse bacteria, production of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL appears to be restricted. Most strains of *R. leguminosarum* make this AHL (Hirsch, 1979; Wijffelman *et al.*, 1983) as does *R. etli* (Daniels *et al.*, 2002), but it has not been detected in the culture supernatants of closely related species such as *S. meliloti* and *A. tumefaciens*. However, several different long-chain AHLs are made by *S. meliloti*, including 3-oxo-tetradecanoyl and 3-oxo-hexadecenoyl homoserine lactones (Marketon *et al.*, 2002) and it will be interesting to establish if these AHLs can induce the *R. leguminosarum tra* system. The only report we are aware of in which 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL is made by a bacterium outside of the genus *Rhizobium* is in a strain of *P. fluorescens* (Laue *et al.*, 2000).

The activation of TraR for induction of the *traI-trb* operon has a relatively lower specificity for AHLs. In addition to induction of *traI* by TraI-made 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL, induction is also seen with C<sub>8</sub>-HSL, which is made by Rail and Rhil (Rodelas *et al.*, 1999; Wisniewski-Dye *et al.*, 2002) and by 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL. Furthermore, we observed induction of *traI-lacZ* by 3-OH-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL, the major AHL made by Rail, and the induction was similar to that seen with C<sub>8</sub>-HSL (data not shown). The observation that there was expression of the *traI-trb* operon late in stationary phase in the *traI* mutant presumably reflects the accumulation of Rail- and Rhil-made AHLs. On the basis of this observation, it can be predicted that a strain carrying a non-polar mutation in *traI* may induce low levels of plasmid transfer. This prediction remains to be tested.

It would appear that the crucial acquisition for optimal recipient-dependent regulation of pRL1JI transfer has been the acquisition of *bisR*. The *bisR* gene product is very similar to CinR and *bisR* may therefore have arisen by duplication of *cinR*. CinR is required for the induction of *cinI*, whose product makes 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL, but BisR represses *cinI* expression (Wilkinson *et al.*, 2002). Both BisR and CinR induce gene expression (of *traR* and *cinI* respectively) in response to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL. Repression of *cinI* expression by BisR could be envisioned to occur either by BisR forming inactive heterodimers with CinR,

or by BisR binding to the *cinI* promoter and forming an inactive transcriptional complex that blocks access by CinR.

The quorum-sensing relay formed by the induction of *traR* by BisR is rather unusual and establishes a very sensitive mechanism for the detection of and response to 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL produced extracellularly. In essence, the 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL seems to act as a type of sex pheromone recognized by pRL1JI-containing strains. There are several examples of bacteria containing two quorum-sensing systems in which the expression of one is regulated by the other. For example, in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, activation of LasR is dependent on 3-O-C12-HSL made by LasI. Once activated, LasR induces *rhlI*, resulting in the production of C<sub>4</sub>-HSL, which in turn is recognized by RhlR allowing several genes to be induced (Pearson *et al.*, 1995; Ochsner and Reiser, 1995). There are similar coupled regulatory quorum-sensing systems within *R. leguminosarum* and *R. etli*, in which expression of the *raiI-raiR* encoded quorum-sensing system depends on *cinI* and *cinR* (Wisniewski-Dye *et al.*, 2000; Daniels *et al.*, 2002). However, the BisR-TraR relay is somewhat different in that it is specifically adapted to detect an AHL made by bacteria other than the host cell. Clearly, the system has the potential to induce low levels of the *traI-trb* genes even in the absence of potential recipients, and in natural conditions the level of expression of the *traI-trb* genes could be increased by environmental factors which reduce the levels of BisR or TraM proteins. Nevertheless, the main role of the system seems to be to detect AHLs produced by other rhizobial strains. There are several examples of bacteria, which contain genes encoding LuxR-type regulators, but not AHL synthases. It is possible that the role of these regulators could be to detect the presence of other bacteria on the basis of the AHLs they produce (Michael *et al.*, 2001).

The induction of *traR* by added 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL is exquisitely sensitive with an apparent *K*<sub>m</sub> of less than 1 nM and this is matched by very sensitive induction of pRL1JI conjugation by 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL. Such a sensitive system must be tightly regulated if it is to avoid premature induction and it appears that TraM may act to inhibit the activity of TraR. We speculate that the role of *traM* on pRL1JI is analogous to that of *traM* in *A. tumefaciens* and inhibits TraR activity in the absence of potential recipients. In *A. tumefaciens* TraM is proposed to inhibit induction of *traI* expression by binding to TraR and preventing it from binding to promoters (Hwang *et al.*, 1999; Luo *et al.*, 2000; Swiderska *et al.*, 2001). TraM of *R. leguminosarum* inhibits the induction of *traI* by TraR (Fig. 9, step e). In *A. tumefaciens* TraM inhibition of *traI* expression is overcome by an increase in *traR* expression, resulting in an increase in TraR which titres out TraM. Enough TraR is then present to induce *traI* (Hwang *et al.*, 1999). In *R. leguminosarum*,
3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL increases *traR* expression, and this presumably overcomes the inhibitory effect of TraM, by increasing the level of TraR. *R.* leguminosarum bv. viciae strain A34 does produce a low level of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL (Lithgow *et al.*, 2000), so the role of TraM may be to prevent early induction of plasmid transfer. A similar conclusion was reached about the function of TraM in *Rhizobium* sp. NGR 234 (He *et al.*, 2003). In *A.* tumefaciens mutation of *traM* affects plasmid transfer, such that even at low population densities, plasmid transfer occurs at a high frequency (Piper and Farrand, 2000).

One of the consequences of the BisR-TraR quorum-sensing relay is that the growth of bacteria containing *bisR* and *traR* is inhibited by AHLs. The growth inhibitory effect of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL is well recognized (Gray *et al.*, 1996; Schripsema *et al.*, 1996, Lithgow *et al.*, 2000) but it was recently demonstrated that growth inhibition also requires shorter chain AHLs such as 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL or C<sub>8</sub>-HSL (Wilkinson *et al.*, 2002). Both *bisR* and *traR* are required for growth sensitivity, and both 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL and 3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL (or C<sub>8</sub>-HSL) are required for inhibition. Therefore the growth sensitivity seems to be due to the resulting high levels of expression of *traR* as was also observed with another strain of *Rhizobium* (He *et al.*, 2003). The role of TraR in growth inhibition has yet to be established, but it is not related to expression of genes on pRL1JI because the cloned *bisR* and *traR* genes cause growth sensitivity in different *Agrobacterium* and *Rhizobium* strains (Wilkinson *et al.*, 2002).

### Experimental procedures

#### Microbiological techniques
*Rhizobium* and *Agrobacterium* strains were grown at 28°C in TY medium (Beringer, 1974), and *Escherichia coli* at 37°C in L medium (Sambrook *et al.*, 1989). Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations (µg ml<sup>−1</sup>): streptomycin, 400; kanamycin, 20; gentamicin, 20; spectinomycin, 200; tetracycline 10; rifampicin 20. Bacterial growth was monitored at 600 nm using an MSE Spectroplus spectrophotometer. Units of β-galactosidase activity were measured as described by Miller (1972) using a Titertek Multiscan Spectrophotometer. Cultures were grown for 2 days in TY medium containing the appropriate antibiotics, diluted 1:1000 and then grown for 24 h in fresh medium. Where required, AHLs were added at the time of dilution to the final concentrations stated. When AHL extracts from 8401 or A34 were added, they were added at an amount equivalent to twice the concentration that was extracted from a 48 h culture in stationary phase.

Conjugal transfer experiments between *Rhizobium* or *Agrobacterium* strains were done as filter matings on TY medium. Cultures grown for 2 days on TY slopes (10 ml of TY agar) were resuspended in 3 ml of TY medium to a density of approximately 10<sup>9</sup> cells ml<sup>−1</sup>. Equal volumes of donor and recipient suspensions were mixed and 50 µl of

the mix was plated on a 0.2 µm nitrocellulose filter on a TY agar plate. The plates were incubated for 18 h at 28°C, the bacteria were resuspended from the filters in 2 ml of water and dilutions were plated onto the appropriate selective media. When used, AHLs were added to the filter mating plates as indicated. For the routine transfer of plasmids from *E.* coli to *Rhizobium* or *Agrobacterium* strains, patch matings were done on TY agar medium using *E.* coli DH5α Carrying pRK2013 as helper. Transductions were done with bacteriophage RL38 (Buchanan-Wollaston, 1979).

#### Bacterial strains and plasmids
The strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 4. *R.* leguminosarum strain 8401 lacks a symbiotic plasmid, and all *Rhizobium* strains used are derivatives of 8401. A683 was constructed as follows. Plasmid pIJ7668 carrying the *trbL-trbl* region was mutagenized with Tn5-*lacZ*. A mutation in *trbL* was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The EcoRI fragment carrying the *trbL2::Tn5-lacZ* allele was cloned into the *sacB* suicide plasmid pJQ200 KS on an Apal–Spel fragment. The resulting plasmid (pIJ7937) was conjugated into A34 and a *trbL* mutant was formed by recombination, selecting with kanamycin and sucrose and screening for gentamicin sensitivity (Quandt and Hynes, 1993). A686 carrying a spectinomycin resistance cassette in *bisR* and a Tn5-*lacZ* mutation in *trbL* was made as follows. pIJ7951 was firstly made by cloning a 2.2 kb *PstI* fragment carrying *bisR* and *traR* into pUC18, then cloning a *Smal* spectinomycin-resistance cassette from pHIP45Ω (Prentki and Krisch, 1984) into the unique EcoRV site and then cloning the *PstI* fragment into pJQ200KS. pIJ7951 (carrying *bisR2::Ω* spec) was then conjugated into A683, selecting for spectinomycin- and sucrose-resistant colonies that were gentamicin sensitive. The insertions were confirmed by DNA hybridization. A717 was made by transducing A683 to spectinomycin resistance, using phage RL38 propagated on A664 (*cinl3::Ω* spec).

In order to construct the *tral* mutant A782, pIJ9036 was mutagenized with Tn5. DNA from the mutagenized clones was pooled and EcoRI fragments were cloned into pBBR1-MCS5 selecting for gentamicin- and kanamycin-resistant colonies. These plasmids were conjugated into *A.* tumefaciens A676 carrying pIJ7867 (*bisR*, *traR*) and a colony-based *C.* violaceum bioassay was used to identify mutations that blocked the *tral*-dependent induction of violacein production. One such plasmid was pIJ9173. The EcoRI–BamHI kanamycin resistant fragment from pIJ9173 was cloned into pUC18 and the position of the Tn5 insertion was determined by sequencing from the resulting plasmid using p22 (GAAGTCAGATCCTGGAAAAACGGGAA), a primer that binds to the end of Tn5. A *Smal–Xbal* fragment from pIJ9173 was subcloned into pJQ200SK and the Tn5 mutation was recombined onto pRL1JI, selecting sucrose-resistant gentamicin-sensitive colonies (A782). The presence of the *tral* mutation in A782 (*tral1::Tn5*) was confirmed by PCR and by DNA hybridization. *A.* tumefaciens strains A676 and A677 were made by selecting spontaneous rifampicin-resistant or streptomycin-resistant mutants of C58.00. *A.* tumefaciens strain A894 carrying pRL1JI was made by

conjugating *R. leguminosarum* A61 with *A. tumefaciens* A677, selecting for streptomycin- and kanamycin-resistant transconjugants.

To make pIJ9265, the 7 kb fragment carrying *tral* was cut from pIJ9036 using EcoRI and subcloned into pBBr1-MCS5. A BamHI fragment was deleted from pIJ9265 to make pIJ9300. The *tral–lacZ* transcriptional fusion plasmid pIJ9279 was made by subcloning a 1 kb *BamHI–HindIII* fragment from pIJ9036 into pMP220. To make pIJ9379, *traM* was amplified from pIJ7665 by PCR using primers P117 (AAGAGAGCTCATGTGCCCTCATGTGGGCG) and P118 (CGCCGAATTCGTTCAGGCTACGCAG). These primers were designed from the sequence of *traM* previously obtained (Wilkinson *et al.*, 2002) and altered to incorporate

Sacl and EcoRI sites respectively. The PCR product obtained was digested with Sacl and EcoRI and cloned into the Sacl–EcoRI sites of pBBr1-MCS5 to form pIJ9379. To make pIJ9575, *cinl* and *cinR* were subcloned on an EcoRI–BamHI fragment into the EcoRI–BglII sites of pMP220. pIJ9577 was made by PCR amplifying *traR* using the primers, ATGAATTCTTGAATGACGCACCTAAGAAATTTG and GTTCCTCTAGACGTGATGAATGAG containing engineered EcoRI and Xbal sites respectively. *traR* was cloned from the product as a 720 bp EcoRI–BamHI fragment into pBBr1-MCS2 to make pIJ9576, such that *traR* was expressed from the vector promoter. pIJ9581 was made by cloning *bisR* on a 1.3 kb HindIII fragment from pIJ7630, such that *bisR* is expressed from the vector promoter.

Molecular biology techniques

DNA cloning, ligations, transformation, restriction enzyme mapping and DNA hybridization were carried out using standard methods (Sambrook et al., 1989). The sequencing reactions were carried out using the Amersham Thermosequenase and Applied Biosystems Big Dye kits and an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer (ABI 377). The sequenced region is deposited as GenBank Accession Nos AY177731 and AY177751. Database searches of the protein sequence were done using the BLAST and FASTA (Altschul et al., 1990) programs to find related sequences in the EMBL and SWISSPROT protein sequence databases.

Assay of AHLs

For AHL extractions, 200 ml cultures of agrobacteria and rhizobia were grown for 36 h in AB (Cha et al., 1998) or TY medium respectively. The cells were removed by centrifugation, and the AHLs were extracted from culture supernatants as described previously (Winson et al., 1995). AHLs were separated by TLC as described by Shaw et al. (1997) and AHLs were revealed using *C. violaceum* CV026 (McClean et al., 1997) or *A. tumefaciens* NT1/pZLR4 (Cha et al., 1998) as the AHL indicator organism. Sensitivity to and production of 3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL were assayed using the small bacteriocin test (Wijffelman et al., 1983).

For chemical characterization of AHLs, a 10 ml preculture was grown in minimal medium (*Y* mannitol for *R. leguminosarum* and AB glycerol for *A. tumefaciens* strains) plus the appropriate antibiotics. After 2 days, 0.5 ml was used to inoculate a 1 l culture, which was shaken at 28°C for 48 h. The cultures were centrifuged (40 min at 8000 g at 4°C), and the supernatant was pumped through a 1 ml C18 reverse phase (Sep-Pak) cartridge (Waters Corporation, Ref. WAT051910) at a rate of 1 ml min<sup>−1</sup>. The Sep-Pak cartridge was washed with 5 ml of water and then eluted with 40 ml of acetonitrile. The samples were dried on a rotary evaporator, resuspended in acetonitrile and stored at −20°C.

In order to isolate individual components made by TraI, a TLC was run with AHL extract from A676 carrying pIJ7867 (*bisR traR*) and pIJ9265 (*traI*). Lane 1 of the TLC contained AHL extract corresponding to the equivalent of 5 ml of culture supernatant and lanes 2–6 each contained AHL extract corresponding to 200 ml of culture supernatant. After the TLC had been run, lane 1 was cut from the TLC and AHLs were revealed by overlaying the TLC with agar seeded with *A. tumefaciens* NT1/pZLR4 (Shaw et al., 1997). The bioassayed TLC was aligned with the non-assayed TLC and the matrix corresponding to each bioactive component was scraped from the non-assayed plate. The matrix was extracted twice with acetone, which was then blown down under nitrogen to dryness. The extracts were resuspended in 20 or 100 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid and 45% water. Synthetic standards were diluted to 50 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> in the same solvent. Samples were then introduced into the positive ion electron spray mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 20 μl s<sup>−1</sup> under the following conditions: capillary tip voltage 3.5 KV; HV lens voltage 0.5 KV; extraction voltage 40 V; temperature 70°C.

The AHLs, *N*-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C<sub>6</sub>-HSL), *N*-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-O-C<sub>6</sub>-HSL), *N*-

octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C<sub>8</sub>-HSL), *N*-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-HSL) and *N*-(3-hydroxytetradecenoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-OH-C<sub>14:1</sub>-HSL) were synthesized (Chhabra et al., 1993) and kindly provided by Dr Siri Ram Chhabra, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Nottingham.
