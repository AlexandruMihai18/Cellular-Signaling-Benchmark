quite different from the pattern of LC3-modifications (Fig. 2). The data suggested that, in mammals, there will be functional divergence between the modification of LC3-I to LC3-II and that of GABARAP-I to GABARAP-II. Recently, Atg8L/Apg8L has been reported to interact with hAtg4B (Hemelaar et al., 
as for the cleavage of the carboxyl terminal region of Atg8. It has not been shown, however, if Atg4 directly delipidates Atg8-PE to Atg8 or indirectly activates an as yet unidentified delipidating enzyme.

In mammals, hAtg4B delipidates endogenous LC3-II and GABARAP-II in vitro (Fig. brane marker, i.e. a functional Atg8 homologue in mammalian autophagy.

In an attempt to evaluate the role of the other two homologues in autophagy, we analyzed endogenous level of these homologues in rat tissues. Rats were starved for 12h and various tissues were isolated. They were homogenized, centrifuged at 100,000 ×

These bacteria then either break out of the phagosome to enter the cytoplasm, or remain and proliferate in the phagosome by preventing its fusion with a lysosome to form a mature phagolysosome
tion of the beclin 1 gene results in a high incidence
of spontaneous tumors in mice (Qu et al., 2003; Yue, Jin, Yang, Levine, & Heintz, 2003), although the
remaining wild-type allele is neither mutated nor si-
lenced. Hence, beclin 1 is a haplo-insufficient tumor
suppressor gene. This is
rimmed vacuoles is a hallmark of this disease. The gene responsible for DMRV has been identified as that encoding the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine (Eisenberg et al., 2001). This gene is necessary for sialic acid biosynthesis, making the involvement of a mutant gene in the accumulation of rimmed
tophagy may also contribute to cellular death mechanisms. Type II autophagic cell death is frequently observed when type I apoptosis is inhibited or when a cell-death-related kinase, such as DAP kinase, is overexpressed (for review, see (Bursch, 2001)). It has been recently found that glucose deprivation in the rat cardiomyocyte-derived cell line H9c2 induced cell death
