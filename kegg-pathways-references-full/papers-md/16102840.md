### Abstract

Recent evidence indicates that ethanol modulates the function of specific intracellular signaling cascades, including those that contain cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), the tyrosine kinase Fyn, and phospholipase D (PLD). In some cases, the specific components of these cascades appear to mediate the effects of ethanol, whereas other components indirectly modify responses to ethanol. Studies utilizing selective inhibitors and genetically modified mice have identified specific isoforms of proteins involved in responses to ethanol. The effects of ethanol on neuronal signaling appear restricted to certain brain regions, partly due to the restricted distribution of these proteins. This likely contributes specificity to ethanol’s actions on behavior. This review summarizes recent work on ethanol and intracellular signal transduction, emphasizing studies that have identified specific molecular events that underlie behavioral responses to ethanol.

proteins and much knowledge has been gained regarding the actions of ethanol at specific receptor- and voltage-gated ion channels and transporters. Less well studied are ethanol’s effects on intracellular signaling cascades. Early experiments in this field were predominantly focused upon in vitro treatment of cultured cells with relatively high concentrations of ethanol (up to 200 mM), based upon blood alcohol concentrations found in human alcoholics (Diamond & Messing, 1994; Messing & Diamond, 1997). These cultured cells were then treated with pharmacological kinase inhibitors, many of which have subsequently been shown to exhibit a broader target range than originally thought (Alessi, 1997; Leemhuis et al., 2002; Voutilainen-Myllyla et al., 2003; Thomas et al., 2004; Dokladda et al., 2005). Recent research has taken advantage of more sophisticated molecular techniques to focus attention on individual proteins and their response to alcohol in specific brain regions of transgenic and normal animals. In this review, we will examine research aimed at understanding how ethanol’s effects on intracellular signaling cascades are transformed into specific outputs, emphasizing research that encompasses both in vitro model systems and in vivo behavioral studies.

### 2. Adenylyl cyclases and protein kinase A

Several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators act at G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which either increase (Gₛ-coupled) or decrease (Gᵢ-coupled) the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC), depending on the type of G protein that they stimulate (reviewed in Mailliard & Diamond, 2004). AC generates cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP), which is required to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Increased PKA activity results in the phosphorylation of downstream targets, including the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Numerous receptors signal through the cAMP–PKA pathway, including many that are widely expressed in the brain, such as receptors for acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine, somatostatin (reviewed in Brandon et al., 1997), opioids (Waldhoer et al., 2004), and cannabinoids (Howlett et al., 2004).

Ethanol stimulates cAMP signaling through at least 2 mechanisms (Fig. 1). One involves ethanol inhibition of the cell surface, type I equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1), which leads to the accumulation of extracellular adenosine and, thus, the stimulation of adenosine A2a receptors in cultured NG108-15 cells (Nagy et al., 1990). Since A2a receptors are coupled to Gₛ, this increases levels of intracellular cAMP and stimulates PKA (Mailliard & Diamond, 2004). Several studies illustrate the potential importance of ENT1 and A2a receptors in mediating the effects of ethanol in vivo. Mice lacking ENT1 (Choi et al., 2004) or A2a receptors (Naassila et al., 2002) show a reduced level of response to ethanol and increased ethanol

**Fig. 1. Ethanol stimulation of cAMP signaling.** Ethanol inhibits purine reuptake through the type I equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1). This increases the levels of extracellular adenosine, which can activate A1 or A2a receptors. The activation of A2a receptors leads to the activation of Gαs-coupled adenylyl cyclase (AC), increasing the generation of cAMP. In cells expressing AC7, ethanol can enhance receptor coupled cyclase activity via a PKCδ-dependent mechanism. Increased cAMP promotes the dissociation of regulatory subunits of PKA from catalytic subunits, permitting PKA to phosphorylate substrates such as CREB. PKA phosphorylation of CREB in the nucleus accumbens may stimulate changes in gene expression that promote alcohol self-administration (see text).

preference drinking. Indirect activation of adenosine A2a receptors by ethanol is thought to be important for ethanol self-administration. Treatment with the A2 antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-l-propargylxanthine (DMPX) produces a bimodal effect on operant self-administration of ethanol in rats, with high doses (1–20 mg/kg i.p.) reducing and low doses (1 mg/kg) promoting self-administration. In light of results with A2a knockout mice, this biphasic response may reflect a nonspecific effect of the drug at high doses. On the other hand, the knockout model may mimic chronic rather than acute blockade of the receptor, and therefore, an alternative explanation may be that the low dose of DMPX produces only a partial blockade of A2 receptors which the rats will work to overcome (Arolfo et al., 2004).

Downstream of ENT1 and A2a, Gₛ also appears to be a key member of this pathway in vivo. The α-subunit of Gₛ (Gₛα) is more abundant in mesolimbic brain regions of alcohol preferring rats and in the red blood cells of humans with increased risk of alcoholism (reviewed in Chandler et al., 2004). Mice with targeted disruption of one Gₛα allele show increased sensitivity to the sedative–hypnotic effects of ethanol and reduced ethanol consumption, whereas mice expressing a constitutively active form of Gₛα in the forebrain have decreased sensitivity to the sedative–hypnotic effects of ethanol, although their voluntary ethanol consumption is normal (Wand et al., 2001).

Gₛα directly binds to and activates adenylyl cyclase (AC). Another mechanism for ethanol regulation of cAMP signaling may involve stimulation of specific isoforms of AC by ethanol. Among the 9 known AC isoforms, AC7 is 2–3 times more sensitive to ethanol than any other isoform, with types 2, 5, and 6 being moderately sensitive and types 1 and 3 being insensitive (Yoshimura & Tabakoff, 1995). These effects of ethanol on AC activity require the presence
of an exogenous stimulus, such as prostaglandin E1, and are independent of actions of ethanol on adenosine transport or activation of adenosine A2a receptors (Yoshimura & Tabakoff, 1995; Tabakoff et al., 2001). The activity of AC7 is also stimulated by treatment with phorbol esters, which activate several protein kinase C (PKC) isozy mes. This causes phosphorylation of AC7, which enhances its coupling to activated Gαs. Ethanol also stimulates the phosphorylation of AC7, and both ethanol-induced and phorbol ester-induced enhancement of AC7 activity and stimulation of AC7 phosphorylation are inhibited by a peptide inhibitor of PKCδ or by the expression of a dominant negative, inactive PKCδ (Nelson et al., 2003). It is not known whether ethanol stimulates PKCδ signaling or if PKCδ activity is merely required to permit ethanol modulation of AC7. AC7 protein displays a restricted distribution in the CNS, being found in the molecular and the Purkinje cell layers in the cerebellum, the neuropil of the caudate–putamen, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and cell bodies of cortical pyramidal neurons and interneurons of the hippocampus and cerebel lum (Mons et al., 1998). The apparent requirement for PKCδ in mediating ethanol’s effects on AC7 may provide an extra level of specificity for ethanol’s effects on AC function, as PKCδ also shows a restricted distribution in the CNS, overlapping with AC7 in a few regions, such as the molecular and Purkinje cell layers of the cerebellum (Merenthaler et al., 1993). Thus, the presence of PKCδ and AC7 together in the same cells may yield a cAMP–PKA cascade that is supersensitive to the effects of ethanol in very specific brain regions.

It is not yet known if ethanol enhancement of AC7 activation is important for behavioral responses to ethanol in vivo. However, recent evidence (Maas et al., 2005) indicates that the calcium-sensitive adenyl cyclases AC1 and AC8 are important, as mice lacking these isoforms show altered responses to ethanol. Specifically, double-knockout mice lacking both AC1 and AC8 show reduced voluntary ethanol consumption but increased sensitivity to the sedative hypnotic effects of ethanol. Conversely, mice lacking only AC1 show a slightly increased sensitivity to the sedative hypnotic effects of ethanol but normal consumption, whereas mice lacking only AC8 show normal sensitivity but decreased consumption. These results suggest that while both isoforms contribute to sedation, only AC8 contributes to ethanol reward, perhaps due to the differential expression patterns of these 2 isoforms within the brain. Consistent with results described earlier (Yoshimura & Tabakoff, 1995), ethanol did not directly stimulate the activity of calcium-stimulated adenyl cyclases (Maas et al., 2005), indicating that the effects of ethanol on AC1 and AC8 are indirect.

Ethanol-induced activation of adenyl cyclases increases the activity of PKA isoforms. PKA is a tetramer composed of a regulatory homodimer and 2 catalytic subunits. cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits, causing the release of active catalytic subunits, which then phosphorylate nearby targets.

In mammals, there are 4 different regulatory subunit genes, RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ, and 2 different catalytic genes, Cα and Cβ. Treatment of NG108-15 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 hr stimulates the movement of Cα and RIIβ into the nucleus, where Cα phosphorylates CREB to stimulate gene transcription (Constantinescu et al., 1999). RI and Cβ do not translocate to the nucleus but are still involved in ethanol-stimulated, CREB-mediated gene transcription through mechanisms that require the transcription co-factor CREB binding protein (CBP; Constantinescu et al., 2002, 2004).

The importance of ethanol stimulation of PKA signaling has been demonstrated in behavioral studies with transgenic and knockout mice. Transgenic mice that express R(AB), a dominant inhibitor isoform of the regulatory subunit of PKA under the control of CaMKIIα promoter show reduced PKA activity limited to the hippocampus and forebrain but normal activity in the cerebellum and other brain regions (Wand et al., 2001). These mice are more sensitive to ethanol-induced sedation and show lower preference for ethanol compared with wild-type littermates, similar to mice deficient in Gsα. Because of the restricted expression pattern of the R(AB) transgene, the data suggest that the stimulation of PKA signaling by ethanol in the hippocampus, cortex, striatum, or nucleus accumbens acts to dampen acute responses to ethanol and stimulate ethanol self-administration. This hypothesis is further strengthened by studies with knockout mice lacking RIIβ, which are predicted to have increased brain PKA activity and show increased voluntary ethanol consumption and reduced sensitivity to the hypnotic effects of ethanol (Thiele et al., 2000). In the same study, ethanol consumption was normal in mice lacking RIβ or CβI, suggesting that the RIIβ subunit is specifically involved in mediating acute ethanol sensitivity and self-administration, whereas RIβ and CβI are not. However, the observation that RIβ and CβI are affected by ethanol treatment in vitro suggests that they could be involved in other behavioral effects of ethanol.

### 2.1. Cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate-responsive element binding protein

A large volume of recent work has focused on the role of CREB as a regulator of addictive behavior (reviewed in Nestler, 2004), including alcoholism (Pandey et al., 2005). CREB belongs to the bZIP superfamily of transcription factors. The most abundant CREB isoforms, CREBα and CREBΔ, contain a kinase inducible domain (KID) that has a serine residue at position 133 (Lonze & Ginty, 2002). The phosphorylation of Ser-133 in response to stimuli enables CREB to bind to CBP (CREB binding protein), which can trigger the expression of more than 100 genes containing functional response elements (CREs) in their promoters, providing a role for CREB in many biological processes (Mayr & Montminy, 2001). Among the genes that are regulated by CREB are many that modulate behavioral responses to alcohol in animals, including enkephalin,
dynorphin, corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuropeptide (NPY; Pandey, 2004).

pCREB levels and CRE-mediated gene expression are substantially changed in several brain regions in response to drugs of abuse (Nestler, 2001). Chronic exposure to cocaine (Self et al., 1998), amphetamine (Cole et al., 1995; Turgeon et al., 1997; Shaw-Lutchman et al., 2003), or morphine (Barrot et al., 2002) increases the levels of pCREB in the striatum, a brain region important for the locomotor-activating and rewarding effects of drugs. Increasing striatal pCREB by locally activating PKA or increasing CREB levels through viral-mediated gene transfer reduces the rewarding effects of cocaine and opiates, as measured by place conditioning paradigms (Carlezon et al., 1998; Barrot et al., 2002). It is thought that this promotes drug self-administration since more drug must be consumed to achieve a satisfying level of reward (Nestler, 2001).

Ethanol also alters pCREB levels in rodents, and levels of pCREB appear to modulate ethanol self-administration. Acute exposure to intoxicating doses of ethanol leads to a 1.8-fold increase in striatal pCREB in association with enhanced expression of proenkephalin, a CREB-regulated gene, whereas chronic ethanol exposure is associated with a diminished effect of an ethanol rechallenge on striatal pCREB levels (Yang et al., 1998). The hypothesis that elevations in pCREB in the nucleus accumbens promotes ethanol self-administration is consistent with studies noted above of transgenic and gene targeted mice with altered PKA signaling (Thiele et al., 2000; Wand et al., 2001) and with our recent study of mice lacking ENT1 (Choi et al., 2004). ENT1-null mice show a reduced level of response to ethanol and increased ethanol preference. This is associated with reduced basal presynaptic A₁ receptor activation leading to increased glutamate release and increased glutamate-receptor-stimulated pCREB in the NAc (Choi et al., 2004). This is likely mediated by calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), which, like PKA, phosphorylates CREB on Ser-133 and is the most important Ca²⁺-activated CREB kinase in vivo (Ho et al., 2000). We hypothesized that if increased striatal pCREB is causally related to enhanced ethanol consumption in ENT1-null mice, then increasing A₁ receptor activity should decrease ethanol preference. Indeed, treatment with the A₁ receptor agonist N⁶ cyclopentyladenosine reduced ethanol self-administration in ENT1-null mice but had no effect in wild-type littermates. These results indicate that A₁ receptors regulate CREB activity through glutamate-dependent phosphorylation, and that this, in turn, modulates self-administration of ethanol. Further work is needed to determine which CREB-regulated genes mediate this response.

In contrast to evidence indicating that striatal pCREB promotes ethanol self-administration, elevations in pCREB in other brain regions may suppress ethanol consumption. Mice made haplodeficient for the 2 major CREB isoforms, α and Δ, by gene targeting show increased ethanol

preference, while sucrose preference is normal (Pandey et al., 2004). These mice have reduced total levels of pCREB as well as the cAMP-inducible genes BDNF and NPY throughout the brain but show a compensatory increase in levels of the β isoform of CREB. These mice also show increased anxiety-like behavior and an attenuated response to the anxiolytic effects of ethanol as well as diminished ethanol stimulation of CREB phosphorylation and NPY expression in the central and medial amygdala. Thus, it is argued that increased anxiety associated with diminished amygdala pCREB may stimulate ethanol self-administration in these mice, in part, by decreasing levels of NPY (Pandey, 2003) since NPY-deficient mice also show increased ethanol preference drinking (Thiele et al., 1998). These studies demonstrate the importance of examining signaling pathways within an anatomical context since identical pathways in different brain regions can evoke different or even opposite behavioral responses to ethanol.

### 2.2. DARPP-32

A major route by which ethanol is thought to produce intoxication is by inhibiting NMDA receptors (Lovinger et al., 1989), but the activation of NMDA receptors is also important for ethanol reward and reinforcement (Biala & Kotlinska, 1999). This apparent contradiction may be explained by differential sensitivity of NMDA receptors in different brain regions to inhibition by ethanol (Fig. 2). Recent evidence indicates that the dopamine- and cAMP-regulated-phosphoprotein, Mr 32 kDa (DARPP-32) is particularly important in this process.

DARPP-32 is abundant in striatal neurons that receive dopaminergic inputs and, when phosphorylated by PKA at Thr-34, becomes a potent inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP1 (Naim et al., 2004). Ethanol increases the firing rate of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA; Gessa et al., 1985), thereby increasing dopamine release in the NAcc (Gonzales & Weiss, 1998). The activation of D1 dopamine receptors on medium spiny neurons in the NAcc activates PKA and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (Hemmings et al., 1984; Fienberg et al., 1998). Phospho-Thr-34–DARPP-32 inhibits the function of PP1, which would otherwise dephosphorylate NR1 subunits of NMDA receptors present on medium spiny neurons. The result is an increased level of NMDA receptor phosphorylation that counteracts the inhibition of receptor function by ethanol (Maldve et al., 2002). The hypothesis that DARPP-32 mediated resistance to ethanol inhibition might be important for ethanol reward is supported by behavioral observations in DARPP-32-null mice, which show decreased ethanol self-administration and no conditioned place preference for ethanol, but maintain normal ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion and show enhanced locomotor stimulation by ethanol (Risinger et al., 2001). These results indicate that DARPP-32 selectively modulates ethanol reward and ethanol self-

Fig. 2. Phosphorylation antagonizes ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptor function. In the hippocampus (top), ethanol initially inhibits NMDA receptors, but this is subsequently antagonized by the phosphorylation of NR2B by Fyn. Fyn resides in a complex with NMDA receptors by binding to the scaffolding protein RACK1. When bound, Fyn is inactive. Ethanol disrupts this interaction, permitting Fyn to interact and phosphorylate NR2B. This occurs over several minutes and may contribute to acute tolerance of hippocampal NMDA receptors to inhibition by alcohol. In the striatum (bottom), NMDA receptors are relatively resistant to inhibition by ethanol. This appears to require DARPP-32. Ethanol stimulates dopamine release into the nucleus accumbens, which activates D1 receptors, stimulating PKA. PKA phosphorylates NR1 subunits, which may diminish the inhibitory effect of ethanol on NMDA receptor function. Normally, the phosphatase PP1 rapidly dephosphorylates NR1 subunits, but this is antagonized by PKA phosphorylation of DARPP-32 on threonine-34. This activates the phosphatase inhibiting function of DARPP-32, preventing NR1 dephosphorylation and stabilizing the resistance of NMDA receptors to alcohol.

administration but not other behavioral effects of ethanol such as locomotor stimulation.

### 3. Fyn kinase

Another mechanism that modulates ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors involves the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn (Fig. 2). In hippocampal slices, acute tolerance to ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors begins ~15 min after an initial exposure to ethanol. This is associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors, which enhances NMDA receptor function and counters the inhibitory effects of ethanol (Miyakawa et al., 1997). Both ethanol-stimulated NR2B phosphorylation and acute tolerance of NMDA receptors to ethanol are absent in mice lacking Fyn, suggesting that Fyn is the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates NR2B (Miyakawa et al., 1997). In the hippocampus, Fyn is found in a trimolecular complex with the scaffolding protein RACK1 and NR2B (Yaka et al., 2003a). Ethanol treatment leads to the dissociation of this complex and Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of NR2B. Incubation of hippocampal slices with RACK1 conjugated to a transmembrane delivery peptide derived from the HIV tat protein inhibits acute tolerance of NMDA receptors to ethanol, indicating that the release of Fyn from the complex with RACK1 is key to the development of NMDA receptor tolerance. The effect of ethanol appears to be indirect and mediated upstream by PKA, as ethanol does not directly stimulate Fyn kinase activity in vitro, and the PKA inhibitor H89 prevents ethanol-stimulated dissociation of the trimolecular complex.

cerebral cortex, Fyn and RACK1 do not form a complex with NR2B, ethanol does not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B, and acute tolerance of NMDA receptor function to ethanol does not occur (Yaka et al., 2003a). These results indicate that RACK1, like DARRP-32, modulates NMDA receptor sensitivity to ethanol, providing a molecular mechanism whereby ethanol has selective effects on NMDA receptor function in different brain regions.

The importance of Fyn kinase in regulating some of ethanol’s inhibitory effects on NMDA receptor function is confirmed by observations in transgenic mice. Knockout mice lacking Fyn kinase show an increased response to the hypnotic effects of ethanol, as measured by the loss of righting reflex assay (Miyakawa et al., 1997). This result has been confirmed with independently generated mice by a different group of researchers (Boehm et al., 2003), who also showed that Fyn-null mice have impaired acute tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol, a result that fits with the electrophysiological and biochemical observations in hippocampal slice preparations described above. In a separate study, Yaka et al. (2003b), who also observed an increase in loss of righting reflex duration in Fyn-null mice, found that pretreatment with the NR2B-specific NMDA receptor antagonist ifenprodil potentiates the effects of ethanol in wild-type but not in Fyn-null mice. This provides support for the model that the phosphorylation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors by Fyn is an important adaptive response to ethanol. This is further supported by the observation that the overexpression of Fyn in the forebrain reduces the duration of the ethanol-induced loss of the righting reflex (Boehm et al., 2004).

ethanol causes translocation of both PKCδ and PKCε to new intracellular compartments (Gordon et al., 1997), and exposure of the PC12 neuroendocrine cell line to ethanol for 2–6 days increases the abundance of PKCδ and PKCε, without altering the levels of PKCa, β, or ζ (Messing et al., 1991). In PC12 cells, increases in PKCδ are required for ethanol-induced increases in the density of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (Gerstin et al., 1998), which contribute to alcohol withdrawal seizures in alcohol-dependent rodents (Little et al., 1986). Increases in PKCε are required for ethanol enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (Hundle et al., 1997) and for increases in N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (McMahon et al., 2000) in PC12 cells. These in vitro studies provide clear examples of ethanol and PKC interactions, but the most informative studies have been with mice deficient in PKCγ and PKCε, which have demonstrated that PKCγ and PKCε play important roles in regulating behavioral responses to ethanol in vivo.

### 4. Protein kinase C

Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of phospholipid-dependent kinases that transduce signals involving lipid second messengers (Nishizuka, 2001; Olive & Messing, 2004). The family is encoded by 9 genes and is divided into 3 subclasses based on differences in structure and response to second messengers. Conventional cPKCs (α, β, and γ) are activated by calcium and diacylglycerol, novel nPKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ) are activated by diacylglycerol but not by calcium, and atypical aPKCs (ζ and τ/λ) are insensitive to calcium and diacylglycerol but are activated by other lipids and by phosphorylation. Splice variants exist for the β, δ, θ, and ζ isoforms, which adds to the complexity of the family. All isoforms except PKCθ are found in the brain, and PKCγ is found only in the central nervous system.

There is in vitro evidence that ethanol and other aliphatic *n*-alkanols can directly affect PKC activity, either activating or inhibiting PKC, depending on the assay conditions and type of alcohol (reviewed in Stubbs & Slater, 1999). Two-day exposure of NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells to

#### 4.1. Protein kinase Cγ

Mice lacking PKCγ show reduced sensitivity to the hypnotic (Harris et al., 1995) and anxiolytic (Bowers et al., 2001) effects of ethanol, as well as increased ethanol preference (Bowers & Wehner, 2001). The substrates of PKCγ responsible for mediating this behavior are unknown, but may include proteins that regulate the function of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, since GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are unresponsive to ethanol in tissue preparations from PKCγ-null mice (Harris et al., 1995). Interestingly, in the experiments described above, biochemical and behavioral measures of benzodiazepine sensitivity were unchanged. Since benzodiazepines also act through allosteric modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, this result indicates that the effect of PKCγ is specific for ethanol. PKCγ can be immunoprecipitated from rat cerebral cortex with the α1 and α4 subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and chronic ethanol exposure increases PKCγ association with α4, while decreasing association with α1 (Kumar et al., 2002). PKCγ-null mice also fail to develop chronic tolerance to the sedative-hypnotic and hypothermic effects of ethanol, although this phenotype depends on the genetic background of the mice (Bowers et al., 1999).

#### 4.2. Protein kinase Cε

Our laboratory found that the behavioral effects of ethanol are substantially altered in mice lacking PKCε. The level of response to the hypnotic effects of ethanol, as measured by the loss of righting reflex assay, is reduced in PKCε-null mice. They also consume ~75% less alcohol and show reduced ethanol preference compared with wild-type mice in a 2-bottle choice paradigm (Hodge et al., 1999). Restoration of PKCε expression in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and cerebellum by means of a tetracycline-regulated transgene restores ethanol intake and the hypnotic response to

ethanol to levels observed in wild-type mice, demonstrating that alcohol-related behaviors in PKCε-null mice are due to the absence of PKCε in adult neurons (Choi et al., 2002). Compared with wild type mice, PKCε-null mice also self-administer about 50% less ethanol in an operant self-administration paradigm and show much less of an increase in alcohol consumption stimulated by 4 days of alcohol deprivation, indicating that the reinforcing effect of ethanol and the propensity to exhibit relapse drinking after abstinence is decreased in these mice (Olive et al., 2000).

The mechanisms by which PKCε regulates responses to ethanol include effects on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. We found that responses to the positive allosteric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators pentobarbital, diazepam, and the neurosteroid pregnanolone are increased in mice lacking PKCε when compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, muscimol, a direct-acting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, elicited a similar degree of locomotor activation in both genotypes (Hodge et al., 1999; Hodge et al., 2002). These findings suggest that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in PKCε-null mice are supersensitive to positive allosteric modulators but not to direct agonists of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. To examine this possibility directly, we assayed GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function by measuring <sup>36</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup> uptake in microsacs isolated from the frontal cortex. Direct activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by muscimol evoked similar responses in microsacs from wild-type and PKCε-null mice, but ethanol, as well as the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam and the neurosteroid alphaxalone, caused much greater enhancement of muscimol-stimulated uptake in microsacs from PKCε-null mice. This enhanced sensitivity was reproduced in microsacs from wild-type mice following preincubation with the peptide εV1–2, which specifically inhibits PKCε (Johnson et al., 1996). This peptide had no effect on uptake in microsacs from PKCε-null mice, indicating that its effect required PKCε. Further evidence for PKCε modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is provided by electrophysiological recordings showing that ethanol (80 mM) enhances proximal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA1 hippocampal neurons from PKCε-null mice but not in neurons from wild-type mice (Proctor et al., 2003). These studies indicate that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in at least 2 brain regions, the hippocampus and frontal cortex, are modulated by PKCε and suggest that PKCε normally suppresses the regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by positive allosteric modulators.

Similar to its effects on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, ethanol potentiates the effects of glycine at glycine receptors. The inhibition of PKCε prevents this potentiation without altering the effect of glycine alone, suggesting that the activation of PKCε contributes to ethanol-induced potentiation of glycine receptors (Jiang & Ye, 2003). The behavioral correlates of this function are not yet known.

Another potential downstream target of PKCε is the N-type voltage-gated calcium channel, which regulates neurotransmitter release at many synapses. PKCε and N-type calcium channels form a functional complex through the

enigma homologue protein-1 (ENH1), which binds to the C-terminal portion of the Ca2.2α subunit of N-type channels and acts as a scaffolding protein for PKCε (Maeno-Hikichi et al., 2003). Treatment with the εV1–2 peptide inhibitor of PKCε impairs PKCε binding to ENH1 and prevents phorbol ester-induced potentiation of channel function. N-type channels may mediate a subset of behavioral responses to ethanol that are also regulated by PKCε since mice lacking N-type calcium channels show decreased ethanol preference drinking (Newton et al., 2004), similar to mice that lack PKCε (Hodge et al., 1999).

# 5. Phospholipase D

Although phospholipase D (PLD) is one of very few enzymes that can utilize ethanol as a substrate, there are few studies examining the interaction between PLD and ethanol in neuronal systems, and none that have examined the potential consequences of this on behavior. Under normal conditions, stimulation of PLD generates phosphatidic acid (PA) through the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine. PA is a second messenger for several proteins, including Raf-1, aPKCζ, nPKCε, phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 5-kinases, and the mammalian target for rapamycin (mTOR; Goto & Kondo, 1999; van Blitterswijk & Houssa, 2000; Fang et al., 2001; Lopez-Andreo et al., 2003). PA is rapidly converted to 1,2 diacylglycerol by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. However, PLD has more than a 1000-fold preference for ethanol and other short-chain alcohols over water (Frohman et al., 1999). Thus, in the presence of ethanol, PLD generates phosphatidylethanol (PEth), a unique phospholipid that is formed only in the presence of ethanol (Alling et al., 1984). PEth is readily incorporated into cell membranes but is a poor substrate for phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (Frohman et al., 1999). Therefore, the utilization of ethanol by PLD may affect cellular function in 2 ways: first, by preventing the generation of the second messenger PA, and second, by generating a novel phospholipid (PEth) that can affect the biophysical properties of cellular membranes and signal on its own.

Receptor-mediated PLD activation occurs in response to many different neurotransmitters in the nervous system, including opioids and excitatory amino acids, and ethanol inhibits PA production induced by these ligands (reviewed in Gustavsson, 1995). In mammalian cells, 2 isoforms of PLD have been identified, PLD1 and PLD2 (McDermott et al., 2004). A third type, which generates the endocannabinoid anandamide, cannot generate phosphatidylalcohols and is structurally and functionally unrelated to PLD1 and PLD2 (Okamoto et al., 2004). PLD1 and 2 are both expressed in the brain (Meier et al., 1999) and are abundant in the hippocampus (Colley et al., 1997). A detailed mapping of PLD distribution in the remainder of the CNS has not been performed, possibly due to an absence of high affinity

antibodies (McDermott et al., 2004). Humeau and coworkers demonstrated a key role for PLD1 in evoked acetylcholine release in *Aplysia* neurons, suggesting that the inhibition of PLD signaling by ethanol might reduce neurotransmitter release (Humeau et al., 2001).

PEth incorporation into membranes increases membrane fluidity, as well as a tolerance to the membrane-fluidizing effects of ethanol (Omodeo-Sale et al., 1991). This tolerance has been postulated to play a role in the development of tolerance to the intoxicating effects of ethanol (Rottenberg et al., 1992; Gustavsson, 1995). PEth may contribute to the long-term effects of ethanol since it can be measured in human subjects up to 14 days after ethanol exposure (Hansson et al., 1997). The longevity of PEth is thought to arise from it being a poor substrate for phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (McDermott et al., 2004).

PEth has some biological activity of its own, as it can substitute for phosphatidylserine in activating protein kinase C (Asaoka, 1989), activate cytosolic phospholipase A₂ (Chang et al., 2000), and inhibit phospholipase C (Nishida et al., 1997). All of these effects occur at micromolar concentrations of PEth, similar to those found following the exposure of cultured cells to ethanol (Aradottir et al., 2002; Varga & Alling, 2002). PEth can substitute for ethanol in cultured hepatocytes, where ethanol and PEth enhance angiotensin II-stimulated p42/44 MAPK activation (Aroor et al., 2002). Demonstrating that alterations in PLD signaling and PEth accumulation underlie some of the behavioral responses to ethanol exposure has been hampered by the lack of pharmacological agents with which to manipulate PLD. Future studies utilizing RNA interference, newer peptide inhibitors, or gene targeting should prove useful for such studies.

### 6. Discussion

It is clear from in vitro studies in cultured cells that ethanol modulates signal transduction through cascades that involve PKA and PKC. In vivo studies with genetically engineered mice have confirmed that components of these signaling cascades modulate behavioral responses to ethanol. In the brain, ethanol's effects are observed in specific brain regions depending on the presence of specific isoforms and other signaling molecules. This is most clearly demonstrated for downregulation of NMDA receptor sensitivity to ethanol, which is mediated by DARPP-32 in the striatum and Fyn kinase in the hippocampus. Opposing actions of differentially PKC isoforms on GABAₐ receptors also lend regional specificity to the effects of ethanol on GABAₐ receptor function since studies with knockout mice indicate that PKCγ supports whereas PKCε inhibits ethanol enhancement of GABAₐ receptors.

Studies with transgenic mice are not without problems, however, most notably those of genetic background (Wolfer et al., 2002), where the phenotype of transgenic mice may vary according to the background strain into which they are bred, as has been described for mice lacking PKCγ (Bowers et al., 1999). Other potential problems with transgenic mouse studies include the possibility of other genes compensating for that which has been knocked out, indirect effects of the knockout, such as metabolic or developmental changes that impact the behavior being studied, and the experimental limitations encountered using mice as opposed to higher organisms such as rats and primates. These problems have been recently reviewed (Crawley, 2000; Stephens et al., 2002).

Despite the documentation of several signaling cascades that are perturbed by alcohol, the specific molecular mechanisms by which ethanol produces its effects are uncertain. The direct effects of ethanol on ion channels and transporters such as ENT1 presumably activate changes in downstream signaling processes, and a molecular mechanism for these effects is emerging with the discovery of putative ethanol binding sites in certain ion channels (Trudell & Harris, 2004). The identification of phospholipase D as a widespread intracellular signaling molecule that interacts directly with ethanol also makes it a promising candidate as a common locus through which ethanol’s effects on seemingly diverse kinase pathways may be mediated.

The wide range of intra- and extracellular targets that appear to be directly (ion channels) or indirectly (kinases) affected by ethanol may make interpreting transgenic and animal studies problematic, especially where substrates for the kinase under study are not known or multiple substrates are suspected. An informative approach in these studies may be to determine behavioral responses to other pharmacological agents besides alcohol where the site of action is much more clearly defined, such as drugs that act at GABA or dopamine receptors. Narrowing down the range of pharmacological agents to which a particular genetically modified animal shows altered responses can help define the systems upon which the targeted signaling molecule acts in normal animals. For example, PKCε-null mice not only show enhanced behavioral responses to ethanol, but also to neurosteroids and benzodiazepines, indicating that PKCε regulates responses to positive allosteric modulators of GABAₐ receptors. In contrast, PKCε-null mice show normal behavioral responses to inhibitors of NMDA receptors. Taken together, these findings suggest that the altered ethanol phenotype of PKCε-null mice may be explained by perturbations in GABAₐ receptor function and not NMDA receptor function, despite both of these receptors being important targets for ethanol (Hodge et al., 1999).

Understanding how ethanol’s effects on intracellular signal transduction affect behavior also requires consideration of the expression pattern of signaling components in specific neuronal systems that regulate behavior. More sophisticated transgenic approaches using site-specific and

inducible promoters or local infection with viral vectors are now available where the expression of the gene of interest can be altered in specific brain regions and at specific times. For example, using such an approach, we found that restoring PKCε expression in the basal forebrain, amygdala, and cerebellum of adult PKCε-null mice using a tetracycline-regulated transgenic expression system switched their ethanol phenotype back to those of wild-type animals (Choi et al., 2002). Such an approach provides not only specific information about where and when an individual gene acts in the brain but also provides compelling evidence that modulation of the targeted gene can alter behavioral responses to ethanol. Such studies can be invaluable in the identification of molecules such as PKCε, whose absence or inhibition reduces ethanol self-administration, and thus provide potential drug targets for developing novel therapeutics to treat alcohol use disorders.
