**Summary**

L-selectin mediates lymphocyte homing by facilitating lymphocyte adhesion to addressins expressed in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of secondary lymphoid organs. Peripheral node addressin recognized by the MECA-79 antibody is apparently part of the L-selectin ligand, but its chemical nature has been undefined. We now identify a sulfated extended core1 mucin-type O-glycan, Galβ1→4(sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAc, as the MECA-79 epitope. Molecular cloning of a HEV-expressed core1-β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core1-β3GlcNAcT) enabled the construction of the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x on extended core1 O-glycans, recapitulating the potent L-selectin-mediated, shear-dependent adhesion observed with novel L-selectin ligands derived from core2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I null mice. These results identify Core1-β3GlcNAcT and its cognate extended core1 O-glycans as essential participants in the expression of the MECA-79-positive, HEV-specific L-selectin ligands required for lymphocyte homing.

**Introduction**

Sulfated oligosaccharides play diverse roles in development, differentiation, and homeostasis. They affect the binding of growth factors to receptors (Rapraeger et al., 1991; Yayon et al., 1991), clearance of circulating glycoprotein hormones (Fiete et al., 1991), adhesion of herpes simplex virus I to the cell surface (Shukla et al., 1999), formation of a transparent cornea (Akama et al.,

Core2GlcNAcT-I in mice is associated with retention of wild-type MECA-79 expression and normal lymphocyte homing activities (Ellies et al., 1998). These results imply either that other Core2GlcNAcTs (Core2GlcNAcT-II, Yeh et al., 1999; Core2GlcNAcT-III, Schwientek et al., 2000) may compensate for loss of Core2GlcNAcT-I in HEV of the mutant mice, or that oligosaccharides distinct from core2 branched oligosaccharides may function as L-selectin ligands in HEV.

To address these issues, we have defined the oligosaccharide structures remaining in PNAd present in Core2GlcNAcT-I null mice (Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ) and identify L-selectin ligands as sialylated and fucosylated forms of a sulfated extended core1 O-glycan, Galβ1→4(sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAc. Chemical synthesis of this glycan led to the discovery that it corresponds to the MECA-79 epitope. A newly cloned, HEV-expressed core1 extension-β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core1-β3GlcNAcT) confers the expression of 6-sulfo sLex in the extended core1 oligosaccharides, promoting potent L-selectin-dependent adhesion. Extended core 1-based L-selectin ligands are also implicated as prominent L-selectin ligands expressed by the HEV in wild-type since MECA-79 antibody treatment significantly reduces the lymphocyte adhesion to GlyCAM-1 from wild-type mouse HEV. Core1-β3GlcNAcT and its cognate extended core1 O-glycans therefore play dominant roles in L-selectin ligand biosynthesis, lymphocyte homing, and lymphocyte trafficking.

Results

Core2GlcNAcT-I-Deficient Mice Express Extended Core1 Structures

Assays of Core2GlcNAcT activity demonstrated that lymph nodes of Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ mice (Ellies et al., 1998) exhibited less than 4% of the Core2GlcNAcT activity exhibited by lymph nodes from wild-type mice. This reduction is as severe as that observed in the spleen and much more significant than that seen in the stomach (Figure 1A). These observations imply that core2-independent glycans are responsible for the potent residual L-selectin ligands expressed in Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ mice. To define the oligosaccharide structures remaining in HEV from Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ mice, MECA-79-positive glycoproteins were isolated from metabolically labeled wild-type and Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ lymph node. Analysis of [³H]-galactose-labeled glycoproteins from the spent medium revealed a major glycoprotein comigrating with GlyCAM-1 (Figure 1B). The cell lysates yielded additional [³H]-galactose-labeled L-selectin counterreceptors (Figure 1B).

[³H]-Galactose-labeled glycoproteins from the spent medium, which consist primarily of GlyCAM-1, were then subjected to structural analysis. After removal of sulfate and sialic acid, HPLC analysis of O-linked oligosaccharides derived from HEV of Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ mice showed a relatively simple profile compared with those from wild-type mice (Figures 1C and 1D). In particular, two major oligosaccharides derived from Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ mice (a and b) were different from core2 branch-containing oligosaccharides. Oligosaccharide b was converted to oli-

gosaccharide a after removal of fucose (Figure 1E), and then to core1 oligosaccharide, Galβ1→3GalNAc, after sequential glycosidase treatment (Figures 1F and 1G). Methylation analysis of [³H]-galactose-labeled oligosaccharides demonstrated that oligosaccharide b contains both terminal and 3-O-substituted galactoses (Figure 1I) in contrast to core2 oligosaccharides, which contain only terminal galactoses (Figure 1H). Together, these results demonstrate that oligosaccharide b is Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAc. To determine the positions of sialic acid and sulfate attachment, intact oligosaccharides from Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ mice were sequentially digested with specific glycosidases, including β-hexosaminidase A that cleaves both 6-sulfated and unsulfated N-acetylg glucosamine, producing core1 oligosaccharide (data not shown). These results taken together demonstrate that sulfated, extended core1 oligosaccharides of NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4[±Fucα1→3(Sulfo→6)]GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAc constitute the majority of the oligosaccharides elaborated by Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ HEV. It is noteworthy that no core2 branched oligosaccharides were detected.

Isolation of cDNA Encoding Core1 Extending β1,3-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase

The identification of extended core1 glycans expressed by Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ HEV predicted the existence of a relevant Core1-β3GlcNAcT. Previous work demonstrating a weak but discernable homology among three β1,3-galactosyltransferases (β3GalT) and one β3GlcNAcT (Zhou et al., 1999) led us to search the EST databases for cDNAs related to β3GlcNAcT. One of these human cDNAs (EST number AB015630), when coexpressed with human LSST, conferred expression of the MECA-79 antigen on CHO cells (see below). The full-length sequence of this cDNA (deposited with GenBank with the accession number AF293973) encodes an open reading frame of 1,116 base pairs and predicts a protein of 372 amino acid residues (42,514 Da). The protein is predicted to have a type II membrane topology representative of virtually all known mammalian glycosyltransferases (Schachter, 1994). In vitro, a soluble form of the protein adds N-acetylg glucosamine to the core1 Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→R, leading us to designate the enzyme Core1-β3GlcNAcT (Figure 2). It is noteworthy that the enzyme can also add N-acetylg lucosamine to core2 Galβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAcα1→R (Figure 2), indicating that core1 extension can occur after the core2 branch has been added, but no βGalT activity was detected. The expression of Core1-β3GlcNAcT resulted in the expression of i antigen, Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R, on HeLa cells (data not shown), confirming the β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity (Watanabe et al., 1979) of Core1-β3GlcNAcT.

Core1-β3GlcNAcT Is Expressed in HEV

Northern blot analysis demonstrated that Core1-β3GlcNAcT transcripts of 5.5 and 2.4 kb are expressed in the small and large intestines and placenta (Figure 3A). The expression of Core1-β3GlcNAcT in HEV was demonstrated in a cell population enriched for MECA-79-positive HEV cells (Figure 3B). Using the same single-

(I) The same analysis of compound b produced peaks e and f. e, d, and c are derived from terminal galactose, 3-O-substituted, 6-O-substituted, and 3,6-di-O-substituted galactose, respectively.

stranded cDNA preparation, transcripts for LSST and Core2GlcNAcT-I were also strongly detected, while those for Core2GlcNAcT-II and -III were present in low quantities (Figure 3B).

In situ hybridization revealed that Core1-β3GlcNAcT transcripts colocalize with PNAd expression in HEV, and were also identified in lymphoid cells (Figures 3C and 3E). By contrast, no Core1-β3GlcNAcT transcripts were detected in MECA-79-negative endothelial cells (Figures 3G and 3I).

fection of CHO cells with Core2GlcNAcT-I and human LSST did not yield MECA-79 antigen (Hiraoka et al., 1999), indicating that core2 O-glycans are neither necessary nor sufficient for elaboration of MECA-79-reactive molecules.

In contrast, CHO cells transfected with Core1-β3GlcNAcT and human LSST expressed MECA-79 reactivity, whereas CHO cells transfected with either enzyme alone were negative for MECA-79 expression (Figure 4A). Human LSST and, to a lesser extent, mouse LSST were alone among the available cloned GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases in conferring MECA-79 reactivity when coexpressed with Core1-β3GlcNAcT. Other sulfotransferases including mouse and human GlcNAc6ST and human intestine GlcNAc6ST (Lee et al., 1999) did not confer MECA-79 reactivity when coexpressed with Core1-β3GlcNAcT.

To define the counterreceptor requirements for MECA-79 epitope display, Core1-β3GlcNAcT and human LSST were expressed in CHO cells together with soluble CD34, GlyCAM-1, MAdCAM-1, or NCAM chimeric proteins. Analysis of released soluble chimeric proteins.

Figure 5. Structures of Sulfated Oligosaccharides Isolated from CHO Cells Transfected with Core2GlcNAcT-I, Core1-β3GlcNAcT, or Both

CHO cells were stably transfected with vectors encoding Fuc-TVII, LSST, and CD34. Those transfected cells were further stably transfected with Core2GlcNAcT-I or Core1-β3GlcNAcT alone, or with both. To those CHO cells, GlyCAM-1•IgG was transiently expressed in the presence of $[^3H]$-galactose and $[^{35}S]$-sulfate. Structures of sulfated oligosaccharides in the released GlyCAM-1•IgG were determined and shown. 6-sulfo sLe$^x$ and sLe$^x$ are shown in orange and green, respectively. Neu, sialic acid.

is noteworthy that MAdCAM-1 expressed only a very small amount of MECA-79 antigen compared to CD34 or GlyCAM-1, indicating that MAdCAM-1 may not be a good acceptor for Core1-β3GlcNAcT.

To further confirm and refine the requirements for the MECA-79 reactivity, oligosaccharides derived from the extended core1 glycan were chemically synthesized. MECA-79 antibody binding was efficiently inhibited by a 6-sulfo extended core1 oligosaccharide, Galβ1→4(sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→octyl, and its sialylated or sialylated, fucosylated form, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4[Fucα1→3(sulfo→6)]GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→octyl (Figure 4C). The 6-sulfo group and core1 structure are absolutely required since neither nonsulfated, extended core1 oligosaccharide nor sulfated N-acetyllactosamine lacking core1 inhibited MECA-79 antibody binding (Figure 4C). The terminal galactose in the N-acetyllactosaminyl core1 is part of the epitope since its agalacto form needs more than a ten times concentration to achieve equivalent inhibition (Figure 4C). These results indicate that the minimum epitope of MECA-79 is the sulfated, extended core1 structure Galβ1→4(sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→R,

and that the sialylated and sialylated, fucosylated forms retain MECA-79 reactivity.

These results are consistent with previous studies showing that sialic acid and fucose are not integral parts of the MECA-79 epitope (Hemmerich et al., 1994; Maly et al., 1996). The results are also consistent with previous findings that the MECA-79 antibody can inhibit lymphocyte homing without prior removal of sialic acid or fucose (Streeter et al., 1988; Clark et al., 1998).

Core1-β3GlcNAcT Together with Core2GlcNAcT-I Confer the Synthesis of Twin 6-Sulfo sLe$^x$ in Biantennary O-Glycans Containing Both Core1 Extension and Core2 Branch

Structural analyses of GlyCAM-1•IgG-associated sulfated glycans were completed to define the chemical nature of the sulfated oligosaccharides directed by Core1-β3GlcNAcT and LSST. We established CHO cell lines stably transfected with CD34, fucosyltransferase-VII (FucT-VII), and LSST, plus Core1-β3GlcNAcT, Core2GlcNAcT-I, or both. Structures of $[^{35}S]$-sulfate- and $[^3H]$-galactose-labeled GlyCAM-1•IgG-derived glycans generated in CHO cells expressing Core2GlcNAcT were

determined as described previously (Hiraoka et al., 1999) and shown as structure 1 in Figure 5. Similar analysis of O-glycans from GlyCAM-1•IgG generated in CHO cells expressing Core1-β3GlcNAcT showed that the major O-glycans are monosialylated extended core1 containing 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup>, shown as structure 2 in Figure 5. As a minor component, poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl extended core1 oligosaccharides shown as structure 4 in Figure 5 are present. By contrast, HEV-derived GlyCAM-1 from Core2GlcNAcT-I<sup>A</sup> mice contains predominantly structure 2 in Figure 5 (see Figure 1).

Monosulfated O-glycans in GlyCAM-1 derived from Core1-β3GlcNAcT- and Core2GlcNAcT-I-transfected CHO cells (Q1 in Figure 6B) produced peaks 4 and 6 after Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration (Figure 6C). Sequential glycosidase treatment showed that peak 4 is a mixture of structure 1 and structure 2 in Figure 5 in a ratio of 25:1 (see also Experimental Procedures). Similar analysis showed that peak 6 (Figure 6C) was found to be a mixture of biantennary O-glycans having both core2 branch and core1 extension, structures 5 and 6 in Figure 5. Peak 6 also contained poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl oligosaccharides, structures 3 and 4 in Figure 5. Using a similar approach, disulfated oligosaccharides Q2 (Figure 6B) were found to be biantennary O-glycans containing twin 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> groups (structure 7 in Figure 5).

In parallel, HEV-derived [³H]-galactose-labeled GlyCAM-1 from wild-type mouse lymph node was subjected to carbohydrate structural analysis. Monosulfated oligosaccharides (Q1 in Figure 6E) yielded peaks 4 and 6 (Figure 6F). Sequential glycosidase digestion showed that peaks 4 and 6 contain almost all 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> in core 2 branch, shown as structures 1 and 5 in Figure 5, respectively. The majority of 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> in extended core1 is contained in biantennary O-glycans having twin 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> shown as structure 7 in Figure 5, which was recovered in Q2 (Figure 6E). These results indicate that HEV of wild-type mice contain 6-sulfo-sLe<sup>x</sup> on core2 branched O-glycans, and on biantennary O-glycans (structures 1, 5, and 7 in Figure 5).

**6-Sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> in Extended Core1 O-Glycans Function as L-Selectin Ligands**

To directly determine the role of Core1-β3GlcNAcT in L-selectin ligand functionality, rolling and tethering of lymphocytes was assayed on CHO cells expressing 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> in different backbones of O-glycans. CHO cells expressing 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> within extended core1 or core2 oligosaccharides consistently yielded lymphocyte adhesion in excess of the parent cell line lacking these oligosaccharides (Figure 7A). CHO cells expressing both Core2GlcNAcT-I and Core1-β3GlcNAcT yielded signifi-

(A) CHO cells stably expressing CD34, LSST, and Fuc-TVII (open square) were further stably transfected with Core1-β3GlcNAcT (open circle), Core2GlcNAcT-I (filled diamond), or both Core1-β3GlcNAcT and Core2GlcNAcT-I (filled triangle), grown on polystyrene dishes, and used as the bottom plate of a parallel flow chamber. The number of tethering and rolling lymphocytes at different shear forces is shown. Four independent experiments produced almost identical results, and one representative experiment is shown.

(B and C) Lymphocyte rolling was measured on plates coated with GlyCAM-1 preparations from wild-type (wild-type) and Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ (C2GlcNAcTΔ) mice, providing equivalent rolling in the different plates at the shear stress of 2.5 dynes/cm². These plates were treated with different concentrations of MECA-79 antibody and then assayed for lymphocyte adhesion. Two independent experiments produced almost identical results and one representative experiment is shown.

significantly greater lymphocyte adhesion than 6-sulfo sLex expressed in either extended core1 oligosaccharides or core2 branched oligosaccharides alone (Figure 7A). These results indicate that Core1-β3GlcNAcT contributes to the synthesis of L-selectin ligands, and infer that biantennary oligosaccharides containing both extended core1 and core2 branches can, under some circumstances, operationally synergize to promote optimal L-selectin ligand activity.

To determine the contribution of extended core1 O-glycans to L-selectin counterreceptor activity, we isolated GlyCAM-1 from the serum of Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ and wild-type mice, and used it as an adhesion substrate in parallel plate flow chamber assays. In experiments where the amounts of wild-type and Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ GlyCAM-1 were adjusted to yield equivalent lymphocyte adhesion under shear, we found that adhesion on Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ GlyCAM-1 was more susceptible to inhibition by MECA-79 antibody, relative to wild-type GlyCAM-1, throughout a range of MECA-79 antibody concentrations. At the highest antibody concentrations used (2 and 4 μg/ml), a significant fraction of lymphocytes continue to adhere to wild-type GlyCAM-1,

whereas virtually all adhesion to Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ GlyCAM-1 is inhibited (Figures 7B and 7C). These results indicate that MECA-79-reactive 6-sulfo extended core1 structures account for almost all of the L-selectin ligands in the Core2GlcNAcT-IΔ mouse, and a large portion of the L-selectin ligands in the wild-type mouse.

Discussion

Structures of oligosaccharide ligands that are elaborated by HEV have remained elusive despite the cloning and analysis of numerous putative L-selectin counterreceptors. Ablation of counterreceptors such as GlyCAM-1 and CD34 has not been useful in defining these oligosaccharides due to the number of highly glycosylated HEV proteins which carry the same functional oligosaccharides (Suzuki et al., 1996; Kansas, 1996). To address this problem, we have defined the structures of the HEV-derived oligosaccharides isolated from wild-type mice, and from mice that sustain a deletion of Core2GlcNAcT-I, a key glycosyltransferase implicated in L-selectin ligand formation (Ellies et al., 1998). Although lymphocyte homing is largely retained in Core2GlcNAcT-I-deficient mice,

Figure 8. Structure and Biosynthesis of L-selectin Ligand Oligosaccharides  

Core1 O-glycans can be extended by Core1-β3GlcNAcT and then sulfated by LSST. The resultant oligosaccharide can be galactosylated to form the minimum epitope for MECA-79 antibody. The galactosylated oligosaccharide is further sialylated and fucosylated to form 6-sulfo sLeˣ in the extended core1, which is also MECA-79 positive (right). Core1 oligosaccharides can be converted to core2 O-glycans by Core2GlcNAcT. Core2 oligosaccharides may be sulfated by LSST, galactosylated and sialylated, and fucosylated to form 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x in core2 O-glycans (second from right). Core1 sialylation is mostly carried out by ST3Gal-I (Priatel et al., 2000). Core2GlcNAcT does not act on extended core 1 structures, but Core1-β3GlcNAcT can act on core2 branched O-glycans, leading to biantennary O-glycans containing both core2 branch and core1 extension (left half). All of these processed O-glycans function as L-selectin ligands. β4Gal-T, β1,4-galactosyltransferase; ST3Gal, α2,3-sialyltransferase; Fuc-TVII, fucosyltransferase VII.

analysis of the remaining oligosaccharide structures has allowed us to define sulfated extended core1 mucin-type O-glycans as the novel L-selectin ligand required for lymphocyte homing in the absence of core2 structures.

It has been demonstrated that sulfo sLeˣ formed on core2 branched O-glycans contributes to L-selectin ligands in HEV (Figure 8, second from right; Hiraoka et al., 1999). In the present study, we have revealed a biosynthetic pathway that leads to the formation of 6-sulfo sLeˣ in O-glycans through the extension and modification of the core1 structure Galβ1→3GlcNAc (Figure 8, far right and left half). The molecular cloning studies reported here identify Core1-β3GlcNAcT as an extension enzyme that together with LSST directs expression of MECA-79 antigen. Sequential addition of α2,3-linked sialic acid and α1,3-linked fucose to the MECA-79 minimum epitope leads to the formation of 6-sulfo sLeˣ in extended core1 structures, providing L-selectin ligand functionality. In contrast, none of the other four β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases cloned to date (Sasaki et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 1999; the present study) conferred MECA-79 antigen expression (data not shown).

Although Core2GlcNAcT-II and Core2GlcNAcT-III were suggested to compensate for the loss of Core2GlcNAcT-I, only small amounts of Core2GlcNAcT-II and Core2GlcNAcT-III transcripts and virtually no sulfated core2
pressed (Stein et al., 1999). These considerations suggest the possibility that the bivalent nature of biantenary O-glycans doubly substituted with twin 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> or 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> and sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties may contribute to more effective engagement with clustered L-selectin molecules, and thereby yield optimal shear-dependent lymphocyte adhesion.

Among different L-selectin counterreceptors, MAdCAM-1 primarily plays a role in lymphocyte homing to Peyer’s patches (Butcher and Picker, 1996). Our results demonstrate that MAdCAM-1 acquires MECA-79 antigen inefficiently compared with CD34 or GlyCAM-1, and are consistent with previous reports that only a fraction of MAdCAM-1 molecules are decorated with the MECA-79 antigen (Berg et al., 1993). Sulfation of MAdCAM-1 in core2 branched O-glycans is, however, only slightly less efficient than sulfation of other counterreceptors (Hiraoka et al., 1999). These results suggest that L-selectin binding to MAdCAM-1 in Peyer’s patches is not as strong as L-selectin binding to lymph node counterreceptors such as CD34 due to insufficient amounts of extended core1-based 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup>. These results are consistent with the observations that MECA-79 only weakly stains HEV in Peyer’s patches, and that L-selectin plays a minor role in Peyer’s patches with both L-selectin- and α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin-mediated adhesion being necessary for lymphocyte tethering and rolling (Bargatze et al., 1995).

Expression of Core1-β3GlcNAcT transcripts was observed in cells that express MECA-79 antigen, but they were also detected in cells negative for MECA-79 and mucin-producing tissues. Core1-β3GlcNAcT may also be involved in the synthesis of core1 extended structures found in human colonic mucins (Capon et al., 1997). MECA-79 antigen and L-selectin ligands are induced on microvascular endothelium in chronic inflammatory states, insulitis in the nonobese diabetic mice and rejection of the heart transplants (reviewed in Rosen, 1999). LSST and Fuc-TVII transcripts are also induced in MECA-79-positive HEV-like microvasculature in the thymic hyperplasia of the AKR mouse (Hiraoka et al., 1999). These observations suggest that the HEV phenotype is associated with coordinated regulation of a series of enzymes that confer L-selectin counterreceptor activity. Among these enzymes responsible for L-selectin ligand synthesis, the expression of LSST is most restricted to HEV, thereby restricting L-selectin ligand expression in HEV.

In conclusion, our observations demonstrate that a Galβ1→4(sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→R is a backbone structure for PNAd that is detected by MECA-79. A newly cloned Core1-β3GlcNAcT together with LSST and Fuc-TVII confers the expression of L-selectin ligand on extended core1 oligosaccharides. Moreover, the synthesis of biantennary oligosaccharides containing both core2 branches and core1 extensions exhibits a synergistic effect on L-selectin-dependent cell adhesion activity. These observations and the expression of Core1-β3GlcNAcT in HEV indicate that Core1-β3GlcNAcT together with Core2GlcNAcT-I and LSST provide a primary contribution to the synthesis of HEV-borne L-selectin ligands and the homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs.

Experimental Procedures

Isolation of cDNA Encoding Core1-β3GlcNAcT

A Blast search of the dbEST identified three query genes (#AB015630, #AA13340, and #W26453) homologous to the coding region of β3GlcNAcT (Zhou et al., 1999). Using 5′-RACE, a 1.2 kb fragment containing the full-length coding sequence for EST AB015630 was isolated from single-stranded cDNA from HT29 human colon carcinoma cells and then cloned into pcDNA3, forming pcDNA3-Core1-β3GlcNAcT. Similarly, full-length coding cDNA sequences for AA13340 and W26453 were cloned into pcDNA3.

In Vitro Assay of β3GlcNAcT Activity

Using PCR primers matching the full-length sequence, a cDNA fragment encoding the soluble catalytic domain of novel enzymes was cloned into pcDNA3.1/HSN, encoding a signal peptide followed by a 6 His tag (Angata et al., 2001). Each vector harboring a novel cDNA was transfected into CHO cells and the soluble enzyme released into the medium was assayed using UDP-[<sup>3</sup>H]GlcNAc and various synthetic receptors as described previously (Yeh et al., 1999). βGalT activity was also assayed using UDP-[<sup>3</sup>H]Gal and GalNAcα1→p-nitrophenol or GlcNAcβ1→p-nitrophenol as an acceptor. Core2-GlcNAcT activity was assayed as described previously (Bierhuizen and Fukuda, 1992).

Isolation of cDNA Encoding Human LSST

A cDNA encoding a portion of human LSST was obtained by PCR using human genomic DNA and primers based on the nucleotide sequence of mouse LSST (Hiraoka et al., 1999). Using the PCR procedure, a full-length genomic sequence was obtained by screening a P1 human genomic phage library (Genome Systems). Based on the genomic sequence, cDNA sequence was obtained by RT-PCR using human lymph node poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA and cloned into pcDNA1.1, resulting in pcDNA1.1-human LSST. The nucleotide sequence was identical to that reported by Bistrup et al. (1999).

Synthesis of Core1-β3GlcNAcT and Other Glycosyltransferase cDNAs from MECA-79-Positive Cells

MECA-79-positive, high endothelial cells were isolated from human tonsil using the MECA-79 antibody as described (Girard and Springer, 1995). Total RNA (120 ng) isolated from MECA-79-positive and -negative stromal cells was reverse transcribed and used for PCR templates as described previously (Hiraoka et al., 1999). Oligonucleotide primer pairs were used for specific amplification of human LSST (nucleotides 407–426 and 754–733), Core1-β3GlcNAcT (nucleotides 628–654 and 1134–1104), Core2GlcNAcT-I (nucleotides 139–166 and 570–542), Core2GlcNAcT-II (nucleotides 331–357 and 577–550), Core2GlcNAcT-III (nucleotides 288–314 and 840–814), and GlcNAc6ST (nucleotides 1333–1355 and 1863–1842).

In Situ Hybridization

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical procedures were completed on human palatine tonsil as previously described (Hiraoka et al., 1999). Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were prepared by in vitro transcription from plasmid containing a segment of human Core1-β3GlcNAcT (nucleotides 704–854).

Metabolic Labeling of Murine Lymph Nodes and Isolation of MECA-79-Positive Glycoproteins

Murine axillary, brachial, cervical, and mesenteric lymph nodes from wild-type and Core2GlcNAcT-I<sup>Δ</sup> mice were labeled in organ culture in Glc-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 0.5 mCi/ml [<sup>3</sup>H]-galactose. The conditioned medium was applied to MECA-79 antibody conjugated to UltraLink™ Biosupport Medium (Pierce) and eluted as described previously (Hemmerich et al., 1994). Similarly, metabolically labeled cell pellets were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and subjected to MECA-79 antibody column chromatography.

Transient Transfection and MECA-79 Antigen Expression

cDNAs encoding IgG chimera of CD34, GlyCAM-1, MAdCAM-1, or NCAM were constructed and transiently cotransfected with human
LSST and Core1-β3GlcNAcT cDNAs to CHO cells as described previously (Hiraoka et al., 1999). Released, purified chimeric proteins were subjected to Western analysis with MECA-79 antibody as described before (Berg et al., 1993).

### Transfection and Metabolic Cell Labeling

CHO cells were stably transfected with CD34, Fuc-TVII, and human LSST. Cells expressing sialyl Lewis x and CD34 were selected after immunostaining. Cells expressing LSST were then sorted for MECA-79-positive staining when they were transiently transfected with Core1-β3GlcNAcT. These cells were further stably transfected with Core1-β3GlcNAcT or Core2GlcNAcT-I alone or with both. Those cells expressing Core1-β3GlcNAcT and Core2GlcNAcT-I were isolated by cell sorter after staining with MECA-79 and NCC-ST-439 antibodies, respectively. NCC-ST-439 reacts with sLe<sup>x</sup> in core2 oligosaccharides (Kumamoto et al., 1998). These transfected cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-GlyCAM•IgG and metabolically labeled with <sup>[3]H</sup>-galactose or <sup>[35]S</sup>-sulfate as described previously (Hiraoka et al., 1999).

### Inhibition of MECA-79 Antibody Binding by Synthetic Oligosaccharides

Galβ1→4(sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→octyl was chemically synthesized with a slight modification of the procedure previously described (Misra et al., 2000; Ujita et al., 2000). This oligosaccharide was further sialylated and fucosylated using α2,3-sialyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase V (both from Calbiochem). Synthetic details will be published elsewhere. 6′-Sulfo *N*-acetyllactosamine and 6-sulfo *N*-acetyllactosamine with or without sialic acid were synthesized as described previously (Misra et al., 2000).

Synthetic oligosaccharides at different concentrations were incubated with MECA-79 anibody (final dilution 1:1 × 10<sup>5</sup>) at room temperature for 1 hr, and then added to the wells precoated with media from MECA-79-positive CHO cells expressing CD34•IgG. Bound MECA-79 antibody was measured using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat IgM. Assays were duplicated and repeated twice.

### Structural Analysis of Oligosaccharides Attached to GlyCAM-1 and GlyCAM-1•IgG

Isolation of O-glycans derived from <sup>[3]H</sup>-galactose- and/or <sup>[35]S</sup>-sulfate-labeled glycoproteins was carried out as described previously (Hiraoka et al., 1999). Isolated O-glycans were sequentially digested with α2,3-specific sialidase, α1,3/4-fucosidase, β1,4-specific galactosidase, and β-hexosaminidase A as described before (Hiraoka et al., 1999). When β-hexosaminidase B was employed instead of β-hexosaminidase A, sulfo→6GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAc and sulfo→6GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAc were produced from 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup>-containing extended core1 and core2 branched O-glycans, respectively, and can be separated by SAX-10 HPLC under the conditions described before (Hiraoka et al., 2000). For example, peak 4 in Figure 6C yielded the above oligosaccharides in a ratio of 1:25 upon this treatment, indicating peak 4 was originally a mixture of structure 1 and structure 2 in a ratio of 25:1. Sialic acid and sulfate were removed from a portion of isolated O-glycans (Hiraoka et al., 1999) and resultant oligosaccharides were subjected to HPLC (Bierhuizen and Fukuda, 1992) after sequential glycosidase digestion. Methylation analysis was performed as described before (Lee et al., 1990).

### Measurement of L-Selectin-Mediated Rolling on GlyCAM-1 Samples From Wild-Type or Core2GlcNAcT-I<sup>A</sup> Mice and on MECA-79-Positive CHO Cells

CHO cells stably expressing CD34, Fuc-TVII, human LSST, and Core1-β3GlcNAcT, or Core2GlcNAcT-I alone, or both were established as described above. These cells maintained similar amounts of CD34 and 6-sulfo sLe<sup>x</sup> as assessed by FACS analysis and HECA-452 staining (Duijvestijn et al., 1988). These stably transfected cells seeded on dishes were used as the bottom plate of a parallel flow chamber as described previously (Clark et al., 1998).

GlyCAM-1 was prepared from serum of wild-type and Core2GlcNAcT-I<sup>A</sup> mice and captured on polystyrene plates, which had been coated with anti-GlyCAM-1 antibodies, CAM02 (Bruehl et al., 2000). The amount of GlyCAM-1 from wild-type or Core2GlcNAcT-I<sup>A</sup> mice was adjusted to provide equivalent lymphocyte adhesion. Once we obtained these two plates, they were divided and treated with different concentrations of MECA-79 antibody before rolling assays.

Lymphocytes were initially introduced into the flow chamber at a wall shear stress of 5 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> for 15 s, followed by the termination of flow to allow the cells to adhere under static conditions. Flow rate was then reinitiated at the shear forces indicated in Figure 7. Image analysis was performed and analyzed as described (Ellies et al., 1998).
