### Abstract

The development of basal cell carcinoma, the commonest human cancer in fair skinned populations, is clearly associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Insight into the genesis of BCC came from the identification of germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene, PATCHED, a key regulatory component of hedgehog signaling in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Analysis of sporadic basal cell carcinomas and those from repair deficient xeroderma pigmentosum patients has revealed mutational inactivation of PATCHED and gain of function mutations of the proto-oncogenes, SMOOTHENED and SONIC HEDGEHOG associated with solar UV exposure. The molecular mechanisms involved in alterations of the hedgehog signaling pathway that lead to the formation of basal cell carcinomas are being unraveled and has already allowed the investigation of future therapeutic strategies for treating these skin cancers.

### 1. Introduction

The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, is critical in governing embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Originally identified by genetic analysis of embryonic mutants of the fruit fly

*Abbreviations*: BCC, basal cell carcinoma; SHH, sonic hedgehog; PTCH, patched; SMO, smoothened; HIP, hedgehog interacting protein; NBCC, nevoid basal cell carcinoma; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; UV, ultraviolet.

*Drosophila melanogaster*, the hedgehog protein (hh) is found to play an essential role in the signaling pathway involved in cell type specification, patterning and the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in nearly all tissue types during development [1]. HH signaling is more complex in vertebrates than in *drosophila* and three hedgehog homologue proteins have been identified in mammals: Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Desert hedgehog (Dhh) [2]. Amongst these, Shh is the most potent [3] and most often expressed in embryonic and adult tissues [4,5]. Mutations in the key components of the SHH signaling pathway can result in severe congenital

malformation resulting in phenotypes such as holoprosencephaly and the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCC) [6–8]. Modifications of SHH signaling can also lead to tumor development in tissues of different origin, predominantly basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) in skin, medulloblastomas and gliomas in brain and rhabdomyosarcomas in muscle [4,5,9,10]. Recent reports indicate that upregulation of the SHH pathway is also involved in digestive tract, pancreatic and small-cell lung cancers [11–13]. This review highlights our knowledge of the involvement of the SHH signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of basal cell carcinoma, the most common malignancy in the white population today. Much of our understanding of the mechanisms of SHH signal transduction which are implicated both in development and disease has been clarified by the study of animal models and analysis of human tumors, including BCCs.

representing 40-60% of BCCs, the superficial type comprising 15–30% and 1–2% being the pigmented BCC. Sporadic BCCs are rarely found before the age of 20 years but thereafter the risk of developing BCCs increases with age. A predisposition to skin cancer is associated with different genetic disorders including albinism, Bazex’s syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum and the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCC) also known as the Gorlin syndrome.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare recessive autosomal DNA repair defective disorder and is associated with an acute photosensitivity manifested by sunlight induced abnormal pigmentation, a dry prematurely aged skin and a precocious development of cutaneous lesions. The heterogeneous XP phenotype can be a result of defects in any one of the seven classic nucleotide excision repair genes XPA to G, and about 20% of XP patients, the variant XPV group, are proficient in NER but defective in translesion synthesis [15–17]. The most significant characteristic of XP patients is their predisposition to develop multiple skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), melanomas and BCCs, which arise on sun exposed skin at a very early age [16]. Molecular analysis shows that higher levels of modifications in key genes including oncogenes [18–20] and tumor suppressor genes [21–23] are found in XP tumors compared to sporadic skin cancers and this has made a valuable contribution to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in skin carcinogenesis.

Importantly, our present knowledge of the molecular basis of basal cell carcinogenesis has come from the analysis of the NBCC syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by a range of developmental anomalies, and predisposition to various cancers [8]. These include skeletal abnormalities, odontogenic keratocysts, ectopic calcification, facial dysmorphisms, macrocephaly, hyperkeratosis of the palm and soles, basal cell nevi and tumors such as ovarian fibromas, medulloblastomas, neuroectodermal tumors and significantly the development of numerous BCCs. In fact, BCCs are reported in 90% of NBCC patients at some stage and sun exposure is again a major risk factor [24]. The human homologue of the *Drosophila patched* gene, PTCH, a tumor suppressor gene, was identified as the gene responsible for NBCC, and is found located on

2. Basal cell carcinomas

Cancer of the skin is the most common cancer in Caucasians and basal cell carcinomas (BCC) account for 90% of all skin cancers. Its incidence is increasing and shows marked geographical variations as highlighted by the elevated levels of skin cancers observed in the white-skinned Australian population submitted to high levels of solar UV exposure. Indeed, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation has been identified as the most important environmental risk factor because unrepaired UV-induced DNA lesions can result in mutations which can initiate and promote skin cancer development. The skin type is also an important consideration as very fair-skinned individuals (skin type I) with red or blonde hair and light-colored eyes are at high risk of developing BCCs, a risk which increases with childhood freckling and severe sunburn. Other risk factors include diet, environmental exposure to ionizing irradiation and chemicals such as arsenic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and UVA-psoralen or immunosuppression therapies [14]. The majority of BCCs occur on the head and neck, are slow-growing and rarely metastasize. They are derived from the keratinocytes of the basal stem cell layer of the epidermis. Different histological subtypes exist, the nodular ulcerative BCC being the most common
chromosome 9q22-31 [25,26]. NBCC patients present germline inactivating mutations of PTCH [27,28] and frequent loss of heterozygosity at 9q22 is observed in the other tumor types found in NBCC patients [29–31]. It is important to note that multiple BCCs occur very early in NBCC patients suggesting *PTCH* gene mutations are an early event in BCC formation. Following these findings from the analysis of the NBBC syndrome, the identification of inactivating mutations of *PTCH* in sporadic BCCs confirmed the implication of aberrant SHH signaling in their development in which many of the different partners of the pathway are involved [32].

### 3. SHH signaling

The hedgehog family of secreted proteins are subjected to different autoprocessing, post-translational modifications in order to be fully activated (Fig. 1). The SHH protein is synthesized as a 45kD precursor protein which undergoes maturation by intramolecular cleavage catalyzed by the C-terminal portion of the precursor generating a 19 kD N-terminal signal peptide and a 25 kD C-terminal fragment which diffuses away as it seems to have no other function [33,34]. The autocleavage process occurs via a thioester intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic attack by a cholesterol moiety. This results in a covalently coupled cholesterol moiety at the C terminus of the N-terminal signal peptide (SHH-N). The hydrophobicity of the signal peptide due to the cholesterol moiety is further increased by lipid modification, a palmitoylation of the highly conserved N-terminal cysteine residue which is dependent on the cholesterol addition [35]. The SHH-N signal peptide remains tethered to the plasma membrane of the producing cell and transport of SHH to the responding cells can occur through different mechanisms. Zeng et al. [36] showed that the SHH signal peptide multimerises at lipid rafts with the lipid adducts sequestered at the centers, rendering it soluble and able to diffuse for long range signaling. In *Drosophila*, a 12-pass transmembrane protein, dispatched (disp) with sequence similarity to patched, functions to release cholesterol modified hedgehog from its tether via its sterol sensing domain [37]. It is speculated that human DISP may play a role either in targeting SHH to lipid rafts or in SHH multimer formation, although the precise mechanisms are not known. Extracellular transport of SHH by diffusion is thought to be regulated by its interaction with heparin sulphate proteoglycans which may also allow presentation of SHH to receptors on target cells [38]. Other proteins involved in regulating SHH signaling have been identified and include the membrane bound glycoprotein, Hedgehog interacting protein (Hip). Discovered in the mouse, Hip binds all three Hedgehog proteins and is induced in responding cells acting as an attenuator of the Shh response [39]. Hip has a binding affinity for Shh comparable to that of Ptch, suggesting the existence of an additional negative feedback mechanism for regulating responses to SHH signaling.

PATCHED (PTCH), a 12-pass transmembrane protein, is the principle receptor of SHH and plays a key role as a negative regulator of SHH signaling. A second protein, PTCH2 has been found in vertebrates and shows 54% homology to PTCH, the amino and carboxy-terminal regions being different. The PTCH proteins are differently expressed during

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 1. Maturation of the SHH protein. The 45 kD precursor SHH protein undergoes catalytic autocleavage via its C-terminal domain resulting in the addition of a cholesterol moiety at the C-terminal of the 19 kD N-terminal peptide which is generated (SHH-N) and the 25 kD C-terminal peptide diffuses away. The SHH-N is further modified at its N-terminal cysteine which undergoes palmitoylation resulting in a hydrophobic protein which remains bound to the cell membrane through the cholesterol moiety.

development and thought to have different functions [40,41]. The PTCH protein is expressed in the cell membrane of target tissues where, in the absence of its ligand SHH, its function is the constitutive repression of smoothened (SMO), transducer of the SHH signal (Fig. 2A). There is some evidence showing that PTCH regulates SMO catalytically and it is proposed that transport of small endogenous molecules across the lipid layer may modulate SMO activity [42]. Many factors are involved in the multi-molecular network which allows transduction of the SHH signal which drives proliferation and differentiation through the activation of the GLI protein family. It is important to note that the three human GLI proteins, specific downstream effectors of the SHH signaling pathway, are multifunctional zinc finger transcription factors. The dominant negative activity is coded by the N-terminal domain while the activating domain of the GLI proteins are found at the C-terminal which also contains the cytoplasmic retention sequence. GLI1 behaves primarily as a transcription activator, GLI2 and GLI3 have both activator and a repressor functions [4,43,44]. GLI2 and GLI3 are retained in a complex with other signaling components which include a microtubule-associated kinesin-like protein,

the serine threonine kinase fused (FU), and the Suppressor of fused (SUFU). FU is expected to be a positive regulator and SUFU a negative regulator of the GLI proteins. Moreover, SUFU is also thought to be important for the shuttling of the GLI proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus [45]. The cytoplasmic sequestration of the GLI proteins in the complex, which represses transcription, is regulated by phosphorylation and proteolysis [46].

Stoichiometric binding of the SHH ligand to PTCH relieves its inhibition of SMO, which in turn triggers the release of the GLI transcription factors from the protein complex by unknown mechanisms (Fig. 2B). The genes targeted by SHH have been identified to include GLI1, PTCH2, the WNT family and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belonging to the TGFβ superfamily. Downstream transcriptional activation of PTCH and HIP indicate negative feedback mechanisms exist for regulating responses to SHH signaling. SHH signaling can show tissue specificity as seen when GLI1 is expressed in primary keratinocytes where a significant increase in the transcriptional activity of the forkhead box protein FOXM1, is found [47]. When GLI1 is expressed in the mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells, it induces the expression of

(B) Binding of the ligand SHH to PTCH, relieves its inhibition of SMO and transcriptional activation occurs through the GLI family of proteins resulting in activation of target genes.

the platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFRα involved in the regulation of cell proliferation through the ras–ERK pathway [48]. The winged helix domain transcription factor FOXE1 has recently been found to be a transcriptional target of GLI2 and is specifically expressed in basal keratinocytes of the epidermis [49]. Finally, the involvement of SHH signaling in proliferation has been elucidated from in vitro and in vivo studies that have clearly implicated both SHH and PTCH in promoting the proliferation of human epithelial cells by direct interaction with cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin B1 [50,51].

## 4. Activation of the SHH signaling pathway in BCC

It is clear that constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway can lead to the development of BCCs (Fig. 3). Several studies have shown consistent overexpression of PTCH in BCCs [52–57]. This clearly indicates that deregulation of the SHH pathway by mutation or altered activity of one or more of the members must be occurring in all BCCs.

should be noted that the 34 kb human *PTCH* gene expresses three alternative transcripts differing at the 5′ end in the first exon, (exon 1, 1A and 1B) suggesting the existence of other promoters and alternative regulatory mechanisms. So far, only exon 1B transcripts definitely code for protein which is able to fully inhibit SMO activity [58]. At present, it has not been defined which *PTCH* transcript is over-expressed in BCCs. The homologue of *PTCH*, *PTCH2* which maps at 1p32–p34, is found co-expressed with SHH in epithelium but its function remains unclear. The *PTCH2*, splice variants lack the ability to inhibit SMO activity but seem to have the capacity to modulate localization of SMO [59]. SMO has also been found to be upregulated in BCCs [53,55,56] but in the study by Reifenberger et al. no expression of *SHH* mRNA was detected in a large number of BCCs analyzed [55].

Among the three human GLI proteins, it was initially found that *GLI1* was an oncogene as it can cooperate with the adenovirus E1A protein to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts and was also identified as an amplified gene in human

Sporadic and XP BCCs present mutations of *PTCH* as well as the proto-oncogenes *SHH* and *SMO*. Overexpression of downstream target genes is also implicated in BCC development.

glioblastoma [60,61]. GLI1 is also found frequently overexpressed in BCCs where it is located principally in the cytoplasm [52–57]. Early evidence of the importance of Gli1 in tumor formation was revealed by the finding that transient mis-expression of Gli1 in the tadpole skin induced BCC like tumors [9]. Upregulation of GLI2 α/β isoforms in human BCCs has also been reported [54,62]. The study by Regl's group shows that GLI1 can induce the two GLI2 α/β isoforms forms which they find overexpressed and provide evidence for a positive feedback mechanism between GLI1 and GLI2 in BCC development [54]. Furthermore the latest study by this group provides evidence that GLI2 plays a dual role as activator of keratinocyte proliferation and repressor of epidermal differentiation [63]. It is postulated that the hyperactivation of GLI2 by aberrant SHH signaling would then disrupt epidermal homeostasis and lead to neoplasia. The importance of GLI2 in BCC is further consolidated by Ikram et al. [64] who show by in situ hybridization that as well as being expressed in BCC tumor islands, Gli2 is expressed in the interfollicular epidermis and the outer root sheath of hair follicles in normal skin. Indeed, SHH regulates hair follicle growth and morphogenesis and when inappropriately activated causes hair follicle derived tumors, the most clinically significant being the BCC [65]. To date, there is no evidence that expression of GLI3 is altered in BCCs compared to normal skin [66]. The GLI transcription factors are found to induce the constitutive activation of several downstream targets in BCCs, including PDGFRα, implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation [48]. Among the members of the Winged-helix/FOX proteins, a large family of transcription factors implicated in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, longevity and transformation, FOXM1, a downstream target of GLI1 [47] and FOXE1 via GLI2 activation, are upregulated in BCCs [49]. Recently, it was found that GLI could upregulate basonuclin, a novel rRNA gene transcription factor, in BCCs which is consistent with the higher demand for protein synthesis in tumor cells [67]. Finally, the SHH binding protein, a potential regulator of SHH signaling, HIP, is found to be overexpressed in BCCs [68].

5. Sonic hedgehog pathway gene alterations in BCCs

### 5.1. Sonic hedgehog

Alterations of *SHH*, a postulated proto-oncogene are extremely rare in sporadic BCCs and only one potential gain of function mutation (H133Y) has been reported among 74 sporadic BCCs analyzed to date (Fig. 3) [55,69]. A later study, looking only for codon 133 alterations, found no modifications in 36 sporadic BCCs analyzed [70]. It is only from the recent study of XP BCCs that a role for SHH in human skin tumorigenesis has been firmly established by the finding of six novel SHH gene mutations in 33 tumors analyzed [20]. All of the six XP SHH mutations characterized are UV-specific C→T transitions or CC→TT tandem substitutions, located at bipyrimidine sites which are hot spots for UV induced lesions. The most remarkable alterations specific to skin cancers are the frequent tandem CC→TT transitions considered to be the hallmark UV signature and rarely found in internal tumors.

Four alterations are missense mutations (12%) in exons 1 and 2, in highly conserved codons, 57 and 64 in exon 1, and 147 and 155 in exon 2 at the N-terminal domain of the SHH protein. One silent mutation was found in exon 3 and a base substitution was detected in intron 1 near the junction to exon 1. The unique SHH alteration, H133Y, detected in 1 of 43 sporadic BCCs by Oro et al., is a C→T transition located at a bipyrimidine sequence but is probably not a hot spot for UV-induced lesions in the SHH gene as it was not found in the XP BCCs but was found in the Oro study, in two internal cancers, a medulloblastoma and a breast carcinoma [69]. Germline mutations of the SHH gene are the cause of the Holprosencephaly (HPE) syndrome which present forebrain malformation associated with mental retardation and craniofacial anomalies indicating the importance of SHH signaling in human development. It should be noted that none of the SHH mutations found in BCCs are identified in HPE where a variety of alterations are found including frameshift, nonsense and missense mutations [6,7,71,72].

All the SHH mutations identified are located in the N-terminal domain of SHH known to retain the signaling activities of the protein, whereas

the C-terminal domain is responsible for the intramolecular precursor processing [33,34]. Structural modeling studies of the 4 XP SHH proteins altered at the surface residues, G57S, G64K, D147N and R155C as well as the sporadic BCC alteration H133Y showed that they do not significantly affect the protein conformation. Interestingly, they are all located on one face of the compact SHH protein suggesting they may have altered affinity for different partners such as HIP [39] which may be important in modulating different functions.

### 5.1.1. Patched

Analysis of NBCC patients has revealed that the majority of the germline PTCH mutations are rearrangements which result in truncated proteins (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in sporadic BCCs, only 30% of rearrangements are found, the remaining modifications being point mutations [73]. Nevertheless, the majority of these alterations are also predicted to result in premature protein termination. PTCH gene mutations are frequent in sporadic BCCs (12–38%) and the mutation spectrum indicate a major role for solar irradiation in the tumor development, as 50% of mutations are the UV specific C to T or CC to TT transitions [74–77]. The analysis of BCCs from the DNA repair deficient XP patients, reveal between 80–90% of PTCH gene mutations [22,78], of which nearly 80% are UV specific [22]. A high proportion (42%) of these XP patched gene alterations are also predicted to produce a truncated protein caused by a premature stop codon. For both XP and sporadic BCCs, the localization of patched gene mutations on the different domains of the protein is not significantly different but germline mutations are seen more often in the N-terminal half of the protein. The majority of the point mutations are distributed at random in both the extracellular and intracellular domains of PTCH. Many PTCH mutations, both germinal and in BCCS are found to affect the large extra-cellular loops which may be important for interaction with the SHH ligand. PTCH modifications in the large intracellular loop and C-terminal tail may be important in altering unidentified patched functions [79]. SHH pathway activation seems to be an early event in BCC formation as PTCH mutations [29] and loss of heterozygosity at 9q22.3 [80] are also detected

in benign skin lesions associated with BCCs, the trichoepitheliomas. These results also suggest that hair follicle keratinocytes are the common precursor cells for their development. To date, only one truncating mutation in a medulloblastoma and a change in a splice donor site in a basal cell carcinoma have been reported for PTCH2 [41].

#### 5.2. Smoothened

Smoothened which maps to 7q31–q32 encodes a seven-pass transmembrane protein structurally similar to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is the transducer of intracellular SHH signaling. SHH binding to PTCH alleviates SMO repression, by mechanisms which have not been firmly established as yet, allowing downstream signaling. Its importance in the development of BCCs was established when different studies detected SMO mutations in sporadic BCCs (Fig. 3). The study by Xie et al. found three SMO mutations in 47 BCCs (6%) analysed [81] and Reifenberger’s group found four of 31 BCCs (13%) carrying SMO mutations [55] and a hotspot for mutation at codon 535 was identified from the data of two laboratories. The study of BCCs from an Asian population analyzing for the hotspot codon 535, found 20 SMO mutations in 97 BCCs (20.6%) [82].

In a study of 30 BCCs from XP patients, a significantly higher level (30%) of the SMO gene alterations were characterized, consisting of one silent and seven missense mutations [19]. As found for the patched and SHH genes, the majority (89%) of SMO mutations in XP BCCs are UV specific compared to only 30% in sporadic BCCs and 69% are the tandem CC → TT transitions which are not found in sporadic BCCs [19,55,81]. The SMO hotspot mutation found in sporadic BCCs, a G to T transversion was also found in the XP BCCs. It should be noted that the G to T transversion can arise from replication of DNA containing 8-oxoguanine, a base modification that is often produced by UVA induced reactive oxygen species and arsenic compounds. It results in the alteration of the highly conserved tryptophan residue to leucine at codon 535, and is located in the seventh transmembrane domain of the SMO protein. Interestingly, arsenic is a well known food contaminant in Asia and this could explain the high frequency of the codon 535 G to T mutation observed in the study of

BCCs from an Asian population by Lam et al. [82]. This mutation may alter the latent state of the SMO receptor protein and result in constitutive SHH signaling. Interestingly, the majority of the SMO mutations characterized in BCCs are located in the extra-membrane domains of the smoothened protein; two mutations at the N-terminal and two located in the large extra-cellular loop may bind small SMO modulating molecules. The mutations in the intra-cellular domain are found in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail and intracellular loop of the SMO, which are critical domains of GPCRs, for interaction with G proteins, a step essential in signal transduction. Moreover, mutations of more than one of the key partners of the SHH pathway can be found modified in the same BCC; PTCH with SMO, SMO with SHH and SHH with PTCH [20,55]. Finally, SMO is characterized as a proto-oncogene because it was found that SMO mutants could cooperate with the E1A adenoviral protein in transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts [81].

trichepitheliomas, whereas Gli2 transgenic mice only developed BCC-like tumors. Transgenic mice with N-terminal deletion of Gli2, developed the benign trichoblastomas, cylindromas and hamartomas but rarely developed BCCs [86]. In heterozygote transgenic PTCH mice, BCC lesions are not found [87,88]. However, these mice upon chronic UV exposure do develop microscopic BCC lesions, 40% of which present p53 mutations [89]. Similar microscopic BCC-like lesions are seen in transgenic mice carrying a constitutively active mutated SMO gene [81] and the mouse epidermis is hyperproliferative, expresses BCC protein markers and gives rise to numerous downgrowths which invade the underlying dermis [85]. Animal studies have also confirmed the importance of tissue environment in BCC growth. BCCs from Shh transgenic mice transplanted onto the backs of scid mice, did not differentiate, stopped growing and did not metastasize indicating the requirement of their own specific stroma for development [69].

## 6. SHH signaling and BCC in mouse models

Genetically engineered mice have served as dynamic models and essential tools for investigating the role of the different partners involved in the SHH pathway in the development of BCCs. The analysis of mice with targeted inactivation or haploinsufficiency of the Shh, Ptch, Smo and Gli genes has enabled important insights on their impact on proliferation, development and oncogenesis. Thus, overexpression of SHH in the skin of transgenic mice revealed skeletal and skin anomalies with the development of BCC-like tumors reminiscent of the NBCC syndrome [69]. Regenerated human skin transgenic for SHH when grafted onto immune-deficient mice also displayed abnormal BCC-like structures [83]. The rapid and frequent appearance of BCC-like tumors in the absence of induced mutations are a strong indication that activation of the SHH pathway is sufficient for BCC formation. BCC-like tumors also develop in mice overexpressing the downstream SHH modulators Gli1 and Gli2 [84–86]. Gli1 transgenic mice developed BCCs and as well as the benign BCC-associated trichoblastomas and

## 7. Towards a therapy for BCC

The discovery of small molecules antagonists of SHH signaling, such as cyclopamine, has opened up exciting new prospects for BCC therapy [90–93]. Cyclopamine, a plant-derived SHH pathway inhibitor, was first discovered when sheep fetuses were found to have malformations comparable to those found in HPE because pregnant ewes had ingested cyclopamine-containing plants [90,94,95]. This led to the search for synthetic small molecules inhibitors of hedgehog signaling and validation of their effects. Thus, it was shown that CUR61414, an alkaloid was active as an antagonist of the SHH pathway and was found to have therapeutic potential when tested in vitro BCC models [92]. Thus, punch biopsies of skin from Ptch +/- transgenic mice when cultured in vitro and treated with Shh protein were found to develop BCC-like tumors. Treatment of these tumors with CUR61414 resulted in regression of tumors and a pre-treatment before tumor development inhibited their formation. Moreover, tumor development in the Ptch +/- skin following UV irradiation was also seen to regress with CUR61414

treatment. Small, easy to synthesize molecules, which are soluble are proving to be interesting therapeutic agents. Their pharmacological properties are interesting as they can inactivate SHH pathway after a single application indicating prolonged activity and are not toxic. Recently, a new approach, the immunoprevention of BCCs with recombinant Hip, has been shown to hold promise as a preventive treatment for NBCC patients destined to develop BCCs [96]. Thus, these authors suggest that genes consistently overexpressed in BCCs by aberrant hedgehog signaling may have great potential as targets for immunization to eliminate tumors effectively in BCC predisposed patients.

## 8. Conclusions

The last decade has seen the accumulation of a large body of evidence that has linked SHH deregulation to the genesis of basal cell carcinomas. The transgenic mouse models have provided striking crucial data indicating that aberrant SHH activity is an early event in BCC formation. Benign skin lesions in humans associated with BCCs, also present PTCH mutations indicating SHH pathway disruption to be an early event. The numerous studies of human BCCs has revealed that the constitutive activation of the SHH pathway can result from the activation of the poto-oncogenes SMO or SHH or be due to loss of function of the tumor suppressor gene PTCH. Further investigation into the molecular functions of SHH pathway, its known members and other novel components will be essential in furthering our understanding of BCC development, an exciting field of research today.
