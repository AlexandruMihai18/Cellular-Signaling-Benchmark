### Abstract

Four major natriuretic peptides have been isolated: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and Dendroaspis-type natriuretic peptide (DNP). Natriuretic peptides play an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis maintaining blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume. The classical endocrine effects of natriuretic peptides to modulate fluid and electrolyte balance and vascular smooth muscle tone are complemented by autocrine and paracrine actions that include regulation of coronary blood flow and, therefore, myocardial perfusion; modulation of proliferative responses during myocardial and vascular remodeling; and cytoprotective anti-ischemic effects. The actions of natriuretic peptides are mediated by the specific binding of these peptides to three cell surface receptors: type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A), type B natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-B), and type C natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-C). NPR-A and

NPR-B are guanylyl cyclase receptors that increase intracellular cGMP concentration and activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases. NPR-C has been presented as a clearance receptor and its activation also results in inhibition of adenyl cyclase activity. The wide range of effects of natriuretic peptides might be the base for the development of new therapeutic strategies of great benefit in patients with cardiovascular problems including coronary artery disease or heart failure. This review summarizes current literature concerning natriuretic peptides, their receptors and their effects on fluid/electrolyte balance, and vascular and cardiac physiology and pathology, including primary hypertension and myocardial infarction. In addition, we will attempt to provide an update on important issues regarding natriuretic peptides in congestive heart failure.

### 1. INTRODUCTION

Natriuretic peptides are a family of cardiac- and vascular-derived hormones that play a relevant role in cardiovascular homeostasis mainly through the regulation of blood volume and pressure. In the second half of the 1950s, electron microscopy revealed the presence of secretory granules in cardiac atrial cells. Later, in the 1980s, de Bold et al. reported that injection of atrial myocardial extracts into rats was able to induce natriuresis and consequently a decrease in blood pressure ([de Bold et al., 1981](#)), suggesting the existence of a hormone that was identified in 1983 as the atrial natriuretic peptide
(ANP; Kangawa and Matsuo, 1984). Although the endocrine function of the heart has long been recognized, the physiological activities of natriuretic peptides go beyond their classical endocrine effects regulating blood volume and pressure. Natriuretic peptides also exert autocrine and paracrine effects within circulation in normal and pathological conditions, regulate renin secretion, progesterone release, endothelin secretion, and vasopressin secretion (Anand-Srivastava, 2005).

The mammalian family of natriuretic peptides consists of ANP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and the recently identified *Dendroaspis*-type natriuretic peptide (DNP). BNP was isolated in 1988 from porcine brain (Sudoh et al., 1988), although the major source of circulating BNP are cardiac ventricles (Saito et al., 1989), and showed a similar biological activity to ANP. Two years later, another structurally related peptide from porcine brain, CNP, was isolated and identified (Sudoh et al., 1990). DNP was isolated in the first half of the 1990s from the venom of the green mamba (*Dendroaspis angusticeps*) (Schweitz et al., 1992) and its physiological role was suggested by the observation of DNP immunoreactivity in human plasma (Schirger et al., 1999). These peptides are encoded by different genes but the mature active forms of all the natriuretic peptides possess a characteristic 17-amino acid ring structure, which contains several invariant amino acids (Fig. 3.1). Three natriuretic peptides, ANP, BNP, and CNP, have been shown to regulate cardiovascular homeostasis by the occupation of three membrane receptors; two are guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors, known as natriuretic peptide receptor type A (NPR-A) and natriuretic peptide receptor type B (NPR-B), while natriuretic peptide receptor type C (NPR-C) lacks enzymatic activity (Potthast and Potter, 2005; Potter et al., 2006). NPR-A shows high affinity and is activated by ANP and BNP (Nakao et al., 1992b), NPR-B is activated by CNP (Koller et al., 1991) and, finally, the NPR-C binds all natriuretic peptides (Anand-Srivastava, 2005).

### 2. Natriuretic Peptides and Their Receptors

#### 2.1. Natriuretic peptides

##### 2.1.1. Atrial natriuretic peptide

ANP is a 28-amino acid peptide released in physiological state by the cardiac atria in response to wall stretch resulting from blood pressure and volume loading, as well as to physical exercise (Lang et al., 1985; Vuolteenaho et al., 1985). The human ANP gene encodes a preprohormone that contains 151 amino acids (Oikawa et al., 1984), which is posttranslationally modified to obtain a 126-amino acid proANP that is stored in secretory granules in the atrial myocytes (Vuolteenaho et al., 1985).

Figure 3.1 Natriuretic peptide signaling and peptide selectivity. Mature active forms of natriuretic peptides show a common 17-amino acid ring formed by disulfide bond formation between two cysteine residues. Variable C-terminal and N-terminal tails are present in ANP, BNP, and DNP, while CNP lacks the C-terminal tail. NPR-A and NPR-B are activated by ANP, BNP, CNP, and DNP, as indicated, and occupation of these receptors results in the stimulation of cGMP generation leading to physiological responses. The third type of natriuretic peptide receptor, NPR-C is involved in peptide internalization and clearance, and is also coupled to adenylyl cyclase through a Gi protein. ANP, BNP, and CNP have been reported to interact with NPR-C and inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, which results in a decrease in intracellular cAMP concentration.

proANP is cleaved by the transmembrane cardiac serine protease called corin to the biologically active 28-amino acid mature C-terminal ANP (ANP₉₉₋₁₂₆) (Yan et al., 2000). Alternative processing of proANP by a protease in the kidney generates a 32-residue peptide named urodilatin, which is important in regulating sodium and water excretion.

The expression of ANP is low in the ventricles in the physiological state and that it is increased in a number of cardiovascular disorders, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and upon volume and pressure overload (D'Souza et al., 2004; Ruskoaho, 1992). Hormones such as endothelin (Stasch et al., 1989), angiotensin (Soualmia et al., 1997), and arginine–vasopressin (Lachance et al., 1986) stimulate ANP release (Thibault et al., 1999), as well as water immersion (Ogihara et al., 1986) and head down posture (Hollister et al., 1986). Plasma levels of ANP in normal patients are ~10 fmol/ml and are elevated 10- to 30-fold in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF)
(Cody *et al.*, 1986; Mukoyama *et al.*, 1991; Potter *et al.*, 2006). ANP circulates in the blood reducing vascular tone and promoting diuresis/natriuresis to lower blood volume and pressure (Ahluwalia *et al.*, 2004).

### 2.1.2. Brain natriuretic peptide

BNP was initially purified from porcine brain extracts (Sudoh *et al.*, 1988). BNP is a polypeptide that contains 32 amino acids and is mainly secreted by cardiac atria and ventricles (Weber and Hamm, 2006), although, in contrast to ANP, that is predominantly secreted in the atria, the cardiac ventricle is the major site of synthesis and secretion of BNP (D’Souza *et al.*, 2004; Ogawa *et al.*, 1991). As for ANP, the human BNP gene encodes a 132-amino acids preprohormone that is posttranslationally modified to the 108-amino acids prohormone (BNP<sub>1–108</sub>). The proBNP is subsequently cleaved resulting in an inactive 76-residue amino-terminal fragment and a 32-amino acid C-terminal fragment, which is the mature biologically active peptide (Sudoh *et al.*, 1989).

In the cardiac atria, BNP is stored with ANP in granules; however, BNP is not stored in granules in the ventricles. Instead, ventricular BNP production is transcriptionally regulated by cardiac wall stretch (Potter *et al.*, 2005). BNP is expressed in response to venous volume and/or blood pressure. BNP expression has been found to be constant during chronic cardiac overload, although its levels are increased in hypertrophied heart. Healthy individuals have plasma BNP concentrations of ∼1 fmol/ml (3.5 pg/ml) or approximately one-tenth that of ANP (Potter, 2005). In contrast, plasma BNP concentrations of patients with CHF are elevated between 200- and 300-fold. The enormous range of plasma BNP concentrations between healthy subjects and patients with heart failure and the rapid induction of BNP expression in response to acute overload has been widely used as an indicative of elevated myocardial loading and cardiac stress (Mukoyama *et al.*, 1991; Tokola *et al.*, 2001). Other stimuli that induce BNP secretion are hypoxia, ischemia, and states of nephrosis and cirrhosis that are associated to an increase in central blood volume (D’Souza and Baxter, 2003; Toth *et al.*, 1994; Wong and Blendis, 1994).

### 2.1.3. C-type natriuretic peptide

CNP is the third member of the natriuretic peptide family identified. CNP is mainly expressed in the nervous system and vascular endothelial cells (Ogawa *et al.*, 1991; Woodard *et al.*, 2002a). Small amounts of CNP have been found in the cardiac tissue or circulating in blood (Yandle, 1994); however, in the nervous system the most abundant form of natriuretic peptide is CNP (Yandle, 1994). In addition, expression of CNP has also been found in the vascular endothelium, where it might exert its autocrine/paracrine roles in vascular tone and muscle cell growth (Komatsu *et al.*, 1992; Woodard *et al.*, 2002a); in fact, CNP has been shown to be more
potent than ANP inducing smooth muscle relaxation but shows a weaker effect on natriuresis and diuresis (Sudoh *et al.*, 1990). The cardiovascular effects of CNP are more likely mediated by local effects on blood vessel or by central actions on vasopressin and adrenocorticotropic release (Fowkes and McArdle, 2000; Komatsu *et al.*, 1992).

CNP is expressed and stored as a preprohormone that consists of 103 amino acids, which is then converted to two fragments of 22- and 53-amino acids through a multistep process involving a “pro-protein convertase” named furin (Wu *et al.*, 2003). The 22-amino acid fragment is the mature and more active CNP form (Ogawa *et al.*, 1992).

In contrast to ANP and BNP, which contains 5- and 6-amino acid residues in the C-terminal tail, respectively, CNP completely lacks this tail (Fig. 3.1). CNP gene expression is induced in response to a number of physiological and pathological vasoactive mediators including interleukin 1β, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (Suga *et al.*, 1992, 1993; Woodard *et al.*, 2002a), as well as by shear stress (Chun *et al.*, 1997), and is suppressed by insulin (Igaki *et al.*, 1996).

### 2.1.4. Dendroaspis-type natriuretic peptide

DNP is a recently isolated 38-amino acid peptide that shares structural and functional properties with the other members of the natriuretic peptide family. DNP immunoreactivity has been reported in human plasma, although purification of DNP from human plasma has not yet been achieved (Schirger *et al.*, 1999). The source of DNP has not been clearly identified although DNP-like immunoreactivity has been reported in rat aorta, carotid artery, and renal vasculature and tubules. DNP-like immunoreactivity was found to be regulated by endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and sodium nitroprusside but not by TGF-β (Woodard *et al.*, 2002b).

DNP binds to the ANP and BNP NPR-A (see Section 2.2), inducing vasorelaxation (Best *et al.*, 2002). In addition, DNP has been reported to elicit a marked inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis in culture rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (Woodard *et al.*, 2002b).

### 2.1.5. Other natriuretic peptides

In addition to ANP, BNP, CNP, and DNP, other peptides have been reported to exert a similar effect in mammals. Urodilatin is a peptide obtained by alternative cleavage of the C-terminal 32 amino acids of proANP in the distal tubules of the kidney, where it exerts its natriuretic effect (Schulz-Knappe *et al.*, 1988). This peptide is synthesized by the same gene that synthesizes ANP, but in the kidney, in contrast to all other tissues that have been investigated, the ANP prohormone is processed differently, resulting in the formation of urodilatin rather than ANP (Levin *et al.*, 1998; Nakao *et al.*, 1992a; Schulz-Knappe *et al.*, 1988).
The intestinal epithelium expresses two peptides, guanylin and uroguanylin, which are involved in water absorption in the gut (Beltowski, 2001). Guanylin and uroguanylin participate in the prevention of hypernatremia and hypervolemia after salty meals. Ingestion of a salty meal induces secretion of both peptides into the intestinal lumen, where they inhibit $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ absorption and induce $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and water secretion. In addition, these hormones have been shown to stimulate renal electrolyte excretion by inducing natriuresis, kaliuresis, and diuresis (Fonteles *et al.*, 1998; Forte *et al.*, 2000).

A peptide with similarity to natriuretic peptides was identified by two separate groups in bone and muscle cells; for this reason, this peptide is currently referred to as osteocrin/Musclin (Nishizawa *et al.*, 2004; Thomas *et al.*, 2003). This peptide binds with high affinity to NPR-C, but not to NPR-A or NPR-B, in a manner that is competitive with ANP; therefore, in cells expressing NPR-A and NPR-C osteocrin/Musclin increases ANP-dependent cGMP generation, presumably by blocking NPR-C mediated ANP clearance. Although the physiological role of osteocrin/Musclin is not completely understood, its expression in human skeletal tissue, particularly in osteoblasts in developing human neonatal bone and at sites of bone remodeling, such as in iliac crest bone biopsies from adults, suggests a role for this protein in bone formation (Bord *et al.*, 2005).

## 2.2. Natriuretic peptide receptors

Natriuretic peptides exert their physiological effects by the occupation of three membrane receptors. Two subtypes are membrane-associated guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors, known as NPR-A and NPR-B, which mediate most of the physiological actions of natriuretic peptides. Both receptors are particulate guanylyl cyclases, different from the soluble guanylyl cyclase, heterodimeric heme-containing cytosolic enzyme of monomers with molecular masses of 70 and 80 kDa activated by nitrovasodilators, nitric oxide, and free radicals. The NPR-C lacks guanylyl cyclase activity and among other functions acts as a clearance receptor.

### 2.2.1. Natriuretic peptide receptors-A and -B

NPR-A and NPR-B are single-transmembrane receptors with a similar basic structure. NPR-A is an ~120-kDa glycoprotein that contains a variable extracellular natriuretic peptide-binding region, a conserved intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD), which has been reported to be essential for the regulation of NPR-A activity and receptor sensitivity, and a guanylyl cyclase domain with enzyme activity (Hamad *et al.*, 2003). NPR-A shows high affinity and is activated by ANP, BNP, and DNP (Best *et al.*, 2002; Nakao *et al.*, 1992b; Schweitz *et al.*, 1992), but BNP is approximately tenfold less potent than ANP. In contrast, CNP does not increase guanylyl
cyclase activity of NPR-A. NPR-B is activated only by CNP and neither ANP nor BNP increase guanylate cyclase activity in NPR-B expressing cells (Ogawa *et al.*, 1992; Yandle, 1994). The study of the regulation of guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-A revealed that the enzymatic activity of purified NPR-A cannot be stimulated solely by ANP<sub>1-28</sub> (Kuno *et al.*, 1986), suggesting that accessory mechanisms likely involving ATP, as well as a number of cations, including Mg<sup>2+</sup>, regulate the activation of guanylyl cyclase in NPR-A (Chang *et al.*, 1991; Kurose *et al.*, 1987). ATP has been reported to regulate NPR-A activity through the interaction with the receptor KHD (Joubert *et al.*, 2005) or the involvement of an ATP-regulated module, which represses the catalytic activity of NPR-A (Duda and Sharma, 2005).

Occupation of these receptors by natriuretic peptides induce cellular responses through the elevation of intracellular cGMP levels, which has been demonstrated in all tissues and cells that express NPR-A and NPR-B upon stimulation with natriuretic peptides. The increase in intracellular cGMP concentration following the occupation of NPR-A or NPR-B leads to the activation of a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) that transfers a phosphate from ATP to a serine of threonine residue in a target protein, which, in turn, mediate a specific physiological function. cGMP-mediated signaling is terminated by cGMP phosphodiesterases, which modulate the intracellular concentrations of cGMP and the duration and magnitude of the responses (D'Souza *et al.*, 2004).

### 2.2.2. Natriuretic peptide receptor-C

NPR-C is a transmembrane receptor with an extracellular domain of ~440 amino acids that shares ~30% homology with NPR-A and NPR-B, a transmembrane domain, and a 37-amino acid cytosolic domain (Porter *et al.*, 1990). Two different cDNAs encoding NPR-C have been identified (Murthy *et al.*, 1998). Consistent with this two vascular NPR-C of ~67 and 77 kDa have been reported (Kato *et al.*, 1991), suggesting the existence of two subtypes of NPR-C (Savoie *et al.*, 1995; Trachte *et al.*, 1995).

NPR-C is the most abundant NPR in most tissues. NPR-C is widely distributed in several cells and tissues including vascular smooth muscle cells, renal glomeruli and collecting ducts, adrenals, platelets, lungs, cerebral cortex, and cardiac purkinje fibers (Anand-Srivastava, 2005; Porter *et al.*, 1990). NPR-C binds ANP, BNP, and CNP with high affinity, although its affinity is higher for ANP and CNP than for BNP (Bennett *et al.*, 1991).

NPR-C has been involved in peptide clearance. It has been reported that NPR-C removes ANP and BNP from the circulation (Maack *et al.*, 1993). In addition, it has also been suggested that NPR-C may be involved in other biological effects of natriuretic peptides through second messengers different from cGMP, such as the adenyl cyclase/cAMP pathway (Murthy *et al.*, 2000). The adenyl cyclase/cAMP system is one of the best
characterized signal transduction mechanisms and mediates the physiological actions of a variety of hormones. This pathway is composed of three elements: a receptor; a cyclase with enzymatic activity; and a stimulatory or inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, the G proteins, which act as transducers and in the presence of guanine nucleotides communicates the signal from the membrane hormone receptor to the cyclase, resulting in an increase (if a Gs is involved) or decrease (when the transducer is a Gi) in the generation of cAMP. Natriuretic peptides have been reported to inhibit cAMP synthesis in a number of tissues, an effect that is dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotides, suggesting the involvement of a G protein in the NPR-adenylyl cyclase transduction system ([Anand-Srivastava, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2004.11.013)). The functional coupling between NPR-C and adenylyl cyclase was confirmed by the use of the ring deleted analog of ANP des[Glul<sup>18</sup>, Ser<sup>19</sup>, Gln<sup>20</sup>, Leu<sup>21</sup>, Gly<sup>22</sup>]ANP<sub>4–23</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub> (C-ANP<sub>4–23</sub>) that binds specifically to NPR-C. C-ANP<sub>4–23</sub> has been reported to inhibit cAMP generation in a number of tissues including aorta, adrenal cortical membranes, vascular smooth muscle cells ([Anand-Srivastava et al., 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(90)80725-8)), and renal glomeruli ([Woodard et al., 2004a, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2004.07.015)). We have recently provided evidence that the 77 kDa protein is involved in peptide internalization and clearance, whereas the 67 kDa NPR-C-like protein inhibits adenylate cyclase activity; therefore, both NPR-C-like proteins are involved in the regulation of cardiovascular physiology ([Woodard et al., 2002c](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-4889(02)00068-2)).

### 3. FUNCTIONS OF NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES

#### 3.1. Vascular effects of natriuretic peptides

In addition to the effects of natriuretic peptides on nonvascular cells, involving actions on renal tubular and mesangial cells, inhibition of renin, vasopressin or aldosterone release, which are important for their diuretic and natriuretic actions, a number of relevant systemic actions ascribed to natriuretic peptides are mediated to the reduction in total peripheral resistance. This effect might be achieved by direct effect on the vessel wall, such as the effect of natriuretic peptides inducing dilation of the renal afferent arterioles, which induces an increase in glomerular filtration and subsequently diuresis. In addition, the vascular effects of natriuretic peptides might be mediated by regulation of the sympathetic tone and catecholamine release from peripheral sympathetic neurons.

The direct vasorelaxant actions of natriuretic peptides are mediated by the activation of PKG. This enzyme regulates the opening of ion channels in vascular smooth muscle cells inducing hyperpolarization and, therefore, vascular relaxation ([Dora et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1161/01.res.0000007334.28785.0f)). In addition, cGMP decreases cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration by a mechanism that is likely mediated by
PKG (Rosado *et al.*, 2001). The effects of cGMP on intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis include a reduction in Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores, reduced Ca²⁺ entry, and an increased Ca²⁺ removal from the cytosol either by promoting Ca²⁺ sequestration into the internal stores or increasing Ca²⁺ extrusion through the plasma membrane (Geiger *et al.*, 1992). Finally, natriuretic peptides might induce vasorelaxation through the activation of cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases (D'Souza *et al.*, 2004). Natriuretic peptides increase the cellular levels of cGMP that activates phosphodiesterase-II, which is expressed in heart, platelets, liver, and adrenals. Activation of phosphodiesterase-II results in the decrease of intracellular cAMP concentration and thus impairs cAMP-mediated responses (Whalin *et al.*, 1991).

The vascular smooth muscle can regulate itself in the absence of endothelium and can provide a braking mechanism to the cellular proliferative effects common to disease and injury to the lumen of the arterial wall. Recent studies have shown that CNP is expressed in mammalian vascular smooth muscle independent of endothelial cells (Kelsall *et al.*, 2006; Mendonca *et al.*, 2006; Woodard *et al.*, 2002a). This expression could be modulated by cytokines expressed by immune cells and platelets as demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells treated with PDGF (Mendonca *et al.*, 2006), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Mendonca *et al.*, 2006; Woodard *et al.*, 2002a), and TGF-β (Mendonca *et al.*, 2006; Woodard *et al.*, 2002a). Indeed, serum addition (10% fetal bovine serum) after 48 h serum starvation of human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells shows a greater than 60-fold induction of CNP-transcript levels after only 8 h (Mendonca *et al.*, 2006). Interestingly, human aortic endothelial cells show a much lower response in CNP-transcript level to serum addition, reaching a level of only threefold control value at 3 h and declining toward time-matched control values at 8 and 24 h after serum addition (Mendonca *et al.*, 2006). This positive effect of serum treatment on CNP mRNA was significantly reduced or abolished in the presence of genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as tyrosine kinase is a known downstream effector of most serum-derived growth factors such as bFGF, PDGF, and VEGF. Likewise, the most profound effect of serum stimulation of CNP seemed to work through protein kinase C activation (PKC; Mendonca *et al.*, 2006).

Gene therapy using an adenoviral construct of CNP in vascular smooth muscle cells has also been shown to have a profound reduction in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and restenosis following balloon angioplasty (Pelisek *et al.*, 2006). This is not surprising considering very high levels of NPR-C have been found in neointimal vascular smooth muscle cells up to 9 months after percutaneous coronary intervention (Naruko *et al.*, 2005).

A recent study has reported that the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to have a strong but acute inhibitory effect on NPR-B activity, as measured by cGMP, in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells
(Abbey-Hosch *et al.*, 2004). A different study suggested that the CNP-induced inhibitory effect on smooth muscle cell intimal proliferation might be somehow mediated by the regulation of the $\alpha_{1}$-adrenoreceptor and IP$_{3}$ receptor (Xiaohong *et al.*, 2000).

## 3.2. Natriuretic peptides in cardiac physiology and pathology

ANP and BNP have been reported to show either negative or no effects on cardiac contractility when administered exogenously and even in the same species the findings are conflicting. ANP has been shown to have no effect in isolated rat cardiomyocytes or in isolated rat, feline or canine heart (Burnett *et al.*, 1987; Hirose *et al.*, 1998; MacDonell and Diamond, 1997; Yanagisawa *et al.*, 1987); however, ANP exerts a negative inotropic effect on avian cardiomyocytes or rat ventricular trabeculae (Stone *et al.*, 1990; Vaxelaire *et al.*, 1989). The inotropic effects of CNP are not less inconsistent and contradictory, and both positive and negative effects have been reported (D'Souza *et al.*, 2004). The reason of these conflicting results is still not clear but evidences suggest a possible concentration-dependent effect of natriuretic peptides on cardiac contractility. According to this hypothesis, low concentrations of natriuretic peptides might have positive inotropic effects while high concentrations of natriuretic peptides, sufficient to get micromolar concentrations of cGMP might induce negative inotropic effects due to inhibition of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization, especially Ca$^{2+}$ entry through voltage-dependent channels and therefore by interfering with the cardiac contractile mechanism (Massion and Balligand, 2003). In any case, the clinical benefits of natriuretic peptides due to their negative inotropic effects have been considered insignificant compared to the cardiovascular effects observed due to their diuretic and natriuretic actions. For instance, nesiritide, a recombinant form of human BNP, may offer tolerability and clinical advantages over currently used vasodilators, inodilators, and inotropes; specially, nesiritide does not exert proarrhythmic effects. Nesiritide is effective and well tolerated in patients receiving concomitant $\beta$-blocker therapy or with renal insufficiency, which suggests nesiritide as a suitable first option for the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated CHF (Keating and Goa, 2003).

All the natriuretic peptides investigated have been shown to induce vasodilator effects in the coronary circulation, based on the effect of blockade of the guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors NPR-A and NPR-B with the antagonist HS-142-1 (Supaporn *et al.*, 1996). Most studies have been focused on the administration of ANP, which exerts a concentration-dependent vasodilator action in canine and feline coronary arteries *in vivo* (Chu and Cobb, 1987; Yanagisawa *et al.*, 1987). The vasodilator actions of ANP are especially relevant in the epicardial coronary arteries (Adachi *et al.*, 1989). Similar effects have been reported for BNP in humans; although little effect of BNP on thecoronary resistance vessels have been demonstrated (Okumura *et al.*, 1995). The effects of ANP are endothelium independent and resistant to inhibitors of the soluble guanylyl cyclase in both canine and feline coronary arteries (Matsumoto *et al.*, 1999; Yanagisawa *et al.*, 1987). Although there are evidences supporting that ANP stimulates nitric oxide synthase in human renal proximal tubular cells (McLay *et al.*, 1995), its relevance in coronary vasodilation remains unclear.

CNP has also been shown to induce vasorelaxant effects in porcine and human coronary arteries (Wei *et al.*, 1994; Wiley and Davenport, 2001). Although the mechanism mediating the coronary vasorelaxant actions of CNP are not completely understood, recent studies have suggested a role for nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylyl cyclases (Brunner and Wolkart, 2001a,b). In addition, CNP has been presented as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor via activation of NPR-C and the opening of a G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K⁺ channel (Chauhan *et al.*, 2003). Likewise, vascular smooth muscle hyperpolarization elicited by CNP/EDHF depends on inwardly rectifying K⁺ (KIR) channels and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase (blocked by Ba²⁺ and ouabain, respectively; Chauhan *et al.*, 2003). The hyperpolarizing effects of CNP provide new insight for the development of therapeutic strategies to alter perfusion of isolated vascular beds (Ahluwalia *et al.*, 2004). Recent studies have reported that the actions of CNP on vascular tone are not limited to its hyperpolarizing effects and includes other vascular actions that mimic some of the anti-atherogenic actions of nitric oxide and prostaglandin I₂, thus CNP is an important regulatory factor for coronary blood flow and provide a cardioprotective effect preventing myocardial injury during ischemia/reperfusion (Chauhan *et al.*, 2003; Hobbs *et al.*, 2004).

Myocardial ischemia is one of the main causes of death in developing societies. Acute occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery following atherosclerotic plaque rupture is a primary cause of myocardial ischemia, which leads to myocyte loss and the development of a wave of necrosis and infarction of the ischemic tissue (D'Souza *et al.*, 2004). The consequences of myocardial infarction depend on the duration of the ischemia, and, therefore, the extent of the ischemic territory. The regulation of the cardiovascular function by the neurohormonal response to myocardial infarction has recently been widely investigated and special attention should be taken to the effect of natriuretic peptides. BNP concentration increases rapidly in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction. The plasmatic concentration of BNP increases within hours of the onset of acute myocardial infarction to reach a concentration that might be more than 100 times the physiological concentration (Morita *et al.*, 1993). Experimental studies have demonstrated that after left ventricle ischemia, BNP concentration in the ventricle increased about twofold in the first 12 h and fivefold at day 1 compared to the physiological levels. The concentration of BNP inthe coronary effluent was found to be dependent on the duration of the ischemia (D’Souza and Baxter, 2003). In addition, BNP expression was demonstrated in the ischemic and non-ischemic areas of the left ventricle as well as in the right ventricle (Hama *et al.*, 1995). ANP mRNA and concentration has also been shown to increase immediately after myocardial infarction (Galipeau *et al.*, 1988; Kleber *et al.*, 1992). These findings provide evidence that BNP, and probably ANP, are sensitive markers of acute myocardial infarction than ANP.

Rapid BNP release in response to experimental coronary artery occlusion has also been demonstrated in rat hearts (Toth *et al.*, 1994). The same authors reported that ANP and BNP secretion was stimulated by hypoxic perfusion, independently of myocardial damage, which suggests that natriuretic peptide release is associated to hypoxia and, subsequently, to a decrease in the cellular energy state due to impairment of the oxidative metabolism (Toth *et al.*, 1994).

Rapid release of natriuretic peptides following infarction has been suggested to provide a protective action on the ischemic myocardium, as well as other mediators of vascular, myocardial, and neuronal origin, including bradykinin, adenosine, and endogenous opioids (D’Souza *et al.*, 2004). Experiments carried out in rat hearts perfused with BNP prior and during coronary artery occlusion have demonstrated that BNP significantly reduces infarct size in a concentration-dependent manner (D’Souza *et al.*, 2003a). The protective effects of BNP are associated to an increase in myocardial cGMP concentration and are impaired by $K_{ATP}$ channel blockers and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylyl cyclase, suggesting that activation of nitric oxide–dependent soluble guanylyl cyclase is somehow involved in the cardioprotective effects of BNP over infarction size (D’Souza *et al.*, 2003b).

## 3.3. Antiproliferative effects of natriuretic peptides

Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells is an important response of arteries to several vascular injuries, and is involved in a number of cardiovascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, restenosis after angioplasty, hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy, postinfarction myocardial remodeling, cardiac failure, or ventricular dilatation. Cytokines and growth factors, released by the injured vascular wall and activated platelets, stimulate proliferation of the vascular smooth muscle cells (Clowes *et al.*, 1983). Natriuretic peptides have been reported to inhibit cell proliferation in several cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells through the generation of cGMP. In support of this hypothesis, nitric oxide, a cGMP-elevating agent, elicits antiproliferative effects in vascular smooth muscle cells (Garg and Hassid, 1989). ANP and BNP have been reported to modulate cellgrowth and proliferation in smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, preventing the secretion of extracellular matrix (Abell *et al.*, 1989; Horio *et al.*, 2000; Tsuruda *et al.*, 2002). In vascular smooth muscle cells, CNP, which is commonly referred as an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (Brown *et al.*, 1997), has been presented as the most potent inhibitor of growth and proliferation, an effect mediated by the occupation of the guanylate cyclase-coupled NPR-B (Porter *et al.*, 1992). Consistent with this, CNP has been shown to inhibit arterial intimal thickening *in vivo*, most likely through the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation induced by vascular injury (Brown *et al.*, 1997). The presence of transcripts of ANP, and predominantly CNP, as well as mRNAs coding for all three NPRs in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells has been reported (Woodard *et al.*, 2002a). The production and secretion of CNP in vascular smooth muscle cells are stimulated by TGF-β while bFGF plays an inhibitory role, suggesting that ANP, and mainly CNP, are coexpressed with the NPRs in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, providing evidence for a vascular natriuretic peptide autocrine system of physiological relevance in these cells (Woodard *et al.*, 2002a). Recent studies have reported that small peptide fragments containing 12 amino acids irrespective of the region of the cytoplasmic domain of NPR-C inhibit proliferation induced by vasoactive peptides, such as angiotensin II, endothelin-1, and arginine vasopressin, through G<sub>iα</sub> protein and MAP kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways, which demonstrate the antiproliferative effects of NPR-C (Hashim *et al.*, 2006).

## 3.4. Natriuretic peptides and hypertension

Primary hypertension is a genetically determined disorder affecting the homeostatic systems that normally regulate blood pressure that is modulated by superimposed environmental factors. These control systems include endocrine, renal, vascular, cardiogenic, and neurogenic mechanisms that interact in order to achieve blood pressure homeostasis. Among those control systems, the interaction between blood pressure and the kidney is especially relevant and kidney might both play an essential role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and equally be a prime target of damage caused directly or indirectly by hypertension. Kidney is extremely sensitive to changes in blood pressure and responds in several ways to maintain circulatory homeostasis (Raine, 1994). In addition, several renal function abnormalities, such as increased renal vasoconstriction, increased renin and aldosterone secretion, or altered activity of monovalent ion transporters play an important role in the genesis of human hypertension (Orlov *et al.*, 1999; Van Hooft *et al.*, 1991). Among the potential pathogenic factors involved in hypertension, ANP is an obvious candidate due to its relevant effects of natriuresis, diuresis, and hypertension itself. In spontaneously hypertensiverats (SHR), where hypertension is a polygenic trait and both autosomal and sex-linked genes have been suggested to influence blood pressure ([Hilbert *et al.*, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm0291-147)), an exaggerated natriuretic and diuretic response to exogenous ANP has been reported compared to normotensive strains ([Pollock and Adrendshorst, 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2828(90)90058-8)). Consistent with this, renal glomerular NPR-A shows a higher affinity for ANP<sub>1–28</sub> and lower maximal binding capacity in SHR compared to age-matched normotensive rats at all ages investigated ([Woodard *et al.*, 2004b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2004.04.012)). In addition, ANP<sub>1–28</sub> induced a higher cGMP production rate in renal glomeruli from SHR than in age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats, both in young (3-week-old rats before the development of hypertension in SHR) and in adult rats ([Woodard *et al.*, 2004b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2004.04.012)). The abnormality in NPR-A-mediated signaling is unlikely mediated by hypertension itself since adult (12-week old) DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, which showed the same or even higher blood pressure as age-matched SHR, failed to show a significant difference either in basal or ANP<sub>1–28</sub>-stimulated cGMP production compared with their control Wistar Kyoto rats ([Woodard *et al.*, 2004b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2004.04.012)). In addition, we have reported that expression of NPR-A and NPR-C in isolated glomerular membrane homogenates in normotensive and DOCA-treated hypertensive rats is similar ([Woodard *et al.*, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2005.10.018)). Therefore, the high rate of cGMP production in SHR occurs before the development of hypertension, indicating its primary role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

Abnormalities in NPRs in other structures have been reported in hypertensive subjects. It is well known that several brain structures play an important regulatory role in blood pressure via peripheral or central neurogenic and neurohormonal mechanisms. Several studies have reported an increase in ANP content in the hypothalamus and the olfactory bulb after stimulation with several hormones, including catecholamines, or ethanol, which is probably involved in the modulation of the increases in blood pressure ([Bastos *et al.*, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(01)00285-8); [Guillaume *et al.*, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(97)00317-0)). In addition, the number of ANP-binding sites has been shown to be reduced in all the areas of the brain investigated in SHR compared to normotensive rats ([Brown and Czarnecki, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2828(91)90018-5); [Saavedra *et al.*, 1986](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2828(86)90018-5); [Tang *et al.*, 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2828(93)90018-5); [Woodard *et al.*, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(03)00018-5)), together with a higher rate of cGMP production in NPR-A from olfactory bulb and hypothalamus in SHR ([Woodard *et al.*, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(03)00018-5)).

## 3.5. Natriuretic peptides and oxidative stress

Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance between the production of oxidants and the ability of the antioxidant systems to neutralize the radicals and to prevent or repair the damage. Among the mechanisms involved in the enhanced endogenous production of ROS are specially relevant the mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, superoxide-dismutase, the activation of arachidonic acid metabolism, the metabolism of phosphoinositides, and the
activity of NADH/NADPH oxidase (Iuliano *et al.*, 1997; Li *et al.*, 2002; Seno *et al.*, 2001; Tsutsui, 2004). Oxidative stress is associated with the accumulation of reactive species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species, reactive nitrogen oxygen species, as well as unbound metal ions (Davis *et al.*, 2001). ROS include oxygen radicals such as superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, as well as non-radical derivatives of oxygen including hydrogen peroxide ($\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$). Reactive nitrogen species include nitric oxide radical, and reactive nitrogen oxygen species include the highly reactive oxidant species peroxynitrite, which is a derivative of the reaction between nitric oxide and the superoxide radical. These reactive species are highly oxidizing and potently damaging to redox-sensitive intracellular proteins and DNA (Aschner *et al.*, 2007). In addition, they are also associated to peroxidation of membranes and to premature aging.

ROS, such as $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$, have also been presented as intracellular messengers required for the activation of a large number of signal transduction mechanisms, especially those mediated by tyrosine kinases (Salmeen *et al.*, 2003; Yada *et al.*, 2003). In this context, a large number of physiological agonists have been reported to stimulate $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ production in several cell types (Frank *et al.*, 2000; Kimura *et al.*, 1995; Redondo *et al.*, 2005; Rosado *et al.*, 2004; Seno *et al.*, 2001). ROS induce the activation of a number of tyrosine kinase proteins, such as proteins of the MAPK pathway, proteins of the Src family, and focal adhesion proteins (Abe *et al.*, 1997; Ben Mahdi *et al.*, 2000; Finkel, 1998). The latter are involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Rosado *et al.*, 1998), another major target of ROS that has been shown to contribute significantly to the inherent sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress (Haarer and Amberg, 2004; Rosado *et al.*, 2002). Consistent with this, $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ (10 $\mu$M) has been shown to induce a temporal reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in platelets, similar to that induced by agonists on actin microfilaments and microtubules (Bouaziz *et al.*, 2007; Redondo *et al.*, 2006). This actin remodeling consists of an initial net depolymerization followed by a net increase in the actin filament content (Redondo *et al.*, 2004a). Our observations are consistent with the involvement of ROS in the activation of the *de novo* conformational coupling between the type II IP$_3$ receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum and hTRPC1 channels in the plasma membrane, which has been proposed to mediate store-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry (SOCE) in human platelets (Ben-Amor *et al.*, 2006; Lopez *et al.*, 2006; Rosado and Sage, 2000, 2002; Rosado *et al.*, 2005; Woodard *et al.*, 2007), where cortical actin filaments prevent constitutive SOCE activation blocking the approach of portions of the ER to the PM (Rosado and Sage, 2001; Rosado *et al.*, 2000). The correlation between $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release and entry and actin reorganization induced by $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ suggests that low concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ might act as physiological molecules in human platelets, as previously reported (Rosado *et al.*, 2004; Seno *et al.*, 2001). However, ROS have also been found to exert a biphasic concentration-dependent

effects on intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis, so that at high concentrations H₂O₂ induces Ca²⁺ release from mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial Ca²⁺ stores most likely through the inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase, the sensitization of IP₃ receptors and the inhibition of Ca²⁺ extrusion mechanisms, which leads to an abnormally elevated basal cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration (Redondo *et al.*, 2004b; Suzuki and Ford, 1992).

Although free radicals are known to play a physiological role in optimal cell function, excessive oxidative stress has been involved in a variety of cardiovascular disorders. It has been reported that increased production of ROS has been associated with the development of hypertension, an effect that might be associated to elevated methylglyoxal level, which, in turn, might induce generation of ROS (Chang and Wu, 2006). A number of studies support the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In hypertensive animal models such as SHR and DOCA-salt induced-hypertension, supplementation with the antioxidants vitamin C or vitamin E reduced blood pressure and vascular remodeling (Chen *et al.*, 2001). Consistent with the role of oxidative stress in hypertension, overexpression of superoxide dismutase, which neutralizes superoxide ions, and catalase, which decomposes H₂O₂, reduces hypertension and increases NO availability in different models of experimental hypertension (Chu *et al.*, 2003). In addition, tempol (a superoxide dismutase mimetic) decreases blood pressure; increases NO bioavailability; and improves endothelium-dependent relaxation, kidney damage, and glomerular filtration in SHR and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (Chen *et al.*, 2001; Kawada *et al.*, 2002; Kojsova *et al.*, 2006).

Oxidative stress also contributes importantly to the pathophysiology of inflammation in the cardiovascular system. ROS play a key role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and the development of apoptotic events in smooth muscle cells (Yuan *et al.*, 2007). Recent evidences suggest that ROS and reactive nitrogen species are associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm formation in several experimental models and humans (McCormick *et al.*, 2007). Furthermore, it is well known that oxidative stress is involved in cardiac hypertrophy and in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies, ischemic heart disease, and CHF. ROS have been reported to be able to induce cellular damage and acceleration of cell death through apoptosis and necrosis, which is especially relevant in advanced heart failure (Suematsu *et al.*, 2003). Moreover, ROS can impair cellular energetics through actions on mitochondrial enzymes in the heart, a tissue that is remarkably sensitive to oxygen deprivation (Solaini and Harris, 2005). A large body of evidence suggests a role for increased ROS production in the processes underlying left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular remodeling, and heart failure. In isolated cardiomyocytes, hypertrophy induced by a number of agonists, including catecholamines, angiotensin II, endothelin-1, or TNFα has
been shown to involve enhanced ROS generation (Hirotani *et al.*, 2002; Nakamura *et al.*, 1998; Pimentel *et al.*, 2001). In addition, enhancement of superoxide by inhibition of superoxide dismutase results in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, which further supports a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of myocardial remodeling and failure (Siwik *et al.*, 1999). Enhanced ROS production has also been shown to be involved in left ventricular remodeling resulting from experimental myocardial infarction or chronic CHF, which can be prevented by ROS scavengers such as by long-term administration of dimethylthiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger (Kinugawa *et al.*, 2000), or by treatment with the antioxidant probucol (Sia *et al.*, 2002), which exert multiple beneficial morphological effects including better left ventricular function, reduced neurohumoral activation, and preservation of renal function. In addition to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, enhanced production of ROS has been shown to induce reexpression of fetal gene programs (Hare, 2001; Kono *et al.*, 2006).

It has been reported that oxidative stress is increased in most of the body regions, including the myocardium, in patients with heart failure (Mallat *et al.*, 1998). There is also a good correlation between oxidative stress, myocardial dysfunction, and the progression and severity of heart failure in CHF patients, (Hornig *et al.*, 1998; Mallat *et al.*, 1998; McMurray *et al.*, 1993). Oxidative stress has been shown to be increased in ischemic and non-ischemic CHF, a process where neutrophils may play an important role. Short- but mainly long-term administration of vitamin C reduces oxidative stress, decreases neutrophil superoxide anion generating capacity, and increases flow-mediated dilation (Ellis *et al.*, 2000). Among the different sources of ROS, the NADPH oxidases, which are specifically activated by several stimuli such as angiotensin II, cytokines, and mechanical forces, have been suggested to be especially important in modulating redox-sensitive signaling pathways that might underlie the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and ventricular remodeling (Cave *et al.*, 2005).

In bovine carotid artery endothelial cells, treatment with 0.5 and 1 mmol/l H₂O₂ resulted in nine- and tenfold increases of CNP concentration in the media. Further RT-PCR analysis reported that CNP mRNA expression in these cells was rapidly enhanced within 1 h with 1 mmol/l H₂O₂, reaching a peak at 3 h to show a tenfold increase. These findings suggest that H₂O₂ augments endothelial secretion of the endothelium-derived relaxing peptide CNP, which might be an endothelial response under oxidative stress to compensate the impaired nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation in hypertension and atherosclerosis (Chun *et al.*, 2000).

Recent studies have reported that infusion of human ANP (carperitide), in addition to its known effects improving hemodynamics in patients with heart failure, shows antioxidant actions, reducing the level of superoxide in cardiomyocytes induced by addition of H₂O₂ (Shono *et al.*, 2007). Due to the expression of NPR-A throughout the body, it is expected thatcarperitide exerts its effects in many organs, such as the kidneys, blood vessels, and heart. However, treatment of isolated cardiomyocytes with exogenous ANP at low concentration (10⁻⁸ mol/l or 10⁻⁹ mol/l; comparable with the therapeutic dose of carperitide), rapidly and strongly suppressed the expression of thioredoxin, a multifunctional protein that contains a redox-active dithio/disulfide in the active site and exerts cytoprotection against oxidative stress ([Hare, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/84.5.567)), which suggests that infused carperitide shows a direct antioxidant action on the failing heart *in vivo* ([Shono et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.01.005)). The antioxidant efficiency of ANP has been reported in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, where the hypertrophic response of the heart to stimuli such as angiotensin II, consisting of increase in cardiomyocyte size, β-myosin heavy chain and c-fos expression, superoxide generation, and gp91phox expression, was significantly reduced by ANP. These effects have been shown to be mimicked by the superoxide dismutase mimetic, tempol. ANP, as well as tempol, also significantly inhibited endothelin-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and superoxide anion generation. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the antihypertrophic actions of ANP are accompanied by a reduction in the cellular levels of superoxide ([Laskowski et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.01.005)), suggesting that an antioxidant action contributes to the well-known antihypertrophic effects of ANP.

The protective effects of ANP against oxidant-induced injury have also been reported in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. In these cells, treatment with the water-soluble 2,2′-Azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), a free radical generating system, induces a significant increase in cytosolic free Ca²⁺ concentration and phospholipase D (PLD) activity as well as a decrease in intracellular pH due to the activity of the Ca²⁺/H⁺ exchanger, that operates the efflux of Ca²⁺ coupled to H⁺ influx. Pretreatment of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with pharmacological ANP concentrations have been reported to attenuate the effects of AAPH, although no effects were observed with physiological ANP concentrations, suggesting a possible role of the natriuretic peptide as protective effector against early events of the oxidative stress ([De Vito et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00407-1)). In these cells, lysophosphatidic acid has been reported to induce cell growth and ROS production. Both effects were impaired by physiological concentrations of ANP, without having any significant effect on lysophosphatidic acid receptors expression. The effect of lysophosphatidic acid on cell growth and ROS production has been suggested to be mediated by activation of the lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and its substrate Akt, since ANP-induced inhibition of lysophosphatidic acid-activated responses was mimicked by cell treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and physiological concentrations of ANP reduced the activation of Akt by lysophosphatidic acid. These findings also point out that the pathway phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt might be a target for ANP-induced regulation of cell proliferation ([Baldini et al., 2005a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.01.005)).
In Hep G2 cells and human monocytes or macrophages, ANP has been shown to regulate ROS production through either the recruitment of a signal pathway involving an increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation, down-regulation of mRNA NHE-1 expression, and regulation of phospholipase D activity or the involvement of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid (Baldini *et al.*, 2003, 2005b), pointing to ANP as a modulator of ROS production.

### 4. FURTHER ASPECTS OF NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE

CHF, a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to the organs, leading to tissue congestion and affecting the ability of the kidney to dispose of sodium and water and increasing edema, affects a large number of patients. Only in the United States, nearly 5 million people suffer from this pathology. Among the cardiac risk factors involved in the development of CHF smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity are especially relevant. Current medications for the treatment of CHF include diuretics, inotropes, vasodilators, and $\beta$ blockers, which are designed to overcome the alterations on single components of the diverse pathways contributing to CHF. For instance, diuretics help the kidneys to eliminate excess fluid, thereby reducing blood volume and heart workload, vasodilators facilitate blood flow through the peripheral arteries and $\beta$ blockers slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of catecholamines. Despite the treatment of CHF with multiple drugs, almost all CHF patients experience one or several episodes of acute CHF that require hospitalization. A major factor leading to the less than optimal treatment of CHF is its focus on the symptoms of the pathology rather than addressing the underlying cause. In most CHF cases, the inability of the heart to pump blood efficiently is the result of other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or reduced kidney function.

It has been reported that patients with heart disease show attenuated natriuretic peptide response, which might be attributed to the recently described downregulation in the density of NPR-A in heart and coronary artery of patients with ischemic heart disease (Singh *et al.*, 2006).

As previously mentioned, BNP has several physiological effects, such as a vasodilation, or the increase in the excretion of sodium (natriuresis) and fluid (diuresis). When the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, BNP is produced and its actions work in concert on the vessels, heart, and kidney to decrease the fluid load on the heart, allowing the heart to function better and improving cardiac performance (Fig. 3.2). Recent studies have reported evidence supporting that adjunctive therapy with nesiritide (human recombinant BNP; hBNP) may be beneficial for patients with advanced heart

In response to cardiac failure endogenous or exogenous administered ANP and BNP enhanced natriuresis and diuresis and induce local vasodilation. CNP reduces the development of cardiac remodeling and attenuates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. The net result of these actions is a decrease in blood pressure and circulatory volume, thus reducing cardiac workload.

failure and renal insufficiency (Yancy and Singh, 2006). In patients hospitalized with decompensated CHF, nesiritide improves hemodynamic function and their clinical status (Colucci et al., 2000). The major hemodynamic effects of hBNP reported includes decrease in cardiac preload and systemic vascular resistance, improvement of cardiac output without increasing heart rate, and a reduced plasma norepinephrine and aldosterone levels; therefore, hBNP has been presented as a pharmacologically active peptide with potential in the therapy for decompensated heart failure (Abraham et al., 1998), and compared with dobutamine, a pharmacological tool commonly used as a means of treating decompensated CHF, nesiritide is a safer short-term treatment for patients with decompensated CHF (Burger et al., 2002).

Recombinant human ANP (carperitide) has also been shown to be useful for management of acutely decompensated CHF. Carperitide has been approved for the clinical management of acute decompensated CHF in Japan since 1995 (Chen and Burnett, 2006). Investigation of the cardiovascular effects of carperitide reported that this compound has a negligible

effect on coronary perfusion pressure or heart rate, but attenuated the contractile force in isolated guinea pig hearts. Intravenous infusion of carperitide decreased arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance in the anesthetized and conscious dogs. In addition, intravenous carperitide reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary pressure, and right atrial pressure in dogs with CHF induced by coronary artery occlusion and saline loading, suggesting that carperitide can improve the hemodynamic alterations in animals with acute experimental heart failure (Fig. 3.2) (Hidaka *et al.*, 1993).

As recently found, an increase in the plasma levels of CNP of myocardial origin and of its precursor was observed in CHF, suggesting that CNP is produced in the heart during cardiac failure where it may elicit important compensatory physiological effects on ventricular remodeling (Fig. 3.2) (Del Ry *et al.*, 2006a; Kalra *et al.*, 2003). Continuous administration of CNP in rats with experimental myocardial infarction has shown that CNP improved left ventricular dysfunction and reduced the development of cardiac remodeling due to its potent antifibrotic and antihypertrophic actions (Soeki *et al.*, 2005). CNP may represent an important new local autocrine and endocrine antiremodeling mediator in CHF (Del Ry *et al.*, 2006b).

CNP has also been shown to attenuate the development of restenosis, a significant clinical problem limiting the long-term therapeutic success of balloon dilation or stent implantation. Recent studies investigating the therapeutic effects of periadventitial liposome-mediated CNP gene transfer *in vivo* reported a significant long-term reduction of neointimal formation without compromising endothelial repair. The therapeutic effect of CNP gene transfer was better than single CNP administration. The advantages of CNP-based therapy during angioplasty are its physiological origin and the simultaneous inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation while promoting re-endothelialization (Fig. 3.2) (Pelisek *et al.*, 2006). Therefore, the inclusion of CNP in drug-eluting stents might be used to reduce the risk of restenosis, providing a considerable improvement to cardiovascular treatments so that future adverse coronary events can be averted.

## 5. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In addition to its mechanical function, the heart is an endocrine organ that upon cardiac stretch and overload releases natriuretic peptides, which, in turn, exert a variety of beneficial actions to the cardiovascular system, including vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis. Cardiac-derived natriuretic peptides, mostly BNP, have emerged as useful biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients showing heart failure. In fact, the inactive amino-terminal fragment of the BNP prohormone (NT-proBNP), which is more

stable than mature BNP, has been presented as a tool for the diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction and elevated NT-proBNP plasma concentrations have been reported to be predictive of poor prognosis in a variety of cardiovascular diseases (Costello-Boerrigter and Burnett, 2005). In addition to cardiac-secreted natriuretic peptides, CNP, synthesized and released by vascular endothelial cells shows strong antiproliferative effects, inhibiting arterial intimal thickening through the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation induced by vascular injury. A number of studies have provided evidence supporting that adjunctive therapy with nesiritide (human recombinant BNP) or carperitide (human recombinant ANP) may be beneficial for patients with advanced heart failure and renal insufficiency due to their effects modulating fluid and electrolyte balance, vascular smooth muscle tone, and the regulation of coronary blood flow, myocardial perfusion and proliferative responses during myocardial and vascular remodeling; although further clinical studies are necessary to evaluate risks and benefits, safety, and comparative efficacy of the use of natriuretic peptides with other treatments.
