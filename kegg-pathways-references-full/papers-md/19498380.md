MHC class I antigen presentation: learning from viral evasion strategies

**Ted H. Hansen* and Marlene Bouvier†**

Abstract | The cell surface display of peptides by MHC class I molecules to lymphocytes provides the host with an important surveillance mechanism to protect against invading pathogens. However, in turn, viruses have evolved elegant strategies to inhibit various stages of the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway and prevent the display of viral peptides. This Review highlights how the elucidation of mechanisms of viral immune evasion is important for advancing our understanding of virus–host interactions and can further our knowledge of the MHC class I presentation pathway as well as other cellular pathways.

The recognition of viral peptides in the context of MHC class I molecules by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is a key event in the elimination of virus-infected cells. Prior to presenting peptides on the cell surface, MHC class I molecules undergo a stringent maturation process in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by transiently interacting with specialized proteins, including calreticulin, ERp57 (also known as PDIA3), tapasin and the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)¹⁻³ (FIG. 1). This macromolecular assembly is referred to as the peptide-loading complex (PLC). The functional role of the PLC is to ensure that nascent MHC class I molecules become associated with sufficiently stabilizing peptides to enable their prolonged expression on the cell surface.

To freely replicate in infected cells, viruses have evolved numerous strategies that target key stages of the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway, with the goal of preventing the presentation of viral peptides to CTLs. Numerous viral proteins have been found to inhibit components of the MHC class I assembly pathway, which have been reviewed previously, with an emphasis on their diversity⁴⁵. However, it has become apparent recently that these viral immunomodulatory proteins can be grouped based on the mechanisms that they have evolved to prevent antigen presentation. It is also now being appreciated that viral immune evasion proteins have great potential for use in studies probing the molecular mechanisms of peptide generation and loading onto MHC class I molecules, as well as the intracellular sorting pathways that regulate the level of expression of MHC class I molecules and ensure that loading with peptides occurs in the ER. The usefulness of these proteins as probes stems from their potent effects and functional specificity. Studies using viral immune evasion proteins as molecular probes also help to advance our understanding of fundamental cell biological mechanisms. In this Review, we discuss how viral inhibitors target the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway and the relevance of characterizing these mechanisms for increasing our understanding of virus–host interactions. We also provide insights into the potential use of virus-encoded inhibitors for refining our understanding of the molecular basis of normal processes of antigen presentation and other cellular pathways.

### Inhibitors of proteasomal processing

The proteasome is the central cytoplasmic processing unit for the generation of peptides for the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway⁶. It is therefore not surprising that viruses have evolved mechanisms to interfere with proteasomal degradation of proteins as a means to prevent the presentation of viral peptides by MHC class I molecules to CTLs (FIG. 1). The degradation of proteins into short peptides by the proteasome is a highly complex process that is not yet completely understood. It is known that proteolysis is regulated in an ATP-dependent manner by a catalytic subunit called the 20S core particle, which is capped at both ends by the 19S regulatory particle⁷ (FIG. 2). The proteasome recognizes and unfolds ubiquitylated proteins through its 19S subunit and targets deubiquitylated forms of these substrates to the 20S subunit for proteolysis.

A well-known example of a virus that can specifically inhibit proteasomal processing is Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). The EBV genome encodes EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein, which escapes processing by the proteasome⁸ (FIG. 2). Although EBNA1 is the only viral protein that is expressed by latent EBV-infected B cells and is found in all EBV-induced malignancies, no CTL responses against full length EBNA1 can be detected in infected individuals⁸⁹. The sequence of EBNA1 contains long repeats of glycine and alanine

Figure 1 | The MHC class I antigen presentation pathway is targeted by viral immune evasion proteins. The degradation of proteins by the proteasome generates peptides that are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Nascent MHC class I molecules associate with calreticulin, tapasin and ERp57 to form the peptide-loading complex, which facilitates the loading of peptides into the MHC class I peptide-binding groove. Kinetically stable MHC class I molecules then transit to the cell surface. Key stages of the pathway are targeted by immunomodulatory proteins. Proteasomal processing inhibitors, such as Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), escape processing by the proteasome. TAP function inhibitors, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) protein ICP47 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein US6, block peptide and ATP binding, respectively. Herpesvirus protein UL49.5 and EBV protein BNLF2a also inhibit TAP-mediated peptide transport. Tapasin function inhibitors, such as HCMV protein US3 and adenovirus protein E3-19K, inhibit the peptide optimization and recruiting functions of tapasin, respectively. ER retainers or retrievers of MHC class I molecules, such as adenovirus protein E3-19K and coxpox virus protein 203 (CPXV203) retain MHC class I molecules in the ER. ER-associated degradation inducers, such as HCMV proteins US2 and US11 and mouse herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) protein mK3, target MHC class I molecules for proteasomal degradation. Sorters, such as murine CMV proteins gp48 and HIV-1 protein Nef, divert the trafficking of MHC class I molecules from the Golgi to a lysosomal compartment. Finally, the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV) proteins kK3 and kK5 induce rapid endocytosis of cell surface MHC class I molecules, leading to lysosomal degradation.

residues that are necessary for its resistance to proteasomal processing<sup>8</sup>. More recently, it was reported that Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a protein known as latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA1), which has a similar inhibitory property to that of EBNA1 (REF. 10). Interestingly, a highly repetitive acidic sequence that is rich in glutamine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues was shown to be responsible for the resistance of LANA1 to proteasomal degradation<sup>11,12</sup>. As EBNA1 and LANA1 have no sequence homology<sup>12</sup>, this raises the question of how repeat motifs in two different viral proteins can serve as inhibitory signals of the proteasomal degradation process. In EBNA1, it was shown that the glycine and alanine repeats do not prevent the ubiquitylation of EBNA1 (REF. 9), nor do they inhibit the proteolytic activity of the 20S subunit<sup>13</sup>. Instead, it was suggested that the glycine and alanine repeats may interfere with the recognition and unfolding functions of the 19S subunit<sup>13,14</sup>. It is possible that the repeat motifs in EBNA1 and LANA1 have similar structural features with inhibitory properties. Alternatively, the repeats may inhibit an as-yet-unidentified step in the process of proteasomal degradation.

The mechanism of antigen processing by the proteasome is probably the least well-characterized event of the MHC class I presentation pathway. A more detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of inhibition by EBNA1 and LANA1 would contribute to furthering our understanding of proteasomal degradation. It is probable that numerous viruses have evolved elegant mechanisms to evade proteasomal degradation to facilitate their survival in host cells. The characterization of other viral proteins that are functionally analogous to EBNA1 and LANA1 will provide additional opportunities to examine and better understand the proteasome machinery.

### Inhibitors of TAP

The TAP complex is composed of TAP1 and TAP2, each consisting of an amino-terminal transmembrane domain and a carboxy-terminal nucleotide-binding cytoplasmic domain<sup>15</sup> (FIG. 1). The TAP1 and TAP2 transmembrane helices form a pore across the ER membrane through which antigenic peptides can be transported, a process that is regulated by ATP hydrolysis in the cytoplasmic domains<sup>16</sup>. It is thought that the binding of peptides to TAP1–TAP2 cytoplasmic domains triggers a conformational change

that stimulates ATP hydrolysis, thereby providing the energy that is required for peptide translocation. To date, the mechanistic basis of this process is not completely understood. The functional dedication of the TAP complex to the MHC class I presentation pathway makes this protein a key target for viral immune evasion, as its inhibition would have minimal, if any, consequences on host cell functions other than peptide transport.

Two different viral gene products are well known to exploit the function of TAP (FIG. 1) — herpes simplex virus (HSV) ICP47 protein and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US6 protein ${ }^{17-21}$. More recently, the UL49.5 proteins from herpesviruses that infect cattle, horses and pigs, and EBV BNLF2a protein have also been shown to block TAP-mediated peptide transport ${ }^{22-25}$. These viral inhibitors severely limit the supply of peptides to the ER and, consequently, impair the maturation of MHC class I molecules.

ICP47 is a cytoplasmic membrane-associated protein that interacts directly with TAP and blocks peptide binding (FIG. 2). Interestingly, it was shown that the ICP47-mediated inhibition of TAP affected certain MHC class I haplotypes more than others ${ }^{26}$. This reflects the fact that some MHC class I molecules are less dependent on TAP for peptide loading in the ER than others ${ }^{27}$. Evidence suggests that ICP47 may act as a competitive inhibitor by binding with high affinity to the site of antigenic peptides on the cytoplasmic face of TAP ${ }^{28,29}$. However, because ICP47 also induces a conformational change in TAP ${ }^{30}$, it is possible that this effect may be sufficient to destabilize and inactivate TAP. The association of ICP47 with TAP inhibits peptide binding and turns off ATP hydrolysis and peptide translocation ${ }^{30,31}$, without inhibiting ATP binding ${ }^{28,29}$. The domain of ICP47 that mediates the inhibitory effect is an N-terminal fragment of 32 residues ${ }^{32,33}$. The precise binding site of ICP47 on TAP remains to be determined.

US6 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that disables TAP through a mechanism that is distinct to that used by ICP47 (FIG. 2). US6 interacts directly with the side of TAP that is in the ER lumen ${ }^{19,34}$ and can inhibit ATP binding and hydrolysis on the cytoplasmic side by inducing long-range conformational rearrangements in TAP across the ER membrane ${ }^{34,35}$. Hence, by depriving TAP of its energy source, peptide translocation into the ER is inhibited. It is worth noting that US6 has no effect on peptide binding by TAP ${ }^{19,35}$. The exact interaction surface between US6 and TAP remains to be defined. Similarly to ICP47, US6 inhibits TAP in a species-dependent manner, which highlights the remarkable specificity of these proteins as viral inhibitors ${ }^{28,29,36,37}$. The UL49.5 proteins have diverse mechanisms of TAP inhibition. For example, the bovine herpesvirus UL49.5 targets TAP for proteasomal degradation, and the equine herpesvirus UL49.5 blocks the binding of ATP to TAP ${ }^{23,38,39}$. Finally, the recently identified BNLF2a protein from EBV was shown to prevent the binding of peptides and ATP to TAP ${ }^{25}$.

Despite the different strategies used by ICP47, US6, UL49.5 and BNLF2a to block peptide transport, a common theme of these proteins is to block peptide-dependent, ATP-induced conformational changes in TAP,

Figure 2 | Modulation of proteasome and TAP functions by viral immune evasion proteins. The proteasome is the central unit for the degradation of ubiquitylated proteins into peptides, which are then translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). A remarkable property of Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is to evade proteasomal processing, such that no EBNA1-derived peptides are generated. The ability of EBNA1 to escape proteasomal processing is due to long repeats of glycine and alanine residues in the protein. How these repeats confer inhibitory properties to EBNA1 is unclear, but they do not prevent ubiquitylation of the protein. ICP47 from herpes simplex virus inhibits peptide binding to the cytoplasmic face of the TAP complex. By contrast, US6 from human cytomegalovirus binds to the ER-luminal side of TAP but, remarkably, prevents ATP binding to TAP on the cytoplasmic side. The molecular mechanisms by which ICP47 and US6 block peptide transport are not completely defined, but they seem to exploit the conformational flexibility of TAP that is normally required to transport peptides. Ub, ubiquitin.

thereby exploiting the conformational flexibility of TAP, which is normally required for peptide translocation. The concept of conformational fluidity in the PLC is consistent with the need for MHC class I components to be structurally coupled to each other to act cooperatively. It is clear that more insights into the molecular mechanisms of these viral inhibitors could help to define the nature of the conformational changes in the TAP1–TAP2 complex that drive peptide transport in the PLC. Furthermore, because ICP47, US6, UL49.5 and BNLF2a can modulate peptide binding, ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, they are useful molecular tools to understand how these events act synergistically to activate TAP function ${ }^{40,41}$. Detailed knowledge of the functions of ICP47, US6, UL49.5 and BNFL2a would not only help to define how some viruses hide from the immune system but also contribute to the refinement of structural and functional models of the PLC ${ }^{33,42-44}$.

### Inhibitors of tapasin

Tapasin is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is essential for the expression of optimally stable MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. In the PLC, tapasin stabilizes the groove of MHC class I molecules against irreversible denaturation and maintains it in a peptide-receptive state ${ }^{45-48}$ (FIG. 1). In addition, tapasin alone can increase the rates of peptide association and
dissociation onto MHC class I molecules<sup>47</sup>. As a consequence of its chaperone-like and catalytic functions, tapasin influences the process of peptide loading in such a way that only those peptides that can form long-lived complexes with MHC class I molecules become part of the presented repertoire<sup>47,49</sup>. This process is commonly referred to as peptide editing or peptide optimization. In addition, tapasin physically recruits ERp57 (or calreticulin-associated ERp57)<sup>50</sup> and TAP<sup>51</sup> to the PLC. Because tapasin is a dedicated component of the PLC, it is an ideal target for viruses to interfere with the presentation of viral peptides to CTLs (FIG. 1).

US3. HCMV encodes an immunomodulatory protein, US3, that directly binds to and inhibits tapasin<sup>52</sup> (FIG. 3). US3 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed during the immediate early phase of infection by HCMV. The association of US3 with tapasin inhibits optimization of peptide cargo and causes MHC class I molecules to be retained in the ER, although substantial amounts of MHC class I molecules can still reach the cell surface<sup>53</sup>. This differential effect of US3 on MHC class I cell surface expression highlights the finding that MHC class I molecules are not all equally dependent on tapasin for maturation in the ER<sup>54</sup>. US3 and tapasin associate through their domains that are in the ER lumen, but the transmembrane domain of US3 is also required for the inhibition of tapasin<sup>52</sup> (FIG. 3). Although the precise mechanism of US3 function remains to be fully explained, the fact that US3 directly binds to tapasin and inhibits optimization of the peptide repertoire offers opportunities to learn more about the structure–function relationship of tapasin. For example, a characterization of the US3 binding surface on tapasin, possibly through a mutational analysis of tapasin or crystallization of the soluble US3–tapasin complex, may help to further delineate which region in tapasin is involved specifically in peptide optimization<sup>44</sup>. Tapasin mutants that exhibit impaired interaction with MHC class I molecules<sup>44,55</sup> (M.B., unpublished observations) could guide such studies. Furthermore, although the US3–tapasin association has no effect on TAP recruitment by tapasin<sup>53</sup>, it would be of interest to determine whether this association inhibits the recruitment of ERp57, as this may provide a strategy to better understand the functional relationship between this protein and tapasin. In summary, the inhibitory function of US3 offers a new way to further examine the effects of tapasin on the peptide repertoire.

E3-19K. The type I transmembrane glycoprotein E3-19K from adenovirus also inhibits a crucial function of tapasin, namely its ability to bridge TAP to MHC class I molecules<sup>51</sup>. However, unlike US3, E3-19K mediates this activity by binding to TAP<sup>56</sup> (FIG. 3), without blocking peptide transport. It was suggested that this strategy may be an alternative mechanism evolved by adenoviruses to downregulate the expression of MHC class I molecules that are only weakly targeted by E3-19K through direct interactions<sup>56</sup> (see later). The association of E3-19K with TAP inhibits the formation of the TAP–tapasin complex and, therefore, impairs the inclusion of TAP into the PLC<sup>56</sup>. This suggests that E3-19K may have evolved a binding site that mimics the TAP binding site on tapasin, allowing it to function as a competitive inhibitor. This view implies a certain structural relatedness between E3-19K and tapasin, possibly at the level of their transmembrane domains (see later). Alternatively, it is possible that E3-19K induces a conformational change in TAP that prevents its association with tapasin. To date, the molecular properties of the TAP–tapasin complex are not well characterized, although leucine-rich sequences in the first N-terminal transmembrane helices of TAP1 and TAP2 have been implicated as binding sites for a putative leucine zipper motif in the transmembrane domain of tapasin<sup>41,42,57–59</sup>. Residues in the transmembrane domain of tapasin that are crucial for the stabilization of TAP1 (REFS 57,60) and TAP2 (REF. 59) have also been identified. Because E3-19K is a ligand for TAP and an inhibitor of the TAP–tapasin complex, further experiments aimed at elucidating the mode of interaction between E3-19K and TAP may provide clues on how tapasin recruits TAP. Moreover, biochemical and functional studies of E3-19K and TAP in the presence of either ICP47 or US6 might help to delineate TAP regions that are involved in the tethering of TAP to tapasin or in the transport of peptides.

Overall, viral inhibitors of tapasin such as US3 and E3-19K represent innovative tools to characterize the molecular basis of tapasin functions. As it is a key component in the assembly of the PLC, characterization of tapasin function will help to understand how the process of peptide association and dissociation is kinetically and mechanistically synchronized in the PLC.

ER retainers or retrievers of MHC class I molecules

At any stage of their assembly, MHC class I molecules are susceptible to being targeted by viral proteins for retention in the ER (FIG. 1). For example, adenovirus E3-19K directly associates with MHC class I molecules and blocks their transport out of the ER^{61–64} (FIG. 3). This association is mediated by the ER-luminal domains of both proteins, and the retention effect is mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of E3-19K^{63,65–71}. Evidence has been provided showing that soluble E3-19K targets both immature and mature MHC class I molecules, but has a stronger association with the mature form^{71}. Interestingly, the association of E3-19K with immature MHC class I molecules stabilizes the peptide-binding groove against conformational denaturation^{71}. Evidence was also provided indicating that E3-19K displays an allele and locus specificity towards MHC class I molecules and has a preference for HLA-A over HLA-B molecules; E3-19K does not detectably associate with HLA-C molecules under identical conditions^{66,72–75}. The functional implication of this locus specificity remains to be determined.

Studies of the interaction of E3-19K with different HLA-A molecules have shown that specific residues in the peptide-binding groove, including residue 56 of MHC class I, have crucial roles in modulating the association and ER retention of MHC class I molecules by E3-19K^{67,68,75}. Thus, the space around MHC residue 56 (located at the N-terminal end of the groove) is probably where E3-19K interacts with MHC class I molecules. This finding implies that, when targeting MHC class I molecules, E3-19K is unlikely to compete with components of the MHC class I assembly pathway, which are thought to bind at the C-terminal end of the peptide-binding groove^{76,77}. Finally, the finding that MHC class I molecules that are associated with E3-19K can still be loaded with antigenic peptides^{63,71} suggests that E3-19K binds to the outer surface of the peptide-binding groove, possibly in a way that is similar to how US2 binds to MHC class I molecules^{78}.

More recently, it was reported that cowpox virus (CPXV) encodes a protein known as CPXV203, which exploits the ER retention pathway in a similar manner to E3-19K^{79,80} (FIG. 3). CPXV203 is a soluble protein that causes MHC class I retention in the ER owing to a C-terminal ER retention motif^{79}. Evidence shows that CPXV203 targets mature MHC class I molecules; it will be interesting to see whether CPXV203 also associates with immature MHC class I molecules, as seen with E3-19K.

Although several aspects of the functions of E3-19K and CPXV203 remain to be established, these proteins have the potential to provide insights into unaddressed questions regarding the MHC class I presentation pathway. For example, because E3-19K differentially interacts with immature and mature MHC class I molecules, it could be used to investigate peptide-induced conformational changes at the N-terminal end of the peptide-binding groove. It is attractive to speculate that the ability of E3-19K to discriminate between MHC class I conformational states is due to structural changes in the N-terminal loop formed by MHC residues 46–52, which are located adjacent the crucial MHC residue 56.


This loop contains a linear epitope that is specific for the conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody 64-3-7 (REF. 81). An analogous loop on MHC class II molecules was suggested to be the binding site of HLA-DM^{82,83}. It would also be interesting to examine whether, in addition to its chaperone-like activity, E3-19K increases the kinetics of peptide association and dissociation and/or even alters the peptide repertoire, as does tapasin. Moreover, as E3-19K recycles between the ER and the cis Golgi and can discriminate between immature and mature MHC class I molecules, it may be a helpful tool for investigating quality control mechanisms for the retrieval of aberrantly assembled MHC class I molecules. Similar retrograde transport studies have been reported for the non-classical MHC molecule HLA-G^{84} and the B cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) and BAP29, which are putative cargo receptors that have been implicated in the retrieval of MHC class I molecules from post-ER compartments^{85,86}. Finally, studies of E3-19K from different adenovirus subgroups in combination with different MHC class I haplotypes may help to further define paradigms for how MHC class I substrate specificity is established for ER retention^{75}.

Inducers of ER-associated degradation

MHC class I chaperones are remarkably efficient in only allowing mature MHC class I molecules to exit the ER (FIG. 1). This raises the interesting question of what happens to MHC class I molecules that fail to assemble correctly. An example of this occurs under conditions of limited amounts of peptide, in which case immature MHC class I molecules accumulate in the ER. Interestingly, classical MHC class I molecules show dramatic isotypic differences in their relative peptide binding efficiency, and this results in their disparate assembly kinetics and chaperone dependencies^{87–89}. The MHC class Ib molecule H2-M3 provides an extreme example of peptide levels limiting maturation^{90}; a paucity of cellular N-formylated peptide ligands results in the ER retention of H2-M3 heavy chains, which can be induced on the cell surface after bacterial infection. In addition, an extensive pool of MHC class Ia and Ib heavy chains have to compete for what can be a limiting pool of β₂-microglobulin (β₂m) in the ER lumen^{91}. To maintain the required stoichiometry between MHC class I components and chaperones, and to assure that all MHC class Ia and Ib molecules can access the PLC, unassembled components need to be eliminated.

The elimination of incompletely assembled or misfolded nascent glycoproteins, including MHC molecules, occurs by a process collectively termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD)^{92}. ERAD of misassembled or misfolded substrates involves three sequential events: recognition of ERAD substrates in the ER lumen, their dislocation to the cytoplasm and their degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Little is known about the first two ERAD events. However, regarding the recognition of ERAD substrates, it is possible that the same chaperone proteins that facilitate their correct assembly are also involved in identifying aberrant folding. In addition, it is unclear how transmembrane glycoproteins are removed and what the

This is then cleaved from the mature protein by signal peptide peptidases after translocation.

Depending on the position and number of ubiquitin molecules that are attached, the ubiquitin tag can target proteins for degradation in the proteasomal complex, sort them to specific subcellular compartments or modify their biological activity.

nature, or even existence, is of pores that mediate the dislocation of ERAD substrates. Although there are preliminary data showing that unassembled MHC class I heavy chains undergo ERAD, the slow kinetics of this process in the absence of immune evasion proteins make it difficult to dissect its molecular mechanisms<sup>93</sup>. Owing to their ability to specifically target MHC class I molecules for rapid ERAD as well as to co-opt physiological ERAD pathways, the use of the immune evasion proteins US2 and US11 of HCMV and mK3 of mouse herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) has provided seminal insights into the molecular mechanisms of ERAD pathways<sup>5,94–96</sup> (FIG. 1).

US2 and US11. US2 and US11 are small type I membrane glycoproteins that target human MHC class I molecules for ERAD (FIG. 1). Although US2 and US11 have similar functions, the details of their mechanisms are distinct. Both US2 and US11 can physically associate with MHC class I heavy chains (as shown by western blotting) and it is assumed that they both bind directly to the heavy chain. Indeed, the nature of the direct binding of US2 to fully assembled HLA-A2 was revealed by the analysis of the crystal structure of the complex<sup>78</sup>. However, in cells US2 probably interacts with nascent MHC class I molecules, as US2 (but not US11) is physically associated with signal peptide peptidase<sup>97</sup>. Interestingly, in addition to US2 and US11, rhesus monkey CMV expresses the immune evasion protein rh178, which inhibits heavy chain translation in a signal peptide-dependent manner, thereby enabling it to target an extensive family of MHC class I gene products<sup>98</sup>.

Several components of mammalian ERAD pathways are homologous to known yeast ERAD components. For example, derlin 1 (the mammalian homologue of yeast Der1p) was first identified by its physical association with US11–MHC class I heavy chains and was shown to be required for US11-induced dislocation of heavy chains<sup>99,100</sup>. Derlin 1 then recruits other members of a putative dislocation core complex, including E3 ubiquitin ligases and SEL1L (the mammalian homologue of yeast Hrd3p)<sup>101</sup>. Recruitment of an E3 ligase is thought to confer ubiquitin substrate specificity and mediate ubiquitin conjugation, which is necessary for substrate dislocation (BOX 1). SEL1L is found in the ER lumen and potentially bridges substrate recognition by lectin-like chaperone proteins and substrate dislocation<sup>101</sup>. Although members of a putative dislocation complex are being defined, it remains to be clarified whether a dislocation pore exists in mammals. Both derlin 1 and SEL1L have recently been implicated in degradation pathways that do not involve viral immune evasion proteins, which suggests that this pathway is used for general glycoprotein quality control<sup>102,103</sup>. Surprisingly, US2-mediated MHC class I molecule degradation does not depend on derlin 1 and SEL1L, suggesting that US2 targets MHC molecules for degradation through a distinct pathway. The existence of multiple pathways initiating ERAD is supported by elegant studies in yeast that have defined three distinct membrane core complexes that service misfolded proteins with domains in the ER lumen (ERAD-L), proteins with intramembrane domains (ERAD-M) or proteins with cytoplasmic domains (ERAD-C)<sup>104</sup>. The US11 and mK3

**Box 1 | Viral and cellular MARCH ubiquitin E3 ubiquitin ligases**

The immune evasion proteins mK3 of mouse herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and kK3 and kK5 of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV) are the founding members of a family of viral and cellular proteins known as the MARCH (membrane-associated RING-CH) proteins. The location, linkage and extent of protein ubiquitylation can determine the fate of proteins in the cell. The basic process of ubiquitylation has been highly conserved and includes a cascade of three classes of enzymes — the E1, E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases — that interact sequentially to transfer ubiquitin (Ub) moieties to substrates (see the figure). E1 ligases, which are ubiquitin-activating enzymes, form a thioester bond with a carboxy-terminal glycine of ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent manner. The ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 ligase to an E2 ligase, which is an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Finally, E3 ligases facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin, typically to a lysine residue, on the substrate.

E3 ligases determine substrate specificity. There are hundreds of mammalian E3 ligases, most of which have RING domains defined by eight characteristically spaced conserved cysteine and histidine residues that form a zinc binding ‘cross-brace’ structure. Based on the order of their zinc binding residues, distinct subclasses of RING domains are designated. Transmembrane E3 ligases with RING-CH domains are typically known as MARCH proteins.

The type of linkage and extent of ubiquitylation (monoubiquitylation or polyubiquitylation) are important determinants of the fate of the modified proteins. For example, monoubiquitylation typically signals internalization of plasma membrane proteins or intracellular sorting that does not involve degradation. By contrast, polyubiquitylation of substrates with less than four ubiquitin moieties (through a lysine 48 linkage on ubiquitin) typically signals substrate degradation by the proteasome. Alternatively, the polyubiquitylation of membrane proteins through a lysine 63 linkage on ubiquitin can signal their sorting to late endosomal compartments or multivesicular bodies for ultimate degradation in lysosomes. Studies of the viral MARCH proteins are providing mechanistic insights into both proteasome and lysosome degradation pathways, as well as a contextual framework on which to dissect the diverse biology of 10 or more cellular MARCH proteins in humans and mice.
pathways are homologous to the yeast ERAD-L-mediated pathway, but the mammalian systems are more complex. In both yeast and humans, following dislocation from the ER, all of these pathways merge to induce the removal of ubiquitylated substrates from the ER by the ATPase p97 (cell division control 48 in yeast) and cofactors.

**Viral E3 ligase mK3.** The MHV68 E3 ligase mK3 specifically ubiquitylates mouse MHC class I heavy chains and targets them for ERAD<sup>105</sup> (FIG. 1). During infection, the expression of mK3 allows the virus to maintain a higher level of latency and reduces the number of anti-viral CTLs<sup>106</sup>. mK3 can be found associated with nascent MHC class I heavy chains only in the presence of TAP, its main binding partner<sup>107</sup>. Indeed, mK3 binds TAP, awaits entry of MHC class I molecules into the PLC, and ubiquitylates the C-terminal tail of the heavy chain, thereby targeting it for ERAD (FIG. 4A). It is important to note that the specificity of substrate ubiquitylation is based on the proximity of the catalytic RING–CH (cysteine and histidine) domain of mK3 to the tail of the heavy chain<sup>108</sup>. Similar to US11, mK3 is found in association with derlin 1, and the activity of mK3 in MHC class I dislocation depends on the ATPase p97 (REF. 109). So, it seems probable that these two immune evasion proteins access a similar degradation pathway. However, the mechanism by which US11 achieves protein degradation is unclear: it is not known whether US11 recruits a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, whether MHC class I heavy chains are directly ubiquitylated in the presence of US11 or whether a protein that associates with MHC class I molecules is ubiquitylated instead<sup>110</sup>. By contrast, mK3 is known to be required for direct ubiquitylation of nascent MHC class I heavy chains.

These properties and the finding that E3 ubiquitin ligases have a central role in the dislocation complex indicate that mK3 is a useful tool for investigating the role of ubiquitylation in ERAD. More specifically, studies of mK3 and its homologue kK3 from KSHV (discussed later) were the first to define non-conventional forms of substrate ubiquitylation through ester (serine or threonine) or thioester (cysteine) linkages, respectively<sup>108,111</sup>. Prior to these studies, it was thought that only lysine residues, or perhaps the N termini of substrates, were ubiquitylated<sup>112</sup>. Now, residues other than lysine are known to act as substrates for ubiquitin conjugation in physiological pathways involving cellular ubiquitin ligases<sup>113–115</sup>. The ability of mK3 to mediate ubiquitylation of different residues on the MHC class I cytoplasmic tail could be important because the cytoplasmic portions of different MHC class I isoforms are remarkably polymorphic; in certain MHC class I molecules, it is possible that only non-lysine residues are close to the RING domain for ubiquitin conjugation to occur (FIG. 4A). So, this mechanism allows mK3 to specifically target MHC class I molecules in a sequence-independent manner.

Studies of immune evasion proteins also provide insights into how membrane-bound ERAD substrates are dislocated. Pioneering studies showed that US2 associates with the SEC61 translocon, suggesting the model that ERAD substrates leave the ER the same way they

enter — that is, by their N terminus<sup>96</sup>. Although studies of yeast support this model<sup>116</sup>, US2-mediated dislocation accommodates a tightly folded domain of a size that is not predicted to be tolerated by an unmodified translocon<sup>117</sup>. Alternatively, the finding that mK3 ubiquitylates the C-terminal tail of MHC class I heavy chains suggests a simpler model in which ERAD substrates can be removed vectorially (that is, cytoplasmic tail first)<sup>108</sup>.

Thus, current data support the notion that there are multiple mechanisms and dislocation pores for the removal of ERAD substrates. The study of viral immune evasion proteins has already proven to be useful for dissecting the mechanisms of ERAD, and no doubt will continue to provide valuable information on this process. These findings are likely to continue to extend beyond antigen presentation to numerous other cellular processes, many of which are relevant to disease development<sup>118</sup>.

**Sorters**

The trafficking of MHC class I molecules from the ER to the cell surface can have marked effects on their antigen presentation function. Little is known about the mechanism of MHC class I molecule turnover at the cell surface; however, a key component that controls the expression of MHC class II molecules by dendritic cells (DCs) has been identified, which has provided information on this process. This molecule is MARCH1 (membrane-associated RING-CH protein 1), a cellular homologue of the immune evasion proteins mK3 of MHV68 and kK3 and kK5 of KSHV (discussed later). Indeed, the viral E3 ubiquitin ligases were discovered before the mammalian ones and inspired searches for mammalian homologues. The homologous ligases in mice and humans were termed MARCH1–MARCH10 (BOX 1), and MARCH1 was recently identified as a key regulator of MHC class II cell surface expression in B cells and DCs<sup>120,121</sup>. More specifically, inflammatory signals released following infection or tissue damage induce the maturation of DCs, and this results in the downregulation of MARCH1 expression and a transient increase in MHC class II expression. MARCH1 therefore regulates the turnover of MHC class II molecules on the cell surface. The best model for MARCH protein-mediated regulation of MHC class II molecules has been provided by the study of kK3 and kK5 of KSHV. This is consistent with the idea that KSHV acquired an ancestral MARCH gene from the host that then evolved in the virus to function in immune evasion.

**kK3 and kK5.** The KSHV proteins kK3 and kK5 are highly homologous to mK3 of MHV68 (REFS 122–124) (FIG. 1) and are also E3 ubiquitin ligases. However, unlike mK3, kK3 and kK5 induce rapid endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of MHC class I molecules, and not ERAD of MHC class I molecules. It is probable that the ability of mK3 to bind TAP is fundamental to this distinction.

KK3 seems to specifically detect human MHC class I molecules, whereas kK5 downregulates the expression of a large number of other cell surface receptors, including CD31 (also known as PECAM1), CD166 (also known as ALCAM), interferon-γ receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), CD86 (also known as B7.2), CD144

**Figure 4 | Proposed mechanisms for the modulation of MHC class I presentation pathway by herpesvirus proteins.**

A | Mouse herpesvirus 68 protein mK3 ubiquitylates MHC class I molecules, which results in their degradation by the proteasome through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. mK3 binds to its primary binding partner, transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), which is associated with the MHC class I specific chaperone tapasin (a). After assembling with β₂-microglobulin (β₂m), the MHC class I heavy chain binds the TAP–tapasin complex to await a suitable peptide ligand. TAP orients the mK3 catalytic RING domain such that it is in proximity with the tail of MHC class I molecules (b). The association of mK3 with TAP–tapasin induces the recruitment of an E2 ligase, which results in the polyubiquitylation of the MHC class I tail. β₂m also dissociates from the heavy chain (c), perhaps leading to the recruitment of the ER chaperone calnexin into the multimeric complex. Polyubiquitylation with lysine 48 linkages of the MHC class I heavy chain initiates partial denaturation of the heavy chain and the recruitment of the ATPase p97. p97 then facilitates the retro-translocation of the heavy chain to the cytoplasm by a putative dislocation channel that may include derlin 1 and mK3. The MHC class I heavy chain undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation in the cytoplasm mediated by the p97, resulting in the generation of ubiquitin (Ub) monomers and peptides (d).

B | Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus protein kK3 induces polyubiquitylation and internalization of MHC class I molecules. kK3 associates with MHC class I molecules in a post-ER compartment. Initially, kK3 induces the recruitment of the E2 ligase ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme H5 (UBCH5), which adds the first ubiquitin moiety to the tail of the MHC class I heavy chain, and then induces the recruitment of UBC13, which elongates the ubiquitin chain with lysine 63 linkages. The modified MHC class I heavy chain is then endocytosed in an epsin 1-dependent manner. Epsin 1 recruits clathrin, promotes vesicle formation and binds polyubiquitin chains on substrates. The targeted MHC class I molecule is ultimately directed to multivesicular bodies and degraded in the lysosomes. This pathway establishes a paradigm for how MARCH (membrane-associated RING-CH) proteins regulate the expression of MHC class II molecules.

(also known as VE-cadherin and cadherin 5), activation-induced C-type lectin (AICL; also known as CLEC2B) and MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and MICB¹²⁵. The ability of kK5 to downregulate AICL, MICA and MICB is of particular importance because these proteins are ligands for the natural killer (NK) cell activating receptors NKG2D (NK group 2, member D) and NKp80, respectively, thereby providing KSHV with an immune evasion strategy for NK cell lysis¹²⁶. From the viral perspective, evasion of both NK cells and CTLs is important because downregulation of only MHC class I molecules renders infected cells sensitive to NK cell-mediated lysis. Although the transmembrane domains of kK3 and kK5 have been implicated in substrate recognition, it remains unclear how kK5 can detect so many structurally unrelated substrates¹²⁷. More specifically, no sequence in the transmembrane domain of kK3 or kK5 has been identified that can predict substrate specificity. It seems possible that kK5 and perhaps kK3 do not detect a substrate-specific sequence, but instead bind various cellular proteins that confer substrate specificity, similarly to the binding of TAP by mK3.

Multivesicular body  
An endocytic intermediate  
organelle in the lysosomal  
degradative pathway, which  
contains small vesicles and  
is surrounded by a limiting  
membrane.

Key components of the molecular pathway of kK3-  
mediated regulation of MHC class I expression have been  
reported recently (FIG. 4B). Although kK3 mainly resides in  
the ER, it has been shown to ubiquitylate post-ER (endo-  
glycosidase H resistant) MHC class I heavy chains ${ }^{128,129}$.  
Interestingly, the induction of efficient internalization  
from the plasma membrane requires polyubiquitylation  
of the tail of MHC class I molecules by two sequentially  
acting ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes ${ }^{130}$. The result is  
the generation of lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains  
on MHC class I molecules that signal their rapid endo-  
cytosis and lysosomal degradation (BOX 1). This kK3-  
mediated internalization of cell surface MHC class I  
molecules is clathrin dependent and involves epsin 1  
and TSG101 (tumour susceptibility gene 101) ${ }^{129,130}$.  
Both epsin 1 and TSG101 have ubiquitin-binding  
domains and they sequentially promote internalization  
and trafficking of MHC class I molecules from the cell  
surface to multivesicular bodies and lysosomes. The  
dissection of the kK3 pathway of MHC class I ubiqui-  
tylation, trafficking and degradation provides a conceptual  
paradigm with which to study the function of the cellular  
MARCH proteins in the regulation of MHC class II  
expression. Indeed, overexpression of various MARCH  
proteins also results in downregulation of MHC class I  
molecules, CD4, ICAM1, CD86, CD95 (also known  
as FAS) and transferrin receptor, suggesting overlapping  
substrates with kK5. Unexpectedly, the fate of  
kK5 substrates other than MHC class I molecules is  
not always lysosomal degradation. For example, in cell  
lines expressing kK5, a fraction of newly synthesized  
CD31 is ubiquitylated in the ER and degraded by the  
proteasome ${ }^{131}$. This finding is reminiscent of mK3-  
induced ERAD and raises the intriguing possibility  
that other kK5 substrates are targeted for degradation.  
It should also be noted that kK5 downregulation of  
cell surface MICA expression does not involve ER or  
lysosomal degradation ${ }^{126}$.

Nef. The HIV-1 protein Nef evades CTL detection by  
downregulating the expression of MHC class I mol-  
ecules ${ }^{132,133}$ (FIG. 1). However, Nef has a more pleiotropic  
effect on HIV-1 infection by also altering the sorting  
of several immune molecules, including MHC class I  
and II molecules, CD4, CD28 and DC-specific ICAM3-  
grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) ${ }^{134-137}$. The Nef-  
induced downregulation of its receptor, CD4, prevents  
superinfection and optimizes viral particle produc-  
tion ${ }^{138,139}$. Interestingly, Nef disrupts the trafficking of  
MHC class I molecules and CD4 by different mecha-  
nisms. Nef induces the internalization of CD4 after  
it has reached the cell surface, but it uses the clathrin  
adaptor AP1 (adaptor protein 1) to divert the traffick-  
ing of MHC class I molecules directly from the trans  
Golgi network to an endocytic compartment before  
they reach the cell surface ${ }^{140}$; murine cytomegalovirus  
protein gp48 may similarly alter the trafficking of MHC  
class I molecules ${ }^{141}$. Despite this disparate Nef-induced  
sorting, both CD4 and MHC class I molecules end up  
in the same multivesicular bodies, ultimately leading to  
their degradation in lysosomes ${ }^{142}$. So, similarly to other  
immune evasion proteins, Nef continues to provide  
new insights into the membrane trafficking machinery  
of host cells. It is also intriguing that Nef can disrupt  
the expression of multiple substrates using different  
mechanisms, similarly to the KSHV protein kK5.

### Conclusions

There has been great progress in recent years in characterizing the events underlying antigen processing  
and presentation, and in elucidating specialized functions of the components of the PLC. To date, many  
fundamental questions of basic events of this pathway remain unanswered. This Review highlights how  
studying viral inhibitors of components of the MHC class I presentation pathway can provide insights into  
uncharacterized aspects of antigen processing and presentation. As discussed, these viral immune evasion  
proteins have also adapted to selectively modulate intracellular sorting pathways that regulate the expression  
levels of MHC class I molecules and to ensure that peptide binding occurs in the correct compartment. The  
viruses that interfere with these pathways are clinically relevant pathogens, adding to the importance of  
characterizing the mechanisms by which they block cellular functions.
