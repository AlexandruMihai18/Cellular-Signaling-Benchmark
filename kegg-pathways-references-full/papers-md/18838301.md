In mammals, the gut is populated with an extremely dense and diverse bacterial community. One response following intestinal colonization is the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) A by B cells present in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the sites, mechanisms, and functions of intestinal IgA synthesis. We discuss here the pathways leading to IgA production, in organized structures as well as nonorganized tissues, by T-dependent as well as T-independent mechanisms. In addition, we discuss new insights into the role of gut IgA in the regulation of bacterial communities and maintenance of immune homeostasis.

Introduction

In humans, the gastrointestinal tract is thought to harbor an extraordinarily dense (~10¹⁴ bacterial cells) and complex (~500–1000 species) community of microorganisms [1]. Adaptive co-evolution has led to the establishment of commensal and symbiotic relationships between gut bacteria and their mammalian hosts. The normal functioning of our physiology appears to be largely dependent on this bacterial community present in the gut (also see the article by Nanno in this issue). For example, commensals provide metabolic traits such as the ability to break down otherwise indigestible dietary components, they serve as a natural defense by competing for growth with pathogens and they help shape the character of the immune system [2]. To ensure symbiosis and to prevent inflammation, the host has developed highly sophisticated and efficient defense mechanisms.

Gut epithelium plays a critical role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, by sensing bacterial products through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and secreting cytokines that reinforce the epithelial barrier and regulate the local immune responses [3]. Upon bacterial stimulation, specialized crypt epithelium called Paneth cells, secrete antimicrobial products, such as defensins, angiogenins and RegIIIγ, that protect epithelial stem cells and probably regulate the composition of luminal bacteria [4,5] (also see the article by Canny and colleagues in this issue).

A prominent response of the immune system that follows microbial colonization of the gut is the production of IgA by immune cells present in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Indeed, in humans, ~40–60 mg/kg of IgA is produced daily by plasma cells located in the lamina propria (LP) of intestinal villi. The IgA is transported across the epithelium, and secreted into the gut lumen,

where it is thought to provide protection against bacterial, parasitic and viral mucosal pathogens (reviewed in [6]). In this review, we summarize recent advances on the function and regulation of IgA synthesis in mice as well as how complex interactions between immune cells and bacteria can lead to the formation of new lymphoid structures in the gut.

Development of organized GALT structures

The major sites for generation of intestinal IgA are represented by the organized lymphoid structures present in the wall of the small and large intestine. Some of these structures, like Peyer’s patches (PPs), develop during embryogenesis, whereas other lymphoid tissues called isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), develop early after birth following bacterial colonization of the intestine [7–9] (also see the article by Kiyono and colleagues in this issue).

Formation of PPs

Peyer’s patches are large structures built on a stromal cell (SC) scaffold, composed of several B cell follicles separated by areas containing T cells and dendritic cells (DCs). Formation of PPs requires multiple interactions between hematopoietic cells and SCs, in a precise time-window during embryogenesis [7,8] (Figure 1a). A recent study identified the tyrosine kinase receptor RET as a key regulator of PP organogenesis [10]. RET signaling seems to be involved in initiating the events leading to production of lymphotoxin (LT) β by hematopoietic CD4⁺CD3⁺IL7Rα⁺c-kit⁺CD11c⁺ cells. The interaction between these CD4⁺CD3⁺IL7Rα⁺c-kit⁺CD11c⁺RET⁺ cells and SCs through LT-LTβR axis leads to the attraction of CD4⁺CD3⁺IL7Rα⁺c-kit⁺ lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells into the PP anlagen [10]. The development of LTi cells depends on two transcription factors: the inhibitory helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor Id2 and the retinoic-related orphan receptor RORγt [11,12]. Stimulation of LTi cells through IL7Rα triggers upregulation of LTα1β2 [13]. Several positive feedback loops that involve chemokines and adhesion molecules, such as CXCR5-CXCL13 and integrin α₄β₇-VCAM1, are also necessary for PP formation [14,15]. Accordingly, the lack of LTi cells (i.e. in Id2⁻/⁻ or RORγt⁻/⁻ mice) or deficiency of the key molecules LTα, LTβ, LTβR, IL7Rα or CXCL13 results in the lack or a severe reduction of PPs [7,8,11,12,15].

Formation of ILFs

Isolated lymphoid follicles develop only after birth, from smaller ‘anlagen’ structures called cryptopatches (CPs)

Figure 1. Organogenesis of gut associated lymphoid tissue: generation of Peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles. (a) Formation of PPs during embryogenesis. The interaction between CD4⁺CD3⁻IL7R⁺c-kit⁺CD11c⁺RET⁺ (RET) cells and SCs through the LT-LTβR axis leads to the recruitment of CD4⁺CD3⁻IL7R⁺c-kit⁺RORγt⁺ LTi cells by an as yet unknown mediator into the PP anlagen. IL-7, most probably produced by the activated SCs, triggers upregulation of LTα1β2 on LTi cells. The aggregation of LTα1β2high LTi cells induces a cascade of events by LT-dependent stimulation of SC through the LTβR and NIK signaling. This results in upregulation of adhesion molecules like VCAM 1 on the SCs and enhanced production of chemokines that recruit more LTi, DCs, B and T cells in a positive feedback loop. Finally, the cells recruited into the anlagen reorganize to form an organized follicular structure, with distinct B cell and T cell zones. (b) Postnatal formation of CPs and ILFs. In general, CPs contain CD4⁺CD3⁺IL7R⁺c-kit⁺RORγt⁺ LTi cells that interact with SCs through LTβR. Similar to the PP anlagen, this interaction leads to activation of SCs and production of adhesion molecules and chemokines, involved mainly in the recruitment of MΦ-DCs. After bacterial colonization of the intestine, CPs receive signals from gut bacteria in the form of PAMPs, most likely through the activated MΦ-DCs. Concomitant signals from LTi cells through LTβR and bacteria through TLRs further augments the activation of SCs, leading to recruitment of B and T cells and organization of a mature ILF.

CPs were recognized as clusters of RORγt-expressing LTi cells and DCs, in which B and T cells are recruited to form ILFs [18, 19]. It was initially reported that the generation of CPs is dependent on the presence of RORγt⁺ LTi cells. However, a recent study revealed that RORγt-deficient mice could develop few CPs under certain conditions (i.e. in nu/nu mice) [20]. Thus, the identification of cellular component(s) for the formation of CPs requires further study. ILFs are composed of a single discrete cluster of B cells built around SCs, surrounded by a large number of DCs, and a few T cells interspersed between the B cells [9, 18, 21]. Formation of ILFs clearly depends on the presence of RORγt⁺ LTi cells and their interaction with SCs through the LTα1β2-LTβR axis [22]. Thus, Id2⁻/⁻, RORγt⁻/⁻, LTα⁻/⁻, LTβ⁻/⁻, LTβR⁻/⁻, and aly/aly mice (which have impaired signaling downstream of the LTβR), do not develop ILFs [8, 9, 18, 23, 24].

The development of ILFs requires stimulation by commensal intestinal bacteria (Figure 1b). The size and cellular composition of ILFs are highly variable, and dependent on the bacterial load in the intestine [17, 23, 25]. For example, hyperplasia of ILFs correlates with the expansion of anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine of mice that lack hyper-mutated IgA [25]. Thus,

in sharp contrast to the formation of PPs during embryogenesis, RORγt⁺ LTi-SC interactions are not sufficient alone to elicit the robust recruitment of lymphocytes to the gut, which is necessary to drive the development of CPs into ILFs. Clearly, ILF formation requires multiple cell types, including RORγt⁺ LTi cells, LTβR and LTβR-expressing SCs, as well as the presence of bacteria. But how do bacteria influence these cellular interactions that lead to organization of CPs into ILFs? What is the role of bacteria in activation of both immune cells and SCs? We recently found that activation of SCs by their interaction with RORγt⁺ LTi cells is augmented in the presence of bacterial products signaling through SC TLRs [22]. For example, the production of adhesion molecules and cytokines, like Mad-CAM-1, CCL19, CXCL13, and CCL20, was significantly enhanced by concomitant stimulation of SCs with RORγt⁺ LTi cells and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Thus, we propose that simultaneous signals from bacteria and RORγt⁺ LTi cells induce activation of SCs that is sufficient for recruitment of significant numbers of DCs and B cells to CPs and result in the formation of ILFs [22] (Figure 1b). Besides LT-LTβR interactions, there might be additional mediators of communication between RORγt⁺ LTi cells and SCs. RORγt⁺ LTi cells present in adult gut likely interact with SCs also through TNFα-LTα-TNFRI. However, this

In sharp contrast, the expression of AID is abundant in PP follicles of WT mice and absent in PP follicles of TCRβ⁻/⁻δ⁻/⁻ mice.

axis might be relevant not for the initial activation of SCs, but rather at later stages involving the recruitment of B cells and maturation of ILFs [19,23].

### Generation of IgA-producing B cells in PPs

#### Germinal center induction

Many of the PP lymphocytes are activated cells residing in germinal centers (GCs). GCs are special microenvironments that allow interactions between B cells, antigens trapped on SCs called follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and a specialized lymphocyte population called follicular helper T cells (T<sub>FH</sub>) [26]. In conventionally reared mice (i.e. those possessing a complex gut microflora), GCs are continuously present in PPs and in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) draining the gut, and the majority of the precursors for IgA plasma cells are generated in this environment [27,28]. Certainly, most GC B cells are activated cells, expressing activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a molecule that is critical for class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) [29,30] (Figure 2). Formation of GCs in PPs seems to be an antigen-specific reaction, rather than just a polyclonal B cell expansion triggered by the stimulation through innate receptors, such as TLR2 and TLR4. Indeed, GCs diminish with time in the PPs of germ-free mice that were colonized with a single defined microorganism such as Morganella morganii and segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), even though the microorganisms persisted in the gut lumen [28]. Furthermore, GCs are absent in the PPs and the MLNs of T cell-deficient (i.e. TCRβ⁻/⁻δ⁻/⁻) mice [27,30,31] (Figure 2). Recent studies emphasize the importance of T<sub>FH</sub> cells for the induction and activation of GCs [26,32]. The unique positioning of T<sub>FH</sub> cells in the FDC network of GCs is determined by the high expression of CXCR5 and low expression of CCR7 on these activated T cells [33,34]. T<sub>FH</sub> cells express high levels of CD40L, inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) and IL-21, molecules critically associated with helper functions [26]. Thus, as depicted in Figure 3a, activation of B cells and class switching to IgA within the PP requires bacterial antigens and conventional T-B cell interactions. However, studies of knock-in mice for LMP2A, a membrane protein encoded by Epstein-Barr virus that acts as a B cell receptor (BCR) surrogate, apparently challenged this view [27]. Surprisingly, GCs developed in PPs and MLN of LMP2A mice in the absence of antigen-specific recognition through BCRs and thus in the absence of cognate T-B interaction. The development of GCs in these mice was dependent on the presence of gut bacteria and T cell help. This unexpected finding led to a model where the mucosal B cells are activated to form GCs independent of BCR specificity, through the interaction of TLRs, such as TLR9 and TLR4 on B cells with bacterial components [27] (Figure 3a). Recent findings that TLR stimulation of B cells enhances MyD88-dependent antibody production support this model [35].

#### Preferential generation of IgA⁺ B cells in the GC of PPs

In PPs, most of the GC B cells preferentially switch from IgM⁺ to IgA⁺. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this predominant IgA production are still unclear. Accumulating evidence indicates that PP DCs critically contribute to creating a special gut microenvironment. The unique function of DCs in PPs might be related to their location in the subepithelial dome (SED), where they directly access luminal bacteria, some of them

Figure 3. Pathways for generation of IgA in gut. (a) T-dependent generation of IgA⁺ cells in the GCs of PPs. DCs located beneath M cells take up luminal bacteria and migrate to the interfollicular T cell zone. Activated CD4 T cells express CXCR5 and migrate toward CXCL13 into the FDC network, where they provide help for activated B cells. Conventional B-T interactions through MHC II-TCR and CD40-CD40L are critical for activation of B cells, their induction of AID and subsequent CSR and SHM. Preferential generation of IgA⁺ cells in the PPs is due to the abundant production of activated TGFβ1 in this environment. Alternatively, B cells can be activated in the absence of cognate B-T interactions, through TLR engagement. This might represent an evolutionarily primitive system for Ig production in which B cells express AID upon stimulation through TLRs and undergo CSR to IgA⁺ cells in the gut environment [68]. (b) Unlike within the follicles of PPs, generation of IgA⁺ cells within ILFs does not absolutely require the help of T cells. TNFα is abundantly produced by TNFα and iNOS-producing DCs and also by LTi cells. Upon TNFα stimulation, SCs and DCs express high levels of MMPs, which mediate conversion of TGFβ1 from its inactive to active form. Together with BAFF and APRIL produced by iNOS⁺ DC, active TGFβ1 facilitates preferential switching of TLR-activated B cells from IgM to IgA. c. IgM⁺ B cells in gut LP are activated by polyclonal stimuli or by antigens presented by LP DCs. In the presence of TGFβ1, BAFF and APRIL (the latter produced also by epithelial cells upon bacterial or TSLP stimulation), activated B cells expressing AID undergo preferential switching to IgA. Factors produced by SCs and gut DCs (IL-6, IL-10, BAFF and APRIL) facilitate differentiation of B cells into IgA secreting plasma cells.

coated by secretory IgA [36]. Indeed, the epithelium that covers PPs contains M cells, special cells that are considered to be the major site of antigen entry to the mucosa [37]. Not only do DCs participate in local IgA induction within PPs, but also PP DCs loaded with bacteria and migrating into MLNs have been shown to direct preferential CSR to IgA in vitro [38]. PP T cells are also conditioned by gut DCs to produce cytokines such as TGFβ1, which together with IL-6, IL-10, and retinoic acid (RA) produced by DCs themselves, facilitate preferential CSR of B cells from IgM to IgA [39–42].

Generation of IgA⁺ B cells in ILFs

Similar to PPs, the epithelium that covers mature ILFs contains M cells capable of taking up pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium and GC can be detected in many mature ILFs [9,25,43,44]. Recently we found that regardless of the presence or absence of GCs, many ILF B cells are actively undergoing class switching from IgM⁺ to IgA⁺ in situ [22]. Unexpectedly, we found that, unlike the T cell-

dependent processes in the follicles of PPs, B cell activation, induction of AID, and generation of precursors for IgA plasma cells within ILFs do not require the help of T cells (Figure 2). Thus, ILFs represent a unique compartment that contributes significantly to IgA synthesis in gut even in the absence of T cells and GCs.

How are B cells activated in ILFs and what factors direct their switching from IgM to IgA even in the absence of T cells or GCs? The ILF DCs alone appear to be sufficient for activation of B cells [22]. First, unlike DCs in spleen or lymph nodes, gut macrophage (Mo)-DCs express abundant TNFα following activation with bacteria, and TNFα and iNOS-producing DCs were recently found to be required for IgA production in gut [45]. Second, gut Mo-DCs uniquely express high levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP13, two MMPs that were shown to mediate activation of TGFβ1 [22]. Third, gut Mo-DCs and gut SCs secrete two additional factors, B cell activating factor of the tumor-necrosis factor family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), that are known to enhance

CSR to IgA independent of T cell help [45–47]. We propose that ILF B cells that are activated either directly by LPS or after antigen presentation by TNFα-expressing Mφ-DCs undergo preferential class switching to IgA, through the influence of TGFβ1, BAFF and APRIL even in the absence of T cells (Figure 3b). IgA⁺B cells or IgA plasmablasts generated within ILFs would then undergo differentiation to IgA plasma cells in the LP, with the help of IL-6, IL-10, BAFF and APRIL secreted by the SCs, T cells and DCs located in the LP.

### Generation of IgA in LP

Previous studies have indicated that IgA plasma cells can be generated in the absence both of PPs and ILFs, by class switching of AID-expressing B cells from IgM⁺ to IgA⁺in situ in the LP [24, 48]. This was suggested by the presence of several molecular markers, such as Ca germline transcripts and AID, in IgM⁺B cells located in LP. Furthermore, footprints for recent switching (like α circle transcripts, which are initiated from the Ia promoter located in the circular DNA that is looped out during class switching to IgA) could be detected in LP IgA⁺B cells. However, other studies failed to detect these markers in LP, although they were clearly detected in PPs and ILFs [49–51]. These contradictory results suggest that the efficiency of CSR to IgA⁺cells in LP might be low in normal mice (i.e. in the presence of PPs and ILFs), and that the interpretation of results depends on the experimental procedures (e.g. whether purification of B cells were performed or not). However, recent studies using alternative approaches, such as in situ staining of AID and AID reporter mice, confirmed that B cells located in the gut LP are activated AID expressing cells undergoing CSR to IgA [30, 47, 52].

How are LP B cells activated for in situ CSR? Recent studies presented evidence that the epithelium covering the intestinal villi also contain M cells, capable of taking up particulate antigens from the gut lumen [53, 54]. In addition, DCs located within the gut epithelium or in the LP, extend dendrites through the tight junctions of the epithelium and sample luminal antigens directly (Figure 3c) [55, 56]. Activated DCs might be sufficient to induce CSR in LP B cells, even in the absence of T cells, through a pathway that involves the engagement of BAFF receptors. In humans, it was demonstrated that interactions between bacteria, epithelial cells and DCs induce T-independent and CD40-independent CSR of LP B cells, through BAFF and APRIL [46, 47]. The gut epithelium itself was found to produce APRIL upon stimulation through TLRs. Furthermore, activated gut epithelium also secretes thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which enhances production of APRIL and IL-10 from local TNFα and iNOS-producing DCs, thus augmenting CSR [45, 47]. Collectively these observations indicate that the LP is a site where T-independent IgA responses are triggered by intestinal bacteria (Figure 3c).

### Migration of B cells to the LP

#### Migration of IgA⁺B cells from PPs to LP

In addition to facilitating preferential generation of IgA⁺B cells, the PP microenvironment ‘imprints’ lymphocytes with gut-seeking properties [24, 42] (also see the article by Agace in this issue). As mentioned above, DCs present in PPs generate RA, which was recently found to induce upregulation of gut-homing receptors such as CCR9 and αβ₇on T cells and B cells [42, 57] (Figure 4a). The emigration of IgA plasmablasts from PPs appears to involve the type-1 sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor [58]. Thus, IgA⁺B cells or IgA plasmablasts from the PPs migrate to the draining MLN, and via the thoracic duct and blood, home back to the gut. This migration of B cells also involves the αβ₇ integrin and interaction with the mucosal addressin MadCAM-1, expressed by the postcapillary venules in the gut LP [24]. The preferential location of IgA plasma-blasts in the gut LP is explained by their high expression of CCR9 and CCR10, the receptors for the chemokines TECK (CCL25) and MEC (CCL28) expressed by the epithelium of the small and large intestine, respectively [59].

#### Migration of IgM⁺B cells to the LP

Not only IgA⁺B cells, but also activated IgM⁺B cells from the PPs migrate to the LP (Figure 4a). Migration of gut-activated B cells appears to be independent of LTβR signaling through NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase) in the gut SCs. This is supported by the observation that IgM⁺B cells from PP or naïve BM B cells that had been allowed to experience a normal gut environment (after short-term parabiosis of BM reconstituted aly/aly with RAG2⁻/⁻mice) can migrate to LP of aly/aly mice [24]. In contrast to gut-activated B cells, stimulation of gut SCs through LTβR seems to be crucial for the presence of naïve IgM⁺B cells in gut LP (Figure 4b). Indeed, LTα⁻/⁻, LTβR⁻/⁻and aly/aly mice lack B cells in the LP and have no IgA plasma cells in the gut [24, 60]. Reconstitution of aly/aly mice with normal BM cells fails to restore the number of B cells and IgA plasma cells in the gut, unless co-injected with normal gut SCs [24]. RORγt⁺LTi cells might provide LT and initiate LT-LTβR interactions required for direct recruitment of naïve B cells in adult intestine.

#### Migration of peritoneal B1 cells to gut LP

Another source of B cells that contributes to the generation of intestinal IgA plasma cells is the peritoneal cavity, which harbors a special type of B cell called the B1 cell. Peritoneal B1 cells express high levels of surface IgM and low levels of IgD and B220. In addition to CD11b (Mac-1), peritoneal B1 cells express high levels of α₄, α₆, and β₁integrins and CD9, a tetraspanin that associates with other surface molecules, like integrin β₁or α₆, and regulates cell motility [61]. These phenotypic properties are likely acquired in the peritoneal environment [62]. Intestinal lesions induced by acute gut inflammation or direct stimulation of peritoneal B1 cells by bacteria or by bacterial products (such as LPS or Pam2CSK), induce a significant egress of B1 cells from the peritoneum, and their re-localization to effector tissues, i.e. gut LP [61] (Figure 4c). The molecular mechanism contributing to TLR-induced mobilization of B1 cells from the peritoneal cavity involves a coordinated down-regulation of integrins and tetraspanin CD9, and activation of G-protein coupled receptors [61] (Figure 4c). Like the IgA responses generated in the ILFs, IgA production by B1 cells seems to be T

Figure 4. Migration of IgA⁺ and IgM⁺ B cells to the gut LP. (a) The PP microenvironment imprints naïve BM-derived IgM⁺ B cells with gut-seeking properties. PP's DCs, through their production of RA, facilitate upregulation of integrin α₄β₇ and CCR9, two major gut-homing receptors, on both IgA⁺ B cells and IgM⁺ B cells. MAdCAM-1, the ligand for integrin α₄β₇, is expressed by the postcapillary venules in the LP, whereas CCL25, the ligand for CCR9, is produced by the gut epithelial cells. Migration of gut-experienced B cells does not require LTβR signaling through NIK in gut SC. (b) Naïve BM-derived IgM⁺ B cells, expressing integrin α₄β₁ and CXCR5 directly migrate to the LP. However, their migration and retention in the LP requires activation of SC through LTβR and NIK. RORγt⁺LTi cells present in the LP of intestinal villi might provide LTβR ligands necessary for activation of SC, independent of the bacterial stimulation [69]. (c) Peritoneal cavity B1 cells upon activation through TLRs also migrate to the LP. Retention of B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity is due to their high expression levels of integrins (α₄β₁, α₆β₁) associating with the tetraspanin CD9, which facilitate a stable B1 cell attachment to local tissue matrix (VCAM1). Signals through TLRs induced by bacteria or bacterial components facilitate detachment of B1 cells through downregulation

cell independent [31]. This was shown in lethally irradiated T cell-deficient mice, reconstituted with allotype-marked B1 cells together with host-derived BM cells; most IgA plasma cells were derived from the peritoneal B1 cells [31].

### Biological relevance of IgA for gut homeostasis

The generally accepted view is that IgA secreted into the intestinal lumen limits the access of bacteria to the region below the intestinal epithelial surface [63]. Indeed, secretory IgA was shown to limit penetration of colonizing bacteria through the neonatal intestinal epithelium [64]. Interestingly, this process did not require diversification of the natural antibody repertoire. For example, the nonmutated nitrophenol-specific IgAs produced in young quasi-monoclonal mice, were sufficient to limit penetration of the commensal *Enterobacter cloacae* [84]. Similarly, in adult mice, the presence of secretory IgA limits the translocation of aerobic bacteria from the intestinal lumen to the MLN [38]. The protective role of natural antibodies is likely due to their high level of cross-reactivity with bacterial antigens. IgA might not function only in the exclusion of immune complexes, but also to enhance local immune responses by delivering IgA-coated bacteria to M cells located either in the PPs and ILFs and perhaps M cells located between villus epithelial cells [65].

Our studies in AID-deficient mice demonstrated that secretory IgAs are critical for regulating bacterial communities in the gut lumen. The absence of IgAs in the lumen of AID⁻/⁻ mice leads to an excessive anaerobic expansion in all segments of the small intestine [25]. Among the expanded anaerobes, SFB are commonly predominant [28, 66]. These bacteria were found to strongly stimulate the generation of gut IgA after colonization of germ-free mice, and most of the induced IgA was not specific to the bacteria [28]. The change in microbial ecology in the gut causes excessive activation not only of mucosal immune cells (causing for example hyperplasia of ILFs), but also systemic activation of lymphocytes (induction of GCs and hypertrophy of all lymphoid tissues). If the nonspecific antibodies are sufficient to regulate gut bacteria, what is the role of specific IgA in the gut? A recent study provided evidence that secretory IgA promotes the establishment of host-microbial relationships by modulating bacterial epitopes and adaptation of bacterial metabolism (downregulation of bacterial genes involved in the metabolism of oxidative products) [67]. It was demonstrated that *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron* elicits fewer proinflammatory signals in the small intestine in the presence of a specific gut IgA for capsular polysaccharide CPS4. Interestingly, the specific anti-CPS4 IgA response induces expression by bacteria of another capsular locus (CPS5). It is thus possible that the adaptive immune system (through IgA) is maintaining the 'dialog' with gut microbiota by generating a selective response to bacteria that stimulate the immune system. Thus, IgA is not only required to downmodulate or block the ability of bacteria to induce inflammation, but the adaptive immune system apparently

of integrin-CD9 complexes. CD9 modulation and activation of G-protein coupled receptors (like CXCR5) enhance cell motility through extracellular matrix, transmigration across the vascular endothelium, and migration (in part through the omentum) and into the LP. Because of their rapid mobilization and differentiation into Ig-producing cells, peritoneal B1 cells are designated as 'natural memory' B cells [70].

### Conclusions

Recent findings have revealed new complexities in the mechanisms and functions of IgA in the gut. However, more studies are required to understand the host-bacterial interactions in the gut. We still know very little about the bacterial communities in the intestine, how these communities adapt to different environmental conditions in distinct segments of the intestine, what their impact is on host physiology, and how such bacteria are sensed by the immune system. We have only just begun to understand the role of specific versus nonspecific IgA in the gut. Similarly, more data need to be acquired on IgA generation in organized structures (PP, ILF) and nonorganized tissues (LP), by T-dependent (PP, ILF) and T-independent (ILF, LP) mechanisms, and the requirements for activation of DCs, SCs, B cells, and T cells that induce neo-lymphogenesis (i.e., ILFs formation from CPs) in the gut. These are just a few of the questions whose answers will help to develop new strategies for mucosal vaccines and novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of gut autoimmune inflammatory diseases.
