Serine/threonine kinase IKBKE is a newly identified oncogene; however, its regulation remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence that IKBKE is a downstream target of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and that tobacco components induce IKBKE expression through STAT3. Ectopic expression of constitutively active STAT3 increased IKBKE mRNA and protein levels, whereas inhibition of STAT3 reduced IKBKE expression. Furthermore, expression levels of IKBKE are significantly associated with STAT3 activation and tobacco use history in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients examined. In addition, we show induction of IKBKE by two components of cigarette smoke, nicotine and nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK). Upon exposure to nicotine or NNK, cells express high levels of IKBKE protein and mRNA, which are largely abrogated by inhibition of STAT3. Characterization of the *IKBKE* promoter revealed two STAT3-response elements. The *IKBKE* promoter directly bound to STAT3 and responded to nicotine and NNK stimulation. Notably, enforcing expression of IKBKE induces chemoresistance, whereas knockdown of IKBKE not only sensitizes NSCLC cells to chemotherapy but also abrogates STAT3- and nicotine-induced cell survival. These data indicate for the first time that IKBKE is a direct target of STAT3 and is induced by tobacco carcinogens through STAT3 pathway. In addition, our study also suggests that IKBKE is an important therapeutic target and could have a pivotal role in tobacco-associated lung carcinogenesis.

### INTRODUCTION

The serine/threonine kinase IKBKE (also called IKKε and IKKi) is a non-canonical IkB kinase family member and regulates immune response.¹,² In response to inflammatory factor and viral infection, IKBKE is activated and subsequently phosphorylates interferon response factors 3 and 7 (IRF3 and IRF7) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)²⁻⁵ as well as induces phosphorylation of p65/RelA.⁶,⁷ Activated IKEKE also regulates CYLD,⁸ which is a deubiquitinase of several nuclear factor (NF)-κB regulators, including tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2, 6 (TRAF2, TRAF6) and NEMO (IKK-γ), to activate the canonical NF-κB pathway.⁹⁻¹¹ We and others have recently demonstrated IKBKE direct phosphorylation of Akt-Thr308/Ser473,¹²,¹³ leading to activation of Akt independent of PI3K, PDK1, mTORC2 and PH domain of Akt.¹² IKBKE has been shown to be frequently overexpressed in human malignancy.¹⁴ The potential role for IKBKE in breast cancer was first shown by Sonenshein and her colleagues who demonstrated that IKBKE was overexpressed in breast cancer cells lines, four of six breast carcinomas patients and carcinogen-induced mouse mammary tumors.¹⁵ Subsequently, elevated levels of IKBKE were detected in prostate cancer cell lines.⁶ Recent studies have shown that *IKBKE* is amplified/overexpressed in primary breast and ovarian cancers, with more frequent protein overexpression than DNA amplification,⁶,¹⁶,¹⁷ suggesting that IKBKE is regulated by aberrant transcription. However, IKBKE has not been associated with environmental carcinogenesis to date.

STAT3 is a transcription factor and has a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis.¹⁸,¹⁹ It has been well documented that STAT3 is activated by cytokine,

growth factor and environmental carcinogenesis such as nicotine.²⁰ Many studies have also shown that diverse oncoproteins, such as viral Src oncoprotein, ETK/BMX and an oncogenic form of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), activate STAT3.¹⁸,²¹,²² In response to extra- and intra-cellular signals, STAT3 is phosphorylated at tyrosine-705, which leads to STAT3 dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where it binds to DNA and transcriptionally regulates a number of genes such as cyclin D1, bcl-xl, Mcl-1 and c-myc.²³⁻²⁶ Furthermore, STAT3 is frequently activated in a various types of human cancer and is required for cell transformation.¹⁸,²⁷

In the current study, we demonstrated that IKBKE is a STAT3 target gene. STAT3 transcriptionally induces IKBKE expression. We also showed the co-expression of pSTAT3 and IKBKE in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens and association of elevated IKBKE with smoking. Furthermore, protein and mRNA levels of IKBKE were induced by tobacco components nicotine and NNK. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrated that nicotine-induced IKBKE primarily depends upon STAT3. Enforcing expression of IKBKE induces chemoresistance and knockdown of IKBKE sensitizes cells to chemotherapy and abrogates STAT3- and nicotine-induced cell survival.

### RESULTS

STAT3 increases IKBKE expression at mRNA and protein levels While the *IKBKE* locus chromosome 1q32.1 is amplified, overexpression of IKBKE at mRNA and/or protein levels is much common than its change at DNA level in human malignancies.¹⁴,¹⁶,²⁸ These prompted us to examine transcriptional regula-

tion of IKBKE. Using 5′ race and EST (expression sequence tag)  
database analysis, we defined transcription start site of the *IKBKE*  
and isolated a 2.5-kb *IKBKE* promoter including intron 1 and exon 1,  
which does not encode IKBKE protein. Transcriptional element  
analysis (http://www.genome.jp/tools/motif/) revealed 7 STAT3-  
binding sites (Supplementary Figure S1). Because frequent  
activation of STAT3 has been detected in NSCLC,²⁹,³⁰ we  
investigated if modulation of STAT3 will affect IKBKE expression.  
Figure 1a shows pSTAT3 and IKBKE levels in 15 NSCLC cell lines  
examined. As H292 cells highly express pSTAT3 and IKBKE, we  
treated the cells with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-STAT3 and STAT3  
inhibitor JSI-124, and observed considerable decrease of IKBKE  
protein and mRNA levels following inhibition of STAT3 (Figures 1b  
and c). These findings were further confirmed by treatment of  

H157 and OVCAR-3 cells with STAT3 inhibitor and STAT3 shRNAs  
(Supplementary Figure S2). Conversely, ectopic expression of  
constitutively active STAT3 (STAT3-C) resulted in increase of IKBKE  
protein and mRNA in A549 cells in which endogenous pSTAT3 and  
IKBKE are low (Figures 1a and d). We also observed that IKBKE level  
was elevated in A549 cells following expression of v-Src, especially  
co-expression of STAT3 and v-Src (Figure 1d), and treatment with  
IL6 (interleukin 6) (Figure 1e), two major STAT3 activators.¹⁸,³¹  
These findings suggest that STAT3 upregulates IKBKE.

**Figure 2.** STAT3 binds to and transactivates the *IKBKE* promoter. (a) The *IKBKE* promoter is activated by STAT3. A549 cells were transfected with IKBKE-Luc, β-galactosidase and various forms of STAT3. After incubation for 36 h, luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase. Results are mean ± s.e. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. (b) Diagram of a 2.1-kb *IKBKE* promoter and its deletion mutants based on putative STAT3-response elements. (c) The response elements 2 and 3 are required for STAT3 activation of the *IKBKE* promoter. Luciferase assay was performed as (a), with deletion mutants of *IKBKE* promoter. (d) STAT3 directly binds to the *IKBKE* promoter. A549 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and ChIP assay was performed as described under 'Materials and methods'. STAT3 antibody was used for ChIP. ChIP with actin antibody was served as a negative control. The DNA before the immunoprecipitation was used as a positive control (input). (e) Mutation of STAT3-binding sites abrogated STAT3-stimulated *IKBKE* promoter activity. Two STAT3-binding sites were mutated individually and in combination (TT–GG; left). Luciferase reporter assay was performed as described above (right).

revealed that constitutively active but not dominant-negative STAT3 induces the promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2a). Since the *IKBKE* promoter contains seven putative STAT3-response elements, we next determine which STAT3-binding site(s) is required for response to STAT3. Deletion mutants of pGL3-*IKBKE* promoter were created based on the STAT3-response elements (Figure 2b). As shown in Figure 2c, removal of the first STAT3-binding site slightly increased basal and STAT3-induced promoter activity. However, after deletion of STAT3-binding sites 2 and 3, the promoter failed to respond to STAT3.

To determine if STAT3 directly binds to the STAT3-response elements within the *IKBKE* promoter in vivo, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, which detects specific genomic DNA sequences that are associated with a particular transcription factor in intact cells. A549 cells were transfected with STAT3-C and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with STAT3 antibody. The STAT3-bound chromatin was subjected to PCR using oligonucleotide primers that amplify region spanning STAT3-binding site within the *IKBKE* promoter (Figure 2b). In agreement with the findings from luciferase reporter assay, the STAT3 antibody only pulled down STAT3-binding sites 2 and 3 (Figure 2d). In contrast, immunoprecipitation with an irrelevant actin antibody resulted in the absence of bands

in these sites. Furthermore, knockdown of STAT3 in H292 cells, which express high levels of *IKBKE* and pSTAT3 (Figure 1), significantly decreased STAT3 binding to the *IKBKE* promoter (Supplementary Figure S3). To demonstrate if these two putative STAT3-binding sites are required for STAT3 transactivation of the *IKBKE* promoter, we have mutated them individually and in combination. As shown in Figure 2e, mutation of either site alone moderately reduced STAT3-stimulated *IKBKE* promoter activity, whereas the *IKBKE* promoter with both site mutations failed to respond to STAT3-C. Moreover, knockdown of STAT3 in H292 cells reduced basal wild type but not mutated *IKBKE* promoter activity (Supplementary Figure S4). These results indicate that STAT3 directly binds to the response elements 2 and 3 of the *IKBKE* promoter to transactivate *IKBKE*.

Overexpression of *IKBKE* correlates with STAT3 activation and is associated with smoking status in NSCLC

Having demonstrated that *IKBKE* is a STAT3 target gene in cell culture system, we asked if this regulation is seen in vivo. We examined 98 NSCLC samples for protein expression of *IKBKE* and pSTAT3 (Figures 3a and b). Of the 98 lung tumors, 54 had overexpression of *IKBKE* and 64 had activation of STAT3. Of the 64

(b) Immunohistochemistry was carried out with antibodies against IKBKE and pSTAT3-Y705. (c) χ² test analysis of IKBKE and pSTAT3 in 98 NSCLC specimens examined.

tumors with elevated pSTAT3, 42 (66%) also had elevated IKBKE levels (*P* = 0.006; Figure 3b). Immunohistochemistry of these tumor samples showed that the co-expression of IKBKE and pSTAT3 are located specifically to the cancer cells and not to the stroma (Figure 3c; Supplementary Figure S5). Furthermore, we found that the IKBKE overexpression is associated with patients' smoking history (*P* = 0.014; Figure 3d). These data suggest that there is a significant relationship of co-expression of IKBKE and pSTAT3, which further supports STAT3 regulation of IKBKE.

Nicotine and NNK induce IKBKE expression through STAT3 Tobacco smoke is the strongest documented tumor initiator and promoter for lung cancer.³²,³³ Of the components in tobacco, nicotine and NNK have been shown to activate multiple signaling pathways including Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and janus kinase (JAK)/STAT.³⁴⁻³⁷ Since overexpression of IKBKE is associated with smoking, we reasoned that IKBKE could be induced by nicotine and NNK. To test this, A549 cells were serum starved for 12 h and then treated with nicotine (1 μM) or NNK (1 μM) for different time points. Increase of IKBKE protein expression was observed as early as 6 h of the treatment (Figures 4a and c), whereas mRNA level of the *IKBKE* was elevated starting at 3 h (Figures 4b and d). We further confirmed these findings using an additional cell line H1299 (Supplementary Figure S6). In agreement with a previous report,³⁸ pSTAT3 but not total STAT3 is induced by nicotine and NNK in a pattern similar to IKBKE mRNA expression (Figures 4b and d).

We next examined if STAT3 mediates nicotine and NNK-induced IKBKE. A549 cells were transfected with shRNA of STAT3 or treated with STAT3 inhibitor before nicotine and NNK stimulation. The cells transfected with shRNA of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and treated with dimethyl sulfoxide were used as control. After

Ectopic expression of IKBKE induces chemoresistance and knockdown of IKBKE sensitizes NSCLC cells to apoptosis and reduces STAT3- and nicotine-induced cell survival

To evaluate if IKBKE is a therapeutic target in NSCLC, we ectopically expressed IKBKE in H661 cells, in which endogenous IKBKE is low (Figure 1a), and then treated the cells with various chemotherapeutic agents. The cells transfected with vector and treated with dimethyl sulfoxide were used as control. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and TUNEL assay showed that expression of IKBKE alone did not significantly induce cell survival as compared with vector-transfected cells (*P* = 0.7; left panels of Figure 6a). However, the cells transfected with IKBKE became resistance to cisplatin-, gemcitabine- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (Figure 6a). Furthermore, we infected endogenous

Following treatment with the indicated agents, A549 cells were subjected to ChIP assay.

IKBKE-high H292 cells with lentiviruses expressing shRNA-IKBKE or control shRNA and observed that basal level of apoptosis was not significantly affected by knockdown of IKBKE alone (P = 0.06) as compared with the cells treated with control shRNA. Yet, the depletion of IKBKE considerably sensitized the cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis (Figure 6b). These data suggest that IKBKE has a role in chemosensitivity in NSCLC.

Since IKBKE is upregulated by STAT3 and nicotine, we further investigated if STAT3- and nicotine-induced cell survival is mediated by IKBKE. A549 cells were transfected with constitutive active STAT3-C or were treated with nicotine together with and without shRNA-IKBKE. In agreement with previous studies, cells expressing STAT3-C or treated with nicotine became resistant to gemcitabine (Figure 6c). However, knockdown of IKBKE largely abrogates STAT3-C and nicotine protected cells from gemcitabine-induced cell death (Figure 6c). Furthermore, we examined the effect of IKBKE on nicotine-induced cell survival in two more IKBKE-low cell lines H1299 and H661. Figure 6d and Supplementary Figure S8 showed that nicotine protected both cell lines from the gemcitabine- and cisplatin-induced cell death

Figure 6. Enforcing expression of IKBKE induces chemoresistance whereas knockdown of IKBKE sensitizes NSCLC cells to chemotherapy and reduces anti-apoptotic function of STAT3- and nicotine. (a) Expression of IKBKE renders cells resistance to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. H661 cells expressing low endogenous IKBKE were transfected with IKBKE and then treated with the indicated agents (e.g., cisplatin 20 μM, gemcitabine 10 μM and doxorubicin 1.0 μM) for 36 h (top panel). Apoptosis was assayed by PARP cleavage (panel 2) and TUNEL (bottom panel). (b) Depletion of IKBKE enhances apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. IKBKE was knocked down in high-IKBKE H292 cells. After treatment with the indicated agents, the programmed cell death was evaluated by PARP cleavage and TUNEL assay for three times in triplicate. (c, d) STAT3- and nicotine-induced cell survival was largely abrogated by knockdown of IKBKE.

and that this protection was considerably reduced by knockdown of IKBKE. These results indicate that IKBKE is an important mediator of STAT3- and nicotine-induced cell survival and chemoresistance.

DISCUSSION  
Current treatments for NSCLC include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Patients with locally advanced disease that are surgically unresectable will be subjected to radiation and chemotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy improves the survival rate of NSCLC patients; however, the overall median 5-year survival rate is still only ~15%. The major reason is that the patients eventually develop chemoresistance and radioresistance. Therefore, there is an unmet need to understand molecular mechanism of the chemoresistance and radioreistance and further develop targeted therapy by identification new promising target(s). Activation of STAT3 is a common change in NSCLC and represents an attractive therapeutic target for anti-cancer drug discovery. Our study indicates that the IKBKE is a STAT3 target gene. STAT3 directly binds to the IKBKE promoter and induces IKBKE transcription. Co-expression of pSTAT3 and IKBKE was observed in primary NSCLCs. Ectopic expression of IKBKE induces chemoresistance and knockdown of IKBKE sensitizes NSCLC cells to chemotherapeutic agent-induced cell death and reduces STAT3-induced cell survival. These findings suggest that IKBKE could be an important therapeutic target in NSCLC.

The tobacco smoke is the strongest documented tumor initiator and promoter for lung cancer. Traditional models of tobacco-related tumorigenesis are genocentric, in that tobacco components promote carcinogenesis through a multistep processes that involve exposure to and activation of carcinogens such as NNK or polycyclic hydrocarbons, which leads to formation of DNA adducts and mutations in key genes such as K-ras, p53 or p16. Recent studies have shown that tobacco components can also promote lung tumorigenesis through modulation of signal transduction pathways that regulate cell proliferation, transformation and survival. For example, nicotine and NNK are potent agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which are expressed in lung epithelial cells and can activate multiple signaling cascades such as Akt/mTOR, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and janus kinase/STAT3 pathways. In the current study, we demonstrated that overexpression of IKBKE is associated with tobacco smoking and that IKBKE protein and mRNA levels are increased in response to nicotine and NNK. In addition, depletion of IKBKE reduces nicotine protection of NSCLC cells from apoptosis as well as nicotine-induced chemoresistance. Thus, we provide the evidence that

Western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT–PCR analysis  
Western blot analysis was performed as described previously.¹² Briefly, cells and the frozen tissues were lysed and equal amounts of protein were immunoblotted with appropriate antibody indicated in the legend of Figures 1–6. Detection was carried out with the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and quantified with Image J program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Immunohistochemistry with IKBKE and pSTAT3 antibodies were described previously.¹⁶,⁴⁹  

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol buffer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. RT–PCR was performed as previously described.¹⁷ Primers are IKBKE, 5′-CAGGGCTTGGCTACAACGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATGTCCAGGAGGTCAATGC-3′ (reverse) and GAPDH, 5′-CATG TTCGTCATGGGTGTGAACCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTGATGGCATGGACTGTG GTCAT-3′ (reverse).  

Cloning of the human IKBKE promoter  
Transcriptional start site of human *IKBKE* gene was determined by EST analysis and 5′ race. A 2.5-kb *IKBKE* promoter including exon 1 and intron 1 was generated by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from A549 cells. The PCR primers used for the amplified *IKBKE* promoter are 5′-GGAAGATCT AGACCAACCTGCTCAATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAAAGCTT CTTTAACCC TTTCCCTGTTTGTC-3′ (reverse). Forward primers used for deletion mutants and the different reverse primers are 5′-CGGGATCC ATGGGAAAAGTCCCTC CAAC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCC CCCAGGCAGTTTCCACT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCC GCTACCAGGAGGCTAAGAAC-3′. The PCR products were cloned to *BglII*/ *HindIII* sites of pGL3-Luciferase vector and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  

Luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay  
For reporter assay, the cells were seeded in a 12-well plate and transfected with IKBKE-Luc, β-gal and additional plasmid as described in the legend of Figures 2 and 5. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of empty vector pCMV-Tag3B. Thirty-six hours after transfection, luciferase was assayed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The luciferase activity was normalized to that of β-gal.  

ChIP assay was performed essentially as previously described.⁵⁰ Briefly, soluble chromatin was prepared from a total of 2 × 10⁷ asynchronously growing A549 cells, which were serum starved for 24 h, and then treated with or without nicotine and STAT3 inhibitor for 12 h. The pre-cleared chromatin solution was subjected to immunoprecipitation with either STAT3 antibody or IgG. Following multiple washes, the antibody–protein–DNA complex was eluted from the beads. The DNA was purified and subjected to PCR with primers flanking the STAT3 potential binding sites. The sequences of the PCR primers are ChIP-1, 5′-CCCAGGCAGTTTCCACT TAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAACTGGGGGCCCTTCTGGTAAT-3′ (reverse); ChIP-2, 5′-AGCAGTCTCTGAAGAGCATGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACTCACCCGCAG AGTAACAGC-3′ (reverse) and ChIP-3, 5′-GGTGGAAACATGAGGATCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAATGTTGGAGGGACTTT-3′ (reverse).  

Assays for detection of programmed cell death  
NSCLC cells were serum starved for 24 h and stimulated with 1 μM nicotine in the presence or absence of chemotherapeutic agents for time indicated in the legend of Figure 6. Apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay (Promega) and caspase3/7 activity (Roche, New York, NY, USA) following the manufacturer’s instruction.  

Statistical analysis  
For luciferase activity, cell survival and apoptosis, the experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicate. The data are represented by mean values ± s.d. Differences between control and testing cells were evaluated by Student’s *t*-test. The correlation of IKBKE with smoker status or pSTAT3 was analysis by χ² analysis. All analyses were performed with SPSS software, version 13.0 (USF, Tampa, FL, USA) and *P* ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
