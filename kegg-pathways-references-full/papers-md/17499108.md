Abstract: In the basal ganglia the effects of γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) are mediated by both ionotropic (GABA<sub>A</sub>) and metabotropic (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptors. Although the existence and widespread distribution in the CNS of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor had been established in the 1980s the field of GABA<sub>B</sub> research was revolutionized with the discovery that two related G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) needed to dimerize to form the functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor at the cell surface. This finding led to a number of studies of oligomerization in GPCRs and detailed pharmacological studies of the cloned receptors and their splice variants. Particular interest has focused on the proteins interacting with the receptor which may be important in mediating the longer term signalling effects of the receptor and modifying its cellular localization or physiology. The cloning of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors also led to the identification of the first compounds interacting in an allosteric fashion with the receptor some of which may have therapeutic value. Most recently “knockouts” of both the GABA<sub>B</sub> subunits have been produced where in general as expected there is a loss of the majority of the inhibitory effects of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor

Introduction

The actions of γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) in the basal ganglia and throughout the mammalian CNS are mediated by two classes of GABA receptors, the GABA<sub>A</sub> (see Wisden and Kaila chapters in this volume) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The first class described was the ligand-gated chloride GABA<sub>A</sub> channels (see early reviews, e.g., Curtis and Johnston, 1974; Krnjevic, 1984) that could be detected by binding assays using <sup>3</sup>H-GABA where binding was blocked by the antagonist, bicuculline (Curtis et al., 1974) and that were dependent on chloride (Zukin et al., 1974). In contrast, in 1979 Bowery and colleagues studying the release of <sup>3</sup>H-noradrenaline from the rat atria reported that GABA would reduce the release of <sup>3</sup>H-noradrenaline, but the process was not chloride dependent or could not be blocked by bicuculline suggesting the presence of a separate pharmacologically distinct GABA receptor (Bowery et al., 1979, 1980, 1981a, b), although this was disputed at the time (Bowery, 1993). Further studies identified β-p-chlorophenyl GABA (baclofen) as an active agonist at this putative GABA receptor and the use of the <sup>3</sup>H-labelled form of baclofen allowed Bowery and colleagues to reveal a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of <sup>3</sup>H-baclofen and <sup>3</sup>H-GABA in the CNS at the site they had earlier termed the GABA<sub>B</sub> site (Hill and Bowery, 1981), establishing GABA<sub>B</sub> as a CNS, as well as a peripheral receptor (Bowery et al., 1983; Curtis and Johnston, 1974). Baclofen was already known to decrease transmitter release and depress neuronal

activity probably through an action on calcium channels. Subsequent work established a physiological role for a GABA<sub>B</sub> postsynaptic receptor where activation produced an increase in membrane potassium conductance and neuronal hyperpolarization (Dutar and Nicoll, 1988; Nicoll, 2004). Thus, activation of the presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors will inhibit the release of other neurotransmitters (e.g., noradrenaline) through a decrease in membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance whereas postsynaptic receptors induce an increase in membrane potassium conductance through G-protein coupling to inwardly rectifying GIRK or Kir3 potassium channels (Nicoll, 2004) (see schematic Fig. 1). The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, in contrast to the GABA<sub>A</sub> channel, is coupled to G-proteins and is a metabotropic receptor (Hill, 1985; Karbon and Enna, 1985). Despite the relatively early recognition (1981) of

the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and the identification of <sup>3</sup>H-baclofen as a ligand, it was not until 1997 that the first GABA<sub>B</sub> G-protein-coupled receptor was cloned (now termed GABA<sub>B(1)</sub>) by Kaupmann et al. (1997). Subsequently a number of groups established that the functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor exists as a heterodimer of two components, subunits GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> (Jones et al., 1998; Kaupmann et al., 1998a; White et al., 1998; Kuner et al., 1999; Ng et al., 1999a). The cloning of these two GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunits and the realization that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can exist as heterodimers led to a large number of ongoing studies of oligomerization between GPCRs and the realization that the properties of oligomeric GPCRs may differ substantially from their monomers (Bulenger et al., 2005). Thus for example heterodimerization of the κ and δ opioid receptors

Fig. 1. Diagrammatic illustration of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and its components in a ‘signalling’ complex. The amino-terminal domains GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> contain one venus fly trap motif (VFTM) each, but only the one in the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> subunit binds GABA. Also in the amino terminal of GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> are two complement control protein (CCP) or sushi domains. A number of proteins are known to bind to the carboxy-terminal coiled-coil domains of the heterodimers (see text). Allosteric effectors such as CGS 39783 bind to the heptahelical domain of GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> subunit. Activation of the heterodimer opens presynaptic calcium channels and post-synaptic potassium channels (GIRKs) through the G-proteins G<sub>β/γ</sub>. A number of proteins (see text for details) have been shown to bind to the coiled-coil domains of the two subunits GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub>.results in a novel receptor with a distinct pharmacology (Jordan and Devi, 1999) and the μ opioid receptor can heterodimerize with the α₂a adrenergic receptor (Jordan et al., 2003). To summarize briefly at this point, the overwhelming evidence is that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors function primarily as heterodimers in which the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> subunit binds GABA and the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> subunit is responsible for G-protein coupling and signalling (for up to date reviews see Bettler et al., 2004 and Couve et al., 2004).

expression of the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> subunit on its own did not give a fully functional receptor. The evidence for heterodimerization included the demonstration of the co-expression of GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> mRNAs in many CNS areas (although the striatum is relatively low in GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> mRNA signal), and principally that co-expression of GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> in cell lines yielded a functional receptor with a 10-fold increase in agonist potency compared to GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> on its own that coupled well to signalling pathways (Jones et al., 1998, 2000; Kaupmann et al., 1998a; Kuner et al., 1999; Ng et al., 1999b; White et al., 1998). Work by White et al. (1998) using yeast two-hybrid methods (White et al., 2002) revealed that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> subunit would bind the C-terminal of GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> thus the two proteins interact preferentially as heterodimers and in general do not form functional receptors as monomers or homodimers. Although homodimers are formed, they are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi compartments (Villemure et al., 2005).

Following the recognition of the GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1b)</sub> isoforms further studies indicated a number of splice variants existed of the GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> isoform (Kaupmann et al., 1997, 1998b; Isomoto et al., 1998; Pfaff et al., 1999; Schwarz et al., 2000; Billinton et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2001; Wei et al., 2001; Bettler et al., 2004) (see Fig. 2). There has been a certain amount of confusion over the nomenclature of these variants, but in agreement with Bettler et al. (2004) the rat variants with an extra 31 amino acids in the second extracellular domain are perhaps best described as GABA<sub>B(1c–a)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1c–b)</sub> to distinguish then from the human variant GABA<sub>B(1c)</sub> which lacks one sushi domain (Fig. 2). Most interesting is perhaps the GABA<sub>B(1e)</sub> isoform (Schwarz et al., 2000), which expressed in cell cultures can be secreted as a soluble protein and in the plasma membrane of transfected cells can heterodimerize with the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> subunit indicating that the coiled-coil interaction is not essential for membrane targeting. It would be very interesting if this shortened protein were produced in vivo as it could act in a dominant-negative manner reducing the efficacy of the normal full length GABA<sub>B(1)</sub>. Developmentally

Molecular characterization/structure

Cloning

Despite the realization that GABA<sub>B</sub> sites could be recognized by labelled agonists such as baclofen it proved very difficult to purify the protein. Ligands such as <sup>3</sup>H-baclofen bound only with low affinity and the binding activity disappeared on membrane solubilization. The success in 1997 of Kaupmann et al. (1997) depended on the use of labelled ligands such as [¹²⁵I]-CGP 64213 or [¹²⁵I]-CGP 71872 with nanomolar affinity for the GABA<sub>B</sub> binding site to detect surface expression of a cDNA corresponding to a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. These ligands used in conjunction with expression cloning in COS-1 cells identified several GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> clones with many of the properties of the endogenous GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, except that they did not couple well to signalling pathways. The originally identified cDNAs (now termed GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1b)</sub>) were GPCRs with the characteristic seven trans-membrane domains with marked sequence similarities to the metabotropic glutamate receptors and belonging to the Family 3 (or Family C) GPCRs which include the metabotropic, calcium sensing and vomeronasal receptors. Subsequent work by a number of other groups (Jones et al. 1998; White et al., 1998; Kuner, et al. 1999; Ng et al., 1999a, as well as Kaupman et al., 1998a) showed that the reason for the poor coupling of the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> isoforms was due to requirement for a second GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunit, GABA<sub>B(2)</sub>. GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> must be co-expressed with a GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> subunit to form a functional heterodimeric GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor as
GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> with the sushi or CCP domains, and GABA<sub>B(1b)</sub> without the sushi domains, with variable amounts of 1a and 1b protein or being found in cerebral cortex hippocampus and brain stem (see for example Kaupmann et al., 1998b; Benke et al., 1999; Bischoff et al., 1999; Poorkhalkali et al., 2000; Princivalle et al., 2001). In these regions the 1b form is more prominent but in the striatum (Fig. 3) the 1a form (with the sushi domains) is more abundant. The significance of this difference is so far unclear but it may allow possible interactions of the NH<sub>2</sub> terminal extracellular sequence with other extracellular/surface proteins (such as fibulin-2) on neighbouring striatal neurones or influence the subcellular localization of the receptor.

Surprisingly the two subunits 1a and 1b arise not from alternative splicing, but from the use of an alternative promoter where the short GABA<sub>B(1b)</sub> NH<sub>2</sub> terminal arises from transcription within a GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> intron resulting in extension of exon 6 at its 5' end (Pfaff et al., 1999; Martin et al., 2001). Of more interest with respect to the striatum is that the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> mRNA is only poorly expressed in this region (Bischoff et al., 1999; Kuner et al., 1999; Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999; Martin et al., 1999; Clark et al., 2000) so it had been suggested that in this region the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> protein might interact with another partner. However, in the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> knockout described by Thuault et al. (2004) there was no evidence for functional GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> receptors on striatal neurones. This does not completely resolve the issue as the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> knockout produced by Thuault et al. (2004) probably expressed a mutated GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> protein expression albeit without function, so that in contrast to the full GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> knockout described by Gassmann et al. (2004) the presence of the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> mutated protein may have prevented the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> receptor protein from trafficking to the surface on its own, or with another partner. However, what is clear is that the presence of the functional GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> protein is required for the established GABA<sub>B</sub> response in striatal neurones. For basal ganglia neuronal function it may be important that the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> subunit interacts with the common GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit γ2S, which is highly expressed in the basal

Other variants include GABA<sub>(1c-a)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1c-b)</sub>, which are rat variants with an additional insertion spliced into the second extracellular loop (SI). GABA<sub>B(1c)</sub> is a human variant without the first CCP domain. GABA<sub>B(1c)</sub> would be soluble form if produced in vivo.

the human GABA<sub>B(1c)</sub> variant has been reported to be up-regulated Calver et al. (2000) and Blein et al. (2004) have examined the structure of the two sushi or complement control protein (CCP) domains in GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub>. They showed that the two sushi/CCP modules differ strikingly in structure with the second CCP module (CCP2) having a structure very similar to the CCP module in other proteins whilst CCP1 in GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> has a more disordered structure although like CCP2 it could bind the extracellular protein, fibulin-2 (Blein et al., 2004).

In contrast to the variety of transcripts found for the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> subunit, the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> transcripts reported in man may be artefacts as consideration of the genomic sequence does not indicate the presence of appropriate splice sites to generate these alternative transcripts and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> does not seem to occur in alternative forms (Martin et al., 2001). Regional distribution studies indicate that there are significant differences between the distribution of GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1b)</sub> mRNA and protein, that is the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> subunits

Distribution of $GABA_{B(1)}$ and $GABA_{B(2)}$ mRNA by in situ hybridization using variant non-specific oligonucleotides (a), (b), $GABA_{B(1)}$ and $GABA_{B(2)}$ proteins by immunohistochemistry using variant non-specific antibodies (c), (d) and $GABA_B$ binding sites by receptor autoradiography (e). The mismatch of mRNA signals in the striatum is clear in (a) and (b). A comprehensive overlap of $GABA_{B(1)}$ and $GABA_{B(2)}$ protein localization is evident from immunohistochemistry with polyclonal antibodies (c) and (d) with cortex, hippocampus thalamus and cerebellum showing high levels of receptor subunit expression. Part (e) shows the binding of 0.5 nm $[^3H]$-CGP62349, a high-affinity antagonist radioligand for $GABA_B$ receptors, which is in good agreement with immunohistochemical localization (c) and (d) [(e) image courtesy of Professor N.

ganglia (Fig. 4). Although the interaction between the $GABA_A$ receptor subunit and $GABA_{B(1)}$ did not form a functional receptor, the $\gamma 2S$ subunit association resulted in an enhancement of the normal $GABA_B$ heterodimeric receptors' response to GABA (Balasubramanian et al., 2004). Given the close association between the $GABA_A$ and $GABA_B$ receptors in the basal ganglia (Fig. 4) this may enhance the efficacy of GABA at $GABA_B$ receptors.

### Protein trafficking and $GABA_B$ associated proteins

It had been expected from earlier pharmacology studies that a number of $GABA_B$ receptor subtypes would be found, for example (Bonanno and Raiteri, 1993; Bowery, 1993; Bonanno et al., 1998) but expression studies of $GABA_{1(a)}$ or $GABA_{1(b)}$ with $GABA_{B(2)}$ do not detect significant functional differences between the expressed subunits.

Pharmacological differences may arise from interactions with extracellular proteins or with proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic tails of the heterodimer, especially the C-terminal coiled-coil domains, and the study of interacting proteins has revealed a number of proteins which may associate and interact with $GABA_B$ or its subunits. Thus, White et al. (2000) identified a number of proteins interacting with the coiled-coil domain of $GABA_{B(1)}$ including MUPP-1, CREB2, and ATF4. In primary neuronal cultures or in the cerebellum, CREB2 and $GABA_{B(1)}$ immunoreactivity co-distribute (Fig. 5). Exploration of this interaction in CHO cells showed that upon an activation of these cells with baclofen CREB2 moved from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it could initiate transcription (White et al., 2000). These results and earlier studies suggest $GABA_B$ receptors may signal through CREB proteins to the nucleus to mediate long-term effects. Another transcription factor that has recently been shown to interact with the coiled-coil domain of $GABA_{B(1a)}$ is CHOP (transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein C/EBP), which like CREB can co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with $GABA_B$ in neurones (Sauter et al., 2005). Further work established that the leucine zipper of CHOP interacts with the leucine zipper in the C-terminal of $GABA_{B(2)}$. Interestingly, CHOP did not bind to the C-terminal of $GABA_{B(1)}$ isoforms but could interact with the $GABA_{B(1a)}$ subtype selectively via its amino-terminal domain (Sauter et al., 2005). The physiological significance of the interaction between CHOP with $GABA_B$ remains to be elucidated.

Other proteins that may influence cellular levels of expression of $GABA_B$ include 14-3-3 protein which competes with $GABA_{B(2)}$ for binding to $GABA_{B(1)}$ (Couve et al., 2001) and Marlin-1. Marlin-1 that binds to the coiled-coil domain of $GABA_{B(1)}$ is a novel brain-specific RNA binding

protein (Couve et al., 2004). Marlin-1 like CREB, 14-3-3 and MUPP1 was identified by yeast two-hybrid studies. Marlin-1 binds to various RNA species including the 3′ untranslated regions of GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub>. Use of an antisense marlin-1 oligonucleotide sequence in an appropriate vector reduced marlin-1 expression in transfected COS cells and neurones and produced an increase in content of GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> the significance of which remains to be established. It is clear, however, that the carboxy-terminal of the GABA<sub>B</sub> heterodimer provides a complex and changeable scaffold for the
assembly of a signalling complex. Other proteins established as part of this complex although not binding through to the coiled-coil domain are the G-protein receptor kinase GRK4 and a cAMP-dependent kinase (see Couve et al., 2004).

As noted the C-terminals of the $GABA_{B(1)}$ and $GABA_{B(2)}$ interact through a coiled-coil domain which is essential for membrane trafficking and it is suggested that the coiled-coil domain masks the ER retention signal (RSR) in $GABA_{B(1)}$. Recent expression studies by Restituto et al. (2005) and Gassmann et al. (2005), have generated $GABA_{B(1)}$ mutants where inactivation of the RSR C-terminal retention motif by its modification to ASA, allows as predicted, the $GABA_{B(1)}$ protein to be expressed at the plasma membrane and to form functional receptors with $GABA_{B(2)}$. Mutation studies revealed inactivation of the RSR motif is not completely critical for release of the receptor complex from the ER as its effects can be reduced or abolished by moving the RSR sequence closer to the heptaheical domain, but even when it can reach the membrane surface $GABA_{B(1)}$ requires $GABA_{B(2)}$ to form a functional receptor. Thus, Restituto et al. (2005) found that mutation of the RSR sequence to ASA did not result in 100% trafficking of the receptor heterodimer to the surface and they showed that inactivation of an LL motif in the cytoplasmic domain of $GABA_{B(1)}$ substantially improved surface expression of $GABA_{B(1)}$ ASA. As part of this study Restituto et al. (2005) also identified msec7-1 a guanidine exchange factor that interacted with the LL motif. In the context of trafficking and the RSR retention sequence it had been proposed that 14-3-3 or coat protein complex 1 (COPI) might act as trafficking control proteins for $GABA_B$. COPI is known to mediate retrieval of RXR proteins from the cis-golgi into the ER in COPI-coated vesicles. Recent work by Brock et al. (2005) has shown that both COPI and 14-3-3 proteins bind the RSR sequence of $GABA_{B(1)}$ and COPI is involved in the intracellular retention of $GABA_{B(1)}$, but that 14-3-3 proteins (overexpressed) did not influence the kinetics of $GABA_B$ receptor trafficking to the surface or influence the ability of the $GABA_B$ receptors to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation. The precise role of 14-3-3, msec7-1 and

Marlin-1 proteins as with the other proteins associated with $GABA_B$ is unknown.

Considering the function of the heterodimer in more detail, both the $GABA_{B(1)}$ and $GABA_{B(2)}$ subunits have NH₂ terminal sequences that include sequences homologous to the bacterial periplasmic leucine-rich binding protein (LBP) corresponding to the lobes of a venus fly trap motif (VFTM) which could close on binding of ligand (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis and modelling studies by Pin and colleagues identified cysteine residues as important in folding the VFTM of $GABA_{B(1)}$ (Galvez et al., 1999). Consistent with this suggestion $GABA_{B(1)}$ could be made constitutively active by introducing a Cys–Cys bond in between the lobes “locking” the structure in the closed constitutively active form (Pin et al., 2004b). Modification of the amino acids in the VFTM (Galvez et al., 1999) had already suggested that a structure where Ser-246 and Gln-465 bind GABA in the $GABA_{B(1)}$ subunit VFTM. The constitutively active receptor could not be inhibited by antagonists but normal functioning could be restored by the use of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (Kniazeff et al., 2004a, b). In contrast, the VFTM is not well conserved in the $GABA_{B(2)}$ sequence and neither are the putative GABA-binding domains (Ser-246 and Gln-465) consistent with the evidence which indicates that it is only the $GABA_{B(1)}$ sequence which binds GABA and as noted earlier the $GABA_{B(2)}$ subunit couples the G-proteins and increases the affinity of the $GABA_{B(1)}$ receptor subunit for GABA. This interaction can happen at the level of the VFTM domains as using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Pin et al. (2004a) could demonstrate a direct interaction between the two VFTM domains in the absence of the 7 transmembrane domains of $GABA_{B(2)}$. So far there is no evidence that the VFTM of the subunit recognizes a natural ligand as would be required for receptor activation (Pin et al., 2005), although it is the site of action of novel low molecular weight allosteric effectors (Urwyler et al., 2005). Once GABA is bound to the $GABA_{B(1)}$ VFTM there is a stabilization of the closed state as noted, which activates the heptahelical domain of $GABA_{B(2)}$ required for G-protein activation and signalling and a chimaeric receptor with the $GABA_{B(1)}$ VFTM and theGABA<sub>B(2)</sub> heptahelical domain does not signal indicating the importance of the dimer formation for function (Gassmann et al., 2005). However, a dimeric receptor with the VFTM domain from GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> with two heptaheical domains from GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> will activate G-proteins upon agonist application so that the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> heptahelical domain is sufficient for G-protein coupling.

Early studies had established that GABA<sub>B</sub> was coupled to G-proteins based on sensitivity to GTP analogues, islet-activated protein and pertussis toxin (Hill et al., 1984; Asano et al., 1985). The sensitivity to pertussis toxin suggested the involvement of G<sub>αi</sub> or G<sub>αo</sub> G-proteins. Following the cloning of the GABA<sub>B</sub> subunits chimaeric G-proteins were used to show that the heterodimers recognize G<sub>qiα</sub> or G<sub>qoα</sub> proteins (Franek et al., 1999). This study has recently been extended by Uezono et al. (2005) who have investigated the G-protein coupling of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in more detail. Using BHK cells or Xenopus oocytes and GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> or GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> with attached fluorescent reporters they showed using FRET that the reporter-tagged GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> constructs would form heterodimers. Functionally expression in oocytes depended on co-expression of GIRKs and to determine which subunit coupled to the signalling mechanism. Uezono et al. (2005) used GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> or GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> constructs fused with G<sub>γi2</sub>. In a similar fashion they used GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> or GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> constructs with a fused G<sub>γqi5</sub> that activates phospholipase C in BHK cells. They found as predicted that only GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> with either G<sub>γi2</sub> or G<sub>γqi5</sub> would signal through oocytes or BHK cells, respectively, elegantly confirming that signal transducing G-proteins couple to GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> and not GABA<sub>B(1)</sub>. Finally, it has recently been shown that the GABA<sub>B</sub> heterodimer in neurones or in CHO cells is associated with lipid rafts (Becher et al., 2004) where the receptor at least in CHO cells was less active with an increased EC<sub>50</sub>.

and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> subunits is indistinguishable (Green et al., 2000). Similarly, the discovery of the original active agonist, baclofen (Bowery et al., 1980, 1981b), raised hopes that a range of selective agonists might be developed with selective effects in terms of antispasticity, antinocioception or anti-drug craving. However, although a number of structures based on the phosphinic analogues, 3 aminopropyl phosphinic (2APPA) or its methyl homologue were synthesized (Froestl et al., 1995) which are more potent than baclofen, there is no evidence for any selectivity in physiological effects of these compounds (for overview see Bowery et al., 2002). The structure of baclofen also provided the basis for the production of the first GABA<sub>B</sub> antagonists including phaclofen and saclofen (Kerr et al., 1987; Ong et al., 1987) (Fig. 6), which were important in defining the CNS physiological effects of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (Dutar and Nicholl, 1988). Dramatic improvement in the affinity of antagonists came with the attachment of 3,4-dichlorophenyl or 3-carboxybenzyl substituent to the ‘basic’ baclofen/phaclofen structure (Ong et al., 1998). These compounds with affinities in the nanomolar range were also produced as radioligands and [¹²⁵I]-CGP71872 and [¹²⁵I]-CGP64213 (Fig. 7) were critical to the first expression cloning of GABA<sub>Ia</sub> and GABA<sub>Ib</sub> receptor (for detailed review of structures see Bowery et al., 2002).

The range of drugs interacting with the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor has been considerably extended by the recent discovery of novel allosteric effectors for GABA<sub>B</sub> (Urwyler et al., 2001), which have

aroused considerable interest as they may have therapeutic advantages. The first group reported by Urwyler et al. (2001) including CGP7930 and CGP13501 (see Fig. 8) were positive modulators of GABA binding increasing the efficacy of GABA on the GABA<sub>B</sub> hetero-dimer. Further work by Urwyler et al. (2003) identified another class of compounds exemplified by GS39783 (Fig. 8) which like CGP7930 and CGP13501 were also positive modulators of GABA<sub>B</sub>, increasing the potency and efficacy of GABA on the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor but without any effects themselves and modulating responses which were blockable by GABA<sub>B</sub> antagonists. Clarification of the site of action of these compounds came from the studies of Binet et al. (2004a, b) who demonstrated that CGP7930 activates the GABA<sub>B</sub> heterodimer through the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> subunit. This effect is retained in the recombinant receptor where the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> subunit has had the extracellular domains deleted showing

these low molecular weight allosteric modulators act through the heptahelical domain of GABA<sub>B(2)</sub>. Behavioural studies with GS 39783 indicate it is devoid of the sedative and cognitive effects of baclofen (Cryan et al., 2004) and these compounds may have potential as anxiolytics especially as GABA<sub>B</sub>-deficient mice have ‘panic’ attacks and are more anxious in anxiety related behavioural screens (Mombereau et al., 2005).

In considering the ‘classical’ effects of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, the original observations of Bowery and others were based on the ability of GABA<sub>B</sub> to inhibit (autoreceptors) or increase neurotransmitter release (heteroreceptors). These effects are likely mediated through inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels of N, P or Q types by G<sub>β/γ</sub> (see Fig. 1) and a recent study (Richman et al., 2004) has shown that N-type calcium channels can act as scaffold proteins in assembling signalling molecules such as members of the Ras pathway which modulate

GABA<sub>B</sub> effects. In a similar fashion G<sub>β/γ</sub> subunits open K<sup>+</sup> channels (principally the inward rectifying Kir3 channels) as well as activating or inhibiting adenylate cyclase isoforms. The G-proteins associated with the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor are believed as discussed earlier on the basis pertussis sensitivity, antisense knockdown and knockout experiments to be G<sub>αi</sub> or G<sub>αo</sub> type G-protein (Morishita et al., 1990; Campbell et al., 1993; Greif et al., 2000) and G<sub>αi</sub> and G<sub>αo</sub> are known to inhibit adenyl cyclase types I, III, I and VI while G<sub>βγ</sub> can stimulate adenyl cyclase types II, IV and VII. The ability of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to stimulate adenyl cyclase is considered to be due to the presence of G<sub>sα</sub> coupled GPCRs in the vicinity. Hashimoto and Kuriyama (1997), for example, could demonstrate in the rat striatum that baclofen would potentiate the generation of cAMP by isoprenaline in microdialysis experiments in freely moving animals. In general terms, the ability of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor to couple to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels makes them strong inhibitors of neurotransmitter release although the precise Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels implicated in these effects is likely to vary depending on the CNS region. In mice lacking GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> or GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> receptors, baclofen-induced outward currents are absent, a feature also found in mice lacking the inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel, Kir3 (Nicoll, 2004) consistent with the important role of this channel in GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor function.

Knockouts (KO) of both the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> receptors have been produced, the B2 KO most recently (Schuler et al., 2001; Gassmann et al., 2004; Thuault et al., 2004). All the knockout mice have similar behavioural phenotypes showing spontaneous seizures, hyper-algesia, hyper-locomotion and memory impairments consistent with the loss of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The first KO mice produced were knockouts of the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> receptor and as expected there was no loss of GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> mRNA, but there was in both strains of mice a dramatic loss of GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> protein consistent with the need for the heterodimer partner GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> for stable expression of the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> protein. In the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> KOs as expected there was a complete loss of ligand binding (<sup>3</sup>H-CGP54626 and <sup>125</sup>I-CGP64213) consistent with the loss of the GABA/ligand binding site on the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal of GABA<sub>B(1)</sub>. Electrophysiological analysis of hippocampal slices from these mice revealed the loss

of all GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors whether pre- or post-
synaptic (Prosser et al., 2001; Schuler et al., 2001) 
providing further evidence against the existence of 
multiple GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> KO 
mice as noted had a similar behavioural phenotype 
as the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> KO mice and detectable expres-
sion of the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> mRNA. The GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> 
protein was still produced albeit at substantially 
lower levels in the full KO (Gassmann et al., 2004). 
In this mouse although ligand ([<sup>125</sup>I]-CGP64213) 
binding or [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTP<sub>γS</sub> binding was not detectable 
immunohistochemistry, however, revealed that 
some GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> protein was trafficked to the sur-
face of neurones and was detectable on synaptic 
membranes so that some GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> protein could 
exit the ER but remained in the cell body and 
dendrites of the hippocampus. However, although 
electrophysiological experiments were unable to 
demonstrate the presence of interneuronal auto-
receptors in these GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> KO mice there was 
a baclofen-induced inward current in the CA2 
pyramidal cells which was blocked by GABA<sub>B</sub> 
antagonists whereas in the equivalent wild-type 
controls the Kir3 current is outward (see Fig. 1). 
This response was G-protein mediated and 
represents what may be a functional response of 
the GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> subunit. In contrast, in the KO 
mouse of Thuault et al. (2004), which had only a 
C-terminal deletion of the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub>, the 
GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> was not trafficked to the surface. As 
the striatum expresses far more GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> mRNA 
than GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> mRNA it may be that certain 
striatal neurones would express this GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> 
receptor subunit without the GABA<sub>B(2)</sub> subunit 
producing what would be a functionally very dis-
tinct somatic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. This possibility 
needs to be borne in mind in considering the 
role(s) of GABA<sub>B</sub> in the basal ganglia. Important 
tools in investigating GABA<sub>B</sub> function will be 
further transgenic mice including conditional KOs 
and a floxed allele for inactivation of the 
GABA<sub>B(1)</sub> gene has recently been produced 
(Haller et al., 2004). Such an approach will allow 
regional- and time-specific deletion of GABA<sub>B</sub> re-
ceptors and further our understanding of the role 
of GABA<sub>B</sub> in the CNS which may provide clues to 
the use of GABA<sub>B</sub> in conditions such as anxiety 
and depression (Cryan and Kaupmann, 2005).
