Beyond peptidoglycan for Nod2

Peter J Murray

Nod2 is a cytoplasmic Nod-like receptor protein that detects the peptidoglycan subfragment muramyl dipeptide. New work shows that Nod2 also has an important role in recognizing viruses and in triggering interferon production during viral infection.

Figure 1 Pathways of Nod2 activation. Nod2 activates at least two distinct pathways, including the canonical MDP activation pathway involving inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and the kinase RIP2; the latter becomes ubiquitinated (Ub) and subsequently activates NF-κB, leading to inflammatory gene expression. The second pathway involves ssRNA virus–induced activation of Nod2, which binds to MAVS, leading to IRF3 activation and interferon gene expression. NLRX1 is an NLR family member that inhibits MAVS at the mitochondrial membrane. The molecular mechanisms that link MAVS and IRF3 are unknown at present.

NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling in response to MDP are ablated in Nod2-deficient macrophages³⁴. MDP also activates other NLR-mediated response pathways that do not seem to be directly related to the Nod2-MDP pathway⁵. Several key biochemical steps in the Nod2-MDP activation pathway have been resolved. It is now clear that the CARD kinase RIP2, in combination with the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, act ‘downstream’ of MDP activation in the Nod2 signaling pathway⁶⁷. Thus, Nod2 activation, induced directly or indirectly by MDP, leads to RIP2-mediated stimulation of the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase and MAP kinase pathways and subsequent production of cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 1). It is also important to mention that MDP is a far weaker stimulus (on a molar basis) of macrophages than are most Toll-like receptors.

NEWS AND VIEWS

find that RSV infection drives enrichment of Nod2 in mitochondria, where Nod2 binds to MAVS² (Fig. 1). At this stage, the biochemical mechanism that links MAVS to IRF3 activation in any system remains an unresolved but important issue in understanding the mechanisms that initiate the production of type I interferon. Nevertheless, the binding of Nod2 to MAVS seems to be a central event linking the recognition of ssRNA viruses and ‘downstream’ IRF3 activation. Although it may seem intuitive that the CARDs of Nod2 and MAVS would interact, this is not the case, as shown by mutagenesis studies². Instead, the central NBD and LRR domain of Nod2 are required for MAVS binding (Fig. 1). This mode of NLR protein interaction with MAVS is reminiscent of the binding of NLRX1, a mitochondrial NLR protein that inhibits MAVS and diminishes IRF3 activation⁹. Determining the structural details of how Nod2 and NLRX1 engage MAVS via NBD-LRR domains would be a notable advance in this field.

Another NLR protein, NLRP3, also ‘detects’ viral RNA and serves a nonredundant function in the immune response to influenza viruses through the production of inflammasome-processed cytokines, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β)¹⁰. However, NLRP3 activation is promiscuous, being caused by diverse stimuli such as asbestos, silica, uric acid, necrotic cells, toxic drugs, intracellular bacteria and viruses⁵. NLRP3-mediated activation has been postulated to be triggered by cellular damage such as membrane stress, a mechanism previously considered unrelated to Nod2 activation⁵. Therefore, answering the question of how viral ssRNA activates both Nod2 and NLRP3 will be important in untangling how remarkably diverse stimuli can activate NLR proteins.

Several members of the NLR family, including Nod2, are associated with genetic disorders that involve disturbances in the normal regulation of inflammation. For example, presumed loss-of-function mutations in NOD2 are found in some patients with Crohn’s disease¹,¹¹. As Crohn’s disease is an intestinal disorder of excessive inflammation, how complete or partial loss of MDP responsiveness in patients with Crohn’s disease causes more inflammation remains an active field of research. In this context, the results of Sabbah et al. suggest the possibility that recognition of viruses, in addition to recognition of MDP, might be compromised in the absence of normal Nod2 function. The mechanistic link between loss of Nod2 function (in humans with Crohn’s disease) and more inflammation (but with less recognition of pathogens) remains to be established. However, an intriguing link between interferon production and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which is essential for suppressing inflammation in the gut, has been described; production of type I interferon is required for IL-10 production by myeloid lineage cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide¹². As the absence of Nod2 results in less interferon production after viral infection, perhaps IL-10 production is also affected. Indeed, distinct effects of NOD2 and Nod2 mutations on IL-10 production have been reported in human and mouse systems¹³,¹⁴. Furthermore, the link between Nod2 and interferon production described by Sabbah et al. may be broader than first appreciated, as Nod2 also is involved in interferon production in macrophages infected with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*¹⁵. This last study suggests that RIP2 is involved in the Nod2 signaling pathway independently of IRF3 and thus is probably distinct from the Nod2-MAVS pathway described by Sabbah et al., which is independent of RIP2 but dependent on IRF3.

Sabbah et al. have expanded the function of Nod2 beyond detection of peptidoglycan. The possibility that the functions of potentially all the NLR proteins are more complex than previously assumed must now be considered. The major question in this field concerns the biochemical mechanism of microbial activation of Nod2 and how these events translate into activation of specific signaling pathways and cellular immune responses. It is possible that Nod2 and the other NLR proteins integrate signals from ‘upstream’ events; thus, the NLR proteins probably coordinate cellular immunity at multiple levels.
