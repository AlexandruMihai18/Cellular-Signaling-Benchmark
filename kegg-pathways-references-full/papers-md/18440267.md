Cutin and suberin are the polymer matrices for lipophilic cell wall barriers. These barriers control the fluxes of gases, water and solutes, and also play roles in protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stresses and in controlling plant morphology. Although they are ubiquitous, cutin and suberin are the least understood of the major plant extracellular polymers. The use of forward and reverse genetic approaches in *Arabidopsis* has led to the identification of oxidoreductase and acyltransferase genes involved in the biosynthesis of these polymers. However, major questions about the underlying polymer structure, biochemistry, and intracellular versus extracellular assembly remain to be resolved. The analysis of plant lines with modified cutins and suberins has begun to reveal the inter-relationships between the composition and function of these polymers.

The role of cutin and suberin in plants

The hydrophobic layers present in plant cell walls contain the lipid polymers cutin or suberin [1–5]. These layers have important roles in plant biology, principally as barriers to control the movement of gases, water and solutes, and to impart pathogen resistance. Indeed, the evolution of land plants certainly required the development of the cuticle, the cutin-based layer sealing the epidermis of aerial organs (Figure 1a). Also, the ubiquitous presence of suberin in specific internal root-tissues (Figure 1b) that control water and ion uptake suggests that this polymer plays an important role in the adaptation of vascular plants to terrestrial life. However, the purpose of this article is not to review the functions of cutin and suberin *per se*, but to focus on the structure and assembly of these insoluble polymers. It is important to understand just how little we really know about these fatty acid-derived polymers. Since the work of Pappachan Kolattakudy and other workers in the 1970s and 1980s [1,6], limited progress has been made in describing their detailed structure and biosynthesis. However, forward and reverse genetic approaches are now giving the subject renewed impetus. Below, we review the extent to which gene identification and altered gene expression have enabled new insights into polyester structure and biosynthesis. We have limited our scope to higher plants, and we do not cover the polyesters found in stigmas [7,8] or covering pollen grains [9]. Related topics including the biosynthesis and function of cuticular waxes [10–13], and lignin and phenylpropanoid metabolism in relation to suberin [2,14] have been reviewed elsewhere.

Distribution, function and monomer composition of cutin and suberin

**Cutin and the cuticle**

The cuticle is synthesized by the epidermis of fruits, leaves, primary stems and organs of flowers. It is composed of the following components: a polymer matrix called cutin, which can be depolymerized by cleaving ester bonds; a polymer matrix called cutan, which is highly resistant to depolymerization; and intracuticular and epicuticular waxes (Figure 1a). Typical cutin monomers include C16 and C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids (Figure 2a). By contrast, the waxes are biosynthetically distinct, very-long-chain (C24–C34) saturated non-polar molecules [10,12]. Cutin is found abutting the outer face of the outer primary wall of epidermal cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has revealed at least six different types of cuticle fine structure [15]. It is not clear how these structures relate to cutin monomer composition. As a component of the cuticle, cutin is expected to have roles in controlling non-stomatal water and gas exchange, and in host-pathogen interactions [1,3]. Cutin also has proposed roles in plant morphology [16] and in maintaining organ identity by preventing organ fusion [17]. Additionally, the transport of polar molecules across the cuticle occurs through both a bulk-phase component and polar pores [18,19], possibly implying the existence of cutin microdomain structures. Many aspects of the relationships between structure and function of cutin polymer have been difficult to study in the absence of approaches to modify cutin composition. Recently, researchers have developed *Arabidopsis thaliana* knockout plants that show cutin defects [3] and plants over-expressing enzymes of cutin biosynthesis [20]. The availability of plants with modified cutin compositions provides new tools to probe the physiological function of cutin.

TEM as a thickening of the wall, consisting of alternating dark and light bands – collectively, the suberin lamellae. Suberin lamellae occur in the endodermis and are also the form of suberin found in periderms. A second type of suberin deposition occurs in limited regions (i.e. Casparian strips) within the anticlinal primary cell walls at an early stage of endodermis development, and it usually does not result in substantial wall thickening [21]. From a structural point of view, suberin is composed of a polyester fraction, and a fraction of C–C and ether-linked aromatics more resistant to depolymerization. These two fractions are often considered to form ‘polyaliphatic’ and ‘polyaromatic’ domains, respectively [1–5]. Suberin has an aliphatic monomer profile that is both similar and distinctive from that of cutin (Figure 2a; see later section). The dominant aromatic monomer of the polyester fraction is ferulate, whereas dicarboxylic acids and very-long-chain aliphatics (≥C20) are also considered to be indicative of suberin [22]. Some waxes also appear to be associated with the suberin polymer – at least for the suberin lamellae – but unlike cuticular waxes, which are chemically distinct from cutin monomers, suberin-associated waxes contain components that are chemically closely related to suberin monomers. Data in *Arabidopsis* further suggest a direct metabolic relationship between suberin and some associated waxes [23]. Chemical composition, the site and timing of deposition, and additional, mostly indirect evidence support the view that a major role for suberin and associated waxes is to provide a hydrophobic barrier that restricts the paths available for the movement of water and solutes in roots [1,4,21] and which plays a role in pathogen resistance [1,24]. The isolation of the first mutant affected in suberin biosynthesis has indeed highlighted the importance of suberin in resistance to salt stress [25]. Characterization of various suberin mutants in *Arabidopsis* will be important to test some of the roles traditionally attributed to suberin in different tissues.

**Limited knowledge exists about cutin and suberin structure**

Although the monomer compositions of cutin and suberin are well documented for specific plants and tissues, the composition of the structural elements of the corresponding polymers are far from clear. The uncertainties of polymer structure are reviewed here solely from the perspective of the specifics required to understand biosynthesis. The term ‘polyester’ is used rather than polymer when we focus explicitly on structural elements composed of carboxyester-linked monomers (Figure 2b).

**ω-hydroxy fatty acid-rich cutins**

Although textbooks and reviews have presented models for ‘the three-dimensional structure of cutin,’ several important aspects of cutin polymer structure are unclear. It is not known if cutin exists as discrete polymer molecules of unknown molecular weight, possibly anchored to the cell wall at a few sites, or if cutin is a highly cross-linked continuum. From a polymer chemist’s perspective, there is a list of monomers but little else, and even that list might be incomplete. In most cutins, the dominant monomer is an ω-hydroxy fatty acid, the self-polymerization of which will

**Suberin and suberized tissues**

Suberin is deposited constitutively in both external and internal tissues at specific cell wall locations during plant development. Examples of external deposition include the periderm of secondary roots and stems, and cotton fibers. Examples of internal deposition include root endodermis and the bundle sheaths of monocots. Suberin synthesis also occurs at abscission zones to seal tissues, such as in the case of the chalazal plug formed during the late stages of seed maturation. In addition to widespread constitutive deposition, suberin is also synthesized in response to wounding and stress. Indeed, much suberin research has been carried out using the wound-induced suberization of potato periderm [1]. An important difference between cutin and suberin is that suberin is deposited mostly on the inner face of primary walls (Figure 1b). Suberin often appears in

Figure 2. Structures of common cutin and suberin monomers, typical ranges of composition values, and hypothetical monomer connectivity patterns. (a) Representative structures within each monomer group are shown. The mid-chain oxygen-functionalized monomers, which include epoxy, hydroxy, vicinal dihydroxy and oxo groups, can be found as normal fatty acids, ω-hydroxy fatty acids and α, ω-dicarboxylic acids (DCAs). In the literature 2-hydroxy fatty acids are reported from trace to moderate amounts in monomer compositions. Given that several lines of evidence suggest that these are likely to come from the N-acyl groups of residual sphingolipids [33], they have not been included in this tabulation. The abundances reported are from many literature sources, and generally are percentages of the total monomer mass recovered after transesterification as the depolymerization method.

(e) Organization of DCA and glycerol monomers to produce a dendrimer structure, achieved by allowing free OH groups on some of the glycerol monomers. In a polyester containing ω-hydroxy fatty acids, DCAs and glycerol, it is not known if the polyesters will have distinctly different domains, as shown, or a more mixed structure. The dendrimer domains shown are themselves polyols, and so might be cross-linked by the presence of DCAs alone.

Review

produce a linear polyester chain (Figure 2b). Often, the ω-hydroxy fatty acid has a mid-chain oxygen-containing functional group (epoxy, oxo, hydroxy or vicinal diol). The mid-chain (secondary) hydroxyls may be esterified to ω-hydroxy fatty acid monomers [1,26,27], creating a local branched structure (Figure 2b). Essentially all of the primary hydroxyls and about half of the secondary hydroxyls are esterified, although these analyses have only been performed on a limited number of C16-rich cutins [1,28]. When considered independently of other possible monomers and linkages, these data suggest that a polyester dendrimer is likely to be a dominant structural element in ω-hydroxy fatty acid rich cutins (Figure 2c). It has long been known that glycerol is a component of suberin [29], but it has also recently been identified as a major component of isolated cuticles [30]. The presence of glycerol as a cutin monomer still does not introduce cross-linking into an ω-hydroxy fatty acid polyester structure; rather, it allows larger dendrimers to be constructed. The molar ratio of glycerol OH groups to aliphatic monomer COOH groups ranged from ~1:10 to 1:1 [30]. If we assume that aliphatic COOH will be largely esterified to aliphatic OH, then we can speculate that, in cuticles with high glycerol content, glycerol esterification might be provided by, for example, cutan (see below) or by uronic acids in the cell wall. Thus we still cannot define the basic three-dimensional organization of cutin monomers; nor can we be certain of whether cutin insolubility results from covalent anchoring to the cell wall or to cutan (see below), or whether it results from still undefined cross-linking within the aliphatic domain, or from the very high molecular weight of individual, covalently unattached polymer molecules.

A puzzling cutin

The recent discovery of high levels of octadecadiene dioic acid in *A. thaliana* epidermal polyesters and isolated cuticles [31,32] was unexpected. This C18:2 α,ω-dicarboxylic acid (DCA) monomer, derived from linoleic acid, is also present in *Brassica napus* [31,33]. High DCA content had previously been considered diagnostic of suberin [22]. However, C18:2 DCA is at most a trace component in suberins, and so cannot be considered a typical suberin monomer. Although quantitative measures of glycerol in *Arabidopsis* cutin have yet to be made, it is present ([32]; Y. Li, unpublished). Glycerol is probably directly esterified to DCA, given that glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) genes are essential for its deposition (see below). It is possible that DCA-glycerol has arisen as a specialized structure dominating cutin in at least the Brassicaceae. However, we do not know the stoichiometry of DCA to glycerol and we cannot infer whether this polymer is predominantly a dendrimeric or cross-linked structure (Figure 2d,e). It is also possible that these structural elements are derived from those present in cutan. If so, what functional properties of a DCA-based cutin are similar to those of an ω-hydroxy fatty acid-based cutin, and what structural parameters might enable this interchangeability? And, finally, does its atypical leaf and stem composition limit *Arabidopsis* as a generic model for cutin?

Cutan

An important facet of cutin analysis is that, after isolation of the cuticle with subsequent delipidation and depolymerization to cleave ester bonds, a residue remains. When this material contains a significant aliphatic content, it is called cutan. It also contains cell wall carbohydrates and some aromatics. Cutan can be analyzed by spectroscopic and pyrolysis gas chromatography methods [34], although this is rarely done. Cutan can account for at least as much mass as cutin [35,36]. Being an amorphous solid, cutan is highly intractable to further degradation without loss of chemical information, whereas solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance methods can only provide limited structural information. Cutan is often considered to contain ether-linked aliphatics, although C–C bonds between aliphatic chains may also be present. Linoleic acid appeared to be a preferred precursor for cutan biosynthesis when compared with palmitic or oleic acids [36,37]. Polymerization based on acyl hydroperoxide intermediates was therefore proposed to produce cutan. This remains speculative. Cross-linking ether bonds might equally well arise from the ring-opening reactions of epoxy-containing monomers. Understanding cutan might be very important in understanding cutin. Is it structurally linked to cutin or even in part derived from it? In leaves of Kafir lily (*Clivia miniata* Reg.), cutan accumulation occurred largely after cutin deposition, leading to the suggestion that the low-plasticity cutan material was deposited and/or cross-linked only after cell expansion was complete [35]. There are no simple assays for cutan, making study of genetics and biosynthesis both difficult and time-consuming.

Suberin

Apart from the fatty acids, ω-hydroxy fatty acids and glycerol found in cutin, suberin is distinctive in that it also contains high levels of α,ω-dicarboxylic acids, plus hydroxycinnamic acids (predominantly ferulate) and fatty alcohols (Figure 2a). Also distinctive, a significant fraction of the saturated aliphatics found in suberin have chain lengths >C20. Glycerol-containing aliphatic dimers and trimers have been isolated by partial depolymerization methods [30,38–40]. These studies have also identified ester bonds between ω-hydroxy fatty acids, and between ω-hydroxy fatty acids and DCA or ferulate. DCAs, in combination with glycerol, can provide a cross-linked network that would lead to a rigid, insoluble polymer (Figure 2d). However, extensive cross-linking would require that much of the glycerol is esterified at all three hydroxyl groups, a feature that has yet to be investigated. Linkages have been proposed between suberin and the cell wall through a polymerized aromatic domain composed of hydroxycinnamic acid monomers, and possibly some monolignols, although at much lower concentrations than those found in lignin [1,2,41]. Although these covalent linkages have not actually been identified, they would account for suberin insolubility. This is a reasonable hypothesis given that ferulate can be esterified to glycerol or to ω-hydroxy fatty acids, and given the proposal that ferulate links polysaccharides and lignin in wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) internodes [42] through ester bonds and ether bonds, respectively. Suberin often has a lamellar structure.

has been proposed that the width of the 'light' lamellae is directly related to the average length of the acyl chains [43]. Whether this lamellar structure depends on the aliphatic and aromatic components *per se* or whether it requires some other structural or enzymatic component remains unknown.

**Structure determination: a role for genetics?**

The oligomers isolated from the partial depolymerization of suberin or cutin provide evidence of specific monomer linkages [5], but the information cannot be extrapolated to give us a full view of polyester structure. Despite improvements in nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of solids over the past ten years, the information gained by application of such methods to isolated cuticles and suberins has yet to give us a view of polyester structure of sufficient detail to aid biosynthetic studies. The situation seems to be at an impasse, unless methods, perhaps biological, can be developed to release much larger, soluble fragments or domains of polyesters for chemical analysis. In this endeavor, perhaps genetic deconstruction can aid this very difficult problem of structure determination. As useful mutants or transgenes are identified in Arabidopsis (see below), it might be informative to apply current chemical analysis methods to purified Arabidopsis polymer fractions or to corresponding lines developed in plants (e.g., Brassica napus or tomato) that enable large-scale polymer isolation for chemical analysis.

**The search for genes encoding cutin and suberin biosynthetic enzymes**

The development of routine and quantitative analysis of lipid polymers in the model plant Arabidopsis [31–33], and the isolation of several key mutants have caused a resurgence of progress in plant lipid-polymer research. Indeed, some of the mutants identified by forward genetic screens for epidermal fusions [44–48], increased permeability of cuticles to toluidine blue [49], or altered susceptibility to pathogen infection [50, 51] were shown to have altered cutin monomer load or compositions. Furthermore, the mutated genes were mapped and shown to encode likely biosynthetic enzymes (see below). Moreover, the cataloging of known or putative genes for lipid synthesis [52], combined with transcriptome analyses of the cutin-rich Arabidopsis stem epidermis [53], has yielded candidate-gene lists that have led to the isolation of new polyester mutants by reverse genetics [20, 25, 54]. The recent analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the suberin-rich phellem of cork tree (*Quercus suber* L.) [55], and the identification of 12 genes upregulated after induction of the Arabidopsis WAX INDUCER 1 (*WIN1*, also known as *SHINE1*) transcription factor—known to affect cutin and waxes [56]—will provide valuable additional sources of gene candidates. Indeed, the number of genes identified means that gene co-expression analyses across many publicly available microarray data sets [57] will become a useful tool for further cutin and suberin gene discovery.

**Fatty acid oxidases, acyltransferases and other enzymes required for monomer biosynthesis**

The picture of the enzymes required for polymer biogenesis that has arisen from these mutant approaches is dominated by three families: fatty acid oxidases of the CYP86A

TRENDS in Plant Science

sub-family; an acyl-activating enzyme of the LACS family; and acyltransferases of the GPAT family. Specifically, research has identified genes encoding an acyl-CoA synthetase (LACS2) [51, 58], a cytochrome P450-dependent fatty acid oxidase (CYP86A2; also known as ATT1) [50], and two GPATs [20]. Knocking out any of these genes individually—or as a pair, in the case of GPAT4 and GPAT8—caused large reductions in Arabidopsis cutin monomer loads, particularly in the major monomer C18:2 DCA (Figure 3b). In addition, mutants of GPAT5 and CYP86A1 have reduced levels of suberin monomers in roots and seed coats [20, 25]. Furthermore, a mutant of CYP86A8 (*lacerata*) has phenotypes typical of lesions in cutin, although there is still no published cutin analysis of this line [45].

Gain-of-function approaches also demonstrate the central role of GPAT acyltransferases and CYP86A oxidases in polymer biogenesis. When GPAT5 was expressed ectopically in Arabidopsis [23], monoacylglycerols esterified with C20–C28-saturated acyl chains accumulated at the plant surface, demonstrating *in vivo* that a GPAT can catalyze the transfer of acyl chains to a glycerol-based acceptor and that the products can be transported to the cuticle. Furthermore, transgenic co-expression of GPAT5 with CYP86A1 resulted in the incorporation of very-long-chain ω-hydroxy fatty acids and DCAs into the cutin of stem epidermis [20]. This result indicates that P450 and GPATs act in the same pathway to form polyesters and suggests that some suberin-associated enzymes can participate in cutin biosynthesis. Because of the involvement of GPATs and CYP86A oxidases in the biosynthesis of both cutin and aliphatic suberin, the hypothetical pathways of biosynthesis presented in Figure 3a probably relate to both types of polymers.

Despite the progress in chemical genetics described above, it is important to note that the reactions of acyl activation, ω-oxidation of acyl chains, and acyl transfer to glycerol might be ordered in several ways to produce ω-oxidized-acylglycerols, a putative structural element of lipid polymers. The three likely pathways are depicted in schemes 1 to 3 of Figure 3a and reflect the fundamental question of whether the P450 substrate *in vivo* is free fatty acid (FFA), acyl-CoA or an acylglycerol moiety. Current *in vitro* activity data do not enable us to distinguish between these possibilities. Given that LACS2 has activity towards both normal and ω-hydroxy FFAs [58], it might fit in all three schemes. P450 ω-hydroxylase enzymes have demonstrated *in vitro* activity with FFA substrates [59–61], and thus it is often assumed that the P450 oxidation is the initial step, as shown in scheme 1. We believe there are insufficient data to make this a categorical assumption because, taking just one example, GPATs may provide acylglycerols for P450s, and such substrates have not been tested. Moreover, we do not know whether CYP86A oxidases act only as ω-hydroxylases or whether they function as ω-oxidases capable of producing a DCA, as has been reported for CYP95A5 of tobacco [62] and CYP94C1 of Arabidopsis [63]. In this regard, the Arabidopsis putative oxidoreductase encoded by *HOTHEAD* [46] has been shown to affect cutin composition and was thought to catalyze the conversion of ω-hydroxy fatty acids to ω-oxo fatty acids [48]. Although the role of HOTHEAD in this

particular reaction still needs to be experimentally supported, it is consistent with earlier enzymology studies with extracts of bean leaf epidermis or suberized potato, which showed that dicarboxylates are produced by NADP-dependent ω-hydroxyacid and ω-oxoacid oxidoreductases [64–66].

**Additional complexities in monomer biosynthesis**

The existence of several steps of oxidation (which might even occur on different substrates such as acyl-CoAs and glycerolipids) could greatly add to the complexity of the pathways. For suberin, uncertainties about the pathway of biosynthesis are compounded by the possibility that the elongation reactions necessary to produce ≥C20 components could precede or succeed the ω-oxidation reactions. Many schemes are therefore possible. The broader point we make from these considerations is that it is premature to assume any single metabolic scheme linking oxidases, acyltransferases and other enzymes (see following section) on the basis of the current biochemical and genetic data. Recourse to detailed enzymology or pulse-chase labeling might be required to lend further support to any particular scheme. It is possible that fundamental steps in biosynthesis have been missed. The use of gene correlation software reveals several genes that correlate strongly with genes identified as being involved in suberin or cutin biosynthesis, but which have no annotated function. In this context, metabolic profiling of suberin biosynthesis has been undertaken [67]. This method has the potential to uncover novel polar compounds that are highly correlated to suberin deposition and which might be novel metabolic intermediates. Concerning fatty acid elongation, elongase activities are clearly present in root tissues as well as in aerial organs [68]. Given that saturated chains ≥C20 are common among suberin, waxes and sphingolipids, and given that *Arabidopsis* is thought to have at least 20 genes encoding β-ketoacyl-CoA synthases [10, 52], it may be difficult to assign specific functions to specific isoforms. Indeed this enzyme class and others might participate in more than one pathway. In addition, suberin contains non-aliphatic acyl groups (Figure 2a). Thus, a feruloyl transferase is required [69]. The BAHD gene family is known to encode several acyl transferases acting on aromatic substrates in natural product synthesis [70], and it is noteworthy that the phellem ESTs from *Quercus* contain a highly expressed gene of this family [55].

Although we have focused on the CYP86A sub-family of P450s, other P450s, and particularly the CYP94 family, have been reported as fatty acid ω-oxidases [71]. These might have roles in lipid signaling and/or lipid polymer biosynthesis. In addition, the enzymes responsible for mid-chain hydroxylation and epoxidation have yet to be identified, and might well be P450 enzymes [72]. Although it is not clear what the *in vivo* substrate for the CYP86A clade of P450 enzymes is, *in vitro* assays of the recombinant enzymes expressed in yeast with FFA substrates have yielded some intriguing results. A simple interpretation of *att1* cutin compositions would suggest that C18:1 is preferred as a substrate over C16:0, but the recombinant enzyme shows the reverse specificity. In a second example, CYP86A1 when expressed in yeast gave greater activity

towards C16:0 FFA substrate than C18:1 substrate, with no activity towards C18:0 detected [61], a result consistent with a theoretical modeling study [60]. However, a cyp86a1 mutant showed the greatest proportional reduction in C16:0 and C18:0 DCAs. In addition, ectopic expression of this enzyme together with GPAT5 allowed the synthesis and incorporation of C16 to C22 saturated monomers into leaf cutin [20]. Can we infer from the *in vitro* substrate specificity that this oxidase will precede chain elongation from palmitate? These arguments suggest that, even with both mutant and enzyme activity data, it is not yet possible to produce a definitive description of the biosynthetic pathway.

The major missing pieces in biosynthesis

The previous section dealt with themes of monomer synthesis, namely acyl group modification and the synthesis of acylglycerols, which might be synthons (i.e. biosynthetic

**Figure 4.** Possible mechanisms and cellular locations of cutin and suberin assembly. The enzymes of monomer synthesis, including acylglycerol synthesis, are thought to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Polyester synthases (PS) are broadly defined as enzymes catalyzing the formation of ester bonds between monomers, and also between putative polyester oligomers or domains. Additional enzymes may also anchor the polymers to the cell wall (CW). The cellular localization of these putative types of PS is a major unknown. Four major mechanisms and associated routes leading from the ER to the external face of the plasma membrane are shown (a to d). In addition, two possible mechanisms of passage of lipophilic precursors from the plasma membrane (PM) through the apoplast to the final site of assembly and deposition are depicted for the case of cutin synthesis (i and ii). Similar mechanisms may be operating for suberin assembly and deposition, but are not shown. The mechanisms are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and not every possibility is shown.

Osmophilic particles have been observed in the outer CW of rapidly expanding epidermis and could constitute oleophilic droplets on their way to the cuticle. These droplets could originate from ER, in a way similar to the budding process proposed for the ontogeny of seed oil-bodies. (d) Golgi-mediated secretion vesicle mechanism. This would be a likely possibility if polyester domains or polymers were formed in the ER or if polyesters were attached to polysaccharides inside the cell. It is also possible that just a polyester attachment site is added intracellularly to CW polysaccharides. Mechanisms (a) and (b) would most likely accommodate transport of monomers or oligomers. By contrast, mechanisms (c) and (d) could also accommodate polymer domains. (i) Unchaperoned movement of lipophilic precursors or oleophilic droplets across the apoplast. (ii) Movement of monomers, oligomers of polymers bound to a protein carrier (e.g. Lipid Transfer Proteins, LTP) or after attachment to a carrier such as a CW polysaccharide.

concentrations and freely partitioning into membranes, would strongly interfere with membrane function and would therefore have to be chaperoned, channeled immediately to end products, or immediately exported from the cell. However, there is no evidence to date for a polyester synthesis metabolon.

**Polymerization reactions and transport processes must be considered together**

The greatest mystery concerning polyester synthesis is the polymerization reaction itself, both in terms of biochemical mechanism and intra- and/or extra-cellular location(s). Polyester monomers might be assembled, at least in part, through an intracellular process that requires activated acyl groups such as acyl-CoA thioesters. Early work demonstrated the acylation of isolated cutin with ω-hydroxy-acyl-CoAs, largely at secondary hydroxyl groups [73]. However, given that this *in vitro* reaction used presumed intracellular acyl donors with an insoluble, extracellular acyl acceptor, and given that no sequential (primary) ester bond formation was demonstrated, claims that an acyl-CoA:cutin acyltransferase assembles cutin *in vivo* are premature. By contrast, although it is possible to postulate a very different, largely apoplastic assembly process (see below), there is no direct evidence for this alternative either.

Clearly, any mechanism proposed for polyester biosynthesis must be consistent with that proposed for transport processes (*Figure 4*). For example, proposing that plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as those involved in cuticular wax transport [74], facilitate export of monomers (e.g. simple acylglycerols), implies apoplastic polyester synthesis, as noted by Bird *et al.* [54]. The limiting structural features of the transported lipid, which include molecular length and cross-sectional area, imposed by such ABC transporters are unknown. It is possible that larger oligomers or polyester domains, particularly if they are highly branched and synthesized within the cell, require a different transport mechanism. Such mechanisms would possibly require exocytic vesicles, or oleophilic droplets, as have been observed in rapidly expanding rice internodes [75]. Linkage to cell wall components before secretion remains a possibility. Indeed, given that polymer monomers and apoplastic localization vary considerably, polyester assembly and transport might use more than one mechanism. A knock-out of an ABC transporter gene, WHITE-BROWN COMPLEX 11 (WBC11, also known as ABCG11), not only reduced wax load, as had been reported for the knock-out of the ECERIFERUM 5 (CER5) ABC transporter, but also, unlike *cer5*, *wbc11* had a reduced cutin load [54]. Independent analyses of other WBC11 mutants confirm the importance of WBC11 for normal deposition of wax and cutin, and for cuticle formation [76]. It was therefore proposed that the effect on cutin is mediated through the direct loss of a transporter of cutin precursors. Biochemical studies will be required to test this hypothesis and to determine what molecular species are being transported. Given that ABC transporters can function as homodimers or heterodimers, the characterization of additional WBC family genes might be required.

Extracellular assembly

Ester formation between aliphatic carboxylic acid and alcohol monomers does not necessarily require activated acyl groups to produce polyesters. Furthermore, polymerization using lipases in organic media (at moderate temperatures) does not require rigorous water-stripping to drive esterification to produce polymers with high molecular weights [77,78]. Such polymerizations can also be carried out in aqueous–organic emulsions with interfacial catalysts [79]. Thus, although the apoplast is an aqueous domain, it seems plausible that monomers and/or oligomers delivered to the aqueous–aliphatic interface of the cuticular layer, where active lipolytic enzymes might reside, would be efficiently incorporated into polyesters (*Figure 4*). BODYGUARD is an extracellular epidermal protein with lipase domains, and it might represent such a protein. The *bodyguard* loss-of-function mutant displays a wide range of phenotypes that indicate disrupted cuticle function. It also has increased loads of cutin monomers and waxes [47]. This could indicate that there is an imperfect compensatory mechanism involving other proteins performing similar reactions, or that BODYGUARD is not involved in the synthesis of cutin chains but in some yet to be discovered function, such as cutin cross-linking, cutin turnover or lipid signaling in the epidermal cell wall. Other candidate proteins, if targeted to the apoplast, might include members of the monoacylglycerol or GDSL-motif putative lipases expressed in epidermis or phellem [53,55,56,80]. Alternatively, such proteins might be involved in endogenous, dynamic remodeling and turnover of the polyesters, a subject that has yet to receive any attention. A lipase-catalyzed polyester synthesis study using purified 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxy-octadecanoic acid monomer from birch bark suberin was directed at a biotechnological objective [78]. Nevertheless, this study might presage the type of assay needed to investigate apoplastic polymerization chemistries, using recombinant esterases and/or lipases with putative roles in cutin or suberin assembly and structure modulation.

Synthons, whether they are delivered to the site of polymer deposition as monomers (including acylglycerols), possibly bound to carrier proteins such as Lipid Transfer Proteins, or as larger oligomers or domains, may undergo more than just esterification reactions. Reactions of phenolic hydroxyls, aliphatic hydroperoxides or epoxides may produce C–O–C- or C–C-based polymer cross-linking, either within the lipophilic polymer itself or as anchoring to polysaccharide or lignin components of the cell wall. Laccases [55] or peroxidases [14,81] may catalyze the one-electron oxidation of phenolics. Epoxides may be produced intracellularly by as yet unidentified P450s [72] or by the action of peroxidases with acyl hydroperoxides as co-oxidants [82,83]. Epoxide hydrolases will produce vicinal diols, but it is unknown whether any apoplastic enzymes can also cross-link acyl epoxides. Finally, it is worth noting that the different chemistries and cell wall localizations of cutin, cutan and suberin might imply differences in transport and extracellular assembly.

**Regulation of lipid polymer deposition**

In the previous sections, we considered the identification and putative biochemical functions of biosynthetic genes.

Review

The expression of many of these genes will be coordinately regulated. Thus, analysis of gene expression will provide useful information on development-specific timing and tissue specificity of cutin and suberin deposition, the co-deposition of waxes and polymers, and in stress responses. It is important to realize that non-histological assays for lipid polymers are slow and require much material, and so monomer compositions represent average values over large surface areas. It is currently not feasible to measure variances in cutin and suberin composition on a micro-scale, yet variances attributable to specific cell types such as pavement, guard and trichome cells, regions such as meristems, and even to transverse gradients through cutinized or suberized cell walls might be crucial to biological functions. Therefore, gene expression, which can be resolved to a cellular level, might provide a guide to polymer formation in tissues, and at least suggests whether the effort of tissue collection through micro-dissection is worthwhile. In this context, we have recently used promoter-yellow fluorescent protein expression in conjunction with confocal fluorescence microscopy to aid the localization of cutin and suberin to the inner and outer integuments of the Arabidopsis seed coat, respectively [84].

Regulation of cutin and cuticular wax synthesis, and observations on cuticle permeability

It is clear that the intracuticular waxes play a dominant role in minimizing non-stomatal water-loss across the cuticle. Questions arise as to whether cuticular wax deposition is associated with cutin deposition, and whether both are related to rapid cell expansion. A study of Arabidopsis stem sections showed that the net depositions of both cutin monomer and wax are maximal in the rapidly elongating proportion of the stems [53]. In leaves of the monocot barley (Hordeum vulgare), cutin deposition was also associated with the phase of rapid leaf expansion, whereas wax deposition, although initiated towards the end of the expansion phase, was largely a later event [85]. Analysis of permeability in sectioned barley leaves suggested that cutin itself also contributed to the resistance to diffusion [85]. As noted earlier, cutan formation in monocot leaves appears to occur largely after cutin deposition [35]. By contrast with leaf and stem cutin, monomer analysis of Brassica napus seed coats showed that the deposition of both cutin- and suberin-like monomers occurred after cell expansion [84]. These differences in deposition imply differences in regulation of gene expression for waxes, cutin and cutan that are dependent on tissue, timing, species and polymer localization and function. They preclude the formulation of any broad generalizations.

Transcription factors regulating cuticular lipid biosynthesis, and therefore affecting epidermal permeability and epidermis morphology, have recently been identified. Three genes of the WIN clade of the APETELA 2-domain/ethylene response element binding protein superfamily of Arabidopsis were shown to influence wax levels, permeability and epidermal cell morphology, including pavement cell, stomate and trichome densities [86,87]. Ectopic overexpression of any of the three genes produced similar phenotypes. Paradoxically, cuticle permeability increased as wax load increased. In a follow-up study on WIN1, it became clear that the initial effect of WIN1 over-expression is the activation of a number of genes of cutin biosynthesis, resulting in increased cutin deposition [56]. These genes included LACS2, GPAT4, CYP86A4 and CYP86A7, which are clearly involved in cutin biosynthesis, and other genes for which the role is more speculative or biochemically undefined (a GDSL-motif lipase, an oxido-reductase, a glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase and an aquaglyceroporin). Induction of genes involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis occurred later. The increase in cuticle permeability was attributed to the increased cutin-load, causing a change in cuticular organization. By analyzing the expression profiles of these genes, Aharoni and coworkers [87] speculated that members of this WIN1 clade of transcription factors also control suberization, such as in abscission and dehiscence zones.

Future perspectives: linking polyester structure with biological function

The wide range of phenotypes, some dramatic, that occur in plants with altered cutin and suberin includes increased sensitivity to biotic and abiotic stresses, defects in development and growth, and changed morphology, permeability, seed dormancy and stomate structure. These highlight the central role that the thin hydrophobic barriers play in controlling many aspects of plant biology. To what extent can we identify links between specific aspects of polymer composition and the biological consequences mentioned above? In addressing this question it is important to re-state how little we understand about the structure and biosynthesis of lipid polymers. Polymer size, the origin of polymer insolubility, cutan and the assembly of the polyesters themselves are the most crucial aspects because they are least understood. However, despite the fact that we have yet to arrive at correctly ordered and biochemically defined metabolic pathways or detailed polymer structures, the rapidly increasing knowledge of the genetics underlying polymer synthesis provides opportunities to probe the link between the polymers and their biological function. To take a recent example, typical suberin monomers were introduced into cutin through the co-expression of GPAT and P450 biosynthetic genes [20]. Despite an increase in cutin monomer loads, and no change in wax load, permeability increased, not decreased, and the cuticle, as observed by TEM, became more diffuse. This result implied that the cutin organization was sensitive to perturbations that increase monomer loads. In addition, in gpat4;gpat8 lines, which have greatly reduced cutin loads, the formation of stomatal ledges was impaired [20]. These ledges are important for keeping water out of the substomatal chamber. Polyester engineering has therefore been demonstrated and, although still in its infancy and unpredictable, is expected to yield many structural, biosynthetic and functional insights.

AGORA initiative provides free agriculture journals to developing countries

The Health Internetwork Access to Research Initiative (HINARI) of the WHO has launched a new community scheme with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

As part of this enterprise, Elsevier has given hundreds of journals to Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture (AGORA). More than 100 institutions are now registered for the scheme, which aims to provide developing countries with free access to vital research that will ultimately help increase crop yields and encourage agricultural self-sufficiency.

According to the Africa University in Zimbabwe, AGORA has been welcomed by both students and staff. "It has brought a wealth of information to our fingertips", says Vimbai Hungwe. "The information made available goes a long way in helping the learning, teaching and research activities within the University. Given the economic hardships we are going through, it couldn't have come at a better time."
