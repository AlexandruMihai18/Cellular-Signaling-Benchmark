■ Abstract The mitotic spindle segregates chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell  
in preparation for cell division. Chromosome attachment to the spindle is monitored  
by the spindle assembly checkpoint, and at least in yeast cells, penetration of one  
spindle pole into the bud is monitored by the spindle position checkpoint. We review  
the historical origins of these checkpoints and recent progress in understanding their  
surveillance pathways. We also highlight fascinating but as yet unresolved questions,  
and examine crosstalk between the checkpoints.

for it never starts until all the chromosomes are in the equatorial plate, and it always starts as soon as the last one has reached it.” Bajer & Mole-Bajer came to a similar conclusion based on observations of mitosis in living plant endosperm cells (8). Callan & Jacobs described an intriguing phenomenon during meiosis in the spermatocytes of praying mantids (18). Male mantids are genotypically XXY, and successful completion of the first meiotic division depends on disjunction of both X chromosomes from the Y chromosome during the reductional division of meiosis. Approximately 10% of the time an XY bivalent forms and the remaining X chromosome is unpaired. Analysis of fixed and stained spermatocytes revealed that the cells with an unpaired X chromosome remained permanently arrested in meiosis, suggesting that a single unpaired chromosome can regulate the meiotic cell cycle. Zirkle provided evidence that spindle damage regulated the cell cycle through the analysis of newt pericardial mesothelium cells irradiated with an ultraviolet microbeam to destroy spindles (175). Irradiating spindles from metaphase cells displaced chromosomes from the midzone and dramatically delayed the onset of anaphase. He noted, “cells never start anaphase until all kinetochores establish a position on the metaphase plate,” and concluded that the arrival of the last kinetochore to the metaphase plate is the critical trigger for the cell to begin final preparations for the start of anaphase (175). The seed had been sown, but the harvest was delayed for another 20 years.

The identification of checkpoint components began with the genetic screens of Hoyt et al. (60) and Li & Murray (79), who identified yeast mutants that failed to delay anaphase when spindle assembly was impaired. These and additional components (12, 23, 160), along with their animal homologs, are summarized in Table 1. Skibbens & Hieter (135) wrote an outstanding review of the spindle checkpoint in a previous volume of this series, which discussed the isolation and early characterization of yeast mutants, the genes and their animal homologs, and the role of the kinetochore in the checkpoint. We refer interested readers to this and other excellent reviews (16, 29, 94, 98, 172) for details on earlier work. Below, we emphasize recent advances and highlight several unresolved issues in the field.

## What Is Monitored?

What event is measured at the kinetochore? McIntosh (90) proposed a simple model to explain how bipolar chromosome attachment to the spindle could control the onset of anaphase. He reasoned that with proper attachment came tension across the kinetochore, and he proposed that the lack of tension activated the checkpoint (90). An alternative model is that microtubule occupancy in the kinetochore, rather than physical tension, is measured (117, 159). Li & Nicklas (80) tested the tension hypothesis in XXY mantid spermatocytes that had unpaired X chromosomes (described above). They used a microneedle to apply tension on the unpaired X chromosomes in ten different cells that were arrested in meiosis I. Each time that tension was artificially applied, the cell entered anaphase within an hour. Control cells that were not manipulated delayed entry into anaphase for

an additional five hours. These experiments suggested that lack of tension was responsible for meiotic arrest by the spindle checkpoint in insect spermatocytes (80). However, the distinction between tension and microtubule occupancy is confounded because tension regulates microtubule binding to kinetochores, at least during meiosis (101).

Meiotic bivalents are joined by a small number of chiasmata, and both kinetochores can rotate freely and easily attach to the same pole, a situation known as syntelic attachment. If they were not corrected before anaphase, syntelic attachments would result in chromosome mis-segregation, yielding aneuploid germ cells. Instead, syntelic attachments are unstable and fail to recruit robust microtubule

bundles, allowing cells to correct these errors by detaching kinetochores and reattaching them to microtubules from the opposite pole of the spindle (101). Experiments in mantid spermatocytes showed that syntelic attachments could be stabilized by applying tension with a microneedle, implying the existence of a tension-sensitive activity that detaches microtubules when chromosomes are misoriented (7, 74, 101–103). This means that tension at a kinetochore is correlated with microtubule occupancy, making it hard to distinguish which of these is measured by the spindle checkpoint.

In mitotic budding yeast, each kinetochore is attached to a single microtubule, making occupancy an all-or-none affair (162). Sister kinetochores of bioriented chromosomes are pulled apart from each other in a microtubule-dependent manner, indicating that they are under tension (50, 110). To assess what would happen in the absence of tension, Stern & Murray examined cells in which DNA replication was blocked by depletion of the replication initiator protein Cdc6p (142). The DNA replication checkpoint normally arrests the cell cycle if replication forks have not finished replicating DNA, but in *cdc6* cells replication forks do not form, so the replication defect is “invisible” to the DNA replication checkpoint and the cells progress through mitosis (115). Because there are no sister chromatids, all chromosomes are presumably mono-oriented, so mitosis in *cdc6* mutants proceeds with microtubule occupancy but without tension at kinetochores. *cdc6* mutants exhibit a delay in mitosis that is dependent on spindle checkpoint components, suggesting that the spindle assembly checkpoint responds to the lack of tension in yeast (142). However, there are several uncertainties regarding these experiments.

If the lack of tension activates the checkpoint, why is there only a delay rather than a mitotic arrest in *cdc6* cells? Do kinetochores on unreplicated chromosomes behave similarly to those on replicated chromosomes? Did all of the kinetochores really remain continuously attached to microtubules, or were they constantly detaching and reattaching to microtubules, as seen with syntelic chromosomes lacking tension in meiotic cells? Recent studies identified a tension-sensitive kinetochore microtubule detaching activity mediated by the Aurora-family kinase Ipllp in yeast (114, 144, 145), and the mitotic delay of *cdc6* cells was dependent on Ipllp (13). This finding has been interpreted in different ways. It is possible that Ipllp wears two hats during mitosis, destabilizing attachments at kinetochores that lack tension and independently signaling to activate the checkpoint in response to lack of tension (13). Alternatively, Ipllp may simply destabilize kinetochore attachments, and the resulting (transiently) unoccupied kinetochores may trigger the checkpoint (145). Because transient detachments of individual kinetochores in the absence of tension may suffice to generate the checkpoint signal, these possibilities are very hard to distinguish. A similar uncertainty applies to assessment of whether lack of tension activates the checkpoint during yeast meiosis (129). Thus, the question of whether the checkpoint measures tension or occupancy at kinetochores in yeast cells remains unresolved.

In mitotic animal cells, sister kinetochores are closely apposed in a back-to-back manner that may limit syntelic attachments for steric reasons. Thus, a

tension-sensitive microtubule detachment mechanism for correcting syntelic attachments may not be required in such cells. Tension on mitotic sister kinetochores can be inferred from the distances separating them (136, 159). In cultured PtK1 cells, the distance separating the “relaxed” sister kinetochores of unattached chromosomes is approximately 1.5 μm, whereas that distance is stretched to approximately 4 μm following biorientation (159). In cells treated with appropriate concentrations of Taxol, vinblastine, or nocapine, altered microtubule dynamics cause cells to arrest with kinetochores that are not under tension but remain attached to similar numbers of microtubules (137, 159, 174). This suggests that lack of tension is sufficient to trigger a checkpoint arrest even when full occupancy is maintained. However, it is difficult to be sure that all of the kinetochores retained full occupancy, and because a single unattached kinetochore can cause arrest, this conclusion must be treated with caution. Interestingly, examination of the localization of checkpoint components suggests that cells can distinguish between stretched, relaxed, and unattached kinetochores.

# Attachment, Tension, and Recruitment of Checkpoint Proteins to the Kinetochore

Checkpoint proteins accumulate at unattached kinetochores in prometaphase, but disappear from kinetochores later in mitosis or meiosis (23, 24, 28, 65, 103, 173). In nocodazole-treated cells with depolymerized microtubules, there is intense staining for checkpoint components at each of the unattached kinetochores (23, 24, 28, 65, 158, 159). However, different checkpoint proteins behave differently when examined in detail. In particular, Mad2p staining at kinetochores disappears during metaphase once the chromosomes are attached, whereas BubR1p staining persists until anaphase (24, 28, 65, 103, 173). In cells with attached but relaxed kinetochores, most kinetochores show intense staining for Bub1p and BubR1p, but little detectable Mad2p staining (103, 137, 159, 174). These results suggest that there may be at least two independent binding sites for different checkpoint proteins in the kinetochore. Moreover, Mad2p accumulation at kinetochores appears to be governed by microtubule occupancy, whereas Bub1p and BubR1p accumulation appears to be governed by tension (although this does not explain why BubR1p is not released from kinetochores until anaphase). The finding that different checkpoint proteins respond to different features of kinetochore biology suggests that cells monitor more than one aspect of the kinetochore.

Injection of anti-Mad2p antibodies drives prophase cells into a premature anaphase and overrides the arrest induced by microtubule depolymerization, indicating that the checkpoint activation in situations with unattached kinetochores requires Mad2p (49). Given the reduced Mad2p localization at relaxed (rather than unattached) kinetochores in various other situations, is Mad2p also required for the checkpoint arrest in those circumstances? Injection of anti-Mad2p antibodies did override the arrest of Taxol-treated cells (159), as well as the mitotic delay of hypothermic cells (126). Anti-Mad2p antibody injection did not appear to override the mitotic arrest of vinblastine-treated cells (137), although injection of
a “dominant negative” Mad1p fragment did override the arrest (126). Thus, on balance it appears that Mad2p is important for checkpoint arrest under most if not all conditions tested [this is also the case in yeast cells (60, 79, 140, 142, 153)].

The finding that cells which exhibit little or no detectable Mad2p at kinetochores can nevertheless undergo checkpoint-mediated arrest suggests that kinetochore localization of Mad2p is dispensable for checkpoint arrest. However, careful examination of Taxol-treated cells revealed that whereas most kinetochores displayed little Mad2p, occasional kinetochores did stain brightly for Mad2p, raising the possibility that the arrest was triggered by the rare Mad2p-positive kinetochores (159). Moreover, if the amount of Mad2p recruited to a single unattached kinetochore suffices to cause arrest, an equivalent amount of kinetochore-localized Mad2p, distributed among the full complement of relaxed kinetochores, could also cause arrest but may escape detection. Thus, it remains plausible, although difficult to prove, that kinetochore-localization of Mad2p is important for checkpoint arrest under all circumstances.

# Ground Zero at the Kinetochore

Mutations that abolish the assembly of kinetochores at yeast centromeres do not cause mitotic arrest despite the failure of the chromosomes to attach to the spindle (44, 48). This result among others (29) indicates that a kinetochore must be assembled in order to detect whether it has correctly attached to the spindle. Checkpoint proteins are presumably recruited to the kinetochore through interactions with specific kinetochore components that can sense occupancy or tension, making identification of those components a high priority for understanding checkpoint function. A number of studies have addressed the roles of individual kinetochore components, using various perturbations. However, interpretation of such experiments is complicated by uncertainty as to whether the perturbation specifically impaired some function of the targeted component or more generally impaired kinetochore assembly. Distinguishing between these possibilities requires a comprehensive picture of kinetochore composition and structure so that the effects of any given perturbation can be accurately assessed. At present, the most complete such picture is provided by the yeast kinetochore, which is a complex of centromere DNA and at least 35 proteins (25). Approximately half of the proteins are encoded by nonessential genes, all dispensable for the checkpoint (87). Most of the essential kinetochore proteins have been analyzed by constructing conditional null mutants (44, 87), identifying seven different kinetochore proteins required for the spindle checkpoint. Three of these are part of the CBF3 complex that binds cooperatively to centromere DNA and forms the “core” of the kinetochore (25). In their absence, the kinetochore does not assemble, so the effect on the checkpoint is most likely indirect (44). The other four proteins comprise the Ndc80p complex (161). Mutants lacking either Spc24p or Spc25p are checkpoint defective, as are double mutants lacking both Nuf2p and Ndc80p (66, 87). In contrast to the CBF3 mutants, the kinetochore is thought to remain largely intact in these mutants (66, 87). Although several outer kinetochore proteins are missing from the
kinetochore in Ndc80p complex mutants, mutants directly affecting the missing outer components are checkpoint proficient, so the loss of those outer components is unlikely to account for the checkpoint defect (26, 71, 125). Thus, the Ndc80p complex, which is evolutionarily conserved (31, 86, 87), is an excellent candidate for the integral kinetochore component that mediates checkpoint signaling. One attractive model is that at least one checkpoint protein interacts with the Ndc80p complex to assess the state of the kinetochore and determine if chromosomes have established bipolar orientation on the spindle (87).

# Protein Kinases in the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint

Multiple protein kinases (including Mps1p, Bub1p, and BubR1p) and checkpoint phosphoproteins (including Mad1p) are required for the function of the spindle assembly checkpoint (27, 53, 119, 157, 160, 165) (see Table 1). In yeast, overexpression of Mps1p or Bub1-5p (a mutant form of Bub1p) causes mitotic arrest in the apparent absence of defects in spindle assembly (35, 54). The mitotic arrest in each case relies upon all of the other checkpoint proteins, and Mps1p-induced arrest requires Bub1p, whereas Bub1-5p-induced arrest requires Mps1p. These results suggested that activation of these kinases might be an early event in checkpoint signaling, perhaps leading to the recruitment of other checkpoint proteins to kinetochores. However, at least in the case of Mps1p, overexpression caused arrest even in mutants inactivating CBF3 components, indicating that under these circumstances, checkpoint components can cause arrest in the absence of functional kinetochores (37). It is currently unclear to what degree the arrest induced by these kinases mimics the situation in cells with unattached kinetochores.

The involvement of protein kinases in the checkpoint suggested that unattached kinetochores would induce phosphorylation of key substrates, and initial attention was drawn to Mad1p, which becomes extensively hyperphosphorylated in cells treated with nocodazole (53). Like nocodazole treatment, Mps1p overexpression also caused Mad1p hyperphosphorylation (54), but despite the similar mitotic arrest, Bub1-5p overexpression did not induce Mad1p hyperphosphorylation (35). Interestingly, Mad1p and Mad2p are concentrated at nuclear pore complexes in both yeast and animal cells, through interactions with the nuclear pore protein Nup53p (19, 64). Mad1p phosphorylation requires Nup53, but *nup53* mutants are not checkpoint defective (64). Thus, although correlated with checkpoint activation, Mad1p hyperphosphorylation does not appear to be required for checkpoint function, and the significance of Mad1p phosphorylation is unclear.

A simple reason for the involvement of protein kinases in the checkpoint would be that their catalytic activity serves to amplify the checkpoint signal, allowing a single kinetochore to cause arrest. Surprisingly, however, neither the Bub1p nor the Bub1R1p catalytic activities were required for checkpoint function in *Xenopus* (27). In yeast, a kinase-dead *bub1* mutant was reported to be checkpoint defective, but a *bub1* mutant that altogether lacked the kinase domain was apparently checkpoint competent (119, 155). These seemingly contradictory observations might be reconciled by supposing that Bub1p kinase activity is required to promote
a conformational change in Bub1p itself that allows the noncatalytic domain to function in checkpoint signaling. The role of the protein kinases and phosphorylation in the spindle checkpoint remains mysterious and is an important area of future research.

# Cell Cycle Arrest

The ultimate goal of the spindle assembly checkpoint is to prevent sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes achieve bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle. Sister chromatids are held together by cohesin complexes, and sister chromatid separation involves cleavage of cohesins by a protease called separase (52, 99, 149). Prior to anaphase, separase is restrained by the inhibitor securin, and anaphase onset is triggered by the degradation of securin, catalyzed by an ubiquitin ligase called the Anaphase Promoting Complex or Cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is a multiprotein complex that targets several proteins for degradation during mitosis, through associated specificity factors called Cdc20p and Cdh1p. Securin is ubiquitinated by Cdc20p-APC/C, whereas cyclins are ubiquitinated by both Cdc20p-APC/C and Cdh1p-APC/C. To delay anaphase onset when there are unattached or relaxed kinetochores, the checkpoint blocks Cdc20p-APC/C-mediated securin degradation.

Specific mutations affecting Cdc20p cause a dominant checkpoint defect, suggesting that the checkpoint prevents anaphase onset by inhibiting Cdc20p, through a mechanism that is rendered ineffective by the mutations (63, 73). The checkpoint component Mad2p binds to Cdc20p, and that interaction is eliminated by the mutations. The mutations map to a small domain of Cdc20p, and there is a similar domain present in Mad1p, which also binds to Mad2p (83, 133, 134). Peptides corresponding to that domain are capable of binding to Mad2p (83), and upon binding there is a conformational change in Mad2p. An attractive hypothesis incorporating these findings is that in response to kinetochore defects, Mad2p is exchanged from a Mad1p/Mad2p complex to a Cdc20p/Mad2p complex (Figure 1), which then either sequesters Cdc20p away from the APC/C or directly inhibits the APC/C, blocking securin degradation (83, 133, 172).

Experiments measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching show that checkpoint proteins cycle on and off the kinetochore at a very high rate (59, 72). Cdc20p also associates with kinetochores, and recovery times for Mad2p and Cdc20p are less than 25 seconds (59, 72). The transient nature of these associations suggests that the kinetochore has some catalytic role in Cdc20p inhibition, perhaps explaining how a single unattached kinetochore can lead to global inhibition of Cdc20p-APC/C. Interestingly, observations on PtK1 cells containing two separate spindles in the same cytoplasm indicate that unattached kinetochores at one spindle do not inhibit anaphase at the other spindle (when that spindle has successfully attached all of its kinetochores) (118). This result suggests that APC/C inhibition is spatially limited and cannot be truly global. Recent attempts to understand the basis for APC/C inhibition by the checkpoint have focused on the characterization of checkpoint protein complexes that can inhibit APC/C activity in vitro.
Inhibitory Complexes

Numerous complexes among checkpoint components have been detected by co-immunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments (94, 172). A majority of these complexes appear to be present constitutively, regardless of kinetochore attachment or tension. However, studies in yeast have identified two complexes, a Mad1p-Bub1p-Bub3p complex (15) and a Mad2p-Mad3p-Bub3p-Cdc20p complex (38) analogous to the vertebrate “mitotic checkpoint complex” or MCC (see below), which form transiently during the cell cycle at around the time when chromosome biorientation is being established. Both complexes accumulate in cells treated with nocodazole, suggesting that their formation is stimulated by unattached kinetochores. However, at least the MCC complex was still able to form in mutants that block kinetochore assembly, indicating that complex formation is kinetochore independent (38). Moreover, as mutants that block kinetochore assembly do not arrest the cell cycle (48, 147), the finding that the checkpoint protein complexes do form in these mutants suggests that formation of the complexes is not sufficient to cause arrest. Intriguingly, however, biochemical assays suggest that several checkpoint proteins and complexes can directly inhibit the APC/C (33, 34, 143, 146).

To assay APC/C activity, the APC/C is purified by immunoprecipitation from frog egg or cultured cell extracts, and supplemented with recombinant Cdc20p as well as an ubiquitin conjugation cocktail including heterologous ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. These components stimulate robust ubiquitination of an N-terminal fragment of a B-type cyclin, used as a test substrate. Mad2p and BubR1p can each individually inhibit the assay, and the MCC complex containing BubR1p, Bub3p, Mad2p, and Cdc20p also inhibits the assay (33, 34, 143, 146). In all cases, recombinant proteins or complexes are also inhibitory, suggesting that the inhibitors are active without need for special modifications or additional partners. Different proteins or combinations of proteins have different potencies as inhibitors, but it is not clear which, if any, of the inhibitors acts in vivo to enforce the checkpoint. One popular model is that unattached kinetochores stimulate assembly of the MCC, leading to APC/C inhibition (Figure 1). In addition to the MCC, cells contain a pool of Mad2p-Cdc20p complexes that appears to be independent of the MCC, and might act by sequestering Cdc20p so that it is unavailable to activate the APC/C (Figure 1). However, there are conflicting reports as to whether the MCC and Mad2p-Cdc20p complexes are present constitutively or only form upon checkpoint activation in vertebrates (172). If the complexes are present even without checkpoint activation, perhaps there is some way to restrain their activity when the checkpoint is not engaged.

Summary and Open Questions

The spindle assembly checkpoint delays the metaphase-anaphase transition until all chromosomes have attached to the spindle in a bipolar manner. Mutational disruption of the kinetochore abrogates checkpoint function, suggesting that the
checkpoint signal emanates from improperly attached kinetochores, and recent studies have focused attention on the Ndc80p subcomplex of the kinetochore as the source of the checkpoint signal. Cell cycle arrest is mediated by inhibition of the Cdc20p-APC/C ubiquitin ligase, which is prevented from inducing proteolysis of securin until complete biorientation is achieved. Checkpoint proteins all accumulate at unattached kinetochores, and form various complexes, many of which can stoichiometrically inhibit APC/C ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. The longstanding question of whether the checkpoint detects microtubule occupancy or tension at the kinetochore remains unresolved, but it seems clear that both occupancy and tension can affect the recruitment of specific checkpoint proteins to kinetochores in different ways. A popular though controversial interpretation of the results is that lack of tension and lack of microtubule attachment each exert regulatory effects on kinetochore components, causing them to act as platforms for the assembly of checkpoint protein complexes at the kinetochore. Catalytic generation and release of such complexes from the kinetochores then promotes global inhibition of Cdc20p-APC/C.

Although attractive, this simple model is not easily reconciled with many published observations. For instance, there is only weak evidence that formation of any checkpoint protein complex (as detected biochemically) is catalyzed by unattached or relaxed kinetochores; indeed, there is some evidence that complex formation is kinetochore independent. In addition, although several complexes form independently and can each inhibit APC/C activity in vitro, cell cycle arrest in vivo requires all checkpoint components, in every situation examined to date [with one reported exception (137) that has been contested (126)]. Conceivably, there is an as yet unidentified checkpoint protein complex whose generation requires unattached/relaxed kinetochores and all checkpoint components, and it is this elusive complex that mediates cell cycle arrest in vivo. Alternatively, different complexes may need to collaborate to effect a cell cycle arrest. As the complexes are stoichiometric inhibitors, it will be important to determine the relative abundance of the complexes, compared with Cdc20p-APC/C, in vivo.

Recent findings suggest that at least some checkpoint proteins may have other roles beyond the spindle assembly checkpoint itself. Mad1p and Mad2p are localized to nuclear pore complexes, but that localization is dispensable for checkpoint signaling, and it is not clear why they are recruited to that site. Might they be regulating nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of Cdc20p or other cell cycle regulators? Chromosome loss rates are greater for *bub1* and *bub3* mutants of *S. cerevisiae* than for *mad1*, *mad2*, or *mad3* mutants (155). Does that imply a role for Bub1p and Bub3p in chromosome segregation per se, in addition to the shared Mad/Bub role in the checkpoint? Consistent with that notion, *bub1* mutants of *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* are more sensitive than *mad2* mutants to the drug thiabendazole (165), and excess Bub1p and Bub3p can suppress a specific α-tubulin mutant allele (1). These phenotypic differences between Bub1p/Bub3p and Mad2p in yeast cells are reminiscent of the localization differences observed for Bub1p and BubR1p as compared with Mad2p at relaxed kinetochores in vertebrate cells. Conceivably,
Bub1p and BubR1p are recruited to those kinetochores in order to aid in “repairing” a kinetochore attachment that the cell perceives as defective, instead of (or in addition to) signaling to the checkpoint.

# The Spindle Checkpoint and Cancer

Cancer cells are highly aneuploid and there has been a great deal of speculation that impairment of the spindle checkpoint may be important for tumorigenesis (156). There is a clear and prevalent role for the DNA damage checkpoint in tumorigenesis as checkpoint genes such as p53, ATM, and ATR are often mutated in tumor cells. Mutations in the human *BUB1* gene were implicated in certain colorectal cancers characterized by chromosomal instability (17). However, a recent study shows that this class of colorectal cancer cells have a robust spindle checkpoint (148). A variety of tumors have been analyzed and in most cases only silent mutations have been found (45, 56, 95, 106, 121). There are some examples where mutations exist in spindle checkpoint genes in tumor cells but the incidences are sporadic and not predictive (120). There are no known cases of familial predisposition to cancer that map to a spindle checkpoint gene. There is an intriguing link to human T cell leukemia virus that encodes the oncoprotein Tax, which contributes to the tumorigenesis. Tax binds and inhibits Mad1p, and this could alter genome stability (70). However, as Tax has numerous intracellular targets that could contribute to tumorigenesis, the contribution by Mad1p inhibition is unclear (100). Mice heterozygous for a *mad2* deletion mutation are prone to developing tumors, suggesting there is haploinsufficiency for the spindle checkpoint (92). Therefore the lack of identified mutations contributing to tumorigenesis might be explained if there are other methods, genetic or epigenetic, to reduce Mad2p, or other checkpoint proteins by half. Other epigenetic explanations are plausible. The heterochromatin flanking the kinetochore is silenced by epigenetic mechanisms and there is a clear boundary between the centromere and the heterochromatin (29). The mechanism that specifies the boundary could fail sometimes, and the consequence could be the silencing of the centromere for one or two divisions. The result would be aneuploidy in those cells and the absence of the spindle checkpoint. Such an epigenetic mechanism would not be detected by mutational analysis.

# THE SPINDLE POSITION CHECKPOINT

In budding yeast, the mother-bud neck determines the cleavage plane, and accurate deposition of one set of chromosomes into the bud and the other set of chromosomes into the mother requires orientation of the mitotic spindle along the mother-bud axis (Figure 2). Spindle orientation is achieved through interactions of astral microtubules with polarized actin cables and cortical proteins (122, 123, 168). When these mechanisms fail, both sets of chromosomes remain in the mother cell, and the spindle position checkpoint delays cell cycle exit until this unproductive situation is corrected.

# Origins

The existence of the spindle position checkpoint was first suggested by studies of mutant cells lacking the dynein heavy chain (166). These cells frequently undergo anaphase spindle elongation entirely within the mother cell, and such cells appear to stop and wait until continuing spindle movements eventually deliver one pole of the spindle with its associated chromosomes into the bud. Only when that happens does the cell cycle proceed through spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. Based on these findings, Yeh et al. suggested that cells somehow “know” whether chromosomes are segregated into the bud, and that a checkpoint pathway forbids mitotic exit until successful segregation has taken place (166).

# What Is Monitored?

Spindle orientation relies upon the stochastic growth and shrinkage of astral microtubules, and is therefore subject to perturbations (like cold temperatures or toxins produced by competing microorganisms) that affect microtubule behavior. From a teleological perspective, it would seem advantageous for yeast cells to ensure that mitotic exit does not occur until both the mother and the bud have acquired one set of chromosomes. However, several observations suggest that the checkpoint monitors the entry of a spindle pole into the bud as an indicator of correct anaphase spindle orientation, rather than monitoring chromosome segregation per se. In particular, kinetochore defects can result in extremely unbalanced segregation of chromosomes to the mother and bud during anaphase, but such unbalanced segregation does not prevent subsequent exit from mitosis (44, 48, 147). Furthermore, in separase mutants sister chromatids fail to separate and the entire anaphase spindle frequently traverses the neck into the bud (89), but unlike the dynein mutants that retain the entire spindle in the mother, these cells undergo mitotic exit with apparently normal kinetics (10). Thus, cells appear to monitor whether one pole of the spindle enters the bud, regardless of whether the pole is associated with the correct set of chromosomes or whether the other pole remains in the mother.

Like dynein mutants, many other mutants with defects in astral microtubules, microtubule motor proteins, or cortical proteins important for spindle orientation are impaired in spindle orientation and frequently undergo anaphase spindle elongation entirely within the mother cell (108, 122, 123). Cells with defective motors or cortical proteins generally wait until one spindle pole enters the bud before exiting mitosis. However, mutants that affect the integrity, dynamics, or spindle pole attachment of astral microtubules do not always wait long enough, and many cells eventually exit mitosis without delivering one pole into the bud (2, 57, 97). A detailed study of cells that perform such “inappropriate mitotic exit” (meaning that spindle disassembly and cytokinesis occur while both spindle poles remain within the mother, yielding a binucleate cell and an anucleate cell) revealed that in most cases, one pole of the spindle had traversed the mother-bud neck into the bud prior to mitotic exit (2). However, instead of continuing into the bud, the spindle then returned to the mother cell, and both daughter nuclei remained there following

cytokinesis. This observation supports the hypothesis that cells know whether their spindle poles are in the mother or the bud, and suggests that even transient penetration of a spindle pole into the bud is enough to trigger mitotic exit.

In a small number of cases, mutant cells have been observed to exit mitosis, even though the entire spindle stayed within the mother cell and never penetrated into the bud (2). In these cases, astral microtubules that normally maintain contact with the cell cortex at the neck appeared to lose contact with the cortex prior to mitotic exit, leading Adames et al. to suggest that contact of astral microtubules with the neck cortex suffices to restrain mitotic exit (2). When a spindle pole traverses the neck, the astral microtubules no longer contact the neck, allowing mitotic exit. How do cells “know” whether a spindle pole has entered the bud, or whether astral microtubules have lost contact with the neck? Exciting insight into these questions has come from studies on the proteins that control mitotic exit in yeast.

## Control of Mitotic Exit by Spindle Position

In *S. cerevisiae*, mitotic exit requires the activity of a signaling pathway called the mitotic exit network or MEN (Figure 3), and studies summarized below suggest

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

**Figure 3** The mitotic exit network. The GTPase Tem1p cycles between GDP- and GTP-bound states, regulated by the GEF Lte1p and the two-component GAP Bfa1p/Bub2p. GTP-Tem1p binds to the protein kinase Cdc15p, which phosphorylates and activates the protein kinase Dbf2p. Mob1p binds tightly to Dbf2p and is required for its activity. In a poorly understood manner, Mob1p/Dbf2p releases the phosphatase Cdc14p from the nucleolus and contributes to cytokinesis. Cdc14p dephosphorylates Cdh1p, leading to activation of Cdh1p-APC/C, which triggers cyclin degradation and exit from mitosis. Cdc14p also dephosphorylates other substrates that result in cyclin/CDK inhibition.
that spindle position controls MEN activity. The MEN is analogous to the septation initiation network or SIN in *S. pombe* (9, 88, 96), but whereas both pathways are important for triggering cytokinesis, the MEN pathway also acts before cytokinesis to promote the destruction of mitotic cyclin/CDK activity and hence mitotic exit. MEN signaling is initiated by the small GTPase Tem1p (128), which is regulated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Lte1p (127), and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) made up of two components, Bub2p and Bfa1p (41, 46). Tem1p-GTP activates a protein kinase cascade that in turn activates the protein phosphatase Cdc14p (6, 10, 75, 85, 150, 164). Cdc14p then dephosphorylates several targets, including the APC/C activator Cdh1p, to promote the inhibition of cyclin/CDKs and degradation of mitotic cyclins to drive mitotic exit (67, 151) (Figure 3).

During most of the cell cycle, Cdc14p is sequestered in an inhibitory complex that is located in the nucleolus (the site of ribosome biogenesis) (132, 152). Cdc14p is released from the nucleolus by different mechanisms during early and late anaphase. During early anaphase, release is independent of MEN signaling, but during late anaphase, Cdc14p release requires the MEN, and if the MEN pathway is inactive, Cdc14p returns to the nucleolus (141, 169, 171). Examination of dynein mutant cells in which anaphase spindle elongation had occurred entirely within the mother revealed that Cdc14p was sequestered in the nucleolus in those cells (10, 154). This result suggests that MEN pathway activity is regulated by spindle position, and that the MEN is restrained from unleashing Cdc14p until one pole of the spindle enters the bud.

Consistent with the proposal that misoriented spindles prevent mitotic exit by inhibiting the MEN, artificial activation of MEN components overrides the checkpoint and triggers Cdc14p release and mitotic exit even in cells that have failed to deliver one spindle pole into the bud. In particular, both overexpression of Lte1p and deletion of *BUB2* or *BFA1* (manipulations that presumably increase GTP-Tem1p concentration and hence MEN activity) caused cells to proceed with mitotic exit regardless of whether or not a spindle pole had entered into the bud (2, 10, 14, 30, 111, 154). Thus, some component(s) of the MEN must be responsive to spindle position.

## Localization of Mitotic Exit Network Proteins

Insight into how the MEN is regulated has come from studies on the localization of MEN pathway components within the cell (Figure 4). Remarkably, all of the MEN proteins except Lte1p appear to concentrate at the cytoplasmic face of one or both poles of the spindle, at defined stages of the cell cycle (10, 22, 30, 39, 40, 51, 78, 82, 91, 111–113, 138, 150, 164, 169, 170). Mutations affecting the SPB outer plaque cause delocalization of MEN components and defects in mitotic exit, suggesting that localization of at least some MEN components to spindle poles is important for their function (51). At the end of anaphase, several downstream MEN components relocate to the mother-bud neck, presumably in order to regulate
some aspect of cytokinesis (40, 82, 138, 164, 170). Parallel localization studies of SIN pathway elements in *S. pombe* found that they similarly localize first to spindle poles and then to the cleavage furrow (88). In several instances, localization of a downstream MEN or SIN component to the spindle pole depends on the function of upstream MEN or SIN components. These findings suggest that the spindle poles may function as a staging area to assemble active signaling complexes that could then act at other locations to promote mitotic exit or cytokinesis. Spindle position could therefore influence the assembly of such signaling complexes to control mitotic exit.

The detailed spatial and temporal patterns of MEN component localization are complex and suggest the existence of at least two distinct sequentially acting spindle-pole localization pathways with opposite effects on MEN activity (Figure 4). Both before and during anaphase, Bub2p, Bfa1p, and Tem1p are concentrated at the spindle pole closest to the bud tip (111). Bub2p and Bfa1p are required to recruit Tem1p to that pole, where they presumably inactivate the Tem1p (111). In contrast, downstream MEN components are dispersed within the cell until some time during anaphase, when they are localized first to the spindle pole farthest from the bud tip and then to both spindle poles (82, 91, 150). Pole recruitment of these factors requires Tem1p but not Bub2p or Bfa1p: Indeed, deletion of *BUB2* or *BFA1* allows constitutive localization of downstream MEN components to the poles throughout the cell cycle. Thus, one spindle-pole localization pathway targets Bub2p and Bfa1p to the bud-directed pole, where they recruit Tem1p and inhibit MEN activity. At some point during anaphase, Tem1p becomes active and promotes a second spindle-pole localization pathway to recruit downstream MEN components to the mother-directed pole and then to both poles. This latter recruitment does not appear to require the presence of Tem1p itself at the poles.

A key question is how Tem1p becomes activated during anaphase. Strikingly, the only MEN component that is not recruited to spindle poles, the GEF Lte1p, is localized to the bud cortex (and is absent from the mother cortex) (10, 58, 69, 111, 124). Contact of the bud-directed spindle pole bearing Tem1p with the bud cortex containing Lte1p could therefore be the trigger that promotes Tem1p activation during anaphase. This hypothesis is extremely appealing because it provides a beautifully simple mechanistic explanation for how the geometric question of interest (has one spindle pole entered the bud?) could be answered and converted into an appropriate biochemical output (activation of Tem1p). However, that cannot be the whole story, because Lte1p is not required for mitotic exit, or for proper coupling of mitotic exit with spindle position, except at very low temperatures (2). Thus, there must be an alternative way to activate Tem1p, and to couple MEN activity to spindle position. Tem1p has an unusually high spontaneous GDP/GTP exchange rate (46), suggesting that activation could occur without a GEF, simply by lowering the Bfa1p/Bub2p GAP activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent studies have shown that both the phosphorylation of Bfa1p and Bub2p and their asymmetric localization to one spindle pole are regulated by spindle orientation, as described below.

# How Do Cells Distinguish the Bud-Directed and Mother-Directed Poles?

The asymmetric localization of MEN components to the bud-directed or mother-directed spindle poles raises the fascinating question of what guides the different components to specific poles. The initially asymmetric localization of late MEN components to the mother-directed spindle pole appears to depend on Bub2p and Bfa1p, because in their absence the late MEN components localize to both spindle poles (82, 91, 150). As Bub2p and Bfa1p are localized to the bud-directed spindle pole, they may transiently exclude the late MEN components from that pole. But how are Bub2p and Bfa1p localized asymmetrically to the bud-directed pole?

Yeast cells are born with a single SPB that retains at least some of its components during SPB duplication, so that each spindle has an “old” SPB at one pole and a “new” SPB at the other pole (163). In a series of elegant experiments, Pereira et al. examined Bfa1p localization in cells containing a marked old SPB (113). They found that Bfa1p was localized to the pole closest to the bud tip regardless of whether it was the old or the new SPB indicating that pole position, rather than SPB biogenesis, dictated Bfa1p recruitment. Using microtubule-depolymerizing drugs and mutants affecting the SPB outer plaque, conditions that reduced or eliminated astral microtubules, caused Bfa1p to accumulate at both poles, rather than just at the bud-directed pole. Similarly, spindle orientation mutants that underwent spindle elongation entirely within the mother displayed accumulation of Bfa1p at both spindle poles (Figure 4). In contrast, separase mutants in which the entire spindle moved into the bud (but remained oriented along the mother-bud axis) retained asymmetric localization of Bfa1p at the pole closest to the bud tip. Together, these experiments strongly suggest that interactions between the spindle poles and the cell cortex mediated by astral microtubules are responsible for generating the asymmetry in Bfa1p localization (113).

What difference does it make whether Bfa1p is recruited to one spindle pole or to both poles? This question is particularly perplexing, because even though Bfa1p asymmetry is clearly responsive to spindle orientation, it does not appear to be correlated with Bfa1p/Bub2p activity. Prior to anaphase, Bfa1p/Bub2p is active whether or not it is localized asymmetrically. During anaphase, Bfa1p is asymmetric both before and after passage of one spindle pole into the bud, which presumably triggers MEN activation. Thus, the role of asymmetric Bfa1p/Bub2p localization is enigmatic. Nevertheless, the work on Bfa1p localization has demonstrated that astral microtubules can affect recruitment of proteins to spindle poles, and presumably such effects could include regulation of Bfa1p/Bub2p activity in response to the transit of the spindle pole into the bud.

## Influence of the Cell Cortex

As mentioned above, the GEF Lte1p is asymmetrically localized to the bud cortex. Recent work has shown that perturbations of the cell cortex at the mother-bud
neck allow the spreading of Lte1p into the mother cell, where it can contribute  
to inappropriate mitotic exit in cells that have not delivered a spindle pole into  
the bud (21, 124). However, some mutations affecting septins at the neck caused  
inappropriate mitotic exit even in the absence of Lte1p, and Castillon et al. sug-  
gested that a neck-localized factor could act through astral microtubules to maintain  
Bfa1p/Bub2p activity at the spindle pole until the pole entered the bud (21). How  
might astral microtubules transmit information about spindle pole position? In-  
triguingly, recent studies have shown that spindle orientation factors are recruited  
to spindle poles early in the cell cycle and are then transported along astral mi-  
crotubules toward the cell cortex (81, 84). Perhaps other factors, asymmetrically  
recruited to the polarized cell cortex or to the neck, travel in the reverse direction  
toward the spindle poles and affect their ability to regulate Bfa1p/Bub2p.

# Regulation of Bfa1p/Bub2p by Phosphorylation

Both Bfa1p and Bub2p become hyperphosphorylated late in the cell cycle  
(61, 62, 76). In mutants that accumulate misoriented anaphase spindles within the  
mother portion of the cell, Bfa1p is not hyperphosphorylated (62), suggesting  
that the kinases and phosphatases responsible for Bfa1p/Bub2p phosphorylation  
might be regulated by spindle pole position. Recent studies have implicated the  
Polo-related kinase Cdc5p and the phosphatase Cdc14p as regulators of Bfa1p  
phosphorylation, raising the possibility that these factors may be responsive to  
spindle position.

Cdc5p plays multiple roles throughout mitosis and cytokinesis (3, 9, 11, 75, 109,  
130, 139, 141, 171). In addition to its other functions, Cdc5p is required for full  
Bfa1p hyperphosphorylation in vivo, and Cdc5p phosphorylates Bfa1p at multiple  
sites in vitro (62, 76). Phosphorylation of the Bfa1p/Bub2p complex by Cdc5p  
in vitro lowers its GAP activity toward Tem1p (47), implicating Cdc5p as a  
Bfa1p/Bub2p inhibitor, although Bfa1p/Bub2p inhibition in vivo appears to be  
complex and may require additional kinases (62, 76). Cdc5p is localized to both  
the spindle poles and the mother-bud neck (138), and it is attractive to speculate  
that the SPB and neck-localized pools of Cdc5p are in communication via astral  
microtubules, allowing the phosphorylation of Bfa1p and Bub2p (and hence GAP  
inhibition, Tem1p activation, and mitotic exit) to occur only when one spindle pole  
traverses the neck into the bud.

Cdc14p is released from the nucleolus in a Cdc5p-dependent but MEN-  
independent manner during early anaphase, and is required for full activation of  
downstream MEN components (68, 75, 91, 164). In addition, Cdc14p is recruited  
to the bud-directed spindle pole during early anaphase through an interaction  
with Bfa1p (112, 169). Cdc14p dephosphorylates Bfa1p in vitro, and *cdc14* mu-  
tants arrest with hyperphosphorylated, and therefore presumably inhibited, Bfa1p  
(62, 76). However, downstream MEN components are largely restricted to the  
mother-directed spindle pole (rather than both poles) in *cdc14* cells (82, 91, 150),  
perhaps suggesting that Bfa1p/Bub2p is not completely inhibited and retains the  
ability to exclude downstream MEN components from the bud-directed pole. Thus,  Cdc14p may dephosphorylate Bfa1p in vivo, and like Cdc5p, Cdc14p is in the right place at the right time to influence Tem1p activation during anaphase. In summary, candidate regulators of Bfa1p/Bub2p phosphorylation colocalize with Bfa1p/Bub2p at the bud-directed spindle pole and may regulate the GAP activity of the complex in response to spindle position.

# Summary and Open Questions

Spindle position controls exit from mitosis in *S. cerevisiae* to ensure that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromosomes. The target of this control is the mitotic exit network, and more specifically the activation of the GTPase Tem1p. The GAP Bfa1p/Bub2p recruits Tem1p to the bud-directed spindle pole, where Tem1p is inactivated until the pole crosses the neck into the bud. Current hypotheses invoke two mechanisms to explain how spindle pole position controls Tem1p activation. The GEF Lte1p is localized to the bud cortex, suggesting that contact of the Tem1p-containing spindle pole with the Lte1p-containing bud cortex triggers Tem1p activation during anaphase. Because Lte1p is dispensable for the normal control of mitotic exit, an additional pathway is thought to inactivate Bfa1p/Bub2p once the pole enters the bud. This pathway likely involves interactions of astral microtubules with the cell cortex (and perhaps specifically the neck cortex), which somehow affect the activity of Bfa1p/Bub2p at the spindle pole(s). There is evidence that Bfa1p/Bub2p activity is regulated by phosphorylation, and that Bfa1p/Bub2p phosphorylation is responsive to spindle position. The Polo-related kinase Cdc5p and the phosphatase Cdc14p regulate Bfa1p/Bub2p phosphorylation and colocalize with Bfa1p/Bub2p during early anaphase, making them attractive candidates to mediate this control. However, the mechanism whereby spindle position controls Bfa1p/Bub2p has not been determined.

The research reviewed above raises other open questions. How are the localizations of MEN proteins restricted to one spindle pole? It seems clear that astral microtubules control this asymmetry, presumably indicating that positional information derived from microtubule contacts with the polarized cell cortex is transmitted along the microtubules to the poles. But what is the nature of that information? Do specific proteins travel from the cortex to the poles? Or do astral microtubules exert asymmetric forces that influence the poles to which they are attached? SIN component localization to the poles is also asymmetric in fission yeast, in which there is no mother-bud axis (although there is an old end and a new end: Might there be an asymmetric cortex along this axis influencing which pole acquires the SIN?). What is the role, if any, of asymmetric pole recruitment in MEN/SIN signaling? And finally, how does MEN signaling from the poles cause the release of Cdc14p from the nucleolus? Possible hints at an answer to this last question come from findings that mutations in nuclear trafficking factors can alleviate the need for MEN signaling (5, 131), perhaps suggesting that the MEN affects trafficking of Cdc14p regulators into or out of the nucleus. Given the remarkably rapid progress in this field over the past few years, answers to these questions should emerge in the near future.
Spindle Position Checkpoint in Other Organisms?

Unlike budding yeast, most cells do not proliferate by budding and therefore do not face the geometric challenge of ensuring that the mitotic spindle accurately penetrates the narrow aperture of the mother-bud neck. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that spindle position checkpoints also exist in fission yeast and animal cells.

Cells of the fission yeast *S. pombe* are cylindrical and orient the mitotic spindle parallel to the long axis of the cell. Two reports have suggested that spindle orientation is monitored by a checkpoint pathway in *S. pombe* (42, 107). Partial depolymerization of F-actin (42) and mutations affecting the microtubule-binding protein Mialp (107) both cause misorientation of the metaphase spindle, and both also cause a delay in spindle elongation, suggesting that these cells spend more time in mitosis attempting to orient their spindles. However, both conditions may cause pleiotropic defects, and it is still not entirely clear whether the mitotic delay occurs in response to the spindle misorientation or to some other defect. The mitotic delay requires the transcription factor Atf1p, perhaps indicating that transcripts affected by Atf1p are important for sensing the defect or enacting the mitotic delay. In the absence of Atf1p, misoriented spindles elongate, and generally reorient toward the long axis of the cell during anaphase (107). Thus, it appears that the geometry of the cell in many cases causes the elongating spindle to orient correctly even if the normal spindle orientation mechanisms are faulty. Because of this, it is unclear whether a misoriented anaphase spindle would block exit from mitosis, as is the case in *S. cerevisiae*. Curiously, the “metaphase” delay caused by partial actin depolymerization was not associated with a delay in cyclin proteolysis, which normally marks mitotic exit (42). In contrast, *mia1* mutants with misoriented metaphase spindles retained high cyclin levels (107). Given the differences in cell shape and in the basis for the cell cycle delay between budding and fission yeast with misoriented spindles, it is difficult at present to draw meaningful parallels between these findings and the spindle orientation checkpoint in *S. cerevisiae*.

In animal cells, the cleavage plane is determined by the mitotic spindle, ensuring that chromosome segregation is spatially coordinated with cytokinesis regardless of spindle position within the cell. Nevertheless, spindle positioning near the cell center is important to ensure that daughter cells are approximately equal in size. Moreover, in many polarized cells spindles must be oriented correctly with respect to the polarization axis, as, for example, in epithelial cells, where orientation of the spindle is important for maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier (116). Examination of cultured rat epithelial cells indicated that astral microtubules actively position the metaphase spindle in the cell center and orient the spindle parallel to the long axis of the cell (105). Cells with misoriented spindles (due to stochastic factors or experimental manipulations) exhibited a small but significant delay in anaphase spindle elongation, suggesting the existence of a spindle orientation monitor acting to delay mitotic progression (105). The incorrect orientation induced by physical manipulations was always corrected by late anaphase, so it remains unclear whether improper anaphase spindle orientation would trigger a

delay in mitotic exit as it does in *S. cerevisiae*. Nevertheless, both animal and fungal cells clearly employ astral microtubules to achieve a desirable spindle position and orientation, and they appear to respond to defects in these processes by delaying the cell cycle.

# CROSSTALK BETWEEN THE SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND THE SPINDLE POSITION CHECKPOINT

The preceding sections have dealt with the spindle assembly and spindle position checkpoints as entirely separate entities, with the first checkpoint controlling the metaphase-anaphase transition and the second checkpoint controlling the exit from mitosis following anaphase. Clearly, it is expedient to ensure that exit from mitosis does not occur before anaphase, and in our discussion above, it was implicitly assumed that blocking the metaphase-anaphase transition would automatically prevent mitotic exit, but in fact, these two transitions are thought to be controlled by different forms of the APC/C in yeast, with Cdc20p-APC/C acting to promote securin degradation leading to anaphase and Cdh1p-APC/C acting to promote cyclin degradation leading to mitotic exit. When cells with unattached kinetochores delay anaphase by inhibiting Cdc20p-APC/C, how do they ensure that Cdh1p-APC/C-dependent mitotic exit is also restrained? A simple possibility would be that maintaining a short spindle due to continuing sister chromatid cohesion prevents the daughter-bound spindle pole from entering the bud, thereby engaging the spindle position checkpoint and preventing mitotic exit.

One of the spindle position checkpoint genes, *BUB2*, was first identified among the original spindle assembly checkpoint mutants (60). Later studies suggested that Bub2p operated in a “parallel branch” of the spindle assembly checkpoint (16), and the current view (as described above) is that there are two distinct checkpoints. However, if there are really two separate checkpoints targeting two separate cell cycle transitions, why were the checkpoint mutant screens successful in the first place? Treatment of cells with high concentrations of microtubule-depolymerizing agents causes both spindle assembly and spindle position defects, activating both checkpoints. Thus, a defect in only one of the checkpoints should not prevent the other checkpoint from arresting cells in mitosis. Nevertheless, the original screens for spindle assembly checkpoint mutants readily identified mutants that underwent sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit with depolymerized microtubules. Why were those screens so successful?

Synchronized populations of spindle assembly checkpoint mutants (*mad1*, *mad2*, *mad3*, *bub1*, *bub3*) treated with nocodazole undergo sister chromatid separation “on time” (at the same time as untreated control cells), and then delay transiently before mitotic exit. In contrast, *bub2* mutants treated with nocodazole exhibit a transient delay in sister chromatid separation. Double mutants (*bub2* together with *mad1* or *mad2* or …) treated with nocodazole progress through mitosis with no delay (4, 36, 39, 78). Why are *mad* mutants able to exit mitosis, albeit after
a delay, despite having a functional spindle position checkpoint that should block mitotic exit? And why are bub2 mutants able to separate sister chromatids (albeit after a delay) despite having a functional spindle assembly checkpoint which should block securin degradation? One possibility is that the Cdc20p-APC/C and Cdh1p-APC/C ubiquitin ligases can act on each other’s substrates. In mad mutants, Cdc20p-APC/C activation may eventually promote enough cyclin degradation to exit mitosis. In bub2 mutants, Cdh1p-APC/C activation may eventually promote securin degradation, allowing sister chromatid separation. This form of crosstalk could account for the successful isolation of single-checkpoint mutants in conditions that activate both checkpoints.

Several other observations are consistent with this crosstalk hypothesis. Cdc20p-APC/C contributes to cyclin degradation in yeast (167), and is responsible for degrading all of the cyclin in Xenopus extracts, which do not contain Cdh1p. In yeast, loss of Cdc20p arrests the cell cycle with stable securin and attached sister chromatids, but bub2 mutants can override the arrest, indicating that securin can be degraded by another pathway (147). This pathway presumably involves Cdh1p-APC/C, because bub2 mutants do not override the arrest of mutants lacking core APC/C subunits (75). The crosstalk hypothesis may also help to explain why cdc6 mutants, which lack sister chromatids and activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (see above), only transiently delay securin degradation (142). In the absence of sister chromatids, the spindle assembly checkpoint does not prevent spindle elongation, allowing one spindle pole to enter the bud and activate the MEN and hence Cdh1p-APC/C, which could eventually promote securin degradation.

There also appears to be some interaction between the DNA-responsive checkpoint pathways and the spindle assembly checkpoint. DNA damage of mitotic cells by laser irradiation induced a mitotic delay that was abrogated by injecting a dominant negative Mad2p (93), and the efficiency of the arrest triggered by DNA damage and stalled replication forks in yeast cells also depends on Mad2p (43). Does this mean that Mad2p also acts in a DNA damage-responsive checkpoint pathway, or could it reflect damage to centromeres (and hence kinetochores) under those circumstances, triggering arrest through the spindle assembly checkpoint? Bub2p and Bfa1p are required for effective arrest by the DNA damage checkpoint as well as the spindle checkpoints in yeast, and they appear to be regulated by different mechanisms in response to DNA damage (62, 154). Rather than relying on spindle position to prevent exit from mitosis, other checkpoints may signal directly to Bub2p/Bfa1p. It will be interesting to find out how extensive such checkpoint crosstalk may be.

## PERSPECTIVES

Our understanding of how cells monitor kinetochore biology as well as spindle position has increased greatly over the past few years. In both cases, it appears that sites of particular interest to the cell (kinetochores, spindle poles) recruit and somehow regulate a cadre of dedicated checkpoint proteins that restrain the activityof key cell cycle regulators (Cdc20p-APC/C, Tem1p) until certain requirements are met (kinetochore attachment/tension, spindle pole positioning). The striking finding that both the checkpoint proteins and the target cell cycle regulators localize (at least transiently) to the sites of interest suggests that much of the checkpoint signaling occurs in the immediate vicinity of the monitored sites. This may also be true for several other checkpoints. Sites of DNA damage recruit many checkpoint proteins, and although the target cell cycle regulators are predominantly cytoplasmic, they shuttle into and out of the nucleus, where they may transiently encounter damage sites. Moreover, DNA damage in one nucleus does not cause cell cycle arrest in another nucleus sharing the same cytoplasm (32), suggesting that, like the spindle assembly checkpoint (118), the DNA damage checkpoint is spatially restricted. The morphogenesis checkpoint in budding yeast may monitor the status of the mother-bud neck in order to detect whether a bud has formed, and in that case too, checkpoint proteins and the target cell cycle regulator are localized to the monitored structure at the neck (77). Thus, kinetochores, spindle poles, sites of DNA damage, and the mother-bud neck may all be busy information-processing centers checking that all is well before allowing continued cell cycle progression.

Despite recent progress, many fundamental issues regarding what exactly a particular checkpoint monitors and how that signal is translated into a cell cycle arrest remain poorly defined. Now that many of the players have been identified and characterized, the next few years will likely finally reveal these most intriguing features of cellular self-awareness.

SPINDLE CHECKPOINTS

![Diagram](attachment://diagram.png)

Figure 1 Catalytic generation of Cdc20p-APC/C inhibitory complexes by unattached kinetochores in the spindle assembly checkpoint. The kinetochore is shown on the left with the Ndc80p complex being the scaffold for recruiting checkpoint proteins. Black arrows indicate interactions that occur because of interactions within the kinetochore. Gray arrows are interactions that occur independently of the kinetochore.

Spindle Misorientation and Compensatory Checkpoint Delay

![Diagram of Spindle Misorientation and Compensatory Checkpoint Delay](#)

Figure 2 The spindle orientation checkpoint. In unperturbed cells (top), astral microtubules orient the spindle along the mother-bud axis and position the spindle close to the neck before anaphase. Spindle elongation then delivers one spindle pole to the bud and the other to the mother, leading to mitotic exit and cytokinesis. In cells that fail to orient or position the spindle correctly (bottom), anaphase spindle elongation occurs entirely within the mother cell and mitotic exit is delayed until the situation is corrected.
