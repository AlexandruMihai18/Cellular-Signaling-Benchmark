# Regulation of cell signalling by uPAR

**Harvey W. Smith** and **Chris J. Marshall**

Abstract | Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) expression is elevated during inflammation and tissue remodelling and in many human cancers, in which it frequently indicates poor prognosis. uPAR regulates proteolysis by binding the extracellular protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA; also known as urokinase) and also activates many intracellular signalling pathways. Coordination of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis and cell signalling by uPAR underlies its important function in cell migration, proliferation and survival and makes it an attractive therapeutic target in cancer and inflammatory diseases. uPAR lacks transmembrane and intracellular domains and so requires transmembrane co-receptors for signalling. Integrins are essential uPAR signalling co-receptors and a second uPAR ligand, the ECM protein vitronectin, is also crucial for this process.

### Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor
A glycolipid group added post-translationally near the C terminus of proteins containing a GPI anchor signal sequence. GPI anchors locate proteins to the external leaflet of the plasma membrane after secretion. The anchor consists of a phosphoethanolamine linker, a glycan core containing mannose, glucosamine and myo-inositol, and a phospholipid tail.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex assembly of proteins and polysaccharides that is secreted, assembled and modelled by cells and provides physical support and organization to tissues. Cells express plasma membrane receptors such as integrins that bind ECM components. These receptors mediate cell–ECM adhesion and regulate intracellular signalling pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. This intricate network of cell–ECM interactions is crucial during development as well as for normal function, remodelling and repair of tissues during adult life. Changes in the physical properties and composition of the ECM and altered expression or regulation of ECM receptors occur in many human diseases. In cancer, such changes are thought to contribute to the altered adhesive properties and aberrant cell signalling that drive tumour progression. In the context of cell motility, the ECM is both a requirement and a physical barrier for cell movement. Cell migration therefore often involves the coordination of ECM proteolysis, adhesion and signalling.

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is an important regulator of ECM proteolysis, cell–ECM interactions and cell signalling. uPAR regulates the activity of the plasminogen activation system, an extracellular proteolytic cascade (FIG. 1), by binding the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA; also known as urokinase) and its zymogen form, pro-uPA. Because it is associated with the external surface of the plasma membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor¹, uPAR localizes uPA and pro-uPA to the cell surface. Activated uPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen, generating the protease plasmin, which reciprocally cleaves and activates pro-uPA². This positive-feedback loop is amplified by concentration of the active and zymogen forms of uPA and plasmin at the cell surface³ through uPA or pro-uPA binding to uPAR and plasmin or plasminogen binding to multiple cell surface receptors. The plasminogen activation system is negatively regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1; also known as SERPINE1) and PAI2 (also known as SERPINB2), which inhibit uPA, and α2 antiplasmin, which inhibits plasmin. These serine protease inhibitors (serpins) bind covalently to their targets, inhibiting proteolytic activity⁴. Plasmin cleaves a range of ECM components, is essential for the degradation and clearance of fibrin blood clots (fibrinolysis) and activates matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), such as MMP3, MMP9, MMP12 and MMP13 (REF. 5) Accelerated cell-associated plasminogen activation by uPA–uPAR can facilitate cell migration through a three-dimensional ECM by enhancing pericellular proteolysis. Localization of uPAR to the leading edge of migrating cells exerts spatial control over ECM degradation by focusing uPA activity in the direction of movement⁶. Importantly, plasmin and MMPs can also release ECM-bound growth factors or activate latent growth factors⁷,⁸.

Many studies show that in addition to regulating proteolysis uPAR is a signalling receptor that promotes cell motility, invasion, proliferation and survival. Signalling through uPAR activates the Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the Tyr kinases focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2) and Src, and the Rho family small GTPase Rac⁹⁻¹². Other pathways, such as janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and phosphatidylinosotide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt, have also been implicated in uPAR signalling¹³⁻¹⁵. Although signalling through uPAR can involve

Figure 1 | Function and regulation of uPAR in the plasminogen activation system. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) binds the protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA; also known as urokinase) in its active and zymogen (pro-uPA) forms. uPA cleaves plasminogen, generating the active protease plasmin. Plasmin can reciprocally activate pro-uPA. Increased cell surface concentration of uPA or pro-uPA (by binding to uPAR) and plasmin or plasminogen (via multiple receptors) accelerates their mutual activation. Plasmin cleaves and activates matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Both plasmin and MMPs degrade many extracellular matrix (ECM) components and activate growth factors or liberate them from ECM sequestration. The proteolytic activities of uPA and plasmin are antagonized by the serine protease inhibitors (serpins) plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1; also known as SERPINE1) and PAI2 (also known as SERPINB2) and α2-antiplasmin. uPA–uPAR binding promotes clustering of uPAR in the plasma membrane, possibly in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains referred to as ‘lipid rafts’, and increases its ability to bind the ECM protein vitronectin. Complexes of full-length uPAR and its ligands interact with integrin co-receptors for intracellular signal transduction. uPA also cleaves uPAR in the linker between its first and second domains (D1 and D2), generating a soluble D1 fragment and a membrane-associated D2–D3 fragment. uPAR cleavage abrogates uPA binding, thereby inactivating the function of uPAR in proteolysis, and also inactivates or modifies the signalling functions of uPAR. Both full-length uPAR and D2–D3 can be shed through removal of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor by proteases or phospholipases.

uPA–uPAR binding, it is independent of uPA proteolytic activity¹⁶. A second uPAR ligand, the ECM glycoprotein vitronectin¹⁷, is also involved in signalling¹²,¹⁸,¹⁹. Being GPI-anchored, and therefore lacking transmembrane and intracellular domains, uPAR must cooperate with transmembrane receptors to activate intracellular signalling. Considerable evidence suggests that integrins, a major family of ECM receptors, are signalling co-receptors of uPAR⁹,¹⁸⁻²².

**Structure and regulation of uPAR**

uPAR is a member of the lymphocyte antigen 6 (Ly-6) superfamily of proteins that are characterized by the Ly-6 and uPAR (LU) domain, also called the three-finger fold³⁴. The LU domain folds into a globular structure with 5–6 antiparallel β-strands linked by 4–5 disulphide bonds³⁴,³⁵.

**Structure and ligand binding.** uPAR contains three LU domains, designated D1–D3, connected by short linker regions (FIG. 2a). Recently solved structures of uPAR–ligand complexes³⁶⁻³⁸ show how the three domains pack together into a concave structure (FIG. 2b). A large surface in the central cleft, containing residues from all three domains, binds uPA at its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD; residues 1–44). The vitronectin-binding site of uPAR is found in D1 and the D1–D2 linker. Trp32, Arg58, Ile63 (in D1), Arg91 and Tyr92 (in the D1–D2 linker) are crucial residues for binding to vitronectin¹⁸,³⁶,³⁹ in its N-terminal somatomedin B (SMB) domain⁴⁰.

Because the vitronectin- and uPA-binding sites are distinct, uPAR can simultaneously bind both ligands¹⁷,³⁶ (FIG. 2c), allowing coordinated regulation of proteolysis, cell adhesion and signalling. Importantly, in terms of crosstalk between ligands, binding of uPA to uPAR enhances vitronectin binding by uPAR³⁹,⁴¹. It has been

Matrix metalloprotease  
One of a family of secreted, transmembrane or GPI-anchored metal ion-dependent enzymes that digest ECM proteins and are produced in a latent (zymogen) form.

Growth factor domain  
The N-terminal domain of uPA (amino acids 1–49), which exhibits homology with the EGF family and mediates the binding of uPA to uPAR.

Somatomedin B (SMB) domain  
The Cys-rich N-terminal domain of vitronectin (amino acids 1–44), which interacts with uPAR and PAI1. Many of the same residues of SMB interact with both uPAR and PAI1; these interactions are therefore mutually exclusive.

proposed that uPA binding stimulates uPAR dimerization, with uPAR dimers having enhanced capacity to bind vitronectin 41–43. Intriguingly, fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent uPAR fusion proteins occurs at the ventral surface of cells cultured on vitronectin 43. This suggests selective vitronectin binding by uPAR dimers or tightly clustered uPAR, for example in plasma membrane microdomains 42 (discussed in the following section). However, all structural studies undertaken to date have failed to identify conclusive dimerization of uPAR and have clearly shown that monomeric uPAR is capable of binding to both uPA and vitronectin. Biochemical analyses using gel filtration, immunofluorescence-based binding assays and surface plasmon resonance have shown a 1/1/1 stoichiometry of uPA/uPAR/SMB complexes 39,41. These data suggest that mechanisms other than uPAR dimerization might mediate the effects of uPA on vitronectin binding by uPAR. For example, it has been proposed that uPA binding causes conformational changes that affect the vitronectin-binding site of uPAR, which is partially contained in the structurally flexible D1–D2 linker 17,36.

**Glycosylation and membrane localization.** uPAR is extensively modified by N-linked glycosylation at residues in all three domains 44,45. The function of these glycosylations is poorly understood, but they can enhance the affinity of uPAR for uPA 45,46, affect intracellular trafficking 46 and enhance the solubility of uPAR when secreted 47. The glycosylation pattern of uPAR differs between cell types 44,48 and can be altered in response to activation of signalling pathways, for example on activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol ester treatment 44.

The GPI anchor of uPAR is added to Gly283 (REF. 1), allowing cell surface localization. Soluble uPAR is released following removal of the GPI anchor by phospholipases 49 or extracellular proteolytic cleavage 50,51. Like other GPI-anchored proteins, uPAR associates with cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains, sometimes referred to as ‘lipid rafts’ 42. As described above, lipid raft partitioning of uPAR increases the ability of uPAR to bind vitronectin 42, possibly owing to increased vitronectin avidity of clustered uPAR in lipid rafts. Lipid raft partitioning of uPAR is promoted by uPA binding 42, revealing another mechanism by which uPA enhances uPAR binding to vitronectin. These lipid microdomains are also important platforms for signal transduction. Accumulation in lipid rafts might increase protein–protein interactions between uPAR, its co-receptors and intracellular effectors, enhancing downstream signalling. For example, disruption of microdomains by cholesterol depletion reduces uPAR co-immunoprecipitation with β3 integrin and inhibits associated signalling 52. Therefore, uPAR might preferentially associate with integrins and other co-receptors in membrane microdomains, or such microdomains might be required for uPAR to signal through co-receptors that are in close proximity but not in the microdomains themselves.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Energy transfer from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore on excitation of the donor, leading to fluorescence of the acceptor only when the two fluorophores are in close proximity (typically less than 10 nm). FRET is used to detect and quantify protein–protein interactions in living cells by expressing proteins of interest as fusions with donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins.

The orientation of uPAR with respect to the plasma membrane is unknown, and might be extremely flexible, as has been predicted for other GPI-anchored proteins.

REVIEWS

Proteolytic cleavage. Cleavage in the D1–D2 linker by proteases, such as uPA<sup>51</sup>, plasmin<sup>53</sup> and MMPs<sup>54</sup>, creates a soluble D1 fragment and a D2–D3 fragment that can be membrane associated or shed<sup>51,55</sup>. uPA bound to uPAR can cleave neighbouring uPAR molecules; therefore, clustering of uPA–uPAR complexes through GPI-anchorage and lipid raft partitioning accelerates this process<sup>42,56</sup>. Cleaved uPAR cannot support uPA-mediated plasminogen activation at the cell surface<sup>51</sup>, but its role in signalling is unclear. Abrogation of uPA and vitronectin binding<sup>51,57</sup> and integrin interactions<sup>58</sup> suggest that cleavage inhibits uPAR signalling. Indeed, association of uPAR with the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR; also known as IGF2R) enhances uPA-mediated cleavage of uPAR and inhibits uPAR-induced tumour cell migration and invasion<sup>59</sup>. Cleavage also inhibits endothelial cell migration *in vitro*<sup>60,61</sup>. However, cleaved uPAR might signal through pathways independently of uPA, vitronectin and integrins. The peptide sequence Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Tyr, near the N terminus of the D2–D3 fragment, interacts with the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1; also known as FPR2), inducing cell migration<sup>62,63</sup>. When shed from the cell surface, soluble D2–D3 is a chemoattractant for FPRL1-expressing cells such as monocytes<sup>62</sup> and basophils<sup>63</sup>. An uncleavable uPAR mutant has been used to discriminate pathways that are activated by full length uPAR and D2–D3 fragments<sup>64</sup>. However, the mutated residues lie in the vitronectin-binding site. It is therefore unlikely that this mutant signals in the same way as wild-type uPAR.

Monocyte  
A leukocyte of the myeloid lineage that phagocytoses pathogens and debris and releases cytokines, which modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. After migrating into tissues, monocytes can differentiate into macrophages (longer-lived phagocytic, antigen-presenting and cytokine-releasing cells) and myeloid dendritic cells (antigen-presenting cells that stimulate T and B cell responses).

Basophil  
A type of granulocyte (a myeloid-derived leukocyte that is characterized by prominent cytoplasmic granules) that is involved in inflammatory and allergic responses. Basophils secrete anticoagulants, proteases and pro-inflammatory molecules such as histamine and cytokines.

Clathrin-dependent endocytosis  
A pathway for the internalization of plasma membrane proteins. Receptor clustering in membrane domains containing a polymeric clathrin coat and a complex of adaptor proteins and GTPases leads to membrane invagination and scission to form a clathrin-coated vesicle containing the internalized receptors.

Chemotaxis  
The directional cell migration that occurs in response to gradients of soluble extracellular signalling molecules (chemoattractants) that bind plasma membrane receptors to activate cell signalling.

be through the localization of uPAR into nascent integrin-containing adhesion complexes<sup>60</sup>, in which it can signal through integrins or other transmembrane partners. Internalization and degradation of uPAR-associated PAI1 can increase pericellular proteolysis<sup>66</sup> and might enhance uPAR–vitronectin binding as PAI1 competes with uPAR for binding to the SMB domain of vitronectin<sup>75</sup>.

### uPAR expression

Under normal conditions, uPAR is thought to have fairly limited tissue expression<sup>76</sup>. Studies using mice and human clinical samples have identified conditions in which uPAR expression is induced. uPAR is expressed during ECM remodelling, for example in gestational tissues during embryo implantation and placental development<sup>77,78</sup> and in keratinocytes during epidermal wound healing<sup>76,79</sup>. Stress, injury and inflammation also induce uPAR expression. For instance, uPAR is expressed in the kidney during chronic proteinuric disease<sup>52</sup> and in the central nervous system following ischaemia or trauma<sup>80</sup>. uPAR expression is strongly induced during leukocyte activation and differentiation, suggesting a role in inflammatory and immune responses<sup>81,82</sup>. uPAR is also expressed by a subset of mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)<sup>53</sup>. uPAR-deficient mice, although viable and fertile, exhibit phenotypes consistent with these observations, such as defective leukocyte recruitment in models of bacterial infection<sup>83–86</sup>, amelioration of inflammatory proteinuria<sup>52</sup>, reduced brain damage in a model of cerebral ischaemia<sup>87</sup> and depletion of a subset of HSPCs<sup>53</sup>. uPA-deficient mice do not exhibit most of these phenotypes, arguing strongly for an *in vivo* role of proteolysis-independent signalling by uPAR. However, pathology related to the proteolytic function of uPAR, including dermal fibrosis<sup>88</sup> and exacerbation of experimentally induced kidney fibrosis and nephropathy, has also been observed in uPAR-deficient mice<sup>89,90</sup>.

### uPAR expression in cancer

uPAR is expressed in many human cancers including solid tumours, leukaemias and lymphomas (see Supplementary information S1 (table)). Expression frequently indicates poor prognosis and in some cases is predictive of invasion and metastasis. For a complete description of the clinical data the reader is referred to other publications dealing specifically with this topic<sup>23–25</sup>.

Importantly, uPAR expression in tumours can occur in tumour cells and/or tumour-associated stromal cells, such as fibroblasts<sup>91</sup> and macrophages<sup>92</sup>. Stromal uPAR expression can contribute to proteolysis in tumours, and signalling through uPAR in stromal cells might contribute to the tumour-promoting functions of the stroma. Elevated soluble uPAR levels in bodily fluids or tumour lysates also frequently correlate with poor prognosis in cancer, serving as a read-out of elevated uPAR expression in tumours<sup>25</sup>. Additionally, cleaved forms of soluble uPAR might indicate elevated tumour-associated uPA activity and might be an even better prognostic indicator than total soluble uPAR<sup>25</sup>. Whether soluble uPAR also has a direct role in tumour progression is less clear. Soluble uPAR D2–D3

Endocytosis and recycling. Cell surface expression of GPI-anchored uPAR is regulated by endocytosis and recycling. uPAR bound to uPA–PAI1 complexes associates with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1; also known as α2 macroglobulin receptor), leading to clathrin-dependent endocytosis<sup>65–67</sup>, lysosomal degradation of uPA and PAI1 and recycling of uPAR and LRP1 to the plasma membrane<sup>66,68</sup>. uPAR also associates with endocytic receptor 180 (ENDO180; also known as uPAR-associated protein and MRC2), a constitutively recycling collagen receptor of the mannose receptor family<sup>69</sup>. This interaction leads to activation of the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which regulate filamentous actin (F-actin) assembly and directional migration, driving chemotaxis up a gradient of catalytically inactive uPA<sup>70</sup>. However, an internalization-defective mutant of ENDO180 also carries out this function, suggesting that internalization and recycling of ENDO180 are not required for uPAR signalling<sup>70</sup>. Moreover, a recent study suggests that constitutive, ligand-independent uPAR endocytosis and recycling is clathrin-independent<sup>71</sup>, whereas ENDO180 trafficking is clathrin-dependent<sup>72</sup>.

Endocytosis and recycling have a complex role in uPAR signalling. Endocytosis can reduce the amount of cell surface uPAR available for signalling, thereby preventing uPAR-mediated Rac and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 activation and inhibiting cell migration and chemotaxis<sup>73,74</sup>. Conversely, other studies show that uPAR endocytosis and recycling can enhance cell migration. This might
fragments might have a chemotactic function. However, uncleaved soluble uPAR blocks the interaction of GPI-anchored uPAR with co-receptors such as integrins<sup>93,94</sup>, sequesters uPAR ligands<sup>95</sup>, decreases cell surface plasminogen activation<sup>96</sup> and inhibits tumour growth in xenograft assays<sup>96</sup>. Interestingly, other soluble Ly-6 family proteins are autocrine or paracrine signalling molecules. For example secreted Ly-6 and uPAR related protein 1 (SLURP1) and members of the prostate and testis expressed (PATE) protein family can activate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors<sup>97,98</sup>. The Ly-6 domain-containing proteins C4.4A (also known as LYPD3) and Ly-6K are GPI-anchored but are also shed from the cell surface of tumour cells, probably through similar mechanisms to those involved in uPAR shedding<sup>99,100</sup>. The functions of C4.4A and Ly-6K are not well understood, but their expression is upregulated in some cancers<sup>24,101</sup>, and soluble Ly-6K can promote tumour cell proliferation<sup>99</sup>.

**Clathrin-independent endocytosis**

A group of pathways for receptor internalization that do not involve clathrin. This diverse group of processes includes endocytosis of caveolae (membrane microdomains enriched in the transmembrane protein caveolin), pathways dependent on Rho and Arf family small GTPases, and mechanisms used to internalize large portions of membrane along with extracellular particles or fluid (phagocytosis and macropinocytosis, respectively).

**Proteinuric disease**

A disease that is characterized by the presence of excess serum proteins in the urine (proteinuria) owing to damage or dysfunction of the ultrafiltration system in the glomerulus of the kidney.

**Xenograft assay**

An assay involving the introduction of the cells or tissue of one species into a host organism of a different species. In cancer research, human tumour cells are often injected or implanted into immunocompromised mice to study tumour growth and metastasis.

**Alanine scanning mutagenesis**

The systematic mutation of individual amino acids in a protein to Ala, which has a highly unreactive methyl side chain and is thought to impose few conformational, electrostatic and steric effects on protein structure. The library of single amino acid mutants created by this technique is then used to analyse the role of each mutated amino acid in a particular function.

**Control of uPAR expression by cell signalling.** Many signalling pathways activate transcription factors that act on the uPAR promoter, driving uPAR expression in cancer. The Ras–ERK MAPK pathway is frequently activated in tumours by mutation or aberrant upstream signalling<sup>102</sup>. Control of uPAR transcription by ERK through activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factors is well documented<sup>103</sup> and contributes to the motogenic effect of Ras–ERK signalling in tumour cells<sup>10</sup>. Tumour hypoxia acts through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A) to drive uPAR expression through a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the uPAR promoter<sup>104</sup>. uPAR is required for the induction of an epithelial–mesenchymal transition-like response in breast cancer cell lines following exposure to hypoxia<sup>14</sup>. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) also activates uPAR expression, either indirectly through HIF1A<sup>105</sup> or directly through a non-consensus NF-κB-binding site in the uPAR promoter<sup>106</sup>. Transcription factors of the T cell factor (TCF) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) protein family link uPAR expression to the activity of the Wnt pathway<sup>107,108</sup>. The uPAR promoter also contains binding sites for specificity protein 1 (SP1) and AP2, both of which are implicated in uPAR expression in human cancer<sup>109,110</sup>. Thus, multiple signalling inputs can upregulate uPAR transcription in tumours. uPAR transcription in stromal cells is not as well studied, but uPAR expression can be induced in fibroblasts and monocytic cell lines by growth factors and cytokines<sup>111,112</sup>.

mRNA-binding proteins might be important for uPAR expression in tumours. For example, high expression of HuR occurs in several human cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis<sup>116,117</sup>. Loss of p53 function is, of course, a frequent event in tumorigenesis<sup>118</sup> and might also occur in tumour-associated stroma<sup>119</sup>. Accordingly, p53 inhibition in fibroblasts promotes uPAR expression and the release of soluble uPAR<sup>120</sup>.

### uPAR signalling through integrins

The identification of the transmembrane receptors that cooperate with uPAR is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of uPAR signalling. Many co-receptors of uPAR have been proposed, including GPCRs, ENDO180 and some receptor Tyr kinases (RTKs). In vascular smooth muscle cells, uPAR interacts with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB), promoting PDGF-independent signalling<sup>121</sup>. Several studies, discussed below, have also identified interactions between uPAR and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, it seems that the most important transmembrane receptors associated with uPAR signalling are the integrin family of ECM receptors (BOX 1).

#### uPAR–integrin interactions. Despite the controversy surrounding whether uPAR and integrins interact directly (see below), many studies show that uPAR signalling requires integrin co-receptors. Furthermore, some non-integrin co-receptors of uPAR cooperate with integrins in signalling or influence uPAR–integrin interactions<sup>122,123</sup>. uPAR localizes to integrin-containing adhesion complexes<sup>124</sup>, and co-immunoprecipitates with integrins<sup>15,125–128</sup> and integrin-associated signalling molecules such as FAK and Src family kinases<sup>9,125</sup>. An interaction of purified uPAR and α5β1 integrin *in vitro* has also been reported<sup>129</sup>, although other studies could not replicate these data<sup>130</sup>. Interestingly, integrins seem to confer specificity to the signalling output of uPAR. For example, uPAR–β1 integrin interactions are frequently associated with the activation of FAK and ERK<sup>9,21,131</sup>, whereas uPAR–β3 integrin interactions are associated with the activation of Rac<sup>19,52</sup>. A recent study also demonstrated crosstalk between separate uPAR–integrin pathways, with the ERK signal provided by uPAR–β1 integrin signalling being necessary for subsequent activation of Rac through uPAR–β3 integrin<sup>19</sup>. uPAR–integrin co-immunoprecipitation and cell signalling are inhibited by treatment with peptides that correspond to the integrin sequences thought to mediate the integrin–uPAR interaction, including part of the β-propeller of the αM and α3 integrin subunits<sup>125,132</sup> and a region of the β1 integrin subunit that has been proposed to reside in an exposed loop<sup>129</sup>. Regions in the uPAR D3 might form a corresponding binding site for α3β1 and α5β1 integrins<sup>21,133</sup>, and the D2 domain might be involved in the uPAR binding to αvβ3 integrin<sup>15</sup>. However, it is important to bear in mind that these approaches do not prove a physical interaction between uPAR and integrins, and the existence of direct uPAR–integrin binding has recently been questioned. Studies using alanine scanning mutagenesis have shown that only residues of the vitronectin-binding

**Control of uPAR expression by mRNA binding proteins.** uPAR expression is also regulated post-transcriptionally by proteins that bind PLAUR mRNA (which encodes uPAR) and affect its stability. PLAUR mRNA is unstable owing to the presence of an AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR). The RNA binding proteins Hu antigen R (HuR; also known as ELAV1) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNPC) bind to the ARE and stabilize PLAUR mRNA<sup>113,114</sup>. Other proteins, such as the tumour suppressor p53, which binds a 37 nucleotide element in the 3′ UTR<sup>115</sup>, can accelerate PLAUR mRNA degradation. Alterations in

Box 1 | Cell signalling through integrins

Integrins are transmembrane receptors for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, laminins and vitronectin. In humans, 18 α- and 8 β-subunits form 24 non-covalently associated α–β heterodimers. Each subunit has a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic domain (see the figure). Integrin affinity for ligands is controlled by the binding of particular proteins (for example, talin) to the β-cytoplasmic domain, inducing conformational changes that activate ligand binding by the extracellular domains (inside-out signalling). Ligand binding triggers the propagation of extracellular conformational changes across the plasma membrane to the cytoplasmic domains, activating intracellular (outside-in) signalling. The cytoplasmic domains lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and act as scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein signalling complexes. Direct cytoplasmic tail-binding proteins (for example, talin, vinculin and paxillin) act as adaptors and also link integrins to the cytoskeleton by binding filamentous actin (F-actin). Tyr kinases, particularly focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2) and Src, are recruited to integrin-containing adhesion complexes, where they phosphorylate many substrates. Adaptor proteins including p130Cas (also known as BCAR1), CRK, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)–PINCH–parvin (IPP) complex (which might also have kinase activity through ILK) then bind phosphorylated Tyr sites or protein–protein interaction motifs in these complexes, recruiting signalling molecules such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factors son of sevenless 1 (SOS1), dedicator of cytokinesis protein 1 (DOCK1; also known as DOCK180), C3G (also known as RAPGEF1) and PAK-interacting exchange factor (PIX). These coordinated events activate Ras–mitogen activated protein kinase signalling, Rho family and Rap GTPases, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway, and many others. Integrins are therefore powerful signalling receptors, driving actin cytoskeletal remodelling and cell motility, proliferation and survival in response to the ECM. They also associate with other plasma membrane proteins, such as receptor Tyr kinases (RTKs) for coordinated signalling, and with matrix metalloproteases to connect ECM degradation with cell adhesion and signalling. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) might affect many aspects of integrin function by regulating activation, signalling, integrin–RTK interactions and pericellular ECM proteolysis. EGF, epidermal growth factor; PSI, plexin–semaphorin–integrin domain.

dispensable for this response; however, integrin binding to vitronectin is still required for uPAR signalling. The authors of this study propose that uPAR binding to vitronectin activates integrin signalling by simply increasing plasma membrane–ECM contact, facilitating integrin–ligand interactions¹⁸.

uPAR signalling through MAC1. The first uPAR–integrin interaction to be described involved MAC1 (also known as αMβ2 integrin)¹³⁴. MAC1 is expressed primarily in leukocytes, where it regulates migration, differentiation and phagocytosis. MAC1 and uPAR colocalize in monocytes and neutrophils and can be co-immunoprecipitated¹²⁶,¹³²,¹³⁵. This interaction modifies cell–ECM adhesion, increasing binding to the MAC1 ligand fibrinogen¹³⁶ or promoting adhesion to vitronectin¹³⁷. uPAR expression also stimulates MAC1-driven neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis *in vitro*¹³⁸,¹³⁹. uPAR-deficient mice display impaired neutrophil infiltration of the lungs in models of pulmonary infection⁸³,⁸⁵,⁸⁶. Although blocking antibodies against β2 integrin reduce leukocyte recruitment to the lungs of wild-type mice, they have no additional effect in uPAR-deficient mice⁸³,⁸⁵. uPA deficiency also has no effect on leukocyte recruitment in these models, and uPAR–MAC1 signalling does not require uPA *in vitro*¹³⁸,¹³⁹. Taken together, these data argue that uPAR and β2 integrin cooperate for uPA-independent signalling during inflammatory responses *in vivo*.

Mechanistically, uPAR–MAC1 signalling can contribute to the adhesion of macrophages and neutrophils to endothelial cells, a prerequisite for extravasation⁸³,⁸⁵. The underlying signalling mechanisms are not well characterized, but signalling through the uPAR–MAC1 interaction seems to involve Src family kinases¹²⁶. In the tumour microenvironment, which is often rich in leukocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils, the potential involvement of uPAR–MAC1 in leukocyte recruitment is an interesting issue. Such tumour-associated leukocytes are important drivers of tumour behaviour, including metastasis¹⁴⁰.

uPAR–β1 integrin signalling. α5β1 integrin is a fibronectin receptor and α3β1 integrin is a laminin receptor. Several studies have shown co-immunoprecipitation of these integrins with uPAR¹²⁵,¹²⁷, suggesting that they form complexes with uPAR. Fibronectin binding by α5β1 integrin is enhanced by uPAR¹²⁷,¹⁴¹ and the assembly of integrin-bound fibronectin into insoluble structures during fibronectin fibrillogenesis¹⁴² is enhanced by uPA–uPAR. Similarly, signalling through α5β1 integrin¹⁴³,¹⁴⁴ is enhanced by uPA–uPAR (FIG. 3a), leading to tumour cell proliferation in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Interestingly, cells lacking uPAR enter a dormant state¹²⁷,¹⁴⁴, which suggests an important role for uPAR in determining whether tumour cells proliferate or become dormant. Signalling events downstream of uPAR–β1 integrin interactions promote Tyr phosphorylation of FAK, leading to activation of the Ras–ERK pathway⁹,¹³¹. Src also co-immunoprecipitates with uPAR–β1 integrin complexes¹²² and is activated by uPAR signalling through both α5β1 and α3β1 integrins⁹,²² (FIG. 3a,b).

Figure 3 | uPAR–β1 integrin signalling. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) signals through α5β1 and α3β1 integrins in fibroblasts, kidney epithelial cell lines and some carcinoma cells. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA; also known as urokinase) binding to uPAR is required for signalling through β1 integrins. **a** | A physical association of uPAR and α5β1 integrin is implicated in fibronectin fibrillogenesis. Subsequent adhesion to insoluble fibronectin fibrils and the association of uPAR and α5β1 integrin with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) causes activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2), through autophosphorylation on Tyr397, and Src. This leads to downstream activation of Ras and the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). uPAR–β1 integrin–EGFR signalling is strongly linked with ERK-dependent tumour cell proliferation, emergence from dormancy and transcription of ERK targets such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), enhancing ECM proteolysis, and uPAR expression. In keratinocytes, laminin 5 secretion is also stimulated by uPAR signalling pathways involving EGFR, promoting epidermal wound healing. **b** | uPAR–α3β1 integrin complexes are proposed to bind laminin and vitronectin. Signalling downstream of uPAR and α3β1 integrin is associated with the disruption of cell–cell junctions and the development of an epithelial–mesenchymal transition-like phenotype through Src activation. The Ras–MAPK kinase pathway is also activated by uPAR–α3β1 integrin signalling, and enhances pericellular proteolysis through the transcription of uPA. MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase.

The importance of FAK and Src for downstream signalling is revealed by studies showing that their inhibition blocks fibronectin fibrillogenesis, proliferation and the cell migration induced by uPAR–β1 integrin signalling<sup>9,22,131,143</sup>. uPAR–β1 integrin signalling to ERK and Src increases the expression of uPA and MMPs through AP1 transcription factors<sup>133,145,146</sup>. This suggests that uPAR signalling through β1 integrins can contribute to invasion by increasing pericellular proteolysis.

Signalling through uPAR and β1 integrin can also involve EGFR, demonstrating a complex interplay between uPAR, integrins and RTKs. Co-immunoprecipitation of EGFR with α5β1 integrin is increased by uPAR expression, suggesting that uPAR potentiates their interaction<sup>131</sup>. uPAR–α5β1 integrin signalling to FAK results in EGFR activation<sup>9,131</sup> and ERK activation by uPAR–α5β1 integrin is blocked by EGFR kinase inhibitors<sup>131</sup>. This suggests that EGFR is required for the ERK activation and proliferation that is driven by uPAR–β1 integrin interactions. Phosphorylation of Tyr845 of EGFR by Src is an important event downstream of uPAR–β1 integrin signalling<sup>143</sup> and enhances ERK activation and proliferation when uPAR-expressing cells are treated with EGF<sup>147</sup>. However, EGFR kinase inhibitors do not affect uPAR-driven Rac activation, suggesting that other uPAR signalling pathways are EGFR-independent<sup>148</sup>, perhaps because they involve different integrins. Interestingly,

EGFR stimulation of the Ras–MAPK pathway can drive uPAR expression, suggesting a positive-feedback loop regulates uPAR expression. Accordingly, treatment of tumour cell lines with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab leads to downregulation of uPAR expression<sup>149</sup>. uPAR and EGFR might also cooperate in normal cells as keratinocytes derived from uPAR-deficient mice fail to activate ERK or secrete laminin 5 in response to EGF, impairing keratinocyte migration and epidermal wound healing<sup>150</sup>.

uPAR–β3 integrin signalling. β3 integrin forms heterodimers with the αv and αIIb integrin subunits that bind several ECM ligands including vitronectin, fibronectin, osteopontin and fibrinogen. αvβ3 integrin can be co-immunoprecipitated with uPAR and has been strongly implicated in uPAR signalling<sup>15,52,59,151</sup>. Both uPAR and β3 integrins bind vitronectin, with uPAR recognizing the SMB domain and β3 integrins the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence of vitronectin. Vitronectin is often co-expressed with uPAR and β3 integrin in tumours<sup>152</sup>. Interestingly, vitronectin is not expressed in normal brain but is expressed in gliomas<sup>153</sup>. Many pathways regulating uPAR transcription also promote the expression of β3 integrin, including the Ras–MAPK pathway<sup>154</sup> and HIF1A<sup>155</sup>. Also, in some cells uPAR signalling promotes the cell surface expression of αvβ3 integrin<sup>19,59</sup>.

(DOCK1; also known as DOCK180) for Rac activation and invasion at sites of uPAR–β3 integrin signalling¹⁹. uPAR–β1 integrin signalling is not required for Rac activation in kidney podocytes or tumour cells in these studies, further emphasizing the distinct roles of uPAR–β1 integrin and uPAR–β3 integrin signalling. In the studies discussed above, Rac activation by uPAR–β3 integrin signalling in tumour cells and podocytes is vitronectin-dependent. This is consistent with other data showing that uPAR and integrins must both engage vitronectin to drive cell protrusions and motility¹⁸. Interestingly, one study has suggested a direct pathway linking uPAR–β1 integrin interactions to Rac activation in some cell lines¹³³,¹⁴⁶. This pathway was activated by cell adhesion to fibronectin through α5β1 integrin. However, several other studies have found that uPAR-driven Rac activation and cell morphology changes do not occur on fibronectin¹²,¹⁸,¹⁹. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, and the potential for multiple pathways mediating Rac activation by uPAR remains a possibility that is under investigation.

### Models of uPAR–integrin signalling

Defining how uPAR and integrins work together is important for understanding uPAR-driven signalling. Whether uPAR directly interacts with integrins or acts indirectly by increasing cell–ECM adhesion is a matter of debate.

### Does uPAR affect integrin conformation?

Integrins can assume several conformations, with activation of ligand binding often associated with extension of the extracellular domains¹⁵⁸ (FIG. 5a). In some cells, uPAR expression increases the binding of antibodies that specifically detect these conformations of β1 and β3 integrins⁵²,¹⁴¹. Conversely, other studies show that uPAR expression decreases the binding of integrin ‘activation-specific’ antibodies while still promoting ligand-binding through β1 and β2 integrins¹²⁹,¹⁵⁹. This has led to speculation that association with uPAR leads to an activated integrin conformation retaining an overall ‘bent’ structure (FIG. 5b). A recent report used integrin conformation-specific antibodies and FRET to show that uPAR directly modifies the conformation of MAC1 but does not cause extension of the extracellular domains¹⁵⁹. However, uPAR induces an outward rotation of the extracellular β2 integrin hybrid domain and the separation of the transmembrane regions of αM and β2 integrins. These uPA-independent conformational changes activate ligand binding by MAC1 and are consistent with outside-in signal transduction. Whether uPAR causes distinct conformational changes in other integrin subunits and how this relates to cell signalling remains to be determined.

### How does uPAR interact with integrins?

Studies using site-directed mutagenesis have questioned the relevance of direct uPAR–integrin interactions, asserting that uPAR activates integrin signalling solely by enhancing cell–ECM contact through vitronectin binding (FIG. 5c). However, the assumption that single amino acid

Figure 4 | **uPAR–β3 integrin signalling.** Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) signals through β3 integrins to stimulate cell motility and invasion in human tumour cells and murine kidney podocytes. Vitronectin (in the extracellular matrix (ECM)), which binds uPAR and β3 integrins, is required for the activity of this pathway. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA; also known as urokinase) does not seem to have an important role in uPAR signalling through β3 integrin. Src kinases are activated by the uPAR–β3 integrin interaction. This leads to Tyr phosphorylation of the substrate domain of p130Cas (also known as BCAR1), a focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2)-associated adaptor protein. A second adaptor, CRK, can then be recruited through binding of its SH2 domain to phosphorylated p130Cas. The p130Cas–CRK complex brings the CRK-associated Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor dedicator of cytokinesis protein 1 (DOCK1; also known as DOCK180) to sites of uPAR–β3 integrin signalling. Activated Rac can then stimulate actin polymerization and membrane protrusion, leading to cell motility and invasion. In mouse kidney podocytes, uPAR–αvβ3 integrin signalling also activates the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 by an uncharacterized, vitronectin-dependent pathway. uPAR signalling through αvβ3 integrin is inhibited by uPA-mediated uPAR cleavage, a process accelerated by association of uPAR with the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR; also known as IGF2R). F-actin, filamentous actin; G-actin, globular actin.

The uPAR–β3 integrin interaction has an important role in signalling for cell migration through activation of the Rho family small GTPase Rac (FIG. 4). Blockade of uPAR function in tumour cell lines inhibits Rac activation and cell motility, whereas ectopic expression of uPAR drives Rac activation¹⁰,¹²,¹⁴,¹⁹,¹⁴⁸. The binding of activated Rac to its effector SRA1 (also known as SCAF1) signals to the WAVE complex to promote F-actin assembly at the leading edge of migrating cells through the ARP2/3 actin nucleation factor¹⁵⁶. This causes extension of membrane protrusions that are crucial for the elongated mesenchymal mode of cell motility¹⁵⁷. Two recent studies have provided insight into the mechanism of Rac activation by uPAR. In mouse kidney podocytes *in vivo* and *in vitro*, treatment with lipopolysaccharide induces uPAR expression, leading to activation of αvβ3 integrin, Rac-driven cell motility and proteinuria. These events do not occur in the podocytes of uPAR-deficient mice⁵². In uPAR-expressing tumour cells, uPAR signals through β3 integrin to activate Src, leading to phosphorylation of the substrate domain of the adaptor protein p130Cas (also known as BCAR1) and subsequent binding of a second adaptor, CRK, through its SH2 domain¹⁹. The p130Cas–CRK complex recruits the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor dedicator of cytokinesis protein 1

substitutions in uPAR can block all interactions with integrins might not be valid, and even the combined Ala substitutions introduced by Madsen *et al.*¹⁸ might not completely disrupt such interactions. uPAR can dramatically increase cell adhesion to vitronectin, particularly when ectopically expressed¹⁷,¹⁸,¹⁶⁰. However, it is unclear whether this effect is due solely to uPAR–vitronectin interactions or whether it also involves activation of vitronectin-binding integrins that directly bind uPAR. Also, in some tumour cells endogenous uPAR drives tumour cell motility and invasion without affecting vitronectin adhesion⁵⁹, even in cases where signalling requires vitronectin¹⁹. Tumour cells can express multiple vitronectin-binding integrins¹⁶¹, some of which might bind vitronectin independently of uPAR. In these cells uPAR might signal through specific vitronectin-binding integrins, such as β3 integrin, while overall vitronectin adhesion remains uPAR-independent. Finally, many studies describe uPAR signalling through integrins bound to other ECM ligands, particularly fibronectin, and it has recently been argued that these signalling events do not require vitronectin¹³³,¹⁴⁶. Taken together, these data suggest that there is more to the role of uPAR than enhancing vitronectin binding. It is therefore premature to completely rule out direct uPAR–integrin interactions; indeed, these mechanisms might not be mutually exclusive¹⁶⁰.

Approaches such as FRET in live cells might help to resolve the issues of uPAR–integrin interactions. If uPAR activates integrin signalling by increasing membrane–ECM contact only, close physical proximity of uPAR and integrins (and hence FRET) would not be detected. FRET has been detected between uPAR and αβ3 and α5β1 integrins in fixed cells¹⁵¹. Ultimately, the issues surrounding uPAR–integrin interactions might only be resolved by structural biology studies. Given the difficulties encountered in X-ray crystallographic studies of integrins and uPAR individually, this will be challenging. Other structural approaches such as cryo-electron microscopy might be of value to study potential interactions with integrins¹⁶²,¹⁶³.

### Remaining questions in uPAR signalling

Key molecules involved in signalling downstream of uPAR have been identified, but the relative contributions of the two uPAR ligands uPA and vitronectin to signalling are incompletely understood and many molecular details of uPAR signalling pathways remain unclear.

#### What are the roles of uPAR ligands in signalling?

Catalytically inactive forms of uPA act as chemoattractants and mitogens through the regulation of multiple signalling pathways³³,¹⁶⁴. uPA binding might induce an ‘activated’, vitronectin-binding conformation of uPAR³⁶,³⁹,⁴¹. However, in many studies uPAR expression in cells lacking uPA activates ERK and Rac and induces cell motility through the binding of vitronectin¹²,¹⁸,¹⁹. The ‘basal’ vitronectin affinity of uPAR in the absence of uPA might therefore be sufficient to activate signalling. However, it should be considered that uPA expression is activated by ERK through AP1 transcription

c | uPAR does not interact directly with integrins but increases cell adhesion through binding vitronectin. This brings a larger plasma membrane surface area into contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM), increasing the frequency of integrin–ligand interactions and thereby promoting signalling. Models in parts **a** and **b** are supported by uPAR–integrin co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization and the use of integrin conformation-specific antibodies to detect activated conformations in the presence of uPAR. The model in part **c** is supported by the use of mutagenesis to rule out strict requirements for individual uPAR residues in integrin signalling. The relative importance of each of these models in uPAR–integrin signalling is unknown. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive and different mechanisms might mediate uPAR signalling through different integrin heterodimers.

Figure 6 | Potential therapeutic targeting of uPAR. Urokinase-type plasminogen  
activator receptor (uPAR) promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis by the  
plasmin–matrix metalloprotease (MMP) cascade and regulates cell signalling through  
integrins. uPAR and integrin-driven activation of the small GTPase Rac allows assembly of  
filamentous actin (F-actin)-containing membrane protrusions that extend the leading  
edge of the cell forwards, while pericellular proteolysis removes ECM barriers that would  
impede the extension of these protrusions. These coordinated activities make uPAR a  
potent regulator of Rac-driven, mesenchymal-type cell motility. Because it is highly  
expressed in cancers and inflammatory diseases, uPAR is an attractive therapeutic target  
and there are numerous anti-uPAR agents, including small molecules and monoclonal  
antibodies, in various stages of development. The complex function of uPAR presents  
several avenues for potential therapies. uPAR-promoted proteolysis could be blocked by  
inhibitors of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA; also known as urokinase),  
plasmin, or MMPs and by inhibitors of uPA–uPAR binding. The binding of uPA and of a  
second uPAR ligand, the ECM protein vitronectin, have been shown to activate  
uPAR-associated signalling. Inhibition of these interactions could therefore be an  
effective strategy for targeting the cell signalling functions of uPAR. uPAR interaction  
with its integrin co-receptors might also be a viable target for potential inhibitors of  
uPAR signalling, although the existence of such direct interactions is controversial.

through the association of uPAR–β1 integrin with  
EGFR<sup>131</sup>, although the mechanism of EGFR activation  
by uPAR is also incompletely understood. Interestingly,  
Src activity seems to be required for activation of both  
ERK and Rac by uPAR<sup>19,166</sup>, suggesting that Src activa-  
tion is a common event in multiple uPAR signalling  
pathways. These pathways might subsequently diverge  
as they seem to require phosphorylation of different  
Src targets. In the case of Rac activation, p130Cas phos-  
phorylation is a crucial event<sup>19</sup>. Activation of the Ras–  
ERK pathway might involve phosphorylation of Src  
homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein 1  
(SHC1; also known as SHCA)<sup>166</sup> or Tyr845 of EGFR<sup>147</sup>.  
Phosphorylation of Tyr925 of FAK by Src and the sub-  
sequent recruitment of growth factor receptor-bound  
protein 2 (GRB2)<sup>167</sup> might also be involved, but this has  
not been tested. Although Src family kinases are fre-  
quently implicated in uPAR signalling, they also have  
many activation mechanisms and the regulation of Src  
activity by uPAR is poorly understood. Binding of the  
Src SH3 domain to the β3 integrin cytoplasmic tail has  
been implicated in Src activation<sup>168</sup> and the importance  
of this mechanism in uPAR signalling should be tested.  
The multiple roles of Src in uPAR signalling might also  
reflect recruitment and activation of different members  
of the Src family. Interestingly, some studies have shown  
co-immunoprecipitation of uPAR signalling complexes  
containing multiple Src family kinases<sup>126,169</sup>.  

Activation of ERK by uPAR has been considered  
primarily to promote cell proliferation<sup>131,144</sup> or protease  
expression<sup>133,145,146</sup> through control of transcription.  
However, cytoplasmic ERK targets can regulate cell  
motility independently of transcription. One such target,  
myosin light chain kinase (MLCK; also known as  
MYLK), has been shown to be activated by uPAR signal-  
ling, contributing to induction of cell motility by uPAR  
in human tumour cells<sup>170</sup>. The potential involvement  
of other cytoplasmic ERK targets in uPAR signalling  
deserves further investigation. For example, phosphor-  
ylation of the dynein-associated protein nudel by ERK  
promotes activation of Cdc42 by sequestering Cdc42  
GTPase-activating protein (Cdc42GAP; also known  
as ARHGAP1)<sup>171</sup>, and phosphorylation of Ser910 of  
FAK by ERK leads to focal adhesion disassembly and  
turnover<sup>172</sup>.  

A rationally designed RNA interference screen was  
recently used to place DOCK180 in the Rac activation

missing links and novel effectors in uPAR signalling.  
Proteomic analysis, such as mass spectrometry-based  
phosphorylation profiling, could also be applied for  
large-scale, unbiased analysis of signalling networks  
downstream of uPAR. As signalling downstream of  
uPAR–integrin interactions requires ligand binding  
by integrins, another interesting question is whether  
uPAR signalling involves only canonical integrin-  
associated pathways or whether it also involves other  
pathways that are not activated by integrin-ligand

Conclusions and perspectives

uPAR integrates cell–ECM interactions, pericellular ECM proteolysis and cell signalling by binding uPA and vitronectin and interacting with co-receptors. As cell movement driven by Rac-dependent protrusions requires ECM proteolysis¹⁷³, the capacity for uPAR to coordinate signalling to Rac activation with pericellular ECM proteolysis is particularly interesting. These properties allow uPAR to participate in tissue remodelling and in the normal functions of the haematopoietic and immune systems. In tumour cells, uPAR is aberrantly expressed through activation of signalling pathways by genetic alterations and microenvironmental influences such as hypoxia. In this situation, uPAR acts as a potent regulator of tumour cell migration and invasion and can also promote proliferation and survival.

Many advances have been made since the discovery that uPAR regulates cell signalling independently of uPA-mediated proteolysis. However, the mechanisms of uPAR signalling are still only partially understood. Current controversies must be resolved and further studies of uPAR signalling, particularly with *in vivo* models, will help the field advance. uPAR function in tumour cells has been examined largely through *in vitro* studies using cell lines and some *in vivo* studies mainly using human tumour cell xenografts. Although some human tumour cells produce uPA, these xenograft models eliminate tumour–stroma interactions involving the plasminogen activation system because murine uPA cannot bind to human uPAR, and vice versa¹⁷⁴. uPA-, PAI1- and plasminogen-knockout mice have been used to study the role of the plasminogen activation system in mouse models of breast cancer¹⁷⁵⁻¹⁷⁷. However, there is no published report of a cross between the uPAR knockout mouse and any tumour model. Conditional gene targeting could also be exploited for uPAR deletion in tumour cells and in specific stromal compartments using a tissue-specific expression of Cre recombinase. Because uPAR is frequently overexpressed in cancer, it might also be informative to create transgenic mice that conditionally overexpress uPAR. These mice could be crossed with established tumour models to examine the effects of loss or gain of uPAR expression on tumour cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Knock-in mice expressing uPAR mutants could also be generated to test the roles of specific regions or residues of uPAR.

Although anti-uPAR therapeutic agents are yet to enter clinical trials, uPAR presents multiple opportunities for targeted therapies that might be beneficial in cancer and, potentially, other human diseases (FIG. 6). As uPAR is frequently expressed in tumour-associated stromal cells and uPAR signalling has been shown to be required for leukocyte recruitment *in vivo*, new uPAR-targeted therapies might be effective against both tumour cells and the cells of the tumour microenvironment. Exploitation of elevated uPAR expression for medical imaging or the delivery of drugs or oncolytic viruses is also under investigation¹⁷⁸,¹⁷⁹. Recent advances in the study of uPAR signalling have important implications for the design of strategies to interfere with uPAR function in tumours. Previous work has focused mostly on inhibiting the proteolytic activity of uPA or blocking uPA–uPAR binding. Although these functions are important therapeutic targets, they seem to be dispensable for at least some aspects of uPAR signalling. A number of studies have suggested that the uPAR–vitronectin interaction is a valid drug target for the inhibition of uPAR signalling¹²,¹⁸,¹⁹,⁵². If direct interactions between uPAR and integrins can be proven, these would also be attractive targets for new drugs to interfere with metastasis or tumour growth.
