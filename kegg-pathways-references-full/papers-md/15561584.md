# Roles and modes of action of nectins in cell–cell adhesion

as in epithelial cells [8]. At TJs, claudins function as Ca²⁺-independent CAMs [5,6]. Two other transmembrane proteins, occludin and junction adhesion molecules (JAMs), have been identified at TJs [6]. Occludin is a Ca²⁺-independent CAM, but its physiological function has not yet been established, whereas JAM

inhibitor of the *trans*-interactions of nectins inhibits the formation of AJs and TJs in epithelial cells and that of AJs in fibroblasts. Studies on afadin-deficient mice also support the role of nectins in the formation of AJs and the subsequent formation of TJs. Afadin-deficient mice show developmental defects at stages around gastrulation, including disorganization

determine their directions. Such signaling from nectin-3 to -1 may regulate the up- or down-regulation of receptors for the guidance cues.

4. Mode of action of nectins in the formation of AJs

4.1. Mechanism of association of nectins and cadherins

Nectins are physically associated with cadherins and both afadin and α-catenin are
the cell–cell adhesion sites at the very late stage (Fig. 4A). Thus, the LMO7-α-actinin unit does not seem to function in the recruitment of the E-cadherin-catenin complex to the nectin-based cell–cell adhesion sites during the formation of cell–cell junctions. The ponsin-vinculin unit may act as a connector
induces the activation of FRG, eventually resulting in the activation of Cdc42 at the nectin-based cell–cell contact sites. The Cdc42 activated in this way increases the number of filopodia and cell–cell contact sites, like the “fork initiation” described for DNA replication [4,13,15,55]. Moreover, this local activation of c-Src and
because other nectins, nectin-2α and -2δ, are not subjected to ectodomain shedding during the SF/HGF and TPA actions in MDCK cells. The ectodomain shedding of a specific type of nectin may be necessary and sufficient for the SF/HGF and TPA actions.
