# 1 Introduction

Inhaled nicotine is efficiently delivered to the brain (see chapter by Benowitz, this volume) where it selectively interacts with its central targets, the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The multiple subtypes of nAChR (see chapter by Collins et al., this volume) all bind nicotine but with different affinities, depending on the subunit composition of the nAChR. Binding may result in activation or desensitisation of nAChRs, reflecting the temporal characteristics of nicotine delivery and local concentration of nicotine. Another level of complexity of the actions of nicotine reflects the widespread and non-uniform distribution of nAChR subtypes within the brain, such that nicotine can influence many centrally regulated functions in addition to the reward systems. In this chapter, we address the consequences of nicotine interactions with nAChRs at the molecular, cellular and anatomical levels. We critically evaluate experimental approaches, with respect to their relevance to human smoking, and contrast the acute and chronic effects of nicotine.

# 2 Acute Effects of Nicotine on nAChRs

## 2.1 Molecular Interactions

### 2.1.1 Nicotine Binding to nAChRs

nAChRs are ligand-gated cation channels (Fig. 1). Binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) or exogenous agonists like nicotine is transduced into an intracellular signal by opening the intrinsic ion channel of the nAChR, allowing the flow of cations through the receptor. An nAChR can exist in multiple, discrete, interconvertible, conformational states; the kinetics of the transitions between states range from milliseconds to minutes, and can differ substantially between nAChR subtypes (see below). Amongst all the putative allosteric transitions, nAChRs oscillate between four dominant states: the resting state (R: channel closed and agonist binding site unoccupied), the active state (A: channel open), the desensitised state (D: channel closed and agonist bound with high affinity) and the inactive state (I: a long-lasting desensitised state) (Changeux et al. 1998; Fig. 1a). Under brief exposure to relatively high concentrations of ACh or nicotine, the equilibrium shifts towards the “A” state, allowing signal transduction, before the nAChR desensitises. However, under prolonged exposure to agonist (e.g. the relatively stable plasma nicotine concentrations sustained by smokers during the smoking day, or nicotine delivered by various NRT products), or application of low agonist concentrations, the desensitised states are more likely to be stabilised, making nAChRs refractory to activation and preventing receptor signalling.

Early studies of muscle nAChRs established that the receptor has two agonist binding sites and both must be occupied for efficient channel opening to occur.

Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Action of Nicotine in the CNS

Fig. 1 Molecular characterization of the nAChR.

a Multiple states of the nAChR. In the absence of agonist, the nAChR is predominantly in the closed state, with the integral ion channel closed. This is the “resting” state that is responsive to the application of agonist. Binding of agonist stabilises the channel in the open configuration, allowing cation flux across the membrane. The open state can be short-lived (depending on nAChR subtype and agonist concentration), such that the nAChR undergoes a further series of transitions to a desensitised state in which agonist remains bound (with high affinity) while the channel is closed. In the desensitised state, the nAChR is refractory to activation. The removal of agonist is accompanied by a return to the resting closed state.

b Structural models of the nAChR, derived from high-resolution electron microscopy of Torpedo nAChR. Upper panel: two α subunits are depicted; the other three subunits are omitted for clarity. The protein traverses the membrane by adopting an α-helical conformation to create a central pore or channel (the M2 transmembrane spanning segments that line the channel are coloured blue). The extracellular portion of the nAChR that contains the ligand binding domain is predominantly β sheet conformation. The binding of ACh results in structural movements that create a rotational effect, resulting in widening of the channel at the region of the hydrophobic “gate”. This is illustrated in the lower panel, which shows a cross-section of the channel at the level of the gate, viewed from the extracellular side. In the open state, the channel is widened by approximately 3 Å. From Unwin (2003), with permission from Elsevier.

c The agonist binding site. Left panel: schematic illustrating the localisation of the ACh binding site at the interface of an α subunit (that provides the “primary” component) and the adjacent subunit (the “complementary” component). Each subunit contributes conserved amino acids, identified by biochemical and mutagenesis experiments, located in three non-contiguous loops in each subunit. Modified from Changeux and Taly (2008), with permission from Elsevier. Right panel: crystal structure of the AChBP, viewed from above, with each subunit represented in a different colour. The localisation of the binding site residues of loops A–F is indicated in ball-and-stick representation and confirms that they lie at the interface between adjacent subunits to create a binding pocket accessible from the exterior surface of the protein.

d Nicotine docked in a binding site of the AChBP. The AChBP was co-crystallised with nicotine bound. Interactions with some of the key amino acids from loops A–F that are important for nicotine binding are indicated (AChBP numbering differs slightly from nAChR numbering of these residues in c.). The pyridine nitrogen of nicotine forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule. From Celie et al. (2004), with permission from Elsevier.
The binding sites were correlated with the two $\alpha$ subunits in muscle nAChRs. Numerous subsequent studies, notably those involving mutagenesis and/or affinity labelling experiments, have demonstrated that the agonist-binding site resides at the interface between the $\alpha$ subunit and an adjacent subunit. The $\alpha$ subunit contributes the “primary component” of agonist binding, comprising three non-contiguous polypeptide loops (named A, B, C) located in the N-terminal region. The N-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit provides the “complementary component” (D, E, F loops; Fig. 1c) (Blount and Merlie 1989; Corringer et al. 2000; Karlin 2002). This model has been corroborated by X-ray crystallography of a molluscan glial-derived homopentameric ACh-binding protein (AChBP; Fig. 1c) (Brejc et al. 2001; Smit et al. 2001). The AChBP has homology with the N-terminal extracellular domain of nAChRs, most closely resembling that of the homopentameric $\alpha7$ nAChR. The key residues of loops A–F are highly conserved, creating a binding site that is remarkably similar to that of nAChRs. Co-crystallisation of the AChBP with nicotine has revealed that binding involves conformational changes in the ligand binding site, with the largest movement in the C loop (Celie et al. 2004; Fig. 1d). The higher affinity for nicotine (compared with carbamoylcholine) reflects the ability of the pyrrolidine and pyridine nitrogens to form hydrogen bonds with the B loop and a water molecule, respectively, together with more hydrophobic interactions. The first atomic level (1.94 Å) view of a (partial) nAChR binding site has recently come from the crystallisation of the extracellular domain of a muscle $\alpha1$ nAChR subunit complexed with $\alpha$-bungarotoxin ($\alpha$Bgt) (Dellisanti et al. 2007).

Heteromeric neuronal nAChRs are composed of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits. The $\alpha$ subunits are distinguished by the presence of adjacent (vicinal) cysteine residues in loop C (Fig. 1c), and this originally defined $\alpha$ subunits as agonist-binding subunits (Corringer et al. 2000; Gotti et al. 2006). As both $\alpha$ and the adjacent non-$\alpha$ subunit determine the agonist binding site, different $\beta$ subunits can contribute to the pharmacological differences between neuronal nAChR subtypes. For example, expression of pairwise combinations of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits resulted in striking differences in the potency and efficacy of nicotine between $\beta2$- and $\beta4$-containing nAChRs (Luetje and Patrick 1991). As well as such differences between nAChRs, the agonist binding sites within an nAChR can differ. This has been clearly documented for muscle nAChR (in which the two $\alpha$ subunits are partnered by $\gamma/\varepsilon$ or $\delta$ subunits): the $\alpha\delta$ binding site has markedly higher affinity for agonists and lower affinity for antagonists than the $\alpha\gamma$ site (Blount and Merlie 1989; Karlin 2002). It is likely that similar non-equivalence of binding sites occurs in neuronal heteromeric nAChRs: among the various nAChRs expressed in rodent dopamine neurones (see chapter by Collins et al., this volume), $\alpha4\beta2$ nAChRs will have two identical agonist-binding sites, whereas $\alpha4\alpha6\beta2\beta3$ nAChRs will have two different binding sites ($\alpha4\beta2$ and $\alpha6\beta2$ interfaces). The latter subtype has higher sensitivity to nicotine than $\alpha4\beta2$ nAChRs ($EC_{50}$ $0.2 \mu$M) (Salminen et al. 2007).

The homomeric $\alpha7$ nAChR presents a special case, as each subunit contains both primary and complementary components of the binding site, with the possibility of five agonist-binding sites per receptor (Palma et al. 1996). It is generally regarded as having lower sensitivity to agonist and desensitising rapidly. However, recent studies(in which mutated binding sites could be sequentially inactivated by a sulfhydryl reagent) suggest that having five binding sites gives the α7 nAChR a greater range of sensitivity: low concentrations of agonist sufficient to occupy as few as one or two binding sites can effectively activate the α7 nAChR, while higher concentrations that occupy more binding sites promote rapid, albeit short-lived, desensitisation (Papke et al. 2007).

### 2.1.2 Signal Transduction: Channel Opening

While atomic resolution crystal structures provide detailed descriptions of the nAChR, they represent only the most stable states (resting or desensitised) due to the time required for crystallisation to occur. The pioneering work of Nigel Unwin, using electron microscopy to visualise intact nAChRs that form semi-crystalline arrays in *Torpedo* electroplax, has afforded an opportunity to capture the open state of the nAChR, albeit at the lower resolution of 4.6 Å (Fig. 1b). This was achieved by spraying ACh onto the receptor at the moment of rapid freezing (Unwin 1995, 2003). Comparison with the closed state (the resting or desensitised/inactive state) of the nAChR has provided insight into the changes induced by agonist binding that lead to channel opening.

In the closed or non-conducting state, the lumen of the channel is blocked by a molecular barrier or “gate”, preventing the flux of cations. The pore is lined by the second transmembrane domain, M2, of each of the five subunits that make up the nAChR. Unwin and colleagues located the resting gate in the mid-region of M2, where the lumen narrows and is only 6 Å wide, too narrow for hydrated cations to pass through and energetically unfavourable for the removal of hydration shells (Unwin 1995; Miyazawa et al. 2003). In this model, the gate consists of a ring of leucine residues and a ring of valine or isoleucine residues one helix-turn above. The binding of agonist destabilises the hydrophobic intersubunit interactions, allowing the α subunit N-terminal domains to rotate by 15°. As a consequence, the five M2 α-helices change orientation, widening the channel by 3 Å, sufficient for monovalent and divalent cations (K⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺) to diffuse through the water-filled pore (see Fig. 1b). Application of the substituted-cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) has predicted that the gate is lower down the channel than Unwin’s proposed leucine ring (Wilson and Karlin 1998; Karlin 2002). Moreover, the biochemical approach distinguished separate resting and desensitised gates, consistent with electrophysiological data (Auerbach and Akk 1998). Although the physical location of the gate (or gates) requires confirmation, the principles of channel opening derived from the electron microscopy approach are widely accepted, leading to the “quaternary twist” model of channel opening (Changeux and Taly 2008).

The 1.6 Å-resolution crystal structure of the muscle α1 subunit extracellular domain revealed an unexpected water molecule in the core of the α1 nAChR subunit, in the vicinity of the transmembrane domain (Dellisanti et al. 2007). This is surrounded by hydrophilic residues that are conserved in nAChR subunits, but absent from the AChBP. The water molecule confers flexibility, making the “non-optimally
packed core” of the nAChR predisposed to undergo conformational change on agonist binding, a response that is not required by the AChBP that lacks an ion channel. Site-directed mutational analysis has implicated the amino acids around this hydrophilic cavity in the gating process. In addition, sugars arising from the conserved N-linked glycosylation of nAChR subunits are also important for the coupling of agonist binding to channel gating (Dellisanti et al. 2007). Glycans may modulate the duration of channel open and closed states; different glycosylation patterns between nAChR subtypes could provide another source of functional heterogeneity. The highly variable cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 also has the potential to differentially influence the gating characteristics of different nAChR subtypes (Peters et al. 2006).

Although nAChR subunits share common structural features and conserved amino acids that are involved in ligand binding, channel opening and conduction, the unique amino acid sequence of each subunit will influence nAChR function (Dani and Bertrand 2007). In addition, the absence of key amino acids will prevent certain subunits from contributing to the binding pocket. This appears to be the case for the α5 nAChR subunit, in which an essential tyrosine residue (corresponding to Tyr 190, Fig. 1c) is absent from the C-loop, being replaced by an aspartate residue that cannot contribute to the primary binding component. Similarly, β3 subunits, in which the tyrosine residues of the complementary binding site loop E (Fig. 1c) are replaced by phenylalanine, do not participate in agonist binding (Corringer et al. 2000): α5 and β3 subunits are believed to provide the fifth subunit in a pentamer, the role of the β1 subunit in muscle nAChRs. However, incorporation of these “accessory” subunits can significantly modulate the properties of heteromeric nAChRs (Kuryatov et al. 2008). For example, inclusion of an α5 subunit enhances the Ca²⁺ permeability of α3β2 or α3β4 nAChRs (Gerzanich et al. 1998), decreases the EC₅₀ for nicotine of α4β2 nAChRs (Ramirez-Latorre et al. 1996), and affects upregulation in response to nicotine (see Sect. 3.4.3). Indeed, the stoichiometry of α4β2 nAChRs without any additional subunits (i.e., with either α4 or β2 as the accessory subunit) affects agonist affinity (see Sect. 3.4.2).

## 2.2 Cellular Consequences of Activating nAChRs

### 2.2.1 Changes in Intracellular Na⁺ and Ca²⁺

Activation of nAChRs results in the influx of Na⁺ and Ca²⁺, which engenders rapid changes in membrane potential and local increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, [Ca²⁺]ᵢ. It is the ability to alter [Ca²⁺]ᵢ that gives nAChRs a pivotal role in modulating cellular functions (Berridge et al. 2000; Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott 2004). The subunit composition of the nAChR dictates its intrinsic Ca²⁺ permeability, expressed as “fractional Ca²⁺ current” (Pf), an experimental estimate based on synchronised recordings of membrane potential and fluorescent signals gathered using Ca²⁺-sensitive dyes (Fucile 2004). Heteromeric neuronal nAChRs
(excluding α9/α10 nAChRs) are moderately permeable to Ca²⁺ with \( P_{\mathrm{f}} \) values of 1.5–5%, whereas for homomeric α7 nAChRs the positioning of charged and polar amino acids at the cytoplasmic end of M2 confers a Ca²⁺ permeability comparable to that of heteromeric NMDA receptors (\( P_{\mathrm{f}} \sim 6-12\% \)) (Vernino et al. 1992; Bertrand et al. 1993; Seguela et al. 1993).

In addition, nAChRs can further augment \([ \mathrm{Ca}^{2+} ]_{\mathrm{i}}\) by secondary activation of voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCC), or by mobilizing the release of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) from internal stores via a mechanism of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\)-induced \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release (CICR) (Tsuneki et al. 2000; Sharma and Vijayaraghavan 2003; Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott 2004). Several reports support the differential coupling of homomeric and heteromeric nAChRs to distinct \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) pathways. Non-α7 nAChRs primarily trigger activation of VOCCs; examples include β2-containing nAChRs on dopamine cell bodies (Tsuneki et al. 2000) and terminals (Soliakov and Wonnacott 1996; Turner 2004; Nayak et al. 2001). In contrast, α7 nAChRs preferentially elicit CICR from ryanodine-sensitive stores in numerous preparations (Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott 2004; Dickinson et al. 2007, 2008). The ability to provoke CICR is likely to reflect the higher \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) flux through α7 nAChRs and may also require a spatial relationship between α7 nAChRs and \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) stores to facilitate their communication.

The significance of coupling to either VOCC or CICR is that different nAChRs can generate \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) signals with distinct kinetic, temporal and spatial characteristics. Hence, the nicotinic modulation of this ubiquitous intracellular messenger places nAChRs in a key position to influence a variety of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\)-dependent neuronal processes, ranging from neurotransmitter release to synaptic plasticity and gene transcription (Berridge et al. 2000; Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott 2004).

### 2.2.2 Subcellular Distribution of nAChRs

The consequences of nicotinic signalling are dictated by the subcellular localisation of nAChRs (Fig. 2). It was clear from early studies that a significant proportion of nAChRs in the brain are presynaptic (Wonnacott 1997). Presynaptic nAChRs can directly influence transmitter release. Preterminal nAChRs located at the neck of a synaptic bouton can promote transmitter release by initiating action potentials, and are therefore sensitive to tetrodotoxin (Lena et al. 1993; Dani and Bertrand 2007).

nAChRs on cell soma and dendrites may be postsynaptic to cholinergic nerve terminals but there is limited evidence for nicotinic synaptic transmission in the brain, suggesting that this arrangement is not common (Dani and Bertrand 2007). One example relevant to reward systems is the cholinergic input from the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (see Fig. 3) to midbrain dopamine neurons (Mena-Segovia et al. 2008; Maskos 2008). More commonly, nAChRs appear to be extrasynaptic. In an ultrastructural study, α7 nAChRs have been observed to be perisynaptic around glutamatergic or GABAergic synapses in the CA1 stratum radiatum of the hippocampus (Fabian-Fine et al. 2001). Somatodendritic nAChRs can influence neuronal excitability as a consequence of local depolarisation (excitatory)
Fig. 2 Subcellular localisation of neuronal nAChRs. Upper left: a cholinergic neurone releases ACh in the vicinity of a presynaptic nerve terminal. The enlarged view indicates that the nerve terminal might have preterminal **a** or presynaptic **b** nAChRs that can elicit transmitter release when activated. Upper right: a cholinergic neurone synapses onto the cell soma of the postsynaptic neurone. The enlarged view indicates that the postsynaptic cell might bear perisynaptic **c**, postsynaptic **d**, or extrasynaptic **e** nAChRs. Dendritic nAChRs are also indicated. Heteromeric nAChRs composed of α and β subunits (orange) and homomeric α7 nAChRs (red) are distinguished. Nicotine would activate these receptors in the absence of cholinergic activity.

postsynaptic potentials) that could result in increased action potential firing, leading to transmitter release in terminal fields. Alternatively, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say additionally, local changes in \[Ca²⁺\]i in response to somatodendritic nAChR activation can influence a variety of cellular processes by altering or promoting Ca²⁺-dependent signalling events. This includes signalling to the nucleus to effect changes in gene transcription.

The diversity of nAChRs is exemplified in rodent midbrain dopamine neurones (Fig. 3; see Wonnacott et al. 2005). Dopaminergic cell bodies express predominantly heteromeric nAChRs: α4α6α5β2 and α4α5β2 subtypes. In addition, α7 nAChRs are present in fewer than half the neurones (Klink et al. 2001). Dopaminergic terminals in striatum or nucleus accumbens (NAc) possess α4β2, α4α5β2, α4α6β2β3 and α6β2β3 nAChRs (Gotti et al. 2006; see chapter by Collins et al., this volume): it is not clear whether multiple subtypes are present on the same terminal, or whether they are segregated to distinct inputs. The evidence for this diversity comes from the generation of transgenic mice with targeted deletions of specific subunits, in combination with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of dopaminergic afferents and pharmacological analysis, in addition to single cell RT-PCR, electrophysiological recordings and immunohistochemistry (Jones et al. 2001; Klink et al. 2001; Zoli

Reciprocal connections between the VTA and the tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP) are also indicated. The TPP comprises the laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) and pedunculopontine tegmental (PPT) nuclei. b Schematic highlighting the major neurotransmitter inputs and outputs of the VTA. The NAc receives predominantly glutamatergic projections from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, the hippocampus and thalamus, in addition to cortical inputs (notably from the PFC) (Heimer et al. 1985). Major glutamatergic inputs to the VTA are from the PFC, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the TPP; additional inputs arise from the hypothalamus, ventral pallidum, medial preoptic area and medial septum, as well as some brainstem nuclei (Geisler et al. 2007). The principal known locations of heteromeric β2-containing nAChRs (green) and homomeric α7 nAChRs (red) within the VTA are indicated.

et al. 2002; Champtiaux and Changeux 2002; Marubio et al. 2003; Cui et al. 2003; Gotti et al. 2005; Salminen et al. 2007). The functional significance of the relatively restricted expression of α6 and β3 subunits to catecholamine neurones and components of the visual system is presently unclear, although the presence of the β3 subunit in presynaptic (but not somatodendritic) α6-containing nAChRs suggests that it may have a targeting role. Indeed, β3-null mutant mice have a reduced expression of α6-containing nAChRs in striatal dopamine terminals (Gotti et al. 2005).

2.2.3 Neurotransmitter Release and Synaptic Plasticity

In vitro and In vivo Methods for Assessing nAChR-evoked Neurotransmitter Release

Several techniques, with intrinsic advantages and disadvantages, have been used to assess the release of neurotransmitters in response to nAChR activation, both in vitro and in vivo. These methods are briefly reviewed here; for a more detailed comparison see Wonnacott et al. (2002).

In vitro methods include electrophysiological recording, superfusion and static release assays. Patch clamp recordings provide the most exquisite sensitivity: chemical, temporal and spatial (Sakmann 2006). However, for presynaptic receptors it is not possible to record directly from presynaptic boutons, due to their small size (except in exceptional cases, such as the calyx of Held; Sakmann 2006). Postsynaptic recordings provide an indirect index of transmitter release, by using the postsynaptic receptors as a detection system. This is most applicable to the nicotinic modulation of glutamate or GABA release, which results in fast postsynaptic potentials. Thus, it is possible to interrogate individual synapses over a millisecond timescale, and this approach has provided much of the evidence for the influence of nAChRs on glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission, notably in the hippocampus and VTA (McKay et al. 2007).

Electrophysiology has proved less useful for characterising the release of other transmitters including the catecholamines, because these do not generate fast postsynaptic currents but signal through G-protein coupled receptors. Electrochemical techniques, such as constant-potential amperometry, high-speed chronoamperometry and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry can monitor local increases in transmitter release with varying degrees of temporal resolution (Michael and Wightman 1999). The carbon fibre microelectrodes employed measure the oxidation/reduction of released neurotransmitter at the electrode surface in response to an applied potential, and this methodology has been mostly used to measure dopamine. The intrinsic properties of the electrodes determine the chemical and temporal resolution of these techniques; fast-scan cyclic voltammetry is capable of subsecond measurements and has been applied to the study of presynaptic nicotinic modulation of dopamine release in the dorsal striatum and NAc (Zhou et al. 2001; Exley et al. 2007). An advantage of this approach is that it permits electrical stimulation of dopaminergic afferents to mimic the intrinsic firing patterns of these neurones, thus providing a more physiological perspective than is possible with other neurochemical in vitro methods.

The superfusion of isolated nerve terminals (“synaptosomes”) is a widely used technique for interrogating the pharmacological properties of presynaptic receptors and their biochemical mechanisms. Physiological buffer continuously flows over a layer of synaptosomes loaded with radiolabelled transmitter, such that released transmitter is removed in the perfusate and collected. A key feature of this methodology is that it eliminates transmitter crosstalk between different boutons, enabling presynaptic events to be studied in isolation (Raiteri and Raiteri 2000).
This methodology has been extensively applied to nAChRs, a reflection of the abundance of presynaptic nAChRs in the brain (Wonnacott 1997), with particular emphasis on striatal dopamine terminals resulting in a thorough characterization of the various nAChR subtypes associated with nigrostriatal afferents (see chapter by Collins et al., this volume). The temporal resolution of this method is determined by the flow rate of the perfusing buffer and the size of fractions collected, typically 0.5–2 min fractions (Soliakov et al. 1995; Clarke and Reuben 1996; Grady et al. 1997). However, a super-fast technique with subsecond resolution has been described; using this approach, a small α7 nAChR-mediated enhancement of evoked \[^3\text{H}\]dopamine release from striatal synaptosomes in response to repeated nicotine applications was reported (Turner 2004). In addition to dopamine release, nicotinic modulation of the release of other transmitters, including noradrenaline (Clarke and Reuben 1996), 5HT (Reuben and Clarke 2000), GABA (Lu et al. 1998), ACh (Wilkie et al. 1996; Grady et al. 2001) and D-aspartate (Marchi et al. 2002; Rousseau et al. 2005; Dickinson et al. 2008), has been documented in synaptosome preparations.

Superfusion of brain slices (or, more correctly, minces or prisms) loaded with radiolabelled transmitter is a robust method; the tissue preparation provides an extra layer of complexity with scope for local interactions between elements within the slice. Comparison with synaptosomes has allowed direct and indirect nicotinic modulation of dopamine release to be dissected (Kaiser and Wonnacott 2000). Superfusion methodology is relatively low throughput, with commercial or custom-built systems having 20 or fewer superfusion chambers operating in parallel. Recently, a high-throughput static release system for the nicotinic modulation of transmitter release from slices was described (Anderson et al. 2000; Puttfarcken et al. 2000). This is carried out in 96-well filter plates equipped with a membrane to support the tissue slices. After exposure to drugs, the bathing medium (containing released transmitter) is removed by vacuum filtration into a 96-well plate (for counting radioactivity) placed beneath the filter plate. In spite of the static nature of the assay, results obtained with this methodology reliably reproduce those obtained by conventional superfusion (Anderson et al. 2000; Barik and Wonnacott 2006). This method has also been employed to monitor \[^3\text{H}\]ACh release from synaptosomes (Mogg et al. 2004).

The microdialysis technique (Westerink 2000) has been the most widely used method for monitoring the nicotinic modulation of transmitter release, notably dopamine, in vivo. It combines good anatomical precision (e.g. allowing sampling from either the core or the shell of the NAc; see chapter by Balfour, this volume) with detection of endogenous (not radiolabelled) transmitter in physiological preparations (conscious, freely moving animals). However, it suffers from poor temporal resolution as 10–20 min fractions are needed to provide detectable amounts of transmitter. As well as systemic administration, drugs can be delivered via a cannula into other brain regions, such as cell body areas (Nisell et al. 1994), or locally via the probe by reverse dialysis (Marshall et al. 1997). The latter route allows one to target the terminal field rather than cell bodies. The concentration of drugs reaching nAChRs can only be estimated, and administration via a cannula or dialysis probe will result in a concentration gradient through the surrounding tissue.
Nicotinic Modulation of Neurotransmitter Release

From relatively early studies, catecholaminergic neurones appeared to be important for intracranial self-administration, and midbrain dopamine systems assumed a central role in the reward circuitry purported to underlie drug addiction (Koob 1992). Hence, the release of dopamine (with emphasis on the mesolimbic dopamine system in in vivo studies; see chapter by Balfour, this volume) has received particular attention. The modulation of dopaminergic neurones by glutamatergic afferents and inhibitory GABAergic interneurones or projection neurones (Fig. 3) has stimulated examination of the nicotinic modulation of these transmitters with respect to models of dependence. Nicotine has also been reported to evoke the release of many other neurotransmitters, with varying degrees of relevance to dependence per se (Vizi and Lendvai 1999). The complex effects on neural network function that can ensue from a superficially simple facilitation of transmitter release is exemplified by a recent electrophysiological analysis of nicotine’s actions in the prefrontal cortex: the nicotinic enhancement of GABA release from interneurones serves to raise the threshold for synaptic plasticity, with implications for prefrontal information processing and storage (Couey et al. 2007).

Here we will focus on midbrain dopamine systems. In addition to the direct modulation of dopamine release by presynaptic nAChRs (reviewed in chapter by Collins et al., this volume), studies using striatal tissue prisms have provided functional evidence for indirect modulation of dopamine release via spillover of glutamate. In this model, α7 nAChRs on neighbouring cortico-striatal glutamatergic afferents promote the release of glutamate that, in turn, stimulates heterosynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors on dopaminergic terminals to enhance dopamine release (Kaiser and Wonnacott 2000; Barik and Wonnacott 2006). This model is supported by the demonstration that α7 nAChRs increase the depolarisation-induced release of \[^{3}\]H]D-aspartate, a surrogate for glutamate, from rat and human striatal synaptosomes (Marchi et al. 2002).

The physiological significance of this ability of nicotine to locally enhance dopamine release is not fully appreciated. Systemically administered nicotine elicits dopamine release, but this response is antagonised by mecamylamine delivered to the cell body region (VTA) rather than the terminal field (NAc) (Nisell et al. 1994). Local delivery of nicotine to the NAc or dorsal striatum via the microdialysis probe results in increased dopamine overflow (Nisell et al. 1994; Marshall et al. 1997), so presynaptic nAChRs are capable of influencing dopamine release in vivo. A rationalisation of these apparent contradictions is emerging from recent real-time measurements of dopamine release from striatal slices using fast-scan voltammetry (Zhou et al. 2001; Exley and Cragg 2008). Under different stimulation conditions, to mimic tonic or phasic firing patterns of these neurones, and taking into account the contribution of ACh released from local interneurones, nicotine is proposed to desensitise β2-containing nAChRs on dopamine terminals during tonic dopamine release. By removing short-term depression this facilitates greater dopamine release in response to burst firing, thus enhancing the contrast between resting (tonic) activity and stimulated phasic (bursting) activity. The α6-containing nAChRs dominate
these effects of nicotine in the NAc, but have a lesser role, compared to other β2-containing nAChRs, in dorsal striatum (Exley et al. 2007).

The balance between desensitisation and activation of nAChRs is also critical for the actions of nicotine in the VTA. Dani and colleagues demonstrated that the various subtypes of nAChR in the VTA are differentially activated and desensitised by concentrations of nicotine similar to those found in the blood of smokers (Pidoplichko et al. 1997; McKay et al. 2007). In this model, the α4β2 nAChRs that reside on GABAergic interneurons (Klink et al. 2001) desensitise in response to nicotine more readily than the more complex heteromeric nAChRs on the dopaminergic cell bodies (Fig. 3). This effectively reduces GABA release and relieves this inhibitory influence (Mansvelder et al. 2003). Together with activation of α7 nAChRs on glutamatergic afferents to increase glutamatergic activation, the dopamine neurone switches from phasic to burst firing, with greatly increased dopamine release in the NAc (Schilström et al. 2003; Goto et al. 2007). Support for the role of somatodendritic β2-containing nAChRs in this switch to burst firing comes from the observation that it is greatly diminished in knockout mice lacking the β2 nAChR subunit, and is restored by targeted expression of the β2 subunit in the VTA (Mameli-Engvall et al. 2006). As these heteromeric nAChRs receive cholinergic inputs from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) (Mena-Segovia et al. 2008), this has led to the proposition that cholinergic nicotinic transmission acts as a “gate” that permits this switch to burst firing driven by glutamatergic stimulation (Maskos 2008). In addition to having a key role in nicotine dependence (when nicotine supplants ACh, perhaps accentuating the gate effects by the balance of activation and desensitisation alluded to above), this cholinergic nicotinic gate may contribute to goal-directed behaviours in general, including individual differences in drug abuse liability (Fagen et al. 2007) and cocaine-induced dopamine release (Zanetti et al. 2007).

## Presynaptic Plasticity

The activation of somatodendritic β2-containing nAChRs is transient and the receptors desensitise, even at low concentrations of nicotine (Fig. 1a). However, systemic administration of nicotine as a single injection results in long-lasting dopamine release in the NAc (see chapter by Balfour, this volume). Nicotine-induced plasticity at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses onto mesolimbic dopamine neurones (Fig. 3) has been proposed as a mechanism that translates a brief nicotinic activation into a long-lasting response (Mansvelder et al. 2003; McKay et al. 2007).

Functional and ultrastructural studies support the presence of α7 nAChRs on glutamatergic afferents to the VTA, which can facilitate the release of glutamate (Mansvelder and McGehee 2000; Schilström et al. 2000; Jones and Wonnacott 2004). When presynaptic nicotine is paired with postsynaptic depolarisation, long-term potentiation of glutamatergic transmission results in vitro (Mansvelder and McGehee 2002). The coupling of α7 nAChR to CICR (see Sect. 2.2.1) provides a potential mechanism for presynaptic facilitation mediatedby these receptors (Emptage et al. 2001; Collin et al. 2005; Sharma et al. 2008). In response to a bolus of nanomolar nicotine in vivo, it is predicted that the sustained activation of presynaptic α7 nAChRs to facilitate glutamate release coincides with the transient activation of somatodendritic heteromeric nAChRs, which thereby contribute to the postsynaptic depolarisation (McKay et al. 2007). Decreased GABAergic input (attributed to long-term depression at GABAergic synapses, instigated by transient activation of α4β2 nAChRs; Mansvelder and McGehee 2002) would also facilitate depolarisation of dopamine neurones (McKay et al. 2007).

Strengthening of glutamatergic synapses within the VTA is also observed in response to other abused drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine. Importantly, this cannot be induced by non-addictive drugs such as fluoxetine or carbamazepine (Saal et al. 2003). Hence, synaptic neuroadaptation at excitatory synapses is an important key step in the development of addiction (Kauer and Malenka 2007).

### 2.2.4 Somatodendritic Signalling and the Regulation of Gene Expression

The increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ that accompany the activation of somatodendritic nAChRs can facilitate the engagement of Ca²⁺-sensitive proteins (notably kinases, but also phosphatases) and modulation of intracellular signalling cascades. In addition to short-term local changes, such as nAChR phosphorylation that can modify receptor function (Eilers et al. 1997), transduction of signals to the nucleus can exert longer-term changes by influencing gene transcription. This has been most clearly demonstrated in cultured neurones or cell lines: activation of somatic nAChRs by nicotine results in increases in the transcriptional regulator phospho-CREB (cyclic AMP response element-binding protein) and immediate early gene c-Fos (Hu et al. 2002). The phosphorylation of CREB is downstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/2 that is activated following Ca²⁺ entry via α7 nAChRs (Hu et al. 2002; Bitner et al. 2007), although some studies dispute the involvement of α7 nAChRs (Nakayama et al. 2001; Steiner et al. 2007). In mice, acute administration of a low dose of nicotine (0.4 mg kg⁻¹) increased phospho-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity in the NAc, prefrontal cortex and some other regions innervated by the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. A similar pattern of response was elicited by other drugs of abuse, but not by non-addictive drugs (Valjent et al. 2004).

In catecholaminergic PC12 cells, nicotine-induced activation of CREB is coupled to increased transcription of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine and noradrenaline (Gueorguiev et al. 2006). This has been attributed to activation of α7 nAChRs and CICR (Gueorguiev et al. 2000), although activation of ERK1/2 did not appear to be necessary (Gueorguiev et al. 2006). In vivo, upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase protein in response to oral nicotine in the drinking water (see Sect. 3.1) has been demonstrated in mice; enzyme levels were increased in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, but not in VTA or NAc (Brunzell et al. 2003). The ability of nicotine to enhance catecholaminergic transmission by increasing the amount of rate-limiting enzyme is appealing in terms of nicotine reinforcement, and a polymorphism in this enzyme has been associated with reduced
nicotine dependence (Anney et al. 2004). However, there was no consistent correlation between changes in tyrosine hydroxylase, ERK1/2 and phospho-CREB in the mouse study (Brunzell et al. 2003). This could reflect the multiple roles of ERK1/2 in coordinating diverse signals to regulate multiple effectors (Girault et al. 2007; Zhai et al. 2008).

Particular attention has been given to the transcription of immediate early genes such as c-Fos. As transcriptional regulators, these downstream effectors of intracellular signalling cascades can play a pivotal role in switching on or off genes critical for the development of neuronal adaptations. c-Fos mRNA and protein expression in rat NAc, amygdala and other reward-related regions are increased in response to acute nicotine administration in vivo (Salminen et al. 1999; Shram et al. 2007). Moreover, nicotine injection directly into the VTA increased c-Fos-like immunoreactivity in the NAc (Panagis et al. 1996). The latter study is important because it clearly demonstrates that immediate early gene regulation does not occur in dopaminergic neurones bearing nAChRs in the VTA, but in the postsynaptic neurones (probably GABAergic) in the terminal field. Thus, although cellular studies can reveal a series of signalling events culminating in gene expression, in vivo responses are more complex and may be the result of increased transmitter release activating postsynaptic neurones. In this regard, it is noteworthy that nicotine-evoked increases in phosphoERK1/2 are blocked by D1 receptor antagonists (Valjent et al. 2004).

Microarray technology to screen for changes in gene expression offers a means of identifying novel targets. A comparison of the transcriptomes of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line with and without treatment with a high concentration of nicotine (1 mM) for 1 hour identified 14 genes with altered levels of expression (Dunckley and Lukas 2003). The changes were mostly nAChR-mediated as they were prevented by co-administration of nicotinic antagonists. The genes affected include transcription factors, RNA binding proteins and plasma membrane proteins; their physiological roles and implications for nicotine dependence are presently unclear.

## 3 Effects of Chronic Nicotine

Nicotine absorption through inhalation of tobacco smoke is the most widespread mode of nicotine consumption. Regular cigarette smoking leads to complex kinetics of plasma nicotine levels, and the concentration and time-course of nicotine reaching central nAChRs remains controversial (Rose et al. 1999; Hukkanen et al. 2005). Modelling this phenomenon in animals for research purposes is challenging. Humans are the only animals that will voluntarily inhale; exposure of animals to cigarette smoke has been attempted (e.g. using nose cones for forced inhalation), but such methods are highly stressful and confound the validity of this approach. In the light of the Surgeon General’s Report in 1990, research has concentrated on the effects of nicotine. Several methods of nicotine delivery have been developed to model various aspects of nicotine intake in order to evaluate ensuing

molecular and cellular changes in the brain. This has been comprehensively reviewed by Matta et al. (2007). The main issues, which will be briefly addressed below, are dose, route, timing and non-contingent administration.

# 3.1 Animal Models of Nicotine Administration

Once- or twice-daily injections deliver a single bolus of drug that reproduces, to some extent, the predicted increases in plasma nicotine that accompany consumption of a cigarette. Typical behaviourally effective doses of nicotine free base range from 0.2 to 0.8 mg kg⁻¹ in rats, with higher doses employed in mice (up to 2.0 mg kg⁻¹) to compensate for the increased rate of nicotine metabolism in mice (Hukkanen et al. 2005). When injected subcutaneously, nicotine rapidly penetrates the bloodstream, although peak levels (15 min post-injection; Turner 1975) are achieved more slowly than when inhaling nicotine (~10 s; Rose et al. 1999; Hukkanen et al. 2005). Hence, to avoid desensitisation of nAChRs by the initial lower levels of nicotine that may result from the slower elevation of plasma concentrations following injection, nicotine is typically administered at higher doses than one would expect.

Injections fail to recapitulate the repetitive nature of nicotine delivery arising from smoking a single cigarette over about 15 min, or the effect of smoking multiple cigarettes. This has been attempted in mice using in-dwelling catheters for nicotine delivery via an automated system (Robinson et al. 1994). This technology is well established for nicotine self-administration in rats (see chapter by Balfour, this volume), which combines frequent low doses with voluntary lever-pressing. Shoaib and Stolerman (1999) showed that rats given the opportunity to lever-press for intravenous nicotine delivery (0.03 or 0.06 mg kg⁻¹ delivered in ~1 s) achieved plasma levels of nicotine that are comparable to those observed in smokers (40–120 ng ml⁻¹). Recently, it has been argued that lower doses (corresponding to 1–2 typical cigarette puffs; 3 μg kg⁻¹) given over a slower time-course (30 s) are preferentially self-administered, and that the speed of infusion influences the interactions with dopamine systems (Sorge and Clarke 2007). However, self-administration has rarely been used or adapted for molecular and cellular studies.

During the day, assuming regular cigarette consumption and the slow release of nicotine from body tissues, plasma nicotine reaches steady-state levels of approximately 20–70 ng ml⁻¹ (Gourlay and Benowitz 1997; Russell 1990). Osmotic minipumps provide a constant, slow delivery of nicotine (0.1–10 μl h⁻¹) over a modest period of time (1–4 weeks, depending on the model of minipump employed) to mirror these sustained concentrations: 2–4 mg kg⁻¹ per day in rats achieves plasma nicotine concentrations of 20–50 ng ml⁻¹ (Barik and Wonnacott 2006; Rowell and Li 1997; Sanderson et al. 1993). Once implanted, there is minimal animal handling and stress. The main limitation is the constant infusion of nicotine, even during non-active periods, whereas overnight abstinence is a key feature of human consumption.

An alternative method of long-term administration that circumvents this issue is nicotine administration via drinking water. This limits consumption to the active phase, and can encompass some self-control of nicotine consumption by the animal (depending on whether a two-bottle choice is available). However, the bitter taste of nicotine makes it unpalatable, causing reduced water intake and loss of body weight. The taste must be disguised by additives such as saccharin, which introduces another parameter that must be controlled for. Typical concentrations of nicotine in drinking water are 20–30 µg ml⁻¹, and are increased progressively by 50 µg increments per week over several weeks of treatment. Plasma nicotine concentrations achieved by this route in primates and rodents are modest (10–35 ng ml⁻¹; Pietilä and Ahtee 2000; Quik et al. 2006; Rowell et al. 1983), due to first-pass metabolism by the liver.

The methods discussed above have been widely used to assess the effect of either continuous or intermittent nicotine on nAChR functions and brain biochemistry (Matta et al. 2007). For models of nicotine withdrawal, see the chapter by Malin in this volume. Given the intrinsic advantages and limitations of each approach, the non-contingent nature of most administration regimes and the absence of associated cues, it is important that these paradigms are not assumed to model “tobacco addiction” per se. Sometimes, the experiments are conducted in concert with behavioural measures (e.g. precipitation of withdrawal with somatic signs), which give more credibility to the assertion that a state of nicotine dependence has been achieved (Kenny and Markou 2005).

## 3.2 Changes in Nicotine-Evoked Neurotransmitter Release

As described in Sect. 2.2.3, nAChRs can modulate the release of numerous neurotransmitters. Although prolonged nicotine exposure can perturb these neurotransmitter systems, the functionality of nAChRs following such treatments remains a debated issue. Due to the predominance of the dopaminergic hypothesis of addiction, attention has focussed on the nicotinic modulation of striatal/accumbal dopamine release. However, the complex interplay of glutamate and GABA inputs (Fig. 3) and the contribution of the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems to addiction (Done et al. 1992; Vorel et al. 2001; Weinshenker and Schroeder 2007) demands a broader view of nicotine’s effects.

In ex vivo studies in which transmitter release is measured in synaptosome or slice preparations from animals treated with nicotine in vivo, no change (Grilli et al. 2005), decreased (Grady et al. 1997) and increased (Yu and Wecker 1994) striatal [³H]dopamine release has been reported. A similar picture has been observed for nAChR-evoked hippocampal [³H]noradrenaline release, with unchanged (Barik and Wonnacott 2006), decreased (Grilli et al. 2005) and increased (Jacobs et al. 2002) responses. As tissue is extensively washed prior to nAChR stimulation, these discrepancies are unlikely to reflect differences in nAChR desensitisation due

to residual nicotine but are probably due to differences in experimental procedures, including the dose of nicotine employed, the route and frequency of administration, and the brain tissue preparation used (synaptosomes or slices). In at least two studies, an increase in noradrenaline release during the withdrawal phase has been noted (Gaddnas et al. 2000; Barik and Wonnacott 2006).

With respect to in vivo noradrenaline release, several studies report increases in response to nicotine challenge after chronic administration, consistent with a sensitised response. Sharp and co-workers demonstrated that rats self-administering nicotine in an unlimited access paradigm exhibited markedly increased levels of endogenous noradrenaline in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (Fu et al. 2001) and amygdala (Fu et al. 2003). Also, in rats that received a daily nicotine injection (0.4 mg kg⁻¹) for 5 days, noradrenaline release in the ventral hippocampus was enhanced in response to a subsequent nicotine challenge (Benwell and Balfour 1997).

Responses in the dopamine system are more complex (see chapter by Balfour, this volume). Repeated nicotine injections resulted in enhanced extracellular DA levels in the NAc (Benwell and Balfour 1992, 1997), but not in the striatum (Benwell and Balfour 1997). Analysis of the precise placement of dialysis probes has revealed differential responses to drugs of abuse, including nicotine, between the NAc core (ventral striatum) and shell (Di Chiara 2002; Balfour 2004; Wonnacott et al. 2005; see chapter by Balfour, this volume). Moreover, the sensitised neurotransmitter responses observed in the hippocampus and NAc were markedly attenuated if rats received a constant infusion of a low level of nicotine (Benwell and Balfour 1997). Thus, transient peaks of nicotine appear capable of sensitising some brain pathways with respect to catecholamine release, but the responses may be mitigated by lower sustained plasma concentrations, possibly due to desensitisation. The extent that presynaptic nAChRs contribute to this process in vivo is unclear; presynaptic α7 nAChRs on glutamatergic afferents to the VTA merit attention as potential mediators of sensitisation (see Sect. 2.2.2).

## 3.3 Alterations in Gene and Protein Expression

What are the molecular and cellular changes that confer a state of dependence in response to abused drugs? In addressing this question, several studies have focussed on the ERK1/2 signalling cascade for linking nAChR activation by nicotine to long-term cellular changes (see Sect. 2.2.4). This pathway modulates associative learning processes and reward, and a growing body of evidence indicates that drugs of abuse hijack these physiological processes (Berke and Hyman 2000; Hyman and Malenka 2001; Zhai et al. 2008). Indeed, complex changes in ERK1/2 and CREB were observed following chronic oral nicotine administration in mice (Brunzell et al. 2003).

Downstream targets of ERK1/2 and CREB include immediate early genes, such as c-Fos, FosB and Zif268, which are expressed in response to drugs of abuse
(Lee et al. 2005; Valjent et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2006), including chronic nicotine (Pagliusi et al. 1996; Nisell et al. 1997; Soderstrom et al. 2007). A long-lived truncated isoform of the FosB protein, ΔFosB, has been shown to accumulate within the striatum of rats treated repeatedly with either cocaine or nicotine (Hope et al. 1994; Pich et al. 1997; Nestler 2001). ΔFosB persists for several weeks in the brain, and represents an example of a sustained molecular change initiated by drug experience, although it cannot solely account for the perseverance of drug dependence.

Microarray technology has been employed to compare changes in gene expression in brain reward areas of rodents exposed to nicotine (Konu et al. 2001; Li et al. 2004; Vadasz et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008). Analysis of such studies in mice is complicated by strain differences, with implications for assessing transgenic animals (Kedmi and Orr-Utreger 2007; Vadasz et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008). Putative gene candidates arising from these studies are functionally diverse, and include examples involved in cell signalling, cell structure and gene regulation (such as zinc-finger DNA binding proteins). Although these studies have not clearly identified one (or more) common gene (or genes) that could underpin the addictive properties of nicotine, they all pinpoint genes encoding components of intracellular trafficking pathways. This is interesting in view of the upregulation of nAChRs following chronic nicotine treatment (see Sect. 3.4).

From the brain microarray studies following in vivo nicotine administration, it is not clear which nAChR subtypes are involved in initiating the observed changes in gene expression. Responses in SH-SY5Y cells suggest a complex interplay between α7 and non-α7 nAChR signalling (Dunckley and Lukas 2006). In this cell line, the lack of correspondence in the pattern of genes modified following either 1 h (Dunckley and Lukas 2003) or 24 h (Dunckley and Lukas 2006) of nicotine treatment highlights the complexity and time-dependency of the changes triggered by prolonged nicotine exposure. Indeed, in vivo acute and chronic nicotine treatments elicit distinct patterns of changes in total and phosphorylated proteins such as ERK1/2 and CREB (Brunzell et al. 2003), as well as in their targets (Salminen et al. 1999; Nuutinen et al. 2007), and withdrawal can precipitate another pattern of changes.

Recently, epigenetic mechanisms (responsible for “permanent” modifications of gene expression) are gaining attention in the field of abused drugs (Tsankova et al. 2007). Repression or enhancement of gene transcription is tightly linked to the state of chromatin compaction, and chromatin remodelling is achieved by complex post-translational modifications of histones. For example, phosphorylation of histone H3 is regulated by the ERK1/2 pathway (Girault et al. 2007). Although there is increasing evidence that cocaine triggers chromatin remodelling (Brami-Cherrier et al. 2005; Kumar et al. 2005; Tsankova et al. 2007), there is presently no report of nAChR-elicited covalent histone alterations in the brain in response to nicotine. Hence, further work is required to determine to what extent the persistence of nicotine-addicted behaviours involve chromatin remodelling and which nAChRs and signalling cascades are involved.
3.4 Mechanisms and Consequences of nAChR Upregulation

### 3.4.1 Paradoxical Effects of Prolonged Nicotine Exposure

The generation of nicotinic radioligands (including \[^3\text{H}]\)nicotine, \[^3\text{H}]\)epibatidine, \[^{125}\text{I}-\alpha\) Bgt, \[^3\text{H}]\)MLA and \[^{125}\text{I}-\alpha\) conotoxinMII) facilitated analysis of the distribution and density of nAChR binding sites in the brain (see chapter by Collins et al., this volume). Equilibrium binding experiments to determine the total number of binding sites (\(B_{\text{max}}\)) and apparent affinity for ligand (\(K_d\)) require long incubation times (typically, hours). In the case of agonist ligands, this prolonged exposure promotes nAChR desensitisation (Fig. 1a), hence \(K_d\) values will reflect the affinity of the desensitised nAChR for the agonist in question (Lippiello et al. 1987).

Early ligand binding studies indicated that chronic nicotine treatment increased the number of brain nAChR binding sites (Marks et al. 1983; Schwartz and Kellar 1983), and this was recapitulated in a comparison of brain tissue from smokers and non-smoker controls (Benwell et al. 1988; Wonnacott 1990). Two decades later, the ability of prolonged exposure to nicotine to upregulate nAChR binding sites is a robust observation, both in vivo, in numerous species (including mice, rats, monkeys and humans) and in vitro, in various homologous and heterologous expression systems (Gentry and Lukas 2002). A large variety of other nicotinic agonists, as well as some antagonists and compounds that enhance cholinergic transmission (such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors), also increase numbers of nAChRs, whereas numbers of muscarinic receptors are unaffected by prolonged nicotine exposure (Lapchak et al. 1989; Sanderson et al. 1993). The phenomenon reflects an increase in \(B_{\text{max}}\), with no change in receptor affinity, \(K_d\) (Wonnacott 1990). However, the mechanisms underlying this paradoxical effect, as well as its functional significance and role in addiction, are still debated.

### 3.4.2 Mechanisms of nAChR Upregulation

In the quest to understand the mechanisms of upregulation, many studies have focused on \(\alpha 4\beta 2^*\) nAChRs as they represent the most abundant high-affinity nAChR binding sites in the brain and are implicated in mediating the reinforcing properties of nicotine (Picciotto et al. 1998; Maskos et al. 2005). It is generally agreed that the reversible phenomenon of upregulation is an intrinsic feature of nAChRs (“receptor-autonomous”), requiring conserved cellular processes common to neuronal and non-neuronal systems (“cell-autonomous”) (Nashmi and Lester 2007). Upregulation of nAChR binding sites is not accompanied by any change in mRNA; therefore, the mechanism is post-transcriptional. It was originally posited that upregulation is a response to nAChR desensitisation or longer-term inactivation, due to nicotine acting at cell surface receptors (Dani and Heinemann 1996). However, comparison of different nicotine doses and administration schedules in rats showed that continuous administration and twice-daily infusions increased brain nAChR numbers, whereas more frequent intermittent schedules did not, despite achieving
comparable blood and brain nicotine levels (Rowell and Li 1997). In cultured cells in vitro, the concentration dependence of upregulation of α4β2 nAChRs matches neither the concentration dependence of nAChR activation nor desensitisation, for any given agonist (Whiteaker et al. 1998). Moreover, upregulation has also been provoked by both competitive (DHβE, MLA) and non-competitive (mecamylamine) antagonists (Peng et al. 1994; Gopalakrishnan et al. 1997; Whiteaker et al. 1998; Molinari et al. 1998; Gentry and Lukas 2002).

The agonist radioligands \[^3\text{H}]\)nicotine and \[^3\text{H}]\)epibatidine, which are most commonly used to monitor nAChR numbers, freely cross lipid bilayers. Therefore, they do not discriminate between intracellular and surface nAChRs and the majority of the increase in high-affinity binding sites appears to be intracellular (Whiteaker et al. 1998; Vallejo et al. 2005). It is now appreciated that nicotine can accumulate within cells and a new consensus is emerging that supports an intracellular action of nicotine that enhances assembly and/or maturation of nAChRs (Nashmi et al. 2003; Darsow et al. 2005; Kuryatov et al. 2005; Sallette et al. 2004, 2005; Nashmi and Lester 2007; Fig. 4).

The elegant studies of Lester and colleagues have exploited fluorescently tagged α4 and β2 subunits to facilitate analysis of subunit interactions using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Chronic nicotine treatment (1 μM, 24 h) increased the FRET signal, indicative of increased nAChR assembly (Nashmi et al. 2003). These results are consistent with the study of Sallette et al. (2004) that identified an extracellular microdomain close to the agonist binding site of the β2 subunit that is crucial for nicotine-induced nAChR upregulation. Subsequent metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation studies from the same group indicated the endoplasmic reticulum as the site where nicotine acts as a “maturation enhancer” (Sallette et al. 2005). Comparison of the localisation of immunolabelled nAChR subunits with markers that define various intracellular compartments also identified the site of the action of nicotine “at the level of, or prior to, the ER” (Darsow et al. 2005). The amount of mature β2 subunits detected with conformationally dependent antibodies increased following chronic nicotine, indicating that nicotine induced a conformational change in the β2 subunit that may favour or accelerate nAChR assembly (Sallette et al. 2005). This is also compatible with the change in stoichiometry of functional cell-surface nAChRs in heterologous expression systems, from (α4)₃(β2)₂ to (α4)₂(β2)₃, in response to chronic nicotine (Nelson et al. 2003; Moroni et al. 2006). Such a change could be driven by an increase in correctly folded β2 subunits. As the (α4)₂(β2)₃ stoichiometry displays increased sensitivity to ACh, this switch could have physiological consequences. If this stoichiometry also engenders higher affinity for nicotine, it reconciles the claim that upregulation reflects the stabilisation of α4β2 nAChRs in a high-affinity state (Vallejo et al. 2005).

The most parsimonious model for upregulation that accommodates current information suggests that nicotine binding to immature subunits enhances receptor assembly by provoking quaternary structure rearrangements (that might result in altered subunit stoichiometry), leading to accelerated maturation of nAChRs and a net

Within the endoplasmic reticulum, nicotine binds to nAChR subunits to facilitate assembly, or binds at the interface of an αβ subunit pair to enhance maturation of a pentameric nAChR (Sallette et al. 2004, 2005). The strong influence of nicotine on maturation of the β2 subunit might also favour a change in nAChR stoichiometry, from (α4)₃(β2)₂ to (α4)₂(β2)₃ (Moroni et al. 2006). These actions could result in an increase in the membrane insertion of competent nAChRs. The possibility of an additional action of nicotine to impede nAChR turnover or degradation is indicated by the dotted line. b Binding of nicotine to the extracellular domain of unassembled nAChR subunits facilitates assembly. c Binding of nicotine at an αβ interface facilitates maturation of a pentameric nAChR.

increase in high-affinity receptors (Fig. 4). Additional influences, such as decreased rate of turnover of membrane nAChRs (Kuryatov et al. 2005; Rezvani et al. 2007), may also contribute.  

### 3.4.3 Differential Upregulation of nAChR Subtypes  

The extent of upregulation varies with nAChR subtype and is typically much greater in cell lines than in native tissues after in vivo exposure to nicotine. The β2-containing nAChRs display the highest level of upregulation (Xiao and Kellar 2004), reflecting differences in the interface between adjacent α and β subunits, with respect to β2 versus β4 subunits (Sallette et al. 2004). Interestingly, inclusion of the
α5 subunit (which appears to associate exclusively with α4 and β2 subunits in native nAChRs) prevents upregulation in vivo (Mao et al. 2008). Thus, the intrinsic properties of each subunit influence the efficacy of upregulation, and this could contribute to regional differences in the extent of upregulation observed in response to nicotine treatment in vivo (Pauly et al. 1991).

In contrast to α4β2* nAChRs, measurements of α6β2 * nAChRs using quantitative autoradiography with ${}^{125}$I-αconotoxinMII show these receptors to be unchanged or decreased in number in the dopaminergic systems of both rodents and monkeys after chronic nicotine administration by a variety of routes (Lai et al. 2005; McCallum et al. 2006; Mugnaini et al. 2006). The α6β2* nAChRs also bind [${}^{3}$H]epibatidine and, when measured using this radioligand in transfected HEK cells such nAChRs, are upregulated in response to chronic nicotine (Tumkosit et al. 2006; Walsh et al. 2008). One interpretation that reconciles these disparate observations is that the impermeable antagonist ${}^{125}$I-αconotoxinMII does not label the same populations or states of the receptor as the permeable agonist [${}^{3}$H]epibatidine (Walsh et al. 2008); for example, the αconotoxin might only bind to fully mature nAChRs in the plasma membrane, whereas epibatidine labels multiple high-affinity states during the assembly and maturation process.

The upregulation of α7nAChRs, identified by binding of the antagonist snake toxin ${}^{125}$I-αBgt, suggests that a net increase in these receptors does occur in response to nicotine (Pauly et al. 1991; Rasmussen and Perry 2006). Additional or different mechanisms contribute to the upregulation of α7 nAChRs, compared with heteromeric nAChR subtypes (Ridley et al. 2001; Massey et al. 2006; Nuutinen et al. 2006). Upregulation of α7 nAChRs occurs at higher nicotine concentrations than required to increase α4β2 nAChRs (Pauly et al. 1991; Kawai and Berg 2001); therefore, the association of α7 nAChR upregulation with nicotine dependence is uncertain, with mixed reports in rodents treated with smokers’ levels of nicotine (Sanderson et al. 1993; Mugnaini et al. 2006; Rasmussen and Perry 2006). There are no reports of the density of α7 nAChR binding sites in the brains of human smokers, although α7 nAChR immunoreactivity in astrocytes is reported to be decreased in smokers (Teaktong et al. 2004).

### 3.4.4 Functional Status of Upregulated nAChRs

Although it has been widely assumed that the upregulation of high affinity nAChRs by nicotine must be central to nicotine addiction, direct evidence for this is lacking. Indeed, the functional status of upregulated nAChRs is still controversial (for a review, see Gentry and Lukas 2002). Addressing this question is hampered by the presence of the nicotine necessary to provoke upregulation (predicted to desensitise nAChRs), so adequate time for washout of drug (intracellular as well as extracellular) must be allowed. Direct measurement of nAChR activation using electrophysiology or rubidium (${}^{86}$Rb${}^{+}$) efflux assays can give different answers from those derived from downstream readouts, such as calcium fluorimetry or [${}^{3}$H]neurotransmitter release techniques. Some studies have demonstrated a lossof functional responses governed by various nAChR subtypes, including α7 and α4β2, following chronic nicotine exposure (Marks et al. 1993; Eilers et al. 1997; Olale et al. 1997; Ridley et al. 2002), while others have shown enhanced functionality of both α7 and non-α7 nAChRs (Buisson and Bertrand 2001; Nashmi et al. 2003; Sokolova et al. 2005). Surprisingly, Buisson and Bertrand (2001) found that ACh-evoked currents, albeit of small amplitude, could be recorded when K-177 cells expressing human α4β2 nAChRs were still bathed with nicotine, whereas other studies have emphasised the occurrence of long-term functional inactivation in response to sustained nicotine exposure (Eilers et al. 1997). In heterologous expression systems at least, it has been proposed that upregulation reflects the stabilisation of α4β2 nAChRs in a high affinity state that is more readily activated (Vallejo et al. 2005), perhaps reflecting a switch in the stoichiometry of α and β subunits, as discussed in Sect. 3.4.2.

Despite numerous studies, it remains uncertain what role, if any, upregulated nAChRs would have in the induction or maintenance of nicotine dependence. nAChR upregulation can be achieved in animals by paradigms that have little addiction liability in humans: nicotine delivery by osmotic minipumps best equates with transdermal nicotine delivery in humans. However, it is plausible that upregulated numbers of nAChR may play a role during nicotine withdrawal when exposure to nicotine is eliminated. Recovery of receptor function would generate enhanced responses to endogenous levels of ACh that could contribute to withdrawal symptoms or craving. Indeed, after 7 days of abstinence from smoking, human smokers subjected to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed higher levels of β2* nAChRs that correlated with the urge to smoke to relieve withdrawal symptoms (but not with the severity of either dependence or withdrawal) (Staley et al. 2006).

## 4 Concluding Remarks

nAChRs are the primary conduit for the effects of nicotine on the CNS. Detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with these receptors has emerged in recent years and reveals several levels of complexity. The molecular diversity of nAChR subunits creates a wide array of subtypes differing in their sensitivity to nicotine and in their intrinsic properties. The inclusion or omission of a single subunit can have significant impact; for example, the effect of the α5 subunit on nAChR function and upregulation. The differential cellular and subcellular localisation of these nAChRs is very pertinent to the propensity of nicotine to induce and sustain dependence. The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and associated GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs are endowed with a rich repertoire of nAChRs, whose functional significance is only partly understood. Mechanistically, nAChRs can exist in multiple states and the balance between activation and desensitisation (which varies with nAChR subtype) is considered critical for the reinforcing properties of nicotine. At a cellular level, the ability of nAChRs to elicit
significant changes in intracellular Ca²⁺ facilitates the engagement of downstream signalling pathways, allowing both short-term changes, such as presynaptic plasticity, and longer-term influences realised through modification of gene transcription, and perhaps involving epigenetic alterations. Unravelling these contributions in the context of tobacco smoking – a complex nicotine delivery profile associated with powerful reinforcing cues – remains a challenge.
