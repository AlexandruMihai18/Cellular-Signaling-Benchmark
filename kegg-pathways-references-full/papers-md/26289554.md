Pauline Peltier-Pain,${}^{[a,c]}$ Shanteri Singh,${}^{[b]}$ and Jon S. Thorson*${}^{[b]}$

The characterization of TDP-$\alpha$-D-glucose dehydrogenase (AtmS8), TDP-$\alpha$-D-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (AtmS9), and TDP-4-keto-$\alpha$-D-xylose 2,3-dehydratase (AtmS14), involved in *Actinomadura melliaura* AT2433 aminodeoxypentose biosynthesis, is reported. This study provides the first biochemical evidence that both deoxypentose and deoxyhexose biosynthetic pathways share common strategies for sugar 2,3-dehydration/reduction and implicates the sugar nucleotide base specificity of AtmS14 as a potential mechanism for sugar nucleotide commitment to secondary metabolism. In addition, a re-evaluation of the AtmS9 homologue involved in calicheamicin aminodeoxypentose biosynthesis (CalS9) reveals that CalS9 catalyzes UDP-4-keto-$\alpha$-D-xylose as the predominant product, rather than UDP-$\alpha$-D-xylose as previously reported. Cumulatively, this work provides additional fundamental insights regarding the biosynthesis of novel pentoses attached to complex bacterial secondary metabolites.

genomics of the AT2433,$^{[10]}$ calicheamicin,$^{[11]}$ and rebeccamycin$^{[12]}$ biosynthetic loci provided the basis for an aminodeoxypentose biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 2), consistent with the esperamicin metabolic labeling studies$^{[8]}$ further bolstered through biochemical characterization of CalS8 as a TDP-$\alpha$-D-glucose dehydrogenase$^{[13]}$ and biosynthetic studies of amino-pentose-containing Gram-negative exopolysaccharides.$^{[14]}$ To extend these studies, we report herein the biochemical characterization of AtmS8 (TDP-$\alpha$-D-glucose dehydrogenase), AtmS9 (TDP-$\alpha$-D-glucuronic acid decarboxylase), and AtmS14 (TDP-4-keto-$\alpha$-D-xylose 2,3-dehydratase), as well as the NMR characterization of corresponding key reactants/products. This work highlights the early enzymes (AtmS8 and AtmS9) as being base permissive and AtmS14 as TDP-sugar specific. Consistent with the well-established precedent of 4-ketosugars as key precursors to deoxyhexose 2,3-dehydration/reduction,$^{[15]}$ this study also confirms the keto-sugar nucleotide TDP-4-keto-$\alpha$-D-xylose as the decarboxylase product, in contrast to prior work implicating the AtmS9 homologue CalS9 (72% homology, 60% identity, calicheamicin biosynthesis) as a catalyst for both C5-decarboxylation and C4-reduction.$^{[16]}$ Cumulatively, this study provides further support for the pathway put forth in Scheme 2 and notably provides the first biochemical evidence that the biosynthetic strategies for 2,3-dehydration/reduction of deoxypentose and deoxyhexose are conserved. As such, this work lays the foundation for comparative mechanistic and structural studies to further probe points of biosynthetic convergence/divergence.

In the AT2433 producer *Actinomadura melliaura*, a total of seven enzymes are postulated to participate in TDP-2,4-di-deoxy-4-methylamino-$\beta$-L-xylose (9) biosynthesis, with putative function based on BLAST analysis: AtmS7, $\alpha$-D-glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase; AtmS8, TDP-$\alpha$-D-glucose dehydrogenase; AtmS9, TDP-$\alpha$-D-glucuronic acid decarboxylase; AtmS14, TDP-4-keto-$\alpha$-D-xylose 2,3-dehydratase; AtmS12, TDP-2-deoxy-4-keto-$\alpha$-D-pentos-2-ene 2,3-reductase; AtmS13, TDP-2-deoxy-4-keto-$\beta$-L-xylose 3-aminotransferase;$^{[10b]}$ and AtmS10, TDP-4-amino-2,4-dideoxy-$\beta$-L-xylose 3-N-methyltransferase (Scheme 2).$^{[10]}$ For this study, *atmS8* and *atmS9* were amplified directly from *A. melliaura* genomic template DNA, whereas *atmS14* was amplified from a pUC57 vector containing a codon-optimized synthetic gene by PCR. The corresponding *atmS8*, *atmS9*, and *atmS14* gene-containing PCR fragments were digested and subsequently cloned into pET28a, and the resulting constructs were used to transform *Escherichia coli* BL21(DE3) to provide overproduction strains of the corre-

Although HPLC-based discontinuous assays are the most common strategy for the study of sugar nucleotide-dependent biosynthetic enzymes, [17] alternative NMR-based assays offer convenient real-time detection of reactants/products that are unstable or poorly resolved by HPLC. [18] The current study employed a combination of reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC and in situ NMR to assess enzyme-catalyzed turnover and support product characterization. The in situ NMR reactions were conducted in a 5 mm NMR tube at 30 °C under standard assay conditions (Supporting Information) in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 50–70% D<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.5. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and incubated at 30 °C for 2–4 h before the acquisition of 1D-<sup>1</sup>H NMR with water pre-saturation (referred to as 1D-<sup>1</sup>H henceforth) spectra. Reaction progress was monitored by the appearance of new product-based resonances and consequent decreases in the intensity of substrate signals in the 1D-<sup>1</sup>H spectra and, depending on the progress, the reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and 1D spectra were acquired at different time intervals until the reactions neared completion. Where applicable, corresponding correlative HPLC assays followed standard protocols.

To confirm the putative steps/enzymes involved in the conversion of 2 to 5, the reaction was initiated by the addition of AtmS8 (10 μM) to an assay mixture containing commercially available TDP-α-D-glucose (2-T) and an excess of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the absence or presence of an NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration system (Supporting Information) to potentially help drive the equilibrium toward the desired product, 3-T (Figure 1 A and B). Nearly complete conversion of 2-T to 3-T in the presence of the NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration system was observed in 16 h at 30 °C (Figure 1 A and B), as calculated by the ratio of the intensity of anomeric proton signals of the product to substrate in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra (δ = 5.57 and 5.60 ppm, respectively; see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). Under these conditions, the HPLC retention times for 2-T and 3-T were 21.8 min and 26.6 min, respectively, with products also confirmed by HRMS (Supporting Information). No reaction was observed by NMR or HPLC in controls lacking AtmS8.

Upon near completion of the AtmS8 reaction to 3-T, based on NMR, the addition of AtmS9 (15 μM) led to quantitative conversion of 3-T to 4-T (Figure 2 A) over 15 h at 30 °C, as observed by HPLC (4-T, 17.9 min) and the signature 4-T anomeric proton in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra (5.57 ppm). The identity of 4-T as the product was also confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C HSQC (Table S1) and HRMS. No reaction was observed by NMR or HPLC in controls lacking AtmS9.

Following completion of the AtmS9 reaction to 4-T, AtmS14 (14 μM) was added, and the reaction was monitored by HPLC and NMR at 30 °C. HPLC revealed two new products: 3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one (6, 6.8 min) and TDP (20.9 min; Figure S3). Consistent with this, the H<sub>a</sub>, H<sub>b</sub>, and H<sub>c</sub> protons of 6 (7.90 and 6.44 ppm) were also clearly observed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR (Figure 3), and the presence of 6 was also confirmed by HRMS. As the first pentose-based example, the degradative formation of 6 from 5-T is consistent with the pioneering hexose-based

precedent first observed by Floss and Liu. Specifically, within the context of assays for TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-α-D-glucose 2,3-dehydratases (Gra Orf27<sup>[15b]</sup> and TylX3<sup>[15b]</sup>) the TDP-2,6-dideoxy-4-keto-α-D-hexos-2-ene product was found to rapidly degrade to TDP and 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one (i.e., 2-methyl-substituted 6). Thus, the current study provides the first biochemical validation of the proposed mechanistic conservation among sugar nucleotide-dependent enzymes involved in pentose/hexose 2-deoxygenation.

To test the nucleotide specificity of AtmS8, AtmS9, and AtmS14 enzymes, similar reactions were performed in which TDP-α-D-glucose (2-T) was replaced with commercially available ADP-α-D-glucose, CDP-α-D-glucose, GDP-α-D-glucose, or

UDP-$\alpha$-d-glucose (2-U). Of these, only 2-U led to $\sim$10% product (3-U) in the presence of AtmS8 and the NAD${}^{+}$ regeneration system in 16 h at $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Figure 1 C). In contrast, the subsequent AtmS9-catalyzed conversion of 3-U to 4-U was quantitative (Figure 2B) but could not proceed to 6 (by 5-U), even in the presence of excess AtmS14 over extended incubation times (data not shown). This implicates the sugar nucleotide base specificity of AtmS14, and to a lesser extent AtmS8, as a potential mechanism for the commitment of specific sugar nucleotides to secondary metabolite production. Consistent with this, the calicheamicin aminodeoxypentosyl transferase CalG4 has

Taken together, this study supports the steps proposed for an amino-deoxypentose pathway common to AT2433 and calicheamicin and lays a foundation for comparative mechanistic and structural studies among deoxyhexose and deoxypentose biosynthetic enzymes.

### Experimental Section

#### General methods: High-resolution electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra (HRMS) were carried out at the Small Molecule Mass Spectrometry Core Laboratory of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. HRMS data were recorded on an AB Sciex Triple TOF 5600 instrument coupled with an Eksigent Ekspert micro LC 200 system with source temperature of 150 °C and ion spray voltage floating (ISVF) of 5000 V in positive mode. Samples were infused at 20 μL min⁻¹, and spectra were collected for 3 min at a resolution greater than 31000. In negative mode, an ISVF of –4000 V was used. C17 lysophosphatidyl choline, with a mass of 510.3554, and C17 lysophosphatidic acid, with a mass of 423.2517, were used as internal references to calibrate the spectra in positive and negative modes, respectively. NMR experiments were carried on a 600 MHz Varian VNMR spectrometer equipped with a z-axis gradient 5 mm HCN cold probe at the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison (NMRFAM). Prior to HPLC analysis, protein was removed by using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device. Analytical RP-HPLC was conducted with a Gemini NX C-18 (5 μm, 250×4.6 mm) column (from Phenomenex, Torrance, California, USA) with a gradient of 1% B to 50% B over 30 min, 50% B for 5 min, 50% B to 1% over 1 min, 1% B for 7 min (A=50 mm phosphate buffer pH 6 with 5 mm tetrabutylammonium bisulfate; B=acetonitrile; flow rate=1 mL min⁻¹), and detection monitored at 254 nm.

Enzyme reactions (500–650 μL final volume) were performed in 25–50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH/pD 7.5 (10–20% D₂O). NMR spectra were collected at 30 °C in 5 mm NMR tubes on a 600 MHz Varian (Palo Alto, CA) VNMR spectrometers equipped with a z-axis gradient 5 mm HCN cold probe. The probe was tuned and shimmed before the addition of enzyme. 1D proton NMR with water pre-saturation (referred simply as 1D-¹H NMR henceforth) was used after the addition of the enzyme to monitor the appearance of new signals corresponding to product formation. Processing of the spectra was accomplished by using MestReNova (Santiago de Compostela, Spain), and the proton axis was referenced to the water resonance at 4.766 ppm.

In vitro characterization of AtmS8: The AtmS8 reaction was initiated directly in a 5 mm NMR tube in a volume of 500 μL (50% D₂O) with 2 mm unlabeled TDP-α-d-glucose or UDP-α-d-glucose (Sigma–Aldrich), 6 mm of NAD⁺, 1 mm MgCl₂, 1 mm DTT in 50 mm NaH₂PO₄ buffer, pH 7.5 at 30 °C with the addition of AtmS8 (10 μM) in the presence and absence of an NAD⁺ regeneration system (6 mm pyruvate and 2.7 U μL⁻¹ lactate dehydrogenase). 1D-¹H NMR spectra were recorded at regular intervals and monitored for the changes in the intensity of the anomeric proton signal for the depletion of the substrate and subsequent formation of product. The reaction was ~97% complete after 16 h incubation at 30 °C, as calculated by the ratio of the product to substrate signals from RP-HPLC and 1D-¹H NMR (Figure 1), where the glucuronic acid NMR chemical shift signatures (Table S1) were also found to match those of commercial standard, UDP-GlcA (Sigma–Aldrich). Reaction aliquots were also used for HRMS (Section 4 in the Supporting Information).

In vitro characterization of AtmS9: The AtmS9 reaction employed the reaction mixture from above section and was initiated by adding 15 μM AtmS9. The reaction was monitored by 1D-¹H NMR spectra. Complete conversion of the substrate to product was observed after overnight incubation at 30 °C, as calculated by the ratio of the product to substrate signals from 1D-¹H NMR (Figure 2 and Figure S2), where the NMR chemical shifts (Table S1) were found to be consistent with previously reported data.\[^{19a}\] Reaction aliquots were also used for HRMS (Section 4 in the Supporting Information).

In vitro characterization of AtmS14: AtmS14 (14 μM) was added to the above reaction mixture, and the reaction was monitored by 1D-¹H NMR at regular intervals at 30 °C. Complete degradation of 4-T to pyromicomic acid (6) and TDP was observed in 6 h after the initiation of the reaction, as observed by 1D-¹H NMR spectra (Figure 3) and RP-HPLC (Figure S3). Reaction aliquots were also used for HRMS (Section 4 in the Supporting Information).
