### Abstract

Pemetrexed is a novel multitargeted antifolate that inhibits ≥ 3 enzymes involved in folate metabolism and purine and pyrimidine synthesis. These enzymes are thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinate ribonucleotide formyltransferase. This agent has broad antitumor activity in phase II trials in a wide variety of solid tumors, and is approved in combination with cisplatin for the therapy of malignant mesothelioma. In a recent phase III trial, pemetrexed demonstrated equivalent efficacy to docetaxel, but with significantly less toxicity, in second-line treatment of non–small-cell lung cancer. The most common and serious toxicities of pemetrexed—myelosuppression and mucositis—have been significantly ameliorated by folic acid and vitamin B₁₂ supplementation. More important, vitamin supplementation has not been shown to adversely affect efficacy in some tumor types. Tumors with codeletion of the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene, as a consequence of p16 deletions, may be particularly sensitive to pemetrexed. In this review, the biochemistry and mechanism of action of pemetrexed are discussed.

### Introduction

Pyrimidine and purines, the basic building blocks of DNA, have been targeted for cancer therapy for several decades. Perturbation of nucleotide metabolism for cancer therapy has primarily focused on the use of nucleoside- and nucleic acid–based analogues, which compete with their physiological counterparts for incorporation into DNA and RNA.¹ A recent, novel approach to inhibiting purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways is the development of pemetrexed, which inhibits tumor growth by inhibiting ≥ 3 metabolic enzymes. These are the folate-dependent enzymes, thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and the purine biosynthetic enzyme, glycinate ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT).²

### Structure of Pemetrexed

Pemetrexed (N-[4-[2-(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-ethyl]-benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid) is distinguished from other antifolates by the presence of a unique 6-5 fused pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus.³ The core structures of other antifolates such as methotrexate and raltitrexed contain 6-6 fused pteridine or quinazoline rings (Figure 1).

### Transport and Activation of Pemetrexed

Pemetrexed is transported into cells via the reduced folate carrier (RFC), with transport kinetics similar to those of methotrexate, and binds to folate receptor-α with a very high affinity, similar to that of folic acid.⁴⁵ Pemetrexed also appears to be a substrate for multidrug resistance protein (MRP) exporters.⁶ When it enters cells, pemetrexed is polyglutamated to the active pentaglutamate. This reaction is catalyzed by folypolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). Pemetrexed has been shown to be one of the best substrates for FPGS when compared with numerous other classical antifolates.⁷

The pentaglutamate form of pemetrexed is the predominant intracellular form and is > 60 times more potent in its inhibition of TS than is the monoglutamate form.² Polyglutamation traps pemetrexed and enhances its intracellular retention. The parent drug is polyglutamated 90-195 times more efficiently than methotrexate and 6-13 times more efficiently than lometrexol.⁷ The increased cellular retention of polyglutamated pemetrexed forms may explain the success of the every-3-week administration schedule.

pointed out that pemetrexed is 30-200 times more potent an inhibitor of TS than of aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase or GARFT, suggesting that its cytotoxicity may be mediated predominantly through TS inhibition. However, pemetrexed demonstrates activity against H630 colon cancer cell lines, which are resistant to raltitrexed and 5-fluorouracil because of TS amplification. Thus, inhibition of the other folate enzymes is important for pemetrexed’s clinical activity.

## Mechanisms of Resistance

A multitude of mechanisms of resistance to methotrexate have been described in preclinical systems, including (1) increased overexpression of DHFR or decreased affinity of methotrexate for DHFR caused by single amino acid substitutions in this enzyme; (2) defective membrane transport due to qualitative or quantitative alterations in the RFC; (3) increased adenosine triphosphate-driven antifolate efflux via members of the MRP family, including MRP1 and MRP3; and (4) decreased antifolate polyglutamylation due to qualitative or quantitative alterations in FPGS activity.

Because of its inhibition of multiple folate-dependent enzymes, it has been hypothesized that resistance to pemetrexed will be less prevalent than resistance to methotrexate. Other properties of pemetrexed supporting this hypothesis are the efficient transport by the RFC and the high affinity for FPGS.

While this may be true, resistance mechanisms to pemetrexed have been described. First, decreased expression of FPGS has been shown to be a possible resistance mechanism. In a recent study, decreased expression of FPGS was correlated with resistance of L1210 cells to pemetrexed. In addition, Liani et al used an FPGS mutation screening assay to demonstrate that depressed FPGS activity is the predominant mechanism of high-level resistance to pemetrexed and other polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates upon a clinically relevant exposure schedule in leukemia cells.

Second, pemetrexed polyglutamates have been shown to be excellent substrates for folylpolyglutamate hydrolase, having higher rates of hydrolysis by this enzyme than methotrexate polyglutamates. Thus, the clinical effectiveness of pemetrexed may be inversely related to cellular glutamyl hydrolase activity.

Finally, the MRPs, particularly MRP2 and MRP5, have been shown to transport pemetrexed and may confer resistance to this agent.

## Determinants of Efficacy of Pemetrexed

### Cellular Transport

As mentioned in the introductory section, pemetrexed is active in malignant mesothelioma. Wang et al recently described the presence of a novel, concentrative high-affinity transport system in 3 human mesothelioma cell lines. Further characterization demonstrated a pemetrexed influx K(t) of 30 nmol/L and V_max of 10 nmol/g protein per minute. This influx mechanism is highly specific for pemetrexed, with a substrate specificity pattern quite different from that of the reduced folate carrier and of folate receptors. In particular, this transporter had a relatively low affinity for other inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase,

## Mechanism of Action

Pemetrexed inhibits multiple enzyme targets involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis (Figure 2). One of these primary targets of action is TS. Thymidylate synthase, a folate-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the transformation of deoxyuridine monophosphate to deoxythymidine monophosphate. Inhibition of TS results in decreased thymidine necessary for DNA synthesis. In addition to TS, pemetrexed inhibits DHFR, as well as GARFT; the latter is a folate-dependent enzyme that is involved in purine synthesis. These targets are related to the cytotoxicity of pemetrexed, as thymidine and hypoxanthine are required to circumvent cellular death caused by pemetrexed at high doses. It should be

such as methotrexate, and inhibitors of thymidylate synthase, such as raltitrexed. The presence of this transporter may explain, in part, the differences in efficacy patterns between pemetrexed and other antifolates.

### Deficiency of Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase

Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) converts methylthioadenosine, a product of polyamine synthesis, to adenine and methylthioribose-1-phosphate. Adenine is used for the synthesis of adenosine monophosphate. This represents an important salvage mechanism for cells to recoup purines for DNA synthesis. Methylthioribose-1-phosphate is used for methionine synthesis. Thus, tumor cells that lack MTAP are completely dependent on de novo synthesis of purine derivatives for the generation of AMP and therefore are expected to be sensitive to inhibitors of the de novo purine synthesis pathway, such as methotrexate, 5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolate [DDATHF], and pemetrexed.

Cytogenetic and molecular studies have identified several frequent genetic alterations in cancer cells. One of the common deletions in certain solid tumors is the homozygous deletion of the 9p21 locus within a cluster of genes that includes CDKN2B, CDKN2A, and MTAP. CDKN2A encodes 2 important cell cycle regulatory proteins, the p16 protein and, in an alternative reading frame, the p14ARF protein. P16, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, acts through CDK4/CDK6 and blocks the phosphorylation of the RB protein, and p14ARF binds MDM2, thus preventing the latter from binding p53 and targeting it for degradation. Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase encodes methylthioadenosine, which has been described previously. In a recent study, Illei et al demonstrated the homozygous deletion of CDKN2A in the majority (70 of 95, or 74%) of pleural mesotheliomas. Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase was codeleted in most (64 of 70, or 91%) of these cases. Such codeletions of MTAP have been found in a number of other epithelial tumors.

It is expected that tumors with a high prevalence of MTAP codeletions may be particularly sensitive to purine inhibitors such as pemetrexed.

The frequency of MTAP codeletions and a specific pemetrexed transporter in mesothelioma may partly explain the efficacy of pemetrexed in this difficult-to-treat disease.

### Determinants of Toxicity

The toxicity of pemetrexed has been reviewed recently. Myelosuppression is the most common and dose-limiting toxicity, and is manifested predominantly as neutropenia, with the nadir around day 10 and recovery generally by day 15. In early clinical trials, the incidence of grade III/IV neutropenia

was approximately 50%. Febrile neutropenia and neutropenic sepsis were, however, relatively infrequent. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are relatively uncommon (< 10%).

The most common nonhematologic toxicity is elevation of hepatic aminotransferases. Grade 1/2 hepatic enzyme elevations occur in 60%-70% of patients and are commonly transient, with return to baseline by the start of the subsequent cycle. Grade 4 liver function abnormalities are exceedingly rare, and grade 3 abnormalities occur in approximately 12% of patients. In comparison to aminotransferases, serum bilirubin abnormalities are uncommon (9% grades 1/2). Cutaneous toxicity, or rash, was common and sometimes severe in early studies. This was manifested as a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash with a predominantly truncal distribution. However, with the use of prophylactic corticosteroids, this toxicity has been substantially reduced in both severity and frequency. Mucositis is occasionally severe, nausea and vomiting are typically mild, and, similar to other antimetabolites, alopecia is rare.

### Pemetrexed Dosing in Renal Insufficiency

Pemetrexed is cleared predominantly by the kidneys. Thus, patients with a creatinine clearance of ≤ 45 mL per minute, calculated with the mean body weight by the formula of Cockcroft and Gault, were excluded from studies with pemetrexed. Takimoto and colleagues recently studied pemetrexed in patients with renal impairment and demonstrated that pretreatment glomerular filtration rate (GFR) strongly correlated with pemetrexed clearance (r² = 0.63). These results suggest-

ed that a standard dose of 500 mg/m² can be safely given to patients with mild renal dysfunction (GFR 40). More data are needed in patients with greater degrees of renal impairment.²³

## Pemetrexed and Body Fluid Accumulation

Methotrexate, the classical antifolate agent, accumulates in “third space” body fluids such as ascites and pleural effusions, leading to prolonged unpredictable toxicity. Based on this, it had been assumed that pemetrexed would behave in an analogous fashion. Therefore, in studies performed with this agent until now, patients with clinically significant effusions have been excluded.²⁰ Future studies will be needed to determine whether pemetrexed accumulates in body fluid collections leading to enhanced toxicity.

## Drug Interactions

In addition to accumulation in body fluids, it has also been presumed but not proven that concomitant administration of pemetrexed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) would lead to decreased renal clearance of pemetrexed, with enhanced toxicity as seen with methotrexate.²⁴ Patients have therefore been required to avoid NSAIDS a few days before and after administration of pemetrexed. Future studies are needed to confirm or disprove this potential drug interaction.

## Folate Deficiency and Toxicity of Pemetrexed

Severe, unpredictable, and occasionally fatal myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicities have been associated with antifolate agents. The amelioration of these toxicities by the administration of folic acid is well known.²⁵ However, it has been extremely difficult to correlate antifolate-induced toxicity with pretreatment folate levels, measured as red blood cell folate or serum folate, in patients. Data accumulated in the past few years suggest that plasma homocysteine is a much more sensitive measure of the functional folate status of patients than red blood cell or serum folate.²⁶ With this insight into cellular folate metabolism, the role of the folate status of patients in the toxicity of pemetrexed has been delineated.

### Measurement of Functional Folate Status

The major donor of methyl groups for a variety of fundamental processes in mammals is s-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Methionine, which is used in the synthesis of SAM, is generated by the transfer of a methyl group from N⁵-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH₃FH₄) to homocysteine (Figure 3). Thus, under conditions of folate deprivation, plasma homocysteine levels increase. This is the most sensitive indicator of functional folate status.²⁷ Vitamin B₁₂ (cobalamin) and vitamin B₆ (pyridoxine) deficiencies can also result in high homocysteine levels. However, cystathionine levels are markedly elevated in vitamin B₆ deficiency and are elevated to a lesser extent in folate and B₁₂ deficiency.²⁸ Thus, cystathionine levels can distinguish vitamin B₆ deficiency from folate or vitamin B₁₂ deficiency. It should be noted, however, that isolated vitamin B₆ deficiency is very uncommon.

### Vitamin Supplementation Ameliorates Toxicity

As discussed previously, initial phase I/II studies of pemetrexed indicated that myelosuppression was the main toxicity. Niyikiza and colleagues²⁹ used multivariate stepwise regression methods to analyze baseline physiologic and demographic data from individuals enrolled in these early pemetrexed trials. The objective was to identify predictive variables for severe toxicity. Variables analyzed included serum homocysteine, cystathionine, methylmalonic acid, albumin, and other hepatic enzymes. These analyses indicated that an elevated plasma homocysteine concentration was indicative of preclinical folate deficiency and resulted in a more severe toxicity profile that typically included

thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and severe diarrhea and mucositis. The threshold baseline homocysteine value of 10 mmol/L appeared to be the cutoff for these toxicities after cycle 1 (χ² = 6.2; P = 0.01), with levels > 10 μmol/L predicting for an increased rate of toxicity. All patients enrolled in pemetrexed clinical trials over the past 2 to 3 years receive folic acid and vitamin B₁₂ supplementation, as described later. Current data indicate that this supplemental use of vitamins can ameliorate some of the severe drug-induced toxic effects, resulting in an improved safety profile and efficacy for this drug.³⁰,³¹

## Standard Dosing of Pemetrexed

Currently, pemetrexed is administered as a 10-minute infusion every 3 weeks at a dose of 500 mg/m². As previously mentioned, coadministration with NSAIDs is not allowed. Patients receive folic acid and vitamin B₁₂ supplementation as follows: oral folic acid tablets 350-1000 μg starting ≥ 5 continuous days before pemetrexed administration and continuing throughout the course of therapy. Intramuscular vitamin B₁₂ at 1000 μg is administered with folic acid and repeated every 9 weeks while patient is on study.

## Conclusion

Pemetrexed is a broadly active novel antimetabolite whose toxicity is predictable on coadministration of vitamins. The determinants of sensitivity and resistance to this agent continue to be elucidated.
