Trucksis, Michele, Timothy L. Conn, Steven S. Wasserman, and Cynthia L. Sears. Vibrio cholerae ACE stimulates Ca²⁺-dependent Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ secretion in T84 cells in vitro. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 279: C567–C577, 2567.—ACE, accessory cholera enterotoxin, the third enterotoxin in Vibrio cholerae, has been reported to increase short-circuit current (Isc) in rabbit ileum and to cause fluid secretion in ligated rabbit ileal loops. We studied the ACE-induced change in Isc and potential difference (PD) in T84 monolayers mounted in modified Ussing chambers, an in vitro model of a Cl⁻ secretory cell. ACE added to the apical surface alone stimulated a rapid increase in Isc and PD that was concentration dependent and immediately reversed when the toxin was removed. Ion replacement studies established that the current was dependent on Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻. ACE acted synergistically with the Ca²⁺-dependent acetylcholine analog, carbachol, to stimulate secretion in T84 monolayers. In contrast, the secretory response to cAMP or cGMP agonists was not enhanced by ACE. The ACE-stimulated secretion was dependent on extracellular and intracellular Ca²⁺ but was not associated with an increase in intracellular cyclic nucleotides. We conclude that the mechanism of secretion by ACE involves Ca²⁺ as a second messenger and that this toxin stimulates a novel Ca²⁺-dependent synergy.

COLONIZATION OF THE SMALL INTESTINE by Vibrio cholerae causes the potentially lethal disease cholera due to massive salt and water secretion. The dehydrating diarrhea of cholera is attributed primarily to the intestinal secretion stimulated by cholera toxin (CT) (28). However, two other toxins of V. cholerae that alter short-circuit current (Isc) and/or resistance in Ussing chambers have been identified. These are zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) (8, 10), which acts by disrupting tight junctions, and accessory cholera enterotoxin (ACE) (32).

We have previously reported the identification, cloning, and purification of the ACE protein (31, 32). We now report the investigation of the mechanism of action of ACE utilizing the Cl⁻-secreting T84 epithelial cell line. This cell line is derived from a human colonic carcinoma, resembles crypt cells morphologically, and secretes Cl⁻ in response to secretagogues whose actions are mediated via cAMP-, cGMP-, or Ca²⁺-related mechanisms (3). With the utilization of T84 cell monolayers, we identified that ACE stimulates anion secretion in T84 cells, and we showed that this is dependent on the apical influx of extracellular Ca²⁺ and most likely select intracellular Ca²⁺ pools. Furthermore, ACE exhibits a novel synergy with the acetylcholine analog carbachol, but not with cyclic nucleotide-dependent agonists including the heat-stable enterotoxin type a (STa) of Escherichia coli and forskolin.

METHODS

Materials. CT, E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin, carbachol, collagen, bumetanide, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-AM, nifedipine, verapamil, ω-conotoxin GVIA, clotrimazole, dantrolene, staurosporine, DIDS, nystatin, genistein, and thapsigargin were obtained from Sigma Chemical. Forskolin was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA).

Sample preparation for Ussing chambers. Cultures of V. cholerae bacterial strains ACE⁻ (CVD113, CT⁻, ZOT⁻, ACE⁻) (11) and ACE⁺ [CVD113, (pCVD630, ACE⁺)] (11, 32) were grown in L broth at 37°C with shaking. Culture supernatants were prepared by centrifugation followed by filtration through a 0.45-μm filter. The filtered supernatant was then fractionated and concentrated 1,000-fold using Pall Filtron Omega stir cells (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA) to obtain a 5,000–30,000 relative molecular weight (Mr) fraction. The fraction was washed and resuspended in PBS. The partially purified ACE⁺ and ACE⁻ supernatants were used for all experiments except where noted. The concentration of ACE in the partially purified supernatants was estimated at 4.5 × 10⁻⁷ M based on a comparison of peak ΔIsc induced by the partially purified supernatants, compared with the peak ΔIsc induced by using purified ACE toxin (see Fig. 3B). Native purified ACE monomer (see RESULTS) was used in a subset of 1–2 experiments of each type to confirm that purified ACE gave the same results as the partially purified preparation.

In addition, the concentration-response experiments (see Fig. 3B) were performed with native purified ACE monomer. All samples were stored at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until tested in Ussing chambers.

**Cell culture and filter preparation.** T84 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 nutrient supplement with $29 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}, 20 \mathrm{mM}$ HEPES, $50 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{ml}$ penicillin, $50 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml}$ streptomycin, and $10 \%$ fetal bovine serum. T84 cells were plated onto collagen-coated Transwell polycarbonate inserts (Corning Costar, Acton, MA) at a density of $7 \times 10^{4}$ cells/cm². Transepithelial resistances attained stable levels ($>1,000 \Omega / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$) after 12 days.

**Ussing chamber voltage-clamp transport studies.** Transepithelial transport studies were carried out across T84 confluent monolayers in a simplified apparatus for measuring electrophysiological parameters (surface area $1.0 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$) designed for study of filter-grown cells previously described by Madara et al. (23). $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and open-circuit PD measurements were carried out in culture media (except where noted to be in Ringer or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-$, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-, or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-free Ringer) using Ag-AgCl and calomel electrodes via $4 \%$ agar bridges made with Ringer buffer. The electrodes were connected to an automatic voltage clamp (DVC 1000; World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT). The PD was recorded under open-circuit conditions every $10 \mathrm{~min}$ (or at shorter intervals as displayed in RESULTS), and then the voltage was clamped and the $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ was recorded (19, 20). Resistance of the monolayer was calculated from the $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and open-circuit PD according to Ohm's law. Ringer solution contained (in mM) $140 \mathrm{Na}^{+}, 25 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}, 5.2 \mathrm{K}^{+}, 1.2 \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, 1.2 \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, 119.8 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, 0.4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}, 2.4 \mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}, 10$ glucose, and $5 \mathrm{HEPES}$, pH 7.4. For the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-free Ringer, the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ was replaced by sodium isethionate, and the $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$ were replaced by $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$ at the same molarities. For the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-free Ringer, the $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ was replaced by sodium isethionate. In experiments where the effect of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ on ACE secretory activity was examined, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free Ringer (9) with the following composition was used (in mM): $140 \mathrm{Na}^{+}, 25 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}, 5.2 \mathrm{K}^{+}, 1.0 \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, 117 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, 0.4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}, 2.4 \mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}, 10$ glucose, $5 \mathrm{HEPES}$, and $1.0 \mathrm{EGTA}$, pH 7.4. The intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-$N, N, N^{\prime}, N^{\prime}$-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) was loaded into the cells during a 1-h preincubation period in Ringer solution at the desired concentration.

**Purification of native ACE toxin.** Culture supernatant of wild-type V. cholerae strain E7946 was fractionated using Pall Filtron Omega stir cells and a Mini Prep Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories) as reported previously (31). Both the monomer and dimer forms of the ACE toxin were purified separately, as previously reported, and each yielded a single band with silver stain (data not shown).

**Measurement of cyclic nucleotides.** T84 cells grown on Costar inserts were treated with ACE, forskolin, V. cholerae CT, *E. coli* STa, and carbachol as described in the text. Intracellular cAMP was extracted with ice-cold $50 \%$ ethanol-$50 \%$ Ringer solution (vol/vol). Extraction for cGMP measurements was performed with ice-cold $67 \%$ ethanol-$33 \%$ Ringer solution (vol/vol). The cell extracts were frozen at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until assayed by cyclic nucleotide enzyme immunoassay (EIA, cAMP, and cGMP) system (Amersham Life Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

**Statistical analysis.** The effects of various treatments were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) where the dependent variable was PD or $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$, the independent variable was the treatment group (treated vs. control), and with time 0 as a covariate. Each of these analyses were tested for a group effect (i.e., mean difference in PD between treatment groups) and a group × time interaction (differential change in PD over time in the 2 groups). Data shown are means ± SE. Statistical hypotheses were evaluated at the $5 \%$ level.

**RESULTS**

ACE stimulates a reversible increase in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and PD in T84 cell monolayers. The addition of ACE to the apical (Fig. 1, A and B) or apical plus basolateral bathing solution of T84 cell monolayers caused increases in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and PD as measured in modified Ussing chambers. Basolateral addition alone of ACE had no effect (Fig. 1A, peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$, basolateral addition vs. negative control, $P=0.3$). Maximal response was reached by $20 \mathrm{~min}$ after the addition of ACE, and the effect persisted for at least $2 \mathrm{~h}$. The peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and PD values for supernatants of an $\mathrm{ACE}^{+} \mathrm{V}$. cholerae strain compared with an $\mathrm{ACE}^{-} \mathrm{V}$. cholerae strain (negative control) were $11.8 \pm 2.4 \mu \mathrm{Amp} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ vs. $0.8 \pm 1.1 \mu \mathrm{Amp} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}\left(I_{\mathrm{sc}}, P=0.006\right.$, Fig. 1A) and $-18.5 \pm 2.2 \mathrm{mV}$ vs. $0.6 \pm 0.2 \mathrm{mV}$ (PD, $P<0.001$, Fig. 1B). The increase in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and PD of an $\mathrm{ACE}^{+} \mathrm{V}$. cholerae strain compared with an $\mathrm{ACE}^{-} \mathrm{V}$. cholerae strain was significant throughout a $2-\mathrm{h}$ time course. Twenty minutes after the addition of apical ACE (but not basolateral), resistance of monolayers dropped $\sim 20 \%$ ($P=0.08$) and then returned to baseline by $60 \mathrm{~min}$ (Fig. 1C). Subsequent studies of ACE were performed with apical addition alone.

To determine whether the increase in the monolayer's electrical parameters was reversible, the bathing media was replaced at different time points with ACE-free media after ACE stimulated increases in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and PD. The increase in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and PD induced by ACE was immediately reversible whether removed after 4 (Fig. 2), 60, or $120 \mathrm{~min}$ (data not shown).

Purified ACE protein stimulates concentration-dependent increases in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and PD as seen with partially purified $\mathrm{ACE}^{+}$ culture supernatants. The ACE protein was purified from a wild-type V. cholerae strain E7946. As we previously reported (31), the predominant form of the ACE toxin produced in V. cholerae had a molecular weight of $18,000$ representing an ACE dimer. A second protein of molecular weight $9,000$ consistent with a monomer form of ACE was also present. When these proteins were analyzed on T84 cells, the monomer form of ACE produced a concentration-dependent increase in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ compared with the negative control (Fig. 3B). The threshold concentration of purified ACE that induced a significant increase in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ was $\sim 10^{-8} \mathrm{M}(36 \mathrm{nM} ; P=0.008)$ with a maximal effect at $\sim 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}(900 \mathrm{nM}$; Fig. 3B). Because of limitations in the availability of purified ACE (31), we were unable to stimulate the monolayers with a high enough concentration of ACE to clearly saturate the $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ response and thus were unable to calculate the half-maximal stimulatory concentration. The time-to-peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ was concentration dependent, because increasing the concentration of toxin shifted the peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ to an earlier time (Fig. 3C). The time-dependent PD, $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$, and resistance responses to purified ACE were similar to those observed with the partially purified culture supernatant (see Fig. 1, data not shown). The dimer form of ACE demonstrated less

**ACE-stimulated secretion is equally dependent on $Cl^{-}$ or $HCO_3^{-}$ ions.** It has previously been shown that the loop diuretic, bumetanide, inhibits the basolaterally localized $Na^{+}-K^{+}-2Cl^{-}$ cotransport system in the T84 cell line (4). This transport pathway serves as the principal $Cl^{-}$-uptake pathway, and its inhibition by bumetanide results in a reversal or inhibition of $Cl^{-}$ secretion mediated by cyclic nucleotides or $Ca^{2+}$. Therefore, bumetanide was used to test the involvement of this cotransport pathway in the $Cl^{-}$ secretory process activated by ACE. As is the case for prostaglandin E$_1$- (37) and ST$_a$-induced (15) $Cl^{-}$ secretion, pretreatment (30 min) of T84 cell monolayers with bumetanide ($10^{-4}$ M) substantially ($\sim 60\%$) inhibited the action of ACE (Fig. 4). Bumetanide, by itself, had no effect on $I_{sc}$ or PD. Bumetanide also reversed the action of ACE when added after ACE had elicited a response (Fig. 4). Similarly, ouabain (250 $\mu$M), which inhibits the $Na^{+}-K^{+}$-ATPase necessary for active trans-epithelial $Cl^{-}$ secretion, inhibited and reversed ACE-induced $I_{sc}$ when added to the basolateral reservoir (data not shown).

replaced by Ca²⁺-free Ringer (Fig. 6A, $P = 0.04$). The resistance of the monolayers was unchanged compared with the resistance of parallel controls in normal Ringer solution. Furthermore, pretreatment of T84 monolayers with the Ca²⁺ channel blocker nifedipine inhibited the ACE-induced $I_{sc}$ response (Fig. 6B, $P =$

The inhibition of Cl⁻ secretion by bumetanide, described above, suggests that Na⁺, Cl⁻, and possibly K⁺ are required for the Cl⁻-uptake step in ACE's action and that this process is localized to the basolateral membrane of the T84 cells. To verify the involvement of Cl⁻ and/or HCO₃⁻ in the ACE-stimulated increase in $I_{sc}$/PD, ion replacement studies were performed. Of note, the peak of ACE activity was ~60–80% inhibited when the Ringer solution was replaced by Cl⁻-free Ringer (Fig. 5, $P = 0.03$) or when replaced by HCO₃⁻-free Ringer (Fig. 5). When both ions were removed from the Ringer solution, there was complete inhibition of ACE-induced current (Fig. 5, $P = 0.005$).

**The effect of ACE on second messengers.** To explore further the mechanism of action of ACE, we measured the effect of the enterotoxin on cellular cAMP and cGMP. ACE and carbachol had no significant effect on cellular cGMP or cAMP, whereas STa increased cGMP but had no effect on cAMP and forskolin, and V. cholerae CT increased cAMP but had no effect on cGMP (Table 1).

To examine the role of Ca²⁺ as a second messenger, ion replacement studies were performed with Ringer solution replaced by Ca²⁺-free Ringer in the apical reservoir 30 min before the addition of the ACE toxin. ACE was added at a near maximal concentration (90–900 nM). The basolateral reservoir retained normal Ringer solution, which is required to maintain tight junction integrity (33). The peak action of ACE was ~65% inhibited when the apical Ringer solution was

0.001). In contrast, pretreatment with the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel blockers $\omega$-conotoxin and verapamil had no significant effect on the ACE-induced $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ response (Fig. 6B). Together these results suggest that the apical influx of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is required for the ACE effect on $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$.

To further confirm that the ACE effect is mediated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, we employed the intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelator BAPTA. When T84 cell monolayers were preloaded with $50 \mu \mathrm{M}$ BAPTA, there was a near ablation of ACE-induced $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ (Fig. 6C, $P < 0.001$). In addition, pretreatment of T84 monolayers with dantrolene, an intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ antagonist, inhibited the ACE-induced $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ response (Fig. 6D, $P = 0.002$). However, when monolayers were pretreated with thapsigargin ($300 \mathrm{nM}$), a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone that induces a rapid increase in the concentration of cytosolic-free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by direct discharge of intracellular stores (30), there was a potentiation of ACE-induced $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ (thapsigargin alone, mean peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}} = 10.2 \pm 4.3$; ACE alone, mean peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}} = 14.0 \pm 3.5$; thapsigargin followed by ACE, mean peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}} = 81.6 \pm 7.1$; predicted additive effect, mean peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}} = 24.6 \pm 3.0 ; P < 0.001$, Fig. 6E). Together these results suggest that ACE's activity is dependent on both intra- and extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and that ACE and thapsigargin act via different intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pools.

To further examine the signaling pathways involved in the ACE-induced $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$, we utilized the broad spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases, staurosporine ($100 \mathrm{nM}$), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein ($100 \mu \mathrm{M}$). Staurosporine inhibited $45 \%$ of peak ACE-induced $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ (Fig. 7A), whereas genistein had no effect on ACE-induced $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion (Fig. 7B).

The $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ secretory responses of T84 monolayers to ACE plus agonists acting via $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (carbachol) or cyclic nucleotides ($\mathrm{ST}_{\alpha}$, forskolin). For these experiments, agonists were added at a concentration that stimulated a maximal $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ response when added individually ($10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$ carbachol, $4.4 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{ST}_{\alpha}, 1 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{M}$ forskolin). ACE was utilized at a near-maximal concentration of $5 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$. As previously reported (5), the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ secretory response to carbachol (added to the basolateral membrane) was rapid and transient, with a peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ of $9.8 \pm 1.1 \mu \mathrm{Amp} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ at $4 \mathrm{~min}$ and a return nearly to baseline by $10 \mathrm{~min}$ (Fig. 8A). In contrast, ACE alone stimulates a rapid but persistent increase in $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ with a peak of $10.5 \pm 0.9 \mu \mathrm{Amp} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ at $4 \mathrm{~min}$ (Fig. 8A). Simultaneous addition of ACE and carbachol (Fig. 8A) or serial addition of ACE then carbachol (data not shown) resulted in a synergistic response that was apparent by $4 \mathrm{~min}$, with a peak $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ of $71.0 \pm 6.0 \mu \mathrm{Amp} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ and that persisted for at least $30 \mathrm{~min}$ (predicted additive effect, $20.0 \pm 1.3 \mu \mathrm{Amp} / \mathrm{cm}^{2} ; P < 0.001$). However, if carbachol is added before ACE, i.e., T84 monolayers are pretreated with carbachol ($10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$, basolateral membrane) $10 \mathrm{~min}$ before the addition of ACE, the ACE-induced $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ secretion is not augmented (Fig. 8B) nor blocked. Of note, pretreatment of T84 monolayers with carbachol $10 \mathrm{~min}$ before the addition of thapsigargin blocked thapsigargin-induced $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ secretion as previously reported (Fig. 8B) (17). This, combined with the data presented in Fig. 6, again

Of note, removal of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ or $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ individually reduced ACE-stimulated $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ in a nearly equivalent manner ($P = 0.03$), whereas ACE-stimulated $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ was abrogated by removal of both anions ($P = 0.005 ; n = 5$).

MECHANISM OF ACTION OF VIBRIO CHOLERAE ACE IN T84 CELLS

strated the reported synergy of Ca²⁺- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent agonists (21, 22, 36) (STₐ followed by carbachol, mean peak \( I_{\text{sc}} = 45.0 \, \mu \text{Amps/cm}^2 \) vs. predicted additive effect, mean peak \( I_{\text{sc}} = 14.5 \pm 0.5 \), \( P < 0.001 \), \( n = 2 \); forskolin followed by carbachol, mean peak \( I_{\text{sc}} = 69.3 \pm 2.4 \, \mu \text{Amps/cm}^2 \) vs. predicted additive effect, mean peak \( I_{\text{sc}} = 49.0 \pm 2.9 \), \( P = 0.005 \), \( n = 3 \)).

ACE-stimulated Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ secretion is partially dependent on a DIDS-sensitive apical Cl⁻ channel. The apical membrane of polarized T84 cells contains two distinct Cl⁻ channels, differentiated by their sensitivity to DIDS and anion selectivity (24). The DIDS-

suggests that the mechanism of ACE- and thapsigargin-induced \( I_{\text{sc}} \) is through activation of different Ca²⁺ pools.

In contrast, the Cl⁻ secretory responses of T84 monolayers to E. coli STₐ, or forskolin, cGMP, and cAMP agonists, respectively, are not enhanced by ACE. Simultaneous addition of ACE and STₐ or ACE and forskolin produced an additive response with a peak \( I_{\text{sc}} \) of \( 32 \pm 3.8 \, \mu \text{Amp/cm}^2 \), predicted additive effect, \( 20.0 \pm 5.5 \, \mu \text{Amp/cm}^2 \) (ACE + STₐ, actual vs. predicted, \( P = 0.14 \), \( n = 3 \)) and a peak \( I_{\text{sc}} \) of \( 38.9 \pm 5.7 \, \mu \text{Amp/cm}^2 \), predicted additive effect, \( 54.3 \pm 6.8 \, \mu \text{Amp/cm}^2 \) (ACE + forskolin, actual vs. predicted, \( P = 0.15 \), \( n = 3 \)). This lack of synergy between a Ca²⁺ agonist (ACE) and cyclic nucleotide agonist (STₐ or forskolin) was unexpected, because Ca²⁺- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent agonists normally show synergy. We performed control experiments examining the secretory responses of T84 monolayers to serial addition of E. coli STₐ followed by carbachol and response of monolayers to forskolin followed by carbachol. As expected, these agonists demon-

Pretreatment with carbachol had no effect on ACE-induced \( I_{\text{sc}} \), whereas pretreatment with carbachol inhibited the \( I_{\text{sc}} \) response to thapsigargin (\( P < 0.08 \), \( n = 3 \)) as previously reported (17).

insensitive channel that is activated by cAMP agonists presumably represents cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Both cAMP and Ca²⁺ agonists activate the DIDS-sensitive Cl⁻ channel. To determine which of the two channels is activated by ACE, we treated T84 monolayers with 500 μM DIDS on the apical membrane. DIDS-treated monolayers showed a 50% inhibition of the ACE-induced \(I_{sc}\) response (Fig. 9). This is in contrast to 100% inhibition of thapsigargin-induced \(I_{sc}\) response and 40% inhibition of forskolin-induced \(I_{sc}\) response by DIDS reported previously (24).

**ACE-stimulated secretion is inhibited by clotrimazole.** To ascertain the involvement of the basolateral membrane in ACE-stimulated secretion, we evaluated the effects of clotrimazole on ACE-mediated Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ secretion. In previously reported studies, clotrimazole was identified as an inhibitor of both basolateral membrane K⁺ channels, \(K_{Ca}\) and \(K_{cAMP}\) (1). Clotrimazole-treated monolayers showed a 92% reduction in ACE-stimulated \(I_{sc}\) compared with control monolayers (Fig. 10). This is similar to the 91–94% inhibition of cyclic nucleotide agonist-dependent Cl⁻ secretion by clotrimazole (26) and the 84% inhibition of carbachol-dependent secretion (25). These results indicate that ACE, like other cyclic nucleotide and Ca²⁺-mediated agonists, depends on basolateral K⁺ efflux pathways.

**DISCUSSION**

This report indicates that the V. cholerae enterotoxin ACE is a Ca²⁺-dependent agonist that acts at the apical membrane of polarized intestinal epithelial cells (T84 model) to stimulate anion secretion, consistent with prior reports of its secretory activity in animal models (32). The mechanism by which ACE stimulates \(I_{sc}\) and PD in T84 monolayers appears to involve both an influx of extracellular Ca²⁺ across the apical membrane of the cells as well as intracellular Ca²⁺ stores. Selective inhibition with the Ca²⁺ channel blocker nifedipine, but not the Ca²⁺ channel blocker ω-conotoxin

Clotrimazole inhibition experiments were performed with monolayers in Ringer buffer. Clotrimazole inhibited ACE-stimulated \(I_{sc}\) by 92% (\(P < 0.001\), \(n = 4\)). (Fig. 6B), suggests that an L-type voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channel is involved in the ACE response rather than an N-type Ca²⁺ channel (inhibited by ω-conotoxin). Of note, although thapsigargin potentiated the response of T84 cells to ACE, dantrolene and BAPTA-AM inhibited the activity of ACE. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the action of ACE on T84 cells is dependent on extracellular and select (but as yet undefined) intracellular Ca²⁺ stores.

Our observations that ACE acts synergistically with the Ca²⁺-dependent agonist carbachol, but not with cyclic nucleotide-dependent agonists in T84 cells, is novel. Ca²⁺-Ca²⁺-dependent synergy has not been previously described and lends support to the concept that regional, but interactive, pools of Ca²⁺ may be stimulated by agonists. Conversely, prior reports have routinely identified short-lived synergy of Ca²⁺- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent agonists in T84 monolayers, whereas in the current report, no such synergy was identified between ACE and cyclic nucleotide agonists. The mechanism of synergy between Ca²⁺-dependent and cyclic nucleotide-dependent agonists has been postulated as due to a complementary increase in the driving force for Cl⁻ secretion due to the action of Ca²⁺ on basolateral membrane K⁺ channels, combined with increased apical membrane Cl⁻ conductance due to the phosphorylation of CFTR by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. The lack of synergy observed in response to ACE and cyclic nucleotide-dependent agonists suggested to us initially that ACE, unlike carbachol, may not modify K⁺ efflux across the basolateral membrane of T84 monolayers. However, our experiments using the inhibitor clotrimazole (Fig. 10) suggest that ACE-induced secretion is dependent on K⁺ efflux across the basolateral membrane of T84 cells. Thus we hypothesize that apical influx of Ca²⁺ stimulated by ACE may trigger mechanisms altering the transport properties of apical anion channels (also supported by our experiments using DIDS, Fig. 9) and that synergy with carbachol may result in part from a synergistic or additive effect of ACE and carbachol on the same or distinct basolateral K⁺ channels, respectively. Testing

MECHANISM OF ACTION OF VIBRIO CHOLERAE ACE IN T84 CELLS

this hypothesis will require both direct measurements of intracellular Ca²⁺ and specific transport/ion efflux studies after treatment of T84 cells with ACE.

The calcium dependence of ACE's activity is notable, as few enteric toxins to date have been clearly defined to act in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner. The best-studied examples are the second heat-stable enterotoxin of E. coli (STb) that act via a G protein-linked Ca²⁺ channel to stimulate influx of Ca²⁺ from extracellular stores (6) and the thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that also stimulates influx of extracellular Ca²⁺ (7). Similar to ACE, both of these toxins act at the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. However, unlike ACE, which stimulates a prolonged increase in Isc/PD, STb and TDH stimulate considerably briefer increases in Isc/PD in animal tissues (15–40 min). In contrast, Ca²⁺-dependent neurohumoral agonists (e.g., carbachol, histamine, and serotonin) act at the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells and stimulate only very brief increases in Isc and PD. The rapid termination of the Isc response to these agonists is attributed to the production of the negative regulator, D-myo-inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (IP₄), influx of extracellular Ca²⁺, activation of protein kinase C, and/or a tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathway (18). Our data suggest that ACE may modify the cellular production of IP₄ or prevent activation of one of the other known inhibitory pathways to produce the protracted Isc/PD response to ACE that we observed (Fig. 1). Inhibition by ACE of IP₄ production (or another inhibitory pathway) stimulated by carbachol would also be predicted to contribute to the synergistic response of ACE and carbachol (Fig. 8A). Our data that demonstrate that the synergistic response to ACE is ablated when carbachol is added 10 min before ACE (Fig. 8B) further suggest that ACE is insensitive to the inhibitory action of IP₄. This is in contrast to thapsigargin, which shows a marked inhibition of the Isc/PD response after carbachol pretreatment (Fig. 8B and Ref. 17). Finally, our finding that a protein kinase inhibitor (staurosporine) blocks ACE-induced Isc, whereas a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein) has no effect, suggests that activation of protein kinase C or Ca²⁺-calmodulin-dependent kinases may be essential to ACE's activity. The observed diversity in the site of activity of Ca²⁺-dependent agonists (2), the apparent Ca²⁺ stores involved, and the magnitude and time course of the identified physiological responses suggest that further studies to better delineate the mechanisms and localization of Ca²⁺ responses in intestinal epithelial cells are warranted.

Our data suggest that ACE alters both Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ transport (Fig. 5, ion replacement studies) in T84 monolayers via apical channel(s). Based on the DIDS-inhibition studies, ACE appears to stimulate anion secretion by activating a DIDS-sensitive, Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channel (Fig. 9). In addition, ACE may also activate a DIDS-insensitive Cl⁻ channel, most likely the CFTR. The ACE-stimulated Isc also relies on the Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase, Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ cotransporter, and K⁺ channels (clotrimazole inhibition experiments) on the basolateral cell membrane presumably to generate the Cl⁻ gradient, which drives secretion when the apical channels are activated. Intriguingly, removal of either Cl⁻ or HCO₃⁻ caused nearly equivalent decreases in the Isc/PD induced by ACE. Transport of HCO₃⁻ by T84 cells has not been well defined. A recent review of data published as part of the initial characterization of the transport properties of T84 cells revealed that the measured Isc was 20% that predicted from the net secretion of Cl⁻, suggesting that under basal conditions, T84 cells actively transport HCO₃⁻ (4, 13). This same report suggested that infection of T84 monolayers by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) decreased net transport by T84 monolayers by perturbing HCO₃⁻-dependent transport pathways (13). In addition, transepithelial HCO₃⁻ transport is reported to be insensitive to bumetanide, and bumetanide substantially, but incompletely, inhibited the ACE-induced increase in Isc (Fig. 4) similar to prior results with, for example, genistein (27) and E. coli STa (15). Together our results and recently reported data suggest that ACE most likely modifies both Cl⁻- and HCO₃⁻-dependent transport mechanisms in T84 monolayers. Possible mechanisms that account for these observations are that treatment of T84 monolayers with ACE modifies the anion selectivity of CFTR [enabling it to conduct HCO₃⁻ consistent with recent reports in the duodenal epithelium (12, 14, 16, 29)] and/or the activity of an apical membrane Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger (or its linkage to the activity of CFTR via, for example, recycling of Cl⁻ through the apical membrane). Further studies of ACE will help define both the transport changes stimulated by ACE and may assist in evaluating the mechanisms by which T84 cells transport Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻. Our observations, combined with the recent observations regarding the effect of EPEC on ion transport in T84 monolayers (13), strongly suggest that future studies of stimulated secretion in T84 cells consider the role of HCO₃⁻ in the observed responses.

The ACE toxin is encoded in the V. cholerae chromosomal core region, which encodes the filamentous bacteriophage, CTXΦ (35). Two of the open-reading frames in this region, orfU and zot, are required for production of phage particles (35). The role of ACE in the bacteriophage has not been determined experimentally. We had previously shown that the ACE toxin, cloned as a separate open-reading frame (that is, without any of the other open-reading frames required for phage production), had the activity of a classic enterotoxin in an in vivo model (rabbit ileal loops) and in an in vitro model (rabbit Ussing chambers) (32). Additionally, we were able to express the ACE gene in yeast, and the ACE toxin produced had activity in the rabbit Ussing chamber (31) and on monolayers of T84 cells (unpublished results). Furthermore, as shown in this paper, ACE can be purified from the culture supernatants of wild-type V. cholerae, indicating that wild-type V. cholerae secretes biologically active ACE. Thus together, these data and the experimental results contained in this manuscript indicate that ACE, like CT, is secreted by V. cholerae independent of phage production and

has physiological activity. Its role in the pathogenesis of cholera has not been determined with the use of isogenic mutants in human volunteers. However, the rapidity and potency by which ACE increases \( I_{sc} \) in T84 monolayers suggests that ACE may contribute to an early phase of intestinal secretion in V. cholerae infection before the onset of the secretion stimulated by the more slowly acting cholera toxin.

These studies identify T84 cells as an excellent model for further studies to delineate the cellular mechanism of action of ACE. The novel physiology seen secondary to the ACE toxin makes this bacterial toxin useful for understanding Ca²⁺-dependent signal transduction in epithelial cells and may help clarify mechanisms of Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ secretion. The suggestion that the ACE toxin may act through the second messenger, Ca²⁺, and appears to synergize with carbachol that also acts through the second messenger Ca²⁺ makes this toxin a unique example of a secretagogue exhibiting Ca²⁺-Ca²⁺ synergy.
