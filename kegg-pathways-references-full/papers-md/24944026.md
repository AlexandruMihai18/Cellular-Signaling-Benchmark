**Nicole Gallo-Payet${}^{*1}$ and Marie-Claude Battista${}^{1}$**

## ABSTRACT

The purpose of this article is to review fundamentals in adrenal gland histophysiology. Key findings regarding the important signaling pathways involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis and adrenal growth are summarized. We illustrate how adrenal gland morphology and function are deeply interconnected in which novel signaling pathways (Wnt, Sonic hedgehog, Notch, β-catenin) or ionic channels are required for their integrity. Emphasis is given to exploring the mechanisms and challenges underlying the regulation of proliferation, growth, and functionality. Also addressed is the fact that while it is now well-accepted that steroidogenesis results from an enzymatic shuttle between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, key questions still remain on the various aspects related to cellular uptake and delivery of free cholesterol. The significant progress achieved over the past decade regarding the precise molecular mechanisms by which the two main regulators of adrenal cortex, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and angiotensin II act on their receptors is reviewed, including structure-activity relationships and their potential applications. Particular attention has been given to crucial second messengers and how various kinases, phosphatases, and cytoskeleton-associated proteins interact to ensure homeostasis and/or meet physiological demands. References to animal studies are also made in an attempt to unravel associated clinical conditions. Many of the aspects addressed in this article still represent a challenge for future studies, their outcome aimed at providing evidence that the adrenal gland, through its steroid hormones, occupies a central position in many situations where homeostasis is disrupted, thus highlighting the relevance of exploring and understanding how this key organ is regulated. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

## Introduction

The adult adrenal cortex is composed of three concentric layers, each having specific functional and morphological properties. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is the main stimulus of the zona fasciculata, stimulating cortisol/corticosterone secretion, while angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main stimulus of aldosterone by the zona glomerulosa. The two hormones not only act on the immediate stimulation of adrenal steroid synthesis and release, but also increase the expression of a number of genes including those involved in steroidogenesis. This review summarizes the key findings of numerous laboratories that have explored the main signaling pathways and their interactions, which are much more complex than simply cAMP- or phospholipase C-activation. Certain selective pathways that are activated during adrenal gland development or under pathological situations will also be considered. The writing of this overview article has been facilitated by several reviews in the field, which are referenced at the beginning of each section. All abbreviations used in the text can be found in Tables 1 to 3.

## Structure and Functions of the Adrenal Cortex

The adrenal cortex synthesizes and secretes steroids, while the medulla produces catecholamines and several neuropeptides. The zona glomerulosa is specialized in the production of aldosterone whereas the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis synthesize glucocorticoids (corticosterone in rodents and cortisol in humans, bovine, and hamster). In humans and higher primates, the zona reticularis, and to a lesser extent the zona fasciculata, produce C19 androgens, including large quantities of the precursors DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone).

Figure 1 Steroids produced by the adrenal cortex and their respective actions. Free cholesterol is enrolled in three distinct pathways, according to specific enzyme processing: aldosterone in zona glomerulosa; corticosterone (rodents) and cortisol (humans, bovine, ovine, and hamsters) in zonae fasciculata and reticularis; and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione in zona reticularis (mainly in humans, and to a lesser extent in bovine, porcine, and ovine) (153). At the level of the inner mitochondrial membrane, cholesterol is cleaved by the P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) into pregnenolone. Further steps include the enzymes 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3β-HSD2), 17α-hydroxylase, 17, 20-lyase (P450c17), 21β-hydroxylase (P450c21), 11β-hydroxylase (P450c11β), and aldosterone synthase (P450aldo). Steps indicated in blue occur in mitochondria and steps indicated in green in the endoplasmic reticulum. The figure illustrates the physiological role of the three classes of steroids (black boxes) and the pathological consequences associated with an elevated and sustained level of secretion (red arrows and boxes).

and DHEA-sulfate (DHEAS) (153, 600) (Fig. 1). The overall production of aldosterone is in the order of picomolars, comparatively to the nanomolar range for cortisol/corticosterone and micromolar range for androgens (26, 619). Plasma cortisol levels are submitted to a circadian and pulsatile secretion rate which is under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and by an intra-adrenal cortical clock [for further details, see section related to “Circadian rhythm of glucocorticoid secretion”; for review, see (538)]. As summarized in Figure 1, aldosterone stimulates sodium reabsorption thus sustaining blood volume and pressure in the event of salt deprivation or extracellular excretion of potassium as well as protecting extracellular fluid from excess sodium levels. Excessive aldosterone secretion not only leads to hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, but is also associated with cardiometabolic complications (leading to hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction

in the heart, kidneys, and vessels) (154, 251, 485). This aspect will be covered in another article of this series (Steve Magill). Glucocorticoids play an essential role in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis, initiating a broad range of actions on various organs (118, 163). For example, acute glucocorticoid secretion during stress mobilizes peripheral amino acids from muscle as well as nonesterified fatty acid and glycerol from peripheral fat stores in order to provide a sufficient amount of substrates for glucose synthesis by the liver. However, chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels alter body fat distribution and increase visceral adiposity as well as metabolic abnormalities in a manner reminiscent of the metabolic syndrome (73, 180, 619). In humans, the adrenal cortex produces large amounts of DHEA and DHEAS, which are converted to testosterone in peripheral target tissues (397). In women, adrenal gland contribution to androgen production is even
more significant. Indeed, adrenal glands produce about 40% of circulating testosterone in women of reproductive age while adrenal glands are virtually the exclusive source of circulating testosterone in postmenopausal women (170). This aspect will be covered in two other articles in this series (Mary Dallman and, James Herman and by Stafford Lightman).

### Adult zonation—histological evidence

Adrenal glands are sheltered by both white and brown fat tissue and are surrounded by a tight connective tissue called “capsule,” which provides an internal supporting framework (134). All of these morphological and histological distinctions have been well described by Nussdorfer and Mazzochi (532) and Gavin Vinson (725). The three main adult adrenocortical zones each display distinct characteristics mostly driven by a unique morphological cellular arrangement. Under the capsule, the zona glomerulosa forms a thin layer of small cells containing small lipid droplets. They are organized as loops of cells surrounding the capillaries. The zona fasciculata, the thicker layer of the adrenal cortex, is comprised of large cells, containing large lipid droplets. These cells are organized as radial columns running centripetally. The zona fasciculata is often further distinguished into the outer zona fasciculata and inner zona fasciculata, the latter progressing into a less organized area, namely the zona reticularis. An additional zone is found at the junction between the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata, which is characterized by the lack of steroidogenic enzymes (498). From its first description in 1937, this sudanophobe zone has been successively named “demarcation zone,” “transitional zone,” or “compression zone” until its final designation “intermediate zone” or zona intermedia in 1952 by Lennart Nicander (110).

There is also considerable variation in the histological and morphological presentation of the adrenal cortex according to species, notably in mice. This may have significant importance considering that the mouse is widely used as a model of choice for developing transgenic studies. For example, while CBL57/BL mice present a classical histology (Fig. 2A), some strains exhibit an X zone of variable size (Fig. 2B and C) (190). Growth of this zone has been shown to be affected by androgens, since testosterone treatment in female mice results in X-zone regression while gonadectomy in male mice results in X-zone regrowth (319). One additional zone, called

(A) C57BL/6J, (B) 129S1/Sv1mJ, (C) CBA/J, (D) BALB/cByJ, (E) A/J, and (F) AKR/J female mice. In all strains, the zona glomerulosa (ZG) is characterized by 3 to 5 layers of small cells, the zona fasciculata (ZF) by cells arranged as centripetal columns separated by sinusoids. On the other hand, the zona reticularis (ZR), localized between the inner zona fasciculata (IZF) and medulla is characterized by smaller cells with irregular dispositions. The X Zone (XZ), consisting of small clumps of loosely distributed cells, is clearly observed in both the 129S1/SvlmJ strain (B) and CBA/J strain (C) and is absent in the A/J (E) and AKR/J strains (F). In female BALB/cByJ (D), A/J (E), and AKR/J (F) mice, the cortex is clearly separated from the medulla (M) by a large lipoid zone (LS). This zone represents up to 50% of the adrenal volume in the A/J strain (E). Scale bar = 100 µm. Adapted, with permission, from Figures 5 and 7 (190).“lipoid zone,” is only observed in females from certain strains (BALB/cByJ, A/J and AKR/J, all from the Castle lineage) (Fig. 2D-F) (190). Interestingly, it has been reported that male AKR/J mice are the most sensitive to the development of dietary obesity (744, 759). Moreover, because female AKR/J mice have higher values with regard to both body weight and systolic blood pressure than their male counterparts, it is possible that female AKR/J mice could constitute an interesting unrecognized animal model of metabolic syndrome or cardiometabolic complications (190). At birth, adrenal gland weights are indistinguishable between male and female mice. However, within the first weeks postnatally, a marked gender-dependent adrenal phenotype is established and adrenal gland weights in female mice are approximately twofold higher at 11 weeks when compared to male littermates (67).

The adrenal gland is highly vascularized such that every cell is adjacent to a blood vessel. The adrenal gland receives its arterial supply through a number of small arteries which are dispersed in a network of arterioles lying both within and immediately below the capsule. This arteriolar plexus gives rise to a series of thin-walled vessels, called sinusoids, which run through the cortex to the medulla. Of particular note, in addition to being directly supplied by the medullary arteries, the adrenal medulla also receives blood from the cortex, thus benefiting from a steroid-rich blood supply (723). The adrenal gland and adrenal cortex are also innervated by pre- and postganglionic sympathetic fibers, sensory fibers and vagal fibers, as well as by intrinsic ganglion neurons (211, 333, 726).

### Establishment of adrenocortical zonation

Key contributions and reviews regarding the process of organogenesis and regulation have been made by several laboratories. Readers are invited to consult the excellent reviews in this field (119, 376, 411, 750). Enucleation experiments were the first strategy used to study the mechanism involved in the functional zonation of the adrenal cortex. These studies, conducted by Greep and Deane (287), proposed that when rats are subjected to bilateral adrenal enucleation surgery, cells of the residual capsule regenerate within a month and form a glomerulosa-like outer zone and a fasciculata/reticularis-like inner zone (287). This suggests that cells attached to the adrenal capsule, consisting mainly of zona glomerulosa cells, have the potential to act as stem cells of cortical differentiation, able to regenerate the three zones.

It is well-known that the nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 ($Nr5a1$, SF-1) is essential for adrenal gland development and functionality. Indeed, in Sf1-deficient mice, adrenocortical development is aborted at the earliest stages of adrenogonadal specification and mice die at birth due to adrenal insufficiency (448). Even in conditions of SF-1 heterozygosity (+/-), mice exhibit adrenal insufficiency resulting from profound defects in adrenal gland development and organization (74). Conversely, an increased SF-1 dosage by itself can augment human adrenocortical cell proliferation,

and is frequently observed in childhood adrenocortical tumors (199). In mice, increased $Sf-I$ dosage produces adrenocortical hyperplasia and formation of tumors, which originate from the subcapsular region of the adrenal cortex, thus indicating a critical role for SF-1 in adrenocortical tumorigenesis (199, 680).

On the other hand, in humans, mutations of the dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X-chromosome, gene 1 (DAX-1) cause the X-linked form of adrenal hypoplasia congenita (762). To better understand the role of DAX1 in organogenesis, our laboratory has studied steroidogenesis during the second trimester of human gestation. We found that DAX-1 is localized in the nucleus of definitive differentiated cells while exhibiting a nucleocytoplasmic localization in fetal cells. ACTH stimulation clearly favors nuclear labeling in both cell types (48). This nuclear localization of DAX-1 in definitive cells is compatible with its role in the negative modulation of steroidogenesis in the adult [for review, see (239, 402, 404)] and with the observation that, in the absence of $Dax-I$, there is an increase in adrenal responsiveness to ACTH (34). In contrast, localization of DAX-1 in the cytoplasm of fetal cells may allow for the high expression of P450c17 and secretion of DHEA/DHEAS in these cells. Such cytoplasmic localization in situ along with observations made in cell lines (403) support the notion that DAX-1, in addition to negative modulation of steroidogenesis in the adult, plays a significant role in organogenesis, since in the X-linked form of adrenal hypoplasia congenita, the adrenal gland is characterized by the absence of the permanent zone and the presence of large vacuolated cells, similar to fetal adrenal cells (513).

In recent years, several groups have explored the importance of certain pathways (such as Wnt, Sonic hedgehog, Notch) in adrenal cortex development and homeostasis. These signaling pathways participate in normal development while their defects are associated with developmental abnormalities and adrenocortical tumorigenesis (213, 680). For example, Wnt family members and the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin act in synergy with $Sfl$ to regulate a subset of target genes. Selective inactivation of β-catenin has important consequences on adrenal gland development and organization, as shown by the reduction in proliferation in the fetal adrenal gland and overall reduced size and histological disorganization in the adult adrenal gland (Fig. 3A) (378). Furthermore, in these $Sfl/β$-catenin-KO mice, the expression of a panel of steroidogenic genes is decreased compared with wild-type mice (378). Conditional inactivation of Shh in the mouse adrenal cortex results in severe hypoplasia and disorganization of the cortex (136, 352) [for review, see (411)]. At birth, the adrenal glands appear normal; however, in adult mice, the cortex fails to encapsulate the adrenal medulla, resulting in the eccentric position of the medulla (Fig. 3B) (352). In addition, in Wnt-4-deficient mice, the expression of both Cyp11B2 (P450aldo) and preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1) is lowered, resulting in a significant reduction in aldosterone production in newborn mutants, thus suggesting that Wnt-4 may be necessary for proper formation of the zona

glomerulosa (316). Pref-1 appears to be important in maintaining the undifferentiated status and proliferative capacity of adrenocortical cells, as initially found for preadipocytes (299). Detailed immunohistochemical examination of Pref-1 expression has revealed that, in addition to zona intermedia, whose cells contain neither Pref-1 protein, P450aldo nor P450c11β (498), the zona glomerulosa is divided into two layers: the first comprised of a few-cells-thick layer present underneath the capsule (expressing both Pref-1 protein and cytochrome P450aldo), and the second layer located beneath the former (containing Pref-1 protein but not aldosterone synthase) (299). One of the most recent models to explain the origin and control of adrenocortical zonation proposes that in the presence of a mitogenic signal or through extrinsic cues, the stem cells in the mesenchymal capsule proliferate, resulting in the production of progenitor cells in the subcapsular region. These subcapsular cells gain Sf1 expression, but are limited in steroidogenic activity due to the SF1-dependent expression of DAX-1. These cells continually proliferate in order to maintain adrenocortical homeostasis. The model proposes that, in response to ACTH, Dax1 is repressed, upon which cells move centripetally from the subcapsular area and begin to exhibit steroidogenic activity and function as differentiated adrenocortical cells (119, 376, 411) (Fig. 4). Moreover, a recent study clearly demonstrated that, in response to injury or hormonal feedback, differentiated cells from the zona glomerulosa may undergo lineage conversion into zona fasciculata cells (244). Furthermore, as pointed out by Kim et al. (376), the extracellular matrix, with its receptors and integrins, as well as the ontogenesis of various G proteins (90) must be taken into account in the process of organogenesis. In our laboratory, we have indeed shown that extracellular matrices favor interactions with hormones in order to orchestrate proliferation, cell death and secretion (113) [for review, see (750)].

### Correlation between histology and steroidogenesis—immunohistochemical evidences

The three zones of the adult rat adrenal cortex are not only morphologically and histology distinct, but are easily functionally distinguishable by the expression of steroidogenic enzymes. As clearly evident in Figure 5A, cells stained for P450 aldosterone synthase (P450aldo, responsible for aldosterone synthesis) are localized in the subcapsular zone (zona glomerulosa) while P450c11β-hydroxylase (P450c11β, responsible for corticosterone synthesis) staining is primarily observed in the zona fasciculata. These two zones are clearly separated by the zona intermedia (751), which is nonstained and acknowledged as being a nonsteroidogenic zone (See Table 1 for nomenclature of steroidogenic enzymes). As first investigated by Mitani et al. (498) and further illustrated in numerous publications, this latter zone does not contain aldosterone synthase (P450aldo) or cytochrome P450c11β. In addition, while stained nuclei are concentrated in and around this layer in BrdU-treated rats,

### Figure 4
Model of cellular organization and organogenesis of the adrenal cortex. Stem cells or primary progenitor cells putatively arise from the rare undifferentiated adrenocortical cells residing within the capsule (yellow). These cells express shh, but not Sf1 or Dax1, and may be considered as quiescent self-renewing cells. These primary progenitors subsequently become secondary progenitor cells (green). These cells, under the impulse of shh, express Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which are required for adrenal gland development and maintenance. These subcapsular cells are Sf1 positive and Dax1 positive, transiently amplifying nonsteroidogenic cells (putatively, zona intermedia). Finally, these cells ultimately become mature steroidogenic cells [Sf1 positive, Dax1 negative, as well as Cyp11β2 (P450aldo)-expressing glomerulosa cells (ZG) (dark blue) or Cyp11β1 (P450c11β)-expressing fasciculata cells (ZF) (turquoise)]. These cells have a decreased potential for proliferation. Reproduced and adapted, with permission, from Figure 2 (377).

thus indicating cell proliferation, pulse-chase experiments reveal that the labeled cells migrate out of this layer and into the zonae fasciculata-reticularis (498). Accordingly, this intermediate zone has been proposed to be a progenitor cell zone of the rat adrenal cortex. As illustrated in Figure 5B, cytochrome b5 and DHEA-sulfotransferase are only detected in the zona reticularis in the human adrenal gland (354, 600). These two factors are important regulators of cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17) activity. The latter, by promoting 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in the zona reticularis, is responsible for DHEA synthesis. In contrast, 3β-HSD2 is detected in the zonae glomerulosa and fasciculata, but not in the zona reticularis.

### Regulation of proliferation in adrenal cortex/zona glomerulosa

One of the unique properties of the adrenal gland is the ability to adapt its morphology according to physiological conditions. Indeed, in the intact adult adrenal gland, zone-specific proliferation may represent a homeostatic response to an impaired physiological condition. For example, in response to a low-sodium diet, proliferation is observed in the zona glomerulosa (484), while after unilateral adrenalectomy, com-

pensatory growth of the remaining gland occurs via proliferation that is restricted to the outer zona fasciculata (216, 217). Thus, depending on physiological conditions, the outer zona fasciculata and even the inner portions maintain the capacity to be engaged in a proliferating program.

---

#### Ang II and ACTH in growth-promoting activities—a long-lasting paradigm

Although many stimulatory agents have been described, Ang II and ACTH remain the most frequently acknowledged stimuli. For instance, a prolonged low-sodium diet increases the width of the zona glomerulosa, an effect mainly associated with Ang II action (5, 484). However, as shown by McEwan et al. (484), even if maximal cell proliferation is observed in the zona glomerulosa, the other regions also exhibit some degree of BrdU incorporation, hence displaying a certain proliferative capacity. Within the zona fasciculata, proliferation is more abundant in the outermost region at the interface with the zona intermedia than in the inner zona fasciculata (Fig. 6A).

While it is well established that ACTH treatment increases the volume, blood flow and steroidogenesis of the zona fasciculata (478), its role in promoting growth has been much more mitigated and the subject of active controversy. ACTH has often been considered as mitogenic since (i) in clinical and

Immunoreactivity of DHEA-ST is weak in the zona fasciculata and undetectable in the zona glomerulosa. Cytochrome b5 is similarly weak in the zonae fasciculata and glomerulosa. On the other hand, reactivity for 3β-HSD2 is strong in the zonae glomerulosa and fasciculata, but negative in the zona reticularis.

animal studies, circulating ACTH levels have been positively correlated with the size of the adrenal glands, (ii) chronic ACTH secretion induces bilateral hyperplasia of the glands, and (iii) it is well-documented that ACTH administration in hypophysectomized or dexamethasone-treated rats induces S-phase entry of cells from all zones of the adrenal cortex, and stimulates c-fos and c-jun expression in the Y1 adrenocortical tumor cell line (439). However, ACTH inhibits proliferation in both Y1 cell line and in primary cultures of adrenocortical cells (270, 342, 343, 467, 599, 605, 764) (Fig. 6B). The paradoxical effect of ACTH action on cell proliferation between in vivo and in vitro studies suggests that additional factors

are involved in vivo which ultimately overcome the growth inhibitory influence of ACTH (439, 621). In fact, a multitude of assorted factors are capable of influencing adrenal growth in vivo, which can likely override the growth inhibitory effects of ACTH. A powerful tool to analyze adrenal gland cortical growth processes has been the experimental model of unilateral adrenalectomy and the resulting compensatory growth of the remaining adrenal gland, which exhibits both hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Studies from the group of William England (216, 217, 716) suggest that, in the absence of ACTH, other proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides affect the mitogenic response of glomerulosa cells in conditions of unilateral adrenalectomy which may be specific to these cells, including Ang II (484), endothelin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (476, 481), adrenomedullin (20), vasopressin (AVP) (559, 560, 709) or growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (46, 282). The most frequently studied peptides are summarized below [for review, see (64, 65, 330)].

**Growth-promoting activities of N-POMC1-28 peptide**

Studies conducted by Estivariz et al. (230) have shown that in vivo immunoneutralization of circulating ACTH, although significantly reducing corticosteroid levels, increases mitogenesis (230). This evidence suggests that the decreased corticosteroid levels lead to an upregulation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expression and of POMC-derived mitogens. Furthermore, peripheral delivery of purified 1 to 28 POMC partially prevents the atrophy of regenerating adrenal glands after hypophysectomy (231). Further in-depth investigation has revealed that the active compound is not 1 to 28 POMC itself, but a smaller peptide, N-POMC (50-74) (also named γ3-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, γ3-MSH) (230, 231, 237, 445), resulting from the cleavage of 1 to 28 POMC by a specific protease called “airway trypsin-like protease” (AsP) (65). While an exhaustive survey has yet to be performed, AsP expression appears to be limited to the adrenal gland and the Y1 cell line (64). More recently, investigations have shown that ACTH, N-POMC and their combination thereof exhibit distinctive effects on the various adrenal zones, thus supporting the concept that at least part of the mitogenic stimulus for the adrenal cortex resides in the N-terminus of POMC (707). However, a specific receptor for N-POMC(1-28)/γ3-MSH has yet to be identified. Studies in POMC-deficient mice have provided evidence that POMC-derived peptides are involved in adrenal growth and development. In adult POMC-deficient mice, there is either no production (374) (149) or a reduction in corticosterone and aldosterone secretion (15), when compared to wild-type mice. Adrenal glands in these animals are smaller and have a disrupted cortical architecture (149). Although POMC-deficient mice are indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates at birth, their adrenal glands subsequently become atrophied and disappear macroscopically in adult mice, due to the absence of proliferation (374).

Figure 6 (A) Impact of the renin-angiotensin system (A) and of ACTH (B) in adrenal gland proliferation. Depicted are 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive nuclei (red) in the outer cortex (upper panel) and inner cortex and medulla (lower panel) from control rat, Ang II-infused rat and rat fed a low-sodium diet (×380). An increase in proliferation can be seen with Ang II and under low-sodium diet conditions, not only in the zona glomerulosa (ZG), but also in the inner zones of the cortex (inner zona fasciculata, ZF and zona reticularis, ZR), at the junction with the medulla (M). In the presence of a low-sodium diet, there is no increase in the zona intermedia (ZI). (B) Time-dependent relationship between steroidogenesis and [³H]-thymidine incorporation in adrenocortical cells in response to ACTH. Adrenocortical cells from adult rats were plated at a density of 1 × 10⁵ cells per cm². ACTH (1 μg/mL) was added on day 13 of culture, after which steroid production and [³H]-thymidine incorporation were respectively measured as a function of time. Data points represent the means of analyses of triplicate incubations. An inverse relationship between stimulation of steroidogenesis and inhibition of DNA synthesis is shown. Over a period of 4 days after the addition of ACTH, steroidogenesis is increased while thymidine incorporation is decreased. (C) Dose-dependent effect of ACTH on steroidogenesis, [³H]-thymidine incorporation and cAMP concentration in functional adrenal tumor cells. For the steroid assay, cells were grown with the indicated concentrations of ACTH for 24 h after which the amount of corticosteroids released into the medium was assayed. For the determination of [³H]-thymidine incorporation, cells were incubated with various concentrations of ACTH for 6 hrs. Two hours before the end of incubation, 10 μCi of [³H]-thymidine was added and the incorporation measured. Each data point of the steroid assay and the determination of [³H]-thymidine incorporation represents the mean value of five cultures. For the cAMP assay, cells were incubated with ACTH for 30 min and the cAMP content assayed. Each data point represents one determination from five combined cultures. As in panel B, the extent of stimulation of steroid secretion and the amount of inhibition of [³H]-thymidine incorporation are closely related, in parallel with cAMP content.

Figure 7 Effect of vasopressin (AVP) on mitotic activity (proliferation) in rat adrenal zona glomerulosa. (A) Long Evans rats were treated with either saline (Control) or AVP (128 μg/day) for 48 h or 6 days. Images are from 5-μm-thick paraffin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Magnification ×327. Mitotic activity (metaphasic cells) (arrows) is observed mainly in the most external portion of the zona glomerulosa (ZG), under the capsule but not in the zona intermedia (ZI) or zona fasciculata (ZF). This effect leads to an enlargement of the zona glomerulosa, which is statistically significant after 6 days of treatment. (B) Using hypophysectomized animals, in which the mitotic activity of glomerulosa cells falls drastically, 2-day treatment with AVP restores this activity by 86%. ACTH treatment is less effective (30%), and when combined with AVP, prevents the effect of AVP. Reproduced, with permission, from Figure 1 (258) and adapted from results of Table 3 (560).

hypoplasia are observed in patients with congenital POMC deficiency (391) or with ACTH receptor (melanocortin 2 receptor, MC2R) or MC2R accessory protein (MRAP) mutations. These patients are hypocortisolemic but have normal aldosterone levels, indicative of a functional zona glomerulosa [for reviews see (117, 118, 163, 391, 725)]. Therefore, it has been suggested that ACTH induces differentiation and hypertrophy and that the other POMC peptides are mainly required for cell proliferation [for review, see (330)].

### Other growth-promoting neuropeptides

The action of AVP, oxytocin, neurotensin, bombesin, neuropeptide Y, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide have been well documented [for reviews, see (189, 211, 530, 531, 684)]. For example, a 2-day treatment with AVP in rats increases glomerulosa cell proliferation by 11-fold, while ACTH displays no mitogenic activity (560). Metaphasic cells have been observed mainly under the capsule, as opposed to near or in the zona intermedia. This effect results in a significant enlargement of the zona glomerulosa after 6 days of treatment (Fig. 7A). However, in contrast to what is observed using chronic ACTH treatment (561), zona glomerulosa cells retain their ultrastructural properties and characteristic cellular arrangement. In fact, the morphology of the zona glomerulosa resulting from AVP action is similar to that produced by a sodium-deficient diet. In hypophysectomized animals, in which mitotic activity of glomerulosa cells drastically falls, 2-day treatment with AVP restores this activity by more than 80% while ACTH appears less effective (30%). This direct effect of AVP has been further confirmed using cultured glomerulosa cells (475, 559). However, in these conditions, when ACTH is added together with AVP, the effect of AVP is decreased (561) (Fig. 7B), thus suggesting that ACTH has a negative effect on AVP-induced proliferation. Additional evidence of the beneficial effect of AVP on mitogenesis has been demonstrated by Malendowiz and Nussdorfer (426, 480) where a 7- to 8-day AVP treatment in rats prevents dexamethasone-induced atrophy of the adrenal cortex. AVP acts on the adrenal cortex through binding to V1a-subtype AVP receptors which induce the breakdown of membrane phosphoinositides, with subsequent accumulation of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol, both key second messengers for proliferation and/or steroidogenesis [reviewed in (258)].

Steroidogenesis—Adrenal Cell Signal Transduction

Endothelin-1 also stimulates mitotic activity in the rat zona glomerulosa. Subcutaneous infusion of endothelin-1 for 24 h induces an increase in the mitotic index (% of metaphase-arrested cells) of rat adrenal zona glomerulosa, similar to that observed with AVP or ACTH (132). bFGF and insulin-like growth factor (IGFs) have also been largely documented as growth factors for the adrenal cortex (211). Their actions are mediated through receptor tyrosine kinases which, upon activation, form stable complexes with tissue-signaling molecules, eventually leading to the regulation of protooncogene transcription factors, such as c-fos and c-jun, via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway [for review, see (211, 330)]. bFGF is a potent mitogen for Y1, bovine (282, 342) and human fetal (490) adrenocortical cells. It also stimulates the expression and activity of the 17α-hydroxylase enzyme, the Ang II type I receptor (AT₁R) and the α-subunit of GTP-binding protein as well as Gq and G11 proteins. Various bFGF isoforms and their binding sites have been detected in bovine and rat adrenal glands (329, 660), mainly in the capsule and zona glomerulosa (649). In studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying the compensatory hypertrophy following unilateral adrenalectomy, bFGF and its receptors have been shown to be concentrated in the capsular-zona glomerulosa (47). Several studies have also clearly indicated that IGF-II, but not IGF-I, is a key fetal growth factor, whereas IGF-I is important during the postnatal period (305, 491). Both IGF type-1 and type-2 receptors have been found, although IGF type-2 receptors are in fact more abundant in bovine adrenocortical cells (741). Both are also involved in steroid secretion in adults (211, 330).

Cellular nonesterified (free) cholesterol can potentially be derived from several different sources: (1) *de novo* cellular cholesterol synthesis, (2) circulating lipoprotein-derived cholesteryl esters obtained by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytic pathways, (3) “selective uptake” through high-density lipoprotein/scavenger-receptor l (HDL-SR-BI), and (4) the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters into free cholesterol by the cytosolic cholesterol ester hydrolase, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Cholesterol is thereafter transported to the mitochondrion for its conversion to cortisol and aldosterone (Fig. 8). Although steroidogenic cells can synthesize cholesterol *de novo* in the endoplasmic reticulum, the high demand for cholesterol in steroidogenic cells requires efficient import of cholesterol found in circulating lipoproteins, primarily derived from dietary sources. In the aftermath of the pioneering work conducted in the late 1970s (96, 109, 273, 296), many studies were undertaken in the ensuing decade to establish whether cholesterol is delivered into adrenocortical cells through LDL or HDL. In the following text, we will review how these various pathways operate and discuss the role of LDL/LDLR versus HDL/SR-BI in human adrenocortical steroidogenesis. We will also review how nonesterified cholesterol should be exported from the cells (efflux) to avoid cell toxicity. Much of the information below was drawn from the following reviews (155, 177, 350, 389, 496, 525, 616, 624, 641).

### Initial steps: from cholesterol uptake in cells to free cholesterol necessary for steroidogenesis

#### De novo synthesis

Although endogenous synthesis of cholesterol is certainly not the primary source of free cholesterol for steroidogenesis, it remains an important avenue under certain physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Endogenous synthesis of cholesterol is initiated from mevalonate and isoprenoid precursors. An important rate-controlling step in this biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase (Fig. 8A, pathway 1), which converts mevalonate to squalene, and subsequently to lanosterol and cholesterol. The endoplasmic reticulum-associated integral membrane protein complex, namely sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein, controls the gene expression of many enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis including HMG-CoA reductase. In steroidogenic cells, de novo cholesterol biosynthesis is also under the control of ACTH (601) (Fig. 8A, pathway 1) [reviewed in (350, 389, 616)].

### Conclusion

In summary, even though the adrenal cortex produces three types of steroids in a specific-dependent manner (aldosterone in zona glomerulosa, glucocorticoids in zona fasciculata and androgens in zona reticularis), the entire cortex originates from mesenchymal and progenitor cells in the subcapsular region of the gland. Both extrinsic and intrinsic cues are thereafter responsible for migration and selective expression of steroidogenic enzymes responsible for the differentiated adrenocortical cells. However, one of the unique properties of the adrenal gland is its ability to adapt its structural pattern according to physiological conditions. Hence, as outlined by the representative examples described above, the adrenal cortex is a highly dynamic tissue where growth and function are deeply interconnected (330, 539) and where the number and size of adrenal cells directly impact their function (189, 211, 330, 539).

### Mechanisms Involved in Steroidogenesis

(A) Cellular uptake of cholesterol, intracellular processing and biosynthetic utilization of steroid hormones. Free cholesterol for steroidogenesis can potentially be derived from four different sources. Pathway 1: Cholesterol may be synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from acetyl CoA via the rate limiting enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated integral membrane protein complex, namely the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), controls the gene expression of a number of enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis including the rate-limiting enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase. Pathway 2: Low density lipoprotein (LDL), containing cholesterol, binds to the LDL receptor (LDL-R), and is trafficked through the endosomal pathway (clathrin-coated pits, early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes). The transfer of cholesterol to the mitochondria from the late endosomes and lysosomes is facilitated by MLN64, along with the assistance of Nieman-Pick type C1 (NPC1) and Nieman-Pick type C2 (NPC2) in transferring cholesterol out of the lysosomes. Pathway 3: Cholesterol may be transferred from high density lipoproteins (HDL) to the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm by the scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) receptor, localized in caveolin-rich domains (called lipid rafts or caveolae). The cholesteryl esterase, called hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), converts esterified cholesterol (CE) from the plasma membrane to free cholesterol (FC), which can be used for steroidogenesis. CE can also be stored in lipid droplets (LD). Pathway 4: HSL also interacts with esterified cholesterol present in lipid droplets, generating free cholesterol for use in steroidogenesis. Free (nonesterified) cholesterol (FC) can be esterified for storage in lipid droplets by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) (step 5) or can be transported into mitochondria for steroidogenesis (step 6). At this step, cholesterol is transferred to the translocator/steroidogenic acute regulatory protein complex (Continued)
repeats; the receptor also contains a sequence with similar-  
ities to the membrane-bound precursor of epidermal growth  
factor (EGF), which is important for ligand uncoupling in  
acidified endosomes. At the level of the cytoplasmic domain,  
aNPxY (Asn, Pro, x, Tyr) sequence is recognized by adaptor  
proteins (such as AP-2 adaptor complex) linking the recep-  
tor to clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 8B) (268, 690). After bind-  
ing to the LDLR, apolipoprotein E (apoE)- and apolipopro-  
tein B (apoB)-containing lipoprotein particles are internal-  
ized into clathrin-coated pits, which in turn become coated  
vesicles. Mutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor  
lead to high plasma cholesterol levels and the development  
of atherosclerotic lesions at an early age (274, 690). In early  
endosomes, LDL cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed by a lyso-  
somal acid lipase. The released cholesterol accumulates in late  
endosomes/lysosomes, while LDL receptors, which remain  
fully intact, are delivered to the recycling compartments for  
their return to the plasma membrane. Released nonesterified  
cholesterol is subsequently transported to the mitochondria  
for the synthesis of steroid hormones (or alternatively trans-  
ported to the plasma membrane as a membrane constituent or  
to the endoplasmic reticulum for esterification by the resident  
endoplasmic reticulum enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol  
acyltransferase I (ACAT1) (Fig. 8A, pathway 5) and storage  
in lipid droplets) [for review see (120, 274, 350, 496)]. A pair  
of proteins named Nieman-Pick type C1 and type C2 (NPC1  
and NPC2) are important in the movement of nonesterified  
cholesterol out of the late endosomes and lysosomes (120).  
Additional proteins, such as MLN64, facilitate the movement  
of lysosomal cholesterol to the mitochondria for steroido-  
genesis. MLN64 (also called StarD3) is a member of the  
Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid  
transfer domain superfamily that possesses cholesterol bind-  
ing and transport activity (Fig. 8A, pathway 2) [review in  
(350, 496)].  

All steroidogenic tissues from human and non-human  
mammals express the LDLR (297) [for reviews see (155,  
274, 350, 389, 616)]. However, the LDLR is not necessary for  
acute adrenal steroidogenesis in mouse adrenocortical cells  
(389), since hormone production is normal in mice lacking  
LDLR (389). Patients with low LDL cholesterol secondary  
to congenital abetalipoproteinemia have normal basal cor-  
tisol concentrations and mildly impaired cortisol secretion  
in response to ACTH. Such results suggest that endogenous  
synthesis may be an alternative in these conditions and that  
the LDLR is not essential for acute adrenal steroidogenesis  
[for review see (155, 350, 389, 496, 616, 641)].  

### Uptake of HDL-cholesterol through SR-BI  

Scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SR-BI) is a member of  
a family of structurally related proteins, called the CD36  
superfamily. Both can bind HDL with high affinity, but of  
the two, only SR-BI mediates efficient selective lipid uptake  
(155, 156, 616). Class B scavenger receptor family members  
share similar hairpin-like membrane topologies, with the large  
midportion of the protein residing extracellularly, anchored  
to the plasma membrane by transmembrane domains adjacen-  
t to short N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains (641)  
(Fig. 8C). The selective uptake of cholesterol through SR-BI  
is fundamentally different from the classic receptor-mediated  
endocytic pathway for the LDLR. Receptor-mediated HDL  
binding to the cell surface results in the transfer of its  
cholesteryl esters into the cell, while the subsequent lipid-  
depleted particles including their two major apolipoproteins,  
apoA-I and apoA-II, are released back into the extracel-  
lular fluid [for review see (155, 350, 389, 616, 641, 690)].  
This pathway involves a reversible incorporation of HDL  
cholesteryl ester into the plasma membrane followed by  
hydrolysis through a nonlysosomal cholesteryl ester hydro-  
lase, called hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (Fig. 8A, path-  
way 3). The SR-B1-mediated selective uptake pathway rep-  
resents a major supply of cholesterol for steroidogenesis  
(29, 155, 616). This is especially true in rodents and is evi-  
denced from the near absence of cholesteryl ester accumula-  
tion in steroidogenic cells of mice in which SR-BI is knocked-  
down (617). Indeed, mice deficient in apoA-I, the major HDL  
ligand for SR-BI, display blunted corticosterone responses  
to ACTH treatment and stress in spite of an upregulated  
endogenous cholesterol synthesis pathway (583). In adreno-  
cortical cells, as in other tissues where SR-BI is expressed,  
SR-BI is concentrated in microdomains rich in cholesterol  
and sphingolipid (called lipid rafts or caveolae) (28). In these  
caveolae, SR-BI predominates on microrvillar extensions of  
the plasma membrane, structured as a hydrophobic “chan-  
nel” (283, 610) [for review, see (28, 155, 389, 615)] (Fig. 8A,  
pathway 3). SR-BI directly facilitates lipid transfer that  
follows a two-step mechanism of selective uptake. The initial

The ligand-binding region consists of seven cysteine-rich repeats (R1-R7) (green). The second region in the LDL-R ectodomain consists of three EGF-like repeats (A, B, and C) comprised of 40 amino acids (illustrated in red and blue), and is involved in preventing the acid-dependent dissociation of ligand in endosomes. The third region in the LDL-R ectodomain is enriched in serine and threonine residues that function as acceptor sites for O-linked sugars (purple). The transmembrane domain consists of a sequence of 24 amino acids which anchors the LDL-R in the lipid bilayer. Endocytosis and intracellular transport of the LDL-R are regulated via its cytosolic domain. The NPXY motif adopts a tight hairpin conformation that serves as a binding site for a variety of adaptor proteins and signaling molecules, including clathrin. (C) Schematic representation of the scavenger receptor B type I (SR-BI): (1) cholesterol flux (orange circles) is facilitated by selective proteins, such as CLAMP (carboxy-terminal linking and modulating protein); (2) the C-terminal PDZ-interacting domain of SR-BI (including K509), mediates direct interaction with adaptor molecules; and (3) the C-terminal transmembrane domain (CTTM) of SR-BI is required for signaling. Cholesterol binds directly to the CTTM. ApoA-I indicates apolipoprotein A-I; HDL, high-density lipoprotein. Reproduced, with permission, from Figure 3 (268) (B) and Figure 1 (641).  step is the binding of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins to the cell surface/microvilli-associated SR-BI followed by release of lipo protein-cholesterol esters. Accessory proteins and lipids, in addition to SR-BI, contribute to the selective uptake process. One such protein, CLAMP (carboxy-terminal linking and modulating protein), recognizes SR-BI *via* its N-terminal PDZ domain (690). For up-to-date details on the various molecular proteins and events associated with SR-BI, readers are invited to consult recent reviews (155, 350, 641).

In addition to HDL, SR-BI binds a variety of ligands, including oxidized and acetylated LDL, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and phospholipids. Several reports suggest that lipid-free apoA-I is a poor substrate for SR-BI. Indeed, using gene knockout mice, Plump et al. (583) showed that apoA-I deficiency causes an almost complete failure to accumulate cholesteryl ester in steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland, although apoE and apoA-II deficiencies only have a modest effect on cholesteryl ester accumulation. This result illustrates the importance of HDL-apoA-I for cholesterol homeostasis in steroidogenic cells, presumably *via* its role in the selective uptake pathway. The expression of SR-BI protein *in vivo* and *in vitro* is induced by ACTH and suppressed by glucocorticoids (104, 406, 435, 615, 692, 735).

Although there is a lack of direct evidence suggesting that SR-BI plays a critical role in human adrenal gland function, the normal ACTH response observed in patients presenting familial hypercholesterolemia—where the LDLR is nonfunctional—is consistent with the involvement of SR-BI in adrenal cholesterol uptake (14) [for review see (155, 350, 389, 616, 641)]. In addition, the proportion of cholesterol synthesized *de novo* is significantly larger in the human adult adrenal gland than in the bovine adrenal gland (321). Indeed, early studies in human cells in culture suggested that the LDLR was more important for cholesterol delivery than the HDL/SR-BI pathway (464) [documented and reviewed in (18, 496)]. However, the expression pattern of human SR-BI (1, 406) and its regulation in human steroidogenic cells (435, 464) suggest that SR-BI is likely involved in human HDL metabolism, an observation also confirmed in certain experiments in culture conditions (360) [for review see (155, 350, 389, 616, 641)]. Bovine adrenocortical cells, in contrast to Y-1, rat or human adrenal cells, differ in their nonesterified cholesterol content (602). Bovine adrenal cells in primary culture contain sevenfold more nonesterified cholesterol than cholesteryl ester (602), a ratio that is not sufficient for the amount of corticosteroid or pregnenolone released after ACTH stimulation, suggesting a need for either cellular production of cholesterol or the metabolism of nonesterified cholesterol within the cell.

Mobilization of cellular cholesterol reserves in response to acute hormonal stimulation—the role of hormone sensitive lipase

Once transferred into the cytoplasm, hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters is achieved through a nonlysosomal cholesteryl ester hydrolase, called HSL. Cholesteryl esters are either immediately used for steroidogenesis or stored in lipid droplets. It is well-known that adrenal cholesteryl esters are rapidly depleted following stimulating treatment. This mobilization of cholesterol occurs through cAMP and PKA activation for ACTH (155, 493–496) and through p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> for Ang II-stimulated aldosterone synthesis (131). Following phosphorylation, HSL is translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in order to exert its catalytic function, whereas stored cholesteryl ester is hydrolyzed at the surface of the lipid droplet (Fig. 8A, pathway 4) (337). Once the cholesteryl esters have undergone hydrolysis, the HSL can interact with various cholesterol-binding proteins to direct cholesterol to the outer mitochondrial membrane for steroidogenesis. This pathway involving various cholesterol-binding proteins has been detailed in recent reviews (155, 389, 495, 496, 624) (Fig. 8A, pathway 6).

In summary, there are multiple and redundant systems for cellular cholesterol delivery needed for steroidogenesis. The question still remains as to whether or not SR-B1-mediated delivery of cholesterol to the adrenal gland is as important in humans as it appears to be in rodents. The answer to this question may provide a better understanding of patients presenting adrenal insufficiency during a stress response or systemic bacterial infection or sepsis. In addition, it may address some of the potential causes of female infertility since female SR-B1-deficient mice have infertility issues (155).

Reverse transport of cholesterol

Why is it important to have cholesterol efflux? As described above, under basal or resting conditions, cholesterol delivered to the adrenal gland is primarily stored by its conversion into cholesteryl esters by the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) enzyme or effluxed back in the circulation. In all studies performed to date, SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux has been correlated with the ability of this receptor to mediate selective uptake, suggesting that the mechanisms of influx and efflux may be linked in order to avoid the toxic effects generated by high levels of free cholesterol [for review, see (616)]. For example, in conditions of acute stress, intracellular cholesteryl ester stores are rapidly mobilized and the selective uptake pathway is upregulated to meet the demands of steroid hormone production. Similarly, chronic stress (environmental or dietary) also results in the sustained import of cholesterol to the adrenal gland. At the end of the stress response, the system must be switched back to storage and efflux (basal conditions) (176). Cummins et al. (177) have found that liver X receptors, LXRα and LXRβ, play an important role in preventing accumulation of free cholesterol in mouse adrenal glands by controlling expression of genes involved in all aspects of cholesterol utilization, including the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which is a novel LXR target. The LXRs are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by oxysterols, that is, endogenous oxidative metabolites of cholesterol. In the adrenal gland, oxysterols are formed as intermediates inthe conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones and can act as endogenous activators of LXR [for illustration, see Figure 1 from (176)].

### From free cholesterol to corticosteroids

In contrast to peptide hormones, steroidogenic cells store very little steroid hormones, thus steroid secretion is constitutively linked to steroid synthesis. The critical step in steroid hormone biosynthesis is the transport of free cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc or CYP11A1) (see Table 2) catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. This transport is mediated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which is considered as the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis (155, 364, 495, 496, 688), and other partners such as translocator protein (TSPO), previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (551, 624). The most compelling evidence directed toward a role of StAR in steroidogenesis has been provided by the demonstration that mutations in the StAR gene cause a fatal condition in newborns, congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, characterized by severe impairment of steroidogenesis and hypertrophied adrenal glands containing high levels of cholesteryl esters and free cholesterol. Studies in StAR-knockout mice have confirmed that StAR is essential in triggering steroidogenesis [for review, see (496, 688)]. However, whereas the transcriptional and/or translational inhibition of StAR expression results in a dramatic decrease in steroid biosynthesis, approximately 10% to 15% of steroid synthesis appears to be mediated by StAR-independent mechanisms (688). Increasing evidences suggest that StAR and TSPO interact functionally in mediating the transfer of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane. TSPO is a high-affinity cholesterol-binding mitochondrial protein, with a cytoplasmic domain containing a cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus domain (551). TSPO is expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it appears in a multi-protein complex consisting of the 18-kDa TSPO and other proteins, including the voltage-dependent anion channel, the adenine nucleotide translocator and the TSPO and protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit RIα-associated protein (PAP7) [for more details, see Figure 5 from (496) or Figure 3 from (624)].

Steroidogenesis is processed according to a shuttle system between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. The various steps of cellular cholesterol delivery, intracellular processing and utilization for biosynthesis of steroid hormones have been detailed in several reviews (26, 153, 310, 350, 495, 496, 597), along with an elegant history of adrenal research on steroidogenesis (494). Steroidogenesis is performed through a series of enzymatic steps that involve three cytochrome P450 enzymes and one hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc, CYP11A1), the 21-hydroxylase, P450c21 (CYP21A2), and the

aldosterone synthase P450c11AS (also called P450c11B2) (CYP11B2) enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. CYP11A1 and CYP11B2 genes are localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, while CYP21 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 9). In the adrenal cortex of ungulates (such as cattle, pigs and sheep) and amphibians (such as bullfrogs), a single P450c11β enzyme produces aldosterone and cortisol in the zonae glomerulosa and zona fasciculata, although through different catalytic processes. In contrast, two isoforms are present in the adrenal gland of rodents (such as rats, mice, and hamsters) and humans. In these latter species, the capacity of the adrenal cortex to differentially produce aldosterone and cortisol predominantly relies on the expression of aldosterone synthase (P450also) (responsible for 18-hydroxylation, followed by 18-oxidation) and 11β-hydroxylase (P450c11β). P450aldo catalyzes the final steps in the biosynthesis of aldosterone and is expressed only in the glomerulosa, while P450c11β catalyzes the final steps in the biosynthesis of cortisol and is expressed in the fasciculata/reticularis. The zonal expression of these two isozymes appears to result from transcriptional regulation of the two genes (310). Of note, in contrast to CYP11B1, CYP11B2 is not under the stimulating control of SF-1 [reviewed in (597)]. Each of these steps is controlled by several proteins, for which ACTH (for zona fasciculata) and Ang II and K⁺ (for zona glomerulosa) are the most representative.

### Circadian rhythm of glucocorticoid secretion

Plasma and cortisol levels are submitted to a circadian and pulsatile secretion rate which is under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Disruption of normal suprachiasmatic nucleus activity by exposure to constant light abolishes the circadian rhythm of corticosterone in the rat (553). There is also an intra-adrenal cortical clock (537, 681) [for review, see (538)], which regulates both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid steroidogenesis independently from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Indeed, the rhythmic oscillations, within a period of 24 h, were shown not to differ between hypophysectomized and intact rats (233). These circadian rhythms are under the control of a number of genes and proteins that form transcriptional/translational feedback loops. The canonical clock genes Per1, Per2, and Bmal1 are detected in the outer adrenal cortex (233, 537, 553, 681, 730). Examination of mice with adrenal-specific knockdown of the canonical clock protein BMAL1 reveals that the adrenal clock machinery is required for circadian glucocorticoid production. All studies conducted to date conclude that the adrenal peripheral clock plays an essential role in establishing the circadian glucocorticoid rhythm (681).

### Conclusion

In summary, cholesterol necessary to initiate steroidogenesis may be provided by multiple and redundant systems (de novo synthesis, LDL receptor-mediated endocytic pathways or “selective uptake” through high-density

lipoprotein/scavenger-receptor 1, followed by intracellular hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters into free cholesterol). Thereafter, free cholesterol is translocated from the cytoplasm to the inner mitochondrial membrane to initiate steroidogenesis. This process is initiated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which acts with other partners, such as TSPO, organized in a multi-protein complex. The various steroids are produced according to a highly organized shuttling system between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, through a series of enzymatic steps that involve three cytochrome P450 enzymes and one hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The capacity to produce aldosterone, cortisol, and/or corticosterone relies on species-specific expression of the steroidogenic enzymes. In addition to the physiological demand, steroid production follows a circadian rhythm which is under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and by intra-adrenal cortical clock regulated genes.

results to date indicate that ACTH is more of a differentiation factor than a growth/proliferating factor (see also section related to growth-promoting activities). In the following subsections, we will summarize how ACTH and Ang II differentially regulate cortisol/corticosterone and aldosterone secretions. We will also summarize classical and well-accepted pathways, as well as introduce new findings which still remain subject to debate or yet to be explored in the adrenal cortex. The writing of this section has been facilitated and largely inspired by excellent reviews, both classic and recent (26, 310, 597, 688).

### ACTH and steroidogenesis

ACTH not only stimulates steroid secretion, but also increases the expression of a number of genes including those involved in steroidogenesis (118, 243, 261, 310, 670). There is thus acute and chronic regulation of steroid biosynthesis by ACTH. The rapid phase of ACTH-stimulated cortisol/corticosterone occurs within minutes and involves rapid delivery of free cholesterol to mitochondria (via phosphorylation and activation of HSL, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol). In response to ACTH, cAMP also stimulates phosphorylation of StAR (the rate-limiting step in steroid production) almost immediately, thereby doubling its activity and stimulating transcription of the StAR gene within minutes. StAR increases the flow of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it

### The Role and Mechanisms of ACTH in the Adrenal Cortex

Secretion of glucocorticoids (mainly corticosterone and cortisol) by the zona fasciculata and androgens by the zona reticularis are mainly controlled by ACTH while aldosterone secretion is mainly regulated by angiotensin II (Ang II). This functional statement is directly correlated with adrenocortical morphology, at least under chronic situations. Accumulated

Figure 9 Steroidogenesis in the adrenal gland. Following the StAR-mediated uptake of cholesterol into mitochondria of adrenocortical cells, aldosterone, cortisol, and adrenal androgen precursors are synthesized through the coordinated action of a series of steroidogenic enzymes in a zone-specific manner. The adrenal cortex produces zone-specific steroids as a result of the differential expression of steroidogenic enzymes. In the initial step of steroidogenesis, steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein is needed for the rate-limiting step of movement of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where cholesterol is cleaved by cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc) to pregnenolone. Further steps of the steroidogenic pathway include the enzymes 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3β-HSD2), 17α-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase (P450c17), 21-hydroxylase (P450c21), 11β-hydroxylase (P450c11β), and aldosterone synthase (P450aldo). Adapted, with permission, from Figure 1 (26).

becomes a substrate for P450scc for inducing formation of pregnenolone, initiating steroidogenesis. The delayed action of ACTH occurs over a period of hours and involves induction of mRNA coding for each of the steroidogenic enzymes. During a more sustained stimulation, ACTH, through cAMP, promotes transcription of genes encoding the steroidogenic enzymes, especially CYP11A1 (encoding the enzymatically rate-limiting enzyme P450scc). Finally, long-term exposure to ACTH (weeks and months) promotes adrenal growth: ACTH via its second messenger, cAMP, promotes the intra-adrenal synthesis of growth factors, promoting cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia (496, 688).

Regulation of acute aldosterone secretion by ACTH

Although in vivo ACTH exerts a minor effect on aldosterone secretion, in in vitro studies, the most potent stimulus of glomerulosa cells is unquestionably ACTH, which increases aldosterone production 40-fold at a plateau concentration of 100 nmol/L and twofold to threefold at concentrations of 1 pmol/L or less. However, in spite of these striking in vitro effects, there are also several arguments supporting that ACTH is not the main regulator of aldosterone production in vivo. Firstly, as described above, adrenal glands obtained from mice with targeted ablation of pituitary corticotrophs (thus having very low circulating ACTH) can maintain CYP11B2, but not CYP11B1 (15), a finding that confirms observations in humans presenting secondary adrenal insufficiency. Secondly, chronic exposure to ACTH decreases plasma aldosterone levels in humans and adrenal expression of CYP11B2 in various animal models (7, 247, 334). Thirdly, in vitro studies have further shown that treatment with cAMP analogs preferentially increases CYP11B1 mRNA expression over that of CYP11B2 [reviewed in (310, 597)].

Certain observations may explain the mechanisms preventing the response of glomerulosa cells to ACTH: (i)
cAMP signaling has a negative effect on the expression of Ang II receptors in adrenocortical cells (19, 68, 760) thereby desensitizing glomerulosa cells to Ang II. (ii) ACTH may also decrease aldosterone synthesis by inducing CYP11B1 and CYP17, enzymes that will effectively remove precursors from the pathway leading to mineralocorticoids and utilize the former for cortisol synthesis (70, 482). The question, therefore, remains as to how the zona glomerulosa maintains CYP11B2 expression in the presence of normal circulating levels of ACTH; (iii) at least in bovine glomerulosa cells, there is a high expression of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein G<sub>i</sub>. Ang II signaling through the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor is coupled to G<sub>i</sub> and, in this manner, may inhibit ACTH-stimulated cAMP production (52, 54, 312). (iv) adrenal glomerulosa cells express adenylyl cyclase isoforms 5 and 6 (AC5 and AC6) (166, 676). These isoforms are inhibited by a rise in intracellular calcium. Thus, the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced by Ang II may act to decrease AC5 and AC6 activities and accordingly, decrease ACTH-induced cAMP.

### Chronic effects of ACTH on adrenal zonation and adrenocortical cell phenotype

It is well accepted that chronic ACTH treatment (2 weeks) not only results in a significant suppression of aldosterone secretion, but also induces a morphological transformation of zona glomerulosa cells into zona fasciculata-like cells, indicating a gradual loss of cellular differentiation of zona glomerulosa cells (7, 175, 344, 506, 563, 585, 613). The mechanisms by which prolonged administration of ACTH causes a decrease in aldosterone secretion have been extensively studied in the rat. After 6 days of treatment with ACTH (2 U/day), blood corticosterone is found to be elevated while plasma aldosterone is decreased in rats maintained on either a normal or low sodium diet. In collagenase-dispersed glomerulosa cells from adrenal glands of ACTH-treated rats, Ang II receptors are markedly decreased, as are *in vitro* aldosterone responses to Ang II, ACTH, 8-bromo-cAMP and potassium. However, the production of deoxycorticosterone and precursor steroids is conversely increased, indicating a blockade in the late aldosterone biosynthetic pathway. Measurement of the activity of steroidogenic enzymes in isolated mitochondria reveal an 80% increase in side-chain cleavage enzyme in both glomerulosa and fasciculata mitochondria from ACTH-treated rats. Although ACTH treatment also increases 11-hydroxylase activity in the zona fasciculata, this enzyme is reduced by 50% in mitochondria from zona glomerulosa cells, as in the case of 18-hydroxylase activity which is also markedly decreased. Such chronic ACTH treatment in rats not only decreases aldosterone secretion, but prevents further stimulation by ACTH *in vitro* (7, 562). The amount of Ang II receptors are also decreased, indicating suppression of renin-angiotensin activity (7). Together, these results indicate that during prolonged ACTH treatment, the zona glomerulosa cell may be converted to a functional zona fasciculata cell type (7, 344, 460, 562, 585) [reviewed in (163, 585)].

### Properties of ACTH binding to its receptor

Much progress has been made over the past decade regarding the precise molecular mechanisms by which ACTH acts on its receptor, called MC2 (melanocortin 2 receptor). In the following text, we will discuss structure-activity relationships between ACTH and its MC2 receptor (MC2R) as well as the functional regulation of this receptor and the various signaling pathways stimulated by ACTH. ACTH is one of the peptides generated from the POMC precursor polypeptide. Following successive cleavages by selective prohormone convertases, three families of peptides are generated, including the ACTH-peptide family (152, 361). ACTH is comprised of 39 amino acids corresponding to a.a. 138–176 of the POMC. ACTH is essentially produced in corticotroph cells from the anterior pituitary and is cleaved by the proconvertase PC2 to generate α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone MSH (α-MSH) (a.a. 1–13 of ACTH) (142). These peptides can be further processed in smaller fragments (Fig. 10A) for which a role either in proliferation [for N-POMC(1–28)] or in adrenocortical steroidogenesis and food intake has been described (for γ3-MSH) (289, 596).

The relationship between ACTH and its receptor is among the pioneer studies in the field of endocrinology (314, 415). However, as summarized by Adrian J.L. Clark (143, 144), following these promising earlier studies, several difficulties in obtaining a radioligand able to retain biological activity or finding an appropriate cellular model to perform selective structure-activity relationships, have impeded studies regarding this receptor.

#### Binding studies

Following the initial studies of Robert Lefkowitz et al. (415) and of Schulster and Schwyzer (1980) [reported in (200)], the development of the “Ramachandran analog” enabled further in-depth studies on the properties of ACTH binding to adrenocortical preparations. In this particular analog, the amino acid tyrosine 2 (Tyr2) is substituted by a phenylalanine and methionine 4 by a norleucine. Tyr2 is important for biological activity, while methionine 4 becomes oxidized during the iodination procedure. This modified peptide can, therefore, only be iodinated on Tyr23, while the substitution of methionine 4 by a norleucine avoids oxidation during the iodination procedure (98). Using this biologically active iodinated peptide, several studies have been performed documenting either one (98, 569) or two binding sites following ACTH binding to adrenocortical membranes or cells (256), one of high affinity and low capacity (*K*<sub>d</sub> = 10 pmol/L) and the other of low affinity with high capacity (*K*<sub>d</sub> = 10 nmol/L). Although the identity of these two sites has often been questioned [reviewed in (143, 144, 571)], the finding of two binding sites for ACTH on its receptor is in keeping with the suggestions put forward from structure-activity relationship studies (93, 260, 371, 386, 651). Moreover, the most recent investigations, using various molecular manipulations, largely confirm these initial findings (126, 165, 246, 325, 430, 720).

Fragments with antagonistic activities

Figure 10 Schematic representation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) processing and importance of selected ACTH amino acids. (A) Prohormone convertase 1 (PC1 also called PC3) catabolizes the parent POMC peptide into three families of peptides, including the ACTH-peptide family (green), the β-lipotropin peptides (pink), and the N-terminal POMC peptides (blue). The ACTH sequence is further cleaved (by PC2) to generate α-MSH and the corticotrophin-like intermediate peptide (CLIP); the C-terminal β-LPH is further cleaved to generate γ-LPH, β-endorphin and β-MSH, while the N-terminal POMC (also named Pro-γ-MSH) can be cleaved into N-POMC (1-52), which in turn can be further cleaved into N-POMC (1-28) by the adrenal secretory protease (Asp). On the other hand, the second product of Pro-γ-MSH cleavage is γ3-MSH, which may be further cleaved in γ2-MSH and γ1-MSH. The final products are generated in a tissue-specific manner. (B) Functional domains in the ACTH sequence. The amino acid sequence highlighted in red (HFRW) (His<sup>6</sup>-Phe<sup>7</sup>-Arg<sup>8</sup>-Trp<sup>9</sup>) is essential for binding and cAMP production by α-MSH. A second sequence highlighted in green (KKRR) (Lys<sup>15</sup>-Lys<sup>16</sup>-Arg<sup>17</sup>-Arg<sup>18</sup>) is essential for the binding of ACTH to its receptor. The first sequence HFRW is named “message,” while the second sequence KKRR is called “address.” Certain fragments, such as ACTH (11-24) and ACTH (7-39) not only lack activity, but act as competitive antagonists of the effect of full length ACTH.

Cloning and functionality of the ACTH receptor

In 1990, both the α-MSH receptor (135, 504) and the ACTH receptor were cloned (101, 504), followed by the discovery of three subsequent melanocortin receptor members, resulting in the names MC1 to MC5 based on the order of their cloning. Thus, MSH-R and ACTH-R were renamed MC1 and MC2 receptors (MC1R and MC2R), respectively. Because α-MSH is part of the ACTH peptide, it is not surprising that the two receptors share highly related amino acid sequences [for review, see (152)]. Comparative sequences are illustrated in recent reviews (200, 201, 430, 720). The five MCRs constitute a distinct family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), characterized by their unusually short coding sequence and

the absence of highly conserved amino acid residues or motifs common to most GPCRs (266, 654). MC2R is both the smallest MCR and the smallest known GPCR (297 amino acids, see structure in Figure 11A). Comparatively to other MCRs, MC2R is unique in that it binds only ACTH and does not possess affinities for other melanocortins (α-, β-, and γ-MSH) [for review see (201, 266, 430, 571)]. Using mRNA in situ hybridization, MC2R was found to be predominantly expressed in the adrenal cortex with the highest levels of expression found in the zona glomerulosa and fasciculata and weaker expression in the zona reticularis (63, 654, 703). It was further evidenced that the number of ACTH-binding sites can be increased by ACTH, Ang II and dexamethasone (413, 569) [reviewed in (143)].

Figure 11 Importance of melanocortin-2 receptor accessory proteins (MRAPs) in ACTH/MC2R expression and functionality. (A) Stable isogenic 293/FRT cells expressing either MRAPα or MRAPβ were transiently transfected with Myc-hMC2R or MC2R-GFP and assessed for cAMP production in the presence of 1 μmol/L IBMX for 15 min. Upper panel: the data are expressed as fold increases over basal cAMP levels to illustrate maximal effects. Lower panel: the data from upper panel were normalized from 0% to 100% to visualize shifts in dose-response curves. Maximal cAMP stimulation is lower in MRAPα-expressing cells, although normalization indicates that MRAPα-expressing cells are more efficient. In MC2R-GFP transfected cells, responses are lower. When illustrated as normalized data (lower panel), EC₅₀ values for MC2R-GFP expressed in MRAPα and MRAPβ isogenic cell lines are clearly right shifted compared with untagged- and Myc-MC2R cell lines. Thus, the presence of GFP at the C terminus of MC2R alters the potency and sensitivity of the ACTH response (635). (B) Immunofluorescence labeling of MRAP isoforms and of MC2R expressed in double stable isogenic cell lines. MRAPβ with anti-Flag antibody (Ba), MC2R was labeled with anti-c-Myc antibody (Bb) and subsequently detected using secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa-Fluor594 for MRAP (red) and to Alexa-Fluor488 for Myc-MC2R (green). Green and red signals were acquired at the nuclear plane to visualize both the outside and cytoplasmic border of the cell membranes. Both MRAPβ and hC2R are localized at the cell membrane. However, as shown in the merged image (Bc) and magnifications (Bd), red and green fluorescent labeling are not always superimposed. Magnifications clearly evidence MRAPβ at the cytoplasmic (cyt) face of the plasma membrane, while MC2R is clearly outside-oriented (out), with both interacting partially. Images are representative illustrations of at least 100 cells from three separate experiments. Scale bar, 10 μm (a–c) or 2.5 μm for magnifications. Reproduced, with permission, with some modifications from Figures 3 and 7 (636).

Owing to transfections in Cloudman melanoma (M3) cells (375, 522), COS-7 cells (739) or the mutant adrenocortical cell lines Y6 (214) and OS3 (242), the initial structure-activity relationship studies during the 1970s (93, 240) have been validated both for MC1R and MC2R (371, 655). However, even with this significant progress, the properties of MC2R nevertheless remained consistently enigmatic, since in contrast to most GPCRs, difficulties linked to the specific functional expression of MC2R had made it impossible to express MC2R in a system that is free of any endogenous MCR expression
(528, 595). One of the logical hypotheses was the size of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein compared to that of MC2R. Indeed, the C-terminal tail of MC2R is very small, compared to most GPCRs, thus accessibility of its binding pocket may be encumbered by the large size of the MC2R-GFP fusion protein. To circumvent this experimental difficulty, in our laboratory, rather than using GFP, we proceeded to label the N-terminus region of the MC2R cDNA with a small tag, c-Myc. Under these conditions, immunofluorescence studies conducted in unpermeabilized cells clearly established that MC2R could be properly inserted in the cell membrane (375, 635), while MC2R-GFP remained intracellular. Clearly, GFP fusion in the C-terminus region of MC2R impairs trafficking and signaling (594, 635) and thereby confirms that while the C-terminal GFP fusion approach has been used successfully for several other GPCRs, including MC3R, MC4R, and β₂-adrenergic receptors, it does not appear suited for the smallest human GPCR, MC2R (594). However, even if successfully addressed to the plasma membrane, MC2R remains nonfunctional (there is no production of cAMP upon ACTH stimulation), thus suggesting that other partners are likely involved for full functionality of the receptor.

### The role of melanocortin-2 receptor accessory proteins in MC2R expression and functionality

The MRAP was discovered when Metherell et al. (492) performed genetic analysis on a family presenting with familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD). This group identified a small membrane protein that is required for MC2R to reach the plasma membrane. Indeed, MC2R requires the presence of MRAPs for its functional expression. As recently reviewed (162, 324, 430, 738), MRAPs are single-passing membrane proteins which are essential for ACTH signaling since some patients with an intact MC2R, but a mutated MRAP gene, exhibit familial glucocorticoid deficiency (117, 118, 145). To date, two types of MRAPs have been identified, namely MRAP1 and MRAP2. In humans, there are two distinct forms of MRAP1 proteins, isoform MRAPα and MRAPβ (492) along with one MRAP2. MRAPα and MRAPβ share the same N-terminus and transmembrane domains, but are otherwise highly divergent in their C-termini. MRAP1s are involved in trafficking and signaling of MC2R, while MRAP2s appear essentially involved in MC2R trafficking to the plasma membrane (11, 633, 663, 664). With these new tools (cloned hMC2R and MRAPs), we and others have been able to decipher how MC2R is expressed and regulated (375, 636, 637) [for reviews, see (162, 324, 430, 738)]. Using a combination of N-terminal-c-Myc-tagged human MC2R construction (Myc-MC2R) (375) and the Flp recombinase-mediated homologous recombination system in HEK293 cells, we were able to generate isogenic populations expressing both Myc-MC2R with either of the appropriately tagged MRAPα or MRAPβ isoforms. With this model, we discovered that MRAP1 is not essential for MC2R localization at the plasma membrane, but essential for ACTH binding and ACTH-induced cAMP

production. In addition, we have shown that the two human MRAP isoforms (MRAPα and MRAPβ) differentially regulate the expression and functional properties of M2CR (635) (Fig. 11A). Moreover, even if both MRAPβ and hC2R are localized at the cell membrane, they are not colocalized, but rather in close apposition. Immunofluorescence studies and merged images and magnifications (Fig. 11B) reveal that MRAPβ is rather located at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, while MC2R is clearly outside-oriented, with both interacting partially (see magnification in Fig. 11B). Finally, the C-terminal domains of MRAP dictate their intracellular localization in addition to regulating ACTH-induced cAMP production. Of particular interest, the amino acid residues 18 to 21 (LDYL) of MRAP (located in the N-terminal tail) are crucial for ACTH-MC2R ligand recognition and the trafficking of MC2R to the plasma membrane, but not for signaling. These preferential localizations suggest that MRAPα is involved in MC2R targeting to the plasma membrane, while MRAPβ may enhance ACTH-MC2R coupling to cAMP production (636).

#### Regulation of MC2R functionality—desensitization and internalization

For many GPCRs, desensitization is initiated by phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the receptor by a member of the GPCR kinase family. This aspect is not as clearly evidenced for MC2R. Indeed, the regulation of MC2R expression is atypical since, in contrast to many GPCRs, MC2R is known for its capacity for self-controlled upregulation. In bovine fasciculata primary cell cultures, ACTH pretreatment for 48 h induces an increase in cAMP production, mediated by an increase in the number of ACTH-binding sites (569) and in the number of MC2R mRNA transcripts (413, 570). Nevertheless, as in the majority of GPCRs, MC2R is subject to desensitization through a PKA-dependent mechanism (607). Indeed, using hMC2R transfected in the M3 cell line (375) or mouse mc2r transfected in Y1 cells (36, 37), pretreatment with ACTH was shown to induce a dose- and time-dependent loss of cAMP production with maximal desensitization (70% loss of responsiveness) occurring after 15 min of 10 nmol/L ACTH pretreatment. This desensitization was abrogated by treatment with the PKA inhibitor, H89 (36, 37, 375), or by the PKC inhibitor, GF109203X (375). When added together (H89 and GF109203X), receptor responsiveness was raised over maximal human MC2R activity obtained in control cells. These data imply a heterologous PKA-dependent mode of desensitization (36). Moreover, this loss of ACTH responsiveness is accompanied by receptor internalization, reaching maximal levels after 30 min in presence of 10 nmol/L ACTH. Finally, in these experiments, PKA inhibition with H89 abrogated human MC2R sequestration whereas, in contrast, the PKC inhibitor GF109203X did not affect human MC2R internalization. Together, these results indicate that while PKA and PKC act in synergy to induce desensitization, only PKA is essential for receptor internalization (375). In addition, ACTHdesensitizes MC2R at concentrations at which only a fraction of receptors are occupied, suggesting that this mechanism acts on agonist-unoccupied receptors.

Moreover, our group further showed that this internalization is arrestin-, clathrin-, and dynamin-dependent (375, 637). We observed that approximately 28% of internalized receptors are recycled back to the plasma membrane and participate in the total accumulation of cAMP. Moreover, certain intracellular MC2R serine (Ser, S) and threonine (Thr, T) residues were found to play important roles not only in plasma membrane targeting and function, but also in promoting receptor internalization. The modification of MC2R intracellular Ser/Thr residues may positively or negatively regulate its plasma membrane expression as well as the capacity of ACTH to induce cAMP accumulation. Together, the results indicate that mutations of T131, T143, and T147 into either alanine (A) or aspartate (D) have major repercussions on cell-surface expression, cAMP accumulation and/or internalization parameters, pointing mostly to the second intracellular loop as being crucial for MC2R expression and functional regulation (637) (Fig. 12A, B). Molecular identification studies of ACTH ligand selectivity have identified the first transmembrane domain as critical for surface expression while regions from the second to third transmembrane segments are essential for MRAP dependent-signal transduction and ligand specificity (126, 165, 246, 325, 430, 720). From these studies, several models have recently been proposed regarding the interaction between ACTH and its MC2R [for further details, see (126, 371, 430)].

In summary, MC2R is unique due to the following specific properties: (1) ACTH-R (MC2R) is the smallest GPCR known to date. Consequently, certain sites that are instrumental for activation and regulation contained in most GPCRs are not present in MC2R; (2) it only binds ACTH, not the other MSH peptides; and (3) biological activity (cAMP) is obtained only when MRAP is expressed along with the ACTH receptor (whereas MSH binding to the other MCs do not have this requirement). Thus, MC1R, MC4R, MC3R are considered as the « α-MSH receptor » and MC2R the « ACTH receptor ». The ability of α-MSH to bind and stimulate cAMP production relies on the short amino acid sequence 6 to 9 (HFRW). In the case of ACTH binding to MC2R, not only is the additional sequence 15 to 18 (KKRR) required, but also the presence of the accessory protein MRAP.

sequence, located in position 15-18 (KKRR sequence) (Lys¹⁵-Lys¹⁶-Arg¹⁷-Arg¹⁸) is essential for the binding of ACTH to its receptor. In the case of ACTH, the first sequence HFRW has been named “message,” while the second sequence, KKRR, is termed “address” [for review see (200, 661)] (Fig. 10B). To better understand the role of the amino acids HFRW, various fragments have been generated and compared in terms of potency to stimulate steroidogenesis and cyclic AMP. In spite of extensive studies, results have yet to be consistent. Indeed, while the former studies have shown that the ACTH fragment 1 to 16 is without activity (200, 661), more recent studies, using MC2R transfected in an adrenocortical cell line (OS3) indicate that ACTH (1-16) is the minimal peptide required for ACTH binding and signaling, although 50% less potent than ACTH (1-39) (Fig. 13A and B) (126). Structural modifications in which the Trp⁹ is substituted for Phe⁹ provide ACTH analogs that exhibit high affinity for the ACTH receptor but fail to activate the adenylate cyclase system, indicating that affinity for the receptor alone is not sufficient for expression of hormonal activity (331). In addition, certain fragments not only lack activity, but act as competitive antagonists of the effect of full length ACTH, as is the case for ACTH (11-24) (Fig. 13C and D) or ACTH (7-38) (Fig. 13E). However, large quantities of these fragments are required to observe inhibition (371, 665). Due to its antagonistic activity, ACTH (7-38) has accordingly been called corticotropin-inhibiting peptide (CIP) (427) However, in another study (696), ACTH (11-24) has been reported to potentiate the effect of ACTH (1-39) [for review see (200, 361, 661)]. Finally, using various drugs inhibiting or stimulating calcium influx or the activation of adenyllyl cyclase activity, studies have suggested that ACTH (1-10) elicits steroidogenesis via calcium and ACTH (11-24) via cAMP (429). In accordance with these biological responses, it was initially proposed that ACTH (1-39) could act via two receptors, with one class of receptors recognizing ACTH (1-10) and the other class recognizing ACTH (11-24) (429). However, subsequent cloning of the ACTH-R has provided evidence that this is not the case.

### An example of patient-driven clinical research—from bedside-to bench and from bench-to-bedside

A 4-year-old girl and a 4-month-old boy presented with hypoglycemia, normal electrolytes, low cortisol and high ACTH. A diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency was made and initial treatment was conducted with gluco- and mineralocorticoids. The genes known to cause ACTH resistance were normal. Whole exome sequencing revealed that the girl was heterozygous for POMC mutations (one previously described null allele and one novel p.R8C mutation in the sequence encoding ACTH and α-MSH), while the boy was homozygous for the p.R8C mutation. Synthesis of the ACTH peptide mutant (ACTH-R8C) was performed and used to compare its functionality with that of native ACTH (1-39) and ACTH (1-24). ACTH-R8C was found to be immunoreactive,

### Structure-activity relationships of ACTH-related peptides

Of particular interest, all of the melanocortin peptides (ACTH, α-MSH, β-MSH, γ-MSH, and β-lipotropin) possess a core tetrapeptide HFRW sequence (amino acids 6-9) (His⁶-Phe⁷-Arg⁸-Trp⁹) which is crucial for receptor stimulation and molecular recognition [reviewed in (200, 361, 661)]. To make a long story short, studies during the 1970 to 1980s have provided evidence that the HFRW sequence is essential for binding and cAMP production by α-MSH, while another

As illustrated, mutations of T131, T143, and T147 into either A or D have major repercussions on cAMP accumulation and MC2R functional expression. Indeed, cell surface expression of these mutants are either drastically impaired (for T131) or abrogated (for T143 and T147) [thus, not illustrated in panel (d)]. These results point mostly to the second intracellular loop as being crucial for MC2R expression and functional regulation. Reproduced, with permission, from Figure 5 (253).

but failed to bind and activate cAMP production in MC2R-expressing cells while α-MSH-R8C failed to bind and stimulate cAMP production in MC1- and MC4-expressing cells. These are the first documented cases of glucocorticoid deficiency due to the secretion of an ACTH molecule which lacks biological bioactivity but conserves immunoreactivity. Establishing the molecular etiology of the disorder in our patients allowed cessation of unnecessary mineralocorticoids. Finally, discovery of this mutation indicates that, in humans, the amino acid sequence His⁶Phe⁷Arg⁸Trp⁹ (HFRW) is important not only for cAMP activation, but also for ACTH binding to MC2R (647). These above findings and repercussions represent a real-life case of personalized medicine made possible today through the use of novel techniques in

A significant increase in cAMP can be observed with ACTH (1-39) and ACTH (1-24), both used at the concentration of 100 nmol/L. The concentration of ACTH (11-24) was \(10 \mu\)mol/L; that of ACTH (1-10) and ACTH (11-24) was \(100 \mu\)mol/L.

genomics, combined with cell biology and medicinal pharmacology.

**Regulation of cAMP production and interaction with calcium**

The initial and most significant actions of ACTH are mediated through cAMP and subsequent activation of PKA. Pioneer studies have established that following stimulation by a concentration of ACTH approximating the threshold for corticosterone production, an increase in cyclic AMP is observed which is very well correlated with both steroidogenesis and ACTH concentrations. In addition, full occupancy of the receptors is not necessary for maximal steroidogenesis (249, 584, 645). The role of cAMP in ACTH action has been confirmed thanks to the Y1 adrenocortical tumor cell mutants, Kin-7 and Kin-8. These cells harbor point mutations in the regulatory subunit of the type 1 cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMPdPK) which render the enzyme resistant to activation by cAMP. When these Kin mutants are transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type subunits of cAMPdPK, cAMP-responsive protein kinase activity is restored (749). Such results illustrate the causal relationships between mutations in cAMPdPK

Figure 14 Role of adenylyl cyclases (ACs), phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and phosphatases (PTPs) in ACTH signaling. According to the data published to date, ACTH putatively stimulates AC5/AC6 isoforms which, through cAMP and PKA, activate a slow but sustained Ca²⁺ influx through L-type channels. Calcium and cAMP interact closely through positive feedback loops to enhance steroid secretion. Thereafter, Ca²⁺ activates the AC3 isoform. Studies have also shown that cAMP can bind cAMP-GEFs which activate the exchange factors, thereby allowing Epac1 and Epac2 to catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP on Rap GTPases. The GTP-bound forms of Rap activate multiple cellular functions, including ERK1/2 and ionic channels (green pathway). Moreover, pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment indicates that ACTH is not only linked to Gₛ, but also to Gᵢ protein. Activation of αₛ contributes to the inactivation of the AC3 isoform, although the release of βγ can also activate the AC2 isoform. Meanwhile, βγ-subunits may stimulate other effectors such as phospholipase Cβ3 isoform, MAPK cascade or cationic Cl⁻ channels. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) degrade cAMP in such a way that they can precisely control the level of intracellular cAMP. In adrenocortical cells, several isoforms of PDE have been described. In particular, ACTH induces a rapid, but transient inhibition of PDE2, thus maintaining elevated cAMP levels. In fasciculata cells, the PDE8 family is also shown to modulate the cAMP pool under basal to minimally stimulated conditions. When cAMP is more highly stimulated, other IBMX-sensitive PDEs are activated to restore the basal level of cAMP (purple pathway). On the other hand, PKA leads to activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) with the subsequent dephosphorylation of specific substrate(s) (still unknown). These proteins potentially directly or indirectly control the induction of an acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS4), a key enzyme in the stimulation of steroidogenesis. This ACS4 sequesters arachidonic acid (AA) as arachidonoyl-CoA (AA-CoA). The action of a specific thioesterase, Acot2, allows the release of AA in a specific compartment of the cells. Free AA acts as an inducer of StAR protein and steroidogenesis (pink pathway). AA can also be released from a direct effect of ACTH on PLA₂ (blue pathway). Finally, studies have shown that ACTH is able to stimulate phosphoinositide breakdown; however, the production of inositol trisphosphate induced by ACTH is not sufficient to release calcium from intracellular stores, rather suggesting a role for diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC) (gray pathway).

and resistance to ACTH and cAMP [for reviews, see (118, 243, 261, 597, 669, 670)].

In addition to the rapid stimulation of cAMP and PKA activation, ACTH induces calcium influx in zona glomerulosa cells which, in interaction with cAMP, stimulates P450aldo and aldosterone secretion (88, 235, 257, 260, 332, 385) [for review, see (261, 310, 667, 668)]. There is also a number of PKA-independent effects of cAMP, including involvement of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) (84) or cAMP-induced activation of calmodulin kinase (CaMK), which mediates a PKA-independent increase in aldosterone production (264) [reviewed in (310)]. In particular, as documented by many studies, ACTH action also involves calcium (Ca²⁺) and other signaling molecules, as summarized in Figure 14. It is now well-accepted that: (1) Calcium alone can stimulate steroid secretion (105, 524) without detectable changes in cAMP; (2) ACTH at low concentrations stimulates calcium influx and steroid secretion (105, 257, 260, 384-386, 652, 754, 755); (3) ACTH, but not forskolin (a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase), increases calcium influx into glomerulosa cells. Likewise, BAY K 8644 (a calcium influx agonist, more specifically through L-type calcium channels) (see Table 3 for details on ionic channel nomenclature and properties) induces an increase in calcium

influx comparable to that of ACTH and potentiates the effect of forskolin (234, 386, 451); (4) when added in combination with forskolin, calcium reproduces the action of ACTH (386); (5) calcium enhances the effect of ACTH on cAMP production (650); and (6) stimulation of aldosterone by ACTH is completely inhibited by verapamil (an L-type calcium channel blocker). As summarized in the studies of Kojima et al. (384-386) and Gallo-Payet et al. (257, 260, 261), cAMP and Ca2+ ion operate as dual second messengers for inducing full steroidogenic responses. From these observations,

Volume 4, July 2014

calcium has been considered as a “second” (755) or “third” second messenger (652) in ACTH action. The site at which calcium acts may likewise be at the level of ACTH binding to its receptor (124), at the level of Gs activation of adenylyl cyclase (455, 650) as well as in the activation of the StAR protein (132, 133).

Steroidogenesis in the zona glomerulosa is much more sensitive to external calcium (Ca²⁺) than the inner portion of the cortex (zona fasciculata and reticularis) (679). One study has shown that extracellular Ca²⁺ is required for cAMP-stimulated aldosterone secretion, whereas cAMP-stimulated corticosterone by the rat zona fasciculata is likely not dependent on extracellular Ca²⁺ (652). In human glomerulosa cells, in the absence of extracellular Ca²⁺, both cAMP production and aldosterone secretion are abolished despite binding of ACTH to its receptor (257). However, bovine fasciculata cells exhibit similar sensitivity to Ca²⁺ as zona glomerulosa cells. Specifically, ACTH and O-nitrophenyl sulfenyl-ACTH (NPS-ACTH) (an analog which does not increase cAMP) increase intracellular Ca²⁺ and stimulate cortisol synthesis by bovine zona fasciculata cells at concentrations that produce little or no increase in cAMP synthesis (432, 505, 754). Of particular interest, when a tryptophan residue is substituted with o-nitrophenyl sulfenyl chloride in ACTH, this analog (NPS-ACTH) stimulates rat, mouse, and bovine adrenal steroidogenesis without detectable increases in cellular cAMP level. However, the dose required for maximal stimulation is several hundred times higher than that for ACTH. Since cAMP is considered to be an essential mediator of ACTH action, this analog represents a valuable and interesting tool to discriminate between cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent effects of ACTH (754).

transfection of one of the mutant clones with expression vectors encoding either Gβ together with Gγ has been found to increase ACTH receptor expression and restore ACTH-responsive adenylyl cyclase activity (588).

These results suggest that, at least in the human adrenal gland, ACTH can induce a sustained cAMP increase through sequential activation of various isoforms of adenylyl cyclases, namely calcium-independent (AC5/AC6), followed by calcium influx-dependent (AC3) and finally Giβγ protein (AC2/AC4) isoforms [see Fig. 9 from (166) (166)] and that the increase in intracellular calcium (Caᵢ) occurs as a result of cAMP production. These hypotheses are in agreement with the observation that steroidogenesis sensitivity to calcium channel blockers is partial, with a decrease of approximately 30%, indicating that calcium has a permissive, but not essential role in steroid secretion (6). The mechanism by which calcium influx is regulated will be addressed in further detail in a subsequent section. Moreover, additive and time-dependent increases in cAMP production may explain why ACTH is the most potent stimulus of cAMP production, with a stimulating ratio ranging from a 20- to 40-fold increase over basal values, compared to a 2- to 5-fold increase seen with other stimuli which utilize cAMP as second messenger (adrenalin, serotonin) (261).

### From cAMP to multiple signaling pathways—second wave of signaling for ACTH

As shown in Figure 14, a number of other signaling pathways have been described. In addition, the level of intracellular cAMP is modulated by several types of intracellular kinases, phosphatases, and PDEs. The following text is a summary of several original publications and reviews (57, 159, 160, 281, 458, 714).

#### Regulation of cAMP production by adenylyl cyclase isoforms and Gi coupling

Duration and potency of cAMP production can be modulated by several isoforms of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (261, 714). In many, if not all mammalian cells, cAMP production and accumulation is regulated by a balance between AC activation through the GTP-binding protein Gs and inhibition through the GTP-binding Gi inhibitory protein. Several experimental results have indicated that the αi and βγ subunits of the Gi protein are involved in ACTH action. Human and rat adrenal glands express several isoforms of adenylyl cyclases: the calcium-insensitive isoforms AC5/AC6, the calcium-sensitive isoforms AC1 and AC3 as well as the βγ-sensitive isoforms AC2 and AC4 (166, 676) [for review see (307)]. Physiological variations (such as an increase in ACTH secretion or a sodium-deficient diet) are able to modulate the expression of certain specific AC isoforms (676). In Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells, AC4 is the preferred target of forskolin action (588, 638). Impairment in the βγ-subunits of Gi protein is responsible for the loss of ACTH receptor gene expression and ACTH-responsive adenylyl cyclase activity (AC4 isoform). Conversely,

#### The role of phosphodiesterases

The level of intracellular cAMP is determined by its rates of synthesis by adenylate cyclases and degradation by PDEs, (generating 5′ adenosine monophosphate) (AMP) [for review, see (57, 159, 714)]. In mammals, there are 11 families of PDEs, with each family having its own and unique kinetic properties, regulatory partners as well as inhibitor sensitivity (57, 159). The cGMP-PDE2 is the predominant isoform of PDEs present in the adrenal cortex (682), with the highest concentrations found in the zona glomerulosa (453) at least in bovine (302). In the absence of IBMX (a nonspecific inhibitor of cAMP and cGMP PDEs), the maximal effect of ACTH on cAMP production occurs after 15 min followed by a return to basal levels, even in the continuous presence of ACTH. Cell incubation with various PDE inhibitors, followed by time-course studies of ACTH-induced cAMP production, indicate that ACTH decreases PDE2 activity (which partially explains the sustained cAMP response), then stimulates another PDE to end the hormonal response (169). By comparison, results indicate that PDE3 and PDE4 are poorly or not involved in the regulation of ACTH-induced intracellular cAMP (169).
The second important PDE which modulates at least corticos-  
terone secretion in adrenal fasciculata cells is PDE8. In mice,  
treatment with a PDE8-selective inhibitor alone is sufficient to  
increase basal steroid secretion (715). Mechanistically, acute  
inhibition of PDE8 increases the phosphorylation states of  
many PKA substrates including HSL (715). Both PDE2 and  
PDE8B modulate steroidogenesis predominantly under low  
cAMP conditions. Additional IBMX-sensitive PDEs become  
increasingly important when cAMP levels are raised. Taken  
together, these findings suggest that several PDEs regulate one  
or more pools of cAMP which in turn control steroidogenesis  
[for review, see (261, 714)]. In support of the role of PDEs  
in adrenal gland physiology are the observations that muta-  
tions in PDE8B or in PDE11A appear to be associated with  
adrenal gland diseases (such as adrenal hyperplasia and Cush-  
ing's syndrome) (345, 346) or in patients with polycystic ovary  
syndrome (PCOS) (125), a disease characterized by increased  
androgen production by adrenal and ovarian theca cells. How-  
ever, the mechanism by which alteration of PDE8A may con-  
tribute to the manifestation of PCOS remains unclear (125).

### The role of cGMP

In the adrenal gland, the level of cGMP is often linked to PDE  
activity, including PDE2, PDE3 and PDE5 (302, 453, 682).  
Cyclic GMP is the main effector of atrial natriuretic factor  
(ANF), which is known to inhibit steroid secretion (mainly  
aldosterone secretion) (187, 265). In bovine zona fasciculata,  
cGMP is increased in cells exposed to low concentrations of  
ACTH (between 0.1 pmol/L to 0.1 nmol/L) (516), followed  
by a return to basal values or lower at concentrations higher  
than 0.1 nmol/L. In the same concentration range, cAMP pro-  
duction is stimulated in a dose-dependent manner. However,  
using rat zona glomerulosa, we observed that ACTH, at con-  
centrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 nmol/L, induced a rapid and  
strong time-dependent decrease in cGMP content, corrobo-  
rating previous studies (215, 469), also using zona glomeru-  
losa cells. This important discrepancy observed between zona  
glomerulosa and zona fasciculata cells may be due to the high  
expression of PDE2 found in the glomerulosa comparatively  
to the fasciculata (682) which, upon stimulation, may favor  
hydrolyzation of more cGMP.

### Beyond cAMP: metabolites of cAMP

Elucidating the signaling pathways by which ACTH and  
cAMP function in the adrenal cortex has been facilitated by  
the discovery of cAMP derivatives that, at appropriate con-  
centrations, selectively activate exchange proteins directly  
activated by cAMP (Epacs) or PKA (338). These deriva-  
tives have been used to study the role of cAMP-dependent  
and cAMP-independent regulation of cell function. Recently,  
two cAMP-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factors,  
exchange protein activated by cAMP 1 (Epac1) and 2 (Epac2)  
(also known as cAMP-GEF1 and cAMP-GEF2), both of  

which activate Rap1 and Rap2 GTPases, have been iden-  
tified, with Epac2 robustly expressed in the adrenal cortex  
(84, 432, 433). Epac proteins regulate a variety of cellular  
processes by mechanisms that include modulation of gene  
transcription (84). Using various cAMP derivatives that selec-  
tively activate Epacs and PKA, Enyeart et al. observed that the  
most widely used of these Epac-selective cAMP analogs, 8-  
(4-chlorophenylthio) (8CPT)-2′-OMe-cAMP, stimulated the  
expression of steroid hydroxylase mRNAs and cortisol secre-  
tion (221). However, these effects were mediated indirectly by  
one or more metabolites of the parent compound by a cAMP-,  
PKA- and Epac-independent mechanism. These metabolites  
included 5′-AMP, adenosine, and adenosine derivatives of the  
parent compound (221). There are currently no studies on  
Epac documented in zona glomerulosa cells.

#### Inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol

The earliest studies suggesting that ACTH initiates phos-  
phatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtIns(4,5)P2) hydrolysis  
were carried out in bovine zona fasciculata (71, 235, 236) and  
zona glomerulosa cells (260). This breakdown is involved  
in aldosterone secretion, since preincubation with the phos-  
pholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 significantly decreases  
ACTH-induced aldosterone secretion (260). However, the  
production of inositol trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) induced  
by ACTH is not sufficient to release calcium from intracellu-  
lar stores, rather suggesting a role for diacylglycerol (DAG)  
and protein kinase C (PKC) (173, 174). The slow increase in  
InsPs suggests that the coupling protein between the ACTH  
receptor and phospholipase C (PLC) is not Gq, but rather  
Gi via the βγ subunits. Several lines of evidence (pertussis  
toxin treatment, incubation with βγ subunits) indeed demon-  
strate that one portion of ACTH action is mediated through  
a Gi protein (140, 166), since pertussis toxin treatment ADP-  
ribosylates and thus blocks the αi-subunit of Gi protein.

#### The role of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites

ACTH stimulation induces a dose- and time-dependent  
release of arachidonic acid (AA) and, conversely, inhibi-  
tion of AA release abrogates the effect of ACTH on  
steroid production. The release of AA from intracellular  
stores occurs either from the activation of phospholipase  
A2 (PLA2) or following ACTH-induced activation of phos-  
phatases (103, 160, 281, 459, 753) (Fig. 14). AA and its  
lipoxygenase-catalyzed products affect steroidogenesis at  
a point between cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation  
and the rate limiting step of steroidogenesis, namely the  
metabolism of cholesterol to pregnenolone (458). However,  
its mechanism and role have only been recently described.  
Two enzymes are involved, an acyl-CoA synthetase (called  
ACS4) and a mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase, called AA-  
related thioesterase involved in steroidogenesis (ARTIST; also  
known as mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase or MTE-1).  
While ARTIST is activated by phosphorylation and substrate  availability, ACS4 is rapidly induced following hormonal treatment (164) (Fig. 14). ACS4 is detected in abundance in the zona fasciculata, with virtually no labeling in the zona glomerulosa (370). Maloberti et al. (458) demonstrated that 20–30% of total steroid production can be elicited without the need for StAR synthesis. The authors proposed that AA metabolites (AA-CoA) closely interact with TSPO located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (398, 624), potentially leading to the facilitation of the transfer of AA-CoA into the mitochondria. For further details and future challenges raised by these results, readers are invited to consult two recent reviews on this topic (160, 458).

### The role of tyrosine phosphatases in steroidogenic cells: regulation and function

The phospho-dephosphorylation of intermediate proteins is a key event in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis and on cytoskeleton-associated proteins, which integrate cell shape/morphology with cell function. In fact, morphological and functional responses to activation of the PKA-signaling pathway in steroidogenic cells are intimately linked and mediated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) activity (160, 281). Briefly, studies suggest that ACTH induces a rapid and transient stimulation in total PTP activity in adrenal zona fasciculata. This increase is accompanied with a decrease in the phosphotyrosine level of several proteins. Indeed, treatment with PTP inhibitors reduces hormone- or cAMP-induced stimulation of steroid biosynthesis. Classical PTPs are able to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues and dual-specificity phosphatases which act on phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues. Important members of the dual-specificity phosphatase group include phosphatases acting on the regulation of MAP kinases, a signaling pathway involved in steroidogenesis (160). From the extensive results obtained by Ernesto Podesta and colleagues, a model establishing a link between steroid production and the sequential action of PTPs, ACS4, and StAR proteins has been proposed (Fig. 14). In this model, it is postulated that the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 may be the substrate of several different kinases to become Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphorylated (160, 161). SHP2 itself is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to cell stimulation by a number of different growth factors, including ACTH, also leading to its activation (160, 620). Moreover, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of SHP2 results in a dramatic stimulation of phosphatase activity (620). One remaining unanswered question is whether SHP2 is also phosphorylated by a cAMP-independent pathway in steroidogenic tissues.

### The role of MAPK activity

A role for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in the action of ACTH has also been suggested. This family of proteins includes the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1/2 (p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup>), the p38 MAPKs and the p54 stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (348). These three main MAPKs can be activated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) (368, 462, 582). A common feature of MAP kinases is the requirement of dual threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation to display maximal activity (462, 582). In bovine and rat adrenocortical cells, Chabre et al. (112) as well as Gallo-Payet et al. (255) have shown that ACTH does not stimulate p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> activity under conditions where Ang II is effective. These latter findings are in agreement with prior observations in which p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> immunoreactivity was distributed throughout the zona glomerulosa (and in the medulla), but was not detectable (at least in basal conditions) in the zona fasciculata and reticularis. However, under ACTH stimulation, ERK1 (p44<sup>mapk</sup>), but not ERK2 (p42<sup>mapk</sup>), was increased in zona glomerulosa, but not in the inner zones (486). In another study, Watanabe et al. (736) rather observed an increase in JNK activity, whereas p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> phosphorylation was inhibited in response to ACTH, both in the adrenal cortex *in vivo* and in the Y1 adrenocortical cell line. Interestingly, Watanabe et al. (736) also observed that a phorbol ester (12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), but not cAMP, induced JNK activity in Y1 cells. The protein kinase inhibitor H-89 blocked ACTH induction of JNK activity at inhibitory doses for PKC, but not for PKA. The calcium chelating agent EGTA inhibited, while the calcium ionophore A23187 induced ACTH-stimulated JNK activity by 3-fold. In these studies, ACTH inhibited ERK activity both *in vivo* and in Y1 adrenal cells. Together these findings suggest that ACTH induces JNK activity through a PKC- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway. The inhibition of ERK activity by ACTH may contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis induced by ACTH, while the stimulation of JNK may be correlated with the increase in cell hypertrophy (261, 478). On the other hand, in the Y1 adrenocortical cell line and in MC2R-transfected HEK293 cells (634), ACTH has been shown to activate the p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> pathway (437, 736) and SAPK/JNKs (243, 736). In this context, Lotfi et al. (438) documented that ACTH itself is in fact a weak mitogen and a poor activator of p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup>. Their results suggest that the effects of ACTH on p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> are due to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors and that signals initiated by FGF2 and ACTH receptors converge to the induction of *c-fos* and *c-jun* genes to ultimately trigger stimulation of DNA synthesis (437). Inhibitors of MEK block both FGF2 and ACTH signaling pathways in Y1 cells (35, 412, 473, 707). The exact molecular cross-talk between G-protein coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways is not fully understood and likely involves other protein kinase cascades or intermediary scaffolds such as Epac or the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) (see subsequent section on integrative signaling pathways).

#### Role of Janus kinase 2 /signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling

A role of this pathway in the adrenal cortex has often been suggested, although in fact, not clearly documented [for
review, see (683)]. Recent studies by Lefrancois-Martinez et al. (417) have revealed that JAK2 is essential in both basal and ACTH/cAMP-induced steroidogenesis. Indeed, pharmacological or siRNA-mediated inhibition of JAK2 impairs both basal and ACTH/cAMP-induced steroidogenesis, thus indicating an essential role of JAK2 in steroidogenesis. Nuclear JAK2 regulates the level of active transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), through tyrosine phosphorylation and prevention of proteasomal degradation, which in turn leads to transcriptional activation of the rate-limiting steroidogenic *Star* gene (417).

### Conclusion

In summary, although several mediators have been identified, cAMP remains the main second messenger involved in ACTH action, and PKA remains the most important kinase stimulated by this hormone. However, ACTH potency in response to various physiological stimuli results from the capacity of the cell to produce more or less cAMP and to activate various intracellular kinases and phosphatases, acting to potentiate, activate or inhibit the intracellular targets necessary to trigger steroid secretion. Thus, following binding to its MC2R, ACTH activates (through various adenylyl cyclases) cAMP production, as well as Ca²⁺ influx (through various types of channels). Various PDEs control the intensity of PKA activation while different serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatases control the activation of the various P450 and 3β-HSD enzymes to trigger steroid release. Finally PKA and Ca²⁺ activate transcription factors targeted at modulating the synthesis of the enzymes. In addition, one of the immediate effects of ACTH is the rounded-up appearance of the cells, due to a rapid reorganization in their cytoskeleton, mainly F-actin (261). These changes are initiated at the membrane level, in close association with cell environment. Indeed, the cell’s response to ACTH (secretion, but also migration and cell survival) varies according to the nature of the surrounding cell matrix. How exactly does the extracellular matrix and its integrin receptors interact with the cytoskeleton and intracellular kinases to modulate cell function will be explored in a subsequent section.

### Roles and Mechanisms of Angiotensin II (Ang II) in the Adrenal Cortex

In vivo, Ang II is the main stimulus of both aldosterone secretion and morphology of the zona glomerulosa (202, 486, 508, 724, 725). Even though calcium is an important stimulus of aldosterone secretion, several other second messengers play a strategic role in the acute and sustained regulation of aldosterone secretion by Ang II (627, 631, 683). On the other hand, the effects of Ang II on growth rather involve the MAPK pathways (112, 486, 540, 544, 545, 705) (Fig. 15A). These actions are mediated mainly, if not all, through the AT₁ receptor

subtype of Ang II (202, 203, 540, 546). The following text is largely inspired from several important publications and reviews (22, 23, 355, 356, 487, 619).

#### Ang II and Ang II receptors in the adrenal gland – general properties and signaling

##### Receptor expression

Ang II is the end product of the renin-angiotensin-system. In the classical view, upon stimulation, renin released in the circulation (from the kidney) cleaves angiotensinogen (from the liver) to produce an inactive peptide, angiotensin I, which is further cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme into the biologically active peptide, Ang II. As in many tissues, the zona glomerulosa contains a full endogenous renin-angiotensin-system (507, 578, 727). Classically, Ang II mediates its action via two major receptors, namely the Ang II type-1 receptor (AT₁R) and type-2 receptor (AT₂R). In the rat adrenal gland, AT₁R is expressed abundantly and almost exclusively in the zona glomerulosa. In certain animal species, such as in bovine (106, 547, 717) and human adrenal glands (91, 294), AT₁R is also expressed in the zona fasciculata, where it stimulates cortisol secretion (188, 294). The classical actions mediated by the AT₁R are the regulation of aldosterone secretion and the regulation of blood pressure and hydro-mineral balance. However, long-term Ang II-induced AT₁R activation plays a well-documented role in inflammation, oxidative stress and cardiovascular diseases (279, 424, 740). In contrast, the AT₂R is abundant in fetal tissues, particularly in adrenal gland, kidney and brain (9, 674), after which its expression drops rapidly after birth (91, 659, 748). In the adult, AT₂R remains abundant only in steroidogenic tissues, including the adrenal gland (91, 576, 577), ovary and selected brain areas. In the adrenal gland, both AT₁ and AT₂ receptors are present in adrenal zona glomerulosa, with a ratio varying from 60% (AT₁R)/40% (AT₂R) (447) to 80–90% (AT₁R)/10–20% (AT₂R) (3, 138, 245, 425, 547, 576, 577). In contrast, the adrenal medulla contains mainly AT₂R (91, 245, 447). Activation of AT₂R by Ang II decreases cell proliferation, increases cell apoptosis and induces cellular differentiation. It is generally assumed that AT₂R counteracts the effects of AT₁R, thus improving AT₁R-induced pathological situations [for review, see (186, 263, 686)].

##### Receptor properties, signaling and regulation

The AT₁R is comprised of 359 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 40 kDa and belongs to the superfamily of seven-membrane spanning heptahelical GPCRs. In rats, two isoforms that share 95% amino acid sequence homology have been identified: the AT₁AR and the AT₁BR. In the adrenal gland, both AT₁A and AT₁B mRNA have been detected in the zona glomerulosa (673). In vivo experiments conducted in conditions of sodium deficiency have shown that only AT₁AR mRNA levels are increased in both kidney and adrenal gland (362). No specific differential role has been assigned for these

Figure 15 G protein-dependent (A) and G protein-independent (B) signaling pathways induced by Ang II binding to AT₁R in adrenal zona glomerulosa. (A) The G protein-dependent “first wave of signaling,” which includes immediate and secondary responses. Ang II binding to the AT₁R in the adrenal zona glomerulosa induces an immediate coupling to Gαq, resulting in activation of phospholipase C-β1 (PLC). The latter catalyzes the breakdown of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) into inositol triphosphate (InsP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which, respectively, act to increase cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations and activate PKC (pink pathway). In a more or less simultaneous manner, Ang II induces cell depolarization, inhibiting voltage-dependent potassium (K⁺) channels, which triggers activation of T- and L-voltage-dependent calcium (Ca²⁺) channels. In the cytoplasm, Ca²⁺ activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I/II (Ca²⁺-CaM kinase) (orange pathway). As secondary G-dependent pathways, Ang II also activates phospholipase D (PLD), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidic acid (PA), which can be metabolized to DAG by lipid phosphate phosphatases. Finally, as in the case of ACTH, Ang II can activate a PLA₂ which generates the release of arachidonic acid (AA) (blue pathways). DAG activates various PKC isoforms as well as protein kinase D (PKD). These mediators, in particular PKC, can then activate the extracellular (Continued)
two isoforms. However, it is generally believed that the AT₁R isoform may be more important than AT₂R in the regulation of aldosterone secretion (734).

Following Ang II binding to AT₁R, signaling can be separated into G protein-dependent signaling (called the first wave of signaling) and G protein-independent signaling (called second wave of signaling). The first wave is initiated by the coupling of Gq/11 to the phospholipase C (PLC)/phosphoinositide (PtIns) breakdown pathway (355, 683) and can be further subdivided into immediate and secondary responses (Fig. 15A), where several cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are activated (such as Pyk2, c-Src, Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and JAK2). The secondary responses and second wave of signaling are typically associated with stimulation of growth factor receptors, known to regulate cell growth, proliferation, cell migration, apoptosis, gene expression as well as extracellular matrix rearrangement. These effects are often the consequence of Ang II-induced recruitment of scaffold proteins and activation of key kinase cascades (355, 604, 728, 742). The temporal and spatial patterns of signaling activation are important determinants of a particular functional response. For example, activation of the G protein-dependent pathway occurs in seconds, while MAP kinase and JAK/STAT activation occurs in minutes to hours after initial activation of AT₁R. Furthermore, differences in receptor/ligand affinity, alterations in trafficking patterns, AT₁R structural modifications and local tissue environment all appear to play a role in the ultimate effects of Ang II signaling (487) [for review, see (355)] (Fig. 15B).

As for many GPCRs, several studies have documented that Ang II stimulation in adrenocortical cells is accompanied by desensitization and internalization (311, 546, 568). This process corresponds to a shift from a high to a low affinity state of AT₁R (86). Internalization of the AT₁R occurs predominantly by endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits. The mechanisms involved in the adrenal cortex have not been investigated as thoroughly as in other tissues. However, there is evidence suggesting that the process may be qualified as classical for a class B GPCR [for details, see (75)]. The process is dynamin- and β-arrestins-dependent and is critical for at least three reasons: (i) it provides the switch from G protein-dependent to G protein-independent signaling; (ii) it regulates the number of available cell surface receptors and (iii) it facilitates resensitization of plasma membrane

receptors that have been desensitized by GPCR kinase [for further details on internalization and recycling, readers are invited to consult the numerous reviews in the field (355, 704)]. It is important to point out that the signaling mechanisms of the AT₂R are quite different. The AT₂R does not activate conventional GPCR signaling pathways but rather exerts antigrowth and proapoptotic effects. In many systems, its actions are opposite to those mediated by the AT₁R (263, 529).

### Acute effects of Ang II on aldosterone secretion – the first wave of signaling

#### G protein-dependent pathways

The acute effects of Ang II in the control of aldosterone secretion is mediated through AT₁R activation of the phospholipase Cβ isoform (PLCβ) via a Gq/11 type G protein, leading to phosphoinositides (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) breakdown and subsequent production of inositol phosphates (InsPs) [mainly inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (InsP3)] and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) (39, 292). The resulting increase in intracellular calcium (Caᵢ), calcium (Ca²⁺) influx and protein kinase C (PKC) activation are responsible for the stimulation of aldosterone synthesis and secretion (384) [for review, see (355, 683)]. These second messengers could be considered as the primary wave of signaling (Fig. 15A).

#### Increase in intracellular calcium (Caᵢ) and activation of Ca²⁺-calmodulin kinase (Ca²⁺-CaMK)

As described in many studies, the initial increase in Caᵢ is responsible for the immediate phase of aldosterone secretion, while the more sustained increase in secretion is dependent on membrane depolarization and activation of T- and L-type Ca²⁺ channels (developed in a following section) [for review, see (629, 683)]. InsP₃ is thought to initiate aldosterone secretion by eliciting a transient increase in cytosolic calcium concentration and by activating CaMK (105, 128, 386, 387, 593, 629). CaMK-I phosphorylates and activates a number of steroidogenic transcription factors leading to increased transcription of CYP11B2 [for review, see (310)]. However, since inhibitors of calmodulin and CaMK cannot completely block Ang II stimulation of CYP11B2 (579), other signaling mechanisms

Figure 15 (Continued) signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). DAG can be hydrolyzed by DAG lipase to release arachidonic acid (AA), which can be further metabolized by 12-lipoxygenase to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) (blue pathway). Likewise to ACTH, various protein tyrosine phosphatases are also involved in Ang II action. These proteins can directly or indirectly control the induction of an acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS4), a key enzyme in the stimulation of steroidogenesis. This ACS4 sequesters arachidonic acid (AA) as arachidonyl-CoA (AA-CoA). The action of a specific thioesterase, Acot2, allows the release of AA in a specific compartment of the cells. Free AA acts as an inducer of StAR protein and steroidogenesis. (B) G protein-independent “second wave of signaling,” which includes secondary as well as chronic responses to Ang II. Firstly, as illustrated in the left portion of the figure (illustrated in purple), AT₁R induces activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Secondly, Ang II can induce signaling pathways leading to ERK1/2, either through various PKC isoforms, generated from PLD activation (illustrated in blue), Src, extracellular matrix/cytoskeleton [in particular the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin (PAX)] or through AT₁R-mediated transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR. In addition, AT₁R desensitization (induced by cytoplasmic serine/threonine phosphorylation of AT₁R) enhances binding of β-arrestin to the cytoplasmic tail of AT₁R to inhibit Gαq coupling to AT₁R. β-arrestin serves as a scaffold for signaling effectors such as Src, resulting in downstream activation of cytoplasmic ERK. All these signaling cascades lead to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which includes extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 isoforms (right portion of the figure, shown in green).are also likely involved (683). A more in-depth description of the mechanism by which Ang II increases $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ and calcium influx will be detailed in the section related to the role of ion channels in adrenal cortical function.

### Role of diacylglycerol and protein kinase C
The role of DAG-induced PKC stimulation in acute aldosterone secretion is far from being fully established. Several reports have shown that mimicking PKC and calcium influx with pharmacological agents essentially reproduces Ang II-induced aldosterone secretion (78, 384, 385) and the phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including StAR (45, 373, 407, 515). For example, Bollag and colleagues have demonstrated that treatment of H295R human adrenocortical cells with the DAG-mimicking phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, increases mitochondrial cholesterol levels and aldosterone secretion (81), providing evidence for a possible role of PKC (and/or other DAG effector enzymes) in cholesterol transport and aldosterone production. Nevertheless, other studies indicate that PKC does not increase transcript levels of $CYP11B2$ or $CYP11B1$ (70, 482) and furthermore inhibits aldosterone production (69, 298, 421-423) [for recent review, see (310)]. Such differences may be due to the nature of the PKC isoforms involved. For example, studies in NCI-H295 cells transfected with conventional ($\mathrm{PKC} \alpha$), novel ($\mathrm{PKC} \varepsilon$) or atypical ($\mathrm{PKC} \zeta$) PKCs [for a general review on PKCs, see (656)] or in cells treated with selective inhibitors of PKC indicate that $\mathrm{PKC} \alpha$ and $\mathrm{PKC} \varepsilon$ both decrease $CYP11B2$ gene expression, whereas $\mathrm{PKC} \zeta$ enhances its expression (421, 422). This effect appears to be mediated by $\mathrm{PKC} \varepsilon$-stimulated ERK-1/2 (p42/p44${ }^{\text {mapk }}$), while $\mathrm{PKC} \alpha$ inhibition of $CYP11B2$ expression is independent of ERK1/2 activation (422, 423). In addition, $\mathrm{PKC} \varepsilon$, as a member of the “novel” PKC family, does not require $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for its activation (656). Other studies have concluded that PKC contributes to maintaining an aldosterone-secreting glomerulosa cell phenotype by inhibiting the expression of $CYP17$ (P450c17) (70). Together, these few examples indicate that the role of the PKC family in regulating acute and chronic aldosterone production largely remains to be explored (310).

#### Secondary G-dependent pathways

##### Role of phospholipase D (PLD) and protein kinase D (PKD)
While the most acknowledged PLC activated by Ang II is PLC$\beta$ coupled to Gq protein, PLC$\gamma$ and PLD may also play a role in Ang II-induced aldosterone secretion [for review on various PLCs, see (250)]. In addition, while it is well-known that InsP3 releases calcium from intracellular stores, there are several inositol products for which various roles have been assigned in the 1990s, some of which are related to intracellular trafficking (38). Examples of these second waves of signaling mediators are reported below.

The two isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, hydrolyze phospholipids, primarily phosphatidylcholine, to yield phosphatidic acid, which can then be converted to DAG by the action of lipid phosphate phosphatases. Phosphatidic acid is a stand-alone second messenger and is proposed to function as a slow-release reservoir of diacylglycerol (DAG) for sustained cellular responses [for review, see (79, 80, 536, 587, 675)]. As shown in Figure 15, phosphatidic acid can also be deacylated by phospholipase A$_2$ (PLA$_2$) to produce lysophosphatidic acid, a lipid signal that activates G protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid receptors. PLD has been recently described as having a critical role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. New studies reveal a direct link between PLD and the Wnt signaling pathway (369), a pathway involved in adrenocortical tumors (208). PLC thus may represent a “meeting point” for integrative responses of several signaling pathways. Ang II may also phosphorylate and activate PLA$_2$, either directly or through a phosphatidylcholine metabolism which leads to the production of arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites (487). As described in the section pertaining to ACTH, released non-esterified fatty acids can be metabolized into additional lipid signals, such as eicosanoids and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), which have been reported to stimulate aldosterone secretion (519, 520). Treatment of glomerulosa cells with exogenous PLD alone or in combination with the calcium channel agonist, BAY K 8644, induces a sustained increase in aldosterone secretion without an increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis, suggesting that PLD activity may be sufficient to stimulate aldosterone secretion [for review, see (310)]. However, the mechanism responsible for AA release is not fully described. Likewise to ACTH, Ang II and potassium induce the expression of acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 2 (Acat2) and acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACS4), two enzymes involved in intramitochondrial AA generation and export system and well characterized in other steroidogenic systems. The regulation of these enzymes as well as of StAR proteins also requires involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases (488).

Ang II also activates a DAG-sensitive serine/threonine protein kinase D (PKD). In the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line NCI H295R or in primary cultures of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, PKD mediates acute Ang II-induced aldosterone secretion. This activation by Ang II is both time- and dose-dependent and occurs through AT$_1$R and is not observed in cells stimulated with potassium ion ($\mathrm{K}^{+}$) or ACTH (675). The PKC$\varepsilon$ isoform is implicated in the phosphorylation of serine residues in the catalytic domain of PKD (623).

##### Role of Gi coupling
Ang II receptors are also coupled to a $G_{i}$-type G protein (52, 54, 293, 312, 461). However, the role of this coupling in AT$_1$R-mediated action in aldosterone stimulation is yet to be clearly established. The inhibitory effect of Ang II on adenylyl cyclase activity (461) suggests a role in the negative interaction with the ACTH effect, rather than a primary involvement in the effect of Ang II itself (293, 683). This coupling to Gi protein also contributes to its regulatory actions on voltage-sensitive T- and L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (474) [for review see (355, 683)]. In particular, Ang II, through Gi-$\beta \gamma$ subunits, inhibits the activity of certain potassium channelssuch as KCNJ5 channels (535, 640), leading to calcium influx into zona glomerulosa cells (640) (see section related to the role of ion channels in adrenal cortical function).

### Role of JAK/STAT signaling

This signaling cascade was initially found to mediate the growth-promoting actions of cytokines, prolactin and growth hormone. JAK2 has been reported to associate with the AT₁R, an interaction mediated by a Tyr-Ile-Pro-Pro (YIPP) sequence in the C-terminal tail of the receptor [for review, see (355)] (Fig. 15B). In vascular smooth muscle, Ang II stimulates the association of JAK2 with AT₁R via the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, with the COOH terminus of AT₁R serving as a docking site for JAK2, and stimulating JAK2 phosphorylation at Tyr¹⁰⁰⁷/¹⁰⁰⁸ (463). Upon activation by JAK, STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they mediate gene transcription of early growth response genes, such as *c-fos* and *c-myc*.

### Chronic effects of Ang II – second wave of signaling

The chronic effects of Ang II are apparent when sodium concentration in plasma is decreased below normal values (135–145 mmol/L) as well as under certain pathological conditions such as hypertension (279, 424). In these conditions, there is an increase in aldosterone secretion, which is maintained as a result of the expansion of the zona glomerulosa via hypertrophy and hyperplasia. These effects have been studied for a number of years using the experimental model of sodium-restriction diet (5, 335, 533). After one or two weeks under a sodium-deficient diet (0.1% sodium in the diet compared to 0.3% in standard diet), Ang II increases the expression of *CYP11B2* (the enzyme necessary for aldosterone production) in glomerulosa cells without affecting that of *CYP11B1* (enzyme involved in corticosterone production) (2, 334, 710) [see Fig. 1 from (498)]. In these conditions, Ang II upregulates the expression of AT₁R, thus increasing the sensitivity of glomerulosa cells to Ang II (5, 205, 420). Further studies have shown that inhibiting the effects of Ang II, either with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (420) or with selective blockers of AT₁R, such as losartan, abolishes Ang II-induced expression of *CYP11B2* and overall reduces the effect of Ang II-AT₁R in the adrenal gland (205) [for review, see (310)].

It is yet to be clearly established whether Ang II in these conditions acts on the increase in cell number (proliferation) or on the increase in the machinery involved in aldosterone secretion (hypertrophy). In cells maintained in primary culture for three days, we have shown that Ang II rather promotes cellular hypertrophy with a concomitant arrest in basal cell proliferation. The hypertrophic effect of Ang II, by enhancing expression of specific steroidogenic proteins such as StAR and 3β-HSD, is correlated with an increase in aldosterone secretion (540) [for review see (542)]. This Ang II-promoting effect on protein synthesis occurs through p38 MAPK,

suggesting a shift from pathways involved in proliferation to those involved in cell protein synthesis.

#### Involvement of MAPKs in zona glomerulosa cell function

As thoroughly investigated in other models, including vascular smooth muscle cells, Ang II activates the MAPK pathway, namely p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> (also called ERK1/2) in bovine (112, 706) and rat glomerulosa cells (486, 540), and p38 MAPK and (JNK) (540, 685). This rise in p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> by Ang II is involved in the activation of cholesterol ester hydrolase by Ang II (131) with p38 MAPK being involved in the Ang II-induced release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular pools (685). Inhibiting these pathways by preincubating glomerulosa cells with UO126 (an inhibitor of MEK, thus of p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup>) and with SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) abrogates Ang II-stimulated aldosterone secretion and the Ang II-induced increase in both StAR and 3β-HSD expression (544) [review in (545)].

MAPK activation by AT₁R corresponds to the second wave of signaling. Although AT₁R lacks intrinsic kinase activity, it can activate MAPK through (i) PKC-activation of Ras or/and c-Src; (ii) G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) or Gβγ-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or (iii) complex extracellular matrix/cytoskeletal interaction and subsequent activation of several intracellular kinases (such as FAK and adaptor proteins, paxillin and p130Cas) which form a complex involved in JNK activation [for review, see (355, 487)]. Although not clearly established in zona glomerulosa cells, the activation of MAPK can occur, as documented for many GPCRs, from desensitization and internalization, where β-arrestin serves as a scaffold to organize the formation of signaling complexes and from transactivation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and other growth factor receptors. This transactivation pathway may be mediated by Ca²⁺, PKC and Src-dependent transactivation of transmembrane matrix metalloproteases, which promote the release of heparin-binding EGF from its precursor in the cell membrane along with activation of EGFR (355, 672). Once activated, EGFRs serve as docking sites for Grb2/Shc/Sos complexes, which may lead to the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway as well as to the PI3K/PDK1/Akt) cascades. These studies and many others point to EGFR as an important factor in growth and hypertrophy caused by Ang II (355, 672). Lastly, MAPK activation can also result from activation of several scaffolds and kinases resulting from close interaction between extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton.

In summary, given the above knowledge, it could be postulated that the apparent discrepancies between *in vivo* situations (484) and *in vitro* observations (540) may be due to interaction with cell environment, either through interaction with neighboring cells (endothelial cells or fibroblasts), which also express Ang II AT₁R (211), or through interaction with a receptor tyrosine kinase, which may be initiated by the effect of Ang II on the extracellular matrix (534, 672) (Fig. 15B) (see section on extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton for further details) (542).

### Functional Selectivity Perspectives—distinguishing G protein-dependent and G protein-independent behavior in the adrenal cortex

It is not the intent here to review structure-activity relationships, but simply to highlight certain key features which may be useful in the context of zona glomerulosa regulation [for a full review on molecular biology and structure-activity relationship, see (22, 23)]. As shown in Figure 16A, certain residues in the AT₁R located in transmembrane domains and in intracellular loops are important for Ang II binding (illustrated in blue), G protein coupling (illustrated in green) and signaling (orange) (22). For example, Asn294 (N) and Asn298 (N) in TM7 impair Gq-dependent signaling; mutations in Tyr302 (Y) in TM7/C-term abrogate Gq-dependent signaling; triple alanine mutant Tyr312 (Y), Phe313 (F) and Leu314 (L) in C-term abolishes Gq signal. Mutations in Ala 221 (A), Tyr226 (Y), Trp219 (Y), or Ala225 (A) in ICL3 severely impair Gq-coupling or abrogate Gq-dependent signaling in case of Asp125(D), Arg126 (R) in TM3/ICL2 (DRY-motif) mutations. Meanwhile, Asp74 (D) in transmembrane domains 2 is crucial for InsP3 production (22). In addition, Lys residues (K) in C-terminus directly and strongly bind to tubulin. A mutation that disrupts tubulin binding dramatically inhibits the cell surface expression of AT₁R, which remains localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (763). These data demonstrate that certain specific amino acids (Lys residues) in the C-terminus of AT₁R, in proximity to the juxtamembrane region, not only regulate cell response to Ang II, but also suggest an important role of the microtubular network in the transport of AT₁R to the cell membrane (763) (Fig. 16B).

Several studies have established that it is possible to separate G protein-dependent signaling and G protein-independent signaling pathways by pharmacological means (23). The AT₁R is particularly interesting with respect to functional selectivity given that specific activation of G protein-independent signaling has proven relevance in various settings including primary cells, isolated organs and *in vivo* [review in (22)]. The G protein component of AT₁R signaling is responsible for acute aldosterone secretion, while selective G protein-independent signaling appears to be associated with cell growth phenotypes (regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and interaction with extracellular matrix components and cytoskeleton) (22) (Fig. 16B). In this regard, the Ang II analog (499) SII (abbreviated SII-Ang II) has been described as a powerful tool to obtain selective G protein-independent responses from native AT₁R (336). Without activating the G protein, SII-Ang II retains the ability to induce receptor phosphorylation along with a tight interaction with β-arrestins to stimulate receptor internalization and G protein-independent signaling (22, 24, 182). In classical pharmacological terms, SII-Ang II would be classified as a competitive antagonist for the productive coupling of the AT₁R to Gq and formation of inositol phosphates. However, in terms of measuring β-arrestin-mediated effects such as receptor internalization or ERK1/2 phosphorylation as output parameters, SII-Ang II would be perceived as a full or partial agonist, now called “biased agonism,” being able to induce β-arrestin2-dependent signaling that includes receptor internalization and activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2) without generation of inositol phosphate second messengers by the AT₁R (12, 24, 182, 336, 742) (Fig. 16B). Such tools may be used to discriminate effects on aldosterone from those on adrenal growth (22). A good example to gauge the pharmacological potential of this concept is the study by Daniels et al. (182), examining the relative contribution of G protein-dependent and independent signals to the well-established role of Ang II in eliciting thirst and salt appetite. By comparing the effects of Ang II and SII-Ang II *in vivo*, using direct injection into the rat brain, this study suggests that the immediate drinking response to Ang II is Gq dependent, whereas increased salt intake is achieved by Gq-independent mechanisms (182).

While certain properties of AT₁R are well described in some cell types, they have yet to be investigated in the adrenal gland. For example, there is evidence that AT₁R forms homo- or heterodimerization of the AT₁R, which may also contribute to its pathophysiological roles (355). In addition, in certain cell types, Ang II is coupled to the cytoskeleton and MAPK pathways through G₁₂/₁₃ proteins. However, evidence for involvement of G₁₂/₁₃ proteins has not been reported in the adrenal cortex (355, 683).

### The role of AT₂R in the adrenal gland

As stated in the section related to Ang II receptors and their general properties, AT₂R is abundant in fetal tissues, particularly in the adrenal gland and kidney, where its expression level is much greater than that of AT₁R (Fig. 17A) (9, 674). In the adult, AT₂R is expressed in the zona glomerulosa, together with AT₁R, and almost exclusively in the adrenal medulla (3, 138, 245, 425, 447, 576, 577) (Fig. 17B), where it is involved in the stimulation of catecholamine secretion (410, 465, 702).

The tools for discriminating between AT₁R and AT₂R consist of the AT₂R agonists, CGP42112A and a new nonpeptide called C21/M024, and the relatively selective antagonist PD123319 (733). As in many tissues, the expression of AT₂R increases when cellular homeostasis is disrupted (425, 576) or in the presence of pathological situations (381). For example, Peters et al. (576) showed that following bilateral nephrectomy, proliferation rate was low in zona glomerulosa and associated with an enlargement of steroidogenic active cells. Simultaneously, the number and area of distribution of AT₂R-positive cells increased in the zona glomerulosa (Fig. 17C). The authors showed that the rapid increase in size of the zona glomerulosa and consequently in aldosterone production results from hypertrophy and recruitment of previously inactive cells of the zona glomerulosa and the steroidogenic undifferentiated zona intermedia (498). In contrast, in the medulla, there was a decreased expression of the AT₂R which

Mutation that disrupts tubulin binding dramatically inhibits the cell surface expression of AT₁R, which remains localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (763). (B) Pharmacological potential of biased agonism at the AT₁ receptor. Left panel, Ang II binds the AT₁ receptor to activate both G protein-dependent and independent signaling. These mechanisms increase acute and secondary steroidogenesis and steroid secretion, as well as chronic effects on growth and transcription of steroidogenic enzymes. Binding of a conventional AT₁ receptor antagonist blocks all effects of AT₁ receptor signaling. Right panel, Application of a “biased ligand” (which has the ability to selectively stimulate a subset of a receptor’s activities), may enable selective blockade of detrimental G protein-dependent responses while activating G protein-independent signaling. The relative impact of G protein-dependent and independent mechanisms on metabolic regulation remains to be established. Current therapeutic modalities block both beneficial and detrimental effects. Biased ligands such as SII-Ang II (336) may allow pathway-specific targeting of receptor actions and hold promise for future therapeutic options.

(A) Autoradiography of total Ang II receptors (radioactive ligand alone), $AT_{1}$ receptors (after blockade of $AT_{2}$ receptors with 10 μmol/L PD123177, an $AT_{2}$ receptor antagonist), and $AT_{2}$ receptors (after blockade of $AT_{1}$ receptors with 10 μmol/L Losartan, an $AT_{1}$ receptor antagonist) in rat kidney and adrenal glands at postnatal day 2. (B) Ang II $AT_{1A}$, $AT_{1B}$, and $AT_{2}$ receptor mRNA in the adrenal zona glomerulosa and adrenal medulla. Scale bar = 1 mm. In adrenal glands from fetuses and newborns, the $AT_{2}$ receptor is more abundant than the $AT_{1}$ receptor. Thereafter, its expression decreases, but remains abundant. In the adult adrenal gland, both $AT_{1}$ and $AT_{2}$ receptors are present in adrenal zona glomerulosa while only the $AT_{2}$ receptor is expressed in the medulla. (C) Effect of bilateral nephrectomy in rats on the expression of the $AT_{2}$ receptor and CYP11B2 mRNA in the adrenal cortex revealed by nonradioactive in situ hybridization. Representative sections of adrenal glands of a sham operated group (upper panel) and nephrectomy group (lower panel). Compared to sham-operated rats (a), bilateral nephrectomy leads to a marked increase in the expression of $AT_{2}$ receptor mRNA in the zona glomerulosa (ZG) (c). Concomitantly with the enlargement of the steroidogenic active zona glomerulosa (ZG) (from 2 or 3 cell layers to 5 or 6 cell layers), as defined by the expression of CYP11B2 mRNA (b and d), the area of cells expressing $AT_{2}$ receptor mRNA increases similarly from 2 or 3 layers to 5 to 7 layers of cells. However, in contrast to the homogeneous distribution of CYP11B2 in bilateral nephrectomy animals, distribution of $AT_{2}$ receptor mRNA is not homogeneous. Only a few clusters of cells are found to express the $AT_{2}$ receptor gene. Reproduced, with permission, from Figure 2 (9) (A), Figure 8 (425) (B) and Figure 2 (576) (C).
was associated with increased proliferation. These results demonstrate a differential regulation of the AT₂R in the adrenal gland and suggest that expression of this receptor type is involved in inhibiting proliferation, but also in favoring differentiation of the zona glomerulosa and medulla. More recently, the same group developed a model of transgenic rat that overexpresses AT₂R only in a few tissues, including kidney, heart and the adrenal gland (577), which confirms and extend their former studies. In these transgenic mice, AT₂R density in the zona glomerulosa is elevated 3-fold compared to wild-type littermates, whereas AT₁R density remains unchanged. Three and 14 days of Ang II infusion increased plasma aldosterone levels in both wild-type and transgenic animals. These changes were completely abolished by the AT₁R blocker losartan. Proliferation of glomerulosa cells, as indicated by the number of Ki-67-positive glomerulosa cells, was stimulated by Ang II in wild-type rats; however, this increase was significantly attenuated in transgenic mice overexpressing AT₂R. Thus, AT₂R in the adrenal zona glomerulosa inhibits Ang II-induced cell proliferation but has no obvious lasting effect on the regulation of aldosterone production at the investigated stages (577), thus corroborating previous results [see Fig. 4 (540)].

In Cushing’s (cortisol secreting adenoma) and Conn’s (aldosterone secreting adenoma) syndromes, while there are no differences in cortical $AT_{1}R$ mRNA when compared to control adrenal cortex, $AT_{2}R$ mRNA levels are significantly decreased, an observation possibly in correlation with the increase in proliferation which, in this particular example, may be correlated with adrenal tumorigenesis (381).

### AT₂ receptors in the human fetal adrenal gland

In the human fetal adrenal gland, AT₂R labeling is predominant in the fetal zone (identified using P450c17 as a fetal zone marker) and in a population of cells having a radial disposition, which could correspond to future chromaffin cells (91). The high expression of AT₂R in the fetal zone (91) may be correlated with the high level of apoptosis present in this area during development (114). Indeed, we have shown that Ang II, via AT₂R, induces DNA fragmentation and cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, in fetal adrenal cells, thus corroborating numerous studies indicating that the AT₂R can induce cellular apoptosis. These data highlight the intricate regulation of 3β-HSD onset and P450c17 maintenance in the human fetal adrenal gland [for review, see (116, 489)] and suggest that the AT₂ receptor may influence the activity of these enzymes. Such findings for the fetal adrenal gland could potentially be observed in the adult adrenal gland although, to date, aside from a few exceptions (576, 577), no study has clearly identified the role of AT₂R in the adult gland. The exact nature of the signaling pathways activated by AT₂R remains a puzzle and varies according to intracellular environmental factors, such as the presence or absence of other receptors (such as AT₁R), receptor-associated proteins and growth factors. To date, none of the candidate pathways have been investigated in the adrenal gland (263, 340).

#### Conclusion

In summary, Ang II, through the AT₁ receptor, is not only the main stimulus of aldosterone secretion, but also displays a trophic action, which is exemplified under certain physiological perturbations, such as sodium-deficient conditions. The acute effects of Ang II exert their actions through the Gq/11/phospholipase C-induced phosphoinositide breakdown pathway. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium, calcium influx and protein kinase C activation are responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of a number of proteins involved in steroidogenesis, among which are steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and calmodulin kinase (CAMK). Chronic and long term effects of Ang II mobilize several pathways which interfere with proliferation, growth, migration or cell viability, according to the type of mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) pathways. These latter pathways are usually activated following chronic exposure to Ang II and play a well-documented role in inflammation, oxidative stress and cardiovascular diseases (279, 424, 740). Of particular interest, pharmacological tools have been developed to separate G protein-dependent (acute effects on aldosterone) and G protein-independent signaling (growth-promoting effects) pathways, thus opening novel avenues to isolate and inactivate the damaging pathways.

#### Role of Ion Channels in Adrenal Cortical Function

From the earlier studies in the 1980s to present day, most ion channels identified according to their electrical properties have been cloned, resulting not only in a change in nomenclature for a majority of these channels, but also in revisiting initial interpretations on their roles in excitation-secretion coupling in adrenocortical cells. We will attempt to summarize as well as compare the distinctive properties between aldosterone-secreting cells (zona glomerulosa) and cortisol/corticosterone-secreting cells (zona fasciculata or adrenocortical tumor Y1 cell line) as well as their sensitivity to hormonal stimuli, angiotensin II (Ang II) and ACTH. Certain pathophysiological implications of these channels will be discussed, the aim being to provide an overview of the importance of ion channel activity for ACTH and Ang II actions. For details regarding all of the mechanisms involved in intracellular regulation (including by kinases, phosphatases, α- or β-subunits of Gq or Gi proteins), readers are invited to consult more specialized reviews (51, 223, 276, 290, 379).

Figure 18 Effects of ACTH (A) and angiotensin II (Ang II) (B) on intracellular calcium concentration (Cai) in adrenal glomerulosa cells. Microfluorometric measurements of Cai were recorded in individual cells loaded with the fluorescent intracellular indicator Fura2/AM, as described in (711). Briefly, cells were cultured on coverslips, loaded with Fura 2/AM, placed in a perfusion chamber, and mounted on an inverted Nikon microscope. The test solutions were applied near the tested cell using a micropipette positioned by a micromanipulator (with a superfusion rate of 1 mL/min). Ca²⁺-free solutions were obtained by adding 0.5 mmol/L EGTA in a (Continued)

hydrolase activity (through the HSL) (131); (2) cytoskeletal delivery of cholesterol to the outer mitochondrial membrane (132, 133); (3) activation of intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer (128, 130, 388); and (4) expression of StAR (133, 146) and of most steroidogenic enzymes (69). Calcium ($\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$) necessary for these actions is derived from intracellular stores and/or calcium influx [for review see (627, 629, 631, 683)].

With regard to ACTH action, it is now well established that $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ stems from extracellular sources (257, 285, 386, 387, 711, 754, 755). Certain studies have described $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ oscillations in individual fasciculata cells (380, 754), while others, using glomerulosa and fasciculata cell populations, noted that ACTH induced an immediate increase in $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ (387). More generally, once calcium influx is established, the response is maintained as long as the cell remains stimulated. The responses generated by ACTH are (i) not observed in a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free medium or after addition of L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (10 μmol/L), (ii) enhanced when the L-type calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644, is added to the incubation medium after a plateau is reached with ACTH, (iii) mimicked by 8-Br-cAMP, and (iv) blocked by PKA inhibitors (such as HA1004 or H-89) (Fig. 18A). These results indicate that the source of the increase in $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ results from $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive channels since Bay K 8644 enhances while nifedipine completely abolishes these responses. Moreover, results obtained with 8-Br-cAMP and HA1004 strongly support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channels may be responsible for the increase in $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ observed with ACTH (711). However, in fasciculata cells, the ACTH-induced rise in $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ is cAMP-independent and not affected by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel blockers (387). This assumption stems from the use of NPS-ACTH, which does not activate cAMP production, but increases $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ (754).

On the other hand, the initial mechanism by which Ang II increases $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ is entirely different. As convincingly shown in many studies conducted in glomerulosa cells (107, 386, 387, 593), the most widely-accepted mechanism is that binding of Ang II to the AT₁R, through phosphoinositide breakdown, induces a rapid and transient increase in $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$, consisting in an initial peak, followed by a plateau of lower amplitude (157, 366, 589, 592, 593, 622, 711). The patterns of Ang II stimulation vary according to the level of basal $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$; however, the general features are the following: (i) in cells without basal oscillations, application of 100 nmol/L Ang II rapidly induces a transient spike followed by a sustained plateau of increased $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$, while in a cell in which basal oscillations are present, application of Ang II induces a rapid and transient spike, followed by a series of oscillations with higher frequency than in control conditions; (ii) if the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-containing perfusate (1.1 mmol/L) is changed for a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free medium or upon addition of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (10 μmol/L), the plateau disappears and $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ rapidly returns to basal values, even in the continuous presence of Ang II; and (iii) if a cell is superfused with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free medium for 10 min prior to Ang II application, a single peak of $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ increase is observed after which $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ rapidly returns to baseline values (Fig. 18B) (711). These results indicate that the initial spike of $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ is independent of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and likely results from mobilization of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pools, while the $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ plateau is produced by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx (628, 631). This influx is partly dependent of AT₁R-coupled to Gi protein since, as for InsP3 accumulation (293), influx is decreased when cells are preincubated with pertussis toxin (which induces ADP-rybosylation and thus blocking of the αi-subunit of Gi) (285, 383).

### Electrical properties of adrenocortical cells – effects of ACTH and angiotensin II

Adrenocortical cells are characterized by the presence of several channels, the most important being (1) voltage-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (223, 290, 683), (2) voltage-independent calcium channels (25, 99, 100) and (3) background (or leak) channels (such as TASK and TREK channels) (51, 276, 379). In contrast to classical excitable cells such as cardiac or neuronal cells, there are no $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels. Nevertheless, as in these latter cells, adrenocortical cells have the propensity to generate spontaneous action potentials (APs). These APs have been reported either using microelectrodes in isolated cells (449, 471, 521, 697) or the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, using cultured rat glomerulosa cells (209, 468). More recent studies, using mouse zona glomerulosa slices, have since confirmed that zona glomerulosa cells are intrinsic electrical oscillators (349). A schematic

Cai was recorded with a Fluoroplex II system and is illustrated as the ratio of fluorescence at two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) with the resulting emission collected at 510 nm. (A) Effect of ACTH on Cai response in bovine glomerulosa cells: (a) The Cai response induced by 1 pmol/L ACTH appears very slowly. A progressive increase in Cai is seen, followed by a plateau which falls abruptly after washing with ACTH-free control medium (a) or by adding EGTA (b). Addition of 50 μmol/L Bay K 8644 (a L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels activator) leads to an immediate and further increase in Cai while the subsequent removal of extracellular calcium (c) or addition of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (10 μmol/L) (d) abolishes the Cai increase induced by ACTH. Finally, likewise to ACTH, 8-bromo cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) enhances Cai (e), while addition of the PKA inhibitor HA1004 abrogates the ACTH response (f). (B) Illustration of Cai recordings in single bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells: (a, b) In these cells superfused with medium containing 1.1 mmol/L $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, addition of Ang II (100 nmol/L) induces a rapid increase in Cai followed by a sustained plateau. Removal of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the superfusion medium (a) or addition of 10 μmol/L nifedipine (b) induces a rapid decline in the plateau and a return to baseline values. (c) In this cell superfused with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-containing medium, Ang II (100 nmol/L) induces rapid oscillations which quickly cease when the cell is superfused with a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free medium. (d) In this example, the cell is superfused with a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free medium during 10 min prior to Ang II application (100 nmol/L). A single peak of Cai rapidly returns to baseline values.

Steroidogenesis—Adrenal Cell Signal Transduction

### Figure 19 Electrophysiological properties of zona glomerulosa cells. The resting membrane potential is maintained as a result of background K⁺ channels of the KCNK gene family (the TWIK-related acid-sensitive K⁺ (TASK) channel TASK-1, TASK-3, and bTREK-1). Glomerulosa cells also express various types of voltage-dependent K⁺ channels and two types of voltage-dependent calcium channels (T-type and L-type Ca²⁺ channels) which promote Ca²⁺ influx when open. Under resting conditions, the intracellular calcium concentration (Cai) ranges from 50 to 150 nmol/L, according to cell types. Exchangers and Ca²⁺-permeant nonselective channels, such as chloride channels, also participate in the maintenance of basal Cai. Binding of ACTH stimulates adenylyl cyclase-induced cAMP and PKA activation. Thereafter, PKA phosphorylates and activates a slow but sustained Ca²⁺ influx through L-type channels. On the other hand, Ang II, through Gq stimulation of phospholipase Cβ and phosphoinositide breakdown, generates diacylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) which releases Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores near the mitochondria. Under these stimulated conditions, Cai can rise to 200 to 600 nmol/L. In the cytoplasm, Ca²⁺ activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (Ca²⁺-CaMK) as well as certain protein kinase C isoforms (PKCs). The subsequent depletion of Ca²⁺ stores activates CRAC channels responsible for the capacitative Ca²⁺ influx. This additional influx allows the refilling of intracellular stores. Finally, exchangers (Na⁺-Ca²⁺) and pumps (Na⁺/K⁺ and Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase) participate in the trafficking of Ca²⁺ across the plasma membrane.

view of the participation of these channels in the control of aldosterone production is illustrated in Figure 19, together with a summary of the general properties of all channels expressed in adrenocortical cells in Table 3.

### General properties of adrenocortical excitability

From the early work of Matthews (471, 472), it is known that adrenocortical cells are characterized by a negative resting membrane potential (Vm) ranging from –78 to –90 mV (compared to –30 to –40 mV for most epithelial cells), which is maintained essentially by background channels. A fundamental difference between the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata is indeed their sensitivity toward K⁺ ions. One particular property of glomerulosa cells is their capacity to be stimulated in a narrow range of potassium concentrations (from 5.5 to 8.5 mmol/L), while at upper concentrations,
stimulation decreases. In fact, an increase in extracellular K⁺ concentration by approximately 1 mmol/L is sufficient to increase aldosterone secretion by 100%. In contrast, K⁺ has no effect on either corticosterone or Caᵢ in fasciculata cells (88, 306, 441, 452, 695).

The basis for this unique sensitivity to K⁺ is a very high background K⁺ conductance (provided by background channels and various types of voltage-dependent K⁺ channels), prompting the membrane voltage to strictly follow the K⁺ equilibrium potential. At low extracellular K⁺, the membrane voltage is hyperpolarized; thus membrane depolarization occurs upon relatively small increases in extracellular K⁺, which is sufficient to activate voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels in rat glomerulosa cells and aldosterone secretion (107, 441, 471) as well as the expression of key steroidogenic enzymes without involvement of PKA or protein kinase C pathways (69).

The background potassium channels are responsible for the resting membrane potential

The very negative resting membrane potential of adrenocortical cells is maintained due to the functional properties of a class of potassium channels identified in the 1990s, namely the KCNK gene family of two-pore-domain potassium (K₂P) channels (275, 276, 339, 379). Two family members are abundantly expressed in the rat, mouse and human zona glomerulosa, the “Tandem of P domains in a weak inwardly rectifying K⁺ channel (TWIK)-related acid-sensitive K⁺ (TASK) channel”, TASK-1 (also known as K₂P3.1 or KCNK3) and TASK-3 (K₂P9.1 or KCNK9) (178, 179, 184, 442). In bovine glomerulosa cells, bTREK-1, another K2P channel, is also involved in the setting of the membrane potential (224, 225, 433). At the present time, there are no selective pharmacological agents for TASK or TREK-1 channels. Nevertheless, the availability of TASK and TREK-1 knockout mice has enabled direct evaluation of the contribution of these background channels to native currents, thus providing key advances in our understanding of their roles (41, 184, 317). The combined deletion of TASK-1 and TASK-3 subunits from mouse glomerulosa cells has been shown to result in a baseline membrane depolarization of approximately 20 mV and marked increase (400%) aldosterone production. In addition, several unanticipated new functions for these channels have been discovered, as described below.

Recent studies have shown that TASK knockout mice (*Task1⁻/⁻*) present dysregulated aldosterone production similar to that observed in primary hyperaldosteronism (184, 317), which is independent of salt intake and arterial “low-renin” hypertension [for review, see (40, 51)]. Interestingly, immunofluorescence studies, using an antibody directed against aldosterone synthase (P450aldo), highlight a dramatic change in functional zonation of adrenal glands. Indeed, in wild-type mice of either sex, P450aldo-specific staining is localized exclusively in glomerulosa cells whereas in adrenal glands of female *Task1⁻/⁻* mice, the zona glomerulosa is virtually absent and P450aldo-positive cells are rather observed in the zona fasciculata and reticularis (Fig. 20A). In contrast, adult male *Task1⁻/⁻* mice do not show any abnormal zonation patterns (Fig. 20A) (317). To evaluate the contribution of male sex hormones as factors in the zonation process, the effect of castration and treatment with estrogen has also been studied. In male *Task1⁺/⁺* mice, castration does not affect adrenocortical zonation, although it does abrogate the ability of male *Task1⁻/⁻* mice to develop normal zonation, suggesting a critical role of androgens in driving compensatory mechanisms in male *Task1⁻/⁻* mice. Such a compensatory role of androgens in the disruption of the *Task1* gene has been corroborated by the observation that female *task1⁻/⁻* mice display normal aldosterone synthase distribution after testosterone treatment (Fig. 20B). Taken together, these observations indicate that TASK-1 is an essential K⁺ channel for the determination of adrenal gland zonation and aldosterone secretion in male and female mice prior to puberty. After puberty,

Figure 20 Mislocalization of aldosterone synthase in adrenal glands of *Task1⁻/⁻* mice is sex-dependent. (A) In adult *Task1⁺/⁺* mice of either sex and in male *Task1⁻/⁻* mice, aldosterone synthase staining is restricted to zona glomerulosa cells. In female *Task1⁻/⁻* mice (upper right panel), regular aldosterone synthase staining is disrupted and broadened to the inner areas of the adrenal cortex. The right portion of each panel shows higher magnification images of the adrenal cortex (aldosterone synthase in green, differential interference contrast in gray scale, nuclear staining with HOE33342 in blue). (B) Effects of castration, estradiol (estr.), and testosterone (test.) treatment on aldosterone synthase localization. Male mice were castrated at the age of 5 weeks, followed by treatment with or without estradiol benzoate (4 mg/g/day, s.c., for 5 weeks). In male *Task1⁻/⁻*, castration (with or without estradiol treatment) does not affect adrenocortical zonation. Sham-operated male *Task1⁻/⁻* also show normal zonation (upper panel). In male *Task1⁻/⁻*, castration prevents normal zonation. Estradiol appears to reduce aldosterone synthase expression without having clear effects on zonation patterns. In female *Task1⁻/⁻* mice, treatment with testosterone for 3 weeks induces normal zonation, highlighting the importance of androgens for adrenocortical rezonation in *Task1⁻/⁻* mice (lower panel). Reproduced, with permission, from Figure 4 and 7 from (317).

unknown factors, possibly TASK-3 K⁺ channels, substitute for the absence of TASK-1 and promote compensatory mechanisms in male *task1⁻/⁻* mice (317). In this regard, recent studies indeed show that compared to wild-type adult mice, adult *Task3⁻/⁻* mice do not show ectopic expression of aldosterone synthase but nevertheless display partially autonomous

aldosterone secretion, subclinical hyperaldosteronism, and salt-sensitive hypertension (291, 572). In addition, compared with adults, newborn $Task3^{-/-}$ mice display a severe adrenal phenotype with strongly increased aldosterone, corticosterone and progesterone plasma levels (41). These models suggest that TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels serve different functions in adrenal aldosterone production, with both channels controlling the resting membrane potential of zona glomerulosa cells, but with TASK-1 having an additional role in restricting CYP11B2 expression to the zona glomerulosa [for review, see (40)].

There are very few data on the effect of ACTH and Ang II on these channels, except for bTREK-1. The rapid actions of ACTH leading to depolarization-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry occur in seconds or minutes and are mediated by the inhibition of pre-existing bTREK-1 channels. Treating adrenal fasciculata cells with ACTH for prolonged periods also regulates bTREK-1 gene expression (220). The findings of Liu et al. (432) are consistent with a model in which ACTH inhibits bTREK-1 by a cAMP- and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-independent mechanism requiring an unidentified protein kinase (225). This mechanism is independent of PKA but mimicked by Epac-specific cAMP analogs (226, 432, 433). The bTREK-1 $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels are also inhibited by Ang II via a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent mechanism that does not require the depletion of membrane-associated phosphoinositides, indicating that the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ source is located in close proximity within a “$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ nanodomain” of bTREK-1 channels, where $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ may reach concentrations of up to $10 \mu \mathrm{M}$. bTREK-1 is the first two-pore $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel shown to be inhibited by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ through activation of a GPCR (224). Such results suggest that the inhibition of bTREK-1 channels by Ang II potentially produces membrane depolarization and the activation of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, leading to further TREK-1 inhibition in a positive feedback mechanism, culminating in large $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent increases in corticosteroid production (224, 225, 379).

### Depolarization-induced secretion is due to voltage-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels

The sensitivity of glomerulosa cells to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-induced depolarization is due to the presence of voltage-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels. Binding of ACTH or Ang II to their respective receptors induces a depolarization of the membrane potential which triggers an increased influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (385-387). Prior to their cloning in the 1990s, most of these channels had been characterized by the patch-clamp methodology developed in the 1980s (303). Three main types of voltage-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels have been described, namely (1) a transient outward A-type current ($\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{A}}$) (now called $\mathrm{Kv}_{1.4}$) (218) recorded in rat (556, 719), bovine and human zona glomerulosa cells (89), and in the Y1 cell line (320). This current activates rapidly, reaching a maximum, and then decreases with time (Fig. 21A, left panel); (2) a sustained delayed rectifier outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current (now called $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{s}}$), described in rat (556, 719) and human zona glomerulosa cells (89, 558) (Fig. 21A, right panel); and (3) a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current called maxi-BK (BK channels) reported in rat (440, 557, 719) and the Y1 cell line (698, 699). This slow outward current activates slowly without an apparent time-dependent inactivation. A new type of non-inactivating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current, $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{AC}}$, has also been described in bovine fasciculata cells, which is inhibited by ACTH (501) [for review, see (223, 290)]. Since their cloning, a new nomenclature has been adopted for most of these channels (Table 3).

Initial studies demonstrated that ACTH induces a 5-10 mV depolarization with an increased occurrence of action potentials (449, 450, 471, 472). In rat glomerulosa cells, this increase in cell excitability can be produced by a blockage of the transient outward, delayed rectifier current $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{A}}$ by ACTH, as later reported (320, 556). However, in bovine, but not in rat glomerulosa cells, ACTH also decreases the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ non-inactivating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current, $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{k}}$ (556). Although some differences have been observed in the characteristics of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ currents between species (rat, bovine or human cells), Ang II consistently blocks outward currents, both in rat (556) (Fig. 21A) and human glomerulosa cells (89) (Fig. 21B). With the use of patch-clamp in the cell-attached mode, single-channel recordings in bovine glomerulosa cells have demonstrated that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels are reversibly blocked when Ang II is added to the bath solution. These results strongly suggest that the effect of Ang II on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ is not direct, but rather mediated by an Ang II-induced second-messenger (89). In bovine fasciculata cells, ACTH decreases the amplitude of the $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{A}}$ current by a mechanism involving a new type of non-inactivating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current, called $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{AC}}$ (219, 501). Conversely, the near complete inhibition of $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{AC}}$ by ACTH is accompanied by the coincidental reappearance of functional $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{A}}$ channels. In the absence of $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{AC}}$ current, ACTH fails to alter $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{A}}$. Since $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{AC}}$ is also inhibited by Ang II, this non-inactivating current could constitute a convergence point between two different pathways i.e. ACTH/Gs/cAMP/PKA and Ang II/Gq/DAG/InsP3/PKC, both of which are involved in steroidogenesis. It is not known whether this type of current is also present in glomerulosa cells.

Studies from genetically modified mice have pointed to a role of some voltage-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels in the regulation of aldosterone secretion (27). It was recently found that somatic mutations of the KCNJ5 gene coding for the potassium channel Kir3.4 (also called G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 4, GIRK4) are associated with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (139). The mutation is localized near the pore, in a region which alters $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ selectivity in favor of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, resulting in the depolarization of the cell membrane (195), the opening of the voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx (139). This $\mathrm{Ca}_{i}$ activates several cascades associated with enhanced steroidogenesis (535), and is comparable to that of patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas (30, 31, 139) (Fig. 19). Under these conditions, some genes are increased, such as CYP11B2 and NR4A2 (coding for an important transcriptional regulator NURR1). In addition, recent work has also indicated that tumors harboring KCNJ5 mutations may express higher levels of CYP17A1

(a) ACTH was applied at three different concentrations. In each case are illustrated control (trace 1), effect of ACTH (trace 2) and recovery after washout (trace 3). Holding potential, –65 mV, test potential, 20 mV. Calibrations: horizontal, 50 ms (ACTH, 0.1 and 1 nmol/L) and 40 ms (ACTH, 10 nmol/L); vertical, 200 pA (ACTH, 0.1 and 1 nmol/L) and 250 pA (ACTH, 10 nmol/L).
(b) The slow outward current is not significantly blocked; the higher trace represents the control, the middle and lower traces are ACTH 10 nmol/L, applied for 2 and 5 ms, respectively; Holding potential, –65 mV; test potential, 70 mV.
(c) Differential effect of ACTH on transient and slow outward currents in the same cell. Four traces recorded at voltages indicated at the left of each recording before (circle) and after (squares) application of ACTH (10 nmol/L; 5 min). By blocking the transient outward current, ACTH reveals the slow outward current.
(d) The difference between the two traces (before ACTH minus after ACTH) is the current blocked by ACTH. This current is very similar to the transient outward current. Calibrations: horizontal, 250 ms; vertical, 100 pA.
(B) Effects of Ang II on outward currents from human zona glomerulosa cells.
(a) Upper panels: whole cell current from 2 representative cells recorded from a holding potential of –90 mV; pulses from –110 to 90 mV (cell 1) and 60 mV (cell 2) are provided. Traces represent current recorded during a 90 mV step before, after 5 min of Ang II application, and 5 to 15 min after removal of Ang II. As can be seen, Ang II decreases the outward current. Reversal could be demonstrated for cell 1. Voltage-clamp steps were applied in 10 mV increments. Standard bath and pipette solutions were used, and Ang II (10 nmol/L) was applied by puffer superfusion for 10 min;

and be comprised predominantly of zona fasciculata-like cells (30). On the other hand, another group has also demonstrated that KCNE1 and KCNQ1 mRNAs are expressed in the adrenal zona glomerulosa where they may directly participate in the control of aldosterone production by plasma K⁺ (27). Mutations of these two genes (KCNQ1 and KCNE1 genes), forming respectively the pore- and regulatory subunits of the slowly activating delayed K⁺ current, Iₖₛ, are associated with higher levels of aldosterone in comparison to wild-type mice (27). This exacerbated aldosterone production in *Kcnel*⁻/⁻ mice is accompanied by abnormal and elevated plasma renin concentrations, which may partly explain the hyperaldosteronism. These studies thus demonstrate how a mutation affecting the selectivity of a potassium channel mediating the inward rectifying currents is responsible for the increase in aldosterone synthesis such as that observed in aldosterone-producing adenomas [reviewed in (87)].

### Voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels are responsible for calcium influx

Electrophysiological properties have identified two major types of Ca²⁺ channels in adrenocortical cells, which can be distinguished by their voltage dependence, kinetics and pharmacology: (1) the T-type or low-voltage-activated (LVA) is a low-threshold transient current found in rat (210, 468, 556, 589-591), bovine (147, 148, 502, 632) and humans (558), and in the Y1 cell line (229, 320, 698). These channels have a fast transient component (Fig. 22A); (2) The L-type current or high-voltage-activated (HVA) is a sustained high-threshold current found in rat (209), bovine (147, 171, 209, 468) and humans (558) and the Y1 cell line (229, 320, 698) (Fig. 22B). Although quantitative differences in the expression of T-type and L-type currents have been reported among glomerulosa cell preparations according to species and culture conditions, current-voltage relationships (I-V curves) derived from whole-cell patch recordings of Ca²⁺ current generally show current peaking at membrane potentials (Vₘ) that are approximately -30 mV for the T-type Ca²⁺ channel, while the L-type Ca²⁺ channel has its peak voltage around +30 mV (209, 441) (Fig. 22A, B). However, L-type currents are more susceptible to rundown and Ca²⁺-induced inactivation and, thus, may be underestimated (290).

Three separate members of the T-type Ca²⁺ channel family (Caᵥ3.x) have been cloned from human and rat tissues. A predominant expression of the α₁H subtype is detected in the zonae glomerulosa and fasciculata of bovine adrenal tissue, whereas its expression is limited to the zona glomerulosa in rat adrenal gland (349, 658). These latter observations have also been confirmed by whole cell voltage-clamp recordings (349, 658) [for review, see (111, 183)]. These T-type LVA Ca²⁺ channels may provide the link between small depolarizations in membrane potential and the influx of extracellular Ca²⁺ due to their low voltage of activation (near -40 mV) and slow deactivation kinetics (658) (Table 3). Among the L-type Ca²⁺ channels (Caᵥ1.x family), mRNA for Caᵥ1.2 (α1C) and Caᵥ1.3 (α1D) are expressed in glomerulosa cells (349, 694) in agreement with inhibition of these HVA currents by dihydropyridines (290). Several reports have identified HVA (L-type) Ca²⁺ currents in isolated bovine fasciculata cells (227, 502, 756) whereas no such current has been identified in rat fasciculata cells (756, 757) [for review, see (658)].

As mentioned above, blockage of K⁺ channels by ACTH and Ang II depolarizes the cell membrane and activates voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels. Numerous data have also shown that this Ca²⁺ influx is blocked by voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channel blockers, such as Co²⁺, Mn²⁺ (which are more selective for T-type channels), verapamil or nifedipine (which are more selective for L-type channels) (107, 385-387). However, the selective effect of ACTH or Ang II on these channels is inconsistent between the various studies. In spite of these divergent results, all studies lead to the conclusion that calcium is essential for adrenocortical cells to trigger steroid secretion [review in (93, 290, 627, 631)].

In rat glomerulosa cells, 10 nmol/L ACTH transiently abolishes T-channel activity and increases the amplitude of the L-type current (209) (Fig. 22C). Application of 8-Br-cAMP induces a similar increase, leading to the conclusion that a PKA-dependent phosphorylation of these L-type channels potentiates the current (209). However, in the Y1 cell line, neither T-type nor L-type channel blockers affect ACTH-induced steroidogenesis (172) while mibefradil, a specific T-channel blocker, inhibits ACTH-induced cortisol secretion in zona fasciculata cells (227). In addition, under conditions where cAMP production is impaired, ACTH also increases the opening probability of the Ca²⁺ conducting channel. This raises the possibility of a cAMP-independent effect of ACTH on L-type currents, as observed for several pathways, especially at low concentrations of ACTH (255, 260). In agreement with these observations, in rat adrenal fasciculata cells, prolonged treatment with a different 8-substituted cAMP analog, the PKA and Epac activator 8-Br-cAMP, fails to enhance the expression of the T-type Ca²⁺ current (43). Conversely, the Epac activator 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyl-cAMP (8CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP), and several of its putative metabolites, enhances the expression of both Caᵥ3.2 mRNA and functional Ca²⁺ channels. Overall, these studies suggest that selected cAMP analogs, including those preferentially activating PKA or Epac proteins, are metabolized to active compounds which stimulate cortisol synthesis by inducing genes that code for steroidogenic proteins (432). One of these mechanisms requires a cAMP-independent activation of Caᵥ3.2 Ca²⁺ channels (222).

The effect of Ang II on T- and L-type Ca²⁺ currents is also the subject of debate. Using the perforated-patch clamp method, it was found that Ang II causes a rapid inhibition of the L-type channel (441) (Fig. 22D). Three min after onset of stimulation with Ang II (10 nmol/L), the amplitude of the L current is inhibited by approximately 46% with no effect on the transient T component (441).

Figure 22 Effect of ACTH and Ang II on Ca²⁺ currents. (A) T-component voltage characteristics, illustrated for a rat glomerulosa cell. The cell was bathed in a 20 mmol/L Ca²⁺ medium. (a) Currents obtained at various voltages from a holding potential of –80 mV. The current activates and inactivates rapidly. (b) Current-voltage relationships measured at the peak. The threshold voltage is –60 mV, the maximum current is obtained at –30 mV and the zero-current voltage is +35 mV. (B) L-component voltage characteristics. The cell was superfused with a 20 mmol/L Ca²⁺ solution. (a) The current begins to be activated at voltages around –20 mV. In this particular cell, after an activation phase, the current is sustained. (b) Current-voltage relationships for the L-component. In a Ca²⁺ medium, the voltage of the maximum current is found at +60 mV and the zero-current voltage can be estimated to be more positive than +100 mV. (C) Effects of ACTH on the T- and L-currents. The holding potential was –80 mV, and voltage step depolarizations up to –10 mV were applied. (a) Trace 1 corresponds to the control current. Traces 2 and 3 are current traces obtained after superfusion with 10 nmol/L ACTH-containing medium. Trace 4 corresponds to the current recorded 4 min after the control medium was resuperfused. (b) Time course of the increase in L-current amplitude induced by ACTH. The current amplitude was measured at the end of the 800-ms voltage step depolarizations before, during and after superfusion of the medium with 10 nmol/L ACTH. The time and the duration of the superfusion are indicated by the horizontal bar. Current amplitudes were normalized to the control current amplitude. Numbers (1–4) refer to the traces in A; the ratios I/IControl are 2.09, 4.26, 11.23, and 13.32, respectively. (D) Ang II modulation of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ currents measured using perforated-patch clamp. Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ current evoked by ramp voltage commands from –128 to 52 mV at a rate of 0.6 mV/ms. Ang II (10 nmol/L) inhibits the second peak of inward current measured at approximately 0 mV within 3 min after the onset of stimulation. L-type Ca²⁺ current measured as the current at the end of a 100 mS square wave voltage command to +7 mV following a 4 s prepulse to –108 mV. In this example, stimulation with 10 nmol/L Ang II for 3 min reduces the L current by 50% without affecting the amplitude or inactivation kinetics of the T current component. The holding potential was –88 mV. Reproduced, with permission, from Figure 2 and 3 (210) (A and B) and Figure 8 (441) (C).
T-channels and Ang II- and K⁺-induced aldosterone secretion. Thus Ang II activates T channels by way of depolarization rather than a direct effect on the T channel. These results indicate that voltage-dependent T-type Ca²⁺ channels represent the primary Ca²⁺ influx pathway activated by physiological concentrations of Ang II and K⁺ although other Ca²⁺ influx pathways must mediate aldosterone secretion induced by high K⁺ or Ang II concentrations (441). This effect is similar to that reported in bovine glomerulosa cells (474). Similar conclusions have been raised from studies using the perforated patch-clamp configuration combined with microfluorimetry to measure Caᵢ. For example, Rossier et al. (630) demonstrated that L-type channels are exclusively responsible for the sustained elevation of Caᵢ observed upon stimulation with extracellular K⁺, even at low physiological concentrations of this agonist. In contrast, aldosterone secretion appears closely related to T-type channel activity. Moreover, when the activity of each channel type is selectively modulated by pharmacological agents such as dihydropyridines (a blocker of L-type Ca²⁺ channel), the Caᵢ response can be clearly dissociated from the steroidogenic response. Similarly, modulation of T channel activation by protein kinase C inhibition results in a parallel inhibition of aldosterone secretion, without any effect on cytosolic free calcium levels. This direct functional link between T-type calcium channel activity and steroidogenesis suggests a model in which calcium entering the cell could bypass the cytosol to activate intramitochondrial steps of aldosterone biosynthesis (630). Studies have also reported that Ang II negatively modulates L-type calcium channels through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein in adrenal glomerulosa cells (446, 474).

### Refilling the intracellular stores through activation of capacitative calcium influx

In addition to cell depolarization and activation of voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels, Ang II and other stimuli operating through PLC-induced Caᵢ release also trigger Ca²⁺ influx in their target cells through stimulation of a capacitative Ca²⁺ influx (631). The ionic currents involved in refilling the intracellular stores are called iCRAC for “calcium release-activated calcium” currents (631). Much of the functional role of the capacitative influx triggered by Ang II in glomerulosa cells has been assessed with the plant extract thapsigargin. Thapsigargin is a specific inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pumps which is widely used for inducing Ca²⁺ store emptying, in a receptor-independent fashion, and therefore induces activation of a capacitative Ca²⁺ influx. In bovine glomerulosa cells, the Ca²⁺ signal, measured 5 min after addition of Ang II, is little affected by blocking T-type Ca²⁺ and L-type Ca²⁺ currents but is eliminated by thapsigargin, and can therefore be attributed to the capacitative influx (17, 100). This iCRAC current appears to be as selective for Ca²⁺ and strongly dependent on the driving force exerted by the membrane potential, the current being reduced upon cell depolarization. This is a particularly key aspect since upon

Ca²⁺ store depletion, capacitative Ca²⁺ influx is optimal when the cell is hyperpolarized. Therefore, if the hormone responsible for Ca²⁺ release simultaneously induces cell depolarization (as is generally the case with Ang II), it will thus reduce the amplitude of the iCRAC current as well as favor the opening of voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels. The Ca²⁺ channel called “transient receptor channel” TRP4 is highly expressed in the bovine adrenal gland (580). Expression of antisense TRP4 cDNA reduces both the endogenous capacitative current and the amount of TRP4 protein, indicating the role of this protein species in bovine adrenocortical cells (580). The TRP-binding site has been described in the cytosolic terminus of the InsP₃ receptor (85). Therefore, the expression of the InsP₃ receptor in glomerulosa cells (228) may have a specific role in controlling Ca²⁺ influx in glomerulosa cells. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the activation of capacitative Ca²⁺ influx by store depletion, among which are Ca²⁺-dependent protein-protein interactions between release and influx channels. However, there are no specific data available for this mechanism in glomerulosa cells [for review, see (628, 629, 631, 683)].

#### Hormonal effects on other permeant channels - effect of ACTH on chloride channels

Chloride channels play an important role in the maintenance of cell volume, water transport and cell membrane potential stabilization (586). A Ca²⁺-dependent chloride current increased by Ang II has been characterized in bovine fasciculata cells (141). In rat glomerulosa cells, application of ACTH results in a transient increase in a chloride current (140). This current is induced by ACTH at concentrations as low as 0.1 pmol/L and is not cAMP-dependent but rather p21Ras-dependent. Interestingly, application of a selective chloride channel blocker and/or of an inhibitor of p21Ras activation decreases aldosterone secretion induced by low stimulating concentrations of ACTH more efficiently than high concentrations, indicating that chloride ions and the p21Ras pathway may play a key role at low concentrations of the hormone when cAMP production is not significant. A similar effect of ACTH has been reported in bovine zona fasciculata although in these cells, the chloride current is cAMP-dependent (207). Moreover, ACTH-induced depolarization observed in bovine fasciculata cells has been shown to be completely reversed by inhibitors of the Cl⁻ current. Other ion channel classes may also contribute to Ang II-induced depolarization. Lotshaw and Li (443) reported that Ang II activates Ca²⁺-permeant, nonselective cation channels, which may contribute to the depolarizing response in rat glomerulosa cells.

### Perspective and conclusions

Both ACTH and Ang II induce rapid depolarization of the cell membrane through inhibition of various types of K⁺ channels, which in turn induce activation of T- and L-type Ca²⁺ channels. The importance of this ionic activity began to emerge as aresult of the selective genetic deletion of ion channels in transgenic mice. In certain instances, these knockout mouse models mimic human disease. For example, combined gene deletion of the background TASK-1 subunits (184, 291) or the voltage-activated K⁺ channel KCNE1 (27) or KCNJ5 (30, 31, 139, 535) subunits results in hyperaldosteronism. Although substantial data support a role for the T-type Ca²⁺ (Caᵥ3.2) channels in the control of steroid hormone production, L-type Ca²⁺ channels of the Caᵥ1.x family are undoubtedly activated in excitable glomerulosa cells, raising the possibility that, as reported in certain subsets of neurons, these channels may support electrical activity in zona glomerulosa cells (209, 210, 558) as well as modulate gene transcription (277, 290). Finally, it is always difficult to conclude on similarities and differences between electrophysiological properties of glomerulosa and fasciculata cells, since there is no study that has compared the two cell types under similar experimental settings.

### Involvement of the Cytoskeleton and Extracellular Matrix in ACTH and Ang II Effects

It has long been established that the three components of the cytoskeleton (actin, tubulin and intermediate filaments) and the extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in adrenal steroidogenesis. The first studies were initially performed using depolymerizing agents such as colchicine for microtubules, cytochalasin for actin filaments and vinblastine for intermediate filaments. Since then, ensuing immunofluorescence investigations have provided a better understanding of the association between cytoskeleton, associated proteins and ECM and how both actively take part or even trigger time-course effects of trophic factors on adrenocortical function. This section is mainly focused on the role of the cytoskeleton in the early events of signaling, rather than on steroidogenesis itself, for which excellent reviews are available (301, 668, 669, 745).

#### Overview of the cytoskeleton and steroidogenesis

In some studies, disruption of microfilaments with cytochalasin was found not to affect the basal release of steroids while decreasing the effects of ACTH or Ang II, whereas in other studies, an increase in steroid secretion was observed. One source for these discrepancies may certainly be the nature of the cells used (primary cells versus cell lines), as well as interspecies variations. Indeed, epithelial-like or polygonal human or rat adrenocortical cells round up and lose substrate attachment as a result of ACTH treatment, whereas similarly-treated cultured bovine adrenal cells do not. In fact, in rat, human and Y1 adrenocortical cells, control cells are characterized by the presence of stress fibers crossing the entire cell volume and the presence of focal adhesions. A one-minute stimulation with ACTH is sufficient to induce a rounded-up appearance of the cells and the formation of an intense ring of actin beneath the cell membrane, correlating with the disappearance of the stress fiber network (167, 168, 599, 602). In Y1 cells, the extent of the rounding-up is correlated with cAMP levels. In contrast, under control conditions, bovine cells already display a rounded-up appearance, which is not affected by ACTH treatment (168, 540). One of the differences which may explain this species discrepancy stems from the composition of the cell membrane. Indeed, bovine adrenocortical cells, in contrast to Y1, rat or human adrenal cells, differ in their non-esterified cholesterol content (602) and display variations in ECM components.

Microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments are involved in the transport of cholesterol from lipid droplets to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria [for review, see (667, 668)]. In this regard, using real-time fluorescence monitoring, active transport of lipid droplets along microtubules and their association with mitochondria have been observed only in cells with a rounded-up appearance (517). Interpretation of this observation may be that the breakdown of actin filaments releases spatial constraints from mitochondria, lipid droplets and lysosomes, thus allowing the latter to interact more efficiently (609). This in turn facilitates enhanced cholesterol supply to mitochondrial P450scc, the first rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis [for review see (668, 669)]. On the other hand, in Y1 cells, murine adrenal cells and bovine fasciculata cells, lipid droplets are attached to vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, thus suggesting a role for lipid droplet trafficking in adrenal cells (301). Using electron microscopy, it was found that actin accumulates in the microvilli and around lipid droplets (436). ACTH stimulation approximately doubles the concentration of actin in the cortical cytoplasm as well as increases the concentration of actin in the microvilli by 50%. The microvillar contribution to the cell surface area is thus 40% higher in ACTH-stimulated cells compared to control cells. In correlation with these observations, in Y1 cells, ACTH/8-Br-cAMP induces a reorganization of caveolin-1 microvilli (called “podosome” by the authors) responsible for the rounded-up appearance of the cells (150). Caveolin-1 (the predominant protein contained in lipid rafts/caveolae, see section related to cholesterol uptake in the adrenal gland) may be implicated in the ACTH-induced transfer of cholesterol from HDL to intracellular compartments for steroidogenesis. These results support the view that the morphological and functional responses to ACTH and PKA activation in steroidogenic cells are related to cytoskeletal dynamics (150), and provide quantitative evidence suggesting that actin and the microvilli are involved even in the initial steps of HDL uptake.

#### Cytoskeleton and associated proteins in signaling

We and others have shown that this rapid redistribution of microfilaments and microtubules at the membrane level
upon ACTH stimulation enhances the quantity of membrane-associated GTP-binding G protein (Gαs or Gαq); these changes being essential for adenylyl cyclase (168) or phospholipase C activation respectively (167). In order to establish a link between the cytoskeleton and steroidogenesis, we and others have investigated the role of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Rho-GTPases, Rho, Rac and Cdc42 are among the key GTP-binding proteins engaged in these processes. Rho and its downstream effector, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), act as regulators of stress fibers and focal adhesion assembly. Rac, on the other hand, regulates the formation of lamellipodia protrusions and membrane ruffles, whereas Cdc42 triggers filopodia at the cell periphery. In particular, Rho and Rac play a pivotal role in cytoskeletal-mediated activation and regulation of MAPK pathways [for review, see (232, 300)]. In the case of ACTH, inhibition of tubulin polymerization has been shown to prevent basal and ACTH/cAMP-stimulated mitochondrial trafficking and to decrease cortisol secretion, which is conversely correlated with a parallel increase in DHEA production (428). Results of this latter study also indicate that ACTH-stimulated mitochondrial movement is dependent on RhoA as well as a RhoA effector known as diaphanous-related homolog 1 (DIAPH1). The authors concluded that ACTH regulates steroid (cortisol or DHEA) production by facilitating specific interorganelle substrate transfer via a process that is mediated at least in part by RhoA and DIAPH1 and act to coordinate the dynamic trafficking of mitochondria (428) [reviewed in (671)].

In the case of Ang II, recent studies have shown that the C-terminus of AT₁R directly and strongly binds to tubulin. A mutation that disrupts tubulin binding dramatically inhibits the cell surface expression of AT₁R, which remains localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (763). From another functional standpoint, we have shown that basal proliferation requires a well-structured organization of actin filaments into stress fibers and specific Rho/ROCK-dependent activation of p44mapk (ERK1), whereas the rounded-up appearance of the cells upon Ang II stimulation is rather associated with the formation of a cortical actin ring and Rac-dependent activation of p42/p44mapk and p38 MAPK (544) (Fig. 23A). These two pathways are important for triggering steroidogenesis, since preincubation of cells with PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK) or with SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK) decreases the expression levels of StAR and of 3β-HSD (Fig. 23B). In addition to these aforementioned examples, many recent studies indicate that several intracellular targets of second messengers are associated with microtubules and microfilaments such as phosphatases, phosphoinositides, diacylglycerol, phospholipase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, also called microtubule-associated protein kinase) (160, 238, 281). Moreover, calcium (Ca²⁺), another important component of steroidogenesis, stimulates the phosphorylation of contractile proteins (such as myosin light chain), which triggers contraction and movement, in association with the intermediate filament protein vimentin (16, 552).

### Link between Cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix

The change from well-attached to rounded-up appearance of the cells upon hormone stimulation, as well as the conversion from F-actin stress fiber organization to a cortical actin ring, indicates a potential hormonal role in cell–matrix interactions (58). The changes in membrane cytoskeletal organization are initiated at focal adhesion sites. In addition to providing a structural link between cells and the extracellular matrix, focal adhesions are important sites for signal transduction (13, 357). Indeed, several scaffolding proteins and protein kinases are localized at these sites, in particular, the non-receptor focal adhesion kinase, pp125Fak (FAK), and paxillin. Upon phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, these proteins provide docking sites for proteins that contain Src homology domains (SH2), which initiate several intracellular cascade pathways (32). Studies performed in either bovine adrenocortical cells (722) or Y1 cells (304) have shown that the rounding-up of cells, following ACTH stimulation, is correlated with both a loss of focal adhesions and a specific decrease in paxillin phosphorylation (304, 599, 722). This dephosphorylation is mediated by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase, SHP2 (523, 620), and is followed by protrusion of filopodial structures. SHP2 itself is activated by PKA-dependent serine phosphorylation (454). Such activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatases (SHP2) by ACTH has been reported to be essential for cAMP-induced corticosterone secretion (745) and transcription of the CYP17 gene (671) [for review, see (160, 281)].

### The extracellular matrix and integrins

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex mixture of matrix molecules, including the glycoprotein fibronectin, collagens, laminins, proteoglycans, and non-matrix proteins such as growth factors. Cell adhesion to the ECM mediates direct interactions of the cell with its extracellular environment. Cell–matrix adhesions are essential for cell migration, tissue organization and differentiation, and as a result, play central roles in embryonic development, remodeling and tissue and organ system homeostasis. Cell adhesion to the ECM transmits information by way of integrin receptors that regulate intracellular signaling via outside-in signaling. Conversely, intracellular signals can induce changes in integrin conformation and activation which alter its ligand-binding activity in a process termed inside-out signaling (58). Clustering of integrin receptors activates non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as FAK, leading to localized increases in tyrosine-phosphorylated protein levels. Serine/threonine kinases including members of the protein kinase C family, lipid kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), as well as phosphatases are involved in protein recruitment to adhesion complexes and thereby selectively link matrix adhesions to various downstream signaling cascades that control cytoskeletal organization, gene regulation as well as diverse cellular processes and functions (58).

Figure 23 Proposed model of interactions between the Ang II AT₁ receptor (AT1-R), the extracellular matrix (ECM), integrins, and the cytoskeleton in adult rat glomerulosa cells. Implication in proliferation and protein synthesis. (A) In control conditions, binding of fibronectin or collagen to integrins promotes solid adhesion of the cells. In these conditions, cells have a flattened polygonal morphology, characterized by a discrete network of thin stress fibers crossing the entire cell and the presence of focal adhesion points evidenced by paxillin labeling, as illustrated by the green fluorescent dots at the membrane level. On the other hand, paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), induce specific activation of actin-associated kinase, RhoA/ROCK. The latter dictates actin cytoskeleton (stress fiber formation) and signaling pathways (such as p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup>), leading to basal cell proliferation and steroid secretion (pathway in green, right portion of A). Ang II induces a rapid but transient formation of an intense F-actin ring at the cell membrane, a disruption of the stress fiber network, and the formation of several thin filopodia in lieu of focal adhesions (cell illustrated in the left portion of panel (A)). These changes are accompanied by a disappearance of paxillin labeling at the membrane level and activation of Rac and p38 MAPK. During Ang II stimulation, p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> is activated but also requires interaction with p38 MAPK to fully increase cell protein content (pathways in pink). (B) Effect of MAPK inhibitors on angiotensin II-induced expression of StAR and 3β-HSD. Glomerulosa cells were cultured for 3 days without or with PD98059 (10 μmol/L) (an inhibitor of MEK) or with SB203580 (10 μmol/L) (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK) introduced 30 min prior to Ang II (5 nmol/L) stimulation. Following hormonal stimulation in the culture medium, cells were processed for Western blot analyses. As can be seen, Ang II increases the expression levels of StAR and of 3β-HSD which are suppressed in cells preincubated with PD98059 (10 μmol/L) or SB203580 (10 μmol/L). These results indicate that p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup> and p38 MAPK play a key role in Ang II-stimulated aldosterone production by enhancing expression of StAR and 3β-HSD proteins.

Following the pioneer studies of Cheng and Hornsby in 1992 (127) demonstrating that the ECM contributes to the maintenance of P450c11 and P450c21 enzymatic activities in cultured bovine adrenal cells, few studies have since been conducted regarding the expression and role of the ECM in the adrenal gland (102, 115, 238, 729). Our laboratory conducted an exhaustive investigation of ECM and integrins in the adult rat adrenal gland (541), which confirmed and extended previous studies performed in bovine cells (565). Our findings revealed that collagen, laminin and fibronectin expression is observed around each glomerulosa cell and as long fibrils between the radial cords of fasciculata cells [see Figs. 1 and 4 from (541)]. In the medulla, fibronectin is present around chromaffin cells or bordering blood vessels (541). However, in the bovine adrenal gland, fibronectin is found surrounding entire glomeruli and as fibrillar structures underlining capillaries and sinusoids, with no labeling surrounding individual glomerulosa cells (565). In bovine (565) and human adrenal cortex (729), on the other hand, laminin has been reported to be uniformly distributed in the zonae glomerulosa, fasciculata and reticularis but was not detected in the capsule or medulla [see Fig. 7 from (565) and Fig. 1 from (238)]. Fibronectin and collagens favor steroid synthesis and secretion in glomerulosa cells, while laminin is primarily involved in cell proliferation. In bovine adrenocortical cells, laminin, which is synthesized under the control of ACTH, stimulates chemotaxis (movement) and haptotaxis (cell migration defined by the migration of cells along a gradient of ECM-bound chemoattractants) (238, 566). In rat adult glomerulosa cells, we have shown that adhesion of glomerulosa cells to fibronectin is able to promote an increase in intracellular calcium, the activation of ERK1/2 (p42/p44<sup>mapk</sup>) as well as stimulate proliferation and aldosterone secretion (102, 543). We have also shown that glomerulosa cells are able to synthesize and secrete fibronectin, a process by which cells can stimulate their own proliferative activity when cultured on a plastic substrate. All these results support previous studies whereby ECM components are among the key factors necessary to promote steroid secretion and basal cell proliferation (127, 238, 359).

Integrins are transmembrane proteins comprised of two subunits, alpha (α) and beta (β), and constitute the predominant family of proteins mediating cell-matrix interactions, responsible for transduction and activation of several intracellular cascades (44, 58, 689). Integrin α5β1 is specific for fibronectin, although integrins α3β1, αvβ3 and αvβ6 can also bind fibronectin. It is also well-known that integrins α1β1, α2β1, α3β1 and αvβ1 can bind collagen by different recognition sites, while laminin binding integrins include α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α6β1 or α6β4 [for review, see (241, 639, 689)]. Results from our laboratory indicate that αV, α5, β1 and β3 subunits are expressed in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells (102, 539). The most striking observation of our study was the specific distribution of integrins between cortex and medulla, as exemplified in the rays containing medullary tissue extending across the cortex. For example, the α1 subunit exhibited strong expression in the medulla and medullary

rays, but was virtually absent in the cortex, while, in contrast, the α3 subunit was strongly expressed in the cortex, and only in a few cells of the medulla [see Fig. 4 from (541)]. This unique distribution of integrins between cortex and medulla indicates that integrin α subunits represent opportune tools for outlining the presence of medullary rays crossing into the cortex, thus corroborating previous observations in rat (262), porcine (82) and human (83) adrenal glands.

In the fetal adrenal gland, a zone-specific gradient of collagen, laminin and fibronectin expression has been demonstrated (113), and is closely correlated with zone-specific functions. Indeed, cells proliferate when grown on laminin, whereas a collagen substratum favors steroid secretion (115). Interestingly, fibronectin is known to favor proliferation when recognized by its high affinity integrin receptor α5β1. However, in the human fetal adrenal gland, there is no typical receptor expressed for fibronectin (113, 394), an observation which may explain why these cells are non-proliferative and are subject to apoptosis (115).

### Evidence for involvement of matricellular proteins and cell adhesion molecules

Other ECM molecules affect cell morphology and function. Among these are ephrins (EphA) and their receptors, which have been identified exclusively in the zona glomerulosa (92). Expression of EphA/Eph receptors has been reported to be enhanced by a low-sodium diet, but reduced by inhibiting the renin-Ang II-system with captopril (an inhibitor of the Ang II-converting enzyme). In addition, ACTH treatment decreases EphA expression while, in contrast, betamethasone which specifically affects the fasciculata/reticularis zone, has no effect on EphA. These observations clearly indicate that Ephrin/Eph receptor signaling may be involved in cell function (92).

Lastly, among the long list of matricellular proteins already identified in several tissues (of which include proteoglycans, growth factors and metalloproteinases, which degrade the ECM), only a selected few have been studied in the adrenal gland. One of these family members, the thrombospondins, are expressed in the bovine adrenal gland and are most likely involved in distinct biological functions in the adrenal cortex, since ACTH induces a dramatic shift in the pattern of adrenocortical cell thrombospondin expression from TSP1 to TSP2-like protein (238, 401). TSP2 promotes attachment but prevents spreading of adrenocortical cells, while the role of TSP-1 in the adrenal gland is not yet known.

### Communications through Gap junctions

There is some evidence that a particular type of channels, called gap junctions, play a regulatory role in adrenal cortical function and that these channels can be modified by trophic factors regulating functional activities of the gland. Gap junction channels facilitate direct intercellular exchange

Steroidogenesis—Adrenal Cell Signal Transduction

cell-cell communication, connexins may have additional roles such as transcriptional and cytoskeletal regulation (269, 470) as well as in cell survival or cell death (392).

### Conclusion

In conclusion, in this section, we highlighted the importance of the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in modulating proliferation and cell function of adrenocortical cells. The various combinations of ECM components and integrins may determine specific cell functions (programmed cell death, proliferation, migration, secretion) not only in the adult (102, 541), but also during development (48, 115). These results raise new questions and are opening new and unexplored fields of investigations in the adrenal gland. For example, since matrix expression gradients are present in the adult gland, we can postulate that the matrix is able to imprint specific cell responses, as observed in the human fetal adrenal gland (115), which could explain the gradient of activity from the capsule to the medulla.

### Interactive Regulation of Adrenal Steroid Secretion

Although ACTH and Ang II are the main regulators of adrenal function, all adrenal steroids can also be regulated by a complex interaction of several systemic and paracrine factors. These factors can emanate from cells of the vascular wall and immune system, or local growth factors and/or neuropeptides secreted from the medulla (211) or imbedded in the innervation network (211, 333, 726). Indeed, the various types of nerve fibers have the capacity to produce both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters and neuropeptides which can act either directly at the adrenal cell level to modulate basal and hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis or indirectly by changing adrenal blood flow (725). For example, cross-talk relationships between the vascular bed and adrenocortical cells may explain how endothelin regulates steroid secretion and proliferation (326, 626) and how ACTH and steroids may regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and thus maintenance of the adrenal microvasculature (252, 353, 431, 678). These factors utilize various signaling pathways to maintain adrenal homeostasis. Thus, a crosstalk between the above multiple stimuli together with various interacting and intricate signaling pathways (inositides-, cAMP-, and growth factor-dependent tyrosine kinase pathways) may be considered, as well as the influence of extracellular matrix and related proteins.

### The neuroendocrinology unit of the adrenal cortex

Among the POMC-derived peptides, it is known that aldosterone and corticosterone outputs are stimulated by α-MSH (194, 198, 358, 372). These steroidogenic effects are mediated by increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) production, and by high concentrations of cAMP. Interestingly, the
two second messengers vary in an opposite manner. Indeed, α-MSH-stimulated IP3 accumulation declines as the activity of adenylyl cyclase increases. Notably, high concentration of α-MSH inhibits Ang II-stimulated aldosterone secretion and InsP3 levels (372). α-MSH has the property to bind four of the five melanocortin receptors; with MC3, MC4 and MC5R being expressed in the adrenal cortex. Using selective agonists and antagonists, Doghman et al. (198) have shown that the effects of NDP-α-MSH are mediated via MC4-R. On the other hand, MC5R expression has been detected in embryonic adrenal cortex receptor (526), but is yet to be documented in the adult gland. As developed earlier in the section related to MRAPs, MC2R (the ACTH receptor) requires MRAPs to reach the cell surface. In a recent study, Sebag et al. (662) have shown that MRAP has the opposite effect on the closely-related MC5R. Indeed, MC5R was found at the plasma membrane in the absence of MRAP, but trapped intracellularly when expressed with MRAP. Moreover, MC3R and MC4R are linked to energy homeostasis, and MC5R is known to be associated with lipid secretion in the sebaceous glands. The physiological impact of these molecular findings in the context of adrenal cortex remains to be established.

The γ-MSHs peptides, derived from the same family, remain less characterized (see Fig. 10 for POMC-derived peptides). Among the three identified peptides, the Lys-γ3-MSH fragment is the most potent activator of ACTH by increasing mitochondrial free cholesterol accumulation. This accumulation may offer a reservoir of substrates entering the steroidogenic pathway upon stimulation by ACTH during a stress response (564). More recent studies indicate that Lys-γ3-MSH is involved in the regulation of HSL activity not only in the adrenal gland, but also in adipocytes and in the heart (66). In addition, some evidence suggests that the human Lys-γ3-MSH fragment may be implicated as a pathogenic stimulus of aldosterone secretion in a subset of patients with primary aldosteronism, particularly among those differentially diagnosed as having idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (289). From these observations, it has been speculated that this fragment may serve as a nonpituitary tumor marker (59) [for review, see (309, 596)]. Finally, recent knowledge suggests that γ-MSH peptides may play a more widespread role in lipid and cholesterol utilization. Of note, γ-MSH binds the melanocortin receptors MC1R, MC4R and MC5R, but with a lower affinity than α-MSH. A specific receptor, distinct from the five known melanocortin receptors has been suggested, although not yet identified (309).

In addition to its growth-promoting effect (426, 480, 560, 561, 709), several studies indicate that arginine-AVP (AVP) stimulates adrenocortical steroid secretion. Following the initial observations by Hilton in dogs (322, 323) and those of Palkovits et al. in rats (549), through the use of hypothalamus-pituitary tract lesions, it was found that AVP stimulates aldosterone secretion directly. These data have been reproduced in several species, including humans (259, 294, 318, 328, 409, 574, 657). Interestingly, AVP stimulates cortisol but not corticosterone secretion. The stimulating effect of AVP is similar to the effect of Ang II in rat and humans, but lower than that observed in bovine glomerulosa cells (71). These effects occur through receptor binding to AVP V1a receptors, Gq protein activation and coupling to a specific phospholipase C cascade [for review, see (258)]. The action of AVP can result from systemic or paracrine action. Indeed, AVP is synthesized and secreted by chromaffin cells and its receptors are either present in the medulla or scattered throughout the cortex (21, 284). Finally, as in many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (399), expression of functional V1a and V2 receptors has been demonstrated in various types of adrenocortical tumors (367, 400, 444, 573, 575, 721).

Among the other factors regulating adrenocortical secretion, serotonin stimulates both aldosterone and cortisol secretion, through 5-HT-4 and 5-HT-7 receptors (158, 414). As in the case of AVP and all other GPCRs, serotonin receptors are overexpressed in adrenocortical tumors (399, 721).

Several neuropeptides and/or neurotransmitters, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (77, 327, 477), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (477, 555), neuropeptide Y (614), calcitonin gene-related peptide and neurotensin are present in the adrenal gland and have been shown to stimulate zona glomerulosa function (both growth and steroid secretion), through a local autocrine-paracrine mechanism of action [for review, see (151, 746)].

Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin receptors have been detected in bovine adrenal cells in culture (567) and are known to negatively modulate ACTH and Ang II responses. IGF-I, acting through its specific receptor, reduces ACTH-induced cAMP production and corticosterone secretion (248, 382). In contrast, long term treatment (3 days) with graded doses of IGF-I increases the number of Ang II receptors and enhances cAMP response to ACTH and Ang II, through an increase in P450c11β and P450c17α-hydroxylases activities (518) and putatively through an increased expression of stimulatory G proteins (53).

Prolactin enhances aldosterone and glucocorticoid production in various mammalian species including rat, guinea pig, mouse, pig and humans (417). Although some studies have shown that prolactin acts via its prolactin receptor coupled to Janus kinase (Jak2) activity (363) and the transcription of adrenal scavenger receptor class B type I via cAMP (510), more recent studies have shown that a lack of prolactin receptors does not affect basal nor stress-induced corticosterone levels in mice (417). Prolactin triggers JAK2/STAT5-dependent transcription in adrenal cells, although it does not influence corticosterone release, even if nuclear JAK2 is an important regulator of the transcriptional activation of the rate-limiting steroidogenic StAR gene (417).

Dopamine (4, 483, 666) (254, 612), somatostatin (8, 10, 611, 612) and atrial natriuretic factor have long been recognized to inhibit stimuli-induced aldosterone secretion, as well as growth of the zona glomerulosa (187, 265, 393, 479). The mechanism of action involves cGMP-dependent and independent processes (550), including inhibition of
calcium-induced StAR gene transcription (129). On the other hand, somatostatin decreases Ang II-induced aldosterone production through Gi-dependent inhibition of cAMP production (313), while dopamine acts, at least partly, via inactivation of the T-type Ca²⁺ current (204).

Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is a potent inhibitor of differentiated adrenocortical cell functions. In primary cultures of ovine adrenocortical cells, TGFβ inhibits ACTH-induced cAMP production and steroid production by inhibiting the steroidogenic activity of at least P450c17α-hydroxylase, P450c11β and P450c21 and by decreasing the number of ACTH receptors (603). The inhibition of steroidogenesis can be dissociated from any effect on cell proliferation, and occurs distally to the formation of cAMP but proximal to the formation of cholesterol (347). Published data indicate that TGFβ acts on the utilization of cellular cholesterol pools and not by direct action on the P450scc. TGFβ also stimulates the production of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (365) in bovine adrenocortical cells (677). In this way, TGFβ contributes to an increased accumulation of growth factor-binding proteins in the extracellular matrix. Together, these results suggest that in the adrenal gland, TGFβ or TGFβ-like proteins may play an important role in modifying the differentiated state of the adrenocortical cell.

When tested in H295R cells, low density lipoproteins (LDL) increase Ang II-induced aldosterone production, thus explaining the increased aldosterone/renin ratio observed in hypertensive patients (405). Native HDL and conjugated HDL also enhance steroid release from Ang II-sensitized cells, with glycoxidized HDL having the greatest impact (708). These modified forms of HDL induce a significant increase in scavenger receptor (SR-BI) expression and utilize protein kinase C as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) as downstream effectors to stimulate aldosterone release. Native HDL and modified HDL also require JAK2 for burden of the increased demand in steroidogenesis (643). Similar effects have been reported with native, glycoxidized and oxidized VLDL when tested in primary cultures of human adrenal cells (642). These forms of VLDL significantly increase the expression of aldosterone synthase, partially through SR-BI. Other lipids, such as linoleic acid, the most prevalent of polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as certain lipid derivatives such as 12,13-epoxy-9-keto-10-trans-octadecenoic acid (EKODE) (97, 278) or sphingosine-1-phosphate, have been shown to stimulate aldosterone secretion (94, 548). While specific receptors for lipids have been identified (i.e. the non-esterified fatty acid receptor (FFAR) receptor family, which includes GPR40) (95, 497, 693), their presence is yet to be confirmed in the adrenal cortex. Together, the above findings support the clinical observations that humans with visceral adiposity have higher plasma aldosterone levels than controls, and that visceral obesity is strongly associated with arterial hypertension (279, 280, 405). Furthermore, patients with type 2 diabetes manifest significant abnormalities in lipoprotein structure and function, which may also link fatty acids and their derivatives with increased steroid secretion (94, 405, 642-644, 752).

### Crosstalk between adrenal gland and adipose tissue

There is some evidence suggesting the existence of cross-talk relationships between adipose tissue and the adrenal gland (212). Indeed, in addition to the well-developed adipose tissue surrounding the adrenal gland, adipocytes have frequently been observed in proximity to adrenal vessels or as clusters in the zona glomerulosa and fasciculata (212). These adipocytes produce mineralocorticoid-releasing factors in sufficient concentrations to stimulate aldosterone secretion. This adipocyte aldosterone-releasing activity is not associated with Ang II since it is not inhibited by candesartan (an AT₁R blocker) in a rat model of metabolic syndrome (514). However, identification and further characterization of these factors largely remain to be explored. Adiponectin, an adipokine, is expressed in the adrenal cortex. In human adrenocortical H295R cells, adiponectin increases cortisol secretion (606) through an increased expression of key steroidogenic pathway genes including StAR protein expression, using ERK1/2 and AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways. On the other hand, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that leptin, acting through the Ob-Rb receptor, inhibits ACTH-induced aldosterone, cortisol and DHEA secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (212, 271). This inhibitory effect is critical during the neonatal period where adrenal hyporesponsiveness to stress is required (646, 713). Together these effects suggest a key role of adipokines in the integration of metabolic activity and energy balance partly via the regulation of adrenal steroid production (271, 457, 606).

### Role of the adrenal gland in the development of metabolic disorders

Several features of metabolic disorders are commonly associated with morphological and functional changes of the adrenal cortex. In particular, it is well recognized that abnormal aldosterone secretion, as observed in primary aldosteronism, leads to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (154, 196, 251, 485, 740). Furthermore, an association between enlarged adrenal glands and type 2 diabetes has been reported in obese patients (272). Adrenal gland weight is also higher in rats fed a high fat diet (581). On the other hand, patients with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia display an increased incidence of hyperandrogenism and PCOS as well as metabolic abnormalities, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. In classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the decrease in glucocorticoid synthesis (due to a deficiency in 21-hydroxylase activity), with resulting impairment in glucocorticoid feedback inhibition, leads to increased ACTH release and adrenal hyperplasia which increases the production of glucocorticoid precursors and androgens (123). In addition, while acute stress, characterized by an important but

transient increase in glucocorticoids, induces nonesterified fatty acid mobilization and decreased food intake, moderate but sustained chronic stress on the other hand is associated with chronic cortisol secretion, preference for comfort food (180, 181) and endocrine, metabolic, and hemodynamic abnormalities (72, 395). Chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels redistribute fat from subcutaneous depots to visceral adipose tissue (180), which is closely correlated with abdominal obesity, a critical feature of the metabolic syndrome (191). Indeed, the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD1) is able to convert inactive cortisone to cortisol, thereby increasing local glucocorticoid action. Even though this action may occur in a number of peripheral tissues, this activity occurs mainly at the level of visceral adipose tissue. In obesity, 11βHSD1 activity in subcutaneous adipose tissue is increased, putatively explaining the link between obesity and other features of the metabolic syndrome (122, 267, 731). Moreover, recent studies have established a direct correlation between food-induced circadian variation in plasma cortisol, adrenal secretion and extra-adrenal cortisol regeneration. This mechanism may contribute to the physiological interplay between insulin and glucocorticoids and the contrasting effects of certain diets on postprandial metabolism (687). There is also evidence for a correlation between sleep disturbance, dysregulation of the HPA axis and cortisol secretion (718). In rats, paradoxical sleep deprivation increases POMC expression in the hypothalamus and increases ACTH and corticosterone secretion as well as relative adrenal weight (691). Thus, chronic stress and sleep disturbance are both associated with hyperactivity of the adrenal gland, the resultant being increased glucocorticoid secretion inducing food intake and weight increase which in turn leads to insulin and leptin resistance.

Below are two examples illustrating, on the one hand, strategies used by the adrenal gland to circumvent oxidative stress associated with high demand of steroidogenesis and, on the other, the negative impact of hormonal interaction on health.

### Protection against reactive oxygen species

Another mechanism by which ACTH may be involved in steroid secretion is through induction of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), also called seladin-1 (for SElective Alzheimer Disease INdicator 1) (288, 648). Indeed, DHCR24 is one of the most expressed genes in the adrenal gland (351, 598). Seladin-1 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic protein exerting a dual role in cholesterol metabolism, steroidogenesis regulation and in the protection of adrenocortical cells against negative side-effects resulting from intense steroidogenesis, resulting in oxidative cellular stress. These functions implicate the Δ-24 reductase activity of Seladin-1, which prevents desmosterol accumulation (Fig. 25A). Desmosterol is recognized as a major negative regulator of the cholesterol metabolic pathway (758). In human and rat adrenocortical cells, Seladin-1 protein expression has been shown to be more abundant in fasciculata/reticularis cells than in glomerulosa cells and that ACTH treatment increases its expression (49, 50). Our group (49, 50) reported that although basal glucocorticoid secretion is lower in rat than in humans, ACTH-induced glucocorticoid stimulation is dramatically increased in rats (corticosterone: 26-fold) comparatively to humans (cortisol: 5-fold). Concomitantly, we showed that in rat fasciculata/reticularis cells, the important surge in glucocorticoid following ACTH stimulation favors the translocation of Seladin-1 from the cis-Golgi localization to the nucleus in order to exert protective effects against high corticosterone secretion. However, in humans, Seladin-1 acts at the cytoplasmic level, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum, to support ACTH-induced DHEA production (but not cortisol production). Since ACTH-induced relocalization of the Seladin-1 protein to the nucleus is not observed in humans and because ACTH-induced glucocorticoid secretion is magnified in rats compared to humans, it has been proposed that oxidative cellular stress generated by steroid production in the human adrenal gland is not as significant impact-wise comparatively to steroid-induced superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the rat adrenal gland. These results hence support a species-dependent role of Seladin-1 activity in steroid secretion of the adrenal gland (Fig. 25B).

In keeping with the above observations, it has been previously observed that in comparison to other steroidogenesis enzymes, P450c11β, the rate limiting enzyme for corticosterone production, is a significant source of oxygen radicals. Indeed, the coupling of P450c11β with NADPH produces high levels of superoxide and other ROS (608). A strong antioxidant system may thus be required in the rat adrenal cortex in order to ensure 11β-hydroxylase protection and sustained corticosterone production. Accordingly, it is recognized that the adrenal gland is the organ containing the highest concentrations of antioxidants (308), and that ACTH is known to protect adrenocortical cells against oxidative stress in bovine cells (137), as opposed to human fasciculata cells (466). In line with these observations, Martinez and colleagues evidenced in the early 2000s, the presence of a protein regulated by ACTH and highly expressed in the zona fasciculata of adrenal glands. This protein, termed mouse vas deferens protein or aldose reductase-like protein (Akr1b7) is aimed at scavenging by-products of side-chain cleavage of cholesterol and lipid peroxidation (418, 554). Moreover, AKR1B7 displayed greater expression within adrenal glands of rodents and rabbits in comparison to humans, thus suggesting that steroidogenesis-induced byproducts detoxification may be of greater importance in rodents than in humans (466, 554). Such results indicate that, in addition to being a leading source of oxidative stress (341, 418), ACTH is also able to activate pathways involved in the protection against self-oxidative stress (Fig. 25B). Finally, in addition to playing a protective role against toxic aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation and steroidogenesis, it has been shown that a decrease in the cAMP-regulated AKR1B1 is associated with adrenocortical cancer (416).

Figure 25 Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of action of Seladin-1 in adrenocortical cells. (A) Seladin-1, also named 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), is involved in the late steps of cholesterol synthesis (8), since it is known to catalyze the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol (737). In humans, mutations of the DHCR24 gene result in a rare and severe recessive autosomal disorder called desmosterolosis. This pathology is characterized by desmosterol accumulation in plasma and tissues, by multiple congenital anomalies, and by severe mental retardation. (B) Seladin-1 may play a dual role in the regulation of steroidogenesis and in the protection of adrenocortical cells against negative side-effects resulting from intense steroidogenesis. Indeed, under control condition, basal steroid production is not significantly affected by Seladin-1 localized in the cytoplasm. However, under ACTH stimulation, there is activation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, with possible accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and reactive aldehyde metabolites, all of which generate important oxidative stress. In this instance, nuclear Seladin-1 may be involved in the protection of adrenocortical cells, due to its ability to bind both the tumor suppressor p53 and the E3-ubiquitin-ligase Mdm2, and its ability to displace Mdm2 from p53. Seladin-1 protects p53 from Mdm2-induced degradation thus enabling its accumulation. By modulating p53-Mdm2 interplay, nuclear Seladin-1 may thus adapt the cell's responses to various stressors, including metabolic stress, these cells having to constantly choose between adaptation to stress or apoptosis.

Steroidogenesis—Adrenal Cell Signal Transduction

Hormonal interaction in a common disease:  
Polycystic ovary syndrome and insulin resistance  

PCOS is a common condition affecting 6% to 10% of women of childbearing age and is also a major health issue for young women, as the prevalence of insulin resistance and metabolic disorders (206, 419) are much higher in PCOS than in normal healthy women. PCOS is defined by hyperandrogenism, the cardinal feature of the syndrome. Although androgens mostly originate from the ovaries (60%), adrenal gland contribution is nonetheless noteworthy (40%), and thus participates in the establishment of the syndrome (193). Although another key characteristic of PCOS is its increased adrenal responsiveness to ACTH (408) (and luteinizing hormone by ovaries), it has been shown that treatments improving insulin resistance in lean and obese women with PCOS curbs this exaggerated androgenic response (33), suggesting that such hyperresponsiveness is probably due to factor(s) related to insulin sensitization rather than pituitary hormones or ovarian steroids *per se*. Indeed, insulin increases basal and ACTH-stimulated production of androgens or expression of P450c17 in cultured normal adrenal cells (390, 396). Another factor important to consider is lipotoxicity. Lipotoxicity refers to the adverse cellular consequences of nonesterified fatty acid, leading to global metabolic insulin resistance and diabetes (76). Lipotoxicity is also proposed to directly trigger androgen overproduction *in vivo* (456) and *in vitro* in fasciculata/reticularis adrenal cells through inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway (56) as potential mode of action. Although the exact cellular mechanisms by which lipotoxicity and insulin regulate androgenesis are not well understood, potential pathways are purportedly described in recent reviews (42, 55).

### Challenges and Perspectives

As shown in the examples depicted above, it is becoming increasingly evident that: (1) each hormone triggers several complex and interconnected signaling pathways, (2) intracellular targets may be regulated by several isoforms of the same regulators, each having their own properties (i.e., various adenylyl cyclases, protein kinases C, and PDEs), and (3) signaling occurs in microdomains, rather than in an uniform manner throughout the entire cell. In the next few paragraphs, noteworthy examples are considered in light of the knowledge often accumulated from studies outside the adrenal gland.

### Integrative signaling pathways

#### Extracellular signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) ($p42/p44^{mapk}$ pathway) as integrative platforms

Evidences support the hypothesis of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) as potential sites of intracellular signal integration in the adrenal gland, linking a host of extracellular and intracellular signals to specific biological responses in the adrenal gland (cell proliferation, cell survival, cell migration, synthesis, and secretion) (112, 330). Thus, ERK1/2 has the potential and format to represent these common targets with multiple biological effects in the adrenal gland. As summarized in Figure 1 from Hoeflich (330), several hormones or factors stimulate ERK1/2 expression. Although not well explored in the adrenal cortex aside from a few exceptions (621), one important aspect to consider is the time-course and sequential events of ERK1/2 activation and deactivation in response to stimuli. In particular, the magnitude and duration of ERK1/2 activity are both linked to the activity of phosphatases capable of prompting MAPK dephosphorylation. MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) constitute a family of dual specificity phosphatases specifically involved in the dephosphorylation of all MAPK family members. Mammalian MKP family members can be divided in two broad classes. One group, including mainly MKP-1, is comprised of nuclear enzymes rapidly induced by growth factors or stress signals (368). The second group, including MKP-3, is predominantly comprised of cytosolic enzymes induced with delayed kinetics by specific stimuli, but not by environmental stress (281, 368). Sewer and Waterman notably analyzed the hormonal regulation of MKP-1 in human adrenocortical cells. The authors described that in H295R human adrenocortical cells, ACTH induces MKP-1 protein and mRNA levels and that MKP-1 can be phosphorylated by PKA action both in vivo and in vitro assays [see Fig. 6 of (671) and for review, see (281, 670)].

#### Protein kinase C and cytoskeleton as integrative platforms

PKC mediates various integrin-cytoskeleton signaling. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 from (13), $PKC\epsilon$ is able to bind directly and indirectly with the actin cytoskeleton by an association with other proteins such as integrins as well as participate in cell adhesion, attachment and spreading to the extracellular matrix. $PKC\epsilon$ also mediates cell adhesion to various extracellular matrices via integrin-dependent signaling. For example, Ang II-induced adhesion to type I collagen occurs via $PKC\epsilon$-mediated $\beta 1$-integrin activation in cardiac fibroblasts. $PKC\epsilon$ may also participate in cell motility and cell-cell contact (13).

#### Implication of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin in adrenocortical tumors

The Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway is present and necessary for adrenocortical development, structural maintenance of the adult gland and steroidogenic functionality (213, 378) (61) (see section on organogenesis). Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling maintains the undifferentiated state and adrenal fate of adrenocortical progenitor cells, in part through induction of its target genes Dax1, SF-1, and inhibin-$\alpha$ (61, 295, 500). Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway and transfection of a constitutively active $\beta$-catenin mutant in H295R cells both induce StAR reporter gene activity (653), adding to a

Comprehensive Physiology

Steroidogenesis—Adrenal Cell Signal Transduction

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Figure 26 Schematic illustrations of putative selective signaling platforms which may implicate protein kinase C (PKC), A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), various isoforms of adenyl cyclases (ACs), phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and other scaffolds. AKAPs can localize many signaling proteins in specific locations within the cell, creating preferential interactions on the scaffold (AKAPs can increase the rate at which signal transduction occurs or increase the magnitude of the signal response). Similar platforms and interaction in the adrenal gland could be anticipated from the information provided in many studies. For example, it is known that AKAP79/150 can associate with K⁺ voltage-dependent channels (such as KCNQ2), together with protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) or PP2A (a) and PKC; AKAP79/150 can link adenyl cyclases with protein kinase A and L-type Ca²⁺ channels, creating a particular platform of signaling (b); AKAP350 has been shown to associate with ACs, and a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D3 (c). AKAP79 or other specific AKAPs can interact with PKC (d), Rho, Rac and cytoskeleton (e). Studies have shown that the link between hormone-induced minimal cAMP levels and activation of cholesterol transport necessary for steroid synthesis, at the level of mitochondria, involves a protein called peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)-associated protein (PAP7) (f). According to the authors, this protein functions as an AKAP, critical in cAMP-dependent steroid formation (434).

rapidly expanding list of signaling molecules that modulate adrenocortical steroidogenesis. Mutation of the components of the Wnt pathway are frequently found in adrenocortical tumors and carcinomas were β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus (121, 700, 701) (62). Inhibiting the activation of the complex transcription factors involved in cell cycle (Tcf)/β-catenin reduces H295R proliferation both in basal conditions and in conditions where SF-1 is overexpressed (197). In a cohort of 118 patients presenting with aldosterone-producing adenomas or carcinomas and harboring a β-catenin mutation, recent studies have shown that abnormal cytoplasmic and/or nuclear β-catenin localization is frequent in both types of tumors (60). Of note, cytoplasmic/nuclear localization in carcinomas was reported to be associated with poor survival in comparison to patients harboring a membranous localization (315). Without doubt, identification of genes up-or down-regulated in aldosterone-stimulating conditions will become an important tool to identify those that may be implicated in aldosteronism and aldosterone-related metabolic diseases (527).

### Signaling microdomains should be considered

The possibility of nonuniform cellular cAMP accumulation was raised several years ago. In many tissues, albeit not yet explored in the adrenal cortex, cellular localization of all components of the cAMP cascade likely contributes to the generation of signaling microdomains. For example, it is becoming increasingly evident that the freely diffusible second messenger cAMP can transduce specific responses by localized signaling. Direct evidence for the presence of local cAMP pools and involvement of PDEs in the control of these pools has recently been obtained with the use of probes monitoring subcellular cAMP localization (159). Adenylate cyclases are also localized at discrete regions of the plasma membrane, and PDEs can be targeted to selected subcellular compartments. Furthermore, most interactions of PKA with kinases and phosphatases are mediated by scaffold proteins termed A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are signaling scaffolds that interact with PKA, protein kinase C, phosphatases as well as PDEs which anchor these complexes in

defined subcellular domains (192, 286, 743). Some examples that could occur in the adrenal gland are given in Figure 26 (159). AKAPs are now considered as potential drug targets (108, 159, 712, 761). These and other observations [reviewed in (761)] are consistent with the notion that cAMP does not stimulate PKA or channels at a distance from the site of synthesis, thus suggesting that diffusion in a cell is somehow reduced or prevented.

### Important questions still to be resolved

Several aspects of adrenal gland physiology and regulation still raise unanswered questions. For instance, what is the basis for the difference observed in aldosterone sensitivity to Ang II in rat (2-fold), human (4-5 fold), and bovine cells (10-15 fold)? Why do fasciculata cells have such distinctive morphological features comparatively to glomerulosa cells, especially since the latter are derived from the former? Is the intimate interplay between extracellular matrix/integrins/cytoskeleton and hormonal signaling the key interacting component behind the differential physiological responses (proliferation, migration, and apoptosis/cell death) observed in the various zones of the adrenal gland? If this were the case, cell responses to external stimuli could be virtually unhampered since several types of interactions between extracellular environment, cytoskeletal associated proteins, adaptor proteins, and intracellular pathways could modulate such responses.

### Conclusion

Several studies have already shown that, in excess, angiotensin II, cortisol, and aldosterone are involved in hypertension, all of which, upon chronic stimulation, raise the susceptibility of developing metabolic syndrome in addition to cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, in humans, it is now clearly documented that various types of chronic stress are associated with a level of basal cortisol which may be associated with development of central obesity and other endocrine, metabolic, and hemodynamic abnormalities (625). Given that the adrenal gland is the foremost source of steroid production, these observations all highlight the relevance of exploring and understanding how the adrenal gland may be involved in overall homeostasis (Fig. 27). Furthermore, due to the importance of fetal and neonatal imprinting, there is increasing evidence that several of the metabolic dysfunctions found in the adult result from fetal and neonatal programming (732). As witnessed by the compelling effect exerted by the inactivation of certain proteins—such as SF-1, DAX-1, StAR, or the more recently identified background ionic channel (TASK-1)—on adrenal gland architecture and function, the study and elucidation of these interconnected factors and modulators as well as their mechanisms of action are, therefore, of prime importance. In addition, abnormal expression of many G-protein-coupled receptors in the adrenal gland or abnormal expression and/or functionality of certain signaling pathways such as Lys-γ3-MSH, connexin 43, or Wnt are associated with

**Figure 27** Involvement of adrenal glands in the development of metabolic disorders. The adrenal gland is responsible for the production of hormones that play an essential role not only in reaction to stress (glucocorticoids and adrenalin) but also in the development of high blood pressure (aldosterone), obesity and insulin resistance (glucocorticoids), thus associated with stress-related metabolic dysfunctions. There is also evidence that chronic stress and sleep disturbance are both associated with hyperactivity of the adrenal gland, the resultant being increased glucocorticoid secretion inducing food intake and weight increase which in turn leads to insulin and leptin resistance. These observations all highlight the relevance of exploring and understanding how the adrenal gland, being the foremost source of steroid production, may be involved in the overall homeostasis.

development of cancers. In this manner, it remains important to explore all of the prevailing unanswered questions such as identification of specific lipid receptors or selective local increases in signaling. Investigating the mechanisms underlying these pathways in a more in-depth manner may prove useful in developing new therapeutic tools and strategies.
