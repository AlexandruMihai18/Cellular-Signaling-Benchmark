LIPID METABOLIC ENZYMES:  
EMERGING DRUG TARGETS FOR  
THE TREATMENT OF OBESITY  

Yuguang Shi* and Paul Burn*†  

Obesity is a complex disease that is regulated by both central and peripheral mechanisms. New medicines for the treatment and prevention of obesity will need to overcome the powerful compensatory responses of the overlapping, and often redundant, networks that have evolved to safeguard efficient energy use. Despite great progress in the identification of central signals that regulate satiety, and considerable investment in the development of appetite-controlling medications, success has been modest so far. Here we review the main enzymes that are involved in different stages of lipid metabolism — from digestion and absorption through synthesis and storage to mobilization and oxidation — which might be successfully targeted by new pharmacotherapies.

**DYSLIPIDAEMIA**  
Disorders in lipoprotein metabolism, which are classified as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, combined hyperlipidaemia and low levels of high-density lipo-protein (HDL) cholesterol.

**Obesity** is the most common nutritional disorder in the developed world and is associated with important co-morbidities, including **type 2 diabetes**, insulin resistance, **DYSLIPIDAEMIA**, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, gall bladder disease, sleep apnoea, **osteoarthritis**, HYPERURICAEMIA and cancer. Obesity increases the likelihood of death by 20%¹ and recently surpassed smoking as the number one cause of death in the United States. The few medications that are available for the treatment of obesity have minimal efficacy and poor side-effect profiles. As such, there is an urgent need for the development of new pharmacotherapies.

There are four general strategies by which the treatment and/or prevention of obesity might be accomplished². The first — appetite suppression — acts centrally to stimulate the release of ANOREXIGENIC signals or to block OREXIGENIC signals. Sibutramine (Meridia; Abbott), which is one of the two medicines that are presently approved for the long-term treatment of obesity, is an appetite suppressant. Peripheral targets form the basis of the remaining three strategies. In the first, inhibitors of nutrient digestion and absorption reduce energy intake through gastrointestinal mechanisms and do not directly alter brain chemistry. Orlistat (Xenical; Roche), which is the only other drug that is presently marketed as a long-term obesity treatment, is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor that reduces the absorption of dietary fat. In the second approach, stimulators of fat mobilization and metabolism reduce fat mass by decreasing triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and deposition in fat stores. In the third, enhancers of energy expenditure act peripherally to increase lipid oxidation or thermogenesis by uncoupling fuel metabolism from the generation of ATP, thereby dissipating energy as heat.

**Peripheral targets**  
A growing number of enzymes that are involved in lipid metabolic pathways are being identified and characterized. Here we summarize recent developments in our understanding of lipid digestion, absorption, deposition, storage, mobilization and oxidation, and assess the potential of lipid metabolic enzymes as targets for the treatment of obesity (FIG. 1). We focus on enzymes that have been implicated in regulating obesity through two main lines of investigation: first, studies of animal models that overexpress or harbour deletions of genes that encode enzymes; and second, genetic and/or familial studies of obesity in humans. We also consider enzymes that are druggable (based on the activity of existing small-molecule inhibitors/activators) or

These differences probably influence the effect of animal and vegetable fats on body weight (see below). Dietary TAG undergoes a series of complex biochemical processes before entering intestinal cells and being transported into the circulation (FIG. 2). Although many of these processes are not well characterized at the molecular level, they represent a rich pool of potential therapeutic targets for obesity and other metabolic disorders.

Gastric and pancreatic lipases. Fat digestion is initiated in the stomach, where TAGs are partially broken down to sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs) by lingual and gastric lipases⁴. Hydrolysis is completed in the small intestine through EMULSIFICATION with bile salts and the action of pancreatic lipase⁵. The products of hydrolysis — FFAs and sn-2-monoacylglycerol (MAG) — are absorbed into enterocytes that line the brush border of the small intestine⁶ (FIG. 2).

Lingual lipase is secreted from von Ebner’s glands and has an OROSENSORY role for TAG⁷; it contributes little to fat digestion in the stomach owing to its optimal activity at pH 5.4 and its low level of expression in humans. By contrast, gastric lipase is stable and active at an acidic pH, and is the main source of lipase activity in the stomach, which accounts for 10–30% of dietary fat hydrolysis⁸. In the absence of pancreatic lipase, 50–70% of TAG is hydrolysed by gastric and lingual lipases⁹; this potentially limits the effect of inhibiting pancreatic lipase alone. Physiological evidence shows that gastric lipase retains activity in the duodenum and acts in synergy with pancreatic lipase¹⁰.

Pancreatic lipase is the principal lipolytic enzyme in the small intestine, where it is secreted in excess. It is inhibited by bile acids, although this can be overcome by the binding of pancreatic colipase¹¹; this interaction allows dietary fat to be hydrolysed efficiently at the water-lipid interface. Colipase is secreted by the exocrine pancreas as a precursor molecule, procolipase, which is processed to mature colipase by cleavage of the procolipase propeptide (APGPR). This propeptide might function as a satiety signal in humans and rodents¹².

Orlistat — also known as tetrahydrolipstatin — is a potent, specific and irreversible inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic lipases, and has no effect on other hydrolases¹³. It is a chemically synthesized derivative of lipstatin (TABLE 1), which is a natural product of Streptomyces toytricini¹⁴. The drug reduces fat absorption by ~30% and is almost completely excreted by the faecal route¹⁵. Orlistat forms a covalent bond with the active serine of gastric and pancreatic lipases in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, which prevents the hydrolysis of dietary fat into absorbable FFAs and MAG¹⁶. Inactivation of the lipases occurs preferentially at the oil-water interface and is accelerated by bile salts. In orlistat-treated patients, levels of both cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein are markedly reduced, which supports a role for TAG hydrolysis in cholesterol absorption¹⁷.

Large multi-centre randomized clinical trials have shown that orlistat is effective in treating obesity for up to two years¹⁸. The drug is also used in weight maintenance, and in treating diabetic patients for weight

Figure 1 | Adipocytes at the crossroads of energy homeostasis. Adipose tissue, which is the main energy storage site, is responsive to both central and peripheral metabolic signals by regulating lipid storage and mobilization. Dietary fat is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract in the form of circulating chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), part of which is metabolized to provide energy and the rest of which enters the liver and adipose tissues for short- and long-term storage, respectively. As a gauge of the level of energy reserves, adipose tissues secrete several adipokines, such as leptin, which regulates energy homeostasis by signalling to the brain and peripheral tissues. Adipose tissues, through the lipolysis and re-esterification process, are also the main sites for fatty-acid cycling, thereby securing the energy supply to oxidative tissues, such as skeletal muscle and the heart. The liver has an important role as a homeostat for transient energy fluctuation; it protects other tissues from POSTPRANDIAL TRIGLYCERIDAEMIA by temporarily storing FAs from the circulation as a benign derivative, triacylglycerol (TAG), and secreting them as VLDL when the period of maximum lipid load has passed. The liver is also an important site for energy conversion, exchanging energy sources from one form to another, such as glycogen to glucose, fatty acid to TAG and saturated fatty acid to unsaturated fatty acid.

potentially druggable; the latter is inferred from sequence/structure homology to other enzymes that have been successfully targeted by small molecules.

**Digestion and absorption of dietary fat**

Consumption of a Western diet that is rich in animal fats is an important contributor to the obesity epidemic³. Dietary fats are present mainly as mixed TAGs, which comprise one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acid. Many fats of animal origin are composed of saturated fatty acids — predominantly palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions — whereas vegetable oils contain mainly unsaturated fatty acids (70% linoleic acid (C18:2) at the sn-2 position).

Figure 2 | The process of dietary lipid digestion and absorption. Dietary lipid digestion begins in the stomach, where lipids are subjected to partial digestion by gastric lipase and form large fat globules with hydrophobic triacylglycerol (TAG) cores surrounded by polar molecules, including phospholipids (PLs), cholesterol (CL), fatty acids (FAs) and ionized proteins. The digestive processes are completed in the intestinal lumen, where large emulsions of fat globules are mixed with bile salts (BS) and pancreatic juice containing lipid digestive enzymes to form an aqueous suspension of small fatty droplets to maximize exposure to the pancreatic lipases for lipid hydrolysis. Monoacylglycerol (MAG), diacylglycerol (DAG) and free FAs that are released by lipid hydrolysis join BS, CL, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and fat-soluble vitamins to form mixed micelles that provide a continuous source of digested dietary products for absorption at the brush-border membranes of the enterocytes. b | FAs and MAG enter the enterocytes by passive diffusion and are facilitated by transporters, such as intestinal FA-binding protein (IFABP), CD36 and FA-transport protein-4 (FATP4). They are then re-esterified sequentially inside the endoplasmic reticulum by MAG acyltransferase (MGAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) to form TAG. Phospholipids from the diet as well as bile — mainly LPA — are acylated by 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) to form phosphatidic acid (PA), which is also converted into TAG. Dietary CL is acylated by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) to cholesterol esters (CE). Facilitated by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), TAG joins CE and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) to form chylomicrons (CM) that enter circulation through the lymph.

Pancreatic phospholipase A2 (pPLA2). pPLA2 is secreted from the pancreas in response to food intake. It catalyses the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the sn-2 position, which generates FFAs and lysophospholipids. Phospholipids are the second most abundant type of lipid in the intestinal lumen²⁰ and most (90%) are derived from bile. The hydrolysis of intestinal phospholipids facilitates the formation of mixed micelles (FIG. 2) and is required for the efficient absorption of both TAG and cholesterol. This has been confirmed in knockout mice with pPLA2 deficiency, which are indistinguishable from wild-type controls when fed regular chow, but are resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO)²¹. Surprisingly, an increased amount of TAG, but not diacylglycerol (DAG) and MAG, is excreted in the faeces of knockout mice²¹, which indicates that pPLA2 deficiency has a greater effect on the digestion of TAG than on the absorption of DAG and MAG.

By contrast, phospholipid hydrolysis and absorption are not affected, possibly as a result of compensation by other PLA2 enzymes or by the feedback regulation of secretins²²,²³. pPLA2 has intrinsic secretin-releasing activity that is independent of its enzymatic activity²³. Secretin regulates pancreatic exocrine and gastric

secretion, as well as gastric motility, which might affect fat digestion — as evidenced by defective dietary fat digestion in mice that are deficient in aquaporin-1 water channels²⁴. pPLA2 is also expressed in other tissues, such as liver²⁵, where its functional role in energy homeostasis remains to be determined.

pPLA2 belongs to the group-1 class B-type secretory phospholipases (sPLA2s). These constitute a subtype of the phospholipase-A2 superfamily, with at least 19 distinct members that are grouped into three main subfamilies: the secretory PLA2s (sPLA2s), the cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2s) and the Ca²⁺-independent PLA2s (iPLA2s)²⁶. pPLA2 is one of the most extensively studied phospholipases in terms of structure and mechanism of action²⁷, yet its pharmaceutical potential as a drug target has not been fully exploited. By contrast, other members of the sPLA2 family have attracted considerably more interest as pharmacological targets, owing to their involvement in lipid signalling and a range of inflammatory conditions²⁸,²⁹. Several potent non-pancreatic sPLA2 inhibitors have been developed (TABLE 1), which will provide a basis for the development of new pPLA2 inhibitors²⁸. Furthermore, the well-studied three-dimensional structure of the pPLA2 enzyme³⁰ should facilitate the rational design of target-based inhibitors. An ideal pPLA2 inhibitor would have a better therapeutic profile than orlistat, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. The benign phenotype of pPLA2-deficient mice that are fed regular chow indicates that, to achieve clinical significance, it might be necessary to develop non-absorbable inhibitors that target several isoforms of intestinal sPLA2.

**Fatty-acid transport and binding proteins.** After digestion, lipolytic products — mainly fatty acids and MAG — are dispersed as vesicles and bile salt-mixed micelles, and are absorbed across the apical brush-border membrane of enterocytes of the small intestine. Despite intensive investigations, the molecular mechanisms by which fatty acids and MAG are transported across the membrane of the enterocytes are still unclear³¹. Both passive (diffusion) and active (facilitated by binding protein and/or transporters) mechanisms are thought to contribute to absorption: the diffusive process might help to cope with an overflow of large quantities of fatty acids and MAG, whereas transporter-mediated pathways might facilitate absorption when the local lipid concentration is low. However, this view has recently been challenged by the finding that the diffusion process across adipocyte membranes is rapid and efficient even at low concentrations of fatty acids³². Alternatively, the transporter-mediated process might facilitate an appropriate subcellular distribution of lipids.

At least three distinct membrane proteins might participate in long-chain fatty-acid transport across the intestinal epithelia cells: intestinal fatty-acid-binding protein (IFABP), CD36 and fatty-acid-transport protein-4 (FATP4). Inactivation of IFABP does not attenuate lipid absorption in knockout mice³³, which indicates the presence of several compensating types of FABP in the small intestine. CD36, which is also known as fatty-acid translocase (FAT)³⁴, is highly expressed in the intestine in a pattern that is consistent with a role in lipid absorption³⁵: its expression in the small intestine is upregulated by dietary fat³⁶, genetic obesity and diabetes³⁷. Although CD36-deficient mice showed defective fatty-acid uptake by various tissues — including the heart, oxidative skeletal muscle and adipose tissues — no notable impairment of lipid absorption was observed in the knockout mice³⁸.

FATP4 is the principal FATP in the small intestine and is thought to have a role in facilitating fatty-acid uptake by intestinal epithelial cells³⁹. Targeted deletion of *Fatp4* in mice results in embryonic lethality⁴⁰, which prevents the detailed study of its physiological role in dietary fat absorption. Although enterocytes that are isolated from heterozygous mice show a 40% reduction of fatty-acid uptake, this is insufficient to cause detectable effects on fat absorption in heterozygous knockout mice that are fed either a normal or a high-fat diet⁴⁰. In addition to developmental and neonatal lethality, inactivation of FATP4 also causes defects in skin and hair development that are manifested as **lethal restrictive dermopathy**. As the passive diffusion of fatty acids is a highly efficient process³², the observed teratogenic effects might not be caused by the malabsorption of lipids. Indeed, FATP4 has also been shown to have acyl-CoA synthase activity⁴¹. This issue might be resolved through the generation and characterization of tissue-specific knockout mice with intestinal FATP4 deficiency.

**Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT).** MGAT catalyses the first step in TAG re-synthesis, which is involved in dietary absorption in enterocytes and represents one of the two main biochemical pathways that are involved in TAG synthesis⁴² (FIG. 2b). The activity of each pathway is determined by the relative abundance of *sn*-2-MAG and FFAs relative to glycerol-3-phosphate. In intestinal mucosa under normal lipid-absorption conditions, the MAG pathway contributes ~80% of the TAG that is incorporated into CHYLOMICRONS⁶ and is believed to inhibit the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway⁴³.

Consistent with a role in dietary fat absorption, all three of the MGAT genes (**MGAT1**, **MGAT2** and **MGAT3**) are predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract⁴⁴⁻⁴⁸. Although high MGAT2 expression at mRNA levels was detected in the human liver, little MGAT activity was identified in this organ⁴⁹. MGAT expression and activity in the liver is inducible by diabetes, obesity and lactation in rodents⁵⁰,⁵¹. MGAT expression at the mRNA level is also detectable in adipogenic tissues⁴⁴,⁴⁵,⁴⁸, although at much lower levels than in the small intestine, which indicates a possible role of the enzyme in *de novo* lipid synthesis. However, the MGAT2 protein is below detection limits in all non-gastrointestinal tissues⁴⁶.

MGAT2 expression and activity in the small intestine are induced by a high-fat diet, which correlates well with the pattern of dietary fat absorption⁴⁶; this enzyme is therefore an attractive drug target for dietary fat absorption. Its primary site of expression is limited to the gastrointestinal tract, which would minimize any

potential side effects of an MGAT inhibitor on other tissues. Furthermore, discharge of MAG and fatty acid (in contrast to TAG) as an unabsorbed energy source in the faeces might minimize the gastrointestinal side effects that are caused by orlistat. MGAT is a member of the acyltransferase superfamily of enzymes, which have recently been shown to be druggable through the successful development of small-molecule inhibitors of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and sn-1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) as potential treatments for HYPERCHOLESTEROLAEMIA and cancer, respectively (TABLE 1)⁵²⁻⁵⁴. However, important questions must be answered before MGAT is fully validated as a drug target for dietary fat absorption. For example, would the inhibition of MGAT cause the excessive accumulation of fatty acids and MAG in enterocytes, which might be toxic to the cells? Also, could this potential side effect be partially alleviated by the high turnover rate of the gastrointestinal lining⁵⁵? Additional concerns include side effects that might be caused by the unabsorbed MAG and fatty acids, and their potential effects on bacterial fermentation in the lower gastrointestinal tract.

HYPERCHOLESTEROLAEMIA  
The presence of an abnormal amount of cholesterol in the cells and plasma of the blood; this is associated with the risk of atherosclerosis.

Microsomal triglyceride-transfer protein (MTP). As the main transportation vehicles for fat and fat-soluble vitamins, chylomicrons provide a possible target for preventing dietary fat absorption. MTP has a pivotal role in the assembly of chylomicrons in intestinal enterocytes and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the liver, by transporting lipids and cholesterol esters from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen to lipoprotein particles⁵⁶. Mutation of human MTP causes ABETALIPOPROTEINAEMIA in patients and knockout mice, which is characterized by severe fat malabsorption, steatorrhoea, fatty liver, and other pathological conditions that result from defective lipoprotein and chylomicron assembly, and secretion from the intestine and liver⁵⁷. MTP is targeted by pharmaceutical companies for small-molecule inhibitors to treat dyslipidaemia. Several of the MTP inhibitors, such as Implitapide (Bayer), 8aR and CP-346086 (TABLE 2), have been shown to markedly lower cholesterol, triglyceride and VLDL levels in experimental animals and in humans⁵⁸⁻⁶². The main side effect that is associated with MTP-inhibitor treatment is lipid accumulation in the liver, as expected from the abetalipoproteinaemia conditions, which has greatly limited the potential of this class of drugs. Other enzymes that are involved in chylomicron assembly might provide better targets, such as the enzymes that are responsible for **chylomicron-retention disease** (also known as Anderson’s disease), which is a genetic disorder of dietary fat malabsorption⁵⁷,⁶³. In this disease, only intestinal lipoprotein assembly is impaired and patients have much less severe symptoms than those with abetalipoproteinaemia. Identification of the gene that is responsible for this genetic disorder will facilitate further exploration and identification of this potentially exciting new drug target.

### Fat storage and mobilization

In mammals, adipose tissue is the main storage site for TAG. Dysregulation of adipocyte lipogenesis and lipolysis is part of the pathogenesis that is associated with obesity, as well as the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes⁶⁴. Excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissue causes obesity, whereas a deficiency of adipose tissue is associated with a severe form of insulin resistance and fatty liver⁶⁵⁻⁶⁷. Acute regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes is important in supplying energy to the peripheral tissues in response to fasting and exercise (FIG. 3). The lipolysis re-esterification process also participates in the ‘futile cycle’ that is believed to preserve fatty acids that are not used to supply energy⁶⁸. The discovery that adipocytes express and secrete many adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin, has established this tissue as an important regulatory site both for endocrine functions and for energy homeostasis.

1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT). These enzymes catalyse the acylation of lysosphosphatidic acid at the sn-2 position to form phosphatidic acid, which is an important intermediate in the de novo biosynthesis of TAG and glycerophospholipids⁶⁹. Dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid results in the formation of sn-1,2-DAG, which joins the MGAT pathway for TAG synthesis that is catalysed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) (FIG. 3). **AGPAT2** is one of only two identified human genes that, when mutated, cause congenital generalized LIPODYSTROPHY, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is also known as Berardinelli-Seip syndrome⁶⁷. Mutation of AGPAT2 also causes voracious appetite and increased energy expenditure as a result of leptin deficiency. AGPAT activity is markedly induced during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, and overexpression of AGPAT1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in increased TAG synthesis⁷⁰. One obvious concern for intervention in AGPAT2 activity as a treatment for obesity is the potential side effect of lipodystrophy, which is associated with diabetes and extreme insulin resistance. However, this might not occur with small-molecule inhibitors, which are unlikely to impose total inhibition of the enzyme activity *in vivo*. AGPAT2 has proved to be druggable, as small-molecule inhibitors of AGPAT2 that were developed as a potential treatment for cancer have been shown to prevent cellular growth and induce apoptosis of tumour cells (TABLE 1)⁵³,⁵⁴.

Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). DGAT catalyses the final step in mammalian TAG synthesis that merges the MGAT and glycerol-3-phosphate pathways⁴². In contrast to MGAT enzymes, which are predominantly expressed in tissues that are involved in dietary fat absorption, both DGAT1 and DGAT2 are widely expressed in a range of tissues⁷¹,⁷². DGAT1 polymorphism is linked with certain types of human obesity⁷³. Levels of DGAT1 protein increase sharply following the differentiation of 3T3-L1 into mature adipocytes, and the overexpression of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in cell lines results in a marked increase in TAG synthesis in mature adipocytes and stably transfected McA-RH7777 cells⁷⁴,⁷⁵. In contrast to the minor role of DGAT in dietary fat absorption⁷⁶, mice that are deficient in DGAT1 show a reduction in adiposity and resistance to DIO⁷⁷, which is accompanied by an increase in energy expenditure and hyperlocomotive activity⁷⁸. The phenotype can be recapitulated by adipose-tissue transplantation from **Dgat1**-knockout mice to normal controls⁷⁹, which points to the adipocyte as the principal regulatory site for DGAT1 function.

By contrast, targeted inactivation of DGAT2 resulted in lethal neonatal LIPOPAENIA and skin-barrier abnormalities⁷⁵. DGAT2 is crucial to TAG synthesis in various tissues, as evidenced by the near absence of TAG in liver and white adipose tissue, and a greater than 70% reduction in plasma levels of TAG, fatty acid and glucose in **Dgat2**-knockout mice. The lethal phenotype is not compensated for by DGAT1; this possibly as a result of the different roles of the proteins in regulating endogenous TAG synthesis, as evidenced by the different subcellular localizations of TAG catalysed by these two enzymes⁷⁵. Furthermore, the content of linoleic acid (C18:2) in fatty acid from liver and plasma is greatly reduced in Dgat2-null mice, which indicates an important role for DGAT2 in the selective retention of essential fatty acids that are vital for the maintenance of normal skin function. Although the heterozygous Dgat2-knockout mice seem

Figure 3 | **Lipid storage and mobilization in adipocytes.** The main metabolic functions of adipose tissue are the accumulation of surplus energy through triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and deposition (lipogenesis), and lipid mobilization by releasing free fatty acids (FFAs) under conditions of negative energy balance (lipolysis). FFAs that are released from lipoprotein — chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) — catalysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) enters the adipocytes through both passive diffusion and active transport. Intracellular FFA is first converted to acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthase (ACS), and is then used as a substrate by two parallel TAG-synthetic pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) that is generated by glucose metabolism is acylated sequentially by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and sn-1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT), and converted to diacylglycerol (DAG) by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP); by contrast, the alternative pathway involves the acylation of monoacylglycerol (MAG) by MAG acyltransferase (MGAT). The two pathways merge with the acylation of DAG to TAG by diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Nascent lipid droplets that are generated from the ER are coated by at least one of the PAT family proteins (which includes perilipin (PER), adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) and tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47)) and S3-12, whereas mature lipid drops are mainly coated with perilipin. The mechanism by which other PAT proteins are replaced with perilipin is unclear. The relative rate of lipogenesis and lipolysis is determined by nutritional states and is regulated by endocrine factors, such as catecholamines and insulin, which impose their effect by the phosphorylation of perilipin and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). The phosphorylation of perilipin allows HSL to access lipid droplets, which results in the hydrolysis of TAG to FFAs that are then released from the adipocytes. PA, phosphatidic acid; PKA, protein kinase A; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid.

to be indistinguishable from wild-type controls, further analysis is needed to investigate whether they are more resistant to DIO. The difference in phenotype between Dgat1- and Dgat2-knockout mice has confirmed the theory that two distinct DGAT enzymes are responsible for storage and mobilization, and that separate pools of TAG exist for storage and oxidation<sup>80</sup>. Several natural products from various microorganisms have been reported to inhibit DGAT activity<sup>81</sup> (TABLE 1), although the specificity of these compounds has not yet been confirmed against cloned DGAT enzymes. Although the druggability of DGAT enzymes remains to be tested, the chemical structure of ACAT inhibitors will provide a basis for structure–activity-relationship efforts in designing and testing new DGAT1 inhibitors, because human DGAT1 (but not DGAT2) shares more than 34% peptide sequence similarity with the human ACAT1 enzyme.

**Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).** HSL is highly expressed in white and brown adipose tissues, where it is believed to catalyse the release of fatty acids from stored TAGs, thereby providing energy and heat to peripheral tissues<sup>82</sup>. In response to prolonged fasting, both mRNA and protein levels of HSL are increased in the mouse<sup>83</sup>. Variations in HSL expression and activity, and **HSL** gene polymorphism, have been associated with human obesity in several studies<sup>84,85</sup>. Suppression of HSL activity by insulin is diminished under diabetic and obese conditions, which leads to excessive circulating fatty-acid levels. Transgenic expression of human HSL in mice leads to an increase in hydrolytic activities against TAG, a reduction in fat mass and a decrease in body weight on calorie restriction<sup>86</sup>. By contrast, mice that are deficient in HSL manifest adipocyte hypertrophy, reduced fatty-acid release, decreased hepatic TAG storage and resistance to obesity caused by leptin

deficiency^{87,88}. The main pathophysiological conditions that are associated with HSL deficiency are male sterility, fasting HYPERGLYCAEMIA and HYPERINSULINAEMIA^{89}. As white adipose tissue from *Hsl*-knockout mice retains 40% of its TAG lipase activity compared with the wild-type control, the interpretation of the phenotype of knockout mice might be complicated by the existence of another as yet unidentified Hsl^{90}.

No small-molecule effort has been reported so far in the development of HSL inhibitors or activators. The human HSL sequence is unrelated to any of the known mammalian lipases, which makes it difficult to predict its druggability. However, the deciphering of the three-dimensional structure of the bacterial brefeldin-A esterase^{91}, which shares limited sequence similarity with HSL, has provided valuable insight into the basic structure of human HSL. The projected similarity in three-dimensional structures between the two proteins is partially validated by the accurate prediction that Ser424, Asp693 and His723 are important residues for the catalytic activity of HSL, which is consistent with the results of previous mutational analyses. The projected three-dimensional structural information will be valuable in the structure-based drug design of HSL inhibitors.

**Perilipin.** Perilipin belongs to the perilipin, ADRP and TIP47 (collectively known as PAT proteins) family of proteins, which control access to the lipids that they enclose^{92}. Lipid droplets that are stored intracellularly are coated with one or more members of the PAT family. Mammals express at least four PAT proteins: perilipin, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), S3-12 and tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47)^{93}. Functional studies point to a role of perilipin in regulating energy homeostasis. Ectopic overexpression of perilipin A, but not phosphorylation-defective mutants, results in the inhibition of TAG hydrolysis and enhanced lipolytic responses to protein kinase A (PKA) activation^{92}. Ablation of perilipin leads to animals that are lean, hypermetabolic and resistant to DIO^{94}. Perilipin-knockout mice show elevated basal lipolysis and resistance to stimulation by β-adrenoceptor agonists^{95}. There is a coordinated upregulation of genes that are involved in β-oxidation, the Krebs cycle and the electron-transport chain concomitant with the downregulation of genes that are involved in lipid biosynthesis. Specifically, there is a significant decrease in the expression of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (*Scd1*) gene, which is associated with the obese phenotype in *ob/ob* mice^{96}. The lack of a three-dimensional structure and vital information on catalytic domains of the enzyme present a real challenge in targeting perilipin for the development of small-molecule inhibitors. Any efforts in the development of screening assays for perilipin inhibitors will be hampered by the inherent difficulty of working with lipid droplets and the lack of a clear picture of the lipid substrate. Additionally, the mild hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia that are associated with perilipin deficiency in mice owing to glucose overload are of potential concern for the development of perilipin inhibitors as a treatment for obesity.

Fat synthesis and oxidation  
The synthesis and metabolism of fatty acids and TAG is a coordinated process, which is mediated by metabolic enzymes that are regulated by nutritional and hormonal stimuli in response to starvation, exercise and surplus energy (FIG. 4). Fasting reduces the mRNA levels of both fatty-acid synthase (FAS) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT)^{97}, whereas coordinated inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and GPAT activities occurs during exercise^{98}. Downregulation of genes that encode enzymes of fatty-acid synthesis, including ACC, FAS and GPAT, is observed in leptin-treated mice^{99}.

Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT). This enzyme catalyses the initial and committed step in the *de novo* synthesis of TAG by acylating glycerol-3-phosphate at the *sn*-1 position to form *sn*-1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate. GPAT activity in most mammalian tissues involves at least two isoforms of GPAT enzymes — the mitochondrial (GPAT1) and endoplasmic reticulum (erGPAT) isoforms — which are encoded by two different genes^{42}. erGPAT accounts for 90% of the total enzyme activity in most tissues, with the exception of the liver, in which GPAT1 contributes about 50%^{42}. GPAT1 expression and enzyme activity are regulated by nutritional and hormonal factors in a manner that is consistent with a crucial role in TAG synthesis^{100}. Overexpression of GPAT1 in mammalian cell lines results in a notable increase in TAG synthesis^{101}. By contrast, inactivation of GPAT1 in mice causes a reduction in weight gain accompanied by significant decreases in hepatic TAG content, plasma TAG and low-density-lipoprotein TAG secretion^{102}. Ablation of GPAT1 also results in mice that show a marked shift in the incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids into TAG and phospholipids.

How GPAT1 enzyme deficiency affects TAG synthesis remains elusive, as mitochondria lack a complete set of TAG-synthesis enzymes, such as DGAT, which catalyses the final step in TAG synthesis. One proposed mechanism for the fat loss that is observed in *Gpat1*-knockout mice predicts a role for GPAT1 as a mediator of lipid oxidation. Accordingly, as GPAT1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) reside on the outer mitochondrial membrane, and both seem to be reciprocally regulated by AMP-activated kinase, elimination of GPAT1 activity would prevent the direction of fatty acyl-CoAs towards TAG synthesis and avoid competition with CPT1 for acyl-CoAs (FIG. 4). Further investigation is needed to verify this hypothesis; for example, comparing the rate of mitochondrial β-oxidation between *Gpat1*-knockout mice and controls. Although no obvious pathophysiological conditions are associated with GPAT1 deletion, a real concern with targeting GPAT1 for obesity is its effect on phospholipid synthesis. For example, the inhibition of GPAT1 could potentially impair the synthesis of cardiolipin, which is a polyglycerophospholipid that is important in maintaining the normal function of mitochondria. Despite the considerable progress that has been made in deciphering individual residues that are important for the catalytic activity of GPAT1 (REF. 42),

Figure 4 | Interconnection of metabolic pathways involved in lipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid oxidation in mitochondria of liver and skeletal muscle. Among the lipid metabolic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty-acid synthase (FAS) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) are the three main enzymes that regulate the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, which is the principal inhibitor of fatty-acid entry into mitochondria for β-oxidation. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) regulates lipid oxidation by converting stearic acid (18:0) to oleic acid (18:1). The saturated fatty acyl-CoAs are known to allosterically inhibit ACC1, whereas monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs are the preferred substrates for the lipid synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Malonyl-CoA and stearic acid reciprocally regulate the entry of acyl-CoA into mitochondria by modulating the activity of CPTA. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are synthesized in the ER; they are also produced in mitochondria and transported to the ER where the terminal enzymes for TAG synthesis are located. Mitochondrial FAS (FAS II) and acyl-carrier protein (ACP) are involved in fatty-acid synthesis, but their role in lipid metabolism remains elusive.

information is still lacking on the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and on any reported efforts to develop GPAT1 inhibitors.

Fatty-acid synthase (FAS). Mammalian FAS catalyses the de novo synthesis of saturated fatty acids, such as myristate, palmitate and stearate, using acetyl- and malonyl-CoA. It functions as a homodimer of a multifunctional protein that contains seven catalytic domains and a site for the prosthetic group 4′-phosphopantetheine¹⁰³. The enzyme is abundantly expressed in lipogenic tissues, such as liver, adipose and lactating breast¹⁰⁴. FAS is believed to be important in coordination with CPT and ACC in maintaining energy homeostasis by converting excess food intake into lipids for storage and providing energy by upregulating the rate of β-oxidation. FAS might also have a role in carcinogenesis and increased FAS levels in cancer tissues indicate a poor prognosis¹⁰⁵.

Much of our understanding of the metabolic role of FAS comes from investigations using two FAS inhibitors: cerulenin and C75 (TABLE 2). C75, which is an α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone, was initially developed for its antitumour activity¹⁰⁶. Administration of C75 caused a dose-dependent decrease in food intake in

BALB/c mice, and blocked the fasting-induced upregulation of orexigenic neuropeptides and the downregulation of anorexigenic neuropeptides in the hypothalamus^{107,108}. Similar results were observed with cerulenin, although with much less efficacy^{107}. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of C75 resulted in the dose-dependent inhibition of feeding, which could be circumvented by ICV injection of neuropeptide Y^{107}.

One of the most popular models put forward to explain the weight-loss effects of FAS inhibitors posits that the level of malonyl-CoA in a subset of neurons regulates feeding, and inhibition of FAS causes a build-up of malonyl-CoA in the central nervous system, therefore suppressing the appetite of animals^{109}. This model was supported by the observations that administration of C75 to fasted mice rapidly increased hypothalamic malonyl-CoA and blocked feeding when the mice were presented with food. However, this model was challenged by the recent finding that C75 lacked target specificity for proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and acted as a non-specific neuronal activator^{110}. In support of the argument, C75 was reported to act as a possible alkylating agent and cerulenin was shown to inhibit protein acylation^{111,112}. In addition, C75 was reported to activate CPT1 (REF. 113). Treatment of mice with C75 led to increases in both energy consumption and fatty-acid oxidation in DIO that could be reversed by etomoxir (Byk Gulden; Medigene) (TABLE 2), which is an inhibitor of CPT1 (REF. 114).

In addition to a role for FAS in fat metabolism, the enzyme also has a pivotal role in embryonic development. Targeted deletion of the *Fas* gene results in mice that die *in utero*^{115}, thereby preventing further validation of the target. As more than 50% of heterozygous *Fas*-knockout mice also fail to survive embryonic development^{115}, the potential teratogenic consequences are of concern in the use of FAS inhibitors as a treatment for obesity. Heterozygous mice that survive the developmental lethality could be investigated to determine whether they are resistant to DIO; however, the development of mice with a targeted deletion or inducible knockout^{116} of the *Fas* gene in liver and adipose tissues will provide a better tool to examine the role of the FAS enzyme in obesity.

correlate well with the rate of fatty-acid oxidation in the perfused heart and in isolated myocytes^{119–121}, and with the RESPIRATORY QUOTIENT in skeletal muscle^{122,123}. Hepatic overexpression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase increases fatty-acid oxidation concomitant with a reduction of the malonyl-CoA level in the liver^{124}. Abnormal CPT1 activity might also contribute to the cause of obesity in human and rodent models. For example, impairment in CPT1-mediated lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle^{125} is observed in obese patients, and the inhibition of fat oxidation by the CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir causes an increase in adiposity that is accompanied by intramuscular TAG accumulation and insulin resistance in rodents^{126}.

Investigations on patients with genetic disorders of fatty-acid oxidation have also provided important insights into the functional roles of malonyl-CoA and different CPT isoforms. Inborn errors of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, another regulator of malonyl-CoA levels, cause cardiomyopathy in humans^{127}, which highlights the importance of malonyl-CoA in maintaining cardiac health. Mutation of the human liver isoform of CPT1 results in recurrent attacks of HYPOKETOTIC HYPOGLYCAEMIA^{128}. Human CPT2 deficiency, which is the most common inherited disease of mitochondrial long-chain fatty-acid oxidation, results in HEPATOCARDIOMUSCULAR DISEASE^{129}. So far, there have been no reports of mutations in the muscle isoform of human CPT1, which indicates potential developmental lethality. Additionally, mutations in a human gene that encodes the carnitine co-transporter also cause a fatty-acid oxidation disorder that is characterized by skeletal myopathy, progressive cardiomyopathy, hypoglycaemia and HYPERAMMONAEMIA^{130}.

Considerable progress has been made in recent years in defining the residues in the carnitine acyltransferases that are responsible for catalytic activity, malonyl-CoA and etomoxir inhibition, as well as the binding sites for carnitine^{131,132}. Deletion of the first 28 amino-terminal residues abolishes malonyl-CoA inhibition and high-affinity binding^{133}. A single amino-acid substitution in the region independently affects both high- and low-affinity binding^{133}. Loss of high-affinity binding greatly reduces malonyl-CoA inhibition without affecting CPT catalytic activity^{134}. Recently, a high-resolution structure of carnitine acetyltransferase has been determined^{135}, which shows that carnitine and CoA are bound on opposite sides of the catalytic His343 residue in deep channels of the enzyme (FIG. 5). This structural information not only provides a molecular basis for further understanding the catalysis by carnitine acyltransferases, and inhibition by etomoxir and malonyl-CoA, but also aids in the drug design of CPT activators for obesity.

Several small-molecule CPT1 inhibitors have been developed in recent years as hypoglycaemic agents for the treatment of diabetes on the basis of incomplete models of the reciprocity of fatty-acid and glucose metabolism^{136,137}, as well as hypoglycaemia observed in patients with mutations in the liver isoform of CPT1 (REF. 128). However, recent studies show that CPT1 inhibition causes insulin resistance, whereas activation

Carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT). This enzyme catalyses the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA to palmitoylcarnitine, which is a rate-limiting step in the transfer of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs from the cytosol to the mitochondria for oxidation; its activity is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, which is an allosteric inhibitor (FIG. 4). In mammals, three CPT enzymes have been identified so far: liver CPT1, muscle CPT1 and CPT2. These enzymes are encoded by three different genes^{117}. Muscle CPT1 has a crucial role in controlling the rate of β-oxidation in heart and skeletal muscle; it also has a much higher Michaelis–Menten constant (*K*~m~) for carnitine than the liver isoform and is more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition^{118}.

Several investigations have provided evidence that the malonyl-CoA/CPT1 axis is crucial in controlling the influx of fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation in the heart and skeletal muscle. The malonyl-CoA levels
of CPT1 through the inhibition of ACC improves insulin sensitivity and lowers blood glucose levels$^{138}$. These CPT inhibitors function either as substrate analogues, such as etomoxir, bromopalmitoyl-CoA and hemipalmitoylcarnitinium$^{136}$, or as inhibitors that act at the malonyl-CoA binding site, such as 4-hydroxyphenylglyoxylic acid and Ro 25-0187 (REFS 136,139). Nevertheless, these inhibitors have helped to generate important insights into the druggability of CPT1, and provide a structural basis for the rational design of CPT activators. So far, C75 is the only known CPT activator and is believed to act by competing with malonyl-CoA binding. Treatment of rodent adipocytes and hepatocytes with C75 increases both fatty-acid oxidation and CPT1 activity, which can be reversed by the CPT inhibitor etomoxir$^{114}$.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). This enzyme catalyses the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is a crucial regulator of mitochondrial fatty-acid β-oxidation through its inhibition of CPT1 (FIG.4). In mammals, ACC exists in two isoforms, ACC1 and ACC2, which are encoded by two different genes. ACC1 is the principal isoform in lipogenic tissues, whereas ACC2 is predominantly expressed in oxidative tissues, such as the heart and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are expressed in the liver, where fatty-acid synthesis and oxidation coexist$^{140}$. ACC1 is a cytosolic enzyme, whereas ACC2 is associated with the mitochondrial membrane through its extended amino terminus$^{141}$. This difference in compartmentalization might contribute to the diverse roles of the two isoforms in fat metabolism; ACC1 is believed to regulate fat synthesis in lipogenic tissues, whereas ACC2 controls the rate of lipid oxidation$^{141}$ in oxidative tissues. However, the recent identification of a mitochondrial form of FAS indicates that ACC2 might also have a role in fatty-acid synthesis in mitochondria$^{142}$.

ACC activity is mainly regulated by citrate and AMP kinase (AMPK)$^{143}$. Citrate is believed to be an allosteric activator of ACC, as evidenced by a strong positive correlation between levels of malonyl-CoA and citrate concentrations. For example, elevated ACC activity occurs concomitantly with a threefold increase in cellular citrate concentration following the acetooacetate treatment of acini cells isolated from lactating rat mammary gland$^{144}$. Phosphorylation of ACC by AMPK inhibits its activity, which is accompanied by a reduction in malonyl-CoA levels. This is seen both in reperfused rat hearts following ischaemia$^{145}$ and in skeletal muscle following treadmill exercise or electrical stimulation$^{146,147}$. Furthermore, the incubation of isolated rat soleus muscles with the AMPK activator AICAR decreases ACC2 activity and simultaneously increases the rate of fatty-acid oxidation$^{148}$.

The effect of ACC2 on fatty-acid oxidation is also observed in knockout mice that are deficient in this enzyme. $Acc2$-null mice are HYPERPHAGIC and show an elevated rate of fatty-acid oxidation concomitant with decreased malonyl-CoA levels in the skeletal muscle and heart. These knockout mice are resistant to DIO and related diabetes, with improved insulin sensitivity and decreased fatty-acid levels. The mRNA levels of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are markedly higher in the adipose, heart (UCP2) and muscle (UCP3) tissues of mutant mice, which together with increased β-oxidation might account for an upregulation of energy expenditure$^{149}$. Further analysis has also confirmed an important role of ACC2 in the malonyl-CoA/CPT1 axis, as illustrated by an increase in the CPT1 activity of hepatocytes that are isolated from Acc2-null mice. Surprisingly, CPT1 activity in skeletal muscle was not notably changed by ACC2 deficiency$^{149}$. The knockout mice have a normal lifespan with no apparent pathophysiological conditions caused by ACC2 deficiency.

Inhibitors of plant ACC have been developed and used as herbicides by targeting the plastid-localized ACC enzyme$^{150}$ (TABLE 2); these might provide structural diversity for the development of human ACC inhibitors, as the plant enzymes share high similarity with their mammalian counterparts in both catalytic and regulatory domains$^{151}$. Several mammalian ACC inhibitors have been developed and tested for physiological effects on TAG synthesis$^{152,153}$, although ACC2-specific inhibitors have not been reported. One of the mammalian ACC inhibitors, CP-610431, shows dual inhibition of both ACC1 and ACC2, and shares structural similarities with the herbicide Quizalofop (TABLE 2). When tested *in vivo*, several of the dual inhibitors reduced TAG synthesis and increased fat oxidation in rats, with a concurrent reduction in malonyl-CoA levels in the liver, muscle and heart$^{152,153}$. These results further support a role for malonyl-CoA and validate the concept that the inhibition of ACC enzymes with small molecules might provide a viable treatment option for obesity. In addition, the development of dual inhibitors can prevent the feedback responses that are caused by the inhibition of a single ACC isoform, as observed in Acc2-knockout mice, therefore providing better overall efficacy. Recently, a three-dimensional structure of the carboxyltransferase domain of yeast ACC was reported, which shows features that are likely to be common among eukaryotic ACCs, including dimerization and conserved residues for substrate binding$^{154}$ (FIG.5). This three-dimensional structure will aid the development of the next generation of ACC inhibitors, such as isozyme-selective inhibitors for ACC2, as potential treatments for obesity.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). This enzyme catalyses the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleate (18:1) and palmitoleate (16:1), which are the main monounsaturates of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters, waxes and TAG$^{155}$. Insights into the physiological role of SCD in maintaining energy homeostasis have come from a recent investigation of transgenic mice that are deficient in $SCD1$, as well as asebia mouse strains ($ab^j$ and $ab^{2j}$) that have naturally occurring mutations in the $Scd1$ gene$^{155}$. Mice that lack SCD1 are lean, hypermetabolic and resistant to DIO. Inactivation of SCD1 also improves the lipid metabolic profiles$^{155,156}$ and insulin sensitivity, as well as attenuating the obese phenotype that is caused by leptin deficiency$^{157}$.

The pathological effect of the loss of SCD1 on cutaneous function is not compensated for by other SCD isoforms, such as SCD2 and SCD3, which are abundantly expressed in the skin; this implies differences in substrate specificity or subcellular localization of these isoforms *in vivo*.

**Future perspectives on anti-obesity drugs**

As the gastrointestinal side effects that are associated with the use of orlistat are largely mechanism related, there might be limited room for further improvement by targeting gastric and pancreatic lipases. Enzymes and proteins that are engaged in lipid transport and absorption, such as sPLA2, FATP4, MGAT and MTP, might provide better targets for future efforts in this field. Therapeutic intervention that mobilizes fat from storage provides an intriguing possibility for dealing with excessive fat accumulation and body-weight gain. However, any attempt to pursue targets that are involved in this process must be combined with an increase in lipid metabolism to avoid the lipotoxicity that is associated with insulin resistance and increased risks of cardiovascular diseases. Several enzymes that are involved in TAG synthesis and fatty-acid desaturations have been shown to decrease fat content and FFAs in mouse models of targeted deletion. However, these enzymes also seem to be important in maintaining normal skin function, which might hinder the successful development of compounds. Future studies using pharmacological tools should therefore investigate whether the same side effects arise when enzymes are only partially inhibited. One unresolved issue concerning the role of the malonyl-CoA–CPT axis in regulating the rate of β-oxidation is the apparent conflict between the effects of malonyl-CoA on the central nervous system and peripheral tissues<sup>118,162</sup>. Further work is needed to validate FAS as a drug target using more specific FAS inhibitors and mice with tissue-specific or inducible knockout of the gene. ACC2 might be the most promising obesity target at the present time, owing to the favourable phenotype of ACC2-knockout mice. The development of ACC inhibitors by the herbicide industry has illustrated its druggability and will provide rich sources of diversity for future structure-based compound design.

The decoding of the genomic sequences of human and model organisms has provided an unprecedented opportunity for new target identification and validation, as exemplified by the recent identification of more than 400 genes that affect lipid metabolism in *Caenorhabditis elegans* from a genome-wide search using RNA interference<sup>163</sup>. In addition, our ability to identify, characterize and validate new drug targets for obesity will be greatly enhanced by the rapid development and application of bioinformatics, metabolomics and lipidomics, in combination with new technologies, such as quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance for the non-invasive

In support for a role of SCD1 in regulating lipid oxidation, genes that encode proteins that are involved in lipogenesis (for example, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), FAS and GPAT1) are downregulated, whereas those that are involved in fatty-acid β-oxidation (for example, CPT1, ACC and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) are upregulated<sup>158</sup>. Additionally, saturated fatty acyl-CoAs are known to inhibit ACC allosterically<sup>159</sup>, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress the mRNA expression of lipogenic enzymes, including ACC and FAS<sup>160</sup>. One of the main concerns in the development of SCD1 inhibitors as anti-obesity and TAG-lowering therapies is the potential for side effects on skin and eye function, such as cutaneous abnormalities with atrophic sebaceous glands and narrow eye fissure with atrophic meibomian glands,

measurement of body fat content and molecular imaging for fat oxidation. The new approaches and insights gained will help to replace today’s mainly opportunistic target-selection process with more holistic approaches, and have the potential to penetrate the untapped obesity market with more efficacious and safer medicines in the future. However, obesity is a complex, multifactorial and chronic disease, which is rarely caused by the failure of a single gene or gene product. So, the long-term efficacy of anti-obesity drugs that act on a single molecular target might be limited owing to the compensatory feedback mechanisms of redundant and complementary pathways. Ultimately, to be successful in treating obesity with pharmacotherapies, especially at a time when it is not yet obvious which approaches will deliver the most promising results, it seems sensible to invest in various target platforms and in the development of new medicines that act on both peripheral and central targets, as additive and synergistic effects might be expected. Progress in developing the next generation of more efficacious and safer anti-obesity drugs with fewer side effects, and treatment regimens that use single drugs and combination therapies will undoubtedly occur during the next decade. The best of times, however, in target identification, validation, drug discovery and development, and the treatment and prevention of obesity with efficacious and safe pharmacotherapies remains ahead of us.
