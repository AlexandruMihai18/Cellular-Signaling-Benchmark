Over the last 10 years there has been important progress towards understanding how neurotransmitters regulate dopaminergic output. Reasonable estimates can be made of the synaptic arrangement of afferents to dopamine and non-dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). These models are derived from correlative findings using a variety of techniques. In addition to improved lesioning and pathway-tracing techniques, the capacity to measure mRNA in situ allows the localization of transmitters and receptors to neurons and/or axon terminals in the VTA. The application of intracellular electrophysiology to VTA tissue slices has permitted great strides towards understanding the influence of transmitters on dopamine cell function, as well as towards elucidating relative synaptic organization. Finally, the advent of in vivo dialysis has verified the effects of transmitters on dopamine and γ-aminobutyric acid transmission in the VTA. Although reasonable estimates can be made of a single transmitter’s actions under largely pharmacological conditions, our knowledge of how transmitters work in concert in the VTA to regulate the functional state of dopamine cells is only just emerging. The fact that individual transmitters can have seemingly opposite effects on dopaminergic function demonstrates that the actions of neurotransmitters in the VTA are, to some extent, state-dependent. Thus, different transmitters perform similar functions or the same transmitter may perform opposing functions when environmental circumstances are altered. Understanding the dynamic range of a transmitter’s action and how this couples with other transmitters to modulate dopamine neurons in the VTA is essential to defining the role of dopamine cells in the etiology and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, it will permit a more rational exploration of drugs possessing utility in treating disorders involving dopamine transmission.

dopamine neurons in the ventral mesencephalon. Af-
ferent regulation of dopamine cells is organized into
three categories. (1) Intrinsic regulation refers to trans-
mitters colocalized with dopamine or present in non-
dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. This type of regula-
tion consists, in part, of short loop feedback regulation
of dopamine neurons, since it involves somatodendritic
dopamine release. Intrinsic transmitter release provides the least integrated feedback onto the dopamine
cells and is partially sensitive to changes in dopamine
membrane polarizations that do not elicit an action
potential. (2) Feedback regulation arising from limbic
and cortical dopamine terminal fields is often termed
long loop feedback because it is regulated, in part, by
axonal dopamine release. It is responsive only to mem-
brane polarizations in VTA cells that summate in
action potentials. (3) Regulation also arises from nuclei
not directly subject to influence by axonal dopamine
release. These afferents are responding to highly inte-
grated, polysynaptic regulation arising throughout the
CNS. In this review transmitters are placed into one of
these three categories. The anatomy of each transmit-
ter or transmitter family, and corresponding receptor(s)
is described and integrated with the electrophysiologi-
cal, neurochemical and behavioral evidence for an in-
fluence on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.
While the focus in this review is on neurons in the
VTA and the mesocorticolimbic projections, in many
instances more detailed experimental information is
available on the substantia nigra and, where appropri-
ate, these findings will be discussed.

2. REGULATION BY INTRINSIC NEURONS

The neurons in the dopamine-rich regions of the
ventral mesencephalon have been categorized in elec-
trophysiological studies as primary and secondary
cells${}^{159,165,219,275,516}$. The primary cells correspond to
dopamine neurons. Many of the primary dopamine
cells are colocalized with neurotensin and/or cholecys-
tokinin (CCK)${}^{409}$. Also, acetylcholine esterase (AChE)
is released from dopamine neurons in a neurotransmit-
ter-like fashion${}^{169}$. The neurochemical identity of the
secondary cells is not as clearly characterized, but most
studies concur that a portion contain $\gamma$-aminobutyric
acid (GABA)${}^{158,326,454}$. This section of the review is
concerned with the regulation of primary and sec-
ondary cells by the transmitters present in intrinsic
neurons; dopamine, GABA, neurotensin, CCK and
AChE. This is not a pure classification, since afferents
to the VTA and substantia nigra also contain GABA
and neurotensin. In addition, a low density of intrinsic
neurons contain proenkephalin-derived peptides and
glutaminase (a marker for glutamic acid). However,
both glutamic acid and proenkephalin peptides are
more consistently characterized as arising from regions
innervated by ventral mesencephalic dopamine neu-
rons and will be discussed as feedback modulators.

### 2.1. Dopamine

#### 2.1.1. Anatomy and receptor localization
The dopamine neurons in the ventromedial mesencephalon are de-
scribed most frequently as being in the VTA. The VTA
is derived from the original description by Tsai${}^{474}$ of a
histologically distinct group of neurons in the ventral
mesencephalon that, in the sagittal plane, appear orga-
nized in a triangular shape. In 1964, Dahlstrom and
Fuxe${}^{91}$ used glyoxylic acid fluorescence to reveal that
many of the neurons in the VTA are dopaminergic and
that the VTA is located within the A10 dopamine cell
group. In addition to the VTA, the A10 region consists
of three nuclei along the midline. The nucleus interfas-
cularis contains a high density of relatively small
diameter dopaminergic neurons and is located within
500 $\mu$m of the ventral surface of the mesencephalon
and, more caudal, just dorsal to the interpeduncular
nucleus${}^{344,365}$. Dorsal and caudal to the nucleus inter-
fascicularis are the rostral and caudal nucleus linearis,
respectively, which extend to the dorsal raphe and
contain loosely organized dopaminergic perikarya that
diminish in density towards the dorsal edge${}^{344,365,456}$. The VTA itself is subdivided into dorsal and ventral
compartments, the nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus
and nucleus paranigralis, respectively${}^{344,365}$. Lateral to
the A10 dopamine region is the substantia nigra, which
contains the A9 dopamine neurons. The dopamine
perikarya are located along the dorsal rim of the sub-
stantia nigra in the pars compacta (SNpc) and the
dendritic fields of these cells extend ventrally into the
pars reticulata (SNpr). Finally, dorsal and caudal to the
substantia nigra is a cluster of dopamine neurons
termed the A8 region by Dahlstrom and Fuxe${}^{91}$ which
is localized predominantly in the retrorubral field${}^{103}$.

The projection fields of the dopamine neurons in
the ventral mesencephalon are, to some extent, topo-
graphically organized. The more medial cells in the
VTA project most densely to limbic and cortical re-
gions, while the lateral neurons in the SNpc project
more exclusively to the striatum${}^{30,126,456}$. Because of
this topography, the dopamine projections are often
subdivided into the mesocorticolimbic system emanat-
ing from the A10 dopamine cells and the nigrostriatal
system arising from the A9 cell cluster. In addition to
the ascending projections, a nigrotectal dopamine pro-
jection has been identified${}^{57}$.
Five dopamine receptor subtypes have been cloned but physiological and pharmacological roles have been characterized in detail for only the D₁ and D₂ receptors (see Sibley and Monsma⁴²⁰ for a review). D₂ receptors are present in high density throughout the regions of the ventral mesencephalon enriched in dopamine perikarya³⁵,²⁹⁶ and lesion studies reveal that the majority are localized to dopamine neurons³⁵,⁴⁰. Furthermore, the expression of mRNA for D₂ receptors is present in dopamine neurons in the ventral mesencephalon²⁹⁷,³⁰⁷. However, electrophysiological and neurochemical data indicate a small population of D₂ receptors may also be present on non-dopaminergic neurons²⁴¹,²⁷⁷. D₁ receptors are located in moderate density in the VTA²⁹⁶,⁴⁶⁶, but in high density in the SNpr⁷,⁹⁹,²⁹⁶. Although not characterized in the VTA, lesion studies reveal that D₁ receptors are found primarily on striatonigral axon terminals⁷,²⁹,³⁶⁸,³⁹⁵; a view supported by the lack of neurons expressing mRNA for D₁ receptors in the ventral mesencephalon²⁹⁷. Based upon this receptor localization, D₂ receptors are characterized as dopamine autoreceptors which directly modulate the excitability of dopamine cells, while D₁ receptors modulate transmitter release from afferents to dopamine perikarya. Fig. 1 illustrates the anatomical organization of D₁ and D₂ receptors.

### 2.1.2. Electrophysiology and intracellular transduction

Intracellular recordings in vivo reveal that dopamine neurons in the VTA exist in two states: (1) spontaneously discharging potentials or (2) hyperpolarized and non-firing¹⁵⁷. The spontaneously firing neurons exhibit both single spike firing and burst firing¹⁶¹,¹⁶². Intracellular recordings in tissue slices reveal that dopamine cells display non-bursting pacemaker-like activity¹⁶⁵, which partially underlies the spontaneous firing observed in vivo³⁹⁴. The spontaneous depolarization mediating the pacemaker activity can be triggered by administering a depolarizing pulse¹⁵⁶ or by rebound from a hyperpolarizing pulse¹⁶²,²⁵⁶ and is therefore thought to arise from mechanisms intrinsic to dopamine cells. The slow depolarization is voltage dependent and results from a low threshold, TTX-sensitive Na⁺ current. This is followed by a low threshold Ca²⁺-dependent depolarization which, following an action potential, is reset by the afterhyperpolarization resulting from Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ conductance¹³⁷,¹⁵⁶,¹⁵⁷,¹⁶²,¹⁸². In contrast, burst firing is derived primarily from synaptic input. This is most clearly indicated by the fact that spontaneous burst firing is not present in tissue slices of the ventral mesencephalon¹³⁷,¹⁶⁵,³⁹⁴. Excitatory amino acid (EAA) input from the prefrontal cortex can induce burst firing¹⁴²,⁴⁵⁵ and local administration of glutamic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) pro-

**Dopamine and GABA**

![Diagram](#)

Fig. 1. Schematic of the cellular events accompanying the regulation of dopamine cells and GABA interneurons by dopamine and GABA. Somatodendritically released dopamine acts on D₂ receptors to open an ATP-sensitive potassium channel via Gᵢ/Gₒ coupling. D₁ receptors are located primarily to descending afferents, many of which are GABAergic. Stimulation of D₁ receptors augments GABA release and stimulates the firing frequency of interneurons. The descending GABAergic efferents from the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum to the VTA synapse preferentially on GABA_B receptors on dopamine cells and innervate both GABA_A and GABA_B receptors on non-dopamine cells.

duces bursting activity in vivo¹⁶¹,³⁵¹. Although glutamate is not a sufficient stimulus to elicit bursting activity in vitro³⁶⁹, the administration of NMDA results in bursting²²⁰. In addition to NMDA, burst-like firing patterns are elicited in vitro following the blockade of Ca²⁺-dependent K⁺-channels with apamin, which partially decreases the afterhyperpolarization, thereby prolonging depolarization⁴¹⁵.

The systemic or iontophoretic administration of D₂ agonists markedly depresses the firing frequency of dopamine neurons⁴⁹,⁴⁹¹,⁵⁰⁰. Likewise, D₂ antagonists or decreased dopamine synthesis increase dopamine cell firing frequency, indicating that tonic inhibitory tone is being supplied by somatodendritically released dopamine⁴⁹,²⁴⁴,⁴⁹¹. In vitro intracellular studies demonstrate that this results from a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled increase in K⁺ conductance²⁰⁶,²⁷³. The D₂ receptor coupled K⁺ conductance is prevented by the relatively specific blocker of ATP-sensitive K⁺ channels, tolbutamide²⁸⁴,³⁹⁰. The binding constant of D₂ receptor agonists is increased by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor protein¹¹⁷. Consistent with this finding, stimulation of

adenylyl cyclase by forskolin or the administration of the metabolically stable cAMP analogue, 8-bromocAMP, desensitizes D₂ receptors in nigral tissue slices⁴¹⁸. Fig. 1 illustrates the intracellular regulation and coupling of D₂ receptors.

The iontophoresis of D₁ agonists onto dopamine cells is without effect on firing frequency⁵⁸. Using cis-flupentixol as a D₁ receptor antagonist, Matthews and German³⁰⁴ conclude that the stimulant effect of iontophoretic dopamine on the firing frequency of secondary neurons in the SNpr is mediated by D₁ receptors. More recently, Waszczyk⁴⁹³ found that the iontophoretic application of the D₁ receptor partial agonist, SKF-38393 stimulates approximately 50% of non-dopamine neurons in the SNpr. A primary intracellular transducer of D₁ receptor stimulation is the activation of adenylyl cyclase via Gₛ coupling⁶. Consistent with this, lesions of the striatonigral pathway that markedly reduce D₁ binding density in the substantia nigra almost abolish dopamine-stimulated cAMP formation⁷,²⁹,³⁶⁸,³⁹⁵.

### 2.1.3. Neurochemistry

In addition to hyperpolarizing dopamine cells, D₂ receptor stimulation decreases dopamine synthesis¹³,³³⁹. Axon terminal D₂ autoreceptors regulate dopamine release, but such an action on somatodendritic release of dopamine has been difficult to demonstrate using inferential postmortem techniques²⁹⁴,³³⁸,³³⁹,⁴⁹⁷. However, recent in vivo dialysis studies find that administering the D₂/D₃ agonist, quinpirole, through the probe markedly reduces the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the VTA²³². Although in vivo dialysis studies demonstrate that somatodendritic dopamine release is, at least partly, Ca²⁺-dependent²³²,³⁸⁷, electron microscopic evidence suggests that somatodendritic dopamine is not present in vesicles¹⁷⁴,⁴⁹². Also, the depletion of vesicular dopamine content with reserpine does not alter dopamine release in the substantia nigra¹²¹.

Based upon receptor localization to descending afferent terminals, D₁ receptor stimulation by somatodendritically released dopamine in the VTA does not directly influence dopamine neuron function. Nonetheless, D₁ receptors are probably modulating transmitter release in afferents to dopamine cells. While D₁ receptor-mediated modulation of any of the afferents discussed in this review is possible, a likely candidate is GABAergic afferents (see below) and an in vitro study indicates that D₁ agonists enhance radiolabeled GABA release⁴³⁴. More recently, in vivo dialysis was used to demonstrate that local perfusion of the D₁ agonist,

### 2.1.4. Functional considerations

Locomotor activity can be influenced by dopamine transmission in the mesoaccumbens dopamine system. Lesions of the mesoaccumbens dopamine system produce deficits in spontaneous and psychostimulant-induced locomotor activity<sup>78,129,253,267</sup>. Stimulation of dopamine transmission in this pathway is important in the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse, as well as reinforcing environmental stimuli such as food and sex<sup>203,266,316,427,506</sup>. Also, the VTA is a site where amphetamine-like psychostimulants and opioids act to initiate behavioral sensitization (see Kalivas and Stewart<sup>238</sup> for a review). Stress has been shown to stimulate dopamine cells in the VTA and most studies concur that stress most effectively stimulates dopamine neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex<sup>1,105,467</sup>. However, different stress modalities and intensity differentially stimulate dopamine transmission in various terminal fields<sup>105,116</sup>. Mesocortical dopamine neurons also play a role in cognition<sup>423</sup>.

Although lesions of dopamine innervation to various terminal fields have been a primary experimental tool in revealing the involvement of dopamine in a diverse array of functions, it is thought that the functions ascribed to dopamine neurons are more correctly placed in the nuclei being innervated<sup>421</sup>. Thus, dopamine subserves a permissive or gating role in these physiological and pharmacological processes (see Mogenson<sup>421</sup>; LeMoal and Simon<sup>281</sup> for a review). This idea is supported by the fact that while not altered during motor activity, the firing frequency of dopamine cells responds to novel stimuli, the delivery of a reward without a predictive stimulus and to conditioned stimuli that predict a reward<sup>289,391,406,438</sup>. This is consistent with a role in providing an initiating stimulus to forebrain and cortical nuclei responsible for performing a behavioral task.

A primary function of somatodendritically released dopamine is to provide autoinhibition of impulse generation and somatodendritic dopamine transmission. Correspondingly, as summarized in Table I, the microinjection of D₂ agonists into the VTA produces a decrease in motor activity that is associated with a decrease in postmortem levels of dopamine metabolites in the nucleus accumbens and striatum<sup>5,44,45,87,439</sup>. Likewise, uncoupling D₂ receptors in the VTA with pertussis toxin prevents the sedative effect of systemic D₂ agonists and increases the level of postmortem metabolites in the VTA and nucleus accumbens<sup>15,440</sup>. Unilateral microinjection of SKF 38393 into the substantia nigra elicits contraversive circling, presumably by increasing dopamine transmission ipsilateral to the

---

The involvement of GABA transmission in this effect is indicated by the fact that a combination of subthreshold behavioral doses of SKF 38393 and an inhibitor of the GABA uptake carrier, nipecotic acid, were additive in eliciting circling behavior<sup>436</sup>. In addition, the stimulation of D₁ receptors by L-DOPA activates GABAergic projection neurons from the SNpr to the thalamus and superior colliculi<sup>101</sup> which directly modifies motor behaviors (see Robertson<sup>388</sup> for a review).

#### 2.2. γ-Aminobutyric acid

##### 2.2.1. Anatomy and receptor localization

The neurons studied most extensively in the VTA besides dopamine cells are GABAergic neurons. The presence of GABAergic neurons in the VTA has been shown using immunocytochemistry for both GABA and the GABA synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)<sup>326,346,429</sup> and by the fact that spontaneous GABA-mediated membrane polarizations occur in VTA tissue slices<sup>219,454</sup>. Likewise, in situ hybridization for GAD mRNA reveals a moderate density of GABAergic cells within the VTA (Dr. Ariel Deutch, Yale University, New Haven, CT, personal communication)<sup>239</sup>. Approximately 20% of the neurons in the VTA express mRNA for GAD while greater than 60% of the neurons in the SNpr are GABAergic<sup>239</sup>. The intrinsic GABA neurons synapse on dopamine cells<sup>21,479</sup>, as well as project outside the ventral mesencephalon to influence other motor and limbic structures<sup>56</sup>. Furthermore, a portion of the nigrotectal GABAergic projection is colocalized with dopamine<sup>57</sup>. In many instances non-dopamine projection cells collateralize to synapse both inside and outside the substantia nigra or VTA<sup>102</sup>.

GABA neurons projecting to the VTA are located in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum<sup>10,429,489,514</sup>. The bulk of data are derived from lesioning these forebrain regions and producing a decline in the tissue concentration of GABA or GAD in the VTA or substantia nigra. Recently, by using combined retrograde labeling and in situ hybridization for GAD mRNA it was shown that at least 35–55% of the neurons projecting from these structures to the VTA are GABAergic (unpublished observations). The projection is topographically organized, with the shell of the nucleus accumbens and ventromedial ventral pallidum projecting to the VTA and the accumbal core and dorsolateral ventral pallidum projecting to the substantia nigra<sup>183,517</sup>. Descending GABAergic efferents to the VTA and substantia nigra synapse on both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons<sup>429,430,454,479</sup>. Regardless of whether GABA efferents to

dopamine cells arise from intrinsic cells or outside the ventral mesencephalon, electron microscopy indicates that 50–70% of all synapses on dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra are GABAergic<sup>429</sup>.

Both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are found in the VTA; although the density for both receptors is low in the VTA and SNpc compared to the SNpr<sup>41,141</sup>. The majority of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are not located on dopamine cells in the VTA, since destruction of the dopamine cells with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) does not significantly reduce [³H]muscimol binding density<sup>74,385</sup>. However, mRNA for the β<sub>1</sub>-, β<sub>2</sub>-, β<sub>3</sub>- and γ<sub>2</sub>-subunits of the GABA<sub>A</sub>/Cl⁻ channel is present in moderate density in the VTA, indicating the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on non-dopamine cells<sup>11</sup>. Similar studies have not been conducted to determine the relative location of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.

### 2.2.2. Electrophysiology and intracellular transduction.
The GABAergic neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra constitute a portion of the secondary cells which can be readily distinguished from dopamine cells in vivo and in vitro on the basis of electrophysiological characteristics of the action potential<sup>159,165,219,275,516</sup>. Furthermore, in contrast to dopamine cells, the secondary cells are hyperpolarized by μ-opioid but not D<sub>2</sub> agonists<sup>218</sup>. The GABAergic synapse between intrinsic GABA neurons and dopamine cells is postulated to utilize GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, since the spontaneous hyperpolarizing membrane potentials measured from dopamine cells in VTA tissue slices are mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub>/Cl⁻ channels<sup>219,454</sup>.

The descending GABAergic projection also synapses on GABA neurons intrinsic to the VTA<sup>429</sup>. Although both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> membrane polarizations can be produced in secondary cells, the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor has been most extensively studied. Systemic or iontophoretic administration of GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists inhibits the firing frequency of non-dopamine cells<sup>158,494</sup>. Systemic benzodiazepine administration also inhibits the activity of non-dopamine cells, consistent with the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub>/Cl⁻ channels<sup>342</sup>.

In vivo electrophysiological studies have made the paradoxical observation that low doses of GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists stimulate dopamine cell firing frequency<sup>158,293,494</sup>. This is associated with a decrease in the firing frequency of non-dopamine cells and it is postulated that the inhibition of GABAergic interneurons results in disinhibition of the dopamine cells. Grace and Bunney<sup>163</sup> demonstrated a similar intensity-response relationship to electrical stimulation of striatonigral GABAergic efferents to the substantia nigra. Low stimulation parameters decrease non-dopamine cell firing and disinhibit dopamine neurons, while

higher intensity parameters directly inhibit dopamine cells. Similar to Grace and Bunney<sup>158</sup>, Collinridge and Davies<sup>81</sup> found that SNpc neurons are less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of iontophoretic GABA than SNpr cells and either systemic<sup>494</sup> or local muscimol administration is approximately 3-fold more potent at inhibiting secondary cells than dopamine cells in VTA tissue slices (Drs. Steve Johnson and Alan North, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR; personal communication). Exactly how preferential effects of GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists on non-dopamine cells occur is unclear. One contributing factor is that proportionally more [³H]muscimol binding sites are on non-dopamine cells than on dopamine perikarya<sup>74</sup>. Also, the relatively high firing frequency of secondary cells in vivo<sup>349,493</sup> and the observation by Grace and Bunney<sup>163</sup> that dopamine neurons in vivo are continuously bombarded by Cl⁻-mediated inhibitory potentials indicates that intrinsic GABA neurons are tonically inhibiting dopamine neurons. Taken together, these factors could cause the primary in vivo effect of GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists to be disinhibition of dopamine neurons. A model of the synaptic organization of GABA neurons, afferents and receptors in the VTA is shown in Fig. 1.

### 2.2.3. Neurochemistry and function.
Consistent with the electrophysiology, Table I shows that stimulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors by baclofen produces a reduction in extracellular dopamine content when applied through a dialysis probe in the VTA<sup>262</sup>. Also, baclofen microinjection into the VTA decreases basal and pharmacologically elicited dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens<sup>234,465</sup> and baclofen prevents the elevation of dopamine metabolites in the prefrontal cortex produced by footshock stress<sup>234</sup>. Table I shows that consistent with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor localization and electrophysiology, low doses of muscimol administered in vitro and in vivo increase the extracellular content of dopamine in the VTA while high doses result in no change<sup>25,262</sup>. Muscimol microinjection into the VTA elicits an increase in motor activity that is blocked by dopamine antagonists and associated with a modest increase in dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens<sup>234,345,505</sup>. In contrast to these studies done in vivo or with VTA tissue slices, neither baclofen nor muscimol alters the release of [³H]dopamine from nigral dendrosomes<sup>298</sup>. This may indicate a preferential effect of GABA on dopamine soma versus dendrites; although GABAergic synapses have been demonstrated on both dopaminergic soma and dendrites<sup>429</sup>.

Consistent with the in vivo electrophysiological studies showing that GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists preferentially inhibit GABAergic interneurons, microinjection of the indirect GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, picrotoxin, into the substantia

nigra promotes the release of preloaded \[^3H\]GABA, indicating tonic stimulation of GABA\(_A\) receptors on GABAergic neurons\(^{264}\). Studies using nigral tissue slices also find that muscimol inhibits the release of radiolabeled GABA\(^{131}\). Supporting an action by GABA\(_A\) agonists on GABA neurons and not GABAergic axon terminals is the fact that muscimol does not alter GABA release in a synaptosomal preparation\(^{147}\).

In contrast to the studies outlined above, Mogenson et al.\(^{319}\) and Stinus et al.\(^{443}\) found that microinjection of the indirect GABA\(_A\) antagonist, picrotoxin, into the VTA elicits a motor-stimulant response. It is possible that the relatively high doses of picrotoxin employed in these later two studies may have produced motor activity via non-specific stimulation or diffusion out of the VTA. This concern is underscored by the fact Stinus et al.\(^{443}\) found picrotoxin-induced motor activity to be dopamine-dependent while Mogenson et al.\(^{319}\) could not block the response with the dopamine antagonist, spiroperidol.

### 2.3. Proneurotensin-derived peptides

#### 2.3.1. Peptide family, anatomy and receptor localization

Neurotensin is a tridecapeptide which is found in moderate to high concentrations in the VTA\(^{60}\). Cloning of the canine neurotensin gene reveals that the neurotensin precursor contains one copy each of neurotensin and the neurotensin-related hexapeptide, neuromedin N\(^{111}\). Neuromedin N shares four amino acid C-terminal homology with neurotensin\(^{315}\). Since both peptides share a common precursor, it is likely that they are coexpressed in the brain. However, Kitabgi et al.\(^{259}\) report that there exists marked variations in the relative proportion of neurotensin to neuromedin N depending upon the micropunched brain region. In the VTA the ratio of neurotensin to neuromedin N is 3:1. This suggests that in the VTA post-translational processing of the neurotensin precursor favors the expression of neurotensin over neuromedin N. However, the ratio may reflect more rapid turnover and degradation of neuromedin N. Differential turnover rates are indicated by the substantially more rapid degradation of neuromedin N in brain tissue homogenates\(^{65,66}\). It is also possible that the relatively high concentration of neurotensin in the VTA and substantia nigra may result from the specific uptake of neurotensin by dopamine axon terminals in the striatum and retrograde transport of the intact peptide back to the cell body\(^{62}\).

Neurotensin is present in both neuronal perikarya and fibers in the VTA\(^{215,477}\). The density of neurotensin-immunoreactive neurons is greatest in the dorsal VTA, corresponding to the nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus and nucleus linearis\(^{224}\). This relative distribution is confirmed using in situ hybridization for neurotensin mRNA\(^{212}\). The vast majority of neurotensin-containing cells in rats, but not humans, contain dopamine and a portion also contain CCK\(^{143,195,409}\). The bulk of the neurotensin neurons in the VTA project to the prefrontal cortex\(^{451}\), although a small percentage innervate or pass through the shell of the nucleus accumbens and diagonal band of Broca\(^{235}\). The projection is relatively selective for the medial prefrontal cortex, since the dopamine innervation of the anterior cingulate, motor, retrosplenial and visual cortices does not contain neurotensin\(^{127}\). Neurotensin-immunoreactive fibers are found in high density throughout the VTA\(^{215,224,477}\). The bulk of the fibers do not originate from the neurotensin perikarya in the VTA, since 6-OHDA induced destruction of colocalized dopamine/neurotensin neurons does not alter the tissue content of immunoreactive neurotensin\(^{302,518}\). At present, the origin of the majority of neurotensin fibers in the VTA is unknown; although, moderate to high densities of neurotensin-immunoreactive neurons in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala pose these nuclei as possible sources. Electron microscopic evidence verifies that neurotensin-immunoreactive axons form synaptic specializations on dopamine perikarya and dendrites; although a portion of neurotensin synapses are onto non-dopaminergic dendrites and neuronal somata\(^{511}\). Recently, Bayer et al.\(^{22}\) found that neurotensin is only in dense core vesicles in perikarya and not axon terminals, colocalizing tyrosine hydroxylase. This argues that neurotensin is not colocalized in the subpopulation of dopamine cells known to project within the ventral mesencephalon\(^{20}\).

Neurotensin receptors are found in high density in the VTA\(^{515}\) and lesioning the VTA with 6-OHDA demonstrates that the vast majority are located on dopaminergic cell bodies and dendrites\(^{108,354,371}\). Using light microscopy on thin adjacent sections analyzed for tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and \[^{125}\]I-neurotensin binding, Szigethy and Beaudet\(^{457}\) find that greater than 80% of all dopamine cells are in register with intense \[^{125}\]I-neurotensin labeling. Using electron microscopy, the localization of neurotensin binding sites on dopamine cells does not correspond to synaptic specializations\(^{93}\). Approximately 20% of the binding is intraneuronal, perhaps corresponding to neurotensin receptor synthesis. The remainder of binding sites are not restricted to synaptic specializations and localize diffusely on the cell surface. This argues that neurotensin release in the VTA may serve a paracrine function to regulate the tonic activity of dopamine neurons.

In addition to high-affinity neurotensin binding sites ($K_{\mathrm{d}} = 0.3-0.7 \, \mathrm{nM}$) which account for the anatomical data outlined above, relatively low-affinity binding sites have been identified. One low-affinity binding site ($K_{\mathrm{d}} = 5-10 \, \mathrm{nM}$) is blocked by levocabastin and dynorphin and localized in a relatively homogeneous pattern throughout the brain^{362,405}. By virtue of its double aginyl moiety in the 9 and 10 position, neurotensin binds to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels where it displaces $[^{125}\mathrm{I}]$apamin with an $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ of about $400 \, \mathrm{nM}^{202}$. Neurotensin also forms a complex with dopamine in vitro with a binding constant of about $75 \, \mathrm{nM}^{3}$. This interaction results from binding of the arginyl moiety of neurotensin to the catechol hydroxyl groups of dopamine^{402}. While probably not physiologically relevant, the low-affinity binding sites may be involved in pharmacological responses to neurotensin. However, to date no such involvement has been demonstrated^{237, 340,416}. Neuromedin N binds to high-affinity neurotensin receptors with approximately equal affinity as neurotensin^{66,146}.

### 2.3.2. Electrophysiology and intracellular transduction.
Numerous electrophysiological studies demonstrate that neurotensin increases the firing frequency of dopamine cells in vivo and in vitro^{207,366,413,417}. Likewise, neuromedin N stimulates dopamine neuron firing frequency^{416}. Recent studies reveal that the excitatory effect of neurotensin on dopamine cells is partly derived from the desensitization of $D_2$ autoreceptors^{413, 416,417}. This is consistent with the observations by Fuxe and co-workers^{4,138,485,486} that neurotensin increases the binding constant of $D_2$ receptor agonists in rat and human forebrain tissue homogenates. Shi and Bunney^{418} find that the decrease in sensitivity of $D_2$ receptors by neurotensin is abolished by blocking PKA. Since the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of $D_2$ receptors raises the binding constant of dopamine agonists^{117}, it is hypothesized that neurotensin stimulates adenylyl cyclase to activate PKA (see Fig. 2)^{418}. Although neurotensin does not activate cAMP production in other brain regions, this has yet to be examined in the VTA (Dr. Clinton Kilts, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, personal communication). Indirectly supporting a role for adenylyl cyclase and PKA production, neurotensin receptors are G protein coupled, since they possess seven transmembrane domains^{463} and GTP converts high-affinity neurotensin binding sites to low affinity^{464}. However, the capacity of neurotensin to increase the $K_{\mathrm{d}}$ of $D_2$ receptor agonist binding or produce motor activity following microinjection into the VTA is not affected by the ADP-ribosylation of the $\alpha$-subunits of $G_i$ or $G_o$ with pertussis toxin^{237,486}. This argues that neurotensin receptors may

Fig. 2. Regulation of dopamine cells by somatodendritically released cotransmitters, including neurotensin (NT), cholecystokinin (CCK) and acetylcholine esterase (AchE). Neurotensin receptors are on dopamine cells and decrease the affinity of dopamine binding via PKA-mediated phosphorylation of $D_2$ autoreceptors. In addition to somatodendritically released neurotensin, the high density of neurotensin-immunoreactive fibers arising from outside the VTA are a major component in the modulation of dopamine cells by endogenous neurotensin. CCK acts on CCK$_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors to promote the capacity of $D_2$ agonists to inhibit dopamine cells as well as directly stimulating dopamine cell firing frequency.

be coupled to $G_s$ which has been shown for other receptors to stimulate adenylyl cyclase^{6}. The interaction between neurotensin and $D_2$ receptors is illustrated in Fig. 2.

### 2.3.3. Neurochemistry and functional considerations.
The in vivo and in vitro application of neurotensin into the substantia nigra elevates extracellular dopamine content^{123}. Based upon the electrophysiological data (see above), it is a reasonable hypothesis that neurotensin augments nigral dopamine release by desensitizing $D_2$ receptors. However, neurotensin does not antagonize the capacity of the $D_2$ agonist, quinpirole, to inhibit dopamine release^{123}. Neurotensin microinjection into the VTA or substantia nigra increases postmortem measures of dopamine metabolism in many dopamine terminal fields (see Table I)^{52,241,328}. Likewise, neurotensin given into the VTA produces an elevation of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens^{231,276}. The increase in axonal dopamine release is associated with elevated motor activity^{51,120,229,231} and for both effects the peak response occurs with a latency of 40–60 min following acute microinjection into the VTA. Also, Napier et al.^{328} observed a delay of 24 h after the microinjection of neurotensin into the substantia nigra prior to an increase in postmortem dopamine metabolites in the striatum. This may reflect initial desensiti-

zation of the neurotensin receptor produced by the high concentration microinjected ${ }^{122,123}$. Alternatively, it may indicate that motor stimulation and increased dopamine transmission results from effects on cytoplasmic second messengers and not from a direct, membrane-delimited transduction mechanism.

In support of activation of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons, Glimcher et al. ${ }^{148}$ found that neurotensin is self-administered into the VTA and Rompre et al. ${ }^{392}$ found that neurotensin microinjection into the VTA facilitates electrical self-stimulation in the hypothalamus (see Table II). However, a reinforcing effect in a conditioned reinforcement paradigm by neurotensin microinjection into the VTA was not observed by Kelley and Delfs ${ }^{250}$. Furthermore, in spite of the induction of dopamine-dependent locomotion by neurotensin microinjection into the VTA, Kelley et al. ${ }^{249}$ have shown that neurotensin produces effects opposite to amphetamine-like psychostimulants in promoting performance in an operant paradigm. This mixture of dopamine-mimetic and neuroleptic-like actions of neurotensin is confusing when trying to identify possible physiological and pathological functions for neurotensin ${ }^{258,334}$. However, the fact that neurotensin and dopamine are colocalized allows 'state-dependent' effects to occur, such that different states of activity of dopamine neurons may result in different ratios of dopamine and neurotensin release. Different stimulation patterns differentially release dopamine in a nonlinear fashion ${ }^{154}$ and Bean and Roth ${ }^{24}$ have shown that low levels of electrical stimulation in the medial forebrain bundle releases dopamine from prefrontal cortical terminals while more intense stimulation co-releases neurotensin. Whether such an arrangement applies to the somatodendritic release of dopamine and neurotensin is unknown.

### 2.4. Procholcystokinin-derived peptides

#### 2.4.1. Peptide family, anatomy and receptor localization.
Procholcystokinin in rats contains five biologically active, chemically identified forms of CCK, all of which contain CCK ${}_{4}$ as the C-terminal fragment, including CCK ${}_{58}$, CCK ${}_{39}$, CCK ${}_{33}$, CCK ${}_{8}$ and CCK ${}_{4}{ }^{112}$. The predominant form of CCK in the mammalian brain is the sulfated and unsulfated octapeptide, CCK ${}_{8}$. Hokfelt et al. ${ }^{197}$ first demonstrated that CCK is colocalized in a subpopulation of dopamine cells in the rat ventral mesencephalon. The percent of dopamine neurons colocalized with CCK varies in a rostrocaudal gradient ${ }^{409}$. The high percentage of CCK neurons colocalized with dopamine is corroborated by finding that 6-OHDA-induced destruction of dopamine cells in the substantia nigra eliminates virtually all of the cells co-expressing mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase and CCK ${ }^{396,408}$. Some species differences have been noted in the extent of colocalization of CCK and dopamine. In humans, the substantia nigra has almost no colocalized dopamine/CCK neurons, while the VTA shows a modest extent of colocalization ${ }^{197,355}$. In contrast, in marmosets the cells coexpressing mRNA for both CCK and tyrosine hydroxylase are present only in the lateral substantia nigra ${ }^{425}$. Similar to humans, little colocalization of dopamine and CCK is observed in hamsters or guinea pigs ${ }^{401}$. By lesioning dopamine neurons with 6-OHDA or employing retrograde triple-labeling techniques it was observed that dopamine/CCK cells in rats project to the nucleus accumbens, striatum, prefrontal cortex and amygdala ${ }^{197,300,409,410,452}$. It is likely that a significant portion of the forebrain innervation in rats is by dopamine/CCK colocalized neurons ${ }^{410}$.

There are two CCK receptor subtypes: CCK ${}_{A}$ and CCK ${}_{B}{ }^{323}$. The CCK ${}_{A}$ receptor has a higher affinity for CCK ${}_{8}$s than CCK ${}_{8}$ or CCK ${}_{4}$, while CCK ${}_{B}$ receptors have an approximately equivalent binding constant for all three ligands ${ }^{208,393}$. The CCK ${}_{A}$ or peripheral-type receptor is discretely localized in the VTA and substantia nigra of primates in very high density, while the CCK ${}_{B}$ or central-type receptor is in low density or absent ${ }^{194}$. As a preliminary note, Hill et al. ${ }^{194}$ mentions that in monkeys sustaining MPTP-induced dopamine depletions the density of CCK ${}_{A}$ receptors in the ventral mesencephalon is reduced. This finding and the

preferential localization to regions containing dopamine perikarya indicate that the CCK<sub>A</sub> receptors are localized to dopaminergic perikarya<sup>194</sup>. Studies using receptor autoradiography in rats do not identify CCK<sub>A</sub> receptors in the VTA or substantia nigra<sup>193,323</sup>. Considering the electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral evidence for the presence of CCK<sub>A</sub> receptors in the ventral mesencephalon of rats (see below), the apparent lack of receptor sites may result from technical problems with the ligands used to identify CCK<sub>A</sub> binding sites (see Hill et al.<sup>194</sup>, for discussion of this point).

### 2.4.2. Electrophysiology and transduction mechanisms.
In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that CCK<sub>8</sub>s increases the firing frequency of dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra<sup>47,70,200,426,446</sup>. In contrast, CCK<sub>B</sub> and CCK<sub>4</sub> are without effect, indicating that CCK<sub>A</sub> receptors are mediating the excitation. Supporting this contention, CCK<sub>A</sub>, but not CCK<sub>B</sub>, receptor antagonists block the excitatory effect of CCK<sub>8</sub>s on dopamine cells<sup>247</sup>. The excitatory effect of CCK<sub>8</sub>s in vivo consists of an increase in both firing rate and burst firing<sup>134,426</sup>, but in vitro no bursting activity is produced<sup>47,446</sup>. Also, depolarization block can be produced in vivo by the application of excess CCK<sub>8</sub>s<sup>426</sup>. The acute administration of either proglumide or the specific CCK<sub>A</sub> blocker, CR 1409, does not alter dopamine cell firing patterns, indicating that dopamine neurons are not subject to tonic CCK input<sup>69,520</sup>. Although chronic administration of CCK<sub>A</sub> antagonists produces modest alterations in dopamine cell firing, this may result from compensatory changes outside the VTA, since the drugs were given systemically<sup>69,520</sup>. Acute or chronic systemic administration of the CCK<sub>B</sub> antagonist, LY262691, decreases the number of spontaneously active dopamine cells in the VTA and substantia nigra<sup>375</sup>, but the lack of a direct effect by CCK<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists on dopamine cell firing indicates that this effect is mediated indirectly.

In contrast to the direct excitatory effect on dopamine neurons, CCK<sub>8</sub>s augments the inhibitory action of D<sub>2</sub> agonists on the firing frequency of dopamine neurons both in vivo<sup>70,199,200,247</sup> and in vitro<sup>47,446</sup>. One report found that systemic CCK<sub>8</sub> and CCK<sub>4</sub> also potentiated the capacity of systemic apomorphine to inhibit dopamine cells, indicating mediation by CCK<sub>B</sub> receptors<sup>200</sup>. However, this action of CCK<sub>8</sub> and CCK<sub>4</sub> has not been replicated and may result from an action by CCK on the vagus nerve which mediates many effects of systemically administered CCK<sup>69,200,247</sup>. Furthermore, the potentiation of systemic quinpirole by CCK<sub>8</sub>s is prevented by systemic pretreatment with proglumide and CR 1409, but not by

the specific CCK<sub>B</sub> antagonist, L-365,260<sup>247</sup>. Thus, although it is appealing to assign the direct increase in cell firing to stimulation of CCK<sub>A</sub> receptors and the augmentation of D<sub>2</sub> receptor inhibition to CCK<sub>B</sub> receptors, most studies concur that both effects are mediated by CCK<sub>A</sub> receptors. A partial explanation for stimulation of the same receptor having opposite influences on dopamine cell firing is that in vitro sampling shows the majority of cells respond with only one effect to CCK<sub>A</sub> receptor stimulation<sup>446</sup>. Whether this segregation reflects an inherent difference in coupling of CCK<sub>A</sub> receptors in different dopamine cells or a 'state-dependent' difference is unknown. The mechanism mediating the enhanced responsiveness to D<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation is also not clear. However, CCK<sub>8</sub>s has been reported to augment the inhibitory action of GABA<sup>69</sup>. GABA<sub>B</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor polarizations are thought to be coupled to the same ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel<sup>274,390</sup>, indicating a possible action by CCK on shared transduction mechanisms (see Fig. 2).

### 2.4.3. Neurochemistry and function.
CCK is released in ventral mesencephalon tissue slices by high K<sup>+</sup><sup>135</sup>. Consistent with the low density of CCK-immunoreactive fibers in the VTA and substantia nigra<sup>271</sup>, it is proposed that this reflects primarily somatodendritic release from colocalized dopamine/CCK cells<sup>135</sup>. Supporting this, similar to somatodendritically released dopamine, the release of CCK is inhibited by the D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> agonist, quinpirole<sup>135</sup>. Based upon the electrophysiological data outlined above, the release of CCK would be expected to amplify the inhibitory effect of D<sub>2</sub> autoreceptor stimulation by co-released dopamine. Consistent with this, Crawley<sup>87</sup> demonstrates that CCK microinjection into the VTA potentiates the inhibitory effect of coadministered dopamine on motor activity. The fact that CCK<sub>4</sub> was approximately equipotent with CCK<sub>8</sub>s and that the specific CCK<sub>A</sub> antagonist, L-364,718 blocked the potentiation of dopamine hypolocomotion only at high systemic doses caused Crawley<sup>87</sup> to speculate involvement of CCK<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulation. This was apparently confirmed by showing that the specific CCK<sub>B</sub> agonist, BC 264, augments the motor inhibition by dopamine in the VTA<sup>95</sup>. The involvement of CCK<sub>B</sub> receptors is inconsistent with the anatomical and electrophysiological evidence, indicating CCK<sub>A</sub> receptor mediation (see above). The fact that a non-specific CCK antagonist, proglumide, does not block the effect on dopamine hypolocomotion indicates that this action of CCK may be non-specific.

Although CCK<sub>8</sub>s stimulates the firing frequency of dopamine neurons, the microinjection of CCK agonists into the VTA does not alter spontaneous motor activity (see Table I)<sup>87,95,501</sup>. Likewise, the microinjection of

CCK does not alter postmortem levels of dopamine metabolites or in vivo extracellular dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens²⁷⁶,⁵⁰¹. In addition to dopamine, miscellaneous interactions between CCK and other neurotransmitters have been observed in the substantia nigra. Systemic administration of the CCK agonist, caerulein, decreases the tissue levels of GABA and glutamic acid in the substantia nigra³²⁷ and in nigral tissue slices, the release of CCK is stimulated by δ- and inhibited by μ-opioid agonists³³.

Consistent with a lack of effect on mesolimbic dopamine turnover²⁷⁶,⁵⁰¹, Pettit and Mueller³⁶³ do not observe a significant effect of CCK microinjection into the VTA in a conditioned place preference test (see Table II). However, intra-VTA pretreatment with CCK potentiated the effect of amphetamine on conditioned place preference in a dose-dependent manner³⁶³. In a related finding, morphine-induced place conditioning was inhibited by systemic administration of the CCK₁ antagonist, devazepide, but not by the CCK₂ antagonist, L-365,260 (ref. 192). These findings indicate that while CCK in the VTA does not elicit reinforcement-related behaviors, it may be permissive to systemic drug reinforcement.

### 2.5. Acetylcholine esterase

Although primarily considered a membrane-bound enzyme mediating the catabolism of acetylcholine, soluble acetylcholine esterase (AchE) exists in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its concentration in CSF is markedly reduced after electrolytic lesions of the substantia nigra⁷³,¹⁷². The release of AchE from dopaminergic dendrites in the substantia nigra occurs in response to the same stimuli that evoke somatodendritic dopamine release (see Greenfield,¹⁶⁹ for a review). Examining nigral dopamine cells in vitro, Greenfield et al.¹⁷¹ demonstrated that soman-blocked AchE produces K⁺-dependent membrane hyperpolarizations. Thus, Greenfield¹⁷¹ proposes that AchE is released by the same high-threshold dendritic Ca²⁺ spike responsible for dendritic dopamine release¹⁶⁸,¹⁸²,²⁹¹ and acts on the cell surface to hyperpolarize dopamine cells. It is known that rebound from a hyperpolarizing pulse can initiate pacemaker firing¹⁶²,²⁵⁶ and it is proposed that AchE-induced hyperpolarization makes the dopamine neurons susceptible to activation of the low-threshold Ca²⁺ conductance by a depolarizing stimulus, which in turn increases cell firing frequency¹⁶⁹. The ultimate activation of nigrostriatal dopamine cells by dendritically released AchE is supported by studies demonstrating the induction of stereotypies and turning behavior following bilateral or unilateral administration, respectively, of AchE into the substantia nigra¹⁷⁰,⁴⁹⁹.

### 3. FEEDBACK REGULATION FROM DOPAMINE TERMINAL FIELDS

The transmitters discussed in this section are localized primarily in afferents to the VTA that arise from neurons located within the dopamine terminal fields in the forebrain. Thus, neurons containing these transmitters are modulated by axonal dopamine release, as indicated by the fact that dopamine lesions alter the levels and/or synthesis of these transmitters (see Reiner and Anderson³⁸⁴ for a review). As outlined below, these transmitters can affect dopaminergic function and are therefore likely to be involved in long-loop feedback regulation.

#### 3.1. Excitatory amino acids

##### 3.1.1. Anatomy and receptor localization

Immunocytochemistry for glutaminase, a synthetic enzyme of glutamic acid, indicates that glutamatergic neurons may be located in the VTA and that many are colocalized with dopamine²⁴³. However, glutaminase is also present in GABAergic neurons and may not constitute the primary synthetic pathway for glutamic acid as a transmitter³⁰⁵. Furthermore, spontaneous membrane potentials mediated by EAA's are not measured in dopamine or non-dopamine neurons in tissue slices from the VTA²¹⁸. Although intrinsic glutamate neurons may not be tonically active, these data are consistent with a lack of glutamatergic neurons in the VTA. Glutamatergic innervation of the VTA arises from three potential sources. An EAA projection from the medial prefrontal cortex has been well characterized using electrolytic and neurotoxin lesions of the prefrontal cortex to produce a reduction in the concentration of glutamic or aspartic acid or glutamic acid uptake in the VTA and substantia nigra⁶¹,⁷²,³³⁶. Carter⁶¹ observed that ablations of the pregenual, but not supracallosal medial frontal cortex resulted in a 40% decrease in glutamate uptake in the substantia nigra. This ablation site corresponds to the site of origin for the corticonigral projection identified by [³H]proline-leucine anterograde tracing²⁸ and this projection is actually more dense to the VTA than substantia nigra. Also, glutamatergic neurons in the pedunculopontine region⁸⁰,³⁹⁸ and subthalamic nucleus²⁵⁵,³⁸⁹ have been shown to project into the substantia nigra. In addition to glutamate and aspartate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is a candidate for an EAA transmitter in the VTA and substantia nigra. NAAG is present in high concentrations in the substantia nigra¹⁴⁰,¹⁴⁵ and may be colocalized in a population of dopamine cells³¹⁸.

Excitatory amino acid receptors have been classified into two major categories. Ionotropic receptors include

the NMDA, kainic acid and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors ${ }^{320}$. The metabotropic receptors include the quisqualate receptor and the receptor identified by L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate ${ }^{462}$. Seven non-NMDA receptor subunits and the voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channel containing the NMDA binding site have been cloned ${ }^{110,313}$. Using monoclonal antibodies, high immunoreactive levels of the AMPA receptor subunits, GluR1, GluR2/3 and GluR4, are found in the VTA and substantia nigra ${ }^{361}$. Also, light microscopic mapping studies of the distribution of [³H]kainic acid ${ }^{321}$, [³H]quisqualic acid ${ }^{63}$ and [³H]NMDA ${ }^{322}$ indicate that a low density of EAA receptor subtypes are present in the VTA and substantia nigra. Examination of a micrograph presented by Monaghan and Cotman ${ }^{322}$ reveals that the highest density of NMDA binding sites are along the midline of the ventral mesencephalon, corresponding to the nucleus interfascicularis and nucleus linearis.

### 3.1.2. Electrophysiology and intracellular transduction.
The iontophoretic application of glutamic acid stimulates the firing frequency of dopamine perikarya ${ }^{162,164,397}$. Both NMDA and non-NMDA receptor stimulation initiates depolarization of dopamine cells ${ }^{219,311}$. The slow component of the excitatory postsynaptic current is mediated by NMDA receptors, while a fast component results from stimulation of non-NMDA receptors ${ }^{311}$. Numerous data demonstrate that EAA input to the VTA is, at least partly, responsible for converting pacemaker-like firing in dopamine cells into burst-firing patterns. Electrical stimulation of the prefrontal cortex converts dopamine neuronal activity into bursting patterns and cooling the prefrontal cortex converts spontaneous burst firing dopamine cells back to pacemaker-like firing ${ }^{142,455}$. Moreover, the local administration of the EAA antagonist, kynurenic acid, inhibits burst firing in dopamine cells, supporting the presence of tonic EAA tone ${ }^{64}$ and applying NMDA to VTA tissue slices or by iontophoresis in vivo induces burst firing ${ }^{220,351}$. The increase in firing frequency by NMDA is produced by increased Na⁺ conductance and the hyperpolarizing current following a burst of action potentials results from activation of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase ${ }^{220}$. The local application of glutamate also increases the firing frequency of non-dopamine cells ${ }^{311}$. Furthermore, focal stimulation of VTA tissue slices depolarizes non-dopamine cells and this is blocked by NMDA (2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid) and non-NMDA (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) antagonists ${ }^{219}$.

Since cooling of the prefrontal cortex eliminates virtually all burst firing (Dr. Johan Grenhoff, Karolinska Institute, Sweden, personal communication), Fig. 3 illustrates a putative model whereby prefrontocortical EAA afferents to dopamine cells stimulate primarily NMDA receptors while input from the pedunculopontine region and subthalamic nucleus stimulate primarily non-NMDA receptors. This could be achieved by either selective innervation of NMDA receptors or using an EAA such as aspartic acid which possesses a slightly greater affinity for NMDA versus non-NMDA receptors.

### 3.1.3. Neurochemistry and function.
Consistent with an excitatory action of EAA receptor stimulation, the microinjection of glutamate receptor agonists into the VTA increases both postmortem measures of dopamine metabolism and in vivo extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (see Table I) ${ }^{233,453}$. Postmortem measures of dopamine transmission reveal that stimulation of NMDA receptors more selectively stimulates dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex, while stimulation of non-NMDA receptors activated mesoaccumbens and mesostriatal neurons ${ }^{233}$. Consistent with an action on mesocortical dopamine cells, the

Fig. 3. Schematic of the modulation of dopamine cells via excitatory amino acids. A hypothetical scheme is presented whereby afferents from the prefrontal cortex utilize aspartic acid to preferentially innervate NMDA receptors on the dopamine neurons. This is an effort to account for the large role prefrontocortical afferents play in regulating NMDA-dependent burst firing. Also illustrated is the recent observation that the bursting induced by NMDA receptor stimulation arises from increased sodium flux and corresponding activation of Na/K ATPase. In contrast to the prefrontal cortex, it is proposed that other sources of EAA input to the VTA utilizes glutamic acid which would also stimulate non-NMDA receptors and not elicit burst firing.

pretreatment of the VTA with the NMDA receptor antagonist, 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), prevents the capacity of acute foot-shock to elevate dopamine metabolites in the prefrontal cortex²³³. One possible explanation for the apparent selectivity of NMDA for mesocortical dopamine cells is a differential localization of EAA receptor subtypes. However, since the mesoprefrontal dopamine neurons have higher spontaneous activity and transmitter turnover than the mesoaccumbens neurons¹⁶,⁶⁸, it is possible that the apparent preferential sensitivity of the mesoprefrontal dopamine cells arises from greater opportunity for NMDA activation of voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ conductance in dopamine cells that are more consistently depolarized⁵¹⁰. Consistent with the latter interpretation, Johnson and North²¹⁹ found both receptor subtypes are present ubiquitously on dopamine and non-dopamine cells in VTA tissue slices. Furthermore, Suaud-Chagny et al.⁴⁵³ found that intraVTA administration of NMDA increased the extracellular level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens as measured by in vivo voltammetry. Araneda and Bustos¹² found that NMDA, but not non-NMDA receptor stimulation promotes the release of preloaded [³H]dopamine from nigral tissue slices. Interestingly, the effect of NMDA on nigral dopamine release was prevented by TTX, indicating the involvement of voltage-dependent Na⁺ conductances and a transsynaptic action¹². Since the effect of NMDA on dopamine release is blocked by the glycine antagonist, strychnine, it is proposed that NMDA may be acting through a glycine interneuron¹².

The microinjection of EAAs into the VTA or substantia nigra produces locomotor activity or turning behavior, respectively (see Table I)²³³,³⁵⁰,³⁷⁰. Motor stimulation is produced by stimulation of either NMDA or non-NMDA receptors. In contrast, two studies found no significant motor alterations following kainic acid or NMDA administration into the substantia nigra²¹⁰,⁴⁷⁵. There is no clear explanation for these negative data. However, the induction of depolarization block to high doses of these compounds could result in a lack of behavioral response.

### 3.2. Preproenkephalin-derived peptides

#### 3.2.1. Peptide family, anatomy and receptor localization
Met- and Leu-enkephalin are synthesized from proenkephalin (PPE)⁸⁶. Extended forms of Met-enkephalin are also cleaved from PPE in the mammalian CNS. Immunohistochemical mapping of enkephalin reveals a modest density of enkephalin fibers throughout most of the VTA¹³⁰,¹⁴⁴,²¹⁶,²⁵⁴ and a low-to-moderate density of enkephalin-immunoreactive neurons and

PPE mRNA expression in the rostral nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus²⁰⁵,⁴⁸¹. Electron microscopic studies reveal that approximately 50–60% of enkephalin-containing terminals form symmetric and asymmetric synapses on dopamine neurons and dendrites in the VTA and substantia nigra²⁰⁵,⁴¹¹. However, the majority of enkephalin-immunoreactive dense core vesicles are oriented away from the dopamine soma and dendrite towards astrocytic processes⁴¹¹, indicating that the site of release of enkephalin may not be onto dopamine neurons. This view is supported by the receptor binding and electrophysiological studies outlined below.

Although the source of enkephalin axon terminals in the VTA may arise partly from intrinsic neurons, neurons expressing PPE mRNA in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum project to the VTA (unpublished observations). Approximately 8% of neurons in the shell of the nucleus accumbens and rostral ventral pallidum that are retrogradely labeled by Fluoro-gold deposits in the VTA are double-labeled with mRNA for PPE. Whether enkephalin coexists in the GABAergic neurons known to project from these structures is unknown. However, enkephalin and GABA coexist in the nucleus accumbens and striatum³⁸⁴,⁵¹⁹, suggesting that coexistence in the projection to the VTA is possible and a population of terminals in the VTA contain both enkephalin and GABA⁴¹².

Enkephalins bind with high affinity to the δ- and μ₁-opioid receptor subtypes. A moderate to high density of μ-receptors and low density of δ-receptors are found in the VTA¹⁰⁸,¹⁰⁹,²⁹⁵. These receptors are not localized on dopamine neurons, since 6-OHDA microinjection into the VTA does not alter μ- or δ-binding density¹⁰⁸,¹⁰⁹. However, excitotoxin lesions of the VTA produce a significant reduction in both opioid receptor densities, indicating that a portion of the receptors is on non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Also, a portion of opioid receptors is localized to striatonigral terminals in the substantia nigra²,⁴⁸⁰. The organization of μ-receptors in the VTA is illustrated in Fig. 4.

#### 3.2.2. Electrophysiology and intracellular transduction
μ-Opioid receptor stimulation in vivo increases the firing frequency of dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra¹⁷⁷,¹⁹⁸,²⁶⁰,³⁰³,³⁴¹. μ-Opioids also inhibit the firing frequency of non-dopamine cells in the VTA and substantia nigra, indicating that the stimulant effect of μ-opioids on dopamine cells results indirectly from inhibition of GABAergic interneurons¹⁷⁷,¹⁹⁸,²⁶⁰,³⁰³. Recent intracellular recordings in vitro demonstrate conclusively that this is the case²¹⁸,²⁷⁵. The μ-agonist, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly(ol) (DAMGO), inhibits only

Enkephalin and Dynorphin

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 4. Schematic of opioid peptide innervation of the VTA. Enkephalin acts on $\mu_1$ receptors which are located on non-dopaminergic perikarya and descending axon terminals. A primary effect is on $\mu$-receptors to inhibit the release of GABA. Dynorphin (DYN) has been shown most consistently to modulate the activity of non-dopamine cells.

administered through a dialysis probe in the VTA produces a 40% reduction in extracellular GABA content ${}^{262}$. This is consistent with an earlier study showing that opioids decrease $[^3\text{H}]$GABA release from nigral tissue slices ${}^{435}$. The reduction in GABA release is associated with a dose-dependent elevation in extracellular dopamine content (see Table I) ${}^{262}$. However, supporting the receptor localization and electrophysiological studies, this effect on dopamine release is indirect, since $\mu$- and $\delta$-opioids do not alter $[^3\text{H}]$dopamine release from rat ventral mesencephalic dissociated cell cultures ${}^{428}$.

The microinjection of morphine or enkephalin analogues into the VTA produces an increase in locomotion that is prevented by blockade of mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission (see Table I) ${}^{48,221,252,445}$. The dose-response curve is biphasic, with high doses decreasing spontaneous motor activity. This may result from diffusion outside the VTA, since intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of high doses of $\mu$-opioids also produces motor depression ${}^{433}$. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the motor depression elicited by high doses of DAMGO injected into the VTA is not inhibited by 6-OHDA lesions of the mesoaccumbens dopamine system ${}^{55}$. Using postmortem and in vivo measures, intra-VTA microinjection of enkephalin analogues increases dopamine transmission in a number of mesocorticolimbic dopamine terminal fields ${}^{52,231,241,283,419}$. Unlike all other forebrain regions examined, the increase in dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex is biphasic with respect to dose ${}^{52,231,279}$. The capacity of $\mu$-opioids administration into the VTA to stimulate axonal dopamine release is augmented following daily administration ${}^{226,231}$. Correspondingly, the acute motor-stimulant response is enhanced ${}^{221,240,483}$. Sensitization of the behavioral stimulant effect following $\mu$-opioid administration into the VTA is also produced by daily systemic administration of cocaine or daily exposure to mild footshock ${}^{115,227}$.

In contrast to an inability to elicit membrane polarizations in either primary or secondary cells ${}^{219}$, $\delta$-selective opioid agonists increase locomotion when microinjected into the VTA ${}^{54,222,279}$. In a dose-response comparison the $\delta$-agonist, DPDPE, was found to be less effective than the $\mu$-agonist, DAMGO, indicating that the $\delta$-response may be mediated by an action on $\mu$-receptors ${}^{279}$. However, Calenco-Choukroun et al. ${}^{54}$ found that the motor-stimulant actions of $\mu$- and $\delta$-agonist injection into the VTA are state-dependent. Thus, $\mu$-agonists produce locomotion only in habituated environments, while $\delta$-agonists increase locomotion in both an adapted and novel environment; which may explain the potency ratio observed by Latimer et al. ${}^{279}$ in

3.2.3. Neurochemistry and function. Supporting an action of opioids on GABA transmission in the VTA, in vivo dialysis was used to demonstrate that morphine
habituated rats. In contrast, Heidbreder et al. ${ }^{190}$ found that the unilateral administration of the $\delta$-agonist, Tyr-D-Ser(otBu)-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr, into the VTA reduces motor activity. A difference in the behavioral response to $\mu$- and $\delta$-agonists was also observed in substantia nigra where $\mu$-opioids induce stereotyped gnawing and $\delta$-opioids increase exploratory behaviors ${ }^{324}$. Also, $\delta$-agonists increase, while $\mu$-agonists decrease nigral release of CCK ${ }^{33}$.

By using inhibitors of enkephalin metabolism, it was shown that endogenous enkephalin release stimulates locomotion. Microinjection into the VTA of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, thiorphan or the inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase N, kelatorphan ${ }^{133}$, produces an increase in locomotion that is associated with an elevation in dopamine metabolism in the nucleus accumbens ${ }^{54,190,236}$. This effect is blocked by depletion of dopamine in the mesoaccumbens pathway ${ }^{55}$ and the microinjection of kelatorphan into the VTA increases extracellular dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens ${ }^{96}$. As with enkephalin analogues, the motor-stimulant response to intra-VTA administration of thiorphan is augmented following daily administration ${ }^{236}$.

Exposure to mild footshock was found to decrease the content of immunoreactive Met-enkephalin in the medial, but not lateral VTA or substantia nigra ${ }^{227}$. Also, the capacity of footshock to elevate postmortem tissue levels of DOPAC in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex is inhibited by pretreatment of the VTA with the quaternary opioid antagonist, naltrexone methobromide ${ }^{227}$. These data indicate that stress-induced enkephalin release may be important in elevating prefrontocortical dopamine transmission.

A consistent literature demonstrates that stimulation of $\mu$- and $\delta$-, but not $\kappa$-receptors in the VTA has reinforcing properties (see Table II) ${ }^{407,508}$. Morphine is self-administered directly into the VTA ${ }^{43,496}$ and pretreatment of the VTA with opioid antagonists inhibits the systemic self-administration of heroin ${ }^{46,478}$. Likewise, rats self-administer $\mu$- and $\delta$-enkephalin analogues directly into the VTA ${ }^{106}$. Also, the microinjection of morphine into the VTA facilitates the reinstatement of systemic heroin and cocaine self-administration ${ }^{441,442}$, lowers brain stimulation reward thresholds and produces robust place preferences ${ }^{42,265,364,507}$. While an action in the VTA by $\mu$-opioids is important, a dose–response comparison shows that methylnaloxonium microinjection into the nucleus accumbens is more effective than injections into the VTA at inhibiting systemic heroin self-administration ${ }^{478}$. Although the microinjection $\mu$- or $\delta$-specific enkephalin analogues into the VTA facilitates intracranial self-stimulation

from the lateral hypothalamus, the augmentation of endogenous enkephalin in the VTA by the microinjection of an inhibitor of enkephalin metabolism, kelatorphan, inhibits self-stimulation ${ }^{190}$. Likewise, using a conditioned reinforcement paradigm, Kelley and Delfs ${ }^{250}$ found that intra-VTA injection of enkephalin analogue or morphine does not alter responding for conditioned reward. However, Kelley et al. ${ }^{249}$ note that intra-VTA microinjection of opioids produces an effect on response profile in an operant task similar to that of amphetamine. This caused them to speculate that the increase in accumbal dopamine release by opioid microinjection into the VTA is sufficient to modify exploratory and operant behaviors but is not a sufficient reinforcement stimulus in their reward paradigm ${ }^{250}$. This hypothesis is consistent with dialysis studies showing that compared to amphetamine-like psychostimulants, the release of dopamine following opioid microinjection into the VTA is relatively weak ${ }^{231,238,419}$. Thus, while there is no doubt that opioid administration in the VTA has rewarding value, the release of endogenous opioids in the VTA may not be a primary modulator reward-related behaviors.

### 3.3. Prodynorphin-derived peptides

#### 3.3.1. Family of peptides, anatomy and receptor localization
The dynorphin family of opioid peptides is derived from the prodynorphin precursor which contains a number of biologically active peptides. One copy each of the two most frequently studied dynorphin sequences (1–8 and 1–13) are contained in prodynorphin, each of which contain the sequence for Leu-enkephalin in the five amino acids of the N-terminus ${ }^{124}$. The concentration of dynorphin in the SNpr is among the highest in the mammalian CNS, while the density of dynorphin fibers in the VTA and SNpc is low to moderate ${ }^{151,295}$. Immunocytochemistry for dynorphin reveals that the immunoreactive dynorphin in the substantia nigra is almost entirely located in fibers ${ }^{124,295}$, an exception being the lateral part of the substantia nigra where a moderate density of dynorphin perikarya are located ${ }^{124}$. The dynorphin fibers in the substantia nigra arise almost exclusively from the striatum ${ }^{125,357,384}$.

Dynorphin is an endogenous ligand for the $\kappa$-opioid receptor subtype. However, in contrast to the high density of dynorphin-immunoreactive fibers, the number of $\kappa$-binding sites in rat SNpr is low ${ }^{295}$. The density of $\kappa$-binding sites is also low in the VTA. In contrast, $\kappa$-binding density in the substantia nigra and VTA of guinea pigs is relatively high ${ }^{132}$.

#### 3.3.2. Electrophysiology, neurochemistry and function
Few studies demonstrating an effect of dynorphin or $\kappa$-agonists on dopamine or non-dopamine cells in theVTA or substantia nigra have been published. The systemic administration of the κ-agonist, U50,488 potently inhibits the firing frequency of SNpc dopamine cells⁴⁹⁰. However, this effect is mimicked by the microinjection of U50,488 into the striatum, indicating an action on striatonigral inhibitory feedback. The iontophoresis of dynorphin has an inconsistent inhibitory effect on neurons in the SNpc²⁸⁰. In contrast, over 70% of neurons in the SNpr are inhibited by iontophoretic dynorphin, arguing for a primary effect by dynorphin on non-dopamine cells (see Fig. 4)²⁸⁰,³⁸⁶,⁴⁶⁸.

Unilateral dynorphin or U50,488H injection into the substantia nigra results in contraversive turning¹⁸⁵,⁴⁶⁹. This effect is augmented by transection of the striatonigral pathway or ibotenate striatal lesions, indicating denervation-induced upregulation of κ-receptors. Dynorphin-induced contraversive turning is not altered by 6-OHDA lesions of the substantia nigra¹⁸⁴,⁴⁶⁹. However, ibotenate lesions of either the ventromedial thalamus or superior colliculus attenuate U50,488-induced turning⁴⁶⁹. Thus, the turning produced by κ-receptor stimulation in the substantia nigra involves modulation of nigrothalamic and nigrotectal pathways and not stimulation of dopamine transmission. Although Tan and Tsou⁴⁶⁰ found that unilateral dynorphin injection increases DOPAC in the ipsilateral striatum, the fact that intranigral κ-agonists decrease in vivo striatal dopamine release argues that the elevation in DOPAC probably results from an increase in intracellular metabolism and not release³⁷⁷,³⁸³. In contrast to the substantia nigra, neither unilateral nor bilateral microinjection of dynorphin or κ-agonists into the VTA alters motor activity²¹³,²¹⁴,²⁴⁰ or dopamine metabolite levels in the nucleus accumbens or striatum³¹⁶.

The stimulation of κ-receptors in the VTA elicits an increase in feeding behavior¹⁸¹. This effect is on the initiation of feeding and not on overall consumption, since Nencini and Stewart³³⁵ were unable to detect an increase in the amount of food eaten. κ-Receptor stimulation in the VTA promotes male sexual behavior in rats³¹⁶. The lack of activation of dopamine neurons in the VTA by κ-agonists (see above) indicates that dynorphin is not augmenting sexual reinforcement. This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that intra-VTA microinjection of a κ-agonist does not alter lateral hypothalamic electrical stimulation reward (see Table II)²¹³.

### 3.4. Preprotachykinin-derived peptides

#### 3.4.1. Family of peptides, anatomy and receptor localization
Three mammalian tachykinins have been extensively studied, including substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA; substance K) and neurokinin B (NKB). These tachykinins are derived from two precursor genes, preprotachykinin A (PPT-A) and preprotachykinin B (PPT-B)³³⁰. Alternative splicing of the PPT-A primary transcript yields multiple mRNAs which encode for SP alone (α-PPT) or SP and NKA (β-PPT and γ-PPT)²⁶⁸,³³¹. Alternative splicing of the PPT-B gene transcript yields two mRNAs, both of which encode a single copy of NKB³³¹. Alternative splicing is species specific; in rats the PPT-A gene yields approximately equivalent amounts of β- and γ-PPT¹⁸, while in bovine brain the predominant mRNA is α-PPT³³¹. The human basal ganglia more closely resembles the rat, with no detectable α-PPT; although the relative concentration of β- to γ-PPT is greater in humans¹⁸. Thus, in rats and humans PPT-A derived mRNAs yield both SP and NKA.

High immunoreactive levels of SP and NKA are found in the VTA and substantia nigra, with the highest concentration being in the SNpr⁹⁰,¹⁰⁴,²⁹⁰. In contrast, relatively low levels of NKB-immunoreactive fibers are found in the SNpc, with none in the SNpr²⁹⁹. Consistent with this localization, the majority of SP and NKA immunoreactivity in the ventral mesencephalon is eliminated by striatonigral lesions⁹,⁷¹,³⁰⁶. The tachykinin projection is partly colocalized with GABA¹⁶⁷. In addition, a smaller tachykinin contribution may arise from SP/acetylcholine or SP/serotonin colocalized projections from the pedunculopontine region or the dorsal raphe, respectively¹⁷⁹,¹⁹⁶,⁴⁸⁴. Since striatonigral lesions less effectively decrease SP immunoreactivity in the VTA and SNpc than in the SNpr and since the morphology of the serotonin and SP innervation of the VTA is strikingly similar¹⁷⁸,¹⁷⁹, it is possible that dopamine perikarya receive a tachykinin input predominantly from the brain stem while the dendrites and non-dopamine cells are innervated by the striatonigral projection. Regardless of the source of tachykinin afferents, synaptic contact with dopaminergic dendrites and soma has been demonstrated in the VTA and substantia nigra using electron microscopy and a portion of the SP-immunoreactive presynaptic elements contain GABA⁸,³⁸,¹⁷⁸,⁴⁵⁹. The majority of synaptic contacts with dopamine cells are symmetric⁸,³⁸,³⁰⁹. Axosomatic and axodendritic contacts exist between SP terminals and GAD-immunoreactive neurons, especially in the lateral SNpr³⁰⁹. Unlike SP and NKA, the striatonigral projection is not the source of NKB in the VTA and substantia nigra. Retrograde labeling from the substantia nigra reveals that none of the striatal cells expressing NKB mRNA project to the substantia nigra⁵⁰. At present, the source of NKB in the ventral mesencephalon is unknown.
Three tachykinin receptors, NK1, NK2 and NK3, have been cloned³⁴⁸ and have relative selectivity for SP, NKA and NKB, respectively³⁷³. However, the three tachykinins possess moderate affinities at all three receptors, indicating that the physiological and especially pharmacological actions of the endogenous tachykinins may result from a partial action on all three receptor subtypes. The relative absence of NK1 and NK2 receptors in the SNpr constitutes a classic example of a mismatch between receptors and endogenous ligand²⁷,⁹⁴,³⁷². Unfortunately, the lack of highly specific ligands for NK receptor subtypes has hampered determining their precise localization in the VTA and substantia nigra. Using a spectrum of radiolabeled tachykinins, Beaujouan et al.²⁷ determined that the substantia nigra and VTA contain a moderate density of NK3 receptors. More recently, the presence of a high density of NK3 receptors in the VTA and SNpc was confirmed using the specific NK3 receptor ligand, [³H]senktide⁹²,⁴⁴⁷. Relatively less [³H]senktide binding was observed in the SNpr.

### 3.4.2. Electrophysiology

An early study found that SP stimulates neurons in the substantia nigra⁹⁷. More recently, the iontophoresis of SP was shown to have no or slight excitatory effects on neurons in the SNpc, but to consistently excite neurons in the SNpr⁸²,³⁶⁷. In contrast, iontophoretic NKA stimulates the firing frequency in 50% of neurons in both the SNpc and SNpr²⁰⁷. Keegan et al.²⁴⁵ used substantia nigra tissue slices to demonstrate that the NK3 agonist, senktide, stimulates the firing frequency of dopamine cells by membrane depolarization without a large change in membrane conductance. In support of the receptor localization, the NK1 and NK2 selective agonists, [Sar⁹,Met(O₂)¹¹]SP₁₋₁₁ and [BAla⁸]NKA₄₋₁₀, respectively, were without effect. In contrast, Overton et al.³⁵² observed that the NK2 agonist, GR64349, most consistently stimulates dopamine firing frequency in the SNpc, while the NK1 agonist, GR73632, and the NK3 agonist, senktide, were relatively inactive. However, in the VTA all three NK agonists consistently increase the firing frequency of dopamine cells. Although the literature is somewhat contradictory, the most consistent observations are that NKA preferentially stimulates dopamine neurons while SP has its primary action on non-dopamine cells (see Fig. 5).

### 3.4.3. Neurochemistry and functional considerations

Calcium-dependent release of SP occurs in the substantia nigra and the release of SP is augmented by stimulation of the striatonigral pathway³¹⁴. A tonic influence by endogenously released SP is shown by the fact that intranigral microinjection of tachykinin antagonists or SP antibodies produces a decrease in striatal

Although cosynthesized electrophysiological studies indicate that NKA more preferentially stimulates dopamine cells while SP produces more consistent effects on non-dopamine cells. The NKA/SP neurons are largely colocalized with GABA, Ach or 5-HT and the source of the NKB afferents is not known. Although NK3 receptors are most clearly identified in the VTA, the tachykinins are illustrated as synapsing on their respective preferential neurokinin receptor subtypes.

dopamine release and nigrotectal GABA turnover⁶⁷,³⁰⁸. An increase in striatal dopamine release by intranigral injections of SP has been shown with microdialysis³⁷⁷,³⁷⁸,³⁸⁰,³⁸¹. Surprisingly, immunoneutralization of SP in the substantia nigra stimulates dendritic release of [³H]dopamine and the intranigral application of SP via push-pull cannula inhibits the release of [³H]dopamine in the substantia nigra, while simultaneously increasing dopamine release in the striatum¹⁹,³⁷⁷, ³⁷⁸,³⁸⁰,³⁸¹. Similar to SP, NKA administration into the substantia nigra stimulates dopamine transmission in the striatum, but in contrast to SP, NKA stimulates dopamine release in the substantia nigra¹⁹. Consistent with this, Friedman et al.¹³⁶ demonstrate that NKA increases tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in cultured substantia nigra cells. Reid et al.³⁸¹ found that while both SP and NKA microinjection into the substantia nigra elevate extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum, only SP elevates dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. This supports earlier postmortem studies showing that SP is more effective than NKA at elevating the tissue levels of DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex⁵²,¹⁰⁴,¹¹⁸. In contrast, intra-VTA microinjection of
NKA significantly reduces the tissue content of DOPAC in the nucleus accumbens<sup>104</sup>.

In support of the neurochemical data, the microinjection of SP or NKA into the VTA elicits an increase in motor activity that is blocked by dopamine antagonists or lesions of the mesoaccumbens pathway 118,230,248,251,444. In one study, NKA was more potent than SP at stimulating locomotor activity<sup>230</sup>. Similarly, microinjection of SP or the NKA agonist, kassinin, into the substantia nigra elicits contraversive turning that is dopamine-dependent<sup>186,461</sup>. As in the VTA, the NKA agonist was most potent<sup>461</sup>.

With advent of more selective NK receptor subtype agonists and antagonists the effect of tachykinins in the VTA and substantia nigra have recently been reexamined. Reid and co-workers<sup>379,382</sup> demonstrate that, although intranigral administration of both SP and NKA stimulate in vivo nigrostriatal dopamine transmission, the effect of SP is selectively antagonized by SP D-Arg<sup>1</sup>,D-Trp<sup>7,9</sup>,Leu<sup>11</sup> and D-NicLys<sup>1</sup>,3-Pal<sup>3</sup>,D-Cl<sub>2</sub>Phe<sup>5</sup>, Asn<sup>6</sup>,D-Trp<sup>7,9</sup>,Nle<sup>11</sup> (Spantide II), indicating that separate receptors mediate the actions of SP and NKA. Elliot et al.<sup>119</sup> find that the NK1 agonist, GR73632 and the NK3 agonist, senktide, stimulate locomotion after injection into the VTA, while the NK2 agonists, GR51667 and GR64349, are relatively ineffective. In contrast, only NK2 agonists stimulate turning after unilateral intranigral injection. Humpel et al.<sup>204</sup> find that intranigral microinjection of the selective NK1 agonist, [Sar<sup>9</sup>,Met(O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>11</sup>]SP or the NK3 agonists, [MePhe<sup>7</sup>]NKB and senktide, increase the tissue content of DOPAC and 5-HIAA in the striatum. The behavioral data of Stoessl et al.<sup>448</sup> are partially consistent with these latter studies by showing that microinjection of senktide into the substantia nigra increases locomotion. However, they found that neither [Sar<sup>9</sup>, Met(O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>11</sup>]SP nor the selective NK2 agonist, [Nle<sup>10</sup>]NKA<sub>4–10</sub>, alter motor activity after intranigral microinjection, although grooming was produced by [Sar<sup>9</sup>,Met(O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>11</sup>]SP. Thus, as with the recent receptor binding and electrophysiological studies, the stimulation of NK3 receptors in the VTA most consistently activates motor activity and dopamine transmission while NK2 agonists were ineffective and NK1 agonists produced mixed results.

Exposure to mild footshock reduces the immoreactive content of SP, but not NKA in the VTA<sup>17,104</sup>. Furthermore, immunoneutralization of SP by infusing a monoclonal SP antibody into the VTA prevents the capacity of footshock to elevate dopamine metabolites in the prefrontal cortex<sup>17</sup>. These data argue that footshock stress may activate mesocortical dopamine neurons, in part, by stimulating the release of SP.

4. OTHER AFFERENTS TO THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND SUBSTANTIA NIGRA

### 4.1. Serotonin

#### 4.1.1. Anatomy and receptor localization
A low density of serotonin immunoreactive perikarya is present in the nucleus linearis and medial VTA which are continuous with serotonin cells in the dorsal raphe<sup>180,437</sup>. A high density of serotonin immunoreactive fibers arriving from the dorsal and median raphe is present in the VTA<sup>128,180,358,422</sup>. The morphology serotonin-immunoreactive fibers varies, with the nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus and nucleus interfascicularis having thick, non-varicose serotonin-immunoreactive fibers and the nucleus paranigralis and nucleus linearis rostralis and caudalis containing thin, varicose fibers<sup>180,187</sup>. Approximately 50% of the terminals labeled with \[^{3}\]H]serotonin formed synaptic contacts and electron microscopy demonstrates the presence of synapses on both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic dendrites in all subnuclei of the VTA, except in the nucleus interfacularis<sup>180,187,332</sup>. A comparison between the number of serotonin terminals and the total number of axon terminals in the VTA reveals that the majority of all terminals in the nucleus paranigralis and nucleus linearis are serotonergic<sup>180</sup>. In some instances the synapses abut astroglia, indicating that serotonin may be released through both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms<sup>187</sup>.

Pharmacological studies and molecular cloning demonstrate a number of serotonin receptors in the mammalian CNS (see Peroutka,<sup>360</sup>; Julius,<sup>223</sup> for reviews). In the VTA and substantia nigra of rats the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor subtypes have been associated with a pharmacological or physiological function. Receptor autoradiography in the VTA and substantia nigra reveals that the vast majority of serotonin receptors in rats and mice are 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> whereas 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors predominate in guinea pigs and humans<sup>356,359,488</sup>. However, both of these receptors have similar distributions<sup>487</sup> and may constitute species differences of a functionally similar receptor type<sup>356</sup>. The highest density of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors is in the SNpr, with substantially less binding in the nuclei rich in dopamine cell bodies<sup>353</sup>. Correspondingly, 6-OHDA lesions of the substantia nigra do not alter the density of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> binding sites. However, lesions of the striatonigral pathway produce a dramatic reduction<sup>353,374</sup>, indicating that the majority of receptors are presynaptically located on striatonigral afferents. This distribution is surprising considering that the majority of serotonergic synaptic contacts are axodendritic<sup>180,187</sup>, and
supports the conclusions of Hervé et al.¹⁸⁷ that much of the serotonin may be released in a non-synaptic fashion. In contrast to 5-HT₁B receptors, there is no evidence from homogenate or in situ binding assays for the presence of 5-HT₂ receptors in the VTA and substantia nigra³⁵³,³⁵⁶.

### 4.1.2. Electrophysiology and transduction mechanisms.
Studies from the 1970's indicate that serotonin has a predominantly inhibitory effect on neurons in the substantia nigra. The iontophoresis of serotonin⁸⁹,¹¹⁴ or electrical stimulation of the dorsal and to a lesser extent the median raphe produces a serotonin-dependent reduction in the firing frequency of dopamine and non-dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra⁹⁸,¹¹⁴,¹²⁸. More recently, Kelland et al.²⁴⁶ found that stimulation of the dorsal raphe produces reliable inhibition of firing frequency only in nigral dopamine cells with a relatively low basal firing rate. Likewise, inhibition of serotonin cell activity by administration of the 5-HT₁A autoreceptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, increases the firing frequency of slow firing dopamine neurons²⁴⁶. Consistent with the location of serotonin synapses primarily on dendrites¹⁸⁰,¹⁸⁷, the iontophoresis of serotonin on distal, but not proximal dendrites, produces a high threshold Ca²⁺ spike which has been postulated to underlie dendritic release of dopamine¹⁶⁸,¹⁸²,²⁹¹. Cinanserin prevents the increase in Ca²⁺ flux by serotonin, indicating involvement of 5-HT₂ receptors; although cinanserin has some affinity at 5-HT₁ receptors⁹⁸,⁵²¹. Supporting a role for 5-HT₂ receptors in regulating dendritic dopamine release, the 5-HT₂ antagonists, MDL 28,133A or ritanserin, prevents the inhibition of dopamine cell firing produced by amphetamine-induced dopamine release¹⁵²,⁴³¹. This could indicate that 5-HT₂ receptors normally facilitate dendritic dopamine release by amphetamine. Alternatively, Sorensen et al.⁴³¹ show that augmenting dopamine synthesis with L-DOPA prevents the blockade of amphetamine-induced slowing of firing frequency by 5-HT₂ blockers. They speculate that 5-HT₂ receptor stimulation is permissive to the increase in dopamine synthesis that is required to maintain a releasable pool of dopamine in the presence of amphetamine-induced release.

Other data indirectly support a role for serotonin in modulating autoreceptor-induced inhibition of impulse generation in dopamine neurons. Trent and Tepper⁴⁷³ found that stimulation of the dorsal raphe inhibits the response of antidromic stimulation from the striatum in the initial segment and somatodendritic regions. This effect is blocked by metergoline and PCPA, indicating a possible action on 5-HT₂ receptors; although metergoline has greater affinity for 5-HT₁C binding sites⁹⁸. The effect is also blocked by haloperidol and sulpiride, indicating that serotonin is promoting autoreceptor stimulation to inhibit the antidromic response⁴⁷³. Alternatively, the facilitation of full spike antidromic activation may result from the depolarization of dopamine cells produced by neuroleptics¹⁶⁰. In another study, Ugedo et al.⁴⁷⁶ observed that systemic administration of the 5-HT₂ antagonist, ritanserin, dose-dependently increases burst firing and the firing frequency of dopamine cells in the VTA and substantia nigra. This effect is prevented by PCPA and suggests that serotonin acts on 5-HT₂ receptors to promote inhibitory tone in dopamine cells. Finally, Kelland et al.²⁴⁶ found that depletion of serotonin with PCPA or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine eliminated the rate-dependent nature of the inhibition of dopamine cell firing by the D₂/D₃ agonist, quinpirole. Thus, instead of being more potent at inhibiting dopamine cells with low basal activity (ED₅₀ = 1.8 μg/kg, i.v.) versus high basal activity (10.6 μg/kg, i.v.), after serotonin depletion all cells were inhibited in a similar fashion by quinpirole (ED₅₀ = 3.7 and 5.1 μg/kg, i.v., respectively).

Two studies provide evidence that stimulation of 5-HT₁B receptors alters dopamine cell activity in the VTA or substantia nigra. By electrically stimulating ventral mesencephalic tissue slices, North and coworkers²¹⁹,⁴⁵⁴ demonstrate that the resulting hyperpolarizing potential in dopamine cells is mediated by GABAₐ receptors. The GABAₐ-dependent polarization is blocked by serotonin²¹⁷ and by the 5-HT₁A/B receptor agonist 1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]piperazine (TFMPP), but not by the 5-HT₁A agonist, N,N'-dipropyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine or the 5-HT₂ agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2,2-amino-propane²¹⁷. Furthermore, the 5-HT₁B antagonist, cyanoindolol, but not the 5-HT₁A/₂ antagonist, spiperone, prevents the action of serotonin. Since serotonin does not reduce the polarization produced by direct application of the GABAₐ agonist, baclofen, Johnson et al.²¹⁷ conclude that serotonin acts on 5-HT₁B receptors to presynaptically inhibit GABA release from accumbal, striatal and pallidal afferents. Such an action by serotonin on 5-HT₁B receptors is consistent with the presynaptic localization of 5-HT₁B receptors revealed by striatonigral lesions³³³,³⁵³,³⁷⁴. Nedergaard et al. (1991) demonstrated that the application of serotonin onto nigral tissue slices increases the firing frequency of dopamine cells. Antagonists to both 5-HT₁A and 5-HT₂ receptors were ineffective in preventing this action of serotonin, indicating that 5-HT₁B receptors may be involved. Fig. 6A summarizes the possible mechanisms by which serotonin may modulate dopamine neurons.

4.1.3. Neurochemistry and functional considerations.

Serotonin produces a dose-dependent release of \[^{3}H\]dopamine from tissue slices of the substantia nigra and VTA\(^{26,502}\). The release of dopamine is Ca\(^{2+}\)-dependent and blocked by cinaserin, suggestive of an action at 5-HT\(_{2}\) receptors\(^{502}\). Guan and McBride\(^{175}\) demonstrate that serotonin microinfusion into the VTA increases the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. However, the effect on dendritic dopamine release results from 5-HT\(_{2}\) receptor stimulation\(^{152,332,431,473}\) and the increase in mesoaccumbens dopamine release results from 5-HT\(_{1B}\) receptor stimulation, since it was mimicked by the non-selective 5-HT\(_{1}\) agonist, TFMPP, but not by the selective 5-HT\(_{1A}\) agonist, 8-OH-DPAT\(^{175}\). Finally, the microinjection of 5-HT\(_{1D}\) agonists into the substantia nigra of guinea pigs (a species expressing 5-HT\(_{1D}\) instead of 5-HT\(_{1B}\) receptors\(^{356}\)) produces contralateral turning which is blocked by systemic haloperidol administration\(^{191}\).

Based upon the electrophysiological findings described above\(^{217}\), the increase in mesoaccumbens and nigrostriatal dopamine transmission may result from the presynaptic inhibition of descending GABAergic afferents (see Fig. 6A).

Consistent with an excitatory action of serotonin on the mesoaccumbens dopamine projection, perfusion of serotonin into the ventral mesencephalon facilitates medial forebrain bundle self-stimulation\(^{376}\). However, lesions of the dorsal and median raphe with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine result in an increase in reinforcement value as measured in an operant task, indicating that serotonin may limit or not promote reinforcement\(^{509}\). Likewise, electrolytic lesions of the raphe nuclei produce behavioral hyperactivity that is associated with an increase in dopamine metabolites in the nucleus accumbens, but not prefrontal cortex\(^{188,189,512}\). Assuming that the effect of raphe lesions is on serotonin innervation of dopamine perikarya and not axon terminals, these studies support an inhibitory action of serotonin on mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission while pharmacological application of serotonin agonists produces stimulation. This indicates that the responsiveness of mesencephalic dopamine cells to serotonin is biphasic. Basal endogenous release may act primarily on 5-HT\(_{2}\) receptors to promote dopamine autoreceptor stimulation and the resulting membrane hyperpolarization by increasing dendritic dopamine release (see Fig. 6A). However, when serotonin release is increased, the stimulation of 5-HT\(_{1B}\) receptors activates dopamine cells by removing descending GABA tone\(^{217}\).

4.2. Acetylcholine

4.2.1. Anatomy and receptor localization. Acetylcholine\(^{211}\), its synthetic enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)\(^{263}\) and its catabolic enzyme, acetylcholine esterase (AchE)\(^{169}\) are present in high concentrations in the VTA and substantia nigra. The cholinergic innervation is thought to arise primarily from the pedunculopontine tegmental and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei\(^{31,32,77,155,282,301}\). However, a study by Lee et al.\(^{282}\) concludes that the bulk of the projection from the acetylcholine-rich nuclei in the pons is not cholinergic.

**Fig. 6. Schematic showing the regulation of dopamine cells by serotonin and acetylcholine.**

A: serotonin arises from the raphe nuclei and is thought to modulate distal dopaminergic distal dendrites via 5-HT\(_{2}\) receptors and GABA release from axon terminals arising outside the VTA via 5-HT\(_{1B/D}\) receptors. Stimulation of 5-HT\(_{2}\) receptors has been reported to promote somatodendritic dopamine release. 5-HT\(_{2}\) receptors also stimulate the synthesis of dopamine. 5-HT\(_{1B/D}\) receptor stimulation presynaptically inhibits the release of GABA.

B: acetylcholine arises from outside the VTA. M\(_{1}\) and nicotinic (Nic) receptors are located on and depolarize dopamine neurons. M\(_{1}\) receptors act via inhibiting K\(^{+}\)flux and stimulating Ca\(^{2+}\) currents which promotes somatodendritic dopamine release. M\(_{2}\) receptors are located presynaptically and may act partly at autoreceptors on cholinergic afferents.

Some ChAT-immunoreactive cell bodies are found in the lateral substantia nigra, but appear to be ectopically placed from cells continuous with the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus<sup>301</sup>. In spite of the low density of cholinergic innervation from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus<sup>282</sup>, the recent electron microscopic study by Bolam et al.<sup>37</sup> clearly demonstrates that ChAT-immunoreactive terminals form synapses which abut on tyrosine hydroxylase positive soma and dendrites in the substantia nigra. Consistent with an excitatory transmitter, ChAT-positive asymmetrical synapses were identified in the substantia nigra<sup>37</sup>.

Muscarinic (M₁ and M₂) and nicotinic receptors are found in the VTA and substantia nigra<sup>36,79,85,292,329</sup>. While muscarinic receptors are in highest density in the SNpr, the nicotonic receptors are most densely localized to the VTA and SNpc. The nicotinic receptors are located on dopamine perikarya and dendrites, since 6-OHDA lesions of the VTA and substantia nigra reduce the binding density by as much as 75%<sup>79</sup>. The nicotinic receptors expressed by neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are more akin to those in ganglion cells than the neuromuscular junction. This conclusion is derived from the facts that neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra express mRNA for the α₃ and α₄ subunits, but not the α₂ subunit and that ganglionic blockers are more effective at preventing the effects of nicotine than antagonists specific for the neuromuscular junction<sup>149,150</sup>. Earlier homogenate binding studies with the non-specific muscarinic ligand, [³H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, found that 6-OHDA lesions of the substantia nigra either do not alter or produce a 29% reduction in muscarinic receptor binding density<sup>88,385</sup>. The possibility that the slight reduction in [³H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding may result from a specific reduction in M₁ binding sites is indicated by the fact that of the five genes encoding muscarinic receptors, only m₅ mRNA, which synthesizes M₁ receptors<sup>166</sup>, can be detected in the ventral mesencephalon<sup>495</sup>. Furthermore, 99% of the neurons expressing m₅ mRNA coexpress mRNA for D₂ receptors which is synthesized predominantly by dopamine cells in the ventral mesencephalon<sup>495</sup>. Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 6B, M₁ receptors are located on dopamine neurons in the VTA and M₂ receptors are located presynaptically on afferent projections. Both the M₁ and M₂ receptors are located primarily in the SNpr, indicating that M₁ receptors are being expressed to a great extent on dopaminergic dendrites and not soma and that the M₂ receptors are located on axon terminals<sup>329</sup>.

### 4.2.2. Electrophysiology and transduction mechanisms.

The iontophoresis of acetylcholine into the VTA or substantia nigra increases the firing frequency of dopamine and non-dopamine cells<sup>169,286,287,493</sup>. Systemic or local infusion of nicotine also stimulates the firing frequency of dopamine neurons<sup>59,76,173,287</sup>. In the SNpc the amount of burst firing is increased in dopamine neurons demonstrating burst firing activity but in neurons that do not demonstrate spontaneous bursting, nicotine increases firing frequency without initiating burst firing<sup>173</sup>. In the VTA, non-bursting dopamine neurons show no change in firing rate following nicotine, but in spontaneously bursting neurons this pattern of activity is augmented<sup>173</sup>. Systemic administration of the nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine, decreases the firing frequency of dopamine neurons in the VTA, but does not alter either pacemaker-like or bursting activity in the SNpc, indicating a tonic nicotinic input to the VTA<sup>173</sup>. A dose–response comparison between the VTA and substantia nigra reveals that systemic nicotine produces a larger increase in firing frequency of dopamine cells in the VTA<sup>312,498</sup>. Further evidence for activation of nicotinic receptors on dopamine cells was shown by Clarke et al.<sup>77</sup> demonstrating that the microinjection of kainic acid into the pedunculopontine region produces a dose-dependent increase in nigral dopamine cell firing frequency that is blocked by systemic administration of mecamylamine. Although a great deal of information about the effects of nicotine has been derived from studies utilizing systemic administration, these data must be interpreted with caution, since some dopamine neurons also show an increase in activity following nicotine administration in the nucleus accumbens or striatum<sup>312</sup>.

Intracellular recording of dopamine neurons in tissue slices from the VTA indicates that acetylcholine produces a biphasic membrane depolarization<sup>53</sup>. The fast component is nicotinic, since it is blocked by hexamethonium and partially antagonized by κ-bungarotoxin, but not α-bungarotoxin. This is consistent with the fact that κ-, but not α-bungarotoxin binds to nicotinic receptors expressed in oocytes injected with mRNA's that synthesize the α₃ and α₄ nicotinic receptor subunits<sup>39</sup> and that these subunits, but not α₂ are expressed in neurons in the VTA<sup>149,150</sup>. The late component of the acetylcholine-induced membrane polarization is mediated by muscarinic receptors, since it is blocked by scopolamine and mimicked by muscarine<sup>53,272</sup>. Furthermore, Lacey et al.<sup>272</sup> used tissue slices of the VTA and substantia nigra to demonstrate that muscarine-induced depolarization of dopamine cells is blocked by the M₁ receptor antagonist, pirenzepine. Muscarine-induced membrane polarization is dependent on extracellular Ca²⁺ and may involve decreasing K⁺ conductance.

4.2.3. Neurochemistry and functional considerations. The acute systemic administration of nicotine is generally reported to produce an increase postmortem levels of dopamine metabolites or synthesis that is selective for the nucleus accumbens ${ }^{75,107,278,287,317}$. Selectivity for effects on mesoaccumbens versus mesostriatal dopamine has also been demonstrated with in vivo dialysis ${ }^{34,107}$. Furthermore, Fuxe et al. ${ }^{139}$ found an increase in dopamine utilization in the nucleus accumbens, but not striatum in rats exposed to tobacco smoke. The greater potency for mesoaccumbens versus nigrostriatal dopamine neurons is consistent with the electrophysiology showing greater efficacy at stimulating the firing of dopamine cells in the VTA than in the substantia nigra ${ }^{312,498}$. The stimulation of dopamine neurons is also consistent with the fact that systemic nicotine produces an increase in locomotor activity that is abolished by 6-OHDA lesions of the nucleus accumbens ${ }^{75}$. The increase in locomotion following systemic nicotine is not always observed ${ }^{209,399}$ and is considerably enhanced if the drug is given in an habituated versus novel environment ${ }^{343,404}$, or if nicotine is given repeatedly ${ }^{269,270,403,482}$. Likewise, the increase in extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens produced by systemic nicotine is augmented following daily injections ${ }^{34}$. Supporting an action on dopamine cells by systemic nicotine, microinjections of nicotinic agonists into the VTA, but not nucleus accumbens produces an increase in locomotion ${ }^{325,449}$. Also, daily microinjection of nicotine into the VTA produces a progressively greater motor-stimulant effect ${ }^{257}$. In addition to activation of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons, nicotine releases substance P from nigral tissue slices ${ }^{472}$. This indicates that a portion of nicotinic receptors may be on striatonigral substance P-containing afferents, which is consistent with the fact that after dopamine lesions a portion (25%) of $[^{3}\mathrm{H}]$nicotine binding remains in the substantia nigra ${ }^{79}$. Since substance P is colocalized in 15–40% of the cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine region, it is possible that the actions of acetylcholine on substance P may be mediated by nicotinic autoreceptors ${ }^{484}$.

Acetylcholine presentation to dendrosomes prepared from the substantia nigra produces a dose-dependent release of $[^{3}\mathrm{H}]$dopamine ${ }^{298}$. This effect is prevented by atropine and pirenzepine but not mecamylamine, indicating mediation by M$_{1}$ receptors. Supporting a role for muscarinic receptors in modulating dopamine neuronal activity, Nijjima and Yoshida ${ }^{337}$ found that stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine region with kainic acid produces ipsiversive turning and an increase in the tissue levels of dopamine metabolites in the striatum that is antagonized by bilateral atropine microinjection into the substantia nigra.

The microinjection of acetylcholine or carbachol into the substantia nigra elicits feeding in both operant and free-feeding tests that is prevented by intranigral pretreatment with atropine ${ }^{503,504}$. The increase in feeding is also blocked by systemic administration of haloperidol, indicating activation of nigral dopamine neurons ${ }^{458}$. Iwamoto ${ }^{209}$ observed that microinjection of carbachol into the substantia nigra increases grooming behavior in rodents. More recently, Torre and Celis ${ }^{471}$ found that the induction of grooming behavior and accompanying elevation in tissue levels of DOPAC in the nucleus accumbens and striatum by $\alpha$-melanotropin microinjection into the VTA is prevented by pretreating the VTA with atropine, but not mecamylamine.

The systemic self-administration of nicotine in experimental animals and humans is readily demonstrated (see Stolerman and Shoaib ${ }^{450}$ for a review). The self-administration behavior is attenuated by 6-OHDA lesions of the mesoaccumbens dopamine projection ${ }^{84,424}$ and by systemic administration of D$_{1}$ or D$_{2}$ antagonists ${ }^{83}$, indicating that activation of mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission is critical in maintaining the behavior. While nicotinic agonists act in the VTA to stimulate mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission (see above), it remains unknown if the reinforcing properties of nicotine arise from a specific action in the VTA and/or nucleus accumbens. The stimulation of muscarinic receptors may also be important in dopamine-dependent reinforcement behaviors. In a conditioned place preference test, rats preferred the compartment in which they received a microinjection of carbachol into the VTA ${ }^{513}$. Also, unilateral microinjection of atropine into the VTA ipsilateral to a stimulating electrode in the lateral hypothalamus produced a dose-dependent increase in the threshold for electrical self-stimulation ${ }^{513}$.

4.3. Glycine and taurine

Glycine binding sites are present in the VTA and substantia nigra ${ }^{176}$ and their density is reduced in Parkinsonian patients, indicating at least partial localization to dopamine cells ${ }^{100}$. Furthermore, the binding of $[^{3}\mathrm{H}]$glycine is displaceable by strychnine, indicating that it is not the glycine binding site modulating the NMDA/Ca${ }^{2+}$ channel. Glycine decreases the firing frequency of dopamine neurons and this effect is antagonized by strychnine ${ }^{81,113}$. However, iontophoretic glycine has a more potent inhibitory action on SNpr neurons than SNpc cells ${ }^{81}$. In vitro intracellular recording reveals that glycine produces inward and outward

currents consisting partly of K<sup>+</sup>, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances<sup>310</sup>. Consistent with an inhibitory action on dopamine cells, glycine administration into the substantia nigra inhibits dopamine release in the striatum<sup>285</sup>. Glycine and taurine also elicit turning behavior when microinjected into the SNpr<sup>242,462</sup>. While the effect of glycine is not dopamine-dependent<sup>462</sup>, electrolytic or 6-OHDA lesions of the nucleus accumbens or striatum inhibit the turning produced by intranigral injection of taurine<sup>242</sup>. Thus, taurine may have actions in the substantia nigra distinct from its effect on glycine receptors.

### 5. CONCLUSIONS

Although a variety of effects on dopamine neurons in the VTA are produced by neurotransmitters, most can be viewed as modulating three primary transmitters, including dopamine, GABA, and EAA's. Dopamine and GABA provide short- and long-loop feedback inhibition, respectively, to dopamine neurons. Excitatory amino acids provide a primary depolarizing input to dopamine cells and can stimulate burst firing patterns. This review is concluded from a perspective that the functional state of dopamine cells in the VTA results from the modulation of these three transmitters by the neuropeptide or biogenic amine transmitters. Two transmitters do not fall neatly into this organization. Tachykinins and acetylcholine have a direct excitatory input to dopamine cells that is, at least partly, independent of modulating the actions of dopamine, GABA, or EAA's and will be discussed separately.

#### 5.1. Autoinhibition and somatodendritic dopamine release

The somatodendritic release of dopamine is a primary inhibitory modulator of dopamine cell function. Although classically mediated by D<sub>2</sub> autoreceptors on the dopamine perikarya, D<sub>1</sub> receptors on non-dopaminergic elements in the VTA regulate the activity of dopamine cells by increasing GABA release from intrinsic and descending afferents. Potent autoregulation by somatodendritic dopamine underscores the importance of understanding mechanisms of somatodendritic dopamine release and the intracellular transduction systems mediating the effects of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation. Although somatodendritic dopamine release is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, dopamine is not stored in vesicles<sup>174,232,387,492</sup>. The lack of a vesicular storage pool points to an important role for ongoing dopamine synthesis in maintaining a releasable pool. Thus, the maximum capacity to release dopamine may be limited compared to axon terminals, causing somatodendritic release to be more susceptible to pharmacological or pathological challenges. Likewise, the rapid desensitization of somatodendritic D<sub>2</sub> receptors produced by agonists may define an upper limit for feedback regulation by excessive somatodendritic dopamine release<sup>414</sup>. There is some evidence that exceeding the capacity of D<sub>2</sub> receptors to regulate somatodendritic dopamine release and impulse generation may be responsible for sensitization to psychostimulants and, by inference, may play a role in idiopathic sensitization-like psychopathologies such as psychosis and post-traumatic stress disorder (see Kalivas and Stewart<sup>238</sup> for a review).

In addition to dopamine, other intrinsic transmitters regulate the sensitivity of D<sub>2</sub> autoreceptors. Neurotensin promotes PKA-induced phosphorylation of D<sub>2</sub> receptors<sup>418</sup>. The resulting desensitization of D<sub>2</sub> receptors is a component in the activation of dopamine neurons by neurotensin<sup>413,417,418</sup>. Although stimulation of phosphorylation by PKA implies that neurotensin receptors are linked to adenylyl cyclase, there is no direct evidence to suggest this coupling and it may be that neurotensin is acting through other mechanisms to support the activation of PKA. Endogenous neurotensin can be of somatodendritic origin from neurons colocalizing dopamine and neurotensin or from the high density of neurotensin-containing axon terminals<sup>143,195,206,215,224</sup>. Regardless of the source, the fact that neurotensin receptors are not localized to synaptic specializations indicates that neurotensin acts, at least partly in a paracrine-like fashion<sup>93</sup>.

In contrast to neurotensin, CCK sensitizes some dopamine cells to the inhibitory action of D<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation<sup>47,70,199,200,247,446</sup>. The primary endogenous source of extracellular CCK in the VTA is somatodendritic release from CCK neurons<sup>135</sup>. In many species the bulk of CCK neurons in the VTA contain dopamine<sup>47,197</sup> and CCK release is subject to inhibitory regulation by D<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation<sup>135</sup>. Thus, the autoinhibitory effect of co-released CCK and dopamine would be greater than that of dopamine alone. Some dopamine neurons are excited by CCK but, to some extent, different neurons express one or the other response<sup>446</sup>. Since CCK<sub>A</sub> receptors probably mediate both effects, differences in intracellular transduction determine the cellular response. Whether these differences are a permanent characteristic of each dopamine cell or are state dependent is not known; neither is it known whether neurons projecting to different terminal fields are more likely to express one or the other response. Such information is important in understanding the pathological significance of the increase in
CCK mRNA observed in the VTA of schizophrenics<sup>400,401</sup>.

### 5.2. Modulation and effect of γ-aminobutyric acid release

Although GABA does not alter D₂ receptor function, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated membrane polarizations arise from the same K⁺ conductance as D₂ receptors<sup>274</sup>. Thus, an increase in GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulation could compensate for D₂ receptor desensitization. This is especially likely when D₂ receptor desensitization arises from excessive somatodendritic release of dopamine<sup>414</sup>. Excessive extracellular dopamine would stimulate D₁ receptors located presynaptically on GABAergic afferents to dopamine cells, which in turn augments GABA release<sup>454,470</sup>. In contrast to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulation, feedback from GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors involves a more complicated interaction with secondary, GABAergic perikarya in the VTA. The secondary cells are more sensitive than dopamine cells to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition<sup>81,163</sup>. This probably results from two facts: (1) there is a higher density of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on secondary neurons<sup>74</sup> and (2) secondary cells tend to have a higher firing frequency in vivo which magnifies the effect of their inhibition on postsynaptic elements by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor stimulation<sup>349,493</sup>. Thus, descending GABAergic afferents can directly inhibit dopamine cells via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulation or can stimulate dopamine cells by removing tonic GABAergic input. The conditions favoring an inhibitory or excitatory influence on dopamine cells are not known; neither is it known if GABAergic afferents arising from different nuclei may contribute primarily one or the other influence.

GABA release in VTA is regulated not only at D₁ receptors but also by enkephalin and serotonin. Enkephalin decreases both interneuronal and descending GABA release by stimulating μ-receptors<sup>218,262</sup>, while serotonin acts on 5-HT<sub>1B/D</sub> receptors to specifically decrease the release of GABA from descending GABAergic axon terminals<sup>217</sup>. Thus, increased somatodendritic dopamine-induced stimulation of D₁ receptors indirectly decreases, while enkephalin transmission increases dopamine cell activity. The effect of serotonin on dopamine cells is less apparent. If all descending GABAergic input is reduced equally by serotonin, the effect would be a balance between removal of inhibitory GABA<sub>B</sub> tone on dopamine cells combined with disinhibition of GABAergic interneurons which would increase GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor tone, thereby promote inhibition. Thus, the net effect of serotonin on dopamine cells will depend upon the extent of basal GABA<sub>B</sub> tone on dopamine cells versus the basal tone provided by GABAergic interneurons.

Although more information is required to deduce the functional significance of the regulation of GABA release in the VTA, the balance of GABAergic excitatory and inhibitory influences constitutes an important regulator of dopamine cells and identifying the anatomical and functional circumstances by which they are dissociated is critical to understanding the physiological and pathological regulation of mesocorticolimbic dopamine transmission.

### 5.3. Excitatory amino acids and control of bursting activity

Afferent EAA tone is an important determinant of whether the firing pattern of dopamine cells will be pacemaker-like or bursting<sup>64,142,455</sup>. Although EAA input to the VTA potentially arises from the prefrontal cortex, subthalamic nucleus and pedunculopontine region, the cortical afferents appear most critical in this regard<sup>142,455</sup>. NMDA elicits burst firing patterns in vitro while glutamic acid does not<sup>220</sup>. Since glutamic acid stimulates both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, this indicates that either the endogenous ligand mediating burst firing in vivo has higher affinity for NMDA receptors (e.g., aspartic acid) or that the EAA input to NMDA and non-NMDA receptive cells is segregated. Since both receptor types are present on individual cells, any segregation would be at the level of the synaptic contact. If the cortical input is more directed to synapses expressing NMDA receptors this could explain the apparent importance of this EAA input in modulating burst firing. The facts that bursting activity elicits more dopamine axon terminal release per action potential than pacemaker activity and that bursting elicits release of cotransmitters more readily than non-bursting firing patterns has focused attention on the functional significance of bursting activity<sup>23,154,453</sup>. Sensitization of the mesoaccumbens dopamine system produced by chronic psychostimulant administration or stress is associated with augmented dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens which could result from an increase in burst firing<sup>238</sup>. Likewise, an increase in bursting activity could cue an animal to a reinforcing or conditioned stimulus.

### 5.4. Tachykinins and acetylcholine

Similar to EAAs, both tachykinins and acetylcholine provide a direct excitatory input to dopamine cells. However, unlike EAAs, neither transmitter is involved in regulating bursting activity. A large portion
of the tachykinin input descends from the striatum where it is predominantly colocalized in GABAergic neurons ${ }^{167,384}$. The other two tachykinin afferents are also colocalized with other neurotransmitters; in the raphe nuclei with serotonin ${ }^{179,196}$ and in the pedunculopontine nuclei with acetylcholine ${ }^{484}$. Although electrophysiological studies demonstrate that tachykinins can directly modulate dopamine neurons ${ }^{82,97,207,245,367}$, the extensive colocalization with other transmitters indicates a modulatory role. Thus, the pharmacological actions of tachykinins in the VTA may depend upon the tone provided by cotransmitters. Besides these state-dependent effects, interpretation of the tachykinin literature is hampered by the apparent lack of receptors specific for the tachykinins which are present. Although there is a high density of SP and NKA and substantially less NKB immunoreactivity ${ }^{90,104,290,299}$, the recent development of ligands specific for NK receptor subtypes indicates that NK3 receptors, which possess highest affinity for NKB, are present in greatest density in the VTA ${ }^{92,447}$. Thus, in contrast to other transmitter systems where multiple receptor subtypes subserve a single transmitter, for tachykinins in the VTA and substantia nigra it is possible that there are multiple transmitters competing for a single binding site. Similar to multiple receptors, having three tachykinin transmitters with different affinities for the same receptor allows different levels of activation and each level may facilitate a different range of responses in dopamine cells. This is supported by the observation that while both SP and NKA can activate dopamine neurons, SP decreases while NKA increases dendritic dopamine release ${ }^{19,381}$.

Acetylcholine interacts with multiple receptors in the VTA. The nicotinic and $M_{1}$ receptors are expressed by dopamine neurons while $M_{2}$ receptors are found on afferent terminals ${ }^{79,149,150,329,495}$. Stimulation of both nicotinic or $M_{1}$ receptors increases dopamine transmission in axon terminal fields ${ }^{107,337}$. However, only $M_{1}$ receptor stimulation increases somatodendritic release of dopamine ${ }^{298}$. Thus, stimulation of dopamine neurons by $M_{1}$ receptor activation is accompanied by elevated inhibitory tone via $D_{2}$ autoreceptor activation and nicotinic receptor stimulation is not. Since the cholinergic innervation of the VTA and substantia nigra arises from multiple nuclei ${ }^{282}$, it is possible that different cholinergic afferents may selectively stimulate $M_{1}$ versus nicotinic receptors. However, depolarization of the pedunculopontine nucleus with EAA microinjections appears to activate both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors on dopamine cells ${ }^{77,337}$.
