The transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) contributes to various physiological processes. Here we show that mice with liver-specific deficiency in STAT-3, achieved using the Cre-loxP system, show insulin resistance associated with increased hepatic expression of gluconeogenic genes. Restoration of hepatic STAT-3 expression in these mice, using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, corrected the metabolic abnormalities and the alterations in hepatic expression of gluconeogenic genes. Overexpression of STAT-3 in cultured hepatocytes inhibited gluconeogenic gene expression independently of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), an upstream regulator of gluconeogenic genes. Liver-specific expression of a constitutively active form of STAT-3, achieved by infection with an adenovirus vector, markedly reduced blood glucose, plasma insulin concentrations and hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in diabetic mice. Hepatic STAT-3 signaling is thus essential for normal glucose homeostasis and may provide new therapeutic targets for diabetes mellitus.

An increase in gluconeogenesis in the liver is largely responsible for the enhanced hepatic glucose production and fasting hyperglycemia in individuals with diabetes mellitus¹. The regulation of gluconeogenesis is predominantly dependent on the expression of genes that encode enzymes involved in this process, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 (PCK-1) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6PC)². The pathophysiological significance of the dysregulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes is supported not only by increased expression of these genes in models of diabetes³,⁴, but also by the glucose intolerance induced by overexpression of *Pckl* or *G6pc* in the liver⁵⁻⁸.

The expression of these gluconeogenic genes is controlled mainly by insulin and glucagon⁹. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), however, is also implicated in the regulation of these genes. Treatment of hepatocytes with IL-6 reduces the expression of *Pckl* (ref. 10), and transplantation of an IL-6-producing tumor into mice results in inhibition of liver *G6pc* expression¹¹. In addition, the serum concentration of IL-6 is increased not only in patients with inflammatory diseases¹², but also in individuals with altered metabolic states, such as those associated with physical training or obesity¹³,¹⁴. These observations prompted us to generate mice that lack STAT-3, an important signaling molecule used by the IL-6 family of cytokines¹⁵, specifically in the liver. We now show that liver STAT-3 plays an essential role in normal glucose homeostasis by regulating the expression of gluconeogenic genes. It also provides a new therapeutic target for individuals with diabetes mellitus.

RESULTS

L-ST3KO mice are insulin resistant

We generated mice with liver-specific STAT-3 deficiency using the Cre-loxP system. We crossed Stat3-heterozygous (*Stat3*⁺/⁻) knockout mice¹⁶ with Alb-Cre mice¹⁷, which express the Cre recombinase gene under the control of the albumin gene promoter, to obtain *Stat3*⁺/⁻Alb-Cre mice. We then bred those mice with mice homozygous for a floxed allele of *Stat3* (*Stat3*<sup>flox/flox</sup>)¹⁸. We thus obtained animals with the genotypes *Stat3*<sup>flox/+</sup>, *Stat3*<sup>flox/-</sup>, *Stat3*<sup>flox/+</sup>Alb-Cre and *Stat3*<sup>flox/-</sup>Alb-Cre (L-ST3KO). The presence of loxP sequences in *Stat3* did not affect the abundance of the STAT-3 protein¹⁸, and Alb-Cre mice did not exhibit metabolic abnormalities¹⁷. We therefore used *Stat3*<sup>flox/+</sup>, *Stat3*<sup>flox/-</sup> and L-ST3KO mice for our experiments.

The abundance of STAT-3 in the livers of L-ST3KO mice was <5% of that in the livers of *Stat3*<sup>flox/-</sup> animals; STAT-3 abundance in other tissues did not differ between the two genotypes (Fig. 1a). The body mass of L-ST3KO mice was ~10% greater than that of *Stat3*<sup>flox/+</sup> and *Stat3*<sup>flox/-</sup> mice (Fig. 1b). Although blood glucose concentrations were similar among mice of all three genotypes (Fig. 1c), the plasma insulin concentration of L-ST3KO mice was higher than that of the other two groups of mice at 16 and 24 weeks of age (Fig. 1d). Liver mass did not differ between L-ST3KO and *Stat3*<sup>flox/-</sup> mice (Supplementary Table 1 online), and the histology of the livers of L-ST3KO mice appeared normal (data not shown). The masses of epi-

Hepatic gene expression in L-ST3KO mice

Given that STAT-3 is a transcription factor, it was likely that the altered glucose metabolism in L-ST3KO mice was attributable to changes in hepatic gene expression. The abundance of glucokinase,

G6PC and PCK-1 mRNA was increased ~1.5, 2.4 and 1.5 times, respectively, in the livers of L-ST3KO mice compared with those of Stat3<sup>flox/−</sup> mice (Fig. 2d). In the liver, an increase in the abundance of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α induces the expression of *Pckl* and *G6pc* (ref. 19). The abundance of PGC-1α mRNA in the livers of L-ST3KO mice was ~1.5 times that in Stat3<sup>flox/−</sup> mice (Fig. 2e). Sterol regulatory element binding factor-1 (SREBF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in triglyceride synthesis, including the gene encoding fatty acid synthase (*Fasn*)<sup>20</sup>. The expression of *Srebf1* and *Fasn* in the liver increased ~2.4- and 2.2-fold, respectively, in L-ST3KO mice compared with control animals (Fig. 2d). Consistent with the increased expression of these lipogenic genes, the hepatic triglyceride content of L-ST3KO mice was 1.4 times that of Stat3<sup>flox/−</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). Early events of insulin signaling in the liver, including tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 and phosphorylation of Akt, did not differ between L-ST3KO and Stat3<sup>flox/−</sup> mice after bolus injection of insulin (data not shown).

**Restoration of hepatic STAT-3 in L-ST3KO mice**

Systemic infusion of adenoviral vectors results in liver-specific expression of exogenous genes<sup>5,21</sup>. Infusion of an adenovirus vector (AxCASTAT-3WT) encoding wild-type STAT-3 resulted in hepatic expression of STAT-3 that was ~2.5 times greater than the apparent STAT-3 expression in Stat3<sup>flox/−</sup> mice infused with a control virus encoding β-galactosidase (Fig. 3a). The restoration of hepatic STAT-3 expression resulted in reduced plasma insulin concentration in L-ST3KO mice fed normal chow or a high-fat diet, and reduced blood glucose concentration in L-ST3KO mice fed a high-fat diet (Fig. 3b–e). This was associated with decreased expression of *Pckl*, *G6pc* and *Ppargc1* (encoding PGC-1α) in the liver (Fig. 3f,g). These results suggest that the changes in glucose metabolism apparent in L-ST3KO mice are attributable to the lack of hepatic STAT-3 signaling.

STAT-3 inhibits expression of gluconeogenic genes

We did *in vitro* experiments to further establish a causal link between STAT-3 deficiency and the changes in hepatic gene expression in L-ST3KO mice. Exposure of cultured rat primary hepatocytes to a nonmetabolizable cyclic AMP analog (8CPT-cAMP) and dexamethasone (Dex/cAMP) resulted in an increase in the expression of *Pckl* and *G6pc*, an effect that was inhibited by the additional presence of insulin (Supplementary Fig. 3 online) or of IL-6 (Fig. 4a). Incubation of the cells with IL-6 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 (Fig. 4a), which is essential for its activation of target genes<sup>15</sup>. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of STAT-3 (STAT-3F)<sup>22</sup> by infection with an adenovirus vector prevented the IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT-3, as well as the effect of this cytokine on *G6pc* and *Pckl* expression. STAT-3F did not affect insulin-induced suppression of the expression of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 3 online), however, indicating that the IL-6-induced inhibition of *Pckl* and *G6pc* expression is mediated by STAT-3. In addition, expression of wild-type STAT-3 at a level about five times that of the endogenous protein inhibited *Pckl* and *G6pc* expression (Fig. 4b). *Ppargc1* expression in hepatocytes was induced by DEX/cAMP; this effect was inhibited by IL-6 and paralleled the observed changes in the expression of *Pckl* and *G6pc*. The inhibitory effect of IL-6 was blocked by STAT-3F expression and mimicked by overexpression of wild-type STAT-3 (Fig. 4c). In contrast, neither IL-6 treatment nor overexpression of wild-type STAT-3 in hepatocytes affected the basal or insulin-induced expression of *Srebf1*

Mice were injected with adenoviruses encoding β-galactosidase (LacZ) or wild-type STAT-3 (STAT-3WT). a, Total liver homogenate was subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies to STAT-3, CREB or phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), or subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using antibodies to FOXO-1 and then to immunoblot analysis using antibodies to FOXO-1 or phosphorylated FOXO-1 (pFOXO-1). Blood glucose (b,d) and plasma insulin (c,e) concentrations of mice in randomly fed states were also determined. Total RNA was also isolated from liver and subjected to either northern blot analysis with indicated probes (f) or to RT-PCR analysis with primers for PGC-1α (g).

(a,c) Primary cultured hepatocytes were infected or not with AxCASTAT-3F vector at indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI; plaque-forming units per cell), and incubated with or without IL-6. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to STAT-3 or tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-3 (pSTAT-3) (a, top two panels). Above experiment was repeated with or without Dex/cAMP (a, bottom three panels, and c). Total RNA was subjected to either northern blot (a, bottom three panels) or RT-PCR analysis (c).

(b) Cells infected or not with AxCASTAT-3WT (encoding wild-type STAT-3) were incubated with or without Dex/cAMP. Total RNA was subjected to either northern blot (b, bottom three panels) or RT-PCR analysis (c). Total lysates of cells not exposed to Dex/cAMP were also subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to STAT-3 (b, top panel).

(d) Primary cultured hepatocytes were incubated or not with IL-6 or insulin, in the presence or absence of Ly294002. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with or without prior immunoprecipitation (IP), using antibodies to tyrosine-phosphorylated FOXO-1, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-3 or STAT-3.

(e) Primary cultured hepatocytes were incubated with or without Dex/cAMP, in the absence or presence of IL-6 or Ly294002. Total RNA was subjected to northern blot analysis.

(f) HL1C cells were infected or not with AxCASTAT-3-WT and incubated with or without Dex/cAMP, in the absence or presence of IL-6 or Ly294002. Total cell lysates were subjected to CAT assay.

(g) Fao cells were infected with adenovirus encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged FOXO-1 and coinfected or not with AxCASTAT-3WT. Cells were then incubated with or without insulin, in the presence or absence of Ly294002. Nuclear extracts or total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to HA. Northern blot and immunoblot data are representative of three independent experiments; RT-PCR and CAT data are mean ± s.e.m. of values from three experiments.

(Fig. 4f). Ly294002 augmented Dex/cAMP-induced CAT activity, whereas exposure of the cells to IL-6 or overexpression of wild-type STAT-3 inhibited Dex/cAMP-induced CAT activity in the presence of Ly294002. Overexpression of wild-type STAT-3 did not affect the abundance of FOXO-1 protein in the nuclear fraction, which was monitored by exogenously expressed, hemagglutinin-tagged FOXO-1 in Fao rat hepatoma-derived cultured cells, whereas insulin reduced the nuclear abundance of FOXO-1 in a PI-3K-dependent manner (Fig. 4g). These results collectively suggest that STAT-3 inhibits Pck1 and G6pc expression via a PI-3K/FOXO-1-independent pathway whereas the effect of IL-6 may be mediated, at least in part, by PI-3K. This hypothesis is consistent with findings that neither STAT-3 deficiency in the liver nor restoration of hepatic STAT-3 in L-ST3KO mice affected the phosphorylation of FOXO-1 in the liver (Fig. 3a).

The transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) contributes to the expression of Pck1 and G6pc²⁷. The phosphorylation of hepatic CREB in Stat3flx/- mice infused with a control virus was similar to that observed in L-ST3KO mice infused with a control virus or AxCASTAT-3WT (Fig. 3a). Moreover, overexpression of STAT-3 in primary cultured hepatocytes did not affect cAMP-induced phosphorylation of CREB (data not shown), indicating that STAT-3 inhibits Pck1 and G6pc expression through a mechanism that is independent of CREB phosphorylation.

STAT-3 suppression of gluconeogenesis is PGC-1α-independent

Given that STAT-3 inhibits the expression of Pck1 and G6pc, as well as their upstream regulator PGC-1α, we investigated whether the effects of STAT-3 on Pck1 and G6pc expression are mediated through the reduction of PGC-1α expression. Treatment of Fao cells (which do not express PGC-1α²⁴) with DEX/cAMP induced the expression of Pck1. This effect was prevented by overexpression of wild-type STAT-3 (Fig. 5a), indicating that STAT-3 inhibits the

(Supplementary Fig. 4 online) or Gck (encoding glucokinase; data not shown). These results suggest that STAT-3 signaling does not directly influence the hepatic expression of Srebf1 and Gck, and that the increased expression of these genes in L-ST3KO mice is likely to be caused by secondary metabolic alterations, most probably to plasma insulin concentration.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) has a key role in insulin-induced suppression of Pck1 and G6pc expression by inhibiting the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO-1)²³,²⁴. In primary cultured hepatocytes, IL-6 and insulin both stimulated phosphorylation of FOXO-1 (Fig. 4d), which is important for the translocation of FOXO-1 from the nucleus and inhibition of its transcriptional activity²³,²⁴. IL-6-induced phosphorylation of FOXO-1 was prevented by Ly294002, an inhibitor of PI-3K. Pck1 and G6pc expression in hepatocytes exposed to both Dex/cAMP and Ly294002, were greater than in cells exposed to Dex/cAMP alone (Fig. 4e), suggesting that basal PI-3K activity contributes to the suppression of Pck1 and G6pc expression. IL-6 inhibited Pck1 and G6pc expression in Ly294002-treated cells, suggesting that IL-6 suppresses the expression of these genes, at least in part through a PI-3K-independent pathway. HL1C cells, which are cultured hepatocytes stably expressing the Pck1 promoter sequence ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene, are widely used to study the transcriptional regulation of Pck1 (refs. 25, 26). Exposure of HL1C cells to Dex/cAMP stimulated CAT activity, which was inhibited by the addition of IL-6 or by overexpression of wild-type STAT-3

expression of *Pckl* in the absence of PGC-1α. Infection of Fao cells with an adenovirus vector encoding PGC-1α increased *Pckl* and *G6pc* expression (Fig. 5b), consistent with a previous report<sup>19</sup>. Coinfection of the cells with AxCASTAT-3WT inhibited PGC-1α-induced expression of *Pckl* and *G6pc* without affecting the abundance of PGC-1α protein. Similar dominant-inhibitory effects of STAT-3 on PGC-1α-induced expression of *Pckl* and *G6pc* were observed in primary cultured hepatocytes (Fig. 5c). These results indicate that STAT-3 is capable of suppressing *Pckl* and *G6pc* expression in a PGC-1α-independent manner.

STAT-3 ameliorates glucose intolerance in diabetic mice Several animal models of insulin resistance or diabetes exhibit increased expression of *Pckl* and *G6pc* in the liver<sup>3,4</sup>. Given that our data indicate that STAT-3 signaling inhibits the expression of these genes, we attempted to reduce their expression and, consequently, to ameliorate glucose intolerance in diabetic animals by activating STAT-3 signaling in the liver. *Pckl*, *G6pc*, and *Ppargc1* expression was greater in the liver of *Lepr*<sup>−/−</sup> diabetic mice—which lack functional leptin receptors<sup>28</sup>, are obese and exhibit insulin resistance and diabetes—than in the liver of control (*Lepr*<sup>+/−</sup>) mice (Fig. 6b,c).

In the livers of *Lepr*⁻/⁻ mice infused with saline, endogenous STAT-3 protein was hardly detectable by immunohistochemistry, whereas more than 60% of hepatocytes of *Lepr*⁻/⁻ mice infused with AxCASTAT3-C were positive for antibodies to STAT-3, indicating efficient gene transfer (Fig. 6a). *Pck1*, *G6pc*, and *Pgpargl* expression in the liver was reduced in *Lepr*⁻/⁻ mice infused with AxCASTAT3-C, compared with the expression in mice infused with saline or a control virus encoding β-galactosidase (Fig. 6b,c). Blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations in *Lepr*⁻/⁻ mice were markedly reduced by infusion of AxCASTAT3-C (Fig. 6d,e). Expression of STAT-3C in the livers of *Lepr*⁻/⁻ mice also reduced the steatosis (Fig. 6f) and *Srebf1* expression (Fig. 6b) apparent in the livers of *Lepr*⁻/⁻ mice.

### DISCUSSION

We have shown that mice lacking STAT-3 specifically in the liver (L-ST3KO mice) exhibit insulin resistance and, when fed a high-fat diet, glucose intolerance. Restoration of hepatic STAT-3 expression in L-ST3KO mice corrected the metabolic abnormalities of these animals. Activation of STAT-3 signaling by expression of a constitutively active form of STAT-3 in the liver also greatly ameliorated glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in *Lepr*⁻/⁻ diabetic mice. These observations reveal the physiological importance of hepatic STAT-3 signaling in normal glucose homeostasis, and suggest that such signaling is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

*Pck1* and *G6pc* expression was increased in the liver of L-ST3KO mice, a phenotype that was reversed by exogenously expressed liver STAT-3. Conversely, expression of STAT-3C reduced the expression of these genes in the liver of *Lepr*⁻/⁻ mice. Together with our confirmatory results obtained with cultured hepatocytes, these observations reveal an inhibitory role for STAT-3 signaling in the expression of *Pck1* and *G6pc*. Given that hepatic glucose production is largely dependent on the expression of gluconeogenic genes², and that overexpression of *G6pc* (ref. 5) or *Pck1* (ref. 8) in the liver by a factor of only 2 to 3 results in glucose intolerance, the observed changes in the expression of these genes in the liver is likely to be primarily responsible for the insulin resistance of L-ST3KO mice and for the amelioration of glucose intolerance in *Lepr*⁻/⁻ mice after STAT3-C expression. Changes in the abundance of PGC-1α mRNA essentially paralleled those of the gluconeogenic gene transcripts in our in vitro and in vivo experiments. STAT-3, however, can inhibit the expression of *Pck1* and *G6pc* in a PGC-1α-independent manner. It is therefore possible that STAT-3 reduces the expression of *Pck1* and *G6pc* through both PGC-1α-dependent and PGC-1α-independent pathways. The PI-3K/FOXO-1 pathway also has an important role in insulin-induced suppression of *Pck1* and *G6pc* expression²³,²⁴. STAT-3 inhibited the expression of *Pck1* and *G6pc* in the presence of an inhibitor of PI-3K. In addition, STAT-3 did not affect the nuclear abundance of FOXO-1, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of STAT-3 on *Pck1* and *G6pc* expression do not depend on the PI-3K/FOXO-1 pathway.

Hypoglycemia in mice injected with lipopolysaccharide, a model of endotoxic shock, was prevented by the administration of neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 (ref. 30), suggesting that IL-6 induces hypoglycemia during severe infection, probably through the mechanism uncovered in the present study. The serum concentration of IL-6 is increased not only in infectious and inflammatory disease, but also during various physiopathological conditions such as physical training and obesity¹²–¹⁴. The IL-6–STAT-3 signaling pathway in the liver may thus contribute to carbohydrate metabolism during such conditions. However, the development of insulin resistance in L-ST3KO mice indicates that hepatic STAT-3 is important in glucose homeostasis not only in pathological conditions, but also under normal physiological conditions. The identity of the ligands responsible for the STAT-3-dependent regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis under physiological conditions remains to be determined. Although disruption of the IL-6-encoding gene in mice results in insulin resistance and obesity, this phenotype is likely to be attributable to the lack of IL-6 action in the central nervous system³¹; the peripheral effects of this cytokine on glucose metabolism are unclear. We have observed a low level of STAT-3 phosphorylation in the livers of mice under normal physiological conditions (H. Inoue et al., unpublished data), suggesting that continuous, low-level activation of STAT-3 signaling may be necessary to maintain basal expression of gluconeogenic genes.

Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose into adipocytes and the subsequent synthesis of triglyceride from the hexose³². Insulin resistance restricted to the liver might thus increase hepatic glucose output and, concomitantly, promote glucose uptake and triglyceride synthesis in adipocytes as a result of the associated hyperinsulinemia. Such a shift in energy sources may account for the increased adiposity in L-ST3KO mice. Transgenic rats that overexpress *Pck1* in the liver and kidneys exhibit increased body mass and hyperinsulinemia⁷.

We have shown by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments that STAT-3 signaling has a crucial role in the expression of gluconeogenic genes in the liver, as well as in normal glucose homeostasis in vivo. The STAT-3 signaling pathway responsible for the regulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver may thus provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

### METHODS

#### Mice and adenovirus vectors

Mouse experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine. *Stat3*^floxFlox^, *Stat3*⁻/⁻, and Alb-Cre mice were generated as described¹⁶–¹⁸. Only male mice were used for experiments. In experiments examining the effects of a high-fat diet, mice were fed, from 4 to 24 weeks of age, chow containing 30% fat by weight (14% bovine fat, 14% porcine fat and 2% soybean oil). We used PCR to synthesize cDNA encoding mouse PGC-1α. cDNAs encoding wild-type STAT-3 and dominant-negative STAT-3 (STAT-3F), in which Tyr705 is replaced by phenylalanine, were as described²². The cDNA encoding a FLAG epitope-tagged, constitutively active form of STAT-3 (STAT-3C)²⁹, in which Ala662 and Asn664 are replaced with cysteine, was provided by J.E. Darnell Jr. (The Rockefeller University). Adenovirus vectors containing these cDNAs were generated as described³³. A control virus encoding β-galactosidase was constructed as described³⁴. An adenovirus encoding a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged, wild-type FOXO-1 (ref. 23) was provided by D. Accili (Columbia University).

#### Physiological analyses

Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were done as described²¹. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were done using fasted, conscious mice, essentially as described³⁵ with the following modifications. [3-³H]glucose was infused throughout the clamp study to determine glucose turnover rate. After a bolus injection (10 μCi), [3-³H]glucose was continuously infused at a rate of 0.1 μCi/min for 2 h. For the measurement of basal glucose turnover rate, blood samples were collected 120 min after the initiation of [3-³H]glucose infusion. Insulin was infused at a rate of 2.5 mU/kg for 120 min, while 40% glucose was infused by variable infusion pump. Blood samples from tail-tip bleeds were collected every 10 min for glucose estimation. Plasma glucose was clamped at 100–120 mg/dl. While glucose levels remained steady, three blood samples were taken for determination of [3-³H]glucose-specific activity. Analysis of [3-³H]glucose measurements and calculation of glucose disposal rates and hepatic glucose production rates were done as described³⁵.
ARTICLES

Northern blot, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and hepatocyte cultures. Total RNA (~15 μg) extracted from organs or cells was subjected to northern blot analysis with probes²¹,³⁶ essentially as described³⁷. Autoradiograms were visualized and signal intensity was quantitated with a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fujifilm). Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were prepared and subjected to adenovirus infection as described³⁷. HL1C cells, which contain a Pck1 promoter sequence fused to the CAT reporter gene, were provided by D.K. Granner (Vanderbilt University). For STAT-3 and FOXO-1 phosphorylation experiments, cells were incubated with either IL-6 (50 ng/ml), insulin (100 nM) or Ly294002 (30 μM) for 10 min, and total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to STAT-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-3 (Cell Signaling) or tyrosine-phosphorylated FOXO-1 (Cell Signaling). Antibodies to FOXO-1 for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. CREB phosphorylation was evaluated by immunoblot analysis using antibodies to the phosphorylated forms of CREB (Cell Signaling). For gene expression experiments, cells infected or not with adenoviruses were incubated for 6 h with 500 nM dexamethasone and 0.1 mM 8CPT-cAMP, in the absence or presence of IL-6 (50 ng/ml), insulin (100 nM) or Ly294002 (30 μM). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done with a Sequence Detector (model 7900, Applied Biosystems) using 36B4 mRNA as the invariant control, as described²¹,³⁶. The primers used were as follows: mouse PGC-1α, 5′-ATACCGCAAAGAG-CACGAGAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCAAGAGCAGCGAAAGCGTCCACAG-3′ (antisense); rat PGC-1α, 5′-ATGGTTTCATTACCTACC GTTACAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGCAGGGTCAAAATCGTCTGAGT-3′ (antisense); and rat 36B4, 5′-GACAATGGCAGCATCTAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAACAGTCGGGT-3′ (antisense). The primers for mouse 36B4 were as described previously²¹.

Adenovirus-mediated gene transduction. L-ST3KO mice and Stat3flox/– mice were fed normal or high-fat chow from 4 to 24 weeks of age. Mice were then injected through the tail vein with adenoviral vectors encoding either STAT-3 or β-galactosidase, at a dose of 1 × 10⁸ plaque-forming units. Male Lepr⁻/⁻ mice (C57BL/KsJ-db/db) and control Lepr⁺/⁻ mice (C57BL/KsJ-db/+m; 8–9 weeks of age; Clea Japan) were injected through the tail vein with adenoviral vectors encoding either STAT3-C or β-galactosidase, at a dose of 3 × 10⁸ plaque-forming units. Experiments were done 7 d after adenovirus injection.
