**SUMMARY**  
The gut epithelium self-renews every several days, providing an important innate defense system that limits bacterial colonization. Nevertheless, many bacterial pathogens, including *Shigella*, efficiently colonize the intestinal epithelium. Here, we show that the *Shigella* effector IpaB, when delivered into epithelial cells, causes cell-cycle arrest by targeting Mad2L2, an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) inhibitor. Cyclin B1 ubiquitination assays revealed that APC undergoes unscheduled activation due to IpaB interaction with the APC inhibitor Mad2L2. Synchronized HeLa cells infected with *Shigella* failed to accumulate Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1, causing cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in an IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent manner. IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent cell-cycle arrest by *Shigella* infection was also demonstrated in rabbit intestinal crypt progenitors, and the IpaB-mediated arrest contributed to efficient colonization of the host cells. These results strongly indicate that *Shigella* employ special tactics to influence epithelial renewal in order to promote bacterial colonization of intestinal epithelium.  

**INTRODUCTION**  
*Shigella* are highly adapted human pathogens that cause bacillary dysentery, a disease that provokes severely bloody and mucous-containing diarrhea. *Shigella* belong to the *Escherichia coli* family, but unlike other pathogenic *E. coli*, *Shigella* have no adherence factors. Thus, following ingestion via the fecal-oral route, *Shigella* reach the colon and rectum and translocate through the epithelial barrier via M cells overlying solitary lymphoid nodules. Once they pass through the M cells, *Shigella* infect the resident macrophages and escape from the macrophages’ phagosomes into the cytoplasm, where they multiply and induce rapid cell death (*Sansonetti*, 2004; *Ogawa* and *Sasakawa*, 2006). *Shigella* released from dead macrophages enter the surrounding enterocytes through the basolateral surface by inducing macropinocytosis. After a bacterium is surrounded by the membrane vacuole of an epithelial cell, it disrupts the vacuolar membrane and escapes into the cytoplasm. *Shigella* multiply in the cytoplasm and move intra- and intercellularly by inducing actin polymerization at one pole of the bacterium; this polymerization is required for cell-cell spreading (*Cossart* and *Sansonetti*, 2004; *Ogawa* and *Sasakawa*, 2006).  

While establishing colonization, *Shigella* deliver a variety of virulence determinants, and the major determinants, called effectors, are delivered through the type III secretion system (TTSS) into host cells. For example, after *Shigella* contact epithelial cells, the TTSS is stimulated and delivers effectors including IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, IpgB1, IpgD, and VirA into the host cells; these effectors promote bacterial invasion of host cells (*Ogawa* and *Sasakawa*, 2006; *Parsot*, 2005). One of these effectors, IpaB, plays multiple roles in promoting *Shigella* infection. The IpaB protein delivered into macrophages activates Caspase-1 and induces cell death (*Hilbi et al.*, 1998; *Chen et al.*, 1996; *Zychlinsky et al.*, 1992). IpaB also interacts with CD44 on the epithelial cell membrane and stimulates

bacterial basolateral invasion (Lafont et al., 2002). Upon contact of Shigella with the host plasma membrane, IpaB, together with IpaC secreted at the tip of the TTSS needle, acts as a membrane-pore-forming protein, mediating the translocation of effectors via the TTSS into the host cell cytoplasm (Blocker et al., 1999). IpaB is also delivered into the epithelial intracellular compartment during Shigella infection, but its biological role there is unknown.

The intestinal epithelium self-renews every several days, providing an important intrinsic defense system that limits bacterial colonization (Oswald et al., 2005; Sansonetti, 2004). The fast turnover of intestinal epithelial cells forms crucial physical as well as functional barriers, and this renewal is sustained by vigorous proliferation of epithelial progenitors that migrate upwards from the bottom of the intestinal crypts (Potten, 1998). Indeed, lesions in the epithelial barrier are quickly repaired; if not, commensal and pathogenic bacteria can enter the wound. Nevertheless, many bacterial pathogens, including Shigella, are capable of colonizing the intestinal barriers. As mentioned above, Shigella (as well as many other mucosal Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria) have developed a variety of tactics to manipulate host cell functions in order to avoid or overcome the innate host defense system. Recent studies have indicated that a growing family of bacterial toxins and effectors, termed “cyclomodulins,” interfere with the eukaryotic cell cycle, presumably to the pathogens’ benefit (Oswald et al., 2005). Some of these cyclomodulins, such as the Cytolethal distending toxin (CDTs), are produced by a group of unrelated Gram-negative bacteria that includes S. dysenteriae (Nougayrede et al., 2005). One of the CDTs produced by Campylobacter jejuni possess a deoxyribonuclease I-like activity and causes limited DNA damage when delivered into a host cell nucleus, eventually leading to chromatin disruption (Lara-Tejero and Galan, 2000). Another cyclomodulin, Cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) inhibits host cell mitosis after transfer from enteropathogenic E. coli via the TTSS (Marches et al., 2003). Cells transformed by Cif accumulate 4n DNA content and reinitiate DNA synthesis without dividing, resulting in 8–16n DNA content. G2 arrest of the host cell cycle is associated with the maintenance of Cdk1, a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk), in its premitotic tyrosine-phosphorylated state (Marches et al., 2003). However, the mechanisms underlying Cif-mediated Cdk1 inactivation are unclear. Thus, some cell-cycle inhibitors are anticipated to help prolong the pathogen’s presence by interfering with the rapid turnover of epithelial cells or by harming the local epithelial barrier, allowing the entry of pathogenic bacteria into the subepithelial layer (Lara-Tejero and Galan, 2002).

Cell-cycle progression is stringently controlled by cell-cycle-specific proteolysis that involves the ubiquitination of target proteins by two main types of E3 ligase complexes, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complex (Vodermaier, 2004). The APC is a multisubunit complex that targets substrates for degradation only during mitosis and G1,

and it also targets mitotic Cyclin A and Cyclin B1, allowing mitotic progression. Two proteins, Cdc20 and Cdc20 homolog 1 (Cdh1), bind directly to APC and thereby activate APC during mitosis and in the late mitotic and G1 phases, respectively (Peters, 2002). Mad2 and the spindle assembly checkpoint pathway inhibit APC<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity in response to spindle damage (Nasmyth, 2005), and Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) inhibits both Cdc20 and Cdh1 in S and M phases (Hsu et al., 2002; Reimann et al., 2001a). However, additional APC regulators have been postulated to exist in order to ensure the destruction of APC substrates at the correct time and place. Indeed, recent studies have identified p31-comet as a Mad2-binding partner (Habu et al., 2002). In synchronized HeLa cells, Mad2 forms a complex with Cdc20 during prometaphase and metaphase; once the anaphase checkpoint is satisfied, the Mad2-Cdc20 complex is dissociated by the binding of Mad2 to p31-comet. Thus, p31-comet plays a critical role in relieving inhibition of the Cdc20-containing APC complex (Xia et al., 2004). Mad2L2, also referred to as Mad2B or hRev7 (Chen and Fang, 2001; Cheung et al., 2006; Pfleger et al., 2001) (Mad2L2 hereafter), which shares 25% amino acid identity and 48% amino acid similarity to Mad2, was recently suggested to control APC activation by Cdc20 (APC<sup>Cdc20</sup>) and also to suppress APC activation by Cdh1 (APC<sup>Cdh1</sup>) (Chen and Fang, 2001; Pfleger et al., 2001). Because Emi1 is capable of suppressing APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> activation in human cell lines, it is assumed that Mad2L2’s function is similar to that of Emi1 in controlling the APC activation required for the cell-cycle transition.

In this study we investigated the route of Shigella infection of the intestinal epithelium using rabbit ileal loops at various stages of infection and noted that Shigella are capable of accessing the intestinal crypt after inducing inflammatory responses in the intestinal tissue. We found that the bacterial infection also reduces the proliferation of epithelial progenitors, as shown by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining. The effect was absent following inoculation with a TTSS-deficient—and therefore noninvasive—Shigella mutant, such as the ipaB deletion mutant. More remarkably, we found that after transfer from Shigella into epithelial cells, intracellular IpaB can also be translocated into the host cell nucleus. This observation led us to further investigate the role of IpaB in Shigella infection of intestinal epithelial cells.

## RESULTS

### Shigella IpaB Targets Mad2L2 in Epithelial Cells at G2/M Phase

To explore the role of IpaB delivered into epithelial cells during Shigella infection of intestine, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of HeLa cDNA library and found that IpaB interacted with Mad2L2, an APC inhibitor (Figure 1A). Under these conditions, IpaB was incapable of interacting with other APC inhibitors, such as Emi1 and Mad2 (Figure 1A). The IpaB/Mad2L2 interaction was

confirmed by GST and MBP pull-down assays (Figure 1B). To test the ability of IpaB to interact with endogenous Mad2L2 we infected HeLa cells with WT/IpaBFLAG. This Shigella strain expressed IpaBFLAG from the endogenous 220 kb plasmid (Figure S1A) and carried ΔdapB so that intracellular Shigella would not kill the host cells in medium depleted of diaminopimelic acids (DAP). The expressed IpaBFLAG conferred wild-type TTSS activity (Figure 1C, right) and invasiveness (Figure S1B). In addition, the strain expressed AfaE (Afimbrial adhesin E) from *E. coli* to boost infection of HeLa cells (Philpott et al., 2000). Twenty-one hours after infection of asynchronously dividing HeLa cells, the length of time normally required for a HeLa cell doubling, Mad2L2 was coimmunoprecipitated with IpaBFLAG (Figure 1C, left). We next investigated the intracellular locations of IpaB and Mad2L2 in HeLa cells expressing GFP-IpaB1-312/Myc6-Mad2L2 or GFP-mock/ Myc6-Mad2L2 at the G1/S boundary induced by double thymidine block (DTB) (Figure 2) Myc6-Mad2L2 and the GFP control were detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm from 0 to 15 hr. Although GFP-IpaB1-312 was detected in the cytoplasm by 3 hr after DTB, IpaB and Mad2L2 were

GFP-IpaB1-312 and Myc<sub>6</sub>-Mad2L2 expressed in HeLa cells were visualized after G1/S release. HeLa-expressed GFP and Myc<sub>6</sub>-Mad2L2 were similarly examined. Cells were stained with TRITC-labeled anti-Myc antibody and Cy5-labeled anti-APC3 antibody.

detected in the nucleus between 6 and 12 hr (Figure 2), suggesting that IpaB interacts with Mad2L2 in the G2/M phase.

Mad2, BubR1, Emi1, and RASSF1A are known APC inhibitors in humans (Fang et al., 1998; Hsu et al., 2002; Song et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2001). Since the ability of Mad2L2 to inhibit APC was previously determined only in Xenopus (Chen and Fang, 2001; Pfleger et al., 2001), we generated human anti-Mad2L2 antibody (Figure S2).

When HeLa cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Mad2L2 or -Mad2 antibody, APC3, a component of APC, was coprecipitated (Figure S3A, upper and bottom). When HeLa cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-APC3 antibody Emi1 was coprecipitated (Figure S3A, middle). To identify the cell-cycle phase involved in the Mad2L2/APC interaction, HeLa cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary were lysed at various times after DTB release and immunoprecipitated with anti-Mad2L2,

-APC3, or -Mad2 antibodies. The results showed that Mad2L2 interacted with APC primarily in G2/M phase (Figure S3B). The cell-cycle distribution was monitored by scoring the percentage of spherical cells (Figure S3C) and using FACS analysis of DNA content (Figure S3D).

**Shigella Infection of Epithelial Cells Causes Unscheduled Activation of APC${}^{Cdh1}$**

To investigate whether Shigella affect the proliferation of intestinal epithelial progenitors, YSH6000 (WT/pSU-GFP) were visualized after inoculation into a rabbit ileal loop (Figure 3A). Twelve and eighteen hours after inoculation, WT/pSU-GFP was detected at the bottom of crypts.

WT/pSU-GFP or the $ipaB$ mutant ($\Delta ipaB$/pSU-GFP) was inoculated into rabbit ileal loops, and intestinal tissue was examined 15 hr later. WT/pSU-GFP, but not $\Delta ipaB$/pSU-GFP, destroyed the intestinal villi; on the other hand, PCNA-positive cells in the crypts in Shigella-infected loops were barely detected (Figure 3B), implying that Shigella interfere with the proliferation of epithelial progenitors. HeLa cells were infected with or without $dapB::Km/plL14-Tp$ (bacteria expressing AfaE) (WT) in the presence of DAP for 5 min. When HeLa cells cultured for 24 hr in DAP-free, gentamicin-containing MEM were infected with WT and $ipaB^{WT}/dapB::Km/plL14-Tp$ ($ipaB^{WT}$) ($ipaB$ complement), approximately 20% of the infected

cells, mostly those at G2/M phase, became spherical (Figure 3C) and TUNEL-negative (data not shown), indicating that Shigella infection interferes with cell-cycle progression. This was not the case with ΔipaB/dapB::Km/plL14-Tp (ΔipaB) (Figure 3C). To characterize the spherical cells, DTB-synchronized cells at the G1/S boundary were infected with WT or ΔipaB, and 5 min later the medium was replaced with DAP-free, gentamicin-containing MEM. WT infection resulted in more spherical cells than did ΔipaB infection (Figure 3D, upper panel). Spherical cells with condensed chromatin emerged by 12 hr after infection with the WT bacteria (Figure 3D, lower panel), whereas the cells generated by ΔipaB infection had the metaphase chromosome alignment and spindle organization (Figure 3D, lower panel).

Consistent with the results of Figure 2, spherical cells following WT infection were detected 6 hr after DTB release (Figure 3D), suggesting that Shigella infection led to M phase arrest. Immunoblotting of HeLa cells synchronized in G1/S phase showed that although Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1 accumulated approximately 9 hr after DTB release following ΔipaB infection, they were abolished after WT infection (Figure 3E). WT infection was also followed by an increase in phosphorylated (active) APC, as well as a decrease in Cdh1 (an APC activator), compared with in the conditions following ΔipaB infection. After WT infection, the accumulation of Cdc20 and Plk1,

known substrates of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup>, but not that of APC<sup>Cdc20</sup>, was low, and the level of Cdh1 decreased 6 hr after DTB release of the infected cells, suggesting that APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> undergoes unscheduled activation by Shigella (Figure 3E). This notion was also supported by WT Shigella (dapB<sup>+</sup>) infection of HeLa cells, where the accumulation of Cyclin B1 in WT infection was greatly decreased compared with that of the noninfection control (Figure S4).

To demonstrate the activation of the APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> upon WT infection, we investigated the polyubiquitination level of Cyclin B1 (Figure 4A, left). Approximately 9 hr after DTB release, which corresponded to the G2/M phase, APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> was activated, with the APC interacting with Cdh1 as examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-APC3 antibody (Figure 4A, right). Indeed, when the level of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> activity upon WT infection was examined by measuring the half-lives of APC substrates such as Cdc20, Plk1, and Cyclin B1, the half-lives were decreased relative to that of ΔipaB infection in either asynchronous (Figure 4B) or synchronous HeLa cells (Figures 4C).

IpaB and Mad2L2 Interaction Causes the Deregulation of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> Activity

To define the IpaB portion involved in Mad2L2 binding, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay with various IpaB truncations and found that Mad2L2 shared a binding site with IpgC (IpaB chaperone) on IpaB: residues 61–70

(B) MBP-Mad2L2 bound to Cdc20 and Cdh1. MBP and MBP-Mad2L2 mixed with <sup>35</sup>S-Cdc20 or <sup>35</sup>S-Cdh1 were analyzed on a BAS2000.

(C) MBP-Mad2L2 binding to <sup>35</sup>S-Cdc20 or <sup>35</sup>S-Cdh1 is inhibited by IpaB1-312<sup>WT</sup> in a dose-dependent manner.

(D) In vitro ubiquitination assays for purified APC in the presence or absence of MBP-Mad2L2 or/and IpaB1-312<sup>WT</sup>. The APC was immunopurified from HeLa cell lysates and activated using recombinant Cdh1. The APC activated by Cdh1 was incubated with the N-terminal 100 residues of Cyclin B1-biotin.

(E) The same assay as in (D) but performed with IpaB1-312<sup>N61A</sup>.

(Figure S5)A). Because IpgC acts as the IpaB chaperone required for IpaB secretion via the TTSS (Page et al., 2001), we created Gal4 DBD-IpaB1-100 mutants that bound to AD-IpgC but not to AD-Mad2L2. An IpaB mutant unable to bind MBP-Mad2L2, N61A (IpaB1-312<sup>N61A</sup>), was further investigated (Figures S5B and S5C). By narrowing down the portions of Mad2L2 used in IpaB-binding experiments, we found that residues 150–211 of Mad2L2 were involved in the interaction with IpaB (Figure S6).

To examine the interaction between Mad2L2 and Cdh1, we investigated 293T cells expressing GFP-Cdc20, GFP-Cdh1, Myc<sub>6</sub>-Mad2, or Myc<sub>6</sub>-Mad2L2 and found that more Cdh1 than Cdc20 was precipitated with Mad2L2 (Figure 5A). When <sup>35</sup>S-Cdc20 or <sup>35</sup>S-Cdh1 was mixed with MBP-Mad2L2, Cdh1 and Cdc20 were precipitated by MBP-Mad2L2, but not by MBP alone (Figure 5B). When <sup>35</sup>S-Cdc20 or <sup>35</sup>S-Cdh1 were pulled down after incubation with MBP-Mad2L2 in the presence of IpaB1-312<sup>WT</sup> (at 1.5–24 μM), the amounts of <sup>35</sup>S-Cdc20 and <sup>35</sup>S-Cdh1 bound to MBP-Mad2L2 decreased as the amounts of IpaB1-312<sup>WT</sup> increased (Figure 5C), suggesting that the IpaB/Mad2L2 interaction can activate APC<sup>Cdh1</sup>. Indeed, polyubiquitination of Cyclin B1 by Cdh1-activated APC was almost completely blocked by MBP-Mad2L2, but the blockage was absent in the presence of IpaB1-312<sup>WT</sup> (Figure 5D). Abrogation of Cyclin B1 polyubiquitination by MBP-Mad2L2 was not prevented by IpaB1-312<sup>N61A</sup> (Figure 5E), adding further evidence that the IpaB/Mad2L2 interaction promotes unscheduled APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> activation.

To confirm these findings, HeLa cells transfected with Mad2L2-RNAi 96 hr prior to synchronization in G1/S phase were re-transfected with Mad2L2-RNAi immediately after the first block, and the levels of Cdc20, Plk1, and Cyclin B1 were examined in cell lysates prepared between 0 and 15 hr after G1/S release (Figure S7). Although Luc-RNAi had no effect, Mad2L2 knockdown decreased the levels of Cdc20, Plk1, and Cyclin B1. The cellular levels of pHistone H3 were also decreased by Mad2L2-RNAi approximately 9 hr after DTB release (Figure S7A). In agreement with this, in Luc-RNAi-treated cells the peak of spherical cells occurred around 9 hr, opposed to a peak around 12 hr for the Mad2L2-RNAi-treated cells (Figure S7B). FACS analysis also showed that 12 hr after DTB release the population at G2/M phase was increased in cells transfected with Mad2L2-RNAi relative to those treated with Luc-RNAi (Figure S7C). Indeed, when pHistone H3-positive cells transfected with Mad2L2-RNAi were examined by immunostaining approximately 9 hr after DTB release, the percentage of positive cells was greatly diminished compared with that of cells transfected with the Luc-RNAi control (Figure S7D).

Involvement of the IpaB/Mad2L2 Interaction in Promoting Bacterial Colonization of the Intestinal Epithelium

To establish the physiological relevance of IpaB/Mad2L2 interaction to Shigella-directed cell-cycle arrest, we replaced the ipaB gene of YSH6000 with ipaB<sup>N61A</sup> (ipaB::Km::ipaB<sup>N61A</sup>) and ipaB<sup>WT</sup> (ipaB::Km::ipaB<sup>WT</sup>) and

The competitive infections were carried out by the following combinations: WT/$ipaB^{WT}$ (n = 12), WT/$ipaB^{N61A}$ (n = 12), and WT/$\Delta ipaB$ (n = 6). *p < 0.05.

confirmed that their TTSS activity and invasiveness were similar (Figures S8A, S8B, and S8C). We also confirmed that the intracellular stabilities of IpaB and IpaB${}^{N61A}$ in synchronized HeLa cells were similar (Figure S8D). We then prepared a series of bacterial mixtures composed of equal numbers of YSH6000 (WT)/$ipaB^{WT}$, WT/$ipaB^{N61A}$, or WT/$\Delta ipaB$, each of which were inoculated into rabbit intestinal ileal loops. Eighteen hours after inoculation, we measured bacterial numbers colonized per 0.5 cm² of intestinal tissues. Although WT and $ipaB^{WT}$ colonized to a similar extent, $ipaB^{N61A}$ showed less colonization (Figure 6A). Moreover, when 2 × 10⁸ CFU of the strains were inoculated into different ileal loops, $ipaB^{N61A}$ and $ipaB^{WT}$, but not YSH6200 (the noninvasive mutant), caused severe inflammatory responses accompanying Shigella invasion of the intestinal tissues 12 hr after inoculation (data not shown). Importantly, though PCNA-positive cells were rarely seen in the cryptic area after infection with $ipaB^{WT}$, many were observed after infection with $ipaB^{N61A}$ (Figure 6B), indicating that the IpaB/Mad2L2 interaction is important for promoting Shigella infection. When HeLa cells synchronized by DTB release were infected by Shigella carrying $ipaB^{WT}$ or $ipaB^{N61A}$, the percentage of spherical cells at 12 hr after release was lower with $ipaB^{N61A}$ than with $ipaB^{WT}$ (Figure 6C). Furthermore, when HeLa cells stably expressing GFP, GFP-IpaB1-312${}^{WT}$, or GFP-IpaB1-312${}^{N61A}$ were synchronized to the G1/S phase by DTB, after release the percentage of spherical cells was higher among cells expressing GFP-IpaB1-312${}^{WT}$ than those expressing GFP-IpaB${}^{N61A}$ (Figure 6E). To confirm this, HeLa cells stably expressing GFP, GFP-IpaB1-312${}^{WT}$, or GFP-IpaB1-312${}^{N61A}$ were synchronized in the G1/S phase by DTB, and after release, the cells that had incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into their nuclei were identified by anti-BrdU-FITC antibody (representing S phase cells) and propidium iodide (PI) staining (representing G1 and G2/M phase cells). Although the numbers of S- and G2/M-phased cells expressing GFP mock and GFP-IpaB1-312${}^{N61A}$ were similar, there were more such cells in cells expressing GFP-IpaB1-312${}^{WT}$ 12–15 hr after DTB release (Figure 6F). Thus, this series of experiments strongly suggested that the retardation of rapid intestinal epithelial renewal, due to the interaction of IpaB/Mad2L2 during Shigella infection, is pivotal to prolonging colonization within the intestinal epithelium.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we have provided convincing in vitro and in vivo evidence that *Shigella* can modulate the cell-cycle progression of intestinal epithelial cells, and that the IpaB effector delivered via the TTSS into a host cell interacts with Mad2L2. This bacterial capability appears to affect epithelial cell turnover by slowing down cell renewal during infection, enabling *Shigella* to persist longer in its replicative niche.

### The IpaB/Mad2L2 Interaction Activates APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> at G2/M Phase

Mad2L2 was previously reported to be a Mad2-related protein capable of binding APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> and inhibiting APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> activation, though the precise role of Mad2L2 in modulating cell-cycle progression remains to be elucidated. Studies indicated that Mad2L2 plays a pivotal role in translesional DNA synthesis (TLS) in S phase cells ([Cheung et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04759); [Murakumo et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04758)), and that it also participates in the spindle assembly checkpoint, similarly to Mad2 ([Reimann et al., 2001b](https://doi.org/10.1038/35085086)). In the present study, however, we did not observe GFP-IpaB1-312 within the nucleus in S phase HeLa cells, implying that IpaB is not involved in TLS. Since IpaB lacks a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and, at 62.2 kDa, is probably too large to enter the nucleus via passive diffusion, we speculate that its entry into the nucleus may occur by complex formation with Mad2L2, which does possess a putative NLS. Mad2L2 shares significant amino acid identity (25%) and similarity (48%) with Mad2 ([Cahill et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1038/11750)). More recent studies have indicated that Mad2L2 can suppress the activation of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> ([Pfleger et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/35085086)). Emi1 is also known to suppress APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> activation at G1/S phase, suggesting that Mad2L2 shows activity similar to Emi1 ([Hsu et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746)). APC activation by Cdc20 is predominant at M phase, at which point the Mad2/Cdc20 interaction suppresses APC activation, while at M/G1 phase APC can be activated by Cdh1 ([Peters, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746)). Mad2L2 is predominantly localized within the nuclei of BHK cells ([Pfleger et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/35085086)), and APC is also detected in the nuclei, suggesting that the Mad2L2 is able to influence APC activity at M/G1 phase. The activity of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> decreases at S phase ([Bashir et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746); [Wei et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746)), at which point Emi1 participates in the inhibition of APC ([Hsu et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746)), raising the possibility that Mad2L2 also takes part in activating APC at either S or G2/M phase. Therefore, using cell lysates prepared from HeLa cells synchronized at G1/S phase, we investigated whether Mad2L2 could control APC activity in M/G1, S, or G2/M phase. Our results of the immunoprecipitation assay with anti-Mad2L2 antibody clearly indicated that Mad2L2 does interact with APC in HeLa cells at G2/M phase ([Figure S3B](#fig-s3b)). Consistently, when GFP-IpaB1-312 and Myc<sub>6</sub>-Mad2L2 were ectopically expressed in synchronized HeLa cells, both signals were detected within the nuclei at G2/M phase ([Figure 2](#fig-2)). Taken together, our results indicate that the IpaB/Mad2L2 interaction participates in the activation of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> at G2/M phase during *Shigella* infection.

### Shigella Infection of Epithelial Cells Causes Cell-Cycle Arrest

The intestinal epithelium self-renews every few days, and its rapid turnover (including the tight sealing of epithelial cell-cell junctions) is the most important intrinsic host defense against bacterial colonization. The ability of *Shigella* IpaB to inhibit cell-cycle progression thus seems to be a bacterial strategy to prolong local persistence by blocking epithelial shedding. In addition, impairing the intestinal epithelial integrity, which also occurs as a consequence of cell-cycle progression inhibition ([Nougayrede et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746); [Oswald et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746)), might further contribute to bacterial entry from the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, also promoting bacterial colonization. Because at its initial stages *Shigella* infection of intestinal epithelium takes place via the M cells, and the bacterial ability to slow cell-cycle progression was also anticipated to be less effective on well-differentiated superficial epithelial cells ([Sansonetti, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746)), we pursued whether *Shigella* could directly access the intestinal cryptic area that is abundant in epithelial progenitors. Using a rabbit ileal loop infection model ([Figure 3A](#fig-3a)) and a guinea pig rectal infection model ([Shim et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb746)), we have shown that *Shigella* infection can enter crypts and infect the cryptic epithelium by 12 hr post-infection ([Figure 3A](#fig-3a)). At that stage, though we detected few epithelial progenitors after WT *Shigella* infection, epithelial progenitors remained abundant after infection with the *ipaB* mutant ([Figure 3B](#fig-3b)). Likewise, the ability of *Shigella* to induce cell-cycle arrest could be reproduced using synchronized HeLa cells infected with WT but not *ipaB* mutant bacteria ([Figure 3D](#fig-3d)). WT *Shigella* infection of HeLa cells generated more spherical cells with condensed chromatin than did the *ipaB* mutant 6 hr after G1/S release; furthermore, the spherical cells were TUNEL negative, implying that the spherical cells were not a consequence of apoptosis. Indeed, because the spherical HeLa cells caused by *Shigella* infection showed poor spindle formation, we assumed that the cell-cycle arrest caused in the infected HeLa cells occurred prior to metaphase. Thus our data indicate that IpaB plays an important role in causing cell-cycle arrest, although we have not excluded the possibility that other *Shigella* proteins might also play a role in affecting cell-cycle progression.

### Shigella Infection of Epithelial Cells Preferentially Activates APC<sup>Cdh1</sup>

If the activation of APC in HeLa cells truly occurred as a consequence of the IpaB/Mad2L2 interaction during *Shigella* infection, one would anticipate that the degradation of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> substrates would also take place. We therefore investigated the levels of Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1, known substrates for APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> and, to a lesser extent, for APC<sup>Cdc20</sup>. Indeed, the levels of Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1 in HeLa cells 9 hr after G1/S release underwent degradation after infecting with WT but not with

Figure 7. Proposed Model of the Role of IpaB in Cell-Cycle Progression Interference

Mad2L2 interaction with APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> increases during G2/M (Figure S3B) and could therefore result in the accumulation of Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1 in G2/M (Figure S7A). Unscheduled activation of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> in G2/M by IpaB (Figure 3E) could explain the mitotic abnormalities in *Shigella*-infected cells (Figure 3D) and, in turn, leads to premature degradation of Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1, a delay in mitotic progression, and faulty mitosis.

the *ipaB* mutant *Shigella* (Figure 3E). As Cdc20 and Plk1 are substrates for APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> but not APC<sup>Cdc20</sup> (Castro et al., 2005), the above results suggest that APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> activation, but not that of APC<sup>Cdc20</sup>, occurred as the *Shigella*-induced unscheduled activation. In this regard, it is worth noting that *Shigella* infection had a smaller effect on the levels of Cyclin A than those of Cyclin B1, Cdc20, or Plk1 (Figure 3E). The fact that Cyclin A is an APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> substrate, and its rate of degradation is slower than that of other APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> substrates (Rape et al., 2006), may explain *Shigella* infection’s smaller effect on Cyclin A degradation than on the other APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> substrates. In any case, our results strongly indicate that an unscheduled activation of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> takes place in HeLa cells at G2/M phase following *Shigella* infection (Figure 4).

In addition to the activation of APC by Cdc20 and Cdh1, the activation of APC is also accompanied by phosphorylation of APC3 (Kraft et al., 2003), an APC subunit, by other host factors. Knockout or -down of Mad2 causes early sister chromatid segregation in the presence of spindle formation inhibitor (Michel et al., 2001, 2004; De Antoni et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2004). In contrast, knockdown of Mad2L2 results in a delay in cell-cycle progression (see Figure S7C). Although Mad2 also contributes to a delay in cell-cycle progression, Mad2L2 can promote cell cycling as do APC inhibitors such as Emi1 and RASSF1A (Hsu et al., 2002; Song et al., 2004). Importantly, upon *Shigella* infection of HeLa cells, the phosphorylation of APC3 was also detected, though the result was not dramatic (Figure 3E). Although we do not understand how APC3 phosphorylation is stimulated by *Shigella* infection, because the levels of Cyclin B1 and Plk1 were greatly decreased, the upregulation of phosphorylated APC3 does not seem to be mediated by Cyclin B1-dependent or Plk1 kinase; rather, other uncharacterized factor(s) may be involved in the phosphorylation of APC3. In HeLa cells infected with WT but not with *ipaB* mutant *Shigella*, the levels of Cdh1 were also remarkably decreased (Figure 3E). As Cdh1 has been shown to undergo degradation by APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> at G0 or G1 phase (Listovsky et al.,
2004), the decrease in Cdh1 after *Shigella* infection is also consistent with bacterial infection-induced unscheduled activation of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup>.

### How Does Host Cell-Cycle Arrest by Shigella Contribute to Bacterial Colonization?

The present study demonstrates that the cell-cycle progression modulated by APC’s ubiquitin ligase activity can be slowed by the delivery of IpaB by *Shigella* into the host cells. How does this activity contribute to the bacterial colonization of the intestinal epithelium? As noted above, as the rapid turnover of epithelial layers limits bacterial colonization, it is possible that slowing this turnover could prolong *Shigella*’s replicative foothold. Although the situation is different than with *Shigella*, a similar hypothesis was recently postulated for *Trichuris trichuria*, a cecal-dwelling parasitic nematode. In the case of *Trichuris*, an increase in the rate of epithelial cell turnover in murine large intestines acted as an “epithelial escalator” to efficiently expel *Trichuris* (Cliffe et al., 2005). To investigate this idea, we created IpaB<sup>N61A</sup>, a single amino acid-substituted IpaB mutant, which interacts more weakly with Mad2L2 (Figure S5) but still functions as a TTSS translocator (Figures S8A and S8B) and supports bacterial invasion of epithelial cells (Figure S8C). We compared this mutant’s ability to deregulate APC activity via Mad2L2 to that of WT IpaB in a Cyclin B1 ubiquitination assay. The results clearly showed that the inhibition of APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> by Mad2L2, as examined by the Cyclin B1 ubiquitination level, was reduced by the addition of IpaB but not IpaB<sup>N61A</sup> into the assay medium (Figures 5D and 5E). Importantly, when a bacteria mixture composed of an equal number of *Shigella* expressing IpaB and *Shigella* expressing IpaB<sup>N61A</sup> was inoculated into rabbit ileal loops, the colonization rate of *Shigella* expressing IpaB was much more efficient than that of *Shigella* expressing IpaB<sup>N61A</sup> (Figure 6A), further supporting the idea that the IpaB/Mad2L2 interaction is functionally important for bacterial colonization. In further support of our hypothesis, it has become increasingly evident that certain cyclomodulins, bacterial toxins, and effectors that modulate the eukaryotic cell cycle can target epithelial cells and control their cell-cycle progression (Nougayrede et al., 2005; Oswald et al., 2005). For example, Cytolethal-distending toxin (CDT), which is produced by a group of unrelated Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, causes cell-cycle arrest in epithelial cells, though the targeted phase of the cell cycle varies between cell types (Lara-Tejero and Galan, 2000; Whitehouse et al., 1998). In these studies, the ability of CDT to cause cell-cycle arrest raises the possibility that prolonging local bacterial existence can be achieved by slowing epithelial renewal.

In summary, our study has provided convincing evidence that *Shigella* influence epithelial cell-cycle progression by delivering IpaB into host cells. Once inside, IpaB interferes with the binding of Mad2L2 to Cdh1, leading to unscheduled activation of APC and subsequent Cyclin B1 degradation (Figure 7). We conclude that the retardation of intestinal epithelial renewal during *Shigella* infection prolongs bacterial colonization of the intestinal epithelium. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that a bacterial TTSS-mediated effector, IpaB, targets epithelial cells and directly modulates their cell-cycle progression by targeting the activity of APC.

#### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

##### Yeast Two-Hybrid Assay
The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with the Matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech), AH109 cotransformed with pGBKT7-*ipaB1*-936, a GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector, and a HeLa cDNA library cloned into a GAL4 activation domain vector, pACT2.

##### Pull-Down Assays
GST-Mad2L2 bound to glutathione sepharose 4B was mixed with recombinant IpaB for 2 hr at 4°C. After centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100-PBS and immunoblotted. The MBP-Mad2L2 bound to the amylose resin was mixed with recombinant IpaB derivatives or <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins and incubated for 2 hr at 4°C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the beads were subjected to immunoblotting after washing with 0.1% Tween 20-PBS eight times.

##### Coimmunoprecipitations
In our endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments, HeLa lysates were spun at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. After adding 2 μg of primary antibody (anti-Mad2, -APC3, or -Mad2L2 antibodies)-protein G-sepharose complex to the lysates, they were placed on ice for 2 hr. Mouse IgG was used as a negative control. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoblotting.

##### Cell Synchronization
HeLa G1/S cells were prepared by double thymidine block (DTB). The cells were first arrested with 2.0 mM thymidine for 20 hr, released into thymidine-free medium for 8 hr, and arrested again by incubation in 2.0 mM thymidine for 16 hr. Synchronous mitotic cells were obtained by incubating for 16 hr in medium containing Colcemid (Demecolcine, Sigma) at 150 ng/ml.

##### RNAi
A small interfering RNA (CAGAAACGCAAGAAGUACA) duplex specific for Mad2L2 repression was transfected into cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

##### Immunohistochemical Staining for PCNA
To identify PCNA-positive crypt cells in the rabbit intestine, tissue specimens fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS were frozen in liquid nitrogen and sectioned by a Leica cryostat (model CM 1900). The sections were fixed for 4 min in acetone at 4°C and then air-dried at room temperature. Sections were prepared and placed in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0), which was brought to a boil in a microwave oven, and the sections were allowed to cool to room temperature. The tissue was neutralized by two rinses in PBS-0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The sections were blocked for 30 min with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 10% goat serum and incubated with primary antibody (anti-PCNA, PC10) at a dilution of 1:100 in the above medium for 60 min. The sections were then rinsed in PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG-FITC, 1:100) for 60 min.

##### Ubiquitination Assay
The ubiquitination assay was carried out as previously described (Kotani et al., 1998). The N terminus of human Cyclin B1 cDNA, encoding

Cell 130, 611–623, August 24, 2007 ©2007 Elsevier Inc. 621amino acid residues 1–100, was inserted into the BamHI-Xhol site of pET21a or Ndel site of pET42a and expressed in BL21 cells. The His-tagged recombinant Cyclin B1 protein was purified and biotinylated using a kit (Pierce). The purified APC was mixed in 30 μl of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 mM MgCl₂, 1.5 mM DTT, 10 mM ATP, 5 μg recombinant E1, 1 μg/ml recombinant E2hC, 1 μg/ml recombinant E2H5B, 20 μg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml recombinant Cdh1, and 10 μg/ml biotinylated Cyclin B1 and then incubated at 25°C for 30 min.

### Competitive Colonization Assay

Rabbit ileal loops were inoculated with 0.5 ml of a mixture (approximately 1:1) of WT (Kmˢ) and *ipaB* mutant (Kmʳ) *Shigella* (total inoculum, 4 × 10⁸ CFU in PBS), and each loop was treated twice with PBS containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Similar-sized tissue specimens obtained with an 8 mm diameter biopsy punch were washed with PBS to eliminate residual gentamicin. The tissue samples were then ground in ice-cold PBS, and a 1/10 dilution was prepared in tryptic soy broth (TCS) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C with aeration. Serial dilutions of this culture were then plated on agar and incubated overnight at 37°C. CFUs were counted and the number of bacteria was calculated per 0.5 cm² of intestinal tissue.

### Flow Cytometry

Cell-cycle distribution was determined by propidium iodide (PI) or PI/BrdU double staining. For PI/BrdU double staining, BrdU was added to the culture medium 30 min prior to harvesting. BrdU incorporation was detected with a FITC-labeled mouse anti-BrdU antibody, and both DNA content and BrdU incorporation were analyzed by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer.

### Statistical Analysis

Values are reported as means ± standard error of the mean. p values were calculated by using a nonparametric one-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test.
