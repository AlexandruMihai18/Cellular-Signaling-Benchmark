Abstract

Osteoimmunology can be defined in a very broad sense as the field of research focusing on interrelations between bone and the immune system. This is a rather opened field that covers at least three different issues. The first one is developmental, that is, organogenesis of the bones and immune systems. The second is post-developmental, that is, the role of the bone in the regulation of the immune response and role of the immune cells on the regulation of bone homeostasis. The third one is related to pathologies: Can immune cells be involved in the development of bone-related pathology? Can deregulation of the bone be causing immune-related diseases? I will not review in detail the bibliography covering osteoimmunology. This has been extensively done in Immunological Reviews (Vol. 208, December 2005) and Current Opinion in Rheumatology (Vol. 18, 2006). I will rather critically comment on hypotheses and concepts in osteoimmunology from a bone biologist’s point of view.

1. OPENING REMARKS: THE OLD AND THE NEW

Osteology is often presented as a new field of research. In fact, the role of immune cells on bone biology has been for long time investigated by bone biologists. Their interest was driven by few observations. First, bone is a hematopoietic organ from which lymphoid and myeloid cell progenitors are originating. Second, one of the cells necessary for bone remodeling is itself of hematopoietic origin: These are the bone-specialized macrophages or osteoclasts. Like other macrophages, osteoclasts are regulated by inflammatory cytokines that are often abundantly produced by immune cells. Indeed, bone remodeling (i.e., the balance between the bone-forming and the bone-resorbing activities) that is necessary for proper maintenance of bone homeostasis is often considered as a controlled inflammatory reaction. Therefore, the effects of numerous inflammatory cytokines on the osteoclast or osteoblast differentiation or activities have been more or less systematically investigated *in vitro* or *in vivo*. This is the case for IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, the TNF family or more recently the interferons (IFNs) (Goldring, 2003; Lee and Lorenzo, 2006).

Newer is the interest that immunologists have for a few years for bone. Immunologists have in the past intensively analyzed the structural organization and the relation of immune cells with the other cellular components of soft immune organs such as spleen, lymph nodes, or thymus. In contrary, they have, for the most, neglected the bone. This was mainly a consequence of the mineralization of bone that rendered histological analyses of the native structures difficult. In addition, demineralization
which allows classical immunohistology destroys the structure of the bone tissue and therefore tends to generate potential artifacts.

# 2. OSTEOIMMUNOLOGY: A DEVELOPMENTAL ENCOUNTER

## 2.1. Bone: Five cell types and two mechanisms of formation

Bone is a highly specialized form of connective tissue that, together with cartilage, constitutes the skeleton. At the cellular level, bone is formed and remodeled by the activity of five different cell types: chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, all derived from mesenchymal stem cells; and chondroclasts and osteoclasts, derived from the monocyte-macrophage lineage ([Karsenty and Wagner, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm754)). Osteoblasts are the bone-forming cells secreting and mineralizing the bone matrix. Osteocytes are the most abundant cells of the bone and are the ultimate stage of osteoblast differentiation. Embedded in the mineralized bone and forming an extensive network of connections between each other, they are believed to serve as biomechanical sensors. Chondroclasts are responsible for resorbing mineralized matrix generated by the chondrocytes, whereas osteoclasts resorb the matrix mineralized by osteoblasts.

During development, two types of ossification can be distinguished. In intramembranous ossification that occurs in the developing flat bones of the skull, condensations of mesenchymal cells of the embryonic connective tissue directly differentiate into osteoblasts, which produce the extracellular matrix that subsequently becomes mineralized. In endochondral bone formation, bone anlagen are first formed by cartilaginous condensation of chondrocytes shaping the future bone. Following resorption of the mineralized cartilaginous matrix by the chondroclasts, these structures will progressively be colonized by both the bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) and the bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts) brought by blood vessels. A cartilaginous structure called growth plate that permits elongation of the bone will subsist at the extremities of the long bones, during fetal development and throughout childhood, and regress with age. In contrast to human, this growth plate will stay active in adult animals that are often used as models to study bone biology, that is, mouse and rat.

## 2.2. The developmental encounter

A primitive hematopoiesis characterized by the presence of limited cell types, that is, embryonic erythroblasts and few myeloid cells, is first taking place during early embryonic development in the yolk sac. The primitive hematopoiesis will progressively be replaced by the definitive hematopoiesis, first in the fetal liver, then in the spleen, and finally accompanying theformation of the bone marrow cavity into the bone. The bone will then become the main hematopoietic organ of the adult. The resorbing activity of the osteoclasts is required to dig the bone marrow cavity, therefore establishing the first relationship between bone and immune cells.

## 2.3. Developmental consequences

The implications of these developmental events are multiple.

- First, the bone will provide the local environment for the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from which all hematopoietic cells including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages are differentiating. Therefore, it can be expected that alteration of bone homeostasis could affect hematopoiesis and, thus, the immune response. Indeed, both osteopetrosis caused by defect in the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts and osteosclerosis due to increased bone formation by osteoblasts lead to a drastic reduction of the bone marrow space and development of secondary extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen or liver.
- Second, the bone is not required for hematopoiesis, and therefore, perturbation of bone homeostasis would not always affect the immune response.
- Third, the close vicinity between immune cells and bone cells strongly suggests that immune cells could also regulate bone homeostasis.

# 3. THE TNF SUPERFAMILY: A DEVELOPMENTAL LINK BETWEEN BONE AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

## 3.1. Osteoclasts differentiation

Osteoclasts are multinuclear cells generated by differentiation of hematopoietic precursors along the monocyte-macrophage lineage ([Karsenty and Wagner, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm759)). Analyses of bone phenotypes in mutated mice have allowed the identification of the two essential osteoclastogenic molecules as the macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) ([Teitelbaum and Ross, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm1004)). The respective role played by each cytokine in osteoclast differentiation is so far understood as follows: While M-CSF promotes proliferation and the survival of the osteoclast progenitors at the expense of the other myelomonocytic lineages (dendritic cells or granulocytes) ([Miyamoto et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/88363)), RANKL prompts the cells to differentiate along the osteoclast lineage. RANKL also acts as an activating and survival factor for the mature osteoclasts ([Wong et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1038/13955)). Thus, RANKL is the osteoclast differentiating factor. It was first characterized as a ligand for the osteoclast inhibitory factor osteoprotegerin (OPG), a circulating decoy receptor
belonging to the TNF-α receptor family (Simonet et al., 1997). RANKL also belongs to the TNF superfamily of cytokines. Following its binding to a receptor called RANK and via intracellular coupling that involves TNF receptor activating factors (TRAFs), among which TRAF6 is playing a determinant function (Lomaga et al., 1999; Naito et al., 1999), RANKL-induced NF-κB, AP-1, and NFATC1 activation, all transcription factors required for osteoclast differentiation (David et al., 2002; Franzoso et al., 1997; Grigoriadis et al., 1994; Iotsova et al., 1997; Takayanagi et al., 2002a).

### 3.2. Immune and bone developmental phenotypes in RANK axe mutated mice

#### 3.2.1. Bone phenotypes
OPG was first identified by sequence homology as a potential secreted member of the TNF-receptor (TNFR) superfamily that, when overexpressed, induced strong osteopetrosis caused by decreased osteoclast number *in vivo*. In vitro, the recombinant protein was shown to directly inhibit osteoclast differentiation (Simonet et al., 1997). In opposite, OPG-deficient mice developed osteoporosis due to increased number of resorbing osteoclasts (Bucay et al., 1998). The natural ligand for OPG (OPG-L) was characterized as RANKL/TRANCE (Kong et al., 1999; Yasuda et al., 1998). The essential functions of RANKL, RANK, and the adaptor protein TRAF6 in osteoclastogenesis were confirmed by gene inactivation. All three deficient mice developed severe osteopetrosis due to impaired osteoclast differentiation (Dougall et al., 1999; Kong et al., 1999).

#### 3.2.2. Immune system phenotypes
Histological analysis of RANK- or RANKL-deficient mice also revealed their essential function in the development of secondary hematopoietic organs. Both mice were characterized by an absence of lymph node (Dougall et al., 1999; Kong et al., 1999). A similar phenotype was also observed in TRAF6-deficient mice (Naito et al., 1999). Therefore, it can be concluded that RANK–RANKL–TRAF6 pathway is a key regulator of both bone and lymph node organogenesis. However, if the upstream signaling events are shared between bone and immune system, a perfect relationship between the two organs cannot be drawn. Indeed, lymph nodes are present in c-Fos or in NF-κB1/NF-κB2-deficient mice that all developed severe osteopetrosis due to the complete absence of osteoclasts (Caamaño et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 1992; Sha et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1992). In addition, the absence of lymph node does not imply the development of a bone phenotype as illustrated by the absence of reported bone defect in lymphotoxin pathway-deficient mice (Locksley et al., 2001).

3.3. TNF-$\alpha$: A nonessential regulator of bone Involved in autoimmune-induced bone pathology

While not being essential for bone development, the potential role for TNF-$\alpha$ on bone homeostasis was noticed long time ago based on both *in vitro* works and on studies of inflammation-mediated bone diseases. TNF-$\alpha$ is a strong proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated T cells that is involved in autoimmune-induced bone destruction ([Walsh and Gravallese, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.blo.0000135867.87788.8d)). *In vivo*, no clear bone phenotype has been reported in TNF-$\alpha$- or TNFR-deficient mice. However, transgenic mice overexpressing a stabilized form of the human TNF-$\alpha$ ($hTNF-\alpha$ Tg) developed severe rheumatoid arthritis with all the hallmarks of the disease including bone and cartilage destruction ([Keffer et al., 1991](https://doi.org/10.1038/3500816)) and general osteopenia ([Schett et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1038/ni956)). Administration of OPG can protect the mice against bone destruction ([Redlich et al., 2002a](https://doi.org/10.1038/ni840)). In addition, when crossed with mice lacking osteoclasts which do not show any clear immune defect (*c-Fos* knockout), the $hTNF-\alpha$ Tg mice were protected against bone destruction but still developed strong inflammation and cartilage destruction ([Redlich et al., 2002b](https://doi.org/10.1038/ni841)). These data clearly demonstrated that osteoclasts are required for TNF-$\alpha$-induced bone loss and argued in favor of an indirect stimulatory effect of TNF-$\alpha$ mediated via RANKL on osteoclast differentiation. Whether TNF-$\alpha$ can also directly induce osteoclast differentiation is controversial. While it has been shown that, when combined with IL-1$\alpha$, TNF-$\alpha$ can drive osteoclast differentiation and activation in the absence of RANKL ([Kobayashi et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003556200)), other studies concluded that the presence of RANKL was required ([Lam et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003556200); [Zhang et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003556200)).

3.4. RANKL, TNF-$\alpha$: In search for differences

While both RANKL and TNF-$\alpha$ can induce osteoclast differentiation *in vitro*, it seems that only RANKL can efficiently do it *in vivo*. The reasons for the discrepancy are not clear. At the molecular level, TNF-$\alpha$ can bind to two different receptors, TNFR1 or p55 and TNFR2 or p75. TNFR1 but not TNFR2 contains a death domain that can directly couple TNF-$\alpha$ to apoptosis. The two receptors were found to have opposite function in osteoclasts. While TNFR1 promotes osteoclastogenesis, TNFR2 is inhibitory ([Abu-Amer et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003556200)). Thus, it can be hypothesized that the balance between TNFR1 and TNFR2 in favor of TNFR2 may be one of the reasons for the lack of efficiency of TNF-$\alpha$ *in vivo*. RANKL binds to RANK, a member of the TNFR that lacks the death domain and therefore should not be able to directly mediate apoptosis. Indeed, RANK acts as a survival factor for osteoclasts, a function that was found to be mediated in part via RANKL-induced Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activity ([David et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003556200)).
The TRAFs are key components in the transduction of the various members of TNFR superfamily. Not all receptors can bind to all TRAFs (Aggarwal, 2003; Chung *et al.*, 2002). The recruitment of a specific TRAF may explain the differences between TNF-$\alpha$ and RANKL. Indeed, while the pro-osteoclastogenic activity of RANKL and TNF-$\alpha$ required TRAF6 and the participation of TRAF5 (Kaji *et al.*, 2001; Kanazawa *et al.*, 2003), TRAF2 that is not mediating RANK signaling in osteoclasts is required for TNFR1 differentiating activity (Kanazawa and Kudo, 2005). TNF-$\alpha$ not only acts on the bone-resorbing cells, but also blocks bone formation by osteoblasts (Bertolini *et al.*, 1986), most likely via up-regulation of the Wingless and INT-1 (Wnt) signaling inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) (Diarra *et al.*, 2007). These functions, not described for RANKL, are also mediated via TNFR1.

Thus, it appears that the two TNF-like pathways are regulating bone homeostasis. RANKL/RANK is the required mediator of osteoclastogenesis during development and in normal physiological conditions. TNF-$\alpha$/TNFR1, TNFR2 that may act as modulators of bone homeostasis when an increased bone resorption is needed are involved in the development of pathology leading to bone destruction such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis (Ritchlin *et al.*, 2003; Walsh and Gravallese, 2004; Zenz *et al.*, 2005; Zwerina *et al.*, 2004).

## 4. IFNs: Linking Bone Homeostasis to Immunity and T Cells

The role of another family of immune-related cytokines, the IFNs, was in the last few years extensively analyzed *in vitro* and *in vivo*. This work was mainly performed by Takahashi and colleagues who analyzed the bone properties of mice strains carrying inactivating mutations of various components of the IFN responses.

### 4.1. Type I IFNs establish an autoinhibitory loop in osteoclasts

Type I IFNs are produced by most of the cells of the organism in response to viral aggression and are important mediators of the antiviral response (Dunn *et al.*, 2006). A genomic screen in which the response to M-CSF and RANKL stimulation of c-Fos-deficient monocytes was compared to wild-type cells identified IFN-$\beta$ as potential c-Fos target genes in osteoclasts. RANKL-induced up-regulation of IFN-$\beta$ was shown not to utilize the antiviral response system. Surprisingly, IFN-$\beta$ could block M-CSF and RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation *in vitro*. The inhibitory mechanism was analyzed in detail and revealed that c-Fos transcriptionally induced IFN-$\beta$ synthesis that in turn post-transcriptionally down-regulated c-Fos expression, therefore, establishing a c-Fos-dependent negative autoregulatory loop.A low bone mass phenotype due to increased osteoclast activity was found when the bone of mice carrying genetic inactivation of one of the components of the type I IFNR, IFNAR1, or lacking IFN-β were analyzed. The anti-osteoclastogenic effect of IFN-β was found to be dependent on the transcription factor interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) as shown by the lack of effect of IFN-β on the osteoclast differentiation of monocytes lacking Stat1 or IRF9, two components of ISGF3. It involved the activation of PKR, a kinase regulating translation ([Takayanagi et al., 2002b](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M205866200)) and seemed to be independent of c-Fos phosphorylation by RSK2, a kinase modulating c-Fos function in osteoblasts ([David et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M502576200)). The inhibitory effect of IFN-β was shown to depend on the level of expression of the suppressor of cytokines signaling (SOCS) that block IFN signaling. Interestingly, both SOCS1 and SOCS3 were found to be up-regulated by RANKL treatment ([Hayashi et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M203578200)), therefore, establishing a second negative loop counterbalancing the first one.

### 4.2. Type II IFN: A potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis secreted by T cells

By supporting osteoclastogenesis, activated T cells expressing RANKL are involved in autoimmune-induced bone destruction and in metastatic invasion of the bone ([Horwood et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.13.7388); [Jones et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M511510200); [Kong et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.13.7388); [Zenz et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M502576200)). The same Th1 cells that produce RANKL are also secreting high amounts of type II IFNs (IFN-γ) that strongly inhibits osteoclast differentiation *in vitro* ([Fox and Chambers, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003576200); [Takayanagi et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003576200)). *In vivo*, mice lacking IFNGR1, one of the components of the IFN-γ receptor were shown to be more sensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone destruction. Activated T cells but not the resting ones could suppress M-CSF and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Mechanistically, IFN-γ was shown to induce ubiquitin-mediated TRAF6 degradation therefore shunting RANKL signaling ([Takayanagi et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003576200)). Thus, the role of activated T cells on osteoclast differentiation appears to be paradoxical. They can both stimulate and inhibit osteoclastogenesis *in vitro*. *In vivo*, IFN-γ was proposed to stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone loss via a mechanism involving T-cell activation ([Gao et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M703576200)). The paradox was reinforced by the fact that IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells were proposed to be the T cells supporting osteoclastogenesis *in vitro* ([Kotake et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M502576200)). This view was challenged in a publication that identified the Th17 cells as osteoclastogenic T helper cells ([Sato et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M602576200)). In this work, Th1-producing IFN-γ and Th2-producing IL-4 were both shown to inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation *in vitro*. These data were in agreement with the known anti-osteoclastogenic activity of IL-10 and IL-4, both cytokines produced by the Th2 cells ([Abu-Amer, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M102576200); [Owens et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M602576200); [Wei et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M202576200)). Th17 cells donot directly induce osteoclast differentiation. They produce IL-17 that was found to be required *in vitro* and *in vivo* to enhance the supportive activity of the osteoblasts (Sato *et al.*, 2006).

From the works published so far, it clearly appears that both bone and T cells have established a very complex relationship that is involved in positive and negative regulation of bone remodeling and may be of immune response. While the connection between T cells and bone destruction is quite well understood, the potential contribution of the regulatory T cells that can be regulated by RANKL (Loser *et al.*, 2006) has not yet been properly addressed. In addition, the role of T cells in modulating bone formation is still poorly documented.

## 5. B CELLS AND BONE

In contrary to T cells, we know very little about the interrelationship of B cells with the bone. All we know is based on correlative analysis of phenotype developing in mutated mice and on experimental work that tested the possibility to transdifferentiate lymphoid cells into myeloid lineages (Horowitz *et al.*, 2005; Laiosa *et al.*, 2006). More documented is the interplay between bone and the tumor cells mediating bone destruction in multiple myeloma.

### 5.1. The hypothesis of myeloid lineage switch

The transcription factor Pax5 is a key regulator of B-cell commitment. This function was revealed by the analysis of Pax5-deficient mice where B-cell development is blocked at the pro-B-cell stage (Urbanek *et al.*, 1994). Surprisingly, Pax5-deficient pro-B cells can differentiate in all hematopoietic lineages including osteoclasts (Nutt *et al.*, 1999). Pax5 was shown to decide the B-cell fate and to suppress the expression of genes involved in the commitment of the other hematopoietic lineages. *In vivo*, Pax5-deficient mice were shown to develop osteopenia due to increased number of osteoclast progenitors (Horowitz *et al.*, 2004). Interestingly, myeloid cell differentiation could be obtained when committed B cells were forced to overexpress members of the C/EBP transcription factor family. This effect was correlated with a down-regulation of Pax5 (Xie *et al.*, 2004). However, similar experiments performed by another group did not lead to the same conclusion. Indeed, Heavey *et al.* (2003) could only reprogram Pax5-deficient progenitors but not the wild-type cells therefore challenging the transdifferentiation hypothesis. Klotho-deficient mice developed all syndromes of premature aging including low bone turnover osteopenia where decreased bone formation exceeded decreased bone resorption (Kawaguchi *et al.*, 1999; Kuro-o *et al.*, 1997). The analysis of osteoclastdifferentiation in Klotho-deficient mice indicated that B cells could regulate osteoclastogenesis by two different mechanisms. In the first one, B cells were shown to directly support osteoclastogenesis by producing RANKL. In the second one, it was shown that osteoclasts could be generated from B220 positive cells that argued in favor of a potential B-cell reprogramming (Manabe et al., 2001). More work will be needed to clearly establish the role of B cells in bone.

### 5.2. Multiple myeloma: An osteolytic tumor

Multiple myeloma is a clonal malignancy of the terminally differentiated plasma cells. This is the second most common adult hematopoietic tumor, and the most common cancer directly affecting the bone (Giuliani et al., 2006; Heider et al., 2005). Multiple myeloma is leading to osteolysis, fractures, and hypercalcemia caused by impaired bone remodeling. The bone characteristic is an increased bone resorption by osteoclasts and a decreased bone formation by osteoblasts. *In vitro*, osteoclasts are supporting survival and proliferation of myeloma cells that can directly induce osteoclast differentiation. The plasma cells isolated from multiple myeloma expressed osteoclastogenic factor such as RANKL and the chemokine MIP1-α which enhances RANKL activity. In addition of being pro-osteoclastogenic, the tumor cells are blocking osteoblast differentiation, thereby inhibiting bone formation (Giuliani et al., 2006). This effect is most likely due to the expression by the plasma cells, of DKK-1. Therefore, a vicious circle is established in which the plasma cells induced bone destruction by osteoclast that mobilized factors promoting proliferation and survival of the tumor cells that also inhibit osteoblast differentiation and stimulate the osteoclastogenic activity of the pre-osteoblasts. This circle can be disrupted by anti-osteoclastogenic drugs such as bisphosphonates.

## 6. A BONE QUALITY CONTROL OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE

The most exciting new concept emerging from osteoimmunology is that the bone would exert a quality control on the immune response by controlling the availability of the HSCs. This function would require a tight control of bone remodeling by both the bone-forming cells or osteoblasts and the bone-resorbing cells or osteoclasts. There are several indications that suggested it. The active osteoblasts are bone lining cells secreting and mineralizing the bone matrix. They express the stem cells chemoattractant and survival factor stromal-cell derived factor-1 (SDF1) (Ponomaryov et al., 2000). A subset of spindle-shaped cells that colocalized with the lining osteoblasts on the trabecular bone, expressing N-cadherin and CD45⁻ [spindle-shaped N-cadherin+CD45-osteoblastic (SNO) cells],were identified as the niche for the HSCs (Calvi et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003). SNO cells maintain HSCs in quiescence stage. Osteoblasts can negatively control the pool of HSCs available by producing osteopontin that inhibits HSCs proliferation (Nilsson et al., 2005; Stier et al., 2005). In addition, osteopontin is required for the proper localization of the HSCs (Nilsson et al., 2005). Stimulation of bone resorption increases the number of immature hematopoietic cells in the circulation, suggesting that osteoclasts, by destroying the architecture of the niche, play a key function in mobilizing HSCs (Kollet et al., 2006). This function involves the production by osteoclasts of peptidases (MMP-9, cathepsin K) (Engsig et al., 2000; Gelb et al., 1996) that can cleave the adhesion molecule and factor essential for the maintenance of the HSC niche such as SDF1. When mobilized, HSCs need to migrate through the bone marrow to meet the epithelial cells of sinusoidal vessel. These epithelial cells define a new niche for the HSCs, called vascular niche, that support their proliferation, differentiation, as well as their passage into the circulation (Yin and Li, 2006). Therefore, compartmentalization and polarization of the bone are established in order to properly control hematopoiesis.

How can bone be modulating immunity? The HSC niche in the bone can be expanded by treatment increasing the number of osteoblasts, while it decreased when the trabecular bone volume or the number of osteoblasts is reduced (Calvi et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003). Changes in bone quality can reversibly affect hematopoiesis (Visnjic et al., 2004). Mobilization of the HSC can be performed either by activating osteoclast activity or by inducing the degradation of essential homing factors (Adams et al., 2007; Petit et al., 2002). It is therefore tempting to think that treatment modifying the balance between bone formation and bone resorption could be used to improve immune response. However, there are several observations arguing against this option. First, the bone is homing not only the HSCs but also the long-lived plasma cells important for the memory of the immune response that may also be perturbed (Moser et al., 2006). Second, the strategy may be difficult to apply due to the difference of kinetics between bone formation and destruction. Indeed, while bone destruction by osteoclasts is a rather quick event; bone formation is a slow process that is not easily stimulated. The option of stimulating bone resorption to mobilize HSCs should be taken with care. Inducing bone resorption can have definitive deleterious consequences for the bone. Indeed, if bone trabecular structures can be reversibly destroyed in mice which are continuously growing due to the persistence of an active growth plate (Corral et al., 1998; Visnjic et al., 2004), this is probably not possible in human where the growth plate is progressively becoming inactive with age. Finally, a change of localization more than a change in the quality of hematopoiesis has so far been reported in most of the animal models with impaired bone remodeling. Osteopetrosis or osteosclerosis as
well as osteoblast deprivation that impaired the hematopoietic function in the bone marrow all resulted in compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis (Jochum *et al.*, 2000; Okada *et al.*, 1994; Visnjic *et al.*, 2004; Wang *et al.*, 1992). Therefore, challenging the immune response in mice developing various bone diseases will be needed before speculating about any therapeutic application.
